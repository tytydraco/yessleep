*Part 1*

The mirror had a paper sign taped to it: **FREE**

It leaned against a brownstone stoop on Branford Ave, between a shuttered deli and a barber with a spinning red pole. The glass was tall enough to show me from head to toe, set in a carved wooden frame that had probably been expensive when the world was quieter. I told myself I was rescuing it. Truth is, I wanted a win. My apartment looks bigger when you can see yourself inside it. It's pretty empty so far; all I really have is a bed, TV, and the usual, but nothing fancy like this mirror.

"You taking that?" The barber called from his doorway, flicking ash.

"If it's free," I said.

"Nothing's free," he said, and went back inside. It sounded like advice masquerading as small talk. He stuck his head out again. "Wasn't here when I opened," he added. "Stuff just shows up. It's a city."

I checked for cracks. None. The frame felt warm, not sun-warm, but hand-warm, as if someone had just lifted their palm away. I peeled the sign loose so it wouldn't flap while I carried it. The free looked like block letters, only neater. I hauled the mirror home awkwardly, the scrollwork biting into my forearms, and propped it in the hallway across from my kitchen doorway. Right away, it made the place look taller. It made me look... put together.

The first night, I noticed a lag. Not a big one. I lifted my hand; the reflection-me, obviously, was a hair late. I told myself I was tired. Fluorescents hum, hands shake, brains invent.

I stood there longer than I meant to, watching the dim hallway behind me repeat itself. The mirror's version of my apartment looked the same, except the ceiling stain above the smoke alarm wasn't there. A tiny difference. Or I just hadn't noticed mine before.

I tried to catch the lag again-quick, stupid gestures. If anyone had looked through my peephole, they would've seen a guy shadow-boxing his own face. Nothing. Perfect sync.

I turned away, and the reflection didn't. I felt it more than saw it. a weight behind my shoulder blades, the air turned thick as old syrup. I looked back. The me in the mirror smiled tightly, embarrassed. The smile I do in photos when I hate myself for being in them.

"Stop," I said to nobody.

In the mirror, I watched my mouth shape the word a fraction late. I didn't hear anything-just the fluorescent hum shifting key, like it wanted to listen.

I let the hallway light burn and went to bed. The stove clock blinked 3:13 a.m. like it had lost power. I hadn't unplugged anything.

Around 2 a.m., something woke me. Not a noise, an idea landing in my skull with both feet. I got up and walked to the doorway barefoot. The mirror reflected the hallway, the cracked dish on the entry table, and me. It also reflected the window by the sink.

The window in the reflection had its blinds up. Mine were down.

I lifted my blinds. The reflection lowered theirs.

I stood there with my hands on my own cheap vinyl slats, heart pounding, and whispered, "Stop."

In the mirror, I nodded.

I didn't.

I went back to bed and left the blinds up. The reflection left theirs down.

I woke with a thin line of dried blood on my cheek like a cat had sized me up in the night. I don't have a cat. The line on the other side, where my face met the glass, looked clean and surgical. The one on me wasn't.

*END OF PART 1*

*PART 2*

I covered the glass with an old blanket before work, an impulse move like throwing a towel over a birdcage. I told myself it was to keep the dust off. When I got home, the blanket was on the floor, folded into a decent square.

I live alone.

It was a bad week—double shifts and bad coffee and that feeling like your skin's a half-size too small. I started catching the mirror with its timing off, not lagging, but out of phase. As I walked past, I'd see myself already turning. I stopped eating in the kitchen because I kept catching my reflection watching me chew with its tongue pushed against the side of its mouth like a dog tasting a new word.

On Thursday, I boiled pasta. Steam fogged the hallway, and the mirror found itself a bathroom. Letters drew themselves into the condensation with slow, patient strokes.

**BORROWED.**

The letters fattened with condensation like veins. When I wiped them, my forearm burned—mirror-backward **D E W O R R O B** welted there like a stamp someone pressed too hard.

I couldn't pretend after that. Whatever happened **there** happened **here.**

I started testing. Stupid small stuff. I raised my left hand. The reflection raised their too, no camera-app nonsense. I leaned in until my breath ghosted the glass. The me on the other side leaned in, eyes wide, a brown freckle I know by heart under the right one. I lifted my shirt to check the small surgical scar on my ribs. It was there. It was me. That was the worst part. It wasn't a stranger. It was I who was wrong.

I went to the hardware store on Fulton and bought painter's tape and a roll of coarse twine. Back home, I taped a grid over the glass, stringing the twine so the surface was a spiderweb of little squares. If anything in there went out of bounds, I'd see it.

That night, around 3 a.m., a square near the bottom left darkened like breath on winter glass. A fingertip pressed up from the other side, testing the give. Another finger. They traced the string, learned the pattern, and then... slowly, so slowly, dragged downward.

Each time the fingertip slid along the twine, the string sang, a small mouse-squeak. I felt in my teeth. The black line it left inside the glass looked wet. My shin answered with a sting mirror couldn't possibly know,

I looked down and watched a thin line appear in my skin, a shallow, smarting cut blooming dot by dot like a Polaroid of pain.

I yelled, "FUCK! OW!" The sound hurt my ears more than the cut. I grabbed the dish towel from the entry table, pressed it to my leg, and stared as the fingertip in the mirror wrote one more word in the fogged square.

**KEEP.**

I slept with the lights on, perched on the edge of the couch. I wore socks so nothing could touch my ankles.

I woke up barefoot.

*END OF PART 2*

*PART 3*

Friday, I told myself to be normal. I texted Nora (co-worker) to swing by under the pretense of "I finally decorated." She came with iced coffees and a mercy candle that smelled like laundry.

"Be honest," Nora said, setting the iced coffee on my entry dish. "This is a haunted Goodwill score."

"It's fine," I lied. "It just... lags."

"Like a Zoom call?"

"Like a person."

She snorted, then stopped. "Okay, I hate that you said that."

We moved it. The frame bit my palms. "Careful," she said. "Don't crack your face in it. Seven years of selfies."

We shuffled it opposite the bathroom door. The twine grid quivered. I kept my eyes down because looking into it while I held it felt like giving someone your throat.

"Better," Nora said. "Less... first thing you see."

The water shut off in the bathroom. I stood catching my breath. In the mirror, across the hall, the bathroom door was closed. Mine was open.

"Nora," I said.

"What?"

In the glass, she stepped out of the bathroom and didn't look at me. She looked at the edge of the frame and smiled like she'd found a window that only opened one way. Then she raised her hand, palm toward the glass, like she wanted a high five.

"You okay?" real Nora asked beside me. "You look like hot pennies smell."

"Do you see—" I started.

"See what?"

"Nothing," I said, and made rules that night. Not written (I'd learned my lesson). I said them out loud; **Do not look with the lights off. Do not adjust the blinds. Do not touch the glass. Do not acknowledge it.**

The mirror doesn't care about my rules.

At 3:13 a.m., time stamped in my head like a burned-in watermark—I woke to knocking. Not at my door. From the hallway. Two careful knuckles on glass. Cold slid over the hallway like a refrigerator door opening. The twine squeaked softly after each knock, like a string being tuned. I stared at the seiling and pretended I could ignore it. The fourth knock came lower, like knuckles searching for where I was.

I got up because people get up. I stood in the doorway and looked. In the mirror, I was already there, two steps closer than me, eyes a little too wide like someone had told a decent joke, and I was waiting to see if I was allowed to laugh.

I raised my hand like an idiot about to touch a hot stove.

The other me mouthed a word.

**PLEASE**

I went and got a painter's drop cloth from under the sink nd threw it over the mirror like drowning something in a pillowcase.

The knocking kept going under the cloth until it didn't. On the fourth knock, something tapped from **my** side of the cloth.

*END OF PART 3*

*PART 4*

Saturday morning, I tried to take it back. I couldn't take it anymore.

I carried the mirror down the four flights in my socks because shoes felt disrespectful, and left bloody half-moons on the stairs where the frame bit my hands. Out of Branford, I set it where I'd found it, under the barber pole, the city coming alive around us. I put the old FREE sign on it and added SORRY.

A woman with a stroller slowed down. I stepped between her and the glass without thinking. "It's cracked," I said. "Bad luck." I made my face friendly and a little deranged. She moved on.

I waited. One hour, then two. The barber came out to smoke and told me he didn't mind, but did I want to tape the sign to the pole so it didn't blow and decapitate a bus. He tore a square of yellow paper from a pad. "City gets fussy about sidewalk stuff. Leave a number in case someone complains." I wrote mine and stuck it under the FREE sign. I asked him if he'd ever seen it here before. He shook his head no, then yes, then no. "Stuff just shows up," he said. "It's a city."

Around noon, a guy in a moving truck pulled up and stuck his head out. "We just bought a place in Briar's End," he said. "My wife loves vintage."

"Tell her congratulations," I said, and didn't move.

He laughed, then didn't. "You ever get that feeling like an empty room is looking at you? I just git that feeling."

"The mirror's—" I started.

He glanced at the glass. The surface didn't shine; it **noticed.** It felt like the air took a breath and held it until my eyes watered.

"You know what?" he said, shivering like a dog shaking off river water. "My wife will kill me. Good luck, man"

He drove away. I carried the mirror back up because some debts are personal.

Back in the hall, I taped the twine again and sat on the floor with my back to the opposite wall. I didn't look directly in. Periphery only. The other me paced in there like a caged thing. We mirrored each other badly.

"Okay," I said finally. "Take back what?"

He mouthed something and stopped. He looked at his right wrist, turned it so I could see. There was a bracelet there in his world. Woven thread, blue and white, and sun-bleached yellow. I owned that bracelet once, in 7th grade, at camp on Macon Lake. I lost it in the water. It never dried. 

He tugged the bracelet off and pressed it to the glass. It left a wet circle, like the glass was on the other side of rain.

My forearm went cold. When I lifted my sleeve, the bracelet was there, damp against my skin, knots swollen like they'd lived underwater.

I ripped it off and threw it. It slapped the hallway floor and lay there steaming.

He smiled. Not the photo-smile. Something relieved and hungry. He pressed his hand to the glass again. I knew what he wanted to trade next. He wanted to trade places with me..

"Stop," I said. "If I give you...If I give you **ME**, what happens when it's skin instead of string?"

He shrugged a little, a movement I've hated in mirrors my whole life. He mouthed a new word.

**SOON.**

My phone screen lit up by itself. New contact added: Me. The number was mine. The photo wasn't.

**Recent calls:**

**3:13 AM - Me (missed)**

**3:13 AM - Me (missed)**

That night, I dreamed I was on the wrong side, banging. I woke up with my knuckles bruised and the twine grid damp with breath that wasn't mine. 

*END OF PART 4*

*PART 5*

I called in sick on Sunday because I wasn't. I made tea because that's what you do when you don't know what to do. I set the mug beside the entry dish and sat opposite the mirror again, the way you sit opposite a friend you don't trust and a stranger you do.

"Show me," I said.

He did. He backed up, staying carefully inside the frame, until I could see more of his hallway. No ceiling stain. Same cheap light fixture. The entry table in there had a different dish—a blue ceramic instead of my cracked glass. The door to the bathroom was shut. He made a pointing gesture at it, two fingers, come see.

I didn't move. He opened the bathroom door on his side, and the mirror showed a reflection of a room with no mirror over the sink, just a blank wall. He mouthed another word, not one I've ever liked.

**ALONE.**

I don't know why I did what I did next. I wanted to prove something, maybe, to him or me or the rules. I reached into my pocket and took out my house key. I pressed the tip of it to the glass, hard enough to make the twine squeak.

On his side, a silver point met my keyhead perfectly. He'd brought his too.

"If we're the same," I said, pressing metal to cold, "prove it hurts you too."

He did.

We pressed. Metal on metal, the sound is small and disgusting. The keys scraped along the surface and left a thin white line that wasn't on my side. It was on him. His cheek, the same place as that first dried blood line on mine.

He flinched.

I didn't

"Hurts, doesn't it?" I said, full of a petty heat even I hated.

He smiled, wide and wrong, teeth I knew too well. He pressed his key to the glass again—harder. I saw where he was siming a split second before the pain hit. Not my cheek this time.

I made a sound I won't write down. Use your imagination.

I fell sideways. Tea flooded the floor. The twine grid trembled. The strings hummed a thin note I felt in the fillings of my teeth. On the other side, he watched me curl around myself, and he touched the glass with his fingertips like a child touching a TV screen.

He mouthed a last word I understood all too well, forward or backward.

**MINE.**

I crawled, gasping, and threw the drop cloth over the mirror. I nailed it in place this time, the cheap way—tacks into plaster—the sound of hammer on wall wild and small. Each hit made the glass answer with a soft, bell-jar thrum, the way a big insect does against a lampshade.

The closet has shelves. I emptied it. I dragged the mirror inside, cloth and all, and wedged it between the winter coats and the box of cables that fit nothing I own. I shut the door.. I pushed the dresser in front of the door, I sat on the floor with my back to it, and listened.

Something in there breathed like a person who can't calm down and won't

It stopped around dawn.

It was Monday. I sat at my kitchen table with the blinds up and the window, pretending to be neutral. I kept thinking I saw my reflection in the dark screen of the microwave, moving in a way I didn't like. 

I called the barber to ask if anyone had picked up a mirror yesterday, just to make sure I hadn;t hallucinated moving it back. He said the weirdest thing. He said he watched me put it out there and then watched me carry it away again. He said, "I felt bad for you. You looked like you lost the fight."

I found a note under the closet door that I didn't put there. Cash-register paper, a little curled, smelling like the barber's shop

One word, in backward steam-script: **DUE**.

*END OF PART 5*

*PART 6*

The note said DUE, so I paid what I could: time.

I set an alarm for 3:12 a.m., lay on the floor by the dresser, and watched the minute flip. When it did, the closet breathed in

"No trades," I said. "No more bracelets. Keep what you took. Leave what's mine."

I don't think it understood the words. I think it understood the **want.** 

The tacks holding the cloth ticked in their holes like cooling metal. Something traced the twine grid through the blanket, learning the squares by memory. It tapped two knuckles—once, twice—then stopped and tapped a third one, lower, where my head had rested last night.

"I hear you," I said. "That's all you get."

A slow line burned across my palm, mirror-backward letters arriving out of order like receipts from a bad printer. **E M. A N. Y M.** I pressed my hand to the floor until the boards printed themselves in skin.

"Name," it was trying to write. It wanted my **name** in its spelling.

I didn't give it. I gave it something worse.

"Keep the cut," I said. "Keep the bruise. Keep the time."

Everything went very quiet. Then the cloth ballooned once, like a breath held as long as lungs allowed, and fell.

At 7:02 a.m., I woke on the kitchen floor. The ceiling stain was gone. The laundry candle smelled like static. My entry dish was whole.

I checked the closet. The dresser slid easily. The door opened without a complaint. The mirror—cloth and all—was gone.

At 7:05 a.m., the barber texted me from a number I didn't have saved: *Someone left a mirror out here. Says FREE. You want it back?* I typed **No.** I typed **Do not touch it.** I typed **Don't let it see you.** I deleted all of it and sent **Thanks.**

At 7:13 a.m., my phone rang. The contact said **Me.** The photo was of me, smiling a little too widely beside a blue ceramic dish I don't own. I felt it ring until it stopped.

It rang again at 3:13 a.m.
