I felt heat on my face. I grimaced. It was like I was waking from a sleep that had lasted thousands of years. I became aware of the water all around me, although I couldn’t piece together what that meant. For some time, my thoughts just drifted along, just as my body did on the surface of the water. Eventually, the darkness around me gave way to a faint reddish tinge, which I realised was the light of the sun against the back of my eyelids.

I was confused. I could hear the sounds of a gently swishing ocean and seagulls cawing overhead. I tried to remember, but everything was shattered. I wasn’t even sure who I was at that point. I was essentially a baby, reduced to a state of nothing, and, ready or not, having to start learning about the world around it.

I didn’t want to open my eyes because I didn’t want to know where ‘here’ was. In that moment, I didn’t need to accept either reality – if I had been just dreaming or if I really had been through that whole… experience. I didn’t want to know. I wanted to just be. The weight of either possibility was too crushing to bear, so I just put it off.

I suppose I would have kept on putting it off for much longer if it hadn’t been for a new sound piercing my peace. It was a voice, which startled me. I still didn’t want to look, though. I didn’t want to know. It called out again. Still, I prayed it would stop. It was only on the third call that I realised what the sound was saying. It was a word that I should have known well but nearly didn’t recognise – my own name.

I finally opened my eyes and immediately needed to shield them with my hand. The light of the world around me rushed in. They ached from the light, but I could see. It didn’t take long for them to adjust and for me to spot the source of all the noise. It was a man I didn’t recognise but knew to be Youssouf, aboard the same boat I had disembarked some time ago. He was waving at me in a panic, his own eyes telling of his concern. Looking down, I realised where that look came from; I was completely naked.

Youssouf got me aboard and wrapped in a towel. He kept asking me what had happened, but I had no words for him. I just sat in the corner staring at the floor, trying to make sense of everything. I couldn’t help but stare at his face. Something was off about it; it looked wrong. Like the feeling of walking into a room but all the furniture having been rearranged. It was the same, but not as I remembered. I think he felt the same about me, eventually giving up and just focusing on guiding the boat back to shore. That was when I had a question of my own for him. I asked him how long I had been gone. He answered that it had been barely over an hour.

The rest of the ride back was done in silence. When we got back to shore, Youssouf fetched some old, ill-fitting clothes for me to get me back to the hotel. When we arrived, I thanked him briefly and gave him the agreed wage plus a sizable tip. Mission accomplished… He took the money and left without a word. That was the last I saw of him. At that point, I think he was more than happy to be done with me.

I spent the remaining days of my time in Domoni locked in my hotel room. I couldn’t bear the thought of the outside world. If I even stepped out onto my balcony, I could feel the world’s eyes on me, like they were regarding me as the freak I was. I was convinced they were watching me, and my only refuge was the four walls of my tiny room.

Physically, I was in good shape. I had no wounds to speak of. Even bruises and cuts that I got in the cave had disappeared completely, as if they had never been there at all. As for my eyes, they were also perfectly fine, if not better than ever. Before, my vision was never perfect, and I was just a few years off from needing glasses or surgery. Now, I can see things from far away, and everything appears with a crispness that I haven’t experienced in a number of years. All in all, I had never felt healthier.

On the other hand, mentally I was a mess. I would oscillate wildly between crying and laughing in my moments of mania before crashing into a deep depression that left me bedbound for hours at a time. I was assaulted by visions that mystified and terrified me. This cycle was only broken once a day when I would have to go to the door and tell room service not to come in. I didn’t eat or drink anything. You may not believe me, but I still haven’t. The very thought of food sickens me. The last meal I had was the meagre breakfast I had that morning before setting off.

I spent 5 days trapped in that loop before a notification popped up on my phone reminding me of my trip back home. This brought me back from my insanity just enough to get everything packed and to set off on the long journey. I was in a daze for most of this, and my memory is blurred. I can mostly just remember being slumped vacantly in a seat until reaching my next transfer, again and again until, at long last, I was curled up in my own bed for the first time in a long time. What I could not have prepared for was how alien it felt when I finally did.

Six months have passed since then. I used to have things like a job, friends, and even a steady girlfriend. They don’t matter now. When they saw me – the me that returned from the cave – I knew they no longer recognised me, just as I no longer did them. I was like someone wearing the skin of another they loved, and for me it was the same. It’s like we are stuck on the opposite sides of a distorted mirror, with the reflections being too difficult to see. I have been well and truly alone for the past 5 months. At least, almost.

Late at night, most nights, I can still feel that deep rumble coming from beneath the earth. I can just feel the being, still out there and calling to me from deep in the Earth’s crust. I find it difficult to sleep, but when I do, I often dream of the cave. It’s a full-body experience. I can feel the water still around me, hear the whispers of the others, and see the twisting and dancing shapes play out before my eyes. The only thing I cannot see is the being itself. As many times as I try to look at it, there is only darkness that greets me. Everything else is perfect, but that remains a large dark cloud obscuring the magnificence of the being ahead of me.

It is torture. I don’t mean the loneliness, the visions, or the looming threat of madness. What haunts me to this day is that I never got to see it for myself. I was so lucky to bask in its glory, yet it seems like a most dreadful cosmic joke that my journey to the centre of the divine would rob me of my faculties to experience it in its completeness. I have a whole sketchpad of drawings next to me right now, a hobby that I only recently took up. I found it a good way to get the madness out of my head and onto paper. I have drawn the divine a thousand different ways, in a thousand different styles, but none of these pathetic scribbles have ever amounted to anything. They have never felt right, and I know I am only chasing the shadow of something I could never hope to reproduce. They always feel wrong – something is missing, and I have no idea what it is. I pray that the others will pierce the veil and whisper the answer to me, but, so far, I remain unanswered. I yearn for contact with them because I know now that I am one of them.

A few weeks ago, I came to a realisation that I would never again feel peace as I am right now. I don’t have much money left at this point, but there is just enough for another trip, one way. I need to go back. I need to see it. I honestly don’t know if I can survive the journey to the centre again. Truthfully, I am doubtful. But there is no other way. Whether I die or not, I know I am going where I belong. My place with those of the surface has been over since that day. I need to rejoin it. I need to see it. I need to be with it, for now and forever. I know my true place in life, and it is not here.

If you yourself hear the call, all you need to do is listen.
