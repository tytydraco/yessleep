“W-what the hell are we supposed to do now?” Dustin asked as he looked around, completely dumbfounded. Guess they didn’t cover rogue revenant showdowns on his detective’s exam.

“The only thing we can do,” I answered after thinking over our less than optimal options. I then cocked my crossbow and steadily started towards the dark recesses of the warehouse. “Make sure both of them make it out of this alive.”

He nodded, coming back to his senses. Then he took charge- where he should be- overtaking my stride and leading the way.

We traversed down a concrete tunnel-like hallway that was covered in graffiti, following Sage’s voice as it reverberated off the walls. By the sound of it, she was having  one of those villainous monologue moments that takes place right before an epic battle. “You really don’t remember anything, do you?”

Dustin and I finally reached the end of the hallway. It opened up to a lofted balcony with a staircase leading down to the main floor. Cautiously, we walked over to the railing and peeked over.

The first floor was the size of a football field. Empty, rusted, and broken down storage shelves and equipment were everywhere. Deep in a back corner, it looked like someone had set up a makeshift living room. There were a couple couches, a coffee table, and rug- all orientated around the mounted tv. I realized then where we were. This place was Fake Sage’s old nest.

In the open center of the warehouse, Sage and Rudy were slowly walking circles around each other.

Moonlight started to filter in through the exposed rafters of a large portion of collapsed ceiling, giving us a clear visual on the two supernaturals. Because of all the dust floating in the air, that was probably the only time I’d ever see a vampire sparkle.

I figured she looked young by the sound of her voice, and I’d been right. Sage couldn’t have been older than twenty-five when she was turned. Curtain bangs framed her slim face. Long, dirty blonde hair, fell down in loose waves around her shoulders. Sage’s boho hairstyle, acid wash bell-bottom jeans, and flared pink blouse made her look like a hippie.

“Nope,” Rudy said with a snarl, putting his fists up, ready to fight. “All I know, is I gotta overwhelming urge to rip your face off.”

Sage jerked forward, snapping her jaw shut like a shark. Rudy flinched back slightly before quickly steadying himself.

“C’mon, then,” Sage goaded as her eyes flashed red, waving him towards her. “Try your best, revenant.”

Accepting the challenge, Rudy shook the tension out of his wrists and cracked his neck.

I pivoted to make my way down the stairs and nip this in the bud before it could even begin, but Dustin quickly grabbed my shoulder and stopped me.

“Unless you want to get your head torn off, I suggest we stay up here for the time being. It looks like things are about to get pretty ugly.”

Despite the overwhelming urge to go down there and try to take control of the situation anyway, I stayed. Dustin was right, getting caught in the crossfire wouldn’t help anybody. All we could do was let the inevitable happen and moderate from the sidelines.

“Oh, I’m *so* going to enjoy kicking your ass!” Sage giggled after dodging Rudy’s first attack. He’d put a lot of momentum behind his punch, so he stumbled forward past her when his fist didn’t connect with anything.

With an evil grin, she wound her elbow up and struck him in the spine. Rudy squeaked as he fell to the ground with a thud, the wind knocked out of him.

He spit, turning to face his opponent. “Savor that sting in your arm, sweetie. That’s the first and last hit you’re going to get in.” Rudy seemed to fly as he kick-up’d off the ground.

Sage cracked her knuckles confidently. “We’ll see about that.”

What ensued looked like a fight straight out of a Saturday morning cartoon. The two of them seemed to be swept up in a twirling tornado as they used their paranormal capabilities, struggling to keep the upper hand over the other.

Dustin and I were afraid to blink with how hard the fight was to follow. We would miss a devastating blow here or a gut wrenching kick there if we did.

However, the tide of the fight seemed to turn in Rudy’s favor after Sage had kicked him to the ground for the umpteenth time. Instead of immediately getting back to his feet like usual, he managed to grab the broken off section of a storage shelf. He swung with all his might, socking Sage right in the face, sending her whole body flying.

I could tell something in him snapped then. His eyes seemed to glow brighter, his fangs got longer and sharper. Even his nails seemed to become thick talons. Rudy’s eyes got dark as he went feral, jumping on top of Sage before she had a chance to get back up again.

A chill went down my spine as a pained roar echoed through the warehouse as he punched, slapped, kicked, and clawed. Sage’s screams filled the empty space.

“I’m going to shoot!” Dustin said, aiming his crossbow right at Rudy’s heart.

“No, don’t!” I lunged for his weapon, pushing  it right as he released the trigger. The trajectory of the stake veered off to the right, whistling past Rudy’s ear and landing in a pile of rubble. He didn’t seem to notice. “We’re not authorized to!”

“*God damn it*, Lucy, look at him!” Dustin yelled at me, reloading the crossbow. “He’s going to tear her to shreds and we need her alive!”

“We also need him alive,” I reminded him, harshly gripping his forearm. “He’s a victim here too!”

I pointed down at Rudy as he continued wailing on Sage. “Look.”

Dustin leaned closer and squinted his eyes. That’s when he noticed the black bloody tears flowing from the revenants eyes. Rudy was sobbing. “Why are you fighting so hard for him all of a sudden?” He questioned. “You wanted him dead earlier.”

The pained expression of guilt and loss on Rudy’s face as he cried felt all too familiar. It resonated within me. “I- I don’t know…”

“Well you better figure out how to get him out of that trance then,” Dustin said with a scoff. “That monster will leave nothing left.”

“That’s it, Dustin, you’re a genius! I could kiss you right now,” I stated, grabbing his cheeks and squishing them together making his lips pop out like a fish before gunning it to the railing.

“Rudy,” I called. My voice fell upon deaf ears as he was still focused on destroying the vampire’s every atom. “Rudy, don’t do this, please!”

He continued to scrape and tear faster than Sage’s vampiric healing could keep up with. If I didn’t do something soon she’d be beyond saving.

“*Rudy!*” I screamed at the top of my lungs, almost falling over the railing as it started to rattle. “You’re a **monster.**”

He paused as soon as the word passed through my lips. While he’d stopped, Rudy’s eyes were still looking down at Sage; but his ears were listening to me. I’d somehow managed to get through to him. Not wasting the opportunity, I continued.

“You do this, Rudy, you kill her? You become a monster.”

“So what?” He snapped, wrapping his hand around Sage’s throat and squeezing. She let out a soft groan. “She deserves it.”

Running the risk of sounding like a pick-me girl, I said, “This isn’t you.”

“And how would you know?” Rudy hissed. “You don’t know me. Hell, I don’t even know myself!”With one hand, he lifted Sage up by the neck. She started to gasp out for air and claw at his wrists, but to no avail.

“Maybe I am a monster.”

“Yeah, maybe, but you don’t have to be. I know your type, you despise monsters. Don’t become the thing you despise. If not for yourself,” I grabbed the Polaroid that Dustin had stolen from the Old Brooks Motel crime scene out of my pocket and tossed it over the edge. The photo fluttered through the air in a random zig-zag pattern before landing right at Rudy’s feet. His eyes flickered to the picture. You could see the gears start turning in his head as he desperately tried to remember his loved ones. Then they moved to the reflection in the standing puddle of water right above it, taking in the truly nightmarish features that stared back, before going back to the photo. “…then for them.”

Rudy stood there for a moment before the brown returned to his eyes. He tossed Sage down to the ground like a rag doll with a grunt, “fine.”

His eyes glowed red again, staring down at the battered woman, trying to figure out what he’d done for her to cause so much pain and damage. He was about to lose control again, but Rudy roughly slapped himself out of it. Shoving his hands into his pockets, walking away and kicking a non existent rock instead.

Right as Dustin and I were about to go down and retrieve the vampire, slight movement and a weak chuckle came from behind Rudy. She was still, somehow, *awake.*

“You see, you may be a little stronger and a smidge faster than me, revenant,” Sage spat, her breaths uneven and weak. Slowly, she peeled her upper half off the ground. “But I have something you don’t have.”

“Yeah?” Rudy asked, still sulking, “what’s that?”

“Experience. I’ve been a vampire for almost fifty years now and here’s the most important thing I’ve learned-“

“Rudy!” I called out after seeing her lick up stray flecks of his blood from the floor. Her pupils exploded as she got the energy boost she needed. I tried to warn him, seeing her get up before he did, but he turned around to face me.

“*Never* let yourself get distracted in a fight.” Sage decked Rudy in the face pretty good, busting his right cheek wide open. She gripped his shoulders tightly and leaned in real close, whispering, “You might have won this battle, but we’ll see who wins the war.”

Taking advantage of him standing there, still stunned from her attack, Sage made a mad dash for the exit. I flew down the stairs trying to get to both her and Rudy in time. Dustin stayed at the top of the loft, quickly drawing his crossbow. The tip of one stake narrowly missed the vampire’s head as she ran. Dustin booked it down the flight of stairs as well, meeting up with me at the bottom step. Two more shots fired in rapid succession- both missed.

At this point, I’m *really* starting to think he should log a couple more hours at the shooting range.

Sage then disappeared, her words echoing through the air as she escaped into the night. “This isn’t over!”

A thick tension filled the warehouse as the weight of the reality of our situation set in. Our primary suspect, and vampiric serial killer, had just escaped. *Shit.*

Rudy broke the silence. “I roughed her up pretty good,” he said out of breath, wiping off some black blood dripping from the wound on his cheek. “Doubt she’ll make it far.”

This set Davidson off. In a rage, Dustin went and kicked the back of Rudy’s knee, sending the small man to the ground. He yanked the revenant’s wrists behind his back before double cuffing him. He picked him up by the armpit and started hauling ass back to the liftback.

Not knowing what else to do, and stuck in a flurry of my own thoughts, I absentmindedly followed behind them.

“I just saved your ass! This is really how you’re going to repay me?” Rudy retorted after a particularly harsh shove.

Dustin suddenly skittered to a stop. “Saved? *Saved?!* You broke out of prison and overtook our whole operation!” He pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed, “Not to mention you went berserk back there and almost killed our main suspect!”

“What else did you want me to do?” Rudy asked defensively. “I can *guarantee* that the two of you would’ve ended up as vampire chow if you’d went in alone. The only reason she’s still standing right now is because she’s the killer and has been binge drinking blood. That means the chick was absolutely WIRED!” Rudy’s eyebrows furrowed as he went deep in thought, “Wait…how did I know that?”

“Good grief,” Dustin griped.

“You were a monster hunter before,” I told him.

Rudy paused, mulling that information over. “My mind doesn’t remember but it seems my body sure does. I can’t believe I fought like that. I- I don’t know how to describe it exactly, but it’s like this *rush* came over me. I felt so *strong* and so *powerful,* like I could do *anything…*”

My pulse started racing and my palms got sweaty as I remembered the last thing Rudy had been doing before we left and he broke out. He’d been drinking blood. My blood.

“That’s nice. Now, get moving!” Dustin grumbled, kicking the back of Rudy’s feet to get him walking. As they continued to make their way out into the parking lot, my partner turned his neck and shot me one of his infamous glares. I guess Dustin still wanted to have that talk later.

Detective Davidson dug a pair of car keys out from his pocket as we approached his liftback. The car chirped as he pressed the unlock button. I popped and held the back door open while Dustin shoved the escapee down in the backseat.

After Rudy was tightly secured and situated, I sat down in my usual seat with the door open while Dustin walked around to the Driver’s side. He didn’t get in though. He stood with his hands on his hips, staring up at the moon. It was full and glowing brightly, basking him in a thick layer of moonlight. According to the news it was a super moon that night. A beaver moon.

A bitter breeze brought some fresh air into the vehicle. The still silence that followed allowed me to finally process the events of the last five minutes.

“Fuck!”I shouted, angrily slamming my fist on the dashboard with all my might. The car shook due to my outburst, the glove compartment popping open. “I can’t believe she got away,” I leaned back in my chair and sighed.

Rudy looked at me through the rearview mirror judgmentally before muttering into his shoulder, “You heard her back there. She’ll be back.”

Dustin then tapped his finger on the driver’s side glass window twice to get my attention. After receiving it, he motioned for me to roll down the window. Stretching across my seat, I did as instructed, turning the little handle all the way until there was no window left to roll down.

“Go easy on ol’ Mabel, eh?” he said patting the top of his car gently, pointing to the open glove box. “She’s not getting any younger.”

“You named your car, Mabel?” Rudy antagonized from the back seat. That earned him a hearty stare from Dustin. Rudy shifted uncomfortably in his seat, turning his head to look out the window.

“Pass me my lighter and smokes?” Dustin asked, once again pointing at the glove compartment.

“Really?” I asked, rifling through the junk filling up the small space. I found an almost empty box of Marlboro lights and tossed it. He told me he was giving up smoking a month ago. And, for the most part, he’d been keeping good on his word. I didn’t even know he still had a pack left. “You’re going to smoke *now?*”

Dustin shook the box and tapped it on the palm of his hand a couple times before sliding out a cigarette and sticking it between his lips. “What?! I’m stressed.”

Now it was my turn to give him a look. He just stared at me expectantly.

“Didn’t find a lighter.”

Dustin took the cigarette out of his mouth and held it between his middle and pointer finger, placing a hand on his hip as he stared at me impatiently. “Check my jacket pocket then.”

With a groan, I reaching behind the driver’s seat, my hand blindly searching for the garment that had been tossed back there earlier. An “aha,” slipped out of my mouth as my fingers brushed against the fabric. I pulled it out and set it on my lap as I dug through the pockets. Finding a blue lighter, I snagged it.

The hunger that shone in Rudy’s eyes didn’t escape me as he watched me toss the bloodied police jacket back onto the seat. In all honesty, I forgot he had been back there for a second. He was sulking rather quietly. Rudy got a testing glance from me, telling him he was toast if he tried anything. I was about to grab the jacket back when Dustin cleared his throat restlessly. Making a mental note, I turned and threw the lighter out the window.

Davidson caught it and I continued to stare at him. He scoffed, lighting the cigarette in his mouth and taking a long drag. “You don’t get to judge me, missy. Not after the shit you put me through today.”

I rolled my eyes, mimicking, “you don’t get to judge me, missy,” like a toddler. Dustin blew me off and continued to happily destroy his lungs with carcinogen. I turned forward and crossed my arms into my chest, a box of lucky strike matches in the glove compartment catching my eye.

Without hesitation, I swiped the namesake and stuffed into my pocket. *Hope you miss these, sucker!* I thought, turning my neck to look out at the moon.

Claire de lune started playing again, causing the three of us to jump. “Shit, should probably answer that,” Dustin then threw his cig on the ground and stomped it out before getting into the liftback. He rolled up his window before digging his phone out of the center console. The soothing classical music abruptly stopped as he answered the phone.

“Jesus Christ, finally!” Jane loudly yelled through the phone. Dustin winced and pulled the phone away from his ear as he clicked the speakerphone button. “I was just about to send a unit out there to check on the two of you. Rudy escaped!

“Yeah, we know,” I said.

“You *know?!* what do you mean you know? I’ve been calling you nonstop for the past thirty minutes!”

“Relax, Jane, we got him. He’s sitting in my back seat right now.”

“Hi,” Rudy called out meekly.

“H-hi?” Jane responded. I could just visualize the confused look on her face.

“Sage is the one that got away,” I added bitterly.

Jane gasped. “What the hell happened out there?”

“A fight happened,” Davidson answered, “her and the revenant got into it. He almost killed her, but Hale talked him out of it. Then she got the upper hand while he was distracted and got away fast.”

“T-that’s okay,”she blurted out, “the vampire confessed. We have direct evidence! We’ll put out a statewide bulletin  and she’ll be in Winchester PD’s custody in no time. She’ll face The Court and the trial will be swift with what we got on her. A happy ending for everyone- well, except her.”

Dustin shot down Jane’s optimism. “We didn’t record it. There’s no proof.”

“Sage is gone and we have nothing on her to get her back,” I said solemnly, picking at the skin around my thumbnail. “Hell we don’t even know her real name!”

A tense moment of silence passed as Dustin and I stewed in our failure. A glance at the rearview mirror revealed even Rudy looked disappointed with himself.

“Then, there’s nothing else we can do about it tonight,” Jane said softly. “Let’s all just go home and recuperate. We’ll regroup tomorrow and figure out what to do from there.”

“Yeah, okay,” Dustin sighed, leaning back in his seat, “it has been a long day. I’m beat.”

A yawn escaped me. “Same. I’m ready to go home.”

A soft snore came from Rudy’s mouth, the excitement of the day finally catching up with him.

Dustin let out a breath as he leaned forward and turned his key in the ignition. He put his hands on the steering wheel before looking back at Rudy, “All right revenant, let’s get you back to where you belong.”

Dustin was about to hang up the phone on Jane when suddenly, my phone started vibrating. “Hold on, I’m getting a call,” I said aloud, perplexed. Who could be calling at this time of night?

I looked at the caller ID. It wasn’t any number I recognized, but it had a local area code. Something in my gut told me to answer it, so I did.

Before I could even get in a hello, an agonized scream erupted in my ear. I jolted up right in my seat, the fear in the person’s voice causing my adrenal glands to kick into overdrive. Whoever was calling me sounded familiar.

“W-what’s going on?” Jane asked, Dustin’s phone having picked up the scream.

Dustin and Rudy- now awake again- looked at me for answers as well.

“I- I dunno!” I said, straining my ear trying to decipher whose voice was on the other line. There had been a tense moment after the scream, filled with heavy breathing. It was labored. Like the very action of breathing was painful.

Suddenly, a ghastly moan echoed through my phone. “O-officer… please. Please, help me!”

My eyes went wide as the face and name belonging to the voice clicked in my mind.“N-Noah?!?”

“Who the hell is Noah?” Dustin questioned, a hint of jealousy in his tone.

“My barista!” I answered in a tizzy. How had he gotten a hold of my personal cell number?

Dustin stared at me like the confused Nick Young meme. “Y-you’re *what?*”

“Never mind that, now,” I said brushing him off. “Jane, can you get a location from this phone number and fast?”

A moment of silence passed as I awaited for the witch’s answer, the tension in the cabin rose as more heavy breathing sounded from my call. “Give it to me. I can get it to you instantly.”

I rattled out the phone number in a panicked breath. At the same time, a soft incantation came from the other side of Dustin’s phone. We had a location in seconds.

“The call is coming from Whispering Pines Highway just past the thirteenth mile marker,” Jane quickly relayed. That wasn’t too far from the warehouse.

Dustin nodded his head, knowing where to go. He threw the liftback in reverse, kicking up a cloud of dirt.

“We’re on our way,” Dustin said into his phone before ending his call with Jane.

“Do you hear me, Noah? We’re coming for you!” I yelled into the phone right before the call got disconnected. “We’re coming for you…” I said again in a whisper as Dustin sped off, turning on his red and blue lights.

We rolled up on an abandoned Jeep Wrangler. It was grey in color and pulled over to the side, engine still running. The lights and radio in the cabin were on but no driver was in sight. The passenger side door was wide open.

Dustin pulled in behind the Jeep. We noticed in the tree line a path of broken foliage. I haphazardly unbuckled my seatbelt and opened my door. Dustin followed.

Rudy looked at us disbelievingly, “You’re really just going to leave me in here?”

Dustin and I looked at each other before looking over at Rudy. “Yes,” we answered in unison before slamming our doors on him. He scowled at us through the window as we walked further into the woods to investigate.

I led the way, following the direction the tips of broken tree limbs pointed in as a guide.

“Maybe we should turn back,” Dustin grumbled after a stray branch whacked him on the nose, “we can gather a search party and come back better prepared. It’s a full moon and I don’t know if you noticed, but we don’t really have anything to protect ourselves with. There could be werewolves out here!”

“Calm down, Dustin,” I said behind me, braving further into the thick brush. “We’re not turning back.”

“Lucky, please,” he pleaded.

“No!” I snapped, stopping for a brief moment. Then I started walking again. The sound of our footsteps crunching on dead leaves filled the silence between us.

I was the one who broke it. “You heard how distressed he was. We don’t have time to gather a search party.”

“Be honest with me,”Davidson sighed, “why are you really determined to find this guy?”

“I- I know him, Dustin,”I started to explain, “He’s a good kid.”

He burned two holes in the back of my head with his disbelieving stare. I guess being partners for nearly a year meant we knew each other better than that. Detective Davidson had caught on that I wasn’t telling the full truth.

“And after tonight, I *need* to save him. *Save someone.* Who knows how many more people are in danger now because of me. Because of that psycho out on the loose.”

“Lucy,” Dustin said softly.

I wiped a tear from my waterline, trying to stuff that guilty feeling down into a box that would never see the light of day again. With a sniffle, I let out a small, pathetic, giggle. “You know, he asked me out on a date, but I shot him down. This is the least-“

A firm hand gripped my shoulder. At first I thought it was to comfort and reassure me, but then Dustin pointed at something in the distance and shushed me. Cautiously, we approached it.

At the mouth of a small clearing, the two of us discovered a trail of discarded clothes. It led deeper into the glade. At the end of the trail lied the shivering body of a naked man. He was on the floor, back turned to us, in the fetal position. What sounded like slight, heavy sobs filled the air.

I’d recognize that curly brown mop anywhere. “Noah, thank god we found you!” I exclaimed, running up to check on him.

As I approached, something in the air started to feel weird. Perhaps it was the fact that Noah’s sobs didn’t sound so much like that anymore. Instead, it seemed the boy had been suffering from a fit of laughter. “You stupid bitch!” He roared out with a cackle, continuing to clutch his sides as he laughed even harder.

“Never mind I take back what I said about him being a good kid,” I whispered, slowly retracting the hand I had outstretched, warily backing away. This wasn’t right…

Suddenly the laughs stopped. Noah picked himself up off the ground and turned. The light of the moon seemed to make his eyes glow ethereally. No, it wasn’t the moon. His brown eyes were literally glowing. They burned so bright they looked almost yellow. Instead of the usual innocence l saw in them, those eyes were dark, conniving, and evil. Noah flashed a smile, revealing two rows of sharpened teeth. “I knew you’d come.”

“See?!? *Werewolf!*” Dustin triumphantly motioned with his hands from me to Noah. Of course he’d been right. He always was.

As if on cue, Noah’s body started to wriggle and writhe as his skeleton began to rearrange itself. Those same pained groans I heard from the phone earlier came from his mouth as patches of fur began appearing all over his body. Noah’s hands morphed into paws as his jaw snapped and elongated into a sickening snout. The flesh of his lower back split open, making room for the section of spine that was pushing itself out, forming a rudimentary tail. In just under a minute, Noah had become a wolf. Not just any wolf, though. *The White Wolf.*

This whole thing had been a trap, and I’d fallen right into it.

“T-that’s him! My stalker!” I cried, biting my knuckles.

“What?!” Dustin asked, turning to look at me, then to the werewolf.

The White Wolf licked his lips hungrily as it stared at me. With a snarl, Noah turned to face the bigger of the two of us. Dustin.

I’d seen in his eyes how he calculated who the bigger threat was, and I didn’t like where this was heading.

The wolf dug his paws in the dirt like a horse and tensed his haunches. With a tremendous amount of power and elegance, he pounced, soaring through the air.

Realizing he didn’t have enough time, Dustin braced himself, putting his arms up defensively. I tried to jump and push him out of the way, but I was too late.

A howl of pain erupted out of Dustin’s throat as Noah’s claws sliced into his forearm, the momentum of the wolf’s tackle knocking them both to the ground.

Dustin yelped as he fruitlessly punched and kicked at The White Wolf as he continued to maul him. Who was quite literally tearing him to shreds.

I yelled at Noah to get off of my partner, but he just turned and growled at me. “Wait your turn,” the look he gave seemed to say.

My hands flew to my tool belt in an effort to find anything that could dispel the werewolf. My finger grazed my gun holster.

I could’ve emptied a clip into the wolf, but in my state there was a good probability Dustin would get caught in the crossfire. Not to mention the fact regular bullets were useless on werewolves- and my spare ammunition was in the trunk of the liftback. I doubted throwing silver handcuffs at the animal would do much other than piss him off even more.

What else did I have on me that could harm a werewolf? My wallet: definitely not. There was nothing in it. Taser: maybe, but I’d have to get close and run the risk of hurting Dustin even more.

Hope to save my partner was quickly fleeting as I patted my pants down for something, *anything.* That’s when the palm of my hand felt a small rectangular object. The Lucky Strike matchbook in my pocket.

Fire: yes.

I fumbled to get the matches out of the pocket. My hands were shaking and trembling so bad, the matchbook almost slipped out of my hands. Steeling myself, I carefully grabbed a match and stuck it on the package.

Didn’t light.

I tried it again, altering the amount of pressure on the match head this time. Still didn’t light.

Dustin, fighting for his life, looked over at me struggling. “Arghhh!” He screamed after his face had been scratched. “Get! Him! Off!”

“I! Am! Trying!” I shouted back, frustrated, still striking the match on the box. I felt a small tug in my gut. It was small enough to barely even notice it was there. Then a hot flash spread throughout my body. The sizzling sound of the match head burning was like music to my ears. With all my might, I tossed the lit match, watching as it rotated towards its target.

As soon as the fire made contact, the wolf’s pelt was engulfed in flames in an instant. Noah let out a pained whine as he jumped off of Dustin, rolling around in the dirt trying to put out the fire. No matter what he did that fire still burned. Like it was somehow enchanted.

The wolf cried out in a panic as it erratically jumped around trying to put itself out. Eventually the flames burned all the fur off and his joints were too damaged to move. With a heavy thud, Noah slumped over on the ground. After one last howl, The White Wolf’s charred remains stopped moving. It seemed the fire only went out after Noah had burned to a crisp. Wisps of smoke wafted off the corpse, the smell of burnt meat and hair filled the air.

“God damn,” Rudy said in amazement from behind me.

I jumped, turning around and throwing a defensive punch. Using his supernatural agility, Rudy narrowly dodged my surprise attack.

“How did you escape?” I questioned. It was then that I noticed he had something hanging from his mouth. It was Dustin’s bloodied police jacket.

“Wif dis,” Rudy said with a smile, pointing at the jacket. With a small slurp, he pulled it out of his mouth and folded it over his arm. “I heard a scream and came to help, but it looks like you had it covered.”

I was about to say something when Dustin let out a weak groan. I ran over to him. Rudy tried to follow but then he saw all the blood. He hesitated before walking back into the tree line. “I’ll just stay over here.”

“Dustin? Dustin are you alright?!” I asked, taking him in. His clothes were reduced to threads and he was covered in cuts and blood. His left eye was swollen shut and turning blue.

“I think-“ he coughed up a little bit of blood. Tears started to sting my eyes. “I think I prefer getting beat up by the mermaid.”

I stifled a laugh then a cry. “One, it was a siren. And two, you should see the other guy,” I pointed over to the singed lump a few yards away.

Dustin groaned as he slowly sat up and looked. “Phew,” he said looking back at me. His hand slipped on the slick grass, but I caught him this time.

“Are you going to be alright?”

“I’ll be fine. Nothing a good rest and glass of whiskey can’t fix.”

“Yeah, no, let’s get you to a hospital,” I said, carefully lifting him up.

“That’s probably a good idea,” he groaned, leaning on me for support. Slowly, the two of us started making our way back out to the road. “Is that Rudy?” He asked, watching the revenant walk on ahead of us.

“Yup,” I answered.

Dustin grabbed a hold of his side, wincing as we walked. “Do I even want to know?”

I pressed my lips into a thin line, imagining just the kind of damage Rudy had done to the liftback in his escape. “Probably not.”

Dustin then started to lightly chuckle, at one point going into a small coughing fit before taking a deep breath, the cold air cooling his burning lungs. “Welp, one thing is for sure.”

“Yeah, what’s that?” I asked with a breathy laugh, patting his shoulder.

“You’re definitely not a damn rookie anymore. You saved my life.”

A twang of guilt stung my stomach and I lost my balance for a second. “It’s my fault I had to save it in the first place.”

“Doesn’t matter,” he shrugged.

As we continued to walk all I could think about was my old partner. The one I had back in Chicago before joining the division.

The one I *couldn’t* save.

*Yes, yes it does matter.*
