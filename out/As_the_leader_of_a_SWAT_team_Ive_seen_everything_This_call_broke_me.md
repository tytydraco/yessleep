Let me preface this by saying I've never believed in the supernatural. I've always found ghost stories and horror cool and interesting, but I've never believed in it. Not until now.

As the leader of our county's SWAT unit, I have a lot of pride in my job. I've never had a call end in a shootout, never had to kill someone. Until yesterday. But you couldn't even call the thing I killed a person. That creature, that disgusting mutant, it simply causes pain. It had no emotion, no sympathy no love. Only bloodlust. But, I should start from the beginning. 

Yesterday started out as a normal call. Me and my team were dispatched to help take care of a barricaded suspect. Not a serious crime, he was supposed to appear in court for armed robbery charges (he posted bail) but didn't arrive. This is most of the calls we get dispatched to, nothing too serious like a mass shooting or anything like that, thank the Lord. However, when we arrived there, the house was decrepit. It had been obvious, to all of us, that no one had lived there in a few decades. The roof was caving in, the wood was completely rotted, and the door was so old and rotted, half of it had broken apart and now laid on the front porch.
"Damn, that's creepy as fuck." Lee, one of the officers on my team, stated.
"No shit, doesn't help that it's pitch black out." Robinson, another officer of mine, responded.
"Alright boys, let's not piss our pants, we aren't 7 years old. It's a goddamn house, grow up."
They both looked at eachother and shrugged, and we moved to the house. We split the stack on the front door. 
"Ready?" I asked.
"Ready." 
I don't remember who said that. We have five people, including me, on the team. This voice, I didn't recognize it. However, I assumed I was just hearing wrong, and I kicked open the door. That was my first mistake.

Robinson threw a flashbang in. We waited; however it never went off. We all lookrd at eachother, and realized there's only four of us here.
"What the fuck?" Robinson said.
"There's got to be a logical explanation, I'm sure. There's no way..."
I trailed off. I want to keep my team together, want to explain that this is normal. But it's not normal. Hell, even I'm scared at this point. But, I'm also the leader. I have to set the example. So we enter the house regardless. We scan the hallways, nothing. Then we look at floor. The flashbang is nowhere to be seen. "Jesus.," Lee muttered. "I've never seen anything like this."
"C'mon boys, focus up." we cleared the rest of the first floor, and I told everyone to fall in so we could move to the second. However, only Lee and Robinson came back. 
"Where's the other guy?" I said.
They looked at eachother and shrugged.
"Was it not only the three of us?" Lee responded
That's when I knew. I knew that thing was in control. I was now just a puppet on a string, and it was the puppeteer. 

Nervously, I took the remainder of my team upstairs. There, we found the rest of our team. What was left of them, anyways. Their corpses were torn apart, comparable to a 2x4 put through a woodchipper. The entire hallway was painted in their blood and organs, but one thing was missing. Their brains. Their scalps were cleanly removed, their skulls delicately cracked open, and their brains were nowhere to be seen. Robinson turned and started to throw up, and then I saw it. I saw it for the first time. That thing. It was a human body, sort of. It was naked, but it had no genitalia. It's legs and arms looked the same, all four of them ending it a point, like that of a freshly sharpened pencil. And it's face, oh God, it's face. It's face is carved into my mind. A disgustingly karge, uncanny smile, the ends of it's mouth reaching up almost to its eyes. It's gums were bloody, its teeth long and pointed, just like it's limbs. And it's eyes, it's big, black, long eyes, stretching from it's top lip to its foreheard. No eyewhite or iris, just a long, black void. It moved like a spider, it's limbs cracking with each quick movement. It sped over to Lee at an alarming rate and pounced on him, stabbing it's front legs into him and pulling them out through the sides. It repeated this over and over and Robinson and I watched in horror until Lee looked just like the other two officers; nothing but a pile of blood and guts. There was practically no flesh left on the body, it had been scattered across the whole room instead. Then, as the other two, it delicately removed Lee's brain, and ate it. It fucking ATE IT. Robinson pulled his service weapon, aimed, and shot himself. I was alone now, with this thing.

I ran, I ran as far into the house as I could. It wasn't a big house though, and I quickly reached the other end of the house. I ducked into a closet, hoping that I can stay hidden long enough to get backup. I tried my radio, nothing. Not even the static you usually have with a radio. Nothing. I realize now this must be some sort of pocket dimension? That's the only explanation I could possibly think of, anyways. I've never believed in the supernatural, but this has changed my perspective on everything. I'm sitting here now, writing this, hoping at least my service still works, or else there's no hope. No hope for me, or anything else possibly trapped in here. I hear the thing walk past sometimes, it's pokey limbs stabbing into the rotted wooden floors as it walks. I've never been religious, either, but I've been praying for the past 2 hours in here, because whatever this thing is, it's the amalgamation of all things satanic and unholy. God save us, God save us all.
