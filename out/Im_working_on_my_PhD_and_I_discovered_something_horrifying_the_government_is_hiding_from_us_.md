This might be my last post so please listen very carefully. It all started with a late-night breakthrough. I was deep into my third year of PhD research in biochemistry, my workspace a mess of open textbooks, scattered notes, and half-eaten meals. My project was innocuous enough: developing a more efficient method for protein synthesis. My advisor, Dr. Victor had high hopes for my work, and I was determined not to disappoint.

One evening, while running yet another round of tests, I noticed something odd. A protein sequence in my sample was behaving unusually. Intrigued, I began to dig deeper, running additional tests and comparing my results with the extensive database of protein sequences available to our lab.

What I found didn't make sense. The sequence bore a striking resemblance to a string of data in a classified government database I'd stumbled upon months ago while using a less-than-legal backdoor to access restricted scientific publications. At the time, I thought nothing of it – just a curiosity, a mistake perhaps. But now, the similarity was undeniable.

Curiosity and dread gnawed at me in equal measure. I spent the next few days in a haze, my focus shifting entirely from my original research to this new mystery. The more I uncovered, the more I realized that this protein sequence was part of something much larger, much darker. It seemed to be designed for a specific purpose, one that involved rapid cellular degradation and regeneration.

I couldn't shake the feeling that I was onto something big, something dangerous. My suspicions were confirmed late one night when I received an anonymous email. The subject line read: "STOP DIGGING." The body of the message was simple: "For your own safety."

Fear gripped me, but so did a relentless drive to understand. I continued my research in secret, using a personal laptop and securing my notes in an encrypted file. I discovered that the protein sequence was part of a larger project, code-named "Lazarus." Its purpose: to create a virus that could reanimate dead tissue, effectively turning corpses into mindless, aggressive husks. Zombies.

My horror grew as I pieced together the timeline. The virus was still in development, but tests had already been conducted. I found records of isolated outbreaks, hushed up as natural disasters or terrorist attacks. The government was playing God, and the consequences were unimaginably dire.

I didn't know who to trust, but I knew I had to act. I contacted a former colleague, now a reporter, and arranged to meet her in person. We agreed on a secluded spot outside the city, far from prying eyes.

I arrived first, the weight of my discovery pressing heavily on my shoulders. I waited, glancing around nervously, half-expecting a black van to screech to a halt and haul me away.

When my colleague finally arrived, I barely had time to greet her before the world erupted in chaos. A black SUV sped into the clearing, men in tactical gear pouring out. They grabbed her, dragged her into the vehicle, and turned to me.

I ran, adrenaline propelling me through the dense woods. Shots rang out, and pain exploded in my leg. I stumbled, fell, but managed to crawl into a hollow beneath an uprooted tree.

Hours passed in silence. I stayed hidden, fear gnawing at me. Eventually, the sounds of pursuit faded. I dragged myself to a nearby road and flagged down a passing car.

I’m writing this now from a safe house, using a burner laptop. I’ve sent copies of my findings to multiple trusted sources, hoping at least one will see the light of day. 

Days turned into weeks, and I became a ghost, constantly moving, never staying in one place too long. Paranoia set in; every stranger’s glance felt like a threat, every unexpected noise a prelude to my capture.

One night, as I was holed up in a dingy motel on the outskirts of a nameless town, I heard a commotion outside. I peered through the blinds to see the parking lot swarming with black SUVs. My heart pounded in my chest as I grabbed my laptop and bolted for the back exit.

I ran through the back alleys, hearing footsteps and voices behind me. I ducked into a narrow passage between two buildings and held my breath, praying they wouldn’t find me. I could hear them getting closer, their flashlights cutting through the darkness.

Suddenly, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from an unknown number: “North wall, now.” I had no time to think; I bolted towards the north wall of the alley, finding a small, hidden door. I slipped inside just as the agents rounded the corner.

Inside, I found myself in a dimly lit room. A figure stepped out of the shadows. “You need to stop running,” they said. “We can help you.”

I didn’t know if I could trust them, but I had no other choice. I followed them through a series of underground tunnels, eventually emerging in a safe house. They introduced themselves as part of an underground resistance, a group aware of the government’s experiments and determined to expose them.

For the first time in weeks, I felt a glimmer of hope. But I knew the danger was far from over. The government wouldn’t stop until they silenced me for good. I had to stay vigilant, keep moving, and continue spreading the truth.

I’m writing this now from yet another safe house, my location constantly changing. The resistance is small but determined, and with their help, I might just have a chance.

The government is closing in on me and I don’t know how much longer I have. The virus is still out there. If you’re reading this, remember: knowledge is power, and sometimes, it’s the only weapon we have.

Stay safe. Trust no one. 
I know they’re coming for me. I can’t stop them. But I can warn you.
