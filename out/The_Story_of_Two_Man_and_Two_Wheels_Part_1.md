**Ride safe**

**...**

Sam and I had been obsessed with bikes and racing ever since we were kids. We even built a tiny race track in our backyard. We had these wooden pedal bikes, and we’d race, fall, laugh… We always dreamed of touring the world on our motorcycles. We weren’t brothers by blood, but we were closer than any two brothers could be.

At sixteen, we got our first real bikes. Sam had his first crash just two months after getting his. I was always more careful, but Sam—he rode like he’d lost his mind. The crash happened when he tried to do a wheelie. He went down at a hundred on the highway, and a car nearly ran him over. I warned him all the time, of course. Not just me—his parents, his friends… I’m pretty sure he even broke up with a couple of girlfriends because of it.

That was why he ran away from home. His dad told him to sell the bike. I wasn’t there when it happened, but Sam fought back, and his dad gave him an ultimatum: sell the bike or leave the house. And well… you can guess which one he chose. He showed up at my place, saying we could finally live the dream we’d been chasing since childhood. Just the two of us and the world out there waiting. What could I say? That dream had always excited him more than it did me. My family… well, I don’t like to talk much about my family ties. Let’s just say we weren’t that close, and they didn’t really care when I left home.

So we hit the road together. Sam said we had to share our journey, that we’d blow up on social media. At first, we toured our own city, then the rest of America, and soon we went abroad. We met incredible people, had fun, faced breakups, accidents, unfinished stories… During our trip to Ohio, I met a girl. She was amazing. Not really into bikes, but she adapted to me while I stayed there. When it was time to leave, she even asked me to stay. Sam wasn’t the kind of guy who believed in love, but even he said we were meant for each other. I remember him leaning against his bike, a beer in his hand, staring at me under the setting sun.

“Why are you looking at me like that?” I asked.  
“You love that girl, don’t you?” he said.  
I didn’t answer.  
“You know, brother… I want your happiness more than anything. And when you’re with her, you really look happy.”

I could’ve stayed and been happy with her. Maybe… But Sam and I had dreams, and I had made him a promise.  
“I gave you my word, brother. I’m not going to leave it unfinished.”

Anyway… the past belongs to the past.

As we kept traveling and uploading videos, people got curious, and our channel grew. Within a few years, we had millions of followers across different platforms. With followers came money, and we upgraded our bikes. (I cried when I sold my first one—it was more than just a machine to me.) We stayed in better hotels, ate better food.

Sometimes we met up with our fans in the cities we visited. We were invited to motorcycle group gatherings. We even raced against other famous bikers from abroad. (We got into a lot of fights during those street races.) Once, we were invited to give a conference. We might’ve been good riders, but public speaking? Not so much. Sam and I basically stared at each other and at the 120 people in the room for three hours straight. Never got invited again. Pretty sure we never will.

We had become professionals. Those two kids with a cheap phone camera were gone—replaced by two men filming with the best 360-degree GoPros money could buy. And we loved it. Sam and I had made a promise: we’d keep doing this, no matter what. Whether it was herniated backs or shaky old-man hands, we’d keep going—or until the day we met God on the highway.

Once, I asked him, “What if one of us dies, and the other survives?” He told me if he died, he wanted me to keep going. And I’d want the same. But imagining the guy I’d been with all my life suddenly gone…

He was everything. Sam, my bike, our channel. That was all I had. After I left, my family never even called me. Maybe they were even happy their screw-up son was gone. But I knew who my real family was. Family isn’t always about blood—it’s about the people you feel at peace with.

Last August marked eight years with Sam on the road. Eight long years… So many new faces, new memories, new bikes. New scars… I remember when Sam broke his shin, and we had to stay in New Jersey for three months. Those were good times, beautiful times. But every good thing comes to an end. We just don’t like to think about it

We were halfway through our tour of Italy. It was a sunny day. Ducati, the pride of the Italians, had just launched a new model and we were riding back from the event. I still remember how much Sam loved that bike. He said that was one of the most beautiful death way in the world. And he wasn’t wrong.

On the way back, we decided to take a detour through a mountain road. It was full of sharp turns and steep cliffs—the kind of thing we were looking for. A bit of adrenaline. Our bikes were built for straight asphalt, so as long as we took the corners slowly, nothing would go wrong. We were climbing uphill. Sam was in front, I was behind, both of us on the single-lane road. Through the intercoms, we kept chatting. I was telling him about a famous ice cream place in town we absolutely had to try before leaving. Sam joked that if they gave us a “celebrity discount,” he was in.

Then, right after a bend, a pickup truck appeared in front of us. The road was too narrow, visibility too low to overtake, so we were forced to trail behind it for a long while, barely keeping our speed above fifty.

Sam… he was always impatient. He liked making sudden moves. I watched him squirm in front of me, revving his engine, flashing his lights at the driver, trying to push him out of the way.

“Take it easy, champ. Just hold on for a few more kilometers,” I told him over the intercom, afraid he’d do something reckless.

“Damn it, can’t this guy move a little to the right?” he growled.

“Sam, the road’s too narrow and we can’t see ahead. Don’t do something stupid, man.”

“Come on, Brian, when have I ever done something stupid on these handlebars?”

“Quite a few times.”

“You bastard, Brian.”

I chuckled, muffled through the helmet. I warned him again not to try anything, but in the end, his patience snapped. Before one of the turns, he gave the throttle a bit too much and edged left, hugging the far side of the lane. He was practically on the opposite shoulder.

“Sam, don’t do this.”

“I’m not a kid, Brian. I know how to take a damn curve.”

The moment he came out of the bend, he opened the throttle—and right before he did, he yelled:  
“Watch me, baby!”

I saw the oncoming car three, maybe four seconds before he did. Just as he opened the throttle, I screamed:  
“NO, SAM!”

His front wheel shot up into a wheelie as he came out of the curve, only to see the Fiat heading straight at him. He yanked the handlebars and slammed the front wheel back to the ground, but when it hit, he lost control. The bike wobbled violently. He couldn’t take the corner cleanly and slammed straight into the guardrail separating the road from the cliff. The bike stopped. Sam didn’t. He was thrown several meters forward and, before hitting the barrier, he… went over the cliff.

I remember my vision blurring with panic. I stopped my bike next to the wreckage of his, completely crushed at the front. The cliff dropped into sharp rocks and sea. I leaned over the barrier, screaming at the truck driver to call an ambulance, screaming Sam’s name so loud it deafened me inside my helmet. I thought the intercom was broken. I ripped off the helmet and screamed his name into the void below.

Then I saw it—one of his gloves snagged on a branch-like jut of rock. But Sam himself… he was gone. I couldn’t see him. I kept leaning, searching desperately for a way down, but the cliff was sheer. Without proper gear, it was impossible to descend. So I begged him to answer me. The entire time I waited for the ambulance, I begged.

I don’t know how long it took, but eventually they came with a rescue team. Within an hour, the police had closed off the road, cordoned the area, and the rescuers were lowering themselves down the cliff. I don’t remember how many times I told the story to the police, the paramedics, the officers… After an hour and a half, they finally found him. By some miracle, he had landed in a crevice in the rocks.

They told me to step aside. His condition was bad. A female medic held my shoulder, sat me down, and deliberately stood in front of me as they brought Sam up on a stretcher. I wasn’t a kid. I knew. I pushed past her—and when I saw Sam… God… I can’t even describe it. Every time I try, I relive it. The nausea, my knees buckling, ripping off my helmet to vomit. His body was broken, mangled. I was terrified to even get closer.

The medic guided me toward the police car to calm me down. I followed the ambulance. They took him into intensive care. The doctors said the chances were slim. Even if he lived, he’d be in a coma, or paralyzed, or tied to a ventilator for the rest of his life.

Sam… maybe he even prayed for that not to happen. Once, he told me he’d rather die on his bike than live broken. I had smacked his arm, told him to stop being dramatic. And yet, in that hospital corridor, I prayed. I prayed for anything but death. Wheelchair, coma, breathing machine—I didn’t care. Just let him live. Please, God. Don’t answer that stupid prayer of his.

But after two and a half weeks, his lungs finally gave out. They couldn’t save him.

I was sitting in the hospital cafeteria when the doctor approached. He didn’t say much, just whispered a few words in our language:  
“I’m sorry for your loss.”  
Then he walked away. He hadn’t even looked me in the face. Maybe on purpose.

I ran upstairs, asked the nurse, and she said the same thing in Italian:  
“I’m sorry. You lost your friend.”

Sorry.

The world was spinning. For the first hour, I couldn’t even grasp it. Every second I expected to wake up in a hotel room with Sam snoring beside me. And every second ended in disappointment. But deep down, I was sure. Sam wasn’t there. He’d never be there again.

The first week, he haunted my dreams. Sometimes begging me for help. Sometimes walking toward me, trying to kill me. Sometimes we just rode on as if nothing had happened. Waking up was the hardest part.

I went back to America—broken, empty, a wreck. It took me three weeks before I could even tell our followers what had happened. Because only then did I accept that Sam was really gone.

God… Sometimes I’d still call out to him, tell him dinner was ready. Sometimes I’d ask him a question. A few mornings, I even asked him where he put my bike keys.

“Did you steal my keys again, you bastard?” I’d laugh. But there was no answer. Just the voice in my head whispering:  
He’s dead, buddy.  
He’s gone.  
He’s dead.  
He’s just a dead man now.

And every time I heard it, it crushed me all over again.

We held Sam’s funeral in the town where we were born and raised. Just a week before the crash, we had talked about it, as if he’d known.

“What if you go before me? Where would you want to be buried?” he asked.  
I joked back: “Who says I’ll die before you?”  
But he didn’t laugh. He just looked at me, serious.  
“Probably where I was born.”  
“Yeah, me too. And if we’re stupid enough to die together, I want our graves side by side.”  
I didn’t answer. I didn’t want to think about it. I never liked thinking about death or what comes after. I was the kind of guy who lived in the moment.

“Hey, Brian,” he said.  
“What?”  
“If I go before you, promise me you’ll give me a proper funeral.”  
“Where the hell is this coming from?”  
“Shut up and listen. I don’t want it quiet and boring. I want bikes, I want noise, I want a whole damn choir of engines. I want it loud until the very end. Vroom vroom vroom…” He twisted his hand like he was revving a throttle and laughed. Even talking about death, he found a way to laugh.

On the day of his funeral, riders came from all over the city, even other towns. And just like he wanted, the bikes never stopped roaring until he was in the ground.

We even brought his wrecked bike. I’d had it fixed once we got back to America. It was the most precious thing I had left of him. One by one, everyone revved the engine for Sam.

And finally, I stood in front of it alone. No one else would ever ride this bike again. I leaned close, whispered so no one else could hear—just for Sam:  
“I hope you’re happy wherever you are, brother.”
