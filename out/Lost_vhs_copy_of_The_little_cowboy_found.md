Okay for people who don’t know what the little cowboy is it’s a cartoon children’s film that allegedly had real dead bodies in it, and for some reason nobody could find out who or what company created this alleged children’s film, and because of the ridiculousness of this urban legend nobody really knew if this was real or not

and quite recently I was at a pawnshop when I saw a strange VHS containing the words the little cowboy so I decided to buy it and basically share with you what exactly does filming and if these legends are true or not?

Edit: welp, the film does contain real dead bodies, and well I decided to dig deeper to find out who these dead bodies were, and well let’s just say this might just solve an unsolved mystery.

OK if you don’t know what this mystery is have you ever heard of the elementary school disappearance? Well, basically on February 23rd 1981 and entire elementary school including the staff disappeared, and nobody could figure out where they went

and well in this the little cowboy film I saw what appeared to be the face of one of the principal, with her eyes gouged out, and her jaw ripped straight off and well. I called the police and told him about this. I even showed them the VHS tape and well now the police have the VHS tape

Edit: OK I think some of you might be wondering what this animated kids film was about well A young boy from Texas had dreams becoming the greatest gunman in the wild West, so he decides to seek help from local Indian in order to learn the secrets of war and then a man in a black cowboy hat challenges the kid to a dual and the kid has to get help from the Indians again before they face off and when they do face off, the kid comes out on top and he he rides home to tell his mother everything

I mean yeah that doesn’t really sound like a kids movie hell, some pretty racist stuff along with a lot of drug references as if the dead bodies wasn’t enough for this movie to be not for children, which kind of makes it all more weird that this movie was even made for kids

Edit: OK I don’t know if you guys seen this on the news, but they mentioned that the VHS of little cowboy was found, and then stolen so either someone doesn’t want people to watch little cowboy my personal two guesses are either they don’t want people to see this movie because of just how horrible and awful it is or Two maybe they like committed the murders of the school people this is just a theory and if you know anything about what happened to this copy of the little cowboy could you please comment on this post thank you

Edit:OK this might be a little bit weird regarding my other a few updates but I got a phone call from what appeared to sound like one of the characters voice, from the little cowboy movie saying are you ready? Are you ready? I asked him ready for what and then voice actor I think said are you ready for the dual we’re going to have I’ll be honest here that was pretty confusing Kinda scared me, but just in case I bought myself a pistol.

Edit this is a little bit worse so I was sleeping one night and I had the strange dream of someone walking up to my house and it wasn’t me because for one they appeared to be a lot taller and they kept coughing and usually I coughed pretty softly, but they were coughing, ridiculously loud and well. When they guys in my house they were walking upstairs to my room and open the door when I woke up I saw the door open, but the guy not there. I locked the door that night can someone please help

Edit: OK this might be my last update but I got the same phone call from the same guy saying I’m coming over and over again I just told him what do you want from me immediately hanged up so I called the police and now we wait me and two other officers in my house for this prick to show up dear God, please save me
