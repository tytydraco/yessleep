When I was younger my life would be amazing I would just play with my toys eat and drink and watch TV I obviously went to school but I was 4-5 at the time but everything can change after one night the night started with my mother walking into my room and making sure I was okay which I normally would but when she left my room I had a sense of uneasiness and a minor sense of fear I was falling asleep when I thought I heard a growl we didn't have any pets at all so I lifted up my head and didn't see anything shaken up I laid my head back down when I heard 3 loud knocks above my head while hearing this I was really creeped . My mother has went to sleep a while ago so this didn't make sense . Then the loft hatch it was a pull down hatch with a ladder which would fall out swung open and began to sway left and right I was frozen in fear until my room began to shake I knew it wasn't a hallucination due to stuff falling off my cuboards everything would shake and I swear I saw a tall lanky dark figure with long fingers throwing stuff about so I screamed for my mother and it just stopped I remember her picking me up and holding me trying to work out why I was upset after about half an hour I eventually cracked and told her why I was upset and explained she had experienced similar experiences in the past but had attempted to convince me into believing it was a bad dream

 I had calmed down and the next morning I was still a bit shaken up but near enough back to normal just enjoying everything in life once more until I went to sleep I had put my toys in my toy box and was prepared to go to sleep I got into bed and my mother read me a story tucked me in and turned out the light then one of my toys in the box began to light up at the time I thought nothing of it but the light got higher and higher until it looked like it was touching the roof keep in mind this toy was a small Dinosaur what would light up if you shook it so in response I turned on my night light to see what was going on and the dinosaur was touching the roof floating and when I turned on the night light it dropped I noticed the loft hatch was swung open so as the curious child I was I stood up and wandered towards it when I got within a certain distance I heard the growl again this time coming from up in the loft I got chills down my spine and saw something what seemed like a hand slowly reaching out of the loft towards me the old decrepit loft always gave me the chills as a child but seeing this made me petrified I couldn't run out of my room because of a safety gate on my door to make sure I didn't wander away during the night so I sprinted into bed and hid under the covers I remember trembling as I could hear footsteps on my carpet out of instinct I began to scream again and it would stop as I heard the safety gate swing open but my mother noticed a trail of small foot prints  and some large dinosaur like prints in the floor also approaching my bed the feet resembled them of my toy but 10x the size.

My mother's response was putting a crucifix inside my room on the wall and the loft wall and the events stopped but scratches where found on the inside of the hatch and the walls me and my mother still sometimes recall this case of events many years later and it sends chills down our spines
