Being a trucker was never something I considered. But in those days, I couldn’t find a decent job with decent pay, and I had planned on doing it only for a few months before moving on to something better.

When I commenced, the routes were different each time. I was frequently assigned jobs that led to new locations, never the same ones twice. I was often labelled the human GPS, because I could remember long-distance routes with extreme precision, exact spots where the dividers were slightly broken, the exact number of gas stations along the way, exact tyre repair centres. You name it.

That was what I consider the golden time, because that was when I met Martin. He helped me a lot during my initiation as a trucker, especially when I was still learning the rhythms of the road and the unspoken rules that came with the job.

Martin was full of life and always cheerful. 
For every problem, he had a solution, and you could spot his smile from yards away.
Sometimes we’d happen to meet on a route, park our trucks nearby, and talk for hours about nothing in particular.
Cigarettes were his weakness. If he ever caught you smoking, he’d snatch one away and take enough puffs to leave you with nothing. That was the only thing I hated about him, though even that was in a friendly way.

Lately, I had been assigned a job transporting vehicles to the same location twice in a row. Since I was never a troublemaker, and I almost always gave my hundred percent, I was trusted more than most others. Martin was trusted just as much, which made things easier when we needed favors.

During my first time on that route, after paying the toll, I noticed something strange in the rear-view mirror. There was a brief flicker, as if something had flashed behind me, but I couldn’t see what it was. 

My eyes were mostly fixed on the road ahead, and I eventually shrugged it off as some kind of mirage.

The highway was surrounded by forest, with no restaurants, local shops, or even mobile towers nearby. To break the silence, I used to honk there, following the exact pattern of a song I loved. The isolation made the route uncomfortable, and Martin would often step in for me when he could. We’d exchange tasks whenever possible, and he had a habit of doing so before things went wrong, almost as if he sensed trouble ahead of time.

That time, Martin took the burden as usual. He said calmly that I didn’t need to worry and that he’d take the route for me, joking that I should keep the cigarette packets ready in the glove box. He laughed as he said it, like it was just another minor inconvenience.

It was a task exchange like the ones we had done before. I took his assignment instead, the one that involved going into the city, delivering a few goods, and returning without much hassle. It was easy work, and I didn’t think much of it at the time. It was the last time we exchanged tasks.

The next time I was assigned the same route Martin had been covering for me, I called him to ask if he wanted to swap again. He didn’t answer the phone, and when I tried later, it rang without response.
Around the same time, the company owner found out about our exchanges and immediately imposed strict restrictions on swapping assigned routes.

That made it my third time on the same stretch of highway. After a three-week halt between assignments, something felt off, though I hadn’t noticed it earlier. Perhaps I had been too anxious about finishing the job on time to pay attention to anything else.

There was a toll plaza on that route that I don’t wish to name. To an ordinary, worn-out driver, there was nothing strange about it at first glance. The wrongness was subtle and easy to miss, and it usually took at least two trips along the same route before anyone noticed anything unusual. 

Even then, most people wouldn’t, because whatever happened there wasn’t timed or predictable. It simply occurred when it wanted to.

The highway itself was mostly empty, and you could go minutes without seeing another vehicle. While the road was only four lanes wide, the toll plaza stretched across six lanes, wider than it had any reason to be. By the time you reached it, you were usually too eager to pay and drive off to waste time noticing details.

The problem was Lane 7. Sometimes it didn’t exist at all, and sometimes it did. It shouldn’t have existed on a six-lane toll plaza, and when it appeared, it formed right next to the sixth lane.

I was heading back towards home when I noticed it again. I had already driven past the toll plaza and was roughly two hundred meters away when I saw it in the rear-view mirror. Lane 7 was flickering, carving a way for itself where there had been nothing before, and the road beneath me began to hum in a way I could feel through the tyres and into my chest. Lane 4 flickered briefly as well before returning to normal.
I pulled the truck over and stopped.

Another truck approached the toll plaza on Lane 4, the same lane that had flickered moments ago in unison with Lane 7. From where I was, I noticed that the toll attendants didn’t seem to move, though I was too far away to be certain. As the truck drew closer, Lane 7 flickered once more before vanishing. I never saw the truck from Lane 4 pass through the toll. It was just there, static. I thought maybe the truck driver had been stopped for some violation.

That was the second time I noticed Lane 7, and I tried to blame it on exhaustion. I wanted to prove myself wrong, because it would have been easier to believe I was imagining things. That was also why I never mentioned it to Martin. I didn’t want to sound insane, and I was certain a carefree person like him wouldn’t believe me without proof.

The next time, it was raining heavily. I halted the truck at a lay-by and lit a cigarette before approaching the toll booth, deciding that I wanted to see what would happen if I paid attention. As I drove toward the third lane, the road began to hum again, subdued, but unmistakable.

That was when I saw Lane 7 come into existence out of nowhere. It appeared like a flickering tube light struggling to turn on, flashing a few times before stabilizing completely. It hadn’t been there moments earlier, just six ordinary lanes, and now a seventh stood beside the sixth, solid and undeniably wrong. I wanted to leave immediately, so I pushed the accelerator and entered the booth area of Lane 3.

At that exact moment, Lane 3 flickered in unison. The moment I entered, everything froze around me. The booth attendants froze mid-motion. I stared through the windshield and saw the rain droplets stop, suspended in place. All I could faintly move were my eyelids, while my vision began to fade.

Then everything moved again, and I entered an empty highway.
