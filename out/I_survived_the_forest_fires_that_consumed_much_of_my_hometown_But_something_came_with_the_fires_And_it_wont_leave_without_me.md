The blaze cut through the morning haze like a distended belly. A burst of shimmering orange consuming the dead trees and dusty foliage with an unremitting hunger. The air in front of my nose was all waves of wild heat. The scent of singed facial hair. Nostrils clogged with smoke. Tongue tasting gentle ash. That’s how it began.

The fires.

It was Hell opening its infernal maw and swallowing half of civilization whole—at least in this corner of Oregon. And after the fire, when everyone was still picking through half-burnt trashcans and bombed out house frames, everything changed. Maybe it really was Hell pouring its molten hatred into our realm. And while the gate was open something stepped out. I don’t believe in any of that. I mean…I don’t think I do.

But what I know is that something did come with the flames. I first saw it—what I assumed was a hallucination but later knew was real—while I stood and watched the grove behind my home screaming in fiery agony. The eyes were more like deep wells of black. Large, like dinner plates. Rather than having a clear pupil or even color, they were bottomless voids with no reflective properties. I felt myself sinking into them.

Then there was the shape of its head—like it was hooded or cloaked in a heavy mane of hair. Its body was less defined, a wriggling mass that vanished into the fire. At first I didn’t see the mouth, but then I noticed a third void growing beneath its empty eyes. It grew large, as though the creature were unhooking its jaw. I swear that blackness fell onto the ashy forest floor—like a vast doorway in front of me. I could have walked right in, swallowed whole by this otherworldly beast. Perhaps it would have taken me somewhere new.

The blackness of its gnawing maw was interrupted briefly by a strange, starry glow. The light was smeared like a nebula within that expanding space. There was a pull in my chest—almost irresistible.

I felt a pull at my shoulder. It was my father pulling me away, pushing me towards the luggage-laden car.

Two weeks passed before we returned. And when we did, like I said, everything was different. People started to pick up their lives, but soon enough I started to hear about disappearances.

There was Joe down the street who went outside one day to take out the trash and never came back. The ashen remains of a shoe was found in the gutter. A day later it was Marianne on Temple Ave. Neighbors said they saw her walking into the woods while removing her clothes. All that was recovered from a wide sweep of the area was a black sock sticky with sap.

Two days passed with growing paranoia. On Friday it was Theo, followed on Saturday by Ryan. A brief respite before things resumed the following Monday. Another missing. No clues save a warped silver necklace.

A community meeting was held with city council and the sheriff’s office. They were calling in extra officers from the neighboring county. But no, they had no reason to believe anything malevolent was going on. Of course we all knew that it was foul play. It had to be. Five people in a week. In a town this small?

It was no coincidence.

Another week and my parents were gone. I stayed with a friend—Phil—during those torturous days following the disappearance. It was like a waking nightmare–I began having hallucinations. At least I thought they were. I would walk outside and see a blaze engulfing the white firs behind Phil’s house. Standing. Staring. The heat beating against my brow. I say I think that these were hallucinations but I’m not sure. Sometimes I would look to Phil’s second-story bedroom window and see him gazing into the forest too, transfixed just like me.

It didn’t take long for things to get much worse. It was a Thursday evening–the sun hanging low behind the wooded hills, pushing out its final golden rays as dusk became night–when Phil lost it. I walked into the basement to load some laundry when I found in him one of the dusty corners. It was the sound that got me first. Flesh slapping against the bare stone floor. His toes. I could see his feet bouncing rapidly when I turned on the light. He didn’t turn. His back to me, still facing the corner, bouncing on his heels and then tapping each toe in turn.

I stood there silently, unsure of what to do. My hand was frozen next to the light switch. Slowly–so slowly, like the creaking of a broken clock pushed forward only by gravity–Phil’s head turned until I could see its silhouette over his shoulder. His lips fell into a harsh frown. And his voice was not his.

“Coming soon. For you. For me. Flesh torn from bones. Cartilage turned to a waxen mash. Blood boiling. Veins bursting. And muscles shredded to mist.”

His voice was husky, low and certain. It bounced around the bare room. Then. Then. Then he bashed his head into the limestone wall. I heard that first, vicious crack. Skull splintering into brain. But he kept going. Two, three, four times. Each impact a little wetter than the one preceding it. 

And then he was still again. His caved-in skull supporting his lifeless body against the wall. I was silent with shock. Immovable. But as his body began its wet slide down the limestone, leaving a snail’s trail of viscera behind, I took off. I ran. Up the stairs. Out of the house. Into the woods.

Sharp but brittle branches whipped against my skin, tore my shirt, snagged my hair. The brush was thick around my ankles and I nearly tripped several times. I refused to look behind myself, until the descending darkness swallowed Phil’s home. By the time I stopped, huffing and puffing, I had no idea where I was, nor any sense of direction. 

*Fuck, fuck fuck.* 

It was dark now and my heart was a raging timpani drum against my sternum. I heard the snapping of a twig behind me, but didn’t have the energy to sprint off just then. A heat radiated around my ears, along my spine. It was behind me. I knew it was. I could feel the whipping of flame along the nape of my neck. Something squeezed my shoulder and I screamed, tearing blindly off into the brush, wounds opening up as I rushed headfirst into skeletal trees and relentless weeds.

Then it’s a blur. All I know is that I woke up in a clearing on a bed of dead pine needles. It was dawn, the sun barely peeking through the trees. I pulled myself together and limped until I found a road. A kind motorist pulled over and gave me a ride to the nearest hospital. I didn’t say a single word the whole way.

So that’s where I am now, writing this from my hospital bed. I can look right out into the forest. I can feel it looking back at me. And I wonder…what now? It’ll take me tonight. I know it. If I grab a bus south, into the city, will I be safe? Or will it come for me there too?

It feels inevitable that it’ll find me. You can’t cheat death twice. All I can offer is a few final words of advice for anyone else who might find themselves hunted or haunted: Your flesh. It wants your flesh. Let it have it. And you’ll be okay.
