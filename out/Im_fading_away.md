I'm invisible and I need help. I just called 911, but I'm not sure the operator believed me. I hope they send somebody soon, because I don't want it to end like this. Come to the southwest corner of Mangrove Park, near the crosswalk. I'm not going to last much longer.

Two days ago, I went to a thrift shop to buy some cheap furniture for my new apartment. I had a bit of free time, so I walked around to see what else they had.

Near the back of the store, something caught my eye. Buried behind a few board games and puzzles was a shiny red button. I pushed some old junk aside and picked it up.

It was in perfect condition. The base was silver, and the button itself was a hand-sized crimson dome. It looked like the kind of button you'd use for one of those "repeat the pattern" games, but metallic and expensive-looking. Words were printed on it in bold black letters:

---

**MAKE A WISH**

**AND PRESS**

---

An interesting find, but I wasn't going to buy it. What would I even use it for? Maybe it was part of a game that didn't make it to the thrift shop?

So, not thinking about it too much or really caring at all, I pressed the button and said, "I wish I was invisible."

The words on the button faded away. I panicked, thinking I’d wiped them off, and quickly put it back. After looking around to make sure no employee saw me messing with it, I left and finished buying what I needed.

The next morning, I was invisible.

Waking up and not seeing your body is a terrifying experience. I almost passed out from the sudden rush of adrenaline when I looked down and couldn't see my legs swinging off the bed.

After I managed to calm down—and get used to the disorienting task of using limbs I couldn't see—I went to the bathroom mirror. *I can't believe it,* I thought. There was nothing reflected in the mirror. *That button was actually real?*

I had a brief moment of regret—I could have wished for something better if I’d taken it seriously. But the regret faded as my mind spun with the possibilities.

I started thinking about how I could use my invisibility. *Could I rob a bank? Spy on people? Steal anything I wanted?* Countless ideas, most of them illegal, went through my head before I finally calmed down and dismissed them. No, I'm not really that kind of person. Not yet, at least.

In the end, I decided to simply go out for a walk.

Being invisible is eerie. As I walked through the city, I felt like a ghost. Watching people live their lives without knowing you're there—even when you're standing right in front of them. I didn't touch or talk to anyone as I drifted across town. A single breath, lost in the wind as the hours passed by.

I was slightly depressed as I leaned over the railing, watching people on the beach enjoying the sunset. It felt like I could never again be a part of their lives. Like I would be forgotten by the world. *Is this what the rest of my life is going to be like?*

Later, when I got home, something happened.

I tried to sit down and sank halfway through the couch.

*What?* I tried again. My body fell through it, again.

From my chest, and spreading outward to my limbs, I was becoming intangible.

Not just invisible. Intangible. Gone. Like I was ceasing to exist.

This was horrifying and I didn't know what to do. I tried to sleep, hoping that my body might recover by morning. I couldn't sleep. *Is this going to get worse?* I thought. *If I completely disappear, will I die?*

I've been awake since last night. It's definitely getting worse, and I can't find a way to fix it. I have no choice but to tell people what happened, even if it ends with me getting kidnapped and used for experiments.

The police are here, responding to my 911 call, and I can see their cruisers. They're driving around the block, but they can't see me. Their flashing lights are passing right through my body as I look on helplessly.

I can't shout to tell them where I am, because my throat is gone. I can't speak.

My hands, feet, and head are the only parts of my body that exist in the world now. I don't know how much longer I have before nothing is left.

I'm scared.
