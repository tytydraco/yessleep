The rainforest is a lush, living slaughterhouse.

The animals want to kill you. The insects want to kill you. Hell, even *the humidity* wants to kill you. 

Borneo’s air is like breathing molasses. Felt like I was being strangled from the inside out that afternoon, heaving glass jugs filled with river water a mile uphill while forcing gulps of muddy atmosphere down my throat.

I tilted my neck up from the forest floor. Murky sweat dripped down my forehead, curling over my lashes and stinging my eyes.

Ahead, sunlight glimmered through tiny slits in a line of tall brush. I spat on a piece of rotting bark, imagining it as Omar’s face. He *knew* I despised water duty; the task was redundant. Dehydrating myself to death’s door for a sip of river water in the goddamned *rain*forest. The irony felt suffocating, but if irony was truly keen on being my killer, it would have to get in line behind everything else. 

I bounded up the incline and pressed through the brush. Waxy leaves patted my exposed back, welcoming me home. 

Beautiful, flat earth. 

The jugs fell from my calloused hands, and I collapsed along the village outskirts. My ankles moaned with relief. Panting like an old steam engine, I rested my face in my palms and let the world go black. A roll of distant thunder muffled the humming of conversation at the nearby marketplace.

I sighed. No time to rest. Rain was coming. Rain was *always* coming. 

As I lurched to my feet, something small caught my eye: a walnut-sized bud peeking out from the dirt a few inches in front of me. Its tightly twisted petals sported a strange mix of colors. Plum violet with swirls of bronze and scarlet. 

The sky darkened. Thunder crackled overhead, closer now.

I stared at the enigmatic bud, but no genus came to mind. Could something rise from this soil that I truly did not know? 

The clouds burst like an infected cyst, spewing a deluge. Rain pelted my body. The entire village scrambled to get inside.

*You know what? Fuck this climate, fuck this village, and, most of all, fuck Omar.* 

I sprinted home, drenched clothes slapping an irritating rhythm against my wet skin. Left the water jugs lying in the dirt. 

I would not be controlled. 

\- - - - -

*THUD-THUD-THUD.*

I shot upright. 

My mattress shook. The mosquito net hissed with each violent shudder, shaking free a cascade of startled insects from the hanging mesh. Early morning light streamed in from the cracks in my thatched roof. I slipped on a pair of socks and shoes, pulled the net loose, and rolled out of bed, still slightly drunk from the night before. The drumming of rain and the buzzing of mosquitoes threatened to split my throbbing head in two. 

*THUD-THUD-THUD.*

“Jesus, I’m coming!” 

I yanked the door open. Our village’s de facto leader loomed on my porch, statuesque and grim.

“The hell’s got you riled, Omar? If your stomach’s still in knots, I taught you where to pick the Tamarin...” 

“You need to see something.” He reached a meaty paw towards my wrist. I retracted my arm before he could grab it.

“Don’t - “ I shouted, quickly lowering my voice as his stony eyes narrowed, “ - just give me a minute. Please.” I threw on my poncho and followed Omar into the downpour. By the time we arrived at the village outskirts, the rain had stopped. Our weather was a moody God. The sky was quiet now, sure, but as far as we knew, the next hour might bring a tempest.

Easy come, easy go.

He led me over to a crowd of laborers: men late for their shift at the palm oil plantation, rendered dumbstruck by what they’d discovered on their way out of the village. Omar’s mere presence parted them like Moses and the Red Sea, unveiling the spectacle. 

My jaw fell slack. 

The men stood reverent around a familiar purple bud.

It had somehow grown to the size of a truck tire overnight.

Beads of moisture dripped down six massive petals, which furled delicately to a unified apex. I crept closer, past the men, past Omar, close enough to touch it. 

“What is it, Nadia? Any use in letting it grow?” he grumbled. 

I pulled my poncho’s hood down to my shoulders and knelt beside the bud. It carried the biologic hallmarks of a corpse flower - the vascularity, the lack of obvious roots or stems - but without its namesake stench. This thing was odorless. 

“It’s...well...some sort of corpse flower, I think...” 

A snide chuckle spilled from Omar’s stone lips. 

“Helpful. Real helpful,” he replied, patting me on the head. “Well, I hope you all are satisfied: she doesn’t know. Let’s prune the damn thing.” 

One of the laborers lifted an axe. The others stepped back, moving out of the trajectory of his incoming swing. Bitter heat swelled in my chest. As the blade descended, I leapt up, shielding the corpse flower with my body. 

“No! Don’t!” The axehead stopped inches from my shins. An uproar exploded from the laborers. Omar’s voice cut through the mayhem. 

“What *exactly* is your malfunction, hag - “ 

“It could be very, very valuable!” Yells turned to whispers turned to silence. The laborers looked around the circle, each gaze eventually landing on Omar. Their eyes were wide, hungry, seething with greed’s bloodshot shimmer.

“The flower looks...I don’t know, prehistoric? A specimen mainlanders might be willing to...you know, empty their wallets for. The crown jewel of some new museum exhibit.” These claims weren’t *necessarily* dishonest, but I was intentionally omitting something. 

My gut told me this flower was death.

I ignored that intuition. 

If Omar believed it should be excised, it needed to stay. The bastard *had* to be wrong.

His humiliation was the only thing that mattered. 

Our leader spun around, pivoting his head, taking stock of the voracious stares fixed on him. 

“Really? This - this *thing* \- doesn’t strike anyone else as...unnatural? Godless? I have faith in Nadia’s...horticultural insight...but are we really going to jeopardize our safety for something she can’t even name? I mean - “ 

The bud emitted a faint, fibrous sputter: a sound like thousands of microscopic joints cracking in unison. I turned around. The tips shuddered open. Puffs of yellow mist wheezed from its peeling apex. 

I held my breath. 

Death bloomed. 

Six petals fell limp, revealing a fleshy center, wet and boiling, black like oil, which emanated a wave of invisible pressure that launched us into the air. My body somersaulted. Screams blipped in and out of focus. Falling, I tucked my knees to my chest. A wall of sulfurous dust erupted from the yawning corpse flower, chasing me through the atmosphere.  Grainy friction crawled over my skin, drying my mouth, burning my eyes. Tears streamed down my cheeks. I slammed my lids shut. My flank collided with sodden dirt. Stabbing pain exploded across my left side, reigniting every time my body completed a revolution over the unforgiving ground, again, and again, and again.

Gradually, the world slowed to a stop. 

I tasted hot blood and damp earth. My eyelids creaked open. Clouds gathered overhead. The colors were strange at first. Not black, but brownish-gold, with speckles of crimson and mauve. Some of the clouds seemed to blink in and out of existence without warning: there one second, gone the next. A hacking cough bubbled up my throat. Small puffs of sun-colored dust spilled from my bleeding lips with every wheeze. The spasms eventually forced my eyes closed. 

When I was able to look again, all I saw was a black, jagged storm-front. 

Rain was coming. 

Rain was *always* coming. 

\- - - - -

“My lord - anybody seriously hurt?” Eli asked, back turned, stirring a pot of soup. 

“Eh, a few broken ribs, some cuts, some bruises - nothing a little Gada and Betel Leaf wouldn’t fix.” A burst of lightning flashed through a nearby window, aggravating my concussion, causing my skull to pulse. I massaged the back of my neck. The muscles were like hardening cement under my fingertips, rigid and obstinate. 

I sniffed. The kitchen smelled of dew and ozone. 

“What’s for dinner?” 

“Soup - and the corpse flower?”

I sighed. 

“Deceased, sadly. Cleaved at the base and buried by the river. They refused to let me dissect it. A crying shame. Not every day something old and forgotten blossoms like dynamite in front of our eyes.”

My husband didn’t respond. Just kept stirring the pot - *clink, clink, clink.*

He was never the best listener. 

“Alright, well, enjoy your soup, I guess. I’m turning in. Too nauseous to eat anyway.” I pushed my chair from the kitchen table, stood, and lumbered into bed, pulling the mosquito net around me. 

Sleep came easy. 

Got a few hours of rest before the howling started. 

You need to understand: Borneo thrives within a ceaseless cacophony.

Millions of crickets scrape their spiny legs, blanketing the forest in a harsh, atonal symphony. Geckos yip and bark like lost puppies. Tree frogs call through the darkness, a high-pitched alien melody that can seem to come from everywhere at once. So overwhelmingly vibrant, so incomprehensibly alive; Borneo pulls insanity from the unprepared. After all, insanity drags men deeper into the forest, where they are likely to die, where hungry soil waits to claim their rot. 

I have slept soundly through thousands of Borneo nights, unbothered. 

The howling nearly broke me. 

It started as a distant whistle. My eyes burst open. I laid awake, listening, attempting to rationalize the noise. Was it birdsong? No, it was too consistent. Birdsong is musical; it glides through a scale. This was one continuous note. Piercing. Frayed. Almost metallic sounding. 

Well, whatever it is, it's far away - I reassured myself. 

On cue, the noise barrelled through the forest at an impossible speed. Barely audible to deafeningly close in less than a second. The pitch seemed to balloon, from shrill and pointed to deep and booming, rattling the walls, shaking the bones within my skin. I tumbled from bed, heart battering my sternum. The mosquito net became tangled around my body. I thrashed against my cocoon, clawing and tearing at the mesh. The howling swirled through the atmosphere. There was unfathomable suffering buried in the noise. I could feel the agony in my marrow. 

The fabric ripped.

I surged onto the floor chest-first with a *thump*. In an instant, the atmosphere cooled: no more whistling, no more howling, just my labored breaths with the pitter-patter of drizzling rain in the background. Borneo had never been quieter. 

Jittery hands pushed my vibrating body upright. I scuttled backwards, yelping when my shoulders thudded against the bedframe. The invading darkness was thick and blinding. I could barely see a foot in front of me. 

A crack of lightning split the sky, bleaching my home with brilliant phosphorescence. 

He’d been there the entire time. 

Eli was standing across the room, completely still, peering into the forest through an open window. The lightning faded. His silhouette was swallowed by a curtain of night, slowly, gradually, inch by inch. 

Blinded once more, I felt my heartbeat pulsing in my teeth. 

“They’re outside, Nadia," he said.

"Amongst the trees. Watching.” 

His tone was low and matter-of-fact. I couldn’t tell if he sounded impossibly far away or uncomfortably close to me. 

“W-who?” 

Silence. Pure, unfettered silence. Even the rain was gone. 

“Eli...who’s out there?” 

Distant thunder bellowed. 

He spoke again.

“We need...we need to move further into town. Away from the forest.”

Heavy footfalls echoed across the floorboards. 

“Away from the forest.”

Hinges creaked as the door swung open and shut.

“Away from the forest.” 

He kept repeating that phrase as he ran: "Away from the forest, away from the forest, away from forest..." A perfect loop that became softer, and softer, and then it was gone, too. 

Leaving me alone with the watchers in the forest. 

\- - - - -

A few hours passed. I couldn’t find the courage to follow Eli, not until the sun rose. 

With dawn at my back, I laced up my boots, crept out the front door, and began plodding down the dirt road towards village center. The ground squished loudly under my feet. After the howling, ambient sound had not returned to Borneo. The insects, the frogs, the reptiles - they’d all been stricken mute.

Shacks grew more clustered along the roadside, but there was no activity, no hustle and bluster of people attending their duties. Had there been a grand exodus? Were they all inside, hiding from something?

Halfway there, I stopped.

There was an old woman looming in the middle of a backyard garden. A watering can hung loosely from her wrist. She had her back to me, facing the forest. Purple orchids and red hibiscus flowers wavered in a gentle wind, brushing against her legs, pleading for her to wake. Did I know her? Couldn't tell. I craned my neck, attempting to determine what the woman was staring at, searching the trees and the canopy for *them* \- the watchers that Eli was so terrified of. There was no movement; just dense overgrowth, same as always. I tiptoed past the inert woman, taking care to hush my breathing. 

A concrete overcast gathered overhead. Dawn’s light dimmed. Nearing the marketplace, I wanted to shout Eli’s name, or scream profanity at the storm-front, or weep a bevy of convulsive sobs - something, anything, I desperately craved noise. The silence was more suffocating than any amount of humidity. 

I turned the corner. My guts clenched.

They were all there.

Hundreds of people, sitting silently in rows of perfect, concentric circles, gazing up at a single focal point: a man. The hems of his robe billowed angelically in the wind. The fabric was dyed the color of an amethyst: bright, seething indigo. He was facing away from me, towards the river, both arms curled in a “U” shape over his head, palms latched to opposing elbows. 

A distinctive mound of pale flesh slithered up the back of his neck. I’d recognize the scar anywhere. 

Omar. 

A wail soared up my throat. Before it could sail from my lips, someone slapped their hand over my mouth and dragged me back. I flailed, kicking into the dirt, sinking my teeth into the assailant's thick knuckles. They didn’t flinch. We rounded the corner. The hypnotized civilians disappeared from sight. 

“Nadia! For the love of God, quiet down,” a male voice whispered. 

My eyes bulged from their sockets. It didn’t make sense. It wasn’t possible. I stopped thrashing. After a moment, they released me. Bile lashed my tonsils. Acid dripped across my tongue. I spun on my heels, turning slowly, fearing the truth, doubting my senses, doubting everything. 

And yet, there he was, waving me forward, statuesque and grim. 

Omar. 

Immediately, he seemed to register my panic. 

“I know. Nadia, please, that...that’s not me.” Without breaking eye contact, the man reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a handful of something. The objects rattled in his closed palm, clinking like marbles. 

“Omar...w-what’s...where’s Eli?” As I spoke, he began transferring the objects between his hands. I caught glimpses as they tumbled from palm to palm. They had the glossy, wooden sheen of rosary beads, but they were rounded at the ends, shaped almost like tiny lemons. 

He furrowed his brow. 

“Who’s Eli - “ he started, but in the blink of an eye, his expression snapped to one of recognition. His facial muscles did not move - the change was immediate, instantaneous, impossible. 

“Oh! Eli? He’s back the other way.” 

“No...” I muttered, attention darting between Omar and the beads. He curled his lips, leaning back, pressing his closed palms to his stomach. 

What *were* these things? 

Why was he coveting them? 

And was anything he said the truth?

I slinked forward, widening my stance. Figured I’d lunge for his balls or eyes. Incapacitated, potentially maimed, he’d give me the truth.

The location of Eli. The beads.

I wanted the beads.

All of them.

The color drained from his face. 

Omar leapt around and bolted into a nearby alleyway. In his haste, a dozen or so beads slipped from his hands and fell to the earth. I wasted no time collecting my spoils, plucking the burgundy-tinted trinkets from the soil and shoving them in my pocket.  

I stood tall, puffing my chest, smiling.

Thunder crackled overhead.

A hacking wheeze erupted from my lips. I bent over, coughing into my hand until the spasms ceased. I lifted my head, groaning. My gaze drifted to my palm. I cocked my head and rotated my wrist. From one angle, my skin appeared coated in a fine, yellow dust. At another, my skin seemed clean, dustless. It was like an optical illusion. Phantasmogoria. A cruel, cruel trick. 

I shot upright. My heart tumbled through my abdomen. 

Omar was a large man. A veritable behemoth. Why would he run from me? He wouldn’t run from me. 

Body tense, limbs shaking, I slowly peered over my shoulder. 

They were there. 

Only feet away. 

A congregation of human sculptures, hundreds strong, motionless, all but one facing away. 

The man in the violet robe stood slightly ahead of his parish. 

The front of his body was concealed behind a smear of bubbling, jet-black liquid. The oil dissolved his skin. His skull was visible through the oil, as were his heaving ribs, as was his thrumming esophagus. 

A web of lightning flashed through the sky, blinding me. 

After a second, my vision focused. 

They were all a few steps closer. 

I turned and bolted through that same alleyway, headfirst into the overgrowth. 

\- - - - -

Each night, the howling would torment me.

The hellish clamor drove me from my hiding places, into the open, where the watchers prowled. I’d bound through the forest, my path guided only by slivers of pale moonlight, and they’d be there. Sometimes a few, sometimes hundreds. Fixed in place. Rooted to the earth. Turned away but in pursuit. Around every corner, waiting for me, always waiting for me. 

I’d sleep during the day.

If I couldn’t sleep, if the coughing kept me awake, I’d try to piece my mind back together. 

Where did this start? 

Why is it happening? 

How could I find my way out? 

Clarity - that word was a beacon. I concentrated on it, kept repeating it in my head.  

One day, it worked.

*Clarity, clarity, I need clarity...what helps with clarity?*

*Gotu Kola is good.*

*Turmeric and Tongkat Ali are better.*

I found turmeric first.

Yanked a waxy stem from the ground, revealing a cluster of yellow-brown bulbs. Ecstatic, I reached out and grabbed the roots. 

My elation faded.

It didn’t *feel* right. Turmeric is firm, moist, and sticky on the inside. These roots felt limp and parched, yet, when I looked, my hands were stained golden yellow, exactly as they should be. 

Why?

The corpse flower was toying with me. 

For whatever reason, I could trust my hands, but not my eyes. 

It was a grueling process, fumbling around the jungle floor, guided only by the feel of my home soil and the things that grew from it, but eventually I had what I needed. 

Somehow, the medicine worked.

Little by little, the howling vanished, and the watchers disappeared. 

A week later, I returned to my village to bear witness to my people's end.

Outside the marketplace, their rotting bodies were arranged in concentric circles, faces to the dirt, tethered to the still living corpse flower through a vast network of black, fleshy roots. I dug up the hole where we *believed* we buried the damn thing, only to find Omar’s decomposing head, his scar still vaguely appreciable. 

An optical illusion.

A cruel, cruel trick.

Without ceremony, I burned it all to the ground. A beautiful, cleansing fire, liberating the souls of my people, torching that hellish thing, roots and all. 

Watching it all burn, feeling the heat in the air, I experienced something odd. I had a tough time putting a name to it initially, but I think I've figured it out.

Pride.

A feeling of pride bloomed in my chest.

Above all,

I would not be controlled.

\- - - - -

I’m on a bus to the mainland now. Sorrow hangs heavy in my heart, but, all things considered, I’m optimistic. 

You see, all isn’t lost.

Turns out Eli survived as well.

He’s sitting a few seats ahead, facing away from me, eyes glued on what will be our new home soil.

My cough remains, sure. I won’t deny it’s painful. Whenever the pain becomes too great, though, I just thumb the beads in my pocket. They’re warm to the touch. That warmth calms me. It's a reminder of my pride.

I think I’ll bury them when we get there. Seeds to start our new, radiant life.

Our life away from the forest. 

Away from the forest.

Away from the forest.

Away from
