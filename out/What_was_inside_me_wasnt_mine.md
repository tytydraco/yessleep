The beast disappeared into the dead of night, but I knew it would never leave me alone. 
I was now marked.

“And Done!”

The tapping on the keyboard silenced as Maya submitted the final chapter of her horror book to her editor.

“Ahh.” She stood up and stretched. “Nightfall already.” 

She takes a step out onto the cabin front porch. 

The stars were bright and the forest was alive and filled with chirping, croaking, and the occasional snapping of branches. 

“What was that?” She looked in the direction of the sound but saw nothing but forest trees and shadows.

An eerie chill breathes past her causing her to shiver and return back indoors. 

With her six week solo writers retreat coming to an end and the completion of her horror story. Celebrating with wine seemed like the perfect ending. 

As she poured her wine into her glass and picked it up to drink she noticed her breath fogging the glass. 

When did it get so cold in here? 
She frowned, rubbing the goosebumps on her arms as she walked to the thermostat. 

It was still on the same temperature as before.

Maya doesn’t ponder anymore about the occurrence, only leaving bookmarks in her head of what to tell the cabin owner about.

Besides she has written worse things than a cold spot in a cabin. 

After a few glasses of wine and a buzz later she decided to get up and take a shower.

The steam filled the bathroom, fogging up the glass shower and the mirror above the sink.

While washing her hair, there it was again—. 
The cold eerie chill.
 
Only this time it felt close, like breath on her neck. Causing the hairs on her arms and the back of her neck to stand. 

Shivering and submersing her body under the hot water she walks to the glass and swipes her hand across to peek out. 

Empty…

“Get it together Maya.”  She shakes the feeling again. “Writing all of those horror stories is starting to get to me.”

Then quickly she turns the shower off and gets out wrapping the towel around her body.

Before exiting the bathroom she noticed what looked like a giant handprint on the glass shower. 

“Perhaps writing a horror novel in a creepy cabin in the woods has taken a toll on my mental.” 

After allowing the rest of her body to air dry she climbs into the cool sheets covering herself up. 

“After tonight it’s back to the city. Fast living, loud noises, and deadlines. Maybe I won’t concentrate so much on horror this time.” She mumbles to herself while lying in the dark. 

The sounds of crickets chirping, croaking, and winds brushing past the cabin’s outer walls quickly lulled her to sleep. 

While she slept she heard them—.
Heavy, slow, intentional.
Footsteps in the kitchen.

Each step becoming louder and heavier as it made its way towards her bedroom door. 

Thud Thud Thud. 
Closer—.

Fear jolted her awake but when she looks in the direction of the open doorway there is nothing there. 

”Ugh!” Maya sucks her teeth as she lays back onto her pillow and shuts her eyes again. 

But was she asleep? 

She was lying on her back, her eyes were wide open, but she couldn’t move. 

Couldn’t speak, couldn’t call for help. 

Then it appeared from the darkness. 

Maya’s breathing became heavy ladened and she could feel her pulse rising.

This moment felt like an eternity. 

The thing—the beast—was huge!

I bore the head of a ram, the body of a man, and hooves for feet. 

A satyr?
Krampus?
Forest creature folklore?

Maya has written about them all.

But this—. This was…

The thing stared at her from the doorway with its red eyes. 

She held her breath, while also trying to squeeze her eyes shut but could not.

As her heart rate seems to raise and drop due to the rise in fear and stress The footsteps of the beasts feet quicken louder.

THUD THUD THUD! 

Maya fights to turn her head even an inch to look at the beast up close, only managing to look at it out of the corner of her eyes. 

She could feel herself trying to will her body to move, pinching herself to try to wake up but nothing was working. 

Then it happened. She felt it—. 

The tongue.

Cold. Slimy. Wet.
Slithering slowly to her left ear.

Maya couldn’t scream, she couldn’t move, not even blink.

All she could do was lock eyes with the entity invading her mind, her body and her spirit.

It invaded her, slithering in impossibly long— breaking through her ear drum, into the nasal cavity.  And down into her mouth. 

It continued down her throat, chest before setting her stomach on fire. 

Finally her body broke free from its prison.

She shot up, gasping, and drenched in sweat. 

With no time wasted she runs to the bathroom and vomits up every bit of what she ate and drank before bed. 

While washing her face and her hands she looked in the mirror and it read:

“I liked what you wrote. So I decided to help you write a new story.” 

She grabbed her belly as her head spun.
