After my father's untimely death, I inherited the family home in the low laying town of Baguio, Philippines. The house, a full of childhood memories, and it stood silently. As I began the task of cleaning the old stuff hoarded in the old house, I stumbled upon a box of old cassette tapes, their labels worn.

I organized the tapes I had found, sorting through the unlabeled ones with a mix of curiosity and nostalgia. At 23 years old, I was quite fond of my late father, who had taught me what to expect in life. Some of the tapes were family home videos, clearly marked, while others were simply dated. I set aside the tapes labeled only with dates, feeling a rush of happiness uncovering this memento of my childhood, eager to uncover their contents.

Starting with the oldest recording, I smiled as my father's familiar, calming, and charming deep voice filled the room. It was like a warm hug from the past, a rush of comforting memories. As I continued to listen, the recording revealed my father's journey, searching for brave souls willing to share their stories about the recently ended martial law. He spoke of his goals, hoping to create a memoir or documentary to preserve these tales of resilience and courage.

*"Ini-ikot ikot ko tong Maynila para maghanap ng mga taong gusto makiparte sa gagawin kong dokumentaryo sa ika isang taon ng paglaya natin sa martial law."*

In English: "I'm going around Manila looking for people who want to be part of the documentary I'm going to make on the one year anniversary of our release from martial law."

I continued to ponder, trying to remember my late father. Back when I was a child, my father appeared so manly and brave, with a thick mustache and always carrying an old-style handbag, a recorder, and a small camera. He was a great journalist, I recalled, a bold character of a man. His fearless spirit and dedication to his work left an indelible mark on me, inspiring admiration and a sense of pride that lingered even now.

*"Medyo malayo rin ang aking nilakbay. Kikitain ko sa Miss Felicia ng Tondo," he said in the recording. “Ang inet grabe, sobrang inet talaga dito sa Maynila, Dios ko."*

In English: *"I traveled quite far. I will be seeing Miss Felicia of Tondo,"* he said in the recording. *"It's so bad (hot), it's so bad here in Manila, my God."*

It was just a normal recording. My father continued to introduce his mission for the documentary.

*"Ninanais ko talagang maisulat na agad ito dahil makakatulong to sa madla at sa susunod pang mga henerasyong malaman ang kalagayan ng ating mga kababayan sa kamay ng huling rehimen."*

In English: *"I really want to write this right away because it will help the audience and future generations to know the condition of our countrymen at the hands of the last regime."*

It cut short; the recording was just my father monologuing to himself. It continued with some other monologues, then it was just pure static sounds and some mumbled, disembodied voices that I thought were just other people in the background. The static hissed like a whisper, the disembodied voices weaving an unsettling tapestry of sound. My father's voice, from a comforting voice, now echoed with an eerie detachment, sound like he’s talking to himself with utter nonsense, he sounds paranoid. *"Ano to? Anong nangyayari?," ("What is this? What is happening?").* I whispered to myself. I smacked the cassette lightly to fix it. You know, the old smack and whack trick. My heart pounded in my chest, like a drum. The flickering lights of the cassette player became stagnant. The cassette player broke.

Hunched over the cluttered workbench, I wrestled with the broken cassette player, fumbling with the tangled wires and stubborn screws. The device had its battery attached, but it also had a power plug—one that, when I tentatively connected, promptly caused the lights in the room to flicker and turn off. It flickers inconsistently, then BOOM, a blackout. I sighed, annoyed. I shuffled over to the window to check on the neighborhood.

The scene outside was a bit chaotic. The streets were teeming with people, their faces etched with frustration as they complained about the sudden power outage. It was dark, yet it was just 6 PM in the evening. The air was thick with murmurs and curses, an unsettling symphony of confusion. My gaze landed on old man Ric, who stood on his balcony, his silhouette barely visible in the dim light. *“Wala rin kayong ilaw?” (Don't have lights too?")* Ric called out with his raspy old voice; his voice tinged with concern. I nodded in reply, trying to light a candle.

Just as the small flame flickered to life, the lights blazed back on with an unexpected intensity. The cassette player, now miraculously powered, roared to life with a startling crescendo of noise. The sound that erupted from it was nightmarish—an ear-splitting scream, followed by the sickening rhythm of something being hammered. My heart pounded in my chest as I dashed to the cassette player, desperately trying to turn it off. The horrid sounds only grew louder and louder, as if someone were screaming from the top of their lungs, more insistent, irritatingly. In a panic, I yanked the cassette player from its place and hurled it across the room. It shattered into pieces, the echoes of the ghastly scream still lingering in the air.

With the player now broken beyond repair, my frustration morphed into determination. I was still confused yet curious and would like to resolve and listen to the remaining tapes in chronological order, hoping to uncover some semblance of meaning or pattern. As I sorted through the collection, one tape caught my eye—a tape with its label completely erased. Every other tape was meticulously labeled, each one bearing a clear marker of its contents. This particular tape, however, stood out with its blank label, an omission that felt deliberately ominous. My fingers trembled as I held it, a cold shiver of dread creeping down my spine. It felt like someone was touching me lightly. I looked around but I was the only one in the room. What secret lay within this unmarked tape? Why was it stripped of its identity, and what did it hold? Now, I want answer, these tapes are kept here to not be found. I guess my father likes to burry these things when we moved to Manila.

The next morning, I was still haunted by the events of the previous night. My thoughts were a tangled mess of fear and curiosity. I decided to visit town and borrow my Aunt Nina’s old cassette player, hoping it would allow me to uncover the mysteries hidden in the tapes. After a brief, though unsettling, chat with my aunt, I returned home with the borrowed player in hand.

I set it up carefully, my mind racing with the possibilities that awaited me.

I plugged in the tape that caught my eye last night., the omitted label one. At first, all I could hear was heavy breathing, the sound unnervingly close and labored. Confusion and dread twisted inside me, growing with each passing second. Then, through the oppressive noise, I discerned a desperate, gurgling voice, *“tulo—” ("Help-")* It sounded like someone drowning, each syllable a struggle. *“Wala akong nalalama—” ("I don't know anythin-")* The words were abruptly cut off, leaving me in stunned silence. I recoiled as a horrifying realization dawned on me—this was a recording of torture. The tape cut short, but not before a sickening whack shattered the airwaves. And then, utter silence. I sat paralyzed, the weight of what I had just heard sinking in, a chilling unease settling over me like a dark cloud. **A TOTAL SILENCE**.

Then, for some reason, I blacked out. When I woke up, I couldn't feel my legs, my hands were cold as ice, and my sweat drenched my entire body. I couldn’t move, but my eyes were open, and I was fully conscious. I lay there for what felt like hours. Nothing crazy or mysterious happened during that time; it was just the excruciating stillness and the sound of my own labored breathing. Eventually, I regained control over my limbs. The first thing I did was to stay away from that cursed cassette player and tapes. I felt like they were haunted, but I couldn’t wrap my head around it. Despite my fear, a part of me was irresistibly drawn back to them, my curiosity gnawing at me relentlessly.

That evening, I tried to distract myself with mundane tasks. I finished cleaning the house, scrubbing every nook and cranny as if the physical exertion could expel the terror from my mind. Dinner was a solitary affair; the sound of the utensils clinking against the plate was the only noise that cut through the oppressive silence. I watched videos on my phone, but my mind kept drifting back to the cassette player. The screen's light flickered, casting eerie shadows on the walls. I forced myself to shut my eyes. 

The next day, the sunlight streaming through the windows felt like an intrusion into my dark thoughts. I never had dream that night, though it was the usual's. I forced myself out of bed, my legs still shaky from the previous night’s ordeal. The smell of coffee wafted through the air, a small comfort in the midst of my unease. As I sipped the hot beverage. Despite my efforts to avoid it, the pull towards the cassette player was undeniable. It sat there on the shelf, innocuous yet menacing, its presence a constant whisper at the back of my mind, like an earworm but instead of a song, a constant stream of nonsense. My fingers itched to reach out, to uncover whatever secrets it held. But fear kept me at bay, for now.

In an attempt to regain some sense of normalcy, I went for a walk. I sat at the bench near the plaza, I watch people passing by, then I closed my eyes. When I opened my eyes, I found myself sitting in a chair, staring at the cassette player and tapes on the table. I was back in the house. I tried to recall how I ended up here. *"Nagteleport ako?" (Did I teleported?)* I muttered to myself, trying to understand how I had returned home. For some reason, I couldn’t take the urge of playing another tape. I plugged in another one labeled "01-16-1986," presumably the second tape in the sequence. As I pressed play, the tape began with a thumping noise, like footsteps on wooden planks. The familiarity of the sound, eerily reminiscent of my own wooden floors, sent a shiver down my spine. For the next few minutes, I heard only the unsettling quiet and the monotonous footfalls, convincing myself it was just my father absentmindedly recording. Yet, something felt off. Though this tape was labeled later than the first, my intuition screamed that there was no mistake. The timing, the content—everything hinted at a deeper, more sinister truth. Each step echoed with a haunting presence, every second of silence heavy with unspoken dread.

I continued to listen as my father started to talk. *“—noong 1968 pa siguro iyon, kakagraduate ko lang bilang isang journalist, hindi ko pa alam kung anong gagawin ko–-”* The tape cut off, then continued with mumbles and inaudible words. *“—kasama ko nun si Ramon, kinukuhaan yung mga ralihista sa kahabaan ng San Rafael. Nakaupo lang sila, yung iba nakain, nagpapahinga at tirik sa sikat ng araw nang biglang nagsitakbuhan yung mga nasa unahan, kasi hinuli na pala yung ibang ralihista—nagsigawan ang karamihan, meron kaming nasaksihan na pinapalo ng baton. Kami, wala kaming nagawa kundi subukang kuhaan lang ang nangyayari. Wala kaming ibang magawa pero walang takot si Ramon kahit harangin na kami ng ibang pulis militar, sabi ko na lang, periyodista kami wala kaming ibang ginagawa, masama yung titig samin ng pulis, tapos may biglang humila samin, kala ko may mangyayaring masama sakin, halos magblanko yung paningin—”* Then the audio cut off for almost a minute before ending.

*(“—it must have been in 1968, I had just graduated as a journalist, I didn't know what I was going to do–-” The tape cut off, then continued with mumbles and inaudible words. "—I was with Ramon, photographing the rallyists along San Rafael. They were just sitting, the others had eaten, resting and standing in the sunlight when suddenly those in front ran, because it turned out that the other rallyist had been caught—the crowd shouted, we witnessed someone being beaten with a baton. We, we didn't do anything but try to capture what was happening. We had nothing else to do, but Ramon was fearless even when other military police stopped us, I just said, we are journalists, we have nothing else to do, the police gave us a bad look, then someone suddenly pulled us, I thought something bad was going to happen to me, my eyes almost went blank—")*

There was a heavy breathing, unmistakably my father's voice, each breath laden with palpable fear. It felt as if he was reliving a nightmare, the agony of a past trauma bleeding through every gasping breath. The voice that followed was exhausted, strained, teetering on the edge of a breakdown. It was the sound of a man haunted, someone on the verge of tears, suffocating under the weight of memories too painful to bear. My heart pounded as the realization hit me—I was witnessing my father's torment, raw and unfiltered, captured forever on this tape.

I froze, my breath catching in my throat as the realization crashed over me. I had never known, could never have imagined, that my father too was a victim, a silent sufferer of past horrors. The revelation cut through me like a knife, for he had always shrouded the past in impenetrable silence, never once hinting at anything that haunted him before I was even born. The weight of unspoken agony now hung heavy in the air, suffocating in its intensity.

With trembling hands, I picked up the next tape, its label barely legible, “01-16-1986 part 2” scratched into the surface. A shiver ran down my spine as I hesitated, then forced myself to press play. The tape whirred to life with a burst of static, crackles, and distorted noises, as if it were being fast-forwarded by unseen hands. Suddenly, a loud thud echoed through the room, making my heart leap into my throat. Then, amidst the oppressive silence that followed, came a faint whisper, barely discernible.

I stared at the old cassette player. The audio was a garbled mess, a faint whispering that seemed to slither out from the static. I couldn't discern the words—was it the tape, the age, or something more? The voice was unnervingly close, though it seemed to echo from inside my head rather than from the tape itself. It was as if someone had burrowed into my consciousness and was now whispering secrets I wasn’t meant to know.

The darkness in the room thickened, pressing against me, warping the edges of my reality. The tape crackled, its rhythmic hiss a maddening counterpoint to the unclear murmur. Each crackle seemed to punctuate a dreadful message, though I couldn't grasp the meaning. The silence between the whispers grew heavier, more oppressive, as if it were an entity in its own right, creeping through the sounds and closing in around me. My eyes darted around the room, straining to pierce the encroaching gloom, but the dark only seemed to deepen, coiling like a living thing. The whispers in the tape grew louder, intensifying, but still remained just out of reach. A chill swept through me as the voice, familiar and terrifying, became clear. It was my father’s voice—a ghostly echo.

Every crackle, every pause, every whisper felt like a piece of a larger puzzle I was desperately trying to solve, but the answer eluded me. The tape's eerie message sent shivers down my spine. I tried to turn it off, but my hands trembled uncontrollably, as if something unseen was holding me in place.

The voice, my father's voice, continued its spectral dialogue, relentless and haunting. It was not just a message from the past but a chilling reminder of something I could never fully understand. Then I snapped back to reality. I stopped listening, as if my body couldn’t take the horror of the tapes. *“Baka nag-i-imagine nanaman ako, this is just recordings,” ("Maybe I am just imagining, This is just recordings)* I said. I removed the tape from the player and started tidying the tapes, the surroundings cold but not empty. 

**THEN I HEARD IT AGAIN. THE VOICES.** The cassette is not playing anything. It is turned off.
