 

It was a dreary and turbulent night, and I was left alone in my house, huddled up on the couch with a gripping novel. All of a sudden, I heard a forceful knock on the door. I froze, wondering who could be knocking at such an odd hour. I was hesitant for a moment before gathering the bravery to go and find out who it was.

As I walked towards the door, my heart was beating rapidly in my chest. I took a deep breath and slowly opened the door, anticipating seeing a neighbor or possibly even a lost traveler. However, what I saw instead sent shivers down my spine.

There was no one there.

I stood at the doorway, gazing into the darkness, attempting to comprehend what was happening. I was just about to turn and go back inside when I heard a voice. It was a whisper, barely perceptible, but it was certainly coming from outside.

"Come closer," it said.

I experienced a sudden rush of panic and I stepped back from the door, my mind racing. What was occurring? Who was speaking to me? And why did their voice sound so familiar?

I turned and ran back to the couch, grabbing my phone as I went. I was trembling as I called the police, desperate to get help. However, as I waited for someone to answer, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was watching me.

I turned around, expecting to see a shadowy figure lurking in the corner of the room. But there was nothing there. Just the darkness and the storm raging outside.

As the minutes ticked by, I began to feel a presence growing stronger. It was as if something was inside the room with me, just beyond my sight. And then, I heard it again. That same voice, whisper-quiet but filled with malevolence.

"Come closer," it said. "I've been waiting for you."

I knew then that I had to leave that place. I grabbed my keys and ran for the door, not stopping until I had reached my car and was driving as fast as I could away from that haunted house.

I drove for what felt like hours, trying to put as much distance between myself and that haunted house as possible. My hands were shaking on the steering wheel and my mind was racing with questions. Who was that voice? Why did it sound so familiar? And why was it trying to lure me closer?

I knew I had to find out, but I was too afraid to go back. So I decided to do some research, hoping to find some answers. I spent the next few days combing through old records and talking to people who had lived in the area for a long time.

What I learned sent shivers down my spine. The house I had fled from was rumored to be haunted by the ghost of a woman who had died there under mysterious circumstances. Many people had reported hearing her voice, and some even claimed to have seen her ghost.

I couldn't believe it. The voice that had called out to me that night had belonged to a ghost. And now, it seemed, she was trying to lure me back to the house.

I knew I had to be careful. I didn't want to end up like the others who had gone into that house and never returned. But I also couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to the story, and that I needed to uncover the truth.

So I gathered my courage and went back to the house, determined to face whatever was waiting for me. And as I stood on the doorstep, my heart pounding in my chest, I heard that voice again.

"Come closer," it whispered.

But this time, I didn't run. I took a deep breath and stepped inside, ready to face whatever was waiting for me.
