I've always had one clear rule: I never let my feet hang out of the bed while I sleep. Ever since I was little, that feeling that something could grab me from underneath never left me alone. It's not that I believed in monsters, but there's something terrifying about what you can't see, what's right under you. Something you only hear in the dark, when you're alone.

A week ago, I started hearing noises at night. It was a soft sound, like something scratching on the floor. At first, I thought it was a mouse or maybe the pipes in the house. But on the third night, the noise became clearer. It was coming from under my bed. It was a scratching, slow and prolonged, as if someone, or something, was trying to get out.

I didn't want to look, of course. I stayed still, covered up to my head, and kept telling myself it was just my imagination. But on the fourth day, the noise turned into something else. It was now a low whisper, barely audible, as if something was trying to speak from beneath my bed. The words were incomprehensible, but its tone was clear: anxious, desperate.

That night, I steeled myself and lowered my head to look. I turned on the flashlight on my phone and shined it into the darkness beneath the bed. There was nothing, just dust and a few forgotten socks. I laughed at myself, relieved, and got up to go back to sleep. But then, just as I was settling in, I felt a chill creep up my spine. The noise was back, and this time, I heard it much closer.

The next day, I couldn’t sleep. Fear kept me awake, and every time I closed my eyes, I felt like something was beneath me, waiting. I kept telling myself that I must be losing my mind. But the nights continued, and so did the noise.

Two nights ago, the whisper changed. This time, I could understand what it was saying. It was a strange, distorted voice, repeating over and over: “Come with me… come down…”

I decided that enough was enough. I couldn’t go on like this, so I grabbed my phone and called a friend. I told him what was happening and he told me to stay at his house that night. I was about to leave, when I heard a loud thud, right under my bed.

Frozen, I looked down at the floor. The thud sounded again, louder this time. I felt an overwhelming panic and, without thinking, I pulled the bed hard to move it and see what was causing the noise.

There was nothing.

But just as I sat up, I felt something in the air. Something was wrong. I looked at my reflection in the mirror on the wall and realized something terrifying. The reflection wasn’t mine. It was me, yes, but my face was distorted, a grotesque smile that didn’t match my own gestures. And the worst, the scariest thing of all, is that my reflection was lying… under the bed.

As I turned around, I felt a cold hand grab my ankle from below. I screamed and stepped back, but the grip was strong, pulling me towards the ground. I struggled with all my might, but the more I resisted, the deeper I felt myself sinking into darkness.

Now, if anyone reads this, I want them to know that there is no way out. I am here, below, waiting. Listening.
