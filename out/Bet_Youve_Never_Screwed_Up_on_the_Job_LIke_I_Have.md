I "quit" the weirdest job I’ve ever had during Christmas last year and I’ve only gathered the courage to talk about it now.

“The pay’s great but there has to be a catch...”

I thought this to myself after I was personally headhunted for a nursing job out in the sticks. My new job was simple. I was employed as a live in nurse for a Mr. Higgins, elderly, dementia-ridden, wealthy recluse living just outside of a small town in New England. Maybe not the greatest work-life balance but the pay was really, really good and I have student loans to pay.

The mansion itself was huge. We’re talking three stories, eight bedrooms, five bathrooms, three kitchens. There’s a small team of maids that visit during the day to make sure everything’s clean and tidy but I’m there just to attend to Mr. Higgins. At least I could pretend I was rich at least.

 

On the first day of the job I met his niece Alice out the front, she was middle-aged, had a look on her face like she would rather be anywhere else but here.

With her arms crossed, she waited at the front steps as I dragged my luggage bag behind me.

“You’re twenty minutes late.”

“I was told one?” I replied confused.

She shook her head. “Just get in.” Unceremoniously she showed me my room, told me to dump my luggage in the corner, and marched me over to the study where Mr. Higgins was sitting in a brown leather recliner, looking out into the surrounding forests.

“He’s sleeping now so try not to interrupt him.” She then told me his daily schedule, his medication, his diet, all his medical conditions, and went over a long list of trivial things that might make Mr. Higgins angry. When she finished the list with Christmas carollers, she promptly asked me if “I got all that?” I nodded, exhausted after the long list of innocuous things that I was never going to remember, which prompted Alice to tell me not to screw up and to call her when I screwed up (her words).

She promptly left (rude) and left me alone with Mr. Higgins without even an introduction.

Not much else happened that evening. I met him and introduced myself. I found him sitting in his chair in the study looking out at the surrounding forest. He didn’t seem mentally all there to be honest but that was expected with someone in the advanced stages of dementia. He mostly answered my questions with a yes or a no or even a grunt of some sort. Shrugged it off and just thought he was shy or something. Checked his blood pressure, other vitals, made sure he ate dinner and helped him to bed.

My own bedroom was on the other side of the mansion. I had to live on the property but I wasn’t complaining. I will never get to sleep in a house this big for the rest of my life, that’s for sure. The bedroom itself seemed larger than the apartment I used to rent: king sized bed with silk linen (of course), a large oaken wardrobe that spanned half the wall and three double wide pane windows that allowed moonlight which bathed the bed in this weird glow.

I just want to say, before I woke up, it was the most comfortable bed I ever slept in.

But I woke up in the middle of the night to the distinct sound of someone *singing*. I couldn’t make out the words but it was almost sad and mournful if that made sense. However after a few seconds I snapped out of my trance and came to the realisation that it was just me and Mr. Higgins in the entire mansion.

*So just who was singing*?

I leaned an ear against my door and a chill ran down my spine. *It doesn’t sound like Mr. Higgins…home invaders? Burglars? Someone more…sinister?* I shook my head and collected myself. *I’m a fully grown woman, I shouldn’t be afraid. Should I call the police? Should I wake Mr. Higgins?*

It was like I was arrested in a state of indecision. *Do I? Do I not*? I just didn’t know what to do. I could feel cold beads of sweat run down my forehead and I pressed it against the door. *This was stupid*, I thought to myself. *There’s no reason for anybody to be here in the middle of the night*. So, putting on my big girl pants, I swung open the door and leapt into the hallway, only to be met with an eerie silence and the empty corridors softly lit up from the moonlight. For a few moments, I stood there like an idiot.

Then I saw her, peering out from the corner down the hallway, a brunette girl in a red dress.

“Wait!” I cried out.

But she didn’t, instead she turned the corner and disappeared, her humming echoing through the halls.

Something, I don’t know what, something compelled me to run after her. I sprinted to the end of the hall and managed to just catch her red dress just as she turned the corner at the other end of the hallway. It was amazing how quickly she seemed to move. So I just ran after her. Again, I reached the end of the corridor only to find her at the other end. I swear I did this another two times before I lost her and the humming stopped. I’d reached a dead end.

Out of breath, I searched room after room yet found no trace of the girl until I reached the very last door at the end of the corridor.

It felt like I was the first person to step in the room for half a century. As soon as I opened the door a bellow of stale air and dust wafted over me, I was almost knocked over from the pungent odor itself. It was a bedroom, I knew that much from the moth eaten and decaying queen size bed underneath dirt covered windows that allowed only small slivers of moonlight to pass through. The only other features of note was a small bedside table with a single photo frame and a half-dilapidated and half-open closet on the side wall, completely empty of any clothes.

“Hello?” I asked innocently.

Of course I didn’t get a response. Really wasn’t expecting to but I was trying to reconcile the fact that I was just chasing a girl that had simply disappeared. With my legs shaking, I stepped foot into the room. With each step, small clouds of dust wafted from the ground and dispersed around me.

There was a sinister vibe from the place, something that I couldn’t quite explain. But I wanted to see the photo on bedstand. As I got closer and closer to the photo the sense of unease in my stomach kept growing and growing until I finally reached it.

All the years of neglect covered the glass with a thick layer of dust so at first I shook the frame and managed to get a surprising amount of dust from it. But then I wiped the rest of it off with my fingers and nearly dropped it when I saw the photo. The photo showed a young man and young girl in a red dress, standing next to a woman who looked exactly like me.

Shocked, I ran out of the room holding the photo and just as I exited the room, the door slammed behind me and locked itself.

 

I didn’t sleep for the rest of the night. I took the photo frame to my room and stared at it until morning.

My mind was racing with questions. *Who are these people? Who lived in that room? Why does this woman look exactly like me?*

Ruth and Betty, the two maids of the house casually strolled in at around seven and made themselves breakfast in the bottom floor kitchen. I tried to explain what happened only hours before but they just snickered.

“This old house settles all the time, sometimes sounds like footsteps. That or the rats.” Said Betty.

“Saw one the size of a small dog one time. Must be something in the forest.” Ruth chimed in.

“And the singing?” I asked almost desperately.

“Kid, no one was singing.” Betty said dismissively.

 

Anyway, that happened. Had breakfast, woke up Mr. Higgins, escorted him to the shower, got him dressed, took vitals, made him take his medication, and wheeled him to his study and parked him beside the window. I asked if he wanted me to grab a book for him but he shook his head and mumbled that he’d rather just look outside for a few hours.

I wasn’t going to argue with him on the second day of the job so I just shrugged my shoulders and absent mindedly gazed out the window as well.

That’s when I saw her at the forest’s edge: the small girl in the red dress from last night.

“That girl, I think I saw her last night.” I said pointing out to the little girl. “Who is she?”

For the first time I’d known him, he looked visibly agitated. His arms started to shake and his mouth formed a nasty scowl. “There is no girl here.” He said pointing at me with a trembling hand.

“Okay, sorry, but-.” I stopped myself as the girl had suddenly disappeared after I looked away.

“There is no girl!” He tried to jump out of his chair and lurched towards me but his frail body let him down. Just as quickly as he jumped up, he collapsed on top of me, catching me by surprise and he pinned me down. He was actually quite tall, I suspect he even bigger when he was younger, but now he was just a lanky, skinny old man. I managed to push him off reflexively but as I went to stand back up I realised that Mr. Higgins had actually collapsed in a pitiful heap on the floor.

My training kicked in and sat down beside him to see if he was conscious. After only a few seconds his eyes opened and fluttered and he moaned. It was just a syncope event but I was still wary of him.

“What? What happened?” Mr. Higgins looked around and realised he was lying on the floor before he looked to me. “Help me up. Please.”

So I did, as was expected of me, even though there was the risk that he may try to attack me again. But I slowly carried him back to his chair and stood back.

“Mr. Higgins, you just-“

“I’m sorry. I think?” He said solemnly. “I didn’t mean to, collapse, like that. There is no girl. There isn’t.”

I just nodded. I asked him if I could take his blood pressure and he nodded. While taking his blood pressure the look of concern never left his face.

He didn’t say much for the rest of the day. I tried to get him to walk around the mansion for a little bit. Could’ve sworn I heard footsteps above the ceiling but kept shaking it off, thought it was just my imagination playing more tricks on me. I even managed to get Mr. Higgins to independently walk up and down the stairs but in his condition he couldn’t manage it for more than a five minute stretch. He ended up taking a nap in the afternoon and so did I (had to catch up on sleep somehow, even if I did sleep on the job).

He had dinner and went to bed. I went to bed but couldn’t sleep.

After failing to fall asleep for hours I just gave up and started scrolling on my phone which actually did the trick since I went to sleep not long after.

However, in the dead of night, I woke to the sound of someone muttering in my room. At first I thought I was dreaming. I mean, I went to sleep alone so there should be no one else in the room, right? So at first, I didn’t even open my eyes, thought I was dreaming.

But I started to get the sense it wasn’t a dream, I was awake, and I could hear someone muttering in the corner of my room.

But I didn’t want to open my eyes. It was like some sort of weird playing dead response, as if I didn’t open my eyes then whoever was in the room wouldn’t react and attack…or worse. So I kept my eyes closed for what seemed like a minute, keeping my breathing down, not moving, doing everything I could to pretend I wasn’t awake. However, from listening I thought I could hear *him*, I could hear the man whisper *mommy? Manny? Molly?* It was something beginning with an ‘m’.

He just kept repeating that same word over and over again. Not coming any closer, not getting any louder. But I knew I couldn’t keep this going all night. Maybe he knows I’m awake, I thought. So, in my inept attempt at being sneaky, I opened my left eye a little.

There, silhouetted against the moonlight, was Mr. Higgins, standing and facing towards me.

So I screamed.

It wasn’t like I wanted to scream but I was just so startled it came out. Almost as if a switch went off, the old man was startled himself and jumped up on the spot, only for him to land and collapse to the ground.

Eventually I managed to collect myself and wake up Mr. Higgins who almost fainted again when he found himself in my room. In his confusion I deduced that he was sleepwalking and helped him back to his bed. After that I then returned to my own bed and painstakingly moved a small cabinet to barricade the door block any geriatric sleepwalkers in the night.

 

“Yeah, he sleepwalks. What of it?” Said Alice dismissively on the phone the next morning.

“I wasn’t aware he sleepwalks. He came into my room in the middle of the night and I don’t know if I’m safe with him.” I said being more polite than that woman deserved.

“I’ll double your pay.”

Now, I was already getting paid an absurd amount to babysit this rich old man before, but doubling that? On the one hand, creepy old guys standing near my bed, on the other hand, I still have a student loans to pay.

“Yeah sure.” Was my almost immediate answer.

Mr. Higgins was sweet though. He kept apologising and I kept saying it was okay. I’ve dealt with plenty of dementia patients before and unfortunately this was a fairly benign experience.

 

So I went on with my work like before. I thought it was going to be awkward seeing Mr. Higgins in the morning but he was almost sweet about it. Now, the start of the day was the most “strenuous” part of my job. I had to wake Mr. Higgins, escort him to the bath (this is benign compared to all the urinary catheters I had to do in a hospital), dry him, clothe him, take his vital signs, make sure he took his medication properly, feed him… you get the idea. But after that initial morning rush I was left to my own devices as Mr. Higgins amused himself in his study.

I stayed with him for half an hour, just sitting in the corner reading a book (forgot what it was, I just picked it off the shelf) before I left the room.

Anyway, the day passed without any strange little girls or Mr. Higgins sleepwalking and at the end of the day I finished up with Mr. Higgins, sending him to bed when I retired to my own.

I could barely sleep and stayed awake for hours when I heard the muttering outside my door. As if I was a ninja, I slinked out of my bed and tried to sneak across my room without making a sound.

As I approached the door I could the muttering clearer: “Mary, Mary, Mary.”

I breathed a small sigh of relief as I realised it was just Mr. Higgins sleepwalking again. Now, I had a small cabinet across the door so he couldn’t barge in but as I could hear him walk away, I suddenly became curious. Where was he going?

It was really awkward but I had to use my entire body to try and QUIETLY move this entire cabinet away from the door so I could open it just enough to sneak out.

For an old guy, he moves fast, faster than he is when awake. So I was doing this awkward “ninja” walking thing trying to catch up to him. I almost lost him around the corner but found him shuffling along, still muttering. I know it was wrong, maybe it could be construed as some type of elder abuse, like I should’ve woken him up straight away and led him back to bed…but I really wanted to see where he was going.

So I followed him, down one corridor and another, doing my awkward ninja walk behind him until we reached an old wooden door at the end of the corridor.

I froze still when he stopped, my chest pounding as I was afraid of getting caught. Even still asleep, he managed to fumble and turn the knob, revealing a set of stairs leading upwards. Without even turning on a light switch he walked up the stairs while still muttering “Mary, Mary”.

I was like wtf. He disappeared into the darkness further up the stairs and I stood there frozen for a few moments.

There was something sinister up there, I could just feel it. I mean, I’ve seen sleepwalking behaviour before, but this was next level. As I was staring into the darkness I could feel a cold stale breeze brush up against me, sending a shiver down my spine. I had known Mr. Higgins for only a few days but I didn’t think he was malicious or bad. Then the more rational part of my brain started to kick in: what would his niece say if he got hurt in a dark attic? That would probably be my job over, with the free rent and once in a lifetime salary that had just doubled yesterday.

Like I was some cartoon character I took a big gulp and started to make my way up the stairs and into the dark attic.

As I said it was dark so I was forced to feel around, and my fingers managed to wrap around the old dry wooden railings. As I slowly made my way up, I could hear Mr. Higgins’s muttering even louder but I noticed he was quietly sobbing as well. I made my way up, one step at a time, as I reached a corner I saw the faint glimmer of candlelight at the top of the stairs.

I could still hear him muttering “Mary, Mary” as I approached the top. Even though I couldn’t see him, there was something unsettling about the way he said it. Then I noticed the musty smell of death in the air. I paused for a moment. This whole attic seemed off and I tried desperately to stop my imagination from getting the best of me. So I took a deep breath and ignored my rapidly beating heart and took the final steps to the top.

I almost fell back down the stairs when I saw Mr. Higgins.

He was kneeling down, next to a corpse of a little girl, in a bright red dress. With his eyes closed, he had both his hands clasped around the mummified decaying rotten dirt coloured flesh that was her face, cradling it in some sort of sick embrace. Her white teeth were bared in a sick twisted smile as she was lying down on the floor. Of course I screamed, and my scream woke up Mr. Higgins, who stared at the corpse, then at me, and then died on the spot.

 

I’d never killed a patient before so it was only fitting that I attended his funeral with the other house staff. It was a sombre funeral, there weren’t many friends of Mr. Higgins still alive but there were plenty of his extended family (including Alice), no doubt hoping for a slice of his estate.

There wasn’t much to say about the funeral and I was glad to leave when it was over. But just as I was exiting the church I heard a woman wail and I turned back to see the commotion, only to witness an old lady (around Mr. Higgins age) pointing at me. She was calmed down by Alice who was standing next to her. It was all really awkward as everyone turned to stare at me, I had just wanted to slip away but Alice brought the old lady over to where I was standing at the exit of the church.

“I, I can’t believe it.” Croaked the old lady.

“Believe what?” I asked nervously.

“You, you look just like her.”

I gulped anxiously. Everyone had started whispering to each other as well as staring. Awkward doesn’t even begin to describe it.

“Let’s move this outside, shall we?” Said Alice.

So the three of us exited the church and Alice invited me to ride with them in the car to the graveyard where they were going to bury Mr. Higgins.

I sheepishly said yes, trying not to offend the family after I practically killed their relative.

On the way the old lady explained that she was actually Mr. Higgins’ sister, the mother of Alice. She went on to apologise for her outburst but insisted that I looked just like “her”.

“Who’s her?” I asked awkwardly.

“Mary’s mother.” The old lady said.

“Mary?”

She went on to explain that Mary was Mr. Higgins’s daughter. Apparently, he had a tryst with one the house’s maids when he was younger but his wealthy family would disown him if he married her. So he denied the child was his. Mary’s mother was so distraught that she murdered the daughter and herself on Christmas. He lived with the regret for all these years and never married.

After that story we drove in silence until we reached the cemetery. It was only after we got out of the car did Alice whisper to me, “It kind of makes sense why that senile old man chose you after seeing your photo on your CV”.

I just mulled over that during the entire burial rites and casket lowering. When it was over, I slowly meandered away from the grave and back towards the car. For one final farewell, I looked back towards his grave and saw a young man holding the girl in the red dress by the hand. They both looked back at me and waved before walking out of sight. A dreadful thought occurred to me, they were expecting to see me again real soon.

Merry Christmas and spend time with your family these holidays.
