 

Have you ever seen a wolf? Not on TV, not in a book, but in person? I don’t know if people understand how truly massive these animals are. Foxes, dogs, they just don’t compare. Wolves are huge animals. It’s incredibly intimidating to come face to face with one.

I’m the kind of person who’s scared of everything. I’ve always been this way. As a kid it was understandable, but as an adult it’s super embarrassing. I’m the person who will see a light flicker and instantly think “ghost!” Or I’ll watch the clouds swirl just before a big storm and I’ll batten down for the impending alien apocalypse. It’s irrational, I know, but it’s just the way my brain works.

Because I’m so afraid of everything, I’m not really all that independent. I mean, sure, I live alone in my apartment with just my cat, but it’s comfortable there. It’s home. Travelling has always made me nervous. I don’t like airports or hotels. I don’t like stressing that my luggage will get stolen. I don’t like it. I’d much rather stay home with my cat where I’m safe.

A writers retreat. Sounded pretty cool at first. A big convention held up north of where I live, a mountainous town with beautiful views. Surrounded by other writers who were also willing to be beta readers. Pretty sweet, hey? And only a few hours away from home, not across the Atlantic Ocean! Yes! No planes!

You may have already guessed it, but I don’t drive. I’m scared of trees moving in the wind and society expects me to operate a car? No way. Absolutely not. Never ever ever.

So. . . How was I to get to this writers retreat? 

The good ol’ EBus. The Greyhound shut down and Red Arrow doesn’t go all the way up there. EBus it is. No problem though, right? Just like riding on the city bus on my way downtown! I could do that, couldn’t I?

Still somewhat nervous about my luggage getting stolen even though it would likely be stowed away on the bus’s cargo compartment, I ended up shoving all my supplies into two backpacks, a tote bag, and my personal purse. That way I could carry it all with me onto the bus and could keep track of it myself. 

I’m boring you with all these extra details, aren’t I? It’s the writer in me, I guess. Let me try to liven things up here. 

The writers retreat was supposed to be held on a resort. Pretty much just a glorified log cabin mansion but with distinct suites like a hotel. I had seen the pictures when I booked. There was an outside area with picnic tables. The resort had several large patio areas and two swimming pools (plus one hot pool!) We could venture out if we wanted. There were hiking trails and kayaking lessons galore up in that area, but I had planned to simply stay at the resort and write. I’m not adventurer. Especially not on my own.

Remember how I said the retreat was ‘supposed’ to be held there? Well, it was not.

Thanks to semi truck veering off the road and crashing itself right through the front of the building, we couldn’t go there. The writers were coming from all over the place. Some had been there already when the crash occurred. Others, like me, were still on their way. The organizer of the writers retreat talked to the resort employees. We couldn’t stay there. The damage was too extensive. I got this news via text. The bus was on route to the bus station, my drop off location. I never saw the damage in person. 

So, what do all the other writers do when they get this news? Easy. They hop back in their car and either drive home or find somewhere else to go. And what was I to do? The bus that had driven me all this way up north was now on course to the east of the retreat location. To get home, I’d have to stay on the bus for another 12+ hours. 

Luckily, the lady working the desk at the bus station where I was dropped off was willing to help. It wasn’t looking like any bus would be stopping there on course back to my town for a while. She recommended I get a place to stay for a night or two while I figure out how I’m going to get back home. She even found a place for me because I had no idea where or how to get one.

Rambling again. Tiny mundane details that don’t even matter. I’m sorry. I’ll try to get back on track.

The place I would now be staying at was a cabin in the woods. Yeah, I’ve heard of that movie too. That’s the first thing that popped in my mind.

Without boring you all to tears, I do need to describe the cabin for clarity on what happened that night. You sort of need the whole picture so you can see how strange the wolf encounter was.

The cabin was house-sized. Like, a really nice house in a suburban neighbourhood. It was HUGE. It had a main floor and an upstairs. The stairs to get up to the bedroom were widely spaced out between steps which made the staircase incredibly tall. Once I got there (thanks to my Uber driver Theodore) I flicked every light inside on and then ran up to my bedroom with all my stuff. The cabin’s interior was huge. It seemed so strange that such a large building only had one bedroom. But whatever. I was out there in the woods and I felt so isolated. I never really realized how secure I actually felt in my apartment until I had to stay in this place. 

Want to hear something really embarrassing? When night fell, I climbed on top of the bed, not in it, and felt myself afraid to go to sleep. Every light in the place was still turned on because I was too nervous to even leave the bedroom to switch off the lights. However, when it got dark out, the lights were needed much more.

I lay on the bed (again, on, not in) and shut my eyes. I wanted desperately to be asleep.

While I tried as hard as I could to relax, I started to hear howling outside. Wolves! They sound got closer and louder and bigger. Must’ve been a whole pack of wolves! This didn’t scare me. I was afraid of ghosts and aliens and bad people, not of some big doggos running around in the forest. Not like they were going to bust their way into my cabin. Besides, up in my room, I was nearly three storeys off the ground they were patrolling. The stairs with their wide gaps between steps were to thank for that one.

Wolves. Okay, not so scary. Maybe I would fall asleep soon.

Laying on the bed rather than in was comfy enough until I started to get cold. I needed to cover myself with a blanket because the nighttime cold air was blowing on me through the window.

The window! Had it been open this whole time? How had I not noticed! I should’ve closed it and locked it immediately upon entering the bedroom. What a dope I was! Was the front door open and unlocked too? 

I had to close the window. The blinds were still open too. I felt that childish fear of looking out of a window into the dark and seeing something frightening outside.

Oh god. I’m such a baby. Just get off the damn bed and close the damn window. It isn’t rocket science.

So I got off the bed. And I went to close the window.

Three storeys off the ground, probably at the same height I would be at home in my third floor apartment, and yet, when I looked out, I came into eye contact with a wolf. His big furry face was level to mine, peering right into my bedroom. We honestly just stared at each other for a while before I reached for the cords to shut the blinds. I ended up not closing the window, only the blinds. With the blinds shut, I couldn’t see the wolf and the wolf couldn’t see me. 

I fell asleep. 

I woke up.

Maybe I had dreamed of the wolf. It was impossible. Wolves are massive, but even so, it had to be standing on its hind legs on like nine step ladders piled on top of each other. 

I sent out several SOS texts to friends and family the next day. Help. Stranded in Grande Cache. Please send help.

I was only partly joking.

But the SOS messages did work! My cousin in law confirmed she was able to drive up and come get me! Since she wouldn’t be here until late, she asked if she could stay a night with me in the cabin and then we’d head back the next day.

I have such wonderful family. 

I spent the day alone in the cabin. Nothing happened. I was mostly bored and trying to get some writing done in absence of the writers retreat. Lindsay arrived at nightfall.

The cabin, although ginormous, really lacked on sleeping places. There was one bed in one bedroom in the whole place. I told her to take the bed. She deserved it for driving all the way up here to come get me! I’d sleep downstairs on the couch, and I wouldn’t be so afraid because I wouldn’t be alone that night. Lindsay would be right above me.

I played around on my phone for a while before closing my eyes and falling asleep. I didn’t hear any wolves howling at all, even while I was up late down on the couch screwing around with any game app I could find. No wifi, by the way. 

I slept through the whole night. I felt so rested.

I was up before Lindsay. She came staggering down those ginormous wide gapped steps after I was already dressed and ready for the day. I could tell she was exhausted.

“How’d ya’ sleep?” I asked her.

“Damn howling wolves kept me up all night,” she replied.

“Oh? I didn’t hear any from where I was down here.” 

“How? They were so obnoxious. And I’m saying this as an owner of to Siberian huskies!” 

I giggled.

“Plus, I just got a creepy vibe from that room up there. I was kind of unnerved.”

I shouldn’t have asked for details but I did.

“I don’t know, I just felt like I was being watched. I even tried to sleep on my side turning away from the window, but I swear I could feel hot breath on me coming from the window. Like something was just looming over my shoulder.”

I really shouldn’t have asked.

“Well. . . Did you ever look to see what it was?” I inquired.

“You’ll think I’m crazy,” she said.

“No I won’t,” I assured her.

“Well, when I turned to look at the window after feeling the breaths on me, I swear I could see the snout of a wolf retreating back outside, like its head was inside sniffing at me but got spooked when I turned around to look at it. I sat up to look out the window but there was no sign of a wolf. It didn’t make sense for one to have its head up so high anyway, but I swear I saw the nose and mouth. When it retreated back outside, it simply disappeared into thin air.”

“Oh, weird,” I replied, trying to mask my nervousness. 

“And the way they howled all night. All night!”

“I didn’t hear any.”

“That’s really strange, because sometimes it sounded like the howls were coming from inside the room, like they were right there.”

I packed my shit, she packed her shit, and we got out of there. She seemed tired but not overly concerned about the wolf incidents of the previous night. I was rushing for us to get in the car and just GO but she was content to sip her coffee and walk around outside a bit before starting the ride that would be several hours.

Just as we were pulling out, Lindsay stopped the car.

“What?” I asked anxiously.

“Hold on, I just remembered I left my toothbrush in the bathroom. I’m gonna’ run and get it quickly.”

The upstairs bathroom was adjacent to the bedroom. When she came back down, toothbrush in hand, I could see a puzzled look on her face.

“I stayed in that room all night. How did I never notice the wolf skin rug on the floor?”

I know for a fact there was no wolf skin rug when I stayed there. I know this because I distinctly remember setting my bags down on the hardwood floor. There was no rug. 

I didn’t reply. Lindsay continued backing up out of our site and soon we’d be on the highway on our way home. I took one last look at the cabin as we were leaving. 

And I swear I saw the face of a wolf looking back at me from inside the bedroom. It wasn’t there for long, maybe only three seconds, but when the wind blew, the face seemed to go with it and disappeared into nothing. Nothing was looking back at me anymore but, slowly, the window began to close on its own.

I stopped looking. I didn’t tell Lindsay.

The writers retreat was canceled due to some unfortunate circumstances, but I think the little mountain get-away did end up supplying me with the inspiration to work on something new. I think I have something to write about now.
