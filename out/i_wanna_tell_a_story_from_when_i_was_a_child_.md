i was about 7/8 years old so this was around 10/11 years ago now

i was at school as normal nothing out of the ordinary happening, until lunch time take in count being in year 3/4 n being curious like i was n into the weird scary ghost stuff, i didn’t mind it it wouldn’t bother me or scare me.

this girl who i was friends with ill call her jessica, she starts telling me about bloody mary, scary mary n the charlie charlie challenge (this still scares me as an 18 year old bc of what happened 😐) she explains tccc to me n i’m just like ‘hm okay’ looking kinda confused at her ig.

she gets a tissue, the ones your dry your hands are n draws a plus sign then puts on there with a whiteboard pen in each section of this large plus sign ‘YES | NO 
                    NO  | YES ‘
she gets the pen that she used n asked what you ask i hate saying it 😐 ‘cc are you there’ it wasn’t windy none of our mouths were near that pen n i shit you not it goes to diagonally yes o shit myself ofc i was quite scared n i just said goodbye i couldn’t carry on it was creeping me out so bad.

i went to the toilet n these toilets were creepy af anyways (apparently my primary school was a WWII hospital or something which is creepy enough on itself so if it’s true it might explain why this toilets were the creepiest) i wasn’t scared to go in these toilets on my own until after this, anyways, i was in the toilet doing my business n take in count my friend ‘jessica’ was doing bloody mary or scary mary i literally screamed ‘DONT DO THAT IN HERE I DONT WANNA BE IN HERE JESSICA OMG STOP’ she said it twice before she stopped, she left just as i was done in the toilets n said she’d meet me outside the toilets, the doors close n the fucking lights turn off, ofc i was scared af so i quickly pulled my stuff up n ran so fucking quickly to leave i wanted to cry.

nothing else happened that day with me n ‘jessica’ ofc my parents picked me up from school i didn’t speak of it bc i was scared n was  trying to keep my mind off it. i wasnt concerned abt anything bc i tried not believing it, i started feeling sick after tea so at the time i shared bunk beds with my sister,so i climbed up the ladder n tried wrapping up n going to sleep, i would usually put my whole body under the cover but leave myself like a little air hole so i didn’t suffocate, i go to sleep. 

it’s around 2 or 3 am by now n i woke up, nothing abnormal, or so i thought. this is where it’s kind blurry but i remember hearing absolutely nothing but what sounded like banging on the fucking floor. no one was awake bc i’d be able to hear my parents chatting shit or whatever they’d do downstairs, it was strange as well bc i could hear banging but diesel, our dog, wasn’t barking i had a million thoughts whike trying not to cry n trying not to move at all incase there was like some fucking demon mf (it’s kinda funny when i put it like that but i was sooooo fucking scared) it would stop then start again stop, start, stop, start, until it stopped completely i fucking swear i heard someone whisper my name all i heard was ‘chaska’ it sounded like chinese whisper, the game. i didn’t say a word. i stayed under my covers for the rest of the night, i got back to sleep n i didn’t tell my parents about it bc i was so scared n i just wanted to forget abt everything. 

this happened at my mums house, i still love her atm n this house is still so creepy there’s so many things that have happened in this house n i still refuse to be in this house fully on my own bc of everything i’ve heard everything i’ve seen n everything i’ve been told to. 

another thing i also refuse to live alone not only bc of mental health but i’ve been at my boyfriends uncles house while they was on holiday n ofc i got permission to stay with my boyfriend to look after the house, my boyfriend was going to college gave me a kiss told me he loved me posted the keys back through the door so i could go back to my parents that day, i went back to sleep until abt 11am called my mum n i shit you not someone ran past the living room door. i told my boyfriends uncles girlfriend n she says there’s a ghost man or shadow man in their house (i’m pretty sure, somethings along those lines) never looked at someone so shit scared before, i haven’t been there since 😭 (tbf i haven’t been bc i’ll only go round with my boyfriend) - i forgot to add this earlier, thats was the middle of the week me n my boyfriend stayed, the first night we slept on the sofa i woke up around 3-4 am to banging like someone tryna stab holes in those microwave meals i hid myself n tried reaching for my boyfriends hand but he wasn’t there, i asked him abt it n he said he wasnt in the kitchen he went to the toilet.. this fucked me up for the whole week n i said maybe i had a sleep paralysis thing again. (i’ve had sleep paralysis at his before) just a note, i was 17 at this point, both times of sleep paralysis. it was scary n really weird to me anyone have an explanation? 😐 

ik this might not be that creepy to some but it still seems to keep me up at night.

anyone lmk if you want any others abt my creepy ass childhood 😭
