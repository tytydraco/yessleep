Decent budget option, a little loud at night. Bring earplugs!

Got a really good deal on this place through TripAdvisor. I was apprehensive about staying here due to the poor reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. The room was larger than expected and had a beautiful oak vanity with a polished silver mirror. Could use a deep clean, but what do you expect for twenty bucks?

As an experienced traveler who has stayed in more than 200 hotels, I know the five things to look for when judging the quality of a place.

LOCATION - 4/5 NickPoints

Hotel Banshee is located just off the freeway, making it a convenient rest stop for the weary road warrior. Alas, old Nick has to deduct one point for the bumpy half-mile final stretch down a potholed dirt road.

AMBIENCE - 3/5 NickPoints

You’ll be staying in a lovely old Victorian house with stained glass windows and a grand spiral staircase. It’s too bad that everything is a bit rundown - minus two points!

SERVICE - 1/5 NickPoints

This was the big one that hurt this place’s score. There was no receptionist or housekeeper to be found and no phone number posted. I saw a woman pass by my window as I was bringing my luggage in, so there’s at least someone on-site.

CLEANLINESS - 2/5 NickPoints

The room was grimy, but between you and me, old Nick has seen worse!

VALUE FOR MONEY - 5/5 NickPoints

This is the most affordable stay you’ll find in the area. Period.

Overall, this place gets 3 out of 5 NickPoints. Check my profile for more reviews.

Stay FAR AWAY from this “hotel”. I am reporting these scam artists to the BBB and the FTC.

First of all, the location is impossible to find. The GPS took us down an endless dirt road to a seemingly empty lot. Just when we were about to give up, my daughter took one last look and spotted the building in the shadows, not a single light on.

There was no one at reception, just a key with *13* etched into the metal sitting on the counter. The room was absolutely filthy, long black hair everywhere. When we turned on the tap, all that came out was black water choked with more of that awful hair. We would have left if we hadn’t already driven for 13 hours straight.

Then there was this woman who walked back and forth outside our window at one in the morning, making a horrible keening sound. I’m sure there was something wrong with her. I couldn’t ever get a good look at her for some reason, but I saw her reflection clearly in the vanity mirror. Even though it was freezing out, she was wearing nothing but a torn white dress, and she kept combing and combing her hair as she wailed. We couldn’t get a wink of sleep.

Since we stayed here, my daughter hasn’t been able to stop coughing. I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s black mold in the walls. If you value your HEALTH and your SANITY, steer clear of this terrible excuse for a hotel.

The screaming bitch needs to shut the fuck up.
