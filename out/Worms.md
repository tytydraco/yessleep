*Some of my fondest childhood memories are of my uncle taking me fishing. He was well off, a surgeon, never married, no kids of his own, and would shower me with gifts and attention, and talk to me about things nobody else did. He introduced me to classical music, literature, philosophy, taught me about animals, plants and evolution.*

*We'd drive out to a river or lake, he'd set up our gear, then he'd take out a worm (“Nature's simple little lures,” he called them) and pierce it with a fish hook, assuring me it didn't feel any pain. Then we'd fish for hours. When we were done, he'd clean a couple of catches, get a fire going, and if there were any worms left over—writhing in their metal pail—he'd toss them on the fire and laugh, and laugh, and laugh…*

“Hello,” I mumbled, still not fully alert. It was three in the morning and the phone had woken me up. “Who is this?”

“It's me,” my uncle said, his voice hoarse, tired. I was thirty-seven and hadn't heard from him in over a decade. “You must come.”

I asked if everything was all right, but he ignored me, giving me instead an address several hundred kilometres away. “There is no one else,” he said, wheezing. “No one to understand. I've not much time left, and everything I have—I want to give to you.” Then he hung up, and I got dressed, and in the cold of morning I started the car and drove onto the pale and empty highway.

The address was a house in the woods, his retirement house I presumed: big, beautiful, like nothing I could ever hope to afford.

One car was in the driveway.

The front door was closed—I knocked: *no answer*—but unlocked, so I entered, announcing myself as I did in some weird combination of formality and warmth. “Are you home?”

The place was immaculately clean, every surface scrubbed, shining, with not a speck of dust anywhere.

I stopped in the kitchen, caught for a second looking over a stack of unopened mail, then took out my phone and called the number he'd called from earlier. He didn't pick up; I didn't hear his phone ring. Eerie, I thought. The house, though filled with things and furniture, felt cavernously empty.

I proceeded from the kitchen to the living room, where I first heard the gentle strains of music, something by Bartok.

I followed the music (increasingly loud and discordant) down a hallway to a door, realizing only then how forcefully my heart was beating, calling out my uncle's name from time to time but knowing there would be no answer.

At the door, I exhaled before pulling it open to see *his old and pale naked body, hanging by its bruised neck from a beam, eyes missing, blood-like-tears running from their empty sockets, a knife lying on the floor below his limp feet, their toes pointing unnaturally downward, and his entire lower body encrusted with dried and drying blood—from his belly, sliced horizontally open, disgorging his guts, and into the raw, fleshy interior a speaker had been fitted.* As I stepped into the room, instinctively covering my face, it played:

“...my dearest nephew, to you I leave it all and everything. Like nature's simple little lures. As worms we are to the gods, as worms…”

This, followed by the sounds of the seeming self-infliction of the wounds on full display before me. Only shock prevented me from vomiting, screaming, fleeing.

“... reel them in…” His final, dying words—followed by a *click*, followed by Bartok silenced and a trap door opened, a square of blackness in the hardwood floor directly below my uncle's body.

A ladder.

*The smell of soil as if after a long rain.*

God knows why, but I descended.

Fear is like a magnet. It both repels and attracts.

Off the ladder's final rung, I felt softness under my boots and found myself in a long, excavated corridor, along which I continued, right hand sliding along the wet, rocky wall, to help me keep my balance. There were bodies here—human, parts of them anyway, decayed or broken, bones jutting from the earthen floor, organs in glass containers, some stacked, some upturned and cracked, leaking. There were tools and instruments too, industrial and medical, scattered about. The scene looked like a battleground.

At the end point of the corridor were three heads, tied together by their hair, and hanged somehow from the ceiling: human heads—to the face of each of which was stitched the severed snout of a dog.

*Cereberus…*

I entered a vast underground chamber.

At its entrance stood a long table—or altar—stained with darkness, atop which had been arranged a series of jars containing what I could identify as *a human brain, heart, eyes, nose, ears, lungs, liver.* And, next to it, *what appeared to be a full, extracted human skeleton and a shroud on which were gathered shaved human hairs.* I could hardly breathe, let alone let out any kind of sound, feeling the heat of every one of those parts within my own body.

The stagnant air felt alternately cold and hot, humid, and whereas upstairs, in my uncle's house, I had felt alone, down here, in the subterrain, I sensed a presence. *An infernal presence.* It was then I saw movement—

Not of a thing but of the earth, the soil, like the surface of a lake disturbed by the passing of a fish, or the agitation of dirt by a burrowed bug: the presence of something made apparent by its effect on something else.

And in the same way I knew of **it** because of its effect on me.

And, from the soft, moist soil, there wiggled out a thing, a creature, a once-human misery, that glowed in the persistent grey gloom, faceless—or, more precisely, now-featureless and sutured shut—about a metre-and-a-half long, tubular, with smooth, pink transparent skin, its arms and legs removed and the resulting gashes sewn shut, with five pairs of small aortic arches within the flesh-tube, as well as a single intestine, and a long single nerve cord ending—in what used to be its human head—in a mere few clusters of nerves. 

Yet it was alive and seemed to move with purpose, slithering along the ground like a slow, uncoordinated snake, weaving in and out of the soil, until…

There opened in the black space above it, but far above and well beyond the chamber itself, *as if the darkness had depth beyond the possible,* a solitary eye, and, below, a mouth, whose insides burned like a furnace, with teeth made of flames, a molten tongue, a breath of pounding heat and black ash.

—and, into, disappeared the worm.

The mouth closed. The eye vanished into black nothingness.

I ran,

backwards first, then spinning, falling against the hard corridor wall, and to the ladder, and up the ladder, into the room in which my uncle hanged, and out, and out of the house, and into my car, and down the highway. But all the while, I tell you, I felt a tension, a pressure on my back, as if pulling me, and the more I fought, the more it pulled, until it was gone, and either I was freed or I had dragged it out of that forsaken place with me—*[out of the underworld—into ours.](https://www.reddit.com/r/normancrane)*
