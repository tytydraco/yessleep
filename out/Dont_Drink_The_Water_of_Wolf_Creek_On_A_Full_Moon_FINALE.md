“Okay,” I said backing up, “what the actual fuck?!”

Aidan chuckled. “What? Never seen a [werewolf](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/u9k5f5SUTn) before?”

“W-why!?!” Katelyn screamed, wanting to know what justification he had for killing her boyfriend and best friend.

“This dumb brunette asks me why,” Aiden said ruefully, as if she should’ve known better. Truth be told, Jonah, Brandon and I were stumped too. He scoffed, appalled at all four of us. “Two words: fake, date.”

Katelyn gasped as it clicked in her mind. “Oh my god.”

Aidan was referring to the time Heather had asked him out on a date and it ended up becoming a joke. She and Brandon had been in the off phase of their on and off again relationship when Aidan first arrived to the school. She thought he was attractive and asked him out on a date, to which he said yes. Then, she and Brandon made up.

Instead of cancelling, Brandon and Heather had convinced the rest of us to show up to the date, where they mainly laughed at Aidan and put him down. Heather, having Katelyn hype her up, had asked him so many times why he thought she would ever date someone like him.

It was a shitty and awkward situation but by the end we all thought he handled it fine, better than most would.

Us guys even decided he was chill enough to become part of the friend group after football tryouts. Things were pretty civil between us, besides everyone else constantly making him the butt of every joke. Aidan took it in stride though.

It seemed like he had put the fake date past him, water under the bridge and all that. Turns out we were dead wrong.

“Dude! We never would’ve done that if we knew you were a werewolf!” Brandon argued.

Aidan rolled his eyes. “Do you know how long I’ve been waiting to get all six of you isolated so I could kill you?” He paused, brushing a strand of his ruffled brown hair out of his face while maniacally laughing. “Imagine my surprise when I discovered this little shin dig would be happening on a full moon. I’ve been waiting for this party the whole semester!”

The cloud coverage over the moon shifted slightly, its light returning for the moment. As if reacting to it, Aidan doubled over, his eyes scrunched closed as a wave of pain rippled through him. He was going to change again.

I saw a chance and I took it. “Quick!” I shouted, running at him. “Hold him down!”

Jonah and Brandon quickly followed my lead, the three of us tackling Aidan during a moment of vulnerability. Just as the light had come back, it went away again.

I held Aidan down by his back. “Katelyn, we need something to restrain him! Jonah, hold his wrists! Brandon, get his legs!”

“Oh I know!” She said, a lightbulb going off over her head. She took off for another room in her house “Be right back!”

Even though Aidan was the smallest out of the four of us guys, Brandon, Jonah, and I struggled to keep him down. He did have the advantage of supernatural strength after all.

“You know, Russell,” Aidan strained to say through gritted teeth.

“What?” I asked, indulging him.

“You were the only one that never bullied or made fun of me. In my opinion, that makes it worse. Standing by, doing nothing, while I was hurt and humiliated!”

I applied more pressure to the knee pinning him down as he tried to get the upper hand on us again. “If it’s any consolation, I’m sorry.”

Aidan chuckled angrily. “It’s not.”

“Got it!” Katelyn cheered, re-entering the hallway we were in. She held out a shiny metallic, yet simultaneously fuzzy, object.

“Are those-?”Jonah began to ask.

“A pair of my parent’s handcuffs? Yes.” Katelyn answered as she slipped them over Aidan’s wrists. She clicked each cuff closed as tight as she could.

Brandon placed his hand vertically against the side of his face and began to whisper, “Her parents liked to get freak-ayyy\~”

“These won’t hold me forever, you know.”

“They’ll hold you long enough for us to find something silver,” I quipped back, applying more pressure than needed on his back.

In response, Aidan tried to flip himself over. Fairy confident he was well restrained, the three of us backed off, letting him get comfortable.

Katelyn stroked her thumb against her chin as she searched the files in her mind. “We have to have *something* silver in this house.”

Aidan began to laugh cockily. “You really think I’d break into a house that had my kryptonite in it? I did a little reconnaissance before your little party. I came prepared.”

Katelyn looked dumb struck. “You were in my house?! When?”

Instead of answering, Aidan flashed her a sleazy smile before looking over at Brandon. “I bet he doesn’t know what color underwear you’re wearing\~”

“You mother fucker, I’ll kick your ass!” Brandon yelled, lunging at Aidan. Jonah and I had to restrain him from doing anything too rash. We did, of course, let him get one good hit in. The four of us then moved away from the werewolf, but not too far away.

“Guys, we need to figure out what to do,” Jonah said, analyzing our situation. “He’s right, those cuffs won’t last forever.”

“Neither will the cloud coverage over the moon,” I noted, observing how Aidan transformed back after the moonlight had gone away.

“What can we do?” Brandon panicked. “There’s no silver to defend ourselves with!”

Katelyn started to have a panic attack. “This is hopeless! We’re doomed!”

Aidan’s annoying cackles occupied the background of our conversation.

“I have an idea,” I announced after wracking my brain for any possible solution. My idea was so stupid, it might just work. “I’m going to drink the water from Wolf Creek.”

“Are you crazy?!” Katelyn shouted at me. “It’s just a myth!”

“Well, so are werewolves!” I countered, looking at her appalled. Katelyn’s expression wavered as she considered my logic.

“Theoretically, it could work,” Jonah said, bitting his thumbnail. “Plus, we don’t have many other options at this point.”

I sighed a breath of relief. “Well that’s settled then.”

“I’ll go with you!” Brandon volunteered.

I shot him a concerned look. Brandon was a lot of things, but him being capable of helping pull this off was questionable.

“Think about it, if we both drink from the creek and become werewolves then we’ll outnumber him. We’d have the advantage.”

I pressed my lips into a thin line before I reluctantly agreed. That was actually the smartest thing I’d heard him say in a while. I couldn’t argue with such sound logic.

“Besides, being a werewolf would be awesome!”

We all scowled at Brandon.

“We better get going,” he said, clearing his throat and grabbing his car keys, “we don’t have all night.”

I nodded in agreement. Katelyn, Jonah, and I all stared at one another with a mutual understanding as we migrated further into the house. “Call us if anything happens,” I instructed as the two of us walked out the front door. Jonah gave a two fingered salute from the doorway.

Brandon’s F-150 chirped at the end of Katelyn’s driveway as he unlocked the car.

“Do you know where Wolf Creek is?” I asked, hopping into shotgun. “I’ve heard of it but never been there.”

“Yeah, it’s a couple miles down the road. I took Katelyn on a picnic date near there once,” Brandon answered, quickly peeling out of there.

He drove down a series of streets, seemingly twisting and turning down them at random, all while speeding. Brandon would periodically look out the window at the clouds covering the moon. Any minute they could shift again, and we knew it.

“Are you sure, you know where you’re going?” I asked, wringing my hands nervously. We had been driving for almost ten minutes at that point. I discretely took out my phone and pulled up my maps app, ready to search up the creek’s location at a moments notice. I stayed at the ready, but I wanted to give Brandon the benefit of the doubt first.

“Yes!” Brandon snapped, succumbing to the pressure we were under. His foot smashed on the breaks as he began to drive slowly, scanning the scenery outside for the creek.

We slowly approached a street sign for Wolf Creek Road, but Brandon wasn’t paying attention to it. He was right about to drive past it.

“Turn! Turn here! It’s Wolf Creek Road!” I shouted frantically, pointing at the street sign.

The truck jerked sharply as Brandon’s tires screeched against the asphalt, barely managing to make the turn. “Yeah,” he said breathlessly, “this looks familiar. See, I told you I knew where I was going!”

I rolled my eyes, opting to look out the window searching for the creek. “There!” I said, pointing to a small sign that read Wolf Creek. It ran through a residential area, a small walking bridge had been built over the ditch the creek ran through.

At the same time we discovered the creek, flashing blue and red lights turned on behind us.

“Shit! We don’t have time for this!” Brandon muttered under his breath as he pulled his vehicle over.

I pat his shoulder reassuringly, “Hey, at least we found the creek.” My heart then sank as I realized we had been drinking. Brandon and I were definitely buzzed. With a werewolf waiting back at the house, on top of us being under age, things weren’t looking so good.

“You kids been having fun tonight?” The officer asked as Brandon rolled down his window. “You were driving pretty interestingly there.”

Brandon and I shot each other nervous glances. I gulped.

The officer leaned against the side of the truck. “There was a prank call to emergency services earlier tonight coming from around this area. You boys wouldn’t know anything about that, would ya?”

That look Brandon gets when he’s about to do something stupid showed up on his face. My eyes widened as I began shaking my head no, an inkling of what he was about to do crossing my mind.

“Two of our friends were killed by a werewolf!” He sputtered out suddenly. A relieved laugh left his mouth as he continued to spill his guts. “And the werewolf is our friend, who turns out isn’t really our friend?! He’s determined to kill our whole friend group by the end of night! He’s locked up in my girlfriend’s parent’s handcuffs and we’re trying to drink the creek water to test the legend and hopefully defeat him!”

I sunk my face into my hands. This wasn’t going to end well.

“Yeah… I’m going to need you two to step out of the vehicle please,” the cop said, staring at Brandon, unamused.

As if things couldn’t get much worse, the full moon once again shone as the clouds covering it drifted away.

The officer and his partner had lined Brandon and I up against the side of their cruiser. We had just finished doing a field sobriety test, now they were having us blow into a breathalyzer.

A couple of nosey neighbors were peaking behind their curtains to see what was going on. This one older lady had come out under the false pretense of walking her pudgy bulldog. She stood on the street corner behind a stop sign, not even trying to hide the fact she was watching us.

“This one is under the legal limit,” the officer’s partner relayed, as if I wasn’t standing there in front of him.

The other officer sighed disappointedly as he checked Brandon’s readings, “So is this one.”

“Smell any pot on ‘em?” The partner asked.

The officer looked Brandon up and down before scoffing. “Unfortunately not… but they gotta be on *something.* Let’s take them back to the station and have ‘em pee in a cup.”

“The station?!” I gasped. We’d never get back in time to save Jonah and Katelyn. Hell, they could’ve been dead already! Brandon and I shot each other a knowing glance.

“Officer please, we can’t go to the police station,” he begged. “I already explained to you-“

“First, I’d like to check the dilation of their pupils,” he said, cutting Brandon off. A bright beam of light was then shoved in his eyes, blinding him momentarily.

The cops partner nodded his head in agreement before doing the same with me. He had just finished examining me when we heard it. My heart sank to the pit in my stomach as a howl sounded out in the distance. It wasn’t that far away.

“What the Hell was that?!” The police officer that detained Brandon asked. He stepped back, putting his hand on his gun holster as he inspected our surroundings.

The old woman’s bulldog started growling and barking like crazy, sensing a predator lurking nearby.

“Quick! While they’re distracted!” Brandon suddenly yelled, blindly taking off. “To the creek!”

I stood there, still dazed by the flashlight, rapidly blinking to bring my vision back.

“Hey!” The officer yelled, he was about to chase after him, but paused, curiously.

Still blinded by the light, Brandon haphazardly ran towards where he thought he heard the rushing water of the creek. He actually ran in the opposite direction towards the old lady and her dog. The animal, rightfully scared, had began pissing itself out of fear.

Brandon stepped in the puddle that had pooled on the sidewalk. Thinking it was the creek, he leaned down and gathered a small sample in his hands, sloppily lapping it up. “Heads up Russell, the creek water tastes gross! It’s not refreshing at all!” He commented through sips of the yellow liquid, still oblivious to what he was actually drinking.

“Are you sure this man isn’t on any drugs, officer?” The old woman asked, clutching her pearls. Even the dog looked at him like “dude, what the fuck is this guy going?”

The three of us just stared at him, cringing, too stunned to say anything.

Brandon then blinked rapidly, his temporary blindness dissipating. “Aw eww!” He exclaimed, realizing his mistake. He wiped the pee off his hands, spitting and gagging the whole way over to Wolf Creek on the verge of vomiting.

He was just about to cleanse the delightful taste of dog pee out of his mouth when one of the officers shouted, causing him to pause. A gigantic grey blur had collided with the first officer, dragging him away from his police cruiser.

“He’s here!” I yelled, diving out of the way.

“Jesus Christ!” The partner exclaimed, reaching for his gun. He barely managed to pull the weapon out of the holster before Aidan attacked him too.

A deadly snarl left the wolf’s maw as he feasted on the dead officer’s entrails. When he was finished, Aidan’s eyes landed right on me.

I slowly began to crawl backwards. The wolf predatorily stalked towards me. I could see the bloodlust swirling in Aidan’s glowing blue eyes. I looked behind me at the innocent woman and dog. I took my eyes off of the wolf to warn them. “Go! Get out of here! Before it’s too late!”

The woman shook like crazy, but nodded her head in understanding, wrangling her dog up to escape.

I then turned back, bracing for impact as Aidan readied to go in for the kill. He jumped, but landed behind me. Confused and relieved, I looked to see why.

The pudgy bulldog had broken free of its leash, yapping as it charged forward in an attempt to protect its owner instead of running away. Deeming the dog as more of a threat than me, Aidan changed course last second to neutralize it.

“Frederick, no!” The old lady cried as she reached out for her dog, but it was too late. Though Fredrick the pudgy bulldog got a good nip or two in there, he was no match for his gigantic werewolf opponent.

The old lady, seemingly unaware of what had attacked her dog, whipped the metal part of the dog leash at Aidan. “Bad dog! Bad!”

Annoyed, Aidan quickly pounced on the old woman. Her shrill screams filling the air as she was torn apart.

I quickly stood up, realizing this was the only chance we’d get. Brandon and I met up at the side of the creek. We took one last glance at the moon, which would once again be covered soon, before finally drinking the water of Wolf Creek.

Aidan disapprovingly howled. He didn’t get a chance to do anything as he stared shifting back into a human again.

“God I hope I don’t get a brain eating amoeba from this!” I said, gulping down a giant mouthful of gritty creek water.

“It tastes better than dog piss,” Brandon said, using the water to flush his tongue.

Aidan let out a pained groan as his vocal cords snapped back into place. We stopped drinking from the creek to look at him.

“We need to get him back to the house, while the moon is still covered!”

Brandon looked over to the police cruiser which still had the red and blue lights on. “I’ve got it!” He took off, running over to the police officer’s corpses.

Another sinister laugh left Aidan’s mouth, his whole body human again. “You think you can stop me?”

“No, not really,” I said, wiping my mouth off. Brandon’s figure appeared in my peripheral vision. “But you should really put some pants on.”

Just then, Brandon charged forward having stolen a taser gun from the cops. He released a guttural cry as he pressed the trigger, going right for Aidan’s exposed nut sack.

With impeccable aim, two electrified prongs satisfyingly connected to the man’s unclothed private parts. Aidan fell to the floor, convulsing, as he tried to yank the metal out of him. He screamed through gritted teeth as fifty thousand volts of electricity ravaged his body.

A shudder crept down my spine as I imagined the pain he was feeling. Then I remembered he killed my friends and shrugged it off.

“C’mon, let’s get him in the bed of the truck,”  Brandon said, picking up Aidan’s unconscious body. I got his arms and we chucked the fucker into the car. Brandon and I quickly peeled out of there before more cops came to investigate the scene.

“Where have you guys been?” Katelyn scolded as we pulled into the driveway. A streak of blood ran down her face.

Jonah stood beside Katelyn, comforting her. He looked pretty banged up too with a few cuts and bruises on his arms. “He got out.”

“Yeah, we know,” I said, exiting the truck.

“We’ve been busy,”Brandon quipped as he and I pulled Aidan’s unconscious body out of the bed of his truck. Jonah ran over to help carry him back into the house. We settled him on the couch in the living room.

“Got anymore hand cuffs?” Jonah asked Katelyn with a smirk. He put his hands on his hips, looking down at Aidan.

“Unfortunately not,” she answered. Katelyn then looked around, her eyes landing on the coat rack next to the front door. “This scarf might work though.”

Jonah took the scarf and started tying Aidan’s hands together. I found a small throw blanket and used that to tie his legs together. “That should hold. For a little while at least.”

Brandon placed a couch pillow over Aidan’s nether regions. “Do you think it worked?” He asked. “I don’t feel any different.”

My shoulders shrugged as I took a seat on the love seat. The moon was covered when we drank the water and was still covered then. Only time would tell if we reacted the same to the moonlight as Aidan.

“I did a little digging while you were gone,” Katelyn started. “About Wolf Creek and the legend.”

“What did you find?” I asked, curiously.

She took a deep breath before seriously info dumping on us. “So, turns out the Native American’s cursed the creek not only to try to drive the settlers away, but to restore balance. You see, the settlers were disrupting the eco system by over hunting the wolf population for sport. Their solution? Kill another wolf and drag its bleeding out corpse into the middle of the creek; one of the settlement’s main access to water let me remind you, on the night of a full moon. The tribe’s medicine men performed a ritual in secret, dancing and drumming all night long until the creek turned red. Then, voila, we got our werewolf cursed creek.”

Us guys looked at one another, processing all that. “There’s a lot to unpack there,” Jonah said.

Katelyn paused, her eyebrows furrowing in concern. “There’s something else-“

She didn’t get to finish her thought as she was interrupted by Aidan returning to consciousness. He came to in another maniacal laughing fit.

“Your time is running out\~”he sang. “You can’t become a werewolf by drinking “cursed creek water,” that’s not how it works! You’re either born into it, like me, or you get bitten and turned.”

“You don’t know that,” I scoffed, coming to a realization. The look on Aidan’s face told me everything I needed to know. “That’s why you didn’t kill Katelyn or Jonah after you escaped and came right for Brandon and I.”

Jonah came to a similar understanding. “He was trying to stop you from drinking the water because if the curse is real, then… he’s *fucked!*”

“N-no!” He lied, squirming in his binds. We’d backed him into a corner, which Aidan didn’t like. “You know what? It doesn’t matter, because your little plan won’t work.”

Brandon smirked as he pointed out of Katelyn’s living room windows. “Looks like we’re about to find out.”

The full moon once again graced us with her presence as her cloudy prison set her free. The moonlight slowly crept through the living room, first landing on Brandon, then me, and finally Aidan.

Brandon stood there, anxiously waiting for something to happen. “Guys, I don’t think-“ suddenly he doubled over, with Aidan following.

“What the fuck!” Brandon swore. His whole body was shaking, and he was drenched in sweat. The muscles underneath his skin rippled, shifting and reforming themselves.

I watched as both Aidan and Brandon’s forms began to change. Confusion set in as I wondered why nothing had happened to me.

“Ack!” I suddenly yelped as a bolt of electricity exploded from the top of my skull all the way down to my big toe. There it was, the start of my of my transformation.

The curse of Wolf Creek, it wasn’t just a legend. It was *real.*

“Ahhhh!” Brandon cried as the skin on his forearm tore open. Instead of blood, matted gray fur poured out of the open wound. Fangs sprouted in his mouth as his nails sharpened into claws. As I began to feel what he was, a loud scream left him as he clutched his sides. “T-this doesn’t feel right!”

“No shit,” Jonah yelled. “You’re turning into a werewolf, there’s nothing natural about that!”

“M-my insides! They feel like they’re on fire!”

“That’s what I was trying to tell you earlier!” Katelyn cut in. “The curse only works on those who are pure of heart!”

“What the hell does that even mean?” Brandon groaned, clutching his sides even harder. He coughed, spitting up black blood into his semi-wolf turned hand. He shuddered at the sight of it.

“Oh no!” She whimpered after seeing the blood.

“Kate-Katelyn! What does that mean?” I yelled as another surge of electricity shocked me.

“Only the pure of heart people were cursed,” she stammered out, “because then they would create the most damage and destruction to their loved ones. The medicine doctors knew there would be those who drank from the creek seeking out the power of the curse. So, the men who drank out of the creek seeking to become the beast, would die during their transformation. Spitting up black blood means you weren’t pure of heart!”

Brandon then began uncontrollably seizing, black blood oozing out of every orifice. His body elongated as his body still attempted the transition. Katelyn cried as she screamed, running into Jonah’s arms for comfort.

“If I’m going to die, d-delete my search history…” Brandon said with his last, gasping breath. His mangled half wolf body slowly writhed until the movements stopped. He’d died a quick, yet torturous, death. At least it was fast.

“Is that- is that going to happen to me?!” I freaked as a tremendous wave of pain knocked me to my knees. A fire was burning beneath my skin as my muscles and bones took on a mind of their own. Brandon’s transformation had started before mine, but I wasn’t too far behind. “I was seeking to become a werewolf too!”

Aidan, who had ripped himself out of his cloth binds, was mainly focused at shifting back into his wolf form. But he began to laugh again. “You idiots!” He grunted, his eyes glowing blue. “You’re practically killing yourselves for me!”

My vision blurred and I slumped forward, the palm of my half turned hand catching the floor and holding me steady. Accepting my fate, I just decided to let go. Everything went dark for a moment.

The night’s events then flashed in my mind. I helped pull Jonah up after tripping on his yard chair. Did the same with Katelyn, and I prevented her from going back to Jack’s corpse earlier. Then risking turning my back on Aidan to warn the old woman. Then, everything exploded into a blinding light.

In a daze, I heard someone go, “hey, he’s not oozing black goo!”

“That might be true, but that does not look like Aidan does!” The other voice replied, frantically.

The voices of my friends pulled me back for a minute. I opened my eyes and… I was different. Taller, bulkier, powerful. The creek’s curse must’ve differed from that of Aidan’s. Whereas he became a literal wolf, I had transformed into a big ball of muscles, fangs, and fur. A real life wolf-man.

I was still me on the inside, able to recognize Katelyn when she said, “Awww! He actually looks kinda cute!” And Jonah, when he made a face at her. She shrugged, the both of them able to tell I was still me. “Yeah, you’re right.”

I spun my massive frame around after a piercing growl shook the house. Anger filled my newly mended bones as Aidan, now a wolf, stood at the end of the connected dining room. He had a similar disdained expression on his muzzle. It was then, when I towered over him, that I realized there never needed to be two of us to take him on. I was stronger than Aidan all on my own. Red filled my vision. I wanted to kill him. I was *going* to kill him.

Aidan huffed one final time before jumping at me. I body slammed him mid air, sending him flying into Katelyn’s kitchen table. I didn’t give him a chance to shake it off, slashing at his abdomen with my large clawed paw. He let out an agonized whine as his breaths got heavier. Poor Katelyn screamed at the carnage. My claws had cut deep, merely an inch away from disemboweling him.

Aidan struggled to stand. The wound was too big and too deep. Though, to my dismay, it had already begun to heal. I’d have to resort to more… drastic measures.

“Oh god damn,” Jonah muttered as I picked Aidan up by his neck with one hand.

He whined and clawed at my hand and wrist trying to break himself free. His choked gasps rang out as I pierced his soul with my deathly glare. My lips curled upward into a smile as I savored the sound of Aidan’s windpipe fracturing after a light squeeze.

The smaller wolf squirmed and shook as he began to wheeze, unable to breathe. I decided I’d put the poor pup out of its misery. Show him the mercy he hadn’t granted me or my friends.

With an earth shattering roar, my free hand sliced against the skin and fur of Aidan’s neck. His decapitated head fell to the floor with a satisfying thud. I chucked the body down next to it, like the filth he was. It was done. Aidan was dead. But, with the night I’d had, his death just seemed so anti-climactic. I needed to do *more.*

I needed to keep killing.

My supernatural hearing tuned into the slight shuffling coming from behind me. I turned to face Katelyn and Jonah.

“You did it!” Katelyn cheered. “You killed him!”

My head turned slightly to the side as I looked at her. The image of Katelyn’s sweet, silky, blood pouring between my fingers filled my minds eye. Red started to seep into the corners of my vision.

I took a step forward.

“Russell?” Jonah questioned, doing the opposite of me and taking a cautionary step back. “You okay, bud?”

This was wrong. What was I thinking of doing?! These people are my friends! I tried to shake the killer thoughts out of my head. I tried to hold onto *myself.*

I huffed, smacking myself. I looked at Katelyn and Jonah once more, hoping they would anchor me back to reality. They looked frightened. Scared.

I wanted to comfort them, but at the same time, the red had taken up most of my vision. A large part of me enjoyed that look on their faces. The smell of fear that wafted off them was almost addictive.

The harder I fought to keep myself in control, the more I felt small pieces of me fall away, replaced by something feral and bloodthirsty.

“Shit, Katelyn,” Jonah muttered, motioning for her to get closer to him. “He’s losing it!”

Katelyn slowly walked back to Jonah. “What do we do?”

Jonah accidentally bumped into the bookshelf against the side wall of the living room in his attempt to get away from me. He lost his balance and stumbled to the floor. Katelyn yelped.

At the same time, red had completely filled my vision as I got pushed into the passenger seat.

Katelyn’s dad’s radio turned on, “What’s Up” by Four Non Blondes blasted at full volume.

The sudden noise startled and pushed me forward. I lunged after Katelyn. She managed to dodge out of the way as I body slammed into the bookshelf. The furniture was crushed by my body weight. Splintered wood, books, and glass figurines flew everywhere.

It didn’t take me long to pick myself up. A snarl left my mouth as I faced her once more. She quivered in a corner, fear rendering her legs useless.

I opened my gaping maw, ready to take a bite out of Katelyn. My jaw snapped as I went in for the kill. Unfortunately, Jonah had threw himself in front of my target. My fangs sunk deep into his forearm instead of Katelyn’s neck. Oh well, he’d have to do.

“Go!”he screamed out in pain, thick rivulets of his blood dripping to the ground. Katelyn, jostled out of her frozen state of shock, did as told and took off. Another yell left his mouth as I bit down harder, cracking his bones.

Jonah used his free hand and began poking at my eye. I shook him off, accidentally releasing his arm. Angrily, I slashed at his face, my claws slicing the skin around his eye open. The sweet sound of his agonizing cries filled my eardrums. Still dazed from my attack, I grabbed him by the neck and lifted him in the air like I’d done with Aidan.

“Rahhhhh!” Katelyn yelled as she charged at me from behind. While I was distracted with Jonah, she had grabbed a sharp wooden piece of her broken dining room table. Without enough time to react, the makeshift spear was thrust into my lower back. Katelyn continued to scream her primal yells as she impaled the piece of wood deeper inside me.

Jonah got flung across the house in the chaos. My pained roar jostled the atoms in the air as the splintered piece of wood emerged out the other side.

Katelyn let out a relieved breath as my hands began to shake and my balanced faltered for a second. In my opinion, she let it out a little too early. I grabbed the bloody piece of wood and thrust it back.

A wet squelch came from behind me. The force of my thrust had pushed the other end of the makeshift spear into Katelyn’s abdomen. I turned around to see the cheerleader stunned, staring at the piece of wood that protruded out of her stomach. A shaky yelp left her mouth as I licked my lips, my wound was already almost done healing.

I simply returned the favor. Grabbing the slick end of the thing, I used my strength to guide it through Katelyn’s intestines and vital organs until it came out of her backside. She groaned in pain, looking at me wide eyed. Delectable fear swelled within them.

With a sadistic chuff, I twisted the wood. She let out another, guttural, scream. An even worse one than before followed as I yanked the piece of wood out entirely.

A gaping hole was left in the girl’s side, her intestines slowly beginning to slide out of it. To prevent that from happening, I punched my fist into the hole, lifting her up in the air and turning her sideways.

The song playing in the background delightfully crescendoed.

“No! No, Russell, please!” Katelyn begged through gasping breaths as I put my other anthropomorphic paw on her hip and began to teasingly tug. Her pleas went unanswered as I tightened my grasp around her and really began pulling. The sound of her flesh stretching and tearing drowned out her death screeches. Like cracking open an egg, Katelyn’s organs began falling out of her lower body as I tore her in half. Her cries diminished not even a second after that. Her eyes faded to gray as one final tug broke her spine apart.

I howled triumphantly, tossing the split girl’s remains away. I’d eat them later, but first I had to finish the hunt and kill Jonah.

Setting out to do just that, my foot lurched forward. Then it halted and my body began to violently convulse. A great fiery pain spread through my veins like a wildfire. I searched frantically for the cause, my eyes landing just outside the living room window.

In all the excitement, I hadn’t realized that dawn had arrived, the sunrise not far behind it. The full moon had sunken behind the horizon, not to rise again for another month. The night was over.

Just as quickly as I transformed and lost myself, my body began to change back to normal. The stress of the night and the pain was so overwhelming that I blacked out. It didn’t help that I crashed face first into the floor either.

The last trills of the song faded away as I sunk deeper and deeper into unconsciousness.

“Hey, this one’s breathing!” Someone shouted loudly next to my ear, waking me up. “Sole survivor is a young male. His clothes have been torn to shreds and he’s drenched in blood!” The next thing I knew, a blinding light was being shone in my eyes. “Hello? Sir, can you hear me? What happened here?!”

I rubbed the stinging out of my eyes. My vision was blurry and the events of last night were hazy. “W-wolf,” I stuttered out.

Who I now realized was a paramedic reported that back to her superior. “Just like we thought, another animal attack! First Wolf Creek Road and now this?!”

“Katelyn… Jonah?” I groggily mumbled, sitting up with the aid of the paramedic. I turned my head to see the damage but she covered my eyes and had me look at her.

“You don’t want to see that,” she solemnly said. “Your friends didn’t make it.”

“W-what happened to them?” I asked becoming more lucid.

The paramedic paused, debating if she should divulge that information to Me. After a moment of contemplation, she decided to let me know. “Carnage. That’s what’s happened to them. Worst of all, we think the wolf may have dragged one of the bodies back out into the woods with it. There’s a chance they’re still alive, but it’s slim. We have a team combing that area right now as we speak.”

I threw up. Not from the paramedic’s words, but from the memories of attacking Jonah and Katelyn and tearing Aidan to pieces rushing in. I remembered drinking the water from Wolf Creek and turning into a werewolf.

If one of us was unaccounted for then… That must mean Jonah was the one she was talking about. I remember slashing at his eye, but not killing him.

I was brought out of my thoughts as two more paramedics joined us with a stretcher. They put a C-collar around my neck and loaded me up. It was useless. I was completely healed and most of the blood on my clothes weren’t even mine. For a sense of normalcy and to quell any suspicion, I let them take me.

As they started rolling me out to an ambulance, a slip of paper fell out of my tattered pocket.

“Oops, you dropped this,” a male paramedic said, handing me the slip of paper. “Here ya go.”

I grabbed it, curiously. To my knowledge, there hadn’t been anything in that pocket to begin with. When I unfolded it, I found a note, scribbled haphazardly and in a rush. That note read:

*I’m still alive.*

My eyes widened in shock. The paramedics had to hold me down by my chest as I began thrashing around. A panic attack enveloped me and I felt like I was suffocating.

I’d bitten him. Jonah. Aidan had said something earlier in the night about being born cursed or it transferring through a bite. Did the Wolf Creek curse work the same as his?

My sense of dread worsened as I was loaded into the back of an ambulance. I swore someone was watching me from just beyond the tree line from Katelyn’s backyard.

It really hit home that last night was real when the Coroner started rolling the blood stained sheet covered corpses of my friends out of the house. That was the last thing I saw before the doors slammed shut and the ambulance began its journey to the hospital.

So, I implore you, don’t drink the water of Wolf Creek on the night of a full moon. Other wise you’ll end up just… like… *me.*
