 Throughout my life, I have been witness to some crazy shit. I know, jumping the gun with my intro, but I want to be blunt here. I will be lying or saying false info at no point throughout this story. Everything I say is the absolute truth. 

 When I was in my teen years (I am now 25,) my family moved to this beautiful acreage in Saskatchewan. It was a decent-sized place, but the interior was open and huge. There were two bedrooms, one master bedroom, two bathrooms, a full kitchen, a wine cellar, and a huge backyard. 

 It had been my mother's dream to live on an acreage, and now she had it. Since dad got a better job paying more, we decided to move somewhere nicer. My younger brothers were ecstatic to live somewhere with a big yard since our last place did not have a big one. Personally, I wasn't the biggest fan of the move. I left all my friends behind, and the place did not feel like home. But whatever, everyone outvoted me, and now I have to live with it.

 I got the bigger of the two bedrooms since I am the oldest. The first day, I went in, decked the place with posters, furniture, and lights, and made my own personal utopia. Doing this made it feel better, more like home. Once I was done, I went out and helped my parents move other stuff in. Brought in my bed, the couch, and many other things that I am too tired to name. The place was really coming together, and the day had gone smoothly.

 Everything stayed relatively lovely for the first few weeks. My brothers and I got comfortable with the new school, we made some new friends, and things were just coming together. In the fourth or fifth week, signs started to show.

 The first sign happened on Monday. I was lying in bed when I started hearing scratching on the inside of the wall. It sounded like mice or rats. Mom and Dad heard it too. I could hear them talking about it while in their room. Dad said he would get some rat poison and put it in places of the house. No big deal. Just mice on an acreage.

 The next night, I remember hearing the house shift and creak in the blowing wind. It was dark in my room, and I was used to the noise, so I just listened while looking up at the roof. 

 Suddenly, I heard something that sounded like mud being dropped onto the floor on the other side of my room. I sat up to look in the direction of it. With the light of the moon helping me see, I swear I saw a part of the wall in an almost blob-like shape on my bedroom floor. I just watched it because I didn't want to get out of bed. 

 After watching it for a few minutes, I realized that the shape resembled that of a person in the fetal position, and if this was what it was, then the head was titled and staring directly back at me. Now, I do not know if I saw this or if my mind was playing tricks on me, but when I kept watching, I swear I could see two white specks where the eyes were meant to be, staring directly at me. 

 I must have been tired because I fell asleep while watching it. When I woke up, it was gone. I kept it to myself, thinking it was some kind of weird lucid dream, but throughout the day, I kept thinking about it and its odd shape. I wasn't too worried; it was a dream, after all.

 The next night I heard my brothers scream. When I went in and checked on them, I saw them both in shock, staring at the wall across from them, huddled up on the floor by their window. I asked them what was wrong, and they started explaining that a man was in the corner of their room. That threw me off, and I think I even went pale. 

 I started going around the room, checking their closets, vents, behind their door, and under their bed, and found absolutely nothing but toys and dust. That night I slept in their room so that they could stop worrying. I was also pretty scared.

 The following day, mom and dad were missing. We figured they probably had late-night business shit to get to but had little time to warn us, so they just left. They left an apology note on the countertop, saying they had a long day. We went to school like normal and hung out with our friends, coming home later with Mom and Dad in their beds, already asleep. I went to sleep before my brothers that night, which I regret.

 That night, I woke up three hours later, hearing my brothers happily chatting with someone. I close my eyes hard and try to block them out, but suddenly I hear what sounds like a panicked breath before it is muted. I sit up and listen, but my brothers are no longer talking. Instead, I hear what sounds like crunching. 

 I get up from my bed and slowly make my way out, going to my brother's bedroom. I thought they had chips or something. I do not know what I was thinking, but when I opened that door, I sealed an image away in my mind, one which I wish I could forget.

 I saw blood everywhere around the room. In the center of it, I saw this thing that looked like a werewolf on all fours, eating my lifeless brothers' bodies. I was in complete shock. I didn't know what to make of this; I was utterly frozen in fear.

 I backed out of the room and walked to my parent's room. I felt empty. There is no emotion I could describe to say how far I was gone. When I entered their room, it looked identical to my brothers' room, covered in blood. I simply stared and was unmoving until I heard a voice over my shoulder. 

 "Hello."

 I turned around to see an older man standing in front of me. He was covered in blood, and his eyes were almost like pinholes filled with white. I was utterly horrified. I didn't even move or open my mouth to scream. I just stared. 

 He stood there unmoving before speaking, "I am full." 

 He then turned sideways and walked into the wall, merging with it and disappearing from sight. I stayed completely still for what felt like an eternity before moving. Once I did, I left the house.

 In the time of thirty minutes, I had lost my entire family. To this day, I do not understand what happened. I went to the town and got the police. When they returned to the house, they acted like this was normal. They seemed completely unfazed, maybe a bit bothered, but unfazed. They later told me that they considered it an animal attack due to the claw marks in the ground and the brutality there was.

 I am not crazy. I know what I saw. I watched my family die because of the thing in the wall, and no one believed me. I do not know what to do. So I am writing this in hopes that someone will fucking believe me.
