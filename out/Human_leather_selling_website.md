I found a website by the name of Urban Outraged. Urban Outraged didn’t deal in leather, wool, or cotton. No, the fabric of choice was something far more unsettling: human skin.

How was this possible? And who would dare wear such clothes? No one, right? 

Anyways, back to the story. Urban Outraged was a literal nightmare. They used HUMAN SKIN for clothes like belts, jackets and shoes. That's why if you go on the website, you can see blood, weird patterns, human teeth used for boots and gory stuff. I even saw human meat! Disgusting, right? Do not go on the website. Please, please PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not go on the website. From the Avery coat to the Richard belt, these are made out of human goods, as said. I was petrified seeing a website about selling human leather goods. Why? Why would the creators do such a thing? 

Imagine how sad and horrified the people who used to have skin, now skinless (like Avery) they are. I honestly do not know if they are insane maniacs. I think they are. THIS IS NOT MADE UP. I AM SERIOUS. 

Seriously. Who would make a website about SELLING literal HUMAN SKIN!? None of you, right? Who is so cruel to actually do that???????

To the uninitiated, the idea sounded like a tasteless gimmick, a dark satire of fashion’s willingness to push the boundaries of taste and decency.

I do not recommend going on this site. Don't say I didn't warn you...

This website contains a creepy, unimaginable zone. The zone is called the Afterlife Collection.

The Afterlife collection is where you can put somebodies name in it. No, not to recognize them but to USE THEIR SKIN AND MAKE A LITERAL ITEM OUT OF THEIR POOR SKIN. NO I AM NOT KIDDING. 

*“When it comes to ripping off skin, a living being is a living being. Why is it okay to raise sheep just to shear off their wool? Why is it okay to kill a cow for leather? Why aren’t you horrified by what’s already in your closet?”*

-Urban Outraged

I truly think that the Urban Outraged creators are vegans. It is okay to shear a sheep. Seriously? SERIOUSLY?

*“Every year, billions of animals suffer and die for wool, cashmere, leather, down, mohair, silk, and alpaca fleece production. Sheep are often beaten, stomped on, and kicked in the wool industry. Goats exploited for cashmere scream out in pain and terror as workers tear out their hair with sharp metal combs. Later, their throats are slit in slaughterhouses, and they’re left to die in agony. And cows are routinely beaten and electroshocked for leather at some of the largest suppliers.”*

This is true, but you don't have to make HUMAN SKINNED ITEMS. 

For them they think it's okay. But it's seriously NOT. No. You are using HUMAN SKIN to make ITEMS. Is that okay? 

First we have animal cruelty, now we have HUMAN CRUELTY?

This is used for raising awareness to animal cruelty, but now you are using literal HUMAN SKIN to make your products.

Do not search Urban Outraged up. You will truly regret it.
