You don’t know what’s coming.

We have watched you for so long that we understand your kind better than you do yourselves. You stand on the brink of destruction, and yet you convince yourselves it is progress. You reach for the stars, never grasping the void they conceal. When the Velatros Coalition arrives, you will not see them as saviors. You will destroy them.

And we will ensure it.

The Velatros Coalition believes in you. They have watched your species as we have, marveling at your art, your resilience, your ability to create beauty even amid chaos. They will come bearing gifts—cures for your sicknesses, solutions for the heat and ruin you have wrought, and technologies to lift you into the stars.

You will reject them.

When their ships descend in July 2026, your leaders will not see salvation. They will see invaders. You will respond as we have prepared you to: with fire.

It has always been this way.

This is not your planet. Long before you walked upright, it was ours. We came here broken, fleeing the collapse of a vast empire that once stretched across the stars. We were survivors, battered but determined. Earth became our refuge, a sanctuary to rebuild.

Then you arrived.

At first, we saw you as little more than clever animals. Your sparks of brilliance amused us but did not concern us. Then, slowly, those sparks grew. You built. You dreamed. You pushed at the boundaries of what your world allowed, and then you shattered them.

Your potential terrified us.

We saw in you what we had seen in ourselves: a species capable of greatness, but also destruction. We could not let you rise unchecked. Earth had become all we had left. We could not risk losing it again—not to you, and certainly not to the Velatros Coalition.

We began to act.

When the first craft fell in Mussolini’s Italy in 1933, your leaders believed they had found visitors from another star. They were wrong. What they recovered was not alien—it was human. A desperate warning sent back through time by your future selves.

We got there first.

We took the wreckage, the bodies, the strange machines built to traverse not space but time. We studied them, unraveling their secrets. What we found horrified us.

The warnings weren’t just for you. They were for us.

Your future selves knew what was coming: nuclear fire, fallout, extinction. The Velatros Coalition would come offering salvation, but your paranoia—our paranoia—would turn their mission into catastrophe. The Earth would burn, and the survivors would retreat underground.

You would change.

Generations of survival in darkness would twist your bodies into something unrecognizable. Wide eyes to drink in the dim light, pale skin to conserve energy, shrunken forms. You would become the creatures you call Greys.

But we would burn too.

The fallout would poison us as surely as it would you. Even with all we learned from your warnings, even with the shields we built and the adaptations we crafted, the slow death of a poisoned world cannot be stopped.

So we changed the game.

In 1947, when another craft fell in Roswell, we knew what had to be done. We couldn’t stop the coming fire, but we could control it. Every piece of wreckage, every artifact, every trace of your future—these became tools for our survival.

We sent agents forward into the far future, to the age of your descendants. We saw what you would become, clawing for survival in the ruins of what once was. We positioned ourselves there, ensuring our dominance across time itself.

Your future is no longer your own.

The stories you tell—of lights in the skies, of abductions, of beings with pale skin and dark, endless eyes—those were planted by us. The myths, the conspiracies, the glimpses of something otherworldly: all breadcrumbs we scattered to guide your paranoia.

When the Velatros Coalition arrives, you will destroy them, just as we have ensured. You will ignite the skies, unleashing everything you have.

And when the fire consumes the world, we will survive.

We are not like you. We do not cling to hope or sentiment. We learned long ago that survival is not about compromise. It is about control. By steering you toward destruction, we secure our future.

Even now, as your leaders begin to speak of disclosure, as they hint at the truths buried beneath decades of secrecy, you believe you are uncovering the answers to the universe. You believe you are learning the truth about extraterrestrial life.

You are not.

The hearings, the footage, the stories told by your pilots and soldiers—they are not the revelations you think they are. We allowed you to see them. They are tools, nothing more. Every piece of the puzzle we’ve shown you leads to one outcome: when the Velatros arrive, you will destroy them.

It is necessary.

The Velatros would lift you into the stars, and in doing so, they would strip us of everything we have built. They do not see the chaos in you, the recklessness. They do not understand what we learned long ago: you cannot be trusted.

When the fire comes, we will endure.

The surface will belong to us, fortified by the technologies we took from your future. Across time, from past to future, we will remain. Your kind will fade, retreating into the darkness beneath the Earth. You will adapt, but you will not rise again.

And we will watch over the ruins of what you left behind.

You cannot stop what is coming. This is not a warning. This is inevitability.
