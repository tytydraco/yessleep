I don’t really know how to do a proper intro to this type of thing. I just want to get to the point. My cousin Peter wasn’t returning my aunt’s phone calls and texts for 2 days straight, so she went to his house and used the spare key to get inside after Peter didn’t come to the door.

What she told the officers (and my mom) was that she found all his things untouched. His car was still parked in the driveway, none of his things were taken, and there were no signs of a break-in.

Basically, it was like he vanished into thin air. The only out of place thing that was found was Peter’s phone laying face-down in the hallway upstairs.

Authorities searched his phone, but all they found was a bunch of missed voicemails and texts from friends and relatives begging him to answer. The phone was returned to my aunt, and with her too distraught to notice, I took the phone.

I know it was wrong, but I was six at the time and barely understood what had happened to my cousin anyway. I just saw a free phone and took my opportunity to take it and download some games and watch YouTube. After a while of using the phone for dumb kid stuff, I got a notification from the “notes” app telling me to pick up where I left off.

I hadn’t used the notes app since getting my hands on the phone, so I was curious as to what my cousin had been writing before he lost his phone. I didn’t understand the weight of my findings at the time, but I’ve recently heard of an internet phenomenon known as the Backrooms, and it brought back memories of what Peter had described in his final set of notes.

I’ve since grown up and moved out of my old family house, but I managed to find the old phone and get it charged up again. It took an awkward text to my aunt asking what the password to Peter’s old phone was, but I managed to unlock the phone and reread my cousins’ last few messages before he… well, you’ll know what I mean after I share them with you.

But why am I posting this here of all places? Well, for starters, the messages sound like some sick prank, so the authorities and my relatives wouldn’t believe me even if I showed them the messages. It also might cause my aunt unwanted grief over something that happened so long ago, which leads me to my final reason: it’s just been too much time. The case has been closed, and my aunt has finally recovered all that she can.

But even if I can’t tell anyone my findings, I can still make sure Peter’s last messages to the world don’t go unseen. I can’t help but feel some guilt for not telling anyone what I found, so maybe I’m also doing this to clear my conscience.

But I’ve been on about this too long. Let me just show you what I found.

 

 

*July 3, 2003*

I’ve tried telling my friends about the door, but they just don’t believe me. It doesn’t help that the door always disappears whenever I try to show them. It doesn't appear in pictures either, and after a quick examination of my house from the outside, there doesn’t seem to be a room behind the door. It’s just not possible. I want to see what’s behind it. I really do. I just get this feeling of… dread when I go to open it. I need some sleep

 

*July 4, 2003 (This was written past midnight, so it’s counted as a new day)*

I can’t sleep. Every time I do, I have the same dream. It starts off fine, normal, actually. I’m downstairs watching something on TV, I can’t remember what. For some reason, I can’t help but feel like I’m being watched from my staircase, but I can’t turn to look. Eventually, the power goes out, and I can move. I go upstairs to get a flashlight from my room, and the door is wide open. It’s so dark that I can’t see what’s on the other side, but I feel whatever it is calling me. My legs start to carry me towards the door, and I wake up. I’m so fucking tired.

 

*July 6, 2003*

I can’t. I just can’t. I want to cover the door, but I’m scared to get close to it. I keep having the same dream, but when I wake up I’m in my hallway in front of the door. One time, I woke up with my hand moving towards the handle. I told my mom about it, but I couldn’t show her any pictures. I’m scared.

 

*July 9, 2003*

No one can help me. No one believes me. I’ve been staying in a motel for the past few days. I can’t be in the same house as that door, but I see it in my dreams. Now the dream doesn’t even start off fine, It’s just me standing in front of the door in a dark hallway. I’m fucking done. I’m opening the door, and I’m ending this shit.

 

 

*July 10, 2003*

I’m in a new place now. The rooms keep repeating. How is this even possible? There is no time in this place. My only way of measuring time is my phone’s clock. No one can help.

 

*July 10, 2003 (All his new messages are written on the same day, but he writes them like it’s been days since the last)*

Every door leads to a new room. There are kitchens, bedrooms, living rooms and bathrooms. There are no clocks, but there is food and water. There is no windows, but there are places to sleep and use the bathroom. Hell, there’s even toothbrushes and toothpaste here. Someone could get lost in here forever.

 

*July 10, 2003*

I’ve mapped out as many rooms as I can. I’ve got a bit more knowledge on the layout of this place. It’s an infinite place. It provides for those inside it. But it never lets them leave.

 

 

*July 10, 2003*

Something is wrong. I know now which rooms I’ve already been in, but things have been moved around. Beds that I’ve slept in already have been made, fridges have been left open with food missing. Someone is here with me. I need to find them.

 

*July 10, 2003*

 I saw them. I chased them. I lost my way. I’m lost again, but this time it’s different. The rooms are cold. The carpets are damp. The lights are dim. The fridges are empty. The shower curtains are filled with mold. I’m being watched.

 

*July 10, 2003*

This place isn’t the same. The rooms are entirely different. They are dark concrete chambers with barely any light. I’m going to die here. Im going to die here Im going to die here Im going to die

 

 

*July 10, 2003*

They keep scratching at the walls. Their screams ring in my ears. Im so cold. Their hands grab at my arms, my feet, my neck, they want to keep me here with them.

 

*July 10, 2003*

Something has changed. They seem more desperate to keep me here. They tell me to turn back, that Im going to get hurt. But I think I’m getting close to the end. God help me.

 

*July 10, 2003*

I found my way back to the door. Not the one from my house, but the one from my dream. And I know now what’s on the other side. It’s… horrifying. Their bodies writhe in agony, their cries for mercy echo into the void. They yell as if anyone can hear them. And on top of his throne of mangled flesh and bone, there he sits. The one who’s been calling me back to the door. I can barely even describe him. He almost looks like

I don’t even know what to think. I don’t remember the messages sounding like that. I don’t know what even happened to Peter anymore. I think he must’ve had some kind of mental breakdown, unless I want to believe what he wrote about in his final messages is really true. I just don’t know anymore.

My findings have only reinforced my decision not to tell anyone in my family about this. This is my weight to carry, since maybe we could’ve tracked him down in time to stop him from disappearing completely if I had just told my family about what I found all those years ago.

I don’t even think it matters much now anyway. As much as I want to believe that everything Peter described wasn’t true, I just can’t convince myself anymore. It may have been coincidence, but last night I fell asleep and had one of the worst nightmares I’ve had in a while.

I’m standing in front of a blood red door, with darkness all around me. It’s cold in this place, so cold I want to shiver, but I can’t. I’m paralyzed. I’m helpless to do anything but watch as the door swings open, and I gaze into what’s beyond. A swirling void of madness and tortured souls, begging me to turn back.

And in the center of it all, there he sits.
