[So about the other day. I technically did write about the little asshole…](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/z5eLwZDRmV) just not the wait it expected. Once I hit post it lost its grin and just disappeared.

I took a breather at this moment. Trying to enjoy a minute of peace. It had been ages since the house was quiet for once. 

Ring, ring, ring…

Damnit! My landline rang. There was only one person who called that old phone. Detective Louise D. Morgan. She had been the reason me and my sister weren't in jail. None of us were dumb. We didn't try pulling the knife out. We barely move. So the detective, after a long process, managed to convince a judge about our innocence. How? No idea. 

“Hello.” There was no answer. 

“Detective?” 

“Hello, Carl.” Answer a voice I recognized instantly.

“What? What the fuck?!”

“Shut up and listen. I won't repeat myself.”

“How dare you l. You disgusting monster. You killed my mom and now you want me to listen? Are you fucking stupid?!” I raged. It wasn't sudden. I wanted that fuck to fucking hear me. 

After a bunch of insults and vulgarities it finally spoke again. 

“I can hang up right now, but that would be your biggest mistake so if you want to listen just stay in the line, otherwise just hang up yourself.” Its disgusting voice was so calming and scary at the same time. 

I said nothing but I didn't hang up. So it started speaking.

“This is a warning. That happy guy only stops smiling once you piss him off. You can try to cut him. Shoot him. Even try send him back to hell and he'll never stop smiling. He's a kind soul. Until you disappoint him. It can be because you didn't give him candy or… because you didn't want to write nice things about him. Petty shit like that.”

That sounded fake but the fact we were all in this situation made me feel like it was more than serious. Was it the master of lies or was it telling me this out of pity?  

“So..”

“Shut up.” It cut me off. “The grinning man is the embodiment of grief, sadness and all of the negative emotions related to those. And you just pissed him off.”

Click…

It hung up. 

I didn't realize it was already 5 pm. I posted at 12 because I have work to do in 2 hours. How?

Just like on cue I heard my sister wake up crying. I ran so fast I almost knocked the door off its hinges.

“I COULDN'T WAKE UP! I COULDN'T WAKE UP. CARL I SAW MOM! I SAW MOM!!”

“It was a dream. Just a dream, that's all.” I tried calming her down. Big mistake.

“DON'T FUCKING TELL ME THAT.”
 
I saw a mixture of sadness, anger and disappointment. Most likely for trying to pass it up as a simple dream when we were living in a hell house. 

“I'm sorry, I fell into a movie cliche trying to calm you down. It was so stupid. I'm sorry.” I told her. 

She chuckled a bit but couldn't stop crying. 

“I saw mom die in a third person perspective. I saw me, you and mom.” she paused for a second to catch her breath. “He wasn't there. She just fell to the ground over and over again. I lost count after a thousand.” she said with sadness in her voice. 

I felt bad for her but I got angry at the fact she had called it a him. Those weren't humans. Not to me and since they killed mom I hated the fact she would use those pronouns to refer to them. I tried to control my anger. Thankfully just like in the movies I saw an eye peeking through a little opening of my sister's closet. It was the grinning thing. Happy again now that it had tortured my sister for hours. 

I said nothing and launched at it without warning. The moment I tackled it we both fell into the closet. It was bigger. And so was it. Laughing like a maniac it started throwing me to the walls. They were frozen. It proceeded to grab me by the arm and spin me around as my body clashed once again against the frozen walls of the gigantic inside of the small closet. It finally let me go.

“What's happening?” Karla asked me confused. 

“What? You didn't see that?”

“All I saw was you jumping into my closet, slipping and that's it.” 

What was the time for these monsters? This was bad, bad news.

It tried to stand up. But the damage was real. It wasn't an illusion. I got beat up. For me it was at least 10 minutes. For my sister it was just a second. To her I wasn't fully inside it. How did their powers work? Some sort of reality bending?

I got a fractured and dislocated shoulder. Several broken ribs. And a broken nose. 


Our world was, to say the least, garbage. I received several beatings. My sister was torture several times in 3 months. We were starting to give up.

I picked up the habit of smoking. Only thing I could do since I had to stay alert everytime Karla woke up after her endless loops of despair. It happened everywhere and I had a demon of my own to deal with. A female looking monster obsessed with sleeping with me. Everytime I opened my eyes it was there looking at me an inch away from my face. But that night something else woke me up. The bitch wasn't there. Nothing was there except a little noise in the kitchen. A chair being dragged. And someone stepping on it. How did I know? No idea but I ran like hell just as Karla was about to put a rope around her neck. I jumped so high we flew across the kitchen and landed on the table. She was shaking and unresponsive. 

“Baby sis, I don't know if you can hear me but I promise you, from now on we will fight back. From now on we fight for the right to stay alive.
