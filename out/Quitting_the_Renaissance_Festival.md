“Damn, Nikkie... I can see why they cast you as the virgin sacrifice…” I tried sounding confident as I gave my coworker a hungry stare. It probably came across as desperate. “Does Logan pay extra? When you get all sexy?”

“Does Logan pay extra?” Nikkie batted her eyes and swished her ponytail in my face. “Of course he pays extra.” Nikkie was delicious, and I had fallen head over heels. “You clean up real nice yourself, Miss Priya Choudhry.”

“Two minutes!” Logan, the general manager, plodded backstage. “Oy, ladies!” Logan grumbled to us in his cockney accent. “Quit messin’ around. This here’s the grand finale of our entire bloody season. We got big money waitin’ on us, so knock off the foreplay!”

“Did you hear that?” I adjusted the faux Egyptian headpiece, assessing my budget costume in the mirror. Logan swore at us to hurry before disappearing back on stage. 

“Who cares?” Nikkie buffed a speck of highlighter onto her flawless cheek. “This gig sucks! For some stupid reason? I thought working a renaissance festival would be fun.”

“You’re not having fun?”

“Oy, Priya!” Nikkie mimicked Logan. “Ya reckon we’re in Hogwarts? Floor ain’t sweepin’ itself, love.” I couldn’t help but chuckle. “Now come ‘n give me smelly bollocks a tickle, would ya?”

“Bollocks?” I shook my head.

“Not your thing, either?” Nikkie sighed. “Logan’s a tool… And what’s with this female sacrifice garbage?” Clearly irritated, Nikkie tossed her script to the floor. “I’ll bet you Logan wrote this masterpiece himself.”

“You seem miffed.”

“That’s because I am! A late night, invite-only, ‘grand finale’ that wasn’t on the program? Logan hits us up as we’re leaving? Asking if we wanna do the scene for double pay? I just don’t like the way they run this dumpster fire.”

“Double pay, though.”

“True,” Nikkie conceded. Past the curtain, Logan blew into the microphone. His wet and sloppy mike-checks were infamous. “Looks like the show is starting. Where’s Rahul?”

“Rahul?” I glanced around. “Must be working the lights. I’m sure he agreed to stay for the extra cash.” Nikkie knew about Rahul’s addiction issues and said nothing. “But, uh… What’ll you do next, Nikkie? After tonight?”

“After tonight?” Nikkie was so good-looking that I had trouble focusing on her words. That’s how I always felt around her, and I secretly prayed each morning that Nikkie would fall in love with me. “I honestly don’t know what I’ll do… Guess I’ve gotta figure that out. Prolly make my way back home, or something.”

“Really? You’ll go back to Oregon?” Do, it Priya… Do it now. “That’s a long drive.” You knew this moment was coming, Priya… This is your last chance! Ask Nikkie to stay for Halloween! “But, uh… I suppose going back home to Oregon… kinda makes sense?”

“Does it?” Nikkie smiled coyly. “You sure, Miss Choudhry? Are you sure I shouldn’t stay?”

“Ladies ‘n gentlemen!” Logan’s voice bellowed through the speakers as medieval horns sounded in celebration. “Welcome! My name is Logan P. Lazard. I’m the lifelong proprietor of the Lazard Caretaker Renaissance Festival.” 

The microphone screeched as we took our positions. Nikkie had sidetracked me from the script, but if memory served, I was supposed to start the ‘holy prophecy’ by reading an ‘ancient scroll’ before the ‘virgin blood sacrifice.’ 

“The Decision is not known to any of us beforehand. When Her Majesty decides: we abide Her Will without question.” The heck was Logan blabbing about?  “And NONE shall address HER directly, upon pain of DEATH.” 

Nikkie pretended to gag as I suppressed the urge to laugh. It seemed Logan had gone all out with his introduction for tonight.

But, something was making me uneasy…

Working here all season, I was accustomed to the hubbub of the crowd. Except – in this moment – you could hear a pin drop.

Again, the burst of trumpets. Nikkie gave me a whack on the butt and wished me good luck. 

“Break a leg, sexy!”

Flustered for some reason, I took the papyrus scroll the stagehand passed me and stumbled through the red velvet curtain.

Squinting in the brightness, I noticed my brother, Rahul, manning the spotlight high above. He smiled and waved at me.

I took a breath, and when my eyes adjusted to the glare, I felt immediately queasy. 

The rafters of our theater were typically filled with tipsy rednecks and their screaming devil children. But not tonight… 

Before me, each seat was filled with gaunt, serpent-skinned geriatrics dressed in the finest evening wear I had ever seen.

The men wore designer suits and ties that probably cost more than my Corolla. 

The women were dripping in gemstones that glittered harshly in the hazy light. 

Just a bunch of rich, wrinkly fucks, is what it seemed. Everyone was dead silent… 

“Priya!” Logan hissed. 

“Huh?” 

“Line!” 

“Oh–” I gulped, frozen in place, my hands struggling to unfurl the scroll. As instructed earlier by Logan, I began to read the calligraphy inscription. “*Brothers and sisters! Welcome! Be at peace, for you are amongst family. We gather here for divine purpose. Hail Amun-Ra! The transcendent!*”

I was profoundly alarmed when the crowd mimicked that last bit in unison:

“**HAIL AMUN-RA! THE TRANSCENDENT!**”

I searched for Logan, who had re-positioned himself off-stage, slightly behind me. 

Logan grinned eagerly – smiling from ear to ear – and nodded for me to continue.

“*Oh, beloved Queen!*” I glanced at Rahul. My brother shrugged. “*We are humbled by thy Sight*.” Just read it, Priya… Get paid and leave. “*You are Amunet! The Hidden One! Shadow of the Ogdoad.”* It’s the final show of the season. We’ll never have to work here again. “*Allow these vile geese, these filthy castaways, these blood sausages to honor thy covenant. May our offering earn us sixteen years of light!*”

The crowd, like an eager echo:

“**SIXTEEN YEARS OF LIGHT!**”

Then – out of the main speakers – the most peculiar singing drifted across the stage.

*A garbled frequency.* 

*Ugly, low and guttural.*

The audience murmured ominously as these chanting sounds intensified.

Bum… 

Bum… 

**BUMP.**

I let slip a squeak of worry as the stage shook with the thump of tribal drums.

Bum… 

Bum… 

**BUMP.**

“What the hell?” I muttered.

My jaw fell loose as the curtain parted, and four immensely muscular men moved silently onto the stage. 

Was this part of the scene? 

Fuck… I felt like an idiot for not reading the script more carefully…

These actors were like Nubian princes! 

Bodies hewn from obsidian. Each immaculately hairless and adorned in resplendent attire. 

Ruby-entwined chains draped their titanium pectorals, hulking quads and rippling forearms. 

Between them, the men hoisted a miniature, uncovered golden palanquin that was inlaid with apple-sized emeralds and sapphires. 

Sitting atop this litter was a bell-shaped, stainless-steel plate cover. Kinda like the type they’d use at a fancy French restaurant. 

The crowd murmured in awe…

Again, I glanced up at Rahul. Silently mouthing my concern. My brother returned the baffled look. Logan’s only instructions to us at this point had been: stay still and keep quiet.

The four men – sweating profusely – moved to center stage. I jumped sideways to make room as they lowered the palanquin. 

Three of the four actors stepped back and – while facing the litter – kneeled down, arms stretched out in front of them. Bowing forward until their heads touched the ground. 

The chanting from the speakers increased, and I discerned an unsettling HUMMING from the crowd. A palpable, buzzing energy. 

The actor who remained standing reached forward and gently lifted the domed covering from the litter, before bowing low. 

The crowd gasped. 

Oohing and aahing like they had seen something astonishing… 

Something magical. 

Obviously, I couldn’t help but look for myself, squinting and rubbing my eyes incredulously before snorting with laughter. 

“Seriously?” I was astounded.

Plopped under the dome was the cutest (and certainly the fattest) kitty I had ever seen!

I love cats, and this was a rare one… A blue Egyptian Mau. I was pretty sure of it. They’re plain awesome, from what I’ve read. One of the oldest breeds. Although this poor kitty definitely needed a diet. I knew enough about animals to recognize it was legit obese.

This big, chonky feline was just sitting there, licking its paws without a care in the world. The best part was that this adorable, whiskered pudge lord had been decked out with literally the sickest-looking cat costume you can imagine. It was beyond epic:

There was an ornate, silver-wrought tiara perched between its furry ears. A brilliant diamond necklace, detailed with gorgeous hieroglyphics, hung across its shoulders. 

It must be a royal kitty, I thought to myself, smirking with something akin to admiration. What I loved the most was that – despite its outfit – the cat looked utterly displeased.

Suddenly, the speakers went dead. 

Another one of those Nubian princes stepped onto the stage, dragging Nikkie – who looked absolutely terrified – by her wrists.

“Priya!” Nikkie screamed. “Help!”

“Hey!” I stepped forward. “What-“

Before I could intervene,  my entire body seized. It felt like a straitjacket had wrapped itself around my torso. Paralyzing me. 

With a jolt of panic: I realized another one of those gargantuan actors had snuck up from behind and grabbed me. I tried yelling – to warn the audience that none of this was staged – but his massive hand covered my mouth, swallowing my cries as I struggled to escape. 

“MM-MMM!” my voice was muffled. 

I’ve never been so scared… I’ve never been so scared in my life! This asshole assaulting me was unbelievably tough. I tried biting his fingers and almost puked. His hands were like leather… The skin dusty and callused. 

The bastard attacking Nikkie forced her to kneel in front of the cat. I saw the kitty sit up with interest, its gaze affixing upon my friend. 

Nikkie went limp. Her screeches faded as she returned the bizarre stare and began addressing the cat in a fawning manner:

“Oh, your Majesty!” Nikkie spoke adoringly, her voice washing over the rapt attendees. The fucker holding Nikkie released his grip, but she didn’t even try making a run for it. “What honeyed pleasure! To bow before you!” The crowd muttered approvingly. “Oh, yes!” 

I paused my struggle and gawked. Was this… was this crazy fucking shit some kinda *setup?* 

“Oh, yes! Oh, yes, yes, YES!” 

What the actual fuck! Nikkie sounded like she was getting off! This lunatic had my face in a vice, yet Nikkie didn’t seem to give a shit!

“Speak through me, Amunet! Use this vile goose, this filthy castaway! This blood sausage!” Nikkie closed her eyes, the cat watching her every move. The room became still as Nikkie cried. “I beg you, my Queen!”

And then, I swear it: that fat fucking kitty’s eyes began to flicker with an otherworldly glow. 

A deep, menacing, crimson radiance like I had never seen! How did Logan pull that off?

Illuminated contacts? 

On an animal? 

At this point - after being manhandled by Logan’s goons - I couldn’t put it past him. 

Nikkie began yelling.

Chastising the audience.

“**PUTRIDITY?** IS THIS WHAT SLIMY WRETCHES PLACE BEFORE THE DIVINE?” I saw Logan turn white. Those hunched in the stands cowered in their seats. “A CLOTTED STAIN?” Several spectators were now sobbing in horror. “TAKE HEED OF OUR COVENANT, VILE GEESE. LEST WE ARE TICKLED BY COMPULSION TO EXCRETE THY SOULS INTO SUCH DARKEST VOIDS.” At this point, I wasn’t even fighting the motherfucker who grabbed me. I was waiting for the hidden camera show producers to bust onto the stage. “CONFIDENCE IN THY CARETAKING WAVERS, LOGAN P. LAZARD.”

“I’m s – sorry...” Logan uttered. He sounded like he was wetting his pants. “Please…!”

Nikkie didn’t reply; a moment later, the strangest smile crept across her face. It was an expression of absolute, resonant peace. 

The audience was silent. Nothing happened for a few seconds. Then Nikkie twitched, and I realized her expression was changing. 

The grin was still plastered on her face… but Nikkie started to look *really* fucking weird.

First, Nikkie’s eyes went wide. They went *too* *wide*. And then… oh, my fucking God… 

Her entire face began swelling, stretching and widening like a balloon. Nikkie’s cheeks became fluffed – like she had horrible allergies – but they continued to puff outward until the skin started chaffing. It happened so fast!

“MM-MMM!” 

My muffled screams shattered the silence. Nikkie’s bloated head inflated as I watched helplessly. The skin of her cheeks began to crack open and let loose gushes of blood. 

“MMM! MMM!”

Nikkie’s eyes rolled back as her features turned a hideous, dark purple color. Her distorted visage grew, and grew, and grew until it was the size of a fleshy, trembling watermelon. 

“MMM! MM-MMM!” 

In seconds, Nikkie’s blistered lips became engorged until they looked fit to burst. 

The pressure finally reached a point where Nikkie’s eyes **popped** from their sockets. 

I nearly fainted.

Nikkie’s head – looking like a grotesque piñata, with black tongue and eyes dangling by optical nerves – wobbled precariously in front of the cat. The toad-faced kitty watched all of this carefully. Intrigued by its dancing toy…

The audience inhaled sharply.

The kitty swiped forward, languidly, and Nikkie’s head exploded with shocking force. 

The cat, stage, audience, actors and yours truly were instantly coated with giblets of steaming gore, fragmented occipital bone and spongy grey matter. It was like the famous scene from that movie, *Carrie*. Except this was real. 

As I passed into shock, I could hear the audience roar jubilantly with relief:

“**SIXTEEN YEARS OF LIGHT!**”

The next thing I knew, Rahul was shaking me back to my senses on the empty stage. 

“Priya? You okay?”

I sat up, blurry eyed. Wiping away the fog as I took in the quiet apart from my labored breathing. The audience had vanished and, somehow, the stage appeared bloodless.

“You okay?” Rahul repeated.

“No!” I tried to sit up. 

“You fainted.”

“Where’s Nikkie?”

“Nikkie?” Rahul examined me. “She bounced. You fainted, Priya. Are you okay?”

“I’m fine!” I was about to throttle him. “Whaddya mean she bounced?”

“Dunno?” my brother looked evasive. “It got nuts after the show. People were partying. Logan’s team was cleaning up the mess,” he seemed uncertain. “They, uh… They upped our pay, though… Big time. On account of how much they made on everything tonight.”

“Rahul!” I was disgusted. “We can’t take their money! They fucking killed Nikkie!”

“Huh?” 

“Didn’t you see?”

“What?” Rahul was baffled. “Are you nuts? The blowing-up-head thingy? That was just the show, Priya! They fooled me pretty good, until Logan explained how it works. I literally just saw Nikkie flying through the parking lot.”

“You saw Nikkie?”

“Yeah,” he paused. “I mean… I saw her car speeding off. Apparently, she was pretty upset with those actors grabbing her.”

“But did you see HER, Rahul? Did you actually *SEE* Nikkie? Or did you see her car?”

“Her car?” Rahul blinked dumbly. “I, uh… Why does it matter?” He helped me stand. “It’s a lot of money, Priya. Like… a lot. You should go and talk with Logan. He’s waiting for you.”

I left my brother and sprinted to Logan’s office, barging through the door. Logan was sitting at his desk. Rifling through piles of paper. Then, I realized it wasn’t just paper: Logan was stacking mountains of green cash money.

“**Where the fuck is Nikkie?**” I’m mostly laid back, and the fury in my own voice startled me. I’m pretty sure it startled Logan, too. “**What did you fucking do to her?**” I was weeping. “I swear to God, Logan… I’m calling the cops!”

“Woah, now!” Logan seemed taken aback. “Easy, love. Easy!” He put the money down. “What’s goin’ on, Priya? Is it ‘cuz them brutes grabbed ya? Like they did Nikkie? Goodness… she was even more pissed off at me, believe it or not!” What was Logan trying to pull? “Tough business… Impossible to find talent that we can trust… Rest assured, love, I’ve fired the lot. We’ll be makin’ a report with the guild in the mornin’.” Logan sighed, seemingly upset. “I’m obviously glad to compensate ya for this.”

“Huh?” I’ll admit: something about Logan’s response caught me off guard. “The fuck are you talking about? You’re a liar, Logan! I’m not an idiot! You murdered my friend!”

“Come again?” Logan scrunched his nose. “Ya tryin’ to be funny?” He looked me up and down. “What’s the matter with ya, Priya?”

“What’s the MATTER?” I shrieked, hysterical, ceding the last traces of control. “You assholes killed Nikkie! It was you and… and that cat monster! You made her head explode!”

My accusation lingered in the air.

“Mmk,” Logan smirked with pity. “Ya got us.” His tone became sarcastic. “Consider yourself lucky, Priya. You’re actually a witness to an ancient cult! For countless generations: we’ve preformed blood sacrifices for primordial beings in order to ensure the survival of our species.” Logan paused dramatically, allowing the sheer lunacy of what he’d said to settle over the room. “Or, perhaps?” he feigned concern. “Perhaps you’re a ditzy little girl whose either drunk or downright stupid to not understand the basics of production.”

“What?” I was frenzied. “Are you insane?” My blood boiled with disbelief. “I saw what you did to her! Nikkie’s head… it just…” the memory made me dizzy. “You murdered her! You and… and that fat fucking cat!” Logan grinned like he wanted to say something but was holding it back. “I don’t know who you are, Logan, but I’m gonna watch you hang.”

“Enough!” Logan stiffened. “I’m your bloody employer, Priya. Mind the threats. I’m sorry ya didn’t read the script properly, love, but that seems quite the habit of yours… isn’t it?”

I bit my tongue.

“It’s been a long night,” his tone softened. “And, to be honest, I don’t take any of this personally. In fact, I completely understand. Bloody actors made a real mess of things.”

“Don’t bullshit me!”

“There’s no bullshit, love,” it was like he was reading a lullaby. “This is the biggest show of our season. We use illuminated contacts for the cat. Inflatable latex mask for our grand finale. Fake eyes ‘n blood pouches galore. I mean, ya fuckin’ fainted, love! That’s how good it was!” He said it like it was so goddamn obvious. “Nikkie went ballistic after the show. Said she was gonna sue the festival for assault. We came to an agreement. Paid her a lotta money, we did. Just like we paid Rahul.” Logan motioned to the desk. “Same as we’re prepared to pay you.” Making clear that all those stacks of cash could be mine. “Real hothead, that Nikkie. Told us to fuck off right proper! Said she was goin’ home.” Logan furrowed his brow. “Where was it? Ah, yes… That’s it! Goin’ home to Oregon, she said.”

“LIAR!” I was losing my grip. “You’re lying to me. I can tell. You killed Nikkie. You and that… cat!” I was coming apart. “I’m gonna prove what you did, Logan. I’m gonna expose you.”

“Oh?” Logan guffawed. “I like ya well enough, Priya, but there’s a line, ‘n you’re crossin’ it.” He glared at me. “Don’t fuckin’ test us!”

“Fuck. **YOU!**” my adrenaline maxed. 

“Oy, love,” now came an eerily gentle, almost melancholic note in his voice. “Please, stop ‘n listen for a moment. You’re a smart girl, Priya Choudhry. Bright future, eh? I know you’re a hard worker from a good family.”

You’d think he was threatening me, but Logan’s deadly-serious expression was entirely sincere. Even more disconcerting: his voice began cracking with something akin to fear.

“This… this simply isn’t worth it, love,” Logan examined his knobby knuckles. “I’d like ya to trust me.” Why was Logan speaking in careful whispers? “You’ve, uh… you’ve heard the sayin’? The one ‘bout curiosity? ‘N the cat?”

I stared at Logan, not saying a word. Not sure if he was trying to scare me. But, deep down? I was terrified he was finally being honest.

“That’s right,” he nodded, returning my stare. Damp eyes quivering. “That’s right.” 

Logan’s cheeks turned pale, and I was dumbfounded when he began to cry.

“This is the bloody opposite.”

I left the money on the table and got the hell outta there. Calling Nikkie every few seconds. 

No answer. Straight to voicemail.

It’s been about fifteen minutes since I arrived home. I share a two-bedroom with Rahul, but my brother is nowhere to be found. 

Right away: I write my witness statement for the police. I need them to know all of it. 

I’m trying to recall the details. Everything I saw… Each word spoken. Once complete, I toss the page from my notebook in the trash. 

Nobody’s going to believe me…

There’s no way they’ll believe any of it!

Rahul’s an addict, and he’s terrified of the cops... He won’t help me find Nikkie.

I start feeling paranoid.

Is Nikkie somehow alive? Or did I watch her perfect face kaboom into brainstuff? 

**That fat. Fucking. CAT.**

I stumble to the window. At first, I think it’s because I need oxygen, but I soon realize that a powerful beckoning has drawn me to look outside. I gulp and choke down the chilly air.

October’s fingers brush my skin as I swallow flavors of autumn. Our neighborhood gets seriously into the season, and my gaze fixes upon the jack-o'-lanterns lining our street. 

I think of Nikkie… 

My darling Nikkie… 

And then I hear:

“Meow!”
