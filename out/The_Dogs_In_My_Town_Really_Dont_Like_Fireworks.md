I am the Animal Control person in the town of Gray Hill and when you have been doing this as long as I have each day sort of blends into the next. On good days I am not needed and can stay home. However when I am needed for my services the possibilities are nearly endless: A bear gets stuck in someone's garage, a goat decides to hop in someone's car and refuses to budge, etc... I guess the long and the short of it is: In this line of work, there are no normal days. 

  
The day that I remember the most vividly was July fourth, 2008. That night the most devastating dog attack in the history of the United States occurred.

  
Most people don’t know this about dogs, but when they are together in the wild it isn't uncommon for them to behave like wolves. I’ve seen a pack of dogs track deer and even take one down. This isn't as unbelievable as it might sound, after all they aren't too different from wolves. They have the same ancestors and share the same instincts to hunt and track. 

  
A few nights before the attack, the night was full of howling. If you grew up in the country, you know how if one dog decides to bark it will seem like every dog in the county will follow suit. 

  
Unlike most nights however, this went on for hours until finally the dogs seemed to be losing their voices.

  
The next morning, the area had nearly twenty missing dogs. Everything from big pitbulls to beagles to bulldogs and even pugs. Including my own dog, a lab and shepherd mix named Bucephalus.

  
People called me in hopes I could help locate their canine family members and even though I knew better than to make promises I gave my word to do all I could.

  
As I drove around, I saw signs of the dogs everywhere. Not just tracks, I saw the bodies of deer they had chased down as well as a handful of hair and a few bones of rabbits and squirrels.

  
I gave up the search shortly before sunset. It wasn't like my chances of finding a dog grew in the dark. Besides, I was tired because I had been searching all day. 

  
That night, just before midnight, the sound of howling and barking filled the air once again. On this night however, there was something odd about the sound. Usually when dogs or wolves howl it’s a way to say hello, that night however, they almost sounded possessed.

  
That fourth of July morning something electric was in the air that had everyone on edge. This did not prevent me from my search. It wasn't so much to locate other peoples dogs, I just wanted to find my own. If I found someone else's, that was a bonus but it was far from the primary objective. 

  
The first dog attack happened shortly after the parade ended, the victim was a woman who was out for a jog. 

  
After that, the chatter on the police band reported unprovoked attacks all over town, seemingly in random locations. No one knew where the next one would be and this uncertainty made most people scared to go outside. However there were more than a few locals who thought this was all blown out of proportion and decided to take their children to watch the fireworks. 

  
That is when the horror truly started and by the time the carnage stopped, twenty two people were viciously attacked. 

  
By all accounts, when the dogs returned the next morning they were happy, wagging their tails and licking their owners as though nothing happened. Each of the owners denied that their dogs were involved with the tragedy from the night before, but the locals needed someone to blame and decided to pin all that chaos on a single chocolate lab.

  
I don't know what made the dogs do what they did, but if I had to guess it has to do something with the fireworks. After all, the night they all went crazy was the night people started shooting them off.

  
Whatever the case, ever since that day I started making Bucephalus sleep [outside](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhisperAlleyEchos/).
