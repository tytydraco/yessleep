Has anyone here ever dealt with being stalked? Because I think I might be in that situation, and I honestly don’t know what to do or how to handle it.

It started last year, and at first, I didn’t think much of it. This guy began showing up everywhere I went, but I chalked it up to coincidence. You know, running into the same person at the grocery store, on the bus, or at a coffee shop isn’t that unusual. People have routines; it happens. But after a while, it started feeling less random and way too frequent. I’d grab coffee, and he’d be there. I’d go for a walk in the park, and he’d show up. Even when I’m just walking home, I’d see him nearby, like he’s always lingering, watching. It’s unsettling, to say the least.

I’ve tried everything I can think of to avoid him. I’ve changed my routines completely—going to different coffee shops, taking different routes home, even skipping plans I was looking forward to because I didn’t want to risk running into him. Yet, somehow, he always seems to find me. It’s like he knows where I’ll be, no matter how much I try to shake him off. I don’t know how he’s doing it, and honestly, that’s part of what scares me. Is he following me without me noticing? Does he know something about my schedule that I don’t realize I’m giving away? I feel like I’m constantly looking over my shoulder, and it’s exhausting.

The worst part is, I don’t even know if I’m overreacting. I keep questioning myself: Am I just being paranoid? Is this all just some weird series of coincidences? But then my gut kicks in, and it’s screaming at me that something isn’t right. I’ve always been the kind of person who trusts their instincts, and right now, my instincts are telling me to be careful. Still, I feel stuck because I don’t know what the right move is.

Should I confront him? Part of me wants to just walk up to him and ask why he’s always around, but I’m scared that could escalate things or make him angry. What if he denies everything and I end up feeling even more trapped? On the other hand, I’ve thought about going to the police, but I worry they won’t take me seriously. What if they just brush it off as me being paranoid because I don’t have any solid evidence? I don’t want to make things worse, but I also can’t keep living like this—constantly anxious, constantly afraid.

I’ve been reading about stalking online, and it seems like there are so many different ways people handle it. Some recommend documenting everything—dates, times, places—but I don’t even know where to start. Others say to tell friends and family, but I feel embarrassed to bring it up. What if they think I’m imagining it? I’ve kept this mostly to myself because I don’t want people to think I’m being dramatic, but honestly, I feel like I’m at my breaking point.

If anyone here has been through something similar or has any advice, I’d really appreciate hearing your thoughts. What did you do? Did it help? How do you even begin to deal with something like this? Just something that can help me.
