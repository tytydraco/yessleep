10 years ago today, I discovered I was the devil, or at least that he was part of me. How did I figure this out, you ask? Well, I told myself I was.

Staring into my reflection, in a world of my own—perhaps decompressing, maybe just exhausted with life—I caught my reflection watching me. As I rose my head, I came to meet my eyes already staring forward.

Reasonably terrified, I jumped back, immediately at full fight-or-flight. Heart racing, breath caught in my lungs, eyes wide as dinner plates… but my reflection didn’t flinch. It nowhere mirrored my emotions, my movements, nor uttered my screams. It seemed so passive. Strangely, this momentarily calmed me. Like my brain thought: look at yourself, you’re so calm, so confident, some wires must be crossed, you can’t possibly be petrified.

Still, I didn’t do much. I stood there, eye to eye with myself. After only God knows how long, I actually attempted to speak—

—but I beat myself to it.
My reflection spoke first.

“Are you ready to listen? Do you have control of your faculties?”

Oddly enough I did.

“Yeah… I think I do. What’s happening?”

It smiled, ever so slightly, coyly.

“Obviously you’re talking to yourself. Right?”

“Am I having a fucking stroke? God please tell me I’m having a stroke.”

My doppelganger laughed—laughed with genuine amusement.

“He wishes.”

“What is happening?!”

“You are talking to yourself, honestly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. How often does one get to ask oneself questions and get any real answers?”

“Alright then, am I insane?”

“Depends who you ask.”

“I don’t understand, what’s the point of this?”

“You’re the one doing it.”

“What do you want?”

Then, finally acting as a mirror should, it reflected something back at me.

“What do you want?”

“I want you to stop being so god damn difficult, and answer me! I want to understand, I want clarity, I want you to get to the point—kill me like Bloody Mary, let me slip into full-blown psychosis, steal my soul, do fucking something!”

Its smile dropped—not into anger, not into distaste—almost as if it were calling me stupid. Just silently. Then it leaned forward.

“Then you do something. You say something. Kill yourself, go insane, sell your soul—do anything that means anything.”

“Who are you!”

Again, smiling, even bigger.

“I’m you.”

Then my next words left my mouth, maybe the most important words I’ve ever spoken.

“WHO AM I?”

“You are Satan. Lucifer. You are the fallen angel.”

“I’m Satan?… do you know me? Know my life?”
Now I’m the one smiling. So the reflection is insane, not me—thank God.
“I work at Burger King, buddy. The worst thing I’ve ever done was skip school, but I’m sin, and evil incarnate?”

The reflection now seems more happy than ever, overjoyed the conversation finally has some entertainment value.

“Yes. You are the Morning Star, the one cast from God’s grace. It is said you are sin, you are evil, you are greed. Many things are said. Many are true, many are but a mirror’s reflection of truth.”

“I… I… I work at Burger King.”

“Yes, the devil works at Burger King.”
The reflection spoke this as if it were attempting a joke.

“What does this mean? Are you here to tell me to go sacrifice babies? Spill the blood of the innocent, bring upon the fall of mankind?”

“What are you here to do? Do you wish to do such things? You ask yourself—do you want yourself to commit atrocities? Do you want your path to be one of hellfire and cliché?”

“Then why is this happening?”

Now looking bored, the reflection rests his chin on his fists.

“Because it is.”

That’s how it ended.
Not with a bang, not with fireworks—
but with my reflection losing interest in me, and simply starting to mirror my every action, to behave as it should.

Why should it behave that way?
…because it does.
