When you were there it felt like it belonged to you, a private escape. I almost couldn't believe it the first time I found it. It was a typical trail but there was something about those woods that made every walk enjoyable. It was less remote than it felt, the park began at the edge of suburbia. It's just that it was the entrance to the expanse of real wilderness. You could walk for a fifty miles north and encounter nothing and no one.

It's was the middle of fall. I resolved to make my way back to the trail at least once while the weather was still nice. I had been busy for the last few months with work and hadn't got out much. It was already three in the afternoon. I had woken up late, I knew if I didn't go then, I wasn't going to go at all. I packed my bag and made my way to the trail system. It was only an hour away or so, I stopped on the way at a gas station and grabbed some snacks as I had forgotten to bring any. I double checked what I had on me: two bottles of water, bear spray, multi tool, the snacks, and my phone.

It was quarter to four by the time I got to the trail head. The parking lot was mostly empty other than an old rusty hatchback that was perpetually there, abandoned and left to the mouth of the woods. Two motorcycles were parked a bit further down. The loud ones, black, with large saddle bags and wide chrome handlebars. I knew years ago there was a grow op deep deep in the woods and wondered if it could be the same gang back at it. I made my way to the trailhead and started walking.

The trees in the trail were full in their autumn foliage. I took in the fresh forest air and made my way deeper into the woods. After about an hour or so I took a seat on a large rock and snacked on some BBQ trail mix, washing it down with some cool water from my canteen. I had been here before but only once or twice; I didn't know the area too well. I looked around and noticed a small trail off of the main route near some shrubs. For some reason I thought it would be fun to check it out. I wasn't going to go too far, only twenty yards or so.

As I walked along I noticed the trees began to thin out in the distance. The sun was shining down, there must have been a clearing or something. I decided I would continue onward and check out what was up ahead. When I got there I couldn't help but exclaim 'woah'. It was a large meadow in the middle of the forest. I was completely unaware that this was even here. I walked deeper into the meadow surveying the are around me. The grass was kind of tall but manageable. I got to near the center of the meadow when I heard some voices.

"Hey Billy! Where'd you put my drink? BILLY!" the woman's voice was tough and boisterous.

"Charlene it's right there! Quit complaining and open your eyes."

"Aww shut up!" she replied to the loud man's voice.

I looked over in the direction of the sound. There was a small wooden cabin and a tiny pond. Two leather clad bikers were standing there smoking. I thought maybe I should turn around, these two were not exactly the usual company I keep and I had no idea what kind of people they were. Suddenly the woman looked up and saw me.

"Hey Billy! There's someone here. Hey dude what's going on man?"

"Hello. Hi. How is it going? I'm well thank you." I called back to them

"Hey Buddy, how's it going? You want to have a drink with us?" the large bearded man called out. I didn't really but at this point for some reason I said 'yeah sure'.

I didn't want to sit there with them and chat but my social awkwardness propelled me deeper into the situation. I walked closer and closer wondering what I was doing. I wasn't exactly afraid of them or anything, I had talked with many similar characters in the past. Eventually I reached them."Hey" I said extending my hand. They both shook back, the mans grip like vice grip pliers, locking in as he grabbed my hand.

"HI, I'M DALE AND THIS IS CHARLENE" he wasn't yelling but his voice was obnoxiously loud.

We chatted for the next hour. Dale offered me a beer from the cooler and I took it. I rarely drink so when I finished the one can I was already feeling a little tipsy.

"We just came out here from Burtonville." Charlene told me. "We bike all over but this is where we like to come and hang out something."

"Oh that's nice, that's really cool" I said trying to maintain the conversation.

"Yep, we go everywhere on those hogs. Next year we're taking them up to Alaska. Going to be the trip of a life time." Dale said proudly.

After the initial weariness subsided talking with the two of them was actually rather enjoyable. I didn't get any weird vibe from them in spite of their rugged tough looks. I took another beer from Dale and drank it down. We were laughing and joking. Then Charlene mentioned there was a cool old abandoned car in the woods just outside the clearing. I didn't really want to venture into the woods but she assured me it was only a minute out and they knew the way. We started to make our way over.

It had to have been less than a minute to get to the car. It was something from the 60s, covered in rust and the windows smashed out. I wondered how they had even gotten it into the woods. Dale told me the area used to be a hunting ground and there was an alternate road that grew over years and years ago. I stared at the car in wonder. I looked over at Charlene and Dale, they were laughing and flirting. Dale growled playfully at her, the two were in there own world. I looked off into the trees and walked out a bit to get away from the two lovebirds. I just listened to the sound of the woods and watched the squirrels and bids putter around.

I was only away for a few minutes but when I turned back to the car Charlene and Dale were gone. I called out to them but there was no response. I figured they must have headed back to the cabin. I figured the clearing wasn't too far I could make it back by myself no problem. I knew the direction was opposite the car for sure. Only after a minute of walking, I didn't find the clearing. It didn't make sense I knew it had to be there, it was massive and unmissable. I looked in all directions seeing no sign of it anywhere.

I started to get worried. I had a feeling it was to my right but at this point I was disoriented. I had had two beers which was already too much for my low tolerance. I pulled our my phone and loaded up the GPS Map but got nothing. There should have been a signal... I checked my paper map. I couldn't see any sign of a clearing. Was it really possible they had missed such a large meadow on the map? This made no sense and every second that passed my anxiety was increasing.

I decided I would head right. It HAD TO be the right way, there was no way I had ventured off into the woods in the wrong direction. It was literally just opposite the car and like one minute into the woods. How was it possible that I could no longer see the clearing. It was getting dark. I started thinking that tonight might be the night that I actually have to utilize my emergency pop up shelter... That was until I realized I had left it at home.

***Why...?***

Why didn't I bring it. How stupid could I have been. I never anticipated going off trail so I figured there was no way I would need it. This was so typical. Of course the one time I needed the thing I didn't have it. If I got stuck out here overnight I would have to cover myself in leaves or something. While it wasn't freezing temperatures it was still cold. The minutes kept ticking and the sun in the sky was getting dimmer and dimmer. I was such an idiot.

I tried to stay calm in situations like these but the realization that I might actually have to stay in the woods overnight was getting to me. Every twig snap and crackle made me jittery. A racoon or something fluttered past in the distance. I jumped but when I saw it's tail I realized it was just a small animal. Nonetheless I was on edge. It was really starting to get dark now and I still had no idea of where I was going. I called out to Dale and Charlene even though I was certain by now they were long gone. Why didn't I call them earlier?

This had to be one of the stupidest situations I had gotten myself into. I started to freak out. I looked around at the shadows of the trees. Any second expecting a wolverine or puma to jump out at me. I tripped on some brush and hit the ground hard. My shoulder seared with pain. I got up quickly, aching but fine. Suddenly I looked in the distance between a few trees and if felt like all the blood in my body drained our. In between two trees was a face... but it wasn't human.

It was so dark it just looked like a disembodied face floating in the mid air. It glowed a dim white light, emanating from nowhere. I screamed at the top of my lungs. After I calmed down I looked again, realizing it must just be some glow in the dark Halloween prop that someone had left out. I laughed to myself reassuringly... except when I looked again the floating face was gone. I started to feel like everything was spinning. I turned around and to my horror I saw the same floating face only this time behind me. One of them fixed it's gaze on me and flied towards me, a forceful impact pushing me back as it got close.

"No!" I screamed as I started to barrel though the wood blindly, tackling bushes shrubs grappling with trees. Suddenly I heard a disgusting clicking noise, some alien sounding chatter. I looked around and saw several other floating faces with horrendous expressions of evil glaring at me. I just kept running and running and running and running until all I could taste was the salty acidic burn of my lungs working themselves to the brink of exhausting. I don't know how long I ran for, it must have been minutes but eventually I passed out.

I woke up just as dawn was breaking. The sound of a passing semi truck whizzed past as the ground shook. I must have been near the highway. I looked around for any sighting of the floating faces. They were gone.

I gained my bearings and followed the road for half an hour or so until I saw the parking lot to the trail head in the distance. I looked at the "Wippawatoo County Park" sign and the entrance sign board as I dragged my beaten self towards my car. I hadn't noticed them before, but they must have been there. Several missing persons signs and a warning that several people had disappeared in the park in the last few years. "Take caution and tell someone where you are going!".

Had the floating faces done this? They almost got me. What would have happened if I hadn't ran like I did. Would I be another one added to the board? Beaten and ripped apart by the malevolent creatures in the woods. I sat in my car, thousand yard stare toward the treeline of the forest.

I could hardly see it *but it was there*. It wasn't glowing now but I know it was one of them, about 20 feet into the trees. A hateful scowling face that blended into the trees, filled with scorn and rage. Like it was saying something to me.

*Stay away from our forest, stay away from our meadow.*

I slammed the car in to reverse and sped out of the lot. I hardly noticed I was so scared getting out of that place, but there they were... two black motorbikes parked in the same spot as yesterday.

Charlene and Dale hadn't left the woods...
