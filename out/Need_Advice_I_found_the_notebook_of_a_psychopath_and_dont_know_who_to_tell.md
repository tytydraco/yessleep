 

Let me start off by explaining how I got this thing. You know those clothing dropoff boxes in grocery store parking lots? I’m the guy that collects and sorts them. You would be surprised how much fucking trash people throw in those things; it’s pretty sickening. I’ve found half eaten food, even dirty diapers, and it wasn’t me personally, but there’s a story the older workers always tell about abandoned puppies. 

So yesterday, I was going through a backpack, and what happens more often than you’d suspect is they have a lot of cool shit in them. Call me a piece of shit, but finding a bag is our form of a bonus. The clothes get donated to the needy, and the Nintendo DSs and Yugioh cards go to me. Sadly this bag wasn’t a winner, just some random shit and a notebook. A notebook usually wouldn’t pique my interest, but the boss has really been cracking down on cell phone usage, so I thought, why not. 

It was pretty cringe at first, just a guy rambling about his day, regular diary type shit. Skimmed through a lot of it because his handwriting wasn’t too great either. The first thing I noticed, though, was he follows a very meticulous routine, at least according to his writing, including watching for this one girl at his bus stop. The writing changes pretty drastically when he describes her pretty much every day. What she wears, if she’s carrying food or coffee, everything you could think of to describe her. He makes sure to explain if her hair is in a bun and whether it’s curled or straightened. 

It’s creepy, to say the least, but kind of fascinating. I thought, probably just some sadsack that can’t get pussy anywhere, so he uses her for jerkoff material, but then I got deeper. This guy is kind of deranged, like serial stalker vibes. He started off like your average creep, but that was at the beginning of the notebook around October 2022. By the time I got to December, it had gotten worse. He had found out her name was Melissa from mustering up the courage to grab one of her Starbucks cups out of a trash can. Any time she throws anything away, he will try to grab it. He’s even talked about missing his bus to get stuff before. I guess she works at an office across the street from his bus stop. 

I took a break from reading it after that til earlier today cause this fucker writes literally every day. He’s filling this notebook full of the most uninteresting shit. I should have brought it home last night, though, cause I laid in bed all night with a nagging feeling. Anyway, so I get to work and fuck all with actually doing my job. I post up at my desk and get back to reading. January is pretty much the same no significant changes, but by February, he’s escalated to a full on stalker. He’s not even there for the bus anymore. It’s just for her. He’s waiting till she gets off her shift and trailing her. The first night he did it, she went to a bar right after work. He waited outside for a few minutes hoping she would return and then went home. The next night he got lucky, though. I guess she lives close enough where she doesn’t drive because he followed her all the way home. He has some basic directions, but I won’t share those here. 

After that, he started to follow her at least twice a week. She almost caught him once, he thinks, but according to him, he played it “too smooth.” He didn’t follow her home for the next week after that; I think that might have actually scared him. But the next week, he mustered the courage right back up. His writings were the darkest during that week of abstinence. He compared it to that of Jesus’s trial in the desert. He also mentioned that it coincidentally fell right at the start of lint. In some of the more boring parts of his journal, he does talk about going to Sunday mass, so I guess he’s religious. 

Once I got to March, I knew there couldn’t be much left because, you know, we’re in March. During the first week, he escalated again. He’s waiting outside of her house now, hoping to catch a glimpse of her through windows that don’t even seem to be open. He counts two cars in the driveway, but whoever the other driver is, he likes to tell himself it’s a male roommate, doesn’t get home till about eleven each night. So for three hours, he sits outside her house and waits. I don’t think I’ve mentioned this yet, but this is always on weekdays since she doesn’t work on the weekends. He hasn’t ever gone to her house on the weekends, at least according to the diary. 

I only had a few pages left when work was over, so I decided it was best to bring it home and finish it tonight. On March eleventh, he started talking crazy; I guess as crazy as you can get when you are a full fledged stalker. He always wanted her, but in the back of his mind, in the entries, he always seemed to understand that wasn’t an option. He fantasized about maybe bumping into her one day at the coffee shop or on her way home from work and how he would sweep her off her feet with his charm. It always seemed like he knew that was a pipe dream, though in the back of his mind. This, this was, different entirely. I don’t want to use the word abduction or sexual assault, but I don’t know how else to describe what his fantasies have become. He always wrote about having dreams of having sex with her, but it was always consensual. What I’m reading now is far from that; he’s angry. He doesn’t want to wait any longer for her to fall in love with him. He’s given her so many opportunities to notice him, but she’s too much of a fucking bitch. He just knows that she is cheating on him with the guy in the truck, and if she isn’t willing to love him for him, he will take what he is owed. He has spent way too much time and energy on this cunt for her to fuck it all up. 

The last entry is Wednesday, March fifteenth. He’s been listing all the ways he would do it. Chloroform, roofies, brute force, he likes that last one. He talks about how easy it would be to choke her petite body into submission, that it might even turn her on. He knows there’s no way the guy in the truck fucks her like that. If he can’t have her, then he will take her. Then it just ends, and I don’t know what I just read. Why would this backpack with a notebook that is this important to this guy get donated? He wouldn’t go through with it, would he? I don’t know what to do. Should I take this to law enforcement? They probably will think it’s some kind of joke. Even if they did take it seriously, from what I’ve heard, stalking really isn’t high on their priority list until it’s too late. Should I try to give this to the girl, or would that scare her even more? Maybe this freak really is just living out his fantasies through this diary, and there’s nothing to worry about. I sure don’t want to confront him directly. For all I know, he could be twice my size. That’s why I’m here. What should I do?
