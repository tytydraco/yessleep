To my surprise, I woke up with my mind and body still intact. But I wasn’t alone.

Moira was there, her lukewarm back gently pressing against me. She lay like a delicate flower basking in the afternoon sun, the sticky silk sheets refusing to cling to her smooth skin. For a split second, I thought it had all been a nightmare. She was here, just as I remembered her.

The only thing contesting the illusion was the heavy silk blanket still smothering me.

There was no smell other than her sweet, familiar fragrance. Even the blood Joshua had smeared on my door was gone, scrubbed away. Only the faintest trace remained, barely visible unless you knew where to look.

At least now I could speak.

“Moira?” My voice was quiet, hesitant.

She let out a soft sound as she stirred and rolled around. Stretching out her arms before wrapping them around me in a cold attempt at a warm embrace.

“Good morning,” she murmured, her words swallowed by a yawn.

My mind clawed at words, but I didn’t know what to say. I wanted to confront her, to ask what she had done with Joshua, but I already knew the answer. I just wasn’t ready to hear it.

“Last night… Did— was Josh—” That was as far as I got before Moira’s voice drowned out my thoughts.

“The doctor came by this morning. We didn’t want to wake you… He took a look at you, and we both agreed that you’ll be fine after some rest.” She paused, watching me carefully before finishing her words. “He even brought me some medicine for the pain. He said I should give it to you as I see fit.”

A doctor. Making a house call all the way out here? No. He would have seen the webs. He would have known something was wrong. Her story seemed unlikely, impossible.

I didn’t trust her, but Moira convinced me I needed help recovering, so I played along. In a strange way, she reminded me of the nurses at the hospital. Whether her care was genuine or just an attempt to win back my trust, it was too early to tell.

I guess only time will tell, I will try to keep this diary updated. Even though I can feel myself losing the will to continue.

…

I don’t know how many days have passed since my last entry, but Moira seems determined to win me over. She feeds me, cleans me, and even gives me medicine when my body aches.

Moira surprised me with a lemon pie today. I’m not sure where she got the recipe, or the lemons. It seemed a little improvised, but it’s the thought that counts. It was sickly sweet, yet somehow just the right amount of sour. Admittedly, it was not the best pie ever, but something about it warmed me up inside. I could tell it was made with love.

…

My leg feels almost whole again, and I can turn my head as far as the brace allows without pain. I think it’s ready to come off. Yet despite my recovery, my body feels weaker than ever. I keep asking Moira to lower the dose so I can move around more, but she just smiles and assures me she knows exactly how much I need.

Moira and I haven’t talked about the giant, spider-shaped, white elephant in the room, but as long as things stay like this, I don’t think we have to. Everything is almost back to normal. She sits with me during the day, telling me about all the wonderful things we’ll do once I’m better. We could go hiking again, try out real restaurants, meet new people, and…

What am I saying? Why am I even considering this? Things can't ever go back to the way they were, not after what I’ve seen.

…

My memories are still foggy, but I don’t think I’ve been declining as much since my accident in the hallway. Maybe I knocked my head back into place. Or maybe there’s just nothing left to forget.

Except Joshua.

My head is still full of cherished memories of him, yet they only serve as a painful reminder of what I’ve lost… what Moira has taken.

…

Every day that passes, I become more certain that things can't stay like this forever. As I recover and even gain weight, Moira has been experiencing the opposite. She’s growing weak again, and I know what that means. She needs to feed. And with Joshua off the menu, I fear I’ll be next.

I swear she’s fattening me up for the slaughter. I need to do something, fast.

I have to find a way out of here. I’m pretty sure I can walk, I just need Moira to stop injecting me with her “medicine”. My arm is covered in track marks like a heroin addict’s, my veins bulging like blue rivers with streams of ink flowing through them. Whatever it is, it’s definitely a sedative, but nothing like what the nurses gave me.

If I can just convince her to lower my dose, just once, I might be able to muster the strength to fight back and break free from this cocoon.

…

Joshua might be gone, but the hope he gave me isn’t.

Shifting in bed, I felt something gently prodding into my back. With my free hand, I reached under the pillow and found it, the knife. The same blackened blade he used to fend off Moira, the one he tried to cut me free with.

Maybe I could finish what he started…

…

Last night, I asked Moira to lower my dosage since my body had nearly made a full recovery. I promised her I wouldn’t struggle anymore. I felt bad for deceiving her.

She gave me a tired smile. “I’ll think about it,” she said. But there was something in her voice that told me she didn’t believe me.

“Since I already went through the trouble of preparing this dose, I’ll give it to you as is. I’ll call the doctor tomorrow and ask about lowering your next dose.” Her voice was soft and comforting, even though I knew it was all lies.

The cloudy white fluid in the syringe couldn’t have been more than a few drops, but it did the trick. Almost instantly, my muscles melted under the weight of the fraying blanket. The medicine may have dulled my body, but my mind was still hard at work, piecing together a plan to escape.

…

Today is the day. This has to work. I don’t think Moira can hold back her hunger much longer. She looks as ready to pop as she did that night she revealed her true nature.

She’ll be back with my next dose in a few hours. By then, I’ll have carefully slipped the knife from under my pillow, gripping it as tightly as my weak muscles allow. I’ll cut through the last thick strands of silk holding me down, slicing through the main arteries like some twisted surgeon, until all that remains is a dried-out net, light as a leaf. Once I’m done, I’ll slide the knife back under the pillow and pray I won’t need it again.

If I write any more after this, then that means my plan must have worked…

…

The plan backfired worse than I could have imagined. I just pray I remember where to find this diary in the morning. Hopefully, reading it will give me some clue as to who I used to be, before Moira hollows me out completely.

It worked at first. I cut myself free, and once the weight lifted, I could feel my strength returning. My veins filled with adrenaline, flushing out the last of her venom. I hid the knife just in time. Moira returned as the sun was setting, right on time for what was hopefully my final dose.

She entered the room with a slight limp in her step. Her age was catching up quickly, something that would greatly aid my escape, I thought. In this form, I could easily overpower her and wrestle the syringe from her hand; the syringe was plan A and the knife was my backup plan.

Even after everything Moira has put me through, I don’t hate her. I hate what she’s become. I hate the illness. To spare her life while saving myself would be the best outcome for everyone involved. Everyone except Joshua... the memory of him was the driving force behind this escape attempt.

If I didn’t get out, then Joshua would have died for nothing.

When Moira took out the syringe, I saw exactly what I was hoping for. I knew that when I asked for a lower dose, she would only increase it. She couldn't bear to give up control, not with so much animosity between us. I could never forgive her for what she had done to Joshua. And now, she was starting to realize that.

I offered my arm, and her cold hand closed around mine, gently yet firmly pulling it out to ready the needle. Her bony fingers still wielding the same strength with which she had pulled me up the day we met. That’s when I knew this wouldn’t be as easy as I thought.

There was no time to hesitate, I had to move quickly. I grabbed the syringe from her hand. She wasn't expecting it, and before she even knew what happened, I plunged it into her abdomen. The needle punctured her wrinkled skin and slid in smoothly, almost as silky smooth as her skin had once been. As I injected the medicine, I saw her glazed-over eyeballs roll back into her skull, only for a pair of inky black eyes to fill the empty sockets. The venom pooled inside them as she stared me down, but this time, her icy gaze wouldn’t freeze me in place.

She managed to keep me pinned for a second, but I shoved her back with all my might. The venom was working, even on her. She stumbled back, and I saw my chance. My body ached as I broke through my cocoon and dragged myself onto my feet. My legs buckled, but I pushed through. I made it to the doorway, but before I could leave, I shot a glance back at Moira. She was on her hands and knees, facing the floor. I could see her back bulging; I knew what was coming. I was sure the venom would be enough to paralyze Moira, but no amount of it could subdue the beast inside her.

For a moment, I hesitated. Had I made the right choice, using the needle instead of the knife? I almost darted back for the knife, but then I heard her shrill, agonizing scream. It was an angry scream, her once woeful screech boiling over into a fit of rage. For a second, it sounded like standing next to a boiling kettle, one filled with poison and betrayal. My heart broke for the women I loved.

I left the room, but my mind stayed behind. As I stumbled down the hallway, I could hear the same sounds I had when I was forced to witness her transformation. Only this time, they were much quicker; they sounded rushed, more urgent. The speed of her transformation filled me with an overwhelming sense of dread.

With each sound, a flash of memory accompanied it, my mind replaying the event in fragments that clouded my vision.

A symphony of agony spilled out from my room and into the hallway behind me, climaxing in a loud screech and a heavy thud. Then, immediate and complete silence.

I didn’t care if the venom worked and if she was out cold, or if it failed and she was right on my heels. I was heading straight for the front door, not stopping for anything. As I limped through the dining room, I swear I heard a faint sound coming from the attic above me. At first, I wasn’t sure if I had heard anything at all. Only when I reached for the handle on the front door did I stop, guilt overwriting my movement. 

What if… What if that noise was Joshua? What if he was still alive, and I was leaving him behind?

I know now what that noise was, because as I turned around, my hopes were crushed by what I saw in the mirror beside the door. Moira was on the ceiling right above me. She fell onto me with all her weight, and as her fangs punctured the back of my neck brace, the needle-sharp tips somehow echoed the pain from the dull rock that had landed me in this mess.

The pain faded along with my vision, and I fell into a dreamless sleep so deep I thought I had died.

I jolted awake, sitting upright in my bed, as if awakening from a feverish nightmare. The room around me was swallowed by deep darkness,  it must have been sometime around midnight. My only sensation was the throbbing pain in the back of my neck,  my hand instinctively reached for the source of the pain, it found two shallow holes with small streaks of dried blood running down them.

As I leaned over to look at the clock on my bedside, I was surprised to find that my body was complying. I was not tied down. But as soon as I moved, the darkness spoke. A voice I recognized well was choking on words attempting to ease the pain, but it was useless. Instead of comforting me, Moira’s voice sent a cold weight through my spine, locking me in place.

“I’m so, so sorry,” Moira said, remorse stifling her voice.

“I didn’t want to bare my fangs at you… but you left me no choice.”

I purposefully turned my head away from her and, and with a slight quiver I asked, “Is this the part where you eat me like a bug?”

“Eat you? I could never eat you. It’s killing me, but I’d rather waste away and refuse to feed.” Her voice was low and serious, the pain clear in each word.

“You had no problem eating Joshua!” I spat, my words coated in venom.

“What a senseless comparison,” she said in a cold, calm voice.

After a brief pause, her tone shifted. Suddenly, her voice spoke with a quiet warmth that reminded me of why I fell in love with her.

“You showed me that the heart is more than a pump. Is this what they call love? Because I feel it in my chest, and I feel it in my head…”

She paused, weighing out the emotional weight of her next words.

I know all of Joshua’s thoughts, every memory he had of you. He only ever pitied you, he could never take away your pain like I have. He was merely a stain on the parts of pain I’ve already scrubbed clean. In the end, his flesh was worth more than the scraps of insight his memories offered. He didn’t love you. Not like I do.”

Her words ricocheted around in my head, the first realization bouncing off the second. This was the first time she admitted to killing Joshua, and also the first time she told me she loved me.

The moment felt wrong, the bitter outweighed the sweet. The realization slowly sank in like a lumpy, bitter pill washed down with a spoonful of thick honey.

I turned towards where her voice had come from. My words shaking as I spoke into the darkness.

“You're wrong about him. Joshua was all I had. He was the only person left in my life who was real. I don't remember anyone else,” I said, my voice a quiet plea, waiting for her to and rationalize what she had taken from me.

“I tried my hardest to consume only the pain. It was like uprooting all the weeds in a garden, only to realize there’s nothing left at the end.” She paused, her words heavy with honesty.

“I thought Joshua was the only thing left that was worth saving. He was the lemon tree, proudly standing in the center of the garden. However, it seems as if the fruit of your friendship has soured the soil, and made it impossible for anything else to grow in its place… I recognize that it’s my fault, for not clearing him out with the rest of the weeds.”

Her voice softened, but the coldness in it remained.

“But now there’s only one solution… It is clear to me that I can't leave you with the last of your memory.”

All the metaphors swam around in my head, too much to try and piece together at once. I just sat there in silence, trying to process her words.

There was a long pause from the darkness before Moira continued.

“But I promise you I'm real, as real as your own flesh. So just let your eyes grow heavy, and I'll stay beside your bed.” As she leaned over out of the darkness, Moira’s melodical voice grew into a whisper, soft and sweet. A stark contrast to the face directly in front of mine, those eight cold pearls piercing through me.

“Do you recognize my gaze, as I once again clean you of this mess?” The final words in her lullaby lulled me into a trance.

I stared into her eyes for only a few seconds, but it felt like a lifetime had passed. I could feel my childhood memories of Joshua slipping away, and with them, any connection to my past. My whole existence, up until now, was reduced to a flickering candle in the wind. On the verge of being snuffed out.

I shut my eyes, a tear rolling down my cheek as I turned my head away.

“Was this your plan all along? To hollow me out? To paralyze my body and spirit so you can pull at my strings like I’m your puppet?”

“Don't you see? Once you let go, there will be no need for strings. You’ll be free, without the memory of ever being trapped. Then we can start over...”

“I’m not ready to let go. Just give me some time alone with my thoughts…” I paused, the weight of my own words sinking in, “Or at least what’s left of them.”

One of Moira’s eight legs curled out from the darkness, brushing the tear off my cheek with an eerie tenderness.

Moira stared at me unblinking. Her cold, inky eyes carrying a warm understanding, but I could still sense the hunger behind them. She agreed and left the room. Her patient voice was the last thing I heard, as her silent skittering carried her out the room, her words echoed down the hall. “I’ll be here when you change your mind.”

Once I was sure I was alone again, I wasted no time reaching for my laptop to write down everything that had happened. I hope that by the time I wake up tomorrow, I will remember where to find this journal.

As I lay in bed, unburdened by webs, a strange sense of trust settles over me… Until I notice something lingering in the corner of the room. A uniquely familiar shape. I stare at it for over a minute, yet my eyes refuse to adjust to the darkness. The pale form melts seamlessly into the white corner where the ceiling meets the wall. I can’t bring myself to turn on the light.

You would think that Moira’s influence feels like a parasite in my head, maliciously eating away at my memories, but no. My head is as clear as it has ever been. Instead, the years of memories I’ve lost feel like a pit in my stomach. And yet all my memories of Moira are still crystal clear, kept safe inside my heart.

If Moira is telling the truth, and my life before her was as miserable as she says, then why do I hunger for a life I never truly lived? A life where I merely existed, scraping by with nothing to show for it. No purpose, no joy, just an endless cycle of loss and loneliness.

The thought of going back to my life without Moira terrifies me. 

What if all she wants is to take away the pain? Maybe if I give in to her, I could be happy. Maybe we could be whole again. When it's all said and done, she's still all that I've got. Or maybe she is lying, and the reason she dug this pit in my stomach was so she can lay her eggs and watch as they hatch, and then slowly consume me from the inside out. 

The fucked up part is I don't know which possibility scares me more. Having dozens of spiders eat me from the inside out, or ending up alone… without her. 

I’m torn between two unbearable choices. Moira’s promise of rebirth and belonging feels like home, yet the knife pressed through my pillow promises of a desperate escape, another false hope perhaps. No blade is sharp enough to cut through her hold on me. I’ve become her puppet, and even if I manage to sever that final strand, I know I’ll collapse under the crushing weight of my own loneliness.
