[\[Part 8\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1hdnwzv/the_call_of_the_breach_part_8/)

Golden sunlight streamed down from overhead, a warm reprieve from the chill of the late fall day, but I couldn’t enjoy it for the deep *boom-booms* that echoed in the distance.

*“Eagle Five, good effect on target. 100 over 100. Rhino One Actual, out.”*

My chest cramped at the sound of Chris’s voice over the radio headset, and my nervous heart skipped a beat. They’d been shelling an ELSAR sentry post for the past few minutes, and if the field guns we’d built at New Wilderness had been called off, it meant they’d done their job well. I wanted to believe that Chris and his soldiers weren’t in any danger, but I knew better. Even here, a few miles away, I could feel the *krump* of more gun batteries sending their final volley into the sky, and my heightened senses could pick up the faint taste of smoke on the breeze.

*Once I meet up with Sean, I can go check on Chris. He’s got to report in to HQ at some point, right? I need to see him, just once, just to be sure . . .*

Biting my lower lip in frustration, I kicked at a muddy tire on my battered green SUV. As we weren’t meant to take part in frontline combat, not yet anyway, our platoon had received unarmored regular civilian vehicles patched together from spare parts instead of the up-armored trucks which were in short supply. They ran, which was a miracle in a half, but staring at my meager convoy with the sound of distant gunfire in my ears only accentuated my unease. Sure, I had no desire to go back into combat, with bullets snapping by my head, and bombs raining from the sky, but I hated being stuck in the rear while Chris and the others risked their lives.

“Man, it just doesn’t stop.” Lucille hefted my camera in her hands and shuddered at the machine gun fire on the horizon.

Standing at the edge of the field, I nodded, and watched the silo team lower supplies down the access hatch with ropes. Silo 48 lay concealed beneath a flat, grassy meadow, but despite the sunshine, the distant chirping of birds in the trees, I couldn’t shake the queasiness from the pit of my gut that this place gave me. We’d scanned for radiation three times, but the researchers of the silo team concluded that, though there were strange variations in the background radiation, none of it was at a harmful level. Still, my camera screen had twitched when I turned it on, and I didn’t plan on using it long here, just in case some unseen electro-magnetic energy damaged it.

*Still, better to get some footage now, just in case.*

I turned to Lucille, and eyed the camera lens pointed my way, the feeling of being in front of the camera for a change bizarre. “We won’t be here long, so if you’ve got anything that needs doing, do it now. Once the team is settled in, we’re heading north to meet up with headquarters. Anything we run into, we call in to Sean, and wait for backup.”

Lucille yawned and itched at the back of her neck. “You think we’ll see any action?”

Prying clumps of mud from my boot on the bumper of my command vehicle, I tried to ignore the nervous butterflies in my stomach. “Probably. With how few of us there are overall, I don’t think we’ll be able to stay out of it forever. Let’s just hope ELSAR isn’t expecting us.”

Her eyes hardened with that knowledge, and Lucille lowered my camera to cock her head to one side. “Do . . . do you think we could find a way to contact Andrea once we get close to the walls?”

“We’ll definitely try.” I plucked a strand of the nearby tall grass and started to shred it with my thumbnail. “She’s one of the few leaders they’ve got left, so I figure once we make contact with their units, she’ll hear about it. Maybe when that happens, we can send her a message just from you.”

That, of course, was a half-truth. I had no idea if Andrea was alive or dead, but I needed Lucile at her best, along with all my platoon, and she seemed to accept the idea readily enough. Right now, our survival mattered more, and that meant keeping my crew focused.

*“Sparrow One Actual, this is Hornet One Actual, we need you below decks.”* One of the researcher’s voices crackled through the radio headset over my ears, and I pushed off from the well-worn SUV to head for the hatchway.

“I’m on my way.” I clicked the mic, then turned to Lucille, and motioned for the convoy. “Stow the camera and be ready to move out. We don’t want to be late.”

It took a few minutes to clamber down into the dark maw of the nuclear missile silo from the long ladder at the hatch, but soon I found myself at the bottom and worked my way past the mounded boxes of supplies into the interior. Researchers and a few guard rangers were there, mostly hard at work checking the various panels, the electrical system all lit up after the lead scientists managed to get the generator back online. The garrison mainly consisted of people unfit for combat, the elderly, younger children, and a few people with acute medical conditions. Only the handful of guards were able-bodied, and even then, these were all teens below the age of fourteen, with aged weapons and sullen frowns. They’d been ordered to hide behind the sturdy blast doors of the bunker until receiving further instructions from Sean, and while the bunker’s heating system warmed the facility to pre-Breach levels of comfort, it was still a dark, gloomy place to stay.

The lead researcher met me halfway down the flight of steps to the lower level of the control room, a green canvas sling bag in his wizened hands. An older man in his mid-seventies, his wrinkled face was somewhat pale, but he handed it to me without fanfare, along with two familiar silver keys on the end of a small metallic chain.

“Everything should be in order.” He glanced at the bundle in my hands, and the old man rubbed at his skinny arm in nervousness. “There’s an instruction manual in there too, just the basics I clipped out of a larger one. It’s a fairly advanced trajectory calculation system for the time period, mostly analog, but not so complex that we’ll need satellite guidance. Most targets already have pre-set coordinates built in, based off Cold War priority lists. There’s even a talk function where the machine repeats pre-recorded commands through a speaker, the best they could get before artificial voice synthesis. We’ll have twenty-four missiles in total, all that can launch within five minutes.”

I swallowed hard, and fought the urge to throw the panel as far from myself as possible. “Thanks.”

As I turned to leave, the elderly scientist called out to me one more time. “Lieutenant? This whole thing, it’s silly, isn’t it? I mean, they’re not actually going to use them . . . right?”

*Your guess is as good as mine.*

Unsure of what to say, I paused at the foot of the ladder, but couldn’t find the strength to formulate a convincing lie. Instead, I simply climbed back up the cold metal ladder, and into the sunlit world of the surface.

On the road once more, my radio crackled to life as our trucks bumped along a rutted, narrow secondary lane.

*“All units, this is Rhino One Actual.”* Chris’s voice echoed through the radio headsets, low and serious. *“Objective is secure. We are oscar-mike.”*

My shoulders relaxed, and I let out a long sigh of relief. Our radio traffic had to be disguised, in case ELSAR intercepted it, but soon they would know we were coming for them. The trick would be to stay ahead of their aircraft, artillery, and recon units long enough to destroy their outposts, and render them blind to everything outside the walls of Black Oak. All the regular line units were ‘Rhinos’, Sean was ‘Hilltop’ and the Ark River fighters were ‘Stags’. The bunker team were all ‘Hornets’ given the speed and sting of their hidden weapons, and our artillery were ‘Eagles’. My platoon, being one of three advance scout units not from Ark River, was designated Sparrow One, and I clicked my mic to render my pre-arranged callsign.

“Hilltop, this is Sparrow One, we are Oscar-mike from the Hornet’s Nest, how copy, over?”

*“Solid copy Sparrow One, rendezvous with me at Rally Point 12. Hilltop Out.”*

Tracing my fingers over a ragged topographical map I kept folded within a protective screen of clear cellophane, I tapped the location with my finger, and waved at the road ahead. “Alright Charlie, we’re going to take the next right, and stay on that road for three miles.”

Driving through the ruined countryside of Barron County had always been surreal for its post-human desolation, but as we drew closer to the ever-shifting frontlines, we found new additions to the tapestry of death; burning ELSAR vehicles, smoldering ruins of sandbag outposts, and the motionless corpses of dead soldiers left to bloat in the sun. Most were far enough off the road to where we only caught glimpses, but we passed one checkpoint that had been overrun by our forces so recently that the spattered blood on the gravel was still cherry red. All of the enemy had been stripped of anything useful, some in their underwear, their boots gone, not so much as a glove left on them. The air stank of rancid burned hair, sickly-sweet flesh, and rank boiled blood, more than one body trapped in the flaming ELSAR trucks that lined the narrow roadways. It made my guts roll, but I focused on getting my troops through the log jam, and soon we came upon live men wearing the green field jackets of the New Wilderness Coalition.

They waved us through the rear-guard checkpoints, and we drove into the improvised main camp of our field army. Here the circle of barbed wire was small, the lookouts wary, the tents hastily erected. Our strategy relied on never staying in one place too long, since the further north we went, the closer we got to ELSAR’s air assets, radio-direction-finding devices, and drones. As such, the camp was far less permanent than New Wilderness or Ark River, but still it buzzed with activity. Messengers on the backs of horses, Bone Faced Whitetail, or even a few motorcycles came and went carrying orders to units that weren’t vital enough to risk putting on the radio, thus reducing our odds of being detected by ELSAR. Medics carried wounded on stretchers, not many, but enough that it made my heart twinge in sympathy at the bloody, broken figures of my fellow Rangers. Ammunition carriers moved with the messengers to bring more supplies to the front, and a generator powered a nearby radio antenna to extend our signal range to the entire front line.

Parking our vehicles in a small motor pool where several others were, I gave my platoon fifteen minutes to rest, while I grabbed the canvas bag with the launch panel and headed for Sean’s tent.

The moment I stepped inside, he greeted me with a relieved nod and locked the missile control module in a small metal cabinet bolted inside his command vehicle. “Well done, Brun. That went smoother than I thought. Any trouble at the site?”

*If there will be trouble, I have a feeling it won’t be during daylight hours.*

I shook my head and dug my thumbnail into the leather strap of my Type 9 to distract my nervous thoughts. “I don’t think anyone knows it’s there.”

“Good.” Sean rested his hands on both hips and surveyed the battle map in front of him. “We’re making great progress. Most ELSAR forces in the central valley have been pushed out, and casualties have been pretty light. At this point we’re looking at setting up camp near the first phase line of our offensive.”

Trying not to make it obvious that I was eyeing everyone in the tent, searching for Chris, I shuffled on my muddy boot heels. “So, where do you want us?”

He pointed to a hilltop on the map, radio operators and message couriers swirling around us in their tasks like fish in a coral reef. “We’ve got a forward aid station set up here, about five miles north. They radioed in a half hour ago saying they needed more supplies. You and your platoon can run that up to them, and from there you’ll range north to scout the forward enemy positions.”

*So much for finding Chris today.*

Saluting, I drew a deep breath of disappointment. “Will do, sir.”

In another fifteen minutes we rolled back out the gates of the primitive base, and into the chaos of our frontline. Moving north, I saw more evidence of the fighting, more destroyed vehicles bathed in wreathes of red flame, more sprawling bodies crumpled where they’d been cut down by gunfire, and muddy shell craters where enemy positions had been demolished by our artillery. However the roar of the howitzers only grew louder, the chatter of machine guns more pronounced, and twice we passed ambulance trucks marked with red crosses as they ferried wounded from the aid stations. Here a few of the wrecks were our own, two unarmored trucks melted to scrap metal, and one of the special up-armored pickups nearly blown in half by a rocket. Our tires gritted over spent casings that dotted the roadway in a glittering golden sheen, and I tasted the acrid gunpowder residue hanging in the air like a thin fog.

At last, a small pine-ridden knoll with an improvised tractor path leading to its crest came into view, and I held my breath as we slowly inched up the precarious trail to the summit. Barbed wire and foxholes with machine gun nests circled its perimeter, manned by the younger members of our coalition who weren’t meant for frontline work. Inside, a row of tents housed scurrying crews of researcher medics, many with rusty-red smears on their white aprons, and I recognized quite a few girls who had once wrinkled their nose at mud on the clinic floor in New Wilderness.

It was the screams, however, that sent shudders of dread through my spine the instant I opened my truck door.

Agonized cries of wounded, the metallic scent of blood on the air, and the hollow eyes of the passing nurses spoke volumes. A small cluster of blanket-covered bodies lay motionless outside one tent, close to ten sets of boots poking from underneath them in a lifeless slump. Everywhere the place oozed with human misery, including a small wire pen containing several grey-clad prisoners, most of them a mass of white cotton bandages that were already soaked through with blood. One solitary boy, perhaps no older than twelve or thirteen stood guard over the miniature POW cage with an aged shotgun, but I could tell from his indifferent slouch that he knew as well as I did that those men were going nowhere. Our own troops were prioritized by the medical staff, and as if to accentuate the need, they carried one man inside with three torniquets on the shredded remnants of what had once been a leg. Mere seconds later, I caught the cruel *slush-slush* of a saw working through flesh that made a wave of nausea rise in my stomach. He was one of ours, but obviously whatever painkillers we had were in short supply, as the poor fellow shrieked until I assumed he passed out, the saw continuing its grim work regardless of his silence. Doubtless the girls of the Researcher faction had done only what was necessary to preserve the man’s life, but still, the noise set my teeth on edge.

*Yeah, I’m not sleeping tonight.*

“Alright, squad leaders take charge and get the aid unloaded.” I barked at the others, and swallowed a sour tasting gulp of air that made me gag for the stench on it. “We’re Oscar-mike in thirty minutes.”

Desperate to report to the head nurse so I could be rid of this place as fast as possible. I pushed through the swirl of busy people, until one of the nearby machine-gunners called out to me from their dugout.

“Lieutenant!”

My legs ground to a halt, and I returned a weary salute to the three thin-faced teenagers in the foxhole, trying to look as stoic as possible. “Morning boys. You all good here? Need anything?”

For a moment, they eyed each other in pale trepidation and glanced out beyond their belt-fed weapon into the forest not fifteen yards distant.

“We’re all set ma’am.” The gunner replied, though his nervous eyes said otherwise. “It’s just . . . we wanted you to see this.”

He pointed down the hill to where a birch tree stood amongst the tangle of oaks, maples, and the few pines that clustered the top of the hill. At first, I was confused at what he meant, but then my eyes sharpened, the enhanced irises focused with ease, and I picked it out before he even said a word.

Drawn on the trunk of the birch stood a black figure, long and spindly, with a head like an upside-down triangle, a twig-like crown, and two arms extended outward. Kneeling worshipers were daubed around its feet, and wavy lines radiated from the tall figure’s hands. It had been painted in some kind of dark mixture, likely mud and rot, though I had a feeling there were more vile ingredients to it. Handprints dotted the tree around the bizarre hieroglyph, all human in shape, of varying sizes, nearly covering the trunk so that it looked mottled.

“Lieutenant?”

I blinked and looked down to find them watching me with unease.

“Should we call headquarters?” Hefting his rifle, the gunner threw a suspicious frown toward the woods. “I mean, we’ve got plenty of ammo, but if there’s something out there it’d sure be nice to know. . .”

Holding my breath, I remembered Sean’s words about the need to stay on task.

*But he did say to keep an eye out, didn’t he? Then again, what good does this do me? We still don’t know where Vecitorak is, only that his forces are close, as always.*

“Puppets make those markings all the time.” Doing my best to appear calm, I shrugged my submachine gun strap higher on one shoulder. “It’s like a dog peeing on a fence. Probably an old one anyway, so nothing to worry about.”

Unconvinced, the gunner’s mate, a scrawny red-haired kid, raises one bushy eyebrow. “It wasn’t there when we started digging in three hours ago.”

Unnerved, I stared at him and fought a shiver. That close? They’d come *that* close? The trees had obviously shaded them from the sun’s rays, but still, it wasn’t good.

*Just like the Auto Stalker stampede. Vecitorak is on the cusp of being able to move in broad daylight, and he knows it. They’re following our convoys, all the way north, waiting for the precise moment to strike.*

Still, I couldn’t panic, not now, and certainly not in front of these men. I was an officer, and that meant I had to lead by example like Chris did. Good officers didn’t show fear. Good officers found solutions when they ran into problems, good officers took care of their soldiers no matter what, and above all, good officers didn’t run from trouble when it came knocking. Even if my orders prevented me from staying, I had to do something, give some assurance to these troopers who were of the same stripe as me.

With a straightened back, I mustered up every ounce of courage I had and gave them a stern nod. “I’ll let command know. Until then, make sure there’s always two people awake on night watch, and I’ll keep one ear to my radio. If anything happens, you call for me, and we’ll drive right through to back you up, okay?”

That brought a few relieved smiles to their painted faces, and the oldest boy made an appreciative salute as I turned to leave. “Thank you, ma’am.”

Sloshing through the mud back to my own platoon sent a spike of shame through my chest, as something deep down inside begged me to stay. In spite of how awful the aid station was, with its nightmarish cries, the heartbreaking groans of the wounded and dying, I didn’t want to leave the young garrison alone. Vecitorak was out there somewhere, circling like a wolf with his cursed Puppet army, though why they hadn’t attacked yet, I couldn’t say. The aid station had enough firepower to keep him at bay, in theory at least, but I remembered how quickly our forces deteriorated the first time we’d run into the mold king’s children. However, the war waited for no one, and while I hated to go against my gut, I knew Sean was right. The sooner we reached the safety of Black Oak’s walls, the better.

*Maybe we’ll get lucky, and the rotted creep will step on a landmine or something. Surely that would do him in? Or perhaps a nice fat smart bomb, curtesy of ELSAR.*

Brooding on my misgivings, I climbed back into my truck, and Lucille pressed her face to the small window between the cab and armored compartment with a glowing smile. “Did you hear? The nurses said our forward units captured one of those fancy armored trucks ELSAR drives. It even has heated seats! They said it might all be over before Christmas.”

My spine tingled, the scars under my tattoos itched, and I glared at the nearby tree line with a sick feeling in my guts. “We’ll see.”
