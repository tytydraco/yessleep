When I was young, I found a phone and did not return it. It fell from a middle-aged man who walked in front of our school at a similar time with the end of our classes. At that time, mobile phones were not smartphones and did not have apps and the million different features that today's phones have. The flip phone in question had only two contacts saved with a small history of back and forth calls. The first contact was labeled "Him," and the second was "It." When I showed it to my buddy at the time, Nathan, he pointed out how there were outgoing calls only for "It" and that "Him" only placed calls, but the owner of the phone never called back. "It's related to the mafia," Nathan had said. "They make arrangements for robberies and kidnappings, then they throw the phone so as not to be linked with the crimes." "Do not be stupid," I had answered him. "If that was the case, they wouldn't throw it in front of our school.

Me and Nathan toyed with the phone for many days, and we even gathered the other friends that formed our group to play investigators, trying to figure out the purpose of the phone and its mysterious owner. On one such occasion, a friend of ours named Mike suggested that we call the two contacts and outright ask them the many questions we had. As it was natural for young boys of that age, the suggestion transformed into a daring contest to see who had the most courage to call the two numbers, which we believed belonged to criminals. After much debate, I grabbed the phone and placed a call to the contact that hadn't been called by that phone before, "Him." I heard the sound of ringing from the small speaker, and my heart raced until I heard the voice mail operator. The gang made numerous noises, "Threaten him!" yelled Mike, "Ask him who he is," said Nathan, and I was ready to hang up when I heard my call being picked up from the other side. Silence filled the room, and everyone was nervous. I could hear blood running through the veins of my ears. "Do you hear anything?" Nathan whispered, and I focused as hard as I could, pressing my ear to the flip phone's speaker.As I strained my ears to listen, there was a faint, raspy breathing on the other end of the line. My heart pounded louder, and I could feel a shiver running down my spine. The silence was haunting, and I couldn't muster the courage to speak. 

After what felt like an eternity, the chilling voice finally broke the silence. "Why are you calling me?" The voice was low, almost a whisper, but it sent chills down my spine. It didn't sound like the voice of a middle-aged man; instead, it had an eerie, otherworldly quality to it.I stumbled over my words, trying to sound brave, "Uh, we found this phone, and we were just curious about who you are."There was a pause, and then the voice spoke again, "Curious, you say? Well, curiosity killed the cat, didn't it?" The voice let out a low, unsettling chuckle that made my blood run cold.Fear gripped our little group, and I knew that we had gotten ourselves into something we shouldn't have. The voice on the phone continued, "You have no idea what you've stumbled upon. This phone is more than it seems, and those who meddle with it face grave consequences."I glanced at my friends, and they all looked just as terrified as I felt. "Who are you? What do you want?" I managed to stutter, my voice trembling with fear.The voice didn't answer my question directly but instead said, "You must return the phone immediately if you value your lives. I'll give you one chance to do the right thing."Without waiting for a response, the call abruptly ended. The room fell silent once again, but the weight of unease lingered in the air. None of us knew what to make of the mysterious phone, its ominous contacts, and the chilling encounter we just had.

As days passed, we couldn't shake off the feeling of being watched. Strange occurrences began to happen around us â€“ objects moving on their own, eerie sounds in the middle of the night, and the sensation of being followed wherever we went.Nathan's initial theory about the mafia didn't seem so far-fetched anymore, but it didn't explain the supernatural elements surrounding the phone. We were in over our heads, and the fear kept growing.One day, while we were discussing what to do next, the phone began to ring. We all froze, looking at the device as if it were some cursed artifact. The screen lit up, displaying the incoming call from an unknown number."Should we answer it?" Mike asked, his voice barely above a whisper.Before any of us could decide, the ringing stopped, and a text message appeared on the screen. It contained only two words: "Time's up."
