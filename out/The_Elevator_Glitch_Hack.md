*Do you wanna know when and how you'll die?*

*To take an illegal peak into the future, breaking into the fabric of ORDER in some way possible?*

*Well, let's travel through time using a time machine!* 

*A machine that lets you go Up and Down against the inevitable passage of time!*

*What's that? You don't have one? Don't worry, just make one! Using none other than Elevators!*

*Click right here to find out!*

**\~\~\~\~\~\~\~**

&#x200B;

*"That is some creepypasta crap,"* I told myself as I read through the website.

The *"Click right here"* points into an Elevator gif that opens its doors whenever I hover my mouse into it and closes when I hover away.

I must say, I was a little bit creeped out at first. You're probably thinking that I'm being a wimp, that's a fair assumption. But despite my decade's worth of experience on the weird side of the internet, that simple yet weird website is somehow the one that made me feel uneasy.

How did I even find that site? Oh, yeah! I remember. I was on my way back home from work, my mundane office job, when I saw a phone lying on the elevator floor.

Naturally, I'd given it back to security, but no one was around to claim it. No one was there to witness my acceptance of greed, so in the end, I took it for myself. At the least, I could sell this phone.

I went home and opened the phone, it was nothing that I expected. For some reason, the phone is not locked, just a swipe up for full access. 100% battery too, not a single power usage. But that's not even the weirdest part about it, the time set on the phone is 99:99 and the date is 99/99/9999.

*"Huh, I didn't even know that was possible."* I thought to myself at the time. I looked at all the apps but it was empty, a barren phone void of uses apart from the basic apps.

The gallery was nothing but a picture of a plain blue sky, tens of them. Also, there are pictures of an elevator that faces another elevator, sorta like an elevator that opens up on another elevator, tens of those as well.

*"Bunch of weird AI shit"* I figured.

Apart from meaningless images, there was nothing else apart from a Note app. There lies a singular note made on the date 99/99/9999. And on the note was a URL:

**iGn01UBGHU74nBINbK.com**

Something like that.

I couldn't remember the exact combination of the URL, but it's pretty much like that. A random mush of letters and numbers. And that is how I found that website. That weird website on a weird phone was a perfect little side adventure for my extremely curious persona.

The site is very simplistic. Plain blue sky with no clouds just like on the phone and texts in black font. The text is what is shown above, an invitation to make a time machine.

After reading through that weird site, I hovered my mouse at the Elevator gif. The elevator image opened and made my cursor into a "pointing glove", indicating that it'll do something once clicked. I paused, contemplating.

*"This is my old backup laptop, more than ready to be blown by viruses. Why am I pausing? No way I'm legitimately scared, right?"* I took a deep breath and clicked.

**DING!** The sound of an elevator.

It downloaded a PDF and automatically closed the website right after it finished.  I wanted to do some nerdy deep dive into the site, like inspecting the element and all but it closed automatically. I attempted to go back to the site and re-enter the URL, but it gave me a 404 error.

*"oh! I see. Guess I'm done with that,"* I opened the PDF that it downloaded. Its title on my downloads folder is another random set of letters and numbers.

**aIdjaM2uajO91ansSF1a.PDF**, something like that.

Inside was a set of instructions. But seeing what it wants me to do, I think this is more of a ritual.

**THE ELEVATOR GLITCH HACK**

by: RuckanFeller-0909

Warning: *All consequences upon failure to follow the instructions are not the author's fault and do not invalidate the authenticity of the exploit.*

Hello, my friend.

You weren't chosen, you weren't special. 

Were you lucky or unlucky? That's for you to make.

Welcome to the tutorial. A way to make an Elevator into a time machine! You'll be able to glitch an asset and use it to travel on your death date! Isn't that something!?

If done correctly, the elevator will open and give you a front-row seat on how you will die! Awesome! Unfortunately, you won't be able to step outside, but hey! At least you got some sneaky spoilers.

Will you see yourself surrounded by your future family as you pass in peace? Or will it be a gory mess, an accident that'll mangle yourself? or maybe, an execution video of a murder victim? Whatever you see, it's 100% authentic and 100% will happen. Try as you might, your destiny is certain.

So! Let's get to the meat of it! Elevators! What do I do?

&#x200B;

**PREPARE** \- **EXECUTE** \- **WARNING**

First is **preparation**, you need to prepare 4 things.

&#x200B;

*1ST - Get a lamb.*

Yes, a living breathing lamb. It's not 100% necessary, but better safe than sorry.

&#x200B;

*2ND - Pick an Elevator.*

The Elevator must be a closed one with no air pockets from the outside. Secondly, the Elevator must be at a structure that allows it to travel at 10 levels of floors, any lesser than that won't work. Each floor must also be accessible and not dysfunctional, especially the 4th-floor.

&#x200B;

*3RD - Pick a structure.*

You need a quiet place. No people. No hindrance. The glitch won't work if you've been observed at any point, your attempt will be invalidated and nothing will happen, so do it somewhere quiet.

&#x200B;

*4TH- Pick a date.*

You have to start the Glitch at 2:23 AM. It only works if the ritual is started at the window of 2:23:00 AM until 2:23:58 AM, any attempts outside that time frame won't work. You and the lamb must be at the Elevator at 2:22 AM at least. Just you and the lamb, any more will result in nothingness.

&#x200B;

**ELEVATOR GLITCH HACK (EXECUTION)**

*This is how the glitch is to be performed.*

&#x200B;

**STEP A:** ***Enter at the bottom floor.***

Albeit the first floor, a garage, or a basement. Enter the Elevator from the lowest possible level. Bring the lamb with you.

&#x200B;

**STEP B:** ***Go to the top.***

Go at the highest possible level using the Elevator. Press the button to Top-floor at precisely 2:23 AM, this will begin the glitch. Now going up 10 floors or more at 2:23 AM, the elevator is now an asset that is *out of bounds*. It's up to you now whether it'll continue slipping outside or not.

&#x200B;

**STEP C:** ***Peek.***

Once at the top, you need to commence a peek event. It is simply you poking your head to scan the outside as much as possible. Don't take a step outside or it'll invalidate your attempt. Don't use a flashlight or it'll give away your position.

*What are you looking for?* I'll tell you later. But 9 times out of 10, it should be empty and you're good to go.

&#x200B;

**STEP D:** ***Go to the bottom.***

Having scanned the top floor and seen it's clear, you now need to go back down to the very bottom. Press the button, going back towards the lowest floor. Once at the bottom, Peek again.

If the coast is clear then congratulations, *you completed one cycle*. 

The elevator that closed its doors at 2:23 AM had successfully traveled up and down without being compromised. One cycle out of Four. Repeat the process for three more times and...

&#x200B;

**STEP E:** ***Enjoy*** *the exploit.*

If done correctly, you should be heading down for the fourth time. At that point, the elevator will come to a very sudden halt and the lights will die out, but don't be afraid, it means you've glitched.You've successfully glitched along with the elevator illegally. The lights will turn back on and you'll be able to see your death.

Take out your phone, it'll be glitched too. You'll see a different time and date, it'll be the moment you die. I recommend browsing your image gallery to see whatever files you've got at that moment in the future. You can potentially spoil future family pictures, moments of your life, or photos of people that you'll soon meet within your life. Basically, the contents of your future phone gallery. But don't blame me if there's only porn.

During this victory sequence, the door of the Elevator will be open for viewing only and you won't be able to step outside. You'll be bounded by *jaQxiaI8*, so try as you might, you'll be boxed in there, only to watch. The glitch is not meant to take you into the future to make a change, but instead to simply have a sneaky look.

After a few moments, precisely 482 seconds after the final breath of your future self, the doors will close, the lights will turn off and Your phone will shut down. After a minute of silence, the elevator would soon run again, heading back towards the 4th-floor.

If done perfectly, you'll see your death and come back out on the 4th-floor along with the lamb. You can do whatever you want with that lamb, it's just an unused resource. Pat yourself at the back for your perfect Elevator Glitch Hack. Congratulations.

&#x200B;

**WARNINGS**

Remember these very carefully. These are the obstacles during the ritual that might mess things up very very badly.

&#x200B;

**WARNING:** *Civilian Encounter*

The main glitch is repetitively going back and forth to the lowest possible level from the highest possible level using the Elevator. Doing it precisely at 2:23 AM when there's a *background rupture* and cycling up and down for four times.*What's up with the peek event?* Every time the Elevator opens up, either Top-floor or Bottom-floor, poke your head out and peek. Scan the current floor. Do not use any form of flashlight that'll reveal your position, just peek with your eyes.

If you see a person during a peek event, simply just call it a day and try again tomorrow. The glitch is invalidated, a conscious observer potentially saw you or the Elevator and the glitch won't work.

&#x200B;

**WARNING:** *Intruder Encounter*

During peek events, apart from eyeing out civilians, you might have a chance of seeing a pair of red eyes in the dark. It means that the Elevator is compromised before the ritual has even started, immediately get back into the Elevator and go to the 4th-floor. Be very quick.

Once on the 4th-floor, you must step out of the elevator and send it back on wherever you encounter j@#¶£ππ. Leave the lamb inside and let it go back to the j@#¶£ππ.  If you wait, the elevator will soon come back to the 4th floor. But when it does, you better be out of there already. Don't wait, use the stairs and run.

j@#¶£ππ encounter means that the glitch has been compromised. Try again another day but on a different structure. Don't use the same structure, pick another one or this will happen again. This means that this specific structure is a No-No. Any elevators on that structure are *infested? guarded? swarmed?* I don't know exactly, but baddies are going to interfere every time.  I know it's a hassle to find another quiet building but hey, you're alive! unlike the lamb.

&#x200B;

**WARNING:** *Unknown Presser*

During the glitch, you will be pressing the keypad back and forth from the Bottom-floor to the Top-floor. You need to do the cycle for 4 times, meaning that the keypad will be used 8 times. 4 times going Up and 4 times going down. Be very mindful of this, *I mean it.*

If you just finished peeking and the elevator *somehow* automatically designated itself at the next stop without you pressing it in the keypad yourself, like if you finish peeking at the top and after putting your head back inside, the elevator automatically closed and head straight to the bottom as if you did it yourself, then you have an *Unknown Presser* issue.

Cancel it out, Spam the 4th-floor button to order a stop before going all the way to where the Elevator has been called. Evacuate on the 4th floor with your lamb and try again tomorrow.

And that's all of it! Simple as making a pie!

May the sight of your death please you.

**\~\~\~\~\~\~\~**

&#x200B;

**...**

I sat there in silence, digesting in my brain the ridiculousness that I just read.

It sounds so unrealistic yet so legitimate.

*"HAHAHAHAHAHAHA, No fucking way this shit is real,"* I remember laughing at myself.

But did I do it? Of course I did! I don't really know why. Is it my mundane life? Is it my curiosity for the paranormal? I can't tell, but whatever it is, I did it. I'm actually looking forward to something after a long time.

My first attempt is at an abandoned building. I got my lamb *"Mrs. Medium Rare"* and went ahead to the building at 2:20 AM. I know it's a steak reference, not a lamb, but whatever, I liked it.

The building was a 13-floored building that was being renovated, the outside area was walled off from the public and no one was inside tonight apart from me and *mrs.MediumRare*. The floors are barren with any furniture apart from some ladders and construction equipment. Some windows haven't had any glass panes despite being on a high floor, leaving the outside open.

*"Perfect for suicide ghosts, wonder if someone jumped in here,"* I thought to myself.

**DING!** The Elevator has arrived at the bottom floor.

I started the glitch. With *MrsMediumRare*, We entered the Elevator and pressed the Top-Floor button at precisely 2:23 AM.

*3rd...*

*4th...*

The Elevator glitching has begun.

*7th..*

*8th...*

I don't know what to expect, I'm both frightened and excited.

*11th...*

*12th...*

**DING!**

I have arrived at the Top-floor. It was pitch black. A moronic side of myself almost wanted to scream *"Pizza Delivery here!"* that will echo loudly throughout the floor. But remembering the rule to not use a flashlight to *avoid giving away your position* made me stop.

I started peeking. The elevator is between a long dark hallway with a concrete floor.  I'm scanning each side without a flashlight just like what it said. At both ends of the hallways were turns that led to a deeper part of the floor. On their walls are windows that are open to the outside, a 13-storey height fall.

I keep an eye for almost 5 minutes, making sure that the floor is empty on both sides.

*"Nothing to the left... nothing to the right... Alright, I think I should move on now,"* After making a thorough scan. I pressed the Bottom-Floor and proceeded with the glitch. Things went surprisingly smoothly. I did what the instructions told me to. I went to the top precisely at 2:23, peeked, went back down, peeked, etc.

It all went well, well until the 3rd cycle.

&#x200B;

**DING!**

I peeked and scanned the 13th-floor for the final and fourth time. I feel a little tremble knowing that this is my last scan before actually completing the ritual. Even if there's nothing at the bottom, I gotta admit that this had been very fun, especially doing it in an isolated building with a constant mee-ee-eee from *mrs.MediumRare*.

You know, buildings don't really label their 13th floor as "13th floor". So I'm actually scanning the abandoned "14th" floor.

I was way too focused on the ending that what I saw knocked me back to the present situation like a punch. At the corner, something new, something that wasn't there before. I spotted it.

*"What. the. fuck. is. that?"*

Just like what the Warning said. Two red eyes, partially glowing and hiding at the very long end of the hallway, peeking right back at the Elevator. I can't see shit, just red eyes. But that's enough for me to know that this is trouble, a life and death trouble.

"*Oh my fuck! Oh my fuck! what do I do, what do I do. 4th-floor! Head to the 4th-floor, right? Fuck"* Chills ran down my spine making my hair stand up. 

I squinted to see if I was actually seeing the truth, that was my mistake. It realized that I spotted it when it saw me focusing my head on its hiding spot.

**BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!** 

A very loud sound of alarm suddenly went off. I covered my ears from the deafening noise.

*"What in the fuck!?"* this floor shouldn't have any alarm like this installed.

The red eyes. It ran hastily, coming out of the corner, charging straight at the Elevator. Two red glowing eyes coming in closer and closer. I panicked. I immediately shoved my head back at the elevator and spammed the 4th-floor button.

The sound of the machinery whirs as I felt the slowness of how long this Elevator door closes.

The eyes are fast, but not enough to catch a closing Elevator door. The door closes on its face, but the thing behind it pounds the door.

**THUD! THUD! THUD!**

**SCRATCH! SCRATCH!**

The thing is scratching the metal door and the sounds of its nails digging through metal is a pain to hear, like a fork scraping a plate.

**SCRATCH! SCRATCH!**

The elevator descends and the scratching slowly fade as I leave it behind.

&#x200B;

*7th....*

*6th...*

*5th..*

**DING!**

I reached the 4th-floor and stepped out quickly. This is far from over.

With my heart pounding hard, I sent the elevator back up to the 13th-floor and left m*rs.MediumRare* to face whatever it was. The Elevator went up and I ran towards the stairs.

That was my first attempt, a failed glitch.

&#x200B;

The next day, my friend who's renovating the building, the friend who helped me find it, contacted me.

*"Hey! Jacob! What's up man!"* I said as I accepted his call.

*"Sammy, what in the actual fuck!? Care to explain!?"*

*"What's up with you?"* I replied, feigning innocence.

*"What do you mean what's up with me? More like what's up with you? What the fuck did you do to the building? What the fuck happened in here!?"*

*"What do you mean Jacob? Just fucking say it!?"*

*"The fucking Elevator Sammy! it's like an animal had exploded inside here! Did you know about this shit!? Blood and guts were everywhere in the elevator! Liver, intestines, fur, blood, what the fuck!? We're lucky the thing is somehow still running!"* I can't believe a thing he's saying. Is that really what happened to poor m*rsMediumRare.* Could that have been me if I'm a second slower?

*"Wow, man that's crazy. I don't know, seriously."*

*"Oh you don't know!? Animal gore at the building!? Not so shocking to you, huh? Almost as if you already know it's there? Almost as if you're the only one that had access outside of staff workers thanks to me? What the fuck di---"*

I hung up on him.

You know, after what happened. You'd think that it'll be the last for me, right? 

But no, I'm a dumbass who wants to see through this. The Intruder encounter just raised the stakes, it affirms its legitimacy. I nearly made it last time. I thought I can do this. I immediately searched for another viable Elevator.

My final attempt was on a building of 19 floors.

The building, unlike the first, was made for busy morning office work. A functional modern building. Lively during the day but it's completely asleep off at night, a perfect setting for my second attempt.

The guards had completed their sweep at 1 AM and retreated to their rooms. That was my cue to make a move for the second attempt at glitching.

I bought my second lamb and snuck by. I went by the very bottom, 2G. A second-level underground Parking lot. I called in the Elevator.

**DING!** Let my final attempt begin.

I pressed towards the 19th floor at 2:23 AM with my lamb inside.

The sound of machinery whirring as the Elevator door closed made my heart pound out of excitement.

*17th...*

*18th...*

**DING!**

The 19th floor, It was dark as all lights were shut but I began peeking. I knew what to look for besides a human now.

*looks to the left... looks to the right... hmm..*

Nothing of significance it seems, just the ordinary office floor filled with cubicles and computers. I pushed the keypad for the bottom floor yet again. Things are going well.

Now you might ask, why am I recording this audio? Well, it's because I messed up. I messed up very very badly.

It was the third cycle yet again. My last stop at the 19th-floor and I'm currently peeking for the final time. I don't know why, It must've been my fear from the previous attempt, the reason I messed up so badly.

I peeked carefully, going from corners to corners, cubicle to cubicle. There were more hiding spots to keep an eye out this time, but the coast was clear, nothing new on the 19th-floor.

I did it. I sigh in relief, no red eyes, no whatever that thing is, no nothing. I pull my head back into the elevator and lean to its wall as the Elevator starts to head down to the bottom for the final time. Leading me to the final event of the ritual.

I sigh, I'm glad, I did it! A complete and uncompromised Elevator Glitch. No civilians, and no red eyes.I brace myself, readying to see how will my life end. A peek towards the future. However, to me, the real victory is not seeing the prize, but completing the ritual cleanly. All my dedication to ***press on*** had brought me this success.

*wait... press on*.... press on? I didn't remember pressing the Elevator keypad. It went on its own.

*2nd....*

*1st...*

*1G..*

**DING!** 

The elevator door opens.

What greeted me behind the Elevator was not what I expected, not a vision of the future. I remember a warning, that section about an Unknown Presser. To be sharp and stop the ritual when compromised.

I started breathing heavily. I didn't press the for ground button? Have I failed? I looked at what came outside.

It was blank, an infinite fall, endless blue. I peeked my head outside and saw nothing but blue, the same as the sky but without clouds. I looked above and saw an endless roof of flat gray concrete way above the sky, covering everything.

An infinite space of blue sky in all directions except the flat gray roof above. It seems that I'm way up in the sky, but there was no wind, no breeze, no clouds, nothing. It's almost as if I'm clipped at the bottom of the world, alone in a floating open box.

*"NO!NO!NO!NO!NO!NO!NO!NO!"*

I desperately pressed any buttons off of the keypad. But all the floors are grayed out, they weren't lit nor doing anything. Nothing works apart from one lit button, the 19th-floor. I press it repetitively and desperately.

*17th..*

*18th...*

**DING!**

When the door opened, it wasn't the 19th-floor that I peeked earlier. Instead, *somehow*, it was the same elevator I was in. My elevator had opened up to yet another elevator. *Am I trapped?*

I breathe heavily and rapidly as claustrophobia crept in. I desperately went back and forth to either the bottom of the world or a mirror replica of the elevator.

I tried everything. I pushed the lamb off, it went straight at the bottom and it fell until my eyes could no longer see it. I hopped into the mirrored elevator and tried its only working button, going straight down toward the endless pit of the world.

How long have I been going back and forth?

**DING!**

An hour or two?

**DING! DING!**

I panted, I panted. I desperately tried the same thing over and over again.

**DING! DING! DING!**

My heart is pounding, My heart is pounding. This is the end.

**DING! DING! DING! DING! DING! DING! DING!**

Up, Down, Up, Down, Up, Down, Up. Meaningless Up, Endless Down. Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out. *This is the end*. I fainted.

&#x200B;

When I woke up, I  hoped to see myself waking up in my bed, to awake from this nightmare. But I saw the sight of a mirrored elevator in front of me. This nightmare that I fell onto, wasn't in my head, but my reality.

I'm done.

I pushed the button going down. The machinery behind the metal door whirs as the door closes.

*19th....*

*18th....*

*17th....*

The Elevator Glitch. I failed.

*16th....*

*15th....*

*14th....*

*13th....*

I fucked up, I really did.

*12th....*

*11th....*

*Fine..*

*10th....*

*9th....*

I meditated and cleared my mind, I have accepted my death. No way out, no way back.

*8th....*

*7th....*

I decided that I would take the leap of faith. I'll jump down there, at the endless void of emptiness, and take my chances.

*6th....*

*5th....*

*4th....*

*3rd....*

I picked up my phone and saw the time at 99:99 and the date at 99/99/9999. I tried the internet but nothing works. As this elevator slowly reaches down, soon, I'll jump.

*2nd....*

*1st...*

*1G..*

**DING!**

That's all from me. This is the end, goodbye.

**END OF AUDIO.**

**\~\~\~\~\~\~\~**

&#x200B;

Greetings, OP here.

I found this cell phone at my work building, lying on the elevator floor. I wanted to keep this phone because it's unlocked (yes it's evil) but I found this freaky file, the only file in the phone, this audio recording.

This building where I worked had a total of 19 floors and two underground parking areas just like in the story. The fact that according to the phone, the voice recording is made at 99/99/9999 is freaky. Almost like in the story.

I didn't know any *"Sammy"* or *"Jacob"* characters but it's here in the recording and it freaked me out. I figure it's worth sharing here.
