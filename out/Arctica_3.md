The snowstorm came roaring from the distance. It took nearly half an hour to reach us. It spread from one kissed horizon to the next. There was no way to outrun it. Still, we tried. The crawler chugged petrol and huffed on the fumes as it made its drunken stumble across the ice, the front grill gaping as it swallowed boulders of snow, lifting the front wheels into the air until it was nothing but blue in the windshield, then the rear tires went airborne, white, as we seesawed our way through unforgiving terrain.

"I can't see 3 meters out," Chloe shouted at me.

I looked through the windshield and could see the arm extended outward, but the tire with the sensors were completely missing from view. "It's only going to get worse," I told her. "Keep driving!"

By now we were completely covered in the first wisps. It was jarring to see the world surrounded by the snow in every direction, it twisted and turned ' fast as lightning, looking like static through every window. And even though we were windstruck I could hear it behind me, the growing beast wiping over the entire board, clean, and we were but a mark in its way.

"Do you hear that?"

I nodded. It was a sound I had only read about in the handbooks. At the time it didn't make sense, but our instructor assured us that if we were ever unlucky enough to hear it, we would instantly understand what he meant. And if we heard it, "Well let's just say. Don't even worry about praying. Because you won't even be able to hear the thoughts in your own head."

"It's like someone is gurgling rotten teeth!"

Chloe shook her head and I watched her lips form on her face but no sound came out, none that I could hear as we were engulfed. The hail came in the size of pennies at first, but soon they began growing.

I glanced down at the monitor, the readings were inconclusive. "Come on you piece of shit, work." I hit the side of it with my glove. Still nothing. I could feel my hand throbbing underneath the material. It was cold in here. I glanced at the temperature. It was dropping every second.

In the arm of the storm, temperatures could get below 60 degrees. In 1983, near Vostok station, it got even colder than that. At negative 50 degrees, a passing wind can take your nose and ears. At 100, the body starts to freeze in place. I looked at the readings and saw the arrow head for the red.

"We have to get warm," I struggled to remember. Soon it was all I could think of as I reached for the hot pads, crushing them between my gloves until they popped. I watched the foil expand until it was bloated around the middle. I offered it to Chloe but she refused to take her eyes off the road in front of us. They were glued into the windshield, staring out into white abyss, hypnotizing her into place.

I think I tried to say something, maybe at how pointless it was to be that vigilante during this time. At these speeds ' if there were anything in our way, we would hit it, any markers, and we would still miss it. These thoughts haunted me as I looked forward and saw the arm start to dip downward, its head still missing from the white swallow before us as we began to fall in slow motion.

Suddenly my stomach felt as if a knife had plunged its cold steel into my abdomen, the tip spooning out flecks of my belly button as it scraped my spine. Reopening the mouth I first ate from my mother. As we dropped. The headlong of the crawler crashed into a part of the ice as the walls speared upward in every direction. The yellow eyes of the crawler blinked as darkness came in bursts around us before it all just became black.

When I woke up, it wasn't due to the cold. At this point, I had already welcomed it like a friend. It was the sound of the steel crumpling that shook me from going gently. I lazily glanced over and saw Chloe's neck slumped into her chest. An orange beacon was blinking on the dash. And a splinter of light reflected off the ice as the other headlamp laid dead in front of us.

"Chloe," I murmured. "Chloe?" I shook her slightly but she wouldn't stir, though I could see the faint trails of life coming from her nostrils and knew that she was breathing. So I took the chance to observe our surroundings.

We had fallen through a crevasse, this much was clear. Walls of ice in every direction and a darkness so deep below us that I couldn't even call it black, only an absence. The crawler looked to be wedged. And the sky above us was nothing but an angry howl of ice and fury.

The steel groaned again.

For the first time I could see it with my eyes, the ice sheets moving. It was both beautiful and terrifying. A mixture of feelings I'd never thought possible in this situation. For a second my mind reasoned that it wouldn't be so bad...if I were to die like this. At least it would be quick, and painless.

Those thoughts left me when I see a rock of ice, also wedged between the sheets, ahead. It was barley visible by the low light. Splinter. Fine white lines etched into its near spherical shape as it cracked. I could hear it from here. The thing seemed to be looking up at me, begging, as the walls crushed it flat, its scream crackling into the abyss as it was smothered by its two giant siblings on either side.

The frame of the crawler buckled again. "Chloe." She stirred this time. "We have to get out of here."

She shook her head, "It's hopeless." Chloe pointed an exposed hand at the dash. "All we can do is wait."

I looked at the orange beacon, "They're never going to find us. They can't get through the storm."

"And what are we going to do? Once we climb out? We'd die in 3 minutes without the crawler up there."

Another groan came from the steel as the ice shifted.

"We're going to be crushed to death down here if we don't do anything."

Before Chloe could protest, another shift caused the pillar to collapse. The steel folded like paper.

"Shit."

She scrambled to the passenger side, her boots pressing against my thigh as she managed to get out of the way. "Grab the ice picks, and the rope," she hurriedly rolled the window down until it became stuck. I reached in the back to grab our equipment while she kicked away a portion of the glass. "Help me out," she asked without permission as I felt her weight on my side. I push until her legs disappear overhead.

"Chloe?"

All I see is a hand reaching down from above, "Hand me an axe. And the rope."

I slowly handed her both items, watching them disappear from view as her footprints clatter above me. "Chloe?" I wait for a few seconds before I see the rope re-appear.

"Come on, what are you waiting for?"

I grab the rope and secured it to my waist. Before I start to climb out, I see the beacon on the dash blinking. I plucked it from the stand and stashed it between my jacket. Big mistake, as my body shuddered from the cold.

"Come on," she calls again.

I yanked on the rope and somehow managed to hoist myself upward. My muscles shook unsteadily as I clamper onto the roof of the crawler. I stick my leg under a loading rail attached to the top and wrap my knee around it, gasping a lungful of air as I laid flat in near exhaustion.

I had barley closed my eyes when I start to hear the sound of steel again. Except this time, it was that of an ice screw which Chloe was turning into the wall face. "These will hold us," she told me.

"We should climb to the top."

"But not all the way through."

"Why not," I demanded. "The storms mostly blown over." I looked at my watch. It was cracked and had stopped working. "We must have been down here for hours."

"Being exposed could kill us. The way the ice structure is at currently. It's warmer down here, than up there."

I wasn't about to argue with her, but every fiber of my being told me to get out of here. I had never been claustrophobic, but seeing the walls, face to face, on either side now...it was something that I was starting to develop.

"I can't breathe."

"Calm down," she told me. "Try to ' slowly through your nose."

"I can't breathe!"

I grab at my coat, I hear the buttons pop as I search for the zipper.

"Calm down," she says again.

I could see the walls starting to close. The steel beneath me groaned again as it crumpled. The uneven ice spiked on either side slowly began to close as their tips tickled each other like a rolled up centipede.

Chloe had been trying to keep me still, but now both of us were frozen in place. Watching, waiting, for the ice sheets to stop moving. When it settled again, I whispered, "I can't breathe."

"Shut up."

I tap at my chest with my hand to indicate my condition, and that was when Chloe screamed.

The crawler had been slowly crushing below us, finally gave way when the ice shifted. It dropped from below our feet and I went with it.

If it weren't for the rope that was attached to Chloe. I would have fallen to my death. I felt her midsection buckle as it took my weight. It almost felt as if I would snap her in half. But I didn't care as I clawed vigorously at the wall. The tips of my fingers peeling back the nails inside of my glove as I tried to find a hold.

I could hear Chloe yelling for me to stop, from above, but my mind was in a panic. I pushed my feet against the wall and it wasn't until my back hit the other side, that I began to be truly afraid. The sheets had moved so much that they weren't but a few feet apart by now. The crevasse was collapsing, closing in on either side.

"Pincer!"

Snow began falling as the ice tried swallowing us whole. I could see Chloe wiggling her way to the top. The cut rope dangling beneath her like a tail as she grew smaller. "Wait," I croaked. "Wait!"

I scrambled upwards after her, pushing my body against either side as it kept getting closer, and closer. I could hear the crawler crying below me as the light bobbed my shadow. My feet were raw and my hands felt like bloody stumps attached to the ends of my wrists but I was finally nearing the top.

There was hardly any room and with each passing second it got tighter. I wasn't but a few feet from escape when I finally felt stuck, the room between me had become less than a foot, it was merely a crack at this point. I wiggled trying to free myself but my legs wouldn't dislodge.

I could see Chloe's face staring down at me. She was screaming, but I couldn't hear her. The storm was still blowing wildly and she was reaching her hand down at me. I hear another crack as the sheets shifted and my vision began to blur.

It was right before I blacked out that I felt something tugging around my arms. It felt as if they would be yanked right out of their sockets. Suddenly something gave, the pressure around my leg was gone and I was pulled out into the storm.

It was only when I felt the tears start freezing on my cheek that I realized, that the storm had already passed. And the raging blast of snow was from the helicopter whirling nearby. I could see someone helping Chloe onboard. And a stretcher had been brought out for me as two others strapped me down. I clutched the beacon in my hands dearly, as I slowly drifted to sleep.

"You're awake."

"Where am I?"

"At the Ross Research Base."

"Where's Chloe?"

"She's recovering."

"What's going on?"

The woman turned to look at me. I recognized her, though I've never been formally introduced. "I'm Dr. Kelsie Grant." Her lab coat was stiff as she turned to the figure in the door. He was tall and weather worn, though the brace on his knee made it so he couldn't stand upright fully. The red Canadian jacket still on his shoulders. And he looked angry.

"London?"

"Why did you leave him," Dr. Grant asked. "You went against protocol. Against one of the company rules."

"Oh my god. London." I could feel the tears welling in my eyes. "You're alive. How?"

"I climbed out of the tube after I had fallen through. Now, don't look surprised. That's my take. Because imagine my horror when I crawled out and saw you two taking off in the crawler. Leaving me stranded, left for dead to suffer in the cold by myself."

"London we thought you were dead. That...it took you."

"The drill? The thing didn't fall 5 feet. It was collapsed you fucking idiot! Do you know how cold I was?" I could see his face stutter. "How miserable?" He held up accusatory finger, "If I hadn't figured out a way to send a signal through the Pixie Tube antennas I would have died!" He turned to Dr. Grant, "This is negligence at its finest. An utter betrayal on the ice. What's the head office going to do about this?"

"London, we didn't know." I looked at him desperately, "We thought. You thought. There was something down there."

He rounded on me, "What the hell are you talking about? Have you two gone crazy?"

"London," I begged.

"I'm going to make sure neither of you ever work here again. I'm going to make sure everyone knows what you did." He gets in my face, "They'll never trust you near a block of ice, for the rest of your lives. You won't even get an ice cube for your drink without thinking the word lawsuit."

Before I could say anything else, someone else came to the door. I didn't recognize him but he addressed Dr. Grant all the same, "I think you have to come see this." She looked at him, and he nodded. This caused Dr. Grant to get out of the chair and follow the man.

London watched her walk away, turning to me before he followed her out, "We're not through. You hear me?"

When they had left me alone in the room. The smell of antiseptic in the air and the machines buzzing and beeping around me, I realized that I couldn't stand another minute of being alone, so I followed them out. Hobbling as the bandages to my torso limited my movement. Tracking my way down the long hall, passing by the sleeping quarters until I saw where many others have gathered, near the large double windows carved into the concrete.

I tried peering through their shoulders but it was difficult to discern what was happening out there. It wasn't until I got closer, standing nearly next to London that I noticed what everyone was looking at.

Outside on a hill of snow and ice, just far away enough that it was difficult to make out their faces, stood a line of shadows in various states of dress. Five figures on the ridge, standing there, staring in our direction.

I glanced at the temperature outside, it read negative 68 degrees.

No one could withstand those temperatures unprotected.

"How long have they been standing out there," I hear Dr. Grant ask.

"I don't know. Someone noticed it a few minutes ago. But they could have been there for hours."

"Lock this place down. No one's to come in. Or out." Dr. Grant turned to look at me. "Tell me everything."
