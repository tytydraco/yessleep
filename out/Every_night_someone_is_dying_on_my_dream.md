It was the most painful scream I had ever heard.

Then I woke up.

There were only a few minutes left before my shift started. I quickly pulled myself together, left the house, and set out.

ut the things I had seen stayed in my head all the way. In the dream, I was in a dark alley. I was running after someone. Everything was blurry, as if seen through a layer of mist. Then the woman fell. A hand rose into the air and a scream was heard.

I didn’t even remember how I got to work. Fred waved at me. My closest friend at work. We chatted a bit. I handled the routine accounting tasks.

It was a nightmare, just a nightmare.

The next night, I must have worked until about two in the morning. When I suddenly opened my eyes, I was in a secluded place, like between two buildings.  
“–Please don’t… Please… stay away.”  
I turned my head to the right. A male silhouette was lying on the ground. One hand was in the air, begging.  
“–Please…”  
The sound of a body being slashed cut off his words. Not even a scream was heard. Only the man’s last breath. I didn’t just hear it.

I felt it.

When I woke up, I was at my desk. My desk lamp was on. My alarm was ringing on the side. With difficulty I reached out and turned it off. I was probably under too much stress at work. So many reports to prepare. So many things to document. My mind was so tangled, that must have been why I was having such dreams.

So here was another normal day. I had forgotten my nightmare. Until I went to bed that evening. I waited a bit at the head of the bed.

What if I saw it again?

After lying down, I couldn’t sleep for quite a while.

Another nightmare.

This time I wasn’t outside. I was inside a house, my footsteps echoing. A woman was sitting on the couch watching TV. She didn’t notice me. I was going toward her. Even when I tensed my body to stop, nothing changed. I saw the knife in my hand raised into the air. Suddenly, I grabbed the woman’s neck and…  
It’s better if I don’t write the rest.

And again, I woke up. Covered in sweat.

What was happening to me?

I didn’t even remember how I got to work. When Fred saw me at the door, his eyes widened.  
“–Cillian, are you okay?”  
I didn’t want to worry him. I just told him I couldn’t sleep. He bought me a coffee and advised me to take a sleeping pill that night. Because of my condition, the idea of pills didn’t sound unreasonable. That night I took them and really did sleep well, relatively speaking. The next day I went to work more energetic. For the next few days I didn’t dream at all. I thought the nightmare ordeal was over.

About a week later, one night I suddenly heard crying. I was inside a huge warehouse, or somewhere like it. But this time, it was more familiar than the other places.  
It was the abandoned factory just outside the city. When the crying grew louder, I looked down. There was a man curled up on the ground. A sudden kick to his stomach made him curl up even tighter. His voice went silent. Moonlight filtered through the broken window above. I saw the glint of the knife’s sharp edge. And then, as always, I woke up.

I was a bit late to work. I ran into my grumpy boss. I was sure he was about to give me an hour-long disciplinary lecture. Luckily Fred stepped in, told him I wasn’t doing too well these days, and saved me.  
“–Thanks, man,” I said. Just as I turned to leave, he grabbed my arm.  
“–Cillian, what’s going on?”  
“What do you mean?”  
“–Coming to work sleepless, spacing out… Are you cheating on your wife?”  
“I’m not even married, Fred.”  
He laughed and slapped my shoulder.  
“–I’m joking, loosen up a bit.”  
I laughed with him. After all, he was my friend. I had no reason not to tell him what I was going through. I sat down and told him about the nightmares I’d been having. The less bloody versions, at least. By the time I finished, a thoughtful expression had settled on his face. I told him these were insignificant things. But he had taken them very seriously. In fact, I’d almost say… he was scared. He asked me a bunch of questions. What I felt in the dream, for example—not emotions, but concrete things: cold, light, humidity…

To most of them, I just said I didn’t know.

Finally, to reassure him, I added that I would see a psychologist and went back to my work.

That night on the way home, heavy rain started and lasted all night, I even remembered it while falling asleep.

And while waking up.

I could hear the rain more clearly, I was soaked. I was outside. There was a dumpster next to me. I couldn’t fully define where I was. On the edge of the sidewalk, I saw a man groaning. From his clothing, it was obvious he was homeless. He was shouting something. His collar was being grabbed and pulled up by someone. I saw that knife, the one that always ended my dreams; this time blood was dripping from its cold metal. The man whimpered in a higher pitch. The knife was about to fall and end him.

But it stopped, in mid-air, for seconds.

Suddenly I felt watched. Someone was looking at me. But I couldn’t see them. Yet I could swear.

The homeless man’s eyes shifted away from the knife, to something else.

Then the sound of the knife viciously tearing through the dirty coat roared in my ears. This time… it was different, crueler, angrier.

I woke up, shivering. I pulled the blanket over me. It was still dark outside. I thought I’d sleep a bit more.

But I was still cold. I pulled the blanket tighter. The blanket was cold too.

Something was wrong.

When I turned on the light, I nearly screamed at what I saw.

I was wet, my bed was wet. Water was dripping where I stood. Water was flowing from me. Had I taken a shower in my sleep? Or…

Realistic dreams… the sounds… the endless sleeplessness…

In my right hand, something else was dripping along with the water.

Blood.

But I wasn’t wounded.

There were stains on my pajamas too. Dotted.

I remembered the rain, how much it had poured… it had stopped now, but.

Was it a dream? Or… wasn’t it? Did I kill them? All of them…  
I had done it.

I grabbed my phone and called Fred. Told him to come to my house. He asked me a thousand times what was going on and if I was okay. I just said come.

Because he was the only one who wouldn’t call the police when he saw me like this.

When he knocked, I ran to open the door. As I had guessed, the moment he saw me he covered his mouth with his hand.  
“–You… What have you done?”  
I let him in. I was shivering because I was soaked. I had already told him about the dreams I’d been having. I told him every detail of tonight’s as well.  
“–I woke up soaking wet, Fred. And there’s blood. There’s blood on me. I’m doing this. It’s not a dream.”

His face took on the most serious expression I’d ever seen.

“–I should go to the police… I should tell everything. I’ve killed all those people. I’m a serial killer. Maybe there are more I don’t even remember.”

As I panicked, pacing around and talking, he weakly whispered my name.

“–But I wasn’t doing it willingly, I didn’t know. The bodies… I don’t remember after killing them.

He said my name again.

“–Maybe they’re in my basement, maybe I buried them all there. God… I’ve been living for days on top of so many corpses.

“–Calm down, Cillian.”

There was not the slightest panic in his voice. He was watching me pace back and forth in the room.

“How can I be? How can I calm down? I’m a serial killer, Fred! Your friend is a killer! How are you so calm?”

Until then, I hadn’t noticed. He was sitting on the couch thoughtfully. No trace of panic on his face.

“You’re not a serial killer.”

“How can you be sure? There’s blood on me. I’m soaked. I killed that man.”

“You didn’t. You watched.”

I froze in place.

“What?”

“You watched them all, Cillian. I think… you’ve always been watching.”

“How… How do you know this? How do you know I didn’t kill them?”

“Because I did.”

I stumbled back two steps in shock. Before I could comprehend what he said, he spoke again.

“I should have realized earlier. But you… you were like invisible somehow. I always felt it. I always knew I wasn’t alone with them. But when you talked about the dreams, everything became clear. Tonight I saw you, Cillian. You were watching me from the corner. Like a ghost. Then you vanished. You didn’t do it. But you watched.”

Fred stood up. He came toward me.

“I don’t know how this is happening. You… you’re some kind of Grim Reaper.”

He grabbed the bag he had thrown into the hallway when he came in. I was frozen from shock as he walked past me.

“I haven’t figured out what this is yet, Cillian. You’re not normal, you know that now. And I’m sure you won’t go to the police until you understand.”

He looked into my eyes. It gave me the exact same feeling as when I thought I was being watched. As he left, I saw the bruise marks on his arm. They were shaped like finger marks, bruising his arm. That hand… the hand that rose into the air holding the knife…

He slammed the door and left.

I still haven’t gone to the police. I don’t know what’s happening, what’s going on here. I’m writing this so maybe someone can help me. With paranormal things, or whatever field this falls into. Fred will come back for me.

And I’m afraid the last thing I’ll watch will be my own murder.
