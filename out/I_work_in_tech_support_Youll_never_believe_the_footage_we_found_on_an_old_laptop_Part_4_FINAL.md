Five minutes ago I would have given anything to have Ginny’s hand in mine again, but now I hardly noticed it. Fear crept up the nape of my neck and choked off all higher brain function. Flight was all that was left. 

“Door. Now… RUN!” It was all I could muster as I yanked Ginny in the direction of the storefront. 

“Petrov! Slow down!” I heard her yell behind me, but I couldn’t. My legs bound like a deer for the exit. 

Her footfalls smacked loudly behind me, desperate to keep up. 

Just as we rounded the corner to the double doors I felt her palm rip away from my own. 

A scream cut through the store as I hit the brakes on my heels. 

I tried to spin around too fast. My body slipped out over my knees and I landed harshly on my shoulder. 

I looked up just in time to catch a glimpse of *it* carrying Ginny off in the other direction. 

“NO! STOP!” I screeched, scrambling back to my feet. 

I chased after them, but it was so fast. I’d never seen anything move like it before. She seemed to be weightless in its arms. 

As I rounded the shelves I got one glimpse of the terror on Ginny’s face as she was sucked into the vent with the creature. A silent scream plastered among a tapestry of freckles. 

“GINNY!” I cried. But it was too late. She was gone. 

I leapt through the vent after them. 

My mind was numb with static as I pounded my hands and knees through the aluminum portal to the backrooms. 

Only after I had felt like I’d been traveling entirely too long did I reach the pit fall. My stomach flipped in my abdomen as I fell to the ground. 

“*OOOF.”* The air was knocked from my lungs as I clashed against a stone floor. 

I gasped for breath as I rolled to my side. This wasn’t the carpet room… 

*What the hell?*

I was on a platform that was made from a stone slab. It floated amongst other slabs inside of a large bog. 

The water was a greenish hue and clumps of moss floated by lazily in a gentle current. 

I looked up to ensure the vent was above me. The metal opening hung in the sky and disappeared into a fog just above it. *How was this possible?*

A slamming sound pulled me from my wonderment. 

A golden door lay six slabs away. Its frame somehow suspended in the fog. 

“GINNY!” I shouted as I quickly leapt from one slab to the other, but careful enough not to slip into the murky waters below. 

I grabbed hold of the golden nob and threw the door open outward. Water rushed around my feet in a stream. The room was a huge bathroom. One you’d see in an airport, but about a hundred times larger. 

I hopped through the threshold but didn’t bother closing the door. 

“What the fuck is with the water…” I grumbled. It was almost up to my calf. 

Row after row of stalls lined the walls. The partition hung open where I could see the toilets were overflowing. 

The very last stall on the left wasn’t a stall at all. A green door… 

I thrashed through the water. This door had an inward swing, causing the water to throw it open, smacking it against the adjacent wall. 

I spilled through into the next room and struggled to close it. It took all my strength to push it back into the frame until the latch clicked. 

“Petrov?!” 

I spun around. 

“Ginny?” My mouth fell open. There were two of them… identical. 

“Oh my God Petrov!” One of them ran to me and wrapped her arms around me. Instinctively I almost pulled her in closer, but pushed her away instead. 

“What the fuck is going on?” I motioned my hand back and forth between them. 

“She’s not me, I’m the real Ginny!” The one that had embraced me pleaded with eyes full of tears. 

“Petrov, listen… she is not the real Ginny. I woke up in this… church, after that thing brought me through the vent.” The other Ginny put up her hands to show innocence.

“She’s a liar! It’s me! I woke up here!” The other cried. 

“Okay both of you shut the fuck up for a second… I need to think.” 

I took a moment to look around for the first time since I’d entered the room. It was a large cathedral, with rows of pews and stained glass windows. A shudder traveled down my spine at the reminiscence of catholic school. 

I looked back at the two of them. They both seemed genuinely grim with fear. 

“Listen, Petrov…” The one that had hugged me before now reached out for my hand. She laced her fingers in mine and gazed up at me with pleading eyes. 

*This one is very touchy*, I thought. Ginny had never been that way. Not towards me… not until… the carpet room. 

I pulled my hand away. 

“Petrov?...” Her lips trembled. 

I looked to the other Ginny and held out my hand. She took it after a brief hesitation. This had to be her. 

“Let's go.” I whispered to my Ginny. A tear cascaded down her cheek as she nodded her head in agreement.

“Petrov don’t! I AM THE REAL GINNY!” The other begged. 

“You don’t fucking follow us, do you hear me? If you do, I will kill you. I swear I will.” And I meant it. 

“*Petrov…”* She mouthed, reaching out for me again. I knocked her hand away. 

“Don’t. Follow. Us.” 

I yanked Ginny towards the door and flung it open. Water rushed in as before. We had to press our bodies against the frame to fight our way into the overgrown restroom. The water was so much higher now, up to our waists. 

There was no closing the door. We waded through the depths as fast as we possibly could. I glanced over my shoulder every few seconds to make sure the other Ginny wasn’t following. The tension in my shoulders slowly released after I saw that she wasn’t, time and time again. 

Once we got to the golden frame I saw that the gentle current of the bog was now like a roaring river. One misstep and we’d be swept away. 

“Petrov, I’m scared…” Ginny’s fingers tightened around my own. 

“Me too… but it’ll be okay. Just jump when I jump. Okay?” I reassured her. She shook her head in agreement. 

We timed out the jumps perfectly from slab to slab, careful not to plunge into the certain death of the stream. 

“Okay, you go up first. I’ll give you a boost.” 

She nodded again as I grabbed her waist to help her hop up into the vent. I pushed onto the soles of her shoes to help her clear into the horizontal portion of the tunnel. 

I looked back once more. The other one hadn’t followed… 

I let out a sigh of relief and pulled myself through the opening. 

After a few minutes we were back in the store. 

Ginny helped me pull the nearest shelf over to the vent to barricade the portal. 

Once we were safe she broke down in tears and heaving sobs. I wrapped my arms around her and she didn’t pull away. She melted against me, weeping into my chest. 

“It’s okay, it’s okay.” I ran my hand over her wet hair. Exhaustion seeped through every bone in my body. 

“Petrov…” She whispered. 

“Yes?”

“Thank you.” 

She pulled back, her eyes were bloodshot from the tears but she leaned up and kissed my cheek. 

“Can I stay with you tonight?” 

“Umm… yeah. Yeah of course.” I stammered.

“I just don’t want to be alone after… everything.” 

“Sure, sure. That would be… great.”

We started to walk out of the store before Ginny stopped at the help desk. She grabbed a pen and started furiously scribbling out a note. 

When she was done she held it up to me.  
*Kieran,*   
*It’s been real. But Petrov and I quit. Sorry.*

* *Ginny*

I held out a thumbs up and chuckled weakly. 

We made our way out to the parking lot. Ginny pulled herself close to me. I just figured she was shook up from everything. I was too. 

Once we were to the car she paused and turned to me. 

Her eyes searched mine and I felt my heart skip a beat. 

She kissed me. She kissed me long and hard. 

“Let’s go home.” She smiled. 

I opened the door to my Volkswagen and helped her into the seat. 

On the way around to the driver’s side, I had just the faintest sensation of doubt…

But I pushed it down deep inside. 

She seemed like the real Ginny to me. And that’s all that mattered. 

Maybe we could finally be [together](https://www.reddit.com/r/TerrorTherapy/) after all…
