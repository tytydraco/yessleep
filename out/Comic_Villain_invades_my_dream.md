Something interesting happened to me recently last week. I actually have a problem trying to tell this story chronologically so i'll jump right in.

The morning after, I woke up from a dream. In the dream, had dreamt about a manga or isit an anime? I cannot recall. tho i recall i had just read/watched the manga/anime the day before. I really cannot even recall was it an anime or manga to begin with. For brevity's sake i'll just refer it as a comic. I can't even recall the comic name, which is very weird. usually if i read a comic i would be able to remember the name of the comic for at least a while and this is just "the day before". how could i forget the name of the comic that i just read yesterday?

i might as well get into the dream. the dream actually pertains the comic and it's very plot.

the protag, he is investigating something. everyone who seems to barely know what he is investigating. even the protag himself has problems atrying to even make sense of what he is investigating.

it is revealed that the protag had actually sealed a great evil. this evil. the villain. the villain is insanely powerful. it is weird. being so powerful, how did the protag seal it away to begin with? i do not know. what i do know is that it gains power from people acknowledging it's existence. in fact the very act of remembering the villain exists gives it power.

the protag and perhaps his companions have somehow made everyone forget about the villain. it is not shown how, but everyone does not know or remember the villain from ever existing. even the protag himself. ironically his investigations are leading to him rediscovering the villain. it is later shown that the villain has been manipulating the real world. giving breadcrumbs to allow itself to be rediscovered by the world. 

I honestly thought it is a very unique story and well thought up plot. a nice concept. to the point that i would even dream of the cartoon. 

i was a little frustrated tho, as i could not remember the name of the cartoon. i cannot remember the protags name, nor the villains name. 

what makes it more interesting is that upon recollecting my thoughts. i was actually quite tied up at work the day before. usually on slow days i would be busy checking out reddit or something. but it was not a slow day. i remember being preoccupied at work with a constant flow of work. i had little anytime to spend reading a comic, and when i got home i was busy gaming.

it actually took me awhile to realize my dream just gave me a mindfuck. it retroactively made me misremember the events of the day before.

I DID NOT read any manga the day before, nor had i watched any anime. but the dream led me to believe i did.

is the villain actually a real eldritch being? does it really get stronger by more people knowing it's existence? does it get stronger by just remembering it exists? is the protag real? did he cast a spell that caused all of us to forget the villain? could this dream have been implanted in my head by the villain?

is it creating the seed for its existence?

its a little too far fetched for me. if it is real.... sharing this info would likely cause the seal to break. but i guess, it not real. if it is. well. forget you ever read this.
