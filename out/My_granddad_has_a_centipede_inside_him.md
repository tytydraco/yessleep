I was twelve years old when my granddad showed me the centipede inside of him. 

Even before that I clearly remember that granddad would have this habit of sometimes stopping what he was doing and cupping his hands together and peering into them like he was reading something very small and giggling to himself. He would do this while watching television or sitting on the porch or even while we were talking and I would ask him what he was looking at and he would just smile and say nothing nothing and put his hands down. 

Then one day we were hiking in the Sonoran Desert just outside Gila Bend and he told me to come over and that he wanted to show me something and he closed his palms together as if in prayer and opened them slowly like a book and inside the black shadowy gap between his hands I saw it. It was wriggling like a cat bedding a soft cushion, pale and white and fleshy, like a play-dough imitation of a centipede, its long thin antennas shaking around like drumsticks. I asked what it was. He said it was "his baby girl", that it lived inside him, eating away at his guts, and that it would be mine someday. I asked if it hurt. He laughed and closed his hands.

I stayed at granddad's place for about four months while my parents were working things out. The house was small and wooden, and everything smelled like old carpet. Granddad moved around the house like he was walking underwater and he talked to himself sometimes in the kitchen while he made coffee in the mornings. At dinner he would eat his food very slowly and sometimes he would stop chewing and just sit there with food in his mouth for minutes at a time and then start chewing again. His jaw made clicking sounds and he would tap his stomach with two fingers while he ate like he was trying to calm something inside him. One time I came home from school and heard these wet choking sounds coming from the bathroom and when I looked inside granddad was standing in front of the mirror making faces at himself. His mouth was open wide and he was sticking his tongue out as far as it would go and then he would close his mouth and his head would snap from side to side really fast like someone was moving it with their hands but his shoulders never moved at all. Then he would open his mouth again and lean forward and spit up this white stuff that looked like milk but thicker and it would splatter on the floor and on his bare feet. He kept saying sorry sorry sorry to his reflection.

I started having trouble sleeping because granddad would make noises at night. Not regular snoring but these long groaning sounds that would go on and then stop and then start again. Sometimes he would talk in his sleep but the words didn't sound like English or Spanish or anything I recognized. One night the sounds got really loud and I got up to check on him and I pushed his door open just a crack. He was lying on his back on top of the covers and his mouth was hanging open. Something was coming out from between his lips. It moved very slowly like it was being careful not to wake him up. It kept coming and coming and I realized it was the centipede but much bigger now maybe as thick as a garden hose and longer than my arm. It rose up toward the ceiling and then bent down toward the open window and the moonlight made its skin look wet. The way it moved reminded me of a sunflower, basking in the moonlight. I watched for maybe two minutes and then the centipede started to go back down and it disappeared into granddad's mouth and he closed his lips and rolled over on his side. The next morning at breakfast he asked if I had slept well and I said yes and he nodded and poured syrup on his pancakes in perfect spirals.

Granddad died last month. I drove down to Arizona to help my mom and my uncles clean out his house. They spent most of their time in the kitchen going through paperwork and talking about what to do with his things and how much everything was worth. I went through his bedroom by myself and found a shoebox under his bed full of photographs. Most were of my grandmother who died when I was little but there were maybe twenty pictures of the moon and the stars, blurry and grainy. On the back of each card he had written dates going back fifteen years and notes like "she's growing" and "molt today" and "hungry again" and "it feels delicious". The funeral was small. My mom cried and my uncles gave speeches about what a good man granddad was and how much he loved his family. During the service I kept thinking about him lying in the casket and wondering if the centipede was still in there with him or if it had died too or if it had found somewhere else to go.

Since then I've been having dreams about granddad's house. In the dreams I'm walking through the rooms and everything looks the same but I can hear this scratching sound in the walls and the moon is shining brighter than the sun ever could, burning white light coming from all windows like spotlights. I always wake up with my hands pressed together and when I open them slowly like granddad showed me I swear I can see two thin antennas barely visible flicking back and forth.
