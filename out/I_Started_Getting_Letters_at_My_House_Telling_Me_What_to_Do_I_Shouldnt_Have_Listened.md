I found the first letter stuck under my doormat when I got home. Not slipped in the mail slot or dropped on the porch like when I normally get mail, but jammed under the mat like it was waiting for me. The envelope was sealed, and had my name on the front, so at first I assumed it was a bill I had forgotten about. 

But it wasn't.

Inside the envelope was a single piece of paper, with edges a little torn like someone didn’t care. Handwriting all jagged, like a kid learning cursive but desperate to be serious.

“Don’t ignore the signs at work.” 

That’s all it said. No signature. No return address.

I thought about it for longer than I should have, sitting in the living room in the dark starting at the paper. Was it someone from work messing with me? Possible, but I couldn't imagine who. Eventually I convinced myself to stop thinking about it, and move on. After all, it could be anything. 

The next day at the office was the same old same old. The building always smelled like burnt coffee and old carpet, stale air that stuck in your throat. You could almost feel the gray walls closing in a little tighter.

I’m a credit controller. Which means most of my job is just chasing clients for money they're already two weeks late on, acting polite while internally praying they go bankrupt so I can be free.

Most of the day was uneventful. My boss wore a horrible tie with dinosaurs on it, and asked me if I liked it. The new intern got caught filling the printer the wrong way. Around 11 a.m. I saw Jenna standing by the filing cabinet, half-leaning against it with her phone in one hand, scrolling. She was smiling at something. Then she laughed quietly to herself, or maybe it was more like a giggle. She looked up, saw me looking, and we just held that weird eye contact for a second too long.

I looked away first.

Instantly, that crawling feeling crept up my spine again. She’d laughed right after looking at me. Was that about me? Was she behind the letter? Was I being messed with?

Before I could spiral, she was suddenly next to my desk, catching me off guard.

“Hey,” she said, a little breathless. “Do you have a sec? I’m losing my mind over these Acorn Media invoices. No one's been answering over there. I’ve called them, like, four times this week.”

She held out a little stack of paper. I tried to focus, but my brain was still running in loops. I nodded and took the pages.

“Yeah,” I said. “They’ve been dodging. I might escalate it.”

She sighed. “Honestly? Sometimes I feel like just writing a handwritten note and mailing it to them. Like, Dear Sir, pay the damn bill.”

She smiled as she said it. Like it was a joke. But my stomach dropped.

This is the exact kind of thing someone would say if they were testing how I’d react. Or covering their tracks.

I laughed, but it didn’t sound like me. “Yeah. Old school.”

Inside, I felt something shift.

I got home around six. Keys dropped in the bowl, jacket thrown over the back of the chair like always. I stood in the kitchen eating peanut butter off a spoon, scrolling on my phone, trying not to think about work.

But I kept replaying what Jenna said. The handwritten note thing. It sat wrong in my head, like something caught between my teeth. Not just what she said but the way she had said it. That look she gave me after.

I finally went to take the trash out, and that’s when I saw it.

Another envelope.

Same as before. No stamp. No markings. Just my name in that same twitchy handwriting. This time it wasn’t under the mat, but stuck halfway inside the crack of the screen door. Like whoever left it had no time to hide it properly.

I didn’t open it right away. Just stared at it while the trash bag swung in my other hand, cold sweat starting to collect at my neck. Eventually, I took it inside and opened it over the sink.

One sheet of paper again.

This one said:

"You handled the Jenna thing well. Don’t second-guess it. Stay confident."

I dropped it instantly like it burned.

There was no way that was coincidence. Not anymore.

I checked all the windows. The locks. Even the weird spot in the hallway ceiling where the plaster’s chipped that I always told myself I’d fix but never did. My phone was in my pocket the whole time at work. No one could’ve seen that conversation unless—

I didn’t even finish the thought.

I stood there in my kitchen, holding the note in two fingers like it might bite me, and I thought: Either this is some next-level prank, or someone is watching me a lot closer than I thought.

The next morning crawled.

I was jittery, for no good reason. Kept looking up from my screen, stealing glances at Jenna like I was waiting for her to… what? Confront me? Smile? Say something weird?

She didn’t notice. Not at first.

She was too busy arguing with someone over the phone. Voice raised, eyebrows pulled together, fingers drumming hard against her desk.

“I’m not chasing this again, David,” she snapped. “I already sent the invoice twice, and your assistant keeps telling me she’s on holiday. It’s been six weeks.”

“No, it doesn't matter what your supervisor says. These payments were already cleared by your head of finance, speaking of is he in?.” 

That's when she glanced over at me. A pause. She rolled her eyes so hard I thought they might fall out.

I quickly got up, grabbed my mug like I just remembered I was parched, and awkwardly shuffled toward the coffee room.

The second I stepped in, it hit me how small it really was. Half-lit by a jittery fluorescent tube. That stale instant-coffee smell cooked into the walls. I stood near the sink, trying to look busy while my pulse thudded behind my eyes.

Not thirty seconds later, the door creaked open.

Jenna walked in holding her phone loosely like it might bite her. She dropped it face down on the counter.

“You ever just… want to launch yourself out a window?” she muttered.

I gave a half-laugh, too quick, like I didn’t know if it was okay.

She started fixing her coffee. Powder, water, stir. I couldn’t stop myself.

“Honestly?” I said, “Yeah. But if I did, probably not from this office as it's only 5 stories. I’d probably just bounce off the second-floor awning and end up with a broken leg. The guys next door at Jpact have a ten story building, so probably that would give me a better chance.

She looked at me.

Not laughing. Not smiling.

“Jesus,” she said, a little too flat. “That’s dark.”

I tried to recover. “I meant like, you know—corporate hell. It’s a joke.”

“Right.”

Silence.

The spoon clinked once, twice, then she put it down gently and picked up her cup.

“Well. See you out there,” she said, already halfway out the door.

I stood alone in the hum of the fridge, feeling like I’d tripped on my own tongue and fell face-first into whatever tension had just filled the room.

I found the third one in the jacket I wore yesterday.

Not in the pocket. Not on the floor.
Folded neatly into the inside lining, where the stitching had come loose a week ago and I hadn’t bothered to fix it.

I only noticed it because I went to grab gum. My fingers brushed paper where paper shouldn't be.

It was an envelope.
Sealed.
Same kind as before, cheap, off-white, the glue barely holding.
And on the front, in that same crooked cursive, was my name.

No one else lives here.
I didn’t leave the jacket out in public.
And I sure as hell didn’t put anything in it.

I stood there by the door for a full minute, jacket half-on, envelope in hand, heart kicking like a warning.

Eventually I opened it.

Same kind of paper. Same jagged writing.

“Don’t joke about death. You’re not ready for that yet.
Say something lighter. Try:
‘At this point I think the invoices are chasing me.
I had a dream one of them cornered me in the stairwell.’
She’ll laugh. Nod. Let her talk after that.”

No signature. No smudge. Just that same sense of something leaning in too close.

I read it twice. Then a third time.

And the worst part?

It was good.
The joke. The rhythm. It sounded like me. but sharper. Like someone who had already seen the conversation play out and just decided to hand me the cheat codes.

I didn’t plan to speak to her again. I figured I’d burned that bridge in the coffee room.

But the day after, near the end of lunch, I heard her voice again. Loud, muffled by the headset, then sharp—“No, I told you that one was paid in June. If your system says otherwise, then your system’s a piece of sh—”

She slammed the headset down on her desk, rubbed her forehead, and sighed so hard I felt it from two cubicles away.

I glanced up. Mistake.

She caught me looking.

Our eyes met and this time there was no knowing smirk. Just something tense and unreadable. She blinked slowly, like she was chewing through some internal comment, and looked away.

I froze, then forced myself to stand.

I walked toward the break room with the gait of someone pretending to be normal. Once inside, I busied myself rinsing a mug that was already clean. My hands shook. My skin felt too loud.

Behind me, the door creaked. 

She entered quietly, phone dangling from her fingers again, unreadable. I turned to say something, anything, her expression was brittle, still tight from the call.

 “Rough day?” I tried.

“No,” she said. Then immediately: “Yes. I don’t know. I think I’ve lost the ability to talk to adults without sounding like I want to bite them.”

She gave a small laugh. I didn’t.

The silence stretched. I could feel it turning sour again. My mind spun. I felt cornered.
Like I’d been caught trespassing in my own body.

Then I remembered the line.

“I had this dream last night,” I blurted out, too loud. “That one of the unpaid invoices chased me down the stairwell and pinned me against the wall. 

She blinked. Then snorted.

Then laughed.

 “what like a giant piece of paper chased you down and pinned you against a wall? What happened then?”



“It... Uh... Told me it was going to make me pay for once."


Now she was full-on giggling. She leaned back against the counter, shook her head.

 “You’re weird,” she said. “But, like… not in a murder-y way. I think that’s a compliment.”

She paused, looked at me sideways.

“You wanna get a drink tomorrow? After the invoice monsters clock out?”

My heart skipped a little. I wasn't expecting this. I nodded, maybe a little too fast.

 “Yeah sure that could be fun, I’d like that.”

“Cool,” she said, already turning. “I’ll text you.”

 I stayed there, holding the mug like a weapon, heartbeat pulsing in my ears. If it was her sending the letters, why would she tell me what kind of jokes to make? Was this all an elaborate plan for her to get me to go out with her? She could have just asked without all this.

That night, the apartment was locked. Same as always. Nothing looked disturbed. But when I stepped into the living room, there it was.

On my coffee table.

The envelope.

This one was different. Expensive, textured card. Like it came from a wedding invitation set.

I picked it up, and my stomach did that thing again. like the air had turned to static and all the oxygen got vacuumed out of the room.

The handwriting was worse this time. Harsher. Jagged.

Like it had been written in the dark, with a shaking hand. And instead of black ink like before, it was red. 

Inside, it said:

"Cancel the drink. Tell her your cat is sick. Say it like it’s sad, but don’t overdo it. "

I don’t have a cat. 

The next day, things felt weird from the second I sat down.

I couldn’t focus. Couldn’t even pretend to. My fingers hovered above the keyboard for an hour, typing nothing. I reread the letter three times before leaving the apartment that morning. Each time, the words seemed more aggressive.

Around 2PM, Jenna appeared at my desk.

She was holding her phone and smiling, and not that weird strained smile from before. A real one.

“So what time you wanna head out tonight? Six-thirty too early?”

My stomach locked up. I looked at her like a deer trying to solve math.

“Ah… I might have to, um…” I forced a cough. “My cat’s sick. This morning she wouldn’t eat and she was just lying there, so I think I need to, like… take her to the vet.”

The moment I said it, something in her face changed.

Like someone had pulled a string behind her eyes.
 “Your cat is sick?” she said.

Not surprised. Not sympathetic. Startled.

I nodded, too committed now.

“Yeah. She's usually okay but this morning was… different. Just being careful.”

Jenna didn’t respond right away. Her gaze had drifted past me, like she was trying to remember something and couldn’t place it.

Then she smiled again—but this one was off. Half-hearted. Like she’d just lost track of why she came over.

“Oh. Okay. Yeah, no, totally. We’ll just… do another time then.”

She turned and walked away without another word.

No sarcastic jab. No joke about invoice monsters. Nothing.

And as she moved back toward her desk, I saw her glance over her shoulder.

Not at me. At the hallway behind me.

Like someone else might’ve been standing there.

I got home fast.

Didn’t stop for groceries. Didn’t check the mail. Barely remembered to lock the door. Just dumped my bag and started scanning the apartment like it might breathe at me.

No letter.

I checked the kitchen table.

Nothing.

Under the door?

Clear.

My bed. Under the pillow. The sink. The freezer. The window ledge. The fucking microwave.

Nothing.

And then—
my phone buzzed.

JENNA CALLING.

I stared at the screen. I almost didn’t pick up.

Then I did.

“Hello?”

Her voice came fast, trembling, and angry.

 “What the fuck is this?”

I swallowed.

“What?”

“What the fuck is wrong with you?”

“Jenna—wait, I don’t—”

 “Are you some kind of sick freak?” she snapped. “Do you think this is funny?”

 “I don’t know what you’re talking about—”

 “Are you sending letters to my fucking house?.”

The room went dead quiet around me.

“What?”

 “Yesterday,” she said, her voice suddenly smaller. Tighter. “Before today. Before you said anything. I got a letter. At my place.”

I didn’t say anything. I couldn’t.

 “It was just one sentence,” she said.


 “It said: You don’t have a cat.”


 “I don’t,” I said quietly.

Silence.

Then, more quietly she replied.

 “I know you don’t. That’s why it scared the shit out of me.”

I sat down on the floor. My heart was going somewhere else without me.

“That’s not it,” she said. “There was another letter. Waiting for me when I got home.”

 “Did you open it?”

 “No. Not yet.”

I closed my eyes.

 “Open it,” I said. “Tell me what it says.”

I heard her rustling paper on the other end.

Then nothing.

Then just—

 “It says... Oh my god. It says hang up the phone.”

Before I could even register what she had just said, the line dropped. 

That was three days ago.
I’ve been calling in sick to work ever since.

I haven’t left the house.
And I haven’t checked the mail.
