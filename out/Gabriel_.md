The cold light of the interrogation room burned my eyes, and the silence was only broken by the sound of the detectives' pens scribbling on paper. I was handcuffed to the steel table, and every second of waiting felt like an eternity. I felt lost, confused, as if I was being accused of something impossible. Me, a murderer? I couldn’t understand.

The older detective looked at me cautiously, as if dealing with a cornered animal.

“So, Gabriel, do you want to tell us what happened?” he asked calmly.

I sighed, my throat dry, and prepared to speak. All of this still felt like a nightmare. Maybe, if I told the story from the beginning, they could understand what really happened.

“It started months ago,” I began, my voice weak. “My father was very sick, terminally ill. I had spent everything I had on treatments, but nothing worked. It was on one of those nights, when I was completely desperate, that I decided to go out for a drink. I needed to drown my frustration in something.”

The younger detective was taking notes, but it was the older one who seemed to really be paying attention. His eyes never left mine.

“Go on,” he said.

I remembered the scene as if it were yesterday. I was in the nearest bar to my house, drinking alone at a corner table. The background music and the conversations of the other patrons seemed like distant noise, muffled by the sadness I carried. With each sip I took, the feeling of helplessness grew. My father was dying, and there was nothing I could do.

“Then he appeared,” I continued. “A man I had never seen before. He approached my table and started talking to me, as if we were old friends. I didn’t have the energy to push him away. I was too drunk, too tired.”

The detective leaned back in his chair.

“What did he say?”

I closed my eyes for a moment, trying to remember exactly. The man, in a dark suit with cold eyes, had a strange presence, but at the time, I was too inebriated to notice the danger.

“At first, he just asked normal questions, like he was curious about what I was doing there alone. The conversation flowed, and without realizing it, I started to vent. I talked about my father, about his illness, about how I felt useless. I think the alcohol made me say more than I should. And then... he asked me something.”

“What?” asked the older detective.

“He asked, ‘What if there was a way for your father to be cured?’”

I paused, feeling a lump in my throat at the memory. At the time, I didn’t even think. I was in such a deep state of despair that anything seemed better than the reality I was living in.

“I told him I would pay anything if that were possible,” I whispered.

The younger detective finally stopped writing and looked directly at me.

“And what did he do?”

I swallowed hard, the moment crystallizing in my mind like a vivid nightmare.

“He reached out to me and said, ‘Deal.’ I laughed. I thought it was some joke, something ridiculous that the alcohol was making me take seriously. But without thinking, I shook his hand.”

When I did, I felt a coldness run up my arm, but at the time, I thought it was just the effect of the drink. That handshake marked the beginning of everything.

“And then?” the older detective insisted.

“I went home, without thinking much about what had happened. And the next day, something changed. My father... my father was better. Much better. It was as if the illness had vanished, as if he had never been on the brink of death. The doctors couldn’t explain it, but I knew something was wrong.”

I sighed, fighting against the tears that welled up. I thought I had done the right thing. That, somehow, that stranger at the bar had kept his promise. But I didn’t know the price I was paying.

“But then... the nightmares started,” I continued. “I dreamed of deaths, of blood, of violence. It was always me, killing someone, but I never clearly saw the faces of the victims. At first, I thought they were just bad dreams, consequences of the stress. But things got worse.”

I began to lose track of time. There were nights when I woke up in places I didn’t recognize, with mud and stains that I couldn’t explain. I started to fear myself, not knowing what was happening.

And then the bodies began to appear. Violent deaths, always near crossroads. The police started calling the killer ‘The Crossroads Maniac’ because of the locations of the murders and the brutality of the crimes.

The older detective leaned forward.

“Gabriel, did you know we’ve been investigating this killer for months?”

I shook my head, confused. I couldn’t believe I was being accused.

“You’re making a mistake. I’m not that killer!”

The younger detective pushed a tablet towards me, with a video ready to play.

“Look at this, Gabriel. We recorded your last night at the crossroads. It might help you remember.”

I hesitated but pressed play. The screen showed a dark road, illuminated only by the headlights of a parked car. The scene seemed normal until I saw myself on the screen.

I was there, with a knife in my hand, walking calmly towards a woman who was screaming desperately. I closed my eyes and turned away, unable to watch any more. The sound of her screams still echoed in my ears as I attacked her. In the video, my face was a mask of indifference.

My stomach churned.

“This... this can’t be real,” I whispered, feeling the world collapse around me.

The older detective stared at me harshly.

“It’s you, Gabriel. We don’t care if you made a deal with the devil or something else, what matters here is that you are the Crossroads Maniac. And we got you, you bastard.”

I wanted to deny it. I wanted to scream that it couldn’t be true. But at the same time, something inside me knew it was. I remembered the nights without memory, the nightmares. The pact had taken my soul, turning me into something I didn’t recognize.

The detective stood up, slowly walking around the table, speaking in a cold and implacable voice.

“You’re going to rot in jail for what you’ve done, you bastard. There’s no escape for monsters like you.”

His words reached my ears like a distant echo. I knew he was talking to me, but I could no longer pay attention. My mind was elsewhere. My gaze was drawn to something behind the detective. Something only I could see.

There, leaning against the wall of the interrogation room, was him. The man from the bar. The same man who had reached out to me and sealed my fate that fateful night.

He looked at me intently, with a demonic smile on his face, as if he were enjoying my suffering. His eyes gleamed with malice, and although his figure was as real as anyone else in the room, I knew that no one else could see him. He was there to remind me of what I had done. To remind me that the pact would never be broken.

The detective kept talking, but his words dissolved into the air. I couldn’t take my eyes off that cruel smile, knowing that I was just a pawn in his game. I shook his hand once, and now... now my soul belonged to him.
