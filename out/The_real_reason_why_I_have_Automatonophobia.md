  Sorry, it left me another message this morning. I'm afraid for my life now, but it will be ok. I'll get my story out here and y'all will help me. Maybe, I don't know if you would be willing to after you hear my experience, I especially wouldn't if I was on the other end.


     It began a couple of weeks ago. Me and a couple of my college buddies went out drinking. We were coming back to the college dorm rooms when we decided drunkingly to go get groceries(all four of us were roommates). 


     This is the real reason why I have Automatonophobia(the fear of human - like figures). My family laughs at me whwn they scare me with dolls but they don't know the pain I went through.


     Anyway, these events happened in two weeks. 


    As we got out of the food mart with our groceries I looked at the clothing store beside it(The store stands a couple a feet from the mart). And there was a discarded mannequin at the side of the store along with parts from others.


  The eerie moonlight glancing off from it must've spooked us cause the next second we were throwing some of our food and drinks at it.


   It didn't help that we were also laughing at it and pulling it's limbs off. After we got done basically giving it torture we got back in the car and drove away.


  As we were leaving, and I swear to you, I saw the limbs of the mannequin move! Then it started pulling it back together in a neatly fashion. I was stunned by this with a mix of a confused and horrified look when it put it's right arm back on. Then it glanced sharply at the people in the car who now is about to turn to a different street.


   When we got back to the dorm room I told the guy's but they laughed it off. Saying it was probably the booze making me see it. My heart still pounding in my chest went still after I took a shower and went to bed. 


    The next night I woke up in the middle of the day. I groaned as I pulled myself out of bed. After the rest of the day's classes we went out for some Danny's Coffee and laughed about what I told them the last night. 


     "Oh man, that was priceless!" John said as he sat there with his black coffee. 


     "Like did it look like anything fromthem type of horror games Luke likes to play?" Asks Sam. 


     Luke during this was just laughing as usual since he doesn't normally join in conversations unless he is interested. As we were talking I glanced a look at Sally, the barista serving our table, as she smiled and then nodded her head back at me. 


     John then abruptly gets up from his chair as if he was in shock outside the huge glass window. He then shout's  "Hey", and ran out of the coffe place as we run out with him.


   His red Buick was all scratched up and covered front to back with food all over it. As he kneels down and starts to cry and the other people in Danny's start checking out the commotion. I take a look at the other side of the place as I take a glance on what I surely believe was the right side of a mannequin.


  I was so shocked that I fell to my knees. My face dripping with sweat, my body shaking from fear. I knew it was there, the mannequin from just the other night.


  Was it here to do more that scratch up a car? I thought, No it couldn't be, it was here to do more. I know I couldn't tell the others it was the mannequin. They would say I'm becoming crazy. I went back to comfort my friend when the police arrived. He really loved that car. 


 As I laid in mt bed in the dorm room tgat night I thought some more. Was it really the mannequin? Or was it just some dude that actually did it and I'm still paranoid from last night?


   I considered the seconed option as I went back to sleep.


    On Sunday morning we all got up and went about our daily lives like nothing happened. Sure, John lost his car but nothing like a dealership and insurance cant fix. I told the guy's that I asked out Sally at the coffeplace.


    "What the hell!" John said. "Were you profiting off my misery" he yells jokingly. 


   Luke laughed at John and said," maybe losing your Buick was a good thing for him." 


   We all laughed and went about our day. At night I got ready for my date with Sally. I took her to the drive in movie theatre. I think it was an Adam Sandler flick. We kissed and had fun that night. As the movie came to a close I saw a blurry movement go by tbe corner of my left eye.


    After that I took her home and went back to the dorms. The next day Sally wasn't at work and the day after that too.c After them two days I pulled up the local news channel and in horror I saw that she was declared missing.
