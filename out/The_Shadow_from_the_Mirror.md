Alexandria, the ancient city on the Mediterranean coast, bears the marks of countless epochs and civilizations. Its history is filled with rises and falls, and every time it seemed as though it would vanish from the face of the earth, it rose again like a Phoenix. Over the centuries, the city has been destroyed by earthquakes, fires, and wars, but each time, a new Alexandria would emerge from the ruins. Even today, while constructing modern buildings, ancient sarcophagi and skeletons of past inhabitants are still being discovered, giving the impression that the city is literally built on bones.

Many of Alexandria’s residents claim that strange occurrences happen in their homes. Shadows flicker in the corners of rooms, candles crackle and smoke for no apparent reason, and animals behave oddly. It feels as though something otherworldly resides in these houses.

We lived in a large, beautiful apartment by the Mediterranean Sea, and spirits, or jinns as they are called in Islam, often frightened us. You'd be sitting in the living room and suddenly catch a glimpse of a black cat running past. But we didn’t have any cats, so it must have been a trick of the eye. Yet the shadows continued to appear here and there.

When our children grew a little older, they began to tell us that they saw a boy in the corner of the room, or an aunt at the table, or some uncle in the hallway. Although I’m not a particularly fearful person, I was too scared to leave the bedroom at night. Between the bedroom and the kitchen, there were a few steps where a feeling of dread would grip me, and goosebumps would cover my skin, as if there was a portal to other dimensions in that spot.

One day, my older daughter, a teenager, came to me and said, "Mom, I don’t know if it’s a dream or reality, but for the third night in a row, a person in a hood has come to me and stood by my bed. I’m not scared, but I just don’t understand if it's a dream or not." I went online and with horror discovered that many people had seen similar beings. No one knew who they were. One person wrote, “The ones in black hoods are priests of Ahriman. They often visit children in dreams to give them a certain role in life.”

The more I read, the scarier it became. The next night, I decided to spend the night in my daughter’s room. Of course, I fell asleep immediately, and she told me that he had come and she asked him, "Who are you?" He introduced himself as the Shadow and said they were forbidden to show their faces.

The Shadow lived in another reality, where they guarded the transitions between worlds. He dreamed of breaking free and entering our world, but to do so, he had to fulfill certain conditions.

Here is his story:

"In the gray, featureless void, where there was neither sun, nor stars, nor any sign of life, there existed a kingdom of shadows. Here, there were no humans, only their ephemeral reflections—soulless copies, devoid of emotions.

One such being was the Shadow. He was lonely and unhappy, yearning for a world full of color, sound, and feeling—things he had only heard of in ancient tales.

The Shadow would sit for hours at the borders of his world, mesmerized by the lives of people in another reality. He saw their laughter, their tears, their love, and their anger—all the emotions he lacked.

The dream of becoming part of this world settled deep in his heart. He longed to feel the warmth of the sun on his skin, the taste of good food, the joy of friendship and love.

But the path to the human world was thorny and dangerous. Ancient legends said that only one who could accomplish three impossible tasks would be able to cross the border between worlds.

1. **The Ritual of Enlightenment**: In the Shadow’s world, there was an ancient ritual known as "Enlightenment." To cross the gate between realities, the Shadow had to perform this ritual. On the highest peak of his world, he must light a fire and chant a mantra to open the portal.
2. **The Symbol of Union**: The Shadow must create a symbol that links him to our reality. It could be an amulet, a drawing, or even a melody. He had to charge it with his own energy and intent.

Since my daughter had certain abilities from childhood, he chose her for the third condition. She was curious and wasn’t frightened by his unusual appearance.

One day, the Shadow told my daughter about the final condition for crossing over—he had to earn someone’s genuine belief in his existence.

The girl, struck by his story, wholeheartedly believed in the Shadow. She saw him not just as a shadow, but as a being with a kind heart and an extraordinary fate.”

A connection formed between the Shadow and my daughter. She began drawing him and one day said that the time was near for her strange friend to transition into our reality. When he made the transition, he would leave her a sign.

As time passed, the Shadow appeared less often. One morning, as my daughter was getting ready for school, she opened her bag and found a small white rose—exactly the sign the Shadow had promised to leave her. Since then, my daughter began having prophetic dreams, and many even asked her to inquire about various situations in her dreams. This gift was left to her in gratitude by a being from another world.

Alexandria continues to live on, maintaining its mystical atmosphere and the remnants of past civilizations. This city, built on the bones of its ancient inhabitants, harbors many secrets and mysteries that continue to stir the imagination and attract seekers of the mystical and the unknown.
