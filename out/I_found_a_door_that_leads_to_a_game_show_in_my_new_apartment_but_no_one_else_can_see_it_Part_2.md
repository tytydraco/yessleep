I did it. I went back to the game show. At first I wanted to ignore it and resist my temptations, which I did for at least twenty-four hours, but my curiosity overwhelmed me. Please don’t judge me. For all I know this could be my “Narnia” moment where I get to embark into some fantastic fantasy world and become a hero. It certainly would be better than working my lobotomizing office job. I’m only twenty-five so I’d say I’m due for some adventure! It’s not like Tuscon has much adventure to offer. Unless you like cacti and old western towns.



I have more evidence. It’s a bottle of wine. Red, I think. The label says it’s a Merlot. I don’t drink wine very often, I’m partial to lighter beers or hard ciders, but the bottle looks nicer than something you’d get at any hole-in-the-wall liquor store. The label is nothing I’ve ever seen or can even find online. It’s called, “Laughing Mantis” and has notes of cherries, pine, and lilac. I suppose I’ll save it for when I bring a date over, but knowing my luck it’ll just be another ghosting fuck-boy. That’s what I get for using the hook up apps.



When I first ignored the game show’s call, it went on for hours. The host would call out every sixty seconds on the dot. I counted. I ordered a pizza and played loud music while I continued to unpack. There was a pounding on the front door a bit later. I paused my music and my stomach growled as I smelled fresh, hot cheese through the door. I opened it to see a delivery girl standing there with my dinner. It wasn’t until I had my pizza in hand and closed the door that I noticed the lights and music from the pantry seized. The rest of the night was normal. I gamed with some friends online, went to bed, and then woke up for work the next day. I thought I was in the clear when I went to bed again. I thought that it really was a stress-induced episode, when suddenly, I was awoken by the host’s call at exactly midnight.



“Aaron! Come on down! Your next request awaits you!” The host’s muffled voice shouted from just beyond the pantry door.



“Ugh…fuck. Seriously? Alright, fine. One more time won’t hurt.” I groaned and slothed out of bed.

I opened the pantry door, blinking hard at the harsh spotlights that immediately turned their gaze on me. I could only make out the silhouette of the host until I reached my clear podium once again. A cacophony of fanfare and an explosion of confetti rained down on me. I flinched and covered my face from the endless specs of multicolored plastic. “Jesus! I’m still half asleep. What was all that?” I griped.



“The audience and I are just so pleased to have you back on RISK! OR! REWARD!” The host let out a boisterous, high-pitched laugh before doing her usual audience calling card. There was still no audience behind me. This place seriously made no sense. “Now, Aaron, seeing as we’re taking up precious sleep hours from you I’ll make this quick! What is your choice?” The host grinned wider than before. It was almost inhuman how her lips stretched toward her ears.



“Reward. Let’s keep the party going.” I shrugged.



“Excellent choice! Reveal what Aaron’s request will be this evening!” The host commanded and the curtains were drawn once again to reveal a request displayed on the large screens. “Tell us about a time you committed a crime, but never got caught! Oh, how juicy is that request?!” The host read allowed and cheerfully looked at me as if with anticipation for my answer.



“What? Um, well…Huh? That’s right. I-” I stumbled over my thoughts as I recalled something from my childhood. “Well, it was an accident, but when I was fourteen I was at the park with a friend. His name was Jordan. He was pressuring me into smoking a cigarette with him, but as soon as I tasted it I tossed it away. That was his only cigarette that he’d stolen from his dad and I remember him being mad about it, but we just laughed it off in the end. But, this park had plenty of trees and dry brush around and it wasn’t until we saw the smoke rising up from the tree line that I realized what I’d done. As soon as we heard the sirens coming in the distance, we cut and ran back home as fast as we could. We promised to never talk about it to anyone. So…why am I telling you now? Huh.” The story flowed out of me like I’d told it a million times over, but I’d never told that story until now. I barely even remembered it.



“Oh I see! Things seem to have heated up for little Aaron so he ran and hid…like a scared caterpillar.” The host's voice shifted from bubbly to dark. I was uneased by her sudden drop in character, but it only lasted a moment. “But what comes next is nothing to fear! Your reward is here!” She called and the floor opened again revealing an ornate bottle of wine.



As soon as I picked it up the host did her closing farewell the same as before and everything went dark. I reached for the light string and pulled. The pantry with all its cans and boxes of food greeted me. “What even was all that? Did that actually happen back then?” I sighed and clutched the wine bottle in my hand. Real again, like I said. 



So, here we are. I’d say you’re all caught up, but there’s one more thing. I managed to find Jordan online and I asked him if I could call him to talk about our childhood. He agreed, though his messages came off as untrusting. We talked and he confirmed what I’d told the game show host. We really did set fire to a forest, but since it was when we were fourteen the statute of limitations says we’re in the clear. That was a huge relief to find out! Not that I was worried. No one knew anyway. Well, except the host and now all of you. 



You know what? Screw it. I’m eating that candy bar tonight and popping open that bottle of wine. They are my rewards and I earned them. I should enjoy them! I think I need to take at least several more showers though. I keep finding confetti and glitter on my body. I’ll update you all when I have more news, but I think I’m definitely going back to play again.
