Some years ago, I came across the case of Elisa Lam, who tragically lost her life under mysterious circumstances at the Cecil Hotel in 2013. The case caught my attention, and I remember watching a documentary about it, probably the one on Netflix. However, I didn't dwell on the topic for too long after that.

Last night, though, I got reintroduced to the phenomenon of the Cecil Hotel after watching a girl on TikTok talk about Downtown LA being demonic. I then came across videos by Peet Montzingo, who lived right across from the Cecil Hotel for quite a few years. If you’re interested in gaining insight into this topic, I highly recommend his YouTube videos. Before I knew it, I was going down the rabbit hole with much more intensity than before. The footage from inside the hotel gave an extremely eerie feeling, yet there was a strange, almost tempting urge to keep watching. Currently, it feels as if the hotel is calling me from across the globe, trying to lure me to it. It's almost as if it wants me to keep thinking about all of this.

In particular, I've been thinking about the Elevator Game. I don't like that it's called a game, as it clearly is a ritual. As you can probably already guess, I also went down the Elevator Game rabbit hole and had a thought on it, which I think could be worth sharing. Hear me out: The reason the Elevator Game might be a truly functioning ritual, possibly taking you into a parallel dimension or a kind of "Outer World," is because the movement provided by the elevator is incomparable to any other movement the human body is exposed to. The height of each floor may vary around the world, but the movement of the elevator when following the given sequence of button presses remains the same. This means your body will be lifted in the same manner and rhythm, regardless of the actual height of the building or the different sizes, speeds, and layouts of elevators. The movement itself remains unchanged.

If you're now questioning what could be so special about going up and down in an elevator in a specific sequence or how that could take you into a different type of reality, think about it as a moving sequence that unlocks something, just like certain movements and practices can relieve pain or restore abilities in our bodies. This sequence, while seemingly mundane, could hold the key to unlocking another realm or dimension.

Maybe I've just become obsessed with the topic over the last few days, but I do believe in spirits and energies that cannot be seen in our “normal” state of consciousness. However, we can open our channels through different techniques and tools, such as Shrooms, DMT, and any other consciousness-altering substances and/or RITUALS. These methods have been known to provide insights and experiences beyond our usual perception of reality.

I wouldn’t ever dare to try the Elevator Game myself. All I know is that I have an urge to go to Downtown LA and feel the energies of the city that was once built on sacred land. There's something inexplicably magnetic about the place that keeps drawing me in, urging me to explore its mysterious and possibly supernatural aspects.
