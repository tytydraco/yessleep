This just happened and I’m still pretty shaken up by it all, but this evening whilst putting away some clothes in my closet, I noticed the entry point to my attic had been disturbed and set ajar. 

I live in a Condo with my Wife and Child. Our Master Bedroom has a walk in closet with an access point/ lid or whatever to our attic. I don’t believe the attic connects with any other Condo but we do share walls with neighbors on both sides. 

As I was folding and putting away laundry this evening my Wife walked in from the connecting bathroom (Our Master bedrooms bathroom connects directly across from the walk in closet so they face entry ways) and went to ask me something when she gasped and said “Look up.”

My blood turned cold immediately. There it was: The entry point dry wall lid was lifted out of place and set ajar. She had been giving our child a bath at the same time, basically right there and I froze for a moment not knowing exactly how to handle the situation. I got a hold of myself and dialed 911 while my Wife and child went downstairs in a hurry. 

She got the both of them ready while I stayed on guard watching the entry to the attic crawl space. 

Police showed up after what felt like an eternity and checked up there but couldn’t find anything. No signs of forced entry etc. just an obviously lifted up and placed ajar crawl space cover. 

Now I’m here alone wondering if we over reacted or what the fuck exactly happened?

Somebody or something moved that lid/ door/ cover or whatever you want to call it. It wasn’t bumped or hit by myself or my Wife and my Child is not able to get anywhere near the access point. 

The creepiest part/ thing that bothers me the most is I dont know if it was moved from inside the attic or from my closet below. Police said the drywall that connects up there wasn’t broken or cut open etc (Again, I live in a Condo with neighbors on both sides.) and there was no signs of disturbed Fiber glass near the entry or around my closet so no one was like obviously crawling around or messing shit up at least.

Im seriously thinking about somehow placing a lock on the entry point but Im not good with that kind of handy work and wouldn’t even know how to begin cutting/ making a sturdier lid/ access to even try to put a lock on one. 

I know this might not be considered paranormal to most but I had a dream about a similar situation a couple weeks to a month or so ago… In my dream a woman called me seemingly on a random day and said bluntly: “Is there someone inside your house?” I panicked and rushed everyone in my house out the door. I had my Wife out front with my kid but I also had other family members over that day so not exactly the same situation and I can’t remember if we found anyone or anything that day in my dream either. 

It’s been a *strange* night to say the least. I definitely don’t think im going to be getting much of any sleep tonight, that’s for sure.

Thanks again for reading and any advice to my given situation would be greatly appreciated.
