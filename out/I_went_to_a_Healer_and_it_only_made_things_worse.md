Now I've started to write all of this down, more things are coming back to me. Weird details I had forgotten. The text has started to sprawl so I will write some more tomorrow. Here goes. 

The gates opened and unwillingly I went through. Mammy’s hand pressed against the small of my back urging me onwards towards the Healer’s house.

The drive out to Killinthomas Woods was desperate, I had filled a bag with vomit before we had even left the town.
I didn’t want to come here, even less so now having seen the state of the place. The cottage itself was ordinary enough, a pale blue door with a foggy glass crescent above it. Grey pebble dash walls and brownish looking windows. The square garden was walled by too tall leylandii trees. We walked down the soaking and sinking cobblestone path, the edges sinking down. Old cracked terracotta pots were clustered at either side of the doorway, mouldy looking moss and mysterious stalks pouring out of them.
Mammy knocked.

With a loud crack, the door swung open. I felt a tug low in my stomach, twisting, my arms instinctively wrapped around my swollen belly. Cradling it, holding my wool coat closer. I swayed a little, unsteady now. The familiar throb in the back of my head hit me along with the taste of bile rising in my throat.

The Healer was huge and pale. She wore layers of fine fabrics, mothlike and delicate, they moved about her softly like cobwebs. Her eyes seemed too large for her face, milky blue and red rimmed. They cast around quickly, searching and looked from my mother, to me and then down to my stomach.

“The baby” she said, “is the baby sick?”

My mother tensed beside me, her jaw clenched. “No, no, we are here for my daughter, Sinéad here. She…she isn’t well”
She stretched out a long hand towards me. Her filthy fingernails rested on my arm for just a moment before she recoiled as if I was burning hot.  Blinking slowly, her lips started moving, although no sound came out. Her long pink fingers clasped at the crucifix hanging around her neck.

Her eyes darted around my body, my face. She frowned and narrowed her eyes. She stilled then and exhaled loudly, her eyes, resting on something just behind me, above my shoulder.
“It’s not your daughter that’s the problem missus.”   She paused, “It’s the divil that’s following her“
I turned, gasping and there was nothing but air and sky and mist from my breath.
“You had better come in” she said, and in we went.
 
We followed through a short hallway with a row of low hanging amber lamps dressed in cobwebs. My mother reached out for my hand.
The hallway opened into a large and bright kitchen. Warm southern sunlight poured onto the patterned lino floor and laminated baby blue presses. Stacks of jam jars filled with strange plants lined thick shelves at the far end of the room, labelled with scraps of paper held in place by yellowing Sellotape. In front of a huge bay window, lavender and roses hung upside down in neat bunches tied with red twine. The Healer waved at us to sit at a small, round wooden table.

“What do you mean by a Divil? What did you see out there?” The questions burst out of me before I could pretend to have good manners.
She lifted a brass kettle sitting on the stove top and brought it over to the metal sink and started filling it with water.

“You have an attachment” she said matter of factly. “That only wants. That is hungry, it’s starving and bitter. I don’t know why or how it got there but it’s making you sick. It’ll keep making you sick and weak and frail…it will keep going until it takes what it wants from you.”
She looked down to my belly and nodded at it. Her eyes met mine for a moment, her grey eyes watering, I could tell she was being deadly serious.

My mother whispered “Oh Jesus” under her breath. I don’t think this is what she was expecting to hear. From what I knew of Mammy she either thought this was the end of the world or absolute nonsense.

The Healer was known around the town for helping people. The O’ Riordan girl had a terrible case of vertigo that lasted months, after one visit she was well again. Women afflicted with miscarriages would go to her to receive miracles. Some would call after they found lumps in their breasts, prayers and poultices would be applied and sometimes the lumps would disappear.

Mammy had been at the Bridge club and when someone asked how I was getting on. Instead of saying fine she said that actually, I was vomiting every day and the Doctors wouldn’t do a damn thing about it, saying that it was anxiety, that I was a first time mother and just needed to relax.

The Healer was mentioned.

Of course, Mammy thought as if, as if I would bring Sinéad. She wouldn’t be able to stop laughing long enough to look the woman in the eye. Her reluctance to broach the subject of the Healer with me changed after I had spent three solid days in bed, vomiting a total of 122 times. My throat was bleeding by the end of it and I told her I wanted to die.
Mammy said “Girl, you had better cop on to yourself that’s not happening “

And so here we were.
