I stood in the queue waiting for my turn to pass through the gates. A big poster outside assured us we were in for a great show, billing itself as the greatest freak show ever to roll into town. 

I walked in expecting sword swallowers, and fire breathers, the usual things you would find in a modern-day freak show, but as I looked around that didn’t seem to be the case. 

“Roll up, roll up. Come in and see the most diabolical monstrosity of the animal kingdom. He’s half man and half Llama."

As I stepped into the tent I was warned not to get too close. I won’t lie, I was highly intrigued, but as I stepped into the tent I was instantly disappointed to find just a Llama munching on hay. 

“What makes him half-man?” I asked. 

The man looked at me with a serious gaze. “He has the head and body of a Llama, but the mind of a man.”

I snorted as I tried to hold in my laughter. “What makes you think he has the mind of a man.” 

“He’s a misogynist, he doesn't like women.” 

Just as I was about to call bullshit the Llama spat a big gollop of spit in my face. 

“Told you so,” said the man running the ridiculous attraction. 

The freakshow didn’t get much better. One attraction said it showcased the most dangerous Mammal on the planet, but when you stepped into the tent you were confronted with a mirror. 

Another was a woman who was born a man, but it was just a man with a beard in a woman's dress. Which I found deeply offensive, to the trans community. 

I think the worst one and the one that made me instantly want to leave was the woman billed as the worst child murderer in history, not incarcerated. She was signing autographs and when I asked her about her title she went into detail about the multiple abortions procedures she had performed as a doctor. It shocked me to my core, not because I’m anti-abortion or pro-choice, but that this was even classed as entertainment.  

I couldn’t hide my disgust as I made my way towards the exit, which caught the attention of some of the people running the attractions. One in particular was a strange-looking old woman who stopped by the exit blocking my escape. 

“You look upset, my dear. What troubles you?” Asked the woman in a sinister tone. 

“I’m leaving and hopefully get my money back. This was the worst experience of my life.” 

“Leaving? But you haven't experienced the whole show.” said the woman as she pointed to a tent hidden away in the corner. 

I started to feel a little uneasy as two rough-looking men joined her in blocking my way. 

“I don’t want any trouble, all I want to do is leave.” 

“Join me in my tent for one more show and I promise you won’t leave disappointed.”

A sense of dread crept up my spine as the woman took me by the hand and walked me over to the tent. The sign on the entrance read “Misfortune Teller,” 

“Why would I want my misfortune read,” I thought to myself as she sat me down.

"Since you had such a terrible time at my freakshow I won’t charge you for a reading,” she explained as she took my hand. 

She looked into my eyes as she ran her fingers over the contours of my hand. 

“You had such a misfortunate childhood growing up, which followed you into adulthood. But that’s all going to change when you become the star of your own show.”

“That doesn't sound too misfortunate,” I said as I nervously laughed. The old woman gave me a scolding look before she forcibly pulled my hand closer to her. 

“There is no future for you that ends with fortune,” she said as she began to cackle like a demented witch. I was gripped with fear as I tried desperately to free myself from the woman's grasp.  

I turned to make my escape as she let go of my hand. I could hear her continue to laugh menacingly as I ran from the tent. 

As soon as I left the tent I realized something was terribly wrong. Everything was pitched black and I couldn’t make out where I was. I could hear whispers all around me, and the sound of a steel gate closing behind me. 

Suddenly lights lit up a big stage as a crowd of people gasped loudly. A wave of panic struck when I realized I was confined to a cage. I screamed and pleaded for help and tried in vain to free myself. 

A man dressed in a ringmaster outfit stepped onto the stage as everyone clapped. 

“Ladies and gentlemen. I introduce to you a woman so insane they kept her locked in a mental hospital for most of her life.” 

The more I cried and begged for help the more the audience clapped and cheered. 

It felt like I was back in the hospital trying to convince the doctors I was sane and safe to be left out. 

“For just a small fee you get to look this deranged woman in the eyes. A woman who as a child murdered her whole family by setting fire to her house.” 

The old misfortune teller took money from the people as they took turns coming up to the stage to gawk and point at me in disgust. As if I was the main attraction of the freakshow.
