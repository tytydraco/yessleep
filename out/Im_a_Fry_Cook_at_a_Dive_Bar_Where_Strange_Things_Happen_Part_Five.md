The next thing I remember, I was jolted awake by a man knocking on my window. The quick movement of surprise caused a pain that felt like my head was split down the middle. I looked over at the man. He had long matted hair and a beard. His clothes were dirty and old. When I rolled the window down he asked if I had any change. I smiled at the man as I handed him a twenty. I know a lot of people think that is too much, but I was at the lowest point in my life. So I was a little sympathetic to this man down on his luck. Little did I know I could actually get lower.

  
I drove across the street to the bar. I was already late for my shift and hoped that Dave wouldn’t yell at me. My head wouldn’t be able to take any loud noise today. I winced when I closed my door. The sound alone felt like slamming my head against a brick wall. I walked to the employee entrance, glad I hadn’t eaten anything. The nausea I felt was enough to make me throw up any breakfast I would have had.

  
I paused at the front door and just stared at it. I had the memories of last night flood my mind and threaten to pour out of my eyes in the form of salty tears. “God Henry, I’m so sorry.” I sniffled a few times and pulled myself together before walking inside.

  
The sudden noise of the kitchen caused my vision to blur. I stumbled a bit before catching myself on the wall. As I began to gain back my footing I saw Dave peak in at me from the kitchen. He looked pissed…“Shit.”

  
Dave nodded, “Shit is right. Get your ass into my office right now.” I stumbled after him as he walked to his office. I could feel everyone giving me nervous glances as I walked by. Nathan and Jose who would usually greet me with a hearty, “look who it is!” Now quietly watch me walk to ,what could be, my execution. Henry stood there looking suspiciously at…Wait. I turned to look at Henry. My eyes widened and began to tear up. He looked fine, like nothing had ever happened. I was going to say something before I felt a hand on my collar. Dave dragged me into his office and threw me against the wall, sending things falling to the ground. The air was knocked out of me and before I could recover, Dave was in my face. His hands gripped my shirt collar and forced me up against the wall. His nose was inches from mine as he kicked his door closed with his foot. “What the fuck did you think you were doing last night? Calling the police to the bar? You know the rules, Levi.” Spit splashed against my face as he shouted at me. Each syllable made my vision blur. He seemed to wait for my response but my mind swam from the sight of Henry as well as my concussion. 

  
I was pulled back into the moment by the feeling of cold steel against my temple and the click of a hammer. Dave had pulled out his .38 special revolver for some motivation. “I’m sorry Dave but Henry-”

  
“I know what you told the dispatcher,” He said as I saw his finger move to the trigger out of the corner of my eye. “What I want to know is why? Are you trying to bust me? I can’t have pigs sniffing around my bar.”

  
“Henry had dunked his head into the fryer and I called the police to report it.” I stammered out. I knew that Dave’s threat could turn into action if I wasn’t careful.

  
“Now Levi,” Dave said slowly and calmly, “I want you to know I didn’t just blow your brains out because you are my best worker.” There was a sudden rage that flared as he spoke his next sentence, “but if you fucking lie to me again, no one will find your body!”

  
I saw the fire in his eyes dim a bit as he saw my confusion. “What? N-no I swear. That’s what happened. He had carved these weird symbols into his arm and dunked his head into the fryer.” I prepared to hear a deafening bang and feel the emptiness of death after my response, but it never came. I jumped a bit as Dave disengaged the hammer. I breathed a sigh of relief as the revolver disappeared into his waistband. 

  
He seemed deep in thought as he waved me out. “I’m docking your pay for a week for being late today.” I accepted that to what was almost the alternative. I tried to exit quickly but Dave’s voice stopped me as I grabbed the door handle. “Oh and Levi?” I turned to look at him. His thoughtful expression had been replaced with one of rage. “If you call the police here again, I’ll dunk your head in that fryer and no one will find your body.” I nodded quickly before stumbling out of the office.

  
I shuffled my way past Jose and Nathan, ignoring their whispered questions of what I was thinking. I approached Henry who seemed prepared to defend himself from an attack. I scooped him up in my arms in a bear hug. “Jesus Christ Henry, it really is you.” I set him down. He looked surprised. “I’m so happy I’m not dreaming.” I was fighting back tears as I examined my friend's face. He gave me his fake smile, “of course it’s really me.” He sounded just as confused as I felt. “Are you okay Levi? Have you been drinking? You look a little…unstable.” He looked me up and down as I wobbled a bit. 

  
I nodded, sending a tsunami of pain through my head. “Y-yeah Henry…I’m fine.” I felt my heart flutter as I put my hand firmly on his shoulder. He jumped a bit when I touched him. I was confused by this but brushed it off. We stood there awkwardly for a few minutes before our screen began flooding with orders for the lunch rush. We jumped into our work without another word.

  
The rest of my shift was spent in an awkward silence. I didn’t know what to say to Henry and he didn’t know what to say to me. A couple of times Nathan or Jose tried to cut through the tension with small talk but quickly learned it just made it worse. I fought back my nausea, headache, and confusion as I silently did my job. I ignored the suspicious glances from Henry and Dave.

  
Eventually our shifts came to a close. Nathan and Jose volunteered to close the kitchen even though it was my turn. I thanked them and as I got ready to leave Henry approached me. He glanced around before whispering, “meet me out back,” before walking out. I threw my jacket on and followed him a few minutes later. I walked out ignoring the dirty look from Dave as I passed by his office. I turned around the corner and saw Henry messing with his right hand. As I approached he looked up at me. “Hey man, what did you-” I was cut off as he grabbed the collar of my shirt, and for the second time that night I was slammed against a wall. Stars danced in my vision as Henry picked me up off the ground. I out weighed him by at least a hundred pounds. A twig had more mass than his arms. But he effortlessly lifted me off my feet. “What the fu-”

  
“Why the fuck were you at the bar last night?” He glared up at me. For some reason I felt like I had a gun to my head again and any wrong answer would kill me.

  
“N-Nathan told me you were acting suspicious and wanted me to keep an eye on you. I saw you trying to pick the lock to the back door and followed you in.”

  
“Don’t lie to me.”

  
“I’m not lying!” I felt my fear building as I saw rage fill Henry’s eyes.

  
“I guess I’ll know soon.” He covered my mouth with his right hand. A metallic taste filled my mouth as he spoke in a strange language. It sounded like he said, “elle het ruth-t,” or something like that. I suddenly felt something trying to slither down my throat. I began to kick and struggle but even with one hand holding me up, I couldn’t move. The wet, slimy thing moved deeper and deeper, suffocating me. I began to panic as I tried to inhale but couldn’t. I kicked harder, I even kicked Henry in the side a few times with all my strength. It was like kicking a wall, he didn’t even flinch. My vision became narrow as I felt my consciousness slipping away. Before I dipped into sweat unconsciousness, the thing blocking my airway disappeared. Henry removed his hand and I saw the symbol he had carved into it.

  
“Now tell me what really happened last night.” Before I could think, my mouth moved on its own. It was in my voice but I knew it wasn’t actually from me. I recounted all of what happened last night. I even expressed the despair I felt, even though I tried to stop myself. When I was finished, tears streamed down my cheeks. Henry’s face matched my own. Rivers of salty water fell from his eyes down his cheeks. The guilt that painted his features surprised me. “Oh god Levi, I’m so sorry.” He cupped his hand over my mouth again and spoke in his strange language. This time it sounded like, “ees-rel.” 

  
I began to feel the slithering again. Whatever it was wanted to escape my body. Henry let me go and I bent over gagging. It felt like I was trying to throw up a cactus. My throat felt like it was being ripped apart as the thing worked its way up my throat. My airway was blocked again as my mouth was pushed open. My jaw felt like it was going to be ripped apart as a worm looking creature slowly slithered from my mouth. I tried to scream but my closed airway made it impossible. Its head turned to face me. It had a mouth that opened in six different directions. It reminded me of a flower blooming as it opened its mouth to hiss at me. Rows of teeth covered its mouth and disappeared into the darkness of its body. I felt my body vomit but it got stuck under this monster. It moved painfully slowly as it tried to escape me. Eventually it got far enough that I could breathe through my nose. I thought it would be a blessing but it was a cure, as the vomit that had been stuck rocketed out of my nose. It burned my sinuses making every sweat inhale of oxygen a punishment as it sent fire into my lungs. I felt when the worm slipped out of my mouth and plopped onto the ground into my vomit. It wiggled and screeched as it began to smolder and burn away in front of my eyes. I vomited again, covering it in another layer of vomit. I took a few minutes to catch my breath before wiping my mouth and standing up.

  
Between gasps of air I frowned, “Henry…What…The…Fuck…?” My body finally gave in as I slumped forward exhausted. I felt Henry catch me as I fell. I slipped into unconsciousness again as I heard Henry quietly apologizing to me over and over again.
