Getting on an airplane for the first time is exhilarating, is it not? Putting all your trust into someone you've never met or talked to to get you to your destination. Yet we rarely think about who's in the front seat, at the back or beside you. Why should we? I'm focused on myself. Putting on a 2-hour playlist while I take a small nap as the plane soars the skies.

And after a 3 hour journey through the clouds, I'll be at my destination. Wow. Isn't it wonderful?

Let me recount a story my father told me, a year before he died. Now while I am seated at the lounge, sipping on this lukewarm coffee, the story haunts me. I wonder why. 

I think I see her seated too.

As my father recalled-

Amidst the crowd of weary travelers, she sat alone, her presence almost ethereal. Her eyes, hollow and distant, scanned the departure board with disinterest. Flight after flight appeared, but she waited for none. The woman was striking in her stillness, a stark contrast to the bustling terminal. Her pale skin, draped in a simple black dress, made her seem out of place, as if she were a ghost of someone who had once existed.

The announcement of Flight 203 to New York echoed through the terminal. Passengers rushed to Gate 17, where she was seated. But as they boarded, no one seemed to notice her. She remained seated, her gaze fixed on something far beyond the confines of the airport.

The clock struck midnight, and the last call for boarding sounded. A man in a gray suit, distracted by a phone call, tripped over her bag. He muttered an apology, but when he looked up, she was staring directly at him. Her eyes bore into his soul.

"Are you waiting for this flight?" he asked, trying to shake off the unease that her gaze had stirred.

She tilted her head slightly, as if pondering the question. "No," she replied, her voice barely more than a whisper. "I’m waiting for something else."

He glanced at the gate, the attendant calling for final boarding. "You’re going to miss it," he said.

She smiled, but there was no warmth in it. "I’ve already missed everything," she said, turning her eyes back to the departure board.

The man hesitated, then nodded and walked away, shaken by the encounter. He boarded the plane, trying to forget the woman with the empty eyes.

The plane taxied down the runway, lifting into the night sky. Inside, passengers settled into their seats, and the hum of the engines lulled them into a false sense of security. But the woman was there, too, seated silently in the back, unnoticed by everyone.

As the plane ascended, the cabin lights flickered. Passengers glanced around, their unease growing. The man in the gray suit felt a familiar chill. He turned, and there she was, sitting a few rows behind him, her eyes fixed on him.

The lights flickered again, and suddenly, everything went dark. Panic spread through the cabin as the plane began to shake violently. The man fumbled for his seatbelt, his heart pounding in his chest.

A low, rumbling voice filled the cabin, but it wasn’t coming from the intercom. It was inside his head, reverberating through his mind. "You think you’re flying towards your future, but you’re only escaping the inevitable," the voice said. "You are all passengers on a journey to nowhere."

The plane plunged into a free fall. Screams filled the cabin, but the woman remained calm, her eyes locked on the man. She mouthed words he couldn’t hear, but he understood them as if they were his own thoughts.

"Life is a fleeting moment, a blip in the vastness of eternity. We search for meaning, but there is none. Only the void, waiting to swallow us whole."

The plane plummeted through the clouds, the ground rushing towards them. The man closed his eyes, bracing for impact. But there was no crash, no fiery explosion. Instead, he found himself back in the airport terminal, standing in front of Gate 17. The departure board flashed "Flight 203 – Now Boarding."

He looked around in confusion. The woman was gone, but her presence lingered like a shadow in his mind. He checked his watch. Midnight. The same time as before. Had it all been a nightmare?

But then he noticed the other passengers, the same faces from the flight. They moved in a daze, repeating the motions of boarding, as if trapped in an endless loop.

The man turned to the gate, but something stopped him. A sense of dread washed over him, and he knew that boarding the plane would only lead him back to that existential abyss.

Instead, he looked around the terminal, searching for the woman. She was nowhere to be found, but her words echoed in his mind. "Life is a fleeting moment, a blip in the vastness of eternity. We search for meaning, but there is none."

The announcement for final boarding blared through the speakers, but the man remained frozen in place. He understood now. There was no escape. The terminal, the plane, the endless loop—it was all the same. The journey would never end, and neither would the search for meaning in a meaningless existence.

The woman at the airport had shown him the truth: Life was an endless cycle, a cruel joke played by the universe. There was no destination, only the journey. And in the end, they were all just passengers, waiting for a flight that would never truly take off.
