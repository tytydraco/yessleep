YourSweeterSelf.com was one of those horrid, hidden webpages that could only have existed during the days of the digital Wild West. Do you remember those times? A weighty monitor. A clunky keyboard. Beneath a desk in the study, the family’s shared computer whirred achingly — clogged with years of dust and mites. You moaned when your sibling played flash games past the allotted time-slot. Worst of all, you naively browsed unsafe websites.

And YourSweeterSelf.com was the *worst* of the lot.

The site became an epidemic in my town. *Only* in my town, I would eventually learn. Users submitted their personal details, which should already toll alarm bells. In return, they received personalised predictions of their future lives. Their sweeter lives.

“What happened to YourSweeterSelf.com?” I asked my brother.

“You don’t remember?” He whispered.

I shrugged. “I mean… It was, what, twenty years ago? My childhood memories are foggy.”

“That’s a good thing,” He firmly replied.

“Come on, Leon,” I protested. “Why are you being so weird?”

“Didn’t you ever wonder why my best friend left?” My brother asked.

“Ella Harris? Not really,” I said. “You drifted apart over the years…”

Five years prior to the Harris family moving away, Leon introduced me to the website. He allowed me to join him in the study — a rarity from my sulky teenage brother. I sat on the filthy, threadbare carpet, watching my idol.

“I’m going to show you something cool, Erik. Do you promise not to tell Mum and Dad?” He asked.

I vigorously nodded my head, burying my elbows into my crossed legs and resting my chin on my palms. ‘YourSweeterSelf.com’ was sitting in the address bar, and Leon tapped the Enter key. A screen of hideously mismatched colours appeared — that was, of course, web design of the *highest* calibre in the 2000s. And the page’s heading read:

*Welcome to Your Sweeter Self…*

“So, you tell the website everything about yourself,” Leon explained, typing away. “Then, it reveals your future! And, most importantly of all, *it comes true*.”

I giggled. “That’s silly, Leon.”

At that moment, the doorbell rang.

“Oh, that’ll be Ella!” My brother gushed, springing out of his seat.

“Oooo, Ella!” I teased.

Leon re-entered the room with his best friend in tow. To my eight-year-old eyes, she and my brother seemed so ancient and wise. I would've done anything to be like them. Anything.

“Ladies first!” Leon said, offering Ella the chair. “Just delete my information. I barely started.”

“Such a gentleman,” She giggled.

I made smooching faces at my brother, and he scowled at me.

“Name, age, and address…” Ella said, filling the text boxes. “Right, I’ve done all of the boring parts. Now, it’s time for some fun! This is how the site predicts your future. ‘Interests’… *Watching films and petting dogs*… What else shall I say?”

“Well, you need to ‘manifest’ the best possible future,” My brother said.

“What does that mean?” I asked.

Leon smiled smugly. “It’s just a little word I learnt from Mrs Ashcroft. Something to do with, erm, making things happen… This site is supposed to give you the perfect future, right?”

“Right,” Ella said.

“So, you need to, like, big yourself up,” Leon shrugged. “The better you sound, the better your future.”

“Makes sense,” Ella nodded, typing. “*I’m a big fan of horror films… I’d love to be a Hollywood actor one day*.”

“There we go!” Leon said, laughing and playfully pushing her. “You could be the next Neve Campbell — you look like her! There’ll be plenty of Scream films in the future. That franchise never dies.”

“Don’t you fancy Neve Campbell?” Ella asked.

Leon blushed, awkwardly clearing his throat. “Anyway, you should… That’s probably, erm, enough. Let’s fill ‘Talents’…”

“*I’m a champ at the piano*!” She said, delightfully clacking keys. “What about ‘Weaknesses’? Oh, I know… *I’m a chatterbox, and I laugh really loudly*.”

Leon shrugged. “I like all of that stuff.”

Ella blushed. “It’s smart to include ‘Weaknesses’ that aren’t actually bad, y’know? Right, here we go…”

She took a deep breath, hovered her index finger above the Enter key, and pressed.

A ‘Processing’ page loaded, and the three of us sat in impatient, fidgety silence — pupils rotating in synchronicity with the circular loading bubble. And then the garish, multi-coloured website returned. The result read:

*Your Sweeter Self awaits…*

*Ella Harris, your future is looking bright. You will star in a film as a successful pianist. You will live happily ever after with a German Shepherd. Once you're a star, you will never have to lift a finger or move a muscle. You're a princess!*

“Wow… An actor and a musician? That’s amazing, Ella!” Leon said.

She chuckled. “Right, your turn now! I’m eager to see—”

The door swung open. That moment every child dreads — the unannounced entry of a parent.

“Kids, didn’t you hear your mum? Dinner’s ready, and… Ella, it’s lovely to see you!” My dad said. “Leon’s mum made a plate for you too.”

“Thanks, Mr Poole!” Ella replied.

“What are you little computer gremlins doing?” Dad asked, leaning towards the screen. “Your Sweeter Self… Wait, what is this? I’ve heard about this…”

“Nothing, Dad… We’ll—” My brother started.

“— No, Mike’s dad was talking about this website. Did you post personal information online, Leon?” Dad asked, tone deepening.

“Dad, I—” Leon started.

“— He didn’t submit anything, Mr Poole. It was me,” Ella interrupted.

My dad sighed, adopting a gentler voice. “I’m really sorry, Ella, but I’m going to have to tell your parents about this. You mustn’t put personal information online. Do you understand?”

Ella’s face dropped. “My dad will kill me…”

“Well, it wouldn’t be right to keep it a secret,” My dad softly explained. “Come on. Dinner time. And make sure none of you *ever* do anything like this again. Okay?”

I could see the frustration in Leon’s eyes. Dad was ruining *everything* for him and the girl he liked.

“Oh, and I’m changing the password tonight, Leon,” Dad said, whilst we walked out of the room. “It’s bad enough that you’re visiting dangerous sites, but I’m *very* disappointed that you involved your little brother.”

“Yes, Dad,” My brother angrily mumbled.

He never got to see his future on YourSweeterSelf.com, and that would be the greatest blessing of his life.

Over the following years, though Leon and Ella went to the same high school and sixth-form, they grew apart. There was no serious falling out. Not even necessarily the natural drifting that happens as children age. No, it was stranger than that. My brother told me that Ella became reclusive — unnaturally quiet. She didn’t talk to anyone. She even stopped taking the bus — she would walk for hours to get home. And, in *spite* of those long treks, she somehow gained an excessive amount of weight.

“And the mystery walks continued when she started sixth-form," My brother said. "Everybody noticed that Ella was walking the wrong way home. You know, we actually sat together for two years in Maths, and she would talk to me if we had to work in a pair, but she otherwise ignored *everyone*.”

Leon hesitated. “Anyway… I decided I had to know what was happening. I did something bad… I followed her home from college.”

“Yikes…” I sucked my teeth. “That’s… Okay. Where did she go?”

Leon followed Ella at a distance of roughly a hundred yards. She took a winding path through the nearby park, and the day’s light was dying. Night came, and Leon started to regret his decision. But they walked for another thirty minutes or so, until Ella reached a dilapidated warehouse at the outskirts of town — far from *either* of their houses. Leon concealed himself in some shrubbery, skulking in the shadows.

Ella knocked, waited no more than ten seconds, and the old, wooden door opened. My brother couldn’t see who waited in the doorway. He only saw his childhood friend enter. Every instinct was telling him to run home, but he didn’t.

“I always loved her,” My brother finally admitted to me. “And I had to know why she’d abandoned everyone who loved her — why she’d transformed into a hollow shell. So, I found another door…”

“You went *in* there?” I asked.

Leon nodded. He told me that he clambered through an entryway barred with flimsy, rotten planks of wood. An obstruction that effortlessly crumbled beneath the sole of his shoe — fortunately, he didn’t have to make a great deal of noise. My brother climbed over rubble from the crumbling building and made his way to a wooden door in a brick wall. There were voices on the other side. Leon said that he’d never been so afraid in his life.

But that would soon change.

My brother quietly inched the door open, tiptoed through the gap, and faced the old factory floor. Beyond the rusted remnants of expended machinery, he discerned a large gathering of people.

“Good evening!” A man shouted.

“Good evening, Philip,” A haunting chorus responded.

Leon crept into the ancient, dimly-lit mill room, cowering behind equipment. A row of grimy, tubed lights cast a greyish glow over two dozen people. Half of them were teenagers — none older than Ella. My brother recognised Mike in the crowd — a friend he’d not seen in years. But what frightened him most was the *other* half of the group.

Towering, leering men who hungrily eyed their prey.

“Today, I have some excellent news — Ella turned eighteen this week!” Philip roared, sparking a round of applause.

Leon detailed the enigmatic leader to me. Balding head. Decaying teeth. Patchy, food-stained beard. Rimmed glasses that continuously sailed down the bridge of his sweaty nose. The description sounded so familiar.

“Are you ready to make a film, Ella?” Philip asked.

She absent-mindedly nodded.

“Wonderful! Follow me, everybody,” The yellow-toothed man grinned.

Leon crouched lowly, watching the crowd of men and children enter another doorway in a neat, single file. When their footsteps faded, my brother emerged from his hiding spot and rushed towards the door. He pressed his ear against the wooden surface, but he couldn’t hear anybody on the other side. And he was surprised, upon opening it, to find a room of computers. Each screen cast a blaring white glow across the otherwise-unlit room. They all displayed the same website.

*YourSweeterSelf.com.*

Leon told me that he almost fainted from fright — I felt much the same as he told the tale. He hadn't expected the ugly page to rear its head after five years.

But my brother bravely pressed onwards. He sat at one of the desks and quickly realised he was looking at an administrative version of the website. On the screen, there was a taskbar with numerous options. One particular button stood out:

***‘Moulding’***

He selected the tab, and a long list of blue, underlined links appeared. But Leon was drawn to the purple hyperlink at the top of the page — it sat under the headline ‘Feast Day’:

***Ella***

“I immediately clicked on it, and I found a page of uploaded files — each one had a ‘.gc’ extension. One by one, I opened them… They were bizarre videos of ‘Experiments’ dating back to 2004,” Leon shuddered. “Ella chanted unsettling things in a language I didn’t understand. She practised the piano until her fingers bled. They trained her dog to viciously attack her when she made mistakes. They told her that hardship would make her dreams come true — it would make her body *blossom*. As the years went by, her belly grew, and her eyes became increasingly vacant…”

“What did you do?” I whispered.

“I dialled 999,” Leon replied.

“What did you tell them?” I asked.

“I made assumptions, Erik. What assumptions are you making?” He quietly asked.

“The… worst kind…” I whispered.

“Yeah…” Leon nodded. “I told the operator that something horrible was happening in the warehouse by the lake. I said it might involve child grooming. They immediately sent patrol cars.”

“Okay. I understand. Ella and her parents left town because she was traumatised,” I said.

“No, that’s not… Erik, I…” Leon croaked. “Do you *really* not remember?”

I frowned, shaking my head.

My brother trembled. “The operator told me to leave the warehouse, but I wouldn't abandon Ella. I heard talking coming from the next room, so I… crept inside. There were dozens of teenagers in there. Dozens of adults too. The moulded and the *moulders*.”

Leon paused for a second, clutching his hair in pain. “I don’t know how to explain the next part… But each child bore an eyeless face. Not gouged. *Eyeless* — as if skin had grown over their pupils… Minutes earlier, on the factory floor, the faces of those *same children* were full and featured. They couldn't have been surgically altered… There wasn’t enough time. *What happened to them*?”

“Leon…” I started, feeling queasy.

“– Nobody saw me lurking in the darkness,” He interrupted. “The faceless children swayed blindly, and the adults watched Ella’s performance. Philip was filming her with a bulky camera on a tripod. She played the piano, and the adults slowly surged towards her…”

Leon shivered in horror, and I joined him. “The horror happened so quickly. So *terribly* quickly. The men started clawing at her arms and legs… They devoured strips of her flesh. *How sweet does she taste?* Philip asked, laughing horribly. One man replied that he could *taste her talent*…”

I vomited on the floor, but my brother continued telling the haunting story.

“The worst part of all — the part I've still not erased from my mind — is that she was *laughing*, Erik. She *laughed* as they ate her alive,” Leon whispered. “And she continued playing the piano until they gnawed her arms and legs down to the bone. Until she was a limbless torso, unable to press the keys or the pedal — unable to do anything but motionlessly *laugh*.”

It was a horrifying description, but I didn’t understand why I was crying.

“I walked past the children — blind statues, awaiting the return of their masters. I was driven by an urge to stop the nightmare… You don’t know what I saw next, do you?” Leon asked.

I shook my head, but some part of me did. Some long-lost, long-absent part of me.

“I saw *you*, Erik,” He sobbed. “My blind brother. Standing beside the cameraman…”

“Philip…” I said, tears dripping into my open lips.

“Very good,” The mastermind announced, chuckling sadistically. “Ella, your sweeter self has satiated their desires. You have fed them well. Do you feel like a star?”

“Yes,” Ella monotonously replied. “Thank you...”

Her torso was propped against the piano. Leon claimed that the sockets of her shoulder and pelvis were coated with fresh flesh — as smooth as the skin across the children’s faces. There were no wounds. No indication that Ella's arms and legs had just been savagely torn from her body, and eaten, other than the most blatant evidence — Ella was nothing but a talking head and a bulging abdomen. She kept laughing until the police arrived half an hour later.

*How did she survive?*

“Did you go on the computer before Dad changed the password, Erik?” My brother asked. “Did you go back on that website?”

“I don’t know!” I wailed. “It was so long ago… Why don’t I remember? Why is it all so… foggy?”

Leon cried, and we hugged tightly. “There was something else... Do you remember the machine in the corner of Philip’s Great Hall? A server. It was a box with red lights. He said it was—”

“— *The dream maker*,” I finished, recalling a fragment of that distant horror. “Every day, Philip would talk to it… The humming metallic box in the grimiest crevice of the room. It was covered with tangled wires that looked like limbs. And two flashing lights beamed from its front panel — they looked like the Devil’s eyes.”

“It wasn’t alive, Erik…” My brother said, consoling me.

“But… You saw it with your own eyes. They did something otherworldly to us. They *grew* us — fattened us with hopes and dreams — so they could feed. But you… saved us.”

“It wasn’t me. The police came,” My brother whispered, averting his gaze. “Let’s just forget about—”

“— No. *Before* the police came. Before anyone could stop you. You demolished the server,” I said.

Leon blubbered, wiping away an endless stream of tears. “You were right, Erik. Enough. Stop.”

I shook my head. “I remember the skin peeling away. My eyes returned. My mind. You saved all of the children. I… I forgot, Leon.”

“I know, Erik,” He hoarsely said. “Most of the children recovered. But Ella was a shell afterwards — brutalised not just physically, but mentally. She was mostly catatonic. Even after the moulders were jailed, she didn’t wake from that awful trance. *They've not finished the meal,* She repeatedly whispered.”

“How do you know that?” I shuddered.

“Ella's parents talked — and still talk — to Mum and Dad… They hoped it would keep me in her life — bring us back together,” Leon explained. “They feel responsible. After Dad told them about the website, they got rid of the computer — they had no idea she was still in contact with those monsters."

"They couldn't have known," I said.

"Ella was committed to a psychiatric ward," Leon said. "She’s not allowed visitors anymore.”

Later that night, whilst reflecting on my brother's terrifying tale, a frightful childhood memory flooded back. On Ella’s Feast Day, Philip said something to me.

“Five years to go, Erik…” He softly whispered, stale breath clouding my ear.
