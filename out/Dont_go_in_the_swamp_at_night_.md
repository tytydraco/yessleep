I turn my truck on the side roads of the swamp near my home in Louisiana and watch over the calm murky waters " nice night for a boat ride " I tell myself and turn my engine off 

It's been a hectic week at work with a bunch of animals missing as well as some * unidentified massive footprints * some bio tech company looking into one of its " assets" missing but that's not of my concern or pay grade I turn to go out of my car and then I see my phone blind me with light it's about 10:40 pm and all I see on my phone Is 

* DANGEROUS ANIMAL SIGTHED IN LOCAL AREA AVOID KNOWN AREAS THAT THIS ANIMAL HABITATES DO NOT ENGAGE THIS ANIMAL IS VERY FAST AND DANGEROUS * 

As well as the usual beeps and alarm noises 
I went to grab my phone to read the rest of it when I hear a high pitched banshee wail coming from the far side of the water, 

" Shit. I don't think'll be able to call for backup to arrive at a reasonable time " I look out on the water and see small ripples dance across the water with urgency " aw fuck it " I say and bolt out of my truck and start to undo the boat from the back of the hitch 


5 minutes later I'm in the water driving my way towards the chorus of screams and crying * c'mon c'mon c'mon you peice of shit * I think to myself as I floor the 20 year old boat motor I slow down as I see debris all over the water bed " what the hell..." I say as I see parts of a house, plumbing and a torn bed that looks like it's been " bitten..?" I turn my flashlight on and take a look around 


" HEY!! Over here!!!" I hear a bellow from a peice of torn roof I turn my boat towards the shouts and wave my my over " hey folks what the hell happened here? Im from the animal patrol of Louisiana what happened to this area??" I stop my boat engine near the torn off roof and a middle aged guy slowly crawls his way down " as soon as we get out of the water the better " he sounds serious and he looks like he's seen death itself, I look behind him at see at least 3 other people all looking like they've been through hell itself 


" Alright everyone let's go " I say as they load on to the boat I look at the various injuries scratches, bruises etc etc, it looks like they where in a tornado or something .. " c.cc. can w.ww.ee go n...now please???" I look down a see a little girl no older than 4 having a death grip on my shirt her eyes are bloodshot and her clothes are all wet like she's been swimming this late 

"Alright everyone hold on" I turn the engine and right a que we all hear a gutteral roar or something coming from at least 2 miles or blocks from where we where " shit it's coming " I hear one of the people whisper I ignore it and slowly start to make my way out of the debris Feild for at least 2 miles all I saw was building materials and the occasional toy from a room whenever we'd pass a toy the grill would sniffle and hug on to her toy bear she's gotten with her

" It's alright sweety " I say and pat her on the head she looks at me and almost on que she whispers " it wasn't supposed to be THAT big on the commercials " I am shocked at her saying this because she never spoken a single word since I was there, I look at the horizon and see my truck on land with at least 4 other officer cars as well as a bio tech company truck.

 " what the hell?" I say as I see a massive thing rise from the water it's like a massive fin from a shark but it's rounded it rocks the boat as I cover the little girls mouth as she is about to scream " shhh it's ok its ok shhhh " hold the little girl as the others stand deathly still as it lowers into the water and moves alway 


I move towards to the motor and one of the middle aged guys stop me before I could start the engine..


" There is more than one "
