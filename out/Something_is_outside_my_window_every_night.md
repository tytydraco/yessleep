I used to go to bed at 10 pm every night without a problem. I can’t do that anymore. It all started a month ago. First it was just light tapping, I thought it was the wind. A couple weeks later I heard someone knock. I got up and I looked out the window and saw nothing. I didn’t think anything of it and went to bed. 

The week after was worse. I was about to go to sleep until I heard a whisper from outside. I go up to the window to hear, thinking it was nothing. “October 29th” the voice said with a giggle. I quickly opened the blinds to see a figure. It’s eyes…. It’s dark dark eyes. I can still see them now whenever I close my eyes… and it’s mouth…. It was grinning from ear to ear with blood dripping from its mouth. It had to be atleast 6 ft tall. My heart was racing and I quickly grabbed my gun that was in a box under my bed. I quickly loaded it and I shot at the figure. 

I blinked. The figure was gone… A teenage girl… laying in the grass with a bullet hole in her chest. I was so confused. I quickly called the ambulance. But it was too late she was already dead. What was that figure!? The next week was torture. I felt immense guilt. I felt like I have gone insane. Couldn’t sleep,couldn’t eat,couldn’t talk! But then at 3 am, I go to the kitchen to try and eat. I hear the window in my bedroom shatter. I walk in the room and there it is. The figure… I am a 230 lb male and 6’1 and have heart troubles. My chest starts to burn. It feels like someone is squeezing my heart. I black out

I wake up feeling distraught “Welcome back!” says the doctor standing over me. “W-what happened” I say while breathing heavily. “You had a heart attack. You flatlined but we brought you back! We need to run a few more tests and have you stay overnight to make sure you’re ok.” The doctor says as he motions the other doctors to leave. The doctor… his face morphs into…. The figure. I scream and I fight it. I dig my nails into it and slam and pound and punch and kick until people come in and hold me down. I blink. The figure disappears the only thing I see is doctors holding me down and a man on the floor. The doctor…. I try to tell them what I saw. They of course didn’t believe me.  I spent the next week in a mental hospital. I had a roommate. His name was Jerry. Jerry didn’t talk much. I wake up one morning and I see jerry is awake. I yawn loudly before saying anything. “Hey Jerry what’s today?” I ask while stretching. “October 29th” He says. October 29th…..  “Wait what?” I ask. “October 29th” Jerry says but this time his voice sounds…. Demonic. I rub my eyes and I look back at what’s supposed to be Jerry and I see a figure. I pass out before anything else happens .

I wake up…. Jerry is gone. I feel nauseous. I immediately go to the toilet to throw up. I look in the toilet. It’s black. Start to feel queasy and I pass out again… I wake up in a house. My memory feels hazy. Look at my hands and all I see is red… blood all over. I look around. There are dead bodies all around me, people I have never seen before.  I hear a voice inside my head. I don’t know what it’s saying. Oh wait…. Now I do. I try hear what it’s saying. “Kill them all.”… I know I don’t have a choice.  I’m not in control of my body. I’m typing this while trying to fight off the urge… the urge to kill. I need to let the viewers know that…. They need to kill them all! :)
