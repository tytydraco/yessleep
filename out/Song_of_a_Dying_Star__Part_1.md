Song of a dying star. This is what I think of when I think of him and his last week being alive. The last week anyone would ever see him alive. I didn’t know him much, at least not back then, he was just my highschool physics teacher. You’re not friends with your highschool teacher, cool as they may be. You like them, you think they’re a kind, and nice person, you have a crush on them if theyre particularly attractive, and then you mostly forget about them when you leave school. His name was Deepak, last name Pandey. Got his name made fun of constantly behind his back because...Well, I guess theres no need going into all that. All’s you need to know is the joke only makes sense in a hyper-specific regional context. Regardless, he was a good teacher, we all loved him, really. He was kind and much better suited to be a teacher than any other faculty member present at our school. He was a smart, brilliant mind clearly stuck in a life he had never envisioned for himself. In that regard, I suppose he was just like most others, trying to make the best of it all.

I believe I am responsible for his sharp and sudden decline. I call it a decline because he started being less and less himself each passing day until he was no longer wholly himself. Back then I didn’t know why, but due to events, I know now that I pushed him over the edge. And he fell into the dizzying, maddenning blackness of the void, and the void emptied him up slowly and spit out something that which was wholly unlike himself. He was a slow and patient man, someone who always took time out of his day to help anyone struggling. I suppose he thought by helping others, he would save himself. It didn’t, or maybe it did. I know him better than most others but I can’t know his every inner thought. I do know that he wanted to be an astrophysicist. He wanted to study the stars and make a name for himself doing that but life didn’t work out that way for him. Instead he got stuck teaching physics to fifteen year olds, watching his brother – his best friend – surpass him in his particular field in every way imaginable. Still there was no sense of envy in him, no resentment against his brother.

At least not that I could sense in his writings. See, I’ve gone through his notes, his diaries and his thoughts. It really does seem all he was, was a kind, honest man. Just this absolute paragon of sincerity. And so, of course I had to break into his mother’s house – a couple months following his death – and steal any diary, any note, really, anything where he might vent his frustrarions, and thoughts, and see for myself what happened. I couldn’t not, I mean. It drove me insane thinking of that last day. Replaying it over and over in my head: what could possibly happen to such an honest man, to turn him into a violent man that was a danger to others. Ironically enough that is when I learned it was me that happened to him.

His death hit me hard, I couldn’t eat, could barely sleep and when I did I dreamt of him. Dreamt of him lunging at that student, his face twisted in anger, with a ferocity that can only be described as animalistic. His hands curled up, angry and snarled, his mouth foaming at the edges, his face going red. I’d see him, lunging at that kid, like a lion pouncing on a deer, knocking the kid over and landing on top of him. The first bones that broke were the kid’s ribs as Deepak landed with his knees punching into the kid’s chest. I heard the crack of bone, the first of many that would follow. I was sitting right next to the kid and so I saw it in full detail. The punches landing incessantly at kid’s head.

*Crack.*

Deepak’s shirt flexing as he pulled his fist back ready to land the next punch.

*Crack.*

The kid had passed out by now. Deepak’s jaw was tense, the foam coming out of his mouth more prominent now.

*Punch. Crack.*

He was wearing a blue shirt that day. I would often wonder if he’d thought he’d be dyeing it red by the afternoon.

*Punch, there was no crack of bone this time.*

His jaw was strong, nice and chiseled and he was broad-shouldered. No wonder most other girls had a crush on him as well.

*Crack*.

His eyes were white now and his knuckles were painted red. Where was everyone else, I’d wonder often in these dreams. Of course I understand it now. They had to step back, the world itself had to step back and let this random act of violence seep through.

*Crack.*

This was the final punch. The relentless punches had carved deep ravines into the kid’s skull until it couldn’t take it anymore and it split under the force. Like the earth itself split open, like the kid’s skull, and swallowed him whole.

He wouldn’t be seen until about a week later when his dead body turned up way up in the mountains. In a small village near the Mata Vaishno Devi bhavan, all the way in Katra. I would have these dreams, recurring and often. After that final punch he disappeared. I realised I loved the man so of course his death affected me the way it did. I lost him forever that day and I needed answers. So a couple months later I broke into his mother’s home and stole everything about him I could find. Now that I have my answers though, I can’t help but understand him. I can’t help but justify his actions. Whatever it was that happened to him, whatever it was that swallowed him whole and spit out something else entirely, is now after me, and I understand him now.
