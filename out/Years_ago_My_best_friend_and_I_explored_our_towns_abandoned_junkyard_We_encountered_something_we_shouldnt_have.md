This happened quite a few years ago. It was the 70s, it was a hot summer that year and freedom was in the air. Well, I'm probably being a little bit too theatrical describing it like that but at the time, I would've definitely agreed.   
I was only 17, just graduated from high school and wanting to be wild throughout the summer before the mundanity of adulthood came to claim me.   
My best friend, Adam, was by my side during this time. Describing him wouldn't do him justice, but the man was crazy in all the good ways. Adam had an endless supply of beer and stupid fun ideas.   
For the first few weeks of Summer, We mainly pass the time by getting drunk and playing pool at the bar. Adam and I also did some stuff that I wouldn't be too proud to admit today, basically cat-calling and harassing girls or hitting down mailboxes in random neighborhoods with our bats.   
I still find it kind of hard to believe that me and that kid from the '70s were the same person, but I guess that's what life is about; constantly changing and evolving.  
Anyways, this story happened probably around the middle of summer. The day was actually quite uneventful. We mainly just swam in the nearby lake with some girls from our school and drank through a whole lot of beer packs.  By now, night had fallen and the girls had left. It was quite starry that night and we had a little fire going. Me and Adam were basically just talking about whatever, anything between a truck that we both wanted and what our futures would hold. Midway through our conversation, Adam's face lit up, like he had just remembered something.   
"Hey, you okay?" I asked  
"Yeah, I'm fine! It's just, ah…" He stopped for a moment to think for a bit longer, before leaning slightly out of his chair towards me. "Do you remember the Doll Graveyard?"   
It took me a second before I realized what he was talking about. The Doll Graveyard was this old local legend in our town. Basically it was this old abandoned junkyard in the woods. Supposedly, after the old man who owned it previously died, dolls and other sorts of toys started appearing around the property. Some stereotypical ghost story stuff. As kids, we would dare one another to go up to the wire link fence and touch one of the dolls hung up there. But we never went inside, just way too much effort for young kids. But for two, young, bored and fairly drunk guys? That was a different story.   
"Yeah, I remember it. What about it?" I asked, taking a sip of my beer.   
Adam's eyes sparkled with excitement, and he grinned mischievously. "We should go up there! Fuck some shit up!"  
"You serious?"   
"Hell yeah, I'm serious!"  
I chuckled a bit. "Alright, why not?"  
We chugged the last of our beers and extinguished the fire before setting out towards the Doll Graveyard. Adam drove a while on the highway before turning onto an old, twisty patch of dirt road. It was mostly used to get to a popular fishing and camping site, so you had to park your car somewhere and walk the rest of the way if you wanted to get to Doll Graveyard.  
So Adam had parked near the campsite and got out of the car. I grabbed the flashlights from the dashboard and shortly got out myself.   
Adam stood on the exhaust pipe as he searched the back of his truck for something. Before I could ask if he needed some light, Adam grabbed his old trusty baseball bat.  
"Didn't know we're gonna mess the place up." I chuckled, tossing Adam a flashlight as he hopped off the pipe.   
Catching it, Adam smiled and laughed. "It's not like anyone is gonna care, hahaha!"   
With our flashlights in hand, we walked deeper into the woods. Despite being July, it was kinda chilly out that night. The trees were lush with leaves and the plants were thriving. The only noise besides mine and Adam's footsteps and voices were a sympathy of frogs, cicadas, and other animals. Honestly, I know I should describe the scenery as something spooky and scary but it was very beautiful. Maybe it's because I'm not really easily scared by the woods or stuff like that, but something about the stars dimly Illuminating the woods and its plants with a slight blue hue seemed like something straight out of a fairy tale book.   
After what was probably a half hour or so of walking, we finally reached the Doll Graveyard. Most sounds, except the chirping of crickets, came to a complete stop there. Adam led the way towards the gate. Dolls, mold cover toys and shattered glass littered the surrounding outside ground. While possibly hundreds of other dolls were strung up in the trees by strings and across the wire link fence with some kind of wire, their lifeless eyes reflected our flashlight beams back at us. Honestly, the whole thing was freaky as hell and it was kind of surprising that the place was still up. You'd think that our County would have torn it down by now. But I guess it was just so far out that it wasn't even worth it.   
As we approached the gate, we saw it was heavily fortified with a large lock.   
"Ahh, Shit," I said. "What are we gonna do now?"  
"We're going to get in there" Adam walked over to the lock, gripping his bat tightly. And before I could even ask what he was doing, he began smashing the lock.  
I probably forgot to mention that Adam was a beast of a kid. By the age of 14 or so, Adam easily could take down three grown men or more. Plus, he wrestled a lot in high-school so he wasn't a guy you'd want problems with.  
But this lock proved to be a little bit of a challenge. Adam had to hit the thing over a dozen times to get the thing to break. The sweat coming down his large biceps sparkled against the moonlight and my flashlight.   
But eventually, Adam managed to finally break the lock, and the gate creaked open. Inside there were piles of rusty, twisted metal carcasses of cars, trucks, and machinery jutting out from the overgrown vegetation, decorated with even more dolls.   
"Alright! Let's do this!" Adam shouted with an almost crazed expression. The beer had definitely gotten to his brain at this point.   
He ran inside, laughing like a child. Personally, I wasn't that much in a hurry. I stood there for a minute, just taking in the sight of it all, before stepping through the gate.   
At first, I was actually kind of disappointed. Yeah, the dolls were creepy and all but that was about it. At the end of the day, it was just a junkyard. Adam was having a blast though, smashing dolls left and right. Meanwhile, I occupied myself by kicking a doll head that my foot hit as I was walking behind Adam.   
But halfway through the junkyard, Adam stopped dead in his tracks. I stopped playing with the ball and walked up to him, grabbing his shoulder.   
"Oh, shit!" Adam jumped as he turned around to face me.   
I laughed. "What's the matter with ya?"  
"Nothin, but check it out!" He said as he turned back around to point at something.   
I looked to see what he was talking about. Nestled into the corner was this small shack-like building.  Like the rest of the place, it was weathered with age and heavily adorned with an assortment of dolls.   
"What the hell is that?" I uttered to myself.   
"I don't know." Adam replied. "But we're gonna check it out, c'mon!"   
He began running towards the shack, I tried to keep up but he easily beat me to it. Adam grabbed the door handle and twisted, opening the door with a surprising ease.   
Entering the shack, it now appeared to be what used to be an old shop, still having remnants of shelves and display cases, now mostly filled with dusty old dolls and other assortment of toys.  
Adam jumped over the counter and began messing around with an old cash register, joking about how there might be some money still in there. I walked around the store as Adam clicked away. In the corner right of the store, I noticed a door. Piquing my curiosity, I walked over to the door. I stood in front of it, my hand out to grab the door handle but also not moving. I felt like something was… very wrong.  
SMASH!   
The sound made me yelp and jump, it came over from where Adam was. Apparently, after a few failed attempts of trying to get the register open the right way, Adam resorted to the trusty old brute strength method instead. The poor thing was on the ground and getting busted worse than the lock.   
"What the hell are you doing?" I asked Adam, who was laughing like an idiot.  I rolled my eyes, telling that there was a door in the corner and to come check it out.   
He immediately perked up. "A door? Now that's what I'm talking about!"  
Adam followed me to the door, which I then slowly opened. Inside, there were these old stairs that descended into a pitch black void. I shined my flashlight down there, revealing a gray concrete floor.   
"Ladies first." Adam drunkenly joked, doing a half ass curtsy.   
I laughed and lightly punched him in the arm. We then descended the narrow staircase. Each step creaked loudly and the air grew colder. Surprisingly there was a lack of that signature basement mildew scent, it honestly had quite a pleasant smell actually. It was waxy, like a bunch of candles had been burning at the same time, but there was an equally strong hint of floral.  
We got down to the basement, Adam had almost fallen down around two times as we were trying to get down the stairs. The only reason he didn't fall and break his neck was because he kept grabbing ME. Meanwhile I was holding onto walls to keep my balance afloat.  
We looked around the room with my flashlight. There were a couple of mannequins propped up in different places of the rooms. And I just want to remind you that these weren't the faceless white mannequins that you're probably used to today, I'm talking about those slightly uncanny mannequins with the detailed faces and the regular skin tones painted on. Some were nude, while others had unfinished garments pinned onto them still.  
Besides the mannequins and floor, the place didn't look like your typical basement at all. Towards the middle of the room, there was a small couch and chair that formed a makeshift living room of sorts. In the "Living Room" there was a coffee table that had a large radio on it. There was a candle in a glass jar next to it, but not too close. There was also an intact porcelain doll in a white dress on the coffee table as well, leaned up against the wall alongside some smaller knick knacks.   
Across the living room was a small oak sewing table that was pushed against the staircase wall. The table had many drawers. I walked up it and opened one of them. I didn't know what I was expecting when I opened it but I was severely disappointed when it was nothing but different colored threads. But I did find it extremely odd at how organized they were, all of them color coded. The drawer that I opened had different shades of red to yellow threads. It was really weird. There was little to no dust on them, but me being the naive kid, I just brushed it off.   
To the right of the sewing machine, there was a kitchen set that seemed only a decade old, but it didn't have a fridge, just a shelf filled with rolls of fabrics and doll parts. And to the left, there was a larger dining table with a lace tablecloth. It was also covered with dolls, knick-knacks, etc.   
I walked over to it and opened up one of the cupboards. Inside, there were rows of glass jars. Each of them was filled with an assortment of lollipops. Once again I noticed that they were barely touched by dust. Red Flags were popping in my head like wildfire. I turned around to tell Adam that I thought someone was still living here but he was nowhere to be seen.   
I could hear a loud crashing in another room, it had to be Adam. By the radio, there was a door that was slightly cracked open. I walked over to it and slowly pushed it open. A long dark hallway greeted me. There were multiple doors, I think around four? I noticed the one near the end was also cracked open.   
"Adam!" I called out but the only response I got was silence.   
No, I was annoyed and scared. I took a deep breath and made my way down the hall. The taps of my shoes slightly echoed throughout the hall. I opened the door and entered what seemed to be a bedroom. I say that because the place looked to be almost mostly converted into a sewing room or workshop of sorts. But in the middle of the room there was an old canopy bed with dusty pink lace curtains. Though closed, I managed to make out a human figure laying under the covers.   
I gulped. "Adam?"  
I slowly crept up to the bed. My heart was beginning to pound loudly in my ears. I was praying that it was Adam playing a prank or just a mannequin under the covers. A thick darkness surrounded me, the beam from my flashlight was the only that was able to cut through it. Each step felt like it took hours, but eventually I was mere inches away from the foot of the bed. With what I could see from the slight opening of curtains, I could see and hear the soft rhythmic breathing of whoever, or whatever, was in there. I reached out my hand to pull back the curtain. But before I could even grasp it with my fingers, I heard something run up on me.   
Someone grabbed my arm, I dropped my flashlight and could feel the edges of blades cut against my skin. I screamed and tried to pull away from but itI was quickly lifted and flung out of the room, like a ragdoll being thrown by a child throwing a tantrum.   
Immense pain took over my body, especially in the arm that was grabbed. The taste of blood began to fill my mouth. I looked up towards the door, the flashlight still on.  
Standing in the doorway was what I can best describe as an abomination…   
It was tall and janky, and that was the only really normal thing about it. The thing looked like a centipede made of an assortment of mannequin arms, torsos and other toys. The worst part was its main body. On top, was the half of what probably used to be a life-size porcelain doll. Its head was covered by a long veil that obstructed me from making out more details of its face. But what I could tell is that the top torso was fused with another torso, minus another naturally. This effectively gave it two sets of arms.  
 I would say three sets because the monster did have a third torso fused but it seems like it was fashion to act more as its bottom half. The torso split in the middle and Metal rods and toys were used to extend the arms.  
Minus the Veil, The Thing wore a bellowing, long white rag fashioned into a suggestion of a dress. I assumed it did this to cover the rest of its body. Strings dangled from its arms, some were wrapped around a limb.   
"You pigeon-livered WRETCH" The Monster yelled at me, I was shocked that it could even speak. Its voice was somewhat mechanical, like multiple voices layered over each other. A chaotic, masculine voice took dominance over the others.   
I weakly tried to crawl away but The Monster quickly caught up to me with jerky movements. It first grabbed me with its "feet" then handed to its main pairs of hands. The fingers were all replaced, the lower arms had needles, while the upper arms had scissor blades.   
Grabbing me by the collar of my shirt, it slammed me against the wall and leaned its head towards me.   
"What kind of monster tries to kill a man who can't fight back!" The Monster hissed at me. Now much closer, I could make out its face through the Veil, which I greatly regret doing.   
Most of its head seemed to be intact, all except for its mouth, which an human jaw was in its place. It seemed to be amalgamated in place and moved in a twisty fashion whenever The Monster spoke.   
"I have no idea… what you're talking." I managed to whimper.   
"LIAR!" It slammed me into the wall again, much harder this time.   
I groaned in pain. "PLEASE LET ME GO!" Tears started to run down my cheeks, my legs dangling helplessly in the air.   
It scoffed. "You're crying?! Seriously?! What kind of…" The Thing stopped in the middle of its sentence.  
It lightened its grip on me slightly and stopped to think for a moment. But that moment was cut short when Adam screamed from down the hallway.   
"LET HIM GO FREAK!" Charging down the hall, he had the bat in the air and ready to swing.   
The Monster acted quickly, dropping me and started crawling on the floor towards Adam.   
He swung the bat down at its head, using such force that I have never seen him use. But The Monster dodged it with a surprising amount of fluidity. It quickly arose on its feet to the side of him, which Adam swung his bat at but it almost once again dodged the hit in a slither-like fashion. The Thing lunged forward at Adam, seemingly trying to grab his bat but he was the one that dodged the attack this time.   
As they fought, I was trying to get myself back on my feet. The bone from the arm, the right one, that was hurting so badly had snapped and pierced through the skin. I used the less injured arm to grab the wall, but I couldn't get a holding on to anything. The pain throughout my body and arm was just so much that I only managed to get on my knees before falling back into a fetal position on the floor.   
Adam and The Creature were still going at it, and by the time I looked back, The Creature had just managed to grab Adam's baseball bat, tossing it out the hall. But Adam being Adam, this didn't stop him. He lunged forward onto the creature, clearly catching it off guard and began punching it in the head. The two stumbled around the hall, The Monster blocking each of Adam's blows with its arms. They scuffledaround the room, knocking into the walls, picture frames falling and breaking onto the ground. Adam was screaming at the creature, telling it to just die.   
“ENOUGH!” The Monster screamed, a mechanical hiss steaming out as It swung at Adam's face so quickly that wouldn't be able to tell if Adam didn't back up into the wall, clutching his face.   
It continued to slash him. Adam fell onto the ground, the monster showing no mercy.   
I can still remember the screams. Adam's cries were so loud that I thought my eardrums were going to pop. But they were drowned out by The Monster's wails. Mechanical hisses, growls and sobbing are the only correct words I could use to describe it.  
It felt like hours before the Monster stopped beating and clawing on him. I'm not going to fluff it out for y'all, Adam was barely recognizable. Poorly mashed with skin clinging onto broken bones and torn muscles. I could hear slight gurgles emit from what was left of my throat.  
I wanted to scream and cry so bad but I couldn't, instead just laying there, watching the creatures slowly and calmly stand back up straight.   
“Oh dear…” Its voice was much softer now, nearly sounding like a little girl but the other voice still echoed behind it. From what little the light provided, I could see that blood covered the Monster's white rags.   
“Daisy?” A man's voice called out from the bedroom. He had a thick accent, I think German or something, and sounded very groggy.  
Without a second thought, I screamed out for help. The monster or, “Daisy”, quickly waddled over to me and placed one of its many hands over my mouth.  
“Shut up!” It whispered, lifting me up and placing it under one of their arms, another hand covering my mouth. “Don't worry, it's just rats! Go back to sleep.”  
“Daisy” began taking me down the hallway, but this time I tried to thrash and wiggle my way out of its grasp. Though I only proved to be a mild annoyance to it.   
“Can you stop with that?!” It whispered loudly, still carrying me throughout the hallway. Back in the living room, I could hear the man call out for the Monster again but it continued towards the stairs that led back up to the store front. Everything seemed like a blur because it seemed like a second later I was thrown back out into the junkyard. Adrenaline ran through my veins as I scrambled away from the door, which was slammed promptly.   
I wandered back through the woods, and out the way me and Adam came in through on foot, stumbling through bushes and branches. It was grueling, but I eventually emerged and passed out onto the road. Luckily, someone noticed me and took me to the nearest hospital.   
Shortly after I woke up, I was surrounded by family and detectives. They both tried to ask me what happened to me and where Adam was. I tried to explain to the best of my abilities, because of course leaving out important details so they wouldn't think I was high on the painkillers or I was the reason I did something to Adam.   
Which really didn't work in my defense because I was still their number one suspect after they searched the place. They found no Monster, No man in the room. Just the half eaten body of my former best friend…  
Of course, they couldn't charge me with anything, thank god. but many people back home still think I'm a cannibalistic murderer. Can't change it, probably never will. The only thing anyone could do is move forward.
