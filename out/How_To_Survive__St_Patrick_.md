For anyone who wondered what happened before, here's the last piece of advice I had for you.

I know my childhood was fucked up, both pre and post making the worst career choice possible. But the sad thing is, compared to where I’m at now, it was downright quaint. 

That’s a word I want to focus on right now. 

Quaint. 

I doom scroll through this sub as much as the rest of you. Lately I’ve noticed the things people are running into are  bigger, stronger, more mind boggling, more esoteric. 

Now, a more cynical man would chalk that up to folks getting worn out on terror. Being exposed to so much constant horror related content that they need to  keep raising the stakes to get that thrill. 

Not me though. No, unfortunately, it’s hard to be cynical when you’ve seen the overstuffed cornucopia of evil reality has to offer. 

I see it for what it is, the supernatural equivalent of animals fleeing from a forest fire. These things, these entities and little Gods , they would have been content to stay below the surface, to keep at their schemes and brutality behind the scenes. 

But, it’s started. That infinite wave that has  managed to wash away entire corners of existence. And it’s driving the things in the shadows out. 

But right now, to you thousands behind your screens, that means nothing. It won’t till you’re staring at it from five feet away. And when that time comes, all the quantum physics, reality shifting information in the world won’t mean a damn thing. 

No, what you’re going to want is some down to earth knowledge. 

Something, Quaint. 

Within the world of old Gods and new monsters we find ourselves in, I can’t think of anything  more quaint than a good, old-fashioned slasher. I’ve given you a couple tips on these kinds of guys in the past, probably the most likely thing you’ll encounter, actually. Tonight, let’s have a look at how things tend to play out when someone lacks that information. 



It’s almost a year after the incident at the church. A year of living under a fake name, making fake friends, and living a fake life. 

The thing Pockets neglected to mention ( one of many, unfortunately.) was that, while “ The universe is the best fixer out there. “, what the surviving members of that unfortunate group saw, wasn’t all that spooky. Mostly just me acting like a lunatic, and a bunch of death and destruction that could be just as easily be chalked up to a psycho late-teen. 

The place I’m in is a cabin in name only. Really, it’s a nice little house out in the middle of a forest in northern Ontario. 

Who’s house? Well, to the 20 or so young adults and late teens at the party, it doesn’t really matter. 

To me though, it does. And as I listen to the repeatedly copied cassette blaring overly aggressive rock, I try and get myself psyched for what has to happen. 

It's been a year or so of deep cover, of research, of going to a school I didn’t know, of having a very specific group of friends. Hiding who I was, even who I used to be. But tonight, it happens. 

“Earth to Ernie. “ Shaylee says, smacking me in the side of the head. 

The 5 people around me are my closest friends. The most important people in the one room dwelling right now. 

Shaylee sits in the loveseat across from me, as always, her arms and hands are covered. Her ruddy skin and blond hair at odds with the dark foreboding aesthetic she’s trying to convey. 

Beside her is Toby, huge guy, he says he’s six three, but really, we are looking at closer to seven feet. He wears a polo shirt he’s sure will get him laid, and due to being built like a lumberjack, has never been asked for I. D. In dozens of beer runs. 


Viktor and Vincent, two twins trying their best ( and failing) to disguise that fact. Vincent wears a full studded leather jacket, despite the fire roaring nearby, his brother a dress shirt that seems more suited for thanksgiving with family, than the alcohol fueled rager we find ourselves in. 

Sitting beside me, is my best friend, Symon. He’s tall, lanky, and pale. He unintentionally pulls off in jeans and a yellow “Have a nice day “ shirt, what Shaylee barely accomplishes with Tim burton Esque clothing and a couple hours of makeup. 

“Sorry, just stressing about the physics project. “ I apologize, draining half a beer as a gesture of contrition. 

“No worries. “ Viktor says, tilting a can at me, finishing it, and tossing it haphazardly behind him. 

It’s a little after ten, I swear I can hear every tick of the oak grandfather clock near the front door. 

The night in the church, I thought that would be my initiation into whatever the hell Pockets does. But it barely got my foot in the door. 

Tonight though, tonight is how I show “The Bosses”  I have what it takes. 

“Okay, so, who wants to see a card trick? “ I say, I smile, actually, I grin. I don’t feel it though, what I need to do here, it’s going to be rough. I wish there was another way. 

Symon nods eagerly, the rest look a bit curious. 

I reach into my backpack, and pull out a deck of cards. I break the plastic wrap and begin to shuffle. 

I pass each person a card, it takes me no effort to make sure they all get the right ones.  

After a handful of seconds I tell them to look at their cards but not to show anyone. 

“You guys know what a soldier’s deck is? 

It’s a special deck of cards with important information on them. Usually people, sometimes places or vehicles. 

The military does this so recognising the things on them becomes second nature. Everyone loves cards. “ I say. 

The looks I get are confused, the response I get, is angry.  Except Symon, he seems, hurt. 

“What’s this? “ Toby says, throwing his card aside. 

My stomach churns, my pulse races, I feel like shit for what I’m doing. But I can’t show it. 

“It’s what it says on the fucking tin Toby. 

I know about all of you, that’s why I came to this shitty little town. 

Things are going to get really dangerous here, very soon, I suggest listening to me. “ I feel the tension in the air thicken as I talk. 

“Are you okay Ernie? Seriously, did you take something? “ Shaylee starts. 

I turn to her, starting to feel the pressure. I don’t have time to convince anyone. 

“Take off your gloves then. Before you say another word about it, take off the gloves. “ I challenge. 

Vincent starts to talk, Toby cuts him off. 

The massive guy’s voice has changed, it’s deeper now, strangely resonant. He’s the first to understand. 

“This a threat? “ he says simply. 

“Think of it however you want.  I’d say this is me asking some friends of mine for a favor. 

I’m not here to hurt you, or your families. “ I say, hoping the implication shakes them, “  Who I’m after will be showing up in about, 45 minutes or so. 

Now, him, he will want to kill the whole, rotten lot of you. Supernatural pups or not. 

Ironic,  considering the guy is cursed himself, but I don’t think I need to tell you how unstable those ‘monster hunter’ types are. Especially one who’s saddled with a real case of self hatred after a century or so of immortality. “ My friends understand what I’m saying, clearly they don’t like that I do . 

“So, this was all, a set up? “ Symon asks. 

I sigh, taking in a large breath. 

“You want me to feel bad? 

Sy, you drink God damn spinal fluid. No way around it. 

Shay, tell me, how many more years before you can’t go out in public anymore? How many years before you have to start taking folks memories? 

Then we’ve got Toby, who, just by my calculation has a body count of a half dozen. 

Oh, and the God damn hive mind, V squared. Everyone know there’s s a couple of them in about 80 different cities? 

And I’m supposed to feel like I’m taking a heel turn? “ My rant is supposed to be dismissive, but it comes across as defensive instead. 

“Things are more complicated than that Ernie. “ Symon pleads. 

I wave a hand dismissively. 

“ Not interested. 

The guy showing up, he’s had a lot of things thrown at him. But not what all of you have. 

Maybe you guys do nothing and end up splattered. Maybe it’s a cakewalk. 

Not my issue. 

What would be my issue is if you try and leave. At that point, what I said earlier, about families, no longer applies. 

And by the way, my name’s Andrew. “ After hearing my plan out loud,  saying it makes me feel, wrong. 

But it’s the only way I could think of, the only way I could show I have what it takes. And there’s no backing out at this point. 

“Anyone seen Chuck? “ a short, round guy of about 18 is yelling loudly to various people and cliques. 

The lights flicker for a moment. No one seems to pay it much mind, other than our group. 

The knock cuts through rowdy party goers, blaring music, and  thick, awkward tension between my friends and I. To this day I can remember the exact sound, the starting pistol for this race to hell. 

I recognise the dark haired girl that opens the door, but feel bad I can’t remember her name. 

Something falls into the cabin as the door opens, at first the girl doesn’t react, trying to figure out exactly what she’s looking at. 

Once she realises the two large, dripping pieces are a body, she begins to scream. 

Chuck has been seemingly torn in half, and beaten well beyond the point of recognition. The only indication as to who this may have been is the gore soaked, half shredded Ramones shirt he was wearing. 

The reaction spreads like wildfire, within a minute or so, the cabin is chaos. 

“Not even any orders ‘Andy’? “ Toby says, venom and rage dripping from his tone. 

“Motherfucker, you’re an ogre. Figure shit out. “ I say as the lights flicker again, then cut out. 

Toby’s eyes glow a dim blue in the darkness. I feel a sense of fear and dread as I realise the kinds of forces I’m screwing around with here. 

People rush to the door, someone slips on the blood slick hardwood floor. In the darkness people begin to crowd, fall and block the exit. 

I heard the window open a couple seconds after the lights went out. The things I’ve wrangled here stand, each seeing clearly in the gloom. Their gaze, on me. 

The music starts, jarringly, the lights turn back on. There’s no sign of whoever is attacking, but plenty of evidence of their handiwork. 

Three more bodies, killed feet from the milling crowd, without so much as a yelp of pain. 

Long thin knives are driven through their chests, they sit in a triangle formation in the centre of the room. A note written on yellowed, ancient paper, has a statement, scrawled in thick, black ink. 

“I’m owed 5 demons. “ It says simply. 

Me and my unlucky companions understand, the note just ads to the fear and confusion of the other partygoers. 

You know how the next few minutes go. Cut phone lines, disabled cars, folks catching fleeting glimpses of a massive bearded man in a dark green suit. 

“You’re a sick piece of shit Andy. “ Shaylee says as she begins to walk outside, motioning for Toby and the rest to follow. 

“I didn’t set this up. “ I say, finding myself following her, “This was going to happen either way, I’m just trying to throw enough stuff at this guy to stop him. “ 

The mask is starting to slip. This edge-lord killer vibe I’m trying to cultivate, it’s not convincing them, and  to put a point on things, it’s not convincing me either. 

“Why didn’t you say so? Everyone, let’s give the man of the fuckin’ hour a hand. “ Toby says, as the six of us make it to the treeline. 

I should be bunkered in the cabin, waiting for these things to throw themselves against the Slasher, but instead, I’m here. Pleading my case. 

What can I say, I was 18. 

“There” I say, catching him a few dozen feet into the forest. 

St. Patrick. 

Of course, not the Saint Patrick, no, this guy, about 150 years or so ago was a monster hunter. Took to styling himself after the original though. 

Something happened along the way, the story varies a bit, sometimes it’s a deal with an entity, sometimes it’s a piece of cursed kit. But either way, he became, something else. Stalking the world, going scorched earth rooting out ‘sin’ and ‘demons’. 

As you can guess, soon those definitions got twisted, and stretched, until the man was no different than the things he hunted. 

He watches us, calmly, I stand away from the group of creatures of the night I’ve corralled. They talk among themselves, I hear anger, but I hear a lot more fear. 

It wasn’t supposed to be like this. I brought a backpack full of ‘fuck you’ in case the entities didn’t want to cooperate. I expected resistance, I expected violence that would have to be met with it’s equal. 

These kids were supposed to be wild animals, young, sure, but  still, the things legends are made from. 

I fucked up. 

I can see it in Shaylee’s tears,   Toby’s trembling ,  Symon’s hurt looks toward me,  and the twin’s silent conversation . 

It’s a shitty feeling realizing you’re wrong, infinitely moreso when lives are on the line. The thing shedding blood and staring at us, it’s just a hazard. What I’ve done is a combination of stupid, reckless and cruel that can’t be justified, it’s not right. 

I’m not that guy. Thought I was, or at least wanted to be. But as I stand here in the midst of my handiwork, I understand I have to try and stop this. 

Make, things right. 

I begin to run toward the Slasher, the entities, still actually try yelling at me to stop. My heart fucking sinks. 

The dead eyed killer looks curious, standing perfectly still he makes no move to hurt me. 

I stand in front of him, and while he’s not as wide, or tall as Toby, I feel miniscule next to the revenant. 

“You have to have some good left inside you. “ I start, “You wanted to protect people so much, you were willing to do… this, to yourself. “

The thing laughs, a dry, wheezing, mocking chuckle. 

“Why? After a God Damned century, why? “ I scream, daring to make eye contact. 

Slowly the thing raises a finger, pointing to it’s lips. 

I see the frayed green and silver thread, the worn, suture holes, and the crude cross stitches holding his mouth shut. 

I don’t see the limb that strikes me hard enough to dislocate my shoulder, and launch me, tumbling along the ground to slam into Toby’s leg. 

“What the hell do you think he is, an Anne Rice Character? “ Toby says, “ Holy shit Andy, I can’t tell if you’re a worse monster hunter or human being. “

Toby begins to walk toward the Slasher. The young not-quite-man begins to warp and change. 

Bones crack, flesh begins to swell and gain mass. Toby starts to scream, not a battle cry, but a wail of pain that echoes through the forest. 

Toby stands before the killer, an asymmetrical mass of muscle, bone spurs, and torn clothing. Tears pour down his eyes, saliva pours from his wailing maw. 

Symon offers a hand, I take it, not able to look him in the eye. Fear and shame stripping away any delusion I had of being some kind of badass. 

The real badass stands in front of the force of nature stalking us. 

The hunter shrugs off a civil war style gunny sack, he rolls his neck, massive, dry tendons creak and pop. He holds his hands out to either side, inviting toby to do his worst. 

The nearly ten foot ogre throws lopsided, looping blows that fell trees before they land. The first handful do nothing, the hunter laughs softy, barely reacting. 

The thunderous noise causes the partygoers to begin to filter out of the cabin. 

“Get back inside! “ I try to scream, but the sounds of conflict drown me out. 

Toby’s cries of pain get worse as his body deforms further, blood pours as bone plates and new muscle groups form. 

A blow from a fused, almost mace-like hand makes the Slasher wince, the next, manages to tear a long, shallow furrow out of its impossibly thick skin. With bleating, childlike sobs Toby keeps up the assault, the blows now forcing Patrick to defend himself. 

The hope, the feeling of a light at the end of the tunnel is palpable. 

Knowing what I know now, all things being fair, Toby would have been able to destroy the False Saint. Slashers are great at appearing invincible but at the end of they day enough bad things happening to enough important parts, and they die like anything else. 

But the world isn’t a fair place, or, the good die young. 

Take your pick. 

The Slasher is on the ground, Toby raining down brutal, graceless strikes that drive the body of the turned hero into the ground inch by inch. 

Toby begins to spasm, a wave of pain overtaking him. He’s to young to control what’s happening. 

The hunter snakes a hand to his bag, pulling out a small bottle. 

I’d tell you what was in it, in case you ever find yourself face to face with an ogre. But to the best of my knowledge the last two died sometime in 2020. 

Before Toby can get his senses back the killer smashes the bottle into the ogre’s face. 

I’ve seen a lot of friends die in my life, what happened to Toby when that liquid hit him is one of two memories I’ve had expunged. 

As our savior dies our hope is dashed like an egg on cement. No one has to tell anyone to run, we just do. 

The crowd at the door stand frozen, we scream at them to go inside, but they simply stand stunned at the display of violence, and wrong they just witnessed. 

In the business we call it’ Hell Shock’ grim pun, I know, but accurate. The human mind can handle wrong in small doses. A couple fleeting glimpses of spirits in a haunted forest, no problem. But seeing two physics defying creatures collide at the scene of a paranormal mass murder, that throws some soda on the ol’ circuit boards. 

What most people hear is a tinny whistling noise, Viktor and Vincent however, stop running mid stride, clutching their ears and falling to the ground. 

I look back, and see Patrick stalking toward them, he swings a flat white object in quick circles on the end of  a piece of rough twine. It emits the sound disabling the twins. 

Symon pulls me forward, breaking my fear induced daze. 

Most of the partygoers have got some sense of reason back and filter inside.  Symon, Shaylee and myself start ushering in the last few enraptured people, ignoring the screams, and brutal tearing noises from behind us. 

The group is scared beyond reason, the walls between us and the Slasher feel thin as paper. Most are discussing making a break for it, I understand how badly that would go. 

Fear and cowardice lead to indecision. The false Saint doesn’t storm the place, he bides his time. Running a wickedly pointed green blade along windows, humming tunelessly as he  stalks around the cabin he lets us know he’s in control. 

Someone stands too close to a window, they’re  snatched in an instant, becoming nothing more than a trailing scream and painful memory. 

The group huddles in the centre of the cabin, tension rising, a handful crack and try to run. We hear mechanical snapping noises, and the sounds of butchery. 

My shoulder throbs, I think I may have broken a rib, and with every passing second the situation keeps sprinting further down the road to hell. 

“Andy! “ Shaylee says, getting my attention, “ We need to get them out of here. “

As bad as I feel, I laugh. 

“What about us? “ I say, my petulant tone makes me want to punch myself in the face. 

Symon looks to me, he doesn’t have to say anything. 

“We’re all fighting on different sides of a war, but they’re just civilians. “ I say. 

No one seems to disagree. 

I find my backpack, opening the heavy canvas bag with one arm isn’t happening. 

“Sy, little help? “, no sooner do I say this than Symon grabs my dislocated arm and yanks. 

I’m screaming before I hear the crunch, before the pain hits. My vision blurs, I puke a handful of chips and cheap beer. 

“I meant to open the bag! “ I scream, clutching my now in- place shoulder. 

I chuckle, a morbid little noise, but not long after  Symon does the same. After a moment or two, Shaylee begins to join in.

It's a moment, a moment brought on by knowing, in all likelihood we die here. 

The morbid chuckle turns into manic laughter. A fear fueled sick sounding thing. When it stops, Shaylee is the first to speak. 

“To answer what you asked Andy, about a year and a half.  If I’m really lucky, I’ve got 18 months or so before I start to look too screwed up to be walking around. 

Won’t even be able to legally drink before I look like I should be living in a gingerbread house somewhere. 

I can herd those people, get them away from here, but I need you two to stall that thing outside. “ 

“We’ve got nothing, you saw what it did to Toby. I have guns and knives, cheap guns and knives. If Toby couldn’t slow him down, Symon and I sure as hell can’t.  “ My voice shakes,  I hear the panic in it. 

Symon looks deep in thought. When he talks, there’s a weight to what he says I’ve never heard. 

“You picked the wrong card. 

You got Toby, Shaylee, V squared, but me, you were a little off the mark. 

Kind of hurts.

If I keep doing what I’m doing now, I don’t have to eat or drink anything weird, no physical changes, nothing. That all changes though if I hurt a person. Actually, it happens once I’ve made the decision to. “

I knew this was a possibility. Pockets, the prick refused to lend a hand while I planned this, and I couldn’t quite pin what Symon was down. 

“This guy isn’t a person… “ I begin. 

“He is, beyond the curse, in every way that matters, he’s as much of a person as you or any of those potential murder victims. 

I'll be giving up any chance of a normal life. If I’m lucky, in a decade or two, I’ll just be insane and dangerous. 

I can do this, Patrick, our friends, they’re all physical things. If I give in…  I won’t be. 

But I need a promise. Once this happens, you leave me alone. Hands off, no matter what. You pretend I don’t exist. “

It might not be a deal with the devil, but it isn’t far off. But I have no choice, I can’t let the civilians die. 

“For what it’s worth, sure. “ I reply, the decision hangs in the air like a bad smell. 

Shaylee takes off her gloves, in contrast to her youthful looks, her hands are pale, thin skinned and streaked with dark black veins. 

She walks through the crowd of confused frightened young adults and with nothing more than a subtle brush of a hand, has their attention. 

Symon stands, I smell ammonia, and turned spices. The air seems to still and stagnate. 

“I need a couple minutes. Get him in here while Shaylee gets the prey out the back. “ He says facing away from me. 

This pistol I bring feels like a toy, but I’m not expecting to hurt him with it. 

By the time I get outside he’s crouched, moving faster than should be possible toward Shaylee’s group. 

I might not have speed or strength, I might have a nerve damaged shoulder and a cracked rib, but I didn’t need any of that. My weapon, my only advantage was my ability to be an absolute prick in only the way a kid like me with a life like I’ve had can be. 

Now, I’m not going to put what I said to take Paddy’s attention from the crowd here. Back in the 80’s we thought some terrible things were okay for casual conversation. 

What I will say is that young Andy informed the twisted corpse of his opinions on it’s motives, intellect, and sexual history in enough detail that the kid wound up with an empty gun, a knife up to it’s hilt in his forearm and a rage fueled corpse dragging him by the foot into the cabin. 

I notice it instantly, before the door shuts of it’s own accord, and more importantly, before the hate blinded monster holding me does. 

The cabin is twisted, warped, a scent of industrial cleaner and fetid basement makes me gag. 

The room seems massive, the walls twisting and swaying if built on water. 

The sense of power, of evil and wrong is palpable. The type of alien cousin-of-emotion that starts cults. 

The creature drops me, I try and hold the wound in my arm shut. I’ve got no fight left in me, all I can do is watch, and hope. 

A back door opens, it seems a half kilometer away, but I hear Shaylee’s voice clear as day. 

“They should be fine where is… “ She doesn’t finish her sentence before the hunter draws a revolver that could crush the pawn shop POS I brought. 

The report is somehow muffled, but the bullet blows a fist sized hole in Shaylee’s leg. She hits the ground screaming, and starting what will be a slow death if she doesn’t get immediate medical attention. 

Before the Revenant can turn the hand cannon toward me, I hear a voice. 

Young, faint, female, “Why did you leave? “ it repeats over and over. 

The ghoul’s eyes widen, it tries to flee, but the door, flimsy, and free of so much as a deadbolt won’t budge. 

Symon walks out of a patch of shadow, a few inches or so above the ground. 

He looks different now, no eyes, just fist sized patches of unnatural darkness, his hair moves and twists as if having a mind of it’s own, his movements are like film cuts, his voice coming from everywhere and nowhere. 

“That’s right Patrick of Connell, I know everything about you now. 

I could destroy you without lifting a finger. Just drag back every mistake, every sin, every forgotten failure you’ve made. I have that reach. “ Symon smiles the grin twisting and warping his face. 

He points gently, and suddenly, the hunter seems human again. 

I think Symon must have overplayed his hand as the fallen hero sprints toward him, if anything he’s faster than before, his strides splinter wood flooring. 

He's on the lanky entity in a moment drawing knives from hidden sheaths and stabbing in a brutal frenzy. 

But Symon simply isn’t there, the hunter finds himself holding nothing more than a yellow shirt with an ironic logo. 

Symons laughter screams from every angle, but below it is another noise. 

Slowly, a chorus of dozens, if not hundreds of voices begin to plead, wail and threaten. From the shadows, faces begin to form like snowflakes, grey faces with hateful glares, and dark promises, both directed toward Patrick. 

His blows pass harmlessly through the ghostly grey forms, but as the swarm begins to pull themselves from whatever afterlife you want to believe in, their whisp-like hands hold the hunter fast. 

I watch for a moment, as they work like ants, the gibbering rising to a disorienting level. They don’t kill the hunter, but they break his arms, his legs, they make sure he’s going no where. 

I see Symon standing beside the back door as I sprint towards it. He holds up a hand as I’m twenty or so feet away. 

I can’t move. 

Symon’s voice cuts through the din. 

“Leave her. “ He says. 

“Fuck no. “ I reply. 

He stares at me, those pitch black voids giving nothing away. 

“You still don’t get it do you? 

We are not friends, we can’t be friends. 

Things like us, sooner or later, if we start hanging around the prey, it goes bad for everyone involved. 

It’s not a preference, it’s a rule of fucking nature Andy. 

There are no friendly Ghosts, no werewolf boyfriends, no hot vampire ladies looking for love. 

You have your world, we have ours, and the best of us, on any side, know it needs to be kept that way. 

Now, leave, let me be what I am. “ There is mania bordering on insanity in Symon’s sourceless tone. 

I leave, my injured, exsanguinated pace letting me hear the insane cacophony of the unreal behind me behind me for much too long. 

As Pockets and I were driving down a shitty highway to the next freak show, I asked when I’d be getting into The Organization. 

“One cluster-fuck you managed to walk away from, and you think they're getting a desk ready for you?  

The ego on you kid. 

Few years at least, but if I told you that, you’d have been expecting me to hold your hand, and I wanted to see what you're capable of. “ Was his reply. 

It was a few months before I could talk with him about anything other than work. 

Danger, that’s something I expected, but what he put me through that year. Letting me get close, letting me see those things as people, before letting the world throw it in my face that they weren’t. It showed me a side of him I’d never seen before, and I didn’t like it. 

Only forgot the lessons I learned that night once, but that’s another piece of advice, for another holiday. 

Keep safe. 

Andy
