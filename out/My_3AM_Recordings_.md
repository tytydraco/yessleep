This morning I found some audio recordings on my phone. For whatsoever reason I’ve been recording myself at night. These recordings are my own narrations of what I’ve been doing after apparently waking up at 3AM. Truth be told I can’t vividly recall any of this happening. I woke up this morning and everything seemed so normal.

Have any of you ever experienced anything like this? Is something off? I can’t wrap my head around any of this so I decided to write down what I found.

 

**20/09/2024** 

 

*It’s 3AM.* 

*Woke up from a bad dream.* 

*Can’t exactly recall what it was about, but it feels like I had that exact same dream before.*

*Only three more hours before my alarm goes off.* 

*God I hope that I will never ever have to experience that dream again.* 

*Have to calm my nerves and get back to sleep.* 

*I’ll go downstairs to have a glass of water.* 

*I’m in my pitch black room and all is quiet except for the occasional creaking sound of the roof.* 

*Found the lights.* 

*Going down the stairs.* 

*There’s a painting on the wall.* 

*Haven’t looked at it in ages.* 

*It’s a painting of the ocean.* 

*No wonder I haven’t looked at it in a long time.* 

*Entering my living room.* 

*Father’s asleep on the couch.* 

*He’s fast asleep.*

*Television’s on.*

*It’s showing footage from the eye of a cyclone.* 

*I go to my kitchen and pour myself a glass of water.* 

*Radio in the kitchen’s off, all is quiet.* 

*Television’s still on and still showing footage from the eye of a cyclone.* 

*Time to go back upstairs and get some sleep.* 

*Only three more hours before the alarm goes off.* 

*Going up the stairs again.* 

*Open the door to the left.* 

*Wrong room, it’s my brother’s.* 

*Brother’s not living at home anymore, but the room still looks the same.* 

*Hanging from the wall there’s a few pictures of exotic locations and a painting of a forest.* 

*He always had a thing for nature.* 

*Entering my own room now.* 

*A cartoon’s playing on my TV.* 

*Can’t remember leaving on the TV in my room.* 

*It’s an old kid’s cartoon.* 

*Can’t remember ever having seen that cartoon.*

*Switching off the TV and the lights.*

*I’m alone in my bed and there’s nobody else with me.* 

*Only three more hours before my alarm goes off.* 

*I hope the night will soon be over.* 

 

**21/09/2024**

 

*It’s 3AM.* 

*A yelling voice inside my head woke me up from a bad dream.* 

*Can’t exactly recall what it was about, but it feels like I had that exact same dream before.*

*Only three more hours before my alarm goes off.* 

*God I hope that I will never ever have to experience that dream again.* 

*Have to calm my nerves and get back to sleep.* 

*I’ll go downstairs to have a glass of water.* 

*I’m in my pitch black room and all is quiet except for a wheezing sound coming from the room next to me.* 

*Found the lights.* 

*Going down the stairs.* 

*There’s a painting on the wall.* 

*Haven’t looked at it in ages.* 

*It’s a painting of the ocean with a hand coming out of the water.* 

*Wonder how I never noticed that.* 

*Entering my living room.* 

*Father’s asleep on the couch.* 

*It looks like he’s staring at me.*

*Television’s on.*

*It’s showing footage from the eye of a cyclone.* 

*I go to my kitchen and pour myself a glass of water.* 

*Radio in the kitchen’s on, station’s playing some weird chanting gibberish.* 

*Television’s still on and it’s showing footage of a field.* 

*Time to go back upstairs and get some sleep.* 

*Only three more hours before the alarm goes off.* 

*Going up the stairs again.* 

*Open the door to the left.* 

*Wrong room, it’s my brother’s.* 

*Brother’s not living at home anymore, but the room still looks the same.* 

*Hanging from the wall there’s a few pictures of a few uncanny faces and a painting of a forest.* 

*He always had a thing for the weird.* 

*Entering my own room now.* 

*A cartoon’s playing on my TV.* 

*Can’t remember leaving on the TV in my room.* 

*It’s a rather disturbing old cartoon.* 

*Can’t remember old cartoons every being this disturbing.* 

*Switching off the TV and the lights.*  

*I’m alone in my bed and I think there’s somebody else standing at the doorway.* 

*Only three more hours before my alarm goes off.* 

*I hope the night will soon be over.* 

 

**22/09/2024**

 

*It’s 3AM.* 

*A terrifying screaming voice inside my head woke me up from a dream.* 

*Can’t exactly recall what it was about, but it feels like I had that exact same dream before.*

*Only three more hours before my alarm goes off.* 

*God I hope that I ever will be able to experience that dream again.* 

*Have to turn down my excitement and get back to sleep.* 

*I’ll go downstairs to have a glass of blood.* 

*I’m in my pitch black room and all is quiet except for a moaning sound coming from the room next to me.* 

*Found the lights.* 

*Going down the stairs.* 

*There’s a painting on the wall.* 

*Haven’t looked at it in ages.* 

*It’s a painting of a dead bloated corpse with open eyes drifting beneath the surface of the ocean.* 

*Wonder how I never noticed that.* 

*Entering my living room.* 

*A pile of dismembered limbs, organs and an eviscerated human torso is placed on the couch.* 

*A degloved skull is staring at me.*

*Television’s on.*

*It’s showing footage of a dead horse lying in a field.* 

*I go to my kitchen and pour myself a glass of bone marrow.* 

*Radio in the kitchen’s on, station’s playing some cacophonous noise of barking dogs.* 

*Television’s still on and it shows a man crawling out of a dead horse’s opened abdomen.* 

*Time to go back upstairs and get some sleep.* 

*Only three more hours before the alarm goes off.* 

*Going up the stairs again.* 

*Open the door to the left.* 

*Wrong room, it’s my brother’s.* 

*Brother’s not living at home anymore, but the room still looks the same.* 

*Hanging from the wall there’s a few pictures of atrocities being committed during multiple wars and a painting of a man standing in the middle of a forest.* 

*He always had a fascination for the morbid.* 

*Go into my own room now.* 

*My TV’s switching channels between multiple cartoons.* 

*Can’t remember leaving on the TV in my room.* 

*They’re all rather disturbing old cartoons.* 

*Can’t remember old cartoons ever featuring this amount of slaughter.* 

*Switching off the TV and the lights.* 

*I’m alone in my bed and there’s somebody else with me in my room.* 

*Only three more hours before my alarm goes off.* 

*I hope the night will last forever.*
