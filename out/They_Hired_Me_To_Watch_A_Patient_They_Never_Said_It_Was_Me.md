I thought I was interning for a top-secret government psychology program. Now I’m not sure if I ever left the hospital.

I don’t know how much time I’ve spent in this facility. The clocks don’t move here — or maybe they do, but every time I look at one, the second hand is exactly where I remember it last.

They told me I was brought here on a government fellowship — a research internship for psychology graduates. “Behavioral Observation,” the letter said. Paid housing, secure clearance, and direct work with a classified subject.

At the time, I thought I’d hit the jackpot.

Now I can’t tell if I’m still working here… or being kept here.


The first day felt almost cinematic. A man in a dark coat met me at the train station, no name tag, just a badge with the U.S. crest and an ID number. He said he worked for “Division E.” When I asked what that was, he said, “Exactly.”

We drove for hours into the woods until the signal on my phone died. The facility looked like a hospital that didn’t want to admit it was one — white walls, endless corridors, security cameras in every corner.

The doctor who greeted me — Dr. Halvorsen — was pale and polite, but there was something rehearsed in his tone.

“You’ll be monitoring Subject 63-B,” he said. “You’re here to observe, record, and report behavioral anomalies. You are not to speak with the subject.”

“Anomalies?” I asked.

He smiled faintly. “You’ll understand soon.”



They took me to a narrow room with glass on one side — like a one-way mirror. On the other side sat the “subject.”

A man, maybe mid-20s. Plain hospital clothes. Staring blankly at the wall.

There was something familiar about him that I couldn’t place. Not a memory exactly — more like déjà vu, that itch you get in your brain when something feels almost remembered.

Every few minutes he’d twitch slightly, like his mind had tripped over something. His reflection in the glass didn’t always match his movement perfectly, but I blamed the lighting.

I sat there for eight hours, taking notes. He never said a word.

That night, I dreamed I was sitting in the same chair, but from his side of the glass.



Over the next few days, I kept noticing strange details.

Every door in the facility required a keycard swipe — except the observation wing. The lock lights there were always green, as if someone had permanently authorized entry.

My ID badge didn’t have my photo on it. Just INTERN – TEMP CLEARANCE.

And the subject, 63-B, kept looking at the mirror. Not randomly — directly at me.

I thought it was a coincidence until the fourth day. I shifted my chair back to stretch, and at that exact moment, he tilted his head, mimicking the movement perfectly.

It wasn’t delayed. It was simultaneous.

I reported it to Dr. Halvorsen.

He wrote something down and asked, “Do you think the subject might be mirroring you?”

“Yes,” I said. “Almost like he can see me.”

Halvorsen smiled politely. “He can’t. It’s one-way glass.”

Then he leaned forward slightly and added, “Unless, of course, you’re on the wrong side of it.”

He laughed softly. I didn’t.



That night, I woke up to the sound of someone whispering in the hallway outside my room. The lights were dim, and the voices were muffled, but I caught bits of conversation:

> “…still believes he’s staff…”
“…loop reset if he starts remembering…”
“…we’ll try the mirror test again tomorrow.”



When I stepped into the hallway, it was empty.

I told myself I was just overtired. But I couldn’t sleep again after that.



Day seven, I found something odd in the observation notes binder.

It wasn’t my handwriting, but the style looked like mine — same slanted letters, same messy loops.
The log was dated April 14.
That would’ve been fine… if it weren’t March.

The entry read:

> “Subject 63-B displayed repetitive memory fragment. Claims to be ‘an intern psychologist’ brought in for observation work. Possible identity delusion triggered by mirror conditioning.”



Underneath that, someone had scribbled: “Erase cycle — retain baseline personality.”

I flipped through more pages. Every week had an entry describing the subject regaining parts of his memory, followed by “reset successful.”

The problem was — every description matched me.



I went to confront Dr. Halvorsen. He wasn’t in his office. No one was.
The lab corridors were deserted, every light buzzing faintly.

I finally found him in the observation room, standing exactly where I usually sit, staring through the glass.

At first, I thought he was watching Subject 63-B.

Then I realized the other side of the glass was empty.

“Where’s the patient?” I asked.

He turned slowly toward me. “Which one?”

I felt something cold crawl down my spine.

“You said I was assigned to monitor him.”

Halvorsen studied me for a moment. “And you’ve done well. But we’ve noticed… contamination.”

“What contamination?”

He didn’t answer — just motioned toward the glass.

I stepped forward.

And saw my own reflection blink… half a second too late.



The next thing I remember, I was in my room with restraints on my wrists. The air smelled of alcohol wipes and static.

Dr. Halvorsen was sitting beside the bed, holding a clipboard.

“You had a break,” he said softly. “You wandered into restricted areas. Do you remember that?”

I tried to speak, but my throat was dry. “Where’s Subject 63-B?”

He smiled faintly. “You are, Daniel.”

My heart stopped. “What?”

“You’ve been here for fourteen months. You’re part of a behavioral conditioning experiment. The intern identity was introduced to measure cognitive resistance.”

“That’s not true,” I said. “You hired me. You sent me letters, contracts—”

“We did. And we’ll do it again, once the reset completes.”

He stood up, adjusted something on a monitor, and said, “You’ve reached awareness before, but it never lasts. Don’t worry. This time we’ll record everything.”

He walked out before I could reply.



I stayed restrained for what felt like days. They injected something every few hours — not enough to knock me out, but enough to blur everything.

Every time I started to drift, I’d hear faint voices through the walls, overlapping like a broken recording:

> “Loop initiated.”
“Intern simulation protocol.”
“Subject stable.”



Sometimes I saw flashes — bright rooms, people in white coats, myself screaming into a mirror.

And sometimes, I saw that same one-way glass again, except I was on both sides.

Watching.
And being watched.



Eventually, they removed the restraints. Halvorsen came in smiling, holding a clipboard again.

“How are we feeling today, Daniel?”

“Fine,” I said. I’d learned not to resist.

“Good. Let’s begin again.”

He motioned toward the door, and two guards escorted me down the corridor.

They opened a door — my observation room.

Except now, on the other side of the glass, there was someone sitting in the chair.

A man in plain hospital clothes. Early twenties. Pale. Blank expression.

He looked exactly like me.

Halvorsen placed a notepad in my hands. “Observe him carefully. Record everything you notice. Do not attempt to communicate.”

I wanted to scream. But I didn’t.

I just sat down and started taking notes.

Because somehow… it felt familiar.



Over the following days, I noticed patterns — the subject would twitch when I did, shift when I did, blink slightly off-time.

I asked Halvorsen once why his movements matched mine so closely.

He smiled. “That’s the point. You’re observing cognitive mirroring. He’s learning from you.”

But one night, when I leaned forward, he leaned forward first.

I froze.

He mouthed something through the glass.

I couldn’t hear it clearly, but it looked like: “Wake up.”



That night, I dreamt of my old apartment — the one I left when I got this job.
There were moving boxes still unpacked, my coffee mug on the counter.
I looked out the window — same city skyline, same morning fog.

Then the lights flickered, and suddenly the reflection in the window wasn’t mine.

It was the man from the other side of the glass, staring back at me.

I woke up screaming.

Halvorsen and two guards rushed in. “He’s fragmenting again,” the doctor said. “Administer the sedative.”

As they pinned me down, I managed to shout, “I’m not the subject! I’m the intern!”

Halvorsen leaned close, expression calm. “And that’s exactly what he said last cycle.”



I don’t remember blacking out. But when I woke up again, I was in a different room.
No restraints. Just a desk, a chair, a mirror.

A speaker on the wall crackled.

“Welcome back, Daniel. Observation phase starting now.”

I stood up, approached the mirror — and realized it wasn’t reflecting my movements.

The person on the other side stared at me, confused, terrified.
He looked just like me, but his ID badge said: INTERN – TEMP CLEARANCE.

He mouthed something I couldn’t hear. Then his expression changed — realization, horror.

He mouthed it again, slower this time.

“They hired me to watch a patient. They never said it was me.”

The intercom buzzed softly behind me.

Halvorsen’s voice, calm and professional:

> “Excellent. Recognition achieved. Begin next cycle.”



The lights flickered.
The second hand on the clock froze.
