I’ve been looking at an old photo of my friends and I for a while now. 

  
It fell out from a volume of Hellblazer that's seen much better days. That comic itself has been collecting dust in the back of my cupboard for years now. It only ever saw the light of day again now with it coming out in move. It happened rather quickly, me moving out of my Dad’s and into my own place. I won’t go into it here, but it had to happen. The quick move left me throwing most of my stuff into boxes without much regard for what it was. I just knew that I didn’t want to go back so left nothing to return to. That’s how an old comic I haven't even thought about in years ended up in my new house, and the photo inside of it.

  
It was a photo of me and my friends. A photo of me and my friends from about nine years ago back when those were my friends. They were the kind of friends you have at ten years old: whoever lived closest. Looking back, I’m not sure we ever really got on. We even came up with a game that was pretty much just an excuse to fight each other in a park, copying wrestling moves we had seen on the television to see how much they really hurt – a lot. But at the time there was nothing else we wanted to do than get out of our houses and find any excuse not to go home. That’s where the photo was taken, at the park in our estate, early on a Saturday morning.

  
We all lived further out than the park, which itself was surrounded by some abandoned houses, their windows boarded up with those metal sheets with holes in them just big enough to see through. The park was small, with just a couple swings and a bit of AstroTurf grass that looked like it used to hold some climbing frames long yanked out. We weren’t sure why those were the houses that got abandoned, when they seemed pretty similar to the rest of the council builds around us. It was exactly the same as my house only a couple streets away. One of my friends, Billy,  used to make up all sorts of different stories about what happened to them: built on a sinkhole, home to termites, and most credibly, they were just really susceptible to damp and mold.

  
They certainly smelled of it. That throat catching smell used to waft over the park whenever the wind caught them. If I think about it too much about it I can still taste it at the back of my throat.   
Despite that, it was still the best place to hang about back then. The underpass by my house was full of people smoking and hiding from the rain; a pastime we’d discover in the coming years but currently wasn't that interesting. And the football pitch at the other side of the estate was the hang out of a group of people we never mocked too loudly. 

  
The park was the perfect place to sit and get bored. Billy was the perfect friend to have around when you were bored. It was him that came up with most of the “games” we played, but most importantly, he was always coming up with different stories about our estate.

  
He got the nickname “Grim” at school. One of the characters from a cartoon that was on at the time was called Billy, (Grim adventures of Billy and Mandy), and with him being tall and lanky it was a quick connection. To be fair to him he turned it around to the idea that he was called that for always telling sick stories. It was such a good turn that we almost actually believed it. 

  
It was him, Amy and myself in the park the day the photo was taken. On Amy’s camera that she got  for Christmas. It was a Kodak film camera so we only had a few shots at it. The first had messed up when the camera fell, so we hoped that the second had turned out OK.

   
Luckily, it did. The three of us making stupid poses lined up in front of the row of abandoned houses actually looks somewhat thought out composition wise. We were sitting around admiring it when Billy started telling his story. The story about the grey man. The story seemed to come from nowhere, Billy suddenly finding this burst of motivation to start speaking.

  
As he told it, the Grey man was an older guy, around fifty or so, who would watch people on the street. Amy and I laughed at him. An old man watching you was a bit weird but we’ve defiantly seen weirder. The week prior I had saw a guy arguing with his dog outside of the corner shop.

  
But Billy persisted. That’s probably why I still remember what he supposedly looked like to this day; the detail that he went into was a lot, even for Billy. He said that he had seen him everywhere he went recently. He was a few blocks down from the bus stop, beside the corner shop fence and standing alone in the field next to our school. He was always there, standing, never following, but always watching. Whenever he tried to get a better look at him he would always be gone by the time he got to where he stood. Whenever he broke eye contact the grey man would find the opportunity to slip away. Then Billy would be standing, alone, wondering were he went. 

  
I remember the breeze that came when he told us. A shiver ran down my spine as Amy and I looked around us. The empty windows of buildings stared back. Amy tried to laugh it off, telling Billy that he had got us for the first time in a long while. But Billy didn’t stop there. 

  
Looking at the photo now, Billy looked pretty pale that day. The sun was strong but Amy and I looked fine. I never released it at the time, but something was up. For all the years since I was pretty sure he used to just tell us these stories as a way of getting stuff out he didn’t want to say. Like I said, friends at that age are people you live by, not always people you want to talk to. I never met his parents and he never talked about them. Instead he just told stories.

  
He told us that day that he had seen the grey man this morning. Before there had always been others around, he said he could've convinced himself that he had been waiting for someone else. But not that morning. 

  
He was alone in his house when the grey man arrived. Outside his bedroom window he stood, a fence separating them, with his face pressed harshly against it. With him closer than ever before, Billy was finally able to get a good look at him.

  
He wore an old coat that looked as if it had been gnawed in places, a look that covered the rest of him. His face was patchy, with sores that seemed to have healed and festered all over again. His skin was grey. Darker than any person should be able to be.

  
That’s why he got us out so early he said. To get out of the house. He sneaked out the front door and ran as fast as he could. He thought that if he looked over his shoulder he’d see him standing right there, with an arm to reach out and grab him.

  
I tried to break the tension by laughing. I hadn't had to do that in a while.  But Bill wasn't having it. Instead he just said three words: “He’s found me.”

  
Amy scoffed and walked off and I turned to call her back. But in doing so, I followed Billy’s eyeline and saw where he was looking: into the dark windows of one of the abandoned houses behind us. I was sure, mostly sure, that Billy was just messing us around, but then why couldn’t I get rid of the goosebumps on my arms?

  
When Amy made it over to us the pit of my stomach was aching. It really did feel as if we were being watched that day. Not that I really knew how that felt I guess, but something inside the back of my skull sensed it. 

  
Billy stood up and stared us down, telling us that if we thought it was so funny then we would surely be happy to meet the grey man ourselves? 

  
Amy called him a creep, but Billy didn’t react. Usually it only took one of them to start for them both to be shouting at each other. 

  
Instead, he simply pointed his hand at the closest house, the one with the crumbling front wall, and told us to go have a look for ourselves.

  
We had looked inside the buildings before, plenty of graffiti, needles and moss, but had never actually went inside. An unspoken rule we seemed too scared to break until now.

  
Maybe she was just annoyed with Billy, or maybe I was being jumpy, but Amy disregarded any feelings of concern and pushed passed us both, marching straight up to the door. 

  
I stood back, eyes darting between my friends. Billy’s look was unreadable. His eyes looked tired. Amy had just passed the overgrown front garden, the brown grass passing by knee height. 

  
“You’re just messing us about, right?” I asked Billy, but he never answered. He just kept looking ahead, past Amy and at the house. 

  
She was in its shadow, the sun had dipped low and it was getting colder. It was no longer just my worry that was causing goosebumps. “Hey guys, lets get going!” I wanted to call, but didn’t. I didn’t want to make a sound.

  
Amy tired the front door. It swung open into a pitch black hallway. 

  
I wanted to take a step forward, I wanted to tell Amy to get back and I wanted Billy to stop messing us around, but I couldn’t move. I just stared at my feet and the long shadows that trailed in front of us. But with Amy at the door, why was there three shadows?

  
I screamed. Not a shout but a scream. I remember that vividly. That’s when the shadow reached out out a hand toward me. 

  
Billy must've heard me scream because the next thing I knew we were both hopping the nearest fence together and running off across the field, breathing hard despite having barely started.

  
It was only seconds into our ran that I felt something at my back. Something was behind us. I heard footsteps, heavy footsteps, just behind us. I ran as hard as I could, putting everything I could into just making it across the field to somewhere with people, not the darkening field we had trapped ourselves in.

  
But Billy said that I imagined the sounds. Later, when we were both hiding at the back of the bin sheds, trying to breathe through our mouths to not smell the mix of rotting food and our own sweat, he told me that he had seen who it was. And it wasn't the grey man. Apparently, some guy walking his dog must've seen us trying to get into the house and came over to give us a telling off. That's when I screamed and sent us all running. I tried to lie and say I never screamed but he didn’t believed me. He heard me.

  
Regardless of how much braver than me Billy said he was, he still ran. And he stayed with me in that bin shed until long after the street lights came on, terrified that some neighbour had called the police and they’d be lying in wait of us. That’s when I knew we had to make a move. Our hiding spot was directly below a street lamp, so it had turned from a bunker to a podium with its very own spotlight. 

  
It sounds silly writing it down, but I was genuinely terrified of being brought back to mine by the police over breaking into that house. Being an accessory to it anyway. Billy must've felt the same because he was still sweating hours later, and keeping a much more fastidious lookout than I did  through the slits of the bin shed. 

  
“Come on man,” I said. “We need to go home or our Dad’s will definitely know something’s up.” 

  
But Billy wouldn't move. He just told me to go ahead if I wanted. I didn’t. If we went together it’d be OK, but despite it only being a story I didn’t want to walk back in front of those houses. It was that or an extra twenty minute detour that would absolutely get me questioned when I got home. And I was always terrible at lying. 

  
With very little choice, I told Billy I’d see him soon, and took off. 

  
I peered over my shoulder as I turned the corner and saw him still there, staring at me through the bike shed, hair gone white from the street light shinning down on top of him.   
That was the last time I ever saw Billy.   
On the walk home I really started to regret not bringing a jacket. I never expected to out so late. The sweat from the run was mostly dry but my hair was still damp, making me very aware of every small gust of wind.

  
The streets were quiet. It almost seemed as if everyone had vanished. A thought I might've believed if not for the occasional sound of a loud television through a window or a distant dog bark. 

  
I picked up the pace as I approached the park and kept my head low, thinking that if I never looked at the houses it it would be like they were never there. 

  
It almost worked. I had made it to the exit gate of  park when I heard the creek. I’m not sure why I turned round. Maybe I was just so tired from running, or something had reached out from behind me, compelling me to look.

  
The house was exactly how we left it. Only now its shadows were complete black holes. That included the shadow of its open door. The door creaked inward, revealing the unseeable rest of the house. 

  
I turned my back to it, before I could see anything crawling out of that black pit and before it could see me. 

  
I used what little energy I had left to run the last few streets to my house. I never saw anyone else for the entire run. But that was probably due to me being so determined to get home I never once looked anywhere but straight ahead. I just ploughed straight home and into my room. 

  
I hid under my covers that night like a little kid. Even with my widow closed I could still hear the night. Every little breeze sounded like a voice calling to me and every fox rustling through the hedges was the grey man coming to get me. 

  
But nothing ever did. Thankfully, no grey man every got a hold of me.

  
We were off from school on a break at the time, so I didn’t have to go back for another week. In my head, that time was the perfect opportunity to “let the heat die down”. So I spent it mostly in my bedroom, playing on my PS2 and reading comics. I tucked the photo we had taken into one of my comics and soon forgot about it. I must've pocketed it in the excitement. It was a pretty good week from what I remember. Everything a kid my age could ask for. There was a small incident that I had forgotten about until writing this however.

  
One morning, I heard my Dad’s voice outside. Peering through the curtains I saw that he was talking to a police officer. I instantly hid, sure that they had tracked me down. But nothing ever came of it. I never asked my Dad and he ever told. I think at the time I thought we were having arguments with our neighbour to the right. My Dad had always hated him and they’d came close to a fight more than once.

  
With that in mind, it didn’t seem that strange to me when we moved so soon after. I never even got to go back to school. 

  
It didn't seem weird, that was, until I found that photo.  It fell out from that comic, relighting all these memories of being a kid. But once I got a proper look at it I knew I had to phone my Dad straight away.

  
Amy, Billy and I were lined up in the middle of the park, each pulling a different stupid expression for the camera. Behind us the row of houses looked on. And in the window of a very specific house, there appeared to be a dark shape looming.   
I wasn't even sure what I was going to say to my Dad, but the rumbling in my gut made me want some connection to those times, for him to tell me to get a grip like he usually did when I was being stupid.

  
He was surprised when he picked up the phone, not expecting a call fro me so early, but his initial confrontational tone changed when he heard me talking about that day in the park. It was what he said next that made me write this post. I had to get everything down, just to get the events through my head, to try come to some understanding about why I had missed the obvious so much. He asked me a simple question that had had been lost in all the excitement of that day: “Did I ever see Amy come back out from that house?”

  
I didn’t respond at first. The last decade seeming to shimmer around me. 

  
Apparently she had gone missing that day. They thought she ran away at first. Something that was corroborated when they found Billy, hiding out in the bin sheds after a day of searching. It seemed as if they had scared each other with a story about a “grey man” and had both not wanted to go home. They had decided the same with Billy a few weeks later when he didn’t come home for a final time. 

  
My Dad said that they had wanted to talk to me but he hadn't let them, for fear of traumatising me at a young age. So we just moved away, moved away from my friends and whatever had happened to them. 

  
I didn’t wait to hear more of his explanation, simply hanging up the phone and sitting starting off into space for a few hours.

  
They may have never been real friends but they were felt like it at the time. And the tragedy of whatever happened to them fills me with just as much melancholy as fear. 

  
I came so close to going missing with them, but maybe I could've done something to help them. If my feet would’ve let me move and tell Amy to stop, or if my Dad would've let me tell the police where they may have been. How long were they in that house? Are they still?

  
As I sit and wonder about this, I’m becoming increasingly paranoid. The hairs on my neck wont let me turn to the computer to type for long before I have to turn and scan my still empty living room.

  
I’ve had to pull the curtains closed. Call it silly, but whoever is standing at the bus stop across from my flat has been there for a long time, letting many buses pass them by. And from this distance, and the morning haze, their skin is looking grey.
