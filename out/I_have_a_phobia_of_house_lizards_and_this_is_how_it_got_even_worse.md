I never thought I’d fear something as small as a house lizard. Growing up, they were just part of the background—especially when you live in Australia, the land where the devil keeps his pets.

A faint clicking sound in the evenings, the occasional darting shadow on the wall, at least they are harmless compared to having a snake in your toilet.

But now? Now, I can’t hear that sound without feeling like my chest is caving in.

It all started a few years ago. I was still living at home back then, in a small house near the edge of the woods. The house was old, and lizards were frequent visitors. My parents never minded them. 

“They eat the bugs,” my mother would say. But to me, they were unsettling—their slick, translucent skin, the way their eyes bulged out as if they were always watching.

The turning point came one evening during a power outage. I was sitting alone in the dark, reading by flashlight in my bedroom. That’s when I heard it: 

"Tch-tch-tch.”

The sound was close—too close. I swung my flashlight around, its beam slicing through the dark. There, on the wall above my bed, was the largest house lizard I’d ever seen. Its tail twitched, and its head tilted toward me, as if it was sizing me up. My heart started pounding.

I grabbed a broom and tried to chase it out, but the moment I swatted near it, the thing darted toward me. It was so fast. Too fast. I stumbled backward, tripping over my desk chair and falling hard onto the floor. I swear I could feel it land on me for a split second before it disappeared into the shadows.

That night, I barely slept. Every time I closed my eyes, I imagined its cold, clammy skin crawling over me. The next morning, I found myself inspecting every corner of the room, sealing every crack and crevice I could find. Ever since that night, the clicking sound of house lizards became the sound I hate the most.

When I moved into my own apartment years later, I thought I could finally leave the trauma behind. This was my space—clean, sealed, and free from cracks and crevices. I took every precaution, spraying repellents, sealing gaps, and keeping food securely stored.

But the clicking sound followed me.

At first, it was faint, almost inaudible. I convinced myself it was just the pipes or the wind. But as the weeks passed, the sound grew louder and more frequent. It always came late at night when the world was still and my guard was down.

One night, the sound started again.

“Tch-tch-tch.”

It was coming from the corner of my bedroom. My stomach twisted as I stared at the wall, praying the noise would stop. But it didn’t. It grew louder, deliberate, taunting.

I grabbed a broom and turned on every light in the room. My heart pounded as I searched every corner—the living room, under the bed, inside the closet. But there was nothing. No lizard, no cracks, no explanation. The room was empty.

Yet the sound continued.

Over the next few nights, I barely slept. The clicking sound seemed to move—one night from the wall, another from the ceiling, then behind the cupboard. It was relentless. I became obsessed, setting traps, lining the walls with sticky pads, and keeping a flashlight in my hand at all times.

Then, one night, I heard something new. A faint shuffling, like footsteps. I froze. The sound was coming from the living room. My heart hammered as I tiptoed to the door, gripping the broom like a weapon.

I peeked into the darkness, and that’s when I saw it—a figure crouched by the window, its silhouette barely visible in the moonlight.

It wasn’t a lizard.

I turned on the light, and my blood turned cold. A middle aged man with ragged clothes and unusually thick beard was crouched there, his head tilted unnaturally, his lips curling into a grin. 

“Tch-tch-tch,” he clicked, mimicking the sound perfectly. In his hands, I saw a bar of chocolate. *My bar of chocolate* I bought earlier that day.

My breath caught in my throat as his head bobbed side to side, his eyes wide and unblinking. He tilted his head further, like he was studying me, enjoying my fear. My body froze, paralyzed by the realization: the sound wasn’t coming from a lizard.

It had been him all along.

I screamed and lunged for the door, slamming it shut behind me as I ran into the hallway. When the neighbours arrived, they found no one in the apartment, no sign of forced entry. But I knew what I’d seen. I stayed at my friend's apartment later that day.

The next morning, I learned the chilling truth. The man was a squatter who had been secretly living in the unused attic above my apartment for weeks. I didn't know when exactly he started squatting, but he knew the layout of my apartment well. Probably he spent countless nights observing my movements from above.

At some point, he had carefully carved a small, hidden hole in the ceiling just above my teakwood cupboard—a spot so inconspicuous that I never thought to inspect it.

Through that hole, he had been sneaking into my apartment to steal some food, especially when I was asleep.

The landlord evicted the man soon after.

His presence had been hidden by his peculiar condition—Tourette's Syndrome. His tics, including the strange clicking sound, had been mistaken for house lizards—something that the previous tenants had ignored. I guess nobody had a house lizard phobia just like me.

But that didn’t ease the terror I felt. Knowing that he’d been silently watching me, hearing his distorted tics echoing through the walls, left me unable to ever truly feel safe in my own apartment again.

Now, ask yourself: are those random sounds you hear while reading this story really just random? How sure are you that you’re truly alone at home?
