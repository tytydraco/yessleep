Alice was my best friend - and then one day, she wasn’t.  I suppose that’s just how it is.  You’re inseparable for most of your childhood, you graduate highschool, you go to the same college.  You room together and after graduation you beat the odds and remain in touch.  It helps that you get jobs in the same city and sure, you buy houses that are thirty minutes away from each other, but that’s what weekend brunch is for, right?

Then weekend brunch starts getting canceled and the texting dies off and the next thing you know you’re getting a call and she’s *so excited* and wants you to be her maid of honor.

I think you know how it goes from here.  Oh, I went to the wedding and it was *lovely* and I even put aside that sense of dread laying like a rock in my stomach.  Because she was my best friend and that’s what you do for best friends.  You smile and wear the dress and give a lovely speech and then you watch as she starts a new chapter of her life and sadly acknowledge that you’re not going to be one the characters in her story anymore.

And that’s exactly what happened.  She vanished from my life.  I got the occasional Christmas card from her and that’s how I found out that she and her husband had moved out of the state.  He was a real outdoorsy type.  I only met him a few times before the wedding and that was the whole of his personality.  Alice had never shown much of an interest in that kind of thing before, but suddenly it was *her* personality too.  They went to Yellowstone for their honeymoon.  She started wearing a lot of Patagonia and North Face.  I suppose it’s nice to find new, shared interests, but it was like her old personality dissolved as fast as our friendship.

I told myself to get over it, that these things happen.  People change and move on with their lives.  Still, it came as a bit of a surprise to get that card with the new address in Colorado.  Discovering new passions is one thing, but packing up and moving halfway across the country to someplace where you have no friends or family came as a shock to me.

But it was beautiful there.  They had a house up in the mountains, surrounded by woods.  I saw the pictures that Alice posted on Instagram.  Photos of the pronghorn and the elk.  Snow covered trees in the winter.  One year, she posted a photo of a whole herd of elk bedded down in their backyard, hunkering underneath the pines to wait out a snowstorm.  I began to understand the quick change in personality a little better.  If someone I loved had shown me all of this and told me it could be our future, I might have abandoned my old life too.  

Then one day she stopped posting.  I worried a little bit.  Was she having trouble with her marriage?  Financial problems?  It’s a very expensive area to live in.  I kept an eye on her Instagram and other social media but all I saw was the occasional comment on someone else’s post.  She was still *alive*, but she’d stopped sharing anything of her own life.  

People change.  Situations shift.  There wasn’t anything I could really do about it.  When the yearly Christmas card failed to arrive, though, I sent her a text saying that I was thinking of her and hoped she was doing well.

An hour later she called me.

“Tabitha!” she exclaimed, almost shouting at me over the phone.  “It’s so good to hear your voice.  I’m sorry I didn’t call, it was just there was so much going on after the wedding and then the move and all.”

“It’s okay.  Life gets busy on you, I understand.”

I mean, I did understand.  I didn’t like it, but I understood.

“Listen, I’m sorry for neglecting our friendship.  I really am.  Do-do you want to come visit me?  Like… this weekend?”

“That’s like… a three hour plane flight.”

“I’ll pay for the tickets.  It can be a ‘I’m sorry I’m a bad friend’ gift.”

I hesitated, because even with the offer of a free trip that’s a lot to drop on someone.  Just pack up and leave in a few days?  I mentally ran through my checklist of what I needed to do around the house.  I needed groceries, but I supposed if I was leaving town that could wait.

Then Alice whispered ‘please’ over the phone.

It was the desperation in her voice that convinced me.  Suddenly, her silent Instagram account began to make sense.  Something *was* wrong.  And maybe we weren’t best friends anymore and flying halfway across the country on a moment’s notice wasn’t really something estranged friends did, but I felt I owed it to her.  For all the years we had been friends.  So I let her pay for the tickets and less than twenty-four hours after that phone call I was boarding a plane to Colorado.



The plane flight was rough.  It had snowed in Colorado the day before and our flight path took us around the edge of the departing storm front.  It made for gorgeous scenery though, when the plane landed.  I had never seen the Rocky Mountains before and I was stunned by their majesty, when the highway curved around and they lay before me on the horizon.  Their snow-capped peaks shone against the gray sky.  They were the *only* thing on the horizon, because of course they were, nothing else could rival them.  I couldn’t help but be excited, despite the strangeness of Alice’s request that I visit.

Alice’s house was nestled in the foothills.  I drove the rental through winding roads that curved alongside the edge of the mountainsides, drawing me steadily higher into the mountains.  The roads were clear, but everything else was coated with a few inches of snow, still pristine and glittering in the subdued sunlight.  I found myself wishing Alice had picked me up, so that I could look at the scenery instead of the road.  But I’d insisted on getting a rental, because if this visit turned sour I wanted a way to leave on my own power.

She hadn’t mentioned her husband yet.  I assumed he was gone and they were in the throes of a messy divorce.

Alice’s house was a modest ranch tucked up above the main road.  I zigzagged up the long drive before pulling onto the gravel driveway and stopping the car.  Alice was waiting on the front porch when I got out.  She half raised her hand in greeting as I got my bags out of the car.

“Thanks for coming,” she said.  “Uh, I’ve got a guest room for you.”

I scanned the exterior.  It was a lovely house.  Well-maintained.  I asked how they got it and Alice told me that it was the summer home for Daniel’s parents.  They were too old for this sort of thing now - at least, that’s what they said when they gave him the place.

“Where is Daniel, anyway?” I asked.

Alice’s jaw tightened.  She carried on as if I hadn’t asked the question, prattling about how the guest bedroom opens to the back of the house so I’d have a perfect view of the trees.  I dropped my bag on the bed and then returned to the living room.  Alice was already there, staring through the sliding glass doors that opened to the back porch.

“Do you plan on doing any hiking while you’re here?” she asked.

“Not really.  It’s not my thing,” I replied.

“…that’s …good.  Hey, if you see any elk, don’t go outside, okay?  They get a little weird this time of the year and they’re *really* big animals.”

I promised her I’d be careful.  I didn’t care to be in the news as ‘tourist trampled by angry elk’.

It quickly became apparent that Alice wasn’t getting out much.  Her small talk was awkward and forced.  I tried asking about her job and she didn’t say much other than she’d gone remote some months ago.  When I asked if she liked it, she said it was ‘alright.’  Anytime I tried to ask about Daniel, she grew evasive.

His things were still in the house.  I found men’s jackets in the hallway closet when I hung mine up.  There were men’s shoes in the entryway.  Pictures of him and Alice smiled at me from the mantle.  It was like he’d simply walked out that morning and would be back in time for dinner.  Finally, after I’d exhausted every topic of conversation I knew of to fill the silence, I decided to try a question that Alice hopefully couldn’t dodge.

“So - is Daniel at work?” I asked.  “When do you expect him home?”

“I don’t know.  It’s hard to tell anymore when he’ll be by.  Maybe this evening.  Could be tomorrow.  Any day now, really.”

It seemed weird to me that she wouldn’t know this.

“Is he traveling for work?”

“….yeah.”

She stared out the window, at the trees past the porch, cupping her hot tea in her hands.  It felt like she wasn’t there anymore, that any words I’d say would just echo in the empty house.

The silence was getting to me.  I wasn’t used to this much quiet.  No cars, no neighbors, no dogs barking.  I didn’t know how Alice stood it.  Maybe nothing was wrong, maybe Daniel was just traveling a lot lately and Alice was lonely.  I’d lose my mind if I was trapped out here with nothing but the faint breeze stirring the trees for company.

“Hey, how about I go into town and pick up groceries for dinner?” I suggested.  “I can cook us something.”

I’d had a peek at the fridge earlier.  It was nearly empty, but the freezer was packed with microwave meals.  

“Oh.  Sure.  That’d be nice,” she said.

“Do you want to come?”

“No, I should stay here in case Daniel gets home.”

So thirty minutes of driving later, I found myself in a small grocery store with wooden floors and only five aisles.  Their selection was surprisingly good for such a small store, however, and I settled on a couple of steaks and some potatoes.  As I approached the checkout, I found a couple locals engaged in a hushed, anxious conversation.

“I think they’re coming,” the woman was saying.  “Could be as early as this evening.”

“Did you see them?” the cashier asked.

“No, but I was just at the bakery and Grace said she heard them pass by her house this morning.”

“Grace likes to stir up drama.”

“Yeah, but they’re due any day now…”

Their conversation trailed off as I approached.  I put my items on the counter and the cashier rang me up.  The woman hovered nearby, politely waiting for me to leave before they resumed their discussion.  I wanted to confront them about it and demand to know what was going on, but I supposed I could always ask Alice.  She’d lived here long enough.  She might know what they were talking about and that way I’d avoid a conversation with people I didn’t know.

I did pause at the exit to the store, rummaging in my purse as if I had forgotten something.  The locals hadn’t resumed their debate on whether or not Grace was trustworthy.  Instead, the cashier had abandoned his post and was now hastily lowering all the blinds in the store.  He was doing so with a strange urgency, running from window to window, and no one in the store seemed surprised by his frantic haste.



“Hey Alice, I’m back!” I yelled as I entered the house.  “I got us steak.”

“We can’t use the grill.”

Her reply was so immediate and curt  that it made me pause.

“Sure,” I said.  “I can cook it on the stove instead.”

“You shouldn’t go on the porch for any reason.”

I turned to find a pan to sear the steaks in and was startled to find Alice directly behind me.  She grabbed my wrist and her fingers dug into my tendons.  I winced, but her eyes were wide and wild and she did not relent.

“I mean it.  Don’t go out there.”

“I promise I won’t!” I gasped, stunned.  “Please let go!”

She released me and stumbled back, startled by her own actions.  She stared at her hands for a moment in confusion, then hastily turned her back.  She seemed so different with her shoulders hunched and her head down.  I felt like I didn’t know her anymore.  What had happened here?

“I heard some people talking in the store,” I said tentatively.  “They said something was coming?”

“Something *is* coming.  Don’t go outside, okay?”

She shuffled from the kitchen, leaving me to finish cooking dinner by myself.

The sun was setting by the time we sat down to eat.  It was a tense, quiet meal and I spent most of it deliberating on how I’d bring up the delicate subject of asking what happened between her and Daniel.  I’d finally settled on just - ripping the Band-Aid off - and coming right out and asking when I heard a sound from outside.  Alice heard it too, for she froze in place.  She stared straight ahead at the wall, her face pale and her breath coming in short, shallow gasps.

There were footsteps outside.  I rose from my chair, turned to the window, and gently parted the blinds.  There was movement outside and the shine of inky black eyes.

And Alice lunged out of her seat.  She hit the table in her haste, knocking the plates awry and some silverware clattered to the floor.  Startled, I took a step back, and Alice stumbled to fill the void I’d just left.  She slapped her hands over the blinds, holding them in place.  Her breath came in short, frightened hiccups.

“Don’t!” she gasped.  “You can’t look.”

“Alice, *what is going on*?  I can’t even look outside now?  And where *is* Daniel?  You keep avoiding giving me straight answers about where he’s at.”

“I can’t - I’m sorry Tabitha.  I just didn’t want to be alone.  It’s, it’s been a year-”

She crumpled into her seat, sobbing.  I seized the opportunity and parted the blinds again just enough for a quick look outside.  

Elk.  A herd of elk were shambling past, walking slowly through the trees behind the house.  A large herd, arrayed in a long line.  It reminded me of train cars.  Their fur was ragged and bare in spots, their ribs showed underneath their coats.  They walked with their heads drooping and their eyes shone in the moonlight.  I dropped the blinds and sat down next to my weeping friend.

“It’s been a year since what?” I asked.

“Since Daniel left.  I-I know how that sounds but - it wasn’t his fault.  They… they called to him.  That’s why we can’t go outside.”

“I looked outside just now.  The only thing out there are some elk.”

She went pale.  She grabbed my hands with her own, squeezing them tight.  Her watery gaze sought my eyes and held them.  Her pupils were dilated with fear.

“You didn’t hear anything, did you?” she whispered.

No.  I hadn’t.  It was just some elk.  But Alice wouldn’t calm down, not even with my reassurances.

“They come every year,” she continued.  “The lost herd.  From before we were here, building our houses, pushing them out.  That’s what the locals told me, when we moved here.  They walk from one end of the continent to the other, back and forth, over the course of the year.”

The cashier closing all the blinds in the store.  Alice’s own shuttered house.  Her insistence on not going outside.

“Alice…” I ventured, “What is *wrong* with the elk?  Why does everyone seem scared of them?”

“It’s a long way to travel.  So long.  And they have to replenish their numbers.”  She took a deep breath.  “I’m sorry.  I shouldn't have asked you to come.  I just didn’t want to be alone.”

A horrible thought was dawning in my head.  My friend wasn’t acting like someone that was going through a messy divorce.  She was *grieving*.  And this was the anniversary of whatever had happened to Daniel.

I asked her if he was gone.  Daniel.  If he was *never* coming back.

“No,” she said, her voice devoid of emotion, her eyes staring past me toward whatever lay on the other side of the wall.  “He came back.  He’s outside.  With the elk.”

My heart hammered in my chest.  None of this made any sense, it *couldn’t* make sense, but something truly terrible had happened to my friend there, alone in that house with her, I was starting to wonder if maybe there really *was* a reason no one in this town would look outside right now.

“Are you saying… if I go and look again I’ll see Daniel out there with that herd?”

But Alice was no longer listening to me.  She rocked subtly back and forth, whispering to herself.

“They have to replenish their numbers.”

I went to the door leading to the back porch.  I shoved aside the drapes.  The herd was continuing to walk past in slow, even paces.  Some of them were shaped oddly, I realized.  Their shoulders were positioned higher than their haunches and their necks were too short.  Their fur hadn’t grown in fully and pink skin showed in large patches along their flanks and bellies.

Then one of them turned its head sideways.  It stopped in its march and stared directly at me.

A human face.  Human eyes.  Human hands, curling hoofed fingers into the dirt.  Human skin, where the fur hadn’t grown out yet.

A face I saw staring at me from the photos on the walls and the mantle.

Daniel.  I was looking at Daniel.

He opened his mouth and what came out wasn’t quite the moan of an elk, but neither was it fully formed words.  Yet underneath the indistinguishable garble was a meaning, one meant for me, one I *understood*.

*Come.*

My body was moving of its own volition.  Somewhere, in the back of my mind, I began to panic.  This wasn’t what I wanted.  I didn’t want to go out there with those elk and whatever Daniel had become - was *becoming*.  Yet all of that was buried under a need, an impulse rooted so deep in the rock and soil I might have well as been trying to stop the rotation of the earth.  It was like the will of the trees and the sky and the mountains around us was bearing down on me, crushing my will, until nothing remained of myself except that one, irrefutable, command.

*COME.*

I fumbled with the lock for the sliding glass door.  My hand was on the handle, about to wrench it open.  My heart beat like a bird’s wing, rejoicing.  I was going.  I would go with them.  I’d walk and walk to the ocean and back, again and again, and that was *right* and it was what I was *meant* to do-

Then Alice hit me in the back of the head with a chair.

I only remember fragments of what happened next as I faded in and out of consciousness.

Alice stepping over me and opening the sliding glass door.  Her crying had stopped and she walked with her shoulders back and her spine straight.  It was the first time I’d seen her walk with confidence since I’d arrived.

Alice, in the yard, walking with her hand on Daniel’s back.

Alice, turning to face him.  Standing on tiptoes, her face raised to kiss him.

Alice falling in line with the elk, taking her place behind Daniel.

Walking away.

Then when I next woke up, they were gone and the yard was empty and quiet.  I didn’t know how long I’d been unconscious, but dinner was completely cold by then.  The elk had left, continuing their death march to the ocean where they’d turn around and walk all the way back and to the other ocean.  Again and again, until they dropped of exhaustion, and called someone else to replenish their numbers.



Two days ago, on the anniversary of Alice’s disappearance, I returned to Colorado.  I rented a cabin and when the employee gave me the key, he warned me not to bother the elk.  Leave the blinds closed, he said.  I promised I would.

That night, I prepared myself.  I put on a climbing harness.  I tied rope between myself and several points throughout the cabin - the stove, the bed, anything that looked too heavy for me to drag with my own strength.  Then, secured like the sailors of old, lashed to the wheel to combat the siren’s call, I waited.

They came.  I heard the stamp of their hooves as they passed by.  The blinds were up and the curtains were open so that I could see them clearly through the window.  They shuffled by, sickly and starved, unable to stop on their endless march.

I saw Daniel.  His human face was gone and his hands had become hooves.  Only a few patches of pink skin remained to betray the human he’d once been.  Behind him walked Alice.  Her human eyes were tired in her sunken face, her human hands were cracked and coated with dried blood.  Her gait was lopsided, as her hind legs weren’t the same length yet.

And behind her walked their child.  Fully elk, fur sleek over its thin body.

It turned its head and looked at me.  Opened its mouth and bleated.

*COME*, it said.  [*COME.*](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)
