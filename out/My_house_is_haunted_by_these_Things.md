My name Is Jason Jeremy Harris this may be my last Message, Let me start at the beginning

I recently Moved into my new house in the valleys of Wales but my new house was known for well known murders such as the Katiln Catherine murder where a Woman was found with Bites marks all over her body,

My sister had found the house for me as I lived previously near Scotland and my family was based in Wales. I have a 7 year old daughter who was terrified of the house before. I also had bad feeling of the house but it was cheap and I was on a budget so I got it first couple of Days there was alright but a week after I heard a baby crying in the attic, at time I thought my daughter got up there somehow so I went to check it out when I got up there it was pitch black,I tried to put the light but the fuse bursted I started calling out for my daughter "Katie come out please" but what responded was a chilling giggle then something pushed me done the ladder up the attic I injured my hip.

After that incident another was to come my daughter got kidnapped, the search was for a couple of Days until I was alerted by the police that my daughter was found, I hoped for that she was alive I was wrong 

My daughter was found with Bite marks on her body, her face chewed in places and her eyeballs gone, leaving only her sockets filled with blood, I cried for maybe 20 minutes straight.

After returning to my house I heard a noise, the sound of my daughter laughing right then I felt a bit of hope maybe that was a fake body I went around my house shouting her name, my sister came to visit and heard the noise as well, she hadn't heard of Katie's death only her going missing and a few minutes a I heard a scream and went downstairs to where my sister was there was a scene that horrified me my sister guts over her dead body and a little girl who look like Katie but wasn't she was different her hair black rather then her usual dark brown, paler and no eyes, she turned around to face me I stood in shock then she began crawling towards me whispering "Daddy, it's me Katie daddy" then in a harsher voice "It's alright daddy it feels great being apart of this house why don't you join us" then I turned the room filled with people who had the same features of the evil Katie.

They were chanting "Join us Jason" and things such as "Your sister didn't so we killed her you are much wiser then her aren't you" I felt sicken hearing this I pushed the people out of the way the thing that scared me was they were physical and their skin rotten as I touched it. I ran to my room where I'm currently hiding and writing this I don't have much time please send help my address is -
