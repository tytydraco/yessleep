Jamie checked the magazine in her rifle one more time to ensure it was loaded. “You sure you’re all topped off on ammo?”

I mimicked her, tugging the flaps of my canvas bandolier open to show each little metal box filled with cartridges. “Uh huh.”

“Canteen full?”

Reaching down to the green army-surplus canteen that hung from my belt, I shook it so she could hear the sloshing inside. “Yep.”

“Got your headlamp?”

Dangling it from my fingers by the strap, I waved it like a hypnotist’s watch. “Got three sets of spare batteries in my belt.”

Around me, the parking lot in front of the visitor’s center buzzed with activity. An armored pickup truck sat idling nearby while our driver, Blane, inspected it from top to bottom for any issues. Perched atop the gunner’s turret, Chris checked over the aged M60 machine gun that the militia had fitted to the truck, wiping the interior of the weapon’s receiver with an oily rag. The tangy scent of diesel fuel and cigarette smoke filled the air as the three other rangers stood looking over a map, sharing valuable smokes, and chatting in low voices. Jamie and I stood at a white plastic table that had been set out by a team of workers, laden with ammunition, weapon’s cleaning supplies, spare batteries for flashlights, and a round yellow cooler full of water. No expense was spared on anyone who went through the main gates at night, and a few kitchen girls even handed out little cups of tea for us, since the supply of premium roast had dried up long before I got here.

I sipped at one of the cups and sighed.

*It’s going to be a long war without coffee.*

In the three days since my arrival, I’d spent every moment with Jamie, doing some kind of training for this night. Creature identification, target shooting, calisthenics, even boxing, which I sucked at, all became part of my day. Despite my advance in weekly salary, I tried to save the .22 cartridges in my sock drawer for gear, and that meant putting up with meager communal rations for all my meals. I’d gone to bed exhausted and woken up sore every day, but now that my first night patrol was here, I almost wished I could be tired just to push the anxiety out of my mind.

Jamie nodded with satisfaction, the eerie glow of the floodlights in front of the visitor’s center casting shadows across the parking lot. “Can’t be too prepared. Make sure to hit the bathroom before we leave, just in case—”

“I went twice already.” I drained the last of my tea to its dregs, though my intestines still jumped like frogs inside my belly.

She flicked both green eyes toward the main gate, then back to me. “Nervous?”

Glancing over my shoulder, I caught Chris’s gaze from atop the truck, and jerked my head back around, the flutters in my stomach returning. “Terrified.”

Jamie press-checked the Beretta from her holster and swatted at a mosquito with her free hand. “It’s normal for your first time out. But we’ll be fine. If this was going to be a bad op, we’d have at least three, maybe four, gun trucks. We’ll be in the back anyway, so you’ll have an inch or two of armor between you and whatever is out there.”

*Assuming it’s not big enough to rip clean through it.*

“Recon patrol, on me.” A booming voice called from the center of the lot, and I followed the others as we all converged on Tyler, our patrol leader.

Each truck always went out with a driver, a truck commander who worked the radio from the passenger seat, a gunner who manned the turret, and two to four additional riflemen in the back, in case things got spicy. As our TC, Tyler was a quiet guy, easy-going, and less gung-ho than some of the older fighters I’d met so far. Dressed in the standard fatigues of Carter’s militia, he kept his sleeves rolled up to a practical length, wore civilian hiking shoes instead of army-surplus boots, and his head boasted a green baseball cap instead of the standard issue patrol caps that Carter insisted his men wear. Jamie had told me that Tyler served in Afghanistan before the Breach, and judging by the ease with which he rested one elbow on the hood of our gun truck, I wondered if anything scared this man anymore.

Counting silently with his eyes, Tyler scratched at the stubble on his chin, his AR slung casually over one shoulder. “Alright, here’s the deal. Command wants us to check the camera traps along the southern ridgeline. Most of you know the drill, but we’ve got a newbie here, so I’ll reiterate.”

My face flushed hot at their glances toward me, but Chris and Jamie both gave me encouraging smiles as Tyler went on.

“Our mission is to swap out SD cards in the trail cams so our research teams can analyze any mutant migration patterns. Thanks to the fact that the southern ridgeline is basically one big high-wall, we probably won’t run into anything. All the same, our job is to clear the road of any critters big enough to cause problems for us in the future.” He spread a map out across the truck hood and traced a line on the map with his gloved finger. “For our route, we’ll take the main road down to Elder Crossing and then Hallows Run across the ridgeline, until we loop all the way around to 142 and then back to Bethesda Ridge Road. Questions?”

Again, they all looked at me, and I shook my head. True, I had enough questions to last for hours, but I didn’t want to seem stupid, or naïve.

“Good stuff.” Tyler folded the small map back up and tucked it into his plate carrier. “Let’s mount up, and I’ll let Carter know we’re ready.”

I sat in the back of the truck, peering through the firing slits cut into the armored box, and watched as the gates rolled past us, the safety of New Wilderness growing smaller and smaller in the distance. A cool breeze flowed from the open turret where Chris stood, but it was still humid, and the aged springs in our repurposed automotive seats creaked with every bump in the road. Jamie sat beside me, resting with her head against the seat back, both eyes closed. Across from me, the two other rangers, Darren and Pierce, slouched in their respective seats as well, one reading a little paperback copy of *Moby Dick* by light of his headlamp, the other drumming his thumbs on his kneecaps and bobbing his head to a mental replay of some unknown song. Like Jamie and I, they wore the black polo shirt of the New Wilderness ranger force, though theirs were more faded, ragged, and torn in places.

*At least it’s quiet. Quiet is good, right?*

Pressing my face to the nearest firing slit, I stared out into the night, drinking in the fresh air, and watching the darkness roll by. The communal fields swayed in the light breeze, starchy green corn plants, leafy soybeans, and a late crop of golden wheat. Tall fences marked the pasture areas outside our walls, where imposing bison, shaggy long-horned cattle, stocky muscled horses, and many of the changing exotic species huddled in protective herds to ward off any potential threats. Further beyond these, the fences of our exterior pastures ended, and we sped out into the lonely emptiness of the wild.

I’d seen plenty of empty places in my various urban travels, abandoned parking garages, shopping malls, and factories. There was always something melancholy about them, a sadness I couldn’t quite put my finger on, that sensation that something was missing. Here, I felt the same emotions return, only the missing thing was obvious now; all the people were gone.

Abandoned cars littered the roadside in several places, most of them either stripped, or burned wrecks, with shattered glass, and slumped corpses still at the wheel. A few farms gleamed in the faint moonlight, some decrepit, charred shells of buildings, while others looked mostly intact, though the ajar doors, broken windows, and scattered trash across the yards proved these to be empty as well. Broken telephone poles marked where something big had ripped down the power lines, and in more than one place I caught the movement of shadows in the trees. Eyes would occasionally reflect the beams of our truck’s headlights, and above the roar of the diesel engine, I could make out the bizarre cacophony of the night’s creatures.

*No lights, no barbeques, no music. No people at all. Almost like we never existed.*

My eyes drooped, and I stifled a yawn. Man, it was warm in here.

Slouching down in my seat, I mimicked Jamie, and did my best to find a good spot to wedge my head against the worn cushions. The bumps in the road blurred together, along with the steady hum of the diesel engine, and the wind tickled my ear from the firing slit. In my mind’s eye, I could see my family gathered around the table in our house, smiling at me as mom brought out my birthday cake, a mouth-watering triple chocolate layer cake that she was famous for. I could smell my dad’s loaded chill hotdogs, heard their laughter, felt their warm hugs around my shoulders.

*“Hannah*.” Dad whispered as he hugged me.

“Hannah.”

My eyes flew open, and I sat up too fast, wincing at a stiffness in my neck that told me I’d be sorry in the morning.

Jamie grinned from her seat next to me and pointed to the open door in the back of the compartment. “First stop. Time to go.”

Clambering out after her, I left the warm and fuzzy thoughts of cake and junk food behind, no more than distant memories in the shroud of the night.

The truck sat idling in the middle of a narrow gravel road covered with weeds and water-filled potholes, as if it hadn’t been properly maintained in a while. Thick, twisted trees clung to the sides of the winding ruts like cathedral walls, and tangled briars filled the space between their knotty trunks. Crickets chirped in the nearby grass, and Darren and Pierce were already standing by a gnarled oak on the right side of the road, working on a green trail camera strapped to its bark. Chris sat in his gunner’s perch atop the truck, watching the road ahead, and Jamie directed me to follow her a short distance to the rear, where we stood guard around the muddy tire tracks.

“Check it out.” Jamie pointed through the trees on the left side of the road, her smile reflecting the low-beam setting of my headlamp.

Through a clearing in the tree line, I could make out the wide, rolling plain below us, a checkerboard of fields, roads, and grasslands. Here and there, small clusters of shadows moved, various mutants going about their ‘day’, and I caught the emerald glow of the strange deer that I’d learned about in creature identification, a bone-faced species that lit up the night with long high-pitched bugles. Other little groups of yellow blobs that I knew were Speaker Crabs scuttled by the drainage ditches, little radio-like techno anomalies that ate carrion, and played broken snippets of music to communicate with each other. Fireflies buzzed back and forth, twinkling like millions of Christmas lights all over the valley, and spots of purple, orange, and pink shone from various patches of plant life that had also sprouted under the influence of the mysterious Breach. Multiple flocks of creatures soared in the sky, some small, some much larger, one massive silhouette far to the north riding the breeze with two bat-like wings. Sweet aromas of nectar carried on the wind from the dozens of nocturnal blooms, and carnivorous roars echoed from a few miles away, likely a pack of the Birch Crawlers that Jamie hated so much. Silvery moonlight bathed everything in a gray ambience, and I could just make out a familiar rise in the distance, topped with the unnatural hard lines and bright spots of orange flame demarking human civilization.

“You know, I never did say it before.” Jamie met my eye and gestured to the valley below us. “Welcome to New Wilderness.”

*From up here, it’s actually kind of pretty.*

I ate up the view with hungry eyes, something about the scene reminding me of a vast, primal garden, undisturbed by skyscrapers, car horns, and streetlights. “Thanks. I wish I had my camera. This would make a great shot.”

Stones crunched under boots behind me, and I turned to see Darren and Pierce waving us over.

“All finished here.” Darren called, and we climbed back into the truck to move on to the next camera site.

Four stops in, and we were bumping along the narrow ridge road, when the brakes suddenly screeched, and everyone in the back nearly flew to the floor as the armored truck ground to a halt. Mumbled curses clogged the stuffy interior, and Jamie crawled over to the window separating our compartment from the cab of the truck to bang on it with her fist.

“Hey, what’s going on?”

From inside the cab, Tyler peered back, and pointed to the rear door. “Everyone out! Pull 360 security, now!”

A shiver went through me at the tension in his voice. Something was wrong, Tyler was on edge, and we hadn’t driven far enough yet to reach the next camera site. The other two guys scrambled for the back door, while Chris cranked his turret around to scan the woods, and Jamie grabbed my arm.

“Stay close to me, alright?” Her eyes held a serious gleam, no joking smirk or sly grin on her face this time.

Clutching my submachine gun in both hands, I followed Jamie out into the dark.

At first, I didn’t see much difference in this particular area. The woods stood a little more silent, the crickets had gone quiet, but other than that, everything seemed normal.

Craning my head to the right, I looked down.

*Holy crap.*

On the southern side of the ridge, the world went into a straight drop clear of all vegetation, nothing but exposed rock and dirt for what looked like fifty feet or more. Darkness crouched between the densely packed trees, the distant ground covered in murky fog, and not a single human light greeted us from that side, as if the abyss was devoid of all touches from mankind. The slip had eaten away at the road in front of us, cutting the truck off from the rest of the ridgeline, and from where I stood, I realized that the entire ridge was like this. Bare cliffs were topped with enough brush to make me think there was just another gentle slope on this side, same as with the north. I had been so busy admiring the New Wilderness valley, that I hadn’t even considered why so few creatures came from the south.

“Man, that’s high.” Darren stood at the edge of the precipice, looking down into the inky darkness of the south, grasping his rifle. “I’ve never seen it this bad.”

Pierce scanned the trees behind us with jittery eyes. “You think something did this?”

Tyler shook his head, a grim frown on his face. “Nothing’s big enough to do this. You see those pointy hills, way out there?”

Like the others, I followed his finger with my gaze, noting the tall shadows of several hills far to the south, jutting out against the sky like arrow heads.

“They weren’t there last month.” He narrowed his eyes at them, as if he wasn’t sure the hills would start moving on their own. “Everything south of the ridge is shifting.”

*The tremors.*

I remembered how the lodge shook my first night at New Wilderness, the distance rumbling that no one else had paid any mind to. It hadn’t been thunder from passing storms. Like the plants and animals, even the very ground beneath Barron County was changing.

Jamie chewed her lower lip, and flexed tense fingers on the grip of her AK. “Since when did the Breach make the ground move?”

Tyler scratched at his chin, though I noticed his hand shake ever so slightly. “There’s an ancient fault line that runs right under Ohio. Been there before the country was founded. It’s never been all that active, but if I had to guess, I’d say all the electromagnetic stuff put out by the Breach is causing it to slip.”

Darren blinked at him. “You mean, like earthquake stuff?”

“More like continent-splitting stuff.” Throwing one last look at the southern abyss, Tyler spun on his heel to head for the truck. “Let’s head back. Sean needs to know about this.”

As I shuffled for the rear doors to the armored compartment, the toe of my shoe caught on a pothole, and I nearly face-planted in the muck. “Ah, for the love of . . .”

Brushing myself off, I turned to glare at the little pit in anger.

No, not a pothole.

A footprint.

A huge, rounded print, with four big claw marks at the top, pressed deep into the mud. More like it wandered in an ambling line to the trees on the left side of the road, right into a patch of broken, trampled underbrush. It was too big for a dog or cat, and something about it sent chills down my spine, a familiarity that rooted me in place.

*Not a wolf, not a mountain lion, definitely not a racoon . . .*

Something snapped in the briars across the road from me, and out into the beam of my headlamp tumbled a little ball of fur, no bigger than a backpack. It rolled to a stop a few feet away, and shook itself, only to look up and freeze upon spotting me.

It had two beady little black eyes, a stubby brown snout, and round ears atop its head. Four tiny paws bore stubby claws, and shaggy black fur covered the thing like a 1970’s carpet. Bulges under its skin formed plates all over its body like football pads, but I knew that these were made from bone, a natural defense added to these animals by the Breach.

The cub stared at me, then lunged back into brush with an alarmed whimper, like a child scared to go into a dark room.

From behind the wall of brush, a shadow rose, tall as a semi-truck on its hind legs. None of the others seemed to have noticed it yet, too close to the truck to hear the brush breaking over the rumble of the diesel, and Chris was looking out over the southern precipice.

Cold sweat beaded on my skin, my lungs tightened, and my brain fuzzed over with fear. The submachine gun hung useless by its strap on my shoulder, my pale hands too stiff with fear to move as Andrew’s warning crept through my memory.

*Nine-mil won’t do much against anything bigger than a horse.*

It had been years since I’d seen an animal like this one, and even then, it had been much smaller, rooting around in a trash can on the side of a road. This thing was easily four times the size, covered in bony plates of armor, and close enough that I could hear her snuffling at the air with her big black nose. Dirt and wood chips clogged the fur around her paws from where she’d been digging for grubs, and I could smell the musk from her fur on the wind. Her yellowed teeth glinted in the light of my headlamp, both dark eyes fixed on the strange creature before her who had frightened her cub.

“Bear.” I squeaked, unable to scream, and my heart slammed to a stop in my chest.

With a deafening roar, the huge mutated black bear stormed from the thorns, ripping a nearby sapling from the ground in rage as it charged me.
