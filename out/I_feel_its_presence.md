At the time of writing this I am the age of 15.


At the time of my first encounter with it I was 7 or 8. I was at my best friend at the time “emealio’s” 8th birthday. The location of the party was located in the woods of Arkansas, near Springdale. If only I knew what I saw was real. After the cake dunking, we checked the time and it was around 8 pm. Throughout the party, the feeling of something just off in the distance of the woods.

 If only we left before we saw it.

At the entrance of the forest I noticed a figure or like a shadow off into the bank the woods. This thing, this creature was there it was disgusting. It was haunting. I don’t think it was human. The things eyes were white when us kids saw it until it opened them, it was a hollow black. That’s it, nothing, its eyes looked like an endless void. It was pale and human like. It was slumped over when it looked at us. It made a noise, like a click whilst it moved its claw like fingers in a motion, a motion to come over. I still can’t shake over the feeling of it.

When we told the adults that we saw something, in the woods, they told us to go inside. (I forgot to mention they owned a cabin nearby.) I proceeded to look out the window when one of the adults went out to examine it. But before they got to it, it scurried away.

I don’t know what I saw but I think I saw it again. Recently. 

I told my grandma about it. She said to not speak about skinwalkers. She is Cherokee but at the time I didn’t know what that meant so I looked it up on my dad’s phone. I guess I saw a skinwalker or something like a bush crawler. Maybe a rake? It’s hard to tell because my grandma doesn’t want to tell me about it.

2024. I was at my grandfathers house with two of my cousins. A year before we saw it, my cousins mom left them at my grandfathers house. I slept in the same room and for some reason one of them (tenison, yes that’s her name) locked the window and closed the blinds. I asked why and she responded with something along the lines of “so IT doesn’t see us”. I was stumped on this.
 
Next night. All three of us wanted to catch some tree frogs, I was to hold the flashlight, Tenison was to catch them and Zephren (my other cousin) to keep watch. That’s when we saw it. That fucking thing was following me across towns. I was in mountain home, that was about 150 miles away from Springdale. It was in the bush looking at us. This things mouth apeard unhinged. Its eyes black, tall and long claws. As a normal human being, I took out my phone and recorded it. The thing stood up and started walking towards us. I instantly stopped recording, launched my phone at it to try to scare it, then we ran. We ran as fast as we could, but I stopped dead in my tracks when I heard “Jack” in my mother’s voice. I’m scared to even go outside past 8 pm or before 6 am

I’m currently at my dad’s house in Clifty and I could have sworn I heard it’s click that it made when I first saw it.

I don’t know what I’m supposed to do. Please I need answers on what this thing might be.

Edit: Any ideas on what I can do? My family and I are gun owners, but I don’t know what to tell my father, “a skinwalker wants me dead, let’s kill it.” That’s not gonna work. Should I just shoot it on sight or what?
