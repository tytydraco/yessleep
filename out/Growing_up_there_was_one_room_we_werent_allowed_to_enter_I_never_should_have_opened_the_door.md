As a child, my family, Dad, my little brother Jonathan, and I, were extraordinarily lucky. Not rich-lucky. No, our house was modest and square: three bedrooms, two baths, a living room with a small red couch and Dad’s brown recliner, and a kitchen with a laundry closet and glass-paned French doors leading to the backyard.

While Dad stressed how fortunate we were to have had the house for so long, and often emphasized that it was to be passed down to me or Jonathan so that we could raise our kids “the right way,” our luck did not come from a nice family home. Not from great friends or a supportive community, either.

We weren’t lucky in the ways you can be proud of. Our luck appeared exactly when we needed it, when we were behind on rent or swamped with medical bills, but it lived in the places we’d rather not go: the piss-stained bathroom floors of public restrooms, where Dad found lost wads of cash; in the wills of distant family members we’d never met; in the incompetent minds of utility employees who sent us large refunds for money we weren’t owed

The summer I turned 10, our house was broken into and robbed while we were visiting Grandma and Grandpa out of town. The thieves took nearly everything: the living room TV, my PlayStation, even the microwave. The police dusted for fingerprints and took an inventory of everything we were missing, but they didn’t seem very confident in solving the case, and we didn’t have much hope.

When the police left, Jonathan sat between Dad and me on the couch, crying as he stared at the open space in front of the fireplace. “All our stuff!” he said between sobs. “Why would they do this?”

“It’s gonna be okay,” Dad said. “Things will work out. You know that.” He patted me on the shoulder. “Jake, why don’t you and Jonathan get ready for bed?” He gave Jonathan a hug and walked down the hallway toward the bedrooms. I put my head in my hands, and for a moment, the only sound was Dad's shoes softly thumping against the hardwood floor.

I took a deep breath. “It’ll be okay, Jon. Let’s go to bed.”

We walked past the hallway bathroom, past Dad’s room, and past the guest bedroom. As I opened the door to my and Jonathan’s room, I heard what sounded like a groan of pain coming from the guest room. I stopped in the doorway. Jonathan either didn’t hear the sound or didn’t care; he turned sideways, slipped past me, and climbed up to the top bunk.

I turned and walked toward the room. I stood next to the door and listened, but heard nothing. For a moment I considered trying the knob, but Dad would’ve killed me if he found me snooping around. That room was best to be ignored. When we did acknowledge it, it was referred to only as “The Room.” No one but Dad was allowed in The Room. He kept the door locked and the key with him at all times.

This wasn’t the first time I’d heard sounds coming from The Room, but it was usually quick, rubbery squeaks, like someone moving around in a bed. It had never been a sound of pain before. 

I stayed up worried until late in the night when I heard the door open, close, and then lock.

Early the next morning, I woke up to Jonathan yelling from the kitchen. When I went out to see what was going on, he had opened the back doors and was standing in the yard, holding his hands out as if to present a brand new car.

All of our stuff, every single item we were missing, was there. The TV and microwave were sitting safely on top of some towels, and everything else was piled neatly in large cardboard boxes. Attached to one of those boxes was a yellow sticky note with words written in red, bleeding ink:

*We’re sorry. We’re so sorry.* 

We weren’t lucky all the time, but these little miracles happened often enough to make us certain that we weren’t like other families, and for us to have a sense of unwavering hope that was sometimes as foolish as it was uplifting.

When Mom died a few weeks after my 8th birthday, we kept thinking she might just… come back. Dad continued to make two cups of coffee every morning, and for months we kept an extra chair at the table. I’m not sure we ever stopped holding our breath. 

For most of my childhood, I never gave The Room much thought. I’d grown up with it, after all, and I knew that The Room was off limits before I knew how to speak. Dad was careful not to enter The Room when anyone was around, so to me, the door that never opened might as well have been a blank wall.

But about midway through my fifth grade school year, I finally had a reason to think hard about The Room.

Jonathan and I were doing our homework at the dining room table while Dad made dinner in the kitchen. I was struggling with a long-division worksheet. Jonathan, being in 3rd grade, was working on addition and subtraction.

A few minutes into homework time, I felt a sharp poke at my side.

I turned to my left and looked at Jonathan. He was squinting hard and held his face about an inch above his worksheet, one hand holding a pencil poised to mark an answer while the other rubbed his chin.

“Don’t poke me,” I said. “I’m trying to focus.”

He jerked his head back as if broken from a trance. “What? Stop distracting me. I’m trying to do my homework.”

I sighed and shook my head, then got back to work. I was counting how many times 7 went into 49 when I felt another poke.

“Stop!” I screamed as I turned to look back at Jonathan. He was in that same pose again, but this time he was struggling to hold in a smile.

“Stop what?” 

“Poking me. I’m trying to do my homework.”

“Me too,” he said. “Stop distracting me.”

“You’re not even doing anything.”

“Yes I am!”

I grabbed the paper away from him and held it up to his face. “Then how come all the questions are already answered?”

“Give that back!” he screamed. 

He reached for the paper, and I jumped up out of his reach. He went to chase me, but as he hurried to stand, he pushed the chair he was sitting in back. It fell to the floor with a bang.

“Jake! Jonathan! What the hell was that?” Dad yelled from the kitchen. A moment later, he entered the dining room as Jonathan was frantically pushing the chair back into place. “What the hell happened?”

Jonathan stumbled on his words. “I was trying to… he took my homew-”

“He kept poking me!” I said.

“Nuh-uh!”

“He did! And I asked him to stop but he wouldn’t!”

Dad put his hands over his eyes and sighed deeply. “Be quiet and go finish your homework in your room. I don’t want to hear another peep out of either of you.”

In our room, Jonathan did everything he could to annoy me. He poked me, made farting sounds with his armpits, and sang random, annoying songs. He knew I couldn’t retaliate without getting us both in trouble. By the time Dad called us for dinner, I had about lost my patience. I just wanted some damn peace and quiet.

Dinner was meatloaf and mashed potatoes. The same recipe Mom used to make, but it was a sad imitation, like a Gordon Ramsay microwave meal. The meatloaf was slanted to one side and the potatoes were chunky. I would’ve cried if I wasn’t so angry at Jonathan.

I looked at Dad, who was funneling mashed potatoes into his mouth with one hand and scrolling on his phone with the other. I tried to think of how I could broach the subject without pissing him off. 

I considered coming right out and asking if I could sleep in the extra bedroom, but I thought he might question how I knew what was behind the door (I didn’t, really, but a bedroom seemed like a sure enough guess). Then, I considered simply asking what was in The Room. But what if he thought I was being too nosy? Finally, I decided that my best bet was to feign innocence, present my problem, and hope that he offered a solution.

“I really wish we had an extra bedroom,” I said, then glanced up at him.

He was staring straight at me, eyes narrow and his mouth a flat line. “Sarcastic little shit,” he grumbled.

“No, I just… wish I had my own room… for homework.”

“You can’t have The Room,” he said. 

“What’s wrong with it?” Jonathan asked.

“Don’t question me,” Dad said. “No more questions.”

“What’s so bad about asking?” I asked.

He breathed hard out of his nose and gave me a look that said *enough.* “Someone lives in that room. We can’t disturb them.”

“No one lives in there!” Jonathan argued. “Where do they go to the bathroom? When do they eat?”

“Yeah,” I said. “We’ve never seen them. Dad, you're lying to us. You just don’t want me to have my own room.”

As soon as I said the words, I regretted them. Dad stood up and grabbed me by the arm, jerking me to my feet. “Come with me.”

I followed him down the hallway and into his bedroom.

“Lay down on the bed.”

I understood what that meant even before I heard him undoing his belt. He’d spanked me plenty of times before, but it never really hurt *that* bad. As long as I made sure to cry after the 3rd or 4th hit, he’d usually stop pretty quickly.

But the first hit was as loud as thunder and stung like a strike of lightning. It was harder than he’d ever hit me before. For a moment my vision went black. He hit me again and again until I was screaming over and over. “I’m sorry! I’m sorry!”

When he was done he wouldn’t even look at me. He just stared straight ahead at the wall. “Go to your room,” he said. “You can finish your dinner in the morning.”

A few minutes later, as I laid in bed and tried not to put too much weight on my butt, I heard more loud whacks of Dad’s belt. Then, Jonathan came in and climbed up to his bed. As I tried to sleep, I could hear him quietly crying.



In the weeks following that night, none of us mentioned The Room. However, it was on my mind almost constantly, and more than once I found Jonathan standing in the hallway, staring at the locked door. As much as Dad scared us that night, he only made us more interested in The Room. What could be so bad that simply asking about it made Dad act like that? I wanted so badly to know, but I couldn’t risk asking again.



Still, I couldn’t get it out of my head. I was distracted at school, and Jonathan and I were both less talkative at home. Dad began to act distant. He was less interested in our days, and oftentimes our dinner was peanut butter and jelly sandwiches instead of a home-cooked meal. I began to think that we crossed a line that we couldn’t uncross, and that things would never be the same again.



I started having this recurring dream about The Room. I’d wake up in the middle of the night, and there would be this red glow coming from under the door. I’d step into the hallway and see that The Room’s door was open. I’d walk inside and the door would close behind me, so hard that a gust of wind would knock me on my ass.



All of a sudden the walls would lower themselves into the ground, revealing a stadium full of spectators. That’s when I’d realize that the room had turned into a stage. Everyone was pointing at me and laughing. I’d get up and try to run but now the door was gone and I was hundreds of feet in the air. The laughter would get louder and louder until I had to cover my ears and scream.



I’d wake up sweaty and breathless. Sometimes, I’d go check to make sure that the door to The Room was still closed. In the faint glow of the hallway's blue nightlight, I could almost imagine that I was looking into the darkness of The Room. Other times, I’d lay awake in bed until morning.



The first few times it happened, Jonathan asked me if I was okay. But after a while, he stopped bothering. He wasn’t sleeping too well either. More than once, I’d woken up to him crying. Sometimes his eyes were bloodshot in the morning. He played hooky on a few of those days.



As scary as these dreams were, during the waking hours they only reassured me that whatever was in The Room was important. They only made me more curious, like The Room was calling to me. One day, in the middle of the night, I heard Jonathan gasp awake. 



“Are you okay?” I asked.



He was quiet for a moment, then he took a deep breath. “Nightmare.”



“Was it about The Room?”



“Yes,” he said. “There’s a monster in there. A dragon… it breathed fire and it… it was going to eat me.”



“Nothing’s going to eat you. Maybe we should go see what’s really in there. It can’t be that bad. Dad wouldn’t let it stay if it was… he’d do something about it. He’d protect us.”



“Dad would kill us!”



“We can get in without Dad knowing. We just need the right plan.”



So we stayed up for the rest of the night bouncing ideas off each other.



Our first idea was to sneak into Dad’s room while he was sleeping. We’d grab the key, then Jonathan and I would unlock the door to The Room, go in, take a look around, and put the key back before Dad realized it was missing.



The problem was the risk. We’d have to open the door without waking Dad up. Then, without any light, we’d have to sneak around searching for the key, which could be anywhere. We might trip over something, Dad might hear us opening a drawer… most likely, we’d end up getting spanked and grounded. Then Dad would be even more careful about keeping us out of The Room.



We had a few more stupid ideas like pick-pocketing the key and putting it back in Dad’s pocket before he noticed or picking the lock with toothpicks and Q-tips. Everything seemed either too risky or too ridiculous. 



I was half asleep and had about given up when I finally had a real eureka moment. “Jon,” I said. “I think I got it.”



One thing Dad always got on to Jonathan and I for was not playing outside enough. He said that we were missing out on “what childhood is supposed to be like.” In an effort to fix this, he’d bought us a trampoline one summer. We played on it every now and then, and sometimes Dad would join us. Whenever he did, he always emptied his pockets and put everything on the grass in front of the trampoline. All we had to do was get him on the trampoline, and one of us could grab the key while he was distracted. Then, we could go unlock the door, peek inside, and put the key back before he noticed.



The only problem was that, since one of us would have to stay on the trampoline with Dad, we wouldn’t both be able to see The Room.



Jonathan pitched in with the solution. He said that he’d seen the key to The Room before. According to him, the mail key and the key to The Room were almost identical. If we could switch them out, Dad would be none the wiser until he tried to use one of the keys.



So the final plan was simple. Jonathan would ask Dad to go play on the trampoline with us. While Dad and Jonathan were going outside, I’d say that I needed to use the bathroom. Then, I’d grab the mail key, go outside, and switch it out for the key to The Room. Because we’d make sure to ask him to the trampoline *after* he checked the mail, Dad wouldn’t notice the key had been switched until the next day. This would give us all night to look around The Room. After we were done exploring, we’d put the key back in the drawer where the mail key was kept. Whenever Dad noticed the keys were mixed up, he would assume that it was his mistake. 



After dinner the next day, Dad went to check the mail while Jonathan and I tag-teamed the dishes.



“What if we get caught?” Jonathan asked. “We’ll be in big trouble.”



He was squirming around and his face was turning red. I started to fear that he was going to get us busted.



“We’re gonna be fine,” I said. “Don’t worry. I’m the one taking all the risk. All you have to do is play on the trampoline. Even if we get caught, I’ll take all the blame.”



That calmed him down, and by the time Dad came back in with the usual bills and junk mail, Jonathan was fine. I watched as Dad put the mail key back in the drawer. 



A few minutes later, Jonathan asked Dad if he wanted to go play on the trampoline. Dad’s eyes lit up. I could tell that he was tired, but he also wanted to encourage us. He said he’d play for a few minutes.



I almost felt bad as I stood in the bathroom and waited to hear the sound of the back doors closing. But when they did, I put my game face on.



I walked to the kitchen, fished the mail key out of the drawer, and dropped it into the right zip-up pocket of my sweatpants. I peeked out the back doors to see that Dad and Jonathan were already jumping on the trampoline and throwing a football back and forth. Dad’s stuff was in a haphazard pile in the grass.



I stepped outside and walked to the trampoline. I’d strategically worn my tall lace-up vans to give myself an excuse for taking so long to untie my shoes. When I reached Dad’s pile, I bent down and began sorting through it.



From the angle of the trampoline, Dad wouldn’t be able to see me unless he walked right up to the edge and looked straight down. Even so, I was terrified as I looked through his things. I felt that he was going to look down at me any second. Every time a bounce was a little too close, I was sure he was about to bust me.



I went through everything: I checked underneath his wallet, to the left and right of his phone, but the key didn’t seem to be in the pile. I began to panic. I was reaching a hand into each of his shoes when I heard the rattle of the trampoline poles. Someone had crashed into the net above me. I looked up expecting to see Dad, but instead I caught sight of Jonathan as he stood up from making a diving catch. He jumped back toward the middle of the trampoline, and I breathed a sigh of relief.



I put my head in my hands and tried to control my breath. Where else could the key be? I only had another few seconds before Dad would get suspicious and I’d have to get up. I was shifting through everything one last time when an epiphany hit me so hard I almost slapped myself in the face. *His wallet! I haven’t checked his wallet!*



I opened the wallet and immediately felt the bulge of the key. I dug my fingers into the pockets until I felt the cool metal. I pulled it out with one hand and reached into my own pocket for the mail key with the other.

Looking at the keys next to each other, they weren’t as identical as Jonathan had led me to believe. They were both a yellowish grey and roughly the same size, but the key to The Room was darker, a little rusty, and much heavier. I was sure that Dad was going to notice the difference immediately. For a moment, I considered giving up on the plan, but I told myself that, even if Dad noticed right away, he’d probably blame himself. 



I put the key in my pocket, zipped it shut, and inserted the mail key into the wallet. I loosened my shoes as quickly as I could and climbed up on the trampoline.



When we were done playing, Dad watched a movie on the couch while Jonathan and I played War with a deck of cards in our room. We played in almost complete silence. When I won my third game in a row, I didn’t brag, and Jonathan didn’t even complain or accuse me of cheating. 



“I can go in alone if you want,” I said after a while.



“No! I want to see The Room.”



“Are you scared?”



“No,” he said, but he wouldn’t look me in the eyes.



“Are you scared of Dad finding out, or are you scared of what’s in there?”



“I don’t know.”



Around 9:00 PM, Dad told us to get ready for bed. As instructed, Jonathan did his usual complaints and asked for a few extra minutes. Dad shut him down, and Jonathan gave up without much of a fight. That was fine, Dad seemed exhausted anyway.



We took showers, brushed our teeth, and got into bed. Around 9:30 we heard Dad go into his room. Jonathan wouldn’t stop fidgeting above me. A few times he was so loud that I expected Dad to open the door and tell us to cut it out. 



Jonathan asked about a dozen times if we could go yet, but I was firm and insisted on waiting until midnight. By then, Jonathan was sitting on the floor next to my bed.



“Okay,” I said. “Let’s go.”



“Okay,” he said with a shaky breath.



I opened our door as quietly as I could and stepped into the hallway. When I stopped to take a peek at Dad’s room, Jonathan bumped into me and I gasped in surprise.



“Shh,” he said. “You’re gonna wake him up.”



“Shut up.”



I walked up to Dad’s room and put my ear against his door. He was snoring.



“He’s asleep,” I said. “Let’s go.”



I took the key out of my pocket and approached The Room. I was about to unlock the door when Jonathan put a hand on my arm.



“The door knob,” he whispered.



“What?”



“It might be hot, remember… the dragon…”



“Yeah,” I said. “Okay.”



I went to feel it with the back of my hand, but at the last second Jonathan pulled me away and softly touched the knob himself. 



“It’s okay,” he said.



“Why’d you have to feel it?” I asked.



He tilted his head at me. “So you wouldn’t get burned.”



“Okay,” I said, and smiled. “Let’s do this.”



I put the key into the knob and was surprised at how easily it unlocked. I’d expected something to happen at the last minute. That Dad would come storming out of his room and stop us, or that we had the wrong key, or that the room simply wouldn’t open, but no… there was the click of the lock, and then the door was open. The Room was ready to be entered.



I nodded at Jonathan and, finally, pushed the door open.



The nightlight revealed only the closest edge of The Room, but from the little I could see, it appeared as though The Room was much older than the rest of the house. The carpet was a yellower, uglier shade of grey. There was the same white-textured wall, but it was chipped at places, revealing light brown splotches of old plaster.

I could make out the shadow of the only object in the room. In the back right corner was the shape of a bed. On top of it was a person.

“Wh-what?” I said as my breath caught in my throat. 

Jonathan gasped like a breathless old man.

Without turning, I reached for the light switch and dragged my hand across the wall until I found it. The light was dim but bright enough for me to make out the rest of the room. All dirty carpet and old walls. There was nothing but the bed and the figure on top of it. The figure that appeared to be a rotting corpse.

Jonathan started crying. He bumped against the wall as he backpedaled out of the room. “Jake, please, let’s just leave!”

His voice sounded muffled, as if he were calling to me from a different world. In a slow process that seemed somehow to be against my will, I walked toward the bed until I was close enough to see that the body was, actually, a female doll about five-feet tall. She was lying on blue sheets atop a small bed with a wooden frame.

Her skin was a moldy off-white, wrinkled and cut at random. Her hair was gray, each strand of varying length. Some barely reached her ears, others stretched down to her chin. She wore a dusty green dress patterned with thin white flowers. As if ripped away by an assailant, the bottom of the dress was cut unevenly, showing about six inches of thin legs and rotten skin above her knees. Each of her unblinking, lifeless eyes were a pool of milky white, a black orb the size of a penny floating in the middle. Those eyes sat an inch outside of her skull, popping out like the eyes of a cheap stress toy. Her mouth was nothing but a thin line cut into the skin. Where her nose should have been was simply two deep holes, one an inch higher than the other, as if the dollmaker had simply stabbed his thumbs into her skin until it punctured. 

I stood studying the doll, heart thundering in my chest. *Why does Dad keep this in here? Why is this secret so important? What does he do with it?*

I reached out to touch it. Maybe some secret would be revealed by the rough texture of the skin… but when my hand was only an inch away from its arm, something miraculous and terrifying happened. Her face turned to me, so quickly that the bed squeaked in response. A voice came from her still-closed mouth.

“Young ones,” she said, “which one of you am I going to enjoy tonight?” Her voice was raspy as if from disuse, but she spoke quickly and hissed like a snake.

Jonathan ran to our room and slammed the door shut. 

“Must be you, sweetie,” her thin, decaying neck began to elongate, stretching toward me, uncoiling like a thick rope as her face got closer and closer. When she was almost to biting distance her lips parted until they became a hole that stretched from her chin to her nose. A hole which was filled not with teeth, but with soft pink gum.

When she reached me her mouth closed quickly down, wet lips wrapping around my hand. Her tongue wiggled against my skin, tickling me in a way that made it difficult not to vomit. I tried as hard as I could to pull away, but she was too strong. My shoulder felt like it might pop out of place. She went deeper and deeper until she had taken me up to the girthiest part of my forearm. She pulled me onto the bed so hard that I fell on her stomach and my entire arm slipped inside her. The sharp bone of my elbow made a bulge in her neck.

Her grip loosened, and I pulled my arm out of her mouth with a wet *pop*. I tried to stand, but her legs wrapped around my back and she pulled me hard until our bodies were pressed flat against each other.

“Almost there, honey,” she said, and began to moan in a hoarse, excited voice.

I pushed against the bed as hard as I could, but I couldn’t budge an inch. She arched her back and pushed her body against mine. I closed my eyes and cried.

Just when I was sure she was going to kill me, I heard the patter of footsteps on the floor. There was a grunt, and I opened my eyes to see Jonathan jumping knee first onto the doll’s head.

“Agh!” She cried. Her grip on my back loosened. I rolled off the bed and onto the floor with a heavy thump.

Jonathan and I ran out the door, and I slammed it shut. Even once the door was locked, I braced myself and pulled the knob as hard as I could with both hands. 

Dad spoke from behind us.

“Jonathan! Jake! Oh Jesus Christ, what have you done?”

I couldn’t answer; my breath hitched in my throat. I remembered the way the doll’s mouth had closed over me, the feeling that she might swallow me whole. I still felt her body pushing against mine; I could hear the way she moaned when we touched.

I began sobbing, and as if an alarm had gone off, Jonathan cried out. “She tried to eat him! She was going to eat him!”

I ran to Dad and hugged him as hard as I could. He wrapped his arms around me, Jonathan ran to join us and we all held tight against each other.

“I… I can fix this,” Dad said. “Just, please… don’t ever go in there again,” he pulled away and looked each of us in the eyes. “Promise me.”

“Why do you keep her in there?” I asked between sobs.

“We need to kill her!” Jonathan cried.

“No,” Dad said. “Promise me you won’t ever go in there again.”

“We promise,” I said.

“Uh-huh,” Jonathan said. “We promise.”

“There’s something you need to understand,” Dad said, and then told us everything.

The doll’s name is Janice. Dad isn’t sure exactly when she became a part of our family, but she’s lived in that room since even before his great grandparents were born. He said that Janice was a good thing. *Good* for our family. She helped us when we needed it. She was the reason for our good luck, the reason we were always okay. She only asked for a few things, and as long as we gave her what she wanted, we’d be happy. More than happy. But if we didn’t give her what she wanted… well, according to Dad, that explained what happened to Mom.

It was in the middle of summer and we were planning on moving soon. All of our stuff was getting packed up, and our house was full of boxes. Dad knew that Jonathan and I were bummed, so he took us to an Astros game to cheer us up. Mom didn’t like big events, so she stayed at home to keep packing. 

It was a great game. Constant lead changes, back and forth all the way. The score was tied at 4-4 going into the bottom of the 9th, and the Astros won in the most miraculous way: a walk-off walk.

The whole crowd cheered. Dad, Jonathan, and I hugged each other and couldn’t stop laughing. We stopped for ice cream on the way home, and I remember being so shocked that Dad wasn’t in a rush to get to bed. It was nearly 11:00 and he almost never stayed up past 9:00. He was so happy. I didn’t want the night to end. 

We got home and were already calling for Mom as we walked through the front door. We were so excited to tell her about the game. 

We were only a couple of steps into the house when I realized something was wrong. Dad and I went quiet, but Jonathan continued to laugh and call, “Mom! Mom!”

“Shut up!” I snapped at him as we walked toward the kitchen. His voice was suddenly anxiety-inducing, like the sound could set off an avalanche. 

The kitchen faucet was running, but as loud as we had been calling her name, Mom wasn’t coming.

“Something’s burning,” Dad said. I followed behind him as he ran into the kitchen and toward the stove. Something was on fire and exuding a thick black smoke. He turned off the burner and started whacking the pan with a hand towel. 

After a few repetitions, his hand caught the pan and he groaned in pain. I turned in a circle around the kitchen, trying to find something, anything, I could use to help. Finally, I spotted an oven mitt on the kitchen table. I was running toward it when Jonathan screamed.

“Mom!”

I turned to find him pointing at the open laundry closet. From my angle I could only see a pool of blood and a few strands of blonde hair. I ran into the room and dropped to my knees in front of Mom. I tried desperately to shake her awake, but her skin was pale and her body was still.

Dad was right behind me. He screamed Mom’s name, then pulled out his phone and called the police. The three of us held her and cried over her body until the ambulance arrived. Mom was pronounced dead on scene. They said it was a freak accident. She just slipped and hit her head.

We had a funeral and did all the usual things that come after a death, but we didn’t move away like we had planned to. Somehow, Dad must’ve gotten out of whatever deal he had for selling the house. Over time, we unpacked our stuff and put it all back where it belonged.

I never understood why we decided not to move. Not until the night I met Janice.

Dad said, sitting in the hallway outside of The Room, that Janice was not happy about the move. When she found out that we were leaving, bad things started to happen. It started off small, a few scraped knees here and there, but when nothing Janice did changed our minds, she decided to make an example.

“But how do you know it was her?” I asked.

“*It was*,” Dad said. “But listen. She is a *good* thing for us. As long as we do what she says, as long as we listen, she will keep us happy, healthy, and safe. Nothing bad has to happen ever again. What happened to Mom… it was my fault. It wasn’t Janice’s.”

“What?” I said. “What do you mean it wasn’t Janice’s fault? You just said she killed Mom!”

“I pushed her,” he said. “She's good for us. *Good!*”

“Then why did you try to move?” I asked. “If everything is good, then why did you try to escape?”

“I–” his eyes fell to the floor, and for the first time I thought that he looked like an old man. “It doesn’t matter,” he said, and forced a smile. [“We are a lucky, happy family.”](https://www.reddit.com/user/ConnorIsaacWriter/comments/1poetct/thanks_for_reading/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
