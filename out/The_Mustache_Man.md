WARNING: Child Abduction + Implied Cannibalism 


When I was in second grade, I got abducted by the Mustache Man.

It was a regular Friday around October, I remember the morning of that Friday extremely well, from my mom packing up my lunch, to her putting my homework in my Disney branded backpack, and then her tying my shoes. She told me to remember to go in the car dismissal line, the line where kids would get picked up by car, as me and a childhood friend of mine, Zuri would have a play date/sleepover together that night, and that Zuri’s Dad was going to pick us up.

Me and Zuri were in the same class together since pre-k, but when our class had a swap in September, we got split up. Only occasionally meeting during Recess or PE. After the school day ended, the Principal announced on the schools intercom; “Car Rider students you are now dismissed”. Me and a few other students walked out into the hallway, and towards the administrators near the exit gate. I stood next to Mrs. DeMarco, looking for Zuri’s Dad to pop out of the crowds of parents, shuffling from the parking lot and onto the sidewalk/grass behind it.

Then I heard; “Claire, Claire!”, I looked over to find a man waving at me as he walked towards the gate. He was tall, sort of had a hunchback, with a round face and long thin legs, with exception of his torso and arms being somewhat muscular. His hair was stylized, a blading combover, with a long mustache and goatee.

He greeted himself as Zuri’s Uncle, Daniel; stating that he was there to pick us up. I gave Mrs. DeMarco the thumbs up, in which she asked “Where is he baby?”. I pointed towards Uncle Daniel, he waved as a single, and she dismissed me. I ran towards him, which he grabbed my arm really tight and roughly, and led me through the crowds of distracted parents. I asked him “Wait, what about Zuri?”, he replied with a in a quick indescribable shutter, his walking speed matching his alien language. 

It was extremely hard to keep up with him, especially since he was practically dragging me through purses, hands, and with my backpack, getting caught between those things. He explained that his brother; Zuri’s Dad was working late, and since her parents only shared a car, he called Uncle Daniel to pick us up and take us home. It was only until we got into the car when I realized the gigantic red flag in the middle. “Where’s Zuri?”.

The man turned to me, sitting alone in his back seat, painted with a face of confusion. Smiling as he told me; “I already picked up Zuri from school, she at my sister’s house. Y’know her mom’s house.” 

“My sister’s”? I thought her dad was your brother. The old paint job of confusion, was painted over by the tones of realization, shock, and fear; followed by another internal realization of mine; “Both of Zuri’s parents are black, if he’s her dad’s brother, why is he white?”

I was a pretty shy and gullible kid, still am, but not as much as I used to be, but back then I wouldn’t talk to people I didn’t know, especially if it was adults. But the more I sat, the more I thought about it, the more I thought about it, the more I began to figuratively slap myself in the forehead, thinking how stupid I was for believing in such a bold face lie.

For the whole drive the mustache man, talked about his days in elementary and as a kid, not once mentioning Zuri’s Parents. He asked me about my day, if I had any tests, what I ate, if I had a crush on anyone, overall normal stuff if you were talking to a guardian or parent, but not a complete stranger. The drive took around 30 minutes, which for our district zoning, is like driving to a complete different school zone.

For reference at the time my house was 5 minutes away, and Zuri’s was roughly 13 minutes away from the school. I looked out the window to find myself in an area I wasn’t used to, if I remember correctly it was a cul-de-sac with brick houses, trees with no leaves, and huge spaces between the houses. He led me inside, and shut the door behind me, it was really dark inside, with the only source of light being presumably in the living room, dim and yellow. 

He looked at me and smiled noticing the clear fear and nervousness on my face, I asked “W-where’s Zuri?” With a tremble in my voice. His smile was hidden by the palm of his hand and in a muffled voice stated, “Oh. She’s probably downstairs playing with some toys.” He then walked in-front of me, squatted down, and said “Wait right here, I’ll go get her.” Before tapping his finger on my nose “Boop!”, and exiting to a nearby room.

I heard a door open, and the sound of dress shoes creaking on old wood, to then clicking on concrete. I knew I was in some sort of trouble…no…some sort of danger, I sped-walked to the door and tried to open it, only to be met without a single budge. My heart began to beat even faster, my once full of hope heart, being a victim of genocide from panic, but like a refugee, hope was still alive. Hope that Zuri would show up from the basement, or if her Dad would walk in, or if my mom would pick me up.

But, just because I had hope, doesn’t mean my chances would change for the good. I regretted going inside, I regretted getting inside the car, I regret telling Mrs. DeMarco that he was the one, I regret going to school that day, I regretted not listening to my mom.

I didn’t notice my tears hugging my eyes for comfort, but I did notice one thing. A house phone connected to the wall, I quickly walked towards the phone, but it was over the counter, I found one of the dinner table chairs and pulled it out to reach the phone. I picked the phone off its receiver, and dialed 911. It ranged, and ranged, and -beedeep-!

“911, what is your emergency?”

I replied in a whisper, “Help me, I was kidnapped. I-I don’t know where I am, and I wanna go home…” Even as a kid, I thought “how pathetic of me” those weren’t the words I thought, but it was the feeling I felt, it was disappointment, it was shame, it was fear. That was all she needed, without hanging up I hid the phone on top of the holder instead of inserting it correctly, hurried everything back in place before the Mustache Man could return.

I already heard his loud footsteps coming up stairs, he yelled “Claire, come down here, Zuri’s here.” I didn’t respond. “Claire?!?!”, footsteps rushed upstairs at a steady crescendo, walking into the kitchen to see if I was still there.

“You alright?”

“C-can I leave…?” I asked in a hushed tone, like I was called answer to a question I didn’t know how to solve. Have you ever seen a mask fully fall in real time?

His jolly, yet creepy, mall Santa curled smile, fall into an emotionless expression, he realized I wasn’t falling for it anymore, maybe that’s what took the fun outta it for him. He slowly walked towards me, putting on a more gentle, yet less convincing mask, like a grandparent walking to greet you, till he was close enough to grab me by my hair, and aggressively pull me towards the basement.

I screamed and cried, “Please let me go, please!”, he screamed back “I’ll stop if you behave, and stop acting like a little bitch.” So, I listened. He then grabbed me by my hand, and gently guided me towards the basement, I didn’t notice until I was halfway down, that the door behind me shut, and clicked with a lock. I turned my head at the now shut door, and turned back to descend further down. 

The basement was unfinished, it had a boiler in the corner, a single support beam in the middle, a big blue curtain that covered a corner of the room, and had a depressing yellow glow, that I learned was possible by the sunset. It was the kind of room you could imagine where a creep would put kids in. I could hear everything in that room, from his footsteps to the loud munching sounds that came from his chips.

I don’t know how long I was down there, probably for a while since the orangish hue, became a dark-brightish blue. But eventually I heard a set of three bangs coming from the front door, I held my mouth with my hands to keep it shut, I wanted to scream so bad, but with the chances of them not hearing due to the many layers of walls, I wanted to save my scream until I knew for sure they could hear me.

I heard the Mustache Man’s TV stop playing, his chair squeaking like leather, the silence was deafening, 3 more sets of knocking and doorbell ringing, until I heard a loud boom, followed by multiple pairs of stomping.

It was right then and there when I removed my hands and screamed like never before, until my lungs burned, and I ran out of oxygen. The basement door was broken down, with an officer holding a flashlight towards me, and another carrying me out from the dungeon. At least three cop cars showed up, followed by a news anchor van. 

The officers placed me on the backseat of the police car with a blanket, in which I had to provide them with all the details I could remember. Officers searched the entire house for the mustache man, with K-9 units attempting to sniff him out, but they couldn’t find him. When my parents arrived from the scene my mother ran to me bawling her eyes out. Her face was puffy, red, and smudged with runny makeup. The officers investigated more into the house and found behind the curtain was a “movie set” with pictures of other missing children crossed out, and with other photos of children not yet crossed out, suspected to be other targets.

Before you ask, no it wasn’t that kind of movie set, it was a table with hacksaw’s, hammers, restraints, and other medical supplies. And, in his freezer, there were the remains of his victims, “Jacob Jerky”, “Francis Angus Beef”, “Samantha’s Pie”, “Brandon’s Creamy Red Ice Cream: Now With Eye Chips” and finally an empty container called “Fried Clarie-Ken Nuggets”. Complete. Sick. Fuck.

Obviously this had token both a toll on me and my parents mental health, and received counseling for it, provided completely free, without charge by the Public Schools District. Every now and then, I think back of The Mustache Man, I wondered if he’ll comeback for me, but judging by his most recent victims, safe to say I’m most likely in the clear, but if he does survive that long, and he’s still watching me, I’ll make sure to never have kids, until he dies.
