Day Two

When I say I didn’t sleep that first night, I’m not exaggerating. I turned in early (just to get away from the both of them), and listened through the wall as Dylan tucked the boy in. I had found Gus cowering underneath our bed, and he lay next to me, wide-eyed and alert. When Dylan finally came in, he climbed into bed without saying a word and rolled over so his back was facing me.

It was like a slap in the face. No matter what happened—communication breakdown, minor argument, major fight—it didn’t matter, we talked before bed every night and fell asleep holding hands. Not that night. I didn’t understand his anger. But maybe I wasn’t looking at it from his perspective. If we DID have a child at some point and he’d gone missing, wouldn’t I be angry at Dylan if the child returned and he was acting like he wasn’t happy about it? Like he had no recollection of ever having a child. Wouldn’t I feel frustrated and confused?

A quiet sob shook through me. Talking to my mom had made things so much worse. Now I could no longer blame Dylan’s confusion solely on him. My own mother asked about the boy. Talked about his return excitedly. She even asked when she could come see him. It was more and more looking like I was losing my mind, that I’d scrubbed out all evidence of the boy because I couldn’t handle it when he disappeared. How else did you explain the pictures in the living room?

Deep down in the pit of my stomach, another thought poked at me. Maybe NEITHER of us was losing our minds. The boy’s dark soulless eyes and wide grin plagued me as I lay in bed. The hours ticked by, Gus by my side, as I thought about the possibility that my initial reaction to seeing the boy was the only explanation.

He was evil. And he’d come here to destroy us.

At some point, I drifted off. I woke with a start, feeling a deep vibrating against my side. It took a minute to realize that it was Gus, crouched down low next to me, growling at the door. I struggled to sit up, peering through the dark as my eyes adjusted. Dylan had left the door open (I assumed in case the boy needed us), and dark shadows pulsed beyond the doorframe.

“Hello?” I whispered. “Is someone there?”

Dylan snored quietly beside me, completely oblivious to my insomnia and the agitated dog. I squinted, then nearly screamed. A dark silhouette stood in the doorway, dark glittering orbs unblinking, staring at me.

“What do you need?” I asked, my voice high-pitched.

The boy didn’t answer. Gus let out another growl that rumbled deep in his chest. The orbs flickered from my face to Gus. A hissing sound cut through the silence, and Gus let out a little yelp, burying himself beneath the blankets. The boy’s eyes swung back to my face. I was pinned in place by the stare. Waves of malintent washed over me, shaking me to my very core. What did this boy want from us? Why was he here? Why US?

We were locked in a staring match for more than ten minutes, then I blinked and he was gone. Like he was never there in the first place. I was tempted to get out of bed and check to see if he was in bed, sleeping, but fuck that. Gus’ reaction was enough to tell me that I hadn’t imagined it. I knew one thing. I was NOT going to live like this. In the morning, I’d take Gus, pack a bag, and get the hell out of there.

But what about Dylan?

I couldn’t leave him behind. He was wrapped up in this delusion, but it wasn’t his fault. He needed my help to see that this boy wasn’t our child. If I left him alone with the boy, there was no telling what would happen to him. I couldn’t just abandon my husband, my best friend, even if he wasn’t himself at that moment. He needed me. I needed to figure out what was going on.

When the watery gray light of dawn filtered around the edges of the curtains, I pulled myself out of bed. The house was silent, save for the quiet snoring coming from Dylan’s side of the bed. I felt a tug on my nightshirt as I slid my feet into my slippers. Gus had clamped his teeth down on the corner of my shirt and was trying to keep me there.

“Its okay, buddy,” I whispered, patting his head. “Release. Release, bud, it’s okay.”

He finally opened his mouth and let go of my shirt, but looked up at me with big, round pleading eyes. He was trembling, and I felt awful leaving him, but I had work to do. Walking into the hallway, I heard the thump of Gus jumping down from the bed, and tentative steps following me out into the kitchen. He let out a whine and glanced at the front door.

“Wanna go out?”

He hadn’t come out at all last night, so I was sure his bladder was close to bursting. I grabbed his leash, slipped on my crocs, and opened the door. Before I could hook the leash to his collar, Gus jumped up and slammed his paws into the screen door, pushing down on the handle. The door flew open and Gus took off running before I could react. By the time I made it out onto the front steps, he was nowhere in sight.

“Gus!” I screamed, holding his leash helplessly in my hand. But he was gone. He was probably safer on the streets than here. I didn’t like the way the boy looked at him. Besides, I couldn’t hold it against him, could I? How many times had I thought about doing that exact same thing over the last 24 hours? I hoped he’d be alright. The thought of him being out there all alone made tears well up in my eyes. Of course, I’d go look for him, but I didn’t expect to find him. Not while the boy was still around.

“Hey, what’s all the screaming?”

I turned to see Dylan standing in the doorway, rubbing his eyes. “Gus,” I said. “He ran away.”

“What? Why didn’t you catch him?” he asked, accusation in his voice.

“H-he was too fast,” I said, closing the door. “He was gone by the time I got out there.”

Dylan shrugged. “I’m sure he’ll come back. Is Logan up yet?”

“I have no idea,” I said, moving back into the kitchen to put some coffee on.

“So you’re going to continue with this charade?”

I whipped around. “What charade?”

“This game you’re playing where you’re pretending you don’t remember our son.”

“It’s not a game, it’s the truth,” I snapped. I was tired of pretending. I was tired of the accusations and the guilt trips. I probably shouldn’t have said it, but I was so freaking tired.

“If that’s the truth, Lyss, we might need to go talk to someone,” Dylan said quietly.

“Oh, fuck off,” I snarled, pouring myself a cup of coffee.

“That’s a new one,” Dylan said, only slightly taken aback. “I have to go in to work today, by the way.”

A shock of fear jolted through me. “It’s Saturday!”

“I left work early yesterday, remember?” Dylan asked. “I have some things to wrap up.”

I did NOT want to be left alone with that THING. But it would give me some time to try and figure out what was going on. Some of you have suggested in the comments that I look up various types of supernatural or sinister beings, and that’s exactly what I had already planned on doing. I was no idiot. I’ve watched all the horror movies and read all the books. Asking for permission to come in, those dark creepy eyes, the monotone voice—something was off with that kid, I just didn’t know what. And what kind of being could inject memories of itself into people, anyway?

Maybe the better question was, why didn’t he inject them into me, too? Why leave me out of the loop to spiral, when he could have come home to two parents with memories of him, who were happy to have him back home?

Once Dylan left, the boy wandered out of the guest bedroom, still wearing the clothes we picked him up in. He stared at me sitting at the dining room table, unblinking.

“Are you hungry?” I finally asked.

“Where’s Gus?”

“Gone,” I said, glancing at the front door.

“Where’s Dad?”

“He had to go to work for a bit,” I said. “Are you hungry?”

There was a slick of red on the side of the boy’s mouth. He reached up with a pale hand and wiped it away. “I already ate.”

I frowned, knowing fully well he hadn’t, but I didn’t want to even THINK about what it was he thought he’d eaten. “Can you change out of those clothes? We need to go to the library.”

“Why?” the boy asked.

“Because I need some books,” I said, losing my patience.

“I don’t want to.”

I stood from the table and marched into the guest bedroom. The social worker at the police station had given us some spare clothing in the boy’s size, since we obviously didn’t have anything at home. Just to tide us over until we could get to the store. I rummaged around in the bag, then pulled out a fresh pair of jeans and a red polo shirt. I waved them at the boy.

“Put these on.”

“I said, I don’t want to go.”

I sighed. “I can’t leave you here alone, for Christ’s sake—”

The boy recoiled, hissing at me from between his teeth. “No!”

“Look,” I said, changing tactics. “If you go with me to the library, I’ll take you to the store after and buy you anything you want.”

The boy tilted his head. “Anything?”

I swallowed. “Yes…anything. Just get dressed, please.”

At the library, I sent the boy over to the children’s area where storytime was going on. I watched as he sat on the floor crossed-legged on the outskirts of the circle of other children, then I hurried to the section of the library where I would find books on folklore, cryptids and the like. I pulled book after book off the shelves and thumbed through them.

Nothing about the boy’s appearance in our lives seemed to match up with the creatures I was finding in the books. A changeling was close, but that was a replacement for a child that was taken by a fairy or a troll or something. This child wasn’t a replacement. He never existed in the first place. WHAT was he?! Frustration coiled inside my stomach.

When storytime ended, a line of parents and children shuffled out of the library. I glanced over at the children’s section and saw there were a few stragglers—parents and kids looking at books or playing with toys. The boy still sat on the carpet, hands planted on his knees, starting straight ahead.

I needed to find something, anything, before he got restless. AND before Dylan realized we’d left the house. I opened up a book on urban legends and was thumbing through it when a shrill scream cut though the air. There was a commotion over in the children’s area.

“Shit,” I said, throwing the book aside. I jumped up from my chair and rushed across the room, rounding the corner. There was a group of parents—all clearly upset—standing between the boy and a little girl in a pink dress.

“Whose kid is this?” someone asked, looking around.

“Hi, mine, sorry, what happened?” I asked breathlessly.

A woman pointed to the little girl, who had lines of tears streaming down her cheeks and red marks on her neck. “Your son was CHOKING my daughter!”

My mouth dropped open. I grabbed the boy roughly by the shoulder. “Why did you do that?”

He looked up at me. “I was reading a book and she took it from me.”

No emotion whatsoever. No remorse in his flat-toned voice. I looked at the little girl, horrified, then at her parents. “I’m so sorry.”

“You should watch your kid,” the mother snapped. “Or better yet, don’t take him out in public until he learns how to behave!”

“Yes, of course,” I said, taking hold of the boy’s hand. Just touching him made my skin prickle. But I was trying to keep up appearances. “Let’s go.”

As I dragged him away, he started laughing. A raspy, gurgly sound that made all the hairs on my arm stand on end. I looked over my shoulder. The other parents watched us go, their eyes wide, hands pressed to their mouths. The boy continued laughing all the way out to the car.

I shook him. “Stop that! What’s wrong with you?”

“She deserved it,” he answered, climbing into the back seat.

I tore out of the parking lot like a bat out of hell. Five minutes later, I turned onto our street. I could feel the boy’s eyes boring into the back of my head.

“You said you’d take me to the store,” he said. And even though his tone didn’t change, I could hear the malice behind it.

I pulled into the driveway, cut the engine, and whipped around to face him. “That was before you choked out a four-year-old at the library!”

I climbed out of the car, glancing around for any sign of Gus. Our next-door neighbor was walking around her front yard, shaking a box of treats. She waved at me absentmindedly as the boy joined me on the front walk, still bristling from being told no.

“Alyssa, dear,” the neighbor called. “You haven’t seen my cat Muffin around, have you?”

“No, is she missing?” I asked, glancing at the boy.

“I let her out early this morning and she always comes home for lunch,” she said, scratching her head. “I don’t know where she could be!”

“I’ll keep an eye out for her,” I said, cold cascading down my back. It was not unusual to see the gray tiger-striped cat wandering around our backyard. The guest bedroom looked out over the very same backyard. I looked down at the boy and he grinned.
