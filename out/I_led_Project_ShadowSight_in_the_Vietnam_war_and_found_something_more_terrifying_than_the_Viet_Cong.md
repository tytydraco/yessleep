I was a rare breed — brains that cut as sharply as instinct. 

Top of my class, always restless to learn more, spent high school and college bouncing from athletics to advanced physics, from mechanics to chemistry. I was a walking armoury of skills.

When the military got hold of me, they knew I was more than a front-line soldier.

They sent me straight to R&D—research and development. By the time I got to Vietnam, I was well beyond being a grunt; they created a “special” unit and put me in charge.

Our motto was, “It wasn’t about fighting battles. It was about controlling them.”

The unit wasn’t even on paper. 

We were called a “test squad,” and we were exactly that—a small team of operatives whose job wasn’t simply to fight the Viet Cong but to take the weapons and tactics coming out of our lab, test them in the field, and bring back whatever data we could. 

I thrived there. I was creating my own weapons and designs, using Dyacin coating, pulse tracking, hyper-reactive alloys.

We had materials to make gadgets lighter, faster, deadlier—and, at least in theory, smarter.

My first two creations changed our missions entirely.

One was called the MARS-7 - Microwave Assault Rifle System. They nicknamed it the "Spectre." Sleek, black, with cables trailing like veins. It didn't fire bullets. It fired concentrated microwave bursts. 

Silent. 

Invisible. 

It could cook a man from the inside out. No trace left behind. Just a body on the ground with the insides charred to black.

We used it on enemy radio towers, melting circuits in an instant. Trucks died in the mud, engines gutted. It could even take on tanks, burning their electronics into useless scrap. 

And when there were no machines left, the weapon turned on the soldiers. No cover could save them.

The next one was the Vortex 9B. The "Phantom Cloak." 

A patchwork of plated hexagons and fibres, designed to bend light around the wearer. 

It made soldiers vanish. Not just to the eye, but to heat sensors too. We were ghosts on the battlefield.

But it had power issues they couldn’t solve. Same with the Mars-7. Except the Mars-7 fried an operator in the field before it was pulled. 

Both tools worked—and failed—in their own ways. 

But I was proud of those inventions, and the higher-ups were pleased enough to give me more freedom, more resources.

One night, I was pulled into a room by the higher-ups and told I’d be heading something called Project ShadowSight.

The project was based on a simple request - Better night vision goggles and scopes. 

The kind that would turn the jungle’s midnight darkness into something they could control. 

Standard-issue scopes just couldn’t cut it—the dense canopy, the way the enemy blended into the shadows, it all left them too exposed. 

They needed a game-changer, something that would give them the edge at night, living like predators in the dark.

I experimented with every piece of tech I could get my hands on. I  began layering materials—liquid coatings and reflective mirrors and fresnel lens’. 

All funded and supplied by the government. 

My goal was nothing less than crafting a lens that could capture and amplify every stray photon in even the murkiest light.

I started with enhanced glass, coated with thin layers of Dyacin—an experimental compound with an impressive refractive index. It amplified light like nothing else but had a nasty habit of fracturing under pressure.

So I kept digging.

With each round of testing, I refined my formula. I added microscopic deposits of red mercury, which, although unstable, created a wavelength shift that made light signals more coherent.

The theory was that this layering would make ambient infrared light visible to the human eye by tweaking the thermal footprint in real time, rendering the lens capable of picking up traces of body heat. 

Even in complete darkness, where most scopes faltered, this one could see the residual heat of a distant footstep or the faintest exhalation in the jungle air.

After months of work, trials, and taxpayer money, I finally had it: the Twilight Mark VI.

The Mark VI was nothing short of revolutionary. 

The lens used six precision-cut glass layers, each treated with Dyacin and red mercury interlayers. 

The scope contained a switch that allowed the operator to “cycle” through filters, each designed to capture a different layer of the visible or near-infrared spectrum. 

The first filter was basic infrared, giving the user enhanced thermal vision. 

The second was ultraviolet, useful for spotting traces of blood or organic compounds left on the ground. 

But it was the third filter, that truly changed things. I guess you could describe it as “an alternate lensing,” something experimental that wasn’t even supposed to be part of the design.

When I took the Mark VI’s to the testing field, my squad couldn’t believe what they were seeing. 

With the flip of a switch, even the darkest jungle became a landscape of illuminated trails, signs, and markers, previously invisible under standard scopes. 

In the pitch-black, the trees and vines almost seemed to glow faintly, highlighting every movement within their range.

My squad trained day and night with the Mark VI’s. We drilled until we could slip into the densest parts of the jungle without fear, our scopes giving us vision like the Gods. 

We became the stuff of rumour in the field, moving like phantoms, able to see, target, and vanish without a trace. The higher-ups were ecstatic. 

I was ordered to prepare the scopes for deployment in an actual mission—the final test.

The air was thick and humid. I moved at the head of the squad, communicating in short, quiet hand signals, guiding my men through the tangled brush. 

Our rifles, fitted with suppressors, were ready, held close, and aimed low as we moved in a precise, silent line. 

We were deep in one of the most dangerous areas of the Vietnam jungle.

The Mark VI’s were doing their job, casting everything in an eerie red. 

With the infrared and ultraviolet lenses, we saw the faint heat traces left by footsteps or a glint of sweat on enemy soldiers standing watch. 

It was like seeing ghosts lingering on the jungle floor.

I raised my fist, signalling the squad to stop. 

Just ahead, two enemy soldiers stood guard near a cluster of trees. I nodded to the two men closest to me, and they split off to flank. The enemy never saw them coming. 

Suppressed bursts from their rifles sounded like soft hisses, and the guards crumpled to the ground, eyes still open in shock. The squad dragged the bodies into the underbrush, covering them in loose leaves and branches.

We continued, slipping further into the jungle’s depths. The enemy stronghold came closer with each step. 

I tapped a button on my scope, shifting to infrared. Shadows became bodies, faint heat signatures left behind by unseen sentries.

As we neared the heart of the stronghold, each man cycled through the scope’s filters, adjusting to the jungle’s changing depths. 

I kept mine on infrared, but one of my men—a sharp shooter named Quinn—flipped his scope’s filter over to the “alternate lensing.” 

I noticed Quinn freeze, his finger hovering near the scope’s switch, his breath hitching.

“Quinn?” I whispered.

Quinn’s voice came out strangled. 

“Sir…there’s…I think… there’s something out here with us.”

Quinn’s eyes were wide behind the scope as he scanned the jungle. He looked frantic, his breathing quickening as he swept the scope back and forth. 

“They’re…they’re *everywhere*,” he stammered. 

“Shapes…twisting…hunched over. They’re…they’re watching us, sir.”

I placed a steady hand on Quinn’s shoulder, but before I could calm him, Quinn was jerked off the ground.

It happened so fast. One moment, he was there, crouched in the undergrowth, and the next, something unseen lifted him straight into the air. His mouth was open, a scream choked off before it began. His rifle hit the ground.

My team watched, paralyzed with shock and fear, as Quinn’s body twisted and writhed, limbs flailing helplessly. 

He clawed at the empty air, his eyes wide with pure horror.

Blood sprayed out in sickening arcs as an invisible force ripped Quinn  apart, muscle tearing away from bone with wet, snapping sounds. His body hung there, suspended, twisting, and jerking as if some creature—something we couldn’t see—was toying with him.

Quinn’s blood misted down, splattering onto the leaves and coating our squad in a warm, slick spray. 

The rest of my men, frozen in terror, watched helplessly as Quinn’s lifeless, mangled body was finally tossed aside, crashing through the trees and vanishing into the shadows of the jungle floor.

Silence filled the jungle, heavy and oppressive, broken only by the laboured breathing of the remaining men, their eyes darting through the foliage, searching for the invisible predator.

As we gathered ourselves, one of the soldiers, Phillips, murmured under his breath: 

“He was using the alt-lens… the ‘Spectre Sight.’” 

The words hung in the air, a fearful acknowledgment of what we all suspected: it wasn’t the jungle that had taken Quinn.

Against every instinct telling me to stay in the dark, I switched my scope to the Spectre Sight. 

The world twisted through my viewfinder, shifting from dense jungle greens to a sickly, cold overlay. 

Shadows lengthened and deepened, and where there was once nothing but trees and leaves, there were *things*—disturbances, figures, clinging to the edges of reality, lurking and shifting like murky stains against a canvas. 

They were grotesque—spindly and warped, like charcoal sketches half-erased and smeared into unnatural shapes. 

They loomed just at the edge of clarity, as if defying the eye to focus on them.

I choked back a shout as one of them turned, slowly, to look right at me. 

Black pits where eyes should have been, but the thing saw me, saw right through me*.* 

It twisted and contorted, limbs cracking as it took a step forward, then another, its gaze never leaving me.

The rest of my team, now on the Spectre Sight as well, froze, breaths sharp with terror as the entities began to swarm around us. 

These beings… they seemed crafted from scraps of forgotten nightmares, torsos ripped into unnatural arcs, elongated jaws hanging in silent screams. 

Thin, translucent skin pulled tight over bones that bent wrong. They were entities caught somewhere between flesh and shadow, their shapes flickering in and out of focus, half-formed yet impossibly present.

One of the soldiers, Mendez, took a step back, hand on his rifle, terror in his eyes. 

Before he could utter a sound, a thing surged forward, so fast it blurred, and latched its fingers around his neck. The creature’s fingers were like splinters of glass digging through warm butter, veins of dark energy pulsing through its hand as it lifted him off his feet. 

Mendez tried to scream, tried to bring his rifle up, but the entity’s grip tightened, and his voice turned to gurgled gasps. 

The thing twisted its head, as if curious, then yanked backward, tearing through Mendez’s throat in one clean, brutal motion. 

Blood splattered, hot and thick, covering the rest of the team.

“Open fire!” I yelled, snapping everyone from their horror-frozen stares.

Everyone raised their rifles and shot, a barrage of bullets tearing into the creatures. But the rounds passed through as if they were shooting through mist. 

Each impact rippled along the entities’ bodies before reforming, their forms flickering as if absorbing the hits without harm. 

More creatures appeared, slinking from the shadows, their jaws dropping open in wide, lipless grins that stretched far beyond what should be possible. 

Phillips was next—an entity wrapped around him like a second skin, its limbs bending around his torso, pulling him tight. 

He struggled, screaming, as the thing contorted him, its arms twisting him into a grotesque spiral, snapping bones like dry twigs. 

Another soldier, Harris, had a creature’s claw plunged into into his chest, phasing through his body and tearing his heart out in one fluid motion.

As the creatures descended on us, the noise caught the attention of the Viet Cong patrol stationed nearby. 

The jungle erupted with the crack of gunfire as the enemy soldiers converged on us, adding chaos to an already hopeless situation. 

Bullets whizzed past, slicing through the jungle, aimed at my squad. 

I spun, rifle firing in a last, desperate attempt to cover myself as I pulled back, yelling into the chaos:

“Fall back! Get out of here! Retreat!” 

But even as I shouted, I knew the truth—there was no one left in my squad. 

My men were either dead or dying, torn apart by invisible claws or shredded in the crossfire of the Viet Cong.

I moved instinctively, ducking as bullets tore through the foliage around me, sprinting through the jungle. My heart pounded as I weaved through the trees, pushing branches out of my path. 

The Spectre Sight was off, but I still felt their presence, cold and dark, pressing in around me.

I ran until my legs burned, the sounds of gunfire and inhuman screams still behind me. Every second felt like an eternity, every step the last I might take. 

The jungle was alive with shadows and gunfire as I pushed forward.

I ducked behind a tree as bullets whizzed past, chunks of bark exploding near my face. I turned and fired blindly behind me. 

I sprinted ahead, leaping over roots and ducking beneath low-hanging vines, my mind a blur of instincts and terror.

I didn’t dare turn back; I just ran, my focus on making it to the extraction point. 

I burst through a final thicket of brush and stumbled into the clearing where the chopper was supposed to pick us up.

But just as I thought I might have bought myself a second to breathe, a Viet Cong soldier appeared from the edge of the trees, rifle raised. 

I dropped to one knee, swinging my rifle up and firing. 

The man fell, and as he did, more enemies materialized from the shadows, eyes narrowed, weapons aimed at me.

I ducked low, zigzagging across the clearing, returning fire with controlled bursts. My shots were desperate but precise, each one meant to buying myself a few more seconds. 

Another enemy went down, and I glanced at my watch—just a minute left until the chopper arrived. 

Then I remembered the Spectre Sight… and realized the creatures were closing in.

I switch to the Alt-Lens, and saw my fears materialize. 

The creatures, half-seen through the tree-line, drifted closer, their eyes reflecting dimly in the darkness, their shapes fluid and distorted. 

They didn’t care for sides or tactics—they wanted only to consume, to destroy what had seen them.

With my back to the landing zone, I kept firing at anything that moved. The jungle was alive with chaos—enemy soldiers firing, creatures shifting and lunging, my own rifle a flash in the night. 

Then the roar of the helicopter’s blades cut through the night air, sending the trees around me into a frenzy.

Without looking back, I yanked the Mark VI’s from my head, tossing them into the dirt near the edge of the landing zone. 

I could almost feel the creatures’ gaze fixated on the device, their interest in me diminishing as they hovered over the scopes, drawn to the very object that had allowed me to see them. 

With a final leap, I threw myself into the waiting chopper, signalling the pilot to get us out of there, my entire body tense with the fear that one of the creatures might lunge and pull me back.

As we lifted off, I watched the clearing shrink beneath me. 

The distance softened the shapes of the Viet Cong, and by the time we were high enough, I could no longer see them at all. 

I was exhausted, my mind racing with the horrors I’d witnessed, but for the first time in hours, I could breathe.

Back at the base, I was immediately called in to give a report to my commanding officers. 

I spent hours in a dark room, recounting every detail I could remember—Quinn’s terror, the entities, the desperate firefight, the horror of seeing my team torn apart by things no one even knew about. 

I explained the Spectre Sight filter, detailing how it seemed to open a window into another layer of reality, a layer teeming with entities waiting, perhaps, for someone to see them so they could interact with our world.

The officers listened with unreadable expressions, nodding and taking notes, occasionally asking a question here or there. 

I could tell by their faces they thought I was delirious, that the jungle and the horrors of combat had driven me mad.

But I knew better. I’d seen them—creatures lurking just beneath our world, horrors barely kept at bay by the thin veil that separates our dimension from theirs.

Weeks later, after I’d been debriefed and left alone, I heard whispers through the ranks. 

The military hadn’t discarded the Twilight Mark VI as I’d hoped. 

In fact, they’d created dozens more scopes. Desperation was settling in as the war dragged on, and they needed every advantage they could get. 

My invention, something I knew should never have existed, was being produced in bulk.

But they didn’t intend to use them for American soldiers. The military had a new plan. 

They shipped boxes of the Twilight Mark VI goggles to Vietnam, each fitted with the Spectre Sight, and allowed them to be “stolen” by enemy forces, purposefully letting the Viet Cong intercept the shipments. 

The plan was simple: let the enemy use the scopes, let them see what lay hidden in that other dimension, and let the creatures do the rest. 

It wasn’t warfare, exactly—it was something darker, a calculated decision to unleash something uncontrollable on the enemy.

And from what I’d heard, the Viet Cong did exactly as intended. They took the scopes, used them, and they, too, saw what lurked just out of our view. 

Rumour had it that entire camps had gone silent, patrols disappeared, soldiers found torn apart.

Eventually, the Viet Cong figured it out, abandoning the scopes, burying them, anything to keep from them being found again. 

The Twilight Mark VI and the entities it exposed were lost in the jungles, buried, hidden. 

But I knew the truth—that those creatures were still there, watching, waiting, just beyond our vision. And that my invention had opened a door that should have remained closed.
