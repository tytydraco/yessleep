Hello everyone I’m back with an update. There’s a lot to talk about so we’ll just start with my health.

I’m doing ok as of now, I was pretty doped up the first couple of days before I made the first post. My leg is still sore but I don’t really feel it until the medicine starts wearing off. I can’t even really keep track of what medicines I’ve been given. As for my ears they are just ringing slightly and the Doctor said that my hearing would recover but I would be hard of hearing. My ears have been working so that’s all that matters.

Besides that I talked to those men. I asked Nurse Mathers to bring them in whenever they were ready to talk to me. The blonde, chestnut eyed woman of 45 years has been very comforting to me. She always listens to my ramblings and in turn she tells me stories from her life. Though I’m confined to this hospital bed which makes me hate this place and nearly everyone in it, I’ve grown quite fond of her.

She left and a couple minutes later three men walked in. First and leading the group was a tall dark complected man maybe standing 6’4”. Dark shades rested where his eyes were and the light from the ceiling mirrored off of them. His shiny bald head seem to glance a beam of light right back at the bulbs in the ceiling. Behind him were two other men, light in complexion. One of the men bore short brown hair, and glasses that looked as if they had not seen a day before this one. The other man to the right of the towering man in front stepped into the room as well. He wasn’t much of a notable figure except that he had a culdesac in his hair as if he was clinging to a long lost freedom of hair on the top of his head.

As the tall dark complected man stepped forward he took off his glasses with his left hand and stretched out his right hand to meet mine. I returned the gesture locking hands with his when he introduced himself and his colleagues.

“Mr. Xavier Johnson I’m with the FBI” he said as he gripped my hand. He continued “How are you holding up son?”. I looked down at my leg, a stump left bandaged and wrapped. I was disappointed, I knew I couldn’t work at the museum anymore. But now, why would I? With that thing lurking around who knows what it could take next. Or who.

“Right” Johnson started “I’m very sorry about your leg. Listen we’ve been trying to track the man that did-“ I cut him off, “you haven’t caught him!?” Johnson looked at me as if waiting to hear beratement from me. He then continued after a pause “We can’t catch him right now, he’s very elusive. We need detailed information from you. Mr. Ohler will take your statement. Give us everything you have, we know that this is not just a man.”

The brunette haired man stepped forward with a folder and took my name and all my information. Then I filled him in on how my shift went, the days prior, and anything weird or notable beforehand. I brought him to the main event, and walked him through. The men were astonished and seemed surprised. Mr. Ohler did not however. After I had explained what the thing had looked like and what it did, the men looked interested.

Mr. Ohler spoke finally, “Can you recall what the man looked like?” I replied saying “Not really, everything got really blurry and then I blacked out. But… well he looked like he was wearing a medical gown.” Mr. Ohler looked up from his folder, “interesting. Ok thank you Mr. Hale.”

Mr. Johnson stepped forward again just as Mr. Ohler got up from where he sat. Johnson started by saying “We’re going to be looking more into this, for now we’ve brought agent Michaels here to watch over you” he pointed at the balding man to his right. Did I need protection? Was the statue man thing going to come for me? All sorts of thoughts ran through my mind and it seemed that Mr. Johnson caught each one. “We don’t know motives and we don’t know if this… man will come looking for you. As of now you’re the only witness. There will be more local police posted in the hospital. And don’t worry Michael’s is a good shot, he’s not gonna miss if someone wants to harm you. Just let us do our job, we’ll be in touch.”

Michael’s walked over, shook my hand and Johnson and Ohler left. For the next hour we talked. We spoke of his family and mine, jobs and friends. Eventually I got tired and went to sleep.

I woke up a couple hours ago, I feel a little more energized and I’m about to take my pain meds along with other things that will make sure my leg doesn’t get infected. When Nurse Mathers walked in to give me my first round of meds she seemed disapproving of Michael’s being here. The scrutinized look on her face puzzled me. I don’t know why but that look i
