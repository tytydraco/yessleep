\[[Part 1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1dbc6x8/i_saw_something_i_shouldnt_have_and_now_i_must/)

I am currently being chased by an eldritch horror that shouldn’t exist.  My chest is heaving, my cheeks are flushing, my knees are weak, and all I can hear is the distant sound of stomp, stomp, stomp, feet slamming into the floor like it is nothing but a little dollhouse, slowly getting closer and closer with every passing second. 

Now, how did I get here, you could ask. 

I myself am not a fan of questions, but I’ll answer this one.  

[Per my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1dbc6x8/i_saw_something_i_shouldnt_have_and_now_i_must/), I was trapped in a dilapidated house, being held hostage by a figure only one could dream of. You see, the smell of that basement had encompassed that entire house over the past few days, so much so that all my daily activities in the house had been forced to stagnate all because of it. 

I picked up a few things whilst being in there. Reading, yoga, meditation (Who knew there were so many things to learn from on the Internet?).  It gets very boring sitting in a house trying not to choke on rotten fumes all day. It helped to bring me peace, and distracted me from the present, which is what I loved about it. 

But the smell had become so repugnant that one day I simply couldn’t resist climbing down those creaky stairs to see what creature lurked in there. As I climbed down however, the stairs singing a sort of hymn whilst I descended, I started to see something odd, a few figures, chairs, some sort of long cylindrical thing tying them all together in the unforgiving shadowy depths, that made me tremble. 

The way the basement was structured was this. There was a long, spiral staircase, separating the upper and lower floors of the house, along with some rails.  Then, you’d walk a little bit and there was the basement. 

What I saw there was nothing but an amalgamation of my own dreams and nightmares. 

I saw the people in the picture frame, tied together. They had a straight look on each of their faces, but their bodies looked like they were decaying. A pair of tubes were inside each of their arms, tugging on it like an IV, inserting something, some chemical, into their bodies. They were the living dead. Nothing but humanity’s worst nightmare. 

At the sight of this, I was frozen. This was not something made by mankind. This was something... new. Someone was using these poor people as vessels to charter and bring about their dreams into reality.  

You could guess who that could be. 

As I was about to leave, I glanced at the scene once again. Maybe it was out of fear, or maybe because I wanted to confirm if what I was seeing was real or not, but looking at it just reminded me of something. Something from my past, that decided to dig itself out from the pit in my brain. 

I was 10 years old, and my dad and I were on a camping trip.  

It was nothing special, just a bit of father-son bonding time. This was one of the rare trips that showed that my father cared about me. He always forgot about my existence. We had some essentials, a tent, some matches, a camping guide, and some spray. The sun was shining down on us, encapsulating my mood perfectly like a painting. 

Sitting on a log, my father had apparently heard some crinkling and odd sounds from the forest nearby, which put him on guard. I was just rocking my legs forward and back, merry about the time I was able to spend with my dad, when an abrupt movement completely stopped my herd of thoughts. 

“WHO’S THERE?”  My father screamed into the abyss. 

He rushed into our tent, and grabbed a rifle from his bag. I sat there clueless, following his movement slowly with my eyes, seeing him rush into the forest with nothing but bravery. 

He fired it, making my ears ring. I tried to cover my ears with my hands, but the ringing was still there. 

And then suddenly, I saw it. 

A pair of fully black eyes, and a long, piercing smile. 

I rushed out of the basement as quick as I possibly could after my realization, the stairs screaming with every step, as to guilt me over these people’s everlasting suffering, that I couldn’t stop. I had to do something about this, anything. Even if that meant putting my own life at risk. 

Stepping out of the basement, I felt anxious. I cautiously made my way towards my room, looking back every few seconds or so to make sure nothing was there following me, as to say “You weren’t meant to see that”. My heart was beating rapidly, my hands were sweating, and I was very on edge as I twisted the doorknob. 

It takes one step. 

One step to change your life. 

It took me one step, one second, to be sure that I needed to leave. 

My living death welcomed me, and I did not want to greet it back. An adrenaline rush surged through me as I ran out, throwing things, anything, to ward it away. Lamps, couch cushions, pots. It’s hard throwing things in the dark, when your enemy is easily masqueraded, but I did my best, and it eventually stopped chasing me. 

Panting, I made my way out of the house that I was held hostage in, basking in the night’s cold, it giving me a repressive hug. 

I was able to return to my normal life for a few weeks. The office life seemed really bleak after everything I had went through. It might seem mundane, but I was overjoyed to be back home. 

This one specific day in the office, however, made me sure of a fact. I did not get away from that thing’s grasp. 

It was a bleak November day, the office was full of nothing but sorrow, sadness, and shame. The sort of day where one’s main goal is to go home, sit, and weep. I was the same, sitting there, going tap, tap, tap, with a pencil, just wanting to leave, when my eyes shifted around, and noticed something unusual. 

I got talking with Kevin, that chubby one I [mentioned last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1dbc6x8/i_saw_something_i_shouldnt_have_and_now_i_must/), in order to figure out what exactly I saw. 

“Hey, did you see that?”  

“See what?”  

“That thing at the window, you’re telling me you don’t see it?” I exclaimed, pointing at it. 

“What thing at the window? Come on, you’re being crazy.” 

“No, no, just look.” 

Kevin swivelled his chair towards the window, and gasped. 

“Dude, what is that?” 

We could see a figure there, and it was creeping us out. Long, thin legs, thick black coat of skin, and a large head plastered with a façade smile. But this time, it held up one singular finger at me. 

Just as we were about to get closer, it disappeared. 

“Oh well, we couldn’t do anything about it.” Kevin said, retreating back to his cubicle. 

I hesitantly went back to my workspace, head reeling with thoughts, with the clock going tick, tick, tick, in the background to soothe my nerves. 

The work day ended, and I walked out of the office with nothing but pure trepidation. It was back, and it knew of my existence. I met Kevin nearby, adjusting my shirt and pants as I walked over to him. I explained my entire situation to him. 

“Man, what even was that thing?” He said to me whilst we walked. 

“I have no idea; it’s been stalking me this entire time. It’s like a rogue machine, latching onto anything and everything it sees. I don’t know what it sees in me, I'm a fairly normal guy.” 

“Wait, so you just saw it one day, and it started being like that to you?” 

“Yeah. I never knew things like that even existed. It feels weird having a supernatural being become obsessed with you.” 

Kevin laughed at my joke, but then his face morphed into something serious. 

“Does that mean I am also a potential target? Since I saw it and everything, do you think it’s mad at me too?” 

I stopped flat in my tracks when I heard that.  

“No.” I lied, my eyes darting around everywhere but I managed to compose myself, “the truth is, you might be a target, but I don’t think it would come for you. I have seen things you could never comprehend, Kevin. My eyes are opened to its antics, and that’s why it wants to get rid of me.” 

“Yeah, I get you.” Kevin said. His eyes widened when he turned around. 

I started to run, my feet leading the way, my body trying to keep up with it. 

That was the last time I saw Kevin. Him screaming my name, flapping his arms, wanting me to save him, as the figure sunk its claws deep into his skin. I ran away, like a coward, away from him, and in turn away from my normal life. 

Kevin was regarded as missing as I didn’t have the heart to tell anyone about the things I saw. 

That monster was not going to let me go.  

A few more weeks had passed, and I had almost forgotten about this whole ordeal with Kevin. Being alone is one of my strong suits after all. 

But, this one time, walking across the street, hand full with groceries and other assortments with a pep in my step, I was rather in a cheery mood. One of our top clients, a client that I had been vying for months, had recently enjoyed one of my ideas, so much so, that they wanted me to do their project specifically. 

“This would be beneficial to me,” I thought to myself, “then these impertinent people would finally recognize me for my expertise, rather than somebody to look down on.” 

I was too preoccupied within my mind, that I failed to notice the odd “thing” that was lurking around, seeping within the floor, masquerading in the background, waiting to finally sink its claws into the one place it had anticipated. 

You know, I hope that monster had a good time thinking about me. I hope it was tussling and turning in bed, trying to get me out of its mind.  I hope it made up scenarios where it caught me off guard. I hope it dreamt that it was able to rip pieces of flesh off me and relish in it. 

Because then, it would at least be at peace with itself after it was done. 

Unlike me. 

Running, running, running. 

When does this all ever stop? 

When does one look itself in the eye and think, 

“I could make this all over in a second. A minute even. I don’t even have to blink.” 

Simply never. 

When you tangle with the supernatural, it tangles with you. 

When you believe you’re in control, when you believe everything’s sorted out for you, when you don’t have to move a finger to succeed in life. 

In one instant that can all mean nothing. 

I can’t use the riches bestowed on me to help me. 

The living I made up for myself, the living that took me years to accomplish, can’t help me now. 

The lifestyle I lived can’t help me anymore. 

This is my living hell. 

And I deserve every last bit of it.
