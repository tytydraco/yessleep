The whoosh of the air. The lock clicking into place.

Our lives are governed by cycles. The fundamental aspect of a cycle lies in repetition, that is it's very nature. As we sink into these cycles in our lives, day in, day out, this familiarity can even transmute into a source of comfort.

*Whoosh*. Click.

We can become used to just about anything, I supposed.  Lorraine's laugh, the way she tilted her head up at me just so. Visits from the nurse. How that little girl came back.

Enough cycles, and even the strangest of circumstance settles into normalcy. We don't recognize that the same walls that comfort are the walls which imprison. Golden shackles, binding us to the ever turning wheel.

*Whoosh*. Click.

Until the day that something jolts us out of it. Something shocking, breaking the rhythm, upsetting the pattern.  I made a solemn oath to myself that Friday would be my last day of work, and this one I would keep. My bank account - I had a bank account! With a positive balance.

*Whoosh*. Click.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. The last time we spoke, I believe, was the day the little girl was taken. By that... thing. Tuesday, I believe.

My thinking is getting clearer but my memory is hazier. A cognitive myopia. Mental nearsightedness. Even that. I use these fancy words. But I can't remember my ex wife's face clearly.

I hadn't slept well, after the nurse took her. Tossing and turning. Every time I drifted off, I felt that vein, in the back of my head. Deep within. Pulsing. Throbbing. They say that after someone loses a limb, they still have the sensation of that limb being there. Phantom limbs, itâ€™s called. That was occurring in the back of my head- the memory of a sensation, still firing the electrical charges across the neuronal synapses.  Consciousness is such an odd thing. We rarely notice it, until it goes wrong.

I must've fallen asleep, because I woke up to my phone ringing. It was my ex wife and her lawyer, wanting to finalize some elements of the divorce. When I tried to see her face... it was blurry. In my mind. This was a woman I had known since we were fourteen. She is - was - family. Not in the I married her sense but in the...

God, it makes me sad. Thinking about her, feeling that hole in my life, visceral, like someone ripped the sinews from my bones. I can feel it, her, but can't see her face. The memory of where she used to be pulsed, but I couldn't see her.

Driving to the school, through the winding mountain roads, she called. No lawyer this time.

"Jeremy" My name coming from her mouth. Like a stranger.

"Yeah" I answered.

"Are you... ok?" She asked. Real concern in her voice.

"Does it matter" I asked. "You're gone."

Silence as I pulled up into the parking lot.

"I have to go. Work." I said.

"Jeremy..." she said. In her voice you could hear there was so much she wanted to say. Fear. Regret. Doubt perhaps.

"Take care of yourself." was all she could muster.

I hung up. That chapter was over, I knew it in my marrow. Some things, once removed, can never be put back. Despite all the kings horses and all the kings men, all Humpty could be was a tragic warning for the next thrill seeker up on that wall.

*Whoosh.* Click.

The door settled into place.

I was early, so sat in my desk reviewing my lesson plan. Hadn't even flirted with Lorraine. All I could see was that little girl's face. Her dark curls, her soft eyes. The concern she had for me as she walked away with the nurse.

Right after recess, the children all grew still. The air thickened, crackling with static. I didn't look, but could see the shape of the nurse in the doorway. A smaller shape in front of her.

The smaller shape was amorphous, like when the children had changed on the first day. It staggered across to the third row, with what I assumed was awkward, shuffling steps. Settled into the open chair four rows back.

I wanted to look at her, to run to her, see if she was ok. But that thing wasn't her. Deep within, I knew it. I could feel the nurse's eyes on me, probing, testing. Like it wanted me to act up. Spoiling for a war. What were the rules?

I'm pretty sure the paper had said wait fifteen minutes. But is pretty sure certain enough in such a situation?

So I noted the time on the clock and kept writing on the board, the children ensconced in my periphery. After about two minutes, the nurse withdrew. Not walked away, just faded back into the hall. Like a receding tide.

Then the shape that was the girl moaned. Heart rending, the anguished cry of an animal caught in a trap. A sound that awakens the protective instinct wound deep within our DNA. And I could hear the whispers. Dark. Angry. But this time buzzing around in a cloud around her.

After about five minutes, the other children begin to move. Slowly at first, little twitches. Then shuffling. From the edge of my vision, the shape begin to coalesce into the form of the little girl.

Seven minutes had passed since the nurse left. She moaned again, and the other children turned towards her. They let out smaller moans, and squirmed uncomfortably. Sympathy pains? Maybe. They seemed to feel what she felt.

At twelve minutes, the little girl was fully there. I could see her face, her legs, the tufts of hair at the end of her braid. I wanted to take her, hold her, keep her safe.

The clock ticked, every second an eternity. Cycles.

Tick, tick.

Finally, fifteen minutes had passed. With the extra two from when the nurse watched me, I felt comfortable that the rules supported me.

I ran to her. She lifted her chin, tears in her eyes.

"Are you okay?" I asked, wiping a tear from her cheek.

The children murmured. This sound was new, like the whispers, but somehow in support.

"Yes." she said. "It's just pain." She seemed confused, that I was caring.

"What's your name?" I asked, gently.

"Magaera" She said, softly, placing her hand on the desk.

It's appearance was shocking. The index finger and middle finger's nails were a deep purple, with bluish veins leading from them. She winced in pain as I lifted it, then looked at her other hand. It bore the same markings.

She looked at me in wonder. "Why do you do this?"

"You're in pain" I said.

"Yes. And?"

"When you see someone suffering, you want to relieve their pain. To help them somehow" I said.

The murmurs again, louder. Johnny raised his hand.

"Yes?"

"So if somebody is weak, you help them?" he asked.

"Yes. What else would you do?"

The murmurs grew louder.

"The weak are fed upon." he answered.

Just then, the dismissal bell rang. I stared as the children got up and ran out the door. Magaera was last, moving slowly, still in considerable pain.

When she got to the door, she looked at me, torn between pain and joy. She smiled.

It hit me that I had never seen the children laugh. They would run after each other, play games, but that key tenet of childhood had never erupted forth from their lips.

She stood there for a minute, in the doorway, like a wild creature observing civilization. Then gone.

*Whoosh.* Click.

Lorraine was waiting outside, in the glow of the evening. Magic hour, they call it, and the enchantment lay thick in the setting rays of the sun. She was radiant.

She stepped in close to me. I could smell her, honeysuckle in the early fall. She took my hand.

"You have kind eyes" she said.

"Those children..."

She squeezed my hand tighter.

"They're important." she said.

My body responded to her touch, to her smell. I fought a valiant battle against millenia of evolution.

"But who are they?"

She leaned in, close to my ear.

"Scholarship. We offer them a better life." she said, then let my hand go. She looked up at me with those wide doe eyes.

"You're doing an amazing job with them."

Her body brushed mine as she walked back into the school.

Later, at the bar, Sylvio sat next to me. He ordered a white Russian, me a beer. I paid. Two more days, why not celebrate? Cash bulged in my pocket. 

Click. *Whoosh.* The bartender opened the bottle.

Symphony in reverse, the other dominant cycle of my life.

Click. *Whoosh.* Drink.

I pressed the glass against my lips.  The frigid liquid ran down my throat. On the path to sweet oblivion.

The bartender sat the milk carton on the bar.

I froze. Beer poured out the side of my mouth.

"Whoa, whoa, careful you're going to develop a drinking problem" Sylvio exclaimed.

I coughed, and choked. Set the beer on the bar. Bile rose in the back of my throat as I rushed out the door. Racing against nature, I stumbled to a bush. Liquid spewed from my throat as my stomach contracted, over and over.

Walking back into the bar, I sat down and stared.

"You ok, buddy?" Sylivo asked.

No. I'm not.
I didn't even know they still put missing children on milk cartons. I grabbed the carton and set down a large tip. 

"Party's just getting started" Sylvio proclaimed.

Not for me, I thought. For me, the party's over.

Magaero's sweet face stared at me from the back of the milk carton. 

I knew things were about to change. A gear, deep within some ancient machinery, had ground to a halt. The cycle broken.

Missing, it said. But that wasn't the strangest part.

The strangest part lay below that, where the missing since date was printed.

September 23, 1992.

The bile began to rise. 

*Whoosh*. Click.
