We humans know so little of the universe, our planet, our ocean, and even our own minds are still largely a mystery to the human race. But not to me, I’ve always been.. aware I guess you can say that there is a bigger picture to life, that we are more powerful than we think and I learned the hard way that there are beings in the universe who seeks to keep us in ignorance.

My name is Aurora larvae and I am here to tell you that YOU have the power to change the world, to have the life YOU want and maybe.. just maybe, enough of us will awaken to free the human race, but for now, let me start from the beginning.

It all started one morning very similar to all the rest. I awoke and as usual began my morning routine of checking my socials for new doses of dopamine. I of course hit my record 1 million views on the infamous TikTok doing nothing but cringeworthy dances. I mean, I did manifest it but come on! How could anyone truly have enjoyed that?? I guess maybe I just wanted to see how far I could take my abilities from afar.

I stared at my screen reading through the variety of flame and heart eyed emojis when my trance was broken by my sweet sweet parents calling me downstairs. I threw myself out of bed and marched my way downstairs.

Aurora: “GoodMorning mom!”

Zoe: “GoodMorning Sweetheart, I’m shocked I had to even wake you, you’re usually up far before your father & I.”

I suddenly mentally froze as I pondered over whether I should tell her about my late night adventures. I guess that is also a good time to mention that I can astral project. Meaning, I can leave my physical body at will and travel the world and even the universe as a spirit. I do it every single night really, though sometimes I miss my ordinary nights and go to bed and wake regularly.

But my mind also went back to what she told me.  I DO wake up before my parents so why was this time any different? Suddenly I remembered, it hit me in one wave after another but all of the memories came back!

I was flying throughout space as per usual whisking past a purple and green planet. It’s aura reached out and touched me and I felt a greeting from the planet. I returned the gesture and went on my way. I was about to fly right into the heart of a star when I felt the most evil, gut-wrenching feeling of terror overwhelm me. It was so powerful I swear I could almost feel it, this feeling of evil weighed so heavy on my soul that I began struggling to stay afloat at this point and that was when I saw it.

A shadowy humanoid figure with glowing yellow eyes floating towards me in the distance, as I made eye contact with it I could feel a hatred overcome me that was somehow even worse than the evil before and as I stared at it, unable to move it lunged at me….

Except after all of my years of AP’ing teleporting back into my body was an an easy breeze allowing anything scary I allowed my thoughts to conjure up end right there, as I flew away from the being I went down a starry tunnel and into my body, something was different though. I seemed to be in my body yet not? Either way, I assumed the being must’ve messed up my sleep schedule somehow and I chalked it up to just a fault of my mind, maybe a subconscious memory of a nightmare I had as a child.. Right??

Zoe: “Aurora, sweetie, did you hear me?”

Aurora: “oh, right! Yes I must’ve blacked out for a moment.. I suppose I just overslept, had one of those nights y’know.”

Zoe: “well maybe this breakfast will help cheer you up. Look, your father & I made waffles AAAANNDDD fried chicken. Your favorite.”

Aurora: “oh. My. God. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!”

I will say one thing. It sure as hell distracted me from that awful creature, I dug in of course and began contemplating what I should do for today. Maybe go visit my friends Kim, Aph, Kyle, Kenneth, or maybe Brendan? Or maybe I should just meditate and enter into a lucid dream? My thoughts were interrupted by a sudden bang at my front door. My father got up to go check what it was as I simply stared in confusion.

Zoe: “What the hell was that??”

Aaron: “I’m sure it’s nothing, probably just some asshole mailman throwing our mail at the door instead of putting it in the mail holder like a decent human bei…”

I left my table to see what shocked my dad so much he didn’t even bother finishing his sentence. When I finally reached him I peered over his shoulder and gasped.
