I stared down at my arm, the sickly pale flesh disappearing beneath the stark white cast. How did this happen? I've racked my brain, but the memories surrounding this injury are just...gone. Erased. Replaced by hazy, formless blanks where the details should be.  
  
It started a few nights ago. I was up late, mindlessly drifting across the internet's backwaters like a digital insomniac. That's when I came across...it. A crudely designed website with glowing green text pulsating against the black background like radioactive veins.  
  
At first, I thought it was just another laughably amateur attempt at a creepypasta-style horror story trying too hard to scare people. But as I read on, the content made my blood freeze.  
  
The site claimed to have insider information about something called "The Render" - a legendary and depraved creature that stalks ancient forests and woodlands, seeking out humans for its deranged rituals. If The Render finds you alone, the text warned, it will appear from the shadows and ask you a simple question in a grating, inhuman voice:  
  
"Are you right-handed...or left?"  
  
If you foolishly admit to being right-handed, the creature mercilessly snaps your right arm with brutal force, relishing your screams as the bones shatter. If you admit to being left-handed, it shatters your left arm without hesitation.  
  
And if you refuse to answer or try to be deceptive? That's when The Render truly unleashes its evil. It begins methodically shattering every limb while you lay helpless on the ground, wailing in sheer agony. The relatively "lucky" victims had just their arms and legs broken in this cruel game.  
  
But there were accounts of The Render also taking fingers and even hands from those who angered or offended it the most. One particularly disturbing story claimed The Render seemed to derive sadistic pleasure from the sickening crunch and snapping sounds of bones breaking. As if it fed off the audible misery of its victims' suffering.  
  
The most chilling detail, however, was the final part of The Render's cruel ritual. After shattering your body and will, it would cruelly wipe your memory of the entire traumatic event, using some sort of unnatural power. Victims awoke later, hopelessly broken yet with no recollection of their fateful encounter in the woods or how their limbs became mangled.  
  
Just...emptiness. Foggy blanks where those nightmarish memories should have been burned into the psyche.  
  
At this point, my hands were shaking, cold sweat prickling my skin. This had to just be an admittedly well-done work of fiction, right? Creative writing at its most depraved, but not real... That's what I desperately wanted to believe.  
  
But then I scrolled down to the photo gallery section of the website.  
  
Twisted, mangled arms bent at grotesque angles that no person should ever have to endure. Compound fractures with thick bones protruding through ripped flesh. Deep, ragged gashes crisscrossing appendages, dried blood caked around the wounds. These weren't AI-generated, and there's no way they were Photoshop fakes...these injuries were undeniably, horrifyingly real.  
  
And each one was captioned with the same sickening line of text: "I don't remember how this happened."  
  
I slammed my laptop shut, heart pounding as if I'd seen something obscene that could never be unseen. Suddenly, my apartment felt too open, too exposed...too vulnerable. I struggled to catch my breath, fighting waves of panic washing over me.  
  
Was this just an immersive horror experience? Some morbid Internet rabbit hole designed to mess with people's minds? Or did this unholy creature - The Render - actually exist out there? Stalking the forests and woodlands, seeking out new victims to torment and disfigure for its sick pleasure before cruelly erasing their memories of the traumatic event?  
  
That night, fear gripped me like a vice. I barely slept, startling at every creak and groan of the apartment settling. I checked and double-checked that all windows and doors were locked. At one point, I even got on my hands and knees, compulsively peering under beds and into closets with a trembling flashlight beam like a terrified child convinced there were monsters hiding in the dark.  
  
For a while after that, I tried to put the disturbing website out of my mind and regain my grip on reality. Surely it was just someone's creative writing project meant to unsettle people, I told myself. An unsettlingly well-done bit of horror fiction, but fiction nonetheless.  
  
And yet...  
  
I can't shake the nagging thought that bubbles up from the depths of my subconscious each night as I stare at the ceiling, unable to sleep. A thought that chills me to the bone, no matter how hard I try to rationalize it away:  
  
What if The Render is real...and I can't remember how I broke this arm because it made me forget?
