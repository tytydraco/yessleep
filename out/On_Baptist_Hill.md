Before getting into this story, to put into perspective how truly frightening the experience was versus how mundane it might seem reading it, growing up in the heart of Appalachia, and always being avidly outside and seeing or hearing things that could be considered strange, I, was and still am not afraid of much, but this still makes me turn my lights on while trying to sleep when I think about it.

I was around 13 at the time, and living in my grandmothers house, with my siblings and mother as well, a good bit into East Tennessee. While there weren’t many people around to begin with, I still had some neighbors, that being by friend from school, who I’ll just call C as to not say his real name. Me and him were basically brothers, having known eachother and lived near one another for our entire lives, and being honest we looked like we were brothers too. 

We would always go out into the woods and do random things most teenage boys would do, mess around, look for animals, play games, but one day, or rather night, as it was about 10 P.M., we decided to head uphill to the old Baptist Church right up the road from my house. It was only about a minute or two walk up, and it wasn’t a very big church either, almost nobody even showed up to it anymore, and now I wouldn’t be surprised if it was completely abandoned.

As we were walking up the road, taking a bit longer than usual because we were tired and it was late, but not tired enough to go back home. As we were walking and talking about various things, we started to hear a strange noise beside us. To describe the area, we were on paved road, but everything beyond and around it was just forest. The noise, which only I heard at first, was some kind of shuffling above us, not like the normal tree branch swaying sound, almost like something was on it, but too big to be a bird or squirrel. 

When C noticed he just shrugged it off and kept walking until we made it up to the lot of the church, and we just kind of sat in the middle of it. That’s when the stepping started. We were just in the middle of the lot, which combined with the church took the entirety of the hill, everything around it was just sloped down and covered in trees. A noise that sounded like feet crunching against dead leaves, which at first sounded like it was circling the hill, it got much faster, and seemed to be multiple things circling at once, but despite being fast the treading still sounded careful and methodical. C, being the usual carefree person he is, tried to make a joke about it, as it was loud enough to where he noticed it too, and as he made a loud noise in the middle of the lot, everything went dead quiet, so we both decided to walk back down and head home. As we were walking back down to my place, we heard something scraping on the road behind us, so without looking, he started running first, and then I followed, with nothing else strange happening on the run back. 

Honestly, even though it doesn’t seem like much reading it, for us, and especially me, it’s definitely one of the top terrifying experiences of my life. And honestly, with some of he things I have seen before out there, and knowing how those woods are, I can’t find out how to explain it.
