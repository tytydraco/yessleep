So I bought this mirror at a flea market about three weeks ago. It was old and heavy, with a carved wooden frame that had gone through multiple restorations. It smelled faintly damp. The seller told me it came from an estate sale. I naturally thought it would make my bare apartment feel less empty.

The first night I set it up, I noticed something strange. When I passed it in the dark, my reflection didn't quite match. My face looked distorted and wrong, and my mouth was forced into uncomfortably stretched lips. But then I realised that was how glass warped reflections in bad lighting. I used to have a lot of fun with this weird trick and the bathroom mirror when I was a child.

For a few days, it behaved like a normal mirror, as it should have. Nothing was magical about it. It just did a good job filling the empty space by the cabinet in my bedroom.

Sometime a week later, I caught movement in the corner of my eye and realized that I was standing in the mirror even though I was in the corridor leading to the room. Light couldn't bend that far.

Another time, I walked past it and somehow the reflection hesitated, just a beat - before following. I stopped looking directly at it after that. It weirded me out so much.

I convinced myself I was just seeing things for quite some time. The reflection did not misbehave too. 

However, once in broad daylight - I found myself staring at the mirror just too long. Felt this weird attraction.

I broke contact when fear got the better of me, specifically when I realised that the sclera in my eyes looked stark, uncannily white. It creeped me out.

The next morning (Friday) I brushed it off and tried to throw myself back into work. I was already running late when I finally made it into the office.

I hadn't even sat down at my desk when one of my co-workers slid past with a weird look on his face.

*“You were in the bathroom on our floor this morning,”* he said, like he couldn’t believe he was saying it. *“Just standing there… staring. Wouldn’t answer me. Kinda freaked me out.”*

I froze. I had been back at home until twenty minutes before.

That day drifted by. I even visited the bathroom myself to check if my reflection did dirty its weird tricks. Nothing was overtly unusual, other than the weird lag to my movements. That was persistent.

Later that night, the calls started.

My phone woke me with a buzz sometime close to **3:47 A.M.**, like a warning in my palm. I fumbled for it. I had eleven missed calls, all from my friend Maria - *miles away* from where I lived.

My thumb blurred as I flipped through them. Nine in the last twenty minutes, and two from earlier that night. Her name had never looked so frantic on my screen.

I hit play on the newest voicemail she left me. She didn't respond to any of the calls I sent further. Her voice burst out of the speaker before the beep - a ragged sound, half-sentence, half-scream.

***"-stop-please--stop ringing the bells-what are you doing!!"*** Under her words was another sound - numerous high metallic rings, paced too evenly, quite deliberately at first.

The next voicemail. ***"pick up the phone! This isn't funny! Drew, I can see you on the ring - stop it ! stop it ! why are you grinning at me? Stop-- oh God, please! I won't open the door! Stop--"*** the words were all breath and nails, panicked. The rings were unnaturally place now, too rapid for human fingers to place. I fear I heard a massive door crash open by the end of the clip.

I texted her, tried calling her back - no response. No blue ticks, no typing. My chest lugged its own panic.

Just then, in the darkness of my room, I saw something move in the doorway as I rested my phone. A wedge of a shadow shaped like a person, standing perfectly still at the threshold of my room where the corridor light died.

The silhouette tightened, shoulders, a head - but it didn't breathe. It slowly crawled away from the door, almost crab-walking (disjointly) its way out by the wall.

Needless to say, I was too traumatized to catch any sleep that night. The timely, gentle knocking on the mirror repeating after every few minutes didn't help either. My back turned to it, I didn't dare to look back, I felt like I was being watched.

The following morning, Saturday, was nothing less of getting caught in a pile of unread messages. Maria still didn't reply back. I was deeply concerned.

However, my messaging app was now flooded with dozens of messages from countless familiars. Friends and family miles away, all asking the same thing in a hundred different tones of annoyance, confusion, and fear.

What the hell was I doing at their house last night?

My cousin in Boston: *"Drew, if this is your idea of a joke, it's just not funny. You scared my kids!"*

An old college roommate, forty miles over: *"Dude, you good? What's going on? I won't mind you dropping by at all, but breaking in and running away is NOT funny."* a message followed by paragraphs of stuff he claimed I did. 

Many more messages. I tried to deny them all.

It wasn't physically possible for me to be at so many different places at once.

One of my friends sent me a small clip demanding explanation. It was a shot from her front door, and pressed against the narrow glass panel beside, was *my* face.

The sclera of my eyes were stark, unnaturally white - just like I had seen in the mirror previously. A jarring grin etched to my face, eyes that followed the camera. Just standing, observing.

By the end of the clip itself, from the opposite angle - I disappeared into thin air. I was no longer there.

I spent the rest of Saturday and Sunday in a frantic haze, calling and texting everyone who had contacted me. I tried to plead that I was not guilty, begged for forgiveness, even reasoned so far as to making a group chat and listing out all of the messages I received to show how it was just not possible for me to pull all of this in one night.

I gained some trust after that, but the question still remained unresolved. 

***How? Who, or What?***

By Sunday night, defeated and utterly alone - I did the only thing I could think of. I grabbed the thickest, mustiest blanket from my closet - the one I had never used and just threw it over the mirror, tucking the edges behind the frame until the entire thing was shrouded.

For the next three days, I got no more calls or texts. No more uncanny reports of me standing outside their windows at night or breaking in. Was it some bizarre, shared delusion?

Maybe covering the mirror had worked. Maybe.. it was over. Maybe.

Last night, I almost slept through the night for the first time in a week. However, I was jolted awake by a sound from the corner of my bedroom.

A soft thump, followed by the sound of heavy fabric slithering to the floor. My blood ran cold. I sat up in bed, tense, only to see that the blanket was off the mirror now.

However, my face looked disoriented, eyes seemed to twitch, and an uncanny grin curled my lips in the lasting reflection. I wasn't making any faces.

Just then, I heard a sharp chime. The doorbell, a single, sharp, deliberate press.

My phone buzzed. A motion alert from the smart doorbell. And there it was - my own face, warped by the wide-angle lens, staring directly into the camera. 

That awful, stretched grin plastered across its features. It wasn't moving. Just waiting, yet again, patiently.

I didn't dare to get up and open the door. The ringing picked up pace. Almost as fast as one of those vintage iron alarm clocks, a frantic - metallic peal that vibrated through the walls.

As I got up to examine the corridor that led to the living room, the shadow figure perched at its end, a featureless silhouette blocking my only way out.

As soon as I had acknowledged it, the ringing stopped. The silence that followed was somehow more worse.

Then I heard it again - that soft, rhythmic knocking, coming from the mirror right behind me.

I turned hesitantly. And there was my reflection; anticipating this moment. Grinning, its eyes almost protruding from its skull. It was posed as if on the verge of leaping right through the glass.

I had enough of this. That was not my reflection. Just something pretending to be it. 

I picked up the heavy metal lamp from my nightstand. The base was solid iron, cold and unforgiving in my strong grip.

The moment my fingers closed around it, the shadow at the end of the hall surged forward at an unnatural pace.

I had a split second. No time to think, only to act. I spun and hurled the lamp with all my strength at the grinning face in the mirror.

The shriek of tortured glass was instantaneous. The mirror didn't just break; it exploded.

A concussive blast of force and glittering shrapnel burst outward. I threw my arms up, but it was useless.

The force tripped me back against the bed as a thousand hot needles dug into my arms, my face, my chest.

The noise died, replaced by a high-pitched ringing in my ears. I lay there, gasping, the coppery taste of blood in my mouth.

The air smelled of ozone. Slowly, I pushed myself to a sitting position. My bedroom was a disaster. A carpet of glittering, razor-sharp shards covered everything.

The wall was empty. The shadow in the hallway was gone.

It was over. A wave of painful, profound relief washed over me. It had to be over.

My rage gave way to a throbbing, aching reality. Looking down, I saw dozens of deep, bleeding cuts on my skin.

A long shard of glass was embedded in my forearm. After a moment of calm, clear thought, I carefully wrapped my arm in a towel, grabbed my keys, and drove myself to the ER.

Hours later, stitched and bandaged, I finally stumbled back into my apartment. The exhaustion was bone-deep.

I didn't feel like sleeping in my bedroom anymore. It was a mess. It didn't feel safe either. 

I just locked the front door, fell into the couch in my living room trying to rest myself. The painkillers dragged me down into a drowsy, dreamless haze.

I was finally.. safe.

I don't know how long I slept. But as my consciousness started to surface abruptly from my slumber, I felt something coldly familiar.

That sense of being watched.

My eyelids felt heavy as lead, but I forced them open one last time before drifting off completely.

And there, standing perfectly still in the darkness of the corridor to my room, was a familiar wedge of shadow shaped like a person. Though it was gone in a blink.

I don't really know what made it stay - but I fear it's not leaving anytime soon.
