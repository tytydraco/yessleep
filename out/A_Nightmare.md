I had a dream that I thought about the entire day while at school, In this dream that I was at my school waiting in a line of some sort. It was just me and my younger brother and a bunch of people I could not recognize. Apparently, we were waiting for our parents because it was our school’s recognition program. When suddenly a man kidnapped the both of us and covered our eyes. Then we woke up tied to a large balloon and they threw us into the air while waving at us with a creepy smile on their face and then we started floating.  
  
Slowly we kept on floating up and up. In one of the windows  I saw my classmate dressing up which startled me and I looked away and then I thought, wait how is there an apartment on top of our school? I realized, we’ve been floating for way too long our school cant be this high so I looked down and its like we are 40 stories up already, what the hell?  
  
 We managed to remove the rope that tied us to the balloon and gripped the balloon as hard as possible in order to not fall. It was pretty high after all. Me and my brother saw a group of condominium buildings that was familiar to us. So we decided to steer towards the direction of the condominium buildings, because we know it is near our home and we could lose the people that have kidnapped us.  
  
Our balloon stopped floating and now we are slowly floating down and we could spot a car that has been following us for a while now. We were now steering through the condominium buildings but it was so quiet for no reason. Not a single window opened too. We tried to peek through those huge rectangular windows that was at the side of the buildings but we for some reason couldndt manage to.  
  
Suddenly strong wind flows towards us and pushes us through a small gap of the tall buildings and it was really really dark. We could barely see anything but we kept on steering through the long gap and we could see a dim light in the distance and kept going. Once we went through we could see more buildings which looked abandoned because of how rusty and dirty they looked.  
  
We kept on steering on this impossible balloon as I know this would not be possible at all because of how heavy we are for the balloon to float but I thought to myself I shouldn’t be worrying about this but the endless void just way below us maybe like 20 floors down. It was so dark that I could not see a single thing under us, its like if we fell down we’d keep falling forever. Endlessly. We kept on steering through the group of abandoned buildings. Its amazing how I can still remember details like this about the nightmare I had.  
 

It was dark and cold at the same time. There was a light breeze coming from the east and it was what we were using to steer the balloon. We heard what sounded like car noises in the distance so we panically went to a building with a dim bluish light coming out of the rectangular window and we slid through the gap of the window. It was a huge area with a bluish-green light emitting from the light bulbs. We saw multiple creatures roaming the area. One was a familiar looking tall entity that looked like a malnourished thin man. It had a bloated belly and every limb was really thin. Its head and face shape looked like that one character from a show I watched, gravity falls. Another one which was as small and had the body shape of a Minecraft pig with 2 huge cute looking eyes, like those kawaii anime girls I keep seeing in memes. There were more of them but I cant remember how the others looked like anymore.  
  


We explored the area searching for another way out of here thinking that our kidnappers and supposed killers followed us here. But its almost impossible for them to follow us here but we couldn’t take any chances. My younger brother accidentally dropped the balloon and it started floating away from us. We started chasing it but we just couldn’t catch up to it for some reason. It was going to a place of the area which had many creatures in it and we don’t really feel like approaching them. They were pacifists to us the entire time we were here but they creep us out. So we had to abandon our only hope of getting out of here, praying and hoping that going there would be our last resort.

We kept on exploring the area and avoiding contact from these creeps and found a stairway leading to the next floor. As we walked up through the stairs, we realized that the floor looked like a mall. The light that was emitting from the lightbulbs was pure white light which really started to hurt my eyes but we kept exploring. The more we explored, the more balloons were appearing everywhere. Its like the more rooms we pass the more balloons appear. As we kept on exploring we saw 4 people riding on what looks like..balloons that are also bicycles?  
  
We thought they were just another entity so we just passed through them and they just stood there talking in perfect English. They tried to talk to us but we didn’t want to interact with them and instead  tried collecting balloons that could help us get out of here but we couldn’t find a single one that could make us float quite far. However we did find some that could float quite a bit and could make us jump quite high but we needed more, a large one. The entities were just following us around on their bikes observing us.  
  
Finally we approached them because they seemed friendly and asked wheres the rectangular window? Then they said “Wow, these entities can speak perfect English. They’re getting smarter.” Then we gave them a confused look and my brother told them that we thought they were the entities. We then realized that we are both humans here and we decided on exploring together. They told us that this floor has no rectangular windows for some reason but there IS a stairway that leads to the next floor which should have one of those windows where we could escape the building from and get the hell out of this mess.  
  
They showed us to the stairwell and we walked up the stairway. The floor had a familiar look. Like where my relatives lived in. We went inside one of the condos which looked exactly like my aunt’s. We stayed there planning on where we’d go to and what we’d do. The other group we met told us that they’ve been here for so long and have been longing on wanting to get out of here. I told them the plan of equipping a balloon to our bodies then clinging onto a huge balloon and 2 people per balloon. We went out of the condo and suddenly saw dead corpse on the floor, some were missing limbs and some were missing limbs and eyes.  
  
  
  
  
  
Suddenly, a couple dressed in farmer clothes walked past us and started staring at the window and then we saw a huge thunderstorm coming. Me and my brother said to each other, “how is this possible?” there was no thunderstorm when we were just drifting in the air going through the buildings it was just really dark like the sun was gone. But not dark enough where we cant see a single thing. Im hoping to finally wake up from this nightmare because I don’t want to have to go through this.  
  
We walked closer to the couple and noticed That they were bleeding a bit and the husband only has one eye and one arm. After we noticed, we quickly moved away from them as they stared at us with tired eyes. They made a weird groaning sound as they slowly turned their heads behind us. My skin suddenly got goosebumps and I shouted to my group to go back to the condo room.  
  
We went back as fast as possible and a huge horde of what seems like zombies? Sprinted to our direction and rushed the gate (my aunt;s condo had a gate then a door) We weren’t fast enough to sprint back and my brother got caught by 3 zombies and then we desperately tried to beat the living shit out of the zombies to push them away from my younger brother. Luckily we were able to push them away and lock the gate as the zombies tried to desperately keep on pushing the gate down. We checked if my brother was bitten but he was only grabbed by the zombies and almost bitten.  
  
We went inside the condo, shut the lights off and barricaded both the gate and the door with the couch and all the other large things we could find. And then we slept to prepare for when we finally leave the house and hope the zombies leave.  
  
I couldn’t sleep.  I mean who could sleep inside their dream while sleeping so I just kept guard for what seems like 2 hours and then I woke the others up after I couldn’t hear any more groaning and sounds outside. We removed the barricades and left. There were no more zombies left, but dead corpses outside the house. We equipped all the balloons but we were missing 2 more large balloons for the 4 people we were with so we started searching for one from the last floor.  
  
We walked down the stairwell and explored together as, splitting up could be the worst thing we could do right now. We were able to find 2 large balloons after what seemed long hours as my watch wasn’t with me. We went back up the floor and they started inflating the balloons more with their mouths while I stare out the cold dark abyss through the window with my brother. I told him “What the fuck is this place..” and he just stayed quiet and patted me on the back and went to the others. Then I saw something that genuinely creeped me out. A small windows opened and I could’ve sword I saw someone staring at me with a familiar looking creepy smile. Theres no way they’re here.  
  
I panically sprinted to the others and urged them to go faster. Someone’s following us. We put balloons everywhere in our body. The head, the abdomen, the limbs, and even our pockets, we look like we equipped an armor made of balloons. We tested jumping and we we were able to jump quite high and we even hit our head on the ceiling. We were still confused on what laws of physics we’re breaking here but enough of that. Time’s running out and we need to go now.

I was so creeped out of everything here that I’d rather die than have to go through this but I didn’t wanna test dying here aswell. Me and my brother were clinging unto the same large balloon and we were all split to 3 groups, 2 people each balloon. We grabbed something large and tried breaking off the window as the gap isn’t big enough to fit in the huge balloon. We were able to break it with ease, wow this place is really rusty. We jumped off as hard as we could while clinging unto the balloon and as soon as we left the window I blacked out.  
  
I woke up inside a car beside my brother and I think my mother was driving. I was panicking but then I thought to myself, “Did I wake up already?”I look out the window and its raining so hard I could barely see anything. Then suddenly I could see water accumulating. “Wait, are we slowly getting submerged in water?” I asked my brother. He didn’t respond he kept on napping. My mother was quiet too and I was the only one panicking. And then the window broke and water burst inside the car and I drowned.  
  
I woke up again. This time im riding a motor and my little brother was driving the motorcycle. We arrived at a market and I asked, “Why are we here?” Of which he responded “Mom needed us here to pick her up” still confused with whats happening I realized why the hell is my brother driving hes not old enough to drive what the hell? So I forcefully removed him from the front and unto the passenger seat part o the motorcycle. I glanced all around us and its hella quiet with no vendors at all in their stalls, it started raining a bit and I saw 2 guys just laying down on the side of the road. Then they suddenly stood up and and turned their heads toward us with that same familiar looking creepy fucking smile that ive seen before.  
  
I woke up, for real this time on my bed. I looked everywhere around me and it was normal. Everything was normal. I looked at my little brother and he also just woke up. I kept on thinking of this nightmare the entire day. I hate lucid dreams.
