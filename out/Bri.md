About a year ago, I was at the lowest point in my life that I’ve ever been. My parents were having marrige issues which resulted in daily arguements between them, my cousin who I considered my best friend went off for college and to top it all off, a group that I considered my friends at school all cut me off for my so called “weird and creepy” behavior which is just some bullshit because I don’t consider myself creepy. I’m suprised I didn’t just dissapear because I mean who would miss me. I feel like just another person with a dark ending. This would all go away after I met her. Bri. Bri was the most gorgeous and breathtaking girl that I have ever laid my black eyes on. She had amazing dark hair, nice pale skin and her makeup would make me blush at every glance. 

I got an instagram follow request from Bri about a few months after school started. Might I mention, I had only talked to her a few times because we used to stand in the lunch line every now and then and she always used to ask me to let her cut or just ask me how my class was. I always just thought she was a one time person I see every now and then but I guess this proved otherwise. I had about 24 followers at the time and about 10 of them were burner accounts I had made for some personal reasons. Bri had about 267 followers which about 130 of those were guys and the rest were girls. As I looked through her 2 posts, I saw pictures of her on family trips and with friends. Many of these comments were made up of guys complimenting her butt and boobs. They didn’t get liked. The others were her friends complimenting her with comments like “slay”, “so gorgeous” and “briiiiiii so pretty”. 

After I screenshotted them, I went to play some GTA on my xbox for a little bit. A few minutes later, I heard a ding from my phone which was odd since nobody, not even my parents, texted me. It was a message reauest from Bri. Bri was texted me about my sweater. It was a black megadeath sweater and it turns out she was a huge fan of it as I was too. We started texting non stop for the next few months and it was the best I have felt in my life. We would text every minute, call almost every night and talk at school. It was amazing. We became very close and we both learned more about our personal lives. 

For some key details, Bri had an ex who would regulary flirt with other girls who he ended up hooking up with but she regularly went back to him since she says she was in love with him. This time she said she was really done with him since she caught him sleeping with her best friend. Every time she would bring him up, I would fill up with anger and trying to convince myself that I needed to prove I was better than that asshole. I would regularly give her gifts, attention and anything that I wanted to do to prove to her I was better than him. After a while though, Bri became more distant with me. She would take almost 4 hours to text me back, start sending me dry messages, be online while I was on delivered and she started completely avoiding me at school. I was confused on why this was happening but I convinced myself to keep proving to her I was better. I wanted to win the girl of my dreams and finally be happy. This would all change though. 

I started following Bri after school without her knowing. I would watch her get in her car and drive around, doing errands and going to her job. I would take pictures of her and put them in a gallery which I would then print them out and put them on my wall. I convinced myself that I was just being a good guy. One night as I was watching her leave her job at pizza hut, I saw a red car come and Bri got in it. This was unfamiliar since I know she drives to work. I started feeling uneasy. I then started tailing the car which lead me to a very nice house in a suburban area. I watched as the car doors open and I was stunned to see Bri’s ex. This infurriacted me since she told me she was done with him for good and she hasn’t talked to him since that night she caught him and her best friend in bed. So much anger was going through my blood and my mind was absolutely blank. I didn’t know what to feel or think. Was this why she was being so distant with me? 

While this was happening, I saw them go inside his house and the door shut. The lights in what I was assuming to be in his bedroom turned on then turned off after a second. This infuriated me even more. I then realzied that her ex forgot to close his car door all the way and I got a plan. I got some old alcohol cases from the back of my car and a bag of weed from the glove box. I opened the ex’s car and planted everything smoothly. I then did some shimmying around and ended up cutting the brake cable on the car. The whole time I had a sadistic smirk on my face. I knew exactly what I was doing. 

I waited a few hours till I saw them leaving the house, holding hands. I watched them get in the car and drive down the street pretty fast. I tailed behind them. As the first stop light was coming, I could tell that the ex couldn’t brake. The car speeded past the stop light and was going down the street faster and faster, swerving all over the road. Eventually, I knew that the nearby canal was at the end of the street and that there was no trees or anything to stop the car when it reached the end of the road. I started laughing louder and louder as I was tailing behind them. The canal came up and sure enough, they crashed into it. The car began sinking in the deep waters which was oddly satisfying to me. I parked my car at the bridge next to the canal and watched them slowly sink into the water. The car eventually sunk all the way. I said to myself, “I love your Bri”. They never came up. 

I got in my car and snuck back inside my house without waking anybody. I went to sleep with a smile on my face while megadeath was playing in the background. I woke up to my parents watching the local morning news. I sat down and it said that two local teens who were under the influence if drugs and alcohol, crashed the car into the canal and were found dead on impact. The city police cheif said “it was just teens having no self control over their actions or thinking of the consequences”. I smirked at this comment. My parents asked if I knew any of them to which I said, “Not anymore I guess”, with a sadistic grin on my face. A few weeks later, a memorial was held for Bri and her ex at the school where they had an assembly on the effects of intoxicated driving and how no self control will have bad consequences. I sat there to myself, chuckling every now and then. Nobody suspected a thing. I didn’t even care about the fact that I killed Bri, the love of my life. But do you want to know the reason why I did all of this? If I can’t have her. Nobody can.
