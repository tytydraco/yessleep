I sit at the corner of my bed, engrossed in my TikTok feed, murmuring to myself, "Just one more swipe," repeating the phrase over and over. But then, a convenient excuse arises: "Oh no, I need to use the restroom." It's a stall tactic, delaying the inevitable, for it's during these late-night hours that I find solace. With trousers lowered, I relieve myself while my fingers aimlessly navigate TikTok's endless scroll. It's in this moment, amidst the mindless swiping, that I realize the looming specter of impending tests. "I'll tackle that later," I reassure myself, my scroll uninterrupted. Eventually, I conclude my business, wash my hands, and casually dismiss the toothbrush and toothpaste – "Tomorrow, perhaps."

The following day, I face a choice between a punctual morning routine and an extra 25 minutes of slumber. The allure of more sleep prevails. Upon returning from school, my mother inquires, "How was school, ######?" My response, however, is less than enthusiastic. "I'd rather not discuss it," I reply, prompting my mother to express her concerns about my grades, punctuality, and the absence of my father. Frustrated, I push her away with a curt "Leave me alone; it's almost November."

Five hours later, darkness has fallen, and I've squandered the day in an endless TikTok trance. Sleep remains elusive. "Perhaps TikTok can provide solace," I think, but a sudden *knock* on my balcony door disrupts my thoughts. I investigate, only to find nothing. I glance at the mirror opposite my bed – still nothing. Minutes pass, and the knocking returns, this time with two forceful *knocks.* Peering outside, I spot a tall, emaciated figure, not quite human, more like a shadowy silhouette. Its head tilts to an unnatural angle, revealing white eyes and sharp teeth. The figure addresses me, "######, you've been struggling with sadness, insomnia, and deteriorating hygiene, along with bullying, am I right?"

I stutter in response, "Y-y-yes."

The figure grins, showcasing its eerie teeth, "######, I won't harm you. You don't need to be afraid. Or do you?"

I remain silent.

"Listen, ######, I can grant you a wish, but there must be something in exchange. You can choose to be wealthy, but someone else will be made poor to balance it out. Alternatively, you can bring back a loved one, but they'll have to be balanced as well. Or, there's a safer option where no one you care about will be affected. What's your choice, ######?"

As I observe the figure's eerie gestures with its long, spiky fingers, I ponder my response. "######... time's ticking..."

I finally speak, "Uh, I want..."
