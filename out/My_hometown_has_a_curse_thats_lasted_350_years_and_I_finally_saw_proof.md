I grew up in Sudbury, Massachusetts, about 20 miles west of Boston. It's one of those picture-perfect New England towns - colonial history, white churches, the works. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote about our historic Wayside Inn. We're proud of our Revolutionary War heritage.

But we don't talk much about Nobscot Hill.

Every kid in Sudbury grows up hearing the stories. The medicine man and his son. The betrayal. The curse spoken in 1676 that supposedly still echoes through the Scout reservation. I always figured it was just local folklore, the kind of spooky tales every small town tells itself.

Then I went on a night hike at Nobscot last month, and I can't explain what I saw.

Let me start with the history, because you need to understand why this place feels wrong.

In 1676, a Nipmuc medicine man named Tantamous lived peacefully on Nobscot Hill with his family. He had orchards, cornfields, lived alongside the colonists without trouble. Then King Philip's War broke out. When the brutal Lancaster raid happened and Mary Rowlandson was captured, Tantamous was suspected of involvement. Ironically, he actually helped negotiate her release.

His son, Peter Jethro, believed the English would show mercy if he turned his father in. He was wrong.

They marched Tantamous through Boston with a noose around his neck. At the Great Elm on Boston Common, as the rope tightened, Tantamous looked at his son in the crowd. Peter couldn't meet his eyes. Witnesses said the medicine man spoke words in the old Nipmuc language that made everyone shiver, though no one understood them.

That night, every colonist who watched the execution had the same dream: drums echoing from Nobscot Hill, though the hill was empty.

The stories started almost immediately.

In 1792, during a smallpox epidemic, the sick were taken to a pest house at the base of Nobscot. Victims spoke of an old Indian man who visited at night, touching foreheads, whispering in an unknown language. Those he touched died peacefully. Those he didn't lingered in agony for days. The doctor found circular grinding marks in the floor - stone on stone patterns that reappeared every morning no matter how many times he scrubbed them clean.

Henry David Thoreau encountered an old man in deerskin clothing near the collapsed cave in the 1850s. The man asked about someone named Peter. When Thoreau turned to get his notebook, the man vanished. Only wet footprints remained, leading uphill and stopping at the cave entrance.

When the Boy Scouts started building their reservation in 1928, survey stakes kept moving overnight. The foreman staked out a campsite over the old smallpox burial ground on Thirty Rod Trail. His tent collapsed with no wind. His compass spun wildly. He saw two men walking in circles around his camp all night - an old man in front who never looked back, a younger man following, reaching out, trying to speak.

Henry Ford tried to build a dam at the base of Nobscot in 1936. It failed four times. They found fresh grinding marks in the bedrock - two circles, one inside the other, forever intertwined, forever separate. They called it Ford's Folly and gave up.

And then there are the hooded figures.

Every September 26th, the anniversary of Tantamous's execution, people report bonfires just south of the fire tower. Figures in hoods stand in a circle, perfectly still, facing inward. They never speak, never move. Just watch something at the center that witnesses can never quite see.

I'd heard all these stories my whole life. I even hiked Nobscot dozens of times. Never saw anything unusual. I figured it was just small-town mythology, the kind of thing that makes a place feel special.

But last month, I was with friends at the reservation. We decided to do a night hike to Tippling Rock, it's a lookout point with views of Boston. It was late September, warm for the season.

We made it about halfway there when my friend Tia stopped. "Do you hear that?"

I didn't hear anything at first. Then I did. A rhythmic sound, like stone grinding against stone. Slow, purposeful, almost meditative.

"Probably just another hiker," I said, but my voice sounded uncertain even to me.

We kept going. The grinding sound got louder. And then we saw him.

An old man stood at Tippling Rock, silhouetted against the lights of Boston in the distance. He was wearing deerskin clothing, not the kind you buy at a shop, but something that looked ancient, weathered. He was crouched over stones, grinding something with rhythmic, practiced motions.

"Hey!" Tia called out. "You okay up there?"

The man looked up. Our flashlights hit his face.

I can't properly describe his eyes. They were impossibly sad, like they'd been watching something terrible for centuries and couldn't look away. His face was weathered, ancient, but somehow timeless.

He spoke one word. I don't know what language it was. It was definitely not English, not any language I recognized. The sound of it made my chest feel tight, like the air had gotten heavier.

"We should go," I whispered.

We backed away slowly. The old man watched us, then returned to his grinding. Stone on stone, rhythmic and endless.

When we looked back from the bottom of the trail, he was gone. But we could still hear that grinding sound, echoing through the trees. And something else. Footsteps. Two sets, walking in circles, one set heavier than the other.

We didn't talk about it on the hike back. We haven't really talked about it since.

But I've been researching. And I found something that made my blood run cold.

Boy Scout troops have reported the exact same thing. An old man in deerskin at Tippling Rock, grinding something with stones, speaking one word in an unknown language.

I think I know what Tantamous cursed that day in 1676. Not just the land. Not just the people who betrayed him. But his own son, Peter Jethro. Condemned to walk these hills forever, searching for his father, trying to apologize. And Tantamous, walking just ahead of him, always moving, never stopping, never turning around, never offering the forgiveness his son seeks.

The Nipmuc name for Nobscot was Penobscot: Place of the Falling Rock.

Some things fall and never stop falling.

I'm writing this because I need to know if anyone else has experienced this. If you've been to Nobscot Hill, if you've hiked near Tippling Rock or Thirty Rod Trail, if you've heard the grinding or seen the figures - please tell me I'm not losing my mind.

And if you're planning to visit Nobscot Hill, maybe avoid September 26th. Some debts can never be paid, no matter how many years pass. Some curses never lose their power.

The hill remembers. And it's still waiting.
