A short background on my girlfriend: She always saw things since she was a child. A hooded figure with bony hands behind her in the mirror, a wounded WW2 soldier lying in pain in her grandma's bathroom, a humanoid figure with black skin and bloodshot eyes staring at her through the trees at my university, misty figures following her classmate in the hallway, and she can sense if a place is "heavy". She told me she never dared to interact with them, because one time she stared back, it followed her home.

I used to tease her that maybe it was just her imagination, until I decided to live in her house.

In contrast, I was always the logical one. I didn't grow up knowing these superstitious beliefs. I was, in simple terms, a science enthusiast and a physics fanatic. I used to believe the world can always be explained through logic.

To give you a simple layout of her place, it is a corner lot in the suburbs, and her backyard is made up of two adjacent lots behind the house. The vegetation was not thick, only a few trees here and there, but the place had never been developed and so was left untouched even before her family settled.

We decided to live together because both of us got a work-from-home job. Eventually she took a liking towards gardening, so I helped her do a bit of landscaping in her backyard. That was when she told me this,

"Whenever you are trekking on unfamiliar grounds, or if you intend to disturb the place, always say *tabi-tabi po"*

The term is a Filipino word for "please excuse me" but is intended to pay respects to the unknown entities that *might* be living on that particular place. She said I should always do this every time, even if I had already been there, so that *they* won't get angry. What are *they*? She said they are ancient beings that already claimed the land, and if you give them proper respect, they will leave you alone.

However, those entities in her backyard are not what actually scares her. As I said, if you leave them alone, so will they.

It's the ones that is in her house.

Back when we were first dating, I had the pleasure of visiting her home. When I came in the door, the corner of my eye caught an older woman sitting on the couch, facing the TV. My first thought was maybe she was a visitor. The strange thing was, they never interacted with that woman. When I went out, I asked my girlfriend who was their visitor, the woman with a dark skin and curly hair, sitting on the couch. She looked puzzled and just said, "What woman?".

That was when she told me there was always a dark spirit/entity living in their house. There were times when she would swear there is someone moving around in her sister's room, but when she opened the door, no one was there. There were times when she would pass by her room with the lights off and something dark seems to be dancing around the bed. There were times when she was alone and she would hear the fridge open and close, or the dining chair would make a sound as if it were being dragged slightly. She would tell me that whenever she was alone, she would just stay on the porch until someone came home because she couldn't handle the heavy feeling of being watched.

As a Christian family, they would sometimes invite a priest to bless their house again to ward off evil spirits. One priest even confirmed that the room of her sister has a very dark aura. But, regardless of how many times they do this, nothing changes.

Her closest experience with this *entity* was when she woke up at around 3AM. That was when her mum was out of town. She went to her mother's room and saw that the door was open. She looked inside and no one was there, and as she was closing the door she felt something tall and dark was standing behind her. It sent chills down her spine and made her heart thump like crazy. She did not dare to look and dashed to her room.

She tried her best to calm herself that night. It's been a long time since she felt that kind of fear. As a matter of fact, she is not someone who gets easily scared. She can watch horror movies all night long and would just laugh about it, while I can't even watch one without having someone around and half-closing my eyes.

So, back to where I was - helping my girlfriend clean out her backyard for some gardening.

I was stubborn when it comes to superstitions, so as expected, I just brushed off my girlfriend's advice. The first incident was when I cut down the bananas. I just thought, what could possibly happen?

At that same night, I had a sleep paralysis - which I rarely had before. I was lying on my side with my back facing the window. I was wide awake, then I sensed the curtains moving, as if something was crawling inside. Slowly, I felt shivers down my back like something was there, watching me from behind. I tried my best to fall asleep again.

I told this to my girlfriend the following morning. She scolded me why I did not pay my respects, that's why they gave me a *visit* that night. I felt foolish and confused. Is this actually real? She gave me advice that there is no harm on doing it even if I don't believe. So, on the next landscaping activities, I tried my best to utter the words *tabi-tabi po* whenever I'm working at the deeper parts of their backyard.

Until one day, I forgot.

Her mum instructed me to make a temporary pole for the newly installed faucet at the back part of their backyard. I decided to just do it the easy way. So, I found a piece of cut wood with a sharp edge like a stake. I pierced it to the ground and pounded it repeatedly until it was halfway deep, then tied the faucet at the top. I never thought about it for the rest of the day until I fell asleep.

That night, I had the strangest dream.

I found myself walking deeper towards the backyard and accompanying me were several people - there was a little girl, a slightly overweight old man, some women and men. They were guiding me deeper into what looks like her backyard, but slightly different. The trees were not here before, and it looks like a new world. I realized I should stop walking, and they stopped too. Among all the *people* that were there, I can sense that the most dangerous one of them was the little girl. It feels as though she masks her evil with the innocence of a child.

Then the old man said to me, "I'm giving you a chance to go back, go now while you can, I will try to stop her" as she gestures to the girl.

I did my best to walk back while keeping my eyes glued to the old man and the girl. I can see the girl is trying to get past the old man, while the old man is blocking her path, the girl was growing more and more frantic as he did so. I know I don't have much time. I hurried to my girlfriend's house and went behind the gate. In her backyard, there was a small metal gate that separates her house from the backyard. There should be a padlock here, I know because it was my daily routine to lock this gate. But I couldn't find it until, I saw a small light coming from the backyard. It was a candle, its small flame flickering on the ground.

The old man is still preventing the girl from passing, and I went back to check what it is. As suspected, behind the candle was the padlock I was looking for, and it looks...broken. It was bent and unusable. I picked it up from the ground and as I looked forward, I saw something standing close to the fence that sent shivers down my spine.

It was a humanoid figure with the face of an owl. It was tall, and it just stared blankly at me with those huge black eyes. It was obvious at that point that this was a message, simple and clear.

*Do not test us, nothing will keep us from you.*

I went back inside the house, knowing that the gate was still unlocked. I tried to close all the doors, but something is preventing me from locking them. I peeked at the backyard and saw that the girl has already passed through the old man and was making her way towards the house. She was singing a song and as she got closer, her voice grew deeper, until she transformed into a grown man coming towards the house with malicious intent.

The man stopped at the doorway. Talking me into coming outside. I realized that maybe that was the end of his territory.

He couldn't come inside, because maybe, something much more powerful was already here. I confirmed this when I turned around and saw a group of people I never met. *It's them,* I thought.

One of them approach me. He's an adult man that looks tribal, with long hair, dense muscles, and an air of superiority. He seems to be their leader. He told me in his world, what I did should be paid with a higher price, perhaps a leg or an arm. He faced me with a combat stance and started throwing me punches.

In this situation, all I did was guard myself from his attacks. No matter how hard I block them, the punches were on a level of power I cannot comprehend, passing through my guard like a hot knife on butter. He was playing with me, because I knew that if it actually landed hard, I would feel a great amount of pain.

He stopped *sparring* when the other people there told him that it's enough.

Then I woke up.

I told my girlfriend everything I saw in my dreams, who scolded me again for being hardheaded by not paying respects. She told me that it was not only one or two entities that are currently residing here, but rather a group of them. She told me that no matter how many they are, they chose to live in harmony with each other, and so should we. She said that these entities, and spirits, are a mix of good and bad. I recalled that some of them helped me, while some tried to do harm, and some just gave me a warning.

Later that day her mum instructed me to go to the backyard and say sorry for disturbing their peace and not paying respect. I did exactly that and I didn't dream of it again.

Several months have passed, and whenever I remember that entity with a face of an owl, I still get shivers at the back of my neck.

Who knows what else could be out there, who knows what could have happened to me if I went deeper into the backyard, or if I faced that little girl who turned to a man.

Would I still wake up that day?

I thank all the good spirits who helped me, and I pray that the bad ones will leave me alone.

Starting that day, I started to believe. Even if I can't really sense or see them in real life, I know that they are out there, watching us go on our daily lives.

Remember, if ever you'll go somewhere you're not sure of, pay them respects. It might save you. Simply say,

*Tabi-tabi po.*
