I’m going to start [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/15gtncw/how_to_survive_college_we_can_all_learn_from_our/) off with the uncomfortable conversation I had with Cassie.  She wasn’t one to wait forever for difficult talks like I do, so barely a week after the incident that set all this off, she asked if I had some time to talk once we were both done with classes for the day.  We sat at opposite ends of the dorm room.  I was strategically positioned close to the door, in case I needed to run, I guess?  I don’t know, I just felt better with an escape route.

I’m not good at talking things through.

(if you’re new, [start here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/rnauck/how_to_survive_the_holidays/), and if you’re totally lost, [this might help](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/s75n1c/how_to_survive_college_index/))

Cassie took a deep breath and squeezed her hands together.  I tried to look earnest and open to whatever she was going to say.  I couldn’t let what I really felt show, because I desperately didn’t want to be there.  I wished she could just bury whatever she felt about this deep down inside and carry on as if nothing had happened.  It’s what I did.  Do?  I guess I tell you all about it now which is kind of like… journaling, I guess, so maybe that counts.

Hahah I know it doesn’t, I’m just stalling.

“I know you apologized,” she said, “and I know you had your reasons, but I’m really hurt that you didn’t tell me about Sarah.”

I opened my mouth to apologize yet again, but she quickly cut me off.  An apology wasn’t what she was looking for.

“I get why you did it,” she continued.  “You’ve had your own trauma with people dying and I know you’re working on it.  I know you’re talking to people about it and I’ve seen you practicing how to tell people difficult things, so I don’t want to go off on you for something you’re actively trying to fix.  It hurt, you apologized, and I accept that apology.”

Okay.  Good.  But this conversation wasn’t over.  If anything, Cassie looked even more nervous now, and Cassie is like… the Communication Queen here.  What the heck was so bad that she didn’t want to say it?  Did she accept my apology but *also* never wants to see me again?

“But there’s something else bothering me about all of this,” she continued, while I sat there miserably waiting for the final blow.  “We’re going to be living together next year.  In an apartment. If what you’ve told me about how these creatures work, we might not have protection there *either*, since it’s a rental and thresholds apply to *homes*.  You keep saying you’re trying to keep everyone safe but you’re not actually doing that by keeping secrets.  You’re not even keeping yourself safe.”

For a moment I only blinked at her like a cow watching the incoming headlights of a truck.  *This* was what was bothering her?  That we were going to live together?  Then my mind started to piece together the worst-case scenarios like it always does and I found the conclusion guaranteed to make me most miserable, because my brain hates me I guess.

“You don’t want to be roommates next year,” I mumbled.  “I get it.  I don’t blame you.”

“Jeez, Ashley, no!”

She sounded *shocked*.  Startled, I glanced up, and saw Cassie slowly and incredulously shaking her head at me.

“I mean, I *do* want to be your roommate,” she said.  “It’s just this one thing I think we need to work on first if this is going to turn out okay.”

Kind of a big ‘one thing’ if you ask me but I kept my mouth shut this time.  I’m working on the whole self-esteem thing, after all.  My brain might be telling me that it would only take one mistake for everyone in my life to leave me alone, but that was because my brain was prone to forming incorrect conclusions based on past events and I didn’t need to listen to it.

“So here’s what I want to happen,” Cassie continued.  “I want to know *everything* that’s going on with the inhuman… stuff… on campus.  Every little secret that could possibly affect me in the future.  Otherwise, as much as I want this to work out, you’d need to find somewhere else to live next year, because it won’t be with me.  What happened to Sarah was… awful… and I’m scared of it happening to me.  I need someone I can feel safe around.”

Yeah so Cassie’s name is the one on the lease so that’s fair.

Also I’m kind of pleased that all my friends are listening to the things I’m telling them, even if they are using it against me.

“Okay, but promise me you won’t share any of this with anyone else,” I said.  “This is really dangerous stuff and inhumans kind of hate a gossip.  I’m serious.”

It’s not so much as they hate a gossip but that talking about them can attract their attention, but whatever impressed upon Cassie the severity of the situation worked for me.  She nodded and said it was all strictly confidential between the two of us.  She had no desire to share it with anyone else.

“Even if I tell you something bad I did that might put someone else in danger?” I asked.

“If that’s the case, then I’ll help you figure out a way to deal with it and make sure it doesn’t happen again,” she said seriously.

Then we pinky-swore on it like we were five year olds.

I told her everything.  Yes, everything.  She was not thrilled about my agreement with the laundry lady but she understands why it looked like a good idea of the time.  We also weren’t able to come up with any better ideas while we were sitting there and we both think that the flickering man would have been a problem regardless of what I did.  That’s made me feel slightly better about my decisions, though Cassie said it was kind of like having to choose between a bowl of cheerios that’d been pissed in a little vs. a bowl that’d been pissed in a lot.

Colorful, yet accurate analogy.

I didn’t tell her about Grayson.  I got to that and was like, uh, I don’t feel comfortable telling you about something that someone human has explicitly said they don’t want spread around and she was like, cool, so then it’s something about either Grayson or Maria and said she wouldn’t pry further.

Her deductive leap isn’t that impressive.  I don’t have many friends.

Oh yeah and I told her about the devil being my tutor.

“Can I meet him!?” she squealed before I was barely done with my sentence.  “I have so many questions.  Like - the devil!  The *actual* devil!”

Uh, no, not the actual devil.  Not quite.  I had to explain that whole weird thing in that the devil takes a role in a lot of stories and it’s not the actual religious devil with all the baggage that comes with, but is still also the devil.  It’s like… he’s a convenient trickster that doesn’t take a lot of explanation.  Just slide him into the story and bam, the role is filled.

It didn’t dampen her enthusiasm.  I’m… concerned.

Honestly, it felt nice to get all this out into the open with someone.  I feel like the weight of the secrets I’ve been keeping has been grinding me down.  Like, I’m just… *tired* all the time now.  I’ve even tried going to bed earlier but I still wake up exhausted.  Just being able to talk with someone about everything has helped a lot.  No offense to all of you, but it’s different being able to talk it through with someone you see every single day.

She agrees that getting rid of the flickering man is our top priority.  However, she also thinks that my mere existence is pissing him off plenty now, so I shouldn’t do anything dramatic to get his attention.  We know his rules now and if I keep following them for long enough, he’ll get impatient and make a mistake.  I just need to be careful to make sure he screws up first.

To that end, she bought me a backup umbrella.  I already have one, but she bought another, a small one that fits in my backpack.  And one of those disposable plastic ponchos.  Just in case.  She left them on my desk with a little card that had a cat on the front and was blank inside and she’d written ‘please don’t die’ in it.  That’s friendship, y’all.

In the meantime, she thinks we should try to find out who tipped the Folklore Society members off about the graveyard.  She’s not interested in going in there herself, not even to locate another piece of petrified wood.  Not until we know more about it and the creature that inhabits it.  The groundskeeper wouldn’t be a very good guardian if he couldn’t catch up with anyone, she pointed out, so it seems there might be more to his abilities than we’ve seen so far.  Him rising out of the earth is of particular concern.  It’d be pretty bad if we went in there in search of a rock and he popped out right next to us.  Besides, I’d told her that one of the people I can’t talk about (so Maria or Grayson) had done something to hopefully drive off the creature stalking her for a while.  She’s willing to take the risk, especially since we’re near the end of the school year and won’t be living in the dorms next year.

Assuming it can’t follow us off campus, of course.  Hopefully this place works like old land and it’s trapped within the borders of the university property.

Our current theory is that whoever informed the Folklore Society could also be the person who slipped that note about me under Daniel’s door.  If you’ve all been trying very hard to forget about him like I have, let me remind you that Daniel is the spineless fuckface who let the worm out of the hallway and then spent his time alternating between angrily confronting me for not helping him and avoiding me.

They were not able to save his ear, for the record.  I feel slightly bad about that.

Anyway, he got a note slipped under his door and between that and the tip-off at the Folklore Society, it seems plausible that there’s someone else out there that knows more than the average student and is also trying to avoid being identified.  I asked Maria if she was at the last Folklore Society meeting and she said she was not.  I asked if she could try to find out who knew about the graveyard visiting hours, as I don’t want to talk to the society president myself ever again.  It’s nice having an intermediary.

“What if,” Cassie said over dinner in the meal hall, “it’s your folklore professor.”

“She did tell me about the graveyard visiting hours,” I replied, “but I can’t see her slipping notes under someone’s door.”

“Fair.  But that means if it *is* her that told about the graveyard, then we’ve confirmed that the note-informant isn’t the same person as the graveyard-informant.”

I didn’t think that would help us that much, but if nothing else maybe I could tell the professor that her attempt to help the Folklore Society had almost landed them in big trouble.  I’d leave out the part about the groundskeeper trying to kill us all, of course, and say they got busted for trespassing and were kicked out with a warning.  She seemed like the sort to be upset about that.  I certainly have a few professors that couldn’t care less what their students get up to, but the folklore professor genuinely cares about the club she sponsors.

The weather forecast for the main event of today’s post was cloudy with a chance of rain.  Which is the weather around here like… 80% of the time.  And I’m sure you all know what this means already.  Things could get real bad real fast.  However, I was armed with two umbrellas, a poncho, and a textbook I needed to read three chapters of before the next class in case I got stuck inside somewhere for a few hours.

This is how it is living on old land.  We adapt to the danger.

Surprisingly, I wasn’t the only person going to Professor Beatrice’s office hours.  There was already someone there and I had to wait in the hallway.  And of course, it started to rain while I was there.  Not hard, but enough that I really wanted whoever was talking to the professor to hurry the fuck up and get out of there before it got worse.  I really didn’t want to be stuck in this tiny building with just Professor Beatrice and Professor “I have opinions about Marvel” down the hall.

Yes, I’m getting to know the popular culture department, since there’s only like three of them.  They’re all nice and interesting to talk to, but I really don’t care to talk about movies since watching movies was about the only thing to do in my hometown and the theater changed up their lineup only like once every three months.  I’m kind of *over* movies.

And before anyone says ‘streaming?’ let me just say that the internet is real bad back home.  Kate was about the only one with a good connection and that was mostly because it made the campground more appealing for paying customers.

I practically bolted into the office as soon as the other student exited.  Professor Beatrice didn’t even have time to remember who I was before I launched into it.

“Did you tell the Folklore Society about the graveyard visiting hours?” I demanded.

She blinked at me owlishly and stammered for a moment, finally taking off her glasses to clean them in an attempt to collect her thoughts.  I continued on ruthlessly.  I have glasses myself.  I know this trick.

“They trespassed and got thrown out.  Did you hear about that?”

I glared at her, surprised by how angry I was.  All that resentment was bubbling up in me, about all those stupid people in that stupid club who thought this was all just a *game* and got themselves in danger or *killed* like Patricia and the rest and then *I* had to deal with the fallout if only because… because…

I guess because there’s no one else who will.

Maybe this is why I’m so tired all the time.

“Well, I did tell them,” she said nervously.  “Or at least, I told one of the students in my class who is part of the club.  But I warned them to be respectful!  The administration is very strict on entering the graveyard and I said that.”

“Did you tell them about the aggressive groundskeeper that watches the clock for when it closes?” I asked through clenched teeth.

“Oh, they didn’t say anything about a groundskeeper,” she fretted.

Wait.  They?  They didn’t say anything?  My brain churned over this.

“Who… told you about the graveyard visiting hours?” I asked tentatively.

“Some student I didn’t recognize.  I thought he was part of the club at first, but I haven’t seen him since.”

“Hang on,” I said, reaching for my phone.  “I might have a photo of him.”

I planned to show her a photo of Grayson.

I had my phone unlocked when the rain slammed into the window.  It wasn’t pouring yet, but the wind was certainly picking up.  I could feel a thin sliver of cold air prying its way into the room.  Professor Beatrice sighed and levered herself out of her chair.

“I keep asking them to do something about the drafts,” she muttered.  “Just part of being in an old building, I guess.”

She stood and walked over the window.  I thought… I figured she’d just… push down on the frame or something.  I just automatically came to that conclusion and I didn’t realize what she was actually doing, not until it was too late to say anything.

She opened the window first.  Raised it a few inches and jiggled it in its frame, clearly intending to shut it again with it better on track and then latch it.  But that never happened.

The rain slammed into the window with a sudden gust of wind.  It splattered through the screen and landed on the floor.

And the flickering man came with it.

He glanced between the two of us, his eyes sharpening as he assessed the situation.  I didn’t even have time to get out of my chair, much less scream, before he slammed the heel of his hand into my chest, just below the ribcage.  The air was pushed out of my lungs in a rush and I crumpled to the ground, wrapping my arms around my chest, unable to suck in fresh air.

“*Technically* that was borderline against the rules,” he said cordially.  “But I can’t have you drawing attention right now.”

I reached up and grasped for the edge of the desk.  The pain focused my thoughts, astonishingly.  I wasn’t paralyzed with terror.  Like the fire in my lungs was enough to keep the ice at bay.  I pulled myself to my feet just in time to see the flickering man grab Professor Beatrice by the throat.

Her back was against the wall and she weakly slapped at his fingers, her eyes wide with disbelief and terror.  Her glasses were askew, hanging off one ear.  She met my gaze and I saw the desperation in it.

Help me, it pleaded.  Help me.

“You were *told* there are certain things you can’t talk about,” he snarled.  “Did you think their warning was just for show?  That you didn’t have to follow the rules because none of this could be real?  Because *I* couldn’t be real?”

I didn’t know what to do.  I didn’t have a weapon.  The seconds seemed to slow into years as I cast about frantically, while the flickering man reached for her face with his free hand.  My backpack, I thought.  There was a heavy textbook in there.  I seized one of the straps.

“If you won’t do as you’re told,” he said grimly, “Then I’ll make sure you have no choice but to comply.”

I swung it at the back of his head right as he jerked his arm back.  Professor Beatrice shuddered, made a strangled noise of pain, and her eyes rolled back in her head.  Her entire body went limp and he let go, letting her sag to the ground.  Between two fingers was clutched something pink and wet and dripping blood.

Her tongue.  He’d ripped her tongue out.

I stopped in half-swing, recoiling in horror.  The backpack’s momentum carried it forward despite my sudden lack of resolve and the textbook slammed firmly into the flickering man’s back.  He grunted softly, the only indication he made that it’d hurt him.

He drew his shoulders back, straightening his shoulders.  Casually, he released the tongue, and let it fall to the ground.  Beatrice was doubled over at his feet but I could only spare her the briefest of glances, because the flickering man’s attention was on me now.

I backed away.  He took one step forward, lunging for the backpack, and snatching it from my hands.

Then he threw it in my face.

Literally.

There was a bright burst of pain, a horrific crunching noise, and I stumbled and fell backwards, landing heavily on the ground.  I tasted copper in my mouth and frantically, I ran my tongue along my teeth to see if any had been knocked loose.  But the pain was higher, I realized, and the blood in my mouth wasn’t just from the cuts in my lip.

The textbook had slammed firmly into my nose.

The flickering man loomed over me, his hands curling and uncurling into fists as he waged an internal war with himself.  He wasn’t allowed to kill me, but I felt the murderous intention radiating off him.  He wanted to break the rules so very badly.  I sat there, shaking, covering my face with both hands and with tears streaming down my cheeks.

“That looks broken,” he finally said, roughly.  “Guess we’re even now in that regard.”

My nose.  He’d broken my nose.  Blood dribbled down my lips and chin, falling in thick droplets onto my shirt.  From behind the desk, I heard Professor Beatrice gagging and coughing.  She was trying to scream for help.  I needed to get her help.

Shakily, my head swimming, I pushed myself up and staggered into the hallway.  I didn’t spare the flickering man a second glance.  I needed out of there before he changed his mind and I needed to find help.

One of Beatrice’s colleagues - the professor that is into comic books - was in his office.  The look on his thin face, a mixture of shock and fear, when I barged in is etched in my mind.  But at least he had the presence of mind to take charge of the situation - whatever it was - and started making phone calls for help.

To campus security.  Then to 911 for an ambulance.  And in all this commotion as they loaded Professor Beatrice up to get her help… I was just politely ushered to the side by a strangely slack-eyed security officer and told I could go.

I could take a hint.  The administration didn’t want me involved any further.

I wonder if it’s the flickering man that is controlling campus security.

I went to the student health center.  My nose was broken.  Not badly.  I told them I ran into a door and they put it right and gave me a prescription for the pain.  Also my glasses are now held together by a piece of tape around the bridge.

I don’t know what’s happened to Professor Beatrice, because Professor Comic Book has taken over the class and is managing to find a comic reference that matches every folklore theme we’re going over.  I kind of hate it and I wonder if it’s because I can’t look at him and think of his face, mouth open, eyes wide, staring at me in horror while Professor Beatrice choked on her own blood in the other room.

I need to find a way to stop going to this class.  I can’t do this.

There’s so much I want to ask Professor Beatrice, but I don't know how to find her.  I’m afraid to go to her colleagues or any of the other professors to ask for help.  Not while the flickering man is still around, watching everyone and making sure they all do as they’re told.

I want to know what it was Professor Beatrice wasn’t supposed to reveal.  Who it was that warned her.  Someone from the administration, as part of her hiring?  What was it they told her?  But I’m afraid to seek her out because what if I do and what if the flickering man decides to take more permanent measures to silence her?

I couldn’t live with that.

But I will be talking to Grayson.

I hate saying this, but I’m worried he’s the person that told Professor Beatrice about the graveyard.  He’s already familiar with the inhuman things on campus and doesn’t seem afraid of them.  As much as I like him and value his friendship, I also can’t ignore the possibility that he might be using other people to get close to the tree.  The folklore society’s mission was targeted, after all.  They were searching for the tree.

Because if it’s what’s siphoning his dad away, then he might just be desperate enough to risk the lives of others.

I really hope I’m wrong.  But when dad didn’t come back… I felt so helpless and I wonder if I’d been offered a thin glimmer of hope, a chance to find out what happened to him, a chance to bring him back… I wonder if I would have taken it, no matter the cost.
