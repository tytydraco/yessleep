Every day’s a pattern. Different news, different tragedies, different war, different weather—but the rhythm stays the same. Like a song on shuffle, never new, just remixed. Same beer, different label. Same couch, same TV, same haze of Budweiser and regret. That’s the real curse, I think—not the things that change, but the things that don’t.

Some days, though, they rot from the inside out.

It started with the walls. At first, just a tickle behind the paint. Like the drywall was whispering. A soft sound, like something breathing slow through plastic. Then the holes appeared. Tiny ones, too precise for rats, too careless for tools. I remember staring at one and realizing it had depth. Like it didn’t just go through the wall—it went into something. Something else. Something that waited.

Only other tenants on the floor are a man and his daughter. The building’s silent otherwise. Like it’s gone to sleep and left us behind. No one’s ever seen the mother. Not once. Her absence doesn’t even feel tragic—it feels manufactured, like a character cut from the script last minute. No obituary, no photos. Just a girl with quiet eyes and a father who twitches when you speak too loud.

He mutters in the hallway late at night, pacing like he’s walking the length of some invisible cage. I tried talking to him once, offered a beer out of politeness or desperation—I can’t remember which. He wouldn’t take it. He just blinked at me and said, “I can’t afford a drill, okay?” Then walked away. Another time, I passed him by the elevator and he said, “My daughter’s fine.” But I hadn’t said a word.

Lately, the holes have been getting bigger. They multiply while I sleep, each one blooming like rot in fruit. And the arguing—God, the arguing. I don’t know what they fight about. It sounds like gibberish most of the time. Angry sounds without words. Like he’s not talking to her anymore. Like he’s talking to the hole.

I try to drown it out. Budweiser helps. TV helps less. The channels are sick. One night I was watching Family Guy reruns—nothing special—when it glitched. It cut to a video. Just a loop: a plug being pushed into an outlet. Over and over. No sound. Just that slow, deliberate motion. Click. Out. Click. In.

After that, things got stranger.

Another night, I turned the TV on and saw the plug again. But then, a second clip. A glass filling with a thick liquid. Not water. Something darker, slower. Then it went back to the plug. Over and over.

I told myself it was a signal issue. That the beer was screwing with my head. That I was tired. That’s always the easiest lie: I’m just tired.

Something keeps drawing my eyes to the hole. The biggest one, right near the baseboard by the bathroom. Every time I pass it, my head tilts slightly, like I’m listening for something just beneath human hearing. I hesitate. I always hesitate. What if he sees me again? What if he knows I’m watching?

But last night, I gave in.

My apartment smelled like old aluminum and rotten paper—too many cans, too much mail. I’d stopped opening it weeks ago. The hole was just there, waiting. A tiny, perfect circle into nothing.

I got down on the floor. Pressed my cheek to the cold laminate. Peered inside.

Under a bed.

That’s what I saw. Just legs. Pale. Motionless. Bare feet, toes curled slightly inward like the person had been still for a long time. I couldn’t tell if they were asleep. Or unconscious. Or…

And behind me, the TV kept playing. The plug. The cup. And now—a toilet. Flushing. It wasn’t just a clip. It was a sequence. A message. I just didn’t know if it was for me, or about me.

I stared. I couldn’t move. Not even when I heard the sobbing.

Soft, broken. Close, but not from the TV. Not from the hall. From inside the hole. From under the bed. And then a voice followed it.

“You like that, don’t you?”

It was the man’s voice. Except—I swear to God—I knew that voice.

Because it was mine.
