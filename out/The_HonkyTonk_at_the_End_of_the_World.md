A musician's life can be a lonely one. I should know, I've been living it for quite a while now. I suppose there are worse things. I don't mind it just being me and the open road, occasionally touring with a couple of buddies, when schedules permit. You've probably never heard of me. I have a few albums here and there, but my monthly Spotify listeners are only in the triple digits. Mainly, I just play classic country songs in rustic bars for people who can't stop dreaming about the good old days. 

It was one of those nights when I was way out in the boonies, the kind of night with no moon in the sky and a only a few dozen stars scattered about where there wasn't any cloud cover. Never much did like nights like this. Always felt something unsettling about them. Maybe that's just the way it is for everybody, though, I don't know. 

I was driving down a long country road, where I had nothing but cornfields to guide my way. There are a lot of places like that in the US. It's easy to get lost out here, surrounded by nothing but sun-beaten stalks that would go up in flames in seconds if you were to toss a cigarette butt out the window. 

I've never been much of a smoker or a drinker. Every once in a while I'll break down and have a beer. When you drive as much as I do, it's best not to be even the last bit intoxicated. Besides, my daddy was a hard-core smoker and an alcoholic, and it killed him young. He was only forty-three when he died. I was still in grade school. 

I didn't even know what the place I was playing at tonight looked like. There were no recent pictures online, and my GPS had been doing a foul job of even taking me to the grocery store lately. I'd been told it was somewhere just off Route 32, on the outskirts of some podunk town I'd never heard the name of. It was cold that October night, as it was getting close to Halloween. I really should've brought a better coat. 

I saw old neon flashing up ahead, and figured I must be getting close. If there's one thing those old honky-tonks love, it's neon. While the rest of the world keeps on moving, those cowboy bars are still stuck back somewhere in 1970, when Johnny Cash was king and no one had ever heard of an Instagram profile. 

As I pulled into the parking lot, I was greeted by a sign that read, "The Honky-Tonk at the End of the World." It was a unique name, I had to admit. There were only a few other cars in the parking lot, most beat-up old pickups that had probably seen their prime upwards of five decades ago. Most of them still looked pretty new, though, which was surprising. Never knew farmers and ranchers to care so much for their old hauls, but perhaps I just didn't know the right ones. 

It was dark and smoky inside, with a Budweiser sign behind the bartender providing most of the light at the counter. I plopped my guitar case down next to me and asked the man where I should start setting up. He made a vague gesture to a poorly-lit stage somewhere in the back recesses of the place, and went back to cleaning a few glasses. He didn't even ask for my name. 

"Payment comes after the set. Play whatever you want, these old geezers don't care anyway. Most of them are just trying to escape their wives for the night." 

I briefly thought about my own ex-wife, and wondered what she was doing now. We had been too young when we got married- straight out of high school. It was one of those shotgun weddings. Guy gets girl pregnant, girl's father forces guy to marry her. I had foolishly thought we were in love. I wish I would've known that she'd just take the baby and run. Last I knew, she'd shacked up with some rich guy out in Des Moines, and they were preparing for baby number two. I didn't even know if my daughter knew about me. I doubted she did. In the seven years since we'd been separated, I'd only talked to Melanie once. Now I was pushing thirty with nothing to show for it but a few shitty songs and a monthly child support payment. 

I plugged in my guitar to the amp, something which had also seen better days. There was a lone light on on the stage, and I pulled the single fold-up chair over to it. There was something so strange about this place, like it was not only desperately trying to hold on to the past, but that the past had never even left it. 

I lightly tapped the mic to see if it was on before introducing myself. "Hello, everyone. My name is David Brian. I'll be your entertainment for tonight." 

I began with one of my own songs, one I'd written pretty shortly after the divorce had been finalized. It was full of soulful lyrics. Well, as soulful as you could get for a twenty-one year old kid, I supposed. It talked about the long drive back to an empty house, knowing that the ghosts of memories past would always keep you company. 

I felt eyes on me, and noticed an old man at the bar had turned to look at me. He was probably about seventy years old, with a beard that hung to about the middle of his chest. What little lighting there was was reflected in his eyes, and I could swear I saw a tear run down the side of his face. 

I continued on, getting lost in the music, so I didn't even notice when a small crowd had begun to gather around the stage. The door opened, and more people were beginning to come in. Gathered around me were a mix of young and old, farmers and townies, women and men, all listening to this young twenty-something belt out song after song about growing up in rural Iowa with an addict father and mother who'd never quite learned to stand up for herself, or her son. 

I was jerked out of my reverie by a small voice in the back. It was a girl. Two red braids hung down to her waist, and her face was dotted with freckles. She probably wasn't even old enough to drink, but I doubt the bartender cared. It didn't seem like a lot of business happened here, so he was probably happy with whatever little amount of money he could drum up. 

"Excuse me," she said. Her voice was surprisingly high-pitched. "Do you know any Johnny Cash?" 

I smiled that fake smile that all show business people know, and replied with, "Sure, darling," before launching into a rendition of "Folsom Prison Blues." 

I watched as she grabbed the old man standing next to her, and encouraged him to begin stamping his feet and twirling her around. Pretty soon, chairs and tables had been shoved out of the way to make room for a dance floor, and couples of all ages were now dancing together. I switched over into some other classics, and a couple of lines formed. Even the bartender briefly stopped what he was doing to look up at what was happening. 

I don't know how long I played, only that I finished sometime around the early hours of the morning. There were still a few hangers-on by that point and they begged me to stay, but I said that I'd better be getting home. I was playing a hometown venue with my boys tomorrow, and didn't want to show up late with bags under my eyes. There was a chorus of "ahhhs" and "darns," but I promised I'd be back sometime soon, and that I'd really enjoyed my time at this little place out in the middle of nowhere. 

I unplugged my guitar, packed it back into its case, and strode over to the counter. The bartender smiled as he handed me a pile of crisp twenties. 

"That was some fine playin', son," he smiled a gap-toothed smile. "Busiest this place has been in years. Thank you." 

I returned the expression. "No, thank you for letting me play here." 

"You come back sometime soon, alright?" 

I nodded. 

I shoved the wad of cash into my pockets and headed out to my car. The parking lot was more full now, with only about five or so empty spaces. A light snow had begun to fall, and I felt it crunch under my boots as I walked. 

Almost as soon as I reached the highway back home, my phone began to buzz loudly. I answered after the third ring to be greeted by the voice of a very irate man. 

"Goddammit, David, I've called you five times already! You were supposed to be here for your set hours ago. What the hell happened?" 

I was confused. I'd just spent the night playing my heart out, and drawn perhaps the best crowd of my life, too. 

"Mr. Collins, I assure you, I was there. I just finished up. Your bartender payed me and everything. " 

"He most certainly did not! The Last Little Jukebox on Earth was silent as a grave tonight. Couldn't even get our namesake to work; it broke down and just kept playing 'Folsom Prison Blues.'" 

"I'm sorry, did you say The Last Little Jukebox on Earth, or The Honky-Tonk at the End of the World?" 

"The first one, of course!" he sounded near deranged now. "Why would I tell you to go to a place that hasn't existed for fifty years?" 

"I---- what do you mean fifty years?" 

"The Honky-Tonk at the End of the World burnt down on this night back in 1973," Mr. Collins explained. "Nothing left there except a few charred pieces of wood." 

I couldn't believe it. "I'm sorry, Mr. Collins, I have to go." 

I hung up the phone just as he was winding up to start yelling at me. I didn't care. The Last Little Jukebox would be one bar I was never invited back to, but I had to see for myself if what he'd said was true. This had to be some sort of prank for me showing up at the wrong venue. The Honky-Tonk had seemed so real. Hell, I could still smell the scent of stale cigarette smoke and hard liquor that lingered in my nostrils. 

I turned right around and came back the way I'd come. When I reached the spot where there had before been a small bar, I found nothing but an overgrown parking lot and a few charred pieces of wood that had once held the place together. Not even the sign was left. I reached into my pocket to see if the twenty dollar bills the bartender had given me were still there, but all I pulled out was a pile of ash. It seemed the place really *was* at the end of the world, and I had spent my night playing to ghosts. 

Now, I'm not really the type to believe in that sort of thing, but I can't deny what happened to me that night. Call me crazy, but I was *there.* I played for those people, and I received that cash after talking to the bartender. 

I drove home in silence, and made it back just as the sun began peeking over the horizon. I dashed off a text to my friends and the owner of the place we were supposed to be playing that night, with some lame excuse that I wasn't feeling my best and wouldn't be able to make it. I tried to get to sleep, but just found myself staring at the ceiling while the light peeked in over the tops of my curtains. What if I had just dreamed last night? But I knew I hadn't. Somehow, someway, I had entered into the world of the past for just one night, and gotten to play music for a few lost souls. Perhaps I'd been wandering in my own little world so long that I'd found myself in the land of the dead, I really don't know. 

But if you're ever out on Route 32 and you come across an old bar with a blinking neon sign that reads "The Honky-Tonk at the End of the World," be sure to stop on in and dance with the ghosts that haunt the old place out past all the cornfields. I promise you won't regret it.
