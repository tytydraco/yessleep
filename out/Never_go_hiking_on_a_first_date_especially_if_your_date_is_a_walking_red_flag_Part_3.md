Paranoia had taken full hold of me at that point. 

Before I knew it, my fingers were hovering over my keyboard as I typed out a frantic message to Joshua: “There’s something in my house!” 

But just before I hit send, I hesitated. I didn’t want to worry him, maybe I really was just seeing things. After taking a few deep breaths I was starting to convince myself it was all inside my head. One alcohol and painkiller infused dream, and a strange smudge on a spoon was not something worth losing your mind over.  

Instead, I rewrote the message, keeping it casual: *“Hey, wanna come over and hang out?”*

Thankfully, he responded quickly, saying he could stop by after work. It makes sense why my first instinct was to invite Joshua over. He's always been calm and collected, someone who could keep their cool under extreme pressure, and in that moment I really needed someone like that around. He’s the most reliable person I know, and not just because he is the only person I know. 

The waiting alone almost killed me, I was painfully aware of every shifting shadow just outside my periphery. For the next hour, I stood with my back pressed against my front door, staring down the hallway, half-expecting one of those bony white legs to poke out from one of the rooms. But nothing came. Relief washed over me when I finally heard the familiar sound of Joshua’s car pulling up. Until I heard something else above me. 

A faint, rhythmic tapping, like the muffled clatter of a typewriter, It moved quickly toward the front of the house. My stomach twisted into a knot. It could’ve been anything. A bird or a squirrel skittering across the roof. But I knew it wasn’t outside. The sound had to have come from the attic above me, I say attic, but it’s more of a crawlspace, crammed with old pipes, cobwebs, and dusty boxes where my grandmother kept her junk.

I didn’t wait to dwell on what could be making the sound, so I quickly stepped outside, anxious to greet Joshua, desperate to forget whatever I may or may not have heard. As soon as he turned off his headlights and my eyes adjusted to the dark, I saw something that scattered my thoughts and sent a chill through me.

Hanging from the tree in my front yard were the same strange white fruits I had seen on my way to the waterfall. Only now did I realize they weren’t fruits at all. They were cocoons, and they were much smaller than I remembered them being, about the size of slightly overgrown pinecones.

The optimist in me wondered, just for a second, what kind of beautiful butterfly or moth might emerge from them. But that thought was fleeting, because that wasn’t what really caught my attention.

At the bottom of the tree, hung an old tire swing. 

I turned to look at my house, it was the same one I had walked into just yesterday. The same house from the photograph. My mind reeled. How could I forget something so obvious? Was the memory loss a delayed symptom of my accident? I know memory loss can be a long-term consequence of a traumatic brain injury, but the doctors assured me that my brain was fine, it was just my neck that got injured in the accident.

This alone was worrying me, but then an even more terrifying thought crept in. Was I already experiencing the same slow, heartbreaking decline that my grandmother had? No. That couldn’t be. I was only 25, far too young, even for the rarest cases of early-onset dementia. 

My heart pounded in my chest, but I tried my best to play it off. 

“Hey, did you know there was a tire swing here?” I asked, trying to sound casual.

Joshua laughed and pointed at his arm. “Dude, don't you remember? I broke my arm on that thing when we were kids.”

I stared at him blankly. I didn’t remember. And then the realization hit me, I couldn’t even recall when or how Joshua and I first met.

I felt my chest tighten, panic setting in, but Joshua’s easygoing reassurance kept me grounded. We went inside, and with his presence, the house felt different. Less cold, less silent.

As we cleaned up the broken glass and picture frames, I told him about the photograph I’d found. I hesitated before asking about the two strangers. I left out the part about the house.

“Do you know who these two people are?” I asked, pointing at the unfamiliar faces.

Joshua took an uncomfortably long pause before answering.

“Uh… I mean, not exactly. I just always assumed they were your parents. For as long as I’ve known you it’s always just been you and your grandmother. She told me you lost them when you were really young, and… well, I never asked about your parents because it always seemed like a sore topic.”

I frowned. “I don't even remember them. How could it be a sore topic?”

Joshua hesitated. “That's not what it seemed like when we were kids, but I’m glad you’ve moved on.”

I wasn’t sure what to say to that. Instead, I asked: “This might sound like a stupid question, but how long have we known each other?”

“Since we were twelve—no, ten. I remember because I had to wear a cast for my eleventh birthday.”

“What’s the story behind that?”

Joshua grinned. “You seriously don't remember breaking your arm?”

My eyes shot open. “My arm? I thought you said it was yours?”

“Yeah… we both did.”

“How the hell did we manage that?”

“We wound up the rope as tight as we could, so high we could barely reach the tire. But somehow, we both grabbed onto the tire and spun… and we spun so fast we didn’t even realize at some point we were holding onto each other instead of the tire. The ground reminded us of that, though. We hit it hard, and for the next three months, we sported matching casts. Yours was on your right, and mine on my left.” 

Joshua chuckled. “I remember you tried to sign mine with your left hand, but after failing miserably, you just drew a crooked smiley face instead. You seriously don’t remember any of this?”

My mind swam, but nothing he said rang a bell. “Give me another story, please!” I said, a little too desperately. 

Joshua thought for a moment. “Okay, let's see… do you remember the time we hopped the fence into your neighbor’s yard to steal lemons from his tree?”

The memory came easily, as if it had been waiting just beneath the surface. “Yes! I do. I remember my grandmother needed lemons for a pie she was baking… hell, I even remember the exact amount of lemon juice the recipe called for.”

Joshua smiled. “Yeah, your grandmother made the best lemon meringue pie.”

“Right! The perfect mix of sweet and sour.”

For a moment, I felt relieved. Grateful, even. At least Joshua had reminded me of one cherished childhood memory. Maybe I wasn’t losing my mind, not the good parts anyway. And on top of that, Joshua assured me that forgetting pieces of your childhood is normal.

But then, I told him about the dripping.

I hesitated before mentioning the things I’d seen, but before I could say anything, he offered to check the crawlspace for leaks.

“No!” The word came out a little too suddenly.

Joshua froze, confused by my outburst. Then his expression shifted, and with concern in his voice he asked “Hey… are you okay?”

I forced a laugh. “Yeah, man. It’s nothing.”

Joshua was my only friend. I couldn’t afford to drag him into this, it was careless of me to invite him over in the first place. I knew he wouldn’t believe me, and I knew the kind of person he was. He’d grab a flashlight and crawl right into that shallow attic just to prove me wrong. And I couldn’t risk that. So instead, I waved him off with some vague assurances that I would be fine, I thanked him for coming over, and ushered him out the door, closing it behind him. 

He stood outside the door for a second, taking a deep breath, his words catching in his throat before he spoke. “I can tell something’s up, if you need anything just let me know, I’m here for you man.”

He waited for a response but I remained silent. With a defeated sigh, I heard his heavy steps trail off towards his car, the sound of his car engine was the last thing I heard as it left my driveway, followed only by silence.  

I was alone again, and I could feel the silence growing louder, and in that silence, I swore I could hear the faintest tapping above me. 

"Fuck this" I muttered under my breath, my voice low but firm. I grabbed my laptop and rushed down the hallway to my room, slamming the door behind me and locking it. I had no idea if that thing could use door handles, but I wasn’t about to find out.

That night, I barely slept. At one point, I even considered calling the police, and asking them to check the attic. But what if they found nothing, and fined me for wasting their time? What if they took me back to another hospital or some psychiatric facility? The thought kept me awake, scratching at the edges of my mind like a creature scratching at the door to be let in. These thoughts persisted all throughout the night. 

Morning finally came, but I stayed locked in my room until the afternoon. Then I heard a noise I hadn't heard in weeks… one that sent a strange mix of relief and unease through me.

The sound of someone knocking on my front door. I walked up to my bedroom door and pressed my ear against it. Who the hell could that be? I thought to myself.

“Who is it!” I shouted, hoping for the sound of my voice to reach the front door so I didn't have to.

A faint voice answered from outside. A woman’s voice. Sweet. Familiar.

Moira?

Without a second’s hesitation, I unlocked my bedroom door and bolted towards my front door with complete disregard for my neck brace and aching joints.

I reached for the handle but froze, catching sight of my reflection in the hallway mirror. I looked disheveled, unkempt hair, dark circles under my eyes, a shirt I’d been wearing far too long. I couldn’t let her see me like this. 

“Moira?” my voice was a meek whisper.

"Yeah it’s me, Joshua called me. And he- He’s… worried about you. He asked me to stop by." Her voice sounded unsure, her pauses were a little bit too long. She was either unsure of what to say or choosing her words very carefully.

"I told Joshua I was fine" I said, trying to sound casual, though I knew she could sense I was lying.

“Can I come in?” she asked, her question hanging in the air around me.

I hesitated. If I didn’t let her in, she might disappear for another two weeks. I wasn’t willing to risk that. I looked over at the mirror and straightened out my hair as best as I could. I threw on a coat to cover up my stained shirt and before turning away from the mirror I glanced up at the reflection one last time, instinctively checking the ceiling above me. Nothing. The hallway behind me was clear too. I shook my head. Don’t be ridiculous, I thought, forcing myself to act naturally.

I opened the door.

In the bright morning light, Moira looked just as radiant as I remembered, but as she stepped inside, I sensed something different. She seemed… tired. The same dark circles shadowed her eyes too, and her skin wasn’t as smooth as before. Had she been struggling these past few weeks too?

She walked right by me without stopping. She headed straight for the dining room, and sat down on the old chair, almost like she’d done it a hundred times before. I wordlessly traced her footsteps to the dining room and sat down beside her. She looked sad. She asked why I hadn't called and I reminded her I didn't have a phone. I brought up the message I sent but she just shook her head. I already knew she had been offline since our date.

We talked for hours, I spent most of the time apologizing and she asked me how I had been. I didn't give any specifics and just told her I had been having a rough time since I got back from the hospital. She said she could tell and a wave of shame washed over me. She offered to run me a bath and told me to ask her if I needed help. The wave of shame was now a riptide, pulling me deeper. I told her it wasn't necessary and she jokingly told me “It’s for my sake and not yours” while playfully waving a hand in front of her nose.

The next thing I knew, I was sitting in warm water, with my back turned to her as she scrubbed my shoulders. This wasn’t how I pictured our third date going. She gently washed my face, carefully avoiding my neck brace. When she finished with the hard-to-reach places, I excused her, insisting I could handle the rest. I wasn’t completely helpless, despite playing the role perfectly.

After I got dressed, the smell of eggs and toast filled the hallway as I stepped out into it. But beneath it lingered something else. A faint, moldy odor. Like something organic was slowly decomposing. I then realized that the ingredients had been in my fridge for more than two weeks. When I sat down at the table I hesitated, staring at the plate. But the smell was gone. Now, all I could smell was breakfast… fresh, warm, and delicious. The first real food I’d had in days.

The rest of the day blurred together. I remember us talking and me telling Moira stories about my life, my childhood, and memories I had to dig for. She seemed genuinely interested, but for me, it was more than just conversation. It was a test to prove to myself that I did remember things from my childhood. I told her about school. About the adventures Joshua and I had as teenagers. But now, sitting here the next morning, I can hardly recall what I told her. 

“So, you and Joshua seem to be getting along well.” 

“I wouldn't really say that, I think he blames me for what happened to you.”

“Don't take it personally, he’s always been protective over me.”

“Should I be jealous?” Moira said, trying to hold back a laugh.

 I chuckled, “No, not like that, he’s just the closest thing I have to a brother. This might be a surprise to hear, but growing up I didn't have a lot of friends. All I had was Joshua, sure he had a lot of other friends and I would hang around with them, but for the most part, I was invisible. The only time the other kids in school noticed me was when they were looking for a target to throw rocks at and call names. Weirdo, loser, orphan…”

I could be misremembering this part, but I swear in that moment the faintest memory surfaced, like a bubble through inky tar. A memory of being picked on for being an orphan. Was that really the only remnant of my parents I had left? Moira shifted uncomfortably in her seat, like a therapist taking notes. I knew she couldn't fix whatever was going on inside my head, but I took solace in knowing she was listening.

“That's awful, I’m sorry you remember going through that.” she said, her voice low and remorseful, like she had been the one casting stones. It almost sounded like she thought she was the reason for my rough childhood.

I reached out and laid my hand on hers, her cold fingers soaking up my warmth. “It's not all bad; that story has somewhat of a happy ending. Let's just say Joshua made sure those kids stopped picking on me. They were older, but he was bigger. He has always looked out for me like that. I don't know where I would be without him, but one thing is for sure; if it wasn't for him, I would have never met you.”

For a second, I could have sworn Moira’s cheeks flushed a pale shade of pink. As you may have noticed I’m not very good at picking up hints, but at that moment it felt so natural. I leaned in and kissed her. Her lips were cold and tentative at first, but after a second she leaned into me and the kiss deepened. It tasted sweet and made my lips tingle, in the same way a shot of her whisky did. It was blissful, numbing, intoxicating.

After almost getting lost in the moment, I remembered there was more I needed to tell her. I slowly pulled back. It felt like separating the moon from the earth, my body was the restless tide and she was the moon drawing me in. It was just like she said back at the waterfall, I’m the clay and she’s the artist. 

I told her why I went on the date, I told her how empty my life felt before I met her and why I jumped off the waterfall. Assuring her that what happened to me wasn’t her fault. She seemed relieved, like she needed to hear that from me. 

Later, Moira asked me about the house and my grandmother. I don't remember mentioning my grandmother to her, or maybe I did, my memories are slipping after all. Perhaps Joshua said something to Moira. I am struggling to remember my grandmother’s face; thankfully, I still have the picture to remember her by.

Moira spent the night… No, not like that, after all my grandmother raised me to be a gentleman. At least that's what I tell myself, but the truth is at that point I was way out of my depths, I had never even been on a third date much less had a woman spend the night. All I could do was try to make her comfortable, so I made up the bed in my grandmother’s old room for Moira to sleep in. Well, Moira did most of the work, my injury made it impossible to wrestle with a duvet cover. But it didn’t matter, because sometime during the night, I woke to the sensation of someone climbing into bed beside me. It was Moira.

We didn’t speak. We just lay there, facing each other, inches apart. I could feel her skin against mine, but it carried little warmth, unlike her eyes. I stared into those dark brown embers, drawn into their depths, lulled by their quiet glow. I hadn’t thought about the thing in my house since Moira arrived… until now. Until I lay there, staring at the faint glint in her gaze. Somewhere deep within those eyes, something shifted. Only for a second, something rippled beneath the surface… In that moment, though, I realized nothing else mattered. I had never felt so connected, never felt such peace. Any concerns I had were drowned out by the quiet warmth of sleep. I don't think I’ll do much more writing these next few days. I’d rather spend my time with Moira.

It's been a few days since Moira arrived, her bright and warm presence filling the cold, dark corners I once thought were out to get me. I’d tell you what we’ve been up to, but a gentleman doesn’t kiss and tell, even though it's too late for that. What I will tell you is that things have been so normal since she came over. However, my memories of the time before we met are growing more distant by the day. But I honestly, don't mind. Those memories are behind me and my life with Moira is all I look forward to. Although I can't help but wonder what my life was like back then, it feels odd reminiscing on memories you don't have. 

My only reminder is a picture I find every time I open the fold of my laptop. Every night I find myself staring holes through the faces in the picture. I remember solving the riddle of the house and the tire swing. But the three strangers beside me remain a mystery.

Over the last week, Moira has grown increasingly frail. I keep telling her to eat some of the delicious food she makes for me, but she refuses. I think she prefers eating alone at night because I always notice her missing from bed in the early mornings. This morning she didn't return to bed. I haven't seen her all day. Things have been going well, and whatever has been plaguing me seems to stay away when Moira’s here. So last night, I asked her to move in with me.

“I need to leave for a little while…” Moira‘s voice sounded distant even though she was right next to me.

A seed of unease planted itself in my chest. “Why don't you just stay? Move in here with me?” I asked, my voice hesitant.

Her eyes widened, she hadn’t expected me to ask this so soon.

Had I been too eager? Had her own words about leaving backfired on her?

For a moment, she stared at me, then her shocked expression softened into a warm smile.

“I would love that!” she said eagerly, like she had been waiting for me to ask.

Then, after a pause, her voice grew more solemn. “But… that doesn’t change the fact that I have to go away for a few days. There are still things I need to take care of…”

“You’re coming back, right?” My desperation cut through her sentence before she could finish.

Her serious expression cracked, giving way to a playful smile as she stifled a laugh. “Sooner than you think!” she said, tilting her head toward me with an assuring smile.

Now that I’m alone in the house again, I’m starting to think she can’t come back soon enough. I’ve convinced myself that I’m hearing things again… strange, unsettling sounds. And more convincingly, the dripping has returned. 

However, now there appears to be a source: a massive, round, moldy stain on the ceiling right in the middle of the dining room. I finally threw out the shriveled flowers and put the empty vase on the table, hoping to contain the mess. I don't know why, but I feel as if that table has some personal significance to me. More significant than Moira’s flowers.

I need something tangible and rational to explain away my paranoia. I have to go up there. I need to find the source of the dripping.
