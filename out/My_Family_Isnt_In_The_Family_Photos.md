What’s in the closet, Kirsty?

He knew I hid a secret.

I smiled, tried to look confused.

He waited, crossing his arms.

I worried that he'd already seen. He had. 

What else could he think about the pile?

His wife’s a cheater. She has another life. Another husband. Children.

He’d never believe the truth: I’m not a cheater; there’s no other life; no other man; I don’t know who the children are who visit me at night. 

But I did have a secret. And maybe it’s fair to say another life, even if was smaller and against my will.

I should have destroyed those frames, burned the photos within. Now it looked like I saved them, cherished them. The truth couldn’t be farther. I feared to touch anything to do with… whatever they are…with one exception.

“It started last Halloween,” I said to George, my husband, my real husband.

He stopped packing for a moment, working out the impossibility of this statement. “I’m taking the girls to my parents.” He resumed the tossing of shirts, pants, etc. into our big suitcase.

“It’s true,” I said, but weakly. The children in the picture are at least six and four respectively.  They were born six months ago. 

“They’re not… my kids,” I said of the boys in the photos. They’re not kids is what I almost said.

George stopped and squeezed the bridge of his nose between thumb and forefinger. “Kirsty,” he said slowly, “there are baby pictures. I saw them.”

“That’s-”

He quickly raised his finger, exasperated, angry, done.

“The first picture is you holding a newborn, and…”  He swallowed painfully, his throat gone dry. It always does when he’s upset. “And the father in that picture, with his arm around you, isn’t me.”

When I couldn't deny it, he nodded like he knew all along our marriage would end.

We were happy. We really were. George and I had managed to overcome the typical breakdown that often comes with raising children. Only since last Halloween had distance been made by me. 

I should have told him as soon as it started.

“Girls!” he called as I followed him down the stairs to the front hall of our lovely home. We’d scrimped and sacrificed to buy and keep this place, our dream by the lake. He’d been so proud. I couldn’t tell him I wanted to leave the first night sleeping there. 

Cara and Ella protested through play, ignoring the adults, continuing to jump on an old box they’d long since flattened. Rays from the western sun placed my daughters into an inspired, hallowed light, and I started to cry. He was going to take my babies away.

George opened the door, intending, I’m sure, to drop the suitcase in the car before returning to physically carry the girls out.

But he hesitated in the doorway.

“George?”

The suitcase fell with a solid thud on the floor. “There’s no way,” he said. 

“What?”

“There’s no way,” he said, with emphasis on the last word, “you would have had time for…this…” 

Not defining "this" as cheating was progress. “Yes!”

He glared, quieting my desperate enthusiasm. I wasn’t off the hook. “Tell me. The truth.”

“I can’t.”

He reached for the suitcase.

“No, not because I don’t want to,” I protested. “I don’t know what’s happening!”  I sat on the carpeted steps and stared through blurred vision at my trembling hands. The shriek I’d filled the house with - “happening!” - had put a halt to the box's obliteration. Cara and Ella hesitated for a few seconds before leaping into action.

Cara, the oldest, six, punched her dad in the buttocks. “You have to be nice!”

Ella, four, sat beside me and patted my trembling hands. “It’s okay, mummy.”

Such lovely daughters. Nothing like the boys in those photos when they were this age.

George grasped Cara's wrists and gently walked her back into the house, using his foot to kick the suitcase from the swing of the front door.

"It's alright, girls," he said with weak resolve. "Go and play."

"No!" Cara shouted. She kicked at her father and he pulled her close into a bearhug. Gradually, the girls calmed and were convinced to return to the box in the front room.

"Kirsty," George said, "you have to tell me." He sat down on the step beside me. "Please." I would do anything to take away the hurt in his eyes. "Please."

"I can't. But… I can write it down. Maybe." I took out my phone. We shared Google Drive. When I made a new document, he reluctantly started his phone. The man was a dream. He watched his screen, and waited patiently for my words to appear.

Without preamble, I returned to the awful moment when it all began: a strange and disturbing dream. Words came like an infection from beneath a torn scab. The wound had been opened. Nothing could stop this now.

Sex with another man has never been a desire of mine. I love George. He loves me. 

Plus, the man in my dream was a stranger, and not particularly handsome. He has a plain face set to unwavering boredom and unkempt male pattern baldness. Our dream sex felt obligatory, just something we had to do. 

I awoke on the wrong side of midnight. November 1st and I was craving ice cream instead of the girls' gathered candy. The freezer left by the previous homeowners came with unopened ice cream. Freezer burned or not, I wanted some.

After retrieving a spoon from the kitchen, I intended to destroy a brick of neopolitan. He waited in his flannel pajamas, barefoot on the concrete floor. His arms were crossed.

"Cravings?" he said.

I dropped the spoon. It clattered down the basement steps. Before I could run away, he disappeared like someone had erased him from head to foot in one clean sweep. 

Had to be a dream. That's what I told myself. The spoon stayed in the basement until daylight. Ghost or nightmare, there was laundry to do the next day.

I crossed the concrete floor fast and only felt safer when I'd closed the door to the more modern laundry room. Never thought builder's grade tiles and track lights would make me feel anything but sad. 

His voice caught me sorting. 

"Kirsty!"

I dropped the cup of detergent all over the floor.

"Shit."

I came out of the laundry room, figuring George had been looking for me in uncharacteristically rude fashion. He hated speaking between rooms. Shouting throughout the house was highly impolite. It must have been important, I figured.

As soon as I stepped onto the bare concrete, however, deep sadness, the kind that seems to physically leech the strength from your body, dominated the room. 

"Hello?"  I don't know why I said that. The basement is a low ceilinged rectangle. There are no hiding spots except for the laundry room I'd come from. After a deep breath, I walked briskly to the stairs.

"Any day now," a raspy voice breathed into my ear. I jolted and slipped forward, falling and clipping my chin off a step. It made my teeth click painfully. Nobody there, of course. I ran upstairs and George had gone outside with the girls to play hide and seek. 

I wanted to tell him. He looked so happy. It's hard to convey in words the kind of smile he showed me through the window. Imagine contentment mixed with unreserved joy and hope. Yes, it's difficult to picture. So few of us can ever have such a moment. Sort of like finding a natural view completely untouched by humanity. Beyond rare and precious. 

I’m rambling now to avoid writing about what followed. The point is I couldn’t tell him. I hoped it’d go away and stop. 

But, of course, it didn’t, and things got much worse.

I awoke in a great deal of pain. Having already given birth to children, the feeling was familiar. Despite getting up and gasping, George continued to snore in our bed. He’s a deep sleeper, but a quick and early riser. I’ve never heard him complain about getting out of bed either, especially when there’s an emergency.

I might have woken him up but I was disoriented and confused. Part of me believed I was still pregnant with Ella. It wasn’t until I’d gone all the way to the kitchen to avoid waking up the girls, that my brain caught up: Girls. Plural. Ella was asleep in her bed upstairs. 

“Ohhhhhhhh shiiiiiiiiiiit.” I knew the signs of labour. This couldn’t be happening. “Ohhhhhhhhh.”

I was definitely going to wake everyone up if this continued. 

My phone was upstairs by my bedside table. We don’t have a landline. I should have called 911. I should have woken up George. 

Instead, I went downstairs where I could vocalize pain without disturbing anyone. Such a pathetically passive response. But that’s how I was raised. Keep it down, don't you frown. 

His hands seized mine as soon as I descended the last step. Serious and bald without dignity is how to best describe his physical appearance. Cold and cruel is what he is. The lights turned off and, in the perfect darkness of the basement, he was all that I could see. 

He produces a red light from his body somehow but his touch is literally frosty. 

"Kristy, it's time," he said. No joy there. Just straight facts. Something was coming. I was going to give birth to it. In the dull red glow of his being, the first boy came.

"His name is Hadad," the man said, placing a large, infant boy with a lot of hair and, I swear, a hint of beard, on the bare concrete. Hadad looked like a three month old they use as newborns on TV. He didn't cry. He hardly seemed to breathe as his dark eyes roamed the darkness. His light resembled the man's, a less intense red.

I felt another contraction, and winced.

"She comes next," the man said.

I felt so weak. "Who are you?" I asked him.

At last, he smiled and I wished he hadn't. It made me feel small, insignificant, and beneath his concern. "You know who I am," he said. "I'm your husband."

Pain wracked my entire body. Something didn't feel right. The birth of Cara and Ella had been without difficulty.

"Push," my "husband" ordered. "She is upset with you, and will kill you if you don't get her out now."

"It has to be a nightmare," I told him. Sweat poured in streams down my face. The unborn "she" in question writhed and damaged my insides. I screamed. I couldn't help it.

"Push!" 

I obeyed and the second boy spilled onto the bare concrete, coated in blood and dust. 

"It's a boy," I said.

The man looked displeased. "The body is male. She is Hebat. No wonder she is angry." Like the other infant, Hebat appeared aware of her surroundings and had far too much motor control for a newborn. The light pouring from her body was dull silver. Her eye sockets were two pits of concentrated despair. I had to look away.

The babies were pressed into my arms. 

The man stretched out beside me. "Open your eyes and smile." I resisted. "Do it. Now." What choice did I have? The flash from his cell blinded me. They were all gone by the time my sight recovered. Only the sweat remained as evidence of the ordeal. 

It had to have been a hallucination. Some very bad food poisoning maybe. The source could be as simple as an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of underdone potato. I had been stress eating since we'd moved in. I stood up and took some comfort in a Charles Dickens' reference. 

"More of gravy than of grave about you," I said. My words seemed consumed by the dreadful weight of the air. "Whatever you are." 

Whatever you are: something bad in any case. At best, I'd hallucinated prolonged and traumatic labour and needed medical attention. Yet, when I limped up the basement stairs, all thoughts of waking George vanished. There on the kitchen island sat a propped frame containing the photograph taken only moments ago.

The man looked happy. Only Hadad appeared in this picture, which meant another one was somewhere. I didn't panic. I worried more about what George would think if he saw the photos. I had to find them all.

Hebat and his father and I were mounted in a dark wood frame by the master bedroom. It'd be the first thing anyone saw if they woke up. I plucked it off the wall and, together with the first photo, tucked it under some blankets in the dresser we'd shoved in the small walk-in closet. 

You might not believe this, but I went straight to sleep after. I climbed under the blanket in my sweaty pajamas, shut my eyes, and didn't have enough time to deny what had happened. I was unconscious until morning.

George placed a coffee on my nightstand. That's what I remember. He rubbed my feet while I slowly awoke. The girls were watching TV downstairs, munching on apple slices. There was forty minutes still before we had to seriously consider getting ready to take Cara to school. 

George would drop her off on his way to work downtown. He chose his hours and always chose convenience for his wife and kids. Ella and I planned to spend the morning gardening. Then we would nap much of the afternoon away until George and Cara returned. A life so perfect is so very rare. 

I didn't want to spoil things with a very convincing nightmare. Besides, I felt fine. Not so good that I wanted to look in the dresser to see if those photos really were there, but not ill. So I remained silent again.

November started fine. Idyllic days and nights filled with laughter and joy and television. Just as I started to believe in the dream we'd made, they came again.

The wail of a child's hunger is a powerful call for a parent. When it's a chorus, even of two, it cannot be ignored. Only I awoke to Hadad and Hebat's cries for their "mother" from the basement. 

Half asleep, I drifted into the kitchen and searched for their milk bottles. When no bottles could be found, I remembered they were newborns. Milk swelled in my breasts and made my nipples ache. Just like when Cara or Ella would awaken in the night. It was a relief to feed them.

But what the fuck was I doing?

I was acting like the man in the basement and the devil babies were mine. It'd been less than a week since Halloween and that horrible nightmare illusion. I had already taken on the beleaguered newborn mother role without question. 

Their cries intensified and flayed the weak resistance of exhausted reasoning. 

Don't wake George. Don't wake my babies, my real babies. 

"What took you so long?" the man critized, his voice monotone, the question unrhetorical.

"I… was sleeping. I went to the fridge first." Under his severe gaze, I stopped in the midst of the dark room. Hadad had quieted. Hebat cooed as if laughing at her own joke. I couldn't see them because the lights were off. They liked the dark better. Somehow I knew that about them and him.

"You should sleep down here," he said. "A mother should always be close to her babies."

The statement was nonsense but not altogether wrong. I wanted to be close to my babies, the daughters sleeping in bliss upstairs, away from the evil fermentation in the basement.

"Kirsty," he said. "Are you listening?"  His hand touched the small of my back. The gentleness surprised me. I squawked and flinched away. "What’s wrong with you? They're hungry." He pressed on my shoulders until I sat on the cold floor.

They came from the shadows, already walking. I wanted to go, but I knew he wouldn't allow it. He pulled my cat t-shirt off over my head and their fierce mouths suckled, relieving the pressure of excess breast milk quickly. It felt physically good and psychologically alien. 

I looked down at them once and immediately regretted it. Their emanated light had intensified to a point where perception of them hurt. 

Each time I blinked my eyes were drawn to some isolated part of their bodies. The vision got closer to the point of disgust. Everything is gross if you're close enough. There is no beauty under a microscope. If you think there is then you're not using the right magnification. 

Hebat's eye drew me in. At first, I saw the dark sphere, and then the strands of her eyelashes. Her gravity kept pulling until the creatures that live in eyelashes were revealed: Demodex folliculorum. I looked the microscopic horrors up. 

The babies had more parasites than any child should. They wanted to show me and could somehow do so.

I asked him about it. "Why are they showing me these worms?"

He smiled, contemptuously as usual. "Trying to impress mother. Neither of them understand your horror and insignificance. You are the ant who knows they're an ant. Lucky you. They think you will be proud of the life their corporeal forms produce and host. Give them a few hours. It will pass."

"Why are you doing this to me?"

"I'm not sure what you mean. We're married. Now, prepare to smile." His cell reappeared and I noted the lack of features; it might have been a singed rectangle of spent firewood. He frowned when I failed to smile. "Smile, Kirsty. These are your children."

I managed to stave off the tears and hold the babies close. The smile was more difficult. In the inevitable aftermath of their sudden disappearance, the frames depicted an exhausted, wrinkly woman smiling painfully. It took a second to recognize myself. 

The things in the basement sapped my strength. I looked dehydrated, beleaguered. The scale in the bathroom said I'd dropped six pounds. I'd weighed myself the morning before. 

"Whoa, you've lost weight," George noted, thinking I'd be pleased. "This place has been so good for us, eh?'

To produce another smile proved as draining as the previous night. "Y-yes," I stuttered too late for him to ignore.

"Hey," he said, touching my forearm.

I flinched. 

"Whoa, you okay? What's wrong?"

I should have told him. "Nothing. Bad sleep. A nightmare. I'll be fine."

A lie is an agreement. George wanted to agree, I think. He wanted life to be fine because he was happy for once. We struggled so hard before we came to Bridal Veil Lake. It was supposed to be our dream.

Guilty if I told him the truth. Guilty because I didn't. I began to resent his happiness, though he had done nothing but be the wonderful man he'd always been. 

To Cara and Ella I became a body in motion, No brain left to guide them away from harm or answer their questions about nature and the universe. 

"I don't know." That's what I told them often. 

So they began to treat me like a kind of butler.

"Can I have some juice, please?" 

"Sure, sweetheart."

"Mommy, can I have a snack?"

"Of course." And I'd run off to fetch it.

"Cookies."

"Yes, dear."

When Christmas came, I had two and they induced the same level of joy. Visiting the basement to feed and nurture Hebat and Hadad became a nightly occurrence. I'd learned to awaken, if I could get to sleep at all, and go quietly. 

He berated me severely if I missed a night, and there were subtle threats made casually.

"I may have to squash you yet," he said, his tone as deep and cold as always. 

"It won't happen again," I promised. "They’re getting big." In fact, they were no longer infants. Both had grown to the approximate age of six or seven in a few months. Still, they never spoke. Their dark eyes watched me as they ate food from the kitchen upstairs, food I'd hidden from my family.

"More meat," the man demanded.

"Of course." And I ran to the freezer and gave them frozen sausages in the package. They never complained or demanded the food be prepared a different way. No objections from my "husband" either. 

Hebat tore the styrofoam and plastic wrap away and flattened the row of sausages stuck together between powerful molars. Hadad contented itself with licking them like a popsicle. 

I'd stay until the photo. Then they'd release me by vanishing. Always with an exhausted breath, I'd trudge up the stairs and search for the frames and hide them in the same place.

They only smiled in the pictures. At no other time did they express any kind of emotion unless indifference counts.

My own children and husband weren't doing much better. Their concerns about my fatigue and ruminating slowly ceased as I repeated the excuse: I’m just tired. It'll pass. 

Of course, I did not know when the nightmare would stop. 

"When will it end?" I asked him one night, while Hebat and Hadad exercised like they had a mission. 

"What do you mean?" he said.

I was surprised he answered. He usually didn't. "This. This. When can I go back to normal and not come down every night? I'm so very tired."

He frowned and I thought some punishment must be coming. Instead, he looked more confused. "I don't understand. You aren't happy? Your children grow into power and strength and will take their place in the world. They will be great and you - you, of all the tiny things, made that happen. Ask yourself what you want out of life, and see if Hebat and Haddad aren't your answer."

Too many words, all at once, for an exhausted mother. I didn't speak for the rest of the night. The infernal trio vanished, and the latter moments of the ritual I carried out with his challenge in mind.

I want my children to be strong, happy, and safe.

"Juice," Cara demanded the next morning, a Saturday, while she watched cartoons. 

"Get it yourself!" I hissed, from tired to angry in a second. 

"But I can't," Cara accurately pointed out. She didn't look away from the TV. Looking at me wasn't safe, and she knew it. Her and Ella held hands and sat a little straighter. It broke my heart. What had I done?

George came downstairs, attracted by my shouting. "What’s going on?"

Empathy became sadness, and the constant burden rekindled to anger swiftly. "Just children treating me like a servant."

He smiled. "Ah, yes, and how are the royal princesses this morning?" 

His levity irked me. "You would know if you didn't sleep in so much."

The smile vanished from his face, and instead of the fight I seemed to want, he mumbled a quiet apology and joined the girls. They climbed onto him as he wrapped them into a cuddle. 

"What are we watching?" George restarted his smile, his calm, for the girls. I hated myself. It had to end. Tonight. 

After another dreary day of going through the motions, and the girls and George had fallen asleep, I went to the kitchen and chose the knife I thought sharpest. 

"Kirsty," he said, his voice a whisper rising from the depths of the house.

"Coming," I whispered back. 

"Mom," said another voice, a girl's, and I knew that Hebat had, at last, found herself and the wholeness of her being had been corrected.

I started to cry. I went downstairs and there she was with her brother and her father. He looked tired but some of the grimness had cracked to allow the first real contentment I've ever seen him express.

"Is that for the cake?" he asked. "We already have one."

I remembered the sharp knife. "Meat," I said. "There’s ham in the freezer." 

He nodded, seeming to accept the answer. 

"Mom," Hebat said, "Do you think I'm…"  She gestured to herself, her face, and her body, and I understood the question, born from doubt and a desire to be validated.

I pulled her close. "You are the most beautiful girl in the whole world." We cried together. Hadad cut into a poorly made, asymmetrical cake by the light of his aura. No one cared that he did so on the floor. I brought out the ham from the fridge and we ate slices with our hands.

"It's almost done," he said. "They’re nearly grown. They are strong, and they are happy. You've done a good job, Kirsty." He watched our children fight to smear icing on each other's faces. "I'm sorry if I was mean. Or cold. I've never done this before." And he meant raising children. "It was the hardest, scariest thing anyone can try. I shouldn't have blamed you for… Hebat… It wasn't your fault."

Before I could pat his hand, he and the kids vanished. Darkness so familiar couldn't extinguish a new fear. I went upstairs and found the last frame. I held my daughter in the photo, my beautiful Hebat. He must have taken the photo without my notice. 

I took it upstairs but couldn't bring myself to hide it.

I didn't see that one, George wrote into the document.

I forgot he was watching.

He typed again: Are you saying there is something in the basement? 

Yes, I replied.

He stirred in the living room. I hadn't moved from the stairs, but I could tell by his stomping how angry he'd become. All of his negative, violent traits he saved for those in the world who would harm his family. George the Protector was fearsome to behold.

But he had no chance against my other husband. 

"Come out! Come out you coward!" George bellowed. At first, nothing happened. The moment before calamity, even when the specific consequences aren't known, is still in slow motion. He carried on shouting. The girls rushed into the hall and didn’t hesitate to investigate. 

"No!" I shouted. "Cara! Ella!"

Their feet padded down the steps. A violent commotion followed, screams and raging voices, both deep and childishly shrill. 

The most unsettling quiet followed.

I chewed through the fear and the horror tearing me apart and finally moved.

No evidence of violence could be seen from the top of the stairs. The concrete looked bare and dusty and the light revealed nothing more. They were gone, all of them. 

"Hebat," I whispered. "Cara? George?"

Him, I thought of, the nameless husband and felt no hint of his presence. He'd always been there. I know that now. It had nothing to do with the house. His absence was felt more than his insidious presence. Yet, I felt no relief. George and the girls were gone. I sat on the floor and cried for all my missing children.

When I finally emerged from the basement, the whole house had been filled with night. Their photos were everywhere. The others were upstairs. I gathered them on the kitchen island. How could I explain any of this to the police? 

I needed help. I called my parents. It took twenty minutes before my father picked up.  

"Kirsty? What's wrong?"

"Dad," I whimpered. "George is gone. Cara. Ella."

"What? What did you say?"

"They’re gone, dad. George. The girls are gone."

I heard his bed springs protest as he rolled out of bed. My mom said something I couldn't hear, and he shushed her.

"Kirsty," he said, "are you alright? Are you hurt? Are you in danger?"

Why was it so hard to understand? "Dad. George is gone."

"Kirsty, who the hell is George?"

It was my turn to be confused. "He's my- you know him. My husband…"

"Kirsty," he said very slowly, "are you on drugs? Did you take something?"

"No. Are you?" 

"Excuse me?"

I hung up.

I have their photos. I have all of their photos. That's what I brought to George's parents before the sun rose. They wouldn't open the door and spoke to me through an intercom.

"George is gone," I said.

"We'll call the police."

"This is your son. These are your granddaughters."

I heard my mother-in-law say, "Who is she?"

"We don't have a son," my father-in-law said. "Go away."

I left. 

Back to the house. Our dream sat empty and I live there, but none of the people in my family photos are my family. 

I remember but the world never does. My parents think I'm ill and that I used AI to create the family I apparently never had.

How did I buy the house without a job or income? With deep concern for my mental health, they showed me a news story. I had won the lottery the day I turned eighteen. 

His influence there, payment for services rendered. 

A lie is an agreement. 

What had I agreed to? I'm afraid I know the answer: I never wanted a family.

God help me. God help them.

I don't know what to do with these [pictures](https://www.reddit.com/u/APCleriot/s/AHZnalEWcl).
