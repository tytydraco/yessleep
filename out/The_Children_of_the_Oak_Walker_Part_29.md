*Boom.*  
Another rocket exploded somewhere outside, but the morose group in Sean’s office didn’t even flinch, the lights flickering to cast eerie shadows off the blackout curtains made from trash bags taped over the windows. The acrid scent of gun smoke hung heavy on their clothes, along with soot from smoke from multiple fires within the perimeter. Crimson blood stained the clothing on every person, especially Sandra’s white lab coat, and she sat on my left with hollow eyes, her shoulders slumped in dejection. In a way, I felt bad for her. It wasn’t her fault that the Researcher faction had been led by a tyrant in disguise, yet now they would bear the brunt of local scrutiny in the same way the militia men of the Rangers had been vilified after Carter’s regime was ousted.  
*Years of hard work, bravery, sacrifice, all wiped away by one bad person who happened to wear the same cloth. Are we really so childish that this has to continue? Is this really how the world works now, through tribal, petty squabbles?*  
“So, as far as we’re aware, O’Brian acted alone?” Sean leaned against his desk, muscled arms folded, his still-warm Armalite leaned against a wooden coat rack in the corner. The letter from Andrea lay on the desktop where he’d opened it, and while I hadn’t dared to try and glimpse any of the words myself, I could tell it had rocked the ex-policeman to his core. Sean’s usual stoic face had crumpled when he read the note in silence from behind his desk, and I honestly felt bad for giving it to him. Though I didn’t know him or Andrea very well, something told me there was chemistry between the two of them, and I’d never seen Sean look so glum in all my time here.  
I looked down at my bandaged fingers, each throbbing under the thin cotton dressing like miniature tom-toms, and nodded. “She manipulated Jamie to get to me, but the beacon was the real prize. ELSAR will have had it for a while now, and I’m not sure when they plan to activate the system. The resistance in Black Oak detected an inbound shipment of tanks, so they seem to still plan on pushing us out, though I can’t understand why.”  
On my right, Ethan tightened a coil of gauze around a shrapnel wound in his forearm and shook his head with a bleak sigh. “Our trucks can’t outmatch main battle tanks. Once they get that shipment in, we’re screwed. Maybe it’s time we tried punching through the border again?”  
“My scouts found concrete bunkers and artillery emplacements all along the western and eastern border.” Adam winced as Eve pressed a fresh linen dressing to a gash in his forehead, their armor dented and grimy after many attempts to rescue trapped civilians from the burning buildings. “Not to mention their air power is stronger there. If we so much as try to walk through, they’ll cut us down in droves.”  
“Which leaves us no choice.” Sean frowned at the floor between his boots. “We can’t stay here; if O’Brian could call in an artillery strike just to cover her theft of the beacon, then once ELSAR figures out their spy is dead, they won’t hesitate to raze us to the ground. We have to evacuate New Wilderness and make a hard push on Black Oak to force them into negotiations before their main battle tanks arrive.”  
I glanced at the empty chair by the door and felt my guts twist. Since the siege was still ongoing, one of the officials had to stay at the walls to lead the men, and I’d suggested that Chris be left out on the grounds that the head ranger should be leading the military efforts. Few others knew of my return, thanks to the chaos of the battle, so it was a perfect excuse to prolong the inevitable reunion. In truth, I couldn’t find it within myself to work up the courage to face him. For so long I’d suspected Chris, lied to him, kept secrets from him that put everyone in danger. I’d seen him kiss my best friend, had been stolen away from him for almost two weeks in the clutches of the enemy, only to return as a mutated version of the girl I was before. I didn’t know what I would say to him, or him to me, or if Chris would even want me anymore. After all, thanks to Vecitorak’s blade I had more in common with the golden-haired people from Ark River than the handsome charter pilot. While that wound had been healed by ELSAR’s advanced technology, the ragged hole in my heart left from the sight of Jamie’s lips on his had yet to fully mend, and the complex world of New Wilderness politics wouldn’t stop for us either.  
*What if he pushes for his peace idea in the Assembly, and I have to vote against it? I can’t support that now, not with what I’ve seen of the Organs, but I’m the one person he trusted with the idea, and I told him it was a good one. Of course, that was before he made out with my best friend . . . but still.*  
“From what Hannah said, the city sounds like a fortress.” Eve straightened up from tending to her husband and flicked her luminous gaze to me. “We’d be fighting on their territory, which would put us at a disadvantage. Besides, there’s the issue of Vecitorak to consider; whether we win or lose, he’s still out there.”  
“And growing stronger, no doubt.” Adam rested his elbows on his knees and laced his fingers together in a contemplative stare. “The pirate claims he shot Vecitorak in the chest; even if the man had armor, to take a large-caliber musket ball to the sternum and not so much as stumble means we’re dealing with something darker than ELSAR. If it is true that he’s found a way to turn humans into Puppets, then we might be looking at some kind of demonic influence.”  
Sandra raised her hand in objection, though her tone was more polite toward the religious implications than O’Brian’s would have been. “I’m not saying that isn’t true, but we shouldn’t rule out a scientific explanation either. Mutations of people are rare, but as we’ve all seen, they are possible. Perhaps we’re dealing with a different kind of Breach-made person?”  
All eyes shifted to me, and I sighed. Being the ‘scientific’ example of something bizarre wasn’t fun, and even with Eve in the room, I felt as out of place as a polar bear in Hawaii.  
*Wonder how long before the rumor mill here starts churning out stuff about me being in league with a demon army or something.*  
“Whatever he is, we have to take his warning seriously.” I sat back in my chair, and winced as a few vertebrae popped, my body sore from the abuse it had taken in my rough-and-tumble endeavors thus far. “Once we recover my group hiding at Eldar Crossing, we should move everyone to Ark River, to keep them out of ELSAR’s artillery range. I don’t think Vecitorak has enough Puppets to overcome the defenses there, and if we combine force with Adam’s people, we might have enough to make an assault on Black Oak.”  
“*Might*.” Ethan picked at a tear in his denim overhauls. “But that relies on being able to get rid of these water-rats dug in outside our gates. Peter claims they’re looking for a little girl, but if it’s true they were also here for the doctor, they might not be happy to know that their prize is dead as a hammer.”  
I angled my elbow toward the office door, signaling the direction of the prisoners. “Have you tried negotiating with them?”  
“Several times.” Adam tugged a small comb from a pocket beneath his armor, and gently began to tease of some of the tangles in Eve’s golden locks, with a loving touch that made the loneliness in my guts ache even worse. “They won’t listen to any of us.”  
“And what about the First Mate?” I forced the images of Chris from my head, hating myself for how weak I could be when it came to the man who had broken my trust.  
“He refused to help after Jamie turned you over to ELSAR.” Sean scratched the back of his dark-haired head, and paused to brush some dust from his desktop as another explosion shook the lodge. “I guess the pirates saw your disappearance as evidence of some kind of secret execution, and thought we’d go back on our word not to do the same to them. They’ve been shut up in their cells for days on a hunger strike, demanding lighter sentencing in return for cooperation.”  
*So, Peter is still alive. Good. That’s at least one pirate I can trust.*  
Pushing myself to my feet, I took a deep breath, still somewhat uncomfortable in the presence of Sean and the others, given their power in this place. “I think I might have an idea.”  
The walk to the mechanical garage was a long one, not so much in time, but in the tension I felt at being in the open. Every rocket that soared in from the sky seemed to be directed right at us, the bullets snapping back and forth, fires and bodies a common theme throughout the beleaguered fortress. Teams of medics scuttled around to try and gather wounded, but they didn’t have time for the dead, who were merely left where they lay in macabre contortions of death. Yet, despite all these things, my chief concern lay with not being spotted by a certain blue-eyed boy, the thought of running into him now more frightening than a rocket-propelled grenade. I knew it was horribly selfish and backward to think of such things in a time like this, but the feeling persisted in my mind, especially in light of the memories I had from the last time I’d seen him. I didn’t have the mental strength to deal with the kind of heartbreak those memories conjured, not now. I needed time, space, enough to plan out what to say when I came face to face with Chris at last.  
*That’s if he even wants to speak with me. At this rate, I’m closer to a mutant than he is. Maybe he won’t want to be with me at all?*  
Inside the garage, younger teens and even children served as ammunition runners, lugging green steel boxes of reloaded cartridges to the ramparts. Some were small enough that they could only carry one box at a time, and it hurt seeing the paper-white fear on their little faces. Our old world had been blasted away, and in this new, cruel one, children were children only so long as bullets weren’t flying.  
A cordoned-off area in the back of the shop caught my eye, and I followed Sean and the others through the former firing range door, and into the quiet, enclosed area beyond.  
Hastily constructed where the shooting tracks had been, a large, stamped mesh cage covered the entire back corner of the building. A few buckets sat in one corner for sanitary uses, and sullen figures huddled against the far wall, dressed in the mixed attire of seventeenth century brigands and modern American youth. They looked tired and pale, though much cleaner than when they’d first stumbled through our gates, and at our approach they all stood up together.  
Sean folded his arms and jerked his head toward them. “They’re all yours.”  
I stepped closer to the interwoven bars and peered into the crowd of bewildered faces. “Peter?”  
Murmurs of surprise spread through the handful of kids, and they parted to allow a single person to move to the forefront. He bore shadowy bags under his eyes, the dark hair atop his head oily from lack of bathing. Without his repertoire of blades and firearms, Peter looked so much more like a fifteen-year-old boy than a pirate, and he narrowed his eyes at me, while the rest of the officials hung back from the cage to give us a small manner of privacy.  
“Brun?” Peter wrapped his fingers over the iron webbing of the cage walls, a shocked look of disbelief coming to his thin face. “My God, it’s really you. I thought you were dead.”  
I took a few packets of crackers from my pocket, items I’d requested on the way from Sean’s office, and poked them through a hinged slot made for such tasks, along with a plastic jug of apple juice from the kitchen. “Long story. Here. I know you guys are kind of holding out on food, but I brought this as a ‘thank you’ for earlier, so it doesn’t count against you.”  
At his permissive nod, the others snatched the packets, and Peter stayed where he was while the several crewmembers gulped them down with ravenous appetites. It struck me that we’d met this way, only I’d been the prisoner, and Peter the merciful guard, our roles now reversed thanks to the odd machinations of fate. He’d been key to my survival aboard the *Harper’s Vengeance*, and I hoped that somehow, I could pay back that service with kindness of my own, however it would all depend on Peter’s willingness to cooperate.  
Eyeing the silver lines on my face, Peter waited until the others had a chance to eat, before he scarfed down a few of the powder saltines himself. “Thought the blonde one shot you like a dog. Figured she would have, out of pity at least. Still didn’t sit right with us, being condemned for murder and all, while something like that went unpunished.”  
“Yeah.” I shuffled my feet in place on the cold cement floor. “Well, they’ve got her locked up in the field clinic at the lodge. Jamie committed what we consider treason, so . . . I don’t think she’ll get away with it.”  
His murky eyes locked on mine. “They’ll hang her?”  
*I never thought about that. With how much ammo we’re burning trough out there, I doubt anyone would want to waste bullets on her if they held a public trial. God on high, would they make me watch?*  
I swallowed hard, and fought the sudden urge to cry at the mental image of Jamie’s twisted neck at the end of a rope. “Probably.”  
Peter’s face slid into a wince of grim resignation. “Not that it’s any consolation, but at least she won’t be alone up there in the breeze. We’ll make a lovely pair of bookends. Or rather, windchimes.”  
I knew he’d meant it as a vain attempt at rather dark humor, but Peter’s weary eyes held no laughter. If one of our own would be condemned, then he stood no chance. True, Peter had already agreed to such an end in exchange for the life of his crew, but my temporary absence had invigorated them with hope for a different outcome. No one wanted to go to the hangman’s noose, least of all a fifteen-year-old kid who had tasted extreme freedom on the waves of Maple Lake, but murder, torture, and other heinous crimes could not be undone. In that way my return, and Jamie’s subsequent punishment, meant his definite execution.  
Glancing back at Sean, who granted me a nod of consent, I edged a little closer to the bars.  
“If there was a way out,” I caught and held his gaze, my own hands pressed to the cold cage walls. “A way for you to earn a life sentence instead of hanging, would you take it?”  
He glared at me, and Peter’s mouth tightened into a bitter sneer. “Don’t toy with me, lass. If they’ll hang one of their own, why would they spare a pirate? Ther’s no forgiveness for what we’ve done.”  
“You saved my life.” I pleaded through the steel mesh and rattled the bars to keep his attention. “Look at me, Peter. Do you think I’d lie about this?”  
He hesitated, and the stony disbelief fell into a sad, yet somewhat hopeful look as Peter cleared his throat. “All right. I’ll bite. What do the big-shots want?”  
“We have to get out of New Wilderness.” I waved a hand to the garage around us, as the lights blinked from a nearby shell impact, loosening another thin cloud of dust from the rafters. “There’s a very high chance ELSAR will bomb this place into powder within a few hours, enough to wipe the entire fort off the map. If you can get Grapeshot to back down so we can evacuate, I’ll get your death sentence revoked.”  
One oil-brown eyebrow rose, and Peter let out a cynical whistle. “Might as well ask me to make money rain from the sky.”  
“There has to be a way.” I folded my arms, unwilling to back down from this, needing to save at least one person to quiet the muted accusations of Dr. O’Brian that still rolled around in my brain. “Some way to convince them to let us pass.”  
“You’ll have to kill them all.” Peter hung his head in defeat. “They’re either too scared, too angry, or too desperate to leave now. Sam won’t listen to anyone.”  
“He’ll listen to you.” I lowered my voice to keep the others from listening in. “He did before. You know as well as I do that Tarren is still out there, maybe with Vecitorak, and if we can track him down—”  
Peter laughed, a dry, hopeless chuckle. “If that’s true, then Grapeshot will just light the whole forest on fire for spite. You don’t know him, Hannah. He’s not who he used to be.”  
“If we don’t do something, the bombs won’t just fall on us.” I pointed to the wall where the *booms* echoed outside. “They’ll drop them on the pirate trenches and kill every single one of them. ELSAR doesn’t care about any of us, which means if you want those kids to see the sunrise, then we need you, Peter.”  
The other children in the cage watched him, loyal in their silence, while Peter stared down at his shoes. I had no doubt they would follow him anywhere, even to death, if he said ‘no’. All our lives lay in the hands of a pirate, who we’d sentenced to death, and who’s companions fought just outside the walls to bring us down.  
Peter looked behind him, at the eyes of the others, and pushed both shoulders back. “There might be a way . . . but you’ll have to trust me.”  
*At this point, I’d give you the keys to the missile silo if I thought it would help.*  
A hopeful smile pulled itself over my face, and I stuck my hand through the hinged slot. “You’ve got yourself a deal, mate.”
