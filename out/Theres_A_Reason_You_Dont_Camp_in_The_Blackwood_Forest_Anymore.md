This isn't just a story; it's a memory, a stain on time from a place I sometimes wish to forget.

It started like any other late August trip into the Blackwood National Forest. My sister Chloe and our friends, Liam and Maya. We were experienced hikers, not thrill-seekers, just looking for that perfect spot, miles from cell service, where the stars truly drowned out the artificial light of civilization. Our target was the Whispering Falls, a legend of a place where the wind supposedly carried ancient voices through the rock formations. A bit cheesy, maybe, but we were young and romantic enough to buy into it.

The first two days were idyllic. Sun-dappled paths, the scent of pine and damp earth, the rhythmic crunch of boots on fallen leaves. We'd found a clearing near a small, gurgling stream, far off the main trails, and set up our tents. It was perfect. We cooked over a small fire, swapped stories, and watched the meteor showers paint streaks across the inky sky. Liam, ever the pragmatic one, even commented, "See? No ancient spirits, just crickets and bad jokes." We laughed, agreeing. The woods felt peaceful, ancient, but benign.

Then came the third night.

The change was subtle at first. A shift in the air, a drop in temperature that felt unnatural, even for late summer. The crickets, which had been a constant chorus, slowly fell silent, one by one, until the quiet pressed in on us like a physical weight. Even the wind, usually a gentle sigh through the canopy, seemed to hold its breath.

Chloe was the first to notice something truly amiss. "Did you guys hear that?" she whispered, peering out of the tent flap into the moonless night. "Like... a dragging sound? And then a thump?"

We listened. Nothing. Liam, already half-asleep, mumbled, "Just an animal, Chlo. Probably a deer."

But then it came again. \*Scraaaape... thud.\* Not far, maybe a hundred yards or so, deeper in the treeline. It sounded heavy, deliberate, and undeniably... repetitive. Too rhythmic for a deer. Too slow for anything running.

We unzipped our tents, huddling together around the dying embers of our fire. Maya clutched Liam’s arm. "That's not normal," she breathed. "It sounds like... someone dragging something huge."

"Or something dragging \*itself\*," I muttered, trying to sound brave, but my voice wavered.

Then the whispering started. Not the gentle soughing of the wind, or the distant murmur of the falls we'd yet to reach. This was different. Close. It was a dry, rasping sound, like dead leaves skittering across stone, but carrying the distinct cadence of speech. Yet, no words formed. Just sibilant, overlapping whispers, rising and falling in an unnerving chorus. It was everywhere and nowhere, seeming to come from the very air around us.

Liam, usually the brave one, swallowed hard. He pulled out his high-powered tactical flashlight, its beam a stark, cold spear against the overwhelming darkness. "I'm just gonna check it out," he said, trying for casual, but his hand trembled.

"No!" Chloe grabbed his arm. "Don't. Don't go out there."

But Liam, ever the protector, shook her off gently. "We need to know what it is. It's probably just a branch, or a gust of wind playing tricks." He aimed the beam towards where the scraping had seemed loudest.

The light cut through the oppressive blackness, illuminating a wall of ancient trees, their trunks thick and gnarled. For a moment, there was nothing. Just the flickering shadows, and the relentless, meaningless whispering that now seemed to intensify, to coil around us.

Then, he saw them. We all did. Low to the ground, reflecting Liam’s powerful beam with an unholy, cold intensity: a pair of eyes. Not animal eyes. Too large, too steady, too... knowing. They were a deep, burning amber, set in something dark and indistinct. They didn't blink. They simply stared back, unwavering, from a height that suggested whatever they belonged to was either crouched or impossibly small, yet the presence felt immense.

A collective gasp escaped us. The scraping sound started up again, closer now, accompanied by a new sound: a slow, guttural \*gurgle\*, almost like liquid moving through a constricted throat, but deeper, echoing the cadence of the whispers. The eyes, unblinking, began to move, slowly, deliberately, as if whatever they belonged to was shifting its weight, preparing.

Panic seized us. We scrambled back into our tents, fumbling with zippers, trying to create even a flimsy barrier against the palpable dread. But the sounds followed. The scraping seemed to be circling our camp, closer and closer, each \*thud\* vibrating through the very ground. The whispers were no longer just sibilant; they seemed to be forming into a mocking, insidious chorus, still without discernible words, but filled with malevolence.

Liam was shaking, his flashlight beam dancing wildly through the trees, illuminating grotesque root systems and hanging moss that suddenly looked like skeletal fingers. "What \*is\* that?" he choked out.

"We have to go," Maya whimpered, already trying to pack her sleeping bag with trembling hands. "Now!"

We tore down our tents in a frantic, desperate blur, abandoning anything that wasn't essential. Backpacks haphazardly thrown on, laces untied, hearts pounding like war drums against our ribs. The fire, thankfully, was almost out. We didn't dare stop to douse it properly.

As we stumbled away from the clearing, running blindly into the deeper woods, the whispers became a howling gale in our ears, and the scraping turned into a frenzied tearing sound. We risked a glance back.

That's when we saw it.

The clearing, moments ago a refuge, was now a scene of impossible terror. The massive oak tree that had stood sentinel at the edge of our camp, its roots anchoring it for centuries, was no longer rooted. Its ancient, gnarled trunk was swaying, its immense roots, thick as human bodies, were wrenching themselves free from the earth with sickening \*cracks\* and groans. Soil, rocks, and smaller plants exploded upwards as it heaved itself free. The sound was like a thousand bones breaking, mingled with a high-pitched, almost joyful \*shriek\* that somehow merged with the deeper guttural sound we’d heard earlier.

And then, with a final, earth-shattering \*CRACK\*, the tree stood free. Not fallen, but \*standing\*. It began to move, slowly at first, its massive roots acting like monstrous, splayed legs. The canopy, dense with leaves, thrashed wildly, like a frantic, enraged head. And from its rough, ancient bark, around where those amber eyes had been, came that guttural sound again, deeper now, clearer, unmistakably \*laughter\*. A dry, woody cackle that echoed through the terrified silence of the forest, filled with ancient malice and glee.

The tree was walking. It was coming for us.

We ran then, truly ran, not just from something unseen, but from the impossible, from the very earth turned against us. The whispers followed, no longer vague, but sharp, distinct, like branches whipping past our ears. The thudding of roots on the ground vibrated through our feet. We didn't look back again, not until we burst out of the treeline and onto the main road hours later, battered, scratched, and utterly broken.

To this day, none of us can explain it. We told our story, of course, but it was met with polite skepticism, or worried glances at our wild eyes. The park rangers found our abandoned campsite, noted the strange, churned earth where a giant oak should have stood, but attributed it to a localized sinkhole or some geological anomaly. They never saw the laughter. They never felt the roots shake the ground.

So, yeah. If you hear anything tonight... any scraping, any whispering... maybe, just maybe, don't look. And for god's sake, if you see a tree moving, just run.
