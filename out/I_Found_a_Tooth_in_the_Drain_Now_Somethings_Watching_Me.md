It started with a drip.

Just a soft, rhythmic tap behind the sink in the upstairs bathroom. I ignored it for a few weeks—assumed it was condensation or loose plumbing. The kind of thing you tell yourself you’ll get around to fixing but never do.

Then one morning, the drip stopped.

Instead, there was a *clink.*

A single sharp *ping* from inside the pipe. I figured something had come loose. Maybe a coin, a bit of tile, a piece of old rust.

When I unscrewed the U-bend under the sink, water spilled out—stale, grayish. And in the middle of it was a **tooth**.

It was yellowed, cracked, and slightly crooked. A molar. No fillings, but old. Worn down. The root was still attached.

I stared at it for too long.

I live alone. No one else has used that bathroom in months. No guests. No contractors. I even called my dentist the next day just to be sure—no missing teeth, no hidden damage. Definitely not mine.

I kept the tooth in a Ziploc bag. I told myself I was going to throw it out, but I didn’t.

The next night, I woke up at 2:40 a.m. to the sound of dripping again. Except it wasn’t the sink. It was heavier. Slower. Coming from the backyard.

I looked out the window and saw nothing. No movement. No breeze. But the sound kept going—like water hitting soil. A slow, thick *drip… drip… drip.*

In the morning, I checked outside.

There was a hole in the garden bed. Small, about the size of a mixing bowl. Freshly dug. Right under the bathroom window. The soil around it was damp. Like something had been buried… then pulled back out.

That’s when I noticed something else.

My neighbour—Rob—had been acting strange for weeks. Nice guy, mid-40s, worked in plumbing. We’d chatted maybe three times total. But since the tooth, he started watching me.

Not staring. Just… always out front. Sweeping. Fixing his car. “Happening” to be there when I checked my mail or took out the bins. Once, I caught him looking directly at my house from his bedroom window. When I waved, he froze, then closed the curtain.

Three days later, I found **another tooth.** This time in the kitchen sink.

Smaller. Incisor. Clean, but clearly old.

Now I was scared.

I called the police—not to report a crime, just to ask. I explained, awkwardly, that human teeth were showing up in my drains. The officer was polite but unconvinced. “Could be anything. Old plumbing pulls weird stuff sometimes. Mice, even. You’d be surprised.”

I wasn’t. But I didn’t argue. I just logged the call.

That night, I didn’t sleep.

At 3:12 a.m., I heard it again. The clink. Then another. Faster.

I turned the bathroom light on. The sink was dry. But when I opened the cabinet beneath, a trickle of water ran from the pipe—and pooled around **five teeth**, all different. One was tiny. One had a metal pin in it.

I bagged them and went next door.

Rob answered like he was expecting me.

“Everything alright, mate?” he asked, drying his hands with a towel that had brownish stains.

I tried to be calm. “You haven’t had any… plumbing issues, have you?”

He smiled. “Only upstream from yours.”

I asked what he meant, but he just gave a weird little wink and said, “It’s all connected, isn’t it? Pipes. People. Nerves. Doesn’t take much to cross over.”

I left.

I installed a motion-activated camera in the backyard that afternoon. I pointed it right at the garden bed under the window.

I didn’t check the footage until two days later.

There were 43 clips from the night before. Each was 10 to 12 seconds long. They all showed Rob—standing in my backyard, completely still. Not digging. Not moving. Just staring up at my window. His hands at his sides. Sometimes, he tilted his head. Sometimes, he smiled.

Not once did he walk in or out of frame.

He just appeared.

And then, at 3:16 a.m., one clip showed him raising his hand and dropping something gently into the soil. The same hole as before.

I ran outside. Dug up the spot with a trowel.

I found a **tongue.** Dried, leathery, with the tip missing.

I called the police again. This time, they came.

They knocked on Rob’s door.

No answer.

They went inside.

Nothing. Empty house. No furniture. No clothes. Just a mattress on the floor and a single notebook. The fridge was full of teeth. Bags of them. Neatly labelled. Some dated back to the 1980s. None matched Rob’s dental records—because Rob wasn’t Rob. The actual Rob disappeared nine months ago. His mail kept coming. His lawn kept getting mowed.

I haven’t slept properly in weeks.

The police don’t know who the man was. The video clips disappeared off my drive before I could back them up. And yesterday, I found **a molar in my shower drain.** Not mine. Not old.

Still bloody.

There was a note taped to my door this morning.

Written in black marker. All caps:

**"SINKS DRAIN. PEOPLE DON’T."**

If something happens to me, remember this:

**Check your pipes.**

You never know who they’re connected to.
