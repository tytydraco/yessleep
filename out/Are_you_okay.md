As the days of my life draw to a close, I feel the need to explain the events that brought me here. I’ve told this story hundreds of times since it happened, and no one believes me. I wouldn’t believe it either, if I’m being honest. And that’s why I feel it needs to be told.

Be prepared—this may sound like the ramblings of a madman.

I’m writing this as a warning to anyone who likes to experiment with substances. If you take anything from my story, let it be this:

Don’t do weird drugs.

My friends and I liked drugs. Not the hard stuff. We’d smoke weed, take mushrooms, drop acid. I got really into it. We were like modern-day hippies. Long hair, comfortable clothes, no real plans.

We always had fun. I never felt like I was in danger. I had issues, sure, but I dealt with them in my own way.

It was always me, Brian, and Rodger. We’d known each other since school. None of us had done much with our lives. We worked just enough to get by, lived for the weekend, and found comfort in our little bubble.

One night, I drove over to Brian’s for our usual weekend routine. Parked, grabbed my bag, walked in. Brian had a nice setup: big TV, tons of video games, surround sound speakers that made every movie feel real.

I let myself in. Brian was already on the couch, watching TV.

“Hey man,” he said. “Drive go alright?”

“Yeah, man. I'm ready to party.”

“Hell yeah. Got a surprise for us tonight,” he said, pulling out a tiny plastic baggie. Inside were six small black pills.

“Man, you know I don’t mess with pills. What is this?”

“Trust me. I took two last night. It was the best time of my life. Felt like I was a unicorn.”

“A unicorn? You serious? How long did it last?”

“That’s the crazy part. Felt like twelve, fourteen hours, but when I came down, it had only been ten minutes.”

“Bullshit.”

He looked fine. Alive. Seemed normal. I gave in.

The doorbell rang.

“Must be Rodger,” Brian said, heading for the door.

Rodger stumbled in, drunk. He looked at the pills and laughed. “Thought they’d be bigger.”

He was in a good mood. Said he was getting back with his girlfriend. Happier than I’d seen him in a while. He was sad for a long time. 

Brian explained the pills: how the room turned into open countryside, how he became a unicorn, how free it felt. I listened, but at some point, all these stories start to blend together.

We dimmed the lights, turned on the TV, and put on music. Brian handed us each two pills and a glass of water.

We took them.

At first, the soft music and TV made me feel good. We laughed, talked, chilled. Rodger reminded us of old times we spent together. We talked about Mrs. Hinkle's class, our first job at the diner, and chasing ladies in our short tenure at college. It was nice before things got weird.

Rodger got up and went to the bathroom. When he came back, his pupils were huge. He just stood there, staring.

“You okay?” I asked.

“This is crazy, man,” he said.

Then Brian had to pee. I heard the flush. Suddenly, I had to go too.

Brian came back with glassy eyes and lay down on the couch.

I walked past Rodger. He was drooling. The piss felt euphoric. Like letting go of everything.

—

When I came out of the bathroom, Rodger was face down on the floor.

But the floor wasn’t carpet anymore. It was metal, cold, hard, industrial. It smelled like oil.

“Are you okay?” I asked.

“He’s fine,” Brian said. “Said it felt like marshmallows.”

“Why is everything made of metal?”

“It’s not, man. Just relax.”

I realized I was high and collapsed on the couch, closing my eyes.

I saw colors I didn’t recognize. I saw monkeys running through a jungle. Bright green leaves, vines. I swung like Tarzan. I felt like a king.

Then I got scared.

I opened my eyes—

—

—And I was walking out of the bathroom again.

Rodger was on the floor. The room was black this time. Still smelled like oil. The walls weren’t right.

“Are you okay?” I asked.

“He’s fine,” Brian said. “Didn’t I tell you to relax?”

“Didn’t we already have this conversation?”

Brian smiled. “You’ve been standing there a while. Why don’t you lie down?”

“Okay.”

I lay next to him and closed my eyes.

This time it was darker. A room with no lights. A loud ringing in my ears. I felt small. I wanted a girlfriend like Rodger. I wanted to be back in the jungle.

—

Then I opened my eyes—

—And I was walking out of the bathroom again.

Rodger was on the floor. He looked scared this time.

“Are you okay?”

“He’s fine, bro. I’m starting to worry about you. Didn’t I say that already?”

“Yeah.”

I got on the couch and shut my eyes.

I saw demons. I opened them again. Everything was black. The light was gone.

I stepped out and asked about Rodger.

Rodger’s eyes were red. So were Brian’s.

“Are you okay?”

“Fuck you, Rodger,” Brian snapped. “You’re always drunk. Your girlfriend should’ve left you. And fuck you for always worrying about him.”

I didn’t understand the anger.

They charged me. Grunting, snarling like animals. Lifeless eyes.

I ran up the stairs.

“Stop chasing me! Please!”

“Alexa, call 911!”

I threw a vase. Nothing. I locked myself in the bathroom.

Silence. 

Scratching at the door. They charged it. Slammed into it. 

Silence. 

I opened the door and peeked out.

They were standing there. Red eyes. Rodger looked worse with his gray skin, mouth twitching.

They charged again.

Tore through my skin. I bled. I screamed.

—

Then I was back in the basement.

Rodger was on the floor. Brian is on the couch.

It felt real, but wrong.

“Are you okay?” I asked.

They attacked me again. Like chimps. I ran. Threw the vase. Locked the bathroom door.

“Alexa, call 911!”

“Please.”

They scratched at the door. Punched it. I cried. I just wanted to go home.

A knock.

“This is the police. We got a 911 call. Is everything alright?”

“Help! Help me! They’re killing me!”

I heard yelling. Then gunshots.

Relief.

They knocked.

“It’s okay,” someone said.

I opened the door.

Red eyes.

The cop lunged. He bit me. Punched me. I screamed—

—

—and woke up in the basement again.

The *real* basement.

Blue carpet. Normal light. No oil.

I stepped out of the bathroom.

Rodger wasn’t on the floor.

“Bro, are you okay?” Brian asked. “What happened to you?”

“You’re covered in blood,” said Rodger. He looked scared.

Rodger stepped toward me. I thought he was attacking.

I grabbed the lamp.

I smashed his face in.

“Holy shit, bro!” Brian shouted. “You’re with me. It’s okay!”

I punched him. Ran upstairs.

“Alexa, call 911!”

I hid in the bathroom. I heard Rodger moaning. Brian trying to help him.

This wasn’t real. It was never going to be real again.

I lay on the tile floor and cried.

Brian knocked.

“Bro, Rodger’s hurt bad. You smashed my mirror. You’re bleeding everywhere.”

“Fuck you. I’m not falling for it.”

Another knock.

“This is the police. What’s going on in there? We got a 911 call.”

“Get in here now!” Brian shouted.

He explained everything—how we took drugs, how I hurt myself, how I hurt Rodger.

This time it was *really* the police.

They arrested me for assault.

And Brian for distributing narcotics.

They tested the pills. Couldn’t identify them. Said they’d never seen anything like it.

I passed out in the cop car. When I woke up, I told them what I told you.

They didn’t believe me. Said I was strung out. Said I didn’t know up from down.

My lawyer said I wouldn’t be held responsible.

“Responsible for what?” I asked.

“You killed your buddy with that lamp.”

—

I wanted to die.

Brian went to jail. The state blamed him.

They said I was a victim.

I didn’t feel like one.

I spent a lot of time with Rodger’s family. They didn’t blame me.

I did.

—

Ever since that night, every time I close my eyes, I see Rodger face down on the floor.

He always looks happy.

“Are you okay?” I ask.

“Just fine,” he says. “Feels like marshmallows. I ain’t mad at you.”

“I’ll see you real soon, Rodger.

Real soon.”
