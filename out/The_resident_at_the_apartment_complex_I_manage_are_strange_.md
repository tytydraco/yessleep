I know I spoke about the weird behavior of the apartment complex, but I didn't really say much about the residents themselves. I can't really give away resident information, but what I can do is give some vague ideas on what it is I mean by calling them strange.
First of all, I want to say that people do live here.

What I mean is *people*, normal people, human people. At least, some of the residents are human people. I saw someone comment about the complex not being the best for people who have disabilities, but that's why for all residents I give them my personal cellphone number so if they can't reach me at the desk, they can reach me directly. I've picked up food deliveries and stood outside on the sidewalk as a living beacon for taxis and Ubers. The complex has elevators too, and some pretty decent accommodations, so for those of you worried about your fellow humans, I've got you covered.

A decent amount of the residents though, maybe even a majority, are not human. They can look human, they can walk and talk and behave like humans do, but they are not human.

For example, one of the residents here looks perfectly human; just think of what a human looks like and yeah, that's what they look like.

The only difference between this resident and the rest of us is that they have the same head turning capability as an owl. If you've seen the way an owl can turn their head a full 180 or even 270, this resident can do that without any problems whatsoever.

Another resident has a constantly changing eye color. What I mean by that is that every single time this resident blinks, their eyes are a completely different color. I've seen their eyes cycle from brown to green to blue to red before, all during the course of a single conversation. I genuinely don't know if they control what color or if it's entirely random, never thought to ask.

Those are just the ones who look human but have small quirks, that's not even covering the residents that actually need to put effort into appearing human. I've got residents with wings, tails, fangs, multiple eyes, multiple mouths, horns, unnatural skin colors, and some that can do straight up body horror level of creepy things.

Climbs walls? Got a resident like that. A living voodoo doll? Got a resident like that too. Shapeshifter? I've had so many I can't even keep track. If you think of a nonhuman sentient entity type, chances are l've rented out a suite to someone like them before. They're mostly civil, but just like humans you got the "Karens" and the "Chads" and the "Kyles," you know the type of people that like to just be a complete nuisance with no regard for other people?

Anyway yeah, the complex is home to people from all over, even people you never thought could exist. I've got stories to tell about my time here so far, so don't worry, this won't be the last you hear from me. Now if you'll excuse me, 429 needs me to fix their window for the 20th time.
