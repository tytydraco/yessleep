Ok so. When my parents got divorced it of course left some impact on me. my mental health got worse and when it all happened I was also bullied at school. I started to hate myself and I stayed up the whole night crying. I was like 11 when it happened. You might be thinking that I was too young to be experiencing that but I'm not lying I was really that age. 

OK let's get to the story. So my mental health was probably at its worst and my mum decided to leave me home so I could get more sleep since I haven't slept really good in a while (keep in mind that I had severe hallucinations.)It's probably like 1:42 and I wake up I hear a strange noise coming from downstairs. 

I tried to ignore it but it sounded like the noise was coming closer. So like every little kid would do I decided to check it out. I opened the doors leading to the stairs and I saw something peeking over the corner as soon as I saw it, it dissappeared. Also I gotta say this. Downstairs we have the living room and the bathroom but to get to the bathroom you gotta go through the living room. OK got it? 

So I also had to go to the bathroom. So I closed my eyes and just went for it but I ran into a wall so I had to open my eyes. And there wasn't a wall I ran into nothing. Like I was in the middle of the living room and then I saw it. A shadow like figure was standing in front of me. 

I screamed at the top of my lungs but no one was home so nobody heard me. I started running upstairs. (Also I was really into like demons and stuff so this is where I knew this part from.) I quickly ran into the kitchen and grabbed some salt. 

I ran into my room closed the door. I tried to barricade them but I rushed it so it didn't work. I made a circle of salt around me and I started praying to god and hoped that this was all just in my head. I heard my door being opened I realised that soon there will be no one to hear my prayers but as soon as I looked up at the figure. I passed out and when I woke up it was like 3:52pm. 

My mum always gets home at around 5pm. So I looked around and the figure was nowhere to be seen. I looked for evidence that all of that happened and I did find one it was a scratch on my door I even took a picture of it. 

When my mum with my younger brother got home I immediately told her and showed her the scratch on the door but it disappeared so I looked at the picture but it was also gone. Then I heard a deep voice giggle and I looked in the kitchen and the figure was standing there peeking through the doorway. To this day I can still hear his voice in my head.
