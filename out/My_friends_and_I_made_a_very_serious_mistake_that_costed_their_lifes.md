Hi - I am Mary. I am an orphan and I still haven't found a family yet.

 The reason why I am writing this post is, that you never go to an abandoned Building that had paranormal sightings at night (especially at Halloween night)

My friends that I had been around with since 4th grade had the idea of going to an abandoned building near the woods.

 It was an old Orphanage that they found on a sketchy website and they decided that it would be cool, if we go to that on Halloween night, since we didn't have any plans and Halloween was right around the Corner.

 So 2 days passed, and my friends and I arrived at a restaurant near that building. We ate and had a good time there and after we gave the waiter a 20% tip because of his great service, we made our way to the abandoned building.

 The lawn looked like it just got mowed and I grew a little bit of suspicion, but my friend Brian told me to just shake it out of my head, like it is nothing.

 As soon as we arrived in the middle of the lawn infront of the porch and door, It began to be foggy. Obviously that was a red flag for me and it almost made me leave my friends there and walk home. 

If I better had left! My friends might have followed me and made something different but no, my $tupid a$$ did not leave.

 The door to the building was locked and the windows where barricaded and I thought: ''Thank God'' but then one of my friends pulled out a crowbar from nowhere and ripped off the wooden planks and busted down the window and after, we headed inside. 

We took out our Flashlights and began to look for a lightswitch, even though we thought the lights wouldn't work. Surprisingly, they did work, but the light was very dim. That one lightswitch set off every lightbulb in the building. 

We decided to split up into groups of 2. Dave and I went upstairs while Brian and Silvia stayed in this floor. They said we should go explore more of that building and we went to the 2nd floor.

 The first room was chaotic with babybeds and creepy dolls in them. There also where some dolls laying on the ground and as we left the room we heard one say : '' Ma-Ma'' I was terrified and Dave comforted me saying everything is going to be OK.

 The 2nd room was a bathroom and It was covered in Blood and other body liquids that I better not list here.

 The lights went out an the door shut. We tried to open it many times and on the 7th try it finally opened. 

Brian and Silvia haven't switched on the Power generator in the basement and we figured to check it out.

 They weren't there and I turned it on again and left the basement while Dave stayed. He found a strange painting in there and he really was interested in it. While he stared at that painting I found and pulled a lever not knowing what will happen. 

A thick glass door trapped Dave in the basement and spikes were coming out of the walls. They started moving and Dave was screaming as loud as he can and banged his hands on the glass door to get help.

 I ran into a room that had a crowbar identical to the one that Brian used to break the barricade on a table and I grabbed it and sprinted to the door, trying to break it with it. 

As I thought it is too late, the last bang of the tool in my hands broke the door and I got a glass piece into my arm. It really had hurt but the most important thing is that Dave was able to escape just in time, before being impaled by the spikes and crushed from the wall.

 He was terrified and cried a bit and I tried to comfort him, which didn't work that good.

 I looked over his shoulder and found a hallway that I think got opened by the lever. I told him to follow me into the corridor and there were 2 doors at the end of them. we could hear screaming from both doors and decided to go into the first door.

 Silvia was strapped on a hospital bed n@ked and there was a venomous tarantula on her chest, crawling up. Dave took action and grabbed it, risking being bitten. He threw it on the floor and crushed it with his shoe and I helped freeing her from the tape and rope.

 I gave her a 2nd pair of pants, because I always have 2, just incase that p3riod hits because I am late on it again. I also gave her my Jacket and we went outside to go into the other room.

 We were horrified seeing Brian in his shape. He got stabbed multiple times in his throat which lead to his vocal chords being destroyed, his left arm got ripped off, he got scalped, his right arm was snapped in half, his feet got broken and half of his face got ripped off.

What's even worse is, He was still alive. Some ghost mutilated him first and then it used their supernatural power to keep him alive through all his pain.

We immediately ran out of that room horrified by what we just saw and found a book on the floor. Silvia picked it up and read out loud what was written in there

 '' By ThE TiMe YoU PiCkED Up ThAt BoOk And StARTeD ReaDiNg ThIS, It Is AlReAdY Too LaTe'' 

After she was finished something invisible grabbed and hold her up in the air. It revealed what it looks like and it is a horrifying Demon looking creature.

It bit her head off and started munching on her body. We ran as fast as we could, but it started catching up. We found a hole in the wall and I screamed at Dave to squeeze through it as fast as he can.

He slipped through it with ease and I barely made it.

It made an ear killing scream and disappeared. We ran away together to our homes, ready to go to bed but both of us weren't able to fall asleep.

The day after the incident Dave committed $ui$ide by hanging himself and I was brought into a mental hospital, where I recovered in half a year and they let me go live my life normally again.

 A post on the Internet said that the body of Brian was never found and the building got destroyed for good.
