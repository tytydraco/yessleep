Nightmares have plagued my sleep since I was a small child. The first dream I remember having consisted of a giant gorilla eating my mother in front of me, and then eating me. Real creative for a 4-year-old; only mildly concerning.

I have gotten used to the terrors. I only awaken from my own screams once in awhile, now.

The nightmare I had last night was different.

I was inside of a huge circular building, almost like the Colosseum. The architecture and decor was intricate; wood carvings on the crown moldings, sconces and chandeliers and artisanal carpets. There were no windows, but giant impressive paintings, reminiscent of Michelangelo or da Vinci, inside of massive carved gold frames.

I was standing in a walkway, about 10 feet wide, starting from the structure’s wall. A black metal fence with delicate floral cutaways kept people from falling from the other side of walkway. I leaned over this fence to peer down.

On the floor, surrounded by this walkway – which sloped up and up and up, infinitely, encircling the walls of the building – was a courtroom. A huge courtroom with hundreds of pews seating hundreds of people. I was about 200 feet up. Hundreds of more people stood facing down the slope of the walkway where I stood, in a line.

A judge, with his powdered wig and his gavel, sat upon a huge judge’s stand that towered above everyone standing on the floor of the structure.

I stood here, taking in my surroundings for a moment. I started to understand I was dreaming (I have learned to lucid dream over time, although I cannot control my dreams), and decided to start walking down the walkway towards the courtroom floor.

I walked, past all the people, who grunted and bickered with me for “cutting.” I didn’t reply.

Then, a young girl exited the line and began walking towards me.

She stopped me. “What are you doing?”

“Trying to see where I am,” I replied.

“Well, you’re waiting your turn.” She told me.

“For what?”

“To see where you’ll go.” She said, seeming to grow anxious. She bit her lip.

“What does that mean?” I was thoroughly confused.

She sighed. “You see all these people?”

I nod.

“They are all waiting their turn. As will you. They will make their way to the courtroom, and when it is their turn, the judge will decide if they go to the good or the bad. Depending on how you lived, or rather, how you didn’t live.”

Though she tried to break this news to me softly, it didn’t make it any less horrifying.

“Like purgatory? But… I'm not dead. I’m just asleep.” I argued, feeling a crushing pressure build up in my chest.

“Oh, honey, if you’re here, you’re dead.” She said sadly, grabbing my shoulder.

My knees shook. I started to sweat. Tears threatened to escape my eyes. I started spinning.

“No. No, no no. I'm just sleeping. I just need to wake up.”

I started hitting myself. Smacking, punching, throwing myself on the floor until I bled. The girl watched me silently, with a pitiful expression on her face, as though she dealt with this kind of thing all of the time.

My consciousness began to split, I guess. I half-awoke in my bed, thrashing in my covers, knocking things off of my night stand. I grunted, unable to speak. I tried to stand up, but it was as if my back was glued to my mattress. I have never had sleep paralysis before.

As I looked around my room, some aspects were normal, but some came straight from that place. The carved crown molding and artisan carpet appeared in my bedroom, luring me back. Trying to make me drift off again.

I literally held my eyelids open with my fingers, forcing them wide as they fought me. I could hear the girl, I could feel her, rubbing my shoulder and telling me it was okay to let go.

In a split second, the sweat and tears made my fingers slip and my eyelids fell closed. I immediately returned, laying on the floor, the girl sitting beside me caressing my back.

“See? Here you are. Dead, like the rest of us. Now wait your turn.”

I screamed. I flailed my arms and I scratched her face. She scooted backwards clutching her cheek.

A group of large men rushed towards me from both directions of the walkway. I reacted quickly, without thinking, and I jumped over the side railing before they could get to me.

I fell, for what felt like hours, watching as the decorative tile floor of the court room closed in on me.

The girl’s voice echoed in my ears as she shouted after me, “We’ll see you soon.”

Right before the impact, I woke up screaming.

Still confused and loopy, I stepped out of my bed, slowly walked across my bedroom on two tingling legs, and swung open my bedroom door. I stumbled downstairs to my mother in the living room.

Collapsing on the living room rug, I cried.

I don’t think I was dreaming. I think my consciousness was transported somewhere, somewhere I wasn’t supposed to see quite yet. Or maybe I did die, for a split second, in my sleep somehow. Maybe someone decided it wasn’t my time.

I think about that girl often, and though I haven’t had a dream like that since, I have a dreadful feeling that I’ll be seeing her again one day.
