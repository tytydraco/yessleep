Calling the little place that I lived a sleepy small town seems ironic right around now. Not like any of us were going to sleep any time soon. Or ever again, maybe.

I’ve been awake for seventy two hours now, so give me a little grace when it comes to keeping my story straight. The past few days in Hazelwood have been chaotic for everyone, and we’re all running on fumes.

The last morning everything was normal was Saturday. I ran out to Wally’s Grocery to get a few things to throw on the grill that night. Figured I’d have a couple friends over, a few drinks, set up the fire pit now that weather was getting more crisp, have a nice night. I barely got through the door when the trucks started going through the streets, a prerecorded message playing asking everyone to return to their homes for their own safety. 

An alert came through on my phone within seconds, echoing the sentiments.

EMERGENCY ALERT: Please stay indoors. Intense meteorological events imminent in your area. For your own safety, please remain inside with windows and doors closed.

Weird, but okay. Maybe there was a storm system coming through, but why wouldn’t it say that there would be a tornado watch or something? Everyone else was just as confused, milling back to their cars to head back home. I did the same, hopping in my crappy old hatchback and getting back home within minutes. After going inside, I set up near the window for a few, curious to see what might be going on. 

Well… the alert wasn’t wrong. Clouds rolled in quick- massive, dark, swirling ones. I could see purple lightning even discharging in some, with the occasional flash of green coming through. The rain that came with it brought a smell that I could pick up even from inside the house. Metallic, though with a hint of acidity that almost stung my nostrils. There was nobody out on the streets, not even animals running around. 

All in all it came down pretty hard, but only lasted maybe twenty minutes at most. The second alert followed not long after everything stopped, this one making me a lot more nervous than the first.

EMERGENCY ALERT- PLEASE REMAIN INDOORS. STAY AWAKE. DO NOT FALL ASLEEP OR ALLOW ANY FRIENDS AND LOVED ONES TO DO THE SAME. PLEASE STAY TUNED FOR FURTHER UPDATES.

This one… this one had me. I honestly thought it was a hoax for a minute, like that time someone sent a fake nuke warning to everyone in Hawaii. The more I looked around outside though, the more I wondered. Everything was too still, especially for a Saturday morning. Not even the birds were chirping. Hell, even the crickets and frogs that normally would be throwing a fucking rave after every shower didn’t have anything to say. Just eerie quiet, not even a breeze to rustle the leaves.

An ambulance cut the silence, tearing down the main street just a few dozen feet away, going further into town. They didn’t usually go that fast down this part of the road, considering all the residential homes out here they had to blow by. I walked out on my front porch, looking around to see what the hell might be going on.

”Strange weather, ain’t it?” A gruff voice shouted over to me. Across the road and to the left, old Mr. Hutch was sitting out on his porch, rocking in that same old chair he spent hours in. 

“Yeah, weird stuff. Those alerts seem real to you?” I asked. He looked at me, not understanding, so I held up my phone to him, “The emergency alerts that came through, did you get them?”

”Oh, I ain’t got one of those damn things. Just the landline, don’t need all that Facebook and tweeter bullshit.” He said, starting to go off louder. “Somethin’ happening in town?”

”Not sure to be honest, I just got an alert that said stay inside and don’t fall asleep. Might not want to stay on the rocker too long, in that case.” I said. He only laughed. 

“Son, I’ve taken Saturday naps at noon since I was a boy. Didn’t even miss ‘em when I was ridin’ choppers in Vietnam. The cell phones ain’t gonna stop that.” He chuckled out. I couldn’t help but laugh along with him. Man had his priorities, after all. Not like I could argue him out of taking a nap on his porch.

”Enjoy it! I’ll catch you later! Tell Mrs. Hutch I still want her Swedish meatball recipe when she gets a chance” We both gave parting waves, I stepped back inside, moving into my home office just down the hallway from the front door. Cracking the blinds here, I had a full view of the neighborhood, including Hutch now beginning to nod off on his porch. While I booted up my computer and started getting a little work done, I just figured I would keep an eye on things. 

I don’t know how much time had passed. Maybe minutes, maybe an hour at most, but I started noticing him kind of jerking around in the seat. The guy was in his late seventies, so I got a little nervous and started to run outside, seeing what if he needed help or was just having a bad dream. 

Barely made it off my porch when his head quite literally ejected from his body. I… I don’t know how else to describe it. Fired right off his shoulders like a damn firework on Independence Day. Soon as it did though, something else just sprouted right from the bloody stump, taking up residence where his head was before. Looked like this… centipede thing. Tons of spindly legs coming out of the sides with one huge, hexic eye right in the center. It bent and swayed on the shoulders as it extended from his body, getting used to it before making it stand, walking into his house next.

For a minute I was split on what to do. Either run back into my place and barricade the door or run in and try to save Mrs. Hutch, assuming she was in there. Not that I had to assume long, as a scream cut the air just seconds later. No time to think, I ran full burst up the porch steps and through the front door, emerging on a terrifying scene.

Hutch’s body was pressing down on his wife, the massive centipede bursting from his stump neck striking at her. It had already gotten her a couple of times, dozens of sharp tendrils extending from the mouth of the thing had nicked at her skin. Apparently that’s all it took, something secreted in those pincers was winning the battle over Mrs. Hutch, making her quickly lose consciousness and fall to the floor. As she fell asleep, the Hutch-centipede thing got up, turning attention to me now as it walked forward.

”Woah, woah, woah, hey, no! Leave me alone, Hutch! I swear to god…” I said, scrambling to find anything that could function as a weapon. There was a bag of golf clubs right by the door. Not sure what I was about to get from it, but gripping one of the handles, I pulled it up, emerging with a damn thick driver. Good enough.

No hesitation. This thing didn’t have a damn head, it didn’t have any rights other than what it was about to get. I swung the club hard, catching the centipede thing right on the tip, making it hiss as it reeled back. 

Mrs. Hutch began writhing on the floor, screams coming through in guttural barks as something tore at her throat from the inside. Her head didn’t fly off nearly as violently as his did, but stretched and tore instead, pain and fear in her eyes the whole time. It looked like even while she was feeling this, she was just going through a nightmare in her sleep, seeing death play out on an infinite scale in her mind. The centipede that emerged here was smaller than the other, and didn’t seem to have control over the body quite yet, maybe because it appeared too early. Either way, Hutch was still bearing down on me, so I swung again, this time retreating for the door, desperate to get to safety.

Backing through the door nearly caused me to trip over the threshold, swinging once more at the terrifying bug as it lashed out at me. This time it caught my swing, twisting around the club in order to take it away from me as arms raised to grab onto whatever of me it could reach. Stumbling probably saved my life, giving me a slight distance to turn and start running down steps, back over to my house.

Clouds were still obscuring the sky above, fresh flashes of lightning beginning to go off above. Something was in the air, different than after any other storm, and the sound of screams began to reach me faintly over the still air. I wasn’t the only one contending with what was going on, apparently. 

The door slammed behind me as I dove through, quickly deadbolting and locking it before drawing my blinds closed. It only took seconds for them to start banging on the door then, massive thuds landing on the solid wood, way more power behind the hits than old Hutch ever had in him in his prime. 

At this point I’m not going to fuck around with whatever is happening. There was an old shotgun up in the attic in a case, left to me by gramps when he died a few years ago. Thing should still work, and if I remembered right there was some ammo on hand in the same case it came with. Don’t think I would have ever taken it out of the case otherwise. Thankfully I could still remember all the shooting lessons he gave me when I was a kid, gun nut as he was, and it all began to come back.

It wasn’t much. Just a pump action. Seven shells left in the ammo box that was in the case. It would be enough. I racked it, making sure there wasn’t already a shell in the chamber before beginning to load them in. The banging was still going at the door downstairs, but only one of them remained from the sound of it. It was cold up here in the attic, stale air and insulation the only thing other than old boxes to keep me company. For a few minutes I checked out, I think, taking in the weight of everything happening today. Hell, I needed a moment just to prepare myself. Centipede head or not, this was still my neighbor for the last four years. He and his wife had invited me into their home plenty of times, fed me some great dinners, and now… well, now it was like some fucked up Resident Evil game I was getting to live through.

A skittering from the other side of the attic wall brought me back to the present. The thin wood and insulation was being pressed inward, something tapping along as it tried to find a way in from. the other side. Probably the worst fucking noise I’ve ever heard too, like dozens of roaches just skittering across a wooden board. My skin was crawling, hoisting the shotgun to my shoulder and aiming as the taps moved closer to the small vent in the wall, leading to outside. I could see the shadow over the slats before legs began poking through them, working to stretch what it could and fit through, desperate to get to me.

It kept working at the slats for a moment before one finally gave in, weathered from years. This house was old, so not too much of a surprise, but as soon as it gave that was the reinforcement the crawler needed, forcing its way further in and extending further through the vent, catching sight of me right as I pulled the trigger.

It burst, guts and pieces of the shell flying everywhere while legs rained down. The remainder of it slumped over, dangling in the window as I made my way back through the attic door, still focusing my gun right on the damned thing.

I got downstairs and heard Mrs. Hutch still beating on the door, fistfalls getting louder as she seemingly gained more power behind the blows. I hesitated only momentarily, unlocking the deadbolt and stepping off to the side into the hallway, behind the door as it opened. Gun trained right at where eye level would be, or at least where I hoped it would be when she eventually entered the house.

Almost shit my pants when this thing curled right around the doorway and stared into my fucking soul before I got it together and pulled the trigger. It burst, spattering guts all over me and making my ears ring at close range. Her body fell forward into the doorway, remains of the centipede skittering on the wood floor as it went through death convulsions.

I stepped out, partially to see if anyone else came out on hearing the noise and partially to see what had happened to Hutch’s body. The answer was slumped on the lawn right by the wall, centipede extended all the way up and through the attic vent. His body wasn’t even able to fall completely, with the centipede holding it up, likely at the limit it could stretch. Legs ran the entire length of it, making me shiver just looking.

Grabbing Mrs. Hutch’s ankles, I pulled her back out onto the lawn, getting her out of the way so I could close the door and re-lock it. Without the worry  of what the hell it might do to me, I was able to look closer at it now, seeing that the “centipede” I had thought it was is actually something much worse.

Every segment of the thing was part of her spine, vertebrae growing over each other as it extended out of her stump neck. The end of it where the shotgun had blasted off looked like a frayed electrical wire, dozens of smaller strands of spinal cord unraveling and at the top. I shivered, unsure of what the hell was going on, but knowing that it wasn’t something I wanted any part of.

The door slammed behind me. This time though I took a few other safety measures, pushing the recliner from the living room against the door frame to block it.

Tried calling EMS to see if there was anyone that would even pick up, but sirens were blaring through the still air, mixing with far off screams as more of the town began to contend with what was happening. The line was dead, much like I expected, and all I could do was sigh, turning on the television and knowing our dinky little town would never get the attention of the news. Sure enough, just more crap instead of news. A CEO arrested for money laundering, a reality star who was fighting back against plastic surgery rumors, another war on the horizon with some far off country… usual day in America. 

God I was tired. I remember pacing my house until the sun went down, just hoping that I could hear something about what was happening in the world outside. Meanwhile the cloud cover was still there, jolts of electricity lighting up the skyline every so often. The sirens eventually faded, but the screams didn’t, only changing position as more of the town found the same thing I did, just without as much luck surviving.

Good news was that I had a decent amount of food. My grocery trip this morning was for a pretty spontaneous get together, not that I had heard from anyone since that first alert popped up. If my friends were still out there, I hoped they were still human at least. If not… who knows, maybe they made it out before things got bad.

For once, I was kind of thankful for my bad sleep schedule. Insomnia was something I’ve struggled with on and off my entire life, going whole nights without sleep at some points and just segueing into the next day. Not sleeping wasn’t too much of a challenge for me, for a while, anyway. 

Eventually I just drew the blinds and tried to find something to do to keep my mind occupied, hoping some alert would come through, telling me that everything was okay now and it was just some… I don’t know. Nothing about this would fit into any natural explanation. Who knows, maybe it’s still all a dream and I’m just asleep in bed, unaware that my alarm’s gone off at this point. Wishful thinking, of course.

Around two in the morning, someone set one of the houses down the street on fire. Despite the rainy conditions that had persisted since the first warning, the entire neighborhood quickly began to catch with no firefighters coming to get it under control. I was nearly dozing off in my living room, television on loud to hopefully keep me awake with the noise. Figured with where it was relative to the street outside, the sound wouldn’t reach too terribly far, giving me some safety.

I only realized the fire was going when I started to smell the smoke. Looking out the front window revealed it had already jumped pretty far, only about two houses away from me. I was going to need to get the hell out of here or face the flames.

Took everything I could, shotgun, a little cooler of food I threw together that could easily be eaten without prep, some medical supplies from the bathroom… loaded it all up in the car and hit the road. It only took me about five minutes of driving to reach the edge of town and realize things were far, far more fucked than I had originally believed.

Cue my fucking surprise when I’m driving along the highway, going slower than normal thankfully because I wanted to be vigilant, and I run my car smack into a solid goddamn wall. Can’t believe how fortunate I was to get out relatively unscathed, only a nasty bruise on my shoulder. Getting out of the car though, I thought I had hit my head and gone to hell, because things just stopped making sense. 

The sky above was still sparking with electricity, blanketed by dark clouds against the night. It obscured the top of whatever… wall was blocking my way, though I don’t know if it was so much of a wall as a boundary. Not going to lie, I was feeling very Truman Show-esque. Or maybe Looney Tunes, considering how much of a weird fever dream this was. The barrier had the road and landscape around town perfectly laid over it, not painted, I don’t think, but kind of like a television. The clouds crackled with lightning in the distance, despite that distance not actually being there. Maybe it was just a really thick window, I honestly couldn’t tell with the darkness and my aching body. Whatever the hell it was, there was no way for me to get through. No staircase with a door, no hatch leading through, not even a painted tunnel.

My car in the meantime was… well, not great. The front end was accordioned to hell, folding all over itself. It’s a miracle I was still alive, but honestly the miracle made it feel more like I was trapped in this hell, damned never to escape.
