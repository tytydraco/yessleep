Henry and I were born six weeks early. 

Mom says we came out looking like a pair of grapes. Our lips and skin were dyed a dull bluish-purple, and she could almost fit both of us in the palm of her hand. That’s an outrageously gentle way of describing two suffocating babies, but I guess that’s Mom for you. 

Put more bluntly, Henry and I were born on death's door. 

We couldn’t breathe, not on our own, not with the equipment that God loaned us. Machines were tasked with breathing for us in the neonatal ICU. Tubes as thin as coffee straws pumped microscopic gulps of fresh air down our throats, offloading our immature lungs, giving them space to rest and develop. For a little while, it seemed like the worst was over. Seemed like we both would live. Seemed like we’d both be normal.    

Then, I bled into my brain. 

The vessels were too young, too fragile. One of them snapped. Blood pooled quickly, crushed whole sections of my brain against the inside of my skull before they could release the pressure. The surgeons told Mom I had a fifty percent chance of survival, but I’d almost certainly be damaged goods if I did survive. 

When tempers flare, Henry likes to speculate on whether Dad would have stuck around if I *hadn’t* survived. Maybe he wouldn’t have gotten so overwhelmed. Perhaps he could have tolerated the burden of a single, normal kid. Forces me to remind him that Dad bolted for the border the day we were born, a full week before my brain bled. He sprinted from the delivery room at the mere sight of us - his grape-skinned, breathless, keychain babies.

Cerebral palsy and deafness aren’t the worst cards to hold. 

So what if my ears don’t work? So what if my muscles aren’t perfect? It is what it is. If we’re to blame for Dad’s abandonment, then so be it, but I won’t shoulder the blame alone. I mean, that’s what twins do, right? We split the world down the middle and share it equally, including the shitty parts? *Especially* the shitty parts?

Anyway. 

Last week, for the first time in fifteen years, I heard something.

I heard *them*. 

Digging through the earth, burrowing towards the surface. 

Coming to hollow us out. 

\- - - - -

***48 hours before they arrived:***

My eyes shot open. 

There was a strange pressure in my skull, a thrumming beneath my temples. 

Terror chewed through my chest. I launched myself from bed, strapped on my arm braces, and scrambled into the hallway to pound on Grandpa’s door. Mom would come running at the slightest noise, but Grandpa slept like a corpse.

The drive to the emergency room was torture. I had no idea what was happening inside my skull. I assumed my brain was bleeding. That murderous vessel was deadset on finishing the job.

Henry bitched in the waiting room for hours because Mom wouldn’t let him stay home alone. He was convinced the sensation was “psychological”. Kept repeating the phrase “it’s just another Felix freak-out”. My brother didn’t just say it, either: he said it *and* signed it. Could have spared me the heartache by just whispering it when my head was turned, but no, he had to twist the knife.

It hurt even more when it started to seem like Henry was right. 

My physical exam was unremarkable. My bloodwork was fine. The CT scan didn’t show any blood sloshing around my brain. The doctor’s best guess? Sinus infection. 

A fucking *sinus infection*. 

Listen, I don’t blame that doctor; she was nice, and she tried. The idea that I could be hearing again would have been an outlandish hypothesis. Wasn't like I was much help, either. I had no experience with noise. I mean, I understood it conceptually. I knew the words - *screech, thud, buzz, boom, thump* \- but that’s all they were to me: words. Names of famous celebrities whose faces I’ve never seen. 

Touch felt like a cousin to sound, so I pictured hearing was like having a set of big, invisible fingertips. Maybe a shrill noise feels like touching a hot stove. Maybe a soft noise is like running my fingers over a clean, silk pillowcase. 

And what did *this* noise feel like, this thrumming below my temples?

Well, I was rummaging through the attic last year, digging through winter clothes, hunting for a lost sweater. When I finally found it and held it up, something shifted near the collar. A massive, black cockroach leapt out from the inside of that sweater. It landed on my cheek and skittered down the side of my neck before falling to floor and disappearing into the shadows. 

Chaotic. 

Impulsive.

Unpredictable, restless, and willing to eat anything, exactly like a cockroach. 

*That’s* what it felt like. 

\- - - - -

***10 hours before they arrived:***

Henry shoved a forkful of roast beef into his mouth before he started complaining to Mom. Talking and chewing at the same time made it difficult for me to read his lips: it was all too sloppy. Henry loved pretending like he'd forgotten that fact. 

I didn’t catch everything he said. 

“Why - - - coddling him? You - - - care of him forever - - - not my job - - - protect him.”

*If you’re going to talk about him, in front of him, you damn well better have the respect to let him know what you’re saying, Henry* \- my Mom signed. Her hands moved forcefully, as if an evaluator was hiding somewhere in the room, covertly grading her clarity and technique. One of her chipped gel nails flew across the room as she signed the word *respect*. 

Shame writhed like a serpent stuck in my gut. I looked to Grandpa. He was scooping his fork over the table, trying to wrassle some meat, missing the plate again and again. My Mom’s anxious eyes caught me looking to him for comfort. Sometimes it felt like she couldn’t stop watching me, even if she wanted to. 

“PHIL!” 

“Hmm...?” he replied, still focused on fishing some dinner from his plate. 

“Your glasses?” Grandpa furrowed his brow. Then, there was a burst of recognition, a *Eureka!* moment. I could practically see the dusty light bulb flicker dimly above his head. 

“Oh! Right, right, right...” A pair of thick glasses rested on his sternum, hanging from his neck via a gold chain that connected to each arm. Mom made sure he was always wearing the necklace, but he would often take off the glasses and forget they were there.

He patted his shirt until his hand stumbled upon the glasses, then slid them on. His face broke into a warm, genuine smile, finally able to see us.

*How was your day, Grandpa?* \- I signed. 

*Pretty good! Another beautiful afternoon to be delivering mail. Just between us, I think Miss. Hudson has the hots for me - don’t tattle to her husband, though, alright?* 

He blew imaginary smoke from a pair of finger guns and winked at me. I forced a grin and nodded. Henry's face contorted into a scowl, gaze fixed on his mashed potatoes, stirring them harshly. 

Grandpa was long retired. He hadn’t delivered mail in years.

Age had taken a toll on his mind. His memory had become like the weather: clear one day, cloudy the next, and the forecast could change on a dime. Despite his senility, the seventy-six-year-old was remarkably spry, lean, and energetic. On good days, I was happy to know that at least his body was still intact, but on shittier days, his situation just tasted like a bitter irony. He had beautifully maintained machinery, but he wasn’t always behind the wheel. I was beyond grateful that his ASL remained intact, but, perhaps more than anything else, I feared the inevitable day that would no longer be the case. 

I speared a mushy tuft of steamed broccoli onto my fork. My hand abruptly went from steady to trembling.

All day, the pressure had been sharpening, accelerating, intensifying. I looked around the dinner table. Nobody else appeared to notice. All the tests were normal. It was my sinuses. It *had* to be my sinuses. 

Try as I might, I couldn’t buy my own story, and Mom could smell the panic burning beneath my skin.

*Are you okay? How’s your head?* 

I pointed a half-hearted thumbs-up in her direction. How could burden her with the truth?

Hadn't she suffered enough already?

*See? He’s fine. He’s strong. Quit worrying.* \- Henry signed. 

I suppressed the urge to smile. 

When I looked back at my plate, I realized Grandpa wasn’t eating. He was staring absentmindedly at the floor, head turned towards me. His glasses had slipped into his baggy T-shirt, tenting the fabric at his chest. He was muttering to himself. I couldn’t make out most of the words, and what I did catch made no sense.

“Dirty little - - - squishing around - - - tangled, tangled - - - disgusting, tiny, tangled strings” 

I did catch one phrase for certain. It was the last thing he muttered before becoming silent. 

“I see you.” 

\- - - - -

***30 seconds before they arrived****:*

As we drove through town, the cryptic pressure in my head burst unexpectedly. Reminded me of popping an inflamed zit. There was a blip of pain, yes, but it was followed by rush of blissful relief. 

I turned to Henry. He had his head leaning against the window, jaw stiff, shoulders tensed to his ears. Guess I had a big, doofy smile on my face, because he shot back a mocking look. Tongue out. Eyes crossed. I imagine he would’ve flipped me the bird if we weren’t in the car with Mom. 

He was livid. We were an hour late for his soccer game. 

Both grandpa and I can be tricky to mobilize. Did we take our meds? Do we have our necessary outside-the-house gear? Plus, we just move *slow*. It’s a miracle if we’re only fifteen minutes late for any given appointment. I wasn’t the issue that morning, though. I knew better than to be unprepared on game day. Nothing aggravates Henry more. 

No, there was something wrong with Grandpa. 

Mom told me he was feeling under the weather. He didn’t look sick, though. He looked vacant. Not his usual, diet-dementia aloofness, either. He looked like his soul had departed his body. His glasses had gone missing, too. 

And he was still muttering nonsense under his breath.

Our beat-up sedan lurched to a clunky stop at a red light. I racked my brain, coming with ways I could support Henry. 

I could make sure he stays hydrated? 

The light turned green. Our car wobbled forward. 

Or maybe I'd give him permission to lie to his teammates. Henry could tell them he was late on my account. That’d be bad for me in the short term, but it’d probably be easier for him to explain than whatever the hell was going on with Grandpa...

We came to a sudden, jagged halt. 

Old coffee cups flew from their cupholders, drenching the dashboard in stagnant brown liquid as the soggy cardboard fell apart. My seat belt became rigid, biting into my chest to keep me in place. My woozy heart thundered into back of my throat.

We’d stopped at the end of a narrow, one-way street hemmed in by two monolithic brick buildings. The right bumper was tilted down, and the tire was stuck. 

Mom turned and signed: *STAY.* She stepped out to check the damage. My body trembled, nearly convulsing from the shock.

Henry grabbed my hand. 

He dragged his thumb along the underside of my wrist, slow and steady. I felt myself becoming grounded. Outside, Mom was staring at the hood, scratching the back of her head. She peered through the window and gestured:

*Pothole? Or...sinkhole? Can’t tell. It’s very deep. Stay in the car, I’m calling the police.* 

My breathing became ragged. A deluge of adrenaline flooded through my veins. 

The pressure hadn't left me.

Suddenly, it was coming back, and it was coming back different. 

When Henry and I were young, before he was fed up with my existence, before he saw me as this loathsome, pitiable burden, we loved the arcade. It was a place where we were equal, despite my brokenness. Every afternoon, we would scour the house for quarters, hoping against hope we would find a cache of loose change between some couch cushions or in a pair of Grandpa’s pants. If we were successful, we’d celebrate by shaking handfuls of coins as if our closed fists were macarenas. 

The pressure was like *that*. 

Rapid, rhythmic clinking. 

And, God, it was pressing in on me from every direction. 

Grandpa leapt from the passenger’s seat and onto the sidewalk. He twisted around in manic circles, batting at the empty air around his legs, saliva dripping down the corner of his mouth, repeating the same word so violently that even I could tell what he was saying. 

**“WORMS.”**

**“WORMS.”**

**“WORMS.”**

Henry dug his nails into my flesh. 

Mom dropped the phone from her ear. She stood by the bumper, dumbstruck, panic setting in thick. Her head kept darting between the car and Grandpa. I didn’t understand. I pointed wildly towards Grandpa, desperate to focus her attention. In his frenzy, he was getting closer and closer to the end of the one-way. He was going to spill out onto the busy road, and then, who knows? The man was basically blind without his glasses. 

Why, God, *why* wasn’t she running to save him? 

Henry yanked my arm, trying to pull me towards him. 

I spun to look at him. His face was drained of color, paler than fog. His eyes were bulging from their sockets. Never in my life had I seen my brother more petrified, and he wasn’t looking out the front of the car; he was staring at something right outside *my* window. 

The clinking noise was deafening. It filled my broken ears and left room for nothing else. 

I couldn’t hear the slack-jawed, dead-eyed man, silently slamming his limp arms against the glass, one after the other, an endless, hypnotic barrage. 

And the glass was starting to splinter. 

I couldn’t move. It wasn’t just terror that rooted me to the seat. I was mesmerized by the vibrations under his skin. The flesh expanded. Spaghetti-thick cords would rise across every inch of his body. There was no order to their arrangement. They weren’t stationed in parallel or in a neat cross-stitch. They were a chaotic, tangled mess. A second later, the cords retracted, and his skin appeared normal. 

Expand. **Clink.** 

He threw his flaccid arm over his shoulder.

Retract. **Clink.** 

It fell like a meteor, helpless to gravity, and shattered the window. A hailstorm of glass engulfed me. He moved to lean his head into the car. 

Mom bounded into view and tackled him at the waist. 

The clinking ceased. 

The world was silent once more. 

I gripped the edge of the broken window and threw my head out. Glass dug into my palms, but I barely felt any pain. 

I needed to see that Mom was OK. 

Relief surged out of in a single, shaky breath. 

She was kneeling on the narrow sidewalk, stunned, trembling, but intact. What was left of the man lay in front of her. 

He wasn’t dead. Dead isn’t the right word. 

The man shattered like a ceramic pot. 

The collision had tossed him into the brick wall of the nearby building, and the impact had broken him into two large pieces - one from the chest-up, the other from the waist-down. Dozens of other, smaller pieces were scattered around him: thin, rattling shards of dry human pottery. 

He was empty on the inside. No guts, no blood, no heart: nothing at all. 

The worms had hollowed him out. 

Mom turned, looked me in the eyes, and shot me a weak, world-weary smile. Somehow, she knew. If she stayed still, she could buy us time. She could make damn sure we got away. 

Her hands reached up to sign. 

The man’s shattered body seized. The clinking resumed with a hellish ferocity.

I couldn’t see them, but I could hear them, I could track their movements, getting closer, and closer, and closer to my Mom. Henry was behind me, reaching over my shoulder, stretching his hand out to pull her in, to keep her safe. 

I pushed him back. 

The clinking was upon her. She screamed, I think. Her mouth grew wide, her jaw became slack. They were infiltrating her. Hollowing her body until there was nothing left. 

Enough of her lingered to sign six final words. 

*Take care of your brother, Felix.* 

Her fingers contorted into a bevy of unnatural, inhuman shapes. Her body went limp. 

Then, she began to pulse. 

Expand. **Clink.** 

Retract. **Clink.** 

For maybe the first time in our lives, Henry followed my lead. 

I shoved him out of the far door. 

He put his arm around me, and we left.

I don’t know for sure that Grandpa’s dead, but I hope he is. 

Because if his hearts still beating, that means he’s either alone, scared, and confused, 

or hollowed out and somehow still alive. 

\- - - - -

For now, it seems like we're safe. 

I was able to guide us out of town, avoiding the worms like landmines. They seem to cluster together and wait for victims, hiding in plain sight, but the only time they stop moving appears to be right before they leave or enter a host. Otherwise, they're always moving, which means I can hear them.

We passed by hundreds of tire-sized holes in the ground. I threw a quarter down one of them. Henry said he never heard it hit the bottom. 

I don’t know why they’ve awakened from their dormancy deep within the earth, but I suppose it doesn’t matter. They’re here now. 

These things are a living paradox. 

Only the blind can see them.

Only the deaf can hear them. 

Nests of them writhed across my town's streets, through layers of salt deposited for a snowstorm that never came. They clinked up a storm - twisting and squirming and tangling in on themselves - but the salt never shifted. Indirect detection doesn't seem like a viable strategy. 

Want my advice? 

Hold your differently abled neighbors near and dear. 

Don’t have any?

That’s alright. 

From my perspective, you have two options.

You *could* roll the dice. Maybe this *isn’t* the beginning of some sort of worldwide annexation of the human race. Maybe my town was just very, very unlucky. 

But if you’d like to err on the safe side, might I recommend a screwdriver?

I mean, most people have a screwdriver. 

A screwdriver should be able to do the trick, no matter which way you take it. 

Blind or deaf, dealer's choice.

And if the broken are the only ones truly equipped to survive this, 

sooner or later, 

we may have to shift our perspective,

on what it means

to[ be broken. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/unalloyedsainttrina/comments/1j88zl3/welcome_to_a_very_chaotic_horror_subredditupdated/)
