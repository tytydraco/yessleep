The shadows move. I've been seeing them thicken and thin and take shape since I was a toddler.

My parents always called me "peculiar"; in the sense of they didn't believe me. First it was that I needed glasses or I had some sort of mental illness, but all the exams came back negative. On paper, I supposedly have hyperphantasia, even though I clearly failed that test too.

I think that's the most frustrating thing about my current situation. I can clearly see what is definitely something from another realm casually roam around the house. I wouldn't complain if it was just one shadow. Instead, I will turn my head and see a few dozens of critters as dark as the night sky and completely immaterial staring at me from corners, the ceiling or even behind a family member.

I'm not afraid of them, or at least I wasn't until a few days ago. You see, after almost two decades of inhuman eyes - I doubt they even qualify as eyes - following you, you start recognising faces, and dare I say intentions.

For example, there's this one shadow who passed through my bedroom door every night for three years when I was a teen. He was one of the most "tightly-stitched-together" shadows I've seen. His body was lean and mostly human like, except his head was deer shaped, twice the size and with two large antlers poking from it. He didn't really do anything, just... Kind of checked up on me.

Then, one night I had a dream of being chased. I don't remember by who or what, but in that dream the deer-man stepped in, and after I woke up I never saw him again.

The above doesn't mean the shadows are "good" per se; not at all. There are heads moving in my peripheral vision at all times, tendrils and tentacles of dark goo run up the stairs in broad daylight and something like a cat-goat hybrid hanging upside-down from the ceiling right above my bed for the past year and and a half, and I'm just waiting for it to fall on me - I'm positive it will.

It's been maybe a week since that stupid thing has stopped vanishing. It has a bull-like head, only there are no horns or nose. Instead, the only thing decorating its face aside from its eyes is a crescent smile - at all times. I would call it "long-lengs" but even that's an understatement; its four limbs are noodle-like, and it runs how a dog would - only in the speed of a cheetah in its prime, ready to pounce on the prey. In that case, me.

It constantly runs up the stairs, no matter the time of day. It constantly peaks inside by bedroom from the hall, either standing on its back legs and leaning to the side or on all fours and tilting its head like badly-made animation. It's so active, I haven't seen another critter since it's appeared.

The breaking point has come up in the past five hours. I had gone on a date with my best friend, Suza, and while she dropped me off at home, she squeezed my hand tightly.

Suza is "peculiar" like me. With both of us being half-ostracized from a young age, we found solace in eachother. She, essentially, predicts life-altering events, usually involving hospitals or death.

Back to what happened, she grabbed my hand and made me swear not to leave my room at all once I entered. Safe to say, I grabbed the salt from the kitchen and a cross on my way up. Don't ask me on religion - with the things I've seen, I refuse to discuss with anyone but God.

For these past four hours, everything'd been smooth sailing. Then, my brother settled on his bed opposite of mine - we share the room - and the hallway lamps went off. My sense of logic screamed to close the door, but instead I grabbed a flashlight - and I saw it. "Long Legs" had passed the doorframe and was standing on its hind legs, staring directly at me.

I could finally see... Everything about it, really. Its height, its anatomy, each and every thought it could form behind that never-ceasing smile. A lump was rising in my throat, and fast.

But I couldn't move. The salt, the cross and a knife I've always had on my desk were only a few feet away. But I was frozen. I just stood there and stared at it, and it did the same.

The half hour my clock said we stood there, at arm's reach of eachother, didn't feel so short. I would swear it was hours, maybe even days and the sun just hadn't risen - I wouldn't put time manipulation past its capabilities. When it finally left, it stepped back and disappeared down the hallway.

I just started crying, right then and there, dropping the flashlight before shutting the door.

I'm currently backed up against the door writing this. The internet is timeless, and even if something happened to me, someone will know. It hasn't left, I can feel it around somewhere.
