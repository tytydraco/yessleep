Now, here is the latest part...

Seven souls, consumed by the machinations of the night, have returned corrupted by their death. Full of anger and rage, consumed by their hate in life, they are unable to be swallowed by the mouths of the cemetery. Instead they have been spat out to collect for a debt that will never be paid in full.

Isaac, Kyle, and I met with Eli for lunch to discuss the return of the contractor and about previous victims that had returned as the wandering dead.

“Other than that contractor that recently joined their ranks, you have The Gordy Twins, Madam Dubois, Captain Iche, Teddy the Gun, and Mr. Weber. Each one had found their way into the cemetery one night and the cemetery decided that the evil they possessed would be best suited as a vessel to consume more souls,” Eli explained stroking the hairs of the beard he had grown since his retirement.

“What is it that those people had done that they are able to still be around today? Why is it that those names don’t sound familiar at all?” I asked glancing at Kyle and Isaac for any look of familiarity.

“Well, I do know about The Gordy Twins,” Isaac said before taking a sip of coffee. “They had been notorious train robbers back in the late 1800s. They had been tracked to our town and decided to hide out in the cemetery to avoid the law. The law never caught up with them but the cemetery sure did.”

“And Madam Dubois had been a French whore that prowled the town in the early 1900s that would kill anyone that paid for her services. She too was hiding in the cemetery when she was killed but it was due to the women of the town growing angry that she had decided to blackmail them for hiring her to kill their unfaithful husbands,” Kyle said before taking a bite out of a greasy burger.

“And the others?” I asked slightly annoyed that I had never heard of these people before or noticed them in the cemetery before.

“Well, Captain Iche was a former naval captain that turned to moonshining. After a bad batch of moonshine poisoned half of his town down in Tennessee he made tracks up to our town. A chance encounter in the cemetery confined him within it forever and Teddy the Gun was a highway robber that died in a similar way as The Twins,” Eli said, sitting back and pushing his empty plate forward.

“And Mr. Weber?”

“You see, Mrs. Weber had married the wrong man. She was a starry eyed girl with dreams of a bigger life. She didn’t have the acting chops to make it Hollywood like she planned and found herself back in her hometown. Mr. Weber was charming enough and said the right things, but most importantly of all he was wealthy. Mrs. Weber married him for his money and everyone in town knew it, it was also well known that she fancied a Cherokee boy that worked for her husband. When Mr. Weber discovered her infidelity; he chased after the two with an axe in hand. He lost his wife but saw the Cherokee boy hop the fence into the cemetery, and followed him inside. While the boy kept silent, knowing the talk surrounding the cemetery, Mr. Weber was too full of rage to keep quiet.” Eli finished his story, waiting for my next question.

“Why is it that I’ve never seen any of these other people?” I asked just as Eli anticipated.

“I’m sure you’ve seen them plenty, they just don’t resemble anything human anymore.” Eli answered. “The Twins tend to take shape as balls of liquid fire and feathers with tar covered branches. Madam Dubois now looks like a mossy succubus, while Captain Iche looks like a burning wendigo. Teddy is now some sort of tree-rock snake and Mr. Weber has become what I can best describe as a spider made of hate and violence wrapped up in rust and broken mirrors.”

“So the most violent spirits aside from probably Regent are all victims of the cemetery,” Kyle stated, setting the last of his burger on his plate, appetite lost for the moment.

“Correct” Eli retorted, placing money on the table to cover our meal.

“Why isn’t Regent considered one of those seven?” Isaac asked as the waitress collected the money with a smile, brushing her hair over her unsightly scar.

“Probably because he wasn’t killed by the cemetery, just killed next to the cemetery. It would sorta explain why he has such limited appearances.” I pondered out loud.

“That would be my assumption as well. To be honest it is hard to pin down much of why anything happens in that cemetery,” Eli finished before excusing himself.

We parted ways and I wished Kyle an easy night with Thomas. Isaac told me he needed to go lie down. He had been visibly shaking at the description of what Mr. Weber had become. I waved him off before strolling down the street lost in thought.

I have seen hundreds of different spirits over the years. Very few were interested in telling their life stories and even less seemed to be even remotely friendly.

Mad Michael had in fact never told me one thing about his life before death and although he gave plenty of vague and auspicious predictions he was overall a pleasant presence to have accompany you throughout the night.

I wanted to know more about the residents of the cemetery but my searching of the gravestones with Thomas had proven fruitless. We couldn’t even find the grave of Mrs. McCarthy.

The more I tried to learn about the otherworldly presence of the cemetery, the more it appeared that I would never find answers.

There was an air of discomfort about trying to learn more. The Town itself did not want its secrets to be unearthed.

It was probably why the town as a whole was so fortunate for the citizens that didn’t pry. It kept the town sedated and comfortable and unwilling to question the uncanny.

I had heard plenty of tales of people disappearing under unusual circumstances and time and time again nothing really ever came out of it.

People went missing.

People Died.

That was the way of my small world.

I was left with a thought echoing in my mind for the rest of the day.

Would I be one of the people that went missing, or would I grow old and die and then be buried in my local cemetery
