For over a decade I have been losing sleep because of a demonic entity who has been raping me and sucking the life out of me. It wasn't until recently that I started putting all the clues together.

Not long ago, I picked up a new hobby to fill up wasted time. I suffer from Major Depressive Disorder so I spent the majority of my days going to work, going home, surfing the internet, and sleeping. Then I started studying true crime to give myself something to do. I even bought one of those murder mystery games that they send straight to your house. Of course, amid this new hobby, I would learn more about the most notorious Serial Killers. 

I didn't really know much about them. I was a sheltered child, raised in a Christian home. The only one I knew about was Ted Bundy. Besides the names and the fact that they killed people, the rest were news to me. So when I saw *his* face I nearly vomited. 

[I will refrain from mentioning who *he* is because a few days ago the bastard threatened to kill me if I ever told anyone his name.]

I had seen him before. His eyes were the ones I saw when I closed my own. When I couldn't move. When I couldn't breathe. Those eyes were looking down on me. Black. Deadly. Laughing. 

I could feel my heart pounding against my chest. 

*That's him!*

I felt myself losing my grip on consciousness. My mind raced in a panic-induced state of confusion. I was staring into the face of the monster who did what he wanted with me while I was unable to move or even scream for help. 

I had let my psychiatrist make me believe that the entity was a hallucination induced by sleep deprivation. Everyone was calling it Sleep Paralysis. Now, looking into the eyes of the same creature, I knew it was something beyond any form of scientific understanding. 

It wasn't just his eyes. 

The more I read about this monster. The more confident I was that he was the one infiltrating my sleep and ruining my life. Multiple different elements pointed to him. Symbolism, scents, misplaced imagery. I would tell you the details, but I'm afraid saying too much would be too risky. He's aggressive and incredibly dangerous. This makes telling my story much more stressful, but I'm still going to try my best.

It pains me even more now to think back on all the times he suffocated me, touched me, clawed my stomach and my back, and used me as his fix. 

I was so close to vomiting. 

I could already imagine his satanic eyes gleaming with the entertainment of knowing I had discovered who he is... Or who he was. Being long dead, he is something else entirely now. Something far more powerful. He is now capable of ruining lives even more than he had before. He relishes in torture and sitting back while his victims deteriorate slowly. Year by year. Hour by hour. 

That's what he is doing to me. I have not experienced what other people have experienced. I don't know real happiness because my relationships have been robbed from me. Everyone close to me leaves eventually. I have never been in a romantic relationship. I used to think it was because I was somehow undesirable until he whispered in my ear, "They leave because you're mine." 

I can't even keep a job. I am always so tired and so defeated that I eventually end up fired. I try picking up new routines, cleaning more often, working out, eating a healthier diet. Usually, I end up with so little energy that I slowly revert to my old habits. Last night, he let me talk for a moment. I told him to stop doing this to me. He just shrugged and said "Can't. You'll gain confidence." 

I don't know what I am going to do now. I used to be able to distract myself during the day. Now that I know who he is and that he's been the cause of the decay in my life, I can't get this guy out of my head, ever. He is a nightmare, haunting me with my eyes open and shut. I did some research about Incubi because that was the closest thing I could find that resembled my experience. Apparently, even priests can't do anything about these types of demons, because they don't possess their victims. They just feed off of them while they sleep.

I found out that the incubus will go away if you tell someone else their name. Supposedly, that gives you power over them. The problem is, he said he'd kill me if I do. I don't want to risk death in my sleep by making that decision. 

I left a couple of clues as to who the Incubus is, but they are very subtle. Please, do not type his name in the comments if you figure it out. 

I'm begging you not to!

I'm not asleep now, but I can practically feel his claws teasing my neck, waiting for someone to find out who he is and say his name.

I'm only posting this now because I need someone to help me figure out what to do about him without saying his name. I have never heard of anyone else being visited by a dead Serial Killer in their sleep before.

If there is anyone here who knows anything about this, Please respond as soon as possible.
