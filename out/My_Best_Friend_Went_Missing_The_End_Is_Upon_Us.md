Me and Jayden quietly sat in the room. It was very empty aside from a couple desks and some chairs. The room was probably for data storage as the walls were lined with cabinets overflowing with papers.  
A couple minutes passed and nothing had changed, I was being a coward...Again. I remembered how the events that night played out... My father valiantly protected me as I sat and watched his end. 

"Hey- Travis" Jayden whispered.

"What". I responded in a dull tone.

"We can't just sit here". He protested.

"Why not". I asked.

"Your friend is literally possessed or something and you're just gonna watch everything unfold"? Jayden remarked.

"What am I gonna do"? I asked, now annoyed.

"Do you know anything that has powers like this? Maybe we can try finding some weakness to stop him from being possessed"? Jayden asked.

"But we don't know-" I was interrupted by a roar echoing off the hallways.

"We need to go, NOW". Jayden said with urgency.

We both got up and quickly left the room to see chaos unfolding before us...

We both saw many creatures running past us and chasing scientists and we watched as the building seemed to be collapsing. We both took a left and I was pounced on by a wendigo.

"Wait"! I Yelled and to my luck, it hesitated.

Jayden slammed a large gas can over the wendigo's skull, knocking it out.

"Thanks-" I went to say but then a large worm almost rammed into us and ate the wendigo that was laying before us.

Without talking, we continued running away from the chaos. 

We eventually made it into an empty hallway and decided to take a break from running.

"I don't think we can stop this". I sighed.

"But-" Jayden protested but I cut him off.

"We can't take down any of these things on our own, the wendigo was pure luck". I said.

"Maybe I can help". Someone said from behind.

I looked in shock to see my father along with a figure hidden behind a tattered cloak.

"D-Dad"?! I asked, in complete shock.

Suddenly I thought of the chance of an illusion and took a step back.

"Wait...How can I know your..you". I asked hesitantly.

"You watch old cartoons for some reason". He said bluntly.

I was shocked.

"How- How are you alive"?! I asked.

"It doesn't matter right now, We need to stop this mess". The cloaked figure said.

"Who are you supposed to be". Jayden asked.

The cloaked figure took off his cloak and revealed himself. He was a wendigo.

"I am Axel, A detective who deals with stuff like this. I'm here to restore peace". He stated.

"Me and Axel have been searching for you all ever since that helicopter took you away". My father explained.

"None of this matters though, we can't stop this breach and we can't stop Rebecca". I said, defeated.

"I doubt that". Axel said. "We just need to kill Rebecca and we get rid of the big problem, then we just gotta deal with the breach after". He finished.

"But what about-" I went to say but was cut off by another loud roar that was much closer.

"He's here"! Jayden yelled.

We all watched as Darius walked into the hallway we were in with Rebecca not far behind along with a mysterious figure in the front.

"What the hell". My father said in shock.

I saw who the figure was now...

"B-Bryson"?!! I yelled in horror.

Bryson was floating through the air, covered in charred flesh, he had a wide smile on his face.

"Hello again, Travis. It's been so long since we saw eachother". Bryson said.

"How...How are you here?! You died"! I Screamed at him.

"I did die, You and Darius didn't save me in time...But the Pilgrim wasn't done with me. He knew I had potential, he knew that my death was not to be in vain, so he brought me back and gave me knowledge of everything. I knew what I needed to do to save this world. We found Darius and the pilgrim was able to successfully possess him as he was the Pilgrim's killer. We will stop the tyranny of this wretched land and restore the world to what it once was". He rambled.

"The pilgrim is lying to you! He's just using you for his own ends! Bryson, please! Don't side with the real enemy here"! I protested.

"I think it's time we end this". Darius sneered, a wide, rabid smile forming on his face.

"Indeed". Rebecca said.

They charged and we immediately prepared for what was next.

Axel pulled out a pistol and started firing at Darius but to no avail, the bullets seemed to bounce off of him. My dad grabbed a duffel bag and handed us each an assault rifle.

As the battle took place, I charged forward and shot a couple bullets at Rebecca. She was able to dodge most of them by luck but one of the bullets grazed her cheek. She responded by taking out a pistol and firing at me. I ducked behind a table and quickly returned fire and managed to get some shots off. She collapsed to the ground, writhing in pain. Bryson saw this and quickly turned to me and shot dark tentacles in my direction. While he was distracted attacking me, My father and Axel fired at Bryson's back and managed to land in some good blows.

"You cannot defeat us" Bryson yelled in hysteria and shot many tentacles in all directions, Grabbing Me, Axel, and my father. Jayden who was busy trying to talk to Darius but to no avail, was slammed into a wall and was struggling to remain conscious. He aimed his assault rifle at Bryson and shot him right in his neck.

Bryson let go of us all but then rammed into Jayden and held him by his neck in the air.

While Axel and my father went to help Jayden. I was stopped by Darius charging towards me.

I was able to barely dodge his claws as he rammed into the wall to my left.

"Darius- snap out of it"! I yelled to him but he didn't listen and immediately slashed at me again but I was able to barrel roll out of the way. 

"Please"! I yelled to him but was once again ignored. I was cornered and he slammed his claws into me, leaving many cuts on my chest. He picked me up and showed me his large array of teeth.

"Darius..." I said, struggling to escape his grasp.

He drew me closer to his gaping maw and I tried one more time.

"Darius, Snap Out Of It"! I yelled directly to his face and I hugged him as hard as I could.

At that moment, my life flashed before my eyes. I shut my eyes and thought of a while back when Darius was normal. It felt so long ago...So, so long ago...  


&#x200B;

"Hey, are you ok Travis"? Darius asked, concerned.

"I...I just didn't expect him to leave us". I said grimly.

"I know his scent, we can look for him". He suggested.

"Not with all these guards around, especially Kyle, keeping track of us". I said in monotone.

"Hey, I heard Bryson mention you had some kind of communication with other people, how did you do that, are you telepathic"? He asked.

"No, I have an online account called (Redacted), You can use it as well if you want" I said.

"But anyway... I don't think we can search for Bryson and I doubt he wants us to look for him". I said grimly.

"Well, we have each other atleast". He said and suddenly hugged me.

"Ack- Darius you're going to crush me"! I said as he let go of me.

He laughed with a deep tone.  


  
His laughter rang through my ears as I waited for the end to come....

But it never did.  


I felt myself drop to the floor as Darius seemed to be having some kind of internal struggle for power. I backed away as Darius blindly clawed in front of him and eventually started attacking himself.

I watched in shock as the scene unfolded but suddenly I heard a scream from my right. I turned to see Jayden being strangled, now looking a deep shade of blue, as My father and Axel were also being restrained and were forced to watch Jayden slowly running out of time. I went to run towards them to help but I had been wounded and I watched in horror as Darius seemed to be losing the battle.

"Darius you need to help Jayden"! I pleaded.

Darius seemed to be having some kind of seizure and I was too weak to do anything. I gritted my teeth, biting my lip. I fought through the pain and started walking towards Darius. The pilgrim seemed to sense me and tried to lash out but Darius was doing his best to restrain himself. I walked over with intense effort and hugged him again.

"Please, You need to wake up". I whispered to him and fell to the ground, turning pale as I started to bleed out from the wound.

Darius seemed to break out of whatever the Pilgrim had done to him and rushed to help Jayden.

"What are you doing-" Bryson was caught off guard by Darius and was slammed into the wall, fatally injured. Everyone was set free from the tentacles and Darius then rushed back to make sure I was ok.

"Travis"! He yelled and quickly applied pressure onto the wound.

"I did this, didn't I...? I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to-" Darius went to say but I cut him off.

"It's fine...I'll make it". I smiled but the moment of peace was quickly fading as Bryson got up and ran towards us all, tentacles ready to attack.

Darius picked me up and quickly dodged out of the way of the tentacles. My father was shielded by Axel and Jayden managed to shoot the tentacles rushing towards him. Axel took out his gun and also started firing but then he heard a familiar click, He was out of ammo. Everyone was almost out of ammo and we were slowly being overwhelmed by Bryson's tentacles.

The tentacles slowly got closer and closer and it finally looked like...the end.  


  


A large bang rang out the wall Bryson was near- collapsed and many cryptids ran through and quickly overwhelmed the hallway.

Bryson was lost in the rubble and it was time to leave.

I looked back, What if there was a way to save Bryson. What if- ... My thoughts were cut short from Bryson exploding out of the rubble in a cacophony of tentacles. He charged towards us and Despite Darius carrying almost all of us and still being very fast, it wasn't enough. We didn't have enough fire-power. We made our way through hallway after hallway, Bryson slowly closing in as we eventually saw a familiar exit sign. We slammed through the door and continued making distance from the building. We saw helicopters from above, racing towards the facility. We quickly managed to reach the forest and we stopped to take a break.

&#x200B;

Darius sat down under a tree and immediately fell asleep from exhaustion and Axel was badly hurt. My father tended to my wounds and Jayden was being a look-out.

"Dad..." I started.

"Whats up, Travis"? He asked.

"I'm sorry. If I just listened, none of this would have happened". I said grimly.

"You have nothing to be sorry about ,Travis. This was all my fault. I should never have done the mission in the first place, I was taking care of you and I put the mission before your needs". He said.

"How did you survive the spiders"? I asked.

"It's a long story, I'll tell you about it sometime". He winked.

We were able to reach a nearby town and get some medical help. As we were being taken care of, A helicopter landed nearby and a couple agents walked towards us.

"What are you doing here" My father asked.

"We have come for some news and some questions about-". The agent was cut off.

"We don't care about your-" I went to say but the other agent cut me off.

"First off, Your father is fired. Second, The agreement paper you have has not been submitted and therefore will become-" I cut off the second agent.

"Here". I said, handing them a piece of paper in my pocket.

They look surprised but took the paper.

"Fine". The first agent said.

"We would also like our..."Property" back". The second agent said, motioning to Darius.

I took out my gun and so did Jayden and My Father.

"No". I said coldly.

They took out their weapons but we already had the upper hand. We shot them down and quickly saw that more helicopters were approaching.

It's been about 2 weeks since then, We are on the run and I managed to find a library with computers where I can post again. I think it's safe to say they aren't going to find us anytime soon since they have a facility to rebuild after they decided to bomb the whole thing.

It's been a crazy ride and I just wanna say thanks to those who helped. Darius sends his regards and he doesn't want to post anymore since the time gap messed things up and he's too lazy to recap everything as well as the fact that anyone would be creeped out and call the police if he even went out in public.

Jayden returned to his family and Axel has more detective work to do. It's just me, my dad and Darius now. We are currently hiding out in a run-down farm. I'm pretty sure its safe to say...

This is... The End.
