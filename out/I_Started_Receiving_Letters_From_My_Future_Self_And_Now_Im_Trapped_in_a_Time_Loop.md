 I Started Receiving Letters From My Future Self... And Now I'm Trapped in a Time Loop"

\[PART 1: THE FIRST LETTER\]

It arrived on my 25th birthday. A plain white envelope with no stamp, no return address—just my name written in *my* handwriting, but sharper, darker, like the pen had been pressed too hard.

Inside was a single sheet of paper with three words:

"DON'T TRUST BEN."

My boyfriend Ben laughed when I showed him. "Babe, someone's messing with you."

But then I flipped the page over.

There, in tiny, frantic script, was a date: *October 18th, 2025*—exactly one year from today.

And beneath it:

"If you don't listen, you'll die like I did."

\[PART 2: THE SECOND LETTER\]

The next one came a week later. Slipped under my door while I was sleeping.

This time, it was longer.

*"You think this is a joke. I know because I thought so too. Here's proof: you still have the scar on your left knee from when you fell biking at 12. You whisper 'please don't be bad' before checking your bank account. And right now, Ben is texting his ex—the one he told you he blocked."*

My blood went cold.

No one knew those things. *No one.*

I checked Ben's phone that night.

He *was* texting his ex.

\[PART 3: THE PHOTO\]

The third delivery wasn't a letter.

It was a Polaroid, left on my car windshield.

In it, *I* was staring at the camera, eyes wide with terror, mouth open in a scream. Behind me was a shadowy figure holding a knife.

The date scrawled on the bottom?

*Tomorrow.*

\[PART 4: THE LOOP BEGINS\]

I called the police. They said there was nothing they could do without evidence.

I stayed at a friend's house. Barricaded the door.

Midnight hit.

Then—

*Knock knock knock.*

The Polaroid slid under the door.

*The same photo.*

But this time... *I was holding the knife.*

And the figure behind me?

It was *Ben*.

\[PART 5: THE TRUTH\]

The letters kept coming. Each one more desperate.

*"You've tried running 7 times. It doesn't work."*

*"The loop resets at midnight."*

*"Only one of us can survive."*

Last night, I finally wrote back.

I left the note where the letters always appeared.

This morning, I got my reply:

A single word, smeared in something red:

"RUN."

\[FINAL UPDATE\]

It's 11:58 PM.

Ben is knocking on the door.

He's crying, saying he loves me, that he'd never hurt me.

But the letters warned me about this.

*"He lies to get inside."*

*"He always kills you at midnight."*

*"You have to kill him first."*

The knife is in my hand.

The clock is ticking.

And the last letter just fluttered under the door:

"THIS IS YOUR 13TH LOOP. MAKE IT COUNT."

FINAL FINAL UPDATE: "I BROKE THE LOOP"

I didn't stab him.

Instead, I did what none of the other versions of me ever tried—I *opened the door and hugged him*.

Ben sobbed into my shoulder. "I've been getting letters too," he choked out. "They said *you* were going to kill *me*."

The knife clattered to the floor as the clock struck midnight.

The apartment lights flickered.

For one second, I saw *them*—hundreds of translucent versions of us, frozen in different moments of the same horrible night. Some with knives. Some bleeding. Some already dead.

Then the air *cracked* like broken glass.

All the letters burst into blue flames at once.

When the smoke cleared, there was just one final note on the ashes:

"YOU CHOSE DIFFERENTLY. THE LOOP IS BROKEN."

EPILOGUE (6 MONTHS LATER)

We found the shoebox in the attic last week.

Dozens of unsent letters in our handwriting.

Each one begging past versions of ourselves:

*"PLEASE JUST TRUST EACH OTHER."*

Ben proposed yesterday.

I said yes.
