There is a bald man living inside my house. He likes to hide.

He has been here since my first day at the house, and I know for a fact that he was here long before I arrived—technically making me his guest, and not the other way around. Let me explain.

The house belonged to my grandparents on my mother's side. My grandfather died a couple of years back, and not long after that, my grandmother got hit with a nasty case of the 'mentia, so she was put in a home. Their house is located on a pretty nice side of town, and conveniently close to my workplace. So, when I got the job, I floated a cheeky proposal to my mother and her siblings, who technically owned it. That's how I ended up scoring the keys.

Now, regarding the man. I don’t know why he’s here, and I don’t know how long he’s been here. You have to understand: my mother’s side of the family isn’t exactly what you’d call typical. I've never met my grandmother, but rumour has it... she was some kind of witch. I know how ridiculous this sounds, trust me.

But my mother tells me that growing up, it wasn’t uncommon to see strange people around the house. They’d show up looking like stepped-on puppies—sorrowful, like the weight of the world was hanging heavy on their shoulders. Then, they would proceed to step into my grandmother’s room, closing the doors behind them, and next she’d do something for them. Usually, that involved chanting or burning some kind of foul-smelling grass, and crying. Lots of crying. Following that, more often than not, they would then come out looking like different people—rejuvenated, like they’d found the answer to whatever was crushing them.

Sometimes, though, that wasn’t the case. According to my mom, by her count, my grandma estimated she’d been cursed a couple hundred times. She would sometimes wake to find dead frogs with their mouths sewn shut on her doorstep. Other times, she’d find bizarre symbols painted in blood on her garage door. This wasn't something my grandmother lost sleep over, apparently it came with the job.

Knowing that, my guess is that the bald man is the result of one of those curses. And now I am stuck with it.

The idea of someone you don't know living and roaming around in your house probably doesn't sound all that appealing—and that's because it isn't. But honestly, it's actually not that bad.

The first time I saw him, I had just finished putting away all of my stuff. It was my very first day on the property. I did not have all that much to tidy up since the house was already mostly put together, but I was starving.

I walked into the kitchen and...well, I saw him.

At first, I could only make out the top of his bald head peeking over the counter. A dome of spotty, unhealthy-looking skin crested over the wood. I froze. I wasn't prepared for something like that, obviously. I could see his head bobbing quietly, as if he couldn't contain himself—the mounting enthusiasm of getting a jump on me too great to bear, threatening to spill over. He almost seemed like he was giggling, but no sound escaped the man.

I grabbed a knife from my side of the counter and crept around it, trying to stay quiet, my heart pounding against my ribcage.

I saw him as soon as I turned the corner. He was small in stature and looked to be in his late fifties. He was fully naked, and slightly overweight. He wasn't completely bald as I'd expected - his head ringed with hair on the sides like a monk. He looked sickly, his skin patchy, covered in moles and bearing a slight yellow tint. His face was... hard to describe; he just looked normal. Just your average Joe. And it's hard to pinpoint his expression aptly, but the best way I have found to describe it is benevolent.

Even as I turned the corner and yelled at him, he didn't look monstrous.

He laughed noiselessly and ran off—a sack of jiggly saggy skin and flesh skittering away. As soon as he crossed into the living room, he disappeared.

That night, I made a full round of the house four or five times, but found not a single trace of him. I then proceeded to lock all of the windows and doors and slipped into bed. I tried to sleep it off, not before pleading with the divine sources I believed in—and those I did not— that I hadn't just locked the man inside with me.

The following day I called my mother, hoping for an explanation.

I tiptoed around the subject for a bit, feeling like a kid, shamefully telling his mommy that there were monsters under the bed. Finally, I got around to it and told her everything that had transpired the previous night. I was half-expecting her to laugh it off or reprimand me for being drunk and scared like a little boy, but to my surprise, that's not what she did.

"Oh," she said, a hint of recognition in her voice "that thing."

"What do you mean 'oh'?" I asked, angrily "You knew about it and still let me stay in this goddamn house?"

There was a long pause followed by a sheepish little laugh. "Oops, sorry about that, kiddo. It's just that grandma talked about a lot of weird stuff. And it only got worse when your grandfather died. We figured she was just imagining things to deal with the loneliness. She was already pretty loopy and we'd gotten used to weird stuff gravitating towards her."

She continued. "When I was a kid, we had birds falling out of the sky and into our lawn for a week. When I asked your grandmother about it, do you know what she said to me?"

"No."

"She said: 'Maybe they're just tired,'" my mother laughed. "Can you believe that?"

"Fucking hell," I blurted out, feeling exasperated. "All that aside, do you know if I am in any danger? Is this thing going to hurt me?"

"Watch your mouth, boy," she scolded. "Secondly, no. I don't think so. Grandma never mentioned to be in any danger whenever she talked about the little boy."

"The little boy?" I asked, confused.

"Yup. That's what she called it... him... whatever. She referred to him as the little boy in the body of a man. And—he just liked to play games."

I did say my family was not typical.

I just hadn't expected it to be this batshit insane.

Later that same day, when I got back from the store I felt something... off in the atmosphere.  
Something moved somewhere in the house—a presence other than my own.

I sensed him.

As I set the groceries down, there was a slight creak upstairs, a shift in weight on the floorboard. It was coming from the guest bedroom.

I tensed up. A cold had settled in my stomach and had begun to creep into my chest as I moved towards the staircase. Climbing slowly, I attempted to disguise my movement and not make my position known.

I kept reminding myself of the phone call and trying to still my panicked mind. It did not work. Maybe this creature never hurt my grandmother, but there was nothing to assure me that the non-aggression pact extended to family.

He liked to play games, she said.

Well, I sure as shit wasn't feeling very playful at that time.

I reached the end of the staircase and turned to my right, heading for the source of the noise. I put my hand on the doorframe, breathing heavily, clawing to control the cold, hard fright that had dominated my senses. I pushed it open.

The man was kneeling on the floor next to the window, his arms retracted to his chest and hands balled up into fists in clear excitement. He resembled a child. I understood what my grandmother had meant by calling him that. He bore a stupid grin on his face and yelped with glee when he saw me, no sound escaping his lips.

I took a step inside and that is when he leapt, running towards me, towards the door. I screamed in horror and pushed myself to the side of the room.

He flew by me—in his wake a gust of air carrying the sickly and sour odour of sweat hit me like a wave, my nose hairs burning with the scent. As soon as he crossed the threshold into the hallway, he vanished. Just as he had the previous night. Again I made a full sweep of the house and found nothing.

Now, I know this sounds insane. And I know that any reasonable person would've just packed up and left; maybe not without considering the gasoline and matches, scorched-earth solution. I did not, in fact, do that.

Again, maybe genetics or the way I was brought up fucked up the wiring in my brain responsible for sensible decisions. Maybe I just really liked the house and the short commute. Anyways, I stuck around. And as I've said before, it wasn't really all that bothersome, it just grew into a part of my everyday routine. Even better than that, after a couple of days of encounters, I started recognizing a pattern.

The little boy had a fixed weekly schedule.

Friday—like my first day at the house—he'd hide next to the counter on the kitchen.  
Saturday, it was the guest bedroom, usually at the exact same place I mentioned.  
Sunday, I'd find him lying down on the floor next to the couch on the living room.  
Monday was pantry day, the first one almost killing me via heart attack.  
Tuesday, in the basement, staring at the washer.  
Wednesday, in the bathroom upstairs, next to the sink.  
Thursday, the bathroom downstairs, sitting on the toilet lid.

There was only one place he never went: my bedroom. At least the manchild creature had some boundaries. I'm joking, obviously.

He never broke schedule, always followed the pattern and usually stuck by the same positions and locations in the rooms of the house. Even his reactions to being found seemed scripted. He never spoke nor emitted any noise of any kind. More than once, I tried communicating with him, but he just followed his usual path. That didn't really bother me, I'd had shut-in roommates before.

His appearance seemed to be triggered by two events: Me leaving the house and returning; or nightfall if I hadn't left the house at all on that particular day. I learned about that last one the hard way.

It was a Wednesday afternoon and I hadn't seen the man at all that day. I assumed he just wouldn't show up if I didn't leave the house. Me, being the unintelligent sack of stupid meat, shit and piss that I am, decided to take a shower.

You've probably figured out how this plays out.

Again—Wednesday.

I closed my eyes to rinse out the shampoo from my hair, and that's when I heard him. Or maybe I smelled him first, can't remember. Anyhow, it jolted me back into that familiar state of panic. I opened my eyes and stared at his outline, visible through the shower curtain. He was hunched over beside the sink. I pulled the curtain back and there he was. Same foolish grin he always had. Rows of putrid-looking, rotten teeth filled his mouth. We must've looked like two naked idiots staring at one another - one, tremendously giddy at the sight of the other; the feeling not reciprocated. I yelled. He ran, disappearing into the hallway.

After that, I tested it. Over the next few days, I confirmed it: even if I stayed home all day, he'd still show up. Always at nightfall.

Life went on, we followed our routine. I guess in that regard, he and I are pretty similar. Creatures of habit. It's been close to eight months, now. There have been no recorded accidents. If I had someone coming over, I would make sure to leave the house that day so I'd have the chance to find the bald man and scare him off his hiding place. That way ensuring there were no baldergeists traumatizing the guests.

Life was good. All went smoothly.

Until today. 

Today is Tuesday. I left for work in the morning, all normal, but ended up staying way too late finishing up some stuff. I looked at my watch as I parked the car in my neat little driveway. It was close to 9PM. The sky had fully darkened, the street illuminated only by the scattered lamps on poles. I felt desperate to get inside and sleep off the miserable, never-ending day I'd had.

 I opened the front door and made my way in. Flipped the lights. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. I placed my bag next to the door for easy pick-up tomorrow, and headed towards the basement, hoping to get it over and done with quickly. As I grasped the doorknob and turned it, I heard it. There was murmuring coming from upstairs.

I stopped. Had I made a mistake? I stared at my watch: TUE. It was Tuesday. It was basement day. He had never flipped the script on me. And that noise... *someone seemed to be talking.*

I hadn't felt this scared in months. That familiar terror began to settle in my stomach again. I flashed back to my first few days at the house. I grabbed a knife from the counter and made my way to the staircase. I ascended, slowly, making no effort to disguise it this time. As I crested the stairs, something stopped me dead in my tracks: the low, almost humming sound was coming from down the hallway, the furthest place on the first floor: my bedroom.

My throat felt dry, my extremities numb. Breathing was proving more laborious than usual. The air felt humid, hot and heavy coming in. but turning frigid as soon as it hit my lungs. The ice tightened my chest. I was panicking.

Against all of the warning signs my body gave me, I continued on. Step after step, I reached my bedroom door. Now, the sound was clearer. A muffled voice kept repeating the same words over and over again. I couldn't make them out clearly. I pushed open the door and flipped on the light. The room was empty. Except, of course, it wasn't. The voice, momentarily interrupted by my entrance, had resumed its mantra. But it was coming from under my bed. 

The air felt disgusting on my skin. Not unlike what I imagine being inside of a dog's mouth must feel like. The smell was revolting. I had grown accustomed to the bald man's foul odour, but this was too much. The room smelled vinegary and rotten. I gagged. Only the voice pulled me out of the grasp of impending vomit.

*theprinceisindanger*

It was small, higher than I had expected. A slight lisp brushed its words.

I stepped closer to the bed.

*theprinceisindanger*

I reached the foot of the bed. 

*theprinceisindanger*

I knelt. Grasping the edge of the comforter. 

*theprinceisindanger*

I pulled it back to reveal the bald man, cowering under the bed.

"THE PRINCE!" he shrieked, in his whiny, nasal voice. It sounded like *the printh*. For once, he did not smile or run away. He remained bolted in his hiding place. Terror hung on his face. He was sweating profusely, hence the smell.

"Wh— what are you doing here?" I blurted. "You are not supposed to be here."

He inched closer, moving quickly. I fell back, absolutely scared shitless.

"The prince is in danger!" he said, louder than he would've liked, because he quickly lowered his tone and repeated: "The prince is in danger."

"What do you mean, the prince is in danger? Am I the prince? How am I in danger?" 

"Yes," he began, sounding like *yeth.* "My prince, you are in danger. *He is here*."

*He?*

"Who?" I asked, a chill coursing through my body, 

He inched closer again, this time slowly. His black, beady eyes shifting from side to side before responding. "*The Sad Man is angry.*" 

"Who the fuck is th—" I began asking, but a sudden shift in the bald man's expression interrupted me. His face turning expressionless for a couple of seconds, mouth agape, eyes staring upwards.

With a quick jolt he came back, his eyes lowering to meet my own.

"It's too late, my prince," His voice came back, smaller than ever, coated with a defeated tone.

*"You forgot to close the basement door"*

His words rang out, followed by a dreadful silence that permeated the house.

And then—

Footsteps. Heavy. Fast.

**Someone was running up the basement stairs.**
