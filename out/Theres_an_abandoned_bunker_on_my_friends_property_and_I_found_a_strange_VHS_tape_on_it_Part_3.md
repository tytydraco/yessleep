It’s been two months since I last posted, so I decided I should finally update any of you who cared to read. I am going to try to recount what has happened since last time, but some of the details are hazy. I have been in a haze, but I believe I've been able to recount the events accurately.  
  
Steve died in a car accident. That is the official story, and I had no way to prove otherwise. I had considered turning in the tape as evidence to the police, but upon reexamining it I was met with the grim reality that it was blank. Whatever I saw that day was not displayed on that tape. Of course, in hindsight, the tape appeared to be displaying footage as it happened, like some sort of analog livestream.   
  
I immediately packed up the necessities, and got a hotel room in the neighboring town. I wasn’t quite ready to quit my job, so I stayed there while trying to figure out what I could about the situation I found myself in. While I had time to think, I decided to break down the facts.  
  
I found the first tape in a mysterious bunker that Steve claimed he hadn’t entered for years. It displayed footage from a nonexistent camera. Steve didn’t want to talk about it, so he clearly knew something. The second tape was delivered directly to my mailbox. When I finally decided to watch the tape, it depicted Steve’s final moments in real time.  
  
I hadn’t really had time to process the death of my best friend. I honestly am not sure if I have been able to even now. But the one thing I knew is that I needed to figure out what these things were, and if so, how to stop them. And that’s when it hit me. If I wanted answers, then I would have to go back to Steve’s house. I would have to go back to the bunker.  
  
I made the trip out to his property. I got in pretty easily, because I remembered his bad habit of leaving the backdoor unlocked. I entered the house to find it fairly well kept, and nothing initially seemed out of the ordinary. The one strange detail was the VHS player hooked up to his television in the living room, but given the circumstances, this wasn’t surprising. However, I couldn’t shake the sense of something’s eyes on me. Maybe it was just paranoia, but could you blame me after what had happened so far?  
  
After searching almost the entire house, I finally got to his room. I put my hacking skills to the test by guessing the password to his computer (It was 1234). The last thing that was left open was my first post here… I knew something had to have spurred his sudden change of tone that day. I wonder if I had never posted, maybe he would still be alive.  
  
I then turned to a journal he had left on his computer desk. From its contents, it seemed to be a pretty typical diary. But as the entries went on, things progressively got more strange. He wrote about strange dreams, some of the pages even having his own sketches depicting shadowy figures with prominent hollow eyes. Drawings of beings without form, and ramblings without coherent meaning.  
  
Suddenly I heard creaking, which I discerned to be the sound of his back door being opened from the living room. I quickly closed the book, and rushed out to the room. The door was still open, the wind howling. At the foot of the door was, unsurprisingly, a VHS tape. I walked over to it cautiously, closing the door and locking it. Then, I picked up the tape, and read what was written on it.  
  
Those Things We Fear.  
  
“Those things you fear. Those things I fear… Those things we fear,” I said aloud to myself, trying to figure out what the correlation was.  
  
What did it mean? The more information I discovered, the less any of it made sense. I held the tape, contemplating my next move. I noticed the weather outside progressing into a windy storm. The scene was being set, and it seemed like my fate was imminent. After taking a deep breath, I put the tape into the VHS player.  
  
After a moment of static, the tape began with what appeared to be an analog television. Upon closer inspection, it appeared to be the television from the bunker. The ‘camera’ then moved, as if standing up. Similar to the tape from the last entry, the point of view shown in this tape appeared to be that of someone- or something. It climbed out of the bunker, and proceeded to move throughout the forest. Then it startled moving down the trail, and I realized all too late what was happening.  
  
Whatever it was, was heading towards Steve’s house. It was heading towards me. I looked around in a panic, taking note that the storm outside had escalated to a level of intensity that was bordering on causing damage to the house. On the tape, the entity was traversing through the forest at insane speeds, to the point it appeared to be gliding across the forest floor, appearing like a long tracking shot. Before I knew it, the house was in its sights. At the last second I ducked behind the couch, as the glass pane door was shattered.   
  
I stayed crouched behind the couch, holding my breath. I peaked over to get a glimpse at the entity. I expected to see some sort of monstrosity, or demonic beast standing in the very living room. However, what I saw was far more confusing.  
  
There was nothing there.  
  
I looked at the television. It still was showing that thing’s point of view, yet there was nothing visible to my naked eye. I realized that although I couldn’t see it, my only advantage was that I could see what it was seeing through the television. Luckily it hadn’t spotted me yet. I slowly crawled around the couch, mirroring it so my location wouldn’t be detected. Finally, I managed to get to the VCR.  
  
I clicked eject on the VCR. As the VHS tape began to eject, the last image I saw was the monster’s pov snapping towards me. I clenched the VHS tightly and leapt towards the now shattered doors, unsure if this thing could harm me while the tape wasn’t playing. I got my answer as I heard the destruction of the television from behind me, as if something had leapt towards it. In the greatest burst of speed in my entire life, I made my way outside and battled through the storm towards my vehicle.  
  
I peeled out of his property, taking note in my rear view mirror as a section of the fence collapsed. The monster was catching up to my truck, the only evidence of its existence being the mailboxes and fence posts that were laid out in its path of destruction. I booked it as fast I could, finally making a highway and seemingly losing the entity. I drove for hours, until finally settling on a small town I hadn’t heard of in a neighboring state.   
  
I have been in a hotel since then, unsure of where the creature is. If I truly lost it, then I can’t imagine it would find me this far out. But maybe if I put in the tape again, I will be able to see its whereabouts. But something tells me that’s what it wants. I have no idea what to do at this point. I’m running out of savings, and my will is growing weaker by the day. I don’t know what to do.  
  
I’ve been getting nightmares. I have been seeing them, those things that shouldn’t be seen.  
  
We wish to know the things we shouldn’t, and our curiosity cannot be quenched. Maybe some things don’t need to be known. Those things that we can’t comprehend.  
  
Those things we fear.
