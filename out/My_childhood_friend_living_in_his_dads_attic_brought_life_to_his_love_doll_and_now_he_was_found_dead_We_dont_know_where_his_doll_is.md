Andy was that 30 somthing guy in your hometown that never had a girlfriend, never moved out of his parents place, and worked the same burger flipping job since high school. I was friends with him since elementary given our interests in creating art as well as tv cartoons and anime. 

My first memory of Andy was seeing him alone in the school parking lot a few hours after school closed. Coming from pee-wee football from field next by i asked him what he was doing here. "I'm just waiting for my parents to pick me up" he said as if he was on the brink of tears. "Were you here since school ended?" I was too young to understand or be really concerned, if anything I was probably just purely curious. "They're just a little late, they do that sometimes" 

Andy sat on a stone bench with the name to some administrator or someone. Facing away from me going through his backpack, digging out a notebook filled with sketches of crash bandicoot, solid snake, and zombies. The drawings themselves were really good considering we were both 8 at the time. I asked him if he had a ps1 to which he said "yeah, well it's my older brother's, i watch him play it a lot". I was so jealous at the time given  how my parents only let me and my sister play their old Atari. Given my parents were about to show up any minute to pick me up, i asked him if he wanted my parents to drop me and him off at his place so we can play ps1. He hesitated and said "it's really messy, is it okay if i come over to your place and hang out for a little bit before I call my parents?" I said sure and we went to my house and watched Cartoon Network and played Missle Command on my Atari.

He was a very talented artist and had a quirky sense of humor that leaned heavily on references to the Tim & Eric show. When I finally visited his home a few years later, I understood why he was so self-conscious about his home life. "You should probably keep your shoes on," he told me as he opened the paint chipped door to the worn down 3-story home slowly engulfed by grass and trees. Inside the home a dirt covered labrador dog ran up to me while a pitbull tried to nose its way outside. "SHUT THE DOOR DAMMIT!" A 400lb man nested on lazy boy shouted out at me and Andy. "That's my dad" Andy said at a casual whisper as he quickly pulled the dogs away and shut the door.

The home itself was boarding on a hoarder territory. It was clean enough to walk through and sit down, but had weird piles of things like DVD cases and broken window AC units piled up. Andy and I played games like Soul Reaver and Max Payne on his brother's ps2, which he got by working at the McDonald's a few miles away. Upstairs there was 3 bedrooms in total but one was full of his mom's sewing materials and his dad's weightlifting equipment, both covered in dust only occupying a room making Andy and his older brother share a room. 

Andy's older brother, Eric, as well as Andy a few years behind, worked at the local McDonald's a few miles down from their house. He would speak to Andy often in grunts or questions regarding his stuff. Eric would go into the military right after high school. Andy's mom i rarely saw because of her regular hospital stays due to cancer and would pass away around the time Andy was 15. I never saw Andy really cry or get sad about his mom's death. He would regard her as a "shadow of something he never really saw." Andy's dad was someone who I wouldn't necessarily call abusive but always did the minimum in terms of parenting. When I moved out of that small town for college. Andy would continue working the local McDonald's while only living with his dad in that rotting house...

After the pandemic i lost my job and lost my apartment, I moved back home for a bit with my parents. Andy was one of the few people I liked from high school who still lived in town. After getting in contact with him, i found out he still lived with his dad in that house. When I visited his house it was barely visible behind the vines and grass that swallowed it. His dad was now 500lbs with true hoarders nest of food containers that surrounded him, the dogs somehow still alive but barely had enough energy to get up to the arrival of guests.

Andy was rail thin, greasy, and looked 50 at the age of 32. He moved to the attic of his dad's house due to the accumulation of garbage that now filled his room. The attic was filled with sketches and oil paintings of lewd depictions of anime girls, cat women, and other things of a sexual nature, all while reeking of an odor of certain nature.

Andy, besides from me being his friend, was always loner. He had his crushes, but for one reason or another, he couldn't ever get into a serious relationship. Still, this scene took me back a bit. How lonely had Andy become after high school? He had been working at the local McDonald's for over 15 years now, only to what? Come home and draw porn and play video games? To be fair, the drawings themselves were really good in a certain artistic quality, he could pursue a career in it if he tried.

Andy seemed excited to show me something he called his magnum opus, his "Aphrodite Doll" he called. He opened up his crawl space and showed me somthing so...uncanny.

It was a lifesize doll connected by screws and heat dried clay. Parts of it had a synthetic skin quality to it. It was dressed in blue tube top and black skirt, accentuating some of its more... feminine qualities.

"You made a sex doll? And are keeping it in your crawl space, okay..." Just as I was about to continue and tell him how creepy it was, it got up on its own its puppet eyes opening and closing separately. The way its torso and arms swayed back and forth suggested it was very bottom heavy,  with its feet being soldered weight plates. As it wheeled towards Andy, I saw its back covered in wires and computer boards.

"Isn't it amazing! It's truly something every guy wishes for!" As he swrung his arm around the robots waist bringing it closer, its arms swinging limply for a moment before grabbing Andy's hip with one arm and rubbing his chest with the other. The whole action suggested it was slowly registering the movements of Andy and replying appropriately to the action.

"Well...I don't know...it's well...are you planning on selling this to some company or somthing?" I didn't know whether to laugh or gasp in terror and disgust. I guess in the end, all I cared about was Andy's wellbeing.

"I don't know, it took me awhile to get the AI right, although the skeleton and muscle and skin synthetics where easy to come by in comparison, to be honest I never really thought about selling it" He carefully reached to the back of it's head brushing off the hair sewed into it's head, flicking some switches before it slowly crouched into fetal position.

"Look, I'm going to be honest with you Andy, this is pretty weird, I don't like you living here still. Have you ever tried going out of the county? Have you ever had a relationship with anyone else besides family?" I came off sounding more frustrated than concerned which must of sent Andy a back, before I could let him reply i quickly and calmly said "look, it's i just care about you man, you're a talented guy, you can move to a better place than here, you can impress real women if you just talked to people"

He frowned and rolled his Aphrodite doll back into the crawl space in a rather hastily manner that suggested he was embarrassed in ever showing it. "Yeah, ok."

He was clearly frustrated, and i didn't want to upset him, "I'm not saying it's bad, it takes a lot skill to make that, it's just im worried about you is all"

He covered his mouth with his hand dragging it down across his stubble chin in motion of exhaustion. "i think you should leave."

I looked around in his filth and squaller with his absent father, who probably stopped caring long ago 2 floors down. I didn't want to push too much on Andy right there, I told myself I would invite him out of his home over time get him use to the outside world while not completely throwing away his talents.

"Alright, but i want you to take my number. Feel free to call me anytime."

I left the house that nature was slowly swallowing. I would get caught in the momentum of life, i would work in a warehouse an hour's drive away, i would meet my now current wife who would give me my son. Unfortunately, I wouldn't have the time to call Andy and he nor me, I wouldn't know how he turned out until I got a call from a police department at my hometown.

The police had told me that Andy was found dead in his room in the attic starved and head crushed with exceptional force, as well as having been sexually assaulted in a manner which the detectives had wanted remain hidden for the investigation. The reason why they were talking to me was because according to Andy's phone and social media records I was the last person Andy talked to before his disappearance.

"Have you talked to his father?" I asked the detective, she sighed "well that's the thing his father was killed by head trauma, 2 dogs also found in the home 1 crushed to death and the other by starved to death. We're just calling you to get a clearer picture."

I told her everything, the squaller, the drawings, the doll.  She seemed confused and frustrated by mention of the doll as if I was a child making up a story for attention. I asked her "well it should be in crawl space in the attic. Did you look there?"

"No, we didn't find anything, it could've been just one of those things he ordered online and threw out later" she asked if i knew anything else before, to which i said no before we both ended the call with our thank yous and let me know if anything comes up.

I wish there was a definitive end to this story, but even i don't believe the reports that it was some family dispute gone wrong according to the police reports. I wish I could go to the house to see if they missed anything, but after the investigation ended, they had condemned the house and bulldozed it to the ground. 

I did get a call Eric, Andy's older brother in the military, he had been given a sketchbook by Andy. He admitted that him and Andy were never close and that I should have the sketchbook since I was his only friend. The sketchbook amazingly was the one i saw Andy with the first day I met him, faded drawings of Crash bandicoot, Solid Snake, and zombies. It was also stuffed folded pieces of graph paper with newer writings. Some of them looked familiar, one of which was schematics of the Aphrodite Doll, as well as another schematic dated Aphrodite Dolls versions 2,3, and 4 dated just days after the last time I saw Andy.
