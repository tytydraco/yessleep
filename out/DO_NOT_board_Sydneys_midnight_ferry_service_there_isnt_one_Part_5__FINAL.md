Standing out on that deck as the ferry drifted through an infinite expanse of stars, was by far the most out of body I have ever felt. I could not comprehend how this was happening. I shouldn’t have even been alive out there, yet somehow I was able to breathe and move just as I normally would. Whether by some magical confines of the ever mysterious vessel, or some universal spell I was under, I still don’t know. I slowly paced around the deck, taking in the awe inspiring views all around me. Making my way around to the upper front deck, I looked out to the Portside of the ferry and had to steady myself, as I saw a massive glowing white ball which appeared to be so close to us I could have jumped off and floated right to it.

It took me a few moments to realise it. I was staring at our Moon. I was dumbstruck, it was so close! Right there! I turned back around, gazing out over the Starboard side, and I noticed that Earth was directly in my line of sight now. I turned back around, there was the moon to my left. Looking back again, there’s Earth off to my right. Something happened to me in that moment. This was entirely wrong. My mind, it simply could not compute the orientation. The moon should be above me. Earth should be below my feet. It also dawned on me in that moment, I was seeing Earth to my right, where it was below me earlier. We must have been slowly spinning around as we drifted through the Galaxy. Again, I couldn’t mentally process this. I began to feel incredibly dizzy, and I fell to the ground, unable to pick myself back up. I had to crawl my way back inside, sliding open the door and dragging myself to one of the only remaining empty rows of seats that were not yet occupied by the nothing-people.

Sitting back in my seat now, I just looked out the window, watching the celestial light show outside. If I wasn’t already, I was pretty dam sure now that I was not getting off this boat… ever. I felt a sense of peace in that moment, like I didn’t have try so hard anymore. There was a feeling of acceptance, followed by a mix of sadness and regret. I thought back to that night. What if I had just taken a cab instead? It was midnight, what on earth was I even thinking taking a ferry back home at that hour anyway? Money, of course. It was always about money. Not in this moment it wasn’t. All of that seemed quite unimportant now. I just… watched. As literal space and time passed by before my very eyes. Before long, my eyes became heavy, and I could keep them open no longer…

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*“Attention passengers! The café service is now open! Please form a line, do not rush, do not push. Everybody will be served in due time.”*

The announcement from the P.A. system ripped me out of my slumber, signalling the return of my one and only friendly companion. I watched as the masses of nothing-people and strange humanoids began their march toward the café. The ferry was almost full now, and there was a constant stream of them shuffling and stuttering their way up the stairs and towards the counter. One by one they placed their orders, collecting cups of coffee, hot pies, fresh sandwiches and slices of cake, before slowly making their way back down and filling up the empty seats once again.

I decided to wait until things calmed down a bit. I didn’t want to go anywhere near these things. The tall, pointy limbed ones which had boarded the ferry in the mangrove swamp yesterday were now clicking their way up the stairs, and I cringed back a little as they emerged at the top, their faces coming into view for the first time. They were downright horrible. Long, puffy faces that seemed permanently crafted into vicious looks of sheer hatred. I looked away, resigning myself to just waiting until I heard the crowds disperse. I could hear Café Guy struggling to keep up with all this, yet his overtly positive attitude never once faltered. He still hummed Kumbaya as he went about his duties, and I now smiled at the sound of that tune, where it once kinda weirded me out. If he could keep his spirits up, maybe I could too.

I sat back, waiting my turn. Slowly but surely, in amongst noises I cannot even accurately put into words, I heard the crowd beginning to thin, and I chanced a look back in the direction of the café. There were only about five or six passengers now, waiting in line to be served. At the front of the line stood a short little thing, no taller than a child of maybe five years old. His form was scrawny, save for his gigantic head, and I wondered how he actually stayed upright. It looked as though he should be toppling over every step. While this thing resembled a child in stature, it clearly was not. His face resembled something more akin to a 60 year old man, a thick, gruff beard, and wrinkled skin. I watched as he raised his arms, jumping up and down at the counter like a toddler would, before one of the taller passengers behind him reached down and picked him up, sitting him on the counter top.

I had to blink a couple of times to make sure what I was seeing was actually happening. It didn’t matter how much I had been exposed to, the sheer absurdity of this ferry still managed to catch me off guard. I watched on as he placed his order, in a language I could not fathom, before sliding off the top of the counter and landing back on the floor with a thud. He caught sight of me staring as he spun back around to await his order, and as he did so, a frown emerged across his face. A second later, he took a step forward, raised his hand… and flipped me off.

Are you kidding me?! I thought to myself, as he turned back around and stared up at Café Guy, tapping his foot as if growing impatient. Café Guy noticed this, and he stepped away from the coffee machine for a moment. What happened next was rather chilling. I did not hear what was said between these two, but what I observed was enough. Café Guy slowly stepped out from behind the counter, kneeled down to get face to face with this little guy, and whispered in his ear. As he communicated whatever it was, the little guy’s face grew more and more sombre, as though realising he had made a terrible mistake. Just before he stood up, Café Guy pointed toward the Captain’s Quarters, before whispering a few more words of caution to the little fella. And that was it. Café Guy stood up once again. The little guy stood off to the side, his hands now tucked behind his back, waiting patiently and quietly for his order. Once his order was prepared, he grabbed it from Café Guy, turned around and looked at me sheepishly, gave a little wave as if to say “sorry about before”, and then waddled off downstairs.

I could only stare after him, left to wonder what Café Guy had told him. Although, it wasn’t hard to piece together the gist of it. Whatever that thing is that had stepped out from the Captain’s Quarters the other night is not something I’d like to be drawing the attention of. Pushing those thoughts to one side, and noticing that the remainder of the customers had received their orders and were now making their way back to their seats, I got up and made my way over, feeling hungry for a bite to eat, but also to pick this guy’s brain a little more.

*“Good morning my friend!”* Said Café Guy as I approached the counter. I gave him a little wave and returned his greeting, before stepping up to lean on the counter.

*“I guess there’s no point in asking you where we are? Or how we’re here?”* I asked Café Guy, assuming he was going to simply dance around the point once again. But then, what he said actually surprised me!

*“We’re on our final run! We’ll be home soon! You can relax now, the journey is almost over,”* he said, and something in his happy, optimistic tone had me almost believing those words. Deep in the back of my mind, I knew that wasn’t true, but hope is a strange thing, it just takes the tiniest spark to keep you believing, to keep you holding on.

*“Well, whatever that means, I guess I won’t be seeing you any more after, well, whatever comes next?”* I asked him, as he stood there smiling.

*“Oh I’ll be around young man. I’ve worked this route for many, many years, and I’ll be doing this for many more to come. Like I always say, important to know one’s place,”* he said, his smile wavering ever so slightly.

I stared back at him, a look on my face struggling to mask the millions of questions I still wanted to ask, yet knew to be pointless. I got the feeling that no matter what I said, how I phrased it, or how desperately I begged him for answers, he wasn’t going to give me any. Whether by choice, or perhaps he genuinely did not know, I’m still not sure. Anyway, satisfied that I had once again hit the threshold of what he was willing to offer, I turned my attention to my empty belly, asking him for a couple more of those sausage rolls that seemed a staple of his little cafeteria.

Café Guy smiled warmly, turning around and pulling a selection of sausage rolls out of the freezer box, and throwing them into the microwave. *“Coming right up Sir,”* he said, before turning around to prepare me a coffee. What a great bloke, I thought. I never even had to ask him. What’s more, he seemed to show the same kindness and accomodation to all the critters on this vessel, regardless of size, shape, language or outward appearance. Café Guy was a man of the people. Or, rather, of the nothing-people.

***Ding!***

Ah, my precious pastries were done. I grabbed them off Café Guy with a smile and a thank you, along with my hot coffee for the day, and bid him farewell once again, returning to my seat to get my breakfast into me. Sitting in my row of seats up front, I munched away on my sausage rolls and sipped my coffee as I gazed out the window, the universe slowly passing us by. Regardless of how I got here or what came next, I was very aware that I was witnessing something that very few human beings would ever have the privilege to see. I watched as a meteorite, its tail burning so very brightly in the darkness, flew past in the distance, and I wondered how far away it really was. One Earth-length? Five Earth-lengths? That blew my mind just thinking about it. Peeking my head out the window a little and looking up, I saw a group of tiny planets, or perhaps moons, just suspended there, as if props being held up by string before a huge, black canvas dotted with sparkles and swirls.

As the ferry drifted through this sheer magic, I swear I could hear whispers, all around me. Not inside the ferry, no, emanating and echoing all throughout the Galaxy, it seemed. They were indistinguishable from one another, yet beautifully unique at the same time. As insane as that sounds, all I can say is that things seemed to work differently out there. The laws of our world, they did not apply anymore. For example, my mind would occasionally catch a stray thought reminding me that there was no up or down out here, and I would suddenly feel weightless. I would have to lay down every time it happened, stretching out across my row of seats. Still when I think about it, I get that same feeling of vertigo. In that moment, however, before everything that happened next, I can honestly say it is the most alive I have ever felt. I continued watching the stars, distant planets and all manner of cosmic happenings for hours on end as the ferry continued gently floating along. Eventually, I do not know when, it could have been minutes, or it could have been hours, my eyes began to close, and I felt a sense of peace unlike any I have ever felt before, and likely ever will again. With an overwhelming feeling of warmth washing over my entire being, I was pulled into a blissful slumber once more…

***Bwooooooom! Bwooooooom!***

Jesus… I thought I was done hearing that God awful noise. I took a peak at my watch, noting the time was around 10pm at night. Gosh, I had slept for a good while. Sitting up from my little row of seats and stretching, I took another look out the window, noticing we had drifted our way into a very different looking sector of the Galaxy. I say Galaxy, as this is my best estimate. I had no idea if we were even still in the Milky Way, or if we had drifted far beyond the outer rim. What I saw outside at that point, in comparison to where we had just come from, the best word I can use is “desolate”. This part of space was quite empty, and the colours were very different. Where before I could see all manner of bright colours and shades, now there appeared to be a dull, blue haze encompassing the area, and it was sparsely populated with small, grey looking planets and moons. The ferry began to shake and vibrate, as we made a slow approach toward one of these planets.

I noticed how strange and different this felt. The ferry didn’t even turn or readjust itself in any way, it just started drifting diagonally, shaking more violently the closer it got, as if caught in some kind of gravitational pull. As we got closer to the planet, I watched as Ramp Guy stomped his way around the deck, grabbing the ramp and throwing it toward the gate in preparation. Slowly we were pulled nearer to this strange place, which now looked more like a small moon than a planet, its surface rocky and smooth. Before long, a loud clunk, and the ferry groaned as it positioned itself up against a very strange looking “jetty”. It looked to be crafted out of black obsidian, and it stretched out for kilometres on end. I noticed a few more odd figures making their way up the dock, preparing to board the ferry. Anything remotely humanoid was far gone by this point, these ones walked on all fours and moved in pairs. When they reached the top, Ramp Guy began shouting at them to hurry it along.

I averted my eyes as I heard them clomping their way up the stairs toward the upper floor, what passed for their hands and feet slopping along the floor before squirming their way into an empty row of seats a little way behind mine. The ferry was fast filling up now, with only four rows on my side still empty. We continued floating along, making stops at more of these galactic wastelands, picking up more of these beings along the way. At one of these stops, I kid you not, we docked in to collect a group of three tall figures that looked almost identical to the typical depiction of an alien that you see in movies and tv shows. Tall, slim, pale white and seemingly faceless. They gently swayed their way onto the ship, shuffling up the stairs and taking a seat directly behind me. I could see their forms, towering above me, out of the periphery of my vision. I could hear the strange noises they made as they sat there no doubt staring at me. Without another thought, I quickly stood up and practically ran out onto the deck.

I couldn’t handle it anymore! These things were too close to me now, and I could feel the burn of a thousand eyes on me. For some reason, I was still quite the spectacle on this ferry. That moment, was perhaps the most critical decision I made throughout my entire time on board. For as I made my way around to the front of the deck, I noticed something up ahead. It was only quite small in the distance at that stage, but I had my inklings as to what I was looking at. Something up ahead was much darker than the rest of the void surrounding us. I was staring at something pure pitched black in colour, and circular in shape. I knew what it was deep down, I knew in my heart, that’s where we were headed.

I ran back inside the ferry, bursting through the door, every set of eyes in the room drawn immediately to me, but I did not care. I ran to the Captain’s Quarters and I pounded on the door.

***“PLEASE!!!”*** I shouted, trying desperately to get his attention. I bashed on the door, over and over and over again, screaming at him to please listen to me.

***“PLEASE!!! LET ME OFF THIS FERRY!!!”*** I shouted, slamming my fist against the glass so hard I thought it might break. This time, I did get the Captain’s attention. Slowly, ever so slowly, he turned around to face me, without ever taking his hands off the wheel. He stared at me for moments on end, his face a blank slate, totally emotionless. I saw in that moment that it was pointless. The way this man looked at me, a look of complete and utter indifference toward me, as though I was merely cattle being herded toward the slaughter, was absolutely soul crushing.

I gently tapped my fist against the glass once more, my head now resting down beside my hand against the glass, and I sobbed. I sobbed because I knew it was over. I sobbed as I faced the prospect of half a life cut meaninglessly short. I sobbed as I looked up again, noticing the black spot on the horizon ahead growing larger still. I sobbed as I turned around, my back resting against the door as I slid down to the floor. And I sobbed harder still, as I looked up to see Café Guy standing there, his eyes wet with tears the same as mine. Forcing myself up, I approached his counter for what I was sure would be the last time.

*“Why?”* Was all I could ask. Café Guy just shook his head in response, wiping some tears away as he did so.

*“It shouldn’t be possible,”* he said between sobs. *“I knew there was something different about you the day I first saw you. Your eyes too vibrant, your spirit, too lively. You were not ready for this journey.”*

I stared back at him, things beginning to slowly fall into place. Tears welled up in my eyes as I spoke again, gently now, any remnants of hope long gone. 

*“I… I still don’t understand.”* I said. *“If it’s not possible, then how can it be? Why me?”* I asked, tears pouring from my eyes.

Café Guy looked at me solemnly, a deep and genuine sadness present on his once kind face. Wiping away his own tears again, he spoke softly to me.

“*There are very few hard and fast rules at play in this universe. Certainly, fewer than we would like to believe. Sure, we have built ourselves a comfortable little modern society, under the false pretence that we are ever truly in control of any of it, overly confident in the knowledge that nothing which exists outside of our realms of understanding can ever harm us. It shouldn’t have been possible, young man. But you boarded the wrong ferry at the wrong time… Now, there’s nothing any of us can do about it but continue on to our final destination…”*

I stood there in shock, not wanting to believe the words I was hearing, yet knowing full well within my heart that it was true. Café Guy placed a gentle hand on my shoulder.

*“I’m so… so sorry sir…”*

Defeated, I once again walked out on deck. I just paced around out there, not knowing what I could even do next, resigning myself to just making the most of the moments I had left. Around and around I strolled, looking out into the vacuum which enveloped us. Occasionally, I would look out ahead at the ever expanding size of the monster we were approaching. I had heard talk of black holes in my life, but I never really understood the many theories surrounding them. I wondered what we might face on the other side. Would we freeze, or perhaps burn to death? A little of both? Would we be transported to some incredible afterlife? Or perhaps the opposite? Or would it all turn black as midnight, our shared existence blinking out in an instant?

Hang on a second, I thought… *“midnight”*…

*“You boarded the wrong ferry at the wrong time…”*

What ran through my mind in that instant was perhaps extreme, yet is not hope so often a mere grain, worth taking a leap of faith for? My heart began to race, those primal instincts telling me to turn and run, or stand and fight, kicking in once again. I glanced at my watch… 

*11:45pm.*

It would need to be timed perfectly, I thought, as I ran back inside and took a seat in my now one empty row, ever other seat on the vessel now occupied by nothing-people and shadowy, alien lifeforms. I sat on the edge of my seat, my leg bouncing nervously up and down, as I glanced back and forth between the stairwell and my watch. As I sat there, waiting for my one moment of hope to approach, I heard the crackle of the P.A. system spark back to life.

*“Attention passengers. The final café service is now open. Last meal requests shall now be taken. Please form an orderly line and requests shall be catered to to the best of our ability.”*

Hearing those words… “last meal”… was harrowing. But I steeled myself, intent to remain focussed at all costs, no matter what else might happen around me. I glanced back at my watch. The minutes were ticking by so very slowly now. I only prayed this thing was still in sync, or that time was even relevant out here. I did not know… What I did know is that it was a chance. And that was the best I could hope for.

The herd of nothing-people were all making their way up to the counter, what seemed like hundreds of them now, blocking the stairwell. I watched in amazement as Café Guy churned out beautiful meals, seemingly from nowhere. Everything from fine Italian cuisine, to hearty noodle dishes, as well as odd looking slops, grains and other dishes that were not even remotely comprehensible to my human mind. Before long the line had moved up and around the aisles enough that I had some space to slip down the stairs. Before I did so I quickly made my way over to the side of the counter, placing a hand on Café Guy’s shoulder. He looked over to me, puzzled.

*“Thank you. For everything.”* I said to him, before darting off down the stairs. There was a look in his eyes as I left him there. He looked concerned, like he knew what I had planned, and was just as unsure as me as to whether or not it might work.

Stepping down out of the stairwell, I grabbed myself a seat right on the edge of one of the centre rows, with a straight shot to the Portside exit. I sat there, nervously bouncing my leg up and down again, my adrenaline starting to kick in. I glanced at my watch…

*11:57pm.* 

This is it, I thought, as I glanced back up to look at the doorway… and I froze. Ramp Guy, with his massive form and his hate filled glare, was standing right there, staring at me. Oh my God. Did he know? I stood up from my seat, pacing back and forth up and down the aisles, pretending to be simply stretching my legs. Every time I turned around to pace back down the aisle, I saw him, still standing there blocking the doorway. I looked back at my watch… 

*11:58pm.*

I spun around, walking back up the stairwell now. I could practically feel the ticking of my watch, every precious second not one that I could afford to waste. Reaching the top step I turned the corner, heading toward the Portside deck on the upper floor. On my way past, I caught sight once more of Café Guy. I think he knew now, and he gave me a warm smile and a nod as I passed him by. I slid open the doorway, stepping out onto the upper deck, and leaning over the railing. Ramp Guy was still there, standing in the doorway downstairs.

*11:59pm…*

It was now or never. I stepped up onto the railing of the upper deck, and I jumped!

***CLANG!***

I landed gut first on the lower deck, completely disoriented with the ferry’s weird movements through space. This did not go unnoticed by Ramp Guy, nor did my almost perfectly executed series of movements following it, as I threw myself back onto my feet and ripped open the ferry’s Portside gates. I stood there, teetering on the edge, staring down into the void, as Ramp Guy began moving toward me.

*30 seconds to go…*

I gripped onto the railing so hard it hurt my hands, as I shuffled my feet along the narrow, slippery ledge on the outside of the vessel. Clinging to the ferry, I took a few measured steps along the outside, trying to make it as difficult as possible for this prick to grab me.

*15 seconds to go…*

*10 seconds to go…*

I counted them down in my head now, as I desperately tried to cling on to the railing until the last possible second.

*10… 9… 8…*

Ramp Guy was right there in front of me now!

*7… 6… 5…*

*“Where do ya think you’re goin’ aye?!”* He grunted, as he gripped my arms tight.

*4… 3… 2… 1…*

I pushed off as hard as I could, launching myself willingly into the abyss! Ramp Guy, however, did not let go. So determined to keep me on board that hellish vessel he was, that he was now plummeting through space right along with me! As we fell, the cold solar winds whipping by us as we went, I cried out in pain as he wrapped a massive arm around my neck, seemingly intent on at least killing me if he could not keep me prisoner.

Down and down we fell, Ramp Guy squeezing the life out of me harder and harder all the while. I could feel myself slipping away into darkness, and for a few awful moments I was all but certain that after everything this was going to be how it ended for me, when suddenly, a familiar crash of thunder!

***SPLASH!***

I was under water again. Where? I did not know. I tried desperately to kick my legs and get myself back to the surface, but I could not move. I opened up my eyes, and in one horrifying moment I saw why. A long dead, rotting corpse was clung to my body. I screamed, bubbles escaping my mouth as I manically tried to get this thing off me! Finally, after much thrashing and kicking, I was free, and I kicked my legs and flailed my arms as hard as I could, making my way up toward the sliver of moonlight I could see above.

With a crash, I broke through the surface, desperately taking in air as I looked around, trying to figure out where the hell I had ended up this time. And then I saw it. It took a few moments to take it all in, admittedly. The familiar cityscape beyond the harbour lights. The iconic Sydney Harbour Bridge and Opera House, still standing firm and in tact. Luna Park… bright and bubbly just as it had always been. I was back in Sydney. The real Sydney!

*“Oi! Get outa' the water dickhead! There’s sharks in there!”*

As if to confirm what I was seeing in possibly the most Aussie way possible, a shout from the shoreline, from a real human being! I never thought in a million years I would be so glad to be bobbing up and down in the middle of Sydney Harbour at midnight.

The man did raise a good point though, and I began quickly making a bee line for the rocky edges of the harbour nearby. One stroke… then another… then another. All the while, very concious that a bull shark may see fit to take a chunk out of me as I swam along. But I kept going, knowing that freedom was just metres away now.

The feeling of grabbing onto those rocks, and dragging myself up onto the grass, is the best sensation I have ever experienced in my life. I remember the blades of grass digging into my skin as I stared up at the starry, moonlit sky with a newfound sense of dread, and I recall how overwhelmingly grateful I was for merely being able to feel something as mundane as grass. I was back… I was home…

I did not even consider getting on another ferry. Or a bus, or a train. Too paranoid that something may spirit me away to another realm. I walked myself up the hill, found the nearest road, and called myself an Uber like I dam well should have done in the first place. A little over an hour later, and finally, I was stepping in through my front door for the first time in what had genuinely felt like months, but in reality, had been merely a few days.

There has been much I have reflected on in the days since I returned. Not least of all Café Guy’s words. There are indeed, very few rules keeping this existence of our’s bound to normality. Fewer than any of us would be comfortable being truly aware of. I am no stranger to this corner of the internet. That which houses endless Creepypasta tales and reality bending horror stories. So the next time you’re reading one of these submissions, perhaps something about a cursed bus, or a haunted tram ride. Consider for a moment, how farfetched are these stories really? It has been long theorised among those familiar with the paranormal that there are certain times of day which align with things we simply do not understand. And there are of course, places in this world where strange things are simply more prone to occur.

Maybe you’ll remember my tale the next time you’re waiting in line for the bus or the train… or the ferry. Perhaps the stop you’re waiting at feels a little off. A little too liminal, almost like a place between places. Maybe you notice something that doesn’t quite fit, like an out of place fog. Maybe in those moments, it’s best to just call yourself a cab. I don’t know. All I know is that what I experienced on board was definitely not of this world. It terrifies me to think what might have happened if I had remained on board, if I had not chanced that leap of faith at the exact moment I did.

Who knows where I’d be. And who knows how many more of these vessels are still out [there.](https://www.reddit.com/user/Creepy__Oz/comments/1hc8ay2/my_stories_master_list/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
