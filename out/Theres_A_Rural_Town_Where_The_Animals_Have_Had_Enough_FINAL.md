While I knew my situation was dire initially, I knew it had gotten even worse when we finally arrived in Orwell.

I suppose the small town would have usually looked idyllic, with mountains visible in the distance with little one story shops and quaint houses spreading over to a lake nearby, a windmill at the very edge of the town with a farm next to it.

However, currently, the whole area looked as if it had been struck by the apocalypse. The buildings were smashed up, windows shattered and most cars had been left to decay, rust infecting them.

In the middle of the street, there was a bonfire where all sorts of furniture blazed, more being flung onto it by a wide variety of bipedal animals, deer, wolves, raccoons, sheep and a moose, who moved in the flickering firelight like well-oiled soldiers.

The worst part was the people. A bear, who wore leaves on his shoulders like pauldrons, stood on top of a house, shouting and throwing rocks down at more of the slathering slave-humans, all naked and hairy, that moved in a lobotomised congregation below him, bearing large logs.

They were all moving in the same direction, I noticed, and I wondered if they were being forced to make some kind of massive den for the animals.

I was urged forwards.

“You-you’re going to turn me into one of them, aren’t you?” The answer was stupidly obvious, what else would they have wanted with me? But the absolute bizarre situation I had found myself in meant that my mind was not working at its usual calibre.

The deer simply smirked.

The smell was awful, like how certain enclosures in zoos smell, the sort of tightly-packed, humid smell which makes you think of mouldy animal droppings. It sounded like a slaughterhouse, with all the things around me whooping and screeching in delight, while my degenerate human brothers moaned in their mindless despair. A slaughterhouse run by animals where humans were butchered and processed.

As I went further into the centre of this area, where the bonfire was, I noticed the figures hanging from the trees.

Dogs of all sizes and breeds had been hung with nooses from the branches of trees. All had similar modifications to their bodies that my captors had, upright bodies that swung slowly in the wind.

“Your see the traitors?” One of the deers chuckled. “Too loyal. Had to go.”

I felt sick. It was the first time on the trip I’d been glad I hadn’t brought my dog along with me.

“You fucking animals.” I whispered.

The pair cackled like hyenas.

Spotting me, the bear on the roof stopped hurling rocks and lumbered off of the roof, then stomped over to us.

The thing was terrifying, looming over even the deer by at least four feet, his huge brown body was similar in build and general gait to some horrible, fat drunk you might see somewhere. There was an expression of permanent fury on the bear’s savage face.

He spoke to the other two in a rumbling, half-pained, half-threatening grunt. Halfway through whatever he was saying he motioned to me with one of his gargantuan claw-tipped paws, and I could not help but cringe back in fear, certain that it was going to grab and devour me.

When this happened, he turned his black eyes on me and let out an amused growl. “Have you ever been to a farm before, child?” Even though it was much deeper than a human’s voice could ever be, the bear’s English was much better than that of any of the other animals.

Before I had time to question this harrowing comment, I was pulled away by my captors.

Content with what he had ordered my fate to be, the bear plodded back over to the house.

As we passed the bonfire, I heard jeering calls from the animals, like the sort you hear in a movie when new inmates arrive in prison, and even felt claws caressing me, nipping at my exposed skin. Attempting to curl up away from the torment as best I could, I again began to weep.

I was then pulled around the town for at least half an hour. The whole way the two deer were speaking in their language about things I dread to learn, occasionally trying to scare me with smug remarks in their malformed version of English.

I saw many strange, horrible sights on my journey there. The entire town had been overrun, the monsters wrecking every man made structure and filling it with their nests. 

The troglodytes who were what I suppose used to be the population of Orwell did most of the work for them, and as I mentioned before, were all carrying logs to the town’s park, piling them up into dens which I guess were for hibernation or something similar.

The worst part is, that as far as I understand, these aren’t even the optimum conditions for these animals to live in. It seemed to me like they were just doing this to be cruel to the humans.

I saw a large moose, who was at the head of a noisy circular crowd of beasts, calling for all to be silent as they watched something in the centre.

As I passed, I saw a pair of naked old women fighting each other, savagely ripping into each other with their nails and teeth, wrestling on the ground. Every time a substantial amount of damage was done, the crowd would begin to holler in excitement.

Neither woman looked at all embarrassed or horrified, their eyes betrayed only pure primal eagerness for violence, and fox like cunning.

Finally, the smaller of the women got the other on the ground, greedily chomping at her forehead with rotted teeth while she choked her out in a desperate headlock.

When her opponent went limp, the small woman began to bound around the circle, cheered on by the animals, her tongue luling from her mouth and her eyes wide. She was petted on the head by the moose, who then snatched a large, juicy apple from the paws of a disappointed looking bobcat, who proceeded to go to the dead woman’s side, and sadly whimper and nuzzle her saggy flesh on all fours.

The other animals, seeing this, laughed at the bobcat, and kicked him until he ran off on all fours, snarling back into the woods.

I also saw they had set up a shooting range in another part of the park. Despite their growth of seemingly functional hands, the monsters had difficulty shooting guns. 

Many seemed unable to position their bodies properly to aim at the straw figures they had set up.

I saw a fox, standing around the size of a toddler, attempt to hoist up a pistol and fire it. He did manage to pull the trigger, the impact sent him flying backwards.

I may have laughed in other circumstances. Instaid, I began to have dark thoughts of how perhaps this was not the last stage of their evolution. Perhaps someday, they would be able to use these weapons we had left for them, and as they were already seemingly building an army out here. I began to imagine the woods around my parent’s house, thick with cunning, shiny black eyes.

I recalled hearing something on the news recently about how animals in this region had been recorded displaying unusual migration patterns, including a large pack of bison from another state, who were heading to some location around where Orwell was.

Remembering this made my stomach turn cold as the black water of a river, though I had no other choice but to keep walking.

The worst thing I saw, by far, however, was the farm.

Humans roamed the pens on all fours, fighting in the mud for scraps of food thrown to them by the ‘farmers’.

I was able to get a glance inside one of the cheerful red barns as we went past and saw what must have been dozens of people packed in there, men and women, all squeezed into the racks of wooden planks on the walls, furnished with sharp, matted hay. 

What made this image worse was that it looked almost identical to those pictures of the prisoners in Nazi concentration camps from World War Two, all those poor emaciated people forced to squeeze in those tiny draw-like bunks.

I saw one male human with a female, having a feral sexual intercorse against a fence pole.

Watching like some kind of monstrous cuckold, a wild pig with black fur and a disgustingly bloated stomach stood inches from them on his scrawny trotters. Under his long, double-barrel shotgun snout he was grinning widely, like a child sitting and watching his favorite cartoon.

In one hand, he held a brutal-looking electric cattle prod, which, after a few moments of greedily watching, he jabbed into the man. Over the short crackle of the cattle prod, I could hear both the man and the pig howling. The woman screamed too, as her partner’s body was wracked by the electricity.

Noticing my slack face upon seeing this, the deer stopped.

“Your like that, hm?” Grinning, one of them pointed at a large, grey building in the near distance that looked like an overgrown brick.

“Kill house.” He said, “Meat house.”

He pointed at the barn, then back at the building.

“We take yours like your took us’. Soon as it pop out of your.”

It suddenly struck me that through all the village, in the square, and the streets and the pens, I had not seen a single child. Not even in the barn. I had only seen what I’d estimated to be a few teenagers, but no children whatsoever.

I looked back at the pair. They seemed to have finished, now simply lying together in the mud, embracing and crying into each other’s shoulders. Standing over them stood the pig, his head rolled back in gruesome, guttural laughter, with his chubby hand on his belly.

“And us’ do not eat them, even.”

I looked back at the deer, my jaw set like a boulder and with what I hoped was a burning fury in my eyes.

“Us just let them grind. Grind up into bone and guts and blood. All the little ones.” He finished, speaking with the righteous passion of a priest preaching to his congregation.

They finally took me to a little cantankerous hut just outside the village and up a short hill. Above the door was a human skull, washed red with what I fear was blood, antlers tied to the sides of it.

“Goat! Goat!” They screamed, pounding on the door.

There was a short, tired noise from within and they entered.

The Greeks and other ancient civilisations had imagined hell as a material, subterranean location that was like a kind of underground network of caves in which the dead were tormented. This was what the inside of the hut was like.

The interior smelled of coppery blood and sopping wet gore, both of which I spotted boiling and bubbling and rolling around in the gelatinous collective goop contained in a massive black cauldron in the centre of the room.

On the floor, stretched out as a rug like you would with the pelt of an animal, was the skin of a man, the wide-eyed head still attached.

All over the walls were the severed body parts of humans, strung up a primitive shrine-like mockery of a hunting lodge, even with a large hunting rifle mounted on the wall.

An old, hunch-backed female goat who held a malformed, twisted staff, sat on a cartoonishly large and rickety rocking chair in the corner. 

She had the first human child I’d seen in Orwell, looking to be only a few months old, curled up in her lap like a cat. The child had some sort of physical disability, I could tell, however not something like the mindlessness of those in the village or the steeds, something more natural, Down’s Syndrome perhaps.

*A rare breed of pet*, I thought.

The goat’s horns were cracked, as was her skin, and her milky white eyes stared right at me. In one ear, I saw she had a yellow tag, bolted into the skin as many goats owned at farms do.

After petting it a few times, she placed the baby down, letting it skitter off into the dark recesses of the demonic place, and got up, limping over to the cauldron.

My heart began to beat faster as I was forced down to my knees, firm hands placed on my shoulders by the deers. I felt as if I was dropping down a bottomless pit, as I began to realise I had been brought here for some kind of ritural.

The goat came forwards. “Did you fight, man? Did you kill any of my soldiers?”

I was too tired to respond, simply slinking forwards. Though suddenly, I remembered the rage I felt upon seeing the pig torture those people, felt it resurging and cursing through my veins.

My head shot up and I spat a great, spiteful glob of spit right onto the end of her long face.

Her bovine brows curled into offence and she curtly ordered one of the deer to hit me, which he gleefully did, striking my cheek hard with his cloven hand and knocking more spit from my mouth.

She then brought out a strange artifact, a ball, which produced red mist that wisped around the floor. It swung from a golden chain which she held in one hand, and the ball itself was embroidered with strange markings, spears and horns and leaves.

She slowly approached me as the deer continued to hold me down, croaking out strange words.

These words did not resemble the language that I had heard the animals speaking to each other before. They were deeper, more ancient, and instilled the stirring of something primal within me.

As she came closer, I breathed in the smoke that came from the ball. The smoke smelled like rage, pain, and thousands of years of development, of evolution and advancement.

Then, it was as if my head was plunged into a barrel of thick water, my stinging eyes staring down at the mystery fish which stirred in the black fathoms.

I was hypnotised. I felt like tearing through the woods with my bare hands, killing animals with my teeth and striking rocks together until a flame sparked. I felt like sleeping in the darkness every night, knowing that especially under the cover of the stars, I was always in danger.

I felt those who had come before me melding into my mind, the temporal sludge of memory melding around me.

Then, suddenly, I heard faint gunshots.

The goat stopped chanting, gasped, and dropped the ball, which smashed on the floor, filling the small room with the red mist.

Then it was as if my head had been released, and I came back to the surface, greedily gulping in air.

The deer shouted, and I heard more gunshots.

The one which held my gun rushed out of the cottage, the other going to comfort the goat, who had started cowering in the corner.

I do not know if the strange rage the ritual had imbued in me fuelled what I did next, or if it was simply the anger I felt at the atrocities I had witnessed, but I leaped up and dived for the deer.

Surprised, he was unable to throw me off of him before I was digging my fingers into his eyes, screaming in anger as I did.

After he had gone limp, I stood, red and white ichor still dripping from my fingers, and turned to the goat.

She was huddled in the corner, clutching the baby, who cried with her. I picked up her staff and prised the baby from her hands. I then quickly sat it down in the next room, coming back to find her attempting to crawl out of the door.

I took her staff, and slammed it down onto her head until one of her horns crumbled from her head. 

Then, while she was limp, though still raggedly breathing, I pulled her by the remaining horn to the cauldron, and opened her maw.

I slammed her open mouth down onto the cauldron’s cold rim until I found myself holding only the top of her head, still clinging onto the horn.

As her half-headed body crumpled to the floor, I dropped the part of the head I held into the mass of gore in the cauldron, and watched as it floated above it all, eyes still lulling lazily in their sockets.

Sometimes I look back at the brutality with which I treated the deer and the goat, and feel a pang of guilt.

I tried to imagine if she had ever felt guilty for all the pain she had caused, if the screams of the devolved men and women who suffered because of her haunted her at night.

I often find it difficult to convince myself they did not.

After taking the hunting rifle from the wall, I placed the crying child safely in a ravaged bed in the hut’s unused bedroom, vowing that I’d come back for him.

I ran from the hut, down the hill, to find that Orwell had descended into even more chaos.

I could see the invasive lights of police cars in the distance, within the village, where I could hear more gunshots.

Around me, in the farm, the humans, looking confused and scared, had rushed inside the barn, while some of the animals had started back for the woods, running in fear on all four legs.

Suddenly, I spotted the wild pig I had seen before, peeking around the side of the barn nearest to me, shivering with fear and trying to see if the coast was clear for him to run.

“No way.” I said between gritted teeth.

Aiming the rifle, I put the monstrosity in the sights before firing, sending him down with a satisfying squeal. As I mentioned before, I’m not the best shot, so while I had been aiming for his heart, I ended up hitting his left shoulder.

While he was still on the floor, snorting in pain, I rushed over, and shot him in the leg. Now demobilised, he screamed louder, rolling over on the ground.

Picking up his cattle prod, which he had dropped, I advanced, turning the prod on and letting it crackle, a warning.

After he was done crying in pain, the pig’s black eyes went wide at the sight of what I had in my hand.

“NO! NO, PLEASE!” He garbled.

But it was too late. I shoved the stick into his mouth, jamming his stinking maw open with my foot as I electrocuted the roof of his mouth.

Digging the stick’s prongs in further, I cried in rage as the beast spasmed and jerked below me, eyes rolling around in their sockets like a rider being bucked on a bull. Finally, the eyes popped, dribbling down the thing’s fat cheeks as his body let out a few final jerks, the brain finally fried.

I sank back onto my ass in the mud, gasping with content.

“Jesus Christ, son.” I recognised the sheriffs’ voice immediately from over the phone, and suddenly jolted upright. “I was supposed to be saving you.”

He was a tall blonde man with a mustache, about as much as I’d expected, and he was accompanied by another man who wore a wide-brimmed hat. Both were armed with some form of assault rifle.

I suddenly felt like I had been caught with my pants down, shame rising within me.

“I-I saw him before, he was-” I began.

“Sh. We gotta get out of here kid, alright? We’ve already lost an officer to those monsters.”

*All because I got out of the car.* I thought, looking back shamefully at the pig. I picked up the hunting rifle and ran to the sheriff.

“You knew about all this?” I asked.

“Shut the fuck up.” Said the other officer. The sheriff said nothing. 

I motioned from the barn, from which whimpers of terror could still be heard. “Aren’t you going to help the people too?”

“People?” Asked the sheriff, looking at me sadly. “Those ain’t people no more, kid. If we were gonna save them, we’d burn that barn to the ground with them in it. That’d be the most humane thing to do, but we don’t have time. C’mon!”

The three of us snuck around the houses until we finally reached where the cops had parked, near the bonfire at the entrance to town.

There must have been about five cars, each of which had seemed to have brought at least three officers, the majority of whom I could see spraying lead into the houses, where the creatures were cowering.

The bodies of the new citizens of Orwell were scattered everywhere, including the other deer who had captured me, who had been shot in the back, sprawled face down on the ground.

As I watched, hiding between the houses like a coward, I saw the bear with his leaf pauldrons leap onto one of the cops, shredding him in half with his teeth, before roaring at the others.

“REMEMBER ME WHEN YOU ARE RAPING THE FORESTS YOU HAIRLESS MONKEYS!”

They took this opportunity to fire at him, one officer with a shotgun firing right into the bear’s face. The colossal beast collapsed, a gaping hole in his head.

We ran into the square, most of the cops having stopped firing.

“Alright folks, let's go!” Ordered the sheriff, getting into his car. “No time to get Jacobs and Anderson!”

Before I was hurried into a car, I saw one last body. It was one of the humans the animals had enslaved, a young, pretty girl who had caught a bullet right between her eyes. She was propped up with her head against a wall, dead eyes staring right at me.

I don’t remember much of the drive to Maypool. I felt like the president, with the other police cars speeding alongside ours away from the town.

I felt like one particular president, in fact when they started shooting at us, shots going waywire everywhere. While I was cowering in the backseat, the window smashing and spraying glass all over me, the image of the fox firing the gun came back into my head, and I began to laugh unstoppably and didn’t stop until we got to Maypool.

Nobody got hit, thankfully.

When we got to Maypool, they gave me fresh new clothes and some shitty food.

Everything felt so surreal after all that time in the dark town, the lights in the police station made my head hurt and my ears felt horribly heavy and warm, like all the blood had rushed to them.

I hadn’t really processed what had happened yet. It kind of felt as if I was trying to figure out what the worst thing I saw was. I still can’t really decide. Hell, I can’t decide what the worst thing I did was.

The sheriff told me everything I was legally allowed to know, which wasn’t much, and most of which I’d already pieced together from my experiences.

I’m sure you have as well, but essentially what he said was that at some point in the past year, the town of Orwell went dark, any contact with them was cut off, and nobody ever saw anyone who went to see what happened again. At one point, he said, a whole hunting party of a dozen who went into the woods all disappeared, their camp left in the woods.

He told me everyone had their own theories about what happened to the animals, but didn’t give me any solid evidence, only said that they’d been acting strange for months leading up to the takeover.

“What about the government?” I asked him after he’d told me everything. My voice was hoarse.

He sighed, shifting uncomfortably in his chair. “Hell, even I don’t know, kid. I know they know, that’s about all I can say.”

He then asked me what I’d seen. I told him everything up to when he found me.

He seemed pretty interested about the goat, got me to record what I heard and everything.

I can’t exactly remember the exchange, I was preoccupied.

See, as I was explaining what happened, I suddenly remember the child.

I’d left him there. I’d left that defenceless baby in Orwell.

Soon after that, they let me go. I got given some kind of NDA, a lift to my parents house and some bullshit story about my car breaking down.

My parents have noticed something’s up, I’m finding it hard to talk, or to do anything really. I guess I’m not feeling very jolly.

Jesus Christ, I hate the winter.

I’d like to end this on a good note or something. Maybe tell you that the government is going to send in the marines or bomb the town to hell, but I just don’t know. All I know that might relate to the subject are all the news reports I’ve seen about animals acting weird and the rapidly ascending numbers of disappearances in the area, and even those might be something different.

I’m just stuck here, in the dark, with no way to help, no way to do anything about all the suffering going on in Orwell, and no idea whether anyone is going to do anything about it.

I’m writing this at my parent’s house right now, in their living room. It has this big window through which you can see over the land, even the hills a little while away.

I don’t know why I chose to sit here, with all the wildlife you could see in this spot I’m basically asking to freak myself out.

I keep seeing animals and thinking that they’re looking at me, or that they move too strangely, too uncannily. The problem is, I can’t even figure out if I’m paranoid or I have reason to be concerned.

But that’s not what’s got me so freaked out.

See, an hour ago, my dad came up to me and told me to come with him to see something.

We went just up to the edge of his land, where you could see the hills. My mom was there already, recording something on her phone.

“Have you seen this? It’s crazy!” My mom said, turning around to look at me with a bewildered smile.

“Been on the news I think.” My dad said, his brow furrowed. “Didn’t think there’d be so many though, goddamn unbelievable.”

Dreading what I would see, I looked at what they were so intrigued by.

Just as I had thought, it was a herd of bison, congregating across the hills. That wasn’t the worst part, however.

“S’an odd way they’re moving, too.” My dad said, bemused. “All in single file, like…like an army or something.”
