I had just gotten back from a busy day at work, and was totally sleep deprived. I had a rough night of sleep and was ready to take my usual after-work nap. I got changed, and climbed into my comfy bed to finally get some rest. It didn’t take long for the dryer to start playing it’s end of cycle tune.

I was extremely confused, because I hadn’t even used my dryer in a week. I figured it was just malfunctioning, so I left it alone and quickly fell asleep thinking nothing of it. About 2 hours later, I woke up and the tune was still playing. 

Half-asleep, I dragged myself out of bed and went to go check on the dryer. Everything was plugged in correctly and nothing seemed out of the ordinary on the outside, until I checked the inside.

There were multiple severed body parts. Hands, arms, feet, it was all different parts of seemingly one person, my mother.

I was shocked. Staring in awe at what was left of my mom, I didn’t know what to do. If i had called the cops, they would obviously assume I did it and would send me to life in prison. I just sat in the laundry room, crying and in disbelief. I live alone, so who could have done this?

A phone call from my father interrupted my thoughts. On the other line, all i could hear was his exasperated words. He was crying, but I could make out the words “come…hospital..dead.” My mom was murdered and I was framed, and now I have to deal with another death. 

I quickly rushed to my car and frantically put in the keys. The entire way to the hospital, I was just contemplating on who it could be. I was already in enough distress, what could possibly make it worse? 

I pulled into the hospital and ran to the room that my father had texted me to go too. My entire family was there, even my cousins who I hadn’t talked to since I was little. I peeked into the hospital bed and saw my mom. My stomach dropped to the floor. 

“She had a heart attack, and no one was home. We found her on the floor by the time we got back.” My brother spoke, leaving me in even more wonder. I didn’t even want to go back to my apartment, but i didn’t want to be here either. I just ran to my car and sat in it, ignoring everyone who tried to speak to me on my way there. 

After about three hours of sitting in my car and crying, I decided to push through and drive back to my apartment. The journey back felt even longer this time, and the dryer tune was playing on repeat in my head. I pulled in the parking lot, and slowly walked inside, trembling more and more with each step. 

I stopped in front of the dryer, my mind wanting to see what was in it, but my body not letting me go. My mind won and i sprinted to the dryer and opened it.

There was nothing inside. Although i was still confused and overstimulated, I felt a little more relieved and I was trying to convince myself that I was just imagining it. 

I lay in bed that night, unable to sleep because of how scary and coincidental that situation was. I was able to doze off at some point and when I woke up, I was hoping that I had just dreamt the whole thing. 

I immediately knew that I hadn’t, as the dryer tune started playing once more. I froze. This time, I was much less hesitant to check because my curiosity got to the best of me.

More severed hands, limbs and the inside of the dryer was even more brutal this time. However, it was not my mother, but my father. 

The TV was playing in the background, and my brain was able to detect the word, “shooting”.  I ran over to it and saw my father’s workplace on the news. “4 victims, and more than 10 injuries.” The news reporter said, while displaying the 4 victims on the screen, one of them being my dad.

My phone started beeping uncontrollably, with hundreds of missed calls and thousands of missed texts. I ignored every single one.

This cycle carried on for weeks. Everyday was a new victim, each dryer scene being more brutal than the last. Whatever was haunting me, was slowly killing my entire family one by one. I don’t even know why I kept checking, it’s like something was drawing me closer to the dryer every day.

The dryer tune haunted me and ruined my life. Everywhere i went, I heard it, and every where I heard it, I checked. 
I tried to stop but, I just couldn’t. Something was not letting me.

That was, until, on June 6, 2024, when I heard the tune, went to check, and found myself inside.
