Morning light gently caressed her cheeks as her withered body rocked back and forth in the old wooden chair that most likely matched her with age.
Whether it was winter or summer, she was propped up on the chair, her absent eyes looking through the window out to the forest outside of the house, watching as the scenery slowly changed.
Flowers going from bloom to withering slowly in the winter just like her mind.

I began to forget how she was when I was little, back when she wasn't chained to the walls of the residence that she grew up in.
Her mind became painfully numb to the point where she didn't even recognize the face of her own daughter, but for some reason every time she saw me, something inside would light up.

In her weak, cranky voice that resembled more of a whisper, she would always ask me.

"You want a puppy?"

In fact, I wanted a puppy, back when I was much younger and she was also. 
I used to beg my parents for a dog whenever my birthday came around the corner but each time they would shoot the idea down, it didn't really matter how many times they explained to me that mum has some kind of allergy that would make her asthma way worst, I was too stubborn for that.

Her words hurt even more with each passing day that took me closer to my birthday, digging into my heart like shards of glass.

Seven days before my birthday someone knocked on our door. 
We didn't really get a lot of guests, especially since Grandma's illness began to eat her bit by bit more and more. Even if we got guests, they would quickly leave, sensing how rotten with illness the property was, as if it all grew and bred beneath the wooden floors. 
The guests who wouldn't leave immediately after arriving were ironically the guests we didn't want here. Dad called them vultures, going where they sensed death. 
They would always be polite, dressed in fresh vanilla suits, grinning their hyper-white teeth bleached to the extreme to the point it looked almost uncanny. 
Forcing their funeral services or generous offers of taking the house off our hands, down our throats like we weren't already choking on them.

Each time they came by, we would just swat away the flies that followed them behind in the form of business cards, almost as white as their teeth, as if they hatched from them. 

I assumed that as soon as I would open the door I would be flashed with yet another new but still very similar face with a row of fresh fake teeth, but I was wrong.

Where I expected an oversized suit was an abundance of empty space, beneath my feet was resting a fresh, colorful bouquet composed of wildflowers that I had never seen before.
I looked around in confusion, trying to catch a glimpse of whoever left them here, but all I saw were nearby trees gently being caressed by the morning wind. 

Nonetheless, I picked them up and brought them inside. On a closer inspection, that was a little card made of a thick piece of paper covered in flowery handwriting, a row of letters read out.

"My Condolences"

I rolled my eyes as soon as the words written on the card escaped from my lips, knowing too well who left it here. Vultures were here again and they were really trying their best to get under our skin.

I went to throw it out before my parents could get their hands on it, they had enough to worry about anyway and I didn't want to add to it all. 
My feet slipped into a pair of pink bunny slippers, and I slowly shuffled outside to throw them out. I pushed on the rusty metal lid of the container, but what do you know, the old thing jammed again.
I pushed again and again, feeling like my shoulder would give up before the stubbornness of the object ran out. In that moment, I heard a deep, energetic voice echo from between the containers.

"Did they wither already? My apologies"

I could only watch as the oversized suit I knew so well peeked from behind the dumpster, yet this time there was something different about it, something more uncanny.

"Please allow me to help"

The skin of the man was almost as pale as his suit, lips frozen in a constant state of an uncomfortable grin as if he wanted to show off every tooth inside of his mouth, well-pronounced cheekbones peeked from above the thin lips. 
The man looked grotesque, like a victim of a failed plastic surgery, but despite that, he had some weird charm. 

His pale hand grabbed the handle and pushed it hard, with one move the lid came open before he licked the palm of his hand and moved it along the wave of slick black hair.

"Is this some kind of a fucking joke?"

I raised my voice, practically throwing the flowers at him, as the man before me grabbed onto the flowers, clumsily stumbling backward, that perfect smile still not coming off his face.

"You don't know that"

I answered, at this point doubting my own stance on the matter. Seeing her wither before my eyes was painful, and deep down, I was hoping that she would die very soon.

His already wide smile seemed to get even wider.

"I know. I have a good nose for that"

He hissed from beneath the clenched teeth as his fingers grabbed the already small and almost unnoticeable nose. 
That was too much for me, as much as those vultures made my blood boil this one was the worst one yet.

"GET THE FUCK OUT OR IM CALLING THE COPS"

The grin didn't come off that plastic pale face of his. Instead, he just nodded, grabbed the leathery bag from between the trash, and began to make his exit.
A weird hissing noise followed behind him, a meek was his attempt at whistling without lips.

After the mysterious visit of the deformed condor, the old manor continued to stand, my grandmother sitting strong, fighting the silent battle against the illness contained within the walls. Her battle wasn't a heroic one, it wasn't a battle dealt between a knight and a dragon. You could describe a battle of a cancer patient that way, but not hers. It was more similar to a battle fought in World War I. It was all about claiming inches of land and not a grand victory or defeat.

It was all but a mare bouquet that shook the foundation of the house. 
The week before my birthday, someone knocked on the doors to our fortresses yet again. This time my father was unfortunate enough to get his hands on the gift.
He was a big, bulky man who had seen his fair share of horrible things back at his military service, which granted him an early retirement, yet still, this had some way of getting under his skin.

The flowers looked withered and began to rot in some spots, the same little piece of paper now with the writing scribbled out and a correction written underneath.

"Happy Birthday"

Day after day, no matter how many times we would throw the cursed gift into the void of the trash container, it always came back and each time it came back with double the strength.
For every flower we threw out the next day they would double or even triple in size. 
Our trash cans were filled with them as they rotted away, filling the surrounding area with this sweet odor that stuck to clothes and hair. 

In every bouquet was a card that suited the occasion, but still every single one couldn't be further from my actual age. It seemed like these cards were just snatched at random, from people of all ages.

The day of my birthday crept around the corner soon enough. Mum went to town to buy me a little cake with baby blue frosting on top, it wasn't much but we couldn't afford anything special anyway.
That evening we gathered around the table, Grandma taking a spot at one end of the table next to the window from which she overlooked the garden.

I usually didn't look at her face directly, I guess I was just too afraid to see what I would see but now I was forced to look.
A small frame of the husk of the woman I knew barely showed from above the wooden table. 
Her wrinkled face crooked to the side, illuminated in the warm light of the candles, little flames dancing across her milky, glazed-over eyes not focused on anything really.

The party went peacefully until someone knocked at the door, a rhythmic, cheerful knock, barely noticeable.

I pointed it out right before we cut into the cake, and my dad went to answer the door. I was expecting yet another barrage of flowers, but this time, between his Hands, was resting a small box wrapped in an old newspaper with a bow on top.

We ate the cake and enjoyed our time spent together as a family that might soon be smaller, but my eyes kept eyeing the little newspaper box as if it was calling me to, begging me to rip off its skin and get to its insides.
As tempting as it was, I made sure that I held my urges on a short leash, not letting my excitement overwhelm me.
I opened the presents one after another. It was a small batch of whatever my parents thought I might enjoy and could afford.

It was finally time to open the newest gift. 
I took it closer and examined it.
Held it up to my ear as something inside rattled.
The newspaper was old, the small, smeared font mentioned the year 2000 somewhere, the year where I was born. The paper was neatly wrapped around the box that with its shape most likely resembled a shoe box. The paper came off easily, layer after layer peeled off revealing the light brown surface of the box The lid off I quickly took off,  revealing what was hiding inside. 

It contained a small brown mascot made of old rags; the stitches present on the material were very much visible, no matter how many layers of something that most closely resembled glue were put on it and covered with what looked like brown streaks of hair.

The lifeless thing rested between my hands as I lifted it out of the box. The more I looked at it, the more apparent it became what kind of animal it was supposed to resemble.

Two floppy ears hung from the sides of its head, crooked black eyes bulging out of its sockets.

It was a dog.

At the same moment as the realization hit me, something else hit my ears, a soul-shattering scream I had never heard before. 
My head instinctively turned to the source of the sound, my parents looked shocked even more than that, what was present on their faces was more closely resembling fear mixed with surprise.

My eyes laid on hers.
Milky and glassy, tears streaming down her face, jaw unhinged into an unnaturally large smile that showed the collection of teeth barely holding down to their spots in the pink array of gums.

It was my grandmother, she was screaming and at the same time crying. Her frail body trembled as it began to lift itself from the chair she was cursed to stay in for eternity.
She was screaming the same phrase over and over again not caring to even take a breath in between, as her lungs began to run out of air and the voice coming from inside her became more and more weak.

"YOU GOT IT"

She screamed once again as now the skeleton wearing the frail paper-thin skin of a person I once loved rose from its seat taking a small step towards me, sticks that were its legs trembling like of a newborn deer, before her body fell to the floor with a loud Crack pulling whatever was on the table with her.

The scream stopped as abruptly as it started as if it was cut with a knife. For a long moment, we all couldn't move from our seats, staring into each other before my mum slowly and calmly stood up with her voice just above a whisper as if she didn't want to wake her mother up.

"I will call an ambulance"

From a cracked opened window I could hear a slow whistle carried by the wind.

I barely remember what happened after that.
The yellow ambulance drove up to our driveway as if they already knew there was nothing to save, made their way up to our living room, and told us what we already knew long before they arrived.

The funeral was held a couple of days after that.
Funeral service tried their best to hide that hideous smile that now was permanently pained across her face but made it a lot worse each time.
With each layer of makeup, she was getting closer to a dead clown rather than a victim of Dementia.

Not many people attended the burial ceremony. It was just me, my parents, the local priest, and the man who leveled the coffin into the ground.

Grandma was always a loner especially since she moved to that old house she grew up with and after time her illness forcefully moved our family out there too.

At first, we were supposed to stay there for a week or two before we got someone to take care of her in a long but slowly overtime our things switched places from our little place to this mansion till we were finally forced to stay, and everything we owned was stained with this distinct smell of old age.
The only thing that didn't fall victim to it was the dog plushie I received on that horrible night of my birthday.

It smelled nostalgic, like a mixture of dust and old cheap plastic and its insides were hard and heavy if it was filled up with little pebbles that were ready to burst open like a spider egg any moment I held him, which I didn't do very often. 
Most of his time he spent sitting on the highest shelf that was hanging above my bed. Though his weirdly big budging eyes watching over me while I slept was oddly comforting to some extent.

He stayed with me for the next few months, fulfilling his role as a guard dog almost perfectly when despite what I believe to be his best efforts letting the familiar illness creep through our defenses yet again, challenging another person into an unfair battle that could only end one way.

It started small, she would forget what she had to buy at the store, walking into a room without even a hint of why she walked in. That soon enough turned into endless wandering around the house and calling her long-gone mum.
In sudden moments of clarity, I could hear her sobbing, usually in the middle of the night. 
I could almost hear every tear she shed hitting the wooden floors before the cries would suddenly stop without much reason or explanation.

One night she cried more than usual, she sobbed and whined before it was cut short as usual but this time I could hear the stairs leading upstairs slowly creek followed by a very quiet sound of wet skin sticking to the floor. What was even weirder was the fact that the sound came in pairs like whoever was making their way upstairs was walking not only on their feet but also hands.

The door to my room whined slowly as it was pushed open, at this point my eyes were shut tight.

Wet steps got closer and closer to me before I could feel something heavy step on the side of the bed, changing the weight distribution around as whoever that was leaned forward, picking something off the highest shelf as the item made a rattling noise.

The weight shifted again, as it stepped off my bed before I heard a short sniff of a runny nose followed by the most disgusting noise I ever heard in my entire life.

The sound of chewing and cracking that came in quick almost rapid successions, slurping and dripping echoed through the darkness, mixing with frantic wheezing, as the cold air hardly went through the person's mouth.

I quickly rose and turned on the light in a panic.

Before me was standing my mother.
Her eyes were red and wild, her hands clutched around the plushie, and her mouth dripping with blood like water from a tap straight into the floor, creating a bloody soup beneath her feet.
And that's when I noticed it.
My plushie was gutted, strings of whatever was used to saw it up hanging below like guts, what I assumed to be pebbles that once filled it now scattered across the floor.

"I don't want to forget you"

My mother sobbed, splitting her own blood and pieces of broken teeth into the floor before her arms clenched around me so tight, I could almost feel my guts coming up to my throat.
The last time she hugged me so tightly was when I won the running contest at my old school.

I sank into the warmth of It, of the hot blood soaking into my clothes and now blanket in a color of rust, finding odd comfort in it all.

And as suddenly as she wrapped herself around me as suddenly she pushed me away, with a gentle blow of withering strength.
Her bloodshot eyes fixated on the ripped-apart rag that once resembled a caricature of a dog, jaw clenching on what was left of her teeth, before with what rage was left inside of her, she threw the plush against the wall with such hatred and malice the remaining filling exploded into the air, sending a wave of white pebbles against the floor that landed with rhythmic noise that resembled rain hitting on a glass window.

Ripped apart, a material corpse, slung to the floor immediately sinking with blood, as his killer lazily made her way to the exit.

Crooked and unnatural, wheezing and coughing up bits of gore and shattered bone as she went away, wobbling from side to side with each wet and rhythmic step.

I waited for the footsteps to finally stop, till the wet echo turned into silence before I made my escape.
I followed behind the bloody footsteps, trying my best to not step into a warm poodle of gore, as I entered the empty corridor and headed to the stairway where family members I didn't know. Framed faces I didn't know to who they belonged to stared down at me.

I managed not to break my neck on the slippery steps, and as I made my way towards the front door, someone got there before me.
The gate to the sickening scenario was wide open inviting guests in, only a string of moonlight cracked through, illuminating the bloody prints left behind by the escapee.

My mum already left, and maybe it was for the better. 

The gate closed and locked before I myself dragged my body back up the stairs to my room. 
I made my way straight through the poodle of blood, picking up what remained of my plushie, its now gutted, flat pelt stared back at me with its huge black eyes.
And despite it all, I still hugged it tightly, all it soaked up draining over my hands and arms, 
my own guard dog as things were always supposed to be.

My cold body instinctively slid under the blankets for safety only to slowly drift into sleep.

As suddenly as I fell asleep as suddenly I was woken up by my father, pulling me out of bed with such force I was scared my arm would fall out of its socket, I didn't even have time to grab into the plush remains, leaving it on the bed as it looked back at me with his black buldging eyes.

The world around me was fuzzy but I was still conscious enough to make out shapes.
As I looked down I saw my father's heavy work boots and whatever was underneath them, crunching like eggshells under the weight of his body.
In the soft light of the waking-up world, I could finally make out what I assumed to be pebbles before, now turning more clearly into small perfectly white, and rounded teeth, that in a moment's notice disappeared from my vision as I was pulled out of the room.

Dad pulled me through the house, down a treacherous pair of stairs, passing by the living room and the old rocking chair present inside of it, prepped up by the window as always with a soft fuzzy shape filling the seat.

We went straight to the car, without even closing the front door. 
I took a seat beside him in the front, which was usually reserved for Mum before we drove off, heading up the old dirt road passing by rows and rows of dead trees that seemed to get greener as we went further away from the house. 
I didn't ask him what was happening or where we were going, I sat in silence the entire way.
It felt like we drove for hours like we were stuck in a constant loop of left and right turns that led to nowhere but places that looked the same as the previous ones before we finally hit the familiar road, the one that led to our real home.

The feeling of finally stepping back inside of our home was unreal, even if it was empty and bare.
Our apartment felt tiny compared to where we came from, more of a nest than a mansion.
The noise of passing cars behind my bedroom window would wake me up each time, I got used to the sweet sound of silence and the occasional cracks of the house setting.

Sometimes, after work, dad would go back to grandma's place just to fetch some of our old things back, and each time he came back carrying it into our flat his face looked pale and drained. 
Somedays, he would drive back and come back empty-handed. Those days, he wouldn't even bother to walk into the house, he would just sit on the porch staring down the empty dirt road waiting for Mum to crawl back into his arms.

Days passed, and we both lost hope we would see her again, it was easier to accept the fact her body was being eaten piece by piece by wild animals, than to imagine her still wandering the wilderness in the maniac state I last saw her in.

But unfortunately, she did survive.
Local police officer was nice enough to knock on our door in the middle of the dinner and, with that disgustingly wide smile on his face, inform us that she was indeed alive.

A lot of people who live around these parts call it a miracle, the fact she survived in the wilderness all on her own with her mind already long gone.
But to us it was all but a miracle, more of a God's most cruel joke.

 I remember visiting her at the hospital.
An old building outside of town that with its massiveness matched one of a cathedral that was ready to collapse at any given moment under the weight of its age and sorrows it carried.
Inside it was cold and unfriendly, paint chipped off the walls revealing orange brick walls that stood proudly against the passing of time climbing high towards the ceiling almost like they were the fundamentals of heaven itself, keeping it in place, from falling upon our heads.

I followed Dad up the stone steps that lead higher and higher, passing by dirty old windows that failed to keep the wind at bay, letting it whip the backs of the passersby like it was a punishment for letting our loved ones stay here. 
We finally followed down a white sterile corridor that led us to a larger white room that at least tried to look pleasing with its cheap sets of chairs and tables, each topped off with a plastic lifeless plant that seemed to mimic the patients with their state of activity.
Big windows lined one of the walls, bathing the room in natural light and reminding the patient of the freedom they were stripped off, even if someone had a bright idea of reclaiming it the frames of the windows didn't seem to hold any visible handles.

And there she was, forced into a metal wheelchair just like her own mother, forced to overlook the lost freedom she won't ever be able to reclaim for herself. If it wasn't for the slow frantic movement of her chest I would take her for another cheap plastic piece of decor, maybe an out-of-season Halloween decoration holding a bowl of pills on her lap. 
The back of her head, once full of dirty blond hair now was cut short like one of a prisoner, full of bald greyish spots. 
Dad was brave enough to walk closer to her and stand by her side, but even a man who had seen so many horrible things in his lifetime seemed to be shaken by the pure rot that can overtake human form. 
His usually rough and deep voice now spoke softly, just above a whisper just as if he didn't want to wake her up.

“Amanda is here”

His lips formed into a pathetic forced smile as his hand pointed directly at me, giving me some courage to step closer.
I couldn't bring myself to call whatever was sitting in front of me, my own mother. What was left of her was a hollow husk of skin and bone, sunken in eyes that seemed to roll around her head like if she was following an invisible fly flying around the room, waiting for the perfect moment to lay its tooth-shaped eggs under her skin. That invisible insect landed on me a few times during our short visit.
Those sunken in eyes would lock into mine for just a few quick moments as her thin pale lips turned into a crooked smile that revealed a row of empty gums where her broken teeth once resided before the fly would go back into circling the room.

I guess she really did remember me after all, and her last wish was fulfilled.

I know what awaits me, I know that I'm next in the line, and it's only a matter of time before those rotting flowers begin to appear at the footstep of our door warning me about my fate of becoming a prisoner of my own body.

It is all in the blood, after all.
And like all flowers, I'm too forced to wither and rot away.
My final wish is for my dad to forgive me for what I'm about to do.
To understand why this flower died in it's bloom.
