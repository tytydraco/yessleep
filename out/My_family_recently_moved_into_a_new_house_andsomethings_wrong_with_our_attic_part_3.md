Hey guys. My service is a bit spotty right now so.. I'm not too sure if this will actually post. Hopefully, by some miracle, it reaches you guys.

if you haven't seen the past parts, here the link to [Part2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1806qf7/my_family_recently_moved_into_a_new_house/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) to catch you up

&#x200B;

A lot of you were telling me going to that old school was a bad idea, and yes, I know it is. Whatever it is though,  It keeps bringing me back there, and I need to know why. It doesn't seem to like the idea of me going to the building either, so I think it might have a clue on how to defeat..whatever it is.

Despite all your warnings, did I end up going? Yes. Was it a bad idea? Most definitely. Is it my only hope for survival..? Sadly, yes.

I'm getting too ahead of myself though, let's backtrack. Last update I realized didn't mention much about the activity, so i'm going to update you guys on that.

Of course, as expected, it's only gotten worse.About a week ago, it began rattling the doorknob. I've tried to reinforce it with chairs, superglue..whatever i could think of but…a few days ago, i found my efforts had no effect. The doorknob had come loose and to my horror, the attic door was swinging wide open at the top of the stairwell.

I know it was a bad idea but my curiosity got the best of me, and I decided to see what was inside the attic.

The room was..an absolute mess. The walls were covered in scratch marks and dried blood, bones of small rodents littering the floor. Messages were written across the entire room, even on the ceiling.After I took a quick look around, I found a key, which seemed untouched. The only area in that attic that seemed fine was the area around that key. I quickly grabbed the key and got  the hell out of there.

It took me a while to process the fact that whatever it was, it was out.. And it was freely roaming around my house.

After that, it began leaving messages for me. On my door, below my bed, even in the fucking fridge.The messages are in a variety of things, dead mice, crow feathers, blood, burn marks, you name it. I've begun locking my door at night and I constantly wake up to hear it scratching at my door, pleading for me to let it in with a gurgly voice, like its lungs were filled with water.

When I check my door in the morning, there's bloody scratches dug into the frame. I have to spend an hour just so I can clean them up, otherwise they begin to smell horrendous.

My dog’s stopped eating, she barely sleeps too. I think she knows about it and has a stronger sense of the danger than I do. She stays in the corner of the living room, and no matter what, we can't get her to leave that corner. Not even her favorite toys will get her out of that corner, and she's begun to lose weight. I need to figure out how to get out of this situation, and fast.

I've been getting less and less sleep too, and it's starting to take a toll on me. I can no longer think clearly, and I've been skipping school. Sometimes I don't know whether I'm imagining something due to lack of sleep, or if it's that…thing.. Trying to get to me again.

The nightmares keep getting more vivid. I’ve been making more progress in getting my way around the school though, and finding good places to hide from it until I wait for dawn. The more I explore the building, the more off it feels. It feels out of place. I looked up the desks and the only similar ones I found were desks they use in Russian schools..but this is the middle of Ohio?

In one of my nightmares, I actually ended up making it out of the school for the first time. After walking off of the porch, I went down the dirt road that led me up to a huge well. It's not some little house well, no, it's like the size of a driveway. It had a concrete block atop the opening,which was locked with chains. As I got closer, I could hear something under the concrete, inside the well, but  before I could explore further, I woke up.

After that, I woke up to something dripping on my face. When I opened my eyes, I saw a hole in my ceiling and..something drooling on me. I think my soul left my body in that moment out of fear.It had pale skin that clung to its frame like wet cloth. Its eyes were deep and sunken, staring at me with hunger. Its mouth was tight, frozen in a sickening smile.

It giggled, its drool dripping down to my face.I didn't stick around to see any more, and bolted out of my room.What I saw was enough to haunt my dreams for lifetimes to come.

I ran to my bathroom, locking myself in there until dawn. I don't know what it is about us humans, but for some reason we feel safe when there's light.

Soon as morning hit, I packed my stuff and headed for the building. I was tired of all this. I need to figure out how to get it to leave me alone.

At around 5 am, right when the sun was peeking over the distant hills, I began walking to the old school. I didn't have a car to drive in so I had decided to just walk there. I brought about 3 days worth of food, a few flashlights, a candle, and that key I found.. just in case.

I could hear its screams in the distance, footsteps as it followed me. It never got close, it always stayed behind the brush. Every time it got a little too close, the pendant on my necklace would begin to burn, leaving a pentagram shape burn on my chest. The walk was eerie, listening to its howls in the distance.

Sometimes I wonder why it doesn't just kill me.

It took me about an hour to arrive at the building. I know I said it was about 20 minutes away, but that's by car.

As soon as I got to the dirt road, I noticed the concrete well. The chains had been broken and..there was a split through the middle. I turned on my flashlight, illuminating the dark depths beneath, and that's when I saw it. A face, staring right back at me, with that same sickening smile plastered on its face.

I ran, as fast as I could, I could hear it clawing its way out, its screams taunting me. I ran up to the porch, and burst through the doors, looking for an area to hide.

I've always hated spiders and been terrified of them, but at this moment, the spiderwebs were the least of my worries. Cobwebs clung to my clothes as I ran through the empty halls, searching for a room where I could rest and recuperate.

I swiftly turned a corner into an empty room, hiding behind it and clasping my hands against my mouth, trying to soften the sound of my gasps of horror.

*The entire building was bleeding*.

Crimson blood was seeping through the walls, the paint peeling off under the pressure. The house seemed to groan in pain as more and more blood spilled out of the walls.I sat on the floor, covering my mouth as I shut my eyes, trying to prevent myself from having a panic attack in this hell-hole.

I could hear its screams outside, surrounding the building. There was more than one, and they were after me.

After a few minutes, I looked around, lighting a candle for some sense of security.Even though I knew it was daytime when I entered, when I looked out the window…it was pitch black, as if it was midnight.

There were no sounds. No crickets, no owls, nothing. Just the howls and screams of the creatures in the distance.I carefully began exploring the building, taking out the map I had drawn from memory. Just as I thought, it matched up perfectly.

I began roaming the halls, listening for any footsteps that weren't my own, just in case.I soon found the room I was hoping for. Inside, there was a closet, and about 10 of these heavy, Russian desks. The reason I wanted to get to this room was specifically because it still had working locks, and their emergency fire hatchet was stored in here, hung in the classic red case against the wall.

I've been staying here for a few days now. I mostly just stay in this room, hatchet in hand. I've begun boarding up the windows and I've run out of food. I can't get any sleep, in fear it'll jump out at me, laughing at me with that horrid smile on its face, like it's taunting me.And it is. It's taunting me.

They watch me from outside, standing behind the locked doors. All they do is stare..it gets on my nerves.

They just stare at me, blankly…laughing. Laughing at me.

I've searched the closet for any clues, and I found records from when the building was being built. Sure enough, the building was in fact not very old, only being built around 15 years ago.

The only issue with the documents was that…they were in Russian.

Now, I know, it took me a while to figure it out too. After a few minutes of cursing, trying to get service, and using google translate, I was able to figure out what language it was.

I've been spending the last day and a half translating the documents, and transcribed below are the ones that I thought would be significant.

now, I will warn you... the following entries are graphic.

**August 12th, 2009**

*The project starts today.I still don't understand why they sold us the land for so cheap, but ey, I'm just doin what the boss is tellin me to., so i really shouldn't press for answers.We got the blueprints ready and today is the day when we start construction. The plot has already been cleared out and prepped.I've been told this is gonna be a new school, pretty high tech too. I'm surprised our government has enough funding for a school like that.Lot of the locals have been tellin us to stop our work, saying the plot is ‘cursed’ or some shit like that. Honestly  I couldn't care less, I'm just doin my job. As long as I get paid, I don't care.*

*Work’s boutta start, so I should probably go check and make sure we got all our supplies in line.*

&#x200B;

**August 18th, 2009**

*Boris called out of work today, typical. Its just me and the 13 other guys here, but i'm sure we can get plenty of work done.We keep hearin weird noises comin from the prairie but this is Russia, it's probably just some raccoon dogs or somethin. We got guns just in case so, doesn't really matter anyways.The locals keep interfering with the build. We’ve started having a few of our men stand guard at the end of the trail to prevent them from coming and disrupting our progress.*

&#x200B;

**September 25th, 2009**

\*Been a while since i updated the log, apologies. The works goin well, we got the frame up and we are starting to plaster the walls. We are also starting to lay down the brick patio, just as the boss requested.Tomorrow we are gonna put down the base for the patio.After that, we are gonna cover up for the winter, packin everything down so the elements don't get too bad.\***June 28th, 2010**

*construction has resumed, since the warm months are back. We’ve installed the window frames, and we are putting the window panes themselves in today.*

*A few of our men have been calling out sick, I suppose there's a flu going around. Rumors have started in the crew that the locals were right, but who's gonna believe that. They probably just had a little too much to drink.Boris ended up falling off our ladder on Monday, we are holding a funeral for him this Saturday. May his soul rest in peace, the ol' man didn't deserve a death like that.*

&#x200B;

**June 19th, 2010**

*A lot more of our men have been falling sick, so often it's only 8-9 of us workin on the building at once. What's worse, We keep findin dead cats on the site too, and animal control is getting tired of us calling in. We've started having to take care of em ourselves, disposing of the bodies in the prairie.They just keep showing up, and each one is getting weirder and weirder. At first they were normal, looked to have died of natural causes. Now, they're all..mangled. Their ribs are stabbin outta their sides and their eyes are bulging or somethin. It's gotten to the point that we just stop lookin at em and throw em out into the prairie.*

*We’ve started installing the roofing, and putting up the bases and supports for the patio.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**August 7th, 2010**

*I'm starting to think the locals were right, and we really shouldn't be buildin on this property.A lot more of our men are callin out sick, or havin nightmares of this creature with a weird smile. Lot of em can't get to sleep at night cuz of these nightmares, and a few of em swear they can hear it laughing at them when they’re alone.We’re working on the stairwell, and installing the lighting systems. The lights keep goin on, and I don't know whether its because we are bad electricians, or if it's that thing.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**August 29th, 2010**

*We’ve begun installing the chalkboards, and brought the desks in.Despite how much I plead, the higher ups insist on continuing construction.*

*God, I need a beer, this is getting to be too much.*

*I'm startin to have the nightmares now too, and I know why the other men were so scared. Its skin is so thin.. It's like it's made out of paper mache, with  Its mouth stuck in this freaky grin.*

&#x200B;

**November 15th, 2010**

*It's just the 4 of us left. The rest have either quit, gone to a mental facility or died.despite this, the boss INSISTS on continuing the project.*

*We’ve got most of it done, installed the doors, and plumbing. We are workin on carrying the piano upstairs today.  Man, who even needs a grand piano in a school?*

*I've picked up drinking again, it's the only way I can escape my job.*

&#x200B;

**November 17th, 2010**

*I can hear it outside my window.It's laughing at me, giggling like some little kid.It's calling for me to come outside, it wants to play.Its voice is…wrong. There's just something wrong with it.I can't get any sleep, knowing it's out there, waiting for me.It's just staring at me through the window..*

&#x200B;

**November 21st, 2010**

*I haven't left my house, and neither has it. The laughing got louder, and I think it's starting to grow impatient. It just keeps staring at me with those blank eyes, slowly clawing against the window.I'm running out of food.*

&#x200B;

**November 23rd**

*Oh god, oh god. It's not at the window. I let myself get a few minutes of shut eye and it disappeared, it's gone!*

*..I just heard the door.*

*I think..I think it's inside.*

*Oh god it's inside.*

*I can hear it, my cat heard it too and..Oh god…my cat…Its…*

*its here*

*Its face is.. Oh god*

*What's wrong with its legs they’re… they’re bent the wrong way and it's just.. It's just staring at me*

*It's..giggling.*

*Why is it..laughing?*

*Why wont it stop laughing..Make it stop laughing..*

&#x200B;

**November 23rd, 4:23am**

*It's been staring at me for hours…I don't know what it wants.The more it stares the more I start to feel sick. I think it's waiting for me to fall asleep.*

&#x200B;

**November 25th, 2:31 am**

*I've been two days now, and I don't know how much longer I can stay awake. It hasn't moved, sometimes I wonder if it's dead, but then it starts giggling, reminding me of its never-ending presence.I haven't been able to move from where I am now, since it's blocking the doorway, meaning I can't get any food or water.At this point I don't know whether I'll starve to death or fall asleep first. Either way, I'll be at the mercy of that…thing.*

&#x200B;

**November 26th, 5:03am**

*I can't, I can't stay awake any longer.Every time i close my eyes I can hear it, watching me, waiting but.. I can't stay awake anymore I..I just can't.****November 27th, 7:32am****I thought I would be dead by now I.. I thought it would’ve killed me,but no, it's still just standing there on all fours, staring at me.My stomach has begun to hurt though. I don't know whether it’s the lack of food, water, or if i'm starting to get sick..*

&#x200B;

**9:19am**

*I'm starting to get all shivery, and I feel dizzy, I feel like I'm going to vomit..I tried to get past the thing to get water and it..let me. I saw my cat in the hallway and…i..I got some water and sat on my couch, trying to ignore the stench of my cat's rotting corpse from behind the wall. The creature followed me into the living room, sitting on the floor and watching me closely.Why doesn't it kill me?****12:03pm****I've started vomiting, and it's progressively getting worse. I've never felt this sick before in my life. I don't know how I'm still vomiting, my stomach is empty but it just keeps coming out…*

&#x200B;

**3:43pm**

*My stomach hurts even more now, and it's beginning to bulge out. I don't know what's wrong with me. It feels like something’s moving inside of me. God it hurts, please i.. I just want it to stop..****5:27pm****I can see them now. I can see them crawling underneath my skin, absorbing my nutrients. It sees them too, and it's giggling. God it hurts I just..I just want this to be over please make it stop…*

&#x200B;

**6:01pm**

*They're…making their way..out..god it hurts I.. Please just kill me already..there's so many… the creature is just staring, laughing as its children dig their way out of my gut, towards their mother.. Please..please make it stop..I can't take this..*

&#x200B;

That was the ending of the documents. After November 15th, they were handwritten instead of typed, and it seemed more like a diary.

After reading that, I vomited In disgust. I..what the fuck.. Am I dealing with? At least I don't have to worry about getting in this room.. for now.

I can still hear them pacing outside. They seem to communicate in a way similar to wolves, hunting in packs.

It seems from the documents that their existence has something to do with this building, and the disruption of the land.

What I find odd is the fact that in the building documents, there's no mention of the well outside at all…

I'm going to get some rest and.. In the morning I'm going to go investigate the well. I don’t really have any other options at this point.

It's either I die here waiting, or I die out there, trying to escape.

&#x200B;

Until then….
