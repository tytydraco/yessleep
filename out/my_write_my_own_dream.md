Matt was a calm and sensible boy. One morning, he was busy doing his chores at home when his mother called out, "Matt, put this stuff away." While he was working, a notification popped up on his phone: \*"Your 12th exam starts from 11th Nov."\*  
He checked the exam center-Dabbanja. It was quite far from his home.

He said to his mother, "Mom, the exam center is far. I'll have to stay there."  
His mother replied, "One of your friends lives there. You can stay at her place."  
Matt nodded. "Okay."

The next morning, Matt boarded the bus. Cool air brushed against his face through the window, but there was a strange restlessness in his heart-as if something bad was about to happen.

When the bus reached Dabbanja, he opened the map on his phone and followed the address straight to his friend's house. The house was in a narrow lane-old, but clean. Inside lived his friend, her parents, a younger brother, and a small child.

Everything seemed normal, but the moment Matt stepped inside the house, he felt something unusual-a vibration-like sensation, as if something in the air was shifting. Somewhere, a faint bell-like sound echoed; at times, the furniture seemed to move slightly on its own. A strange doubt crept into his mind:  
\*"Something here feels different..."\*

He felt as if there was a hidden energy inside the house-something concealed among everyone, quietly observing them.

It was the first time Matt had felt such strange vibrations, but he assumed it was just travel fatigue and ignored it. Radika's mother had prepared a room for him.  
"Son, this is your room. Food will be ready in a while. Rest till then," she said with a gentle smile.

Matt unpacked his belongings and arranged them neatly. He was supposed to stay there for a full seven days.  
The next morning was his exam-7 a.m. to 11 a.m., a total of four hours.

\*\*The night felt unusually heavy.\*\* Matt sat on the bed, scrolling through his phone, when suddenly strange visuals began flashing in his mind-an image of a dark cave where a man was hanging upside down. From deep inside the cave came a low, rumbling sound, as if someone was breathing.

Matt blinked hard. "Am I dreaming?" he wondered. But the visuals didn't disappear. Panicking, he played a song on his phone to distract himself. The moment the music started, the frequency reversed-the notes twisted, as if the song had been broken or corrupted.

His heart started racing. He immediately locked his phone. At that exact moment, a call came in-it was Radika's mother. Her voice sounded completely normal.  
"Son, dinner is ready. Come downstairs."

Matt put the phone down, but one thought kept echoing inside him:  
\*"That wasn't normal..."\*

He went downstairs. Everyone was seated at the table-Radika, her parents, her younger brother, and a small child. Radika's mother brought the food, served everyone, and sat down herself.

Her father smiled and asked, "Son, how is your studying going?"  
Matt replied in a normal tone, "It's going fine, uncle."

That was all he said-and suddenly the entire table felt strange. Radika's father said something, but it was in a bizarre language-like an ancient dialect Matt couldn't understand. Then Radika and her mother started speaking the same language. Matt sat silently. Their faces were completely blank, almost lifeless.

After a while, everyone finished eating as if nothing unusual had happened. Radika smiled and said, "Let me know if you need anything."  
Matt simply nodded. "No, everything is fine."

As he walked back toward his room, he noticed something disturbing-two doors past his room, a red liquid was seeping out from under another door. It looked like blood or paint, but it had a metallic smell.

His heart pounded. He slowly moved closer to take a look, when suddenly someone grabbed his shoulder from behind. He turned around-it was Radika's younger brother. His eyes were completely white.

In a cold, emotionless voice, he said,  
"Don't go there..."

\*\*Matt staggered back in shock and ran straight to his room. Terrified, he collapsed onto the bed.  
He didn't know how, but he fell asleep.\*\*

When he woke up in the morning, everything seemed normal. He got ready, came downstairs, and had breakfast. Her father asked, "Did you sleep well last night, son?"  
Matt couldn't respond. His mind was flooded with flashes from the night-the red liquid, the white eyes, and that strange language.  
He silently nodded and left the house. As soon as he stepped outside, a thought struck him:  
\*"Was all of that a dream... or did it really happen?"\*

While walking down the road, a boy bumped into him-it was his friend, whose exam center was the same.  
"Hey Matt! You too at this center?" he said.  
Matt forced a smile. "Yeah, but man... last night was strange."

His friend asked, "What happened?"  
Matt stayed quiet, because even he didn't know-was that night a dream, or a warning?

After finishing their exams, Matt and his friend returned. The house was completely empty. Only the small child was running around. Both of them followed him. Suddenly, the gate slammed shut.  
Matt shouted, "Open the door!"  
No one answered.

Then darkness fell.

When he opened his eyes, he was lying on a bed. Naked. His hands and feet were tied. Radika's entire family stood around him, their faces completely blank. The same small child was standing above him.

As the child moved, something thick and viscous oozed out of his body-a dark, oily shape. Slowly, that shape began forming into a small humanoid figure. Matt saw the cave vision again-the same dark cavern, and the man hanging upside down.

Within the vision, he heard an ancient story, rushing directly into his mind:  
"Several hundred years ago, this..."

\*\*Near the village, there was a well.\*\* People had buried their fear and wounds there. One night, when the villagers merged their voices into a single rhythm, the movement of a spirit began to vibrate. That sound slowly became solid.  
It spoke: \*"I desire resonance. Anyone who syncs with my frequency will become mine."\*

For the first time, it used a child's scream to touch flesh and carve its path. Since then, the red liquid began to appear-the mark of condensed vibration. Whoever touched it would open the link.

Pain surged through Matt's body. His bones felt as if they were grinding from the inside. His eyes started turning white. He tried to distract himself by playing music on his phone, but the song played in reverse-the notes twisted backward. It was a frequency inversion-the gateway to syncing with \*\*Chhalan\*\*.

The dark entity tried to enter Radika's mother through the small child. The moment it entered, her face changed. Her voice was no longer human. Everyone began screaming in a guttural, ancient tongue.

The pressure on Matt's body increased. His eyes turned completely white. Pain like breaking bones tore through him. He felt something forcing its way into his back. Then he saw it-the dark shape entering his ribs like a semi-corporeal root.

Outside, his friend began knocking violently. No one opened the door. He climbed in through the window. But what he encountered inside was no longer human.  
Matt snapped his friend's neck without hesitation. Then he calmly sat at the table and started eating.

Everyone was around him. They were screaming, but their voices were no longer human sounds-only resonance.

In the vision, Matt understood everything in greater detail. \*\*Chhalan was not a demon's name, but a pattern.\*\*

\* \*\*Origin:\*\* collective grief + repeated resonant rituals  
\* \*\*Motive:\*\* spread  
\* \*\*Mechanism:\*\* vision → frequency inversion → physical anchor (red liquid) → transfer → emotional amplification → network formation  
When the host panics, the link grows stronger.

Matt was now half-possessed. His voice was flat. He looked at his friend's body and attacked without emotion. Sitting on the table, he ate as if everything were normal.

On his face was the same smile from the ancient cave.
