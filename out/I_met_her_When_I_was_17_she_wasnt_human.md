I was 17 when I had my first run-in with something not quite right.

I was waiting for my bus to show up. I don’t remember it quite as clearly as I used to—my mind’s not what it once was—but I could never forget that bus route. It was the only one that went from my job at a rundown McDonald’s (which, tragically, was the best fast food option within 50 miles) back to my home. Route 75.

It wouldn’t be unusual to find me standing a little ways off from the stop or pretending to look at my phone. At the time, it felt like social suicide if people found out I was 17 and still didn’t have a license. I know now it wasn’t such a big deal, but when you’re that age, everything feels world-ending.

It was a sunny day for the PNW, I remember that. The AC unit at our McDonald’s had broken, and the smell of cheap fries and sweat had mixed into something close to a toxin—one that stuck in your nose for days. The kind of weather that would make someone from the East Coast throw on a coat, but around here, people were pulling out tank tops.

I was sitting on the bench waiting, head down, when I saw her for the first time.

She was across the street. Skin pale and smooth like porcelain. From the angle of the light, it looked like her eyes weren’t even there—just holes. I wasn’t wearing my glasses, so at first I thought it was a trick of the sun.

It wasn’t.

It took me nearly two whole minutes to realize I was staring. And let me be clear: I’m not the kind of guy who stares at women, especially not random strangers. I’ve never had that sort of entitlement. But this—this was different.

It wasn’t admiration. It was like… trance.

There was something deeply wrong with how beautiful she was. Not in the way people say it casually. This was horror-movie beautiful. The kind of beauty you see on the face of a woman just after she dies. Like a painting that’s technically perfect but deeply, deeply wrong.

Looking at her face, it didn’t feel like I was seeing a person. It was like staring into a black hole shaped like a woman. The longer I looked, the more I couldn’t think. My brain just shut down.

And I’m ashamed to say it, but even now—after everything she did, after everything she took from my town—thinking about her face still makes my stomach twist. Still makes me lose myself just a little.

I think I was about to cross some mental line when my bus drove into view and stopped in front of me. The doors opened, and I saw Old Man Dave sitting in the driver’s seat. The guy had worked that route since before I was born.

Anyone would’ve looked strange after seeing that woman. But Dave… he looked wrong. Like a 4-year-old’s drawing of a person after staring at the Mona Lisa. Like an imitation of what a person could be.

But to be fair, Dave always looked a little like that.

“You coming or what, kid?” he asked.

I could smell the old rum on his breath.

I turned to look past him through the bus window, desperate to catch one last glimpse of her. That awful, beautiful face. Like rubbernecking a car crash. I knew I shouldn’t want to see her again—but part of me did.

She was gone.

I didn’t know how I felt. Disappointed? Relieved?

Before I could decide, Dave grunted.

“You on something? Because if you are, I’m not letting a crackhead on my bus.”

Had I really been that obsessed with that woman thst I looked like that? I thought it was just Dave being Dave and I stepped on the bus.

 Now Im telling you this so that you know that it wasn’t my fault, what happened. it was none of ours we were just kids.
