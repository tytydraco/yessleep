It was a bright blue sky, tall trees. You will feel the sound of the wind whirling around, the leaves keep on dancing and falling from the rhythm of the wind. The sloshing of water continues to flow as it was like a river. Birds were humming everywhere. It was a very peaceful and relaxing atmosphere.  
  
The tip of the bushes and grasses tingles his skin and made him awake. Slowly, he opened his eyes but the sun’s light hit directly to his face that made him grimace and immediately rolled toward a shed under the tree. Jolted himself and stand up, realizing he was in nowhere. He turned his face around trying to familiarize the place. Mind stuck but continue to think how the hell he got there. He was standing near a ravene. A serene type of view. Confused, but he kept on thinking what really happened.  
  
He was wearing a white shirt and ripped blue jeans. But while examining himself, he noticed some marks of dirt or mud around his clothing. He didn’t even sure if it’s really a mud or dirt. It was like his body was being painted in an abstract manner. This is really something that he can no longer explained.  
  
Trying to find his way out, he decided to roam around. He run and run. Just keep on running and running and running. But he keeps on coming and coming and coming back from the same spot he was on before. Feels like he was being lost at some point. He then shouted, ‘Hellooooo’ ‘Anybody there?’, but it only echoed. He was really helpless at that moment. Exhausted from running and thinking back and forth.  
  
‘I just want to go home, he said.’ Almost starting to give up, but he needs to do something. He searched his pockets, looking for his phone or something that would remind him about what happened. Nothing he found that will help him solved his problem. Sitting down under the tree, restless.  He tried to stay calm, focus and think deep, ‘I need to know what happened’, ‘I need to remember what really happened’. Think Aaron, think! He closed his eyes and deeply breathe.  
  
And when he opened his eyes, he was in his room, lying in bed. 'It was just a dream, a weird dream', those were his words. And he felt relieved.   
  
Then he heard voices, shouting voices like were arguing. Someone was shouting like they’re seemed to be pretty angry. He went out of his room and sneakingly listened to the voices. It was his parents. They were fighting because Aaron was being suspended from his school. There are quite some reasons that triggered the suspension.  
  
He ran and reached the door, opened it and slammed it very hard that his parents were shocked about what he just did. He ran as fast as he could without looking back, heading to his favorite spot.   
It’s an abandoned building just a few blocks away from their house. He sat in a corner of the 2nd floor. He’s angry, mad and sad. Didn’t exactly knew about his feelings that moment, it was an ambivalent emotion circling around him.   
All he wanted was to be alone, just himself. And good thing he was in the perfect place. It was his mini sanctuary. His hang out. He loved being there everytime he wanted to be free and feel alone. He found the place once when he was just strolling around the area. And it's not that far from their place.  
  
Out of nowhere, seems that his past just blurted out through his mind. Feeling sad ang lonely made him remembered about his past. Flashes of memories came back especially when he was in the orphanage.   
He managed to calm and let the pieces became whole.  
  
It was one night, when a staff of the orphanage astounded by a weeping sound. At first, she ignored it and returned to sleep. But the sound continues to alarm that bothers her so much. Instantly, he get up from bed, out from the room and looked for the noise that she kept on hearing out loud. She followed the sound headed to the main door of the orphanage. Hurriedly, she opened the door and saw a baby wrapped around with a black blanket. The little soul was crying. She then carried and stared at it. ‘Oh, what a beautiful angel, it’s a baby boy’, she whispered.  
  
The details were vivid from Aaron's memory. It was the staff, Ms. Pendleton who told him the story about how he got into the orphanage. And that was how it all commenced.  
  
Meanwhile, back at home Mr. and Mrs. Melgrave were still arguing. Mrs. Melgrave cried. She felt pity about her son, Aaron. She loved him so much. The day they brought Aaron home was the happiest day of her life. She continued to sob, trying to contain the pain she felt toward her son.  
  
The couple didn't have the chance to have their own, so they decided to adopt. And that when, Aaron came into the family.   
  
Mrs. Melgrave suddenly remembered the story of Aaron's childhood. It was Ms. Pendleton that told her everything about him.   
  
Year 2016 when Aaron was adopted by Mr. and Mrs. Melgrave. He was 6 years old back then. Now, he's a teenager. He was 15. A grown-up lad. A bit skinny, just like his favorite Ichabod Crane in Sleepy Hollow, light brown complexion and a very tall one at his age.   
The couple lived in a Tomb Subdivision in a small county somewhere in East Texas.  
  
At first, they know that it would be a bit hard for Aaron, because everything is new. Adjustments will have to knock him awhile.  
  
Just months being with his new home and parents, something’s changed. He was very quiet and loner. Maybe he felt weird being in the new surroundings. Everything for him is new.   
  
Mostly, he just spent hours and days in his room. Drawings, readings, computer and watching movies were his routine leisure moment. Adventures, action, horror and crime documentary were the genre that he liked. Notebooks, books, computer and TV were typically his friends.   
In his drawings, usually random subjects whatever it is that may come in his mind or thought about. Different subjects actually, no specifics.   
  
With his computer, he was crazy searching different type of stuff, persons and anything that would make him like a spy or agent. Moreover, hackings was his specialty. He learned it from a book and in some videos he unearthed online. He can indeed trace someone's identity. But that's only a secret. Only himself knew about it.   
  
When he get tired of just staying at home, occasionally he lurked going to the park, sat on the bench, stared and observed on some kids that were playing.  
And his favorite, was to stay in his favorite spot, the abandoned building.  
  
Mingling was not his menu. He developed being an introvert growing up, he was being the opposite compared before when he was in the orphanage. Perhaps, 'it's true that 'Change is inevitable', that was his thought. You cannot avoid it, it will basically knocked you out everytime. Everybody can change everyday.   
  
Being an introvert, observing and examining other people were his natural doing. Analyzing the different types of behavior that a human being has. And he can do that by just watching them from a far.  
  
While staying in his favorite spot and reminiscing his childhood, he then decided to leave his sanctuary and to go back home. And for sure his mother was worried about him.  It was almost night when he got home. It was her mother who opened him the door. She directly hugged him and he wrapped his arms towards her. ‘I’m sorry mom’, Aaron uttered. ‘I’m sorry too son’, replied Mrs. Melgrave while still hugging him. Then, they let go of each other and Aaron went upstairs straight to his room.  
  
It was around 11 in the evening and still awake. Twist and turn in his bed but nothing that made him fall asleep. It was very quiet, all he can listen to was the ticking sound of the clock in his room. The wind breeze swaying the curtain in his open window. It was past midnight when he was about to fall asleep and heard something. It was from outside. He heard a creaking sound from the fence of their neighbor. He was thinking maybe some burglar sneaked in the middle of the night. Right away he closed his windows and go back to bed. He wanted to call 911 but he got scared a little. He didn’t want to get involved even though it would be a big help if ever it's some bad guys. He just wished that it would just some stray cat or dog chasing something to eat.  
  
While still in bed covered with blanket, the thought hit him. He was a wimp. The spirit of being an agent totally faded. What's wrong with me?, he asked himself. He felt embarrassed towards himself.   
  
Then, he slept with shame.  
  
In silence, he woke up and found out that he was in some house, literally not theirs. Shocked at the moment, he stood up from bed and walked slowly around, looking his way out. When suddenly, the next room caught his attention. It was opened. He slowly took steps forward towards the open room. He almost tripped off when he saw a woman lying in bed unconsciously. Immediately, he checked her but only to find out that she’s no longer breathing. ‘She was dead!’ he shouted in his mind. Someone was really out of his mind that he can do such a cruel thing. He didn’t know what to do. Until, he remembered the crime movies he watched, the profiling part.  
  
It's bizarre to think that he feels a slight excitement towards the scene. But this time he’s fearless. The scene was like in some crime movies that he saw. He can now imagine himself as an FBI agent under Behavioral Analysis doing some profiling. He was thrilled a bit.  
  
The woman was in her early 30’s, white, black hair and she was in plaid with jeans. She was positioned in the bed like she was just literally sleeping. There were marks of struggle and a sign of strangulation. Maybe that's the cause of her death. And the weird part is, her nails were freshly polished with magenta.   
  
Aaron think that the killer was organized. It was well-planned. Really took time to do his act. The psychopath maybe acquires pleasure towards his victim. Peeking around, seems that the woman is living alone, no members of the family. That's also a big opportunity for the killer, no intruders that could ruined his plan.   
  
And lot of thoughts drifting in Aaron's mind.  
  
After doing his thing, hurriedly he went out. But he realized he need to go back because he might leave any evidence like prints in the crime scene. He went back upstairs and looked for some cloth to wipe away his prints, but he can’t find any. He can’t use the victim’s things. So, he take off his shirt and hurriedly wipe any traces, prints that will lead back to him. And he left the house.   
  
It was still dark when he got outside, so he thinks it was around 2am in the morning. He ran as fast as he could to avoid someone that might see him. He almost lost his breathing but still continue running until he reached their house. He went to the back, slowly opened the door and head upstairs to his room. Promptly, went to the bathroom, take off his garments and took a bath. After that, he washed his shirt that he used to wipe his prints on the crime scene.  
  
Cradle in his bed, he can’t think of anything else. Only the scene that he saw was printed in his mind. He kept on seeing the woman’s face like it was haunting him. ‘A poor soul’, he sighed with anger. 'Who on earth would do such an evil act?', he questioned. Sleepy and exhausted, he now fall in silence.  
  
The next day, he woke up late. He was wondering if he was just dreaming about the night’s incident that he just witnessed. He went to the toilet and saw nothing. There was no shirt hanged. Worried no more because he’s pretty sure that it's just a dream. He deeply breathe. Possibly, his subconscious was making his profiling FBI agent come true. And his dream did. It's awful to witness a murder by some evil human being, but on the other hand he feel quite happy cause he just experienced some of his favorite. Ever since, he loved doing profiling thing, he was an avid fan of crime, mystery and docu-movies. There comes a time that he wanted to go to Quantico, Virginia just to meet some profiler FBI agents. Because of that dream, everything that happened yesterday was just washed away.   
  
One week after, he turned his TV on, and to his surprise it’s a flash report about a murder. A woman that’s been murdered from her own house. He almost stumbled when the face of the woman flashed to his mind. He then remembered what he just saw that night, in his dream. He can't imagined how. That incident was his dream a week ago. But according to the news report it was happened the day before he was found dead. It was the cleaner who just back from a day off that saw her lying in her bed. To add up, someone that killed her had a motive, because they found out that the woman was a mistress. They’re now trying to contact the man behind the affair.  
  
The next day, it was Monday and it was already summer break, so no need to rush waking up to prepare for school. This time, he can stay in his room as long as he likes. He can do his things all by himself. Well, that’s what his doing ever since he came to Tomb Subdivision. Because his parents were both working, basically he’s alone all day in their house. And since his already grown up, literally he knows how to handle himself alone. He knows how to cook and do some chores while his parents were working.  
  
That day he got bored, so he decided to do something new. He went to their backyard tried to look for some stray cat or dog that would pass by. He waited for like hours. Almost giving up, when a stray kitten passed by. He grabbed it and rushed inside the house. At first, he washed it, then fed it with some pancakes that he didn’t finished eating for breakfast. Then, he brought it to the basement and there he started doing something. He put it first in a cage and start preparing his things.  
  
Out in the cage, the cat were violently shaking to be released. He instantly tied all four legs of the cat to avoid it from moving. Wearing his scrubs, he started the surgery. He sliced open the stomach of the kitten, it cried so loud, yet, he continue what his doing. He then, examined it's organs. Gently, he checked the organs as if he was like a real doctor.   
Done with the surgery, he untied the kittens and sewed it back to its original form. And he looked for a box to put the kitten in it. And he dig in their backyard near to the flowers that his mom planted. He buried the cat inside the box. That's him, expressing his remorse to the kitten.   
  
Ten years later. Time passed by very fast, Aaron was already working as an I.T Consultant in an I.T Company. His fun of keypads and some stuff in the internet. That’s the reason why he chose the I.T course. It didn’t made him bored doing such typings with a bit of hacking. It's also the one that he’s concentrated in doing back then.   
  
He was in the verged of creating a new system for his deadline report when all of a sudden a ring from his phone snatched his attention. Hesitantly, he had no choice but to answer. He grabbed his phone and it was his mother's name appeared in the caller i.d. Apparently, it wasn't his mother's voice speaking in the line, it was someone he didn't know. He listened to the voice, and to his surprised it was a very bad news. He dropped his phone upon hearing the next line's delivered news. Precipitously, he went out badly wanting to see his parents. He can't helped his tears falling from his eyes when he saw them. It was a car accident. He felt being tormented. The pain inside is unbearable. He’s currently shaking. He continues to sob.  
  
It's been weeks since the passing of his parents but he was still in deep pain. However, he was not accustomed of being alone not because he’s a loner. He always feel safe whenever his parents were around. He may be quiet and alone most of the time, but it doesn't mean that his oblivious towards them. He’s not comfortable sharing his emotions to someone and even to his parents. But, he loved them very much and so was his parents to him.  
  
Since he was legally adopted. He acquired all the remaining properties of his parents especially the house.  
  
Locked himself in his room, lying on the nook. Devastated and still in pain, he can't think of anything good rather than picturing his parents face in his mind. The memories kept coming back. It's like being imprinted. His shaking, palms in his face and sob again.  
  
The next day he woke up with a headache. He went downstairs to look for a medicine. Took one and sat on a stool near the kitchen. Dishes were overflowing in the sink, scattered utensils, plates and bowls on the table. It was a hell of a mess. Seems to be, the place was abandoned for months. Grieving stopped him from moving during that time, impaired him from doing the chores. Now that it appears moving a little is a bit fine, he started cleaning the area. He wanted to look it a bit normal and tidy as what it always looked like when his mom was around. She was very organized and orderly. So, he scrubbed the tiles the tables, every edges of the sink to make it clean. Tears and sweats altogether falling. He can't help it. Again, it's tearing his heart. It's like being opened and stitched back. He felt the pain again all over his body, mind and soul. He stopped for awhile trying to contain his emotions. When cleared out, he continues what he’s doing. It's the least that he can do right now. After trying to make the place brighter, he was currently relaxed. As if everything’s glaring.   
  
Appetite was now knocking. He can't barely remember when was the last time he spooned. His stomach was empty for a long period of time. And it feels like ages ago. Only glasses of waters kept him alive.  
  
He looked something in the fridge and found some bacon. Cooked it and had his well breakfast for the past weeks. A bit of satisfaction, because again, he managed to do his meal on his own. 'I think mom would be very proud of me', he uttered sadly.  
  
When finished eating and washing the dishes, he went to the sofa and sat. Few minutes later, unknowingly sleep struck him down.  
  
Calm but very dark, that was in the background when he woke up. But, when a little touch of dawn came out, everything changed. The whole scene was different, totally different.  
  
He was in a barn field, somewhere a bit fuzzy unidentified place. His thinking that his dreaming again. 'What the hell?, he asked confusedly'. Wondering again the idea of being trapped in a dream over and over again.   
  
But, he had no choice but to play in his dream. To find out what will be his part in that specific dream.  
  
Looking around, he saw someone in a Black Hoody running towards in his opposite direction. The Hoody man came out from a small house not far from where he was standing. Slowly, he paced toward the house. And when he’s near enough, it appeared to be not a house because it's a hut. It looked old, like a storage little hut. Storage for barn stuff or probably farmer stuff to be exact. Right in front of the door, he knocked, not once, twice but thrice. But nobody answered. He pushed the door, and it slowly swung open.  
  
And still, no one's inside. No shadow of human being inside. A lot of tools were there. There were rubber gloves, drills, containers in different sizes and many to mention. Others were not really familiar to him, just basically barn stuff.  
  
On the left side of the corner, there's a stair, a cute one. It's a six steps stair. He gently went up and try to peek what's on the top of it.  
  
And when his on the third step, he saw something like a wing or wings. He was not yet on top to finally cleared up what's really he just peeked. He took a pause for awhile. And when his on the fourth step, he was shockingly tripped and fell. 'Ouch!, he shouted discreetly'. His back was aching. Good thing it's not that high and steep, coz surely he'll live.  
  
'It's human, human beings., he uterred distinctively'.  
  
He got up slowly and went upstairs. Now he's focused. And viola!, to his violent surprise, it cleared out. It's a human flesh wings!.  
  
This time, it was two men in their early 30's. They were kneeling like they were praying. Their heads bowed and their hands were tied. Both palm of the hands were positioned closed to the chest and tied just like they were praying. Wearing a thin white cloth covered their hips all the way to the their knees. And the best part, was their back. Their skin flesh were cut, peeled off and hooked it on both sides of the wall. And that made them looked like an angels, the Hooked Angels.   
  
The cuts were perfect and tidy. It was very delicate but seeing the actual picture were totally amazing. The peeling off the skin were smooth without breaking any ribs. It was impeccable.  
  
It was a very morbid and far far different type of motive. It was a complex one. But seeing the actual picture were amazing. He knows it's bad to say amazing for a murder. But he was implying about how it was perfectly done.  
  
It's the second one that he witnessed. The killings were up in a devilish act.   
  
Seems that, Aaron has nothing to react against about it this time. He was immune from the first killing that he dreamt. He can't stopped it, because he had no control over his subconscious. Right now, he was just embracing the moment of being an agent.  
  
He then woke up and surprised to see that he was in the sofa lying. Sweating all over, he’s trying to remember his dream. It seems like real. 'Why am I keep on dreaming a murder scene?' he asked himself puzzled. He looked for a towel and wiped his face from the sweat all over through his neck. It's really a bad dream. My dream seems to be high this time. It's pretty bad and messed up. 'I hope that this was only just a dream', he wished. I'm not gonna let this dream ruined my day.  
  
A bit moved on, he need to continue his life. He should go outside sometime. He need to go back to work. He knows that his parents will not be happy if he’s going to lock himself forever. He need to move forward and make them proud.  
  
Work mode on, he had a lot of reports to catch up. It's been 2 weeks. Sitting on his chair, he opened his email and a news update popped up in yahoo.  
  
He was extremely startled to see and read the headline that recently posted about another murder. He tried to close his eyes then open just to clarify what he saw in his monitor. But, it's crystal clear. It was the two men that he saw in his dream five days ago. His jaw dropped in shock.  
  
'It's happening again. For real, again. What is wrong with me?', his murmuring to himself. This is not healthy anymore. I feel like I'm going crazy. And this is crazy!  
  
Is this really possible? How?  
What If I'm just being paranoid? Or just some coincidence because of how much I'm addicted to crime or any criminal series? Thoughts and questions were rumbling around his mind over and over again. Thinking of what's going on to him. Is this some kind of clairvoyant thing? How?  
  
Right now, he can't keep up with his thoughts about the news. He has a lot, I mean huge of piles of things to do and submission of reports. His hands are full, literally. He needs to focus. Clearly focus on something more important. And that's probably, his job.  
  
And who would believe him anyway? Just a question, you know?. Words were wrestling up in his head. Like it's going to burst with some punches.   
  
But he decided on focusing his workloads. It's better to have some food put on the table than being a wasted hero thing that's not really sure if it's happening or even true.  
  
The next two days, he got home late, very late. But at least, he’s not jobless. I mean, not yet.   
Slouched on the couch trying to feel comfortable with the smooth fabric of the sofa. He just wanted to rest, peacefully and quietly. It feels like he was never rested for a long period of time due to work.   
  
And now, it's sleeping time. It's his moment of silence. His eyelids seems to have a life on their own that just closes by itself. And he can't stop it from falling and closing down.  
  
Finally, with a single snap he was knocked out. He just received his sleep benefits from too much work.  
  
While sleeping, he was scooting on the sofa that made him fell. 'Ouch, he shouted. Only to find out that he was not home. He was somewhere near a cliff. He can hear the stroking of the waves.  
  
Checking his watch, it's around 4am in the morning. There was a tree not far away from where he was standing. It appeared to be, there was something weird in that tree. So, he went closer towards it. Steps continued. The closer he came the clearer the view appeared. He stopped at the moment. 'This is so wrong, he whispered.' Everytime he got into that kind of situation, something's went wrong. 'This is not happening again, he continued to utter. Wrapping his both hands in his head, he felt weak as if he can't continue to move.  
  
But his minds were arguing some thoughts. He needs to know what happened. He had no choice, he was already there. So, he continues pacing to the tree.  
  
It was a big strong tree, literally like a bold muscle from too much workout. Branches, roots and stem were pumped out just like packs of abs.   
  
Don't know what type of tree. But it seems old and still it's alive. There were few leaves on it. But, what's most fascinating but atrociously that caught his attention was a man that was attached to the stem of the tree.  
  
The man was in his late 30's. He was placed like a tree on the tree itself. Both hands were tied on the branches. Both legs were tied intertwined near the roots. But the beautiful part was that, his stomach was open and it was filled with flowers. Everything was explicit. 'Twas like his internal organs was being replaced by a bouquet of different kinds of colorful flowers. It was very aesthetic and exceptional to look at. The killer handled everything with finesse. No matter how satanism his act was, still he can't control his adoration towards the killings. It was like an art in a museum. Aaron, called it 'The Vase Man'  
  
The killer may seemed to be a psycho but on the other hand, Aaron feels like the killer was an artist. A control freak artist.  
  
Days passed by, Aaron was exhausted. He tried to make himself busy. He don't want to close his eyes.  
  
This time, he was very frightened. The face of 'The Vase Man' was still in his mind. He didn't know literally what he feels. He was amazed by the killings but at the same time it was too much. Only the demons can do such a ruthless and barbaric doings. He was too terrified to experience another vicious act, another murder. But still, he has no control over it.  
  
It was Sunday. He tried to make himself busy. He looked for something to do, to keep him up from thinking. He decided to clean his room, vacuumed the carpet, throwing obsolete things, decluttering. He cleaned everything, the whole house, just to keep him awake. He also did some laundry, all the bedsheets, pillows, curtains and covers.  
  
After making the whole house looked tidy, he prepared his meal. He cooked a steak that he’s been craving the entire day. When his meal was done, he washed the dishes. Then, he decided to watch a movie in netflix. While sitting on the couch he spend his time watching random movies.  
  
It was around 9 in the evening, he continued to watch until his eyes were no longer open. He can't stop his eyelids from falling down.  
  
And again, he knew, he was dreaming once more.  
  
That time, there was a Black Hoody Man. He then remembered the killer, it was just like him.  
So, he secretly followed. The Hoody Man was headed to a house. Seems that the place looked familiar. And there, he saw the Hoody Man killed the 'Lady in Magenta Polish'. He strangled it while drowning in the tub. When the lady was dead, he positioned it to the bed and paint her nails in magenta.  
Everything was vivid. He was shocked. He didn't imagined that he was facing the real killer, the real murderer, the psychopath. It was shown to him every details of his act. He felt goosebumps just witnessing face to face.  
  
When he’s done killing the lady, the Hoody Man ran fast.   
  
Scared, but he also continues running. Minute of running, he noticed that the scene slowly changes. Then, they were in a barn. The Hoody Man enters the hut. The thought of the 'Hooked Angels' flashed in Aaron's mind. Slowly he followed the Hoody Man. Up in the second floor, he saw how the Hoody Man perfectly sliced the back of the skin. His hands were born for surgeries. It was flawless. The skin was like fillet, sliced open without breaking or tearing the bones, ribs and other flesh. The cut was amazing. And those little hooks used for fishing were smoothly attached to the edge of the skin with a string, slowly flipped out and tied the end of the string to the wall. And that made them the 'Hooked Angels'. Aaron was in awe just watching an amazing act that the Hoody Man did.  
  
This was his second, a bit away different from his first. Evil but it was like a nice execution.  
  
Then, the location changes again, it was like a time travel adventure. But this part, together with a demonic character.  
  
They were in a cliff, the Hoody Man walked towards a big tree near a cliff. And the act continued, it was his third. This one, he saw how he opened the stomach of a man and take away all the organs inside it. The liver, kidneys, intestines, spleen, pancreas and other organs around the abdomen. As what Aaron said before, his hands were perfect for a surgeon. He one by one pulled out the organs. It was impeccable. The organs were still intact, he ever managed not to destroy them, as if he can still use them for transplants. The way he pulls out the organs were very smooth, gentle but precise.   
  
After pulling out the organs, he positioned the body to the tree just like being crucified. But his ways were a bit different. Victim's hands were tied on each left and right branch of a tree. Then the feet were tied together down below the roots. He was like a vine that cuddled into the tree. And his stomach were open, he gathered all the different kinds of flowers and put it inside his abdomen. He decorated the stomach with bouquet of flowers. It looked like a 'A Vase Man'.  
  
All his three killings were different but still it was awful, morbid and very satanic.   
He closes his eyes for a moment trying to contain everything that he saw.  
  
But when he opened his eyes, they were in a big kitchen. He was confused.  
  
He saw the Hoody Man not far from where he was hiding, chopping some meat. He was looking in the menus in front of him. He was cutting meats in different types of cut to serve.   
  
Then, the Hoody Man went to a room. It's like a secret room. He then followed him. And when he peeked on the door, he was almost vomit but he tried not to. He saw the different parts of human flesh hanged in that room. Legs, arms, torso, feet and other human parts and flesh. He slowly but rushly run to the door at the back. And there, he puke. He throw up. All that his stomach contains were flashed out through his mouth. He feels like he was going to be sick. He kept on vomiting over and over again until there is nothing left to spit out.   
He was catching his breath, his hands on his knees trying to hold because he feels like collapsing that moment. He stopped for a while. And when he regain his strength a bit, he moved around the place.   
  
'It looked familiar, he said. And when he faced up, he saw and read the sign/name of the place. It's a restaurant, that he, many times went to because he loved all the menu/food that they served.  
  
He throw up again. His stomach was aching from too much spitting.  
  
He felt disgusted. He can even sensed himself being filthy, all over his body.  
  
But that particular moment, he can no longer stop himself. He shouted, very loud. As loud that everybody who dine inside the restaurant heard him, looked and stared at him. He run very fast, he didn't bother the direction he was running to, he just wanted to be far away from that place.   
  
He continue running that he ignored a hump blocking on the way. He tripped and when he stand up, he was in his bedroom. The pillow was wet from too much sweat. He was sweating all over. He sighed very deep. Atlast, he felt solace knowing that he was no longer in an abysmal nightmare. It was very dreadful. He stopped thinking for a moment. All he wanted was to feel the comfort from his bed that he was finally home. He stood up and started jumping in his bed like in a trampaulin. Happiness was not the best word to describe what he was actually feeling that morning. Didn't bother wiping his sweats, because he knew it was the proof that his wide-awake. It was the best feeling of his life.  
  
When everything was already fine, he decided to take a bath. He took steps going through the bathroom, but before getting there, he noticed something in the mirror when he passed by. Something familiar caught his peripheral view. He went back, stand and stare in front of the mirror. He looked at himself and pulled out his Black Hood that he was wearing. And then, he laughed hellishly.
