Okay, so I’m kind of on edge right now because I just read [this story](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10vcx5u/i_saw_him_counting_backward_i_had_to_try_to_stop/) and now I’m wondering if I met the same dude but virtually.

This was back in the days when AOL would send you a CD like once a week in the mail begging you to install it and get 500 free hours of internet.

I was 15, and my friends and I would stay up all night drinking my mom’s wine and jumping into whatever random chatroom we could find just to mess with people. Like, we’d pretend to be a 90 year old woman with a dog who had diarrhea and beg people for help. Sophisticated stuff, I know.

But then one day we’re in the middle of this big chatroom with a ton of people joining and leaving all the time. And we notice this user whose name is just a random bunch of letters and numbers, and every time someone joins the chat, he just posts descending numbers. 10. 9. 8. And finally he gets to zero and leaves.

As for that last account that entered just before the weird guy typed zero? Yeah, it went idle right away and eventually disconnected without typing a word.

Weird, but nothing too crazy.

Except that a few days later, we hosted this LAN party in my basement with like 15 dudes to play Starcraft. And when we logged into the Battle.net room we noticed the same guy was already there. Now, this was supposed to be a private room, and we had no idea who the fuck this was. We tried asking, but he didn’t type a word.

Then, as people finished setting up their computers and logging in, he started counting down from 10. Finally, when he got to one, I kind of held up my hand and asked the room if maybe we should stop, or find a new room or something. But everyone else told me to go fuck myself, and then Brian Lee logged into the room.

And then he fell over, blood pouring from his nostrils.

Could it have been a coincidence? Yeah, maybe. I guess I always wanted to think so.

But then when I saw that post a couple of days ago, it kind of freaked me out. Like maybe the Counting Man is real?

Because when that other poster described the man in the black suit, it kind of gave me to this flashback to Brian’s funeral. There was this super well dressed guy there, who looked vaguely sad. No one seemed to know who he was. And as the mourners walked into the church, I heard him counting down from 10. And when he got to zero, Brian’s uncle dropped dead, right on the threshold to the church.

After that, I hadn’t had any encounters for years until I read that story.

And then, a few hours later I’m in the comments something of some random thread on some memes forum, and I see him there, user 222cc34 or something like that. Counting down and people made their comments. And I just noped out of there without a word. To be honest, I’m pretty much ready to delete my account altogether and just go live in the woods where ten people never get together at once.

But… since that’s never gonna actually happen, I just kind of wanted to post here and see if anyone else has experienced anything like this or seen this guy around? [Thanks in advance!](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/)
