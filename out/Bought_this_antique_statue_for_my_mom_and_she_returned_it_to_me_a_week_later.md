My mom is a Catholic and I know some could relate to this but she is a heavy collector of statues of saints and other religious items. She even has a small room dedicated for these statues, all huddled together like they’re having some sort of meeting. She might be considered a hoarder but sometimes she gives these statues to her friends or neighbors. It’s not something I consider unhealthy so I didn’t pay any mind to it. I even gave her [this antique statue of Jesus](https://www.toodat.com/community/Boughtthis/ISawaGhost/qmQO5xe7EOb7rJX0) that I bought online. I really thought it was the kind of stuff that she would like. And I was right. When I gave it to her, she loved it instantly. She even smelled it and liked its old wood scent. But after a week, she returned it to me and I can’t believe her reason.   


She said it started inconspicuously. She placed it on a table and leaned it on the wall since she doesn’t have a place yet where she could hang it. From time to time, she would notice that it would fall on the table or even at the ground. She figured that since it doesn’t have a solid base, then it’s natural. But at one point, she saw it overturned. Like Jesus is facing the wall. She thought it was weird because there should be an external force to do that and she lives alone. But she brushed it off by thinking that she might have done it while cleaning and had forgotten to fix its position back to normal.  
  
But then, one night, she heard light footsteps around her home. She hears her wooden floor creak as if someone was creeping inside. She tried to ignore it but really she was already alert for an intruder. She waited in silence for more footsteps but the next thing she heard wasn’t one. It was whispers. Coming from the room next door. The room where she keeps her statues. She said it was audibly a hushed conversation but she couldn’t make out the words.   
  
She thought someone must have come to steal her collection so she grabbed a broom and headed to the statues room. Even as she neared the door of that room, she could still hear the whispering between the intruders. My dear mother, I don’t know if she’s brave or just not thinking right because her collection is at stake but she flung open the door and prepared to crack the skull of anyone she sees in the room but there was no one. It was only her statues. She opened the light and inspected everything. And in the corner of her eyes she saw the statue that I gave wobbling on its place as if someone hurriedly returned it to its place and ran away. She said she covered the statue with a white cloth and wrapped a rosary around it and she prayed all night after. She then returned it to me and asked me to resell it to someone else.   
  
Now I wonder about the origin of this statue. Did the one who sold it to me knew something about it? I’m trying to contact them again but so far no luck.
