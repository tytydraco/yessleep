Ever since I moved into my current home with my family, I’ve been walking a lot. My previous home wasn’t in a really good neighbourhood, and it wasn’t the safest place to walk around. So, it’s been really nice to be able to walk around and explore a new and safe neighbourhood.  
  
Well…  
  
It *was*, until today…  
  
Today I decided to go on a longish walk, a decision that I *deeply* regret now.  
  
The route I decided to go on today passed through a park. Now, I’ve been to this park plenty of times before, and it’s a pretty nice place. There’s a playground, and some exercising equipment. There’s also a large open area up ahead with a basketball and tennis court alongside a bike course.  
  
I was approaching the park, and up ahead I saw that the park was quieter than usual, apart  
from a group of guys on the exercising equipment. They looked to be in their late teens and one of them was blond and had on a white hoodie, but I didn't see much more than that. (I tend to observe people I pass on my walks).  
  
As I was passing them, one of the boys called out to me.  
  
“Hey!” One of the boys said.

That put me on edge, so I didn’t turn around and I started speedwalking to the open area up ahead.  
  
“HEY!” the same boy said again, only this time, he sounded *angrier.*  
  
I ran as fast as I could and I didn't look back.

I don’t think I ever ran that fast in my life like I did at that moment.  
  
I stopped running once I reached the bike course. It was far away from the park, and it was in a safe spot where some people were nearby.  
  
I sat down to catch my breath.  
  
My heart was pounding and my mind was completely blank.  
  
I sat there for a couple minutes, trying to comprehend what the hell just happened.

I looked back towards the park and to the exercising equipment, but the group of boys weren’t there anymore.

I eventually concluded that they were probably bored and trying to get my attention, and I decided to continue my walking route. But, even so, I still felt very paranoid.  
  
I continued my walk, and I kept looking back to see if those boys were following me. But they weren’t, and I had the feeling I would’ve noticed if they did.

I eventually came to a tunnel that was under the road, and on the other side it led to another park. Only, this park was way more forested than the previous one and I enjoy walking through it because it’s so quiet and I can listen to the soft rustling of the leaves.  
  
When I was half-way through the tunnel, I heard someone *running* towards me.  
  
I immediately turned around, but there was no one there.

A pit formed in my stomach.

The paranoia was really starting to get me, but I just told myself that it was probably some kind of animal.

Still, I felt more uneasy than ever, but I wanted to continue my walk and maybe try to take my mind off of the whole thing.

Once I entered the forest, I finally started to calm down. I closed my eyes, the only sounds in the forest were the soft rustling of the trees, the birds, and the sounds of my shoes against the dirt path.

I opened my eyes, observing the late-afternoon sunlight filtering through the leaves. I inhaled the smell of the forest. It was nice.

Suddenly.

There was a *loud* rustling behind me.

I quickly turned around.

My blood ran cold.

The blond boy from earlier emerged from the bushes. 

*He was holding a knife.*

‘Hey, cutie. Why did you run away from us earlier?” He wore a perverted simile as he said that.

I felt like I was going to be sick

Two more boys emerged from the bushes, and they were also holding *knives.*

I bolted as fast as I could.

Behind me I heard the blonde boy say, "GET HER!”  
  
I ran further into the forest in an attempt to lose them.

I had to get back home. *Now.*

I ran and ran, trying to dodge the various branches and tree trunks. It was a lot darker now, and it was getting harder and harder to see what was ahead of me.

I made it back to the tunnel. 

I looked back, but I couldn’t see or hear them anymore.

My legs were so tired that I could barely even walk, but I had to keep going.

The tunnel was pitch black.

I slowly stumbled through the tunnel. It was quiet. The only sounds were my ragged breath echoing off of the tunnel and my uneasy steps.

When I finally got to the other side, *I froze*.

There was a sharp scraping sound in the tunnel. Like nails against a chalkboard.

*Like a knife being dragged slowly against a concrete wall.*  
  
*“I know you’re there, cutie. You can’t keep running.”*  
  
The bile rose in my throat as I stood there, completely frozen in terror.

He was going to take his *sweet* time with this.

But, by some miracle. I found the strength to start running again*.*

I made it to the park, my legs felt like they were on fire.

I was so close to home. I was so, so close.  
  
When I finally made it back home, I turned off all the house lights, and I immediately hid in my room. 

It's been over an hour now and I'm still hiding.

I have no idea if they're still after me, or if they just gave up.

I don't know if I'm just being paranoid, but I just heard something ***sharp*** being scraped against my window.
