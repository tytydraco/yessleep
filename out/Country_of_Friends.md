"Can I have some more jam?"

"Careful, you don't want to get sticky now! Just kidding, of course you can, ha-ha-ha-ha!" Chuckler laughed so hard he almost dropped his hat right into the pie. His huge, horse-like teeth used to scare me, but over time, I got used to my friend's unusual appearance.

"Of course, of course!" His long-fingered hand grabbed a spoon, scooped some jam right out of the jar, and started stuffing the red, sugary goo into my mouth.

"Is it tasty? Tasty?" Chuckler was clearly joking around, smearing jam on my face and banging the spoon against my teeth. I tried to stop him, but he was too engrossed in his joke, drowning out my protests with his laughter.

"Enough, you rascal, stop it." Murka gently but deftly took the spoon away. Her fluffy red tail flickered as she took her place at the table. I felt a bit embarrassed in her presence — unlike my other friends, Murka stirred new feelings and emotions inside me. I liked her, but differently than I did my mom. I constantly tried to impress or surprise her, and once even gave her flowers I picked in Candy Meadow.

"So, what are we going to play today?" Murka asked, and I swallowed hard, words stuck in my throat.

"If everyone's done eating, we can probably start!" Chuckler jumped onto the table and did a cartwheel, scattering dishes, candies, and pastries. His head remained upright while his eyes kept rolling around in their sockets like a toy.

"How about hide-and-seek?" I suggested. I had already picked a spot where no one could find me.

"Not hide-and-seek! Not hide-and-seek! If this little brat is the seeker, he'll find me right away! Freak!" Grumper roared, pounding his massive fists on the table so hard that dishes bounced and raisins flew everywhere.

"Oh dear, you can't do that." Chuckler wagged his long, thin finger. His expression didn't change a bit, still radiating inexplicable joy, like it was made of plastic. "If you keep acting like this, we'll punish you like we did Dummy — you'll be quiet and clean up the table while the others play."

"Hide-and-seek then," the big guy rumbled in agreement.

"And apologize to Lenya," insisted Chuckler with a laugh, his long, club-like nose shaking with his words.

"Sorry, Lenya. I won't do it again," Grumper said, like he did every time, but nothing ever changed. "Peace?"

I had to grab his pinky, as big as a sausage, with my whole hand. Everyone shouted in unison:

"Peace, peace, peace, no swearing! And if you swear…"

"I will bite," Chuckler finished alone, snapping his teeth menacingly above Grumper's head.

"Who's going to be the seeker? Not me!" I hurried to add. I really wanted to try a new hiding place.

"Not me! Not me!" Murka and Chuckler quickly chimed in.

"Well, darn it!" exclaimed the big guy, and Murka immediately gave him a stern look with her black, olive-like eyes.

"Alright, alright, go hide already!" Grumper laid his head on the table and covered it with his hands. "One, crocodiles-hippos! Two, crocodiles-hippos! Three..."

We all scattered in different directions. I immediately dashed to the basement stairs, leading down right in the middle of the clearing. I had noticed it during my previous visit to Chuckler, while searching for a lost badminton shuttlecock. I involuntarily glanced back. The enormous Grumper was still counting, hunched over the table, while Dummy was already bustling around, clearing the dirty dishes. Dummy couldn't play hide-and-seek — she had trouble seeing through the cage on her head.

I quickly descended the stairs and found myself on a dirty concrete floor littered with broken bottles, cigarette butts, and some dead jellyfish. I tugged at the door, but it wouldn't budge, and I felt a chill inside. I hadn't considered that the battered metal door would be locked. A roar echoed above the clearing:

"...Ten, crocodiles-hippos and a green parrot! If you're not hidden, it ain't my fault!"

There was no time to re-hide — Grumper was already "on the hunt." However, he was usually not very attentive. If I pressed against the door, I wouldn't be visible until someone peeked into the pit. Besides, my friends never gathered here — maybe I'd get lucky.

"What are you doing here?" a gentle murmur came from above. I looked up — Murka was sitting at the edge of the pit, flicking her tail from side to side. Her red ears, adorned with tufts, bristled angrily.

"Shh! I'm hiding!" I whispered, hoping Grumper wouldn't hear us.

With a light motion, Murka leaped down, clicking her hooves, and landed on the only clean patch of concrete. I had never been so close to her before, and now I keenly felt the warmth emanating from her body. Her silky fur-covered chest barely touched my shoulder. I felt my cheeks turn crimson, and my breathing quickened. Murka was covered in fur, so she didn't wear clothes, just like an animal, but she spoke like a human. Did that mean she was naked?

"Let's get out of here before he wakes up!" she grabbed my hand and pulled me up the stairs.

"But why?"

"Solitaire lives here. No one is allowed here…"

We were almost up the stairs when a rusty creak sounded behind us…

I woke up from a rough nudge to my side. I had already opened my eyes when a hairy leg with unkempt nails, clad in a rubber slipper, kicked me in the ribs again.

"Maria, get up, put your idiot to bed, he's sleepwalking again!"

Sleepily, I got up from the floor, dodging my stepfather's third kick. I didn’t want to call him dad, so I called him "Uncle Teresha."

My mom soon came out of the bedroom, tying her robe as she walked.

"Come here, little one. Let's go to bed. Go to sleep, Tesha, I'll be right there."

"Damn brat!" my stepfather cursed and went to the kitchen. A lighter flicked, and the smell of cigarettes spread through the apartment.

"Why can't you sleep, bunny?" my mom asked.

I dreamed I was playing hide-and-seek with Chuckler and Murka, Grumper was seeking, and I...

"Oh, that 'Country of Friends' of yours again!" my mother sighed wearily and began tucking the blanket on my bed. "Come on, baby, go to sleep, I have to get up early for work tomorrow. You'll stay with Tesha."

"Mom, can I go to work with you? Please!" I pleaded. I didn’t want to stay with my stepfather.

"Little one, you know I work in a hospital, it has to be sterile, they won't let you in. Behave well, and I'll buy you a Kinder tomorrow, agreed?"

"Not a 'Kinder' for him!" my stepfather appeared in the doorway, "Look what this brat has done!"

The dusty chandelier dimly lit the tiny nursery — a crib, a small toy box, darkened icons on the walls, and an old shelf with boring, adult books. My stepfather sat in his wheelchair, completely naked, pot-bellied, covered in curly hair, with an ugly stump instead of one leg. A blurry tattoo of a crucifix was blue on his chest, with a small cross dangling above it on a thin string.

"Look! In my own house, this brat dares to steal from me!"

A jar with the last of the jam shattered on the floor, shards scattering across the blanket.

"And he doesn't repent one bit, huh? Look at his wicked face!"

I wiped my hand across my lips — there really was something red and sticky on my fingers.

"You live in my house, you little freak, in mine! And God sees, everything in this house is also mine! You little bastard! For it is written in the Scriptures — neither thieves nor swindlers will inherit the Kingdom of God."

Uncle Teresha forcefully spun the wheels, steering the wheelchair toward my bed. I hid under the blanket, hoping to escape this monster, covering myself completely and only able to hear what was happening.

"Tesha, don't, he didn't mean to... Let's go to the bedroom, I'll do what you like…"

A loud slap echoed, followed by a dull thud, as if something had fallen.

"You'll do everything I say! This is my house! And you are nobody here, you are nameless! The Lord commanded us to raise our sons without regard for their cries, and I will, damn it, don't doubt it!"

"Ah, Tesha, stop, please, don't!"

"You should be crawling on your knees, you scum!"

"Tesha, don't, you'll leave me without fingers!"

"Alright, enough!" I heard the wheelchair clatter on the linoleum — as if rolling off a curb. "By the sweat of your brow, you will eat your food... And who will need you fingerless at work?"

With a creak, the wheelchair left the nursery, and mother remained huddled on the floor, sobbing softly.

Upon waking, I prayed first, kneeling before the icons under the watchful eye of my stepfather. My mother had left for work early in the morning and wouldn’t be back until late at night. I didn’t like staying with Uncle Teresha, but fortunately, he had secluded himself with a bottle since morning. That meant he would sit in the kitchen all day, puffing cigarettes and clinking glasses now and then with a large framed photograph. I had managed to get a glimpse of it once. There was nothing interesting in it—just some people in military uniforms grinning at the camera. Maybe my stepfather was among them, but I didn’t dare ask.

I tried to occupy my day with something, waiting for the evening. The only television set was in the kitchen, and I didn’t want to go there without urgent need. Moreover, my stepfather called the TV a "box of demons" and only allowed me to watch the news, with rare exceptions.

My mother had unwisely left food on the stove, and now my stomach was rumbling fiercely. From the icons on the walls, stern old men with their identical frowning faces gazed down. Sitting in the room, I drearily leafed through books without pictures. At my stepfather's insistence, I had read almost all of them several times—they were strange, full of some kind of admonitions, rules, incomprehensible stories, and nearly all were about either God or His son. Trying to entertain myself, I read prayers from the books backward, but soon that bored me too. Occasionally, I would flinch when the man in the kitchen started lamenting and swearing:

"Lord, why have you forsaken me? A worm at your feet, your servant, I don't understand your ways! Why didn't I die then, in battle, under Kandahar? Why did you save me? What purpose have you devised for me? Where were they, all your angels, your winged seraphim, while Vovka was burning alive, while Armen was gathering his guts together? Where..."

Listening to my stepfather in the hope that he wouldn’t remember about me in the next room, I didn’t immediately notice the hand of a withered gum color with thin fingers appearing from under the bed. Following it was a long, large nose and then a gray mask with wildly spinning eyes and a mad smile.

"Chuckler!" I whispered joyfully.

He nodded, and his top hat slid down to his forehead. Chuckler put a finger to his lips, signaling for silence, and extended a hand to me. I shook his hand, and my friend pulled me under the bed.

"Take a seat, we’re just having lunch! Hu-hu-hu-hoo!"

My stomach twisted at the sight of the treats spread out on the table for tea parties. Cakes, pastries, and a whole mound of marshmallows in the middle. Grumper nodded indifferently upon my arrival, Dummy seemed not to notice anything with her small-mesh cage on her head, and Murka playfully waved at me with her clawed paw.

"Enjoy your meal, little one!"

I greedily attacked the treats, trying not to get too messy—after all, Murka was watching. Having slightly satisfied my hunger, I asked the question that had been bothering me since last night.

"Who is Solitaire?"

Grumper choked, Murka's fur stood on end, Chuckler's eyes stopped spinning, and even Dummy, usually indifferent to everything, trembled slightly as if laughing.

"Don't say his name!" Chuckler warned, not making a single laugh, contrary to habit, "Otherwise, he will hear you and crawl over here!"

"You don’t want to know what he is. He is the scariest nightmare of all," added Murka, "even Grumper is afraid of him."

The faceless fat man nodded nervously, and a few raisins fell from his head.

"Because of him, we are locked in here," he rumbled sadly, and from the indentations where his eyes should have been, two streams of creamy fudge appeared.

"He won’t let us out!" Chuckler wiped away an invisible tear.

"Where would you go? We’re fine here, aren’t we?" I asked.

"True joy, true pleasures—are there, in your world," Chuckler explained enviously.

"I wouldn't say that," I replied, "Here you have sweets, games, fun. In that world, I have only a stepfather, books, and his God."

"That’s because we’re not there yet," Grumper corrected, "If we got out of here, you would see what real fun is like!"

"If someone could deal with him, defeat him," Murka stretched, "I might even kiss that hero."

My ears blazed again, and I immersed myself in fantasies about what such a kiss would be like—surely pleasant and moist, unlike my mother’s. I was distracted from sinful thoughts by Grumper—he bit into a pastry, and the custard squirted onto Murka's shiny smooth fur. She hissed angrily at the spongy fat man covered in confectionery sprinkles.

"Ee-hee-hee-hee! Food fight! Let the seventh angel sound!" Chuckler announced solemnly like a master of ceremonies and immediately launched a potato right at Grumper’s head. The tuber stuck into the soft cake of his face and now protruded like a nose. I snorted, grabbed a small piece of Charlotte cake, and threw it at Dummy. She didn’t react, the cake stuck to the grate through which I could never see her face.

"Hey, catch, little one!" I turned just in time to see a huge piece of cream cake flying at my face. The treat smashed against my face, clogging my eyelids, stuffing my mouth and nose. I began to spit, shook my head, and when I finally managed to open my eyes, my stepfather's sweaty and frightening face, scarred by an undulate long-healed burn, was hanging before me. My pants were warm and wet, and a kitchen towel twisted into a bundle stuck in my teeth. Uncle Teresha pressed my body painfully to the floor, with the wheelchair thrown behind him.

"Damn, you scared me, bastard! You forgot to take your meds again, huh? Answer me, you little scumbag, well?"

Uncle Teresha propped himself up on his arms, dragged his one remaining leg to the wheelchair, and climbed into it.

"Come to the kitchen, your mother left you something to eat."

I wanted to say that I had already eaten—but it was best not to argue with my stepfather.

"And go wash up, your face is all foamy. Damn, you even pissed yourself! Run to the bathroom, degenerate!"

I washed up, changed into clean clothes, and went to the kitchen. Uncle Teresha had already heated the buckwheat with cutlets that had been on the stove and divided the food onto plates.

"Where are you reaching your hands? Pray first, you heathen."

I mumbled something about “Give us today our daily bread...” as I quickly launched into my meal.

I was full—having indulged in marshmallows, pastries, and candies, I had no desire to eat the dry cutlet with buckwheat. But leaving the table with anything on the plate meant incurring my stepfather's wrath. He had already, agitated after drinking, begun his moral lessons.

"Look, you devil's seed, see what this is?" the man, already quite drunk, poked his bare chest, right where the face of Christ was on the image, "Our Lord is merciful and just. And his justice—true, impartial, for his love is so strong that he punishes his children as a lesson. And your mother was punished with you, for her sins, for her boundless whoring. And I was punished, for that damned village, for every dead soul... We all paid, Vovka, Armen, Goshan, and I more than anyone. And you need to pray day and night so that the Lord finally forgives you, or maybe even takes you to him, blessed one. Well, what are you staring at? Don’t look at me, you disgust me... Get lost!"

My stepfather pushed my plate onto the floor, and the remaining buckwheat scattered in all directions. Alcohol and rage swirled in Uncle Teresha's pupils. I hurried to leave the kitchen, and a glass flew after me—it hit the wall and shattered, showering me with a rain of fragments.

"Go and pray, you scum, get on your knees and pray before I crush you, you filthy creature!"

My mother came home long after midnight; I was already asleep. She gently woke me, trying not to wake Uncle Teresha.

"How are you, little one? Here, as I promised," she handed me a chocolate egg, "But first, the medicine. Come on..."

I found myself holding a glass of water and several tablets of different colors and shapes. Once assured I had taken my medicine, she went to the bedroom. After waiting a bit, I spat the wet handful into my palm and threw it into the gap between the wall and the bed, where a whole pile had already accumulated. Chuckler said that if I took the pills, it would be difficult to reach the Country of Friends again.

I fell asleep.
