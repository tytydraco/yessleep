Proof of concept: here I am, using it to post on Reddit! As in the forum place Reddit, 2005 – 2027, gone for good but forever in our hearts.

If you can read this, hello from my time-traveling TargetTab! What was California like? And Indonesia? And Panama? You all had so much land back then! And did you seriously have little ice crystals that fell from the sky and made white piles on the ground? I mean obviously I've seen pictures of snow, but you can make a picture of anything.

It'd be ulkasnot if I really did manage to make a new Reddit post, *and* it somehow popped up in 2025 Reddit.

Update:

Holy Musk, it worked!!! I laughed so hard when I saw it appear that I clogged my oxygen filter and had to go up a level in my AmazonAir subscription to the $5000/month tier to start breathing again.  2025 websites load so fast, and for free, and they’re full of humans.

I'm back from some bjanxed surf searching, and hwow. Some of these photos are gnorked — it’s not everyone, but a lot of the people’s faces are all weird-looking, kinda scrunched-up and loose skinned all at once? The GoogolPlex says that people thought happened when you got as old as 40 or 50 years old (as in five-oh! Guh-norked!) because back then some people used to think it was possible for humans to live that long.  Probably because they were so ignorant they didn't realize your cancer risk gets to 100% by age 20 and humans naturally die in their 20s or 30s. Obviously the images of people with the gray hair and all those face lines are generated rather than actual photos of real events, but why bother? Some religious thing?

Old-timey people were *adorable*, though. They talk about trying to visit Mars someday, and technology getting better over time, and trying to end wars, and they're all obsessed with what foods to eat. No wonder! I think I counted sixteen or maybe even seventeen different types of food in an hour of searching, and NONE of them were SoylentHomogenized. And the geese! They're so pretty, I

sorry gotta throw off the filters sometimes, I canNOT get arrested for thoughtcrime again or else my MetaDebt labor sentence will take up the rest of my life. But geese! Geese are so cool! People were complaining about geese p\_\_\_\_ping on their lawn! Way to take the existence of birds for granted. I also saw someone joking (not a funny joke) about k\_\_\_ing a spider, as in stepping on it to make it d\_\_d. Oh buddy, you're going to miss *those* when they're gone.

Since it seems like I really did somehow post this to 2025: if you can read this, go eat a banana or a tomato. Pet a cat. And when you're done, look up at a blue sky. Or even maybe even breathe some unfiltered air. Zuck knows we didn't appreciate those enough back then.
