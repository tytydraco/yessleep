I’m writing this now as I can’t take the pain. I need something to distract me. I’m in the bathroom right now for the fifth time this hour—I’ll spare you the details… I am getting lightheaded from the pain and need to keep myself occupied.

It’s my stomach.

It hit me on my train ride home from work—well—it really began at the office. subtly at first, like water starting to boil; it felt like those tiny bubbles that sprinkle the walls of the pot at the water heats up. Though as I was sitting on the train—the real bubbles began to surface.

Short stretches of pain—it would hit me in intensifying waves. Every time the train lurched or swayed, it’d shake loose a bubble of pain and I’d feel it move up my chest and hit right at the precipice of my throat, though it never went beyond that. I didn’t let it. I’d swallow it down though it always came back. By the end of the trip i was curled up towards the window praying to reach my station. 

I passed 6 stops before I was finally able to get out and head to my car. As the train came to a halt, I got up carefully and hobbled towards the parking lot. The waves of pain didn’t stop and were getting longer and more intense. By the time I got to my car I could barely exert the energy to open the door. It felt like with one wrong move, everything would come spilling out of me.

the wave that stopped me from opening my door subsided so I took the opportunity to throw my bag into the passenger seat, hop in and sit down. Though the sudden movement caused the next wave of pain to be so intense I screamed. I didn’t even feel queasy anymore—it felt like something was trapped inside my stomach trying to get out. Though, it wasn’t like a sharp clawing sensation but felt as if something was grabbing the lining of my stomach and trying to pull it apart—slowly. Like taking a rubber band and stretching it until it couldn’t get any more taut—then continuing to pull. the pain is getting so bad that I’m seeing stars and my vision is fading with white flashes in tandem with the waves.

The only relief I feel is when I yel

…

another one just hit me, this was the worst one yet. It sent me tumbling off the toilet where I lay in the fetal position on the ground screaming. I don’t understand, I don’t have to poop, I can’t throw up, WHAT IS HAPPENING TO ME??!?

…

oh my god.. I just took off my shirt while a wave of pain was hitting and looked down at my stomach… god it was—I still am not really sure what happened or if i hallucinated it from some weird pain induced vision. I saw my entire stomach crimp and wrinkle like muscles cramping. The skin writhed and bubbled.. at one point my skin was slithering around itself and over itself. it kind of reminded me of a blanket that was scrunched into a ball and thrown haphazardly on the ground… though like.. add an handful of snakes tangled in the blanket and then you could picture how it moved. The sounds I heard were indescribable—beyond any sounds that come from the worst indigestion or hunger, It tickled the back on my neck and gave me goosebumps, like hearing a dog yelp in the silence of night. The pain flashed me again and I couldn’t see. I almost passed out—well—i think… i felt my head hit the ground as I regained my vision. 

The wave was rolling back so I looked back down at my stomach. it looked normal.. as if nothing happened…

I don’t know.. somethings wrong with me and I don’t know what to do.. all i can do is sit on the toilet and wait for another wave of pain to hit. I’m gonna keep my shirt on from now on.. Whatever is happening i’d rather not see it.

I’m not too internet savvy i know how to do light research but im so bad with deciphering whats real or a scam. can you guys do some research and help me figure out whats going on?

I want to get sleep but it stresses me out to be far from the toilet… so I’m just going to curl up on the ground for tonight..

goodnight.
