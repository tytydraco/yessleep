Me and my girlfriend, Alex, moved into an apartment a couple months ago. It’s a small apartment on the outside of a small town. Just big enough for us and our cat. On the day we moved in my brother noticed a crawl space that looks like it’d lead to an attic but it’s an apartment complex and we’re on the top floor with no attic? We brushed it off not knowing what it was but not questioning it. We move in and there were no problems for weeks until one night.

It was a stormy night. We lay on the couch with our cat curled up on my lap fast asleep. Loud claps of thunder and lightning so bright it lights up the whole room is happening all around us. The rain lightens up, the thunder sounds miles away and the lightening comes to a stop. Just as we’re getting into bed for the night we hear a small knock coming from the other room. We look at each other and we both think it’s the cat knocking something over but he’s asleep on the pillows. To not freak us out we chalk it up to the house settling after the storm we just endured. 

We go to bed and in the middle of the night we both wake up to scratching. Not just cat or small animal scratches, deep and long scratches, followed by a loud bang and things falling. We both jump up, Alex grabs a bat and i get my phone ready to call 911. We both walk out of the room slowly making sure not to make any noise. We open the door and there is nothing there. We scan the house and don’t see anything besides the crawl space, it’s all tampered with. we’re both uneasy about it now…

A month had passed and we’ve both forgotten about the incident, nothing else has happened. No noises, scratches, things falling. Alex is leaving for a couple hours to go to a friends house. She said she will be back in a couple hours but it’s 9 pm i know i’m going to be asleep by the time she comes home. I finish doing my nightly routine and turn on some tv in bed. A couple hours pass and i hear a noise outside the room that jolts me awake and things are falling over. Of course she came home drunk again.  she’ll find her way back into here or pass out on the couch. I start to fade back into sleep when i feel her climb into bed next time to me and cuddle up beside me. “ I promise i won’t knock things over anymore i’m just so clumsy i’m so sorry” she says. i tell her it’s okay and we’ll clean it in the morning. She kisses my head and we go to bed. 

The next morning i wake up and she’s not in bed next to me. Kinda odd since she’s not one to get up right away in the mornings. I go out in the living room and she’s no where to be seen. weird. i start getting ready for the day and in she comes with flowers and a coffee. i tell her thank you and ask what these are for. she says she’s sorry she never came home last night she didn’t want to drive home when she’s been drinking. I tell her that’s impossible she laid in bed with me and was talking to me before we went to bed. 

Who was in my bed last night…?
