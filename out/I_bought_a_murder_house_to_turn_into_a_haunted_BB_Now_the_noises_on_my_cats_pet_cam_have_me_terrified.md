I knew the place had a past. I didn’t know the story wasn’t over.



The house looked way worse in person, but I knew what I was getting into when I bought the place. At least, that’s what I keep telling myself.



The listing had said “Victorian charm with a storied past,” but anyone within fifty miles knows what really happened there. I wasn’t trying to hide it. In fact, as a budding horror writer, I was counting on it. Paranormal tourism is big business, and the whole “haunted bed and breakfast” gimmick could only help my career.



I got out of my car and looked at the house. One of six aging Victorians. It stood beneath towering Live Oaks, with Spanish moss swaying like ghosts in the humid breeze. Locals called them the Sad Sisters — remnants of a small town that never quite took off. Too far inland. Too overshadowed by Florida’s coastal allure.



And then came the 1985 mass murder — the final nail in its coffin.



Perfect, I thought.



My plan was simple: move in with my cat, Ellie, make the necessary repairs to pass inspection, and start taking reservations for the Good Mourning Inn by Halloween. I even had a horror author YouTube channel set up to document the journey. This place was going to make me a name.



I flipped on my phone’s camera and gave myself a once-over. Eyes big and bright, wide smile, energy up. Showtime. I hit "Go Live".



“Welcome to my newest, creepiest, most ill-advised decision yet,” I said, turning the camera toward the house. “Say hello to the future site of the Good Mourning Inn... and possibly my untimely demise.”



I drew out “Mourning” with a playfully dark edge, lowering my voice for dramatic effect. My fans love this kind of stuff. 



The day was sunny and bright, so when I opened the front door, I felt like I was staring into a dark void. All the windows had been boarded up since... well, 1985. I carried Ellie’s pet carrier into the foyer. She pinned her ears back and growled.



“Oh, hush. You’re gonna love it here,” I said, doubting every word.



I put her carrier on the floor and unzipped the flap. She sat back in the corner, refusing to come out.



I couldn’t blame her. The air felt still and heavy, like the house had been holding its breath for decades.



My phone buzzed — an apology from the movers. “Your delivery’s been delayed until Monday.”



Great. I had a cat, a duffel bag, a half-charged phone, and an empty murder house.



I wandered into the kitchen and flipped the light switch. Nothing. I groaned. Apparently, the electricity hadn’t been turned on yet.



Just then, the front door clicked shut behind me, leaving me standing in near-total darkness. I heard Ellie growl in the foyer.



“At least you’ve got night vision,” I muttered.



That reminded me about Ellie’s pet cam. It had night vision too. As strange as it sounds, she has her own TikTok channel — and somehow, way more followers than I do. No idea why people love watching a cat wander around with a camera strapped to her neck... but the likes and shares help pay for her food and vet bills. So who was I to judge?



“Come here, Miss Ellie,” I said, gently coaxing her out of the carrier. She wasn’t thrilled, but she let me clip the camera to her collar. The moment it was secure, she sniffed the air like something offended her, then slinked off down the hall.



I propped the front door open to let in some light and took a look around. Dark wood paneling lined the foyer walls. An old chandelier, draped in cobwebs, hung motionless above me. To my right, a grand staircase twisted up into sinister-looking shadows.



Still, I could see the potential. Cleaned up. Restored. It would be gorgeous. Moody, atmospheric, just enough haunted charm to thrill the guests without driving them away.



Exactly what I’d imagined. Exactly what I needed.



I couldn’t wait to show my fans the place. I smoothed my hair, took a deep breath, and started recording.



“And here we are, guys. Murder house, day one.” I pulled an exaggerated, wide-eyed yikes expression, then swept the camera around the foyer, down the hallway, and up the shadowed staircase. In the phone’s light, it looked like something straight out of a horror film.



I walked upstairs. Each step creaked under my feet. “Yep, this is the house,” I said. “This is where I’ll be living from now on.”



In the master bedroom, I panned the camera across the faded, puke-green wallpaper peeling in strips. Ghostly outlines of long-gone furniture were imprinted on the walls. It was perfect for my purposes.



“Nope. Not sleeping in here,” I said flatly.



The bathroom wasn’t much better. The toilet and sink were both rust-stained, and the mirror above them was coated in grime. A dull film warped my reflection into something blurry and wrong. I zoomed in on my face, widened my eyes, and let out a theatrical shriek.



Inside, I smiled. They were going to love this.



There was another bedroom down the hall, somewhat cleaner, with bright yellow walls.



“I guess this is the room I’ll sleep in,” I said.



At the end of the nearly pitch-black hall was another door, shut tight. I didn’t need a floor plan to know what it was.



“This is it,” I whispered. “This is where it happened.”



I turned the camera on myself and tried to look terrified. Honestly, it wasn’t hard.



“Should I go in?” I said. “I’m sort of freaking out right now.”



I flipped the camera back around and showed my hand on the doorknob. Slowly, I twisted it. The door creaked open, inch by inch.



“Here we go. If you never hear from me again... please call the cops.”



I stepped in and was hit by a wave of foul air. Not just stale, like the rest of the house — something worse. Sour and deeply unpleasant. I held out my phone to light the room. Instantly, goosebumps rippled across my skin. My breath caught. For a moment, it felt like my heart stopped.



The room was empty. But the walls — once covered in whimsical children’s wallpaper — were stained and splattered with old, dried blood.



My jaw dropped. A cold flush of reality hit me, suffocating.



This wasn’t a setting for a horror novel. Not an aesthetic for thrill-seekers or ghost hunters. This was where it had happened. Not a story. Not fiction.



Real lives. Real death.



“What the fuck?” I blurted. “They didn’t even clean it up?”



The truth hit me hard: this wasn’t some haunted B&B fantasy. It was still a crime scene.



And now... I was living in it.



I turned the camera off. I needed out. Now. I bolted down the stairs and into the sunlight. What the hell had I gotten myself into?



I stood outside for a long minute, staring back at the house.



Get a grip, Joan, I told myself. Isn’t this exactly what you wanted?



A smile tugged at my lips. Yes. But that didn’t mean I wanted to spend the night inside.



I’d made up my mind — grab Ellie, drive back to JAX, and hole up in a hotel until I was ready to tackle this adventure. First, I just had to get her.



The sunshine gave me a little courage. I marched back inside, wedged the front door open, and started searching.



I called her name. Nothing.



I checked every room, upstairs and down. No cat.



Where the hell could she be? My gaze drifted to the one place I hadn’t checked. The basement door.



Still closed. No way she could’ve gotten in there... right?



I had to check. No way was I leaving without her.



I stopped in front of the basement door, phone flashlight in hand. With a deep breath, I eased it open.



A steep, narrow staircase disappeared into darkness below.



Carefully, I started down the steps.



“Ellie?” I called. My voice sounded small.



The air was cool and thick with the scent of age and dampness. A musty chill settled over my skin.



To my surprise, the basement was much larger than I’d expected. The shadows stretched far beyond the reach of my phone’s glow. I moved slowly, sweeping the light across the space. The farther I went, the more something felt... wrong. The space seemed too large, like it extended beyond the house’s footprint.



Weird. But hey — incredible bonus for the B&B, right?



“Ellie? Are you down here?” I called. “Ellie? Come here, kitty. Meow meow.”



Silence.



At the far end, I stopped in front of a solid concrete wall with a door embedded in it.



A door? Down here?



Curiosity pushed aside caution. I reached for the handle. Locked.



I gave it a shake, but it wouldn’t budge. The longer I stared, the more unsettling it felt. Why was it here? What lay beyond? And why did it feel like it wasn’t meant to be opened?



Just then, my phone buzzed. Notifications poured in — tons of new comments on my channel. I couldn’t resist. I tapped to check.



“OMG I love this place already, it’s sooo creepy!!”



“Dude, DO NOT go down that basement!!”



“Joan pls tell me you’re not sleeping there tonight”



“There’s def some bad juju in that house”



“Where’s Ellie? I wanna see the kitty cam!!!”



Yes. The pet cam. Why didn’t I think of that earlier?



I tried to open Ellie’s cam, but the screen just spun, no video. Only the audio came through: a burst of static… then kibble crunching… Ellie, eating somewhere. But the sound cut off abruptly, replaced by a low, tense rumble in her throat. A growl.



A long second passed.



Then — creeeeak.



The unmistakable groan of a floorboard.



My pulse spiked. The audio feed crackled as if something jolted the mic. Ellie’s growl turned frantic, building into a hiss. Then scampering paws, thumping hard and fast against wood. She was running. Not toward me, but away — deeper into the house. The audio dipped, muffled, like she’d plunged somewhere enclosed. Faint thumps echoed behind her, heavy and deliberate. Footsteps.



I froze, staring at the locked door in front of me. The feed grew echoey, damp-sounding. Basement? How?



A skittering stop. Then frantic scratching. Meows turned to yowls, high and desperate. Claws on something unyielding. And those footsteps... closer now. Slow. Heavy. Leather creaking.



The audio erupted into chaos. Ellie’s furious screeches pierced the speaker. Claws raking, teeth snapping. A low, guttural yell cut through, male and ragged. Grunts of effort. The mic shook with thuds and scuffles, like a fight in the dark. Then — a sharp hiss of static.



A burst. Then nothing.



My heart slammed against my ribs. Ellie — my Ellie — trapped in there. With... whoever that was.



I leaned in, ear pressed to the door. Silence from this side. But the app... dead air. My instincts screamed at me to run — to get the hell out — but I couldn’t leave her.



I gripped the doorknob. This time it turned easily. Unlocked.



My pulse roared in my ears. I was shaking. Terrified.



I pushed the door open. Total darkness. A black hole. I reached in with my phone, trying to catch some of it in the light.



My breath caught. A tunnel. Dirt floor, dirt walls. Rough, uneven, like something dug it by hand.



“Ellie,” I whispered. “Mommy’s here. Come on, girl. We need to go. Meow... meow.”



Nothing. Only silence.



I stepped inside.



The air hit me. Musty, foul... and something worse. A thick, sour stench. Sweat. Decay.



“Ellie?” My voice cracked.



Then — something pressed down on the back of my neck. Cold. Heavy. A hand.



I froze. Couldn’t move. Could barely breathe.



That awful reek filled my nose and mouth. I gagged. My stomach heaved.



A voice rasped in my ear, low, rough, full of hate:



“My tragedy is not your entertainment.”



I didn’t think. I didn’t breathe.



I bolted. Raced up those stairs two at a time, phone clenched in a death grip. Through the front door, into the daylight — if you could call it that. The sun was already sinking behind the trees, the yard awash in long shadows.



I ran straight to my car and slammed the door shut, locking it behind me.



For a long time, I just sat there. Shaking. My heart hammering so loud I could barely think. I kept glancing at the house. At that open door. At the windows, dark as eyes.



I don’t know what I heard down there. I don’t know what just happened.



All I know is that Ellie’s still inside.



And I’m not going back in there alone.



Not tonight.



The sun’s going down fast. I’ll stay in the car for a bit... try to think. Figure out what to do.



If anyone’s watching this — if you know anything about this house, or that door, or whoever the hell that was — please tell me.



I’m scared out of my mind right now.
