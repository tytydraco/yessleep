“— In Jesus’ Name, Amen.”

“Amen!” Came the resounding response of the congregation. 

“Y’all have a safe trip back home, and if y’all wanna come to the 6:30 service this evening that’ll be right nice of ya.” Pastor Blake Cunningham gave that trademark smile of his. The kind that could win over a skeptic— and maybe a lady or two if he so pleased. 

Pastor Blake had been the pastor of Living Word Bible Church for about seven years now. He’d first started the church out of his garage when he quit the bottle after an intense long night of prayer and a few close calls with the barrel of a .357 he kept tucked away in the glove compartment of his Ford F-150. He’d picked up the Gideon New Testament he had half-heartedly received coming out the local Kwik-e-Mart, and lo! It had become the catalyst of his own personal salvation. So, he tearfully gave his life to Jesus on the unswept floor of that garage, and little more than two years later his congregation had swollen to the point a new venue was needed.

That was when he’d met Sara. Oh she was a beauty. Fresh out of college, the 22-year old Sara was an odd mate for the 32-year old Blake, and he knew for a fact he’d married up. She’d just come home after getting a brand new teaching degree, but her father’s untimely passing necessitated staying close to home to watch over Mama Driscoll. Pastor Blake had a great in-law too. He’d been welcomed in with open arms by Sara’s mama, and he was quite happy about it. They’d met one night when Sara came up during altar call after a particularly heart-pulling sermon about Jesus’ love for the worst of sinners, and “Discipleship Counseling” turned into love from there.

They’ve been married for about 4 years now. Got a few kids— all babies— but he was greatly blessed to have all boys. Well, as he told Sara, at least.

The congregation piled out of the 10:00 AM service at a trickle. The Martins stopped to talk to the Stevensons, the ladies of the Richards and the Fowler families stopped to share a bit of gossip, and the boys of the Hernandez and the Philips families horsed around before being pulled away by their respective mothers. Such was the weekly routine of a church of 4,000 plus, but Pastor Blake wouldn’t have it any other way.

As the last members made their way out, Deacon James Caulfield stopped before exiting.

“Yo, Pastor Blake!”

“Yeah? Whatcha need James?” 

The deacon stepped back in, shutting the door just ever so slightly, leaving it cracked. 

“Don’t want ya forgettin’, but we got five baptisms during the evenin’ service. We let it slip last time and Mikey got a bit, shall we say, flustered, about the whole ordeal.”

Pastor Blake rolls his eyes and smiles. “You tell big man Mike we won’t forget. But if he starts gettin’ impatient I might just have to give him a few more weeks of ‘discipleship’ courses.” He lets out a chuckle.

“Gotcha, I’ll let him know!” He starts to head out the door, but quickly turns back around. 

“Oh, by the way, you bringin’ the drinks for the kickback after the evening service?”

Pastor Blake lightly tosses his head back and gives a chort. “Yes James, I’m bringing the drinks.”

“Oh, good.” He stops for a moment. “And it’s the good stuff, right?” He raised an investigative eyebrow.

“Yes James, it’s the good stuff. We ain’t Baptists, after all.”

That gets a laugh out of both of them. Kind of an inside joke between the two, given that Deacon James had been a Baptist before making his way to Living Water after a falling out with the new pastor at his old church, the First Baptist Church (there are three that bear the same title) of Jefferson County. 

“Alright, ya take care pastor, imma run some errands for the wife real quick and I’ll see ya again for the evenin’ service.”

“See ya, drive safe now!” The two men exchanged farewells, and Pastor Blake was alone. Now, it was off to the office to make sure everything was in order. Definitely don’t wanna forget those baptisms, and can’t forget to remind people about the kickback, or the holiday fundraiser, or— who’s that in the office?

He had barely managed to make it back to the office door when he noticed the strange individual sitting in the chair stationed in front of his desk. He was a tall man, at least from what he could tell. He was dressed in what looked like black fatigues, including a pair of combat boots. It looked like he was wearing a mask of some sort, but he was facing away from the door and Pastor Blake was unable to see for sure. He didn’t know what to make of this new visitor, but he’d at least try to get him out the door before the first families started showing up.

“May I help you sir?”

When the man turned around Pastor Blake was put further on edge. He was wearing a mask— blank, featureless, and porcelain white, defaced with what looked like a letter “P” painted on in black paint. 

“Yes, pastor, I’m in need of guidance.”

Pastor Blake noted how unnervingly calm the stranger was. He could almost feel a serenity dripping off every word he spoke, and all her said was one sentence. It was peaceful, but still eerie— like when the forest goes quiet because a predator is near.

“Well, I’ll be happy to speak atcha,” Pastor Blake walks past the man— careful not let himself come in contact with him— and takes his seat in the cushioned roller chair behind the desk. “What kind of ‘guidance’ are ya needin’?” 

The man spoke, that eerie serenity still omnipresent in his voice. “Do you believe in God’s vengeance, pastor?”

It’d been a while since Blake had actually preached on that. Not that he’d been willingly neglecting it, just that he’d been unable to find a way to make it topical to the  lives of his people. 

“Yes,” the pastor says unwearily. “I do.” That’s all he could muster as a response before his mind shifted to just how glad he was that Sara was home with the babies and not here with this… whatever he was.

The stranger begins to speak. “And do you believe that God’s Law is eternal?”

Another strange question. “Listen, I know you’re probably just curious, but I really don’t have time for a debate on Scripture today, is there any way you might wanna come to the evening service? What’s your name, by the way?”

The stranger took a few seconds to respond, staring at the pastor with calm, yet somehow predatory eyes. “Phineas,” he finally said. “You may call me Phineas.” 

“Well Phin, if you want just come back by this evening and we can chat a little more, we have a kickback after the last service if you’d be—“ 

Phineas interrupts him. “I’m not interested in your outpouring of drunken gluttony. I’ve come because I’ve been sent from Him to do His work.”

Pastor Blake was taken aback. He’d had some rude people, mainly a bunch of denominational folk or some edgy atheists lobbing insults, but this blatant disrespect? In his own office? He could never.

“Alright now listen, if you’re gonna be disrespectful in a church, you can go ahead and get right on outta—“ 

Interrupted again. “Does your wife now about the other woman?”

Phineas didn’t move the whole time he spoke, and Pastor Blake was left speechless. How did he know about Patty? 

“Okay, I don’t know how you got this information, but what happens in my marriage is between me, my wife, and the Lord, and I don’t need some weirdo in a mask comin’ in here and tellin’ me how to—“

Interrupted again. “Does she know you forced that woman to kill your unborn child? Or that you valued your brand more than you valued the life of your own blood?”

Pastor Blake stood up, furious. “Listen asshole! I’ve had it just up to here with your bullshit, and if you don’t get the Hell out of my church right now, I’m gonna toss you out on your—“

Like a triggered response. “Does she know that’s it not just women you’ve sinned with?”

That was it. Pastor Blake rose from his seat and threw a solid punch at the guy, but the stranger almost immediately countered by grabbing his arm and wrenching it, forcing him to his knees. He screamed in pain as Phineas continued bending.

“Adultery. Deceit. Murder. Sodomy. Abomination.” Phineas then proceeded to snap Pastor Blake’s arm like a twig with one motion, leaving his forearm crooked and the bone jutting through his flesh. In an instant the 6’2 mountain of a man-of-God was crumpled on the ground like a used napkin, writhing in pain and weeping, cowering behind his desk and vainly trying to get away from ‘Phineas.’

“As I said before pastor, I’m here on the Lord’s business,” Phineas walked slowly towards the crying heap on the ground. “The business of judgment. And judgment—“ he says as he turns Blake over and proceeds to stop his femurs until a loud ‘snap’ can be heard. 

“Begins at the House of God.”

———————————————————————

“Pastor Blake, I’m back! Ya ready to get this holy shindig started?” Deacon James walked into a church that was quiet. Usually he’d hear Blake’s computer blasting ‘Metallica’ or ‘Five Finger Death Punch’ to pump himself up for the service, but this time it was a dead quiet.

“Pastor?” He called out. He hits the lights, brightening the whole room like the first verses of Genesis. 

Still nothing. “Must be in his office.”

Deacon James made the walk through the auditorium to the hall adjacent to the office, and immediately noticed the door was open. That wasn’t too unusual, but the quiet of it all made for an eerie scene. 

“Blake? You ready yet bub? People boutta be showin’ up any time and ya need to be ready to— Oh My God!“ he stopped dead in his tracks when he saw the horror scene in the office space. 

The first thing he saw was the message scrawled on the wall in blood. 

“JUDGMENT BEGINS AT THE HOUSE OF GOD”

Then he saw the body. Blake was lying in a large pool of his own blood, his right arm and both legs visibly broken. His shirt had been cut open, and from his throat to crotch a message had been literally etched into his carcass— the look of terror on his face— which James just now noticed was devoid of eyes— showed that he’d been alive when this was done. The words were marred with blood and gore, but even in the viscera they could be seen.

“ADULTERY
DECEIT
MURDER
SODOMY”

Deacon James ran to grab the phone, after vomiting up earlier’s communion of unleavened bread wafers and grape juice, slipped on a puddle of his friends blood, and panickedly punched in 911. 

The rest of the day was one of tears, sirens, and questions. But even amidst all of them, one reigned supreme:

“Who could’ve done this?”
