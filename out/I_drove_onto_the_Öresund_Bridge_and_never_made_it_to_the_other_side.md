I had been driving for a long time, all the way from Haparanda down to Malmö. It wasn’t a journey I had any real desire to make, but my sister was on her deathbed (leukemia). We had never been close; our relationship had unraveled back in childhood when she killed my rabbit, and we hadn’t spoken in more than twenty-five years. Still, the family insisted on my presence in Copenhagen, and since I didn’t want them all turning against me, I was on my way there now. I was sweating inside my car, an old Volvo I hadn’t quite finished fixing up, with no air conditioning, and I was exhausted after the long drive. When I finally reached the Öresund Bridge, the one that would take me from Sweden to Denmark, a haze of drowsiness settled over me. While waiting behind someone with British plates who had been stopped by the bridge police, I nodded off for a second. I slapped myself across the face to stay awake, then pulled out onto the fifteen-kilometer stretch of bridge.

Struggling to keep my eyes open, I looked at a few seagulls that had gathered around some trash someone had thrown out of their car farther ahead. On the radio, they were talking about the murder of Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania—that was all they had been talking about for weeks now. I was growing tired of the chatter and was just about to change the channel when the sound suddenly became distorted in a strange way, and then, without warning, the volume surged so loudly it gave me a headache. After that, I am not entirely sure what happened, except that I must have blacked out—or maybe I simply fell asleep. When I woke up—groggy, as if I had downed several strong beers, though I certainly had not—the car was standing still in the middle of the bridge.

My vision was blurry, so the first thing I noticed—aside from the usual—was the silence. The radio, the engine, the traffic, even the wind outside my rolled-down window—none of it could be heard. The silence was so absolute that I briefly believed I had gone deaf, until I heard my own low moan. As my senses returned to focus, I saw the bridge stretching out in front of me. The silence was immediately explained. The bridge was empty. Just moments before, I had seen traffic in both directions as far as the eye could reach. Now, I couldn’t see a single car. I looked in the rearview mirror—no difference. My pulse quickened, as if my body recognized something was deeply wrong before my mind had caught up. Confused, with a sense of dread swelling steadily inside me, I stepped out of the car. The sun was still high in the sky and the heat was just as unbearable as before, if not worse. I walked a little onto the road and looked around in both directions, muttering curses under my breath. Before I lost consciousness, I had still seen Sweden in the rearview mirror, but now the bridge simply vanished into the horizon. In fact, I couldn’t see any land at all.

When I leaned over the railing and looked down, the water—clearer than I had expected—seemed completely still. I let out a short laugh, not because I found the situation funny, but simply because of how absurd it all was. "What the hell is going on?" I said, scratching my head. I walked back to the car and picked up my cellphone, which I had stored in the glove compartment so I wouldn’t get distracted while driving. It showed that there was coverage, but when I tried calling a friend, the call didn’t even start to ring. The same thing happened no matter who I called, even when I dialed emergency services. "What the hell, am I dreaming or something?" I mumbled to myself, even though I knew I wasn’t. I wiped the sweat from my forehead and sat down in the car. "Think, think, think," I said, but no matter how much I tried, I couldn’t make sense of the situation. There simply was no explanation. Had I passed out and been forgotten while the entire bridge was evacuated? No, this was something else entirely. Especially considering that the bridge—though I hadn’t driven it in years—no longer looked the same. Far ahead, just barely visible as a thin line, it curved off to the right and disappeared into the horizon.

I turned the key in the ignition, half expecting the car not to start, but to my relief, it did. The radio came on as well, but all that came through the speakers was static. I slowly turned the tuner to change the frequency, but was met with nothing but more static. On one frequency, however, I thought I could hear something faint behind the noise. It sounded like a soft whisper. No matter how hard I strained to make it out, I couldn’t understand what it was saying—or even be sure that it was saying anything at all. Eventually, I gave up and turned off the radio—the noise was making me nauseous.

Even though I knew it was pointless, I shouted out through the window. "Hello!" No response. I raised my voice. "Hello, is there anyone who can hear me?" Still no reply. I honked the horn once, then twice, then three times—after that I held it down for a full ten seconds. When I released it, the sound cut off instantly—there was no echo at all. Now there was only one thing left to do, and that was to drive. I had almost a full tank after stopping in Malmö, so I wasn’t particularly worried about running out of gas in the middle of the bridge. With my sweaty hands gripping the steering wheel, I took a deep breath, then pressed down on the accelerator. The sound of the engine broke through the oppressive silence, and it calmed my nerves more than I had expected.

As soon as I picked up some speed, I finally felt the wind—still hot, but at least moving. It chipped away at the surreal feeling, just a little. The anxiety, however, remained. The realization that I was no longer on the Öresund Bridge grew heavier with each passing second as I looked out over the empty road and the perfectly clear blue sea, which lay unnaturally still in every direction. Beyond the obvious—that the bridge was completely deserted and seemed endlessly long—there was something about the atmosphere that felt unnatural in a way I couldn’t describe. More than anything else, it was that atmosphere that made me feel like I had ended up in another place entirely, somewhere no one was ever meant to be.

The bridge didn’t straighten out. After driving for an hour, everything looked exactly the same, as if I hadn’t moved at all. But I had. I had seen the road pass beneath the car, I had seen the railing of the bridge blur by. And yet… I wiped the sweat from my forehead and pressed the gas pedal a little harder. After another hour—leaving me with only about five hours before the fuel would run out—it still looked exactly the same, and I started to fear that I would never make it off the bridge. Something had changed, though, I realized—the sun had moved across the sky. I kept driving for just over an hour, noting the sun’s slow descent toward the horizon. When dusk finally began to fall, the fatigue I had felt earlier returned. My anxiety about what was happening had kept it at bay, but now, nothing in the world could have kept me awake. I stopped, stepped out onto the road, and walked a short distance away to relieve myself. Yawning, I looked out over the sea that was in the process of swallowing the sun. It was a beautiful sunset, almost like a painting. But at the same time, there was something strange about it—it looked too much like a painting. I stood there watching for quite a long time.

The darkness that crept in made me uneasy. I had never been afraid of the dark—that would be impossible growing up in Norrland—but now it felt like it was hiding something threatening. I jogged back to the car, rolled up the window, and lay down in the backseat. Before I fell asleep, I wondered whether I had somehow been drugged and kidnapped—taken to some secret structure in the middle of one of the seven seas. But how could something like that possibly be kept hidden? Then I considered whether it might instead be some kind of parallel universe—had I glitched out somehow and left my own reality behind? But why would there be a bridge—a manmade structure—in a world without people? I couldn’t make sense of it. The thought struck me that maybe this was some kind of afterlife. Had I fallen asleep behind the wheel, crashed, and died without realizing it? I didn’t believe in the soul, so I tried to push the idea away, but I’ll admit it made me a little afraid.

Eventually, I fell asleep. I don’t know how long I slept, but I woke just before the sun came up. The sky had already begun to lighten—just as clear as before, but at this hour before sunrise it had taken on a peculiar blue-gray hue. I suddenly realized I hadn’t seen any stars the night before—or had I simply not thought about them? No, the sky had been pitch black. I opened the car door and stepped outside. The air was mild now. I walked around to the back of the car and opened the trunk. That was where I kept a crate of water bottles I had bought to get me through the drive from Haparanda, and fortunately I hadn’t used up much of it. I took one and drank a few mouthfuls. Things were worse when it came to food. I had a few snacks in the backseat, and that was all. Back in the car, I ate a little, then started driving again. I turned the radio back on and once more tried to find a station playing something other than static. Finally, I managed to pick something up. Elevator music. I felt a flicker of hope that someone would start speaking, but the music didn’t stop, and after a while it faded back into static. This didn’t bring me any closer to understanding what was going on. I changed frequencies as I drove, but found nothing new, and eventually turned the radio off.

When the fuel began to run low, after I had driven for nearly seven hours straight, I came to a stop. There was no point in continuing any further. I should have realized it sooner, but the thought had seemed simply too impossible, even though the answer had been right in front of my eyes. Now, though, I could no longer deny it. The bridge was a circle. That massive curve on the horizon had never straightened out. Of course, there was still a chance I hadn’t completed a full loop—I regretted not placing something on the road to check—and that there might still be an exit somewhere. But something inside me told me that wasn’t the case.

I left the car with my water bottle and walked over to the bridge railing. How long would the water last? A few days, maybe a little more than a week if I rationed it. I drank the last of what was in the bottle. Out of sheer frustration, I screamed as loudly as I could and threw the water bottle over the railing. I watched it as it fell. It took longer to hit the water than I had expected. I began to wonder how high above the sea the bridge actually was—it wasn’t easy to judge by eye, but it had to be nearly five hundred meters, higher than what I assumed was normal for bridges.

I sat down with my back against the concrete. Everything on the bridge was clinically clean. There wasn’t a single stain anywhere. No signs that anyone had ever used the bridge. I started thinking about what options I had. Calling someone was impossible, the car wouldn’t get more than a mile or two now, and there was no way down from the bridge—not that it would necessarily help. But maybe there was a way? The concrete pillars were massive. I wondered if there might be a staircase inside them that led down to the water, some kind of emergency exit.

Without having any idea what I would do if I actually managed to reach the water, I got up and sat back in the car, then drove until I was directly above one of the pillars. I stepped out and inspected the area, searching for some kind of door or hatch, but to my disappointment I saw nothing. I walked back to the car, frustrated, and kicked the front wheel while cursing under my breath. Confused and bitter about the situation, I sat down in the driver’s seat.

My eyes fell on the radio. The elevator music I had heard must have been broadcast from somewhere, I thought. That meant there had to be a station or a transmitter of some kind out there. The thought filled me with a brief sense of excitement, but I had no idea what to do with that information. As far as I knew, the radio station could be a thousand kilometers away, and I didn’t have a transmitter myself, so it wasn’t like I could contact anyone. All I could do, I realized with a sense of resignation, was wait. I turned the radio back on and switched between frequencies, but it was all in vain.

Then I suddenly heard a faint splash. If it hadn’t been for the complete silence otherwise, I never would have noticed it. Something had disturbed the surface of the water. I rushed to the edge of the bridge, saw nothing, then ran to the other side to check there instead. That was when I saw something that made me shudder with fear. A colossal shadow moved beneath the surface, so large it had to be several hundred meters across, if not more. It had the shape of an octopus, with tentacles so long I feared they might be able to reach all the way up to me. In that moment, I knew with certainty that I was no longer on Earth. I felt as if I might faint from terror as I stared down at the creature while it slowly drifted beneath the water. Then it suddenly dove and disappeared. From that moment on, I made sure to stay in the middle of the bridge—I didn’t want that monster, whatever it was, to catch sight of me. At the same time, I was thankful I hadn’t found any way down to the water.

I walked back to the car and slowly drove it to the middle of the road. Had I somehow been kidnapped by aliens and taken to another planet where they had built this bizarre bridge just for me? It didn’t seem likely—I wasn’t the kind of person who believed in UFOs, and besides—what, they had supposedly abducted my entire car in broad daylight and managed to travel several light-years away in an instant?

After the sun had gone down, I once again lay down in the backseat with the doors locked. Thoughts of the enormous octopus crept in. Could it really reach me? I imagined a tentacle tearing the car from the bridge and shivered with fear. No, I told myself, I was far too high up for it—unless it could climb one of the pillars. That thought was no comfort at all. After trying to fall asleep for an hour, I moved back into the front seat. "What the hell am I supposed to do?" I asked myself. Realistically speaking, I didn’t have much time left. As soon as I finished the last of my water, it would all go downhill quickly. How painful was it to die of thirst? I wasn’t entirely sure, but it probably wasn’t a pleasant story. Maybe it would be better just to jump. From this height, it would be like hitting concrete. I pushed the thought away—I wasn’t ready to give up. I turned the radio on again and twisted the tuner back and forth. Then suddenly, I picked up the elevator music again. There was something melancholic about it. I listened until I started to feel tired, then turned off the radio and returned to the backseat. I lay on my back and looked up at the window. There really wasn’t a single star in the sky.

A week, or perhaps even more, passed exactly like this. No people, no clouds in the sky—only me, the bridge, and the scorching sun. I had only one bottle of water left. The hunger was wearing me down, even though I would probably die of thirst first. The end was close now, I knew that, and I started thinking more seriously about jumping.

While drinking a very small sip of water, I thought that at the very least, I could choose how I died. It struck me that my sister was probably dead by now. The thought made me sad in a way I hadn’t expected. I imagined what it could have been like if we had reconciled, if one of us had reached out and made the effort. I felt even more sorrow when I thought about my parents. Now they would likely lose both their children. They were probably already worried about me. I must have vanished without a trace. How could that have happened? Did someone see my car disappear into thin air? Was it caught on some camera somewhere? I pushed the thoughts away. By this point, I had come to realize that there was no point in dwelling on anything. As the sun began to set, I walked over to what I called my “toilet,” which was just a section of the bridge far enough from my car that I wouldn’t have to smell my own waste.

While relieving myself, I thought I saw something glint in the sunlight for a split second, far off on the bridge, right where it thinned into a faint line at the horizon. I froze, lost my breath. Had I really seen something? I stared at the spot where I thought the flash had appeared, fixed my gaze without blinking. But I saw nothing. Most likely, I thought, it had been nothing at all—just dehydration making me see stars. Slowly, I walked back to the car, and as I did, the sea and the asphalt were painted with the colors of the setting sun. Later, surrounded by darkness and lying in the backseat, thinking about my approaching death, I suddenly noticed something reflected in the rearview mirror. Filled with both fear and hope for rescue, I sat up quickly and looked out through the back window. And sure enough—two small yellow dots appeared in the darkness out there, maybe three hundred meters away. A car. I swallowed hard. Part of me wanted to rush out and run toward it, to embrace whoever had appeared, but another part of me responded just like it had when I saw the octopus—with pure terror.

Why was the car just standing there with its headlights on? Why had it stopped without turning off the engine? It felt as if the driver knew I was here—even though it should have been impossible to see me from such a distance in the dark—and as if they were watching me, waiting. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up at the thought. Then, suddenly, it struck me that the driver might have left the car and was already on their way toward me. Panic seized me—just a few days ago, I had stopped locking the car doors. I shot up, fumbling in the dark, and slammed down the lock buttons as fast as I could—one, two, three, four—and then froze in terror. Someone pulled on the handle of the driver’s side door, then the handle on the passenger side. “Hello!” I shouted, terrified—unable to see anything outside in the dark. “Who the hell are you and what do you want?” No answer. The person tried the doors on the other side as well, methodically testing them, searching for one that wasn’t locked. “Answer me!” I demanded, desperate, but was met only with silence. My heart pounded in my chest. If this had been someone who ended up here by accident, like me—there’s no way they would act like this. This was someone who belonged to this place, or—my mind recoiled at the thought—something. At last, when I managed to regain some control, I grabbed my phone—which still had a little battery left since I had kept it off—and turned on the flashlight. I managed to shine it outside for just a few seconds—without seeing anyone at all—before the battery died.

This became the longest night since I arrived in this terrible, desolate place. I lay awake, staring at the other car’s headlights, which refused to go out. When the sun finally rose—to my immense relief—I saw the other car as a dark shape in the distance. The driver, I thought, must have gotten back inside. I stayed in my own car well into the day. “What the hell do you want?” I whispered under my breath.

At last, a little braver in the daylight and driven by sheer desperation, I left the car and revealed myself. Someone was sitting inside that black car, staring back at me. I couldn't see them, but I knew they were there. The thought filled me with dread. I looked at my water bottle. Just a few sips left now. The realization that I had nothing to lose took some of the edge off the fear. No matter how I looked at it, I was going to die here—so I might as well die confronting the other, who might be able to give me answers. Still, I didn’t want to approach unarmed. There wasn’t much I could use as a weapon. In the trunk, I found a screwdriver. It would serve well as a blunt weapon, but for now I used it to detach the windshield wiper hose. With it, I drained the last bit of fuel from the tank into one of the empty water bottles. Then I tore a strip from my shirt and stuffed it into the bottle’s opening. Grateful that I had never managed to quit smoking completely, I dug out a lighter from between the seats. After that—armed with the screwdriver and my Molotov cocktail—I felt a little safer, ready to face whoever, or whatever, it was that had been driving the other car.

With the relentless sun on my back and sweat running down my temples, I walked toward the black vehicle. My heart pounded in my chest. This might very well be the last thing I ever did. My life seemed to flash before me—childhood, when I still used to play with my sister, my first crush in preschool, my engineering studies, the day my uncle died of cancer (same as the one my sister got), the purchase of the house I had dreamed about for so long… That it would all end like this was something I could never have imagined. Everything was silent, yet I could hear my pulse pounding behind my temples.

Up close, I saw that the car resembled a black De Tomaso Pantera, from the early 1970s. The windows were pitch black, impossible to see through. I held up my Molotov cocktail and the lighter, then shouted at the driver to come out. Silence. I swallowed hard. “Come out!” Nothing happened. I stepped forward a little more, cautiously. Now there were only about three meters between us. I stopped… I didn’t want to go up and knock on the window. “Hello? Who are you? What do you want?” No response. A few long minutes passed, then the silence was broken. The engine of the car in front of me suddenly growled to life, falling into a rough, uneven rhythm that made the chassis tremble slightly. Then came the screech of tires against asphalt, the smoke, and before I—exhausted as I was—had time to react, the car lunged toward me like a black panther pouncing on its prey. I jumped out of the way a fraction of a second before it would have hit me and landed by the bridge railing, pain flaring in my shoulder. “Shit, shit, shit,” I whispered. “That bastard wants to kill me.” I heard the car skidding farther ahead, making a sharp 180. I picked up the bottle and the lighter I had dropped and slowly got to my feet. Then I stepped into the middle of the road.

My rival stood still, like an enraged bull scraping its hoof against the ground. There was no hope of getting answers anymore—it was either me or whoever was behind the wheel of that car. Then smoke rose from the tires again. The car charged at me at full speed, ready to swerve in whatever direction I might jump. I lit the cloth in the bottle. “Come on, you bastard,” I said. The meters between us shrank with every fraction of a second that passed. If I had acted a moment later, I would have been run over—or maybe even shoved off the bridge—but I hurled the bottle and leapt aside at exactly the right moment. I didn’t see it land, but I heard the glass shatter against the car and the flames that instantly engulfed it. I looked up as fast as I could. The car skidded, spun, and slammed into the bridge railing with such force that it went over the edge. I ran to the railing. The car plummeted toward the sea like a burning comet and exploded as it hit the water’s surface. At first, I stood there stunned. Then I shouted with joy—I had won.

But my joy was short-lived. I heard a horrifying scream behind me—an unnatural roar that made my clothes tremble. Filled with dread, I slowly turned around and saw two enormous tentacles rising above the bridge. The octopus had returned, as if it had come to avenge what I had done. I threw the screwdriver at the creature and looked toward my car, as if it could somehow protect me now. Then I let out a deep sigh as the monstrous creature revealed itself. The entire bridge swayed beneath me. I knew I would never be able to defeat this beast. But I didn’t want to let it catch me. I climbed up onto the bridge railing, closed my eyes, and just before the creature could reach me, I let myself fall backward. The unnaturally still air screamed in my ears as I plummeted toward the water. Then everything went dark.

I woke up, completely naked, on a cold chalk cliff on the island of Møn. Below me, the sea foamed. It smelled of salt, seaweed, life. In the distance, a seagull cried. For the first time in what felt like an eternity, there was a sound I did not fear. My whole body ached as I rose to my feet. I don’t remember very clearly what happened after that, but eventually I was found and taken to a hospital—grateful to be back. But I wasn’t back. Most things were the same, but not everything. The hospital was never able to reach any of my relatives, as if they didn’t exist at all. When I looked up at the television mounted above my hospital bed, it quickly became clear that a number of things were different—most notably the fact that Trump had survived the assassination attempt. I kept quiet about my experience, claimed memory loss—until now, now that I feel somewhat safe and have managed to build a new life here. But sometimes, I still see a black De Tomaso Pantera. Behind me in traffic on the way to work, speeding through a red light just as I’m about to cross the street, gliding silently along the road below my apartment. In those moments, my heart always leaps into my throat, and I freeze in place, gripped by fear.
