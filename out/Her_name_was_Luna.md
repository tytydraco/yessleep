Have you ever been on a long road trip through the U.S., especially through the mountains and woodland, only to find yourself driving through one of those small towns? One that you’d barely describe as a town, more like a series of buildings alongside a road, every residential home houses a person who works just down the street, and everyone knows the name of everyone else. Even the most reclusive residents like myself at least have a good understanding of everyone’s most basic personality traits.  My town specifically, is on a long stretch of road in between two wide sweeps of wilderness. We get the occasional tourist coming through, however, it’s mostly truck drivers, loggers and national park service workers. 



Most common of all though, are hunters. There are miles of forest and wildlife. Hunting was allowed; however my area had a reputation for being a particularly difficult spot. My mom always told me it was because it was a popular spot, so the animals learned to get crafty. It also has a reputation for people disappearing. Stories of people vanishing into thin air, or going into the woods and not coming out. Statistically speaking, it’s no different than any other part of the US of a similar climate, though attention is still drawn when combined with how the wildlife act. 



The locals tend to keep to the town; however, we have some here to enjoy hunting in the woods. Micha, the local butcher, is one such man; he goes on a 2-week-long trip every year, hunting Deer and selling the meat around Christmas. The town's librarian and their family also go on small trips every year into the deep woods. 



Then there is me, I’ve been hunting since I was a kid. It started with my father; he’s taken me on trips every year since I was 11. We didn’t agree on a lot. My old man is a very traditionally masculine man, into sports, constantly working in his car, and drinking anytime he isn’t working. Meanwhile, I grew up a lot softer. That’s how he puts it at least. All my friends were girls, I was more interested in princesses and fairy tales. Hunting was the only thing my dad and I could both enjoy, a father-son activity. Not to say that it was “the glue that held our relationship together”. Any time we weren’t hunting it was a very distant relationship. 



One that grew a lot more distant after he cheated on my mom. She kept him around, though, kept making excuses and getting mad at him whenever he inevitably did it again. She never left, though. I couldn’t tell you why. By that point, I had started hunting on my own. Dangerous I know, if I ever got hurt or attacked by an animal, no one would know for days, but I make do. I make sure to stick to the areas near paths and keep a radio on me that links back to Micha the butchers. He gave it to me once when we crossed paths in the woods a few years back. 



My last trip out, however, wasn’t made with these precautions in mind. It started when I was getting home from work. I had recently started working part-time at the local butcher's, Micha, who offered me a job after I told him I was short on cash for hunting supplies. It has been a slow day with most people inside due to the rain, so Micha gave the rest of the day off. I took a walk down the long street that surrounds the main road, gripping my coat tightly around me until I got to my home, finding the door unlocked. I’d let out a deep sigh as I opened the door, I knew exactly what this meant. 

 

So I just threw my coat on a hook, kicked off my shoes as quickly as possible and ran upstairs, ignoring the sounds of adultery, unfortunately echoing from the living room. Once I got to my bedroom, I just got in bed and put on my headphones, playing music to drown out the noise. If this had been a few years ago, I would have stepped in, but I knew the cycle at this point. Later that day the music that once muffled moans and giggling now barely covered the argument and screaming from my mother and father. I remember thinking about how, when other people’s parents are caught cheating, usually that involves a divorce or some custody battle and how it was unfair that I had to live it over and over again. I realise neither option is better, but that doesn’t stop me from complaining. 



This argument was long; they yelled and fought for hours. I didn’t want to be in that house much longer, so I gathered my things, took my rifle from the safe and made a few calls when the fighting died down. After making sure I was all clear, I went downstairs to leave, ignoring my father drinking alone in the living room, and saying goodbye to my mom. She was an idiot for sticking with that man, but she was kind to me and still my mom, so if I didn’t come back from a solo trip then she’s the one I’d want to know where I went. 



She didn’t respond, just gave me a nod and sent me on my way. I went out, hopping in my truck and driving a little way out of the town and towards what is considered the public entrance to the woods. I parked my truck, offloaded by bag and supplies. My rifle, a tent, some rations, extra ammo, bear spray, and some other survival gear. 



I took a long trek, walking into the thick brush until my ankles clicked and the shadows had lengthened. Long walks never bothered me, especially through nature, the cold breeze on my face, the petrichor smell from the freshly cleared up rain, even the occasional sight of a deer or fowl that go by the rivers. It was like a movie, how the light would shine between the trees and civilisation was lost behind the wall of towering logs and nestled green. 



The sun was getting low, in my urge for distraction, and I had left pretty close to sunset, so I decided to set up my tent now and focus on the hunt in the morning. I might even just go home after some sleep and time away, but we will see. I found a small clearing and began to set up, clearing away some shrubs and pinning my tent into the ground. Once everything was in place and the light began to dim, I’d sit down, take some bites from my rations, and relax under the night sky. 



Usually, in the woods at this time, underneath the brush, your only light would be whatever you bring, though tonight, as I looked up between the matted cover of leaves, I saw the moon shining down on me. Full and bright, like a white sun illuminating the dark, a pearl to contrast the dark ocean in the sky. I remember it vividly; it was mesmerising for some reason. Like I was being drawn in by its beautiful glow. The only thing snapping me away from my stargazing was the sudden snap of a twig in the distance, as I snapped my head to see what it was. 



A deer, a slender Doe, walking through the tree line. I wasn’t exactly being quiet, so the fact that it approached anywhere close to my camp was a little concerning. I had heard stories from Micha that sometimes the deer catch stuff around here and lose their fear of humans or start hurting themselves. Though it didn’t seem to be directly approaching, maybe it had just stumbled across me by coincidence. Regardless, it was close by, and I was given the go-ahead to hunt deer in the location. I slowly reached over for my rifle, gripping it close to myself to avoid any large sudden movements. I’d slowly raise the weapon, taking aim as best as I could, the Deer being lit up by the moonlight, gently brushing between the trees 



I had the shot lined up, taking my time to make sure I'd kill it as quickly as possible, to avoid the need to track it further.  Then, eventually, I lowered my rifle. Hesitation took over for a moment, which gave a moment to realise that it probably wasn't a good idea to do so this late with no means of preserving the body overnight. During the day, i could just cart it to my truck after tagging it, but even with how unnaturally bright the moon was that night, walking back in the dark with all that weight didn't feel like a smart choice.



The deer ran off after that, though not as if he had spotted a threat and booked it, it had seen me so it probably heard something off in the distance that I couldn’t and decided to run. Regardless, I turned around, sat back down on my fold out chair and reached into my bag for some more jerky. I had other meals but I was planning to be out here for a few days and packed in a rush. Was I pulled some out I heard a voice speak to me. A woman’s voice. “Why didn’t you shoot?” 



I jumped out of my skin for a moment, thinking I was alone, before looking up and seeing a woman sat across from me on a log. “Oh shit… sorry…you just snuck up on me” i replied my voice a shaky tone but quickly regained my composure “What’d you say?” I asked as she repeated, “why didn’t you shoot?” Her voice was like a skittish deer.



“It’s late, i could have just shot at tagged it, but I’d rather not carry it back to my car in the dark”



“It’s not that dark” she replied, which was true, but still not a condition to be walking through a dense forest while hauling a deer carcass. As we spoke I took a moment to actually take a look at her, she was dressed in a mismatch of cloths, a dusty looking hoodie with ripped jeans (that look more like they were damaged them ripped for fashion reasons), she had big hiking boots that looked a bit to big for her, and a baggy t-shirt with some sort of wolf design on them. I see tourists wearing them sometimes. 



She leaned in a little closer for a moment, sniffing the air almost like an animal before asking “got any spare?” Assuredly referring to the beef jerky I was clenching in my hand. I handed her the small bag I was holding as I noticed she was dirty, most of her body was covered so I only really noticed when she leaned in and I saw her hands. Part of me was starting to assume she was homeless, or has just gotten lost on a hunting trip. We have a lot of missing persons here but she didn’t seem concerned or worried, and we hadn’t had any recent reports. 



“Im Adrian… and you?” I asked, just trying to make conversation, even if she was homeless, she didn’t seem to be an addict. Not that there are many dealers in a place like this. 



She seemed to think a little too long, which made me think when she finally replied with “luna… my name's luna” that she was lying. I didn’t press on the subject tho. Just sat there as she ate my jerky. 



“Out here by yourself? Little dangerous, dont ya think?” 



She looked at me with a confused face before replying, “You’re alone too?”



“Yeah, but I have a gun”



“Who says I don’t have a gun?”



“Do you?” I asked before being met with a long pause and an inevitable “no” before she followed up with “Im not by myself though…”



“Out here with family” I asked cautiously. 



“No, my family is miles away. Im here with friends”



Part of me was starting to grow concerned… both at the potential idea that this girl was left alone by people she thought were her friends, or that there are other people maybe waiting to pounce on me, and this girl was a distraction. The fake name and hesitation not doing much to ease my suspicion. 



“Huh… so, where’re you from?” I asked, trying to keep the conversation rolling as I carefully glanced either side of me, trying to confirm if anyone was approaching.”I don’t really have a home” she replied. “But I guess Im technically from abroad…”



“Oh, that’s cool. My boss is a Russian dude, big softy but really scary looking”



“Large bald man with thick eyebrows?”



“Yeah, that's him. Ya know him?”



“No… I’ve just seen him come through here… I’ve seen you a couple of times as well”



I hadn’t been in the woods for a while, so she must have been here a long time. I was trying to think back if I had ever seen her before, but nothing came to mind. Silence builds as I cycle through my memories, only broken when she says.



“It’s a good thing you didn’t shoot the deer.”



“Sorry?” I replied



“There are things out here you wouldn’t want to attract at night…”



“What, like bears?”



“No… it’s not important.” 



I looked cautiously around as things went quiet again. We sat there in silence for a moment before she stood up from the log she was sitting on. “Don’t worry about that, though, just don’t go shooting that gun at night ok.” Up until this point, I thought she was quite small, but now that she stood up she towered over me and was just really skinny. 



“I’ll be sure not too…” I replied back as she wandered off into the woods, the moonlight growing darker with her absence. Only then did I notice that the faint background noise of nocturnal birds and chittering insects also seemed to follow, the forest growing eerily silent the moment she left. It was late, however, and I needed sleep. I packed up my things, put our my tiny little fire and climbed into my tent for the night. 



I awoke the next morning to some sort of burning smell, causing me to jump up and pull the zipper of my tent open, a swift sense of panic racing as I thought I may have missed some embers when putting out my fire, only to open the flap and find Luna, out by my tent, cooking some meat over the fire. 



“Morning, sleepy” 



She said, her voice a lot more chipper than the night before. I glanced around, confused, but ultimately stepped out, still unsure if her intentions, but she seemed harmless the night before. “Morning… what are you doing?”



“I thought it only fair that I repay you for the food I took.”



“I see…”



She was cooking some kind of meat, which was cut up finely and layered in a pan over the reignited fire. If i had to guess, it was from a pig, though i saw no packaging around, which I thought was a bit strange because she wasn't exactly carrying a bag or anything with her either. I brushed it off in the moment, afterall there was already a strange woman cooking me breakfast in the woods.



“Do your friends know you're over here again?” I asked as i took a seat on a nearby log. 



“Yeah… they dont mind though” she replied as she began placing the slices of meat onto skewers, which she must have been holding the whole time, as I hadn't noticed her pulling them from anywhere. She handed a couple over to me. Of course, I was hesitant but if this was some trick to try and kill me, there were better ways to have done that by now. So I eat.   
  
We didn't talk much, outside of the occasional question from either Luna or I. She asked me if i slept well, I asked her if she was also out hunting. Eventually, I asked about her family, since she had mentioned the night before that they were far away. 



“They live abroad. We dont really talk. One of my sisters will sometimes check in on me, still in some contact with my brother, but even that lines drying up these days… what about you? You live nearby, I assume”   
  
“Something like that,” I said, while I was getting comfortable with her; she was still a stranger to me. “I live with my parents still, A place on my own’s too expensive and even without that, small road towns feel like a trap to begin with.”



“Your governments do tend to make things harder, she replied. I replied in turn with a shrug and a simple yeah. She continued, asking me, “How are things with your folks?”



“Not great… My Dad's a scumbag, my Mom refuses to leave him, and i just gotta live with both of them until another option comes along.” I explained.



I was open to talking about it. News travels fast in places like my hometown, so it's not like this wasn't public information. She had a strange look of familiarity to her as I spoke, like I've seen that expression before. Many many times plastered on my own face as I stare myself down in the mirror. A sense of discomfort which I felt the need to quickly move on from. The conversations flowed on a little longer from there. 



Instead of short questions and answers, she seemed a bit more open, probably wanting to chat about anything other than family. We spoke about music mostly, bands we liked, and songs that made us cry. Artists who reminded us of better times and childhood memories. It was nice if only for an hour. 



Though it felt longer than that, but was cut off when she stood up abruptly after we finished talking about some dumb bands we knew about. Simply saying “Its about time I go.” 



I replied, asking “You gonna be here tonight?” 



“Maybe” she said back with a smile. 



“Im out here for a couple of days, if you wanna talk again later?” 



She seemed to think for a moment, glancing back over her shoulder for a moment. 



“Alright. I'd suggest moving your camp for tonight. There's a river about half a mile that way, I assume you know it?”

I did, my father and I tracked it down a few times, though never beyond the marked trails.



“I do”



“Follow it upstream until you see a huge oak tree, im set up near there.”



“What about your friends? I wouldn't want to intrude” 



She seemed to stop for a second, before sighing, “I lied… im here on my own… I know i approached you, but you are still a man with a gun.” I can't blame her for lying, I'd have done the same in her shoes. 



“Alright… I'll move everything over before it starts getting dark” 



We said our goodbyes and moved on, Luna heading back off into the woods, and I packed up my stuff, getting ready to move. Despite this being a hunting trip, I spent most of my time out there just wandering. Walking and clearing my head. I even took a few pictures. Some sunbeams coming through trees, Insects and even a raccoon I found that must have run all the way from town, because he was carrying a bag of store-brand chips. 



Sometime around 4:00 pm, I had sat down for a break, to rest my legs and have a snack. I found myself a small stone ledge by one of the foot paths and took a seat, setting down my rifle and taking out some crackers, listening to the sound of birds in the area, and just taking in the moment. In any other situation id have said I was procrastinating, but I felt I needed this today. A nice chat with a stranger, a long, long walk in the woods, it was kind of refreshing. 



My comforting break was cut short by the sudden crackling of my walkie, a heavy mess of a Russian American Accent coming in. It was Micha. “Hello, you still kicking bone bag”, he said, tagging on the harsh nickname but affectionate in his own way. 



“Yeah, im here.” I replied, “Things ok at the shop?” 



“Yeah, everything's good. Your mother came in and asked me to check on you. Didn't stick around.”



“If you see her again, tell her im fine. I'll be back soon”



“She was crying again… your dad?” he asked with a tone of concern. It took a second for me to respond.



“Yeah”



“Id just gut the man at this point” he said in what in a stern tone, though i assume for his own sake that he was joking. Not that id mind if he wasn't at this point.

Micha never liked my father. His family moved here when Micha was young. Being such a small town, pre-internet, with years of American idealism hammered into their brains through TV and Movies, his russian heritage was a source of some ridicule. My father was one of the people who encouraged the bullying, calling him a spy, a commie and many other uncreative insults which sound ridiculous to an adult but hurt as a child. 



As they both moved into adulthood, Micha kept to himself, though he was always polite in his own twisted way, unlike my father whos business was everyone's business and is the reason why my school teachers would just give up with emergency contacts after they couldn't reach my mom. 



Despite my quick acceptance of his comment, I would rather just see the man leave than die.



“Nah, he won't learn anything if he dies.”



“He hasn't learned anything being alive, but you are probably right.”



I could hear him shuffling around the shop, the occasional loud thud coming from the radio as he left it on, cutting up carcasses and preparing them for the storefront. Though a thought crossed my mind. 



“Hey have you spoken to Mr Whitmen recently?”



Mr Whitmen, or Mayor Whitmen as i should be calling him was the legal owner of the land surrounding the town for a good ways out, though I never learned the exact range of his land, but he owns enough for me to have hiked and hunted continuously for 2/3rds of my 23 years on this earth, and ive still not see all of it. He's also the one you go to to hunt in the area.



“Uhm, not recently, need something?” Micha replied



“No, just saw some girl out here. She was a little weird”



“Like what… kill you with an axe, weird or really into cartoons weird” 



“Like, in the woods at night alone kind of weird, i was wondering if anyone else is out here?”



“Hmmm, she might be search and rescue? For that boy who went missing a few days back”



“They still haven't found him?”



“Nah, the family is still holding on though, i saw them in town again today.”



“Thats rough, if i see him ill radio you, but i dont think she was search and rescue, didnt have any gear with her, was wearing normal clothes.”

Micha stopped and paused for a moment; the lack of shuffling noises led me to assume he was thinking to himself. Though as the radio went silent, I noticed something odd.



I remember in school the girls would often dare the boys to walk into the woods, it was meant to be some challenge, a test of bravery, which as a kid I thought was a terrifying experience, not knowing what was out there, but now im older the unknown of the wilderness is part of the charm, the mystery adds to the setting. Some people would argue that it's scary because of animals and things that may attack you, but honestly ive had more of a fright finding other people in the woods than I have animals. Ive encountered bears before, but they usually keep their distance if you leave them alone. 



I mention this to put into perspective how strange it was that, as I was sitting there, back against a tree, trodden foot path on either side with decent visibility, I suddenly felt uneasy. Not because i was scared, but because the forest that I usually find peaceful felt wrong. Like the wilderness itself was trying to hide from something else, the deafening silence hit my ears suddenly, the birds i was listening to before picking up the radio had gone silent. Not gone, silent. No sound of a flock flying away, or trees rustling, even the wind felt as if it grew still. It was unnatural for the area. 



Micha’s voice nearly shot me out of my skin as it broke the almost dead silence.



“Might have snuck out there for a late-night hike? I dont know, I've got a few customers. I'll talk to Whitman see if he knows anything. Talk to you later.” 



I responded, keeping my voice down as I looked around, “Yeah, bye”



I put the radio receiver back in my bag and turned the power off for now, wanting to conserve the battery. Also, just in case it chimes back in again, I didn't want it to make noise. As I surveyed the area between the tree line, there was nothing, not a bug or bird in sight. Not even ants walking across the dirt. On its own, this wouldn't be an alarming sight, but accompanied by that hollow silence.



Finally, the silence was broken, a twig snapping to my right, a Deer. the same one from the night before, maybe it was the patterns, or the way it just looked at me without any fear, but I just knew it was the same one. It stood there, staring at me once more. This would be the perfect moment, but the silence felt too oppressive. Regardless, I took my rifle, lined it up, and even though I could feel nature itself telling me not to make a sound, I went against my better judgment and fired. 



Was probably the best shot I had made in my life. The deer went down like a sack of bricks, no chase or fuss. The moment my gun fired, all noise came back in a rush that the small explosion in my rifle's chamber felt like mouse feet compared to the sudden cracking of wind against my ears, birds flying, and small woodland creatures scurrying away.

I was just about to go over and tag it, before the sound of the last moving thing hit my ears. In rapid succession, multiple heavy footprints came from behind the tree I was sitting by. It didn't sound like a person. If it were a person, it would be more than one, and they would be carrying a lot of gear. Each step sounded like an elephant stomping with its full weight on the ground. 



I pressed my back against the tree trunk and pulled my rifle towards me. I could hear the heavy steps come to a stop, long weezey breaths blowing against the other side of the trunk, followed by the sudden creaking of whatever this thing was pressing against it, the weight of this thing shifting up the tree, crawling higher and higher. The creaking came from 10, maybe 15ft above my head. 



My first throught it that it was a bear, since I know grizzlies can climb trees, but its breathing sounded wrong, like a person, or a sick old dog. Any thoughts of it being anything you'd expect from the woods were shot down as I glanced out of the corner of my eye, seeing a pair of mangled hands grip around the side of the tree, with another pair directly above. The same on the other side. They edged closer to me as I pulled myself tight, making myself narrow against the enormous tree behind me.



It seemed to feel around, trying to find something or someone to grip onto and snatch away into the woods. Not wanting to get caught in its grasp, I carefully slid my feet under me and readied myself to run. Being ready to leave the deer to rot to save myself. 



I took a deep breath, and as i did, a rustling off in the distance seemed to catch the thing's attention, as I heard its heavy feet drop to one side. Using the moment of distraction, I ran for it, heading towards the river as Luna had said. The moment I went off on my sprint i could feel eyes on me and hear the repeated drumming, almost like a gallop from this thing chasing me. I didn't look back, i didnt have the time. This thing felt a lot faster than me, no, it was faster than me. I heard it catching up in seconds. It was right behind me now, i could see the shadow of this looming figure towering over me, shining down to my side. I shot to my side, darting off the beaten path and between two narrow trees to get some distance, hearing the sound of running water close by. 



I charged on, the sound of branches cracking and this heavy thing moving around following behind. I closed my eyes and kept running, running, and running, until finally my foot hit cold water, the river's water soaking up my pant leg, but I pushed on, running on until my breath was ragged and my cries of exhaustion hoarse, though as my foot hit the gravel on the other side… i realised the thudding had stopped. I turned around and saw it in the distance, or parts of it at least, bulbous muscles on parts of the back and too many limbs shuffling as it dragged itself away.   
  
I collapsed for a moment, taking a second to breathe and let my heart calm down, instead of trying to tear its way through my ribcage. Honestly, I would have preferred it had been a bear. 



Once I had almost gathered myself, I made my way upstream as Luna had said. Not wanting to stick around in case whatever that was came back. After walking for almost 30 minutes, the sun was getting low, and my legs felt like bags of paste. I came across a large oak tree, with a massive crack along one side and a light shining from within. This tree looked old, by which i mean its trunk was wide, probably about 8ft wide and taller than most of the others, with the leaves and branches being so thick and dense it created a perfect amount of shade in under its canopy. Stood outside, knife in hand, sharpening a stick into a crude spear was Luna. 



She was sitting on a fold-out chair by a fire, surrounding her were a series of lights, a mixture of lanterns, flashlights, and even a few sets of Christmas lights were hung and spread across the various rocks, shorter trees and shrubs. Tied between two trees was a hammock, with various knick-knacks and personal items scattered around in backpacks and duffel bags. Each one is vastly different from the next. 



I couldn't help but ask on my Arrival “Do you live here?” which caught her attention. 



“Yeah”, she said, acknowledging me with a nod, but not looking up from her spear. Though she did briefly point to another chair that was folded up and leaning against the giant tree. Even though my legs felt like they were about to fall off and all i wanted to do was rest, i had too many other questions. 



“What was that thing? That big monster that chased me through the woods?”



“Nothing you need to worry about” she replied, simply putting the spear down and moving on to sharpening another one. 



“I think it IS something for me to worry about, it chased me down” 



“You are lucky it was just one, usually those things hunt in groups. Though coming out while the sun is up is new”



“What are they” I asked again, a bit of annoyance in my voice. 



“Like you said, a monster. Theyve been in these woods for a while now”



“And how do you know so much about them?” i snapped back.



“Because ive also been in these woods a while” she replied, seeming to get annoyed back at me. 



I took a deep breath and a step back. Pulling out my own chair and folding it out. Honestly should have dumped it while i was being chased but you dont really think of those things in the moment. Kind of happy i didnt now as the weight off my knees and ankles was a godsend when i finally sat down, placing my bags beside me. 

Luna also seemed to take a moment before speaking up in an attempt to calm me “They usually dont go for people unless they are shooting at night, you probably were just unlucky to encounter one in the day,” shed then placed her stick and knife down, turning her full attention to me “You can camp out here with me tonight, ill take you back to the Trail entrance in the morning.”



It wasn't ideal, but if she was telling the truth, it was better than going back in the dark. “Alright… why didn't it cross the river by the way, i got past it, and it just stopped”



“Its a territorial thing i think? They only like hunting on their land,” she said in a way that made me assume she wasn't even sure herself. “I am sure that they won't cross the river.”



She leaned over to pick her spears up again, along with her knife and stood up from her chair, “i do have some rules while you are here, dont leave the camp until sunrise, dont go into the tree, also if you hear another voice other than mine. Close your eyes.”



“Why close my eyes? Who else comes here?”



“That's private… not leaving camp is just for your safety, and not going in the tree is because it's all rotted out in there, so it's not safe either. Listen to me when i say that third rule though, keep your eyes closed if you hear anyone else, ok” 



“Alright…”



“Any more questions?” she asked with a slight tilt of her head.



“Where did you get all this stuff?” i asked, since it was in the back of my mind when I got here, but was buried by all my other questions. 



“In truth. Its stolen.”



“Youve been robbing people?”



“Not violently, just taking stuff from campsites while they were unoccupied. It's not like I've got money”



I just shrugged off that line of questioning, figuring it wasn't going to go anywhere else. “Alright, just dont steal any of my stuff, ok?”



“I only steal from people who leave a mess. You were pretty clean, so you get a pass” Shed remark before walking towards the river “Cook your food if you like, I'll get myself some fish” 



The night continued on from there, with a few hours of awkward silences and the occasional question that barely got a clear answer. Though the moment i started talking about other things, she opened up more. I ended up spending the rest of the night before we both went to sleep, talking about weird animals we knew about and our weird uncles. How mine was some failed musician, which I always thought was a shame since I quite liked Uncle John's music, Luna told me about her uncles, one was just as bad as her dad, but she got along with him a little better atleast due to his being really into horses, it was the only thing they ever talked about together. Her other uncle, she said, she never actually sees outside of the occasional family gathering. 



Apparently hes in a healthy relationship and has a stable job, but keeps away from the family due to their constant drama, stressing him out, something i can relate to since my dad and uncle having a falling out is what pushed him out of town to pursue music anyway. 



Despite enjoying the conversation, my mind was a mess of conflicted feelings. She was relatable, had a lot of niche interests i liked, and she was easy to talk to once the ball got rolling, but all of that was being shadowed out by everything else. She was nice, but she was a weird girl living alone in a forest full of monsters, stealing from people and living off the land. The fact that no ones found her yet is a miracle in of itself. 



The night finally came to a close, though, Luna going to bed before me, apparently to ease my nerves. I waited until i was sure she was asleep, and then gave it an extra 10 minutes for good measure. Before finally taking out my sleeping bag and culling up next to the tree. Finding a nook between roots for me to sleep in. 



The following day went as planned. The sun rose, I packed up my things, and Luna took me to my truck. Which somehow had the deer i had shot tagged and already placed in the back. At this point, i didnt want to question it. I just wanted to get in my car and leave. Though as i walked out, luna didnt follow me. She stood at the gate separating the forest from the paved parking lot.



“Thanks for not killing me i guess… and also helping me”



“You suck at thank you’s… but you are welcome” 



I waved her off, got in my truck, and drove back. 



I can't get it out of my head, though. Not just Luna but that thing. She did say there were more of them out there. I can't help but think about how many people they have killed; maybe that's where all the missing people went. Also, the fact that my only escape from reality had been ruined by something like this. Regardless, i felt the urge to return. 



I hear Micha is planning another trip soon… i may need to warn him before he goes out.
