  
Just a few months ago, I had almost given up hope of finding work as a UI designer. Despite sending out countless resumes and completing a few test assignments, all I received were polite rejections. With an outstanding student loan, it was far from an ideal situation.  
  
In my search for a part-time job, I stumbled upon a delivery service opportunity. I found myself pedaling around town on my bike, delivering various packages. Overall, I enjoyed the job, despite the occasional unpleasant incident. However, today's encounter changed everything.  
  
Having lived in this town since high school, I was always drawn to exploration. As a curious child, I would often climb abandoned houses, unfinished buildings, and vacant lots - places few people knew about. So, imagine my surprise when I arrived at the delivery address with a backpack full of spicy Thai noodles, only to find myself standing in front of a house I knew all too well.  
  
This particular house held a special place in my memories. Back when I was little, my friends and I used to gather near it and share spooky stories. Even then, fifteen years ago, the house was already abandoned and falling apart. Its decaying appearance, worn-out boards, and eerie atmosphere made it the epitome of a haunted house. The windows were all dusty and covered in cobwebs and the garden surrounding the house was totally overgrown, like it was trying to swallow the whole place.  
  
However, as I stood there today, the house didn't seem as terrifying as it did in my childhood. It had simply become old and neglected, a relic from the past.  
  
Reflecting upon my past experiences, I realized that my imagination as a child had exaggerated the house's creepiness. In reality, it was just another aging structure.  
  
I couldn't help but suspect that it was some sort of prank. The idea of entering a haunted house for delivery seemed more like a twisted joke than a genuine order. However, since the payment hadn't been made, I resolved to stick to the rules of my job and fulfill the delivery.  
  
I approached the rusty wicket. Surprisingly, it was invitingly open, creaking softly in the breeze. So I made my way across the obscenely overgrown path toward the door.  
  
I raised my hand and knocked on the weathered door, though deep down, I doubted anyone would answer. To my astonishment, a voice echoed from within.  
  
"Come in!"  
  
As a delivery person, I wasn't accustomed to entering customers' homes. Usually, I would leave the order at the door or hand it directly to the customer. The prospect of entering that house didn't sit well with me. However, against my better judgment, I decided to step inside. That was my first mistake. But first things first.  
  
As I stepped inside, the wooden floorboards creaked under my weight. The air was filled with a musty odor, a combination of decay and age that permeated every corner.  
  
The woman's voice called out to me again, her words echoing through the stillness of the house. Then she muttered something to herself, but her words were unintelligible. I moved toward the source of the voice, my hand instinctively reaching into my backpack to retrieve the bag of food.  
  
I reached a doorway that led me to a dining room, and I must say, it looked pretty unsettling. The room was bathed in the soft glow of natural light streaming through the tall, dusty windows. The abandoned atmosphere was palpable, with layers of dust covering the long, wooden table and the surrounding furniture.  
  
At the head of the table, seated in a high-backed chair, was an old woman. Her wispy gray hair hung limply around her face. The lines etched across her features told stories of a life well-lived, but her presence in this forgotten space seemed out of place.  
  
"There you are, sweetheart. I'm sorry you had to come all the way over here. It's very hard for me to get to the door."  
  
Her gentle tone seemed at odds with the desolation of the room.  
  
"It's okay, it's not hard for me. Here's your order."  
  
I placed the bag of food in front of her, feeling a mix of awkwardness and unease settle within me.  
  
"Thank you, thank you," she expressed her gratitude with heartfelt sincerity. I paused, expecting her to reach for her wallet and provide payment. However, she looked up at me with a smile, seemingly unaware of what I was waiting for.  
  
"I'm sorry, but your order hasn't been paid for yet," I explained, trying to hide my growing discomfort.  
  
A sudden realization crossed her face, and she exclaimed, "Oh! Oh, I'm sorry. Mother of God. I left the money on top of that cupboard. Can you please get it?"  
  
She lifted a trembling finger, pointing towards an old wooden cupboard in the corner of the room. Glancing over, I spotted the money she mentioned—a fifty-dollar bill.  
  
"Okay, let me give you the change," I responded, ready to retrieve the exact payment.   
  
However, the old woman insisted, "No, please keep the change. Thank you for your help."  
  
That's when I got really uncomfortable. The price of the order didn't add up to $20, and accepting such a substantial tip felt disproportionate. Seeing the woman's frailty and the dilapidated state of the house, I couldn't help but feel a pang of guilt at taking advantage of her generosity.  
  
"I really appreciate your kindness, but it's not necessary. You should keep the change," I replied sincerely, hoping to convey my genuine concern.  
  
However, her insistence remained unwavering, leaving me torn between accepting the money and following my moral compass. Given my financial difficulties, even $30 didn't seem out of place. But as I looked at the frail and evidently struggling old woman, I couldn't bring myself to accept such a large sum from her.  
  
"I'm sorry, but this is a little awkward for me. It's too much, really."  
  
"But I don't..." she began to protest, her voice tinged with disappointment.  
  
The old woman's upset expression struck a chord within me. I didn't want to hurt her feelings or make her think that her generosity was unappreciated.  
  
"Look," she continued, her tone imploring, "why don't you help me out a little bit more? Then you can take the money as payment for your help."  
  
It seemed like a reasonable compromise. But deep down, a nagging feeling warned me that agreeing to her proposition might have unforeseen consequences.  
  
And yet, against my better judgment, I said yes. It was my second mistake.  
  
For the next ten minutes, I helped Mrs. Flores (as I learned her name to be) with small tasks around the house. I closed the draughty window to keep the chill out, and I fetched a tea set from the dusty kitchen, brewing a comforting cup of tea for both of us. Despite their simplicity, these gestures seemed to make a genuine difference to Mrs. Flores, and she thanked me profusely for each one.  
  
As I observed her struggling with her movements, I mustered the courage to ask a sensitive question.   
  
"Forgive me for being forward, but do you have someone to take care of you? This house doesn't seem like the safest or most comfortable place to live."  
  
Mrs. Flores looked at me with a mixture of sadness and acceptance. "I don't have anyone, honey. I've been alone for a long time. But this house holds a special meaning for me. I just can't bring myself to leave."  
  
Curiosity piqued, I probed further, asking, "How long have you lived here?"  
  
"It's been a long time," she replied, her voice filled with a hint of nostalgia. "I can't even say for sure how many years it's been."  
  
Mrs. Flores, curious about my life, asked a few questions. Although it was challenging to explain my job as a UI designer to her, I did my best to share my situation.  
  
It became apparent that she didn't even know what kind of food she had ordered.  
  
It turned out that she didn't even know what kind of food she had ordered.  
  
"Honestly, I haven't quite figured out this whole phone delivery thing yet. I just ordered whatever came up. Is it good?"  
  
"I think it's pretty spicy. Do you like spicy food?" I responded, trying to gauge her preferences.  
  
"Oh, I enjoy spicy food, but my stomach doesn't always agree. I'll have to be more careful next time," she replied, a touch of disappointment in her voice.  
  
Seeing her upset, I decided to offer my help once again. After some hesitation, she finally agreed to let me go somewhere else and get her something else.  
  
"You know, honey, in my day, it was customary to respect and help the elderly. Young people don't do that as much nowadays. But your kindness reminded me that there are still good people out there."  
  
Mrs. Flores then asked me to find more money in her drawer. As I opened it, I was surprised to find a collection of valuable items—gold rings, bracelets, brooches, and more. She allowed me to go through her valuables. At that moment, I couldn't help but think about how terrible it would be if someone unscrupulous took advantage of her.  
  
The realization of Mrs. Flores' vulnerability and my responsibility to protect her deepened.  
  
By the end of our conversation, I had developed a fondness for Mrs. Flores, and she gave me an additional tip. We agreed that I would visit her from time to time to offer assistance.  
  
The next day, I intended to stop by her house while delivering another order in the same area. However, I woke up feeling terrible, and my condition worsened throughout the day. Severe nosebleeds plagued me in the morning, which I struggled to control. I felt weak and experienced intermittent darkness in my vision, making it impossible for me to visit my newfound friend's house. Exhausted, I fell asleep as soon as I returned home.  
  
The following day wasn't much better, but I decided to spare half an hour and visit Mrs. Flores. At that moment, a thought crossed my mind—had she already been living in that house fifteen years ago when I used to hang out with my friends? Despite the house's dilapidated appearance even back then, she claimed to have called it home for many years.  
  
I decided to search for information about the house online. To my surprise, I discovered that it was listed as one of the "cursed" places that thrill-seekers dared to visit. This left me feeling outraged. How could anyone trespass into a house where a vulnerable elderly lady resided?  
  
I thought of leaving a comment on the house's description on Google Maps, clarifying that it was actually inhabited. But the comments I read there sent a shiver down my spine.  
  
"Pretty cool spot. It's where a guy killed his family. Gets super eerie at night."  
  
"Perfect for a spooky date. A legit haunted house."  
  
"My friend went there and came back gray. Seriously."  
  
I then decided to Google the house's address along with the last name "Flores." What I discovered was news from forty years ago revealing a horrifying history associated with the Flores family.  
  
According to reports, a young woman and child had been brutally murdered, dismembered, and buried in the yard of the house. The father was found guilty, and later declared insane, but never admitted his guilt until he died in a mental health facility. Although it was a well-known tale within small circles, the story had remained confined to old archived newspapers. However, someone using the nickname HistoRee had scanned those ancient clippings and shared them on their blog. Since then, the popularity of the house among thrill-seekers and even tourists had skyrocketed.  
  
The unsettling discovery left me feeling extremely uneasy, worsening my already poor physical condition. I struggled to hold back the urge to vomit. Although I typically wasn't easily influenced by stories, the fact that Mrs. Flores, who still resided in the house, could be connected to the tragic events from forty years ago was truly terrifying.  
  
Could she have been a sister or some other relative of the perpetrator? I hesitated, trying to piece together the puzzle. Mrs. Flores, that must be her husband's surname. I tried to find any information about the killer, but my search turned up empty. There were no mentions of siblings or other relatives. The only available source was that blog post, filled with unsettling comments from sensationalists and fearmongers.  
  
After processing all the information, I took some time to rest and recover from my physical discomfort. Once I felt ready, I prepared myself and headed over to visit Mrs. Flores. On the way, I made up my mind not to inquire about past events. It wasn't worth stirring up painful memories out of mere curiosity.  
  
Arriving at Mrs. Flores' house with treats and fresh fruit, I found the gate and door open once again. I located her in the dimly lit living room. First, I sliced apples and pears for her, and then I brought a blanket to warm her feet. Mrs. Flores was as friendly and somewhat naive as before. Despite her impaired vision and oversized glasses, she noticed my unwell appearance.  
  
"You look pale, dear. Are you feeling unwell? I fear this house might be causing problems—there's so much dust and mold... Maybe you shouldn't come here."  
  
"I think it's just a minor illness. It's my pleasure to help you."  
  
However, deep down, I pondered. What if the house was genuinely toxic? Was my volunteering effort worth jeopardizing my well-being? Perhaps I had made a mistake by coming here. But I didn't want to share my concerns with Mrs. Flores, as it might insult her living conditions.  
  
"How are things going with your work? Have you found someone who appreciates your art?" she asked.  
  
"It's not exactly art, haha. But no, not yet. Honestly, there's very little demand for my work at the moment. I hardly even bother responding to job listings anymore because it rarely leads anywhere."  
  
"Oh, dear. That's so disheartening. I wish I could help you. It's not pleasant to wander around town all day with deliveries. You might encounter some unsavory people who wish to harm you."  
  
I thought she was about to offer me money again.  
  
"It's alright, Mrs. Flores. I've been working here for two months now, and I try to be cautious."  
  
"Then let me at least show my gratitude for your assistance," she said as she unwrapped her shawl and unfastened a small gold brooch from it. "Please accept this. It once belonged to a girl who resembled you, and it held great significance to me."  
  
"It's too much. I can't accept this," I protested.  
  
"Honey," her tone became more serious, "my time is limited. I would prefer this item to be cherished by someone, rather than lying here in the dust once I'm gone."  
  
After a little more persuasion, I reluctantly accepted the gift, though my cheeks burned with shame. Here I was, accepting money and presents from an elderly lady, after four years of college education.  
  
I fastened the brooch onto the inside of my jacket, contemplating whether or not to sell it at a pawn shop.  
  
Afterward, I resumed my order deliveries. Despite my concerns about the mold in the house, my physical condition quickly improved. Nausea and bleeding ceased, and by evening, I felt completely fine.  
  
The following day, I had a job interview in my field of expertise, and I spent the entire day preparing for it. The day after that, I was occupied with delivering orders, keeping me busy and distracted. Two more days passed, and I didn't really think much about Mrs. Flores or her house. That is until today.  
  
A glimmer caught my eye, reminding me of the brooch Mrs. Flores had given me. I decided to pay her a visit, proudly displaying the brooch pinned to the outside of my jacket. However, as I approached the house and passed through the gate, a sense of unease washed over me.  
  
There was a man in his forties, wearing a leather jacket, working in the garden with a shovel. I hadn't noticed him at first, as he was obscured by the dense foliage. Suddenly, he shouted something incomprehensible and started walking toward me, shovel in hand. Fear gripped me as I realized there was no one nearby to help.  
  
"So, it's you, huh? Did you mess with the old woman's mind? Did you say something to her?"  
  
"I don't understand what you mean. I brought Mrs. Flores some food..."  
  
I tried to defend myself, though I hadn't done anything wrong.  
  
"Damn scammers, infiltrating everywhere! And that brooch! Do you even know its value? Did you steal it?"  
  
"Mrs. Flores gave it to me herself!"  
  
"Don't play dumb with me! Give it back!"  
  
He forcefully snatched the brooch, causing it to tear along with a piece of fabric from his jacket. I quickly started backing away toward the gate, hoping he wouldn't strike me with the shovel at any moment.  
  
"Stay away from here, or else!"  
  
"Sweetheart?"  
  
Mrs. Flores appeared in the doorway, barely able to stand on her own. Although I knew she wouldn't offer any real protection, her presence made me feel slightly safer.  
  
"Leave her alone, Danny. Give her back the brooch."  
  
"Like hell I will."  
  
"Forgive him, this is Danny, my nephew. He's not the most polite."  
  
"You said you didn't have anyone..." I interjected, surprised.  
  
"I said I didn't have anyone to take care of me. But I do have someone who comes here to intimidate my guests all the time, don't I?"  
  
Danny angrily spat on the ground.  
  
"I think I should just leave."  
  
I gently placed the bag of food I had brought for Mrs. Flores on the ground and hastily walked away. The last thing I wanted was to get caught up in their family problems. Dealing with the torn jacket incident was already enough for me.  
  
I made up my mind not to visit Mrs. Flores again. The whole situation felt murky and complicated. It was puzzling how she claimed to have no one, yet her aggressive nephew was working in her garden. Combined with the dark history of the house, I simply didn't want to involve myself any further.  
  
With that decision in mind, I tried to calm myself down. But as soon as I got home and changed my clothes, everything went black, and I passed out.  
  
When I eventually regained consciousness hours later, I discovered a bruise on my face, blood under my nose, and a deep sense of unease. It made me wonder, against my better judgment, if there was something mystical or supernatural happening. I have to admit, I was genuinely scared. My strength was fading, and the fear of blacking out again grew stronger.

Tomorrow, I plan to see my family doctor and ask for some tests. Working in this condition is just not possible. Even writing this post has drained most of my energy and taken a considerable amount of time.  
  
I would greatly appreciate any advice or suggestions you might have. What do you think I should do in this situation? Is there something wrong with these people, and should I maintain any contact with them? I really don't want to consider curses or anything supernatural, but if, by any chance, someone has experienced something similar... I would be grateful for any guidance you can provide.
