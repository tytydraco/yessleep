Okay, so everything just went from bad to worse.  I've been camped out at this lake in Colorado.  It was, emphasis on was, really nice.  Last night, however, was a nightmare. The man who tried to kill me has found me. Even though I'm thousands of miles away from that place, he has somehow gotten to me.  I think he picked me up after I left the first rest stop after our final encounter and has been stalking me since.

Yesterday began like any other day at the lake.  I woke up, fed Cicero, walked Cicero, came back to eat, did some light reading, and fished a little.  However, toward the afternoon, I wanted to go for a walk. I tied Cicero to the car and left him food and water. I didn't stray far as I was parked next to a trail. On my walk, I saw a backpack lying on the trail, I glanced at it and saw Micheal T***** written on a tag.  My heart sank, but my wishful thinking led me to believe that maybe it was someone else that conveniently had the same name as me.

I started going back, I was 10 minutes away from the car, but not even 1 minute into walking back, I heard Cicero barking very aggressively. I ran as fast as I could. I was almost there when I heard Cicero start to whine. “Don't you touch my fucking Dog, asshole!” I shouted down the path. I got to the car to see it ransacked, Cicero limping around, and a message written on the car ‘It was nothing personal’ and on the other side ‘now it is.’

Naturally I was flipping shit, I had to leave.  I searched the car and found a note that said ‘I'm always going to find you.’ I packed the car and left immediately, went to a car wash to scrub the markings of my car and went to a police station. They told me since I didn't have a residence they couldn't help me much.  I put some distance between me and the lake and come nightfall I had to find somewhere to sleep.

Eventually I pulled into a Wal-Mart and asked the manager if I was good to sleep overnight in the parking lot.  He said I was okay if I parked toward the end of the lot and left early. Good enough for me. That night's sleep was impossible.  I was in the driver's seat, with the seat up in case I needed to make a getaway.  I closed my eyes for a few seconds and must've passed out.

I awoke to the sound of rocks hitting my windshield and saw the man standing in front of the car. He was wearing the same mask but when he removed it he was different.  In fact, it was someone else entirely.  I started the car and noticed my tire light was on.  I looked out the window and noticed my tires had been stabbed.

The man walked to my window and motioned for me to roll it down, I did so and he leaned in. His eyes a piercing blue, and his breath hot with a fishy smell. He had piercings on his nose and ears, and tattoos on his neck with a shaved head. 

“I bet you're afraid right now”

All I could do was stare at him.  Cicero started barking and he smiled at my dog.

“You got my brother locked up.”

“Y-y-yeah?”

“Yes you did, and now I have to kill you for him.”

I gulped.

“But…I won't do it tonight, or tomorrow.  I'll get you when you least expect it.”

He took his head out of the car

“But don't worry I'll make it really slow.”

He pulled a billfold out and handed me $300

“Here is for the tires, you're gonna need ‘em…nighty-night, Micheal.”

‘I am so fucked’  I thought to myself.  It is very early and very dark as I'm writing this. One of you asked me if I were going to get a shotgun…that seems my only option now.  I'm going to try and sleep, wish me luck guys.
