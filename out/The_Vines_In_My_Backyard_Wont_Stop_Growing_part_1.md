Things were never easy for me. They were also never hard. If you were to pass me on the street, you would not remember me. That's okay. I get it. There isn't anything memorable about me. I'm 5'8 and white, with an average look about me. I got through my state school studies with little effort and less praise. B’s get degrees. B’s also get you a boring job, a mid-level job as a credit analyst, just outside of Atlanta. The only remarkable part of this story is the house. I had begun to lose hope of finding any suitable living arrangements within my price range. And then out of the blue, I found it a classic country house with a large backyard leading into the forest behind. I bought it sight unseen. Then I made my arrangements and headed out.

The house was magical; it felt as if it were from a different era. The porch was a magnificent white with red trim. The house had an old-money feel as you entered and saw the staircase leading upstairs with the dark emerald green walls. I expected the place to be a mess, but it was not; it was well kept with next to no dust on the walls or shelves. I began to unpack the U-Haul alone, and it quickly became obvious that I did not have enough personality to fill this manor. With ease, I set up my new life inside the house. The empty room was a reminder of the things I had missing in my life. To relax, I made myself some sweet tea. I decided to try to fit in with the locals and headed to my back porch. The backyard was expansive with grass and weeds growing together. It had a pull to it that I felt magnetized to spend as much time as I could out there. The forest behind it was dark, and the floor was covered with a tangle of some sort of vine. I later learned it was called kudzu. I began to think about the possibility that I have a life worth remarking on here. In a way, I did.

My neighbors lived relatively far away but close enough to see the lights from their back porch. A kind man named Creed dropped by when he saw the truck.

“Heya there. I’m Creed, I'm lvivn down the street from ya,” he said in his charming drawl

“Oh, hello. How are you doing today?” I said back to him, noticing the dog at his side.

“I'm aight,” he responded,” I jus figured I'd come by and introduce us to ya. This here is my dog Jasper. He might be a little noisy at night, so if he keeps ya up, don’ be scared to give me a holler.” The white and black patched dog wagging his tail patiently

“Oh, that shouldn't be a problem, I'm a very heavy sleeper, but if it does, I will,” I said with a fake light chuckle. Small talk was never one of my strengths.

“Well, good. I guess I'll let ya get back to yer business. But if you need anything, just let me know. It's just me and Jasper at the house, so we'd be happy to help,” he said, beginning to walk back down the driveway towards his house

“There is one thing,” I said, and Creed turned back around.” I noticed some sort of vines taking over the forest behind my house. What is that?

“Oh, that'd be the kudzu. A tough bugger of a plant. It came over from Asia, and the government wanted it to help combat corrosion somethin like that. Of course they didn't realize how fast it grew. It's said to grow about a foot a day and just suffocate everything underneath it once it gets a hold of ya, no light can pass through. Sometimes at night, I swear you can hear it grow. Or I'm just going senile, maybe both could be true. Ha,” he said with a sparkle in his eye. “If it starts to be a problem, jus’ buy some goats and they'll tear right through it in no time. They love eatin that stuff.”

“Huh, good to know. Thanks, Creed, I'd better get back to unpacking,” I said with a wave

He waved back and said, “Aight, ya’ take care now.”

I liked Creed. He'd been one of the only people to go out of his way for me my whole life.

I had about a week before I started at work, and I spent that time settling in and getting the house situated. The house seemed in pristine condition, as if the people before me had left minutes before I arrived. Creed said that the house was empty for quite some time, and the people who lived there before me didn't last more than a week before they packed up and left. He never knew why they left so suddenly.

On the Monday of my first week of work, I found myself becoming quite excited. I hoped that maybe the southern hospitality I felt from Creed would carry over to my coworkers. My commute to work was about 25 minutes without traffic, 32 minutes with. Traffic never bothered me. Why would I be upset about something outside of my control? All I had to do was turn up my music and enjoy the ride. Work was fine. The people were cold, though. Every ounce of effort I put into a relationship with them became a futile effort. I found that if I wasn't a fan of the local college, then I had nothing to talk about with them.

“What do you mean you don't like the dawgs?” Andrew would ask me,”  If you're gonna live here, you gotta be a dawgs fan, or you might as well get the hell out of here.”

Sarah, the woman in the office who caught my eye, agreed with Andrew,” Come on, you gotta just force being a Bulldogs fan.”

“I just don't like sports, guys, sorry,” I said with a sad defiance.

I decided to dive into my work and easily fell into a rhythm, reading reports and judging companies on their ratios. I tried other options of befriending them to no avail. They were friendly, but not my friends. I never really had any friends. I was always the fourth option in a world that usually accommodated three. There isn't really anything special about me.

My nights were spent making spaghetti or any other Italian dish, and eating in front of the TV.   I would head to bed early and fall asleep fast, with the sounds of Jasper barking as my lullaby.

For about a month, I did this, and it was the farthest from unhappy I had ever been. Creed would stop by, bringing me all sorts of southern treats. They ranged from a pitcher of sweet tea to pecan pie. I got the feeling that he was just as lonely as me.

“You gotta be familiar with the tastes of where you live now, or you'll stick out like a sore thumb,” he would say.

I never stuck out; I always blended in.

Then one night, I finally found the secret to truly being happy. I was asleep as I normally would when I dreamt of my backyard,  standing in the back door looking out into the night.  The kudzu that infested the forest behind my home began to crawl and slither closer to my house. Just as quickly as it started, it stopped. At the edge of the vines, I saw a figure. An incomprehensible shadow pressing against my consciousness, pointing at what my mind decides was an arm to the middle of the backyard. The sweet smell of damp dirt mixed with an unfamiliar floral scent filled my nostrils.

“Dig,” it whispered deep inside my skull. It was a soothing voice that scratched the deepest part of my thoughts. A mix of a perfect feminine voice and a soothing male patriarch voice.

I found myself in the backyard and, before I could think, I was kneeling before it, digging. My hands tore through the soft, wet earth with ease, and a pleasure ran through my synapses as I dug. With a jolt, I woke up to my alarm. I looked out my window to see the undisturbed earth, and the kudzu had returned to its resting place in the forest. It had only been a dream, or so I thought as I realized my hands were sore with the pain of exhaustion. What had really happened to me that night?
