PART 1: [https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1enjez1/i\_think\_my\_student\_accommodation\_is\_haunted\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1enjez1/i_think_my_student_accommodation_is_haunted_i/)

I can feel my inner sceptic dragging me away from the computer as we speak, but I need to know. For the past two weeks, I’ve suspected that my student flat may be haunted. Before any of you flood the comments saying, “Just leave”, it’s not as simple as you think. I have a contract with my building where I’ll have to pay rent for the following 51 weeks. Like most students, I’m not loaded by any means, and I can’t just move out when I can barely even afford the accommodation, I’m currently in. The only chance of me leaving is if my life is in serious danger, and as of late I’m starting to genuinely believe it well and truly could be. Before I do anything I need confirmation. I need your help.

 

I want to thank everyone who commented on my previous post and I’m sorry I didn’t reply to them sooner. I’ve had to keep my phone on silent as of late since I keep getting prank calls, and I’ve ended up missing a lot of my notifications. I’ve blocked the number a few times, but I think my phone number may be circulating through different scam call centres since this hasn’t stopped anything. I’m surprised they don’t jump out at you anymore for a quick sell since the calls I’ve received are generally substanceless. Just the laboured briefing of someone at the end of a long shift who’s probably wracking their brain for a clever line to say. Regardless, I’ve tried every piece of advice you gave me. For those of you who suggested speaking to a priest, I visited our city’s church and told them outright that I believed my flat was haunted and asked if there was anything they could do. Unfortunately, they took my pleas as mockery and shook their head in annoyance before asking me to leave. I also didn’t think it was worth going to the police. For one I’ve not been able to speak to a receptionist in a while, so I’ve not been able to confirm with them if I’m the only person in the flat, and two what exactly happened to me that’s worth a police report? Open cupboards and drawers, a note saying hello, and a shadow. That’s it. After today I’m starting to think about making one.

 

After my first post, I received a message from someone. For the sake of their privacy, I’ll be referring to them as Lin throughout the rest of this post. Lin is a “Witch”. That’s how she introduced herself to me. She messaged saying.

 

“Hello OP! This is a strange message to receive, but I think I can help you and your haunting. I’m a witch who’s well versed in all things paranormal and supernatural and would be more than happy to visit later this evening to contact the spirit and demand a reason for their restlessness.”

 

I didn’t have many options. Out of all the advice I had received, Lin’s suggestion was the one that made the most sense to me. I needed to make contact. I needed to know what I was dealing with. Luckily Lin lived on the other side of the same city as me. I offered to pay her tram fare, but she refused telling me that her passion for a good haunting would be the only payment she would need. I hoped she wouldn’t find one.

 

I wasn’t at all prepared for her visit. Living in a building with over a hundred students all having to share three washing machines, I was bound to lose my clothes at some point by some clueless idiot. Since the rest of my clothes are still dirty and I’ve not been able to get a turn with the washing machine, I had to welcome her wearing some shorts that were clearly too small for me and a white vest. She seemed startled when I opened the door, but after seeing the restlessness in my face she didn’t seem to mind as she brushed past me and made her way to the kitchen.

 

“Thank you for coming.”

 

“No, thank you for letting me come.”

 

She sat cross-legged on the kitchen floor rolling out a black mat.

 

“Is there anything you have that we can cover that light with? We need complete darkness for the ritual. Oh, and that corridor light too!”

 

I searched my bedroom for a while before settling on my bed cover and a pillowcase which I taped over both lights before stumbling my way through the darkness and sitting down opposite Lin as she faced the kitchen door.

 

“Now what?”

 

Her face lit by an ember glow as she struck a match and lit a candle.

 

“Tell me everything.”

 

“What do you mean? You read the post, didn’t you?”

 

She raised an eyebrow looking me up and down.

 

“Don’t kid yourself. I know that’s not everything. If that was everything you wouldn’t have posted about it. You weren’t in any danger after all.”

 

My eyes downcast at the Ouija board she had placed down I let out a sigh.

 

“No. That’s not everything. I’ve been hearing the rattle of chains. I didn’t mention it since I didn’t believe it myself. They’re ever so faint and the first time I thought I had imagined it but then it came again. Night after night, the same distant rattling of chains and metal chinking against each other ringing out from my door.”

 

“Is that everything?”

 

I nodded.

 

“Well then. That makes things a little easier.”

 

My eyes wandered back up to her smiling face.

 

“It does?”

 

“Of course it does! You know where you are right? The Steel City! This place was once the heart of the country's steel production during World War 2 and has held the title for decades now. You, my dear friend, are living with the ghost of an ironworker.”

 

I felt shock become lodged in my tightened throat my eyes wide with bated breath for her next sentence.

 

“Shall we get to it then?”

 

She said placing her finger on the triangular piece of wood of the Ouija board. I felt my heartbeat quicken a little at the thought. I was sceptic by all accounts, but even this was branching a little too far into the paranormal. Seizing a fleeting glimpse of bravery I shot my hand out placing it atop the triangle, Lin’s ever-present smile my reassurance I was in the right hands. She cleared her throat and began.

 

“Spirit, are you here?”

 

I felt the atmosphere shift as if all the air in the room became suspended. My arm began to ache, and tremble sweat trickling down, I felt the triangle begin to pull. This wasn’t real. It couldn’t be. Slowly scraping across the board, the triangle stopped on the word “yes”. Phlegm crawling up my throat I felt like I was going to be sick.

 

“What is your name?”

 

The triangle didn’t move. I let out a heavy sigh, thankful for its lack of response.

 

“What is your name?”

 

It still didn’t move. I looked back up to Lin’s face. Her eyes were like knives staring right at me, stone-faced as if she were carved from granite.

 

“Do you intend to bring about harm?”

 

The triangle didn’t move, still suspended on the word “yes”.

 

“Spirit! Move the triangle if you intend to bring about harm!”

 

The triangle remained motionless. I could tell she was starting to become impatient, her face contorting into annoyance.

 

“Spiri-“

 

Her lip quivering, eyes unblinking as beads of sweat began to shoot down from her forehead. Her eyes looked past me, bloodshot, her eyelids widening beyond capability ready to tear at any second. My whole-body shook. Turning behind me she yelled out.

 

“Don’t look! You can’t look! He’s here. Trust me on that. He looks angry. He’s looking straight at me.”

 

“Wha-“

 

“Don’t speak!  If we’re both possessed there’s no hope! I will relay what I see if I become possessed, I trust you’ll seek the necessary guidance to release me from his iron grip.”

 

We sat in silence for a while, her eyes never averting from the door behind. After a while she started to calm herself down, probably starting to become accustomed to our visitor.

 

“He’s gone now…. I think that’s enough for tonight.”

 

She said retracting her finger from the triangle and blowing the candle out as she did so, plunging the room into darkness. I stood up blindly reaching for the pillowcase above, yanking it down as light filled the room once again.

 

“I suggest you stay at a friend’s tonight.”

 

I didn’t question her any further on the matter. I’m now staying over at my friend Michael’s place who I met last week at a club. I told him everything that happened. The shadow, the empty mould-infested rooms, the cupboards, everything. He didn’t say anything the whole time. Stone-faced and listening intently nodding his head a few times until I finished. He closed his eyes and nodded once before unclenching his jaw in bellowing laughter wiping away the tears from his eyes.

 

“Christ man you really are a nut case, aren’t you! Hahahaha!”

 

I could feel my face turning red letting my eyes wander about the room. Michael caught on soon enough after the gravity of my situation set in.

 

“It's okay man. You can crash here for as long as you like. By any means, it can’t be as haunting as your pickup line to that girl a couple nights ago. I mean seriously! What were you thinking?”

 

“It wasn’t that bad.”

 

“Not that bad!? First of all, you should really start treating your lady right, and second of all… well there isn’t even a second of all!”

 

“What are you talking about?”

 

“She called you a creep man. Are you saying you’re just used to that by now?”

 

“What? Dude, it was just an insult, plain and simple.”

 

“Errr no it's not. It's because everyone knows you're already taken. What’s with you trying to cheat anyway?”

 

My thoughts resembled that of a scrabble bag, my mouth hung open in confusion waiting for the words to come out. Michael pulled out his phone and started scrolling.

 

“You guys go everywhere together. She really must like you, and you just treat her like crap.”

 

I peered over at his phone. I felt my heart in my mouth, the rhythmic beats pulsing throughout my head the room beginning to spin. The profile he was on didn’t have a profile picture, but it had countless posts…. all of me. From the back of my head, a side view, front facing, and all while I was oblivious. Restaurants, libraries, clubs, everywhere. There wasn’t a single photo of whoever took them, just me. They last posted 2 days ago. An image of a door, a peephole in the middle, and the simple caption “Shut out again”.

 

I’m asking for your help. Can ghosts leave the place they are haunting? Can they…. post online? I could really do with some insight.
