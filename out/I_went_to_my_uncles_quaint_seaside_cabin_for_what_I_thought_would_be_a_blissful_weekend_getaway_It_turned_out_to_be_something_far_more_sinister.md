The nigh day-long bicycle ride through the backcountry to my uncle’s reclusive seaside cabin was a pleasant one, though its conclusion wasn’t lost on me. The wind that July day was the kind that went straight through you, caressing your insides and leaving you a bag of brittle bones in its wake. By the time I arrived at the door my hands had long since gone white, and drowsiness beckoned warmly.

I lingered outside on the porch for a while nonetheless, so that I might take in the lighthouse by the water in all its splendor, and bask in rays of sunshine now ephemeral, the dissipation of their delicate heat into my skin no doubt soon to be thwarted by the incoming evening storm creeping over the horizon.

Finding the moment just, I decided to give my uncle a call, if only to thank him for lending me the property for my weekend getaway. I spoke to him of the things I’d seen on the way, recounting rolling flowery fields and cotton candy-looking clouds that floated idly by. It was when I made mention of the lighthouse, and how beautiful it was, that he went eerily silent.

“R-really?” he finally sputtered.

“What: *really?*” I asked lightheartedly.

There followed a lengthy pause. My uncle’s voice was monotone when he answered.

“Are you outside, watching it as we speak?”

“Why, yes,” I replied. “The view truly is something, is it not?”

“Describe it to me.”

“Describe wh-”

“The lighthouse. Describe it.”

I opted to disregard his sudden peculiar state and play along.

“It’s a quaint little thing, light yellow with a tiny window in the midd-“

“With a red cupola and gallery atop the tower?”

“Um, yeah?”

“You see it too?”

“Of course I see it,” I said, uncertain whether my amusement ought to be concern. “It’s *there*.”

Another pause, longer.

“Alice... *Normal* people don’t see it.”

“You mean, they don’t *notice* it?”

“No,” he sighed deeply. “I mean they *can’t* see it. It doesn’t *exist*. I mean it *does*, just not to *them*.” When he felt my confusion he added: “I know this is your first time visiting my cabin, but I can assure you there isn’t supposed to be any lighthouse there. There never was for me until very recently.”

I chuckled to myself.

“Perhaps they built it over the winter,” I offered. “After all, you only just opened up the shack for summer last week. You’ve been away in the city the remainder of the year.”

“No no. Nobody ever built it. It doesn’t *really* exist!”

“I’m *not normal* then, am I not? Seeing as I’m seeing it...”

“Well, you’re the only other person I know who has.”

“Uncle Barry, is everything okay? You’re scaring me.”

Was this some attempt at a ruse? I’d never known my uncle as being much of a trickster.

“Further, the family came along with me last week,” he persisted as though I hadn’t spoken.

“Pardon?”

“The lighthouse, it isn’t new, in fact it’s surprisingly old. My family, they were with me.”

I shook my head.

“And what did they have to say about this?” I queried sternly.

“Oh, God forbid they ever find out about the lighthouse!”

“So you’ve not talked to them about it at all?” I exclaimed.

“Most certainly not. I was... *prepared*. Quite serendipitously so too.”

“Prithee, tell me why not,” I responded sarcastically, frustrated by his seemingly purposeful lack of clarity.

“It’s best they not find out about it, lest the lighthouse reveals itself to them as well. We were all present, yet the lighthouse only became visible to me, the sole individual who knew about it beforehand.”

Waves crashed and washed away rhythmically off in the distance, severing my uncle’s words and rendering them more incoherent than they already were.

“How can one have knowledge pertaining to something no one has seen?”

“As I said, I was somewhat prepared, hence me not telling them about it.”

“I don’t imagine seeing a lighthouse is the most special of events, and could see seeing one not cropping up in conversation. How are you to know your family didn’t see it?”

“They didn’t.”

I felt exasperated, the migraine that had pestered me since dawn now exacerbated by a discussion resembling more a merry-go-round than it did an actual discussion.

“You fear telling your family, yet here I stand, beholding a lighthouse I knew nothing of. How can your theory thus possibly hold?”

“Listen, I get that you’re ups-“

“And whatever would you be trying to achieve in the first place, sparing their eyes from something as innocuous as a lighthouse?”

“I really can’t explain...”

“Then *try*.”

It felt to me he was beating around the bush, stalling, like there was something more.

“I probably shouldn’t.”

“Fine,” I said. “I think it’s time I went to bed...”

My uncle sighed again, clearly ambivalent about something.

“Alice, you see, the hut’s been in the family for centuries. For generations it’s been the place where our ancestors spent their summers. And of them all only one ever wrote about a lighthouse in a dusty journal I happened upon in the attic. A lighthouse that appeared overnight, one that only he could perceive. He said everyone thought he’d gone mad.

“Naturally I didn’t believe a word of it either, but studied the entries regardless, and from those unknowingly gathered enough to be prepared for when I would eventually see it for myself, not that I expected I ever would.”

“I’m... I’m not sure I follow...” I began. Nonsensical and lackluster though my uncle’s postulations were, there was a seriousness underlying them that simply couldn’t be ignored.

“That written account is precisely a hundred years old, but that’s not all. I found a discarded painting, caked in cobwebs, predating the journal by another hundred years. It’s a depiction of a lighthouse. *The* lighthouse. It reoccurs periodically. So it appears.

“I need to know now, the door at its base, is it open? Is the entrance open?”

Asking why he took interest in something as mundane as a door was pointless. I didn’t much care. I simply peered at the lighthouse, at the doorway facing me.

“It is indeed, happy?” I said. Had it been open from the start? I’d been outside for so long I could no longer remember.

“Oh. I see.”

“What?” I pressed.

“Well.”

“Will you quit keeping things from me!” I snapped.

“The Keeper.”

“Huh??”

“The Keeper’s coming for you. Once the door is open, it means the Keeper’s seen you.”

“Who?”

“*The lighthouse keeper.*”

“Who’s that?”

“It’s what inhabits the lighthouse. A curse that runs in our bloodline. Alice, I’m so terribly sorry, but there’s absolutely nothing you or I can do anymore. It was meant to be me, but I ran, managed to get away in time.

“I’d understood from reading the journal that the door isn’t always open. Once it is however, that’s really all she wrote. Our ancestor’s writings spanned over a handful of days, time during which he described the lighthouse and unsettling visions he was having. In his final entry, he stated that something had changed: the door had mysteriously been opened.”

“What’s any of that got to do with me?” I blurted out after fruitless reflection.

“Granted few and far between, it’s well known within the family that over the years there have been... acciden- *No*, fuck this, I can’t...” My uncle stopped, audibly overcome with emotion.

The sun suffocated in a thick veil of grey then, and the cold swooped down on me with great fervency.

“*Uncle Barry?*”

I waited anxiously, the questions swirling around in my head plenty.

This seemed real enough. The lighthouse was, wasn’t it? I mean, obviously it was real. After all, there it was, right? Right *there*. But was it *real* real, the type of real my uncle propounded it was? The type that wasn’t *really* real for most but for some was? Was that really what it was?

Was the Keeper *real* too? And what if the Keeper was?

I didn’t want to talk to any keeper. I didn’t want to be disturbed while on my solo break. I didn’t wa-

“I didn’t want it to be one of my children,” Barry continued. “I knew it was merely a matter of time before it revealed itself to someone else, given that I would never return. So I sent you there under the pretense of spending a nice relaxing weekend. *Fuck*. I’m so- I- Fuck, fuck, fuck, fu- *What the hell have I done?*“

His breaths were heavy. Short. Almost mimicking the ocean’s to-and-fros.

A sniffle. Another sniffle. More sniffles.

Quiet. How I detested that. In it I tried drawing some semblance of sense from the mess my uncle had laid out before me, to no avail.

“I hope you can find it in you to forgive me,” were his parting words, and swiftly he hung up, leaving me alone with the wind and its hardly comforting touch, on a beach with a lighthouse bearing some degree of existence.

I didn’t know just what to do then, and so frantically I wrote, before darkness swallowed the world and I was unable to see the lighthouse and its gaping door anymore.
