Going to try and make this short. 

When I was a kid I was typically very curious and I would always have something in my hands to fidget with. I found a fascination with BB guns and quickly learned how to take them apart and put them back together. At this same time I was also experiencing some pretty brutal abuse from my mother who took her anger for my father out on me more often than not. Some nights she would barge into  my room drunk because I was a little too loud while playing Xbox and she would beat the ever loving shit out of me. These types of encounters would occur for about 8 years until I moved out and cause me a fair bit of trauma. 

Fast forward 5-6 years and I'm 23 living with my dad. Though I left my moms house and I barely see her, I still have some form of stress and anxiety from time to time just thinking about my childhood. For these very reason I have accumulated a pretty substantial amount of firepower due to my constant desire to "be in control", since my entire life ive pretty much been controlled by my mother. With this being said, I usually sleep with a 1911 above my head but it's usually not hot (cocked).

One night for no particular reason I was taking apart and putting back together my 1911 and I seemed to have passed out with it in my hand on my side. A few hours go by and I'm dead asleep until around 3:30am. I wake up and I find myself in a weird situation where I can open my eyes but my body is in this paralyzed type of state. I later found out this is what people refer to as "sleep paralysis". The issue at hand is that while I'm in this sleep paralysis there is a towering black figure standing at the foot of my bed. Being that it's 4 in the fucking morning I can make the reasonable assumption that it probably isn't my dad, and if it was my dad I would swiftly move right the fuck out. So coming to the conclusion that it's not my father I fall into a state of panic. I soon remember that I fell asleep with a pistol in my right hand. I swiftly try to grip the 1911 but once again I'm basically paralyzed from the sleep paralysis. The menacing shadowy figure starts to slowly creep over me and I now descend into a full on panic attack trying to gain control of my body so I can blast this fucking demon with my .45. Once I realize that I'm thoroughly fucked, I submit to the fear and pass out. I wake up what I can only imagine to be about 5 minutes later and I have full control over my body. I also notice I'm drenched in sweat with my heart basically beating out of my chest.

I quickly grab my gun and rack a round into the chamber then I swiftly changed my sweat drenched clothes after turning on almost every light in my house. I then sit on the edge my bed and contemplate what the fuck just happened. I end up calming down and lye back into my bed an hour later with what I can only describe as a death grip on my pistol. I doze off and just as I'm about to fall back asleep a voice that seemed to come from right over me whispers "don't let the bed bugs bite". I instantly rip my eyes open and there was nothing there. I ended up not going to sleep for 3 days straight out of pure fear of what would happen if I fell back asleep. 

Eventually I fell asleep and to my surprise I woke up about 14 hours later without a single incident. Till this day I still sleep with my 1911 and that bitch ass demon hasn't returned.
