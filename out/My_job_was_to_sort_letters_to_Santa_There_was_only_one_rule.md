———

The days started stacking on top of each other in a way that didn’t feel linear anymore, like time itself was bending around whatever had crawled into my life. 

By Day 10, I was waking up with my jaw clenched so tight I swear my teeth were loosening, and every night I swore I heard it breathing somewhere in the house, slow and steady, like it was syncing itself to my heartbeat. 

The letters kept coming, each written in that same jittery ink that smelled faintly metallic, each one announcing the next “day” of whatever countdown I had apparently been enrolled in without consent. 

My brother’s voice kept looping in my head—his anger, the way he shoved the letter back at me and told me I was inventing things again, that I was slipping. 

After he kicked me out, I had tried not to think about him or the stupid stocking tucked into my coat pocket, the one I bought weeks ago for my nephew because he still believed in the kind of Christmas magic I never got to keep. 

Holding the stocking had become a nervous habit, something I’d do without realizing, rubbing my thumb over his crooked embroidered name like I could rub luck into myself by force.

Day 11 passed with the thing sitting cross-legged at the foot of my bed all night, its limbs too long, its posture too still, like a marionette someone forgot to animate. I didn’t sleep. 

On Day 12, it followed me from room to room without sound, always stopping just a few feet behind me, always tilting its head as if studying the back of my skull. By then the air inside the house felt thick, almost syrupy, and every time I exhaled I could see the fog of my breath drifting in front of me. It wasn’t winter cold. It was something else. A purposeful cold. A cold with intent.

Day 13 began without the usual letter shoved under the door. The house was dead silent, but the kind of silence that hums, as if something bigger than the building is holding its breath. I walked through the house slowly, trying to pretend I wasn’t expecting to see it, but some part of me knew I would. 

I ended up in the living room, and at first I thought the tree lights were flickering because of faulty wiring, but the longer I stared, the more I realized the glow was reacting to something standing in front of it. 

The creature had always been a shapeless, hunched mass in the dark, but now it looked different—more defined, more deliberate. Its horns scraped the ceiling, its body cast no shadow, and the air around it trembled faintly like heat waves rising from asphalt. 

It didn’t move toward me. It simply lifted one long arm and opened its palm, as smooth and silent as a stage magician beginning a trick. I felt the meaning in my bones before my brain even interpreted it. It wasn’t threatening me. It was asking. It wanted a gift.

Something about the gesture, the posture, the timing—it felt like a warped parody of Christmas tradition, and some deep, primitive part of me knew defying it would end things violently and quickly. 

My hands shook as I fumbled inside my coat, fingers brushing soft felt. The stocking. My nephew’s stocking. The one I had carried around for too long because mailing it felt like admitting I was done trying to fix things with my brother. 

When I pulled it out, the creature leaned forward slightly, not with hunger or aggression, but with a childlike expectancy that made my stomach twist. I extended my arm, the stocking dangling from my fingertips, and the creature’s hand closed around it so gently I almost imagined warmth in its touch. It drew back slowly, curled its long fingers inward, and for a moment everything went still.

It held up its hands as if to show me something, and then when it opened its hands the stocking was gone. Like some kind of fucked up magic trick.

No fading. No dissolving. No burn mark. Just gone, like it had never existed at all. The creature dipped its head, a gesture that might have been gratitude or acknowledgment or mockery, and then stepped backward into the dark corner behind the tree. 

The darkness swallowed it whole without even a ripple, and the house felt lighter for half a second before I realized the air wasn’t warming back up. Whatever rule I had followed, whatever bargain I had participated in, it hadn’t been a relief. It had been completed.

I made it through the night. I stayed awake until morning, waiting for the next letter, waiting for the next day to tell me what came after thirteen, but nothing arrived. Instead, just after dawn, my phone rang, and the number on the screen turned my stomach to stone. My brother never called me. Ever. 

Especially after what he thought I did.

“Hello?” I answered, bracing myself out of habit. I expected anger or that exhausted frustration, but what came through the speaker wasn’t anything like that. It was breathing—ragged, panicked, fast.

“Are you—are you awake?” my brother asked. His voice cracked on the last word.

“Yeah,” I said, sitting up. “What’s going on? Are you hurt?”

“No,” he said quickly, then corrected himself with a trembling inhale. “No, I’m not. But he’s gone.”

My stomach tightened. “Who’s gone?”

“My son!” he shouted, but it wasn’t anger—it was terror folding in on itself. I heard a door slam somewhere behind him, people talking, maybe police radios. “He’s not in his bed, he’s not anywhere in the house, he—he’s just not here!”

“What do you mean he’s not there?” I asked, trying to keep my voice level even as a cold pulse went through my spine. “Did he sneak outside? Did you check the neighbors’ yards?”

“You’re not listening,” he said, words shaking violently. “His door was locked from the inside. I had to open it myself this morning. His window’s shut, the screen is intact, nothing’s moved. He’s just gone. Like he disappeared out of thin air.”

My fingers went numb around the phone. “Did you call the cops? What did Delilah say?”

“They’re here, and Delilah hasn’t been able to get out of bed in a few weeks, but that’s not the point.” he said, exhaling shakily. “They’re doing a search, but—God, I can’t—none of this makes sense.”

I heard him pacing, footsteps uneven across the hardwood. He wasn’t a crier, not even at the funeral for our dad, but now I could hear tears breaking through his breathing. 

“He fell asleep holding that stupid stocking,” he said hoarsely. “The one with his name stitched on it. He would not let it go. He said he wanted to wake up with it.”

The world around me felt like it shrank, like something was tightening around my ribs one inch at a time.

“He had it?” I asked. “Last night?”

“Yes, last night,” he said, almost pleading for me to understand something he couldn’t articulate. “I tucked him in. He was clutching it to his chest. I checked on him around midnight and he was still holding it. And now—” His voice broke again. “Now the stocking’s gone too. I thought maybe he dropped it somewhere, but it’s nowhere. I don’t understand. Nothing is disturbed. Nothing.”

The room seemed to tilt. I felt myself lowering onto the arm of the couch without meaning to. The stocking. His name. The long, pale hand closing around it. The vanishing. The bow. The exchange.

My brother kept talking, but his words sounded distant, muffled, like I was submerged underwater. “They think maybe he wandered off, but he wouldn’t. You know he wouldn’t. He hates the dark. He wouldn’t leave that room without calling for me. I don’t know what to do.”

I pressed a hand to my forehead, trying to breathe through the crushing realization grinding its way into me. I couldn’t tell him. I couldn’t say anything. I couldn’t explain something I didn’t fully understand without sounding insane. And worse—I couldn’t confirm what I was starting to believe.

“I’m sorry,” I said quietly, forcing my voice to stay steady. “I’m so, so sorry. I’m here. Whatever you need, I’m here. Just… tell me what the police are saying. Tell me everything.”

He exhaled shakily, trying to hold himself together. “Just… just stay by your phone,” he said. “In case they need to talk to everyone in the family. I can’t—I can’t think straight right now.”

“I’m here,” I said again, but my throat felt tight and wrong.

When he hung up, I just sat there, staring at the corner of the living room where the creature had stood, where its shadow had swallowed the stocking whole.

I didn’t say it out loud.

I didn’t let the words form.

But somewhere deep in me, the truth settled with a sickening certainty.

The creature hadn’t taken an object.

It had taken the name it represented.

And on Day 13, I handed it over.
