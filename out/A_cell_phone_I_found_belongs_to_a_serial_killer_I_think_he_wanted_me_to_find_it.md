I’m a pretty solitary person. I like my alone time. The very definition of an introvert. I took out extra student loans in college to afford a solo dorm room. That’s how serious I am about it. In order to escape humanity, I have several secluded, quiet places I like to visit throughout the week, just to get a breath of air.

They’re my secret hideouts where I recharge. A hidden glade in the woods by my apartment, an abandoned path at the end of my block leading to a lookout above the freeway, the roof of my complex only accessible by fire escape. Nobody ever goes to any of these places but me. They’re mine, and when I’m there, I feel safe, set apart from the world.

So when I found an iPhone placed conspicuously where I usually sit in the glade, I became pretty upset. It was a mild summer afternoon, the perfect weather to spend an hour in my woodsy retreat. But my succor was spoiled when my eyes fell upon the device. Who has been in my space?

I scanned the vicinity for movement, as if the owner of the cell phone might still be around. Perhaps it had slipped from their pocket and they’d be trekking back to find it any moment. But a feeling in the pit of my stomach told me that wasn’t the case. The phone sat there too perfectly, resting on a boulder in the middle of the clearing.

As if it had been intentionally placed there.

I didn’t think twice about picking it up and looking through it. I knew I should’ve ignored it, left the area, kept my nose in my own business. But, well, you see, I’ve got a little problem with that. I’m a bit of a voyeur. I like to snoop. Most of my quiet places are selected for their vantage. I take binoculars and spy on people. It gives me a sense of power.

I know, I know, it’s messed up. But totally, completely harmless. Whose curiosity doesn’t get the better of them from time to time?

To my surprise, the phone was unlocked. I swiped up on the screen and saw the collection of apps, web browser, camera, notes. Curiously, there weren’t any social media apps, no dating apps, nothing that wasn’t already loaded onto a phone out the box. Like it was brand new.

My interest piqued, I opened the camera first and saw hundreds of photos organized into several different albums. I went to the first and flipped through them. They were all one woman, dark hair, green eyes, pretty in a mousy sort of way. But in none of them was she posing for the camera. In each, it seemed like she had no idea someone was snapping shots of her. There were pics of her at an art museum, walking down the sidewalk, eating at a local taco joint—

I gasped when I got to the final shots. There were dozens of them, all of her sleeping soundly in her bed. What sort of creep takes so many shots of a person sleeping? I checked out the other photo albums to find each was a repetition of the same pattern. A girl going about her day, then sleeping in her bedroom alone.

But she wasn’t really alone, was she?

With trembling hands, I closed the photo app and opened notes. I don’t know what I expected. Perhaps I hoped there would be some reasonable explanation for the pictures I’d seen, an artist’s statement about a postmodern photo project. “Surveillance in the Modern Era” or something.

Instead, there were detailed descriptions of five different murders. It was like reading a police report, but with extra commentary. The author of the notes would list all the places he stuck his knife, but then also how delightful the resulting screams had been. He timed each killing, from the moment of the first stab to the second he witnessed the life fade from their eyes.

A shiver ran the length of my spine. Gooseflesh broke out across my forearms. What was I reading? This couldn’t be real, could it? It had to be some sort of depraved, elaborate prank. Right?

Against my better judgment, I took the phone home with me. That night, I conducted my investigation. Sure enough, each woman in the phone corresponded to a missing persons case. I was able to match each face to a picture posted on local news sites. In all five, the body was never found. No evidence of foul play, suicide not ruled out.

Could I really be in possession of a serial killer’s phone? That question gave rise to a more disturbing follow up: how had this person been so careless with such damning evidence?

I should have reported it as soon as I pieced together what I had. I should have turned the phone over to authorities so that they might use it to find the sick person who owned it. But as days passed, I wrestled with the decision. I couldn’t shake the feeling that they hadn’t been careless, that the lost phone wasn’t really all that lost.

Which meant two things. First, that the presumed killer probably covered their tracks pretty damn well. Even if I handed over this phone to police, it seemed unlikely to me it would lead to an arrest. Or worse, they would make an arrest, but it would be my wrists they slap the cuffs on. Because I could find no personal identifying information anywhere on the phone. It seemed to be a prepay with no accounts logged in. A perfect burner. In lieu of any better suspects, the cops would logically turn their eye to me.

The second thing was that I was meant to find it. That the killer wanted me to have this phone and knew just where to put it so that I would find it and no one else would.

That possibility occupied my thoughts for days as I struggled to ascertain the reason. Why share this information? Why share it with me? What had I done to merit their trust?

Then it rang.

An unknown caller ID flashed on the screen as I lay in bed reading. I froze, staring at the phone until the call went to voicemail. Then I stared for another half hour, waiting for the notification a voicemail was left. But the caller chose not to leave one. Was it the killer trying to contact me? Verify that I’d put two and two together? Did they know I had the phone still? Were they watching me?

The call happened again the next night, and the next night after that. For five days in a row, I watched in horrified silence as “Unknown” blared on the screen, each time too petrified to answer. I didn’t know what to do. Should I have picked up? Told the person they were evil, that they should stop what they were doing? That would make me crazier than they were.

Last night, instead of calling, they sent a text. It read: “I know you’re seeing this.”

A second text came five minutes after the first. It contained a picture of a blonde sipping her latte at the coffee shop just down the street from my apartment complex.

I shut the phone off, but I haven’t gotten rid of it. Right now, it sits at the bottom of my sock drawer like a terrible secret.

And every waking moment, I think about responding.
