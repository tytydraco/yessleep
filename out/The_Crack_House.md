This happened when I was about 15, my dad had been working in the police station. He usually got off his shift at 9 P.M. One day, he took me to work one day because I was obsessed in becoming a police officer. The objective was to find drugs in a junkie's apartment.  


  
Before heading to the house, my mom made a really heavy breakfast which was eggs and chicken wings. We reached the apartment in about 2 hours of driving. My dad went to the receptionist to inform her about an investigation on the 6th floor. I went off on my own thinking my dad will come in a bit but turns out I was on the wrong floor and I saw one man walking like a total zombie. I ran to my dad to confront him while the receptionist told him that the owners of the condo had recently moved out to our neighborhood. Basically a 3 minute walk. So, we headed back and we went to another investigation site for the day.  


  
My dad didn't have shifts for the next 2 days. After a little bit of fun time, It was 8 P.M. in the night I was finishing my homework and my dad was out drunk and unconscious. Later at 11 P.M. my mother went to sleep and told me to sleep as well. I was trying to sleep but I couldn't because I was having the thought of becoming a "neighborhood hero" by arresting the junkie. At 1:39 A.M. I made sure everyone was sleep and then headed out on my cycle to that house. I peeked in the window to see a woman with black hair and a purple attire injecting what was later found out to be meth. The woman had seen me peek through there. I ran towards my bicycle and speeded towards my home and I couldn't tell my dad because he'd scold me for going out alone. I hardly was able to get any sleep.  
Another day had begun and my mother was out to her parents side for a few weeks and my dad had to either stay home or take me with him. One day my father couldn't take me with him and said "Stay over at your friends house, text me when you need me."  


  
So at about 4 P.M. I took my stuff and rode my bicycle to my friends. Fast forward his mother was running out of groceries and requested me to get some. It was 7 P.M. and it was getting really dark. I went out to the grocery store and saw the same woman who was injecting meth buying some groceries as well. It felt like she was stalking me. I bought my groceries and headed out to my friends'. The woman got out 5 minutes after me and trailed me. I was feeling a bit sick after eating snacks at my friends' and I was getting dizzy. The woman whom I didn't recognize and was following me spoke to me and said "You good? You look sick. How about you stay at my place?" I said yes, because my friend's home was another 15 minutes away and I felt like puking.  


 I entered her home and she said "Don't visit any other room without my permission." She locked me in that room and planned to kidnap me. I didn't have access to Internet in that home. I overheard a conversation with her dealer about the meth prices. I realized it was that junkie whom my father was investigating.  
I broke the door she locked me in and started running towards the grocery store as it was 6 minutes away. The woman heard me and began chasing me. I was feeling too dizzy to run straight. It was 9:17 P.M. my father had gone off his shift and heading towards my home I then saw a police car in the way and I tried to stop it but the woman was gone.  
In about 2 weeks we found out she died from drug overdose.
