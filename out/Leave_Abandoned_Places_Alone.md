*The bunker is located northwest of Steel Valley Lake, about a mile from the largest fallen tree. The tree is easy to spot; it's a dark gray most of the time, but a light gray on sunny days. Almost white. Steel Valley is an old mining town in West Virginia, although unmarked as it was abandoned almost two hundred years ago. You can guess what the mining town was known for.*



I do a lot of research on old American legends. The internet is a wonderful and terrifying thing, but what I love most about it is the connections I can make with people. I used to meet people in online chat rooms back when the internet still had dial-up tones and punchy sound effects. Over the years, I learned more than a few things from programming, so even as we have advanced in technology, many places still stick around, and my knowledge helps me find them.

Old websites that should have died a long time ago are still out there, but since they weren't well known, they fell into the dark recesses of the internet. You have probably heard of some of them. I am not talking about the dark internet but the forgotten internet. I'm sure if more people knew about some of these websites and visited them more often, the search engines would push them forward. As it stands, though, I think they should remain where they are—which is why that information will die with me.

That being said, I visited one of these websites in early 2023. A website on the supernatural. I browsed some old stories and posts, even interacted with the chat room to see if some familiar names popped up. No such luck, and many of my favorite pages had stopped working. Whoever ran the website clearly didn't get with the times—everything looked so old. At least that made it easier for me to navigate to some familiar pages. One such page was one that was regularly being updated—ghost towns.

My heart almost jumped when I saw the most recent post was in the same month I was looking at the website, but then I saw the title of the post was just asking if anybody still visited the website. There were many similar posts before that. People like me feel nostalgic about the past and look up their favorite websites to see if they have grown and fallen behind. It made me feel more than a little sad for myself—a bad habit I was trying to get out of.

Scrolling through those posts, I eventually reached a post that actually fit the theme of the page—*I found a strange bunker in West Virginia.*

The post was made in 2018, which was still recent enough in my eyes. I clicked on the post, and it was pretty bare-bones. Directions to the bunker, which I have written above, a poorly taken picture of a dead tree at the edge of a lake, and a short explanation. It was a short but detailed account of someone who was hiking, found an old town from the early 1800s, and stumbled across a bunker entrance that they couldn't open.

No picture of the town or the bunker, just the tree. Immediately, I found it odd, as it didn't make sense why he was sharing it. Usually, the posts on the website were spooky stories—the page was called 'ghost towns, ' after all. Yet, they didn't say anything about ghosts. It seemed more like a curiosity post, and that's all I felt looking at it. It took me a minute to read it all again before returning to the photo. I stared at it a long minute, looking for something. A hidden trollface or a poorly edited ghost in the background, but there was nothing.

I downloaded the image and fiddled with the settings, but nothing stood out. It was just a normal picture.

After a while, I realized why I was so interested. I live in West Virginia. If there was such a lake with a true, I'm sure it wouldn't be too difficult to find. I could figure out some hiking spots, look at old maps, find mining towns, and so on. I had done more research on far more obscure things. Yet, at least with those things, I had something to go on. I had stories, rumors, and all sorts of scary implications. Frustrated, I immediately dove down the rabbit hole to see what I could find.



A month later, I was trudging through the forest, scouting out areas that I felt best matched the picture. The trees, the season, the time it was posted. I had to make a lot of assumptions, and even then, I still had fifteen locations to check. A month is a long time to obsess over something, so when I reached the point where the only thing left to do was…go and see. I spent a good long time sitting on my ass, wondering if I should leave it there, but once again…I live in West Virginia. Whatever it was, it was close.

And even if I found nothing, it would be a story to tell. A bad one, but it's still a story.

The first four locations proved to be a dead end. The lakes were tiny spots, secluded. I didn't see any fallen gray trees or mining towns. I would mark the circled areas with a red X and move on. Some locations I could reach on foot in half an hour, and the time spent hiking wasn't bad. I listened to the sounds of nature and caught glimpses of wildlife skittering along the forest ground or prancing behind bushes.

Even though I hadn't found anything yet, I wasn't feeling like I was wasting my time.

Yet, around the fifth lake spot, the weather took a turn for the worse. As I was leaving, returning to my car to drive to the next area, the rain came in. It was cold enough without it, but it made the experience a little more miserable. I was prepared to go home, but it seemed to settle down at the next stop. The ground became a bit more spongy, rock surfaces slippery, but not too bad. I kept a jacket handy in case the rain started up again and just focused on checking out the next location.

I only had so many off days, so I wanted to make the most of the one I was spending on this personal project.

After climbing the next hill, I got a decent view of the valley. It wasn't particularly large; neither was the lake, but the forest was thick. I still took some pictures with my phone. I almost wrote it off as another dud until I noticed straight edges on the phone screen. While the trees jostled in the breeze, there were some blackened structures among them, barely peeking between the branches. The trees themselves had grown among the buildings—the mining the post mentioned.

My first stop was the town, not simply because I wanted to check it out first, but because that was the safest path towards the lake. I had walked along the edge of the hill looking for a path before finding one that navigated slowly downwards. I made good use of the jacket just to avoid being scratched to pieces by the bushes and branches I had to go through. Eventually, I had only the thick tree coverage to contend with as I approached the town.

As I said, most of the structures were blacked and ruined. The trees had grown amongst them over the years, some pushing against what still stood. It was more than disturbing how much of it remained. I could guess some of them were residences, but they were stacked so closely together, and the rooms seemed so small. I guess if they were just temporary residences, there was no need for the comforts of home.

When I reached the end of the town, I was struck with the overwhelming feeling that someone might still be living there. I had no proof to back it up, but it's a feeling I get anytime I'm around abandoned places. Someone could be camping out, or hell, even squatting there. Crazy hobos or junkies, or this far out in the middle of nature, cannibal hermits. The mind can construct all manner of scary things, and the more plausible they are, the more scared I feel.

At that moment, I wanted to march right out of the valley and back to my car, but I had already walked through the dead town. The lake was ahead, so I set off, grateful to leave it behind. A part of me expected the lake to have changed, but it looked like I had walked straight into the picture I saw. I had no problem spotting the fallen tree on the other side of the glass-still lake. The waters were shockingly undisturbed, not a single ripple. Like it was holding its breath.

The trees barely creaked, and if they did, it was the trees back the way I had come. The silence reminded me of the deafening feeling I got when I was travelling by plane and coming in to land. I was just waiting for my ears to pop. Instead, I heard the clear sound of my footsteps as I made my way around the lake to the tree. The snaps of the twigs underfoot were comforting in that silence but not enough to put me at ease. When I reached the tree, I reached for the plastic compass attached to my backpack and held it up in the gray light the cloudy sky provided.

After finding Northwest, I began walking, counting my steps as I went to estimate the distance. 'About a mile' is vague, but I assumed that I would be able to spot the bunker the poster all the same. The forest thinned out, and I kept an eye on the compass, looking up now and then. After about twenty minutes of counting, I stopped.

I had reached the base of one of the taller hills, and sure enough, among a cluster of rocks, I found a moss-covered stone entrance and a rusted metal door. It wasn't like any bunker I had seen in my life. Instead of a square structure, it was pointed like a triangle, and the door looked like it belonged in an old submarine. With all the rust and broken bolts, it certainly looked like it had been dredged up from the ocean.

The first thing I did? I tried opening it. The weird valve in the center was stiff, and I wondered which way was the right way until I put all my weight on it. It made a crunching sound as it turned, suddenly halting as something snapped. I fell to the ground painfully, then checked my hands for any rust scratches. It painted my palms red and orange with tiny fragments. I had a small cut on my thumb, and as I was examining the blood, I saw the bunker door had swung open.

The entrance to the bunker was a black hole, which seemed a lot more scary while I saw there, my ass in mud and licking the blood away, just to spit it out next to me. I heard a steady sound of something deep within, but it didn't stand out—until it grew louder and louder in a matter of moments. I was easing myself back to my feet, leaning against the doorway, when something shot outside.

I gasped, lost my balance again, and fell down. Yet, because I held onto the edge, I swung against the outside of the bunker and faced the path I had come from. Far ahead, I could see a figure sprinting away. Dark clothes, a mess of hair. The steady sound from within the bunker was footsteps, and there were more on the way.

One by one, more figures ran out of the bunker and into the forest. All of them had long hair, gray with age, and were wearing dark outfits that looked like oversized windbreakers and cargo pants. I could hear them running, but they didn't make a sound. Not a huff of breath or a yell, nothing. What started slowly built up into a steady stream of figures scattering into the forest, running as if their lives depended on it. My heart was pounding with fear—not because of what I was seeing, but because I had a bad feeling about each one.

Once the runners stopped, the silence quickly returned. A minute after that, all I could see was the forest, just as it was before I opened the bunker. With my back to the hill, the entrance of the bunker beside me, I continued to stare in complete silence. I was frightened, not just surprised, and I was waiting for my body to approve the idea of getting up and moving. It kept telling me to be still, to wait. Pure instinct kept me from reacting or even breathing a little too loudly.

It didn't matter.

The next sounds I heard were slow, almost delicate steps. Another man had stepped outside the bunker, but because of the angle, I couldn't see him. Instead of running in the direction of the forest, he walked out in front of me. Steady, and sure of every move he made. He wasn't particularly large or even scary looking. He looked to be in his twenties, clean shaven, and his hair was youthful brown waves atop his head.

He wore the same clothes as the others, but they seemed to fit him better. Dark green cargo pants, boots, and a black jacket. The man's eyes focused on mine, and he squatted down in front of me. He had big eyes. He was examining me, taking in every detail, but his gaze always returned to my meet mine in a moment.

"Do you know what you did?" he asked me. "Or was this just…a happy accident?"

I only just opened my mouth when he smiled.

"An accident, I knew it," he said. "It's far too soon for this. The others are eager, but…they are young. You should know that the young make mistakes. You've made mistakes. And they…they will learn. Learn to wait. Learn to leave well enough alone. Oh, it's far too soon."

He looked absentmindedly towards the forest before suddenly crawling up beside me and sitting down. It scared the hell out of me. I skirted to the side so quickly, right up against the inclined side of the bunk entrance. He didn't mind, he just sat there.

'What are you people?" I asked, the jolt waking up my mouth as well as my body. "What is this place?"

"Don't worry…they're coming back now," he said. "It will be over in a moment. Ah, you should probably leave before they see you. It's a miracle they didn't smell you when the entrance opened. Of course, it is. And it’s far too soon."

"But…"

"Oh, and it's too late for you to leave now."

The man stood up suddenly, grabbed me by the wrist, and wrenched me to my feet. I don't mean pulled me to my feet; he hurt me badly. Tears welled up in my eyes, and when he released my arm, I held it against my chest while a piercing pain throbbed through my body from my shoulder. It wasn't dislocated, but a muscle or two were pulled.

"Stay behind me and don't make a sound," he said. There was not a single care in those eyes for the pain I was feeling. He only wanted me to do what he said for his sake.

Still, I held my peace when I heard the sound of running. He turned around, backed up into me, blocking me from view. A burnt smell rose off him, not too different from the smell my clothes had when I sat by the fire when I went camping. Smoke and something else.

Although I couldn't see, I heard them just fine. The runners had returned, filing back into the bunker. There must have been some hesitation because the man told a couple of them to quit stalling and get inside. The pain seemed to grow worse. I wanted to buckle and cry out. Give my pain an outlet. Screaming would have done the trick.

"There we go," he said, stepping away.

I fell to my knees, unable to continue. I let out a soft cry, feeling my breathing build up into full-blown panic. It hurt my heart. I was struggling with something else. A sense of worthlessness. I hated myself. My weakness. I hated to cry, but all I wanted to do was cry. It was physical and emotional pain, and it was growing worse and worse. I wanted to call for help, and yet I didn't know who to call out to. When all strength failed me, I fell onto my side and wept.

I opened my eyes long enough to see the man's face before it slipped out of sight. There was a grinding noise as the door set back in place, followed by more grinding, but it sounded like stone instead of metal. The pain began to fade. I cried out to God, my mother, my father, my friends, everyone. Even if they weren't there, calling out to them helped. It was like I was a kid again, weak and helpless.



Two hours later, before it got dark, I was in my car. I was in pain, but not so much that I wasn't willing to attempt a slow, steady drive home. The bunker door was shut, and I didn't dare try opening it again. That pain and helplessness was almost a blessing on my way back because as I walked past the silent lake, through the creepy mining town, I didn't feel any fear. I didn't care. I was operating on spite alone, an urge to survive.

Those bad feelings passed after a few days. The physical pain took a lot longer. I was just lucky I kept my job with all the off-days I took. I was a mess, and I am not ashamed to say it—my writing does not do my feelings any justice. My descriptions do not capture what I saw at all. The man that spoke to me looked and spoke to me in a certain way—almost with fondness, nostalgia.

It felt like I was a plaything. A toy in his eyes. But a toy he didn't want to throw away. A toy he wanted to keep, for memories sake. And being left alone to cry there felt like I was being put on a shelf in the closet, to be dealt with another day. That's the best way I can describe it. And opening that door was just pushing the closet open and getting in the way. It was too soon for me to be dealt with. So, back on the shelf I went.

And that's how I still feel. Like, I am waiting to find out what happens to me. I now leave abandoned places alone.
