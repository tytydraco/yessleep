My name is João, and I hesitated a lot before deciding to share this story with you. People tend to be incredulous about these matters and often judge quickly. However, on recommendation, I have resolved to reveal this experience here.

At sixteen, my life unfolded in the serenity of the interior of Pernambuco, Brazil. Our home was located on a vast expanse of land, surrounded by endless sugar cane fields that stretched as far as the eye could see. The nearest town barely deserved the title of a town; it was just a cluster of modest houses, a simple church, and a few shops scattered along a single dirt road. Life there was slow and peaceful, as if we were immune to the pressures and worries of the outside world.

We lived on a sugar cane farm, a property that had belonged to my family for generations. It was arid land, marked by the relentless sun that shone mercilessly over the golden fields. My father spent his days working in the cane fields, sweating under the scorching heat, while my mother took care of the house and us, her children, with unwavering love and dedication. My little sister, Ana, was the light of our lives, with her innocent laughter and insatiable curiosity about the world around her.

Our farm was a haven of tranquility, an oasis of calm amidst the bustle of the modern world. At night, we could contemplate the starry sky without the interference of city lights and listen to the sounds of nature echoing through the landscape. It was a simple life, but full of meaning, where family bonds were forged by close companionship, and traditional values ​​were preserved with pride.

My routine was a delicate dance between obligations and leisure moments. The sun would rise, painting the sky with orange hues, and I would already be up, ready to help my father in the plantation. The hours passed between hard work under the scorching sun, the sweet smell of sugar cane filling my senses. Each movement was a repeated ritual, a choreography I knew as well as my own breath.

In the afternoon, when the heat began to wane, I returned home. My mother, with agile hands and keen eyes, coordinated the household chores with the precision of a conductor. I helped where I could, washing dishes, sweeping the dirt floor, bringing firewood to the kitchen. It was a simple but comforting routine, an echo of ancient times when life flowed smoothly, without haste or worry.

At night, after a simple and comforting dinner, I had a brief moment of freedom. Sometimes, I retreated to a quiet corner of the house to devour the pages of a book, letting myself be carried away by stories that transported me to distant worlds and thrilling adventures. Other times, I went out to meet my friends, walking along dark roads under the starlight, sharing laughter and secrets until late into the night.

However, this tranquility was abruptly interrupted by something strange and inexplicable. It was on a morning like any other, when the sun rose on the horizon and the birdsong heralded a new day, that my father noticed the marks on the door. They were not simple scratches; they were deep grooves in the wood, as if something with sharp claws had torn the surface with supernatural force.

At first, we attributed these marks to wild animals, perhaps a jaguar in search of food or a hungry wolf. But we soon realized that there was something more sinister at play. The marks always appeared during the full moon, as if some hidden power were in tune with the cycles of nature, waiting for the right moment to manifest itself.

My family, rooted in the ancient legends and superstitions of the region, began to act cautiously. We placed food outside the house, hoping to appease any disturbed entity behind the mysterious marks. But, to our dismay, the manifestations did not cease; they only diminished in intensity, as if the creature haunting us was only testing our limits, waiting for the right moment to make its next move.

As the nights passed and the marks continued to appear, fear began to creep into our hearts. Every unexpected sound, every shadow in the darkness, left us tense and alert, fearing what might be lurking beyond the walls of our home. However, the worst part was when my younger sister, only six years old at the time, became the target of the creature. She reported hearing whispers in the wind at night, as if someone were outside her window, whispering dark secrets to her.

Restlessness began to grow within me. The nights were filled with a strange silence, interrupted only by the rustling of leaves and the sounds of the forest. Every noise, every unexpected sound made my heart beat faster. We knew something was out there, but we didn't know what. However, we became accustomed to the situation, in part thanks to the offerings our parents left every full moon night outside our house. Even in the face of strange events, we felt some relief in believing that we were a little safer.

As the nights unfolded, something even more sinister began to manifest. In addition to the marks on the door, mud marks began to appear on the windows, as if the one tormenting us not only wanted to scare us, but also to watch us closely. The fear that was already present in our hearts began to grow, fueled by each new clue of the invisible presence surrounding us.

Then things took an even darker turn. My sister, Ana, who was only six years old at the time, began to report disturbing things. She said she heard whispers in the wind at night, as if someone were outside her window, whispering dark secrets to her. Her frightened expression and the dark circles under her eyes betrayed the sleepless nights and torment that haunted her.

Worry and terror took hold of us. Every night became a frightening challenge, where every shadow seemed to hide an imminent threat. Even with the offerings left outside, we couldn't shake the feeling that something malevolent was lurking around us, patiently watching, waiting for the right moment to act.

Until it happened.

On that fateful night, darkness fell upon the house like a shadowy mantle, enveloping every corner in a cold and relentless embrace. The wind blew with a supernatural intensity, its howling gusts echoing through the corridors like the wails of lost souls begging for redemption. The moonlight, pale and sinister, cast its trembling rays through the windows, turning the furniture into twisted shapes and casting grotesque shadows on the walls.

Ana's sharp cry pierced the silence of the night, a sound so ominous that it seemed to come from the very bowels of the earth. It was as if a veil had been torn, revealing the hidden terror lurking in the shadows. We ran desperately to her room, our footsteps echoing through the empty corridors like the drumbeat of an imminent funeral.

Upon entering the room, we were greeted by a scene that resembled a painting of hell. The window was shattered into a thousand pieces, the sparkling glass scattered on the floor like shards of a broken mirror. The moon, in its macabre fullness, cast a trembling light on the scene, illuminating the nightmare unfolding before us.

Ana was crouched in a corner of the room, her small body trembling with terror, her wide eyes reflecting the horror consuming her from within. A sinister shadow loomed over her, a distorted and grotesque figure that seemed to have stepped straight out of the darkest nightmares. It was the Labatut, its presence exuding an aura of malice and despair.

It was an imposing and terrifying figure, a manifestation of terror in its most primal form. Its body was colossal, dominating the space with its intimidating presence. Hoofed feet pounded the ground with a force that made the earth tremble under its weight. Every step it took echoed like distant thunder, announcing its imminent arrival.

Its body was covered in rough and tangled fur, a dark coat that seemed to absorb the light around it, casting sinister shadows in all directions. Its single eye, in the middle of its forehead, gleamed with a terrifying intensity, radiating an aura of malice and power. It was as if it could see directly into the soul of those who crossed its path, probing the deepest secrets and fears.

The Labatut's mouth was filled with grotesque teeth, each as sharp as a blade, resembling elephant tusks ready to tear its prey apart. A low, menacing growl escaped its throat, filling the air with a sense of imminent terror. It was impossible to face that monster without feeling a shiver run down the spine, fear paralyzing the muscles and clouding the mind.

Its movements were agile and silent, despite its enormous stature. It moved like a shadow in the darkness, gliding between dark corners and narrow alleys with alarming ease. It was as if it were always lurking, waiting for the perfect moment to launch its deadly attack and disappear again into the shadows.

The Labatut was more than a simple creature; it was terror itself personified, a force of nature that defied any rational explanation. Its presence was a grim reminder that evil can take many forms, some beyond human comprehension, and that even the bravest can succumb to the darkness it represents.

My father, driven by a mixture of anger and despair, grabbed his shotgun and fired at the creature, but the shots seemed to dissipate in the air like smoke. The Labatut let out a deafening howl, a sound that made the hair on the back of my neck stand on end and my bones tremble with fear. And then, in the blink of an eye, it lunged at Ana, its claws outstretched to grab her and drag her into the darkness.

My mother, in a final act of desperation, threw herself over her, trying to protect her with her own fragile body. But it was too late. With a quick and brutal movement, the Labatut grabbed Ana and disappeared before our eyes, leaving behind only the echo of her anguished screams.

We stood there, paralyzed by shock and pain, as the emptiness of loss enveloped us like a cold mist. What remained of our family was torn apart, our hearts heavy with grief and despair. In the days that followed, the farm seemed darker and lonelier than ever, every shadow twisting like the very manifestation of the fear that consumed us from within.

I, especially, was haunted by the trauma of that fateful night. Every dark whisper of the wind transported me back to that moment, and every shadow turned into the grotesque figure of the Labatut, its sinister presence haunting my thoughts and deepest dreams.

I knew I could no longer live on that farm, surrounded by such painful memories and the constant fear of the unknown. So, when the time came, I left behind the life I knew, setting out in search of a new beginning in the big city. But even from a distance, the terror of that night never left me. The Labatut became a permanent shadow in my life, a ghost that haunted my thoughts and pursued me wherever I went. Every dark corner, every elongated shadow, was a cruel reminder of that terrible moment that changed the course of my existence forever.

In the big city, I tried to bury my memories under the weight of everyday life. I immersed myself in work, keeping my mind busy during the day to avoid the horrors that came at night. But even there, among the skyscrapers and bustling streets, I couldn't completely escape the past that haunted me.

The nights were the worst. Wrapped in the darkness of my apartment, I found myself at the mercy of my own dark thoughts. Every creak of the building's structure, every whisper of the wind, made me tremble with fear, transporting me back to that fateful night when the Labatut entered our lives and tore away our innocence and happiness.

I tried to find comfort where I could, seeking the help of therapists and counselors who promised relief for my tormented soul. But nothing seemed to completely dissipate the terror that clung to me like a persistent shadow, always present in the darkest corner of my mind.

Years passed, but the Labatut still remained as an indomitable presence in my life. Its twisted face appeared in my most vivid nightmares, its claws outstretched to pull me back into the depths of despair. I became a prisoner of my own fear, unable to escape the clutches of the monster that haunted me since that fateful night.

Sometimes I wonder if I will ever be able to free myself from the terror that consumes me, if I will ever find peace away from the clutches of the Labatut. But until then, I continue to fight, a lost soul in a sea of darkness, desperately awaiting the light that will one day free me from the nightmare that has become my life.
