Snow hit the windshield in wet, heavy slaps, and for the last two hours, the road had narrowed into something more like a snowmobile track than a county route. Jacob kept both hands on the wheel, leaning forward slightly like that would help him see through the white curtain sweeping across his headlights.

In the passenger seat, Mara scrolled through the map again. Not Google Maps. That had gone dark twenty miles back. This was an actual paper map — the old kind, with creases worn through and sharpie circles marking locations that hadn’t seen visitors in a decade.

“I think it’s still ahead a couple miles,” she said, biting her bottom lip.

“How do you even know that?” Jacob asked, trying to keep the frustration out of his voice.

Mara tapped the dash. “Because I know how to read a topographical map. And that radio tower we passed back there? It’s right here.” She pointed to a faint mark on the map. “Which means the cabin should be…” she dragged her finger down and to the left, “…about a mile past Deadman’s Ridge.”

“Jesus, Mara. Did it really say *Deadman’s Ridge*?”

She smiled faintly. “That’s what the old forestry maps called it. Probably just a name. Like Devil’s Lake or Hell’s Hollow.”

“Yeah,” Jacob muttered, “and people never die in places named after hell.”

From the back seat, a voice broke in — calm, thoughtful, and dry as ever.

“Well technically,” said Theo, “the Ojibwe name was *Mikwam-gimiwan* — ‘the place of cold rains.’”

Jacob didn’t respond. He focused on the road, which was now more of a trench through a thicket of skeletal birch and spruce. Another ten minutes and they’d reach the trailhead. From there, it was snowshoes, sleds, and a four-mile hike through God-knows-what to get to the cabin.

What had started as a reunion trip was turning into something much stranger.





There were five of them.

Jacob Greene — twenty-seven, ex-Army, quiet, dependable. Not the kind of man who spoke much, but when he did, people listened. After his discharge, he drifted into work as a wilderness survival instructor and didn’t stay long in cities.

Mara Walsh — twenty-six, intelligent, assertive, sharp-witted. The unofficial planner of the group, and Jacob’s ex. They still got along well enough, in that way two people do when they’ve been through too much to hate each other, but too different to last.

Theo Sharma — twenty-eight, sarcastic, fiercely intelligent, a cultural anthropologist working on his PhD. He’d spent two summers on First Nations land studying oral traditions and knew more about native myth than anyone Jacob had ever met.

Kenny Parks — twenty-five, the youngest, the glue. Everyone loved Kenny. Easy-going, kind, with an innocence about him that hadn’t been stripped away by adulthood. He was the one who convinced them all to come.

And Rachel Kim — twenty-six, medical resident, practical, observant, and more capable than she ever gave herself credit for. Rachel had a calm way about her, the kind that made you feel safer just by standing next to her.

Five friends who hadn’t been together in two years.

Five people, heading into the woods to a place with no cell service, no power, no help.

They’d brought gear. Tents, axes, satellite phone, emergency supplies. And plenty of food — dehydrated, canned, freeze-dried.

None of them had brought what they really needed.





They reached the trailhead just before dusk.

The van stopped at a crooked wooden sign half-buried in snow. The trail was unmarked, barely visible through the trees. Jacob killed the engine and opened the door.

The cold hit like a slap — not just temperature, but *silence*. A weight pressing on the air. The sound of the engine dying seemed to get swallowed instantly. No birds. No wind. Just snow whispering down onto snow.

They worked in silence, strapping on snowshoes, harnessing the sleds, double-checking packs.

“This is beautiful,” Rachel said, quietly. She stared at the birch trees glowing faintly in the dying light. “Like something out of a painting.”

Mara nodded. “It’s untouched. That’s the point.”

Jacob glanced at the trees, and for a second, thought he saw something dark between two trunks. Just a shape. Tall. Still. Watching.

He blinked, and it was gone.





The hike was slow.

The snow was knee-deep even with the shoes, and the sleds dragged like anchors. The trees grew thicker the deeper they went, until the world was just gray trunks and white powder, endless in all directions.

Theo talked most of the way. He recited old Ojibwe tales, mostly for his own benefit.

“They say the Wendigo is a spirit of winter,” he said at one point, somewhere in the third mile. “It’s born from starvation. From people who, during the worst winters, ate human flesh to survive. But it’s not just a monster — it’s a punishment. For greed. For weakness. For losing your soul to hunger.”

“I thought the Wendigo was the one with antlers,” Kenny said.

“No. That’s just a movie thing. The real one’s worse. It looks like a person, almost. Just… stretched. Like the hunger ate it from the inside out.”

Rachel shivered. “Great bedtime story, Theo.”

He smiled. “Just culture. Helps pass the time.”





They reached the cabin just after dark.

It stood low and wide, half-buried in a drift. Logs black with age, a sagging roof, and a heavy iron stove pipe jutting up like a broken finger. The door had no lock — just a wooden bar they had to lift with a grunt.

Inside, it smelled of wood dust, dry rot, and ash.

There were two rooms — one large space with a long table, hearth, and five bunks, and a smaller one in back that must’ve once served as storage.

Mara lit the propane lantern. The warm light made the shadows dance.

They unpacked in silence.

Kenny started a fire. Jacob checked the windows. Theo wandered the shelves, reading old trapper’s journals left behind.

And Rachel just stood at the door for a moment, her eyes distant.

“What is it?” Jacob asked.

She shook her head.

“Nothing. Just… feels weird. Like we’re being watched.”

He didn’t answer.

Because he’d felt it too.







The fire snapped and cracked like gunshots in the hearth, its glow carving soft amber shapes across the walls. Snowstorm winds sighed against the outside walls — never enough to shake the cabin, but just enough to make you think something was brushing against it. Something that didn’t breathe.

By nine, they were settled in. Gear unpacked. Sleeping bags rolled out. Canned chili heated over the propane burner and served in enamel mugs.

It should’ve been cozy.

But no one was really talking.

Mara sat near the hearth, staring into the flames. Her eyes were glassy with thought. Jacob sat beside her but didn’t speak. Something about being back here, in this place, surrounded by this kind of silence — it reached inside him like a hand and squeezed.

Rachel cleaned the dishes without being asked, hands red and cracked from the cold.

Kenny tried to lighten the mood.

“You know,” he said, spoon clinking his mug, “this is probably the most old-school winter trip anyone’s done since, like, the '60s. No phones. No generators. Just four feet of snow and some ghosts to keep us company.”

“Five people,” Theo said quietly. “We have five.”

Kenny raised a brow. “What?”

“You said four feet of snow and *some ghosts*,” Theo said, his voice strange and distracted. “You didn’t say five.”

“I—” Kenny chuckled awkwardly. “Yeah, I meant five. That’s not what I—"

Theo stood up abruptly. “I’m going to get some air.”

He pulled on his coat and stepped outside, boots crunching on the frozen steps.

Jacob watched the door for a long moment after it shut. Something about Theo’s tone had felt…off.





Outside, Theo stood facing the tree line.

The lantern light behind him barely touched the birches. They stood tall and thin, silver-white, silent. He could hear the wind shifting above the treetops — not down here, not near him. Up there. Where something moved among the branches.

He didn’t know why he’d said that about the ghosts.

He didn’t remember saying it at all.

But in his stomach, something sat cold and still — like river ice, thick and waiting.

He took a breath and rubbed his arms. “Get it together, Sharma,” he whispered.

That’s when he heard the crunch.

Just one footstep. Off to his left.

He turned.

Nothing.

Just trees and the slow drift of snow through moonlight.

Another crunch. Behind him this time.

He spun again — nothing.

Not nothing.

A shape, maybe.

Half-seen. Far back in the trees.

Gone before he could focus.

He swallowed hard and went back inside.





They didn’t speak of it that night.

They didn’t speak much at all.

Each one lay in their bunk, listening to the house creak with cold. The fire had burned low. The walls pulsed gently with shadow. Jacob, in the bunk closest to the door, listened for footsteps.

He’d been listening for them since they stepped foot in these woods.

Back in Afghanistan, he’d heard things at night too. Not monsters — just men. Trained ones. But that taught him how to hear intention. Pressure. Sound with purpose.

There was something out there. He didn’t know how he knew. But he *did*.

At some point, sleep took him.

And he dreamed.

He was standing in snow, naked to the waist, with ash on his hands and blood in his mouth. Mara stood across from him, blindfolded, arms open.

“I’m cold,” she whispered.

He tried to speak, but his jaw wouldn’t move.

“I’m *so* cold, Jacob.”

He stepped forward — and the snow swallowed him up to the neck in one impossible movement.

When he looked up, Mara was gone.

Something stood where she had been.

Gaunt.

White.

Mouth too wide.

Its eyes were burning holes in its skull — not fire, but hunger. A hunger that *remembered*.

Then he woke.

He didn’t scream.

Just sat up, sweating in the frozen dark.

He wasn’t the only one awake.

Mara sat up slowly in her own bunk across the room.

Her eyes found his.

“I heard something,” she whispered.

Jacob didn’t ask what.

He just got up, pulled on his coat, and checked the door.

The wooden bar was still in place.

But the handle was *icy*.

And wet.





**Morning came in gray silence.**

No birds.

No sun — just a thick, corpse-colored light that filtered through the frost-rimmed windows.

Kenny cooked breakfast. Theo hadn’t come out of his bunk yet. Rachel was already outside, checking their perimeter, methodically pacing the cabin like she was doing a hospital shift.

“I think something’s wrong with Theo,” Mara said quietly, eating half-heartedly from a tin of eggs. “He barely slept. Kept muttering in his sleep.”

Jacob nodded. “I’ll talk to him.”

But before he could get up, Theo walked out.

His eyes were red, but alert. His face pale and dry like a sheet of paper.

He sat without a word and began eating directly from the pot.

“Kinda hungry today, huh?” Kenny offered with a smile.

Theo didn’t look up.

“It’s the cold,” he said. “It eats through everything. You have to keep it away from the bones.”

Everyone stopped.

Rachel looked up from lacing her boots.

“What does that mean?”

Theo blinked, looked around as if noticing them for the first time.

“Sorry. Just a saying.”

Jacob watched him carefully.

Then he stood. “Let’s take a walk.”

Theo didn’t answer.

Jacob grabbed his rifle and nodded toward the tree line.

“Come on. We’ll go check the traps.”

There were no traps.

They just needed to talk.





The snow was worse than before — almost to the thigh in places. The woods, impossibly quiet.

After ten minutes, Jacob stopped and turned to Theo.

“You sick?”

Theo laughed bitterly. “Is that your subtle way of asking if I’m losing it?”

Jacob said nothing.

Theo looked up into the trees. “There’s something here, Jake. I know how it sounds. But this land… it holds things. Memory. Suffering. It doesn’t forget.”

“You’re not acting like yourself.”

“I *don’t feel like myself*.”

He looked down at his hands. They were shaking.

“You remember that book I brought? The Cree myth anthology?”

Jacob nodded.

“There’s a section on the Wendigo no one ever translates. Not properly. It talks about how it starts. Not when you see it. Not when you hear it. But when you *feel* it — inside you. Like a frost crawling through your bones. A hunger that starts small. That whispers.”

He looked at Jacob with haunted eyes.

“I think it’s whispering to me.”





They came back in silence.

The wind had picked up — no longer gentle, but dragging long low howls through the trees like something lost was trying to speak through them.

Inside the cabin, Mara was pacing.

When she saw them, she froze. “Where’s Rachel?”

Jacob blinked. “What do you mean?”

“She went out after you left. Said she was doing a perimeter check again, maybe heading down to the frozen stream.”

“That was two hours ago,” Kenny added. His voice had a strange edge to it — somewhere between concern and denial. “She always comes back by now.”

Jacob felt something cold knot in his chest. Not fear. Not yet. Just the knowing. The way animals know before weather hits. The old knowing that doesn’t speak in language.

“We’ll find her.”





They split into two groups — Jacob and Theo went south toward the stream bed. Mara and Kenny circled east toward the old forest stand. Radios kept on. Voices clear. Every ten minutes, they’d check in.

The stream bed lay in a narrow cut between two hills — half-choked with snow, frozen solid and wrapped in fog. Jacob scanned the ridgeline, his eyes constantly moving. He knew how to track. But this wasn’t a battlefield. This was worse. Here, the enemy didn’t need camouflage.

It *was* the forest.

Theo lagged behind. His steps were slower now. Less controlled. He stopped without warning, staring at something on a tree.

“What is it?” Jacob asked.

Theo pointed.

At first, Jacob saw nothing — then his eyes adjusted. Just beneath the frost line, carved into the bark, was a symbol.

A long vertical slash.

Then two crooked arms sprouting upward at a harsh angle.

Like a stick figure. But not one meant to represent a man.

A warning.

A ward.

Or a *memory*.

Theo crouched next to it, whispering under his breath.

“What’s that?” Jacob asked.

Theo looked up.

“It’s a warning from the Cree. I’ve seen it before in stories. They’d carve this symbol around cursed places. Places where… things had happened.”

“Why here?”

“Because this is where the hunger lives.”

Jacob didn’t like the way he said *hunger* — like it was something with a name.

His radio crackled to life.

“Jake,” Mara’s voice came through, breathless. “We found something.”





They found Rachel ten minutes later.

She was sitting upright against the trunk of a dead cedar, half-frozen, eyes wide open and staring at nothing.

Still breathing.

Her coat was open.

Boots gone.

Fingers bare.

Jacob dropped to his knees beside her. “Rachel! Hey—hey, stay with me. Look at me.”

Her lips were purple. Face pale as wax.

Frostbite already spreading across her hands like rot.

She didn’t blink.

Didn’t speak.

Mara stood back, arms wrapped around herself.

“She was like this when we found her,” she said quietly. “No signs of struggle. No tracks. Just… sitting like she’d been put there.”

Theo stood a few feet back, arms stiff at his sides. He hadn’t said a word since seeing her.

“Let’s get her back,” Jacob said.

And they did.

But they should’ve left her in the snow.





Inside, they stripped her down, warmed her as best they could. Used the emergency heat blankets. Fire roaring.

Her breathing improved. Pulse came back stronger. But her eyes stayed empty. Like she was watching something on the inside of her skull. Something that didn’t blink.

Mara tried talking to her. Kenny held her hand. Theo stood near the back wall, silently mouthing something Jacob couldn’t hear.

“Maybe it’s hypothermia,” Kenny said.

“It’s not just that,” Jacob replied. He was watching Theo. “This place is doing something to us.”

“You don’t believe in all that spirit stuff,” Kenny said.

“I believe in what I see.”

“And what do you see?”

Jacob looked at Theo.

“A man who’s hearing things that aren’t there. A girl who walked barefoot into the woods and forgot how to come back. And a storm that hasn’t stopped since we got here.”





That night, Rachel screamed.

It was the kind of scream that turns your blood into something thin and flighty.

Jacob bolted upright.

Rachel was on the floor, curled in a ball, clawing at her own stomach.

“No! No no no no no—” she sobbed. “It’s *inside me*!”

Mara and Kenny tried to grab her. She thrashed. Blood on her arms where her own nails tore the skin.

“It’s inside—inside—*I didn’t eat him!*”

Jacob dropped beside her. “Rachel! Listen to me. You’re not making sense. You’re—”

“I saw it. In the trees. Wearing his face.”

She stared at Jacob with something like clarity.

“It wears *faces*.”





She passed out an hour later. Pulse steady. But mind gone somewhere she couldn’t return from.

They took turns keeping watch.

Kenny first.

Then Mara.

Then Theo — though Jacob doubted he slept at all anymore.

By the time it was Jacob’s turn, the storm had risen again.

This time it *howled* — not like wind, but like *mourning*.

He sat by the fire, rifle across his lap, watching the shadows crawl behind the windows.

And when the noise came again — a *knock*, soft and deliberate, on the wall outside — he didn’t move.

Didn’t breathe.

It came again.

*Knock knock.*

Too high up to be a branch.

Too slow to be wind.

He stood, lifted the rifle, and moved to the door.

Paused.

Pressed his ear to the wood.

Silence.

Then—

“Jacob,” a voice whispered.

His mother’s voice.

Dead for eight years.

“Jacob. Open the door.”

He stepped back like he’d been slapped.

Behind him, Rachel sat bolt upright in bed.

“No,” she said. “Don’t listen. It doesn’t wear skin. It *becomes* it.”

Jacob turned to her. “What?”

But she was already asleep again.





By the fourth day, the storm had become a living thing.

It screamed through the trees, pressed against the cabin like a hand trying to squeeze the life from it. The wind didn’t feel random anymore. It came in pulses. Rhythmic. Intentional.

They had boarded the windows. Moved the bunks closer to the hearth. Started sleeping in shifts, though no one *really* slept.

Rachel hadn't spoken again. She just watched the door. Sometimes she whispered to herself — things Jacob didn’t recognize as language. Other times, she hummed old lullabies, tuneless and hollow.

Mara did what she could, but even she was unraveling. Her hair was always tied back now. Her face hard. She carried her sidearm everywhere, even when boiling water or brushing her teeth. That wasn't just stress — it was instinct.

Kenny was drinking.

Not much, but enough.

A mouthful of bourbon here. A shot of rum there. Just enough to soften the edges.

Jacob understood. Hell, he envied it.

Theo, though — Theo had stopped pretending.





They found the bones on the fifth day.





It was Mara who saw the smoke.

A thin gray column, rising against the slate-colored sky, far to the west. Maybe half a mile out. Through the break in the trees. A shape that shouldn’t be there.

“I thought no one else came out this way,” Kenny said, tightening his coat.

“They don’t,” Jacob answered.

So they followed it.

Jacob, Mara, Kenny — they left Rachel and Theo at the cabin. Against Jacob’s better judgment.

“I can handle him,” Rachel had said, her voice steadier than it had been in days. “He’s scared. That’s all. I’ll keep him inside.”

Jacob didn’t believe her. But he let them stay.

The hike took nearly an hour.

The snow was deep. Wet with melt near the surface, crusted beneath. Hard going.

The smoke thickened as they moved.

It smelled wrong.

Not like a woodstove.

Like meat.





They found the lean-to in a clearing ringed with dead trees.

Built from pine boughs and canvas tarps, half-covered in snow, smoke rising from a pit dug into the center. A small fire still smoldering — not for warmth, but to mask the smell.

The remains were just beyond it.

A deer.

Or what had been one.

Its hide had been stripped.

Its ribs cracked open like a fruit.

The meat gone.

Not butchered.

*Bitten.*

There were human footprints in the snow. Barefoot. Leading into the trees. No return tracks.

And beside them, a second set.

Longer.

Drag marks behind them like claws.

Kenny turned away and vomited in the snow.

Mara knelt beside the tracks. “Whatever made these… it wasn’t just walking.”

“No,” Jacob said. “It was *following*.”





When they returned, the cabin door was open.

No signs of a struggle. No blood.

But Rachel was gone.

Theo stood in the center of the room, staring at the ceiling. His clothes were soaked in melted snow. Barefoot. Shivering. But not afraid.

When he turned to face them, his pupils were wide. Nearly covering the whole iris.

“She left,” he said.

“Where?” Jacob snapped.

Theo just smiled.

“She heard it too.”





They found her twenty minutes later.

She was hanging from a tree branch, thirty feet up, limbs twisted backward, her body frozen like glass. No footprints below her. No sign of how she got there.

Her eyes were open.

And there was something carved into her chest.

A word.

**KISAGIWIYIW**

Mara covered her mouth.

“What does it mean?” she asked, her voice barely audible.

Theo answered without being prompted.

“It means ‘possessed by hunger’.”

Jacob stared up at her.

She didn’t look like Rachel anymore.

She looked like a warning.





They didn’t bring her down.

They didn’t have the tools. Or the time. Or the will.

Instead, they sealed the cabin again. This time with more than wood. Furniture was dragged in front of the door. Nails hammered in. Windows covered with spare blankets and aluminum foil from their rations.

They made rules.

No one goes outside alone.

No one answers voices through the walls.

No one opens the door at night.

But rules don’t help once it’s *inside*.

That night, Theo stopped responding to his name.

Jacob found him crouched by the hearth, hands burned from holding firewood too long, face blank.

“The cold is good,” he said softly. “The cold burns away what’s human. It’s *better*.”

Jacob grabbed him by the collar. “You listen to me. That thing — it *wants* us like this. You fight it. You hear me?”

But Theo didn’t fight anymore.

He just whispered.

It sounded like a name.





Mara wanted to leave the next morning.

“We’ll take the radio,” she said. “Try to hike out. We’ve got GPS. The satellite might catch.”

“It won’t,” Jacob said. “Not in this storm.”

“Then we die here.”

“We die *out there*.”

“You saw what it did to her.”

“I know.”

Mara didn’t yell. She just sat down beside him.

And started to cry.

Not loudly.

Just quiet, dry sobs that filled the cabin with something heavier than fear.





The radio crackled that night.

Just once.

A single phrase, nearly lost in static:

**“…he’s still alive…”**

Then nothing.

Kenny ran to it. Tried every channel.

Nothing answered.

Jacob looked to the window.

Snow was falling in thick, wet clumps now.

Something moved behind it.

Tall.

Loping.

Watching.





Kenny stopped sleeping.

Not in the ordinary way — not just insomnia or stress. He refused to lie down. Sat in the corner by the boarded-up window with his hunting rifle across his knees, eyes bloodshot, lips constantly moving. Whispering things Jacob didn’t try to hear.

He jumped at any noise. Creaks in the wood. Popping sap in the fire. The shifting groan of snow on the roof. All of it set his finger against the trigger.

Mara tried talking to him. Even offered him water or a blanket. He didn’t take either. Just muttered something about hearing his sister’s voice. She’d died in a house fire when he was fifteen.

“She was outside the cabin last night,” he said. “Calling for me. Asking why I didn’t save her.”

“Kenny,” Jacob said, voice low, even. “That wasn’t your sister.”

“You don’t know that.”

“I know what it wants. And I know it can’t get in unless you let it.”

Kenny’s voice dropped to a hiss. “It’s already *in*. You think we’re safe because there’s walls? It wears people like clothing. That wasn’t Rachel that walked off. That was something in her skin.”





It was Theo who disappeared next.





He was there when they went to sleep — curled in the corner, thin blanket over his shoulders, rocking back and forth slowly, whispering in a language none of them spoke.

When Mara woke for her shift at 3:30 a.m., the cabin was colder than it had been all week. The stove had gone out. Logs frozen, not burned. Like the fire hadn’t just died, but had been *smothered*.

Theo was gone.

Door still barred.

Windows intact.

He hadn’t opened anything.

He’d vanished.

No prints in the snow.

No broken boards.

No sound.

Just… *gone*.





Mara blamed herself.

“I should’ve stayed up,” she muttered. “I should’ve checked on him sooner.”

“You couldn’t have stopped it,” Jacob said.

“We keep saying that. But every time one of us goes, we say it again. And again. Until there’s no one left.”

Kenny said nothing. He was standing near the back of the room now, holding the rifle so tight Jacob could see the whites of his knuckles. He was sweating. His breath came in short, shallow huffs.

“Theo’s not gone,” he said finally.

“What?”

“I saw him out the window.”

“Kenny—”

“He was walking across the treeline. Didn’t have shoes. Or a coat. But he didn’t look cold. He turned and looked at me.”

Jacob stepped closer. “What did he look like?”

Kenny’s eyes didn’t blink.

“Wrong. He looked *wrong*.”





That night, Jacob heard scratching.

Not from the walls.

From *beneath* the floor.

He got out of his sleeping bag and pressed his ear to the boards. At first, he thought it might be a rodent, or something trapped in the crawlspace.

Then it spoke.

“Jacob,” it whispered.

His father’s voice.

Gone fifteen years.

“You should have died in the war,” the voice hissed. “You brought this thing home with you. It’s always been with you.”

Jacob stood quickly. Backed away from the floor.

The voice didn’t stop.

“You killed your own friends. You walked away. That’s why it found you.”

He grabbed the hammer from the shelf and slammed it into the floorboards.

The whisper stopped.

The wind didn’t.





Mara’s map was missing the next morning.

She had marked the perimeter. Every direction they’d scouted. Even the lean-to site where they found the burned deer.

It was gone.

So were her boots.

She didn’t say anything to Kenny. Or Jacob. She just put on extra socks and wrapped her feet in tarp strips. Then started checking the windows again.

“What are you looking for?” Jacob asked.

“Anything we haven’t seen yet.”

“What do you mean?”

She pointed to the tree line.

“There’s a pattern to it. Every time it takes someone, it leaves *something*. A trace. A sound. A sign. It’s marking us. Pushing us.”

“Toward what?”

“I think it wants us to eat each other.”





Kenny snapped the next night.

It wasn’t an outburst. There was no screaming. No breakdown.

He just quietly walked into the kitchen, found Jacob’s knife, and started carving something into the wood above the fireplace.

When Jacob came in, Kenny didn’t turn around.

“What are you doing?”

Kenny’s voice was calm. Detached.

“It’s not coming anymore,” he said. “Because it’s already in here.”

Jacob moved closer.

The word Kenny had carved was Cree.

Just like the one on Rachel’s chest.

**CÉ NITAWÊN**

Jacob didn’t need Theo to translate.

“I desire it.”





Jacob tried to take the knife.

Kenny turned and drove it into his arm.

Just a quick flash of pain, a twist of steel. But enough to drop Jacob to the floor. Blood ran hot through his sleeve.

Kenny stood over him.

“I saw it, Jake. In the trees. I saw what it *really* looks like.”

Jacob looked up, vision swaying. “What?”

“It doesn’t have eyes. It has *holes*. Where faces used to be.”

Mara tackled him before he could finish.

The rifle clattered across the floor.

The knife skittered beneath the cot.

They tied him up with paracord and threw him into the supply closet.

He screamed for nearly three hours.

And then, just like Rachel, he went quiet.





At dawn, they checked on him.

He was gone.

The cord was still knotted.

The door hadn’t opened.

No hole in the roof.

No sign of a struggle.

Just empty space and one final word etched into the closet wall:

**NINA WÎSÎMIN**

“I am hungry.”





They left the cabin on the seventh day.

There was no choice.

With Kenny gone, the map missing, and food nearly gone, the cabin had gone from sanctuary to trap. The snow hadn’t stopped falling for two full days. Even the wind sounded strange now — like breath. Like the rasp of lungs that shouldn’t work anymore.

Jacob’s wound had swollen. Infection was setting in fast.

“We need elevation,” Mara said. “The watchtower’s five klicks north. Maybe six. If it’s still standing, the antenna might work.”

“Big if.”

She looked at him, eyes sunken but steady. “You got a better plan?”

Jacob didn’t.

So they packed what they could — water, what little food remained, a road flare, their last working flashlight, the first-aid kit, and the .38 revolver.

They didn’t bother burning the cabin.

Some things don’t die in fire.





The hike was slow.

Snow came to the knees in places. Jacob’s arm throbbed with each step. Mara helped him when he staggered, and he leaned into her more than he wanted to admit.

They didn’t talk much.

Talking wasted heat. And the storm had teeth now.

No birds.

No wind.

Just the crunch of snow and the long shadow of the mountain rising ahead of them.

Twice, they stopped to check the GPS.

Once, it spun in circles, unable to find true north.

The second time, it showed a third dot — not a beacon, not a saved coordinate — just an unknown signal blinking nearby. No heading. No label.

It vanished a second later.

They didn’t speak of it.





They reached the base of the fire watchtower by nightfall.

It rose forty feet into the dark, skeletal against the storm, the metal steps coated with black ice. A single rusted ladder led up from the deck to the hatch. The trapdoor hung slightly open — rocking in the wind.

Mara went first.

Jacob followed, slipping once, catching himself with his bad arm. The pain was enough to send stars across his vision.

At the top, they crawled into the tower.

Empty.

Four cots. A rusted desk bolted to the floor. A long-dead radio bolted beside a metal storage locker. Someone had left old ranger journals, mouse-bitten and brittle. The last entry was dated 1993.

**Blizzard hasn’t let up. Tower creaks like something’s walking on the roof. No one on the radio. Used the flare. Nothing. Heard someone crying outside the tower last night. It was Lisa’s voice. Lisa’s been dead two years. I think I’m going to jump.**

Jacob closed the book slowly.

“It’s been here before,” he said.

Mara didn’t answer.

She was staring out the narrow slit of window, the flare in her hand.





The storm didn’t stop.

Lightning flickered in the distance — sharp and white and too frequent.

There was no thunder.

It was like the sky itself was being torn open over and over.

Jacob sat against the wall, breathing shallowly. His arm looked worse now. Angry red lines up the forearm, spreading toward the elbow.

“You need antibiotics,” Mara said.

“I need a priest.”

She gave him a ghost of a smile.

“I liked Rachel,” she said a while later. “She was smart. Tougher than any of us.”

“She stayed sane longer than I expected,” Jacob murmured.

Mara looked at the floor. “She didn’t crack, Jake. She *let it in*. On purpose.”

He blinked. “What?”

“She said it to me the night before. That it was cleaner than living with it. Said it didn’t hurt anymore once she stopped fighting. That hunger was a kind of peace.”

Jacob’s mouth went dry.

“She said it *remembered* her. From before.”





The flare went up around midnight.

They lit it through the narrow window, the orange-red blaze punching through the snow like blood in water. It fizzled and hissed in the wind, casting shadows in every direction.

For a moment, nothing moved.

Then, something did.

Between trees.

On two legs.

Too thin.

Too tall.

No coat.

No face.

It stopped just inside the perimeter, as if studying the light.

And then it raised one long arm and pointed directly at the tower.





It didn’t move again.

Not for hours.

Jacob watched it through the storm, vision blurring with fever, until finally he collapsed onto the cot. Mara stood guard.

He woke with her screaming.

The trapdoor was open.

Wind blasted inside.

Mara was on her back, clawing toward the revolver across the floor.

A shape hunched in the doorway.

Thin.

Gray.

Its skin looked like dried birch bark, split and stretched over bone. Its eyes were *gone*, black sockets filled with nothing but winter. Its mouth was a line that didn’t move when it *spoke*.

But speak it did.

With Rachel’s voice.

“Don’t be afraid.”

Jacob grabbed the flashlight. Clicked it on. Shoved the beam into its face.

It recoiled.

Just enough for Mara to grab the gun.

Three shots rang out.

The thing staggered. But it didn’t fall.

It vanished.

Just… *stepped backward into the dark*.





They slammed the trapdoor shut.

Barricaded it with the cot.

Neither of them said a word for a long time.

Jacob’s arm was boiling with infection. His teeth chattered. His vision kept greying around the edges.

“I think I’m going to die in this place,” he said softly.

“No,” Mara whispered.

She didn’t sound convinced.





Hours passed.

They slept in turns.

Or tried to.

At some point, the wind stopped.

Completely.

The silence was absolute.

Jacob opened his eyes and sat up.

The entire world outside was *white*. A still, dead sheet of it. Not a flake moving.

In the middle of that field stood a tree that hadn’t been there before.

A black, charred pine.

Something hung from its branches.

It was Kenny.

Mouth wide open.

Eyes gouged out.

And behind him, half-hidden in the fog, were *others*.

Dozens.

Wearing skin that looked familiar.

Faces that should be dead.





“It's a memory,” Mara said.

“What?”

“That's what it is. It doesn't hunt. It *remembers*. It keeps us.”

Jacob’s voice was faint. “Why?”

She shook her head. “Because it’s hungry.”





Jacob dreamt of the cabin.

But it wasn’t the one they’d left.

The fire burned blue.

The walls were flesh.

And standing in the middle of it — was Rachel.

Her face was the same, but too still. Her eyes didn’t blink. Her voice was a low, clicking sound that made Jacob’s skin crawl.

She held something in her hands.

It was a heart.

Beating.

His.

She whispered:

**“You don’t die here. You** ***become*****.”**





He woke to silence.

Mara was crouched at the corner of the tower, staring through the slats in the boarded window. She hadn't moved in hours. Her hands trembled slightly, one of them resting on the revolver.

Jacob tried to sit up, but his whole body ached. The fever had worsened. Sweat chilled him to the bone.

“Mara.”

She didn’t turn.

“Do you hear it?” she asked.

“Hear what?”

“Breathing.”

He held his own breath.

At first, there was nothing.

Then — he heard it.

Faint. Wet. Close.

It was coming from *beneath* the floor again.

Jacob reached for the flashlight and swept it across the room.

There were no holes. No cracks in the boards. But the breathing persisted. Steady. Patient.

As though the thing had taken up residence just under their feet, like a wolf curled under the porch.

Waiting.





“I think we have to let it in,” Mara said.

“No.”

Her voice was distant. “We can’t kill it. Bullets don’t work. Fire doesn’t hold it. It’s part of this place. Part of *us*. And it remembers.”

Jacob forced himself up, every joint screaming.

“You let it in, and you’re gone, Mara.”

“Maybe that’s not the worst thing.”

He crossed the space between them, knelt beside her, and gripped her shoulders.

“You said it yourself — it’s trying to break us. Don’t let it win.”

She looked at him with eyes rimmed red.

“There’s no ‘winning’, Jake. There’s just *what’s left* of us.”





That night, the Wendigo returned.

But this time — it didn’t knock.

It didn’t scratch.

It *spoke*.

From inside the walls.

It used voices they knew.

Rachel. Kenny. Theo. Even Mara’s father, who’d died five years ago in a house three states away.

It whispered regrets.

It spoke their memories.

It reminded them of every small betrayal. Every moment they’d chosen survival over love. Fear over trust. It didn’t need to shout.

It just *mirrored*.

Jacob wrapped his jacket tighter and tried to drown it out.

But one voice got through.

The one he hated most.

His own.

“I left them in the cabin,” the voice said, just behind his ear. “Back then. Years ago. I ran first. I always run.”





Mara didn’t sleep at all.

When the sun rose — thin and pale behind the storm — she stood and said, “We’re going to burn it.”

Jacob frowned. “The tower?”

“No. *It*.”

She reached for the flare gun.

“I’m going to find the body.”

“There *is* no body. It’s not human anymore.”

“But it was. Once. It still obeys old rules. And you know what the elders said.”

Jacob nodded slowly.

“Starve it. Bury it. Burn the bones.”





They descended the tower like fugitives.

The storm wasn’t gone — but it had thinned. Just enough to see. The air had a static charge to it now. Lightning flickered behind clouds. Not far.

They followed the footprints back to the black tree.

It was still there.

So was the thing beneath it.

The Wendigo stood half-hidden by the trunk. But it wasn’t watching them.

It was *waiting*.

Hands folded. Head tilted. Still.

Around it, in the snow, were more figures.

Faces Jacob recognized.

Rachel.

Theo.

Even the outline of his brother — who had died in the war.

But they didn’t move.

They weren’t real.

They were memory made meat.





Mara lit the flare and held it high.

The Wendigo didn’t flinch.

It *spoke*.

But not in Rachel’s voice.

Not in anyone’s voice.

It was a sound older than words. A hunger made audible. It echoed through the clearing like heat shimmer. Like the first breath of something that had never died.

Jacob stepped forward.

In his good hand, he held a bottle of isopropyl alcohol from the med kit. In the other, the old ranger’s journal — soaked and twisted into a torch.

He lit it.

And threw it at the creature’s feet.

The fire caught quickly.

It *howled*.

Not pain.

*Anger.*

The figures around it began to shriek. Their bodies burned like dry tinder. Faces melted. Skin turned to ash.

And the Wendigo collapsed — not like a man, but like a *structure* — limbs twisting backward, bones folding into themselves, skull cracking open like wet bark.

It fell into the fire.

And did not rise.





They stayed until the storm stopped.

Until the sun broke the sky.

Until the tree turned to ash.

Only then did Mara lower the flare gun.

“We need to go,” she said quietly.

Jacob nodded.

But before they turned away, he looked once more at the center of the fire.

At the pile of bones.

Clean. White. Human.

Whatever had worn them was gone.

But what it had *been*… still echoed through the woods.





They walked south for two days before the search team found them.

Mara didn’t speak on the way back.

Jacob did, but only when asked.

They were taken to a hospital. Examined. Questioned. Released under supervision.

They told the story the way it had to be told — starvation. Exposure. Hallucination.

Only once did Jacob break silence.

He asked one of the forest rangers a simple question.

“Do you ever see lights out there? Ones that don't move like planes?”

The ranger looked at him a long moment.

And didn’t answer.





Years later, Jacob sometimes dreams of a sound under the floorboards.

He wakes cold.

Always hungry.

And sometimes, he swears he can *hear* the breathing again.

In the quiet places.

The places between.





**END.**
