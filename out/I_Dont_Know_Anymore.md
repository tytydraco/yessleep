I’ve lost track of time. My watch stopped working, who knows how long ago, and without it, everything feels blurry. I’ve been stuck in this elevator forever or at least, that’s what it feels like. Days? Weeks? I can’t even tell anymore. It’s like time doesn’t exist in here. Every minute drags on in this weird, endless loop, and I’m losing my mind.

I work at a call center. For years, I’ve taken the elevator to the office without a second thought. But today, everything went wrong. I was late for work, rushing to catch the elevator like I always do. The usual one was out of service, so I had no choice but to use the old, broken one—the one that’s always been blocked off with caution tape. Today, the tape was gone. I didn’t think twice. I just wanted to get to work.

I swiped my keycard, and the elevator doors creaked open, groaning like they hadn’t moved in years. I should’ve turned back then, but I didn’t. I stepped inside.

The moment the doors shut; I knew something was wrong. The lights flickered, buzzing overhead like they were struggling to stay on. Gravity felt weird, like the air itself was pressing down on me. I glanced at my watch—it was going crazy, the hands spinning so fast they blurred.

Then, out of nowhere, the elevator dropped. It was like free-falling, like the bottom had fallen out, and I thought for sure I was going to die. But it stopped just as fast, leaving me standing there, I’m breathless and terrified. I checked my phone—it was fully charged, even though I remember it being nearly dead when I got in. Weird, right?

The elevator jerked upward, but it didn’t stop. It kept moving, up and down, over and over. Every time it went up, my watch spun faster, and when it dropped, my phone would somehow recharge to full. Even stranger, the water bottle I had? It refilled itself. The cookie in my bag? It would reappear, untouched, like I hadn’t eaten it.

The air in here is thick, heavy, like it’s slowly choking me. I am having difficulty in my breathing. And the silence. It’s not just quiet, it’s so wrong, I can hear my own heartbeat, loud in my ears, and every once in a while, there’s this metallic screech, like something dragging sharp claws against the walls.

I’ve tried everything to get out. Banging on the walls until my hands bled, screaming at the top of my lungs. But nothing works. The sound just echoes back, like the elevator is mocking me. The emergency button? It’s useless. It doesn’t even click. I’ve tried forcing the doors open with my bare hands, but they won’t budge, not even a little.

My phone? Useless. Every time I try to message someone, the signal drops, and my message disappears before I can hit send. It’s like I never typed it. But I’m still trying, still hoping someone will see this… ASDbbfdghjkuiWErrfdQasdFAoippp//.43CQWD

I hear whispers. Faint, just on the edge of hearing. They sound close, like someone’s standing right behind me, but when I turn around, there’s nothing. Nothing but me and the shadows.

And then, then, I started seeing it.

At first, it was just a feeling. That prickling sensation on the back of your neck, the hair in my nape goes up, and I got goosebumps. like you’re being watched. Then I saw them, it, I think, the long, black shadows creeping along the walls. They move slow, like they’re waiting, watching, getting closer each time the elevator jerks. It was swimming, well it looks like it. Sometimes, I swear I see hands, twisted and bony, reaching for me from the dark. I try to shake it off, Am I going crazy? I lost perception of time now, I don’t know. I know it’s real. Something is in here with me.

It’s getting harder to think, harder to stay awake. My body feels heavy, like the elevator is sucking the life out of me. My heart, it’s slowing down. I can feel it, I can hear it, this deep, aching pressure in my chest. I’m fading, becoming weaker by the second. PLEASE HELP ME! And, And, and those shadows... they’re closing in. I can see them now, sliding along the walls, fingers stretching out toward me. They want me.

I don’t know how much longer I can last. Every time I close my eyes, I hear the whispers louder, feel the shadows coming to me closer. I can’t stay here.

Please, if anyone is reading this, help me. I AM BEGGING YOU, PLEASE! Before it’s too late. Before they take me.

I can’t hold on much longer.
