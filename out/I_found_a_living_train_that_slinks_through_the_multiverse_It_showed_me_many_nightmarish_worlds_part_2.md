&#x200B;

The metal doors we had come in through slid open with a shriek of tortured metal. The pink flesh thrumming over the interior of most of the train flexed. Like a slug, the flesh crawled to the side, leaving a streak of translucent, clear mucus streaming down from the top of the walls.

“Let’s go,” Brother said, ushering us forward into the dark wasteland. The alien sky above us glowed with strange, opalescent whorls of light. They reminded me of the Northern Lights, but these came in shimmering dark red, obsidian black and glowing silver. The black streaks twisting through the beautiful radiance above us had a different look than the darkness of space. They glimmered with a glassy texture, as if rivers of melted obsidian flowed out to the horizon.

“Whoa,” Cook said, spell-bound. “Far out, man.” His mouth dropped open as he saw the beautiful effulgence writhing across the sky like a curtain in front of infinite space. Behind the twisting lights, the rings and twin moons of this strange world glowed faintly in the background. Brother pushed him forwards none too gently.

“Wait!” I cried, running over to the next train over. The machete the eyeless creature had thrown at us had clattered to the ground when the doors of the train opened. I grasped it now, feeling the sticky, dried blood on the handle. It felt revolting under my grip.

“Good thinking,” Brother said, giving me what I learned was an extremely rare thing from him- a compliment.

The ground beneath my feet looked like solid black earth, but it had a lot of give like a trampoline. At first, it made walking a bit awkward. I looked up and down the endless track. The carriages of the train extended to the horizon, disappearing with the tracks in the far off cliffs and oceans of swamps that marked this world. I saw creatures that I would have never imagined, not even in my wildest fever dreams. Even now, a few months later, when I fall asleep in my bed late at night, I catch glimpses of those eldritch beings behind my closed eyes. They crawled, skittered and glided out of the train’s doors, emerging in waves.

They were not remotely like any extraterrestrial life I had ever seen portrayed in fiction. The ones only five or six carriages down had dozens of translucent, black tentacles that writhed over the soft, spongy ground. Their bodies rose up like silver and black tree trunks to about eight feet. Their skin seemed to shiver and dance. They had dozens of boneless, slithering arms emerging from their chests. Hundreds of tiny eyes on stalks rose out of the tops of their heads like thin branches growing out of a tree. Each eye had a thick, glossy eyelid. They all blinked at different times, which gave the creature’s expression a chaotic, otherworldly appearance.

Some creatures further away looked like something from a demonic Alex Grey painting. They glowed with an inner, orange light. They had two arms and two legs and a generally human shape, but no skin or recognizable face. I could see directly into the inside of their bodies, where many thin blood vessels spun around their solar plexus in fast, circular revolutions. The narrow veins swirled together with the orange light, spiraling like a hurricane of crimson and gold.

From there, the pulsating red veins spiderwebbed out faintly, connecting to the ends of their fingers and toes. Each of these creatures seemed to have a dozen fingers and a single thumb on each hand. Their legs ended in feet like those of a rhinoceros. Their heads simply glowed with that uniform, opaque, orange light. I could see no sign of any eyes on their heads nor any place where they might possibly eat.

My attention was roughly drawn back to our present predicament by Brother grabbing me roughly by the arm and pulling me forward. I saw Cook had also stopped yet again, staring open-mouthed at the strange creatures streaming out of the living train into the Boglands.

“If you two idiots want to die, then be my guest,” Brother hissed through gritted teeth, “but if you want to live, you better start moving. First of all, most of those creatures are not your friends. Those with the many eyes are called the Stalkers, and those with the light shining from them are called the Maia. The former will kill you and bleed you dry if you get too close, while the latter might just suck your consciousness out of your skull and imprison it within their minds for all eternity.

“And, secondly, when the train begins regenerating in about thirty seconds, it’s going to start reaching out with those masses of flesh to consume anything it can grab around the tracks. Any native animal or plant life, any proteins or useful carbohydrates, it will suck up and incorporate into itself. After all, traveling through the multiverse is thirsty work, and the train is indeed a living organism- at least mostly.” His words got me and Cook moving. We sprinted into the Boglands and away from the train.

Giant, red-and-white fungal growths as tall as redwoods loomed ahead of us. They had many mouth-like holes up and down their wet, crimson surfaces. White dots in the shape of perfect circles of varying sizes ran up and down their lengths. Thousands of these growths seemed to swarm around us after we got a few hundred feet away from the train. A thick mist kept me from seeing too far into the swamplands, and that made me nervous. Brother also looked anxious, and his eyes kept flicking to the left and right. Every few seconds, he would check his back. I could tell he felt watched, as if sadistic, alien eyes were running over his body. I had the same creeping paranoia.

The Boglands smelled fungal, like a patch of mushrooms after a heavy rain. The pale cataract eyes of the twin moons gave enough light to see by, and this planet’s alien version of the Northern Lights seemed to run constantly across the sky at night.

The trails split off into dozens of smaller trails, almost like deer trails. On the sides of the black earth, the swamps bubbled and gurgled, as if they were whispering secrets. Cook was breathing heavily and kept asking to stop, grabbing his chest. Brother’s eyes seemed as cold as liquid nitrogen as he regarded the complaining man.

“You can lay down right here and die,” Brother whispered slowly, his words dripping with venom. “I don’t tolerate weakness. I haven’t lived this long to watch over a fully grown man-children.” Brother wasn’t even winded. The man seemed made of stone, unbreakable. At that moment, I wondered if his heart was also made of stone.

A terrible cacophony exploded from behind us, from the direction of the train. Cook and I jumped. I looked around like a caged animal, but Brother just emitted a sardonic chuckle, pointing through the tall mushroom-like pillars that rose all around us. I could still see part of the train through a gap in the flora.

“That is why we needed to get away,” Brother said coldly as Cook and I watched, open-mouthed and stunned. The entire train shone like a firefly, sending out strobing, blinding flickers of white light. The pink flesh all up and down had begun to shiver and vibrate. It sounded as if the entire train had started screaming in some high-pitched, alien tongue.

The flesh had turned into groping, snake-like fingers that oozed off the sides of the train and prodded lightly across the ground next to the tracks. The fingers wrapped around anything they found. I saw a small, scaly, deer-like creature burst out of the thick forest of fungal growths, scared by the sudden explosion of light and noise. But the poor creature ran directly into the groping appendage of the train, which quickly wrapped itself around the alien deer like a boa constrictor. The finger of flesh slowly drew back to the train with its panicked, kicking offering. The creature disappeared into the flesh of the train, still fighting and writhing against the powerful muscles encircling it.

“Jesus Christ,” Cook whispered, awe-struck. The train’s appendages continued prodding further out, breaking off huge chunks of the giant red-and-white mushrooms that loomed over the planet’s surface and bringing them back to the main body. Other fleshy fingers broke off piles of black, glossy ferns. A few delved down holes in the planet’s surface and came up with squirming gray lamprey-like creatures four or five feet long. “It’s just destroying everything around it. It’s like a wrecking ball.”

“How many calories a day do you think that train needs?” I asked jokingly, trying to break the tension. Cook didn’t laugh. He had started visibly trembling. I put my hand on his shoulder. “Are you going to be OK, man?” Cook nodded, but he didn’t look at me. He just continued to stare out blankly at the nightmarish train’s feeding frenzy.

“We need to get moving. We need to distance ourselves from the train- and from the passengers it brings,” Brother said dramatically, reaching into his faded jeans and pulling out a gold-plated pocket watch. He flicked it open. I saw a clock there, but it looked like it had 25 hours on it. Each of the numbers were marked in a strange language I had never seen before. They reminded me of Tibetan. “We need to make sure we’re back here in exactly eleven hours and fifty minutes. If the train leaves without us, we will be stranded and most certainly die a terrible death here in the Boglands.”

“You’re always so positive,” I said sarcastically. Brother ignored my comment.

“Is there water here?” Cook asked. “I am thirsty as hell.” He looked pale as well. But his comments brought up a good point.

“What do you do for food and water, Brother?” I asked. “Do you just leave the train and hunt for food and water every time it stops to regenerate?”

“The train gives pure water as a waste product from its feeding,” Brother said. “I would not drink the water of the Boglands. I would not drink it for all the gold in Moria.”

“Ah, shit,” Cook said, licking his dry lips. I was also fairly thirsty and disappointed to hear the waters here were likely undrinkable. “Why not? We had a few beers before all this insanity and…”

“I saw a man who drank the waters of the Boglands once,” Brother said, a distant look coming over his eyes. “He entered the train afterwards. For a few hours, he was healthy and pink, not a scrape nor a sore. And then, the parasite reached his brain.

“One of his pupils was huge, the other tiny. Blood started coming from his eyes, and he grew mad, raving and bloodthirsty. He started attacking anyone and anything he saw, like a rabid wolf, and that was when I was forced to kill him with my boomstick.” He raised his smoking alien rifle for emphasis. “It is possible that not all the streams of the Boglands are corrupted such as this, but…” His story was cut off by a wailing cacophony close by on our right, maybe a couple hundred feet away. Brother’s pale blue eyes widened and he spun, pointing his rifle in the direction of the scream.

Another shrieking cry answered it from our left, even closer than the first. Brother pointed at us, then motioned down to the trail. We nodded. He took off and we followed close behind. All around us, dark shapes blurred through the brush, circling and shrieking. I couldn’t tell how many there were.

The path opened up suddenly a few dozen feet ahead. The huge fungal growths and sharp ferns of this strange alien landscape ended. A castle loomed there. Its exterior shone a glossy black like smooth obsidian glass. It had no windows or openings except for a giant door at the front that streamed silver light across the flat, black plains.

Something snaked out through the brush and grabbed my ankle. I looked down and saw a pale, rotting hand. A woman’s corpse grinned up at me, her eyes filmy and wet, her mouth slashed wide open from ear to ear. The mutilated skin of her face hung down in strips. I screamed as I fell, landing hard on the spongy earth. I twisted around, looking back at my attacker. She slithered out of the brush behind me, forcing me down with her body weight. Her yellowed, decaying teeth gnashed the air in front of my face as her sickly body covered mine.

“Get the hell off me!” I cried, panicked. I still held the machete in my right hand as she lunged down to bite my eyes. I raised it up instinctively, stabbing her through the neck. Thick, dark red blood the consistency of maple syrup dribbled into my mouth and over my nose. I coughed, sputtering and gagging.

Brother appeared in the corner of my vision. He reached down, ripping the woman’s corpse off me with no apparent effort. With a strong, callused hand, he pulled me up off the ground, hissing in my ear.

“There are at least twenty more of them closing in on us,” he said. “Run!” He pushed me forward none too gently. I saw Cook sprinting across the field ahead of us. He looked like he was heading towards the castle. More lunging, limping corpses of the dead came out of the trees all around the castle. I knew we had no choice.

I ran towards the open door of the castle, seeing how its silver light streamed over the black plains like pale moonbeams through infinite space.

\*\*\*

As the three of us ran into the blinding glare of the castle, I dared to glance back. Dozens of corpses limped and sprinted after us, and only some were human. I saw rotting figures of what Brother had called the Stalkers, creatures with slithering tentacles and countless eyes on stalks. Except these Stalkers had horrifying gashes across their bodies that dripped blue blood. Squirming white larvae writhed and danced in their open wounds, gleefully feeding on the dead flesh below.

“They’re surrounding us!” Brother cried in alarm as we crossed the threshold. The black soil turned into shimmering, glassy stone beneath our feet. “We’re outnumbered! We should try to find somewhere to hide in here, fast.”

“What is this place?” Cook asked, gasping and out of breath. Brother just shook his head.

“We will find out,” he said. “Nowhere good, I’m sure. But perhaps we can pass the majority of the next twelve hours in this refuge. It would be easier to secure a room and force our enemies to enter one at a time than fight them in the open.” The wailing and shrieking rang out fiercely behind us as the undead followed after their escaping prey.

We entered a long, straight hallway with floating orbs along both sides of the wall. It was these many orbs that gave off such a blinding, silvery radiance that we had seen streaming out into the forest. Doorways in the shape of pointed arches opened up on both sides of us with slatted, gray metal doors.

Brother seemed to choose one at random. He turned right after sprinting through the castle’s hallways for a couple hundred feet. I looked back and saw a couple dozen of the creatures close behind us. The fastest of them was only a few paces behind us. My heart was beating like a jackhammer and I felt like I would pass out. My left arm had also started bleeding again after getting knocked to the ground and having to fight the undead woman. I winced as a sharp pang crawled up my skin, feeling the warm blood trickle slowly out of the wound. I was grateful that the eyeless monstrosity had not hit me in the right arm, however.

I cried out something cold and moist wrapped around my arm. The door was so close. I tried pulling against the creature holding me. Brother heard my cry and spun around, raising his smoking rifle.

“Down!” he cried, and I didn’t hesitate. I fell to the ground, the creature still clutching my arm with an iron grip. Brother pressed the trigger. A narrow stream of what looked like molten lava shot out of the end of the rifle, blurring through the air like a fiery spear. I looked back, seeing what had grabbed me: a Stalker with its many rotted tentacles still dancing around its body. Its chest had been cut wide open. Many small, black hearts beat there in the center of its torso. The loose flesh of its undead tentacle stayed wrapped tightly around my arm as the fiery projectile spread out over its body like napalm.

The Stalker gave a steam whistle screech that shook the ground as its rotting flesh melted off its body in suffocating, smoking rivulets. I felt its grip loosen and jumped to my feet, following behind Brother and Cook.

Brother pushed the door open, running through it without stopping. The hard metal slammed against the stone wall with a sound like a cannon firing. In front of us loomed a room filled with various torture tools hanging on the walls in cabinets hewn directly into the obsidian glass. I saw whips, saws, thumbscrews, surgical instruments, knee splitters, head crushers, breast rippers, choke pears, and other, even more insidious devices that I couldn’t properly name. In glass jars, floating in some strange, yellowish fluid, organs and heads from countless species glittered in the silvery light.

There were also chairs and beds in the room, all upholstered in some shiny red leather and embossed with a strange symbol. The symbol looked like a 3 with a long, curving tail jutting out to its right. Beyond all the torture devices and strange biological specimens loomed a staircase leading down into the darkness. No silver orbs illuminated this passage, nor did a speck of light shine out in that foul place. A sulfurous breeze blew up the steps from the hidden dungeon below, like the exhalations of some great, evil dragon.

“Help me move these chairs and beds!” Brother yelled, slamming the door shut. “We’ll barricade the door as best as we can.” Cook and I moved to action quickly. The three of us slid the largest of the couches in front of the door just as the first set of hands slammed their full weight against it. The metal door shuddered in its frame as we continued to slide more furniture in front of the door. It jumped so fiercely with the many strong blows raining down on it that I feared the hinges might rip off. Cook and I were beyond winded and tired from our recent exertions. We were not used to running for our lives and sliding heavy furniture around on a regular basis.

Cook bent over, shaking and anxious. I went next to him.

“What’s up, man? How are you doing?” I whispered.

“I need a drink, man,” he complained.

“We’ll get you some water when…”

“No, I need a drink,” Cook exclaimed insistently. “I’m going to go into full-blown withdrawals soon. I’ve been drinking… a little too much lately, I think.” His eyes started to water as a single tear ran down his cheek. Brother heard the conversation and walked calmly over, regarding Cook with his colorless, stony gaze.

“That part of your life is over,” Brother said coldly. “If you get back to the squalid hole you call home, then you can drink yourself to death. But if you’re here with us, you will fight and struggle, or I will leave you behind here to die. Weakness is death in these lands, and you seem to be overflowing with it, my friend.” Cook’s fists clenched at the unexpected insult.

“Fuck you, buddy,” Cook spat. “What do you know about me? You don’t understand anything I’ve gone through.”

“I’ve encountered many like you before, and they are all the same,” Brother said coldly. “They have let their demons convince their minds they are weak and small, and so they become weak and small, and fade into nothingness and death. Do not let your demons conquer you. You should use them to your advantage, not let them kill you. But if you wish to disappear from this world, then do not burden us with your sickness as you do so. Go find a hole, crawl into it, and die in peace. Or you can fight like a man, and overcome that which destroys you.”

The blows continued to rain down on the door as Brother offered his cold words of wisdom. The dark passage descending into the shadows stared up at us like the empty sockets of a grinning skull, revealing nothing of the mysteries beneath.

\*\*\*

Brother sat down and pulled out a flask of water and some dried meat from his pack. He passed the meager meal around. Cook drank greedily before passing the water to me. I took a long, satisfying sip. It had a strange, slightly soapy aftertaste, but otherwise seemed fine. I wondered if this was the water from the train. A sense of revulsion passed through me as I realized I was probably drinking the train’s discharge from its prior meals.

The meat Brother offered was not any animal I had ever heard of. Brother said it was a “kalipare,” a type of flying reptile the size of a large chicken who regularly got caught on the train when it stopped in whatever world the kalipares came from.

“They feed on the flesh of the train and drink its water,” he explained, “and they reproduce quickly, almost like insects. If you leave them alone for a few days in a train, you’ll open the door and find hundreds of the things crawling over the walls. They are vicious with very sharp teeth, not at all friendly. They will swarm you like hornets if you let them. But their meat is very tender and soft. I try to shoot them and smoke the meat whenever I have a chance. At times, I have lived on kalipare meat and water for months straight.”

I looked down at the gray meat. It was, indeed, very tender; in fact, it was falling right off the thin, twig-like bones. Brother continued to glance at the shuddering door, but it held firm. It sounded like an army was gathered on the other side by this point, however. We heard hundreds of gurgling voices hissing in many strange and alien tongues. The smell of rotting bodies flitted through the cracks of the door and filled up the room like a fetid cloud.

“Help…” a voice echoed up from the dark passageway at the other side of the room, faint and distant. “Please, help me… Is someone there? I hear voices. Please, God, if someone is there…” The voice devolved into sobs and pained gasping. I looked over at Brother who continued calmly eating the last of his kalipare, stripping the tender gray meat off the bone. He threw the bones to the side of the room and stood up calmly. He gathered his pack and grabbed his rifle. Heaving a deep sigh, he looked at me and Cook.

“There’s someone down there,” Cook said, his face pale. Brother nodded grimly.

“Yes, I also have ears,” Brother responded sarcastically. “It may be another of your kind. They do speak your language, after all.”

“Well, so do you, but you’re not from our Earth,” I said. Brother nodded.

“I speak thirteen different languages, and a few dozen more I know pieces of. I have traveled long. I have had time to listen… and learn. The train has stopped at Market Street in your world for over a hundred years now. Always at night, of course. We have had many English speakers who crossed the threshold of worlds at 3:33 AM.”

“This might be a trap, though. That’s all I meant,” I said, meeting Brother’s gaze. I noticed how silent everything had become, and then I realized the pounding at the door had stopped. For some reason, that only increased my creeping sense of disquiet. I wondered how much time had passed. I wanted to just get back on the train and relax, but that still seemed like an eternity away.

“Everything on these worlds is a trap, son,” Brother hissed, his aristocratic features forming into a scowl. “You should be prepared to meet death at any moment. Death is not your enemy, but a friend. It is nature’s final painkiller, after all, after everything has grown old and gray.” He motioned for me and Cook to follow him. “Grab any weapons you wish from the walls. You will both need them, and soon, if I had to guess.”

Cook and I went over to the stone cabinets, hewn directly into the rock without doors or latches. I still had the wicked, blood-stained machete from the eyeless creature, but I also found a small, sheathed dagger with a spiral pattern on the handle. The color of the metal blade was so light that it seemed to glow white.

“This doesn’t look like any metal from Earth,” I whispered to Cook, gazing at the embossed script across the dagger. It was a language I had seen on the Eldritch Tram, an elegant, curving script that reminded me of the Black Speech from Mordor. Cook glanced over at the dagger with interest.

“What should I grab?” he asked, sounding like a kid in a toy store. His eyes gleamed as he looked as the various weapons and torture instruments. Whips with sharp barbs of metal at the tips grabbed his attention for a few moments. Cat-o-nine-tails glittered next to blood-stained chainwhips and bullwhips.

“Ahh, this one…” He reached out his hand and took a beautiful, two-foot-long war hammer off the wall. It shone a silvery-white with a roaring dragon engraved into the handle. On the head of the hammer, I saw that strange symbol again, the 3 with a curving tail attached to the bottom half of the number. Cook also grabbed a small, sheathed dagger hanging from the doorless cabinet. He slipped it in his pocket, and then we were ready.

“I’ll go in the lead,” Brother said, starting off with a confident stride toward the dark passageway. “Stay close behind me and watch our backs. We don’t know what kind of foul evil or ancient traps await us below.”

\*\*\*

Steep obsidian stairs led down into the darkness. Cook pulled a lighter out of his pocket, flicking it and illuminating the steps in front of us. Brother used the smoking, volcanic hole at the end of his rifle to help us see. There wasn’t a single window in the entire castle, so when the orbs that provided light ceased, the place became as dark as an underground cave.

“Smells like dead bodies,” Cook muttered in a tone dripping with revulsion. I noticed it too every time a slight breeze blew up the stairwell. It smelled sweet and infectious, like a giant, open sore crawling with maggots. The voice had gone silent again, and now I couldn’t even hear breathing coming from below.

The black stairwell ended in a dungeon filled with prisoners, most of them dead. In the corner, slatted metal cages held three of the glowing, alien Maia. Their orange light gave the entire room a dull, flickering glow. Bodies of many strange species lay on tables, sliced open and dissected.

In the corner, I saw a filthy, olive-skinned man chained to the obsidian wall. His long, dirty black hair had grown over his face, and a thick beard jutted down to his chest. He was unconscious, slumped and drooling. I noticed he had on a Johnny Cash shirt. More disturbingly, his right arm was missing from his body. The stump jutted out from his torso, cauterized and scarred. The arm lay on a table in front of him, severed and naked, the fingers spasming as the hand clenched and unclenched into a fist. I gasped, pointing.

“That… that arm!” I sputtered. Brother glanced at it, then his eyes widened. We looked around, seeing other dismembered limbs shuddering on other tables.

“Oh no,” Brother whispered, a tone of horror creeping over his voice. His stone mask of calmness cracked for a fundamental moment, and I glimpsed the broken, terrified man underneath. “Someone has been using these souls and their bodies for the art of necromancy. A most powerful black magic…” The chained man’s eyes started to flutter. He raised his head, glancing from me to Brother to Cook in confusion.

“You’re not…” he gurgled in a dry, reedy voice, coughing. It sounded like he had been gargling with lye. “You’re not the evil one. What… what are you doing here? Have you come to save me?” Brother raised an eyebrow, drawing closer as Cook and I kept watch the myriad other forms across the dungeon. The caged Maia watched us silently, giving off the slightest smell of ozone as the light within their translucent bodies spun and danced. I felt drawn to them, as if that light were whispering in my ear to come closer. I blinked, pushing these intrusive thoughts away. I made a point not to look directly at the Maia again.

“Who is keeping you prisoner here, friend? Are you a criminal or a murderer?” Brother asked. The man laughed, showing his broken, dirty teeth. He gave a grim smile.

“Aren’t we all murderers here? But no… I am no criminal. I am a prisoner of the Necromancer, the spinner of death. We are all his… experiments,” the man said. Brother nodded, seeming satisfied. He took the rifle and put its end up to the chain. He pulled the trigger, sending out a blast of fiery red lava. After a few seconds, the steel started to melt and drip. Brother yanked on the molten chain and the link ripped apart.

“I’m Cook,” Cook said, “and this is Brother and Justin.”

“I’m Jeremiah… and I’ve been stuck here for six months,” Jeremiah said, coughing up a wad of phlegm and spitting it on the floor. He looked thin and weak, his cheekbones prominent and his eyes deeply sunken. Brother broke his other chains and began helping him up. Cook started suddenly, his finger flying up and his eyes widening.

“Holy shit, Jeremiah? Jeremiah Matheson?” Cook asked. Jeremiah looked up quickly, his dark eyes widening in surprise.

“How the hell do you know who I am?” Jeremiah asked in a weak voice.

“I heard about the Eldritch Tram from your friend, Kyle! Everyone back home thinks you’re dead!” Cook responded. I remembered Cook telling me how two people had found the Eldritch Tram and that only one had returned, insane and rambling. He had told me the other person had died. But apparently, he had been wrong.

“This is insane. What are the chances that we would find a survivor from Earth out here?” I asked. Jeremiah shook his head.

“Better than you might think,” he said. “The Necromancer is powerful. He might have captured you and brought you down here regardless. But then, you would be in chains with me, not my rescuers.” He gave a bitter smile at this. Brother took out his pocket watch, checking the time.

“The train will finish regenerating in about three hours,” he stated robotically. “I think it is time we start making our way back through the forest.” We gathered our things, and Cook and I helped Jeremiah walk up the stairs.

The silence seemed deafening. We started to slide away the furniture blocking the door when an explosion rocked the room. Torture devices clattered to the floor with harsh bangs. A blinding purple light shot through the door like a cannonball. The metal door shattered like glass. The furniture caught on fire and erupted into violet flames and choking black smoke.

A figure loomed there beyond the destruction, a shadow in the shape of a man. Bright whorls of fire spun through his tenebrous limbs. The shadows forming his skin shivered and rippled. His head looked like a black cloud with three sharp, protruding spikes on the top.

“Oh God, help us,” Jeremiah whispered, his tanned skin growing pale as he began to tremble. His back hunched, and at that moment, he looked like a truly broken man. “It’s the Necromancer.”

\*\*\*

Brother fired his gun, sending out a fiery spray of molten lava that pierced the dark shadow like an arrow. The Necromancer gave a reptilian roar, a blending of many shrieking voices together in a cacophonous scream. He pulled back, the shadowy silhouette disappearing from view.

In its place, dozens of undead streamed in, limping and writhing their way through the shattered door and past the smoking ruins of furniture. Cook and I raised our weapons, but my courage nearly failed then. I wanted to turn and run. The first attacker rushed me so suddenly, though, that I didn’t even have time to think about it. It was a human female with a torn-out throat. It looked like a pack of wolves had gotten to her, though, in reality, it was likely something worse. She gurgled and spat blood as she ran at me in a blur, her eyes rolling back in her head.

I swung the machete as hard as I could towards the massive wound in her neck. She sprinted right into my swing, and the sharp blade did its work quickly, decapitating her. I watched her head fly across the room. Her body stumbled towards me, falling and sliding as blood spurted from the stump of her neck.

Brother kept aiming for those rushing in the doorway. I realized he was trying to create a bottleneck of corpses so as to keep them coming in one at a time. His weapon didn’t seem to run out of ammo, so it seemed like it might work.

Cook was fighting with a Stalker that had wrapped its rotted tentacle around his leg. I watched the heavy war hammer smash into the Stalker’s many eyes, crushing its skull with a sound like a ceramic pot shattering. Jeremiah hung behind us, weak and stumbling, still clutching his mutilated arm. He looked like he might collapse at any moment.

Brother’s plan didn’t work, however. Too many corpses kept flooding into the room, pushing us back further and further. We were surrounded on all sides. I saw the black, rippling silhouette of the Necromancer as he walked in triumphantly.

“You will all die for your insolence,” he cried in a voice like shadows. “Kill them! Do not stop until they are all ripped to pieces.”
