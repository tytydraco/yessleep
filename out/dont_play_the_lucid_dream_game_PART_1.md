I am a male 20 years old (15 in this) and I have been lucid dreaming since I was 8 and I also had a freind who could lucid dream we had discussions about the lucid dreams he had; 1 time he talked about 1 of his scary lucid dreams where he kept on getting chased by a man with long brown hair and very light skin with a grin, we thought nothing of it. 

The next night I was doing WILD technique and I entered the lucid dream I was flying around in new york and I saw the thing my freind was talking about I went over to it, it didn't smile it only stared in front of it I asked him who are you he then grinned and said the dream guard I sayed is there any cool lucid dream stuff do to he said the hallway game and he said you need 2 dreamers to play. I woke up and I thought nothing of it.

The next day at school I told him about the man and then he told me we had the same thing happend to us we discussed and we decided if we wanted to try it out as a joke or a fun thing not knowing how traumatising it would be.

When I got home I texted my freind if his down to do it and what time he said 9pm we both agreed, I went to bed and woke up in a forest at dark and I saw next to me my freind and we talked not knowing if it was really him or just a dream representation of him. Suddenly we saw a dark red portal between two trees and the man we both saw come out he was freindly and he walked us to his mega mansion in a field outside the forest. He got us in side then he told us the game it was walk through the hallway and the things you will have are a coat and a torch when he gets dark during the first half of the game he gave us set of rules which were.

1: If you hear footsteps keep walking.

1A: If its dark don't look behind you.

2: Stay together.

3: do not enter doors with red handles.

then he gave us a bonus tip of you won't die due to the cold and the heat the coat will be usefull for when it gets uncomfatably cold then he dissapeared.

Me and my freind started walking were were chatting about what we think the game about we weren't scared but were ready for stuff to happen. The first signifacant room was a kitchen but had red stains only describable as blood it stank of rotten meat. There we other rooms like a cellar, dining room and a library nothing stood out like the kitchen.

We went into a hallway we started footsteps we looked at eachother my freind ran I ran behind him then the footsteps stopped we looked at eachother we were out of breath I tried to stop it but I couldn't I wanted to wake up but I couldn't but my freind was saying c'mon its only a dream I obliged.

We kept on doing it we had the footsteps 2 more times nothing major then we got into a kitchen the door we came through dissapeared the only door was the freezer door I said we should put our coats on incase and we went in it was a normall freezer the man appeared again only to say well done you made it through the first 4 hours I looked at the clock in the kitchen it was 1AM so I didn't feel motivated and I said calmly but aggressivily what if we don't do it freak to the man he look angry and looked at me with red eyes I felt vulnerable, weak and very hot that felt it could melt me he said if I don't make it I would die in my sleep and he dissapeared I fell down on the ground it was cold again and I felt weak but I kept going through the fear.

The footsteps started to come back I ran with my freind who was behind and it suddenly went as warm as it was like with the man and I was sweating I was running out of breath it lasted for 3 minutes which felt like 10 minutes and it stopped I felt so tired but if I didn't make it I would die, the experience so far wasn't horrifying just mentally draining. I kept on walking it went dark and the room got cold as well I put on my coat with my freind with the torch shining at me I put on the coat and I did the same with my freind when my freind put the coat on I saw shadows in the corner of the torches lights I flinched but my freind insisted its probabally my mind and we kept on walking through the darkness nothing happend we just kept on seeing the shadows in the dark.

The darkness went away there was still heat but there was a old broken door and we looked inside it was the same but everything was broken, moldy and old...
