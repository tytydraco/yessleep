Like many people I've checked out the deep web from time to time. Some of the shit I've found still haunts me to this day. But one day I found an AI image generation program, but whose name I won't say for reasons I'll get into.

&#x200B;

I'd dick around with it like anyone else would. But what was crazy was just how advanced this program was. None of the warped, alien-looking text or extra fingers you'd usually see in such situations. I would ask it to generate everything from the inside of my sock drawer to where an item I've lost ended up. It'd show me literally everything in my sock drawer and when I asked where the Airpods I got for my birthday last year ended up, it generated an image of a lost and found box at the bowling alley I went a few months ago for a party with some of my friends. And sure enough, my Airpods were still in there!

At some point, I got sick of conjuring up realistic pornographic images of my favorite celebrities and began using it to see how far its capabilities went. I asked it to show me images of dreams I've had, and each time I'd get images from dreams I still remember (like the one where I'm getting fucked by Gaston at Disney World) and even dreams I've completely forgot about (like the recurring dream I used to have of being chased by wolves in the locker room at my old middle school, except it's a never-ending maze). I asked it what happened to people I went to school with that I've lost touch with and after double checking on Google and social media, every image turned out to be true!

I know what you're thinking and I asked it what would happen if I won the lottery. I figure if this thing can generate images of the future as well as the past, present and so on, I'd rather see if I should ask it for the winning Power Ball numbers. I'm not sure how such a thing would happen, but it showed me dead in an alley with a vaguely Thai-language sign in the background.

&#x200B;

And finally, I asked it to show me something I dared not ask it.

&#x200B;

"What am I doing five seconds before I die?"

The image popped up and I couldn't believe it! But without any indication of date or time, and given the nature of the image, it seemed avoidable. But not forever. I was too freaked out so I deleted the program. Unfortunately this caused a crazy-ass virus to fuck up my computer. I hurry to shut off the surge protector and that was the end of my computer. The computer I not only spend hundreds to build from scratch, but the one I used for my job. The computer that my more-of-a-tech-wiz-than-me friend couldn't save. I told him everything and he told me that it was the DUMBEST thing I could ever do. I tried to tell him that I had damn near every anti-virus software on my computer but he said that the whole thing was basically fucked. Even if I could salvage what I could I'd end up blowing through a good chunk of my savings to fix it. Thankfully all the important shit was up in the cloud. And thankfully the images I generated, featuring nearly every male celebrity you can think of in various states of undress, weren't backed up. God knows what would happen if such images got out there.

Thankfully I had my backup laptop, which was for travel and power outages. I began to do some research on the program and only found a poorly translated blog that the program was created by an occult researcher who was applying AI image generation research to a host of various occult and scientific ideas that just went over my head. I think it worked by using the AI to scan images from various parts of the multiverse (God, not that tired-ass trope) and combined with with mystical energies. The idea was to "synergize magic with the physical and metaphysical sciences" or something.

&#x200B;

So that's it. This little Midjourney knockoff was literally some multiversal magic trick. And one part of the page said something I didn't notice. Apparently there's a deep cost for using the program. And I'd discover that cost a week later when they discovered a malignant tumor in my brain. And so now, I'm posting this knowing that my time is almost off. Knowing that if you find a AI image generator to make sure you know what you're getting into. Knowing that five seconds after I post this, I'll be dead.

&#x200B;

You see, the image I saw was of me. Dead on the floor with my laptop on its side. It's cracked screen showing a Reddit post. A Reddit post titled:

>I found a Midjourney knockoff on the Deep Web that can predict the future. When I asked how I'll die, it terrified me.
