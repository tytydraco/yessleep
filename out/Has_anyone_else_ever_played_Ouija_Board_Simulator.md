About a month ago, I downloaded a game called Ouija Board Simulator from the Steam store, and weird things have been happening ever since.

I only played it twice— once with my girlfriend, and once on my own. It has completely disappeared from my computer, it’s no longer listed on any digital storefront, and I can’t find any evidence of it ever existing online.

I’ve always been extremely superstitious about Ouija boards specifically. I was raised catholic, so anything concerning the occult has always unnerved me.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not some Bible thumper who thinks that playing with a Ouija board is a one-way ticket to demonic possession or eternal damnation or anything crazy like that… I’ve just always held the belief that there’s a lot about the universe we don’t understand, and it’s not worth knocking on any door that might have something malicious on the other side.

My girlfriend doesn’t have any of that baggage, and every time “spooky season” comes around, she asks if I’ll do the Ouija board with her. She teased me the first time I told her why I didn’t want to, and it’s become a yearly tradition for her to ask me again ever since.

She was never pushy or pried too much about it, and she always respected my wishes that if she was gonna play around with that kinda stuff, she didn’t do it in our apartment.

So yeah, I was just browsing the Steam store looking for cheap horror games to play this year, when I came across Ouija Board Simulator.

The game was only $6.66. I thought that was a cute touch, and the screenshots looked pretty cool. I figured this would be a fun middle ground for my girlfriend and I— an opportunity to share an experience with her that I wouldn’t otherwise participate in, with a degree of separation that I would be comfortable with.

I bought the game and surprised her with it after work that night.

The game itself was honestly pretty neat. It had a sort of low-poly N64 game aesthetic. To call it a “game” is a bit of a stretch actually. Like the name implied, it was a pretty straightforward simulation.

Upon booting it up, we were met with a very simple sight. It was first person, with a pair of polygonal forearms stretching out into view, resting on a circular table with a rectangular Ouija board texture in the middle of it.

We could look around by moving the mouse, but the room around the table was so dark that we could barely even make out the corners of it. It was really hard to see, but we could tell by the look of the walls and a counter in the background that we were in a small kitchen.

A stumpy red candle sat ahead of the Ouija board, illuminating the scene before us in a dim orange glow.

An NPC sat across the table from us. It was a super basic model, no facial features or clothing textures. Like a 3-dimensional stick figure with blocky proportions. 

After a few seconds, it held out its hands, and placed a little triangle with a hole in it on the middle of the board. My girlfriend told me it was called a planchette.

A prompt appeared onscreen:

WASD: Left hand

⬆️⬇️⬅️➡️: Right hand

My girlfriend hasn’t played many computer games, so I offered to man the keyboard while she used the mouse to look around. I got a feel for using the keys as the NPC placed its hands on the little planchette.

I moved our hands to it as well, and a little animation kicked in which placed our character’s hands on the other end of the planchette. 

My girlfriend instructed me to move the thing around in a circle three times, which I did, and a new prompt popped up on screen:

Ask a Question.

We looked at each other, confused.

I tried typing “Hello” on the keyboard, but nothing happened. Tried moving our character’s arms around, but the planchette just snapped right back to the center of the board, our index and pointer fingers still attached to it

“Can you hear us?”

My girlfriend’s voice made me jump out of my chair. I wasn’t expecting it, and though my microphone had been on the whole time, I hadn’t even considered it would work that way.

Sure enough, the digital planchette started to glide across the board

Both our hands and those of the NPC were still glued to it, but I hadn’t pressed any keys to move it. The little circle hovered over the word “YES”

My girlfriend and I shared a nervous giggle.

“Are there any spirits here?” she asked, a slight trepidation in her voice.

The planchette slid to the center of the board, then right back onto “YES”

A chill rushed down my spine. I immediately felt silly about it.

My girlfriend nudged me

“Go ahead, ask it something.”

Getting put on the spot like that made my fear melt away a bit. Briefly, I saw the situation for what it was— my girlfriend and I huddled together over the monitor in our office with the lights off, like a couple of middle schoolers discovering Silent Hill for the first time.

“How are you doing today?” I asked.

The game thought for a second, then the planchette started sliding across the letters on the board, stopping briefly at a few of them to spell out:

S
P
L
E
N
D
I
D

Another chill down my spine. I guess I didn’t expect something so formal.

“Well that’s good,” I said. An urge to break the tension bubbled up from my gut.

“You come here often?”

The planchette whipped over to “YES”

I’m not ashamed to say my heart started racing. I mean the whole point of playing was to get scared. I watch a good amount of horror movies. I’m no lightweight. But yeah, I was starting to wig out a bit.

There was no sound coming from the game. No sound of the wind, no ambient music, nothing. Just the low hum of my PC and the heart beating out of my chest.

“Do you wanna be done?” I asked my girlfriend.

She nodded at the screen, and I saw the planchette slide over to “NO”

She was having a laugh at the whole thing, and I know I probably should have been too, but I was just getting more and more scared by the minute.

“Keep going,” she prodded.

I racked my brain for anything else to say

“When did you pass away?” I asked

I
L
I
V
E

The flame of our digital candle flickered. My girlfriend made us look around, only to find the dark corners empty still. I saw the NPC shift in its chair as soon as she moved our gaze away from it. I could’ve sworn I felt a breeze in the room.

The fans on my computer started to whir louder. I immediately thought it was odd. I don’t have the best rig known to man, but it certainly should’ve been able to run a game that looked this primitive no problem.

The download size was relatively small, so unless this thing was taking an insane amount of processing power to field our questions, I really couldn’t see how it would cause anything to overheat.

“How are you answering our questions?” I asked

The planchette danced around the board:

P
A
R
D
O
N

“I mean, are you AI? Do you have a finite number of responses?”

Again, the planchette spelled:

I
L
I
V
E

I was shitting bricks, but playing it off pretty well. At least I was, until I asked the question that I wish I never had.

“What’s your name?”

The planchette started to move around once more, spelling out the last straw:

D
A
V
I
D

And with that, our digital candle went out. We could still see the Ouija board in front of us, just barely. In its absence, artificial moonlight revealed a window on one of the walls. The NPC was trembling ferociously.

“Oooookay,” I said as I nonchalantly closed out of the game. My girlfriend burst out laughing.

“Oh my god, you were actually scared!” she giggled.

“Yeah, I guess I was”

“How did it know your name? That’s so creepy.”

Good fucking question.

“My Steam profile probably. Or maybe this thing is spyware and it pulled it off of my fucking tax receipts or something.”

The mood lightened up and we shared a laugh.

“You sure you don’t wanna boot it back up?” she asked, “You’re supposed to say goodbye.”

I yawned and stretched and checked my phone.

“Yeah, I’m good.”

That night, I dreamt of the game.

I was sitting in the kitchen, at the table with the Ouija board, but with no NPC sitting on the other end. I noticed the candle was on my side. I was in its seat.

My surroundings didn’t exactly look real, but they didn’t look like the graphics of the game either. There was a sort of blurry sheen on everything around me, sorta like the aliasing you see around the edges of low resolution textures.

Even so, I was able to make out my surroundings a lot better than before. The floor beneath my feet was a black and white checkered ceramic tile. Through the small window, leafless branches stretched into the night. The chair I was sitting in matched the table, both made of finely finished wood with little floral designs etched into the edges.

The walls and corners were still pretty hard to make out. The details were blurry, but in the shadows I saw shapes that formed out cabinets, a stove and fridge, and so on. Everything looked old. Like a kitchen from the 60s or 70s.

Most importantly, now that I was physically in the space, able to see things a bit more clearly, I picked up on something that we didn’t notice while playing the game. The layout was identical to our kitchen in real life.

I looked down at the Ouija board. No planchette in sight.

I tried to leave my seat, but I could not stand.

I felt a pair of eyes on me, and when I looked back into the far corner of the room, I saw a tall silhouette that hadn’t been there a second earlier.

It spoke to me, its voice crunched and compressed like it was coming through the dying speakers on those crappy old LCD games you’d get in Happy Meals as a kid.

I don’t remember what it said, but it sounded really excited.

I woke up in the middle of the night, drenched in sweat. My girlfriend slept soundly next to me. I laid back down, and didn’t think about it until days later.

After about a week, I started to notice weird stuff happening around the apartment.

Little things at first. Slight chills, doors randomly opening and closing. I’d swear I put a plate in the dishwasher just to find it right back on the counter an hour later.

At first I thought I was just imagining things, but when I came home one day to find our front door standing completely open, I couldn’t ignore it any more.

My girlfriend went to a bar with some friends that night, and I booted up the game again while she was gone. 

It was exactly how I had left it for the most part, though the NPC was nowhere to be found.

The planchette sat in the middle of the board. I guided my character’s hand to it, moved it to the “Hello” position, and took my hands fully off the keyboard. 

I sat there for a few minutes, beads of sweat forming on my forehead while the pixels burned into my eyes.

Nothing happened.

I tried rebooting the game, and was met with an error message.

I scoffed. Was I seriously losing sleep over some shovelware that can’t even boot up properly?

I started to feel really stupid. I told myself I was imagining things, letting some stupid bullshit get the better of my nerves. I almost uninstalled the game, but thought even that would be an admission of mental defeat. I just turned the computer off, and left the office.

Things got significantly worse after that.

For starters, I had another dream where I was in the game that night.

I woke up at that kitchen table, the room around me still blurry.

I tried to scream but couldn’t get a sound out.

All of a sudden, I felt a stabbing pain on one of my calves, and looked down to see a featureless figure crouched beneath the table.

I would’ve leapt out of my seat if I wasn’t glued to it. Its empty face shot up to look back at me, the fuzzy outline of its humanoid head dancing in the false moonlight.

I screamed myself awake. My girlfriend barely stirred in her sleep as I hobbled to the bathroom.

Sweat stung the fresh cut on my leg. It was thin and almost a foot long, trailing up my calf like someone had scraped the skin off with their fingernail.

I got home the next night to find that my apartment was completely out of power. I tried flipping the breakers, no way to get it back on. I called the DWP, and they said they wouldn’t be able to send a technician out until the next day.

I pleaded with the guy on the phone, but there was nothing they could do, and the sun was starting to set.

I decided to get a hotel room nearby, and went about packing my things.

The apartment had already been giving off so much creepy energy, and it got even worse as I frantically packed my go bag by flashlight.

I got all of my clothes and toiletries together, then went into the office to grab a phone charger, and found my computer still running.

At that point, I had to tell my girlfriend what I thought was happening.

She just about laughed me out of the room when I did. She asked if I was making the power outage up, and if that’s why we were staying at a hotel.

I insisted that I was being genuine, and her demeanor became incredibly somber. She told me that she didn’t feel anything odd about our place, which I thought was completely unfair, because she had barely even been home in the past month.

Our talk became a fight, and she left to sleep at home that night.

I begged her not to. I thought about camping in my car outside the building to make sure she would be ok, but being away from that apartment was my first chance to get a good night’s sleep in over a week. It’s not like I can afford to be spending every night in a hotel, so I decided to take the opportunity while I had it.

I didn’t end up sleeping much anyway. My mind just kept racing. The more I thought about it, the more it didn’t add up that the game used my name like that. I mean it could’ve easily been a coincidence. David is a pretty common name, and also a biblical one. 

And everyone calls me Dave. Even my Steam account is under Dave, not David. We had played the game on a pc that I usually only ever use for gaming, and after scrubbing through all of my locally saved files, I couldn’t find a single document or anything that had my name on it as David.

The city got someone out to inspect our apartment the day after that. Service guy said there must’ve been a mistake, because there wasn’t any sign of the breakers getting shorted or anything. It appeared to be an intentional shutoff. He apologized, and they’d get our service back on asap.

My girlfriend and I got power back later that night, but our relationship hasn’t been the same since.

She just won’t believe me. Straight up, no matter how much I try to tell her, show her videos of evidence and appeal to her emotions, she won’t even entertain the idea.

I broke down in tears many times trying to plead with her, and every night I slept out on the couch surrounded by shadows.

I haven’t had another dream about the game, but as I said at the start of this post, Ouija Board Simulator has completely vanished.

I plugged my computer back in after a particularly bad day about a week ago. I had yanked the cord out of the wall before leaving the hotel, and hadn’t stepped foot back into the office since.

I honestly don’t fully know what my intentions were, if I was going to play it again to try to find some answers, or just uninstall it once and for all, but either way, when I went to my games folder, it was gone.

I checked my download history, my Steam library, no sign of the game anywhere. I tried calling Steam’s customer service, but they were no help at all. I’ve searched the internet high and low, but every Ouija or witch board game I’ve found has been different from the one I played.

I don’t remember the name of the developer or publisher from when I first bought it, and when I checked my credit card history, there wasn’t even a charge for it.

I know how corny this sounds, but it’s like the game never even existed.

The weirdest part, the part that genuinely broke me, is that my girlfriend won’t acknowledge the game either.

When I brought up Ouija Board Simulator that night in the hotel room, she looked at me like I was crazy. At first I thought she was in denial or something, but the more I prodded her about the game specifically, the more she insisted that she had no idea what I was talking about.

That’s truly why the fights got so bad. Not only because she wouldn’t believe that our place was haunted, but because she became outright hostile whenever I even mentioned what caused it.

I moved out of our apartment today. I don’t know if we’re officially broken up, but she definitely doesn’t seem interested in talking to me whatsoever. I’m surprised I even got her to agree to be there while I moved my stuff out.

She barely said a word as I went about dismantling our home, stripping away all of the belongings to my name that I felt comfortable leaving her without.

I tried to talk to her a couple times, but it fell on deaf ears. She shut herself up in the bedroom while I packed everything up, and only ever came out when it was finally time for me to leave. Even then, she only spoke to me after I refused to give her the keys until she did.

I’ll never forget what she said to me, and not because of how devastatingly brief and cruel it was. Not because after almost a decade of love and loyalty, she sent me out the door with little more than a few heartbreaking sentences. Not because her last words to me were used to call me crazy, or because as harsh as those words were, the look in her eyes betrayed them.

I’ll never forget it, because in the entire time that I’ve known her, it was the first time she ever called me by my full name. It was the first time she ever called me David.
