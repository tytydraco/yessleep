Two years ago, I lost my son Jason! And the event has continued to perplex and frighten me. So let me tell you what happened all those years ago!  
  
Hello, my name is Chuck, and my son Jason, live in a cabin out in the Washington forestland by a lake! Ever since his mother Janet disappeared six years ago on one stormy night Jason, once a charismatic young boy, was now quiet and kept to himself. But there was one thing that would cheer him up! Camping in the surrounding woodlands.  
  
We often go on the day of his mother's disappearance! I would often do this to keep his mind off the sorrow this date brings! God, I missed how we used to play hide and go seek.   
  
Now for the first two camping trips the weather was beautiful. But that all changed on the third one! Because that morning when I woke up. I heard the rain outside lightly pouring! I was about to cancel the camping trip! But I saw Jason in our cabin's living room wearing his backpack and smiling!  
  
I didn’t want to crush his spirits so I thought a little drizzle couldn’t hurt anyone.   
  
In retrospect I should have canceled that trip!   
  
Because the moment we exited the cabin I felt an uneasy feeling! It was unusual. I've never felt this way before. That should have been a red flag! But i just thought that it’s because I didn’t like being wet, so I ignored it.   
  
As we were hiking down the trail deeper into the forest the feeling amplified and the rain intensified! It was almost making me nauseous! We should have hiked back home,   
  
maybe we would have been safer there!  
  
But I didn't want to make my son any more miserable than he was at the time! So, I foolishly held back my concern! When we finally found a spot to set up camp. I pitched the tent while my son stared off into the distance!   
  
I didn’t know why at the time, so I said to him “Jason what are you staring at?”  
  
My son did not answer, he just stared! I walked over to him and asked again “what are you staring at Jason?”  
  
Jason turned around and said to me happily “dad I think I saw mom!”  
  
This should have been the wake-up call that something was wrong, and to get out! But the rain intensified so much that I thought one night couldn’t hurt anyone and it’s getting dark so it's safer to go in the morning.   
  
Boy how wrong I was!   
  
That night I kept Jason inside the tent for the whole day! I didn’t know what was happening, but I knew it wasn’t safe!   
  
Although Jason was upset that we weren’t going to play hide and go seek, he stayed in the tent.   
  
That night I was having trouble sleeping! I knew there was something out in the woods. And it looks like Janet. I tried to stay awake for my son, but I grew tired, and I eventually drifted off to sleep!  
  
At around midnight I heard a strike of lightning! And I woke up to see my son Jason staring out at the door to our tent.   
  
I asked him “Jason why are you awake?”   
  
Jason said to me happier than ever “I heard mom talking to me, she told me to come with her to the lake!”  
  
I was in shock. I began to think of what was out in the woods, and why it wanted my son!  
  
 I told Jason “Jason that is not your mother!”   
  
Jason kept looking out at the door and said to me “then why can I hear her voice!”  
  
I know this might sound stupid, but I had to see if she was still out there! I grabbed a pocketknife and a flashlight and opened the tent casually! When I got outside, I told Jason to stay inside, and I zipped down the tent and barricaded the entrance with some wet firewood!   
  
I shouldn’t have done that!  
  
Because I was patrolling out in the woods. I felt the uneasy feeling become one of nausea! And with the thick darkness out in the woods making even my high-power flashlight become muted!   
  
As I was patrolling, I felt the stupidity of my actions slowly sink in! I began to think about why I only brought a pocketknife to protect me from what is masquerading as Janet, and what if there is nothing in the woods and I just left my son alone in the tent for nothing!   
  
And then I realized the biggest mistake I made hit me!   
  
I left my son alone!  
  
I started running towards the tent. As I tried to keep illuminating my surroundings to the best I could! But the rain and darkness were drowning it all out! But I eventually came to our campsite.   
  
Unfortunately, the tent was ransacked and torn into pieces!   
  
In desperation I began to start calling out “Jason, Jason, where are you, Jason!”  
  
It was useless as I could not hear anything but the dense rain! But I then remembered something! I remembered that Jason said “she told me to come to the lake!” I felt my heart sink!  
  
I bolted towards the direction of the lake in a mad dash to save him! The closer and closer I got I began to hear my wife's voice say, “come be with mommy Jason!” what I once thought was the most beautiful voice was now one that made me feel the most disgusted!  
  
As I got to the lake, I felt like I was having a migraine! When I got closer to the shore it got worse and I saw the silhouette of my wife Janet illuminated by the moon looking out on the water! I pointed my flashlight at her and saw that part of her was melting!  
  
And then she turned!   
  
Now I could see the face of my wife Janet now in a melting and perverted form staring at me! She then chargers towards me!  
  
But I was faster! So, I managed to get a distance from her! I then realized something was something that I was ignoring!   
  
I was lost in the woods!  
  
I knew I was a goner! But I did have one hope, one single hope. If I could make it to my cabin, I would be safe!  
  
So, I ran deeper through the woods trying to get back into the cabin!   
  
I could hear the creature wailing in my wife's voice “chuck, chuck, do not be afraid!”   
  
It knew my name!  
  
Luckily, I found the campsite, meaning that I could use the trail. And once I made it on the trail, I saw the creature again, this time trying to mold itself into my son!   
  
It stopped when it knew my presence!   
  
It then tried to charge at me! But I evaded its grasp! And I ran all the way down the trail back to the cabin!  
  
I boarded my door and windows and hid under my bed. I felt safe there until!  
  
It found its way inside!  
  
It tried calling out to me in my son’s voice “dad, dad, I’m afraid where are you?”   
  
It was too convincing, but I knew it wasn’t Jason! I felt the most helpless feeling I've ever felt before! I thought I was a goner!  
  
But then the creature screamed in pain! It ran out of my cabin and back into the woods! After a few hours I felt safe. So, I crawled out to see that the rain stopped, and the sun was out!   
  
After the experience the police conducted a search for my son.   
  
They could not find his body!  
  
And I am currently trying to sell my cabin. Currently nobody has bought it yet! But I don't currently live there!   
  
Right now, I am living in a motel, trying to make enough money to leave the state of Washington! Although I no longer live in the Washington forestland.   
  
I still see the creature at my door when it rains! Wanting in!  
  
It’s hard to not open the door! For it looks like my son when the rain comes.
