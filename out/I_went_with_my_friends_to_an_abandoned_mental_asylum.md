My friends and I once found what seemed to be an abandoned mental asylum. You know, the type you see in scary movies. Big scary entrance, once boarded up, now decaying with planks broken and nails sticking out. Located far out in the woods, in the middle of nowhere. No one of us could understand why it was placed there. When was it built? We discussed it, but it was all speculations. It couldn’t have been easy to build. There were no roads leading to the building. At least, none that were apparent. Faint tracks in the mud indicated what could have been roads, a long time ago, but what was left was far from what you could drive a car on, let alone a truck.



We had heard rumors about the building and that it once was used for treating the insane. Apparently, it had originally been built as a sanatorium, hence the location, but we all thought it was a bit far-fetched. It was just rumors. However, we went to find out if it was true or not. No one remembers who told us about it, but we all heard them. Who heard them first? Who knows? Someone pitched the idea of exploring the woods and searching for it, and everyone wanted to go. Simple as that. 



Getting there wasn’t easy. The forest was filled with thickets and marshes that repeatedly forced us off any direct path. After fighting through the weeds for what seemed to be hours, a chimney rose up from some brushwood. We were finally there!



The group consisted of me, John, Adam, Marshall and James. Adam was the newcomer of the group, and the rest of us had been friends since freshman year of college. We regularly went out in the woods, visiting parks and such, so this type of exploration was out of the ordinary.



We walked up to the front side of the building. The size of it felt wrong. All the pictures we had seen online of different asylums showed large buildings, tall, with several rows of windows and different wings. This one seemed small in comparison. From the entrance, we could see two wings, one on each side, roughly 100ft long. On both wings were two rows of small windows, presumably cells, and one row of large windows on the first floor. Most on the first floor were boarded up, while the ones on the second and third floors had cracked or were missing completely.



A brief look at the entrance told us enough - that it was nothing but a death trap. The rotting boards covering the door hung loosely. James said he thought we could remove them, but Adam stopped him. He said he would get crushed if he tried. And if that happened, how would we call an ambulance? Not to mention the diseases he could contract. 

 

We split up into two groups. James, Marshall and I went counterclockwise around the building, while Adam and John went clockwise. 



On the short side of the wing, we saw a large sheet of plywood leaning against the wall. It was fresh and still light brown, as opposed to the dark, corroded browns of the surrounding wood. Apparently, we weren’t the only ones who had ventured here. But how would anyone get it out here? And why? 

 

Behind the plywood sheet was a door. A new door. No cracks, no moss, fresh hinges, and a shiny padlock in stainless steel. I felt a chill through my spine. *We weren’t supposed to be here*. Someone had been here, probably recently. Why? Why would anyone make the effort to drag materials put here? Were they squatters? Junkies? If we met someone, which would be better? I shivered and looked at James and Marshal. Both were grinning and discussing what could be behind the door. Not a single word of caution, only excitement. 

 

James tried banging on the door. Did he expect someone to open? The thought of someone else here made me uneasy. 

 

“Guys, I don't think we should be here. I want to leave. This place creeps me out.”



Before anyone could respond, we heard Adam from the other side.



“Hey! We found an entrance!”

 

James and Marshall rushed away, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. Very wrong. I felt watched, watched from different directions. While looking at the surrounding vegetation, I felt someone watching me from within the building. When I turned around to check the windows, I saw nothing. But then, the same feeling came once more, but now from the forest. As if it had eyes. A twig cracked and I rushed to my friends.

 

Adam was holding another fresh sheet of plywood, hiding yet another door. Same type of door, new hinges, and a matching padlock.

 

The padlock hung on the door, shackle open. “Apparently it wasn’t locked,” John said.

 

“We found one as well, but we didn’t touch it,” said Marshall.

 

We all looked at each other. My friends were grinning with anticipation, while I almost trembled with fear.

 

“Y’all ready?” Adam grabbed the door, while I closed my eyes. I wanted to leave so badly, but I knew that if I tried to find my way back, I would get lost. If I got lost, whatever was lurking in the woods would get me. Like in every horror movie. I wasn’t that stupid.

 

Adam pulled the door, and it swung open without any struggle. It seemed too new to be here. It *shouldn’t* be here. It was totally wrong. New things on something that was supposed to be abandoned felt wrong. Abandoned things should be rusted and rotten, not fresh wood and shiny steel.

 

I spoke before anyone could enter the doorway. “Do none of you think it's fucking weird to find a perfect door, almost new, in a place like this? It’s an ABANDONED building, it shouldn’t look like this!” 

 

“So what? If we meet anything, we’re a group. Besides, I brought protection,” John said while showing his gun. 

 

“Then it’s nothing to worry about,” Adam said. “Let’s go, I’m dying to see what’s inside!” 

 

He entered the building, followed by John. James and Marshall stayed with me. Noticing that we weren’t moving, John mimicked a gun. They shrugged and followed John. How much safety would a gun provide? I shook my head in disbelief, but when the creeping sensation came back, I followed my group. 

 

The door we’d entered through had probably been an exit, as the inside showed a hallway. This must have been an administrative ward, as all the rooms looked like offices. Small signs ornamented each door, but time had made them unreadable. 

 

The closer we came to the main entrance, the worse the stench got. It smelled of mold and something rotten. Like compost, or roadkill. Past the main entrance, we saw a sign that said “Storage” and went to check it out. The stench worsened. Outside the door, it was unbearable – a thick, meaty smell. Marshall tried to yank the door, expressing his hope it would open the same way as our entrance. However, it didn’t bulge, so we continued to another room designated for storage. 

 

I covered my nose, but the stench seeped through everything. I gagged and almost vomited, but the others didn’t seem bothered. *Why?*

 

“I want to leave. This feels too weird!”

 

“Then do so, we’ll continue exploring.”

 

“I’ll get lost if we don’t go together…”

 

Marshall tried the other storage door, and it opened. The room consisted of several shelves of glass vials and jars. It looked like something straight out of a horror movie. 

 

“Why do you want to be here?” I asked. “Sure, it seemed fun at first, but this place gives me the creeps. How can you not think something is wrong?”

 

“Because it’s an abandoned building. It’s old, it’s going to smell and feel weird.”

 

“What about the fresh plywood and the new door? Who would do such a thing?”

 

They all shrugged. What was I supposed to do? Follow them, or try to find my way home? I felt that the best option was to stick with the group, even if I wanted to flee. 

 

In the back of the room, we found jars filled with some kind of liquid, and… organs. Kidneys, intestines, and even a brain, suspended in some kind of liquid. I threw up, while the rest of the group examined it thoroughly. While bending forward, I noticed something in the corner of the room. After wiping my mouth, I went over and saw that it was a white thermal box with red letters on it. 

 

HUMAN ORGAN FOR TRANSPLANT

 

I felt like I was going to faint. The box looked clean, like it was brand new. James went over to the box. But instead of picking it up, he opened the nearby locker. Revealing even more thermal boxes. 

 

“We shouldn't be here!” said James.

 

I could hear his voice breaking up, finally someone felt the same as me. The rest of the group didn’t seem too bothered by our macabre finding. 

 

“I just want to check upstairs really quick. Then, we'll leave this place. Okay?” Adam bargained.

 

All went back to the main entrance. Adam and Marshall went upstairs, while the rest of us stayed behind. 

 

While waiting, we could hear the floor creaking as they walked away. After just a few minutes, we heard a commotion from upstairs.

 

Suddenly, Adam yelled. “Help!”

 

John drew his gun, and we rushed up the stairs and turned to the right. It was a long and narrow hallway. Shattered glass covered the floor. A lot of the cell doors were either open or completely missing. Down the hallway, we saw Marshall on the floor. Kicking and screaming as a figure was dragging him away. John rushed towards them, aiming his gun, but out of one of the open cell doors came a bat. It struck him right in the face, making an awful cracking sound. As he fell to the ground, blood spewed out of his mouth and teeth fell to the ground. Out of fear that it would happen again, neither me nor James dared to rush after. Who knew if more people were lurking? We walked as fast as we could, checking past each door for ambushes. Time-consuming, and as we checked each door, our friend was dragged further away.

 

They were being dragged into a room, and by the time we got there, the door was locked. Through the small window, we could see the figures wrestling with Marshall. John sat in an adjacent chair. His face was mangled, and a stream of blood ran down his body. Still fighting for his life, Marshall didn’t make it easy for the figures. I pulled the handle with all my force. I punched the window as hard as I could. Tears poured as I tried everything. John tried tackling the door, but it wouldn’t give way.

 

“What are we going to do?!” James grabbed my shoulders and started to shake me. His eyes were red, and he was pale as a sheet. 

 

“Where did John's gun go?” I said, frantically scanning my eyes through the shaded gray corridor. 

 

We hurried back to where John had been ambushed, but the gun was nowhere to be found. In a desperate search for tools, we rushed down the stairs, back to the room labeled “Storage”. In the same room as the thermal boxes, James found a crowbar. I grabbed a hammer, and we rushed back. 

 

Halfway through the corridor, out of nowhere came a bat. Hitting James right in the face, he fell to the ground. A large thud and one of his eyeballs popped. How many were there? The man came at me, swinging his bat in my face. I dodged and smashed his knee with my hammer. He screamed and fell to the ground, grabbing his knee and rolling around. One of his forearms had a black tattoo of a skull, I do not know why I noticed it, but something made me stare at it for a second. Out of the room where John and Marshall had been dragged, came the two other ambushers. Rushing towards me.

 

I panicked, rushing down the stairs and through the hall. All the doors were closed, so I assumed that there wasn’t anyone behind them. Not that I had the time to slow down and check.

 

Once outside the building, Adam came running from the backside. We rushed as fast as we could through the forest, hopefully in the right direction. After a long time running, we came to a road. When we were sure that we had lost them, I grabbed my phone to call the police. Not knowing where we were, I tried my best to describe the location. It ended up being a vague explanation of where we were, and I told them what had happened. 

 

Adam told me that someone had pushed him into a cell and the door had locked. I looked at everything that moved, and the slightest cracking or any leaf caught by the wind was enough to scare me. Adam continued to explain, but I couldn’t focus. Something about smashing the window and climbing down the wall. I wasn’t that interested, I was mostly relieved that I wasn’t alone.

 

After a while, we saw the patrol car and waved at them. I had no idea where we came from, so Adam led the way. After walking what seemed to be an eternity, we came out of the forest to see a football field. Our football field. Somehow, we had ended up in our city. 

 

“I don't understand,” said Adam, “we walked the exact same way. How could we get lost?”

 

I shook my head. I had no idea how this had happened. I had tried my best to remember the way, but apparently both of us were wrong.

 

The police dismissed us. They must have thought we tried to trick them. First, they started to ridicule us, talking about the big and scary building, right in the middle of nowhere, that no one had heard of. Then, their tone became harsher and said that we'd get arrested if we bothered them with this again. We weren’t lying, but they didn’t believe us.

 

Marshall, James, and John were listed as missing, but they were never found again. I grieved the loss of my dear friends. Blaming myself for not trying harder to stop them from entering.  Adam and I didn’t talk much after that. He found new friends to hang out with, but I was still mourning.

 

Every night I had vivid dreams about what had happened. The dream started with a cloaked figure leading the way to the asylum. It carried a comically big set of keys with it and would use it to open every door. Through each door, it would direct the group further, going upstairs and finally into an operation room. One after the other, my friends got knocked out by a taser. The figure closed the door in my face, leaving me outside, and started to restrain my friends. An open locker showed thermal boxes. Lots and lots of thermal boxes. The figure started cutting in my friends and I did nothing. I just stood there, watching my friends have their organs harvested. When the figure was done, and every organ harvested, the figure would stand before me. Revealing its face, showing who it was. Me, it was I.

 

Some time later, I went to a bar to drown my sorrows when I saw Adam sitting in a booth, chatting with people I didn’t know. Two of them were my age, probably students, and the third was much older and bigger. He sat there with crutches, leaning towards the booth. There was something about that man that made my stomach upset. He made eye contact with me, and while giving me a disturbing smile, he raised his glass. Then I saw it! The tattoo! Adam noticed me and gave an awkward smile, whispering something to the injured man. He tried to limp after me, but I turned around, walking as fast as I could without drawing attention to me. My brain froze, I needed to get away. Fast. As I opened the door out, one of the unknown men started talking, addressing Adam, mentioning an abandoned building in the middle of the nowhere.

 

It was then I realized who had suggested that we go there in the first place.
