I was a little late today. Who am I kidding I’m a little late every day. I walk into the shop and punch in like usual. Lou doesn’t even look at me anymore or shake his head. I guess that’s what 20 years of always showing up a little late does. As I walk through the shop I give Lou’s guys their morning pleasantries.

“Morning, Brandon”

“Morning, Jo”

“How are you today?”

“Living the Dream”

“You’re dream or someone else’s?”

We both laugh as this is the same conversation we’ve had about a thousand times now.

*It’s too bad.*

I walk out to the garage where the plumbers meet. Maury, Brent, Mini Zeke, and Bruce are all waiting for their morning jobs from our dispatcher. Darryl doles out the morning jobs like usual. Maury and Brent are going to fix some leak in an apartment complex, Bruce gets the joy of unplugging a few toilets that have this mysterious goo coming out of them. The people in that office building have probably never seen their own shit before, but hey people are entitled to think poo and goo are one and the same. These guys are the current crew we have. Turnovers are high here at “Lou’s Plumbing and Heating Co.” Somehow I have more seniority than almost everyone here.

“Here comes the straggler!” says Bruce

In walks Louis Jr. the Third. I shouldn’t say walk. It’s more like a deranged shuffle. Louis Jr. the Third, or as we call him Lou the turd, is our dear proprietor's son. He’s a dick. He’s also weird. He likes to sit slightly too far away from everyone. He also smells a little rotten, like right before the milk is curdled. He’s been here supposedly forever, or so he tells everyone.

*Lies.*

Anyhow this morning the Turd walks in with a pile of paperwork, and before I can say anything…

“Holy shit, you know how to read?” says Mini Zeke

And in a high nasally voice “Well you’re one to talk, didn’t your dad drop you on your head when you were a baby? Oh right, he wasn’t even around when you were born. Guess your stupidity drove him to kill himself.”

“Ladies please”

In walks Bill. He’s our boss and Lou’s adopted brother.

“What my dear illiterate nephew meant to say was, we have some new training documents to go over. We got a big job at the plant starting next month and we have some safety training I need you guys to familiarize yourselves with.” I felt the room turn to ice when Bill brought up The Plant. I glanced around the office and saw Mini. He was stiff as a board. I casually said

“Hey Bill, are we decommissioning the boiler?”

“We’re not just decommissioning it, we’re replacing it, Jo.”

“How are we gonna do it? That thing is the size of a 12-story building.”

*They're all burning.*

“We’ve partnered with Trent and George to supply the manpower, and you’ll be working with Chris and Andreas as Leads.

“Fuck Andreas, Chris I understand, but Andreas?”

“I didn’t like it either, but we needed a demolition crew and I thought I could benefit with you and Chris elsewhere.”

“So why Trent and George then? Thought you hated each other?”

“We came to find that working together after all these years is mutually beneficial”

“Uh huh, how big is the contract?”

“Twelve million”

“Shouldn’t it cost more in the neighbourhood of six to seven million?”

The last one I did, a fly-in job in Northern Ontario, was about five point five million. If you factor in all the inflation, the “supply chain issues” and all the salesman bullshit. It should only be a few million more, but more than double?

“Are we removing the old boiler?”

“Not exactly, we’re going to leave the skeleton and repair the holes in it and update the burner box.”

*Whatever you do won’t work. It will happen again.*

“When can I see the plans?”

“Next week, I’ll have the engineer fax us a couple of copies.”

Ah yes, the trusty dusty fax machine we’ve had since 1987. We’re real cavemen here at Lou’s. Our 24/7 emergency service still runs off a pager. Every invoice is handwritten. And to top it all off. One computer in the business. I’m pretty sure it’s just so the old bat, who’s been the secretary here since before I was born, can go on Facebook and watch some porn. She’s a really pleasant lady.

And that was it for what old Bill had to say, he grabbed a coffee and went back to his office.

“So Darryl, what do you have for me?”

“Remember Frank?”

“Frank Sinatra?”

“No Farmer Frank, your best buddy.”

I do not remember who farmer Frank is and how he’s my best buddy, but Darryl is sure every client is our best buddy.

“Okay, what’s going on at my buddy’s place?”

“His wood furnace went out, he tried to fix it himself but couldn’t do anything to help his situation.”

“Why am I going there? This sounds like a job for the heating crew.”

Though I know how to do this sort of work, I’m more on the installing boilers, large new construction projects and plumbing service repairs side of things.

“He asked for you, he’s been getting us to work on that thing for years. You may have worked on it too. It’s a piece of shit. Johnny services it every year. Get some info from him about it before you head there.”

“Sounds good.”

“And take Mini Zeke with you. Can’t leave the boy sheltered all day and I can’t send him with Turd.”

We all looked at Lou the Turd, he was scratching himself furiously and muttering under his breath. He didn’t hear what Darryl said.

*He hears everything.*

I wrangled up Mini Zeke and we walked over to our other shop to talk with the head of the heating crew, Johnny.

He’s a wizard. He can look at a system that’s just a mess and solve it in about 5 minutes. So when I spoke with him about farmer Franks, his response was…

Interesting.

“Johnny boy, Farmer Frank called, said his wood boiler was on the fritz again. Darryl said you would have some ideas.”

“Why the fuck are you going there? I told Lou to never go back there,” he said angrily.

“Greedy fucker.”

“Lou never listens when we tell him anything.”

“Ain’t that fucking right. Last I was there was bout a year ago. That’s an original Angel Fire Furnace. Fuckers never worked quite right. You can adjust the flame all you like but there’s never enough heat coming out of them.” I remembered an old Angel Fire Furnace commercial from when I was a teen. Some guy was dressed poorly in an Angel costume, holding a flaming sword for some reason. At the end of the commercial he always said, “Because when hell freezes over, only an Angle Fire furnace will keep you warm.”

I chuckled at that.

“Whatcha laughing about boy?”

“Remember the old Angel Fire commercials?”

“Fucking stupid commercials. When hell freezes over my ass. Lou was dumb enough to believe that shit.”

We’re the only company in the small town, and within a thousand kilometres, that works on and installs Angel Fire Furnaces.

“He gets them for a good deal, and the new units are pretty damn good from what I hear.”

“You don’t work on these pieces of shit every day, they haven’t changed. Sure they’ve gotten smaller, more ‘efficient’, but they still have the same problem. Not enough heat. I can get Lou to oversize the one he sells to the next idiot that walks in, but I know that next winter we’ll get the call saying it’s too cold. Lou’s pretty good at telling them to wear a blanket and giving them the same old spiel. “Nobody makes a furnace for our weather, it’s -50 some days, and 30 above the next.” He’s right when you’re dealing with Angel Fire, but the new furnaces they’re selling at the supplier they’re great. The only issue is that they get too hot…” he trailed off.

“So what do you figure is wrong with Frank’s? Bad pump? Broken line? Air shutters are closed?”

“Nah, Franks a smart old fucker, he’d have checked that. He only calls if he can’t figure it out.”

Johnny paused for a second. The room suddenly became chilly. He spoke in a harsh voice much quieter than normal.

“I reckon it’s the burner box, there’s a thermal reset switch inside. The switch is supposed to shut down the unit if it gets too hot, but I’ve only ever changed one in 40 years.”

“So why do you think it’s that then?”

“Cause Farmer Franks was where I changed it, and that’s why I told Lou never to go back to that thing.”

*When Hell freezes over, only Angel Fire will keep you warm.*

So with that Mini Zeke and I grabbed a thermal reset switch from Lou’s part warehouse and headed out to Franks.

It was about an hour and a half drive through the country with our shitty work van. Thanks, Lou, bald tires, broken windshield, the clock didn’t work for shit and rear-wheel drive in winter in Canada. At least the heater works. After getting the van stuck and shovelling it out for another hour we arrived at Franks.

“Oh yeah, I’ve been here before, a long time ago. I think I was with Bob. No, it was Bill. This was just after the plant shut down and Bob started at Lou’s. Holy shit that was almost 2 decades ago.”

Mini shot me a look, I could see the fear creeping towards his eyes.

“Don’t talk about The Plant.”

“Sorry Mini, I forgot about that. Bob brings me back to the beginning of my career. I learned a lot from that guy.”

We continued to chat as we walked up to the door.

knock knock

After 5 minutes there was no answer. “Let’s check the barn”

As we walked across the yard about 30 or so meters from the house was the furnace. They’re big units. Big enough to get rid of a few bodies we always joked.

They are a metal shed with a steel door about a meter by a meter. You open the door and throw wood inside. You turn the fan up at the back to get more heat out of it and a pump moves a combination of water and antifreeze around the outside to heat the home. Simple units really.

“That must be Frank,” Mini Zeke pointed towards the barn.

As we walked past the furnace we saw farmer Frank working on a tractor.

“Hey, Frank!”

“Well, how are you now boys?”

“Good and you?” Me and Mini said at the same time.

“Better since you two are here.”

Farmer Frank looks to be in his 70’s, still spry for an old fella.

Tic toc, tic toc.

“I don’t know what’s wrong with the damn thing, I can’t get it to light, I can’t get the pump to go.”

“Me and Mini will take a look to see if we can get you some heat for tonight.”

“Good luck boys”

Me and Mini walked back to the furnace. Hopeful because as Frank mentioned he couldn’t get it to light meaning the fire was out. I could’ve sworn there was smoke coming out of the chimney though. Must’ve been my imagination.

“Well Mini, want to try the thermal reset?” “I thought you said there’s no way it’s the thermal reset.”

“Well, is it possible I was wrong and there’s only one way to cut power to the entire system and it’s through that reset, right?”

“Well yea, but you? Wrong? Not you. Never you,” he says as a smirk appears on his face. “Smart ass”

Mini and I opened the door to the furnace to find no fire, but curiously also no thermal reset. “Where is it?”

“I don’t know Mini. Can you ask Frank if he’s got a manual for this thing?”

“Sure.”

As Mini went to find Frank again, I went to pull the van closer to the furnace. After I did that I grabbed my portable flashlight, some rags, vinegar and an air compressor. I grabbed my diesel heater and fired it up to thaw the vinegar and keep my hands from freezing as I cleaned and looked for that reset.

I saw Mini walking back a few minutes later. “So does he have anything?”

“Says he might have it in his attic. He’ll come over if he finds it.”

As we waited, we began cleaning the creosote and soot out of the burner box. We got it about half cleaned before we heard farmer Frank walking up to us.

“Here’s the manual boys.”

He handed me a tome. An actual tome. Leatherbound with parchment paper in between the bindings. It’s said on the front cover Angel Fire Model No. 4. It had the old Angel Fire logo under the title. I always found it odd. It was a larger circle to the left of a square opening. Lou said it was about some old story from an ancient book. Strange, he never mentioned what the book was called though. I blew the dust off of it.

*4 days, 4 temptations, 4 bodies.*

“Thanks, Frank”

Frank walked back to his tractor

“Alright Mini, keep cleaning, I’m going to sit in the van and read a bit more about this furnace. Come grab me if you need me”

“Must be nice, sit in the heat and I’ll stay out here and freeze.”

“Shouldn’t have been a smart ass then.”

I laughed and walked to the van. I opened the manual to a strange scene. The first page was a picture of the wood boiler. The second page was a table of contents, but it had 4 horses at each corner of the page. Looking at these pages, I felt cold. Colder than the outside of the van.

*When hell freezes over.*

I skimmed the table of contents and found what I was looking for.

IV. MAINTENANCE & TROUBLESHOOTING I flipped to page four and skimmed until I found a picture of where the thermal reset was supposed to be located.

“How the fuck did Johnny change that?” I jumped as Mini was banging on my window. I rolled it down.

“What’s up, buddy?”

“Look.”

He handed me a dog tag, it said Sadie. I flipped it over and on the back, it read Frank 555-387-6223 and under that, a name looked as if it had been scratched out with a razor blade.

“Yea?”

“I found it in the furnace.”

He paused

“Underneath it was the thermal reset switch.”

“What’s wrong Mini?”

“It felt warm when I grabbed it.”

“Furnace could’ve still been holding some heat.” I reassured him.

“Sure. That’s why the vinegar was freezing when I was spraying it out.”

“I’ll go talk to Frank about it. Don’t worry, just finish up cleaning and we can swap the reset and go home. It’s getting late.”

I’d started to notice the sun getting lower since I sat in the van. It felt like we only got here an hour ago. Guess it’s just my imagination. It must’ve taken longer to get here than I thought.

“Fucking Lou should’ve gotten that damn clock fixed a year ago when I told him.”

Customers don’t like it when I bill them off a sundial.

I got out of the van and started walking towards where Frank was.

“Hey Frank, I think your dog lost their tag.”

“My dog?” He solemnly chuckled

“Sadie died last week, I put her down behind the barn. Then I sent her back to god.”

“I’m sorry to hear that Frank. What do you mean sent her back to god?”

“Yeah, cremated her in the furnace, didn’t want to mention it, it was private. Now since you brought me her tag, I guess the cats out of the bag or the dogs out of the furnace.”

He laughed sadly again.

“I couldn’t help noticing, but the…” Frank chuckled softly and interrupted me.

“That’s my wife. She went missing last year… the police think she may have wandered off into the woods and froze to death. Never found her though.”

“I’m so sorry to hear that again Frank.” “It’s alright, she wasn’t herself anymore. Dementia got her. Muttering and talking to herself at the end. That wasn’t my wife, it was a husk with a survival instinct. I’m sorry to dump all this on you kiddo. I’ll let you get back to work.”

He took the dog tag, put it in his pocket and walked away.

I walked back to the furnace. The sun was almost setting.

“Huh, must’ve been a longer chat than I thought.”

Mini was covered in soot.

“Hey Mini, are you running for office with that face?”

“No.” He said curtly

“What’s wrong buddy?”

“I just want this job to be done. I want to go home.”

I looked into the furnace. It was spotless. And right in the middle was the hatch for the thermal reset. I saw how Johnny fixed it. “Damn, he just cut that hatch off and put a piece of sheet metal over it with some self-tapping screws.”

I grabbed my drill, pulled out the screws and there it was. The thermal reset switch. “Mini, grab me a set of needle nose pliers.” The switch was held in with a snap ring. Mini handed me the pliers.

“That was easy. Got the new one?”

“Here.”

And with that, it was in.

“Mini, grab me a flashlight, it's getting dark.” As he did that I started grabbing some firewood and fire started from the wood shed.

“Mini, fill it about a quarter way and light it. I’ll go fire on the pumps inside.”

Mini nodded.

As I walked to the house I started feeling cold.

*H E L L F R E E Z E S O V E R*

I walked back out to the furnace, it was pitch black out.

“Huh, didn’t think that walk was very long. Must’ve been my imagination.”

Mini was sitting in the van writing up the bill. I walked up and knocked on his window.

“Don’t fucking creep up and scare me like that, you’ve done that four times already.”

“I think you're going crazy buddy, here I’ll take the bill and tell Frank he’s all good.”

*Frank and Beverly sitting in a tree, B-U-R-N-I-N-G.*

I turned around and saw the furnace door open with a violent orange glow emanating from inside. I saw a shadow in front of the door. I saw the shadow climb into the inviting glow.

*And close the door.*

I shouted

“FRANK!”

I ran to the furnace. I threw open the door. The fire had gone out. Sitting on the hatch I had just opened was a simple gold wedding band with F & B in cursive script. I grabbed it instinctually.

It was ice cold.

*The farmer and his wife raised a beautiful boy. The boy was kind and intelligent. He worked hard. He had a good heart. He was a good man. He loved his family dearly. He adopted a dog. He treated her well. That’s why he burned alive. That's why they all burned alive.*
