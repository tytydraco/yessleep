I’ve been lucky enough to fall in love a few times, and all I want is to be lucky enough to do it again.

The girl in the grocery store who brushes her hair back thoughtfully as she checks out the various fruits and vegetables. The woman who waits patiently for the man walking in front of her to hold the door open for her entrance. The woman who… well really the woman who has a purpose. But not their own purpose, no that’s too simple. A woman whose purpose is to appear she has a purpose. Cares what other’s may think of her actions or inactions. Someone who diligently avoids all the normal faux pas people fall in to, who is very conscious to follow all the social rules and guidelines we secretly agree upon. Someone who doesn’t cause issues or a scene.
	
My last love couldn’t allow herself to let a man in a cast struggle to put his books in his car by himself. Never mind what this man in a cast was doing on a sunny day visiting the beach, whose waves would melt the home-plastered cast right off his leg. No, because that would be too rude. Imagine the social points she’d receive if anyone stopped to watch her help this poor, seemingly crippled man asking for help as he fumbles with his crutches and his books. If when I had asked she had hesitated or seemed uncertain I might have just dropped the crutches and act entirely and got in my car and left. But she was a proper woman.

My first love slept behind the gas station that was about a half block behind the house I grew up in. Now, she wasn’t entirely proper. Ragged clothes and layered jackets lay upon her day after day, no matter the weather. Her game wasn’t my favorite, but it was still a game. The famous act of spilling out personal tragedies with an empty can in hand to get whatever spare change any do-gooder stopping at the gas station could manage to dole out. Which of course, as soon as they’d walk away she would drop the act, calling them selfish or idiots for not putting more change in her cup. Then when she’d gotten her needed amount she’d wander off to some dilapidated house on the edge of town, get her fix, and then pass out on some years old thrown out couch. Yes, this was my first love. I never even knew her name, not that she would have told me a real one. 
	 
Everyday after grammar school,  my dear sweet grandmother would give me $5 to spend at the gas station about a half block behind her house. At this age I was more interested in fantasy and roleplay, escaping to far away places in my imagination. Magical places that games from before my time could take me to. But after learning more, the joys of money were even more magical. The ultimate game. If I have this paper, said to be backed by imaginary riches in an imaginary cave somewhere, then you will give me something I want. How beautiful! It’ll cut through all the bullshit of my or your own personal value, what I can do or what I can offer. I just get it. For this paper. As my young mind was putting this together, something else in my brain was putting together that you could get more than just candy on a shelf with this system. Seeing my love outside asking for change, before I knew she was my love of course, I would never spare a penny to her. This money got me what I wanted, what would be the point of handing it out like the candy I so dearly WANTED. But when men reach a certain age their wants start to stretch far beyond the candy aisle.
	
It took some time for my mind to do the math and put all of this together. But once it did… I felt like I could rule the world. This was before the internet, but after dirty mags were sold on every street corner. Something had entered my mind from a tv show or a book, or maybe just another kid boasting about a nonsense made up story to boost their own social credit. But what had entered my mind was a new want. I wanted to see a woman naked. So the calculus in my mind finally cemented. My love stood all day begging for pennies from strangers. She wanted the imaginary riches that the paper granted. My dear grandmother gave me that freely, daily. Once this thought arrived, it was like a flame engulfed me. At first it was just $5. But then I started saving up my allowance and not going to the gas station every day. So, next time when I wanted more, I would have the means to acquire more. You’d be amazed the things my love would be willing to do, even to a boy of my age, with $20, $50, or $100. 

But through this process, and the saving of this money, much time passed. Years passed. I had to project normalcy in every other facets of my life. My dark wants grew more and more and twisted and curled in ways I could have never imagined. But for that precious imaginary treasure, my love would eventually do it all. No matter how much I gave her she stayed homeless and destitute. From when I was a grammar school boy until I was grown man, with all the normal things I needed to blend in, and all the money from a burgeoning career I could give to her. She still stayed my love, and under my control. 

It was a shame when I finally bored of her and she had to go.
