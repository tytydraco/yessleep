Fifteen days have passed since I was released from Folsom State Prison. Well, released might not be the right word; I’ve been relocated to a halfway house in the middle of some dumpy neighborhood. Not like I can complain; beggars can’t also be choosers, after all.

Everything has changed so much. I still have some doubts about this being the same city I grew up in, but there are some structures that are familiar to me, so I suppose there’s that. Being out here is strange, to say the least. Don’t get me wrong, it is better than being locked up, but I don’t know; something just ain’t right. It just seems like I don’t belong here.

I share a room with five other folks. They’re decent and well-mannered. However, I can’t seem to form the same connection with them as I have with the people I’ve met over the last forty years. Perhaps it’s the age gap. During our time of leisure, they would be sitting on their beds scrolling on their phones and watching some nonsense I couldn’t really understand. I have tried talking to them, but their attention is that of an ass.

Haha, I’m turning into one of those old farts I despised when I was young, aren’t I? Isn’t that ironic? Well, such is life; you might as well make the most of it. One of my roommates, a young man whose name I can’t recall for the life of me, seemed to have gotten tired of my attempts to socialize. It is as such that he introduced me to this website, and frankly, I am overwhelmed. There are so many people with so many different backgrounds sharing their strange experiences here. I feel more at ease here. The outside world is too civilized for me.

Well, the reason why I was incarcerated doesn’t really matter. Compared to the psychos and gangsters in there, I could humbly say that I was one of the more tamer ones there, but I wasn’t always locked up in a can like the Folsom State Prison. No. Folsom is terrible, but by the time I got there, I was already used to the environment. I started off in the San Quentin State Prison.

I spent three months in the Los Angeles Pitchess Facility before going there. I always shared a room with three other folks. There were two bunk beds on each side of the cell. In between them were a sink and a toilet. There were all sorts of people there: murderers, thieves, rapists, you name it. They were what you would have expected. However, believe me when I say that those three months never would have prepared me for the real deal.

It was early in the morning when we arrived there. A bump awakened me from my sleep to the sight of a terrible fog that surrounded our bus. Suddenly, a light pierced through the fog, revealing us to the numerous guards outside and the building that seemingly towered over us, which we would later learn to be known as the West Block.

After I got off of the bus, they processed me into their systems, asking me about my health and my potential affiliations. Upon hearing questions about the latter, I came to comprehend a bit of the new world I got myself into. As stated before, this was unlike the county jail I was housed in. Every rumor you might have heard about the San Quentin State Prison is true, but even then it undermines the complexity of how everything operates.

When we walked into our block, everyone was looking down onto us. I’ve seen movies back then of people calling new prisoners “fresh meat”. I always thought it was a gross exaggeration used by the wannabe “tough guys”. Well, it wasn’t. We were being stared down, and as I later learned, you never want to look weak. You don’t want to be confused with a punk.

I learned many things there. Another lesson I learned was that you always need a friend. And the person you always want to befriend is your cellmate. You never want to piss them off because you don’t want to wake up to them standing over you with a shank in their hands, or worse yet, never waking up at all. Still, we were in the West Block, the tamer part of the entire prison.

My cellmate was a man named Ben Ashton, a young, slim and meek white guy like me that spent most of his time in his bunk bed. I tried talking to him numerous times, but I stopped after receiving dead ended replies. Luckily, he wasn’t much of a trouble maker, during the little time we spent together, so I suppose we got along well.

You have a lot of time there, and I mean it when I say a lot. Sure, there is a schedule, but nothing is always certain. There is a popular saying I heard in my first month in San Quentin: “The only consistent thing about prison is change.” I’m pretty sure I read this in some book or something. Can’t remember for the life of me.

I used to skip breakfast and sleep until 6:15 a.m. The food wasn’t great, and I enjoyed sleeping more. Upon getting up, I would start preparing for work. I used to work in maintenance. Well, that’s a fancy way of saying that I was doing the laundry. Don’t let the job fool you, though. It was still hard work. It was normal for us to do laundry that weighed a few thousand pounds on a daily basis. We used these industrial-sized washing machines that you could easily fit a person in. And we used to be paid thirty cents per hour for this. Yep, you heard it right, thirty cents.

Anyhow, I was done with work by 2:00 p.m. I’d grab something to eat before going to the yard. Before coming here, I always thought that the people in the yard were stupid. With all of the different groups there, something was bound to happen. Yet, it was only after coming here that I came to understand how important it is to go out. Being locked up just does something to ya. You want to go out. You simply need to.

I will never forget the end of my first week there. As I stepped outside, a great gust of wind blew into me as if welcoming me to what I could only describe as paradise. Then, there were the comforting rays of the sun bathing over me. Would you believe me when I say that I started tearing up? I never felt such joy for such small pleasures. Yet, even with this small taste of freedom, the looming shadows cast by the blocks were a constant reminder of how they were only temporary. The East Block being in sight didn’t make things easier either.

I could never be like Ashton. I rarely saw him leave his cell, let alone go outside. Hell, the only times he did were either chow time or shower days. He always laid on the upper part of the bunk bed, sleeping or just procrastinating. If only he was allowed to lend me his yard time. Speaking of chow time, dinner was at 6:00 p.m., but I was always prepared to go at 5:30. It was the only time actual food was served. Plus, I never wanted to wait too long. Trouble may occur at any moment, and you wouldn’t want to be caught in the middle of it.

By 9:00 p.m., we were forced back into our cells. There were around four hundred of them, and the guards had to manually lock us up. It usually took a very long time for them to do so, especially when some folks wanted to spend a few extra moments outside. During all of this commotion, I would try talking to Ashton before going to bed.

This was how I was going to be spending my next year there: waking up every day at the same hour, loading and unloading laundry without end, going out to get a small taste of freedom, eating the same meals over and over again before going back into my cell. Sure, there were times when not everything went according to the schedule, but those discrepancies don’t matter. There was a night, however, that I will never forget.

It happened in early September of that year, on a Thursday. Two months had passed since I arrived here, and everything suggested it was just another normal day. That was until a man was found dead in the shower that night.

Not everyone paid any mind to the news initially. However, when the cafeteria suddenly quieted down, the murmurs about the incidents were more tumultuous than yells. Everyone was called back into their cell, and dozens of guards began locking us in. Ashton was already on the upper bunk bed by the time I arrived.

I never had the chance to see the body, but a few on our floor did. I tried to listen. Some were horrified, some laughed, but it was clear everyone was anxious. Some said the poor soul was bludgeoned beyond recognition. Others accused other people of being the ones responsible. It was chaos. I eventually gave up and laid in bed to try and fall asleep. It was a futile attempt.

“What happened?” muttered Ashton all of a sudden.

“Some guy was found murdered in the shower.”

“Oh, do you know what happened?"

“Not much. All I know is that it was quite a scene."

“Oh.”

There was a brief moment of silence as we lay in our bunk beds. It was so quiet that I recall hearing what seemed to be water dripping from the sink.

“What are you in for anyway?" Ashton whispered.

“Tax reasons.” He seemed to be in a talkative mood today. “You know, now that I think about it, I never

actually asked you about it. Willing to share?”

“Oh, what I was sentenced for wasn’t my fault.”

“We all say that, but how so?”

“Oh, I was framed by the cops. You believe me, don’t you?”

“Yep, I-"

“I mean, of course you do. You are my friend, after all. Aren’t you?” I wanted to reply, but again he cut me off: “Those coppers, no, they don’t believe me. They just want to end a case quickly and get their paychecks. It’s always about the money and nothing else.” Another few drops of water were heard. “I mean. They rarely do their jobs, right, you know? I’ll give them credit for always being prepared with loads of arguments before sitting you down for an interrogation, but where were they when I needed them?”

“Mhm.” I replied anxiously.

“Yes, just look at me," he said as I heard movement on the top bunk. “Could I ever pose a threat to anyone? Could I ever be the aggressor? No, of course not. Just like my parents, it’s their fault, not mine. They always were.” During the time Ashton said all of this, I opened my eyes and was witness to the sight of a black liquid dripping down. I froze, not knowing what to do.

“Do you like liars, my fellow man?”

"N-no,” I struggled out.

“Oh, of course not. Nobody does. Those detectives claim that they are smart, but they aren’t. What smart man would use deceit against a fellow man? No, of course. They lure you in by asking you how you are doing and what food and drinks they may serve you, and once you finish answering all their silly little questions in your comfortable chair, they start twisting your words. They start telling you lies and try to trick you into following their stories. And you eventually break them down and accept them as reality. I never killed anyone. I didn’t kill my parents. I didn’t kill that girl or that man in the shower, but they are going to blame it all on me now, as they always do. They will frame me with every mistake they can’t resolve before they murder me.”

Another moment of silence before it was cut short. “Now I am here," he said with a normal voice this time. He didn’t sound like Ashton at all. He had a rougher and more unhinged voice than him. “Murderers, rapists, and gangsters. How could I be locked in the same building as these animals? Oh, but you’re different, aren’t you? You aren’t like these savages, but you are still a liar."

He adjusted himself a bit more. “Are you going to tell me a lie?” he asked as he poked only half of his head down, revealing his wide and demented eyes that seemingly could never blink. His face was covered in a black substance that gave off a putrid metallic odor. And his breath! If they could even be described as such! Not even the word deranged could ever fully describe those manic pants. I wanted to say no, but my mouth was so dry that I could only shake my head.

“Oh, I shall trust you, good man. You trust me, after all," he said as he slid his head back up. I was too terrified to fall asleep that night. Even if I did try, the dripping never ceased.

I later found out that the man who was murdered in the shower was Ben Ashton. The murderer, Jack Robertson, was a convicted felon who was charged with committing several gruesome murders over the last half a decade. He put up a fight before being subdued by the officers.

Nobody knows how he snuck out of the East Block, why he chose to go to our block, and why he chose to sleep in Ashton’s bed after murdering him instead of escaping. What I do know is that thinking about such things is futile. Reason and logic are reserved for us human beings, after all. Who I saw that night could never be described as human. He was a monster disguised as a human. I was going to meet more monsters like him during my stay in these prisons. Still, even now, whenever I hear the sound of dripping, I am reminded of that [night.](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheStorytellerArter/comments/186q4qz/my_tales/)
