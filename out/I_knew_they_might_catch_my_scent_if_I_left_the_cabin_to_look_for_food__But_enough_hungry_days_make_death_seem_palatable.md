I sat up in my sleeping bag, my back stiff.  When you’re hungry, truly hungry, you find yourself sleeping a lot.  It’s the most energy efficient way to spend time.  The sun coming in through the window was hitting my face, it’s warmth welcome, but the new day bringing little hope.

I’d been driving up and down the mountain roads, breaking into any houses I could find for food, trying to siphon gas from cars.  If a house had broken down doors or smashed windows, I wouldn’t go in.  It was too risky that one had been there, that it might be sleeping in a dark closet or basement.

Montana had been one of the last states functioning.  The combination of isolation, cold, and per capita gun ownership accounted for that.  There were still radio broadcasts, but less of them, and usually just repeating on loops.  I knew things were bad because I heard less and less gunshots, and more and more of the terrible, high pitched howls.

Today, I was walking.  My prospects were grim, and I promised to leave at least one bullet in my .44, no matter what.  The car was running on fumes, and I told myself I would need it if they found the cabin.  That way I would have a shot at escape.

Where the bridge crossed the creek, light hit the rushing water.  For a brief moment, the yellow morning sun on the pines and birds singing made me forget my stomach.  I tried to enjoy each day as much as I could, but it was becoming harder and harder.

The house was large, fairly old.  I’d seen it across the valley, but hadn’t found the road to it.  Since I was walking, I could just scramble my way up the hillside.  I filtered cold water from the creek, which cramped my empty stomach, and began to work my way up a slippery forest slope of pine needles, rocks, and shrubs.

I broke a basement window, and undid the deadbolt.  There was no alarm, and no signs of entry.  I went straight for the kitchen, for the pantry.

It was the most beautiful thing I’d ever seen.  Cans of soup, bags of rice, jerky.  I popped the lid off of a beef stew can and began furiously eating, nearly choking myself.  After a few bites, I paused to avoid throwing up.  Immediately, I started making a pile on the floor of everything I would take, planning multiple trips.

But what if that wasn’t necessary?

After eating, I looked around the house.  It had a rustic, lived in feel that suggested an older couple.  I found a picture by the couch that seemed to be them.  They looked happy.

I went upstairs, checking the bedrooms.  This house was untouched, miraculous.  Not one in fifty looked like this, and I’d gotten warning shots over my head on most of those.

It wasn’t until I went to the next room that I knew.

There was a closet between the master bedroom and its bathroom.  All of the clothes were pulled hastily off of the hangers, and I could see bits of sleeve and blankets poking out under the bathroom door, wedged there.  They didn’t like light.

If I wasn’t starving to death, I would have just left.

As it was, I tiptoed down the stairs, praying that each one wouldn’t creak.  It wasn’t until I reached the living room that I dared cock the hammer of the revolver.  I left it cocked in the holster, something I would never do, as I loaded up my backpack and a pillowcase.

Painstakingly, I found my way between pieces of broken glass, opened the basement door, and went downhill.  It was unfathomably lucky it hadn’t awoken.  After about a hundred yards, I uncocked the gun and began to rush down the hill, with sloppy, stumbling steps.

I twisted my ankle.  Starving is a cruel thing, draining away your strength a bit at a time, and I’d overestimated myself.  I cursed under my breath, knowing that if it was bad enough, it might kill me.  If I couldn’t get back to the cabin.

Even in my pain, I had made a plan.  If I didn’t have plans, I would have died months ago, with everyone else.

I reached the road, and took my shirt off.  I tied it around my shoe, and began to walk downstream.  This wasn’t for the ankle, of course, but because they tracked by scent.  My shirt would leave a hundred times stronger scent than the bottom of my shoes.

I crossed the creek.  It was hard, and I was freezing, and I lost the pillowcase, but I did it.  Then I went downstream even more, and crossed back.  It had to be done.  I threw the shirt in the river, and made my way back up the road, back to the bridge.

The road was paved, and would leave no tracks.  If they followed the scent I left now, they would go to the river, cross it twice, come back here, and go in a circle.

Or so I hoped.

When the sun went down, I  got into the sleeping bag.  The ankle was sore, but fine to walk on, thank God.  On a full stomach, I lay down and prayed.

My eyes jarred open in the darkness.  Gunshots.  One, then more, then high, screeching howls.  Nearby.

I had no idea other people were close.  Had I known, I would have tried to warn them.

I’d slept in my clothes, boots and all.  I grabbed the  backpack, the lamp, and the sleeping bag, and was in my car in fifteen seconds.

I floored it up the dirt road, drifting around turns as fast as I could without crashing.  The headlights in front of me came as a shock, something I hadn’t seen in weeks.  A truck was turning onto this road, just in front of me.

They were chasing it.  I could see at least three of them, running impossibly fast, one slamming into the side of the cab as the truck navigated the sharp turn, breaking a window and reaching its arm into the back seat, holding on as its legs now dragged on the ground, clawing at the people inside.  A bright flash illuminated the horrid face, or what was left of it, the shotgun blast dislodging it from the car to roll on the ground.

By the time I passed it, it was already getting back up.

I had to hit the brakes when the truck cut in front of me, and now the other two were right on my rear bumper, beating at the window, grasping fingers slamming the glass.  They were strong, but couldn’t get enough force to break the window while running at a full sprint.  I finally pulled ahead, checking the speedometer.  They ran twenty five miles per hour, uphill.

Watching the monstrosities fade into the lines of trees in my rear view, listening to the unsatisfied howls, I could only feel one thing: hope.

I’d found other people.  I’d been alone for three weeks now, and it had been a desperate three weeks.  The truck was going faster than me, but I could just barely make out their tail lights.  There was a chance they would slow down once it was safer, talk to me.

That hope was such a brief feeling.

The engine stuttered, then died.  I tried to start it, but it only cranked.  There was no gas.

I got out, and began to run.  I can’t say why.  As soon as the door opened, I heard the howls getting closer.

I cannot run twenty-five miles per hour, uphill.  [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l4494e/i_knew_they_might_catch_my_scent_if_i_left_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
