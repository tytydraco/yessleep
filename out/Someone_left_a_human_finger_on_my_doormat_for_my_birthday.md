It was around 8 a.m. when I woke up.

I brushed my teeth and walked into the kitchen, where my mom was already waiting—seated, sipping coffee, and watching one of her crazy news shows.

As soon as she saw me, she stood up and gave me a tight hug. “Happy birthday, honey.”

Then she went back to eating her toast and asking what I thought about some ridiculous conspiracy theory.

I didn’t reply. Just rolled my eyes while pouring myself a mug of coffee.

That’s when the doorbell rang.

I thought it was the party decorations I'd ordered and headed toward the door.

Strangely, the delivery person was already gone, even though I had taken no more than ten seconds to reach the handle.

On the porch, lying on the doormat, was a letter envelope—paper, but clearly containing something inside.

Curious, I picked it up and opened it.

Inside was a small scrap of paper, like a torn-off page, and a slender black object I couldn’t immediately identify.

I pulled out the note first. In messy handwriting, it read:

*Big day today baby.*

A chill shot down my spine as I read those words. It sounded a lot like him.

“Could this be father?” was all I could think, and for a few seconds, I stood there, frozen.

“No, it can’t be!” I said aloud, snapping out of it.

Then I turned my attention to the object. It didn’t look like anything familiar.

I gently pulled it out, feeling its softness and inspecting it carefully. But I soon dropped it—and screamed when I realized what it was.

A finger. It looked like a pinky. 

Blackened with rot, nail missing, the smell unbearable.

\*\*\*

“Do you want to cancel it?” my mother asked, as the police officers left our house. “The party, you know”

“No, I don’t,” I replied, slightly annoyed by the question.

This was supposed to be the first normal birthday I’d had since we escaped his grasp. I’d invited all my coworkers.

“The cops said they’d keep an eye out for him. They even gave me their personal numbers,” I reassured her, though it didn’t seem to help.

She sat at the table with her hands covering her mouth, anxious. It reminded me of those nights she used to wait for him to come home after hours at the bar—just to find out what kind of punishment he’d decide to unleash.

“Besides,” I added, “we don’t even know for sure if it’s him.”

“It’s him, honey,” she said firmly, eyes drifting off as if lost in a flashback. “We may not know whose finger that was, but you know damn well why it’s a finger.”

I saw tears start to form in her eyes and walked over.

“Even if it is him,” I said, placing my hands gently on her shoulders, “the police will catch him.”

I don’t know if she believed me or not, but she stood up and quietly went to her room.

It was almost noon now, and I decided to start setting up our living room for my birthday party later that evening.

I did everything while trying to push the incident out of my mind—but a voice kept echoing in my head:

*“Will we ever be free from him?”*

\*\*\*

The rest of the afternoon went by smoothly.

Snacks and drinks were on point. The tacky decorations I had ordered from Amazon finally arrived.

I took a long, hot shower and got dressed to welcome the first guests. My mother had also come out of her room, wearing a long white dress I hadn’t seen her in for years.

The last time she wore something like that, it hadn’t ended well with dad.

My two closest friends were among the first to arrive, and I couldn’t resist pulling them aside to explain what was going on.

“Oh my god, Maria,” one of them gasped, shaken. “Do you think he’s watching you or something?”

“I don’t know,” I replied. “But I’ve been texting the officer all afternoon. They’re patrolling the neighborhood. They’ve been looking for him for a long time now.”

“But why a finger?” the other asked, intrigued.

I didn’t answer. I just turned and looked over at my mother, who was seated, chatting with a friend.

My friends followed my gaze—and understood immediately. My mother was holding her beer glass with her right hand, and it was missing a finger—her pinky.

“The first time she tried to leave him, she packed everything in a suitcase while he was at work and we drove away,” I began, trying not to let the wave of emotion take over. “He found us at some crappy roadside motel and cut her finger off as punishment.”

My friends, probably not prepared for the intensity of what they’d just heard, went silent—eyes wide in disbelief.

“Jonathan should be here with the cake any minute,” I said suddenly, shifting tone, taking a sip of wine, trying to steer the mood back toward normalcy.

I tried to lighten the atmosphere, chatting with the other guests, refilling drinks, playing upbeat music. I told myself this was my day, and I wouldn’t let him take it from me again.

Then the doorbell rang.

My heart lifted a little. It had to be Jonathan with the cake. 

But when I opened the door, it wasn’t him.

It was just another guest, a coworker.

“How are you doing, birthday girl?” she said casually, stepping in with a bottle of wine in hand and giving me a kiss on the cheek. 

“By the way, I found this lying on the ground in front of your door,” she said, while handing me a plain envelope. “Thought it might be important.”

My hands were steady, but inside, everything went cold. I took the envelope, nodding as if it were nothing. It was similar to the last one. 

It was another ripped piece of paper, the same messy handwriting. Thankfully, no finger this time. The message read:

*Your present is coming baby*

\*\*\*

I forced a smile for the guests, trying not to alarm anyone. “Excuse me for a moment,” I said softly and slipped away to my room.

Once inside, I closed the door and grabbed my phone. My hands were shaking as I texted the police officer, asking if someone could check my house now—just to be sure.

Then I called Jonathan. He didn’t pick up.

I called again. Still nothing.

Panic began to creep in. He was meant to pick up my birthday cake, and I hadn’t heard a word from him all day. Something felt off.

A soft knock on the door made me flinch. It was my mom.

“You alright?” she asked gently, stepping inside.

I nodded, though my trembling hands said otherwise. Without speaking, I handed her the envelope.

She read the note inside and went quiet. Her gaze drifted into the distance, her expression hollow. 

“He’ll only stop when I’m dead,” she murmured, before breaking down in tears.

I rushed to her and held her tight as she wept in my arms.

We were interrupted, though, by a voice calling out from the door:

“Hey, Maria! The cake is here!”

I jolted upright. Jonathan must be here.  “Let’s go, mom,” I hurried out, heart pounding, only to find the guests looking at each other, confused.

“We heard the doorbell,” one of my friends said. “And we opened it, but there was just this box sitting on the doormat. I guess someone just left it here.”

At the front door, a cake box was lying there on the floor—white, sealed, with the bakery’s logo printed on top. 

I grabbed it and set it on the kitchen counter—only to feel something wet on my fingers.

A drop. Thick and dark red. 

The silence took over the room. I could feel every gaze on me as I carefully untied the bow and opened the box.

I felt sick to my stomach wondering what was inside, but I forced myself to lift the lid.

And, as you can imagine, there wasn’t a cake.

There was a face. A head.

Freshly severed—the color still vivid. Eyes closed, mouth slightly open.

It was a head I recognized instantly. The one that had haunted our daily lives with fear for so long. My father’s.

And stapled to his forehead, the same kind of torn paper as before, with the same crooked handwriting. It read:

*Happy birthday Maria*
