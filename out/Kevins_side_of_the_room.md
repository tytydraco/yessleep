When I first moved in, my RA told me my roommate  Kevin  had checked in two weeks earlier. When I got to the room, his side was perfectly clean, neat, and straight. Nothing out of the ordinary. I’ve always been pretty introverted, so I was hoping my roommate wouldn’t be too much of a bother.

I couldn’t have been more wrong.

The first week went by quietly enough. I heard the usual college noises at night  music thumping through the walls, people shouting down the hall, doors slamming. But I never heard Kevin. I’m a light sleeper, so I figured I’d wake up if he came in late. Still, every morning, his bed was made, his desk untouched, everything exactly the same.

Then little things started to change. His toothbrush would be angled differently than before. His hamper slowly filled with clothes I didn’t remember seeing. I told myself I must’ve imagined it, but every day there was some small sign that Kevin had been there  even though I never saw or heard him once.

And that’s when I started to feel it that quiet, heavy sense that I wasn’t really alone. It was the start of the second week when I woke up to the faint sound of running water coming from the shower. I’ve always kept doors closed when I sleep a habbit I’ve had since I was a kid and this room was no different. I slowly got up, turned on the light, and found no one there. The floor was damp, the mirror fogged up, and there was a faint smell of shaving cream  one I’d never noticed before.

The next night, still on edge, I decided to take some sleeping meds and just pass out, since I had an early class the next morning. But around 4:45 a.m., the air felt heavier. I woke up to a deafening silence  like the room itself was holding its breath. My heart sped up, my breathing quickened. It felt like the room was waiting for me to move.

Then my phone lit up with a notification on the headboard. The glow cast a reflection on my TV, and there  between my bed and Kevin’s  was the outline of someone standing.

I froze. The air felt thicker than ever. Slowly, I reached for my phone to turn on the flashlight, but before I could, I noticed the comforter on Kevin’s bed moving  like something had lain down, gotten up, and then settled back. I hesitated. The blanket rose and fell, slow and steady, like breathing. With every blink, I hoped it would stop, but it never did. I couldn’t turn on the flashlight  I couldn’t even move.

Finally, I opened my camera and started to record. The comforter kept rising and falling for about thirty seconds before I stopped. When I replayed the footage, the video was completely black. I couldn’t see the bed at all  just the rest of the room, frozen and still.

Then, at the very end of the clip, a faint whisper came through the speaker, too close, too real, as if it was right there beside me.

It said, “Don’t get up.”
