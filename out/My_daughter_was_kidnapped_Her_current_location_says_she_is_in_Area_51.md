It was like she had vanished from thin air. I tucked her into bed like I usually do, and she was gone by the morning. Completely disappeared. Not a hair was out of place. Whoever kidnapped had scary amount of skill. 

It’s been 10 years since Alice disappeared. She would have been 19. We kept all of Alice’s personal belongings in her room. Her room was like a time capsule, me and my wife only would go in to clean the dust off her shelves. My wife works the night-shift at a hospital and she had to go into work that night, and I decided to stay in Alice’s room. It was late in the evening and as I was sitting on Alice’s bed, my eye caught on to the memory box on the top shelf in the closet. I opened it, I probably hadn’t gone in there since she was a toddler. Seeing all the pictures of her as a baby brought tears to my eyes. The box was filled to the brim with memories, but when I got to the bottom, my heart felt like it stopped. I could feel the sweat dripping from my skin. At the bottom of the box was a tracker. When Alice was born we surgically installed a small tracker inside of her, and I had completely forgot it existed. If I had found it sooner, maybe I would have been able to save her. 

After pulling myself back together, I connected the GPS tracker to my computer. It took about 20 minutes to connect, considering how old it was. When it finally connected, I zoomed out on the grid, until I could finally see the bright green dot, Alice’s location. It said Alice was in Nevada. She was on the other side of the country. When I zoomed in closer, her location was right in the middle of Area 51. From what I know, it is a top secret military base. 

That night I carried my computer with the tracker attached to it, and I left for Nevada. I didn’t even tell my wife I was leaving. 

I only ever stopped for gas and 3 days later, I entered into Lincoln County Nevada. The desert was Barron in all directions. I drove until I reached the fence. A white sign on it read, Area 51. I knew I was at the right place. I kept driving until I could see a gate. It was wide open. I drove through it, fences were on both sides of me. I then reached another gate. This time guards, dressed in black tactical gear were blocking the gate. The gate was shut so I stopped, but I kept the car running. Both the guards came to the windows. They demanded I rolled down my window to talk to them. They probably thought I was one of those YouTubers.

“Sir, this is a heavily fortified military base, we ask you to leave immediately” one of the guards said.

I was quiet, I didn’t know how to respond. The giant assault rifles definitely intimidated me.

“Sir, if you do not leave, we will use lethal force” said the other guard. 

“Wait” I shouted. I then showed the guards the tracker. I showed them the computer screen and told them how my daughters location was inside there. They both looked at each other. They both raised there assault rifles to my face. Looking down the barrel, I could see the bullet. I then stepped on the gas, plowing through the gate. The bullet had just missed me. I was driving at at-least 100mp while bullets shattered my rear window. I kept driving until I saw the large building. I got out of the car and ran for the door on the side of the building. A sniper then blew off my right arm. The pain was excruciating but I didn’t stop. A river of blood followed behind me until I reached the door. I opened it and behind the door was a small room and about 10 men fully equipped with black military gear. I fell  onto the ground as blood poured out of my arm. One of them stepped forward and instead of killing me, covered my face with a black sheet. 

I must have passed out from the pain because when I woke up, I was tied to a chair in what looked like an interrogation room. It was dark in there, and the corners were lit with a faint green light. What was left of my arm had been completely stitched up and it looked like it had been healed. 

I waited there for about 5 hours until the door finally opened. A man in a lab coat entered the room. He sat in-front of me with a scowl on his face. 

“What’s going to happen to me?” I asked

“You’re going to be executed, Mr Kreedvile” he said to me.

“When?” I asked.

“As soon as we’re done talking,” he said. My execution wasn’t even on my mind. All I wanted to know was where my daughter was.

“Why do you have my daughter” I asked him. 

“10 years ago, we tracked a UFO that landed near your house, Now Mr Kreedvile, I want you to think back, Do you remember the tall figure standing on your roof the night Alice went missing?”

I was shocked. It all came back to me. That night, after I tucked Alice into bed, I could see out my window a silhouette of a creature on the roof. I knew it wasn’t human, the shape of the head, and the length of the fingers gave it away.

“The reason you couldn’t remember is because the U.S. Government has been inserting brain chips into newborn babies since the early 70s, and we completely erased the memory from your hippocampus. That night, Alice was exposed to an unknown alien particle, we abducted her to keep humanity safe.” the man said. 

I could feel my jaw drop, and the entire room echoed with my heartbeat. 

“Where’s my daughter” I snarled. He looked at me with a blank stare. Then guards walked into the room with guns.

“Are you ready, Head Scientist?” The guard said. 

“Were ready” the scientist said. The guard then approached me with the gun.

“Let me see my daughter!” I screamed. The scientist could see the desperation in my eyes.

“Oh alright, put the gun down” he said, “let him see his daughter” 

They then got me up, and led me down a hall to an elevator. The numbers on the elevator were written in Latin. They pushed the button for floor -13. When we got to the bottom, the door opened, revealing a long and wide corridor. The doors in the hall looked to be about 2 feet thick with steel. We stopped at the end of the hallway. The scientist entered a 16 digit code, which opened the door. We all stepped in, and when I saw who was infront of me, I broke down in tears. It was my Beautiful daughter, all grown up and mature. 

“Dad” she said. She ran up to me and hugged me. 

“Don’t get to close, Mr Kreedvile, she might infect you” the scientist said. I ignored his request. I got down on my knees and played with her hair, and gazed into her beautiful eyes. She hugged me again, but this time I felt something dig into my shoulder, she had bitten me. I then saw my veins transform into a dark purple color. I stood up and looked at the scientist.

“We told you not to get to close” he said.

I then said “All I wanted to see was my daughter, I’m ready for my execution”

“We’ll have to do it here, we don’t want to risk you infecting anyone else” he said.

The guard on his left then loaded the gun. 

“Before you shoot me, why are the walls stained red” I said. The scientist face went pale. “Why are the walls stained red” I said again

“Execute him” he shouted

The gunshot blasted throughout the entire room, and I heard my daughter scream. I collapsed to the ground, and the last thing I saw before a blacked out was my daughter’s beautiful blue eyes, they looked just like diamonds. I don’t know why the walls were stained red, maybe some things are just better left unanswered. All I know is the things a father will do for his daughter are unremarkable.
