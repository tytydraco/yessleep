I woke up to what felt like a long tree branch in my bed. While still groggy, I tried to brush it off with my hand, but couldn’t. Curious, I grabbed it and tried to feel what it was in the dark. It was long, like a rope. And then I realized that one end of it was sticking to the side of my neck. 

Then, I heard: JOOF! JOOF! JOOF! JOOF!  Slurp! Slurp! Slurp! Slurp! 

&#x200B;

Frightened, I jumped and turned on the bedside lamp. What I found was this organic cord on my bed. It looked like a thick tree branch but its texture felt like duck skin. One end was attached to my neck, but I couldn’t find the other end.

It didn’t hurt until I started tugging on it. Even more so when I tried to yank it off. 

&#x200B;

I was scared, but I swallowed a big gulp of my saliva to prevent a full-on panic. I followed this cord and it came from outside through a very small opening at the bottom of the sliding door to my bedroom’s balcony. I was suddenly overcome with a feeling of dread.

&#x200B;

You see, tonight was ‘bugs’ night’, which happened once every two months around here. I hurried home as soon as I saw flying ants circling lampposts at dusk, knowing that if I don’t close all the 59 openings of my house, my floor will be covered in thousands of squirming and dying insects as early as 7 PM. Unfortunately, I missed one opening.

&#x200B;

It was still dark outside. I turned on the balcony light and that was when I saw him.

&#x200B;

He appeared to be an old man with white hair sticking up. He was quatting, but if he stood up straight he would probably be 8 feet tall. His huge boney arms and legs made him look like a giant spider crab. 

His eyes were in a shape of a large egg and were completely black.

&#x200B;

His mouth was a long tube, which started out straight but eventually became this twisted cord that squeezed its way into my bedroom and attached itself to my neck.

&#x200B;

I collapsed to the ground while trying to process what I was seeing. Then, the old man's cheek started to puff and deflate, puff and deflate.

&#x200B;

JOOF! JOOF! JOOF! JOOF!  Slurp! Slurp! Slurp! Slurp! 

I could feel my blood being drained. This old man was sucking my blood! I then remembered a neighbor who was found dead in her home two months ago. She died due to a huge amount of blood loss and the police didn’t know what happened.

&#x200B;

I took out a knife from my cabinet. I slammed the knife hard. I knew I had to cut it off before my mind took everything in. 

&#x200B;

The cord retreated out of my room. The tube-mouth old man scampered sideways like a crab and disappeared into the darkness.

&#x200B;

I sanitized my neck and watched for signs of infection. I will go to the doctor at sunrise, but, I had to do something I had put off first. 

I screamed at the top of my lungs.

&#x200B;

Remember to close all the openings of your house on bug’s night. Something might find its way in.
