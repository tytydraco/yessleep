I wake up drenched in sweat after a restless sleep, due to an extremely vivid and frightening dream. I quickly get out of bed and head to the kitchen to quench my thirst. For some reason I can’t explain, I decide not to turn on the lights in the house. I walk in the dark, which is not completely absolute because of the streetlight or the moonlight coming through the window.

In the kitchen, it’s quite dark. I wouldn’t see anything if it weren’t for the light coming from the street. It casts a red and cold hue, almost gloomy. I grab a glass and fill it with tap water. As I raise it to drink, I sense something in the air; I’m not quite sure what it is, but it feels like an alert. I also feel that the air has grown denser, thicker, like ice or cold water.

The glow from the window seems to intensify as the minutes pass, turning more red, with a hue that grows brighter and livelier. Suddenly, I hear a sound that at first I can’t identify, but then I realize it’s the sound of breathing. A breath that gradually becomes loud, heavy, and strong.

I didn’t know where it was coming from; it was as if it were everywhere in the kitchen. Then I felt an urge to look at the corner of the sink, toward the edge of the wall, underneath the overhead cabinet, where it was darker than the rest of the counter and the kitchen.

That’s when I saw those large, shining, grotesque eyes. The huge mouth, like a smile stretching disproportionately wide, revealed a row of teeth. They were white as snow or the clouds in the sky. The gigantic fangs stood out, threatening me just by being visible.

I panicked and dropped the glass on the floor, shattering it into thousands of pieces. After I finished screaming, it thrust its head out of the shadows, revealing its baboon-like face. Then it spoke:

— Forget that book.

At that moment, I woke up all sweaty in my bed. I realized I had a very restless sleep by the state of the sheets. I got up and went to the kitchen; I didn’t need to turn on any lights because I could see through the dimness. Once in the kitchen, I saw it bathed in the light from the street.

A red light that cast a sinister and macabre aura over the room. I grabbed a glass and filled it with tap water, but when I was about to drink, I paused with the glass in the air. I felt the climax of tension hanging in the atmosphere. It was as if the air grew tenser with each passing minute, like ice or cold seawater.

The light from the window was turning a brighter, more vivid yellow, giving everything a gloomy appearance. Since I entered the kitchen, I had been avoiding looking at that dark corner above the counter, afraid of seeing the baboon again. But, driven by curiosity or whatever it was, I glanced at it and saw nothing.

Even so, I was startled by the voice of Elizabeth, my childhood friend, who suddenly appeared and asked if everything was alright.

— Yes, it is. — I replied.

— It doesn’t seem like it. Was it the monkey again?

I said nothing, but I didn’t need to; she saw from my face that it was. He haunts me, no matter what I do; the baboon always shows up in my dreams. Once, I was running during my morning jog, and out of nowhere, he appeared and tried to bite me. In another, he crawled out from under a table in an empty restaurant where I was, and he looked directly at me.

I always wake up right after his frights, caused by his sudden appearances. But what really makes me nervous is that he speaks. With a human voice, deep and heavy; I would even say gravelly. And it’s always, or almost always, the same phrase: “Forget that book,” or something similar. All this started when I accepted a very strange job.

A guy named Renato hired me to find and “rescue” a book from a municipal archive in my hometown, Cabedelo, but there’s a catch: he didn’t tell the name or give any description of this book.

I had already declined the job when he gave me an advance of twenty-five thousand reais.

A book from a municipal archive in my hometown, Cabedelo, but there’s a catch: he didn’t mention the name or give any description of this book. I had already declined the job when he offered me an advance of twenty-five thousand reais. You can’t let that kind of money slip away.

I infiltrated the archive using a fake name, pretending to work as an archive technician. It was difficult; I had to forge documents to get the job, but in the end, I gained access to the archive. Since then, I’ve been searching for evidence of a mysterious book in that place. Unfortunately, the more I search, the more it becomes clear that they keep no books there, only documents.

I thought about giving up and telling the contractor that this was all madness; however, when I remember the other twenty-five thousand, I immediately change my mind. Even so, the urge to leave that building and never return is strong. Not because the job is bad or because the people treat me poorly, although they do bother me in other ways.

But because of the experiences in that place. On my first day, I had already been introduced to all five employees in the building and assigned my duties. I was working in the box-boxes when I looked back and heard a broom being dragged across the floor.

I saw what I expected to see: a cleaner, but she had a hybrid face of a snake and a human. When I noticed that face, I almost jumped and quickly sat back down, simultaneously screaming loudly, causing the box to fall from my hands. 

In the blink of an eye, a normal-looking woman was in front of me, as she should have been. She stared at me in shock. I had to apologize and made up some nonsensical explanation to justify my fright. She obviously didn’t believe me, but resigned herself to return to her work, and I did the same. After that, the day was calm, but it wouldn’t be the last time I saw strange things in that place.

I arrived at work early to quickly tidy up the shelves and have time to rummage through the archivist’s office. I tried to avoid the archive staff; not that they were annoying to me, but I didn’t like their strange looks; it was as if they recognized me from a long time ago. This was the case since the first day, even though they never treated me like a longtime guy.
