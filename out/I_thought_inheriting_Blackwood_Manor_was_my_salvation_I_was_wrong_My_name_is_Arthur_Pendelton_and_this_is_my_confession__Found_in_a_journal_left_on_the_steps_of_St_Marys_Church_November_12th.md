The Ghost of Blackwood Manor

by Norsiwel



The biting November wind, smelling of rain and river sludge, whipped shreds of

newspaper around Arthur Pendelton’s ankles as he huddled in the recessed

doorway of a shuttered pawn shop. He pulled the collar of his threadbare coat

tighter, a gesture more symbolic than practical. Warmth was a memory, like the

taste of a hot meal or the feel of clean sheets. Years on the streets had

weathered him, leaching the hope from his eyes, leaving behind a weary

resignation etched onto his gaunt face. He was invisible, a ghost haunting the

periphery of a bustling city, until the polished black shoes stopped directly

in front of him. Arthur didn’t look up immediately; experience taught him

such encounters rarely ended well. Usually it was a demand to move along,

sometimes a hurled insult, occasionally misguided pity that stung worse than

contempt.



“Mr. Arthur Pendelton?” The voice was dry, precise, like rustling

parchment. Arthur flinched, slowly raising his head. A tall, thin man in an

impeccably tailored grey suit stood there, holding a leather briefcase. His

face was sharp, his eyes obscured by wire-rimmed spectacles that caught the

bleak afternoon light. He looked entirely out of place, a creature from a

different, cleaner world.



“Who’s asking?” Arthur rasped, his voice rough from disuse and the cold.

“My name is Silas Croft, of Croft, Harlaw, and Finch. Solicitors.” The man

extended a gloved hand, not to shake, but presenting a crisp white business

card. Arthur stared at it, then at the man’s impassive face. Solicitors? What

business could a lawyer possibly have with him? Unpaid fines? Vagrancy charges

finally catching up?



“I ain’t done nothing,” Arthur mumbled defensively, shrinking back into

the doorway.



Mr. Croft sighed, a faint puff of condensation in the frigid air. “Mr.

Pendelton, I assure you, this is not about any… transgression. Quite the

opposite. I have been searching for you for some time. It concerns the estate

of the late Mr. Elias Blackwood.”



Arthur frowned. “Never heard of him.”



“I wouldn’t expect you to have,” Croft replied smoothly. “Mr. Blackwood

was… a distant relation. Extremely distant. A fifth cousin, twice removed, I

believe the genealogical report concluded. He passed away recently, leaving no

direct heirs.” He paused, letting the silence hang. “Mr. Pendelton, Elias

Blackwood has named you the sole beneficiary of his estate. Specifically, his

property known as Blackwood Manor, and all its contents.”



Arthur blinked. Then he barked a short, harsh laugh. “Right. And I suppose

there’s a pot o’ gold at the end o’ the rainbow too? Look, mate, I

don’t know what game you’re playing…”



“It’s no game, I assure you,” Croft interrupted, his tone unchanging.

“Blackwood Manor is a substantial property on the outskirts of the city, near

Hemlock Woods. Furthermore, Mr. Blackwood’s will establishes a considerable

trust fund, generating a yearly stipend specifically designated for the

maintenance and upkeep of the property, payable to the resident owner.

Provided, of course,” he added, adjusting his spectacles, “certain

conditions are met.”



Arthur stared, his mind struggling to process the words. A manor? A stipend? It

sounded like a cruel joke, a fever dream born of cold and hunger. Yet, the

lawyer seemed utterly serious, his demeanor devoid of mockery.

“Conditions?” Arthur asked, suspicion warring with a nascent, terrifying

flicker of hope.



“Simple residency requirements, mostly,” Croft said vaguely. “The primary

stipulation is that the inheritor must reside in Blackwood Manor for no less

than three hundred and sixty days per calendar year. And they must personally

oversee the property’s upkeep using the provided funds. Failure to comply

results in forfeiture. The property would then pass to a historical

preservation society.” He glanced at Arthur’s ragged state. “The funds

are quite generous, Mr. Pendelton. More than sufficient for repairs, taxes,

and, shall we say, personal living expenses.”



Hope, fragile and unwelcome, fluttered in Arthur’s chest. A house. A home.

Warmth. Safety. An end to this wretched existence. Could it be real? “Why

me?” he whispered. “A fifth cousin…”



“Mr. Blackwood was… eccentric,” Croft offered, a hint of something

unreadable in his voice. “His specifications were precise. You are, according

to extensive research, the last living descendant, however remote. The law is

clear.” He opened his briefcase. “If you’ll accompany me to my office, we

can finalize the preliminary paperwork. I’ve taken the liberty of arranging

for some… immediate necessities. A meal, a change of clothes, temporary

lodging until the deed is transferred.”



Arthur hesitated for only a moment. What did he have to lose? The cold damp of

the doorway? The gnawing hunger? He nodded numbly, pushing himself to his feet

on stiff legs. As he followed the lawyer’s precise footsteps towards a

waiting black car, a shiver traced its way down his spine that had nothing to

do with the cold. Blackwood Manor. 



Even the name sounded heavy, shadowed. The first sight of Blackwood Manor stole Arthur’s breath, lodging it somewhere cold in his chest. It loomed out of the misty twilight, perched on a rise overlooking the dense, dark sprawl of Hemlock Woods. It wasn’t merely a

house; it was a declaration carved in stone and shadow, a Gothic behemoth of

steep gables, wrought-iron widow’s walks, and stone gargoyles that leered

from the eaves like frozen sentinels.  



Stained-glass windows, dark and opaque, punctuated the granite facade. The grounds were wildly overgrown, tangled vines strangling ancient oaks, thorny bushes clawing at the winding gravel drive. It looked less like a home and more like a mausoleum waiting for its final

occupant.



“Impressive, is it not?” Mr. Croft remarked dryly, breaking the silence in

the car.



“It’s… big,” Arthur managed, feeling unnerved. The sheer scale of it,

the oppressive weight of its age and neglect, was daunting.

Croft produced a heavy, ornate iron key. “The utilities are functional,

though basic. The stipend funds will transfer to an account in your name within

the week. A list of recommended local tradesmen is included in the

documentation packet, should you require assistance with immediate repairs.



Though,” he added, handing the key to Arthur, whose hand trembled slightly as

he took it, “Mr. Blackwood handled much of the basic upkeep himself.” He

gave Arthur a final, assessing look. “Remember the residency clause, Mr.

Pendelton. Three hundred and sixty days. The trust requires quarterly

verification. Good luck.” And with that, the lawyer got back into his car and

was driven away, leaving Arthur alone on the gravel drive before the immense,

silent house, the iron key feeling unnervingly heavy in his palm.



The massive oak door groaned open into a cavernous entry hall. Dust motes

danced in the slivers of grey light filtering through a high, arched window

depicting a grim biblical scene in faded blues and blood reds. The air was

cold, still, and thick with the scent of decay, old paper, and something

else… something faintly metallic and unpleasant. Furniture lay shrouded in

white sheets, ghostly shapes in the gloom. A grandfather clock stood silent

against one wall, its pendulum motionless. Every footstep Arthur took on the

marble floor echoed unnervingly in the oppressive silence.



The first few days were a blur of disbelief and burgeoning comfort. Arthur

explored the labyrinthine corridors, the countless dusty rooms filled with

forgotten relics. He found a functioning kitchen, stocked it with food using

the generous advance Croft had provided, and reveled in the simple miracle of

cooking a hot meal. He chose a bedroom,one less imposing than the master

suite, which felt colder than the rest of the house,and spent hours simply

lying on the soft mattress, soaking in the warmth from the sputtering radiator,

listening to the unfamiliar silence, broken only by the settling groans of the

ancient structure. It was paradise compared to the streets. A gilded cage,

perhaps, given the residency clause, but a cage with soft beds and hot food.



The stipend arrived as promised, a staggering sum that made Arthur feel dizzy.

He hired cleaners to tackle the worst of the grime, plumbers to fix the

rattling pipes, and a gardener to begin taming the savage grounds. Yet, he felt

a strange reluctance to let anyone linger too long, an irrational

possessiveness coupled with a vague sense of unease. 



He dismissed them perhaps sooner than he should have, the silence descending once more like a shroud. He found the first list tucked inside a heavy ledger in the library,

presumably left by Elias Blackwood. It detailed routine maintenance: ‘Clear

gutters,’ ‘Check roof tiles – south gable loose,’ ‘Oil hinges,third-floor corridor.’ 



Standard enough. But subsequent lists, found weekly in the same spot, grew stranger. 

‘Prune the nightshade by the west wall,use silver shears only (in workshop).’ 

‘Ensure the attic hatch remains bolted from this side,reinforce bolt.’ 

‘Leave bowl of milk on landing of back stairs,Tuesdays only.’ ‘Wind music box in drawing room – keep wound.’ Most unsettling was the recurring instruction: ‘The Lilith Window

in the master study,keep curtains drawn. Always.’



Curiosity warred with a primal fear. He found the silver shears, heavy and

ornate, in the cluttered workshop. He pruned the poisonous nightshade, its dark

purple flowers seeming to watch him. He checked the attic hatch; it was secured

with a massive iron bolt that looked far newer than the surrounding wood. He

left the milk, feeling foolish, and found the bowl empty the next morning, with

no sign of a cat or other stray animal. He located the music box, a delicate

porcelain thing that played a haunting, melancholy tune, and dutifully kept it

wound.



He avoided the master study, the room containing the ‘Lilith Window’, for

weeks. But the house itself seemed to draw him towards it. Cold drafts emanated

from under its door, and sometimes, late at night, he thought he heard faint

scratching sounds from within. He felt watched, constantly. Shadows seemed to

stretch and deepen in the corners of his vision. Whispers, like dry leaves

skittering on glass, seemed to echo just beyond the range of hearing. The

isolation, once a comfort, began to feel oppressive, the silence pregnant with

unspoken things.



He found Elias Blackwood’s journals hidden beneath a loose floorboard in the

library. The entries were sporadic, written in a cramped, agitated hand. They

spoke not of loneliness, but of a ‘burden,’ a ‘vigil,’ a ‘duty’

inherited with the house. Elias wrote of ‘the guest upstairs,’ the

‘watcher behind the glass.’ He detailed the rituals,the milk, the music

box, the drawn curtains – as appeasements. 



‘It grows restless when the routine is broken,’ one entry read. ‘The sounds become unbearable. Must maintain the peace.’ Another, near the end, simply stated: ‘The silence is

worse now. It waits. It knows I am failing.’



Arthur felt a cold dread seep into his bones. This wasn’t just an eccentric

inheritance; it was a trap. The house, the money,they were payment for a

service. He was not the master of Blackwood Manor; he was its new

groundskeeper, its new custodian, its new warden. 

But warden of what? The scratching from the master study grew louder, more insistent. The feeling of being watched intensified, becoming a palpable pressure against his skin.



Sleep offered little escape, filled with dreams of shadowy figures and leering

gargoyles come to life. He began talking to himself, startled by the sound of

his own voice in the echoing halls. He neglected the routine cleaning, focusing

only on the strange tasks from Elias’s lists, driven by a growing fear of

what might happen if he stopped. 



The generous stipend felt like blood money, binding him to this place. He could leave, forfeit everything, return to the cold anonymity of the streets. But the streets seemed less terrifying now than the unseen presence sharing his gilded cage. And a darker thought surfaced:

what if leaving meant unleashing whatever Elias had kept contained?



One rain-lashed evening, the scratching from the study became frantic,

accompanied by a low, guttural moan that vibrated through the floorboards.

Arthur stood outside the heavy oak door, trembling, the key (found hidden in

Elias’s desk) cold in his hand. He had to know. He couldn’t live like this,

tormented by the unknown. Taking a ragged breath, he turned the key.



The lock clicked loudly in the silence. He pushed the door open. The room was

pitch black, the heavy velvet curtains over the Lilith Window completely

blocking any light. The air was stagnant, thick with the metallic scent he’d

noticed on his first day, now stronger, mingled with something else, something

sickly sweet like overripe fruit. The scratching stopped. The moaning died

away. An intense, expectant silence filled the room.



Arthur fumbled for the light switch, his fingers brushing against the cold

wall. He found it, flicked it. Nothing happened. The bulb was either dead or

the wiring faulty. He took a step inside, his eyes straining to adjust. Faint

moonlight filtered around the edges of the thick curtains, revealing… very

little.

 

There was a heavy desk, an overturned chair, scattered papers. But the

center of the room held his attention. Claw marks, deep and jagged, scored the

wooden floor, converging near the window. The walls were covered in bizarre,

swirling patterns and symbols drawn in… something dark. Dried flakes of it

littered the floor. There was no furniture apart from the desk and chair, no

sign of long habitation, yet the feeling of occupancy was overwhelming,

ancient, and deeply unwell.



He crept towards the window, the source of the prohibition. The Lilith Window.

Why keep it covered? What did it overlook? Or, more terrifyingly, what looked

\*in\*? His hand reached for the heavy velvet curtain. Elias’s warnings

screamed in his mind. Keep curtains drawn. Always.



He hesitated, his heart pounding against his ribs like a trapped bird. Then, a

floorboard creaked softly behind him.



Arthur spun around, his breath catching in his throat. Nothing. Just the

oppressive darkness and the heavy silence. But the feeling of being watched was

no longer vague; it was specific, focused, emanating from the blackest corner

of the room. He wasn’t alone.



Panic seized him. He scrambled back towards the door, fumbling for the handle.

As his fingers closed around the cool brass, he risked one last glance towards

the Lilith Window. Had the curtain moved? Did he see a flicker of movement

behind the thick velvet, a suggestion of a pale shape, something tall and

impossibly thin, briefly silhouetted against the fabric before vanishing?

He slammed the door shut, turned the key, his breath coming in ragged gasps.



He leaned against the solid oak, trembling violently. He knew now. The stipend

wasn't for paint and gardeners. It was the price of his silence, his

complicity. Elias hadn't just lived here; he'd been guarding something, feeding

it, appeasing it, keeping it hidden behind a curtained window. And now, that

duty was Arthur's. He was inextricably bound to Blackwood Manor, not just by

legal clauses, but by the terrifying secret hidden within its walls. He was the

keeper.



Months bled into a year, then another. Arthur Pendelton became a recluse,

rarely venturing beyond the overgrown gates of Blackwood Manor. The locals

whispered about the strange man in the decaying house, just as they had

whispered about Elias Blackwood before him. He grew pale, thin, his eyes

holding the haunted look of one who knows too much and sleeps too little.



He performed the rituals meticulously: the milk on the stairs, the silver shears

on the nightshade, the winding of the music box whose tune now seemed to mock

him with its melancholy beauty. He reinforced the bolt on the attic hatch. He

never again opened the door to the master study, though he often stood outside

it, listening to the silence that was somehow more terrifying than the

scratching had been.



He kept the curtains drawn over the Lilith Window. Always. He used the

stipend, ensuring the roof didn’t collapse, the plumbing didn’t fail

entirely, the grounds didn’t completely reclaim the house. Maintenance.

Upkeep. His purpose.



One evening, as dusk settled like grave dust over the manor, Arthur stood in

the chilling drawing room, winding the porcelain music box. Its delicate,

tinkling melody filled the oppressive silence. As the final notes faded, he

caught a flicker of movement reflected in the polished surface of a nearby

grandfather clock,the one that never ran. 

A pale, elongated shape seemed to glide past the doorway in the hall, impossibly tall, impossibly thin, vanishing before he could fully register it. He didn’t flinch. He didn’t cry out. He simply stood there, clutching the music box key, his face a mask of weary

resignation. 



He was the caretaker. This was his home. This was his burden. The silence resettled, heavy and watchful, and Arthur Pendelton, the ghost of Blackwood Manor, prepared to leave out the milk.
