“HUAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!” Echoes through the halls. The roar of a man in pain, voice almost devolving to that of a beast.

I stop mid-step, but Marie continues down the stairs—unflinching.

“What was that?” I ask, the sound still reverberating through me. She stops partway down and turns to me with a puzzled look.

“What are you talking about?” she asks in response, an eyebrow raised, climbing back up the stairs to me.

“That—that scream. That yell, what was it?” I ask again, backing away from her. She looks me up and down, and a look of realization dawns on her face.

“Oh, dear, that must be one of your hallucinations. Another ailment inflicted by your work,” she explains with a reassuring tone. 

“But… I heard it! I heard it clear as day!” I insist, backing away further. She frowns and takes a tentative step forward.

“Honey, please. It’s a hallucination, of course it would feel real. You need to eat something, darling. Please, come down and eat with me, you’ll feel much better once you do.” she says, gesturing down the stairs, her face pleading.

“Oh… right, that makes sense. Alright, sorry, I’ll follow you.” I say, dropping my guard, and stepping forward.

We go down the stairs in the main hall, and once we’re down she leads me through a set of doors underneath the stairwell.

The dining hall we enter is huge, a great hall that has shelves of books lining every wall, making it feel more like a library. 

Large and ornate chandeliers hang from the ceiling. Light beams in through massive stained glass windows—windows depicting angels, knights, and crucifixes.

In the middle of the hall was a long wooden table. It was small in comparison to the hall—looking like it could only fit six at the most. It has no chairs, having a bench built into either side, like a picnic table.

“Take a seat at the table, dear. I’ll bring the food out shortly. What would you like?” she asks, leading me to the bench.

“Um… Bacon and eggs?” I query, taking my seat. 

“Bacon and eggs.” She repeats with a smile, before walking off into some back room, her cerulean gown trailing behind her.

As I sit in the bench, taking in the intricate lace of the white tablecloth, I start to try to replay my last memories in my head, but I’m still reeling from the scream.

It sounded so real, so bloodcurdling, and so… familiar. Like I’ve heard it before. It fills me with an odd sense of guilt. Why is that? 

Regardless, I need to get my wits about me. What do I remember last?

I remember Rob’s party—The music, the drinking, the tree that caught on fire… and I think I remember a bit after that.

I have foggy memories of going to work with a hangover, flipping burgers while trying to stay alive. And then… it’s a blank.

I’ve got vague ideas. It feel like… like there’s something I’ve forgotten, something I need to remember. But all I come up with is vague feelings like that I maybe went to a wedding, or that I read something, but that’s it—the details escape me.

What did I do these last eleven years? How did I manage this? A castle, a wife, these clothes? And I’m a chemist? I flunked science class, but I’m supposed to be some brilliant chemist? 

This is crazy. What the hell am I supposed to do? 

Wait, what about-

“Where’s my family?”  I ask immediately, as she comes into the room holding a large silver tray.

“I’m right here, darling. We don’t have any kids yet, but-“

“My parents. And my sister, Claire. Where are they? I need to speak to them.” I say, rising.

I would never have gone too far from them. They can catch me up to speed. I need a face I recognize. I need my family.

“Dear,” she says, setting the tray down, and putting a hand out. “Please. Take a seat. Eat. Then we can talk.” 

I look down at her hand, then back up to her eyes. Soft eyes, blue eyes, beautiful eyes. I take her hand, and we sit together.

I dig into my food alongside Marie, and it’s amazing. Eggs and bacon, greasy, salty, delicious. The perfect comfort food to turn this nightmare of a morning around. I reach for the drink she set out, and stop. 

It looks like milk, but it’s in a small vial, barely more than a shot. Marie puts a hand on my outstretched one.

“Not yet, honey, that’s for after we eat,” she says with a smile.

“What is it?” I ask, growing unnerved again.

“It’s our medicine, honey. It’s actually your greatest creation, and the subject of your work,” she explains, squeezing my hand tight. “It’s what keeps the two of us healthy, you see? We met when you were working on it actually, since we were both afflicted by the same ailment. As was your family, but…”

“But?” I insisted, hoping she wasn’t implying what she undoubtedly was.

“You didn’t make it in time. I’m sorry, dear,” she discloses.

“So, then, they’re all…? All of them? My mom, my dad, even Claire?”

“I’m so sorry, honey. I know this must be hard for you to learn. I know from your perspective they were healthy just moments ago.”

“I-I need a minute, please.” I say, getting up.

“Wait, honey, you need to take your medicine! It’s important you take it after you eat—every morning!” She insists.

“Every morning?” I echo, picking up the vial.

I stare at the liquid inside. It’s a viscous and chalky white substance, that leaves a film on the glass as I turn it in my hand.

This is my life’s work? A medicine—for a disease? One that killed my family?

And I have it, too?
