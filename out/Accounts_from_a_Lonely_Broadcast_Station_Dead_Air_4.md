Sometimes I hated these security cameras. Let me tell you, as soon as we put these suckers up around the watchtower, I’ve had to see the worst imaginable bullshit day and night. One of the cameras points to the long driveway, another to the shed. Those ones aren’t too bad. But the one that points into the woods? Oh man, that one can just fuck *right* off. I’ve seen strange figures floating upside-down in the woods, mutated animals that shouldn’t exist, living plants trying to crawl out of the ground. The other day, I saw a deer with its head on backwards, staring directly into the camera for an hour before I started throwing rocks just to chase it away. Worst part was, it started throwing the rocks *back.*

It’s gotten so much worse lately.

The day after the fog reached the town, I saw a procession of pale figures wandering blindly through the trees in a straight line. I called the police chief, asking what we should do in case these people were still alive. He said it was too late, and I had to let it go. Sometimes, the camera picks up another one joining the ghost parade, all heading towards the same direction.

But just this once, I was thankful. After all, I wouldn’t have noticed that Daniel was running through the woods if not for that view into the trees. It saved us both a bit of time that night. 

&#x200B;

Once I got Dan into the broadcasting room and locked the place up safely, he decided to stay. I tried to get him to let me drive him home, but he said he didn’t want to be by himself all night. My shift was almost over anyways. Later that evening, when Finn arrived for his turn in the watchtower, Daniel filled him in on all the details. 

“You were out there? Up the mountain at *night?”* Finn didn’t even let Dan finish his story before he was already fussing, ready to hit him with a rolled up newspaper. “*Buddy.”*

Dan put up his hands defensively. “Yes and yes, okay? I think I was sleepwalking…I-I don’t know, I’ve never done it before. All I know is that I was in my bed one moment and the next, I was standing in the middle of the woods and something was *chasing* me.” 

Finn was pacing back and forth. I could tell from the frustrated grit of his teeth and the wrinkle between his eyebrows that he was craving a cigarette right now just to get through the stress of having to deal with a couple of dimwits like us. His hair was getting grayer every day. Sorry, buddy. This mess is all yours.

He pinched the bridge of his crooked, twice-broken nose, letting the stress wash out of him. “So you’ve really never been a sleepwalker?” He asked as he sipped from a travel mug. 

“No, never.” Daniel shrugged. “This was the first time in my whole life. Well, there was this one time when I was a kid and apparently I took off all my clothes and crawled on top of the fridge, but I didn’t remember any of–”

Finn rolled his eyes and gave an annoyed groan, his shoulders sinking. “Dan, enough, we’re being serious right now. Did you do *anything* different yesterday? Take any medication…drink anything? Be honest.” 

I sat quietly and looked between the two of them while Daniel was visibly scanning through his thoughts for an answer.

“No. But I did have a weird dream.” He said. Finn watched him silently with an expression as hard as stone. “I dreamt that I was floating next to dozens of other people. We were all traveling toward something…A glowing light, sort of pink in color. The others fell into it, one by one. When I was the only one left, that’s when I woke up.”

Finn’s expression was stern and hard to read. I imagine that mine was not. That didn’t sound good, right? Dan had *just* told me that one of the creatures from the woods had been trying to lure him in the day before, and now his dreams were doing the same. And the sleepwalking…It made me think of her. Jenny. She was a sleepwalker too. It made me think of her stuffed into that tree, twigs in her mouth, every bone in her body broken, dead and cold. Sweet Jesus, I didn’t want to find Daniel like *that*.   

I remembered the last time I saw Jennifer alive, how we fought and said such horrible, mean things to one another. She told me to leave and never come back. I told her I didn’t love her anymore. Would my last words to Daniel be just as cruel?

“We’re going to have to put a shock collar on you so you can’t leave your apartment at night.” I chuckled, pushing down those feelings of guilt and worry. We banished the terrible thoughts with humor, even if it was irresponsible. 

“What if I figure out how to take it off?” Daniel challenged. 

“Then we’ll put mittens on you.” 

“Well, what if I take the mittens off?”

“Fuck, I don’t know, man, we’ll strap you to your mattress.”

And then Finn, without missing a beat, decided to join the conversation. “Kinky.” He commented with a perfectly straight face, sipping his coffee again. So much for ‘being serious’. Daniel was laughing, I was not.

“*Fine,* then I’ll glue him to the floor! How’s that? My point is…Dan, my dude, we gotta make sure you never do this again. Okay? You got really, really, *really* lucky this time…but next time? Fuck man, what if something happens to you out there? What if we lose you? If-if you disappear and we find you out there ripped in half or-or *stuffed in a fucking tree like–*” I choked. I didn’t want to cry, but there it was - I couldn’t help it. I almost lost my best friend, *again,* and even making jokes and teasing one another didn’t make it all better. I bit my lip and turned away so the others couldn’t see my face.

Dan went silent. I imagined all three of us were thinking the same thing. Every year, things got harder and harder and harder for us up here. When would we reach the limit? 

When would we be just another set of numbers in a list of former emergency broadcasters? 

&#x200B;

All three of us heard a loud, ear-splitting drone. There was a rumble from below us, the stilts of the tower whining and shivering in protest. I braced myself, worried for a second that we were about to topple over before we turned our attention to the front window. 

A tree had fallen in the woods, and another was starting to lean. It cracked and fell to the ground with another loud boom that shook our little corner of the mountain. We heard that bellow again, followed by the view of giant, twisted antlers peeking above the distant pines, covered in blood. 

The beast was hunting again, closer than usual. He was making himself known. And somewhere deeper in the forest, there was that glow again - magenta in color, pulsating from somewhere between the trees. Daniel’s eyes went wide, the warm color starting to drain from his face.

“I think you two should go.” Finn clapped a hand down on Dan’s shoulder. It was a very, very rare moment of gentleness from him. “I’ll take over, I’ll work more on that shed. You two get some rest before your shift. Go…get some late night pancakes or something. Take a drive. Whatever it takes to clear your heads. I’ll keep an eye on Rudolph out there, but he can’t break the treeline on a clear night. Remember that.” 

Finn was right. He always stressed the importance of keeping a cool head around here - most of the former employees were gone because they had let their fear take hold. It was the death of them, and it would be the death of us too if we didn’t keep it together. 

&#x200B;

Dan and I got into my rusty old pickup truck and drove out of town, down the dark twisting path that circled the mountains. We just needed a breather - an hour away from Pinehaven. Daniel insisted on grabbing his camera and bringing it with him, taking photos of the drive and the Christmas decorations we saw on the way. We stopped for some fast food and decided to eat it in the parking lot while looking out at the quiet streets of a town that wasn’t ours. 

“Okay, one more.” Daniel pointed at me with a french fry. “Repeat after me. *Doce de la noche.”*

“D…Do-chee deli no-chee?”

“Evelyn, no. Listen. *Doce de la noche.* Your ‘e’ is too sharp.*”*

“Do-si-do nacho cheese.” 

“Okay, now you’re just being a dumbass on purpose.”

I cackled like a weird little witch as Daniel tossed a crumpled-up napkin at the side of my head, watching it bounce off and fall somewhere in between the seats. 

“So, catch me up, did I miss anything interesting yesterday?”  He was shoving french fries in his mouth as if he hadn’t eaten in days. 

I shrugged, trying to recall all the events of the day. “I mean, other than finding you running around in the woods like Sasquatch? Nothing too spectacular. I heard a lot of activity out there, but I didn’t see much, except some movement on the security cameras. I think there’s something new stomping around, but I didn’t get a good look at it. It was fleshy, though, had a lot of limbs.”

Daniel shivered. “Ugh, don’t say that. I was just *out* there.” 

“All the more reason to stay in your bed, nerd.” I teased him, sipping my drink. “Uh…Oh! Bartholomew bit me again. Shitty little bastard man. Lookit’ my finger.”

Dan inspected the bandage around my middle finger. “Oh, you poor sweet *baby."* He said sarcastically. "He wouldn't bite you if you didn't piss with him so much.”

“Ugh, I *knowwwww*!” I tossed a french fry at Dan. We both laughed, and Daniel threw a fry right back that hit me square on the nose. Great. Now I had a greasy, salty nose *and* a dirty truck. “I can’t help it. I *live* to be a pest. Speaking of pests, though, there’s been a fuck-ton of bugs on the windows since yesterday. I counted about 460 wasps before I got bored.” 

Daniel made a small ‘hm’ of interest, chewing his burger. “I thought all the bugs were supposed to be dead and in hell by now.” 

“You and me both.” I said with a snort. I liked this. We weren’t talking about the fog, we weren’t talking about what happened that night. I knew it was in Daniel’s mind, as it always was, but just this once, I didn’t want him to obsess over it. Just this once, I wanted him to eat a fuckin’ burger in peace. 

&#x200B;

Soon after, we went back home and I walked with Dan up to his apartment. We talked on our way up the stairs, trying to distract ourselves with holiday decorating plans. I insisted on getting Big Boy’s head mounted and putting Christmas lights on it, but Daniel quickly reminded me that even if we could take down the beast, his head probably wouldn’t fit in the tiny building. Then, when we got to Dan’s door, he reached into his bag and pulled out a spare set of keys. 

“Here. Just in case you ever…you know, need to get into my place when I’m not here. Or if there’s an emergency or if I go missing or–” 

“Thanks, Dan.” I interrupted him, taking the keys. “I think we’ll be okay. But thanks.” 

We said goodnight and parted ways, and for the first time, I was more afraid for my friend out here than I was afraid for the one in the tower tonight. 

&#x200B;

When I fell into bed, I had a dream. It started out as a memory.

*We were parked at the edge of the woods, my dad and I, sitting in the bed of a pickup truck. I looked over at him: his thick red beard, his sun-tanned face covered in freckles. He was wearing his coat, orange with yellow stripes. We were watching smoke rise in the distance.* 

*“Why are you setting fires in the woods?” I asked curiously, kicking my little legs back and forth. One of my shoes was untied. “Won’t the animals get hurt?”* 

*He laughed. It was a deep belly laugh, quiet and low. “Don’t you worry now, gingersnap, none of the animals are gettin’ hurt. It’s called a ‘controlled burn’. We have to do them now and then to get rid of things that are old and dead so that they don't cause problems.”* 

*“Hm.” I scrunched my mouth to one side. I assumed he meant dead trees, dead plants. “Problems like…wildfires?”* 

*My dad stared out into the trees, slowly nodding. “Yeah, baby, like wildfires.” He was quiet for a long moment before he looked at me and smiled. “Here, I’ve got something for ya.”* 

*He jumped down and started to pull the sleeves of his coat off, a thermal shirt underneath. He handed it to me - it was heavy, smelling like smoke, gasoline, and pine. “It’s big now, but you’ll grow into it.” He said. “You hold onto that, ya hear? One day it’ll be an old antique and … and it’ll remind you of me when you’re grown.”* 

*I was too young to catch the sadness in his voice, that low Virginia drawl laced with years of regret. The…finality of it all. I looked down at the coat with a smile, bringing it up to my face and closing my eyes. “Thanks, papa.” I said, breathing in the scent of the woods…the fires. “I’ll take good care of–”*

*When I looked up, he wasn’t there anymore. An ill wind blew, tickling the back of my neck and rustling the dead autumn leaves on the ground. I was looking into the trees: miles and miles of untamed wilderness, smoke rising from its depths. And right there at the treeline where the forest met the empty dirt, a mountain lion stood completely still, watching me from afar. It had a new face…a miserable, painfully twisted human face.*

When I woke up, I felt a draft. The crack in my window had gotten even bigger and the freezing wind was whistling through it. I sat up quickly, relieved to see four apartment walls. But I didn’t have long to feel that comfort before I noticed something in the room with me…A shadow in the corner. It was hunched over on all fours, thin and emaciated. It shivered, weak and cold, and I could see the glow of eyes against a face that was obscured by the dark.

“Get out.” I hissed, my heart racing. I grabbed my pillow and threw it into the corner at its feet. “Get OUT!”

When I turned on the light, it was gone. He was gone. But was he ever, really? 

&#x200B;

If you’re reading this, I need you to understand something. I’m only sharing this dream because I need you to know why I did what I did next. All I could think about was that night after graduation, about how badly I wanted to forget that grotesque, terrible face. Once upon a time, I drank my life away just to forget the look in his eyes as he begged for death…And how he groaned and whined with two separate voices when I wouldn’t give it to him.

I grabbed the tequila from the kitchen and I drank so much that I made myself sick. Did I enjoy it? Fuck no. I hated every second of it and I felt nothing but shame, but it was the only way to finally get myself to fall *asleep.* I didn’t have any dreams for the rest of the night. Sure, I woke up feeling like shit. I knew I would. But for a very brief moment in time, my brain was completely quiet.

&#x200B;

When morning arrived and I got ready for work, nursing a terrible headache the whole time, Daniel was already waiting at the bottom of the stairwell. You know, to be honest, a part of me was afraid that he wasn’t going to be there. But he looked okay. He was freshly bathed, well-rested, he had his shoes on the right feet and everything. When I got closer, I realized he had a bow tie with Christmas lights on it - dear lord, he was charging up. He was about to change into his most powerful, final form. One thing you have to know about Danny: he’s absolutely *insufferable* around the holidays. 

“Hey, Sleeping Beauty. Any impromptu hikes last night?” I asked as I met him at the bottom of the stairs. 

“Nope. Slept like a baby.” He said proudly, snapping his suspenders. “How about you? Did you get some rest, bud?” 

I heaved a big sigh and nodded my head. “Yeah, I slept pretty good. Hey, uhh, think we’ve still got doughnuts at the station? I could go for a doughnut right now. I could go for *several* doughnuts.” 

We took my car to the station, even though it smelled like day-old french fries. When we arrived, we found Finn on a ladder, fiddling with something outside the shed.

“What’s goin’ on?” Daniel asked, squinting at a small device stuck to the wall. “New security cameras?” 

“Yep.” Finn said, hopping down off the ladder and clapping his hands together. He had a cigarette hanging out of his mouth, clenched between his teeth. “One on the tree? Right over there? Totally busted. Something must have caught on to what it was and destroyed it last night…Found it in pieces, tossed into the clearing.” 

“Like it wanted you to find it.” Daniel said softly. His eyes were focused on the treeline - one specific spot in particular, to be exact. There was nothing there but the shadows cast by the pines and the glitter of falling snow. I noticed the way his expression turned uneasy and I gave him a quick pat on the arm. 

“Come on, champ.” I said. “Let’s go inside.” 

Before we could step away, Finn cleared his throat and stepped out in front of me, turning his eyes to Daniel for just a moment. “Dan, go on ahead. Evelyn and I need to talk for a second.” 

I noticed the way Dan looked between the two of us, as if wondering if something was wrong. I thought the exact same thing. He didn’t argue, though, and moments later he was giving us a quick grin before walking back up to the tower alone, looking back only once or twice in suspicion. 

I folded my arms to fight off the cold, raising my eyebrows at Finn. “What do we need to talk about?” I asked quietly. “If it’s about Dan and the fog last weekend, I think he’s feeling a little bit–” 

“You’re drinking again.” Finn’s words were blunt, direct, so sure of himself. He looked down at me with a stern brow and tight lips, his jaw clenched. When I opened my mouth to respond, he put up a single finger to silence me. “Ah, ah. And don’t try arguing with me this time. Your eyes are bloodshot, you *smell,* it’s below freezing out here and you’re sweating. I can tell when someone’s got a hangover - *you’ve* got a hangover, ma'am.” 

I fidgeted nervously on the spot, looking down at the snow as I crossed my arms tighter. “I…I had a bad night. A couple of bad nights. I’m over it.” 

Finn took a step forward, his face assertive but not unkind. He showed his compassion in very…*harsh* ways sometimes, but that straightforward attitude was how I always knew he was looking out for us. “Lyn. I’m not gonna tell you anything you don’t already know.” He spoke quietly. “Recovery isn’t linear. You know that, you’ve been here before. But you have *got* to let us help you, and that means taking this seriously and making a real effort starting *right* now. This job? It takes all of us.” 

I shuffled my feet, hands tucking themselves inside the pockets of my coat. Briefly, I glanced around to make sure Daniel had gone back into the building. “I, um…I don’t want Dan to know.” I admitted. 

“And I won’t tell him.” Finn promised me, standing up straight again. He put a heavy hand on my shoulder. “But when you go home, if you get the temptation to drink, I want you to *call me* instead. I’ll talk you through it…Not as an officer, not as a mentor, just as a friend. Got it? …Now, I’m headin’ out. I’ve got ranger duty in the woods today, so the two of you stay out of trouble.” 

“Yeah. Yeah, we will.” I drew my coat in closer, turning around. “Um…thanks, Finn. Good luck today.” 

“Don’t need it.” He said confidently, flicking his cigarette butt into the woods. “Now go inside and do your job, kiddo. It's cold as a witch's left ass-cheek out here. And drink some water for a change, will ya?”

&#x200B;

When I got up the stairs, I relayed Finn’s message to Daniel, who promptly responded with: “Oh, I’m going to get into *so* much trouble today.” I was glad to see his spirit returning.

We put up our coats, did the weather and news broadcast together, and spent the rest of the morning talking about…better things. We talked about the holidays, we talked about what ‘ranger duties’ Finn could have had and whether or not it included battling animals in hand-to-hand combat. I sketched a little picture of Finn punching an elk in the throat and we hung it up on the cork board. 

It’s strange, isn’t it? This codependent relationship we have with this tower. Everything about Pinehaven sucks and I hate it and I wish I could just *burn it to the ground*, but when we’re up here, we have a purpose. We have something to occupy our minds. Up here, we’re important. 

&#x200B;

Around noon, we got a call. I answered it, half-expecting it to be someone asking more about the missing people. Instead, all I heard was a high-pitched buzz. I tapped on my headset, thinking maybe it was just a little interference. 

“Hello?” I called out. Daniel was looking at me with narrowed eyes, then glanced at the console to try seeing the number. It didn’t show up - rather, it was just seven zeroes on the screen. 

I tapped the headset again, and immediately felt a sharp sting to the inside of my ear. *Jesus Christ, it hurt.* With a yelp, I tore the headset off and put a hand up to my ear, feeling something *moving* and fluttering inside my head. I could feel it in my sinuses, making my eyes water and sting. Dan was already standing up and trying to pull my hands away. 

“What happened?” He asked in a panic, surely remembering what happened to *him* on his first day of work all those years ago. “Can you still hear m–”

“*Yes, I can hear you, there’s something inside my ear!”* I yelled back, slapping the side of my head to try and dislodge it. “*Get it out,* ***get it out!”***

Daniel grabbed my head, both hands squishing the sides of my skull to hold me still as he looked inside my ear canal. “Okay, okay, I’m looking! Can you try to hold still for *two* seconds, please?”

I did as I was told. Ugh, the feeling of something *wiggling* down inside my ear was the worst sensation I could possibly describe…Well, maybe second place. It was like an itch I couldn’t scratch, chilling my spine and tickling the tubes and cavities I couldn’t reach. Just as bad was the feeling of Daniel sticking a finger in the side of my head and digging around, trying to grab something. 

“I think I got it.” Dan exclaimed, quickly pulling something out and cupping it in his hands. I heard the buzz a little weaker now, and that fluttering sensation was gone - all it left behind was a sharp stinging against my tragus.

“...It’s a wasp.” Daniel looked between his fingers, getting his eye way too close to the insect for comfort. “Oh shit, it’s angry.”

He quickly headed for the fire escape, disabling the alarm and slipping outside to release the insect before it started stinging him too. I followed after him and propped open the fire escape, a hand over my ear as it started to swell. *Goddamn,* it hurt. 

Daniel and I watched the wasp fly off, making its way towards the treeline. You know, I should have been a little surprised that he didn’t just smash the damn thing and call it a day…But that wasn’t what Danny Boy was all about. Even after years of torment in this godforsaken hellhole, he remained one of the gentlest people I had ever known. I respected him for that. He was a better person than I was. I would have squashed the little piss-bitch.

We stood there on the fire escape for a while. I was looking up at the tops of the mountains, watching the clouds drift slowly behind them. When I glanced at Daniel, he was looking down at the treeline, a sort of constipated look on his face. 

“What now?” I asked him, still poking at the sore spot on my ear.

Daniel took a shaky breath, tearing his eyes away. I looked at the spot where he had been staring, but…I didn’t see anything, except for a very subtle shiver in the leaves.

“Do you see that?” 

He was pointing off into the distance now. I followed his gaze until I saw it too: a cloud of smoke rising out of the forest a couple of miles up the mountain. Despite the snow, a fire was beginning to spread. 

“What do you think the rangers are up to out there?” I asked, a strange wave of dread passing through me as I wondered how far that blaze would go and if we’d have to evacuate if it got any closer. 

“I don’t know,” Dan said. “But let’s hope they know what they’re doing.”

This is Evelyn McKinnon at 104.6 F.M. And I think I’m going to take back what I said about burning this place to the ground.
