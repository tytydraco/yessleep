The date was April 16, 1964. That’s the day that son of a bitch who raped my mother was born. They say violence is never justified but in my case where its one life for another, I think I’m in the clear. 

You see, me and my associates have achieved the unthinkable: time travel. Ever since that first successful trial with the albino lab rat, Loen, I’ve been planning on avenging my mother who was driven to madness and suicide after the horrible acts of that bastard, Jeff. 

You see, Jeff was a piece of shit. Basically just a waste of human existence. He spent his god forsaken days just drinking the boredom away and terrorizing anyone who came in his path. He somehow graduated from high school in 1982 and went straight into construction in Reno, Nevada. And of course, as fate always has it, the idiot company that hired him was based 3 floors down from where my mother worked in the Ghann Building.

My mother was so proud to be moved into the new office. She’d worked so hard for the position of vice president in her accounting firm. She’d even work late AFTER she received the promotion. That’s just how dedicated she was to her company. All her hard work to just be destroyed one night in August.

She was getting off the elevator to the parking garage around 10:15 after another night of hard work when she accidentally ran into Jeff. One sight of a successful woman was all it took before his jealousy took over and his disgusting hands grabbed my mother and drug her to behind some cooperate van. 
I can’t bring myself to type what he did to my mother. I can’t bring myself to type how the tears rolled down my father’s eyes when he had to tell me mommy couldn’t tuck me in to bed anymore. I can’t type the pain I felt growing up without a mother always feeling awkward and different from the other girls. What I can type however is how the Appalachian State Hospital looks right now.

You see, one of my favorite features of our time machine is that you can see the environment you will be traveling to before you embark. It was common sense, really. A traveling female scientist must make sure there aren’t any 20th century, “can get away with basically all violence towards women” sexist bigots around. Or, for the safety of minorities, no  racists or slave owners. This feature was a necessity.
Anyway, I’m off on a tangent. I can see Kristie Parker laying in her hospital bed holding her new baby boy. I don’t understand how such a beautiful woman could produce such a vile, disgusting man. Maybe his father was responsible, I surely do not see any men other than the doctor in the room. What I do see though is my chance to end the evil right there. To take back my mother’s happiness and vitality. To regain a shot of growing up as a happy little girl who didn’t have to buy her first bras and tampons with her father while pushing back tears of embarrassment. I saw my chance and I knew it was time to take advantage of it. All I had to do was take a step.

Dressed in some crappy nurse costume I bought off eBay -I couldn’t just wear my white coat; this is 1964, women do not have top dog positions yet - I ventured through the portal. Even though I was pioneering time travel, I was still confined to our nation’s rules and morals. Murder is and was illegal so I knew I had to be sneaky. Especially since most people feel strongly towards killing a newborn, even if he is a future rapist.

Anyway, I stepped into Ms. Parker’s hospital room with ease. These “doctor” dumbasses saw a woman in a vintage looking nurses costume and didn’t even bat an eye. Her eyes were wet with tears of joy as she looked up at me with a huge smile. 
“Isn’t he beautiful?” she asked me. “I’m going to name him Jeff after his grandfather, the only decent man I’ve ever had in my life.” I tried to fake the best smile I could as I agreed and informed her I had to take bastard baby Jeff to NICU to rest with the other newborns. She tried to resist but I could see the fatigue in her eyes and she finally relented handing him over while admitting how badly she needed to rest. 

What I did next I wasn’t proud of. I pray you understand. I knew I didn’t have much time so on the walk to the NICU I slipped out the needle from my off white sweater and injected Jeff with 2 μg of Fentanyl. It was the perfect coverup. Common opiates such as Oxycodone hadn’t even been invented yet so his untimely death would be ruled a freak accident, maybe as too much pain medicine given to his mother during labor.

After administration, I gently laid Jeff down in his crib and got out as fast as I could. On my way to the bathroom I could hear a flock of nurses running to where I was just moments before. I closed the bathroom door and as soon as I was positive I was the only one in there ,I pressed the button on my watch which shot me back to 2019.

As I’m typing this, I’ve only been back in my time for roughly 5 minutes. I pray my actions haven’t altered the present too drastically. I know the seemingly smallest actions can produce the biggest drops in the bucket. You must forgive me for I believe the oncoming consequences will be outweighed by the positive effects. One thing I know for certain though, is that my mother just texted me asking if I was coming to Friday dinner.
