It started with a notification.

I was scrolling through my phone, half-asleep, when a ping pulled me out of my drowsiness. *“@YourFate has followed you.”* I frowned. The username was strange, and the profile picture was just a black square. I tapped on it, expecting a bot or some spam account, but what I saw made my stomach drop.

The account had only one post—a photo of me.

It was me, standing in my kitchen, wearing the same pajamas I had on right now. The timestamp was from five minutes ago. My heart raced as I glanced around the room, half-expecting to see someone lurking in the shadows. But I was alone. The photo was impossible. I hadn’t taken any pictures tonight, and no one else was here.

I blocked the account and tried to shake off the unease. It was probably just some weird glitch or a prank. Right?

The next morning, I woke up to another notification. *“@YourFate has posted a new story.”* My stomach churned as I opened the app. The story was a video, just a few seconds long. It showed me walking into my office building, which I did every morning. But the timestamp was from 8:15 a.m.—an hour from now.

I told myself it was a coincidence. Maybe someone had hacked my phone or was using some kind of deepfake technology. But as I walked into my office at exactly 8:15 a.m., I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched.

The posts kept coming.

A photo of me tripping on the stairs at work. A video of me spilling coffee on my shirt. Each one was timestamped for the future, and each one came true. I tried to change my actions—I took the elevator instead of the stairs, I avoided drinking coffee—but no matter what I did, the predictions always came true. It was like the account wasn’t just predicting my future; it was controlling it.

I reported the account to the platform, but nothing happened. The posts kept coming, each one more unsettling than the last. Then, one night, I got the notification that changed everything.

*“@YourFate has posted a new photo.”*

I opened it, my hands trembling. The photo showed me lying on the floor of my living room, my eyes wide and unseeing, a pool of blood spreading beneath me. The timestamp was for tomorrow night.

I didn’t sleep that night. I called the police, but they brushed it off as a prank. I thought about leaving town, but what if the account followed me? What if there was no escaping it?

The next day, I tried to stay in public places, surrounded by people. I even considered checking into a hotel, but something stopped me. If this was real—if this account really could predict my death—then running wouldn’t help. I had to face it.

As the hours ticked by, I grew more and more paranoid. Every sound made me jump. Every shadow seemed to move. By the time I got home that night, I was a nervous wreck. I locked all the doors and windows, turned on every light, and sat in the middle of the living room, clutching my phone.

The timestamp on the photo was for 11:47 p.m. At 11:30, I started pacing. At 11:40, I called a friend, but they didn’t answer. At 11:45, I heard a noise outside.

My heart stopped.

I crept to the window and peeked through the blinds. The street was empty. But then I heard it again—a soft tapping, like someone knocking on glass. It was coming from the back door.

I grabbed a knife from the kitchen and approached the door, my breath coming in short, panicked gasps. The tapping grew louder, more insistent. I reached for the handle, my hand shaking so badly I could barely grip it.

I opened the door.

There was no one there.

I let out a shaky breath and started to close the door, but then I saw it—a shadow, moving in the corner of my eye. I turned, but it was too late. Something slammed into me, knocking me to the ground. The knife clattered out of my hand as I struggled to get up, but a weight pressed down on me, pinning me in place.

I looked up and saw… myself.

It was me, but not me. The figure had my face, my clothes, but its eyes were black voids, and its smile was too wide, too sharp. It leaned down, its breath cold against my skin.

“You should have listened,” it whispered.

Then everything went black.

I woke up on the floor of my living room, my head pounding. For a moment, I thought it had all been a nightmare. But then I saw the blood—my blood—pooling beneath me. I tried to move, but my body wouldn’t obey. My vision blurred, and I realized I was dying.

The last thing I saw was my phone, lying on the floor beside me. The screen lit up with a notification.

*“@YourFate has posted a new photo.”*

The account is still active. It posts every day, photos and videos of people going about their lives, unaware of what’s coming. Sometimes, it posts their deaths. I don’t know who—or what—is behind it, but I do know this: if you get a notification from @YourFate, don’t ignore it.

But don’t follow it, either.

Because once it knows you’re watching, there’s no escape.
