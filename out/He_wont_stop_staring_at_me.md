I was on my way to work when I first saw him. It was rush hour, and the subway was packed. I looked up from my phone. A man was looking right into my eyes. You often see strange people on public transport, but this man looked normal, clean, and kempt. Maybe it was just some guy trying to assert his dominance. I let him win and stared back down.



I was meeting my friend that evening for drinks. We were laughing about a joke he said when I looked across the street from the bar window. There was a strange figure standing there. It was the same man from the morning staring at me again. I wanted to say something to my friend, but then the server came to take our orders. When she left, I looked out, but he wasn’t there anymore.



The next day, I was in my cubicle at work. My department sits on the fourth floor overlooking a square with small shops and restaurants. I was in the middle of working on a report when I felt that familiar feeling again. That feeling you get when you know someone is piercing you with their gaze. Something inside me knew that I was not only being watched, but who was watching me. I rolled my chair closer to the window and carefully looked out. 



It was the man again, standing in the middle of the square, people walking around him like he was a statue. How did he know which floor I worked on? Could he have been following me the past two days? I had had enough. I ran down, but when I got there, he was nowhere to be found. The clapping of heels and shoes echoed through my head. I tried to push myself through the crowd, looking for anybody who even vaguely resembled him, but to no avail. Was I going crazy? 



I could barely focus on anything at work. I had to leave early. I was riding through the dark tunnels trying to organize my thoughts. I looked through the glass window at the other cart, and I saw him again. He was standing between two people, staring right into my eyes. The two people didn’t seem aware of him, acting like he wasn’t there. I could feel blood rushing to my head, muscles tensing up, my mouth biting down hard. I ran to the door, still looking through the glass, making sure I wouldn’t lose him this time. He kept staring at me, his eyes wide open, his face expressionless.



The subway screeched to a stop. I got out and stood in front of the cart, waiting, making sure he didn’t get off. Right before the door closed, I jumped into the other cart and started making my way through, pushing people aside. I felt pressure building behind my eyes.



The cart smelled like spilled beer and vomit. I wasn’t sure where exactly he stood, but with each row of seats I passed, my anxiety level rose. I looked each person I saw up and down, checking their every detail. I pushed aside the last group of people, but I only saw the end of the subway cart. The man was nowhere to be found.



I stood and leaned on one of the poles, holding my head. Tears ran into my eyes. I felt defeated. He couldn’t have gone anywhere this time; I made sure that he didn’t get away. I started asking people around me if they’d seen this strange man, but I was ignored. People were now staring at me like I was crazy.



On my way home, I kept looking around to make sure the man wasn’t standing somewhere staring at me. I didn’t feel anger anymore, only fear. What was this entity, this man who wouldn’t stop staring at me? 



At home, I tried to calm myself down with a few beers. They helped. Maybe I imagined this whole thing. It could have been a different person each time. It would be weird that so many similar-looking men stared at me with such eagerness behind their eyes, but I lived in a big city with a lot of strange people and drug addicts. I’m not sure how much I trusted that thought, but it helped enough that I could ease my mind a little.



I was on my way to get another can of beer when my whole body froze. I felt that feeling again. I knew something was outside my window. I didn’t want to look at first, but then I slowly turned my head. The man was standing there staring right into my eyes. 



I slowly backed away, dropping an empty beer can on the floor. My heart was pounding. Cold sweat was running down my back. When I got enough courage to look out the window again, he was not there anymore. The apartment was dead silent.



Then I heard a loud knock on the door. I stood in my room waiting. Then the knocking echoed through my apartment again. I slowly walked to the door. I looked through the peephole. The man was now standing across the hall. He stood there motionless, his gaze locked onto the tiny glass circle.
