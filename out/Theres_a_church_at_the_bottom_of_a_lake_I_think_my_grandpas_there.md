Near me there’s a town at the bottom of a lake. It’s deep enough that you need proper gear to dive and see it, but it’s interesting enough that some people will travel for it. To them it’s a tourist attraction, an underwater ghost town that makes for an interesting story.

To my grandfather it’s the town he was born in, and a place he never wanted to go back to.

They Got Religion there many years before Grandpa was born, and his description of it sounds like what I would stereotype as an isolated, rural religious town. “Town” might be generous - a few hundred people at most who had a distrust of outsiders and a deep love of their faith. Their town had only one church, and every Sunday every able-bodied man, woman, and child went. And thanks to their preacher, everyone was able-bodied.

The Preacher - Grandpa never told me his name, always just called him Preacher - was a fixture in the town, mostly seen when his services were needed. Sunday’s were preaching days and were multi-hour affairs. Baptisms and funerals were staples of course. But he was loved most for his faith healing.

Everyone, at some point, gets sick. Small fevers, stomach aches, fatigue - these could be handled with care from family members, some rest, and maybe even a small visit from Preacher to say a prayer and lift your spirits. But most everyone, certainly all of the adults, talked about a Sickness with a capital S. A sickness that gave them a feeling of mortality and an overwhelming urge to visit the Preacher.

Only once did my grandpa tell me about his visit to Preacher. Grandpa was still young when he got Sick. Like others, this Sickness filled my Grandpa with a recognition of his mortal frailty. As the days progressed and his condition worsened the urge to ask Preacher for help grew, as did a sense of faith that Preacher could fix it.

Grandpa eventually asked his family to bring him to the church, and Preacher had them sit Grandpa with his back to the altar, facing the entrance of the church, then asked his family to leave. A sense of calm came over him as his family walked away, but once they left the calm began to be replaced with a sense of dread. It grew as Preacher stepped to the other side of the altar from Grandpa, talking about faith, how God worked in mysterious ways and only by trusting while not knowing could we truly have faith.

Preacher told Grandpa to keep his eyes toward the front and asked if he understood the importance of doing so. Grandpa nodded, mute, but his confirmation was all Preacher needed. Others had spoke about their faith being restored at this point, Preacher’s talk of trust opening their eyes to what faith really meant, but Grandpa said this was the first time he was filled with doubt. It wasn’t a warm, loving embrace of the Holy Spirit that kept his eyes forward, but terror, the certainty that if he saw what was about to happen he would die.

A sound like the click of a lock came from behind, almost making him jump, and the feeling of a presence, of *pressure* filled the room. His heart beat faster as Preacher walked around the altar, Grandpa swearing he heard not the sound of footsteps, but slithering.

The other townsfolk talked about losing time as Preacher touched them, of becoming so overwhelmed by holy light that they lost track of their senses and came to minutes or hours later. Grandpa reckons he passed out from sheer terror.
