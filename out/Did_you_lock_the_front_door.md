“Did you lock the door?” I say to myself as I lie in bed. This feeling of anxiety is overtaking me, just thinking about that damn door. I checked it before I went to bed, but that same horrible feeling overtakes me while I try to shut my eyes. I take a deep breath and exhale slowly, trying to recall my therapy sessions. We set up a plan to reel in my compulsions or to at least delay them. This has worked with my other habits to a certain extent, but of all things, my front door is the worst one. I check without realising with a quick shake of the door handle, and off I go, but minutes later I feel the urge to check again. 



This started a few months ago when I first moved in. At first, it felt great to gain my independence, but when the sun went down and the darkness rolled in, I couldn’t stop myself from looking at my door down the hall. The once secure, dense door with a strong lock and key felt like it had been replaced by a piece of plywood hanging off its hinges, with me thinking that if it went unchecked, someone would replace it without me looking. So slowly over time, I began to check the door just once every hour, then it would slowly be whittled down to every 5 minutes after it got dark. This shortly made living normally extremely difficult, especially since I was allowed to work from home, so I never got a break from my tendencies, leaving me exhausted. 



After confiding in some of my friends about my rituals, they convinced me to start seeking therapy before it got any worse. It was difficult at first, opening up to a stranger about my OCD they had expressed many times about how they would not judge me on what I told them, but this feeling of someone’s hand clutching my stomach had only ceased after a few sessions. But when this stopped, I could finally talk about my life as a whole, from past mistakes and trauma to the small things my OCD had latched onto in my life, making daily tasks difficult, and then finally, my front door.



The progress was slow, but nonetheless was still progress before I knew it. After a few weeks, I worked myself back to only checking on it once every thirty minutes, then to an hour. I felt great, thinking I was well on my way back to a sense of normalcy, but every time I went to bed, the same question haunted me.



“Did you lock the door?”



It had felt like my progress was turning into failure despite what my therapist was telling me. “This is fine, you’ll overcome this, just give yourself time.” It was falling on deaf ears. I was doing my best not to spiral, but when you're faced with a wall every time you go to bed at night, you start to lose hope. I get less sleep, which means I fall behind at work, which means I risk my job status, all because of one stupid question on my mind.



So while I sit here with my eyes shut, trying my best to fall asleep, I couldn't feel more awake. My mind's eye was busy drifting down the hall, then down the stairs, across my creaking floorboards to a broken, worn-down piece of wood, leaving me with a clear view of the doorknob slowly turning, with an agonizingly slow creak, the door opens, letting a shadow stroll into my home.



“I give up” I say to myself, pushing off the bed, doing my walk of shame out of the bedroom, stopping briefly by the bathroom to splash some water on my face. Still thinking about the progress I was losing tonight. “I’ll try again tomorrow," I say to myself, full well knowing that I don’t mean it. I’ll be back here tomorrow night, looking in the mirror, giving the same excuses.



I step back into the hallway, feeling for my keys in my sweatpants with little luck. “Probably next to my bed” I thought to myself, stepping back into my bedroom. I froze in place as a cool breeze hit me.



My window was open.



I stayed still for what felt like hours. “I hadn’t opened it, had I?” My thoughts ran wild and scattered, but all of my questions were simultaneously answered in one quick moment when I heard a faint creak from the floorboards just behind my bedroom door, alongside the faintest sound of someone breathing with a slight hitch to it as if they couldn't contain their excitement.



I backed away slowly, then almost tripping over myself, I turned and fled down the stairs, each step being made louder by the overall silence of the dead of night. But above my fleeting footsteps, I could still hear their heavy boots stomping against the floor, leaving the bedroom, but with no urgency to them, almost as if they had all the time in the world.



Running across the bottom floor, I practically threw myself at the door, but even after all this, now more than ever, that same question hammered in my mind. I shook the door handle violently with tears in my eyes, pleading with this now stronger than iron door to free me while listening to those footsteps come to a stop shortly behind me with a jingle in their pocket and a tone of mischief as they asked me a question I already knew the answer to.
