Hey everyone. It’s Luke. After my last post two days ago, I figured I should give you guys an update.
If you haven’t read my last post, I highly recommend you start there. You can find it here: https://reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1j1lsyn/i_cant_remember_the_existence_of_my_best_friend/

Anyways, after my text conversation with Haley, I lay awake in bed for a couple hours, just aimlessly scrolling through social media. My eyes were beginning to get heavy and I was slowly drifting off, when a particular post caught my eye, snapping me back to reality.
One of the popular girls from my school, Emma, had shared a photo a couple hours ago. In the photo, Emma was sitting on a bench at our local park, holding hands with Max. The caption red, “today just celebrated my three month anniversary with my lovely boyfriend!“
The strange thing about this, however, was that prior to Max just randomly appearing out of nowhere, I actually knew Emma. We shared a couple classes together, and we were even partners in our psychology class. This meant that I could easily talk to her about this the next day.

School on Monday did not go nearly as I had hoped. That’s putting it lightly, considering it was an absolute disaster. Honestly though, that was mostly my fault.
It all started when I walked into my psychology class in third period as usual. I sat down at my desk, and Emma joined me a few moments later. We began to work on our research paper in relative silence. But near the end of the class, I worked up the courage and brought up the subject of Max. “So, Emma. How long have you known Max?“
She shot me a confused look. “What do you mean? We’ve literally known each other since you introduced us last year.”
“Look. I know this is gonna sound crazy, but something seriously strange is going on.” I said.
“Like what?“ She asked, giving me a somewhat concerned look.
“Well, I actually only met Max yesterday. I don’t know what’s going on but everyone insists we’ve been friends for years. And yet I genuinely don’t remember him.”
“Luke, is this some sort of joke? If it is, please cut it out. It’s not funny.”
“No. I swear I’m being completely serious. Something is seriously wrong here and I’m genuinely trying to get to the bottom of this. I talked to Haley and she doesn’t remember him either. I think there’s something supernatural going on.“
“You do realize how crazy that sounds, right? You’re suggesting that he’s some kind of paranormal entity or something?“
After several more minutes of back-and-forth like this, the bell rang. Emma hurried out of the room, but not before shooting me one last look of Concern.

Well that was an absolute disaster, I thought to myself as I rode the bus home from school. However, I suddenly had an idea.
When I got home I contacted Josh, an old friend of mine. I hadn’t talked to him in years cause he is an absolute madman. He goes on about demons and prophecies and dimension jumping and how he could supposedly see into people‘s minds. However, Considering what I was currently dealing with, I figured I’d at least give it a shot.

Long story short, Josh thinks Max is something called a Highland demon. Though it’s entirely possible he just made that up and got the name from Max‘s actual last name.
According to Josh, these demons feed off of the confusion and fear of their victims. They appear in the mortal realm, take on a human form, and choose a target. Then, they will insert themselves into the lives and memories of everyone around the target . The target will be confused and then later afraid. If this goes on long enough, the demon will supposedly establish a connection with the target and slowly feed off of their life force, increasing its own power.

I stayed home from school today, too afraid to set foot in the same building as Max, or even go anywhere near him. Most likely, if what Josh said is accurate, that’s just playing right into Max‘s hands. But I just don’t care. I don’t know what to even do anymore.
I’m desperate here. Any form of advice would be greatly appreciated. If anyone has absolutely any ideas, please let me know.
