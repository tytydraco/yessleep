The job was simple. It paid well enough.  
Even if it hadn’t, I would have taken it anyway. After nine months of unemployment, choice stops being a luxury and starts feeling like arrogance.

I started on a Tuesday. Odd, I know. They said they were in a rush—something about the previous guy leaving without notice. Apparently the guy just walked out mid-week and never came back. A red flag, sure. But red flags fade when rent is due.

The work itself didn’t sound bad. Basic data input. After hours. Double pay. That last part hooked me instantly.

The elevator ride up was quiet except for the low hum of the cables and the faint rattle in the ceiling panel above my head. The fluorescent light inside flickered once—just a quick stutter—before settling into a steady, pale glow.

When the doors opened, sound spilled out into the hallway.

Voices overlapped, chairs scraped against the floor, someone laughed too loudly at a joke I couldn’t hear the punchline to. It was the end-of-day noise of an office emptying itself—people stretching, complaining, pretending they weren’t eager to leave. The reception area was lit in that familiar, soft corporate brightness, rows of ceiling lamps washing everything in the same tired shade of white.

As I stepped forward, the smell changed. Coffee—burnt and stale—mixed with printer ink and disinfectant. Paper. Heat. Human presence. It was comforting, in a way.

Then the noise stopped.

Not gradually. Not awkwardly. It just… cut out.

Every voice died at once, like someone had flipped a switch. I became aware of the faint electrical buzz above me, the subtle whine that sits just below hearing until the room goes quiet enough to notice it.  

All eyes were on me.

Tired expressions. Neutral. Heavy. No smiles. For a moment, no one spoke, and in that silence I noticed something else—the lights over the reception desk flickered. Not enough to draw attention. Just enough to make the shadows twitch.

Then someone cleared their throat, and the room breathed again.

Laughter resumed. Chairs scraped. The moment passed.

But as I walked further in, I had the strange sensation that the lights were brighter behind me than they were ahead—and that somewhere, just at the edge of my vision, something dark had blinked out of existence.

“Mr. Scarn?”

A man broke away from the reception desk and hurried toward me, his smile already fixed in place. He was close enough that I could smell his aftershave—sharp, chemical, barely masking the sour note of sweat beneath it.

“You came in early,” he said, placing a hand between my shoulder blades and steering me toward his office.

The door shut behind us with a soft, final click.

Without a word, he crossed the room and began pulling the blinds closed, one by one, careful and methodical, as if following a routine he’d practiced too many times. Each blind snapped into place with a dry plastic clatter, cutting the outside light into thin, useless strips. When he finished, he dropped into his chair and let out a long, rattling sigh.

That should have been my second red flag.

At the time, all I could think was that I’d done something wrong—that showing up early had somehow put me on the back foot before I’d even started.

We sat in silence.

The lights overhead were brutal. Not bright—*aggressive*. They washed the room in a hard white glare that made my eyes ache, like I was standing too close to a dentist’s lamp. I wondered, briefly, if bringing sunglasses would’ve been ridiculous.

The office was small. Pale green walls. A coat hanger stood behind the desk, empty except for a single plastic hook twisted slightly out of shape. The desk itself was cluttered with loose papers, stress balls, and cheap plastic toys—bright colors dulled by age and dust.

“Normally,” he said suddenly, “we do a presentation.”

His voice came out rushed, uneven, like he was trying to keep pace with his own thoughts.

“I like to put something together for new hires.” He rubbed his face with both hands. “This situation sucks. But we have to keep the show going.”

I nodded. I couldn’t seem to make my mouth work properly.

“The job’s simple,” he continued. “Once everyone’s gone, you input every sale made into the system. That’s it.”

Another nod.

He stood abruptly, crossed the room, and opened the door. He barked a name into the hallway—something clipped and sharp that didn’t quite register. Seconds later, someone answered. Their voices dropped into hushed tones, just low enough that I couldn’t make out the words. Then he stepped aside and gestured for the person to enter.

A young woman came in. Reddish hair pulled back tight. Pretty, but not striking. She smiled—polite, practiced—but it didn’t reach her eyes. There was something else there instead. Not fear. Not quite. More like resignation.

“This is our receptionist,” the man said. “She’ll explain everything you need to know.”

I stood and offered my hand. “I’m—”

“We know who you are,” she said gently, cutting me off as she took my hand. Her grip was cold.

“Ready to go?”

She didn’t wait for an answer.

Outside the office, the floor was quiet. Too quiet. The earlier noise—the laughter, the overlapping conversations—was completely gone. The lights hummed overhead, their glow pooling unevenly across the carpet. I glanced back once. The manager stood in the doorway, watching us, his face unreadable. He didn’t wave.

“This is Annex,” she said, stopping at a cubicle near the back. “You’ll be using this computer. It belongs to our HR rep. He’s away on jury duty.”

She hesitated, just for a moment.

“He won’t mind.”

“What happens when he comes back?” I asked, trying to sound casual.

She sighed instead of laughing.

The next few minutes blurred together as she showed me the system. It was clunky. Old. Too many steps, too many confirmations. The kind of software no one updates because no one wants to touch it. I didn’t care. As long as it paid.

She pointed out the break room. The restrooms. Emergency exits.

Then she was gone.

No goodbye. No “good luck.” Just the soft sound of her footsteps fading down the hall, followed by the click of a door somewhere far away.

I was alone.

The lights above my desk flickered once—just a blink—and for a split second, I thought I saw a dark spot move across the monitor’s reflection.

When I looked directly at it, there was nothing there.

I sat down and got to work, pulling the first sheet from the tall stack beside the monitor. The paper smelled faintly of toner and dust, warm from having sat too close to the printer all day. I had just started inputting the first line when the light directly above my desk flickered again, and once more that dark blemish crept along the edge of my vision. I turned, expecting—hoping—to catch it this time, but like before there was nothing there. Just empty cubicles and humming lights. I scrubbed my eyes hard, as if I could rinse the paranoia out of them. I’d never believed in ghosts or things that lurked in the dark, yet I couldn’t shake the sensation crawling up my spine, the certainty that I was being watched, that at any second a hand would settle on my shoulder. With a low grunt, I forced myself to refocus, and for a while I made decent progress, the steady clack of keys almost soothing.

Almost.

It happened again, but this time it wasn’t just the flicker. To my left came the unmistakable pop of a chair spring—the sound you hear when someone stands up after sitting for too long. My head snapped toward it, heart buzzing in my chest, fingers turning cold and numb. There was a chair there. Empty. Silent. Perfectly still. I let out a shaky sigh and forced a laugh, trying to trick my mind into calming down. It didn’t work. The feeling of eyes boring into the back of my neck only intensified, so sharp it bordered on pain, and I found I couldn’t go more than a few seconds without glancing over my shoulder. On one of those looks, the light flickered again, and I flinched so hard a hot, stinging pain shot up my back. This time, for a split second, I saw it—something standing a few meters away, upright and watching.

The legs of my chair scraped violently against the floor as I jumped to my feet, nearly toppling it over.

“Who’s there?” I shouted, my voice cracking despite my effort to steady it. “You’re freaking me out. Just—just stop it. I’m here to work.” The words sounded weak the moment they left my mouth, swallowed by the vast, empty office. The response came immediately. The light flickered again, and I stumbled backward. I didn’t see the shape this time, but a cold draft brushed across my face, carrying a faint, sour smell—stale air that hadn’t moved in a long time. The hairs on my neck prickled as my back hit the desk, the mouse clattering to the floor.

I scanned the area frantically, searching for anything—any sign that I wasn’t alone—but all I found was the same silent, unmoving space. “I’m being stupid,” I muttered. “There’s no one here. It’s just my head.” The moment the words escaped my lips, the flicker came again, sharper this time, and something shifted within the emptiness, not stepping forward, not retreating—just *adjusting*. That was enough. Whatever threshold I’d been clinging to shattered, and I bolted out of the Annex.

The instant I stepped onto the main floor, the lights went out.

Panic seized me, raw and immediate, and my breathing turned shallow and frantic. Somewhere in the darkness, footsteps echoed—heavy, deliberate, far too steady to belong to someone running. I scrambled toward the nearest wall, hands scraping blindly along it until my fingers closed around the familiar plastic of a switch. I flicked it. Nothing. I flicked it again, harder this time. One bulb sputtered back to life, flickering weakly like a failing heartbeat.

And there, caught in that sickly pool of light, stood the shape.

It was distant at first, indistinct, but with every flicker it drew closer—not walking, not gliding, just *nearer*, as if the darkness itself were rearranging to make room for it.

My body locked up as the heat drained from it, every muscle turning to stone. My thoughts unraveled, fraying apart as I tried to grab onto something—anything—that would make sense of what was happening. The light flickered again, and again the thing blinked closer. That was when it hit me. Whatever this was, it clung to the edge of the light, to that narrow boundary where shadows pooled and refused to die. Whenever the light steadied, it vanished. Whenever it faltered, it returned.

I reached for my phone with shaking hands, praying the light would hold long enough for me to turn on the flashlight. My fingers were numb, stiff, and twice I missed the pin as I fumbled at the screen. Panic scrambled my thoughts, and for a terrifying moment I couldn’t even remember how to toggle the damn thing. Another flicker came. Instinct took over. The flashlight burst to life, and I thrust it forward like a shield.

The shape vanished a meter from me, dissolving with a wet, irritated hiss that seemed to crawl straight into my ears. My breathing came apart, sharp and ragged, my heart lodged high in my throat, pounding so loudly I was sure it could hear it. Keeping the beam steady, I swept the room, searching for a way out, staying well clear of the flickering bulb. Somewhere deep down, I knew that was where it lived—in the hesitation between light and dark.

I moved through the office in a wide arc, back into the Annex, then the break room, flicking on every switch I passed, never lowering my phone. Lights began to stutter behind me, one after another, as if something were trailing my path. The pauses between flickers grew shorter, tighter, more frantic. It wasn’t stalking me anymore. It was chasing me.

I ran through the rec room, every step triggering another stutter of light. Each time the bulbs failed, I felt it closer—so close I could almost feel its breath ghost across the back of my neck. I didn’t stop. I didn’t look back. I tore past reception, down the hallway, down the stairs, and out into the street.

I didn’t stop running until I stood beneath a streetlamp, its light steady and unwavering. Sweat soaked my clothes, clinging to me like a second skin, every breath burning as it scraped down my throat. But I was free. Whatever that thing was, it hadn’t followed me.

I never contacted the company again. They never contacted me either, as if my disappearance had been expected. As if someone had already filled my seat. Life went on after that, though I stayed far away from night shifts and fluorescent lights whenever I could.

Everything was fine.

Until a few hours ago.

I was in my basement, digging through old boxes, when I turned on my phone’s flashlight.

And it began to flicker.
