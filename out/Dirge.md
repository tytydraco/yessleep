They say the first mistake is always the cheapest. You learn from it, you move on, the sting fades. I learned that isn't true. My first mistake, the one that opened the door and invited the wrong things in, cost me a piece of my sanity. It’s a debt I’m still paying, every single night.

It started five years ago. I’d inherited my grandfather’s old place, a two-story clapboard house at the very end of a dead-end street, right where the town limits blurred into scraggly pine forests. It was too big, too full of memories for me, so I decided to rent it out. I put an ad in the local Pennysaver on a Thursday morning. I kid you not, within ten minutes, my phone rang.

The man on the other end introduced himself as Mark. His voice was warm, friendly. He said he’d been driving around looking for a place for his family and had just seen the ad. It felt like providence. He, his wife, and their three kids—two boys and a girl—were new in town, needed a place immediately, and could pay first and last month’s rent in cash. I met them that afternoon. They were… pleasant. Normal. Mark was all firm handshakes and easy smiles. His wife, Sarah, was quiet, her eyes downcast, but she offered a small, shy smile. The kids stood in a neat, silent line behind them. They seemed like a dream come true for a first-time landlord.

That dream curdled fast.

The first month, the cash was left in the mailbox in a crisp white envelope, just as agreed. The second month, the silence began. No returned calls. My knocks on the door went unanswered. I’d see curtains twitch, but no one would come. It took me a week of trying before I finally caught Mark coming home from work. The man I met was a stranger. The warmth in his eyes was gone, replaced by a flat, cold impatience. He thrust a wad of crumpled bills into my hand without a word, his grip a little too tight.

“Is everything okay, Mark?” I asked.

“Fine,” he’d snapped, then turned and walked into the house, shutting the door before I could say another word. The third month was a nightmare of evasion. I was desperate. I decided I’d go over one evening after work and put my foot down. We were switching to direct deposit. I wasn’t playing this game anymore.

It was around 8 PM, the sky a deep, bruised purple, when I pulled up in front of the house. The place was dark, no car in the driveway. I figured they’d run an errand. I decided to wait. The forest at the end of the street seemed to breathe, a solid wall of blackness swallowing the last of the light. An hour later, headlights cut through the twilight. A dark SUV I didn’t recognize pulled into the driveway.

I moved to get out of my car, my hand on the door handle, but I froze. The passenger door opened and a woman got out. But it wasn't Sarah. Not the Sarah I knew. She was draped in a long, hooded robe, the kind you see monks wear in movies. The coarse, black fabric swallowed her whole; I couldn't see her face, her hands, nothing. Then the driver's side opened, and Mark emerged, identically clothed. The three children slipped out from the back, three small, silent shadows in miniature versions of the same grim attire.

They moved in a single-file line towards the front door, a procession of silhouettes against the dim house. Not a word was spoken. The only sound was the whisper of their robes against the gravel and the frantic thumping of my own heart. I slowly, quietly, pulled my car door shut, the click of the latch sounding like a gunshot in the quiet evening. I slid down in my seat until they disappeared inside. The house remained dark.

What had I just seen? Some kind of religious thing? A cult? The words felt melodramatic, but the chill slithering down my spine was real. I drove home, my knuckles white on the steering wheel, deciding to deal with it in the clear, rational light of day.

The next evening, I returned, steeled for a confrontation. But this time, the dead-end street was clogged with cars. I had to park a hundred yards away. A stream of people, all wearing those same black robes, were flowing in and out of my grandfather’s house. The air felt thick, heavy, like before a storm. A low, rhythmic chanting, more a vibration than a sound, seemed to emanate from the very walls. I felt a wave of pure, undiluted revulsion. They were using my family’s home, a place I’d spent Christmases in, for this… this gathering. I was too angry and, I’ll admit it, too scared to confront them. I left, vowing to return the next day and evict them on the spot.

When I came back, the silence was absolute. The gate was swinging open on its hinges. The front door was ajar. I pushed it open and called out. “Mark? Sarah?”

My voice echoed in the emptiness. The house was vacant. Not just empty of people, but sterile. The floors were bare, the walls blank. There was no furniture, no sign that anyone had ever lived here. It was as if the raucous gathering of the night before, the entire family’s tenancy, had been a fever dream. I checked every room upstairs and down. Nothing. Not a scrap of paper, not a forgotten toy.

I went to the neighbors. Old Mr. Henderson, who lived two houses down, answered his door with a nervous glance past my shoulder.

“The family that was renting from me,” I started. “Do you know where they went?”

His eyes darted away. “Didn’t see a thing, son. Keep to myself.”

“But last night, all the cars, the people…”

“Sorry. Can’t help you.” He began to close the door, but not before I saw the genuine fear in his eyes. He was lying. They all were.

A year passed. My life fell apart in other, more conventional ways. My marriage ended. Needing a place to live and too broke to be picky, I moved into the old house. My house. The first night, the silence felt oppressive. I lay in my old bedroom, the one that had been my mother’s, and tried to sleep.

It started around 2:30 AM.

Laughter. Loud, braying, mockingly joyful laughter, coming from the living room downstairs. My blood went cold. Someone had broken in. I grabbed a heavy flashlight and crept onto the landing, my heart hammering against my ribs. As my foot touched the top step of the stairs leading down, the laughter stopped. And then it started again, directly behind me, from the bedroom I had just left.

I spun around. The hallway was empty. The laughter echoed from the empty room, then cut off abruptly. A suffocating fear wrapped around me. I couldn’t make myself go back up those stairs. I spent the rest of the night on the dusty living room floor, curled in a ball, every sense screaming.

I never truly slept. In the hypnagogic space between waking and dreaming, I felt sharp, insistent tugs on my hair, like someone was trying to rip it out by the roots. I heard a woman sobbing, the sound choked and guttural. I’d jolt upright, swinging the flashlight wildly, illuminating nothing but empty space. The air grew cold, and I felt a presence behind me, so close I could feel the impression of long, cold nails gently scraping down my spine.

The next morning, hollow-eyed and trembling, I was rushing to my car when Mr. Henderson waved me down. He looked older, more worn.

“Heard you moved in,” he said, his voice low. “Mind if I stop by later? We should… talk.”

I agreed, too frazzled to care.

That evening, I sat on the porch with a couple of beers. Henderson showed up right on time, as if he’d been waiting. He nursed his beer for a long time before speaking.

“I… I owe you an apology,” he finally said, not meeting my eyes. “They paid us. All of us on the street. The man, Mark. He gave me cash to distribute, told us to keep our mouths shut and our eyes closed.”

“Why?” I asked, my throat dry.

He took a shaky breath. “There was one night, near the end. The… chanting… was louder than usual. Then we heard a scream. God, I’ll never forget it. It wasn’t a scared scream. It was a… final sound. Like something being torn apart.” He swallowed hard. “We all came out on our porches. The people in the robes were leaving in a hurry. Mark saw me. He walked right up to me, calm as you please, and put a stack of hundreds in my hand. He said, ‘Our rituals are just representations. We just got a little carried away tonight.’ He told me to make sure the neighbors were compensated for their… discretion.”

“What did he mean, ‘carried away’?” I whispered.

Henderson looked at me, his eyes full of a profound, weary terror. “I think they killed someone in there. Or did something so bad that death would have been a mercy. We didn’t ask. We didn’t want to know.”

After he left, his confession sat in my gut like a stone. That night, the sounds returned with a vengeance. The sobs were sharper, the laughter more manic. And then, as I finally fell into an exhausted sleep just before dawn, I opened my eyes. A woman’s silhouette stood at the far end of the hallway, at the top of the stairs. She was tall, gaunt, and her head was tilted at an unnatural angle. She took a step, descending, and I lunged out of bed to follow, but the hallway was empty.

The final horror came the next morning. My car wouldn’t start. I remembered a small, external toolshed out back, one I’d never bothered to check. Maybe there were jumper cables in there. The padlock was rusted shut, but it broke easily with a sharp tug.

The smell hit me first. It was a sweet, cloying, metallic odor of old blood and damp, rich earth. I gagged, pulling my shirt over my nose. The shed was dark, filled with cobwebs and the husks of dead insects. In the corner sat a large, plastic storage bin, the kind you’d use for Christmas decorations.

Dread was a physical weight on my chest. I lifted the lid.

Inside was a mass of dark, matted hair. Thick, long strands, tangled and clumped together with a black, tar-like substance I knew was dried blood. It looked like it had been ripped from a scalp. Beneath the hair were bundles of clothing—a woman’s blouse, jeans—all stained with the same dark, flaking residue. And folded neatly at the very bottom, were three small, child-sized black robes, also marked with blood.

I stumbled out of the shed, vomiting onto the yellowed grass. I called the police, my voice shaking so badly I could barely form words. I told them I’d found something disturbing, possibly evidence of a crime.

They never came. I called three times over the next week. They took my information, but no cruiser ever darkened my street.

I ended up dragging the bin deep into the woods myself, heaving it into a ravine. I couldn’t bear to have it on the property.

But getting rid of the physical evidence didn’t get rid of them. The laughter still comes some nights. The sobbing. The feeling of cold fingers on my spine. The silhouette of the woman at the top of the stairs.

The neighbors tell me I should dig up the backyard. They whisper that maybe I’ll find a body, that putting it to rest will put the sounds to rest. But the ground is undisturbed. I think the truth is, some horrors don’t need a body to stay buried. They’re alive, festering in the very air, in the memories of the walls. They’re in the hair that was ripped out, the blood that was spilled, the robes that were worn.

They’re still here. And I think a part of me will be, too, long after I’m gone.
