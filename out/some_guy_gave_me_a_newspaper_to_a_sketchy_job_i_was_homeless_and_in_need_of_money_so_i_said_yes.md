 

we were ushered into another room that looks like a hospital lounge room. Complete with a receptionist or an actor who knows?. I was just trying to make a buck a quick 20 dollars . i know most people dont look at the newspaper anymore plus i think that people just do linkdin now or something. I was snapped back to reality saw a man standing infront of me asking me to look into a strange rectangular transparent device with eyeholes in it. I took a quick peek it was like a void inside. It was snatched away after a ding was heard. He gave me a number and switched to another person the one beside me. Shall i continue the story? Good . i was homeless my house taken away from me my beautiful daughter taken away by child protective services and thrown out of my very own house. Memories flowed through my tears as i cried rain. I wandered the street the town melting into a confusing visual of flowing water. I was to tired to continue so i sat in a nearby alleyway wherein a man plain jeans and black leatherjacket said. ‘You doing good man?

I responded ‘ doing as fine as you can see’ we both sat silent for a few minuets till he chirped back saying’ hey man here take it might help you’ i took the paper from his hand. A newspaper?

Thanks man but i dont kno- he was gone. Take care he said before he left. Mr miller? I awoke again. Looked into my surroundings all the other people were gone. Mr miller have you been waken? Im fine thank you. I responded to the lady dressed in a cliche nurse outfit. Stuff that you might find on halloween ya know the red crossed looking type. The nurse then ushered me into one of the rooms. It was labled the emergency room. It all seemed empty like everything was clean and sterile but too sterile beds were folded to completion no smudge no dirt can be seen it was frankly creepy. The nurse then led me into a room 2o4 spelled like that. The nurse opened the door for me like a celebrity smiling widely telling me to enter. I went inside and found a chair with  a strap. I was told to sit comfortably and the doctor would arrive soon. I daydreamed again to that time i got the newspaper. It was pouring rain found myself shelter in some abandone parking lot. Same people as me broken in despair and need of money. Of course with my only belongings gone and only possession in hand was a newspaper i just started reading. Dont know how many politics mayer elections with climate change is real i passed through till i found the job section. It read something like this .

Are you broke? Then you need to sign up right now! We pay you 20-50 bucks depending on your performance. Anyone is allowed as this is a cleanup even the homeless are allowed we value you guys :D go to 73rd #### near the stair ##### bring more people we need them. OF COURSE WE WILL DOUBLE THE MONEY EVERY 5 PERSON YOU BRING COME QUICK TIME IS OF NEED. i chuckle at the very bad way of marketing i have seen. Not that it matters but money? If i am going to survive on the street or even get out of it. I need money. I scream HEY EVERYONE. All eyes were on me starring through my soul piercing me with pure anger. I found a job and it says i need bring more people im it says 20-50 bucks. They looked around each other and nodded. I showed them the newspaper and follow me through.

I was drooling with the thought of money that it never crossed me how sketchy it was. I awoke from my past and saw the doctor standing in front of me. He was normal, standart doctor clothes but nothing serious. How are you doing? Im fine i responded. Good because we are going to need you awake for this one. Now i have something to ask before we proceed. Shoot i told me curiously. How do we reach into our inner selves. I uh dont know do- nurse send in the tv. The doctor then proceeded to tie the restraints to my body. Made me jolt then told me to relax and this is all part of whats about to happen. I trusted him. The doctor and the nurse left before leaving an old crt tv plugged into nothingness of an outled. It started playing unknown geotmetry i have ever seen. Shapes that felt had no mass and circles that bounce through other shapes. It was odd to say the least. I started seeing myself in the the reflection. Sad deep broken eyes. I started crying i cant stop crying. I cant stop. I felt myself slipping away. I did not even notice the gas seeping inside my lungs but i cant stop crying. I felt extreme sadness knowing i might never see my daughter again. But i kept crying. And everything went black

Another one down. The doctor said

The nurse squealed cant believe we got that many. Gosh darn homeless idiots they be making the world a better place

Nothing like food for the hungry. He smiled

Lets the prepare the shop honey. Cant be caught with bodies today.

Lets do.
