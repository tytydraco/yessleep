A grey orb appeared in the room as big as a beach ball.

We had a hundred men armed with assault or high caliber rifles. Our green leader looked at the orb.

"Fire" he commanded.

A dozen or so men fired at the orb and the bullets started spinning around it. They spun around menacingling for a long moment before someone spoke.

"What are you?" One of the men said, stunned.

"What do you think I am?" It said as the bullets turned from red to purple, and then changed into flowers as they spun.

The men starred blankly at it. 

It motioned towards their green leader.

"From this man, I will take everything. For Caesar has given him everything, and he has chosen to give him nothing. But from you others I will take something, but maybe not everything."

Fire the green man ordered and everyone fired again.

The bullets swirled around turning into saw blades and then into red and black dragon heads.

Of the men who fired 2 had their guns turn into flowers. They stood their stunned. The grey orb looked at them.

"You have chosen to plot you're leaders murder and will be sparred." The orb said, and then they dissapeared.

"All those that remain will be given a choice, will you side with your leader, or will you side with me?" It said as the dragon heads multiplied. They started loosing shape and form.

"Fire!" The green leader commanded.

The men all thew down their guns and dissapeared.

As they dissapeared they heard the most dehumanising screaming. And all of them said they would never return to our palace.

The lost men had been found in Barbados and said they would never return.

When men stormed into the room with the orb it has dissapeared. It reappeared in the concert hall where we had all gathered to talk about dealing with it.

There were a thousand of us, we had this thing. We had Saren at our backs like always and that's all it takes. A thousand against one.

The ball blared like a loudspeaker.

"You are now trespassing on sacred ground, since Caesar has given you this palace, and you have given him nothing I will now take everything from those who will not leave. This is your final warning." It blared as thousands of the face of our leader came flying out of the other room. 

The faces attached to some people and they started screaming, others hovered in the air.

A few lucky souls ran but most stayed, hearing Sarens commanding voice.

"Stay, just wait till he runs out of mana! Wait till you can see him in the eyes." he commanded.

"Those of you who have followed your leader, for you I will only be just" He blared as the doors slammed shut.

Around half the remaining men were attached with leader faces. They screamed like only the death of soul can.

"For those of you who defied your leader secretly, I will not only be just, but also fair" It said.

The remaining men all had Saren heads appear in unison, biting them, as they screamed and ran around the room.

The men who had ran outside were gathering around the closed doors, hearing the cacophony of screams inside.

Before any could really come to their senses the they heard the orb again.

"For you who have headed my warning, I will not only be just and fair, but also patient. You have 3 minutes to get within one mile of this building or face the consequences.

"WHAT ARE YOU?" a man screamed.

"What do you think I am?" it said in a mocking tone.

Most of the men ran but one stayed.

"But what are you?" He said, trying to connect dots in his head.

"I am the most powerful weapon ever devised. I do not create, I correct." The orb said in a rising tone.

The man looked from side to side "But what are you?"

"Look me in the eye and you tell me what I am?" It looked at him with a tiny untron like body from inside the orb, through the wall as well as time and space.

"The shredder!" he screamed and could not run. IT was too late for him. He screamed and was corrected so that none like him would exist again.

And then men who made it out, well I guess they are safe for now.


I sat in my car as a tiny shredder recited this story to me. He said simply, "Tell them nothing, but show them everything."
