I have never been much of a social person. So when i get the chance i like to hang out with the people I'm surrounded by. My family. It's a much better alternative then having to talk to "new people". So instead me and my family, mainly my older sister, like to explore the open desert. We go on hikes, build Forts ect. But our most recent discovery has made us... Shaken. I now feel like somethings always breathing down my neck.

I suppose i should start from the beginning. Hi, my names Maxus. I am 17 year old boy from Phoenix, Arizona. About three years ago my parents moved me and my two siblings out to an old property behind a lake called, Lake Pleasant, near Phoenix. The lakes pretty well known. And it has a constant flow of people coming in and out. But me and my family lived around twenty miles or so behind the lake, way off into the dry desert. There is no one within at least a ten mile radius of us. And the only thing leading us back to the city is the worn dirt road that goes for about twenty-five miles before hitting asphalt. The place we moved to is about eighteen acres of land. There are probably about ten or so one-hundred year old worn down building scattered around the property. Once used as temporary homes for prospectors looking to stay out in the desert and sift through the rivers near by for gold. But we lived in the main house. Where the owner, his family, and guests stayed. That's where we stayed for the next two and a half years.  
The place is pretty run down. mainly to do with age. The place being at least a one-hundred years old and all. But since it was past down from generation to generation, It's been at least livable. To the point where we had power, working water, and some AC units we added. Its an ok place that I was not used to living in, I being a city boy, But we had just good enough wifi for me to be satisfied.  
The place itself you'd think would be haunted or something for how old it is. But surprisingly no. In fact, it seems almost comforting to be within the place. Waking up and sitting on the porch to watch the humming birds feast on the sugar water. Or taking long naps by the spring. It was, Peaceful. But the desert around us, the tall, red, jagged mountains. It all seems... Strange. There's almost an other worldly feeling when walking the desert alone. Nothing but Saguaro Cacti everywhere you look. Towering over you like tall pine trees. And the rocky, hot dirt below you. I can't really describe it. But walking in a place with no sign of any human, let alone any creature, is very... Eerie.  
Anyway lets catch up to about one year living at, what we called, "The Ranch". At this point it is just me and my younger sister Serina. My older sister Sarah having moved out about three months after we moved to the ranch. She's much older then me. I think she is twenty-two now so she was i think eighteen or nineteen when she moved out. It had been months since Sarah had moved out but she still came down once in a while to hang out. She only moved back to Phoenix, but the forty-five minute drive still was costly. Which is why she didn't come around that often.  
Though despite the lack of visiting. It was still fun when she did come around. We primarily like to make forts. Using sticks and the debris from the old buildings we made lots of them. Nothing to impressive though. We also like i said would go on hikes. We practically went everywhere. But we mainly trailed the large river bed we called "The Wash". I remember one day we decided to hike the mountain behind our house. It's closest one by us, and it only takes about one hour to get to the base of the mountain. With a mix of driving and walking. So we packed up hopped in the ATV and made our way to the mountain. Driving off and out into the desert. We made our way through the old road that's behind the ranch. The road probably used by carts, and older types of cars. We keep going for about twenty minutes before reaching the fence that separates our property with the governments property. From there we go by foot. At this point it is getting pretty close to 2:00PM. And we figured we had plenty of time to get to at least the base if not the middle of the mountain and back before dark. I barley remember what it was like on the way there. All i remember is a lot of talking and chatting. Probably about video games and what the top of the mountain would look like. As we walked, our conversation starting to simmer down, I couldn't help but notice something a little odd.

**Maxus- Hey Sarah is it me or are there-**

**Sarah- Less Saguaros? Yeah it's kind of weird.**

**Maxus- I mean I can only see like four five around us!**

**Sarah- Yeah maybe um, it's just a dryer part of the desert?**

**Maxus- And the other cacti, There are little to none of those to! No jumping cacti barley any brush!**

Our conversation shifted away from that. But the whole way to the base of the mountain I couldn't help but wonder why the area we were in seemed so... Barren. We walked for about another thirty minutes before getting to the base of the mountain. Looking up. It's huge. The moment we hit the base. Both of us knew that we would not be getting far. For we underestimated how big the mountain really was. From a distance it didn't look to huge. But being this close really shows its magnitude. We take a little break before heading up. Discussing how far we think we'll make it. But in the middle of our conversation we heard something that made my stomach drop. The screams of what sounded like a dying woman. We froze. Didn't take a breath. As we sat in silence for what seemed like several minutes. Until the silence was broken by Sarah.

**Sarah- That was one loud ass mountain lion**

**Maxus- You're telling me! I've heard they're pretty convincing, you know as a screaming woman, but i really did not expect it to be that convincing.**

**Sarah- I have my bear mace. Wanna keep going?**

**Maxus- What!? No! What's bear mace going to do against a goddam lion!?**

**Sarah- Come on it is literally used for bears. Bears are way bigger.**

**Maxus- Uhhhhh. I don't know dude.**

Sarah gave me a pleading look while mouthing the words please. And eventually... I was convinced. I don't know why. Maybe curiosity maybe stupidity, either way, We started up the mountain. Though we did try and steer away from where we had heard that scream. After a rough hour of steep climbing and traversing. We arrived at a small ledge to take a break. Looking out we could see the ranch the road leading to it. Staring from this height we knew it was going to be a long trip back. And we both expressed as much as soon as we could catch our breath. We sat for a while. Probably to long admiring the view while also trying to avoid moving down. Suffice to say, we were pretty fucking tired. I was laying up against a rock near the ledge while Sarah was leaning up against the mountain wall. And then Sarah found something. The very thing i still think about to this day.

Sarah- Hey, HEY! this- this wall is crumbling!

Maxus- What? What do you mean?

Sarah- It's falling apart! There's a cave behind here!

Maxus- Holy Shit! there is!

We pulled away the rest of the rock to reveal a short dark cave. Most certainly man made. From the entrance to the back all of it you can tell was blown out. Likely by dynamite. The cave was about 15ft by 20ft or so. The ceiling being only seven feet high or so. The walls were covered in sketching's. Some that looked to be depicting what looked like people eating... other people. But the main focus of the room was right in the middle of it. A brick well that drops down into a seemingly infinite pit of darkness. Dropping a rock would only result in silence. At first it was pretty exciting. Finding an old hidden place like this. It felt like we just discovered a dinosaur. But the feeling was short lived for our giggles of excitement were broken by the sound of a loud crank of a wheel. Slowly turning for about a minute before a very large bucket comes into view. Slowly but surely making its way to the top. And when it does we stare into the bucket with udder confusion and shock. The words never leave our mouths but we could read what it says. At the bottom of the bucket carved into it. It reads...

"HOP ON IN"
