Thinking back, I was probably nineteen, but I was definitely a Sophomore. It was Christmas Eve, and I had decided to hitchhike from school in Providence up I- 95 to meet with my family in Maine. Now this was the 1970s, so I used to hitchhike all the time. It was the best way to get around the city when you couldn’t afford a cab, so I had no problem sticking out my thumb and seeing where it took me. It’s kind of sad that hitchhiking has become so verboten, cause I ended up having some very groovy interactions as I bummed around New England in a stranger’s car. On the other hand, this particular trip kept me from hitchhiking ever again.

It was just past eight and I was somewhere just outside of Portsmouth, right on the Maine and New Hampshire border. Earlier in the day I had gotten picked up from Boston by a great couple. I can’t remember their names but I remember their Akita named Yojimbo, they were Kurosawa fans. I sat in the back and calmed the nervous pup, and as payment, they took me out to dinner. If I could I would have traveled all the way to Maine with them, but they were heading west to Concord so we parted ways over dinner and drinks. Unfortunately, as we had so much fun talking and eating and drinking, I had mismanaged the timing and would now be doing the last leg of my trip in the cold and dark.

I knew that I could just walk along 95 and I would end up in Portland, where my family would be. It seemed simple enough, just go until I got another ride. In hindsight, I should have stayed the night and gotten a hotel. I had the money, but I wanted to keep moving. I thought it would be fun to surprise the whole family staying at their cabin. My walk was powered with the idea of seeing their shocked faces as I pounded on the door, freaking them out late at night. I always loved pulling pranks and messing with my brothers and sisters. Everyone thought I had another week at school, so no one would be expecting me, and no one would know I was missing.

As I walked along route 95, I was bundled up, but because it had started to snow, the temperature kept dropping. It was still quite chilly, I was desperate for a ride, and I didn’t want to turn around and walk back. I couldn’t stomach the idea of walking another two hours just to end up right where I had started, or worse, that all the rooms were booked in whatever small town motel I could find. Every so often headlights would illuminate me from behind, and I’d throw up my thumb, but no one stopped. I counted eighteen cars and big rigs before I got fed up and stopped keeping track. I was seriously considering taking off the jacket and letting my hair down; being a lady was always a ticket to a free ride, when a single headlight split the darkness, whipping around a corner going the opposite way. My guts were sending every alarm they could, I mean, everything about this felt like bad news, but I was so fucking cold.

As the car whizzed past I stuck out my thumb, and waved with my other hand. In my mind I remember thinking, don’t stop, don’t stop, it will be okay if this one passes me by, but my thumb ignored my request, seemingly disconnected from my brain. As the auto passed, I honestly felt relieved, until the screech of tires whistled their way to my ears. It was such a terrifying sound, high pitched and manic, like the car was screaming. I was sure he’d crashed, and I expected to see the car on its head, one impotent headlight illuminating nothing but snow and sky.

I turned to see a wreck, and got the opposite. The car spun in a graceful arc, fully under control, and came racing toward me. I moved over, thumb still out. This worn out bag of rust and grease shuddered to a halt, the low hum of its engine idling a bit up the road. It was so damn cold. As I walked over to the passenger side door, an unseen hand began to crank down the window. I just said to myself, damn if I don’t remember so clearly, just say, you’re okay, you live real close, and you don’t have to get in the car. As I walked up to the window ready to decline the ride, my jaw nearly dropped. I saw one of the best looking men I’d ever seen. Like the coloring of Al Pacino with the grin of Robert Redford. This dude was so hot. He had this disarming smile, he just smirked and said, “you need a ride? “

I didn’t even answer, I just opened the door and slid in.

His name was Jerry and he was a local mechanic, and he seemed really sweet. He asked me my name and where I was going, I told him to call me Sandy, and then I explained that I was headed up to see my family, but that I was going to surprise them. We made small talk, I told him about my major, computer science, and how it was going to revolutionize the world. He said that as long as he didn’t have to deal with it when he was fixing chevys and fords, they could put computers in whatever they wanted. Funny to think about now.

Eventually I asked him how far he was going and this was the first time any weirdness occurred, he said, “all the way to the end of the world.”

“What does that even mean?

“Don’t know, it just popped into my head. Sorry doll, didn’t mean nothing by it. Don’t wanna scare you.”

“I’m not scared. I’m really glad to be in a car with a heater. Hell I’d take being a little scared over freezing to death.”

“You won’t freeze to death now.”

That hung in the air until I didn’t want to sit with it any longer.

“You got family you’re gonna visit?”

“None that I know of.”

“So you’re going to be all alone on Christmas?” I pried. I thought maybe I could invite him up to the cabin. No one this handsome should be alone on the holidays.

“Yeah, but actually, I’m good on my own, my family, we’re not on good terms.”

“I don’t know what I’d do without mine. I have five sisters and brothers, and a ton of cousins.”

“My family and I have a difference of opinions on faith, let’s just leave it at that.”

And I did. At this point he wasn’t menacing, or confrontational. He honestly seemed like he didn’t have a care in the world. It changed very quickly, unfortunately, as we continued to drive in the dark.

A song came on the radio, playing quietly, that I really liked. I asked if we could turn it up. He said he loved Don’t Fear the Reaper and wanted to show off his stereo.

I was just jamming along, enjoying the song, the heat, the drive, the view, but every so often I’d see him move his lips, like he was talking. And he’d reach down, play with his right boot. I’d look over, give him an opportunity to talk about it, but he stayed silent.

Right after the second chorus he yelled out, “what!” And I said, “huh?”

His hand shot out and turned off the radio. The lights faded from the dash. He turned to look at me.

“Hey, what’d you say?”

“I didn’t say anything, I'm just enjoying the song,” but he looked at me like I was lying. I put my hands up and crossed my heart, “Honest.”

“Nothing? Nothing about?” and he trailed off a bit. I just shook my head.

I saw his lips move and it sounded like he said, “I could have sworn.” I just thought, whatever, the music was loud, just a mistake. Then after a minute he turned his head slowly, and, not unkindly, said softly, “just tell me what you said, I’m not upset.”

“My guy, Jerry, I didn’t say anything.”

“Sandy, It sounded like you asked me about it.”

“About what?”

“What we have to do.”

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“If this is how it has to be, I’m new to this too. But this seems right.”

“Is this, are you joking, like, are you pulling my leg, are you fucking with me?” And he kept looking at me, looking for some sign that I knew more than I did, which I absolutely did not.

Then his face broke into a grin.

“Yeah’ he laughed, albeit a bit nervously, ‘I must be, right?” and ran his hand through his unkempt hair. He lit a cigarette and I took one too, and cracked the window a bit. The cold air felt nice on my face now that I had a heater pumping toasty metallic air into the cabin. As we sat and smoked, the tension did diminish a bit. I looked at him, he looked at me, and smiled. He had a great smile. He seemed fine now.

I stubbed out my cigarette and he tossed his out the window.

“Roll up your window. Want to see what this girl can do?” And he pat the dash.

“Like, go fast?”

“Like go fucking fast.”

“It’s pretty wet, out there, should I worry?”

“Hell no. Wet is best.”  And he had the audacity to wink at me. Wink. Any other guy on any other night and I would have been repulsed, but everything about him made me want to say yes to anything he asked. I didn’t get a chance to respond, he downshifted and gunned the engine, pushing me back into my seat and making me laugh from the exhilaration and fear. This did not feel safe and I loved it. I would have leaned over and kissed him if the momentum hadn’t pinned to my seat.

“Yeah girl! 55, 60, 65, 70! Baby let’s go.”

“Okay, pretty fast.”

“I’ve gotten her up to 110, I did all the modifications myself, new pipes, new carbs, added a blower on top, ton of power. I’m not afraid to die, are you?”

“What?”

“Are you afraid to die?”

“Yes, I am. And I don’t want to tonight. Please slow down.”

“I heard you, during the song. I’m sure of it. You agreed. You agreed. You know that it’s time Sandra.’ He took a long pause, ‘If it isn’t me, it has to be you.“

“What?”

“I’m sorry, but if it isn’t me, it has to be you. That’s just the way it is.”

And this is where it went from scary to terrifying. He reached down into his boot, and drew a very long, very sharp looking knife and stood it point down on the dashboard.  I remember this for a fact. I might have gotten all of the other things mixed up about this story, it’s been decades, but this I remember perfectly; the knife didn’t move. Not a millimeter. It was like it was stuck to the spot. I don’t know if he had a fucking magnet set under the dash board or he covered it in glue, but the knife stood on its point like a dancer in toe shoes. New England was whipping past us so fast, but inside that jalopy it felt like the world had paused around us.

“What, why do you have that Jerry?”

And he just turned to look at me and pressed his foot further down on the accelerator. He shifted again and the engine screamed. I looked over and the dial read 110 MPH.

“Okay, maybe this works on the girls around here, but this is not sexy, or cool or whatever. I don’t like this and I want you to stop the car and let me out, right now.”

He just kept staring. Somehow we kept going faster.

“Please, Jerry, please. I don’t want to die. Please Jerry. Please.”

I didn’t know what to do, the roadside whipped past us at over a hundred miles an hour. My brain had accepted it, outside was death, inside was death. I was going to die that night.

“If it isn’t me, it has to be you.”

His words broke me from my stupor, I eyed the knife, and he smirked. Like he was taunting me to take it.

“What happens if I grab that knife?”

He shifted again, pressing the accelerator completely to the floor. We were flying along route 95, going faster than I’ve ever gone in my entire life. And he stopped looking at the road. He locked his eyes onto me.

“If it isn’t me, it has to be you.”

Icy daggers stabbed me all over my body. I can’t explain the way that he said it. The tone of voice. It wasn’t hateful, it was like an obligation. Like he didn’t want to. He said it again.

“If it isn’t me, it has to be you.”

And he didn’t say it the same way as the first time, there was some, god, fun in it? Like now that he got it out of him, he could enjoy it a little. That once you get past the fear of doing the thing, you start to feel comfortable, maybe even pleasure?

“No,” was all I could stammer out.

“If it isn’t me, it has to be you.”

“Stop it.”

“If it isn’t me, it has to be you.”

“This isn’t fucking funny Jerry, fucking stop it right now.”

And then he seemed to get mad. And his demeanor shifted, only showing in his eyes, in his face, and the tiniest little bit in his voice. A bit of malice creeped in.

“If it isn’t me, it has to be you.”

“Jerry, I’m scared now. You’ve scared me. I don’t know what you want. I don’t understand, please stop the car.”

Now his voice started to rise.

“If it isn’t me, it has to be you.”

I was so overwhelmed, I couldn’t do anything, so he just started repeating, like a mantra, like a catechism, until he was screaming at me.

“If it isn’t me, it has to be you. If it isn’t me, it has to be you. If it isn’t me, it has to be you.”

And then he started to move, his right hand lifted from the steering wheel, and his fingers reached towards the knife.

Calm again this time, resigned. “If it isn’t me, it has to be you.”

And just before his fingers touched the blade, I grabbed the hilt floating in mid-air, “Then it’s you!” and I stabbed him. I felt the sharp knife slide into his gut with no resistance. It was as easy as sliding a paper straw into a glass of milk.

“Then it’s you,” I screamed and I stabbed him again. He collapsed into his seat, and his foot came off the gas pedal. I held the blade at the ready, but it was like I had killed him right there. As soon as we had slowed enough, I opened the door, threw the knife in the backseat and leapt from the car. Fortunately, I hit a snowbank and only had some bumps and scrapes. As soon as I got to my feet, I ran to the closest farm house I could see. They let me in, and drove me to the hospital for shock.

Cops interviewed me, but they didn’t have a record of a guy named Jerry who matched my description. They said they would call me to follow up, but they never did. That night my parents and my siblings drove down, picked me up, and took me back. It felt wonderful to feel so loved and protected. All in all I had a nice Christmas. Eventually the pain and fear drained away and it just became this crazy story to tell when the timing was right.

However, my whole family still sends me news reports of situations similar to mine, and they happen a lot more often than you think. A late-night single-car accident along some back road. A fatal crash where some of the injuries look like stab wounds, but there’s a sole occupant and no signs of a bladed weapon anywhere. Invariably a person driving a car that was stolen or reported missing. Usually ascribed to boozed up joy riding and ignored, since no one would expect there to be some connection between similar auto fatalities in Boise, Idaho and Minsk, Belarus. And maybe there isn’t any connection, maybe it’s all in our heads.

But I swear to god, as I opened the door to jump from the car that night, I heard Jerry laughing. And he called out, “Thank you Sandy, I love when it’s me.”
