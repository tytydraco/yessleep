I woke up early. I don’t know why I did this, my alarm didn‘t go off and i didnt hear any loud noises. Maybe it was just my body telling me that I was in danger. So i got out of bed and put my glasses on. Then noticed something. It was pitch black outside. It was 7 AM so i didn’t know why it was so dark. Then I focused more on the outside and i couldn‘t see anything. I could barely make out anything other than a car parked on the side of the road, and a bit of sidewalk thats in front of my window.

Not know what was going on I checked my phone, which to my avail was out of power. I plugged it in but the charger wasn‘t working, Then I flicked the light switch and nothing happened either, the only light illuminating my bedroom was a kind of dim battery-operated light. After realizing the power was out I grabbed my power bank from my drawer and i plugged my phone into it. While waiting for my phone to charge I heard a crash coming from somewhere in my house, it scared the daylights out of me and I went and locked my door out of paranoia. As i did that my phone flickered on, as well as an emergency alert coming from it.

“STAY INDOORS AND DO NOT MAKE LOUD NOISES: PLEASE COMPLY WITH ALL FURTHER ALERTS AND WAIT UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE. THIS IS NOT A DRILL”

”What the fuck?”

Throughout the years I've gotten a handful of emergency alerts. Where i live there are alot of tornadoes and usually it would be a tornado an hours drive away or a test drill. But this is different.

After reading the alert the power flickered a bit and then stayed on. I knew it probably wouldn’t last so i started charging my power bank. After i plugged it in i left my bedroom. when i exited i looked up and down the hallway. After confirming it was safe i went to the kitchen. Everything looked normal, so i went to the basement door. I grabbed a knife and I swung the door open and turned on the lights. Then i saw what made the noise. A pile of boxes had fallen over. I closed the door and went to get something to eat.

I was eating a bowl of fruit loops when i realized that if the power was flickering on and off then the water might go off too. I needed to collect water and take stock of my supplies. So i cleaned my bathtub and filled it with water. Then i used my bathroom sink to fill thermoses with some. After that I went to my kitchen to get all my food onto the table to see how long it would all last me. I had a good amount of canned fish and beans. I also had fruits and bread and if i rationed it all, then the food would probably last me 3-4 weeks. After i had water and food sorted out i decided to call friends and family to see if they knew what was going  on.

Mom didn’t pick up.

Dad didn't pick up.

My girlfriend didn't pick up.

Next was my childhood friend Trevor. He didn't pick up

I was starting to get freaked out and decided i needed to fortify my house. I didnt know what was out there and I wasn’t in a rush to find out. So I blocked the front and backdoor with bookshelves, But for the windows it got complicated. I couldn't make loud noises and i didnt know how to block the windows without uses a hammer or drill. So i just settled with closing the curtains.

Then my phone rang. It was Sarah, my girlfriend, I instantly picked up and waited for a noise.

“Hello?” she said in a quiet voice

”Sarah! Im so glad your okay, do you know what might be happening? I cant see outside because of a fog.”

”You have to listen to me henry, you have to whisper.”

”Why? Do you know whats out there? in the fog?” I said whispering.

”There are creatures, They-“ She began to stutter.

“What?”

“They broke in. My parents are… Dead
