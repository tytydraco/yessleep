I want to be begin by stating that though I was both an alcoholic and a drug addict at the time that I am certain that the events which I am about to relay really did happen and were not the product of some form of artificial happiness. Truth be told at the time I couldn't afford to feed any of my many addictions, my wife had passed away the previous year and with her had gone all my hopes, dreams, and ambitions. I sold our house jumped in my old jeep wrangler and with her life insurance and the money from our house in hand began a never ending journey with no real destination. With her gone and nothing to look forward to in life I simply let go. I didn't call in at work I simply never went back, I didn't call my parents I just left my phone behind. I lived gas station to gas station and motel to motel. It was this lifestyle that quickly gave way to any form of poison I could put in my body and I slowly withered away into the travelling junky I was when I met Mr. Wellers and everything changed forever.

It all began on the day I realized I was broke. I had stopped at a little country gas station on the outskirts of Louisiana. When I attempted to pay for my gas the debit machine gave me the word I had been dreading for a long time, 

"Declined".

 I sighed inwardly, not because I couldn't pay for the gas but because I was also out of whiskey and drugs, the thought of withdrawal was NOT appealing to say the least. 

"Well now city boy it seems you don't got no money left!" 

I was startled out of my thoughts by the attendants southern drawl and I looked at the man closely for the first time. I can't think of any way to truly describe this man other than to say that he looked like he could control fire,

 "Yeah. I guess so", 

I replied, planning my escape. The man leaned over the counter at me and continued speaking in his strange southern drawl,

"well you see her city boy I can help ya! Ol' Mr. Wellers likes you universal donors yes he do!"

 I was taken aback, I was a universal donor but how the hell did this weird fire man know? He continued,

 "Yeah ol' Mr. Wellers runs a blood bank down by the swamp and he LOOOOOVES them universal donors yes he do!" 

For some reason I couldn't understand I was intrigued so I kept listening, 

"Ol' Mr. Wellers pays FIVE. HUNDRED. DOLLARS. For each donation from a universal donor yes he does!"

 Had I been rescued from poverty? $500 for a blood donation seemed steep but a combination of my desperate need and the man's enthusiasm worked to convince my addled brain into belief.

 "Ok, where can I find the blood clinic?" 

I asked, trying my best to sound clean and sober. The man flashed me a big grin, 

"That's easy city boy you just leave here and take the first left you see then right then left then right and so on until you see the signs!"

 The man's shouting was getting on my nerves.

 "Can I give you an IOU?" 

I asked with no intention of returning.

 "Naw city boy, Ol' Mr. Wellers likes his universal donors and he'll be giving papa meat here a big reward for sending ya'll to him". 

"Papa meat?" I thought, "who the hell would call themselves that?"

 I thanked the man and stepped out into the sunlight to see another stranger crouched down looking at my license plate. The man jumped up as I approached and I saw he had a big juicy pair of lips. 

"Your from out of town city boy, I can tell from your plates",

 I shrugged, I was in no mood to speak to overly friendly hicks. 

"Your going down to see Mr. Wellers aren't you?" he continued, "Say hi to Jacoby for me when you get there, she's my girlfriend and she's tall and she's real!"

 I scrambled into my wrangler ignoring the man as his speech devolved into a weird Jeff goldbloom impersonation. 

"Uh uh you better uh be nice to Ol' Mr. Wellers or you could uh end up like Jeff, you see uh Jeff felt a feeling..."

 I sped off down the road before he could finish taking the first left turn I saw.

After the first few turns the road had given way to tall trees and swamp. The dirt road I was driving down became harder and harder to discern from the wilderness but I was much too preoccupied with getting my money and hopefully my next fix shortly after, I barely even noticed the strange sights I was passing by, from time to time there was a perfect set of stairs just sitting in the woods, some carpeted some not even a few that were upside down. Suddenly I saw a post on the middle of the road and slammed my breaks barely stopping in time. I cursed under my breath and got out to read the sign nailed to the post, 

"Mr. Wellers blood clinic, universal donors welcome" scribbled along the bottom was a signature "Dr. [Redacted]". 

I rolled my eyes in irritation,

 "The fucking meat man could have mentioned that the sign would be in the middle of the fucking road", I groaned. 

I didn't see any way I could get around the sign in my wrangler, the ground just off the road was much too marshy. I gave the sign post a shove but it was solid I couldnt move it. I had no choice but to continue on foot. I walked for about 10 minutes when I saw it. Built on a large old dock right over the swamp was a large building that didn't belong in a swamp. The clinic was large and clean looking, as if somebody had airlifted a proper blood clinic right out of the city and stuck it here in the middle of the swamp. A large neon sign flickered near the top of the building, it was a syringe with two red drop shooting out the end and big letters that read, 

"Mr. Wellers blood bank" 

I walked slowly up to the rotten wooden stairs that lead to the immaculate clean building as the swampy ground sucked at my feet. For the first time I felt fear, something about this perfect clean building in the middle of a swamp placed on a rotten old dock just felt wrong to me and I was scared plain and simple. I stood there for a moment, my hand trembling mere inches from the door knob. Eventually my need pushed me onward and I knocked on the door. The door immediately opened and the tallest woman I had ever seen stepped out, she actually had to bend over to get through the door and straightened herself out looking down at me. 

"Do you have an appointment?"

 I gazed up at her in awe, I barely came up to her waist. 

"Well?" She asked more than a little annoyed.

 "I... Uh....I'm a universal donor." I stammered. 

She waved a hand at me like an annoying insect was buzzing around her. 

"Dont go "uh" at me" she said crinkling up her nose "it makes you sound like the iceberg boy".

 "Iceberg boy?" I asked,

 "It doesn't matter" she said, "Just get in here Mr. Wellers will want to see you". 

I followed her into the clinic and was shocked by the state of the interior, it was a big open room barely lit by a single lightbulb dangling from the ceiling, reddish brown stains dotted the floor here and there. I counted three doors on each wall with different names written on them but the only one I could make out said "Kyle". At the far end of the room was a final door that read,

 "Mr. Wellers", 

the door had a large foggy window and I could just make out the figure of a man at the other side. The giant woman seated herself behind a desk and began typing on an old fashioned type writer, 

"Your early William so your going to have to wait". 

I was immediately on edge, 

"How the fuck do you know my name!?" I yelled.

 Just then the door that said "Kyle" flew open and a teenager stumbled out wearing a suit that was much too big for him,

 "Yoooo your wife looked mad funny in that box!" He laughed pointing at me.

 Before I could process what he said he poked his head back into his room and yelled,

 "Yo Kimber they got sandwiches out here!"

  I was done. I jumped to the door I entered through and slipped out before the giant woman could stop me. To my horror I was back in the same room, the giant didn't even look up from her typewriter and the teenager was doing an awkward dance while he sang to himself, 

"Yeah you know what It is....."

 I was panicking now,

 "Where the fuck am I?!" I screamed but they both ignored me. 

I ran back through the door again and again but I always found myself back in the same room again. I ran to the other doors but they were all locked. That left one last place to go. I looked at the door with the label "Mr. Wellers" and reached for the handle. Suddenly a hand clasped itself around my wrist and I screamed. 

"Let me go you freaks!"

 I struggled but couldn't free myself from the mans iron grip. 

"now now there's no need for that" he said, "You can't be bothering Ol' Mr. Wellers when he's busy"

 I looked at the man, where had he come from? He was wearing a crisp white lab coat with a little name tag that read "Dr. [Redacted]". He marched me across the room and parked me down in a little chair in the corner across from the woman still typing away. He had handled me as easily as a teacher with an unruly kindergartener. I jumped up and ran as fast as I could past him shoving the teenager out of my way and grabbed the door handle to Mr. Wellers office. I threw the door open and blacked out.

I woke up back in the driver's seat of my wrangler sore and groggy.

 "Was it all a dream?" I asked myself. 

Then I noticed it, there was a clean white cotton swab taped to my arm and a small brown envelope on my passenger seat. I opened the envelope and laughed, I couldn't help it, inside was a note written on old yellowed paper that read,

"Thank you for your generous donation" with a clean red signature at the bottom "Mr. Wellers", 

Along with the note was a small stack of bills, exactly $500 in confederate money.

I tried to find the clinic again for the better part of the day but couldn't. All I could find was a dingy old dock with no sign of a blood clinic anywhere near it. It wasn't until later I realized my cravings were gone. I didn't feel like drinking or doing any drugs. It was as if I had magically been cured of addiction. I drove away with a new found desire to live and a determination to never see Mr. Wellers again.
