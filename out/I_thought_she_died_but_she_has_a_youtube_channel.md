I was scrolling through the YouTube watching random videos. It happend on last friday. It was around 11 in the night. I was chilling as it was a weekend. I live in an apartment. I earn a decent money. 9-5 job. Single. Life was pretty good. I never really, in my wildest dreams, thought that a YouTube video would cause a chaos in my peaceful life. Before that I need you to get to know about Joseline.

She's dead. Or that's what we were thinking till now. She was a highschool friend of mine. You could see that she was always depressed or her face naturally became like that due to family situation she was enduring with. She was a poor kid. Her father was a heroin addict. Her mother tried her best to give atleast an average life to her daughter which she never had. But Joseline never smiled. She was the target of many bullies. She was also sexually assaulted by few shitheads. But she never complained. No one treated her as a friend. Everyone saw her like someone they must show pity.

But I and Joseline were somewhat close. I felt strangley comfortable with her. Many of my friends would mock me for speaking with her. But I never cared.

She was suicidal during her last days in the school. During a month before the finals the sexual assaults got too much for her and  pushed her off the edge. One day she stormed out of the classroom fighting to hold her tears back, everyone laughing at her back. The teacher didn't stop her. She went to the nurse's room, got a blade and tried to end her life. 

I was in another class when this all happened. But at the last moment I got hold of her. If I were a minute late she would have ended her life. But, I don't exactly remember how I went to her at the right moment. All I remember is she got a scar on the right index and middle finger for life.

This is not the worst. A week after finals, she disappeared. That's it. No one ever saw her again. It was like she just vanished into the thin air. The whole police team with hundreds of volunteers searched every place possible. But she never was found. People decided that she ran on her own will leaving her mother alone to survive. They thought she was fed up with her family. Some other, including her mother and me, believed that she's dead. 

I believed that she was dead because I know Joseline better than anyone. She will not just run leaving behind everything. Ofcourse she was suicidal. But it was in the past and that was too because of the sexual abuse. Not because of her family situation . And the therapy sessions changed her a lot. She will not run. If you can't believe me, then atleast you must  believe that no one is stupid enough to leave everything behind before running. She didn't even take money nor any change of dress. Everything was untouched in her home as it was left.

The police investigated on all possible ways but in vain.

It all happened a decade ago. Joseline became a distant memory and a dead person standing along with me in some school photos. That's it. I would miss her during those moments when your mind will bring back some memories like a thunder crashing on the earth, which would have been unrelated to the situation at that time.

I saw Joseline as malnourished grown woman in a YouTube channel at that time. The relevation was made by my mind in a split second pushing me into a deep shock. My jaw dropped in a very cartoonish- way. I was just sitting there without moving for a whole damn minute, watching the thumbnail. 

The video was about 'How to make a homemade slime(no borax)'. It was a 6:31 minutes long video.Every YouTube user would have crossed videos like this. I clicked on it. The channel name is 'A9842M'. It has some three videos with almost no subscribers. The total view count of the channel would have been 20-30. 

Joseline started explaining the procedure to make a slime with an artificial smile in her face. The method she said was almost a known method to everyone. But what mattered most is the way she expressed it. It was full of artificial mannerism. It was like someone forced her to do that.

By slowing the video I was becoming more convinced that she is Joseline. At one point the camera focused on her right hand. At that moment I noticed the scar. It was almost very light but was noticeable. It was exactly the same. No one would get an exact photocopy of a scar. I am damn sure. I will swear to god that she is Joseline. The same Joseline who the world thought was long dead.

I was not able to believe. I went to the other two videos. The another video was ' how to make a homemade glue'. It was some 7 minutes long. The most disturbing thing in that video was Joseline's eyes were bloodshot like she was drugged. And at some point I could hear some muffled screaming sound at the background. The most recent video was a girl's hand near some meat(probably beef?). It was not Joseline's hand( I compared with the previous video)

I was sleep less the whole night. I was not sure what to do. I am not sure whether should I call the police or not. I subscribed to that channel and opened YouTube for every 40 minutes like a mad man the next day.

The most disturbing thing happend on the sunday. It gave chills down my spine. I was again rewatching the three videos when the channel went live. I joined immediately. To my horror, my apartment was being recorded. It zoomed a particular window. It was my fucking bedroom's window which was covered by a plain green lantern. That's all. The screen went black.  The live ended.

I was scared as fuck. I was too scared to get out of my own house. I locked  every doors, windows and got back to my bedroom with my laptop. To my horror every videos on tha peculiar channel has been deleted. But I have recorded the videos of Joseline. It's in my phone's gallery. Im very scared to make a move. 

Whatever or whoever Joseline is stuck with is very bad. They have some power. Maybe supernatural. I just can't get normal.No way they recorded my apartment as a coincidence.It is like a warning not to mess with them anymore though I did nothing than watching the videos in loop. It's always like someone is watching me. Should I go to the police?
