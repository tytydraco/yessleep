I don't know what else to call them. I don't know where they came from or how they got here. I don't know what they want.

They seemingly emerged from nowhere, suddenly appearing without rhyme or reason across the globe. Sightings were sporadic at first. People claimed that it was some sort of ridiculous mass hallucination. And for a time, I believed that. It *seemed* like a hoax. They called it a meme. Mass delirium, they said. Remember?

If you don’t know what I’m talking about, maybe it’s already happened to you. I don’t know why I’m the only one who remembers.

Region by region, bizarre reports of strange events would spread and then inexplicably cease. There wasn't any pattern for which cities were affected. It could be a single town in South America one day, several Japanese cities the next. There were only ever firsthand reports that sounded like perplexing delusions or shaky camera footage of people in a panic without anything visible worth panicking about.

Wherever it happened, people said that there were *things*. They said there were monsters that would "unshrink" themselves into existence, growing larger as if they were approaching from afar or another "axis" - whatever the hell that means. There was never any video footage of it happening. It didn't even make sense. And it was always the same pattern. Confusion to panic, panic to... Calm, like a trend dying out. Whenever you’d show somebody previous reports or recordings, they’d act like they couldn’t see it - even when they were the ones who recorded it.

I thought it was a stupid prank, some sort of weird inside joke.

And then it happened in my city.

I was at work that day. In mere minutes, the skies began to darken into a rainless storm. The clouds soon became twisted, gnarled as if tormented by some unseen hand. I looked out into the street and at first I didn't know what I was seeing. I didn't make the connection that this might be what all the others were talking about; and yet somehow I was the first to figure it out.

While others gazed and pointed, I ran. I turned a corner and found them there too. I chose a different street, crossing through an alley. I tripped over something hard and when I looked behind myself, still stumbling, I realized that it was one of Them. It was a shadow rising from the ground like a man standing from a crouch; unfolding, and unfolding, and somehow unfolding further. Mere seconds ago I mistook it for a bag of trash, but now it towered over me.

I stared upward, squinting in an attempt to make sense of its shape. I couldn't figure it out. My eyes didn't want to focus. And then it screamed, a sound like a million electronic insects buzzing in unison, droning inside of my mind. I held my ears to block out the agonizing sound, but it didn't help. It only got louder.

I scrambled away hunched in pain. I wanted to run, to hide, to wake up from this nightmare. It's only when I hit a full sprint that I realized that this must be what the other cities had experienced. Was I losing my mind too? Was I insane? I felt insane.

When I turned another corner I found a crowd. They were calmly standing at each side of the street arranged in two orderly columns like they were awaiting entry into a theater or nightclub. I felt relief because it meant that the things I saw must have been in my mind, but then I looked further down the street in the direction they were facing. What I thought was a building was another one of those things...

This one was far, far larger than the others. It was easily three or four stories high. It stood on gangly limbs tipped in grasping claws, with a body that seemed to absorb light itself. It was darker than black. It was a new, impossible color. It was a blur covered in spiky bristles. The flesh rippled strangely and I realized that a swarm of fist-sized insects were crawling upon and within its bristly hair, across its legs and face.

And yet the most striking feature of this monstrosity was its eyes. When it wasn't gazing downward at the people arrayed before it, the eyes would dart wildly around as if watching for something I couldn't see. Somehow this unsettled me most of all.

I choked back a scream. I felt like clawing my eyes out. Every few seconds or so I'd hear that tortuous droning noise I heard in the alley, the electronic screeching. It sounded as if it came from everywhere and nowhere at the same time. It wasn't localized to the creatures, but I knew it was they who made it happen. Why was everyone so calm? How??

I took cover behind a dumpster and watched the scene ahead of me, nauseated.
The largest of the things remained stationary, standing in the center of the street. It was surrounded in a menacing halo of demonic flies, each as large as a canine and vaguely iridescent. They buzzed through the air around it, the sound of their wings blending into a maddening sonic backdrop. It was flanked by several other creatures nearly twice as tall as man. They stood nearby like guards, as if keeping the humans in line. Those ones were winged, like absurd humanoid moths and yet unlike any insect I've ever seen. They were troubling to look at, to say the least. They made my scalp itch.

And the citizens, the people... They approached calmly, marching towards the creature to stand before it in ones or twos. There was no visible panic. It was like watching some sort of demented bureaucracy in action. They'd simply stand quietly while it examined them, or judged them, or whatever it was doing, and then after a few seconds - with no particular cue - the people would calmly walk past as if going on about their day. They didn't look up at it. They didn't react at all.

I couldn't understand it. What the hell was happening? What was it doing to them?

Then I saw something different happen. One of the people stepped forward like the others, a man that could have been anybody. After a few seconds of "judgment" he began to rise from the ground. The man began to float, levitating before the large creature like magic trick - and then he turned to dust, seemingly incinerated. 

It killed him. Somehow.

The bizarre procession continued without skipping a beat. Nobody reacted... The next few individuals simply stepped forward into the man's ashes to await their apparent judgment, passed whatever sort of test or examination was happening, and simply walked casually away. I could tell he wasn't the first to be, what - *terminated*? There was so much ash...

I stayed hidden and watched the process for what felt like an eternity. 

A crash of thunder finally shook me from my horrific vigil and I decided that I should leave. What else could I *do*? The clouds above had become a slowly-spiraling maelstrom littered with more of those dreadful flies, but perhaps there was someplace to hide, somewhere to go.

Just before I left, I gazed around at the scene one last time - and that's when I noticed...

All along the residential balconies and windows that bordered the street stood those appalling creatures, the winged ones. And every single one of them was now facing my direction. It was unmistakable - they were watching me. They've *been* watching me.

They screamed that terrible noise as I turned to run.

I barged through the crowd to cut through the public square. I found myself limping as I moved. I thought I was hurt, but no… - the sound they were making was doing something to my mind! I felt sluggish, like how it feels to run in a dream. I didn't dare look behind me. I didn't even glance, I simply ran to the best of my ability. I ran even as my leg began to drag behind me. They were getting closer. I could hear the rustling movement over the sound of their dreadful noise, even over the sound of my own screaming. They were right there, right behind me!

I turned the corner and my pounding heart sank when I realized that I had nowhere to go. I had taken a wrong turn in my panicked folly. I found myself looking down a dead end. The single alley to my left was blocked by construction, a hole in the ground that I could never hope to leap in my current state.

I did the only thing I could think of. I started banging on doors, twisting knobs in the hope that one was unlocked. It took three tries until I found myself falling through a doorway to land on the cool tile of a restaurant. I stood immediately, locking the glass door just as the things arrived. I braced my hands on the door, wincing with effort to try to keep Them out... But nothing happened. They didn't try to break through.

I hesitantly opened my eyes. They were gathered outside, mere inches away on the other side of the glass. They were just standing there motionlessly like horrific wax figures. Their bulbous insectoid eyes seemed to follow me as I backed away. It was the moth things. Several of them must have been chasing me and now they were just... Waiting. They weren't trying to break through, nor reaching for the door.

I didn't know what else to do, so I gazed around the room.

A woman was in here with me. She was waiting behind the counter with a concerned look on her face. I'd have gasped if my burning lungs held air. Instead, I simply gestured towards the windows, mouth agape. I felt like crying but I was busy catching my breath. When I could finally speak, I asked her what those things are - I couldn't think of anything else to say. In response, she told me that everything is going to be okay. 

What? Is she blind??

I pointed to the windows again, refusing to look that direction myself, and repeated myself.

Once again, she reassured me that everything was going to be okay. I was stunned, perplexed, but when I looked over my shoulder... 

There was nothing there. An empty street. 

What was happening? That terrible noise was now absent too. The only thing I could hear was the beating of my pulse and the sound of her shoes on the tile as she approached me. She came closer like I was a wounded animal, whispering sweet nothings.

I fell to my knees and started to sob. She touched me gingerly on the shoulder, making shushing noises to comfort me. I tried to tell her about what I saw, about what I just experienced, but all I could say was that I thought I was going mad, that I was more afraid that I *wasn't*. More shush noises, a clicking tongue.

I wiped my eyes and was preparing to stand, uncertain if my leg would be able to carry the weight, when I noticed something that froze the blood in my veins. Her shoes were stained with what looked like ashes. No, no, no...

Voice shaking, I pulled myself from the ground and asked about her shoes, internally praying that she'd give me a mundane excuse - the heater, the oven, the dust, the something - but she simply stared at me as if she didn't comprehend. Something in her expression seemed to change. There was no longer any warmth. Was there ever? I wasn't sure.

Backing away, I asked again.

This time she opened her mouth as if to speak and from it emerged the sound of a million electronic insects buzzing in unison.

I blacked out. When I woke up I was in my own bed, but I could tell that someone had been in my home. I could just... feel it. I checked the news, I asked neighbors and friends, but nobody else remembers what happened. Nobody even remembers that it *was* happening. It's like the whole world forgot.
