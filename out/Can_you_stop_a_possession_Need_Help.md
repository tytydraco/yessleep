A few days ago, someone started to send anonymous letters to everyone in my small town. They weren’t special or anything, just a plain envelope with “To the current resident of” written neatly across the center. There wasn’t a stamp on any of them which means whoever sent it had to personally deliver each and every one. 

Like I said, my town is small but with a population of about 1200 people and miles of rural farmland in between some houses, getting these letters into each mailbox was hours of work. That’s why I don’t believe this is some kind of weird prank like everyone else seems to think. No one would spend dozens of hours making sure each letter was personally delivered only to keep it anonymous.

Besides the point, I've been having some weird experiences and I think this letter is a part of it. 

I’ve transcribed the letter below.

To the current resident of REDACTED,

I hope this letter finds *you.* Forgive me if this all seems a bit desperate but I would be lying if I said I wasn’t. I don’t feel the need to tell you my name, you should already be well aware of who this is. Who else would send hundreds of letters just to try and get your attention? You always claimed I had a dramatic streak. Is this theatrical enough for you?

I know you think I should have moved on by now, gone back to my normal life. But once you are shown the galaxies, star gazing seems so painfully dull. Besides, a girl never forgets her first possession. I know we agreed not to use that word my dear, but I can’t find the right words to describe what we were. Not in any human language, that is. I think that is one of the things I miss the most. The way your voice would whisper words to me in sounds that nobody could ever even attempt to imitate. Some nights, when I miss you more than what I think is left of my soul can bear, I try and make those sounds but nothing comes out. You stole that from me when you left.

I remember being so afraid in the beginning. Losing time and finding myself in places I had no memory of going to. One moment I am in school staring lifelessly at a chalkboard and then hours have passed and I’m suddenly in my bedroom without any recollection of what happened between those two moments.  Then my body started to feel as if it was burning. I would sit naked choking on ice cubes and drenching my skin with cool water, but nothing helped. I should have realized it was you sooner. I should have known your touch would always set my skin alight.

That was when Mother demanded she take me to the doctor. I know now that that made you furious but, in the moment, I was nearly delirious with fever I couldn’t sense you in the back of my mind. It’s funny, I never noticed that little hole in the back of my brain before you filled it. Now, it sits there aching in the emptiness. I know you must be drinking in the wine of my misery but I would hope that you can continue reading this before getting drunk off my pain as you are wont to do.

By late August Mother had called in Father Bishop. Do you remember the names you used to make me call him? At first, I was so embarrassed to be using such language in front of a man of God, but you showed me how to delight in his abject horror. By the third day of what was a sorry excuse for an exorcism I didn’t need you to tell me what to say, I could string together the foulest words imaginable. That was the first time I ever heard you laugh. I thought it was the most beautifully haunting sound in the world. I still do.

  By October, I’m sure you remember that Father Bishop was gone. One wrong step leaving down the stairs then he was at the landing, his spine jutting out from his neck like a railroad spike under his skin. If it weren’t for you, I wouldn’t have seen the beauty in it. Without you I may have never truly met myself. But standing at the top of the stairs, my arms stretched out in front of me, that is when I fully became the person you wanted me to be, the person I was always meant to become.

Mother and Father of course had to be disposed of. Father had an unfortunate accident when his cigarette slipped and ignited on his whiskey-soaked beard. Mother of course being the dimwitted woman she was decided the bake my birthday cake with peanuts even though she had been known to have an allergy all her life. Perhaps she could have called for help, but her throat swelled up so suddenly I’m not sure what more could have been done.

By eighteen, you and I were living an extraordinary life. Bouncing from city to city on railways. Taking whatever we needed and stealing the rest. With each death, I became faster, smarter, and more bloodthirsty. You, my darling, drove me to the darkest places of myself and there is where I finally found comfort. 

Peeling the skin off the face of the man who offered me four dollars to sleep with him. Chewing off the fingers of the shop woman who accused me of stealing, which of course I did. For a few years there you and I were truly free. Living out our most depraved fantasies. Those were the best years of my life.

You know where this ends don’t you? It ends somewhere outside of Missouri, my hands deep inside the man’s gaping hole of shotgun wound. I don’t think I will ever forget how the entrails wrapped around my finger like a wedding ring. That was where the police found me. Usually, you were always so careful. Constantly scanning our surroundings. You always kept me safe. Until the end that is. I remember the moment you left. The sudden coldness, the space in my mind, the ache in the burning embers of my soul. You were gone without a moment’s hesitation. Did I do something wrong, my love? I spent those first few hours in the police station screaming out in pain for you, but you never came. Eventually, they threw me into the hospital convinced I was having some sort of medical emergency. The 107-degree fever is all you left behind.

The wheels of so-called justice move slowly in this country. I remained at that hospital for months as the doctors tried to treat me for illnesses that had never been seen before. I wasn’t sick though, my body was just processing the loss of you, the loss of its other half. Meanwhile, the police started to piece together the fabric of our life together. A dismemberment in Tuscan, a disembowelment in Boston. I’m not sure we were even guilty of some of the charges, but all that time spent together began to slip into itself, the memories fogging over like a bathroom mirror.

My lawyers plead insanity of course. I had no reason to lie. I told them the truth and they chose to believe what they wanted to of it.  I was young, maybe 20 or 21 by the time they decided that incarceration in an asylum was the best course of action. So, I rotted away in there for nearly six decades before they released me on what the doctors called compassionate release. I’m dying obviously, but at an accelerated rate. I will only share the details once we meet again. You know what they say, leave him wanting more.

I knew I had to find you again before my time runs out. It wasn’t hard to track you down. It looks like you and I are doing the same thing. We are both going back to where it started. 

You, my dear, have not changed one bit. All I had to do was follow the headlines back to this dusty town. Maybe you already know I’m here?  Maybe you can sense my presence the way I can yours?  Perhaps you are trying to wait me out, and see who will break first?  Getting back together with an old flame can be a bit of a game of chess I hear. I’ve decided to break the standoff first. If you won’t show your cards by making yourself known, I will just have to search each and every person until I find you.

I don’t have long left, my darling. The truth of the matter is I have a few months at most but more than likely we are left with only a few weeks to be together. Before I die, I only want to be with you. One last hurrah, one last time to feel the fire of your touch, the hypnotic melody of your voice. One last time for you to take my hand and wash my body in the blood of our sin. I will wait my love.

 

Yours eternally,

 

 

That’s where it ends, whoever sent it didn’t sign their name although that isn’t much of a surprise. I want to write this off as a hoax or something stupid like that. I really, really want to believe this isn’t real. But I can’t. I can’t pretend like I don’t know what this letter means. 

I started to lose time. It wasn’t a lot at first, a few minutes maybe twenty at most. It was enough time that I noticed but I rationalized it. But yesterday I lost a whole hour. I was in the grocery store looking at the pasta selection and then suddenly I was home. Then today on my way to work I blinked and suddenly it was the middle of the afternoon and I had three missed calls from my boss wondering where the hell I was. 

When I got home I was hit by a sudden wave of exhaustion, my vision went fuzzy and I collapsed in the hallway. My boyfriend found me there an hour or so later when he got home. He said I was burning up with a fever but our thermometer must have been busted because it came in at 107 degrees. And now as I sit in our kitchen pouring over this letter that was slipped under our door, I can feel the most painful heat building up in my fingertips. I swear the paper was burnt where my fingers had been.

I can’t risk that this letter is some kind of joke, not when I am physically starting to feel like whoever it was that wrote this letter felt before- I don’t want to think about it. I’m not a violent person, I’m not a criminal. I won’t be. I can’t be. How the hell do you stop a possession once it's already begun? I don’t know what to do. I’m not a religious person but do I pray? Someone, please help me. Please for the love of all that is holy- someone tell me what to do. I'm so scared.

I can’t become a monster.

I can’t become a demon.
