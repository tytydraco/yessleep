I woke up in my bathroom, after I nearly drowned while taking a shower. The last thing I remembered is enjoying the high pressure wash, as the warm water pushed through my thinning hair. I closed my eyes, tilted my head back; immersed in steam and the aroma of lavender sea salt. 

Then, I began to taste the sea salt. Somehow then, I began choking on it. Choking on salt water: it burned my nostrils and filled my throat. I tried to spit it out but only swallowed more. I was thrashing in slow motion- there was pressure all around me. I finally opened my burning eyes. I was in a warm sea. I felt my lungs fill with water and I was sinking. Also, bleeding. Then the sharks came. I closed my eyes, felt a series of collisions and surrendered to death.

I felt every limb of my weakened body pound against a hard floor. I was shivering and slipping around; as though I had belly-flopped onto a skating rink, from the ceiling rafters of an arena- naked! A high pressure shower of icy water tore through my spine; ceasing every muscle and shaking every bone in me. My stomach convulsed, regurgitating water with great force. My tongue hung out of my gaping mouth while I blew running water out of my nostrils. My eyes winked open- swelling with salty tears that began to warm my face. My head spun at the sight of my bathroom. Nobody was there, but I felt humiliated. 

If not for the word count requirement, I would have stopped the story here. But, anyways here are a few more hundred words that describe what happened next:

Slowly, I steadied my breath and focused my mind. I thought, I'm laid out in the 5x8 glass stall that is my shower. The water is running cold because I've been "out" for a while. Not that long though. I hear the bathroom fan whizzing above me, which means it's been under forty minutes since I set it while preparing for a shower.

Still shivering, I pushed my arms up and crouched on my knees. Then, I reached my right arm up to grab the wall handle and hoisted myself into a squat; just high enough to reach the water faucet and turn off the water. 
Finally, I stood to my feet and stepped out of my shower stall. I pulled a plush white towel toward me and wrapped my tangled, dripping, silver hair- not caring that it was still soapy. I wrapped a second towel around my hips, and shrugged on my thick, pink, sherpa robe. I dropped into my embellished, white-leather dressing chair, held my head in my hands and began to howl aloud. 

My mind could not reconcile with what my body had just experienced: being in two completely different places at exactly the same time. 
I thought, where did I go? The ceiling fan stopped whizzing abruptly. 

I sat up unsteadily and pulled the towel off my head. My hair fell around my pale long face, like a pile of loose yarn. I drank a quart of whiskey, from the bar fridge beside my bathroom wardrobe, while I combed it out. By the time I stood up again, I felt comfortably numb. So, I hung up my damp robe , dropped the towel from my hips to the old tiled floor, and walked through the bathroom door straight into my stuffy bedroom. I rolled into bed and slept soundly until the next afternoon. 

Every day, since this insane event, I've had this strange feeling...as if this reality wherein I have lived for 46 years, feels untrue. This reality, after that insane experience, feels unreal. Like this reality veils some other. I surrendered to death in that warm sea, but did I die out there? Am I dead out there now, while simultaneously  living in my apartment?  

All this to ask...what would you do? I'm too scared to shower and it's been over a week. Spongebathing sucks and this is too fucking embarassing to hire help for, or admit to outside of this post!
