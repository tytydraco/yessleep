After my call with Rosa, I couldn’t stop to walk around the main floor endlessly. I was desperately waiting to hear back from her. After what she had done to the painting, Anja said that this should have buy Rosa some time, but that didn’t mean she was out of danger. A few minutes later, Elizabeth announced that her phone had run out of battery. Mr. Joseph’s one was already dead since the day before, and now Elizabeth’s one too. I was the only one who brought my charger, and it didn’t fit their phones.

 

It was a particularly bad news. My double who was chasing Rosa at the moment had an exact copy of my phone, so Rosa couldn’t tell if a message was coming from me or from my Doppelganger, and he was also allowed to see everything I said to her. I opened my phone, maybe I could find a way to text her in a cryptic way, so that only she would understand, and she could also be sure it was coming from me. My hopes were immediately smashed when I saw that her contact had disappeared. I knew what happened: my double had blocked her and deleted her contact and our conversation. I don’t know her number by heart, so I was now completely unable to contact her.

 

When I realized that, I fell on the floor. I had lost any hope. That’s when I heard her voice. Rosa’s voice, calling me from the hall. I got up on my feet and slowly entered the hallway. All the paintings and pictures were still, and I could hear her voice even clearer: “Joshua, I’m here!” I tried to follow the sound of her voice and ended up in front of a picture. I couldn’t believe it. There she was, Rosa, alone in the middle of this black and white picture. She was looking at me, crying. I called for her. She looked at me.

 

“Joshua” She said.

 

“Rosa, are you okay?!” I asked.

 

“I’m scared, Joshua, she’s close, you have to help me!”

 

I was panicked, she looked so scared and was crying so much, and I felt useless.

 

“What can I do?!” I asked.

 

That’s when a form slowly came out of the shadows behind her. I could soon recognize it, it was the old woman that came out of the painting that Anja shattered earlier to stop her. I could now have a better look at her. She looked like a skeleton wearing a skin costume, she was dirty, and had a wide and sinister smile that was revealing her pointy monstruous teeth. She had unusually long arms and fingers that ended in what looked more like claws than nails. She was slowly approaching Rosa that was staying still and cried harder. She soon found herself just behind Rosa and lifted one of her hand towards her face.

 

“Hey, stop it, get away from her!” I screamed.

 

She laughed.

 

“Or what? You can’t do anything, except, you know, what we talked about…” Her smile got bigger, it wasn’t even human anymore, it sent chills down my spine. “If you just killed yourself, I couldn’t hurt her anymore… It’s up to you.”

 

She started to put her claws on Rosa’s face and to pierce her skin slowly. I was terrified.

 

“You stop that now!” I screamed. I was terrified of what might happen to her, and I started to punch the frame with all my strength. The glass broke immediately, and I began to scratch the picture as hard as I could. The paper started to shatter, and the old woman turned to me and, in a second, she was coming out of the frame and was just in front of me, holding my arms. Her face was almost touching mine and she laughed.

 

“Now come on! Punch me to see how it feels! If you don’t kill yourself now, she’ll be the one to die, is that what you want?” She laughed even harder, and started to mimic a bite repeatedly, like she was going to bite my arm, or my neck. She was now completely inhuman, she looked insane, ecstatic, excited. Suddenly, she was cut off by Mr. Joseph. He surprised her by hitting her with a rolling pin. It looked like a hard hit, but she didn’t looked harm in the slightest. She just looked at him, and threw him across the hall.

 

That’s when Anja arrived, she entered the hallway through a door. She looked panicked. She was still covered in the wounds that she had earlier, but she was also covering one of her eyes that was bleeding a lot. She also had new wounds in the neck and her arms. She looked at the room and seemed terrified. She ran towards me and succeeded to make the old woman release her grip on me before pushing me out of the way. She stood up in front of the picture and looked straight to the old woman.

 

“Ha ha, let’s see how long they last, shall we?” The old woman said to Anja, before slowly going back in the picture. In a minute, the picture was back to its original form. Rosa wasn’t in it anymore, now it was just a family.

 

I was having a hard time breathing. The stress and fear were eating me. Anja walked towards me and got down to my level. Her eye was bleeding a lot, and I could see she was in a lot of pain.

 

“Joshua, listen to me: that was not real, what you saw, in the picture, it was fake, and if she has to use this trick, that means she most likely hasn’t found her. So, we can assume she’s safe. Okay? You don’t have to kill yourself, okay, don’t even think about it…”  She stopped talking and let out a scream of pain. She turned and saw Mr. Joseph. He had hit a random painting with his rolling pin and was threatening to hit it again.

 

“Now, you explain everything to us, or I will hit that again.” He said.

 

Anja looked embarrassed. She looked down and thought about it for a moment.

 

“Fine, come with me…” She got up on her feet with difficulty and walked towards the dining room.

 

We all followed her and sat at the table. She proceeded to tell her everything. It was a lot to take in, so I’ll make you the best summary I can.

 

According to her, she was coming from another time, way before ours, hundreds of years ago. She was once tricked by some sort of witch into entering that house and the witch cursed her. Since then, she was forever linked to the house. She didn’t age and was attached to the house like a ghost. Time was moving faster for her, and she went through the ages. The witch explained to her that the only way for her to be free was to go back to her time, and to do so, she had to “catch” people in her curse. As long as someone else was stuck with her, the house would start to go back in time, but if that person died, and that she found herself alone again, it will start to move forward through time again. She was able to exit the house, but never too long. She had already tried a lot of times, but the persons always ended up killing themselves, and the witch was usually pushing them to do so, like she was currently doing with me. All the person we saw in the pictures and paintings in the hallway were the dead souls of the people she previously caught, and from what she understood, the witch was getting more powerful with each soul. But if we destroyed a picture or a painting, she would lose some power, but it was also hurting Anja.

 

She told us how guilty she felt of all the death she caused, and that she thought that was probably what the witch also wanted. She tried numerous times to accept her fate and stop catching people, but she always ended up doing it. She said she left too much people and things at her time, and couldn’t accept abandoning them. She had a little brother, a mother, a lover, and she loved them so much that she couldn’t accept to forget them.

 

I would say that that last information made me empathize with her a lot. We asked I there was a way for us to get back to our time, but, as far as she knew, there wasn’t. As long as we’ll be there, the house will keep going back in time until it reaches her time. That was certainly not the answer we wanted to hear. There was no way for us to get back to our life, to our loved ones. I was tempted to get angry at her, but the tears that were rolling down her face, her reasons and the reality that she was desperate and constantly hurt by a curse, let’s just say it made me reconsider. There was however one thing that I wanted to ask. I needed to know if I could still help my sister in any way. She told me that, now, except killing myself, the only thing that would stop my double (that is now pretty clearly the witch taking my appearance) would be to actually escape the house. If we got back to her time, the entire curse would be lifted, and we would probably be able to leave the house, and the witch would have no interest in chasing Rosa.

 

We all stayed silent for a moment. The three of us were completely down, our current situation was completely hopeless. Eventually, Mr. Joseph got up and walked towards the kitchen.

 

“What are you doing, Mr.?” Asked Elizabeth.

 

“I am going to get the biggest bottle of alcohol there is, and drink as much as I can… And stop calling me Mr., call me Michael, it’s getting exhausting… I suggest you start alcohol too. It doesn’t really matter now…” He said. He then turned to Anja. “Hey, you! How long will it take to go back to your time?”

 

Anja was caught off guard.

 

“Hum, three, maybe four months, I’m not sure.”  She answered.

 

“Okay, forget it, nobody else touches the alcohol, or there won’t be enough to last four months.” He said.

 

“Wait, are you going to stay? I mean, to stay alive, to make it to my time?” She asked.

 

“I mean, I don’t know about the two kids, but, yeah, I’ll try. Plus it doesn’t look like we have the choice, it’s either that, or I die, so…”

 

Anja turned to Elizabeth and I with an interrogative look.

 

We didn’t think much about it and nodded. We will also try to last until her time.

 

Anja started tearing. She seemed so happy, and sad at the same time. Eventually, she talked again. She thanked us, she looked a bit embarrassed. She warned me that I wouldn’t have access to internet forever. She said that as we will go back, we will get further and further away from any internet connection, and that I would eventually lose it. Apparently I still have for approximately a week of access before losing the signal.

 

I didn’t know what to do… The idea of losing all contact with my world was terrifying, but I didn’t really knew what to do of that information. My last idea was to still try to leave a message to Rosa on my phone. I didn’t have access to her number anymore, but if I actually made it to Anja’s time, my double would disappear, leaving my phone behind, and maybe Rosa would look through it. I took it out and opened the notes app. I created a new note, pinned it, and wrote the following: “look for us in local history books: Joshua, Elizabeth, Michael and Anja”. It was a shot in the dark, as I have no idea if we will have any impact, but just in case, I pinned the note. No need to try to look us up yourself, I changed our names at the beginning of the story, and I don’t think we’ll have a big enough impact to be listed anywhere on the internet. Plus, you don’t know where I am.

 

After that, we all decided to relax a little. Elizabeth put the Ariana Grande’s album on (and it’s actually pretty good), and I wrote this. I don’t know if this will be my last update or not, as I soon won’t have access to internet anymore, but if you have any question, I’m here to [answer.](https://www.reddit.com/user/markimdreaming/comments/1c1gwgd/full_universe_timeline/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
