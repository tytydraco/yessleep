Nobody at this party knows the truth. They’re all standing around holding a red solo cup drinking cheap beer they got from the Kinnley’s down the street from here. Very far down the street from here. So far from here you can’t even see it unless you know it’s there. It’s so far from here it feels like it’s on a different planet sometimes. It’s not alien though, it’s a simple gas station in which Barry probably had to lie about his age to get this cheap beer. Barry doesn’t know the truth. He probably thinks I’m just high or something. My eyes are red from the truth, not because of something so childish like weed. It’s funny how I say childish, we’re basically children but legally adults. Not old enough to afford cheap salty beer yet. 

  
The truth can’t reach here yet it still feels so close. If Barry knew the truth he probably wouldn’t have invited me to this party. Who knows if Barry will find out about the truth. I don’t even know Barry that well, so who knows if he will even care. Everyone at this party seems like they don’t care about anything. Everyone here probably has parents that probably care about them a great deal. Hopefully nothing will happen to the people here. If anything happens to them. It’s out of my hands. Everyone acts like they don’t care. But I think they do and their just scared to show it. I don’t know why’d they be scared, caring is a human emotion. I think everyone cares about something though.

  
I believe we all care about one thing: Death. Most are scared by it, some welcome it. We all feel some way about it but we all don’t know what it feels like. Unless someone knows and their just not telling me. One of my uncles died and came back to life one time but he never talks about it though. He says thinking about it scares him and keeps him up at night. I wonder if he saw something and that’s what scares him. I think if he saw nothing though that might be scarier. 

  
Barry is standing talking to Jennifer near the kitchen doorway, Tom is sitting on the couch with Francis and Dakota, Alex is playing with a lamp while nobody is paying attention to them, Chris is at snack table trying to open a can of dip that nobody will eat from once it is open, Dale and Alan already tried to open the can of dip but are now trying to set up for a keg stand, Sally is puking up her guts in the bathroom while Kenzi is giving her moral support right outside, Garret and Shirley are hooking up in Barry’s room and everyone else is talking. None of them know the truth. The truth is far away and yet it seems like it’s right behind me. 

  
The truth is not just an idea though, it’s the truth. I had an idea for a movie once. The last movie I saw was in November. It was a 3D movie. The movie felt so real that I had dreams that I was living it. I woke up and it took me hours to believe that the dream didn’t actually happen. People say that I’m crazy because of that one time. I swear I’m not crazy.   
If you were in my shoes and you wouldn’t do the same you’re a coward.  
 My mom and dad tell me they love me before I go to school everyday. They would tell me separately and used to have conversations with me. Now they talk in sync and say the same things to me. It felt so inhuman. The truth is there, someone will find it someday against my will. Someone will find it someday and hate what they see. Someone will find it some day and hate me. 

  
It was three Octobers ago, when I saw the movie, it was Solaris, the remake not the orginal, and it felt so natural. At least for a sci-fi movie. Maybe it did happen. How would any of us know. How would any of us be sure if doppelgängers were real and imitated our loved ones. There would be signs. Doppelgängers are monsters, you’d have to get rid of them. Nobody knows the truth but it’s there, you just have to find it. People call October the season of the witch. It’s inaccurate, October is not a season. October is Fall. We all fall sometimes. Sometimes we just need a push. A push to convince us to do something we’ve been dreaming of. If you truly believe something it makes it very hard to change your thoughts. Those weren’t my parents. They were false. Liars. Replicas. Doppelgängers. 

  
If the people at this party knew the truth they probably wouldn’t have invited me. They’d probably call the cops to tell them. I’m leaving before anyone knows. Not in the same way they left however. I’m taking a bus ticket after this party and getting as far as I can be from this retched town, with these retched people, all rotting here waiting to end up like them. But I won’t end up like them. I won’t complete the cycle. I’m breaking it. I’m a hero for what I did and when they find out they will say differently but I am the hero the protagonist nobody can tell me otherwise. Someday they will know. But for now. Nobody at this party knows the truth.
