I never should have entered that house.

I was exploring, searching for abandoned places. I stumbled across the house. It was old, windows boarded up, door creaked like it hadn’t opened in years. But it looked untouched, like it had just frozen in time. The kind of place that called to you, even though every instinct screamed not to go inside.

I entered the living room. I noticed it: an old radio on a dusty table. I couldn’t resist. I plugged it in, static filled the room with a low hum.

I was expecting a remnant from another era, nothing more. However, an odd thing happened as I turned the dial. The normal crackling was replaced with a clear but weak voice. A murmur.

"Leave."

I went cold. My heart was racing. Though weak and nearly unidentifiable, the voice was distinct. My initial thought? An error. However, the voice returned when I increased the volume. This time, louder.

“You shouldn’t be here. They’re coming.”

I rushed to turn it off, but before I could, the radio crackled to life, filling the room with a distorted tone. The voice became clearer.

"A knock on your door will be heard at 11:47 PM tonight. Do not open it. They are not human.”

I didn’t know what to think. Was it a joke? Maybe the house had prank equipment. But the voice was desperate. It felt real.

I couldn't get rid of the sense that I was being watched that night. My apartment, usually quiet, felt alive with an eerie presence. I tried to forget about the radio. But as the clock struck 11:47 PM, a knock came at the door. Three hard raps. My pulse spiked. I froze.

I didn’t open it. I couldn’t. I thought back to the voice on the radio. “Do not open it. They are not human.”

The knock came again. And again.

I waited. In silence. Hoping it would stop. It didn’t.

The next morning, I checked the hallway. No sign of anyone. The door hadn’t moved. Maybe I’d imagined it, maybe it was just the wind. But I looked at the radio again. And realized something terrifying.

The message had been true.

That wasn’t the worst part.

As days went on, the radio continued. The messages weren’t warnings anymore. They were prophecies. It knew things about me. Things I hadn’t told anyone. Things I didn’t understand. It began by listing events in my life that had not yet happened.

“At 2:32 PM tomorrow, you’ll receive a call from a number you don’t recognize. Don’t answer it. It will be the last time you hear from anyone.”

The next day, the call came. I didn’t answer. The number was foreign. The voice on the other end? I’m sure it would have been nothing but a whisper. But the radio still crackled, growing louder, filling my ears with static.

The worst part? Every message, every warning, came true. They were more than predictions. They were instructions. If I followed them, I stayed safe. If I ignored them, something terrible happened.

“There will be a fire. It will start on the second floor of your building. But if you leave now, you can stop it.”

I ran out the door. The fire started that night, right where the radio had predicted. I couldn’t explain how it knew, but I began to trust it. I had to.

But some messages were too cryptic. The things it warned me about, I couldn’t control.

“At midnight, they will come. They will be disguised as your family. Do not trust them. They are not who they appear to be.”

That’s when I made the mistake of going home. I thought I could outrun whatever was coming. But when I stepped inside, I saw them—my family, standing in my living room.

But their eyes were wrong. Their features contorted in an unnatural manner.

I'm not sure if I'm going crazy or if the radio is making me nervous. I'm not sure how long I can ignore these cautions. The radio has stopped talking now. The static is just a buzz, filling the background. I’m afraid it knows something worse is coming.

The last transmission I heard before silence was this:

“I’ve seen what’s coming for you. It’s too late.”

Now, I hear the knocks again. But this time, I know it’s not a warning. It’s a countdown. A countdown to the end.

And the radio? It’s still silent. But it’s waiting.
