I'm only writing this because my therapist coerced me into it. She didn't tell me to post my story to reddit. But I have to know. I need someone to tell me I didn't do it. That it wasn't my fault. I don't think I did it, but I don't know what to believe anymore. I haven't for some time. I don't want to remember. But I can't help it. It's always been there, in my mind, like a parasite. Maybe writing it down will also help me forget. I'll try anything at this point. To forget. To know.

So five years ago, around mid July, my family moved for the fifth time in three years. My dad’s job was the reason, always the reason. He never said it like it was his choice, either. Transfers, deadlines, “they need me out there,” and the kind of tired pride that came with being the person a company could throw at problems. My mom and I were sick of it, but we never said anything. Complaining felt selfish when my dad already looked like he was being slowly hollowed out. And he provided for us. So we kept quiet. 

After six and a half hours of driving we arrived in a small, Midwestern town. Not tiny, rather efficiently placed. There didn't seem to be much open space anywhere, except for the local park. But even that was pretty small. Compared to all of the other towns I had lived in, this one felt… off. Maybe it was just my brain’s pattern recognition sensing something different. Like watching one of those early motion capture animated movies, like Monster House or The Polar Express. Part of your brain told you it was so lifelike, but the other part told you otherwise. A conflict of senses. 

If you have never been to a place you can tell is watching you, it is hard to explain what I mean. There was nothing obviously wrong with the town. It was not abandoned or falling apart. It was not empty. There were cars. Stores. People. A normal skyline. A normal sky. But the moment we turned into the neighborhood where house 586 sat, I felt something settle into my stomach like a stone.

The house itself looked normal. That was part of what made it worse later. White siding. Clean windows. A neat lawn. No creepy vines, no broken shutters, no “haunted house” nonsense. It looked like the kind of place a real estate agent would describe as charming.

We spent the day unloading boxes. Dad vanished into his office with his laptop as soon as the movers left. Mom tried to make the place feel like home by putting pictures up immediately, as if hanging a family photo could convince the walls to accept us.

Once the last box was dragged inside, I asked my mom if I could ride my bike around and see the town. I was sixteen and didn’t have my license yet. To me, the bike was freedom. She barely looked up, just nodded and told me to be back before dark. I knew she was tired. We all were. But my teenage body wasn't ready to settle down yet.

I rode down the road until the neighborhood thinned into a small town center. It was not huge, but not tiny either. It had the look of a place that had been built a long time ago and then left to keep existing out of spite. Stores sat too close together. The sidewalks were cracked and patched. The streetlights looked older than the cars parked beneath them. But it all held together. 

The first place I noticed was a gas station, and I went in mostly out of habit. I wanted something to chew on while I rode back. Candy. Gum. Anything. The moment I walked inside, the air hit me.

It was warm and stale, with a musty smell like damp cardboard and old carpet. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead. The air conditioning was out, and it felt like the building had been holding its breath for a long time. 

I grabbed a bag of gummy worms and walked to the counter. The man behind the register didn’t move. He was big, balding, with heavy skin and eyes that looked like they were constantly squinting at something far away. He didn’t reach for the scanner. He didn’t greet me. He didn’t even blink for several seconds. He just stared like he was trying to decide whether I was real.

I cleared my throat. “Uh. Hi.”

He slammed his hand down on the counter hard enough to make the candy jump. “You’re new here, aren’t yuh?”

His voice was low and rough, like gravel in a drain.

I hesitated, then nodded. “Yeah. We just moved in.”

The corners of his mouth tugged upward, but didn’t reach his eyes. “We don’t get many new folks,” he said. “People don’t like leavin’. Not once they’ve been here a while. So nowhere for folks to move into.”

He leaned forward a little more, lowering his voice as if he was letting me in on a joke. “Except for house five-eight-six. Folks never stay long there.”

My stomach tightened. I laughed once, the forced kind people do when they don’t know what else to do.

“That’s my house,” I said.

For the first time, the man moved like he was remembering he had a job. He picked up the gummy worms and scanned them slowly, watching me the entire time. The register beeped, loud in the stuffy store.

“Well,” he said softly, “I guess we’ll just see how long this batch lasts.”

He didn’t ask if I needed a bag. He didn’t make small talk. He didn’t stop staring.

“That’ll be three eighty-six.”

I paid, took my candy, and left as quickly as I could without running. As I left the store, I noticed my bike was nowhere to be seen. It was gone. At first I thought I was looking in the wrong spot, like I had leaned it on the other side of the building without realizing. I walked the length of the wall. Nothing. I looked around the gas pumps. Nothing. I even checked the dumpster area behind the station like it had somehow rolled itself there.

Nothing.

The sky was turning orange at the edges. The shadows were getting longer. My mom was going to be furious.

I walked home with my candy in my hand like an idiot, glancing over my shoulder the entire way. Every time a car passed, I expected it to slow down and someone to call out, to laugh, to show me my bike in the back. But that never happened. 

The road was too quiet. The neighborhood felt too neat. The town behind me felt like it had swallowed my bike without leaving so much as a tire mark.

When I got home, my mom was annoyed, but not as mad as I expected. She asked where my bike was. I told her someone stole it. Dad barely looked up from his laptop. And I was left standing there like an idiot. I felt bad, but what could I do?

That night, after the house settled into silence and my parents went to bed, I went into the bathroom to brush my teeth. I never did the full two minutes like dentists always told me. It sounds silly now, but that just felt like a hassle. Thirty seconds later I was spitting and rinsing my mouth out. I leaned down to spit one last time, and as I lifted my head to face the mirror, I thought I saw something.

A shadow that my brain didn't recognize from just a moment ago. I squinted to make it clearer. Just a shadow. I turned around and of course nothing was there. As I turned back to face the mirror, the shadow was gone. I then had a strange feeling. Like someone standing just over my shoulder, slightly to the left.

For a split second, my brain did what brains do, and tried to make it normal. New house. New start. Don't fall back into old habits. New houses always creeped me out. But this time it felt different. I turned around.

The bathroom was empty.

I turned back to the mirror.

Still nothing.

I stared at myself for a long time, toothbrush in hand, feeling stupid. The mirror showed only me and the small bathroom behind me. The lighting was normal. The air was still. And I was just being paranoid. I went to bed and told myself I was tired, which of course I was. Exhausted even. As I laid down, covers up, I told myself this time it would be different. We wouldn't move again. I told myself that this was home, and I needed to accept it. 

The last days of summer passed by as they did everywhere else. Although I actually managed to make a friend this time, Mike. As the school year started, I was glad to find out me and him were in the same classes together. I was way too shy to make any more friends, at least on my own. August passed quickly, I got good grades, my dad worked, and my mom was tired. She was always tired. 

I had forgotten about my uneasy feelings about the town, about my own house. It was all just normal now. It had become my life. Mike probably helped a lot with that. And life went on.

But it soon stopped again. 

It was just another night, like any other. It had been a long day. Multiple tests at school that I barely studied for. Me and Mike broke a window playing walla ball with a baseball because we couldn't find a tennis ball. And I was grounded for the weekend. It was getting late that Friday, I was still stewing in anger at the yelling match I had with my parents about the broken window. It was an honest mistake, why couldn't they see that? I even offered to work to pay for it. But my parents were having none of it. I was mentally drained, and just completely done for the day. 

As I trudged up the stairs on my way to get ready for bed, I was lost in my thoughts. My angry thoughts. I walked down the hallway but as I passed the hallway mirror, I stopped. In it, I had just barely glimpsed movement behind my shoulder. My heart quickened, and my brain immediately tried to rationalize it again.

I turned.

Nothing.

I told myself it was lingering stress left from my early days in the town. That explanation worked until it started happening more often.

I told myself I was paranoid. I started grasping for any explanation. I knew that nothing was happening but my senses told me otherwise. Soon it got to the point that the hairs on my arms and the back of my neck would stand up any time I passed a mirror. Like something was always looking through, watching me.

It kept getting worse and worse, until… 

One night, I was floating through my nightly routine. This was the worst part of my day, because I knew that I would see that shadow again. It was always there. In the bathroom. In the mirror. I turned the faucet on, put my toothbrush under the water, then slowly looked up. I froze. All the lights were on in the bathroom, this was mandatory for me now. But in the corner, through the mirror, I could see a figure. Not a shadow. A clear figure that seemed steeped in darkness despite the lights. I could just make out the hood it wore.

I couldn't move, or wouldn't. I'm still not sure which it was. But I didn't move. The shadowed figure then twitched. I couldn't bring myself to turn around this time. I just stared at it. And finally, it lifted its head ever so slightly, and stared back. I could just make out two tiny dots from within the shadow of its hood. Eyes. Staring directly into my own. My heart raced, adrenaline pulsed through my veins. I built up courage as my fight or flight response activated, and I turned, spinning around so quickly I almost fell. 

Nothing. Again, nothing.

I turned back to the mirror. It was gone. I couldn't take it anymore. I didn't know if I was crazy, or if I was living in a sick demented hell. I put away my toothbrush and turned to try to go to bed. I knew I wouldn't be getting much sleep that night. But as I turned, I felt a gentle tapping on my shoulder. 

My blood ran cold, my face went pale, my body locked up and all my senses screamed. I ran out of the bathroom, slammed the door, shoved a chair in front of it and piled that chair with everything I could lift. That was it. Whatever was happening to me I couldn't ignore it anymore.

The next day I tried talking to my parents. It was after dinner, while my mom was putting dishes away and my dad was half listening to the news. 

“Do you think this house has too many mirrors?” I said, casually.

My mom laughed. “It’s a normal house.”

My dad didn’t look up. “Mirrors make spaces feel larger.”

I tried again. “Have you ever noticed anything weird with them? Like… reflections?”

My mom’s smile faded a little. She gave me the look that parents give when they think their kid is being dramatic on purpose. “Are you still upset about your bike?”

What? I thought to myself. How did she come to that conclusion? “Umm, no. I just mean like, you know, shadows and stuff. Things moving.” 

Both of my parents turned to look at me. I could see it in their eyes. “Oh no, is our kid crazy?” Their stares said. 

I then nodded and said, “yeah I guess I'm still upset about my bike.” It was easier. Although to me it didn't make sense. It had been long enough since I lost my bike that I barely thought about it. 

After that, I stopped bringing it up.

Occasionally I would think I saw something in the mirrors. But nothing like that one night. It felt like being afraid of the dark at an age you’re embarrassed to admit you still feel it. I couldn't talk to anyone about it, which might have been the worst part. I was alone. But even still, life went on. I went to school, hung out with Mike, but my grades worsened. I rarely got good sleep. And my parents seemed more and more distant. 

At first I left the bathroom light on. Then the hallway. Then a lamp in my room. I started taking my phone into the bathroom so I wouldn’t have to look in the mirror for too long. I brushed my teeth with my eyes pointed down at the sink. I shaved the peach fuzz on my upper lip without looking at my face. I avoided reflections in windows and screens. I avoided anything… and everything. 

But the less I looked, the more I felt it. You know that feeling when you think someone is staring at you, and even before you turn, you feel your skin tighten? That became my normal state.

School didn’t help. The whole town had a weirdness that was hard to explain. People were polite, but their politeness felt rehearsed. Teachers smiled too long. Students asked me questions that didn’t make sense, like how long we planned to stay, and whether we liked twins or not, and if my parents worked late. That last one happened more than once. I can't really explain it better than that. I didn't know if I was being paranoid because of what happened in my house, or if I actually noticed something worth noticing. 

I tried to make friends anyway, but aside from a few people I felt comfortable enough to say hello to, there was still only Mike. But honestly, that was enough for me. We got along very well, and we hung out most days. Eventually I felt comfortable enough to invite him over to spend the night. I didn’t tell him why. I couldn't tell him that I was too terrified to sleep on my own. I knew he would look at me the same way my parents did, and then he would grow distant too. I told him it would be fun, that my parents ordered pizza and I had a decent gaming setup. Normal sleepover stuff.

He came on a Friday night. For the first few hours, everything felt normal. We ate pizza rolls, drank soda, and played games. It was the first time since we moved in that I felt almost okay. My parents seemed relieved to see me acting like a normal teenager.

But the mirrors were still there.

At one point, my friend went to the bathroom, and I stood outside the door, listening to the faucet run, feeling ridiculous. When he came out, he looked fine. He didn’t say anything. No pale face. No confusion. No fear.

I told myself that meant it wasn’t real. I told myself. 

Later that night, after my parents went to bed, we stayed up watching stupid videos with the volume low. Around maybe two in the morning, we heard a sound from the hallway.

A soft scrape, like something being dragged gently across the floor. We paused the video. It happened again, closer this time. Mike laughed nervously and said it was probably the house settling. Old wood. Pipes. Normal noises. I wanted to believe that so badly that I nodded.

Then one of the doors down the hall creaked open. Not slammed, not thrown, just slowly opened as if someone had turned the knob carefully and pushed it. The sound was quiet and controlled.

Mike sat up. “Was that your dad?”

I shook my head. “He’s asleep. He’s always asleep this late.”

We listened. Footsteps came. Slow, light. Barely there.

Mike whispered, “Hello?”

No response.

The footsteps stopped. The hallway went silent again.

After a long minute, my friend shrugged and forced a smile. “Okay. That was weird.”

We decided together that we didn't hear what we thought we heard. And honestly, I still wasn't convinced yet that I hadn't already gone insane. We went back to the video. The tension lingered, but exhaustion eventually smothered it. Around three, maybe later, I finally fell asleep as another video played. It was the best sleep I had had in months. 

When I woke up, I rubbed my eyes and enjoyed the feeling of being well rested. It was around eleven am, and I had slept soundly the whole time. I looked around my room. Mike wasn’t there.

At first I thought he was in the bathroom. Then the kitchen. Then outside, waiting for his parents.

He wasn’t. His shoes were still by the door. His backpack was still on the floor. His phone was still plugged into an outlet in my room.

I walked through the house, calling his name quietly at first, then louder. My parents came out of their room, annoyed, and asked what I was doing.

“I guess Mike left,” I said. “ At least… I can’t find him.”

My mom frowned like she was solving a minor inconvenience. “Maybe his parents picked him up.”

“He didn’t take his stuff.”

My dad said, “Maybe he forgot it.”

My mom looked at the shoes by the door and hesitated. “That is strange.”

But then she did what adults do when something threatens to become real. She turned it into a manageable problem. She told me to call him later and ask. She told me not to worry. Mike didn't have a cell phone, and I didn't know his home phone number, or if he even had a home phone. So all I could do was wonder. 

At school on Monday, his seat was empty. I told myself he was sick. I almost believed it. Tuesday came, still empty. Wednesday, still empty. No announcement. No whispers. Just absence.

I thought about going to his house. I even hopped on my new bike and went to the address he’d given me once, because I had written it down in my phone like a normal person. When I got there, the house looked like it had been empty for years. The windows were dusty. The lawn was overgrown. The mailbox was rusted shut.

I stood on the sidewalk with my stomach turning and told myself I had the wrong address. I peddled back home, nerves twisted and mangled. But that night, I finally found him.

Looks like I've hit the character limit for reddit. I can't write anymore tonight. It's too much for me. Oh and I see the subreddit guidelines say only 1 post every 24 hours. I'll post the rest of my story sometime soon. It's all coming back to me. If you don't hear from me again I'm sorry to leave you hanging. I'll try to get the rest out. I'll try.
