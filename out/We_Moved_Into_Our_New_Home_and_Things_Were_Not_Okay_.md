I don’t remember hearing it right away. I think, at first, I convinced myself it was nothing more than the natural sounds of an old house.

 Houses make noise, that a given—creaks, groans, the wind lashing against the windows, the floorboards  
settling. That’s what I told myself when I first heard the dripping. 

But now, standing here in the basement, the sound dominated my senses. The steady drip of water hitting a  
surface filled my head, growing louder with each passing moment.

I’ve followed it, searched for it, but no matter where I went, it remained just out of reach.

My eyes scan the aged stone walls of the basement, meticulously searching for the elusive source of the  
disturbance.

But it wasn’t always like this. There was a time when this place felt like home—quaint and charming, a bit  
rough around the edges sure, but full of potential.

Sarah and I had fallen in love with the house at first sight.

The realtor had given us a brief tour, and when we reached the basement, he quickly brushed past it,  
barely mentioning the fact that it existed at all.

It seemed odd at the time, but we didn’t think much of it. Old basements are creepy; everyone knows that. 

Now I wish we had listened to our instincts. And I wish we had never set foot down here.

The dripping had started about two weeks after we had moved in. I remember Sarah complaining about it while we were eating breakfast one morning. 

"Adam, do you hear that?" she’d asked, her brow furrowed the way it always does when she’s  
frustrated. "It’s driving me insane." 

I hadn’t noticed it until she pointed it out. And that’s when I heard it for the first time.

A faint, rhythmic drip was coming from somewhere beneath us. I dismissed it—probably a leaky pipe, I  
thought. It’s an old house; these things happen, I reasoned.

That very night however, the sound, it seemed to get louder. As I lay in bed, staring up at the ceiling, I  
could hear it clearly this time.

 drip… drip… drip… drip

It sounded close, too close.

I tried to block it out, but the more I focused on it, the louder it became.

Sarah turned over next to me, restless, and I knew she was hearing it too. I could sense the tension in the  
air as she was trying her very best to ignore and sleep through it.

"Can you check it out tomorrow?" she finally whispered to me, her voice barely audible over the  
steady drip. 

"Yeah, I’ll look into it," I replied, though I was already dreading the idea of going down into  
the basement. Something about it felt off—like a cold weight settling over my  
chest.

The next day, I made my way down the narrow stairs to the basement.

Boxes were still piled up against the walls, remnants from the move we hadn’t bothered to unpack yet. The  
air smelled musty, like old earth and damp concrete. 

The dripping echoed all around me, but I couldn’t pinpoint its source.

The pipes along the ceiling looked fine—no signs of leaks or condensation. I checked the corners, the  
floor, the walls. 

Nothing.

I even crouched down near the floor drains, but they were bone dry. The sound seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at the same time. 

Frustrated, I climbed back upstairs and told Sarah I couldn’t find anything. She looked disappointed.  
She somehow hoped I would come up with some sort of magic fix. 

"You didn’t look hard enough," she said, her eyes dark with concern. "That sound is getting  
louder."

And she wasn’t wrong.

Over the next few days, the dripping grew more insistent. It followed us from room to room, a constant,  
maddening noise we couldn’t escape.

In a peculiar way, the dripping reminded me of those Chinese torture experiments I’d heard about on TV as a kid—where a person is secured in a fixed position, and water slowly drips onto the same spot on their forehead. Over time, the rhythmic dripping becomes psychologically distressing and physically uncomfortable, leading to anxiety, irritation, and even psychological breakdown, though this felt like a milder version.

And it wasn’t just the sound. The smell started shortly after—faint at first, like damp wood, but soon it became overpowering, rancid.

It clung to everything, seeping into the walls, the floors, our clothes. It chased us around like a shadow. The  
whole thing was driving Sarah mad with rage.

I finally called a plumber, thinking it had to be a hidden leak, maybe a burst pipe we couldn’t see. 

But something strange thing happened when the plumber arrived at our doorstep.

 The dripping, it stopped the moment he set foot in the house.

He came, checked the entire house top to bottom, and found nothing. Not a single drop of water where it wasn’t supposed to be. 

The rancid smell we had grown accustomed to, seemed to vanish in his presence too. 

As we watched him go through every room, running his checks, we could hardly believe our senses. Sarah and I looked at each other perplexed.

"I don’t know what to tell you," he said finally, scratching his head. "Everything looks fine to  
me. Are you sure it’s not just in your head?"

I wish it had been in our heads.

That night, the smell grew worse. Sarah was coughing, gagging from the stench, and I wasn’t doing much  
better.

We couldn’t sleep, not with  
that goddamn dripping and the rotten odor.

Desperate, I grabbed a flashlight and headed back down to the basement in the middle of the night,  
determined to find the source. 

This time, I noticed something I hadn’t seen before.

In the farthest corner, behind a stack of old furniture the previous owners had left behind, there was something odd—a patch of the wall that looked different. The wood was older, splintering, almost as if it didn’t belong to  
the rest of the foundation. That’s when I realized it was a fake wall. The dripping sound seemed to be coming from behind it.

I cleared away the furniture, my heart pounding. As I removed the last piece, I saw it—behind the wall was a sealed well, hidden away, as if someone had wanted it forgotten.

It was small, barely large enough to fit a person, with a rusted metal cover and bricks haphazardly piled around it as if someone had tried to seal it off quickly.

My stomach turned as the rancid smell hit me full force. I gagged, pulling my shirt over my nose, but I  
couldn’t tear my eyes away. 

The dripping had stopped.

I called Sarah down to see it for herself, and her reaction was much like mine—horror and disgust. We debated  
what to do, but the smell had become unbearable. We needed to open the well,  
air it out, get rid of whatever was causing the stench. 

The moment I pried the cover off, a wave of cold air rushed out, thick and stale, like something had been  
trapped down there for decades.

I peered inside, shining the flashlight into the well, but there was no water. It was dry—bone dry. 

That’s when I saw it.

Wet, slick footprints trailed up the stone walls from the bottom of the well. My heart skipped a beat. There  
were only footprints and nothing else.

"What the hell is this?" Sarah whispered, her voice trembling.

"I don’t know," I replied, stepping back, my legs weak. "We need to seal it."

We hastily put the cover back on, but it was too late. The damage was done.

That night, the dripping returned—louder, more insistent. And this time it was followed by footprints as  
well.

At first, they were subtle—small, damp marks near the basement stairs, as if someone had walked  
through water.

But as the days passed, the footprints grew more frequent, larger, appearing where they shouldn’t: on the  
walls, the ceiling, even in our bedroom. They materialized without warning and  
slowly faded away, leaving us frozen in terror.

It felt like something invisible was living in our midst, casually keeping an eye on us at will.

I suggested to Sarah that maybe we should leave, but she refused. We had sunk all our life savings into this  
place. Walking away was unthinkable.

"This is our home, Adam," she said, her voice firm. "We can figure this out. Give it a  
few more days. We’ll get to the bottom of it."

I wanted to believe her. I wanted to think we could fix whatever was wrong. But all I could hear was  
drip... drip... drip.

But what truly made me paranoid were the whispers.

It started during dinner. At first, faint—barely audible, like an echo.

 But soon, they grew louder, more distinct, as though voices were calling out from the depths of my  
mind. 

*"Adam... whhhhherrree  arre  youuuuuuu..?,"* a raspy voice echoed in my head.

*“Come down the stairs….. to the basement,”*

*“Open the lid and set me free Adam.”*

*“I am waiting…..”*

I tried to brush it off, telling myself it was just stress. 

But then I saw Sarah’s face go pale, her eyes darting away as panic consumed her. I knew at that instant that she heard it too.

Finally, I put my foot down and told her we were moving out. If it meant spending a few nights in a cheap  
motel, so be it—we were leaving first thing in the morning. I didn’t care about the money anymore; I was ready to sell the place or even tear the house down to the ground if that’s what it took.

To my surprise, she didn’t fight me this time.

As I watched her lay down for bed that night, relief washed over me, and I fell into a fitful sleep.

But when I woke up in the middle of the night, she was gone. She wasn’t in the bathroom either. My heart  
raced as I passed the kitchen and saw the basement door standing ajar.

I descended the stairs, breathless, and found Sarah standing near the well.

She had already removed the lid and stood motionless, as if in a trance. 

Moonlight from a nearby window illuminated the well’s mouth, casting an eerie glow over its edges.

"Sarah?" I whispered, my throat dry as I crept closer.

She didn’t respond. Her eyes were glazed, her face ashen white, and staring into the abyss.

 And then I saw it—a pale, gaunt figure slowly lifting its head over the edge of the well, its eyes  
glinting in the moonlight. Its mottled skin stretched tight over its bones, giving it an unsettling almost ghostly appearance.

Strands of dark, matted hair clung to its scalp, casting shadows over its hollow features. It extended a  
bony hand toward Sarah, palm outstretched, silently beckoning her.

At that moment, everything started to unfold in slow motion as I watched Sarah extend her hand and move towards the creature. 

I screamed running and yanked Sarah back. We collapsed to the floor as she fell into my arms, suddenly  
breaking free from the trance. She hugged me tightly, relief evident on her face. 

 But deep down, I knew she had already made contact with the creature.

Because the dripping suddenly stopped. The smells disappeared. The whispers fell silent. And the house became completely still.

There was pin drop silence all around.

And the creature had simply vanished.

After that night, I left the house immediately. It’s been five years since the incident, and we eventually moved to a small house in the suburbs, but life has never been the same. I took Sarah to every doctor, and they ran all kinds of tests. Each one gave her a clean bill of health, insisting that there was nothing wrong with her.

But Sarah …..she never heard another sound again.
