I’ve never been one for public transportation, but on that particular night, I had no choice. My car was in the shop, and the only way to get home was the late-night train that rumbled through the city like a tired, old beast. The station was nearly empty, save for a few stragglers—night workers, drunks, and a man in a long coat who stood too still to be anything but unsettling.

I tried not to look at him as I bought my ticket. The machine sputtered and spat it out like it was spitting out a curse. The ticket felt heavier than it should have in my hand, the ink slightly smudged, as if it had been printed in haste.

I boarded the train and found an empty car. The fluorescent lights flickered, casting strange, fleeting shadows that made the empty seats seem occupied. I took a seat by the window, staring out at the darkness, trying to ignore the growing unease gnawing at my gut.

The doors closed with a soft hiss, and the train lurched forward. The station slipped away, replaced by the blur of the city’s underbelly—a place of forgotten streets, decaying buildings, and shadows that seemed to stretch and shift as if they had a life of their own.

The car was quiet, save for the low hum of the train and the occasional creak of metal. I was alone, or at least, I thought I was. I must have dozed off because the next thing I knew, the train had stopped. I glanced around, confused. We hadn’t reached my stop yet. The sign outside read **"Morton Ave.,"** a station I’d never heard of before.

The train shouldn’t have stopped here. The map on the wall didn’t even list it as a stop. But the doors slid open anyway, and a cold breeze swept in, carrying with it the smell of damp earth and something else… something rotten.

That’s when I saw them—figures in the distance, shrouded in darkness. They moved toward the train, their steps slow and deliberate. There was something wrong with them, something deeply unsettling. My skin crawled as I realized they weren’t walking; they were floating, their feet barely touching the ground.

The lights flickered again, and I could see their faces—pale, gaunt, eyes sunken deep into their sockets. They didn’t belong in this world. They were ghosts, or something worse. And they were getting closer.

Panic surged through me. I pressed the button to close the doors, but it didn’t respond. The figures were almost at the platform now, their hollow eyes fixed on me. I slammed the button again, and again, until finally, the doors began to close. But it was too late. One of them had reached the edge of the platform, and with a sudden, inhuman speed, it lunged forward, its hand outstretched.

The doors shut just as its fingers brushed against the glass. I stumbled back, my heart racing. The train jerked forward, leaving the station behind. I watched as the figures disappeared into the darkness, but the fear didn’t leave me. It clung to me like a second skin.

I wanted to get off at the next stop, but something told me that wasn’t a good idea. Something told me that Morton Ave. wasn’t a station meant for the living. I stayed in my seat, trying to shake off the terror, trying to convince myself that it was all a bad dream.

But then, the lights began to flicker again, and the air grew colder. The hum of the train grew louder, more distorted, as if it was struggling against something. I glanced at the map on the wall, and my blood ran cold.

The train wasn’t following its usual route. The familiar station names were gone, replaced by strange, unfamiliar ones—**"Ashwood," "Black Hollow," "Widow’s Peak."** Places that didn’t exist, or at least, not in my world.

I was on a train to nowhere, a train that was slowly slipping out of reality. I could feel it, the thinning of the air, the way the shadows seemed to grow longer, darker. The train was taking me somewhere I wasn’t supposed to go, somewhere I’d never return from.

The last stop was approaching. I could see it on the map—**"Terminus."** The word sent a shiver down my spine. I knew, deep down, that if I stayed on the train until then, I’d be lost forever.

But as I stood to move, the train lurched violently, throwing me off balance. The lights went out, plunging the car into darkness. I could hear something moving in the shadows, something that wasn’t human.

I ran, stumbling through the dark, trying to reach the door at the end of the car. But the door wouldn’t budge. I was trapped. The sound of something scraping along the floor grew louder, closer. I turned, pressing myself against the door, and in the faint light of the passing tunnels, I saw it—a figure, no, a mass of shadows, writhing and twisting as it slithered towards me.

Its face, if you could call it that, was a void, a black hole that seemed to suck in all light, all hope. It reached out to me, its fingers elongating into sharp, claw-like appendages. I could feel the cold emanating from it, the icy grip of death.

I screamed, but no sound came out. My throat was tight, my breath shallow. The shadow creature was almost upon me when, suddenly, the train screeched to a halt.

The doors behind me slid open, and I fell backward onto a platform. The creature hissed, recoiling from the light that poured in from above. I scrambled to my feet and ran, not looking back, not stopping until I was out of the station and back in the city’s dimly lit streets.

I don’t know how long I ran or how I found my way home. But when I finally did, I collapsed on my bed, shaking, unable to sleep, unable to forget.

I never took the train again. I couldn’t. Because every time I closed my eyes, I saw that map, those station names that didn’t belong in this world. And every time I heard the distant sound of a train whistle, I felt a cold chill run down my spine.

I don’t know where that train was taking me, but I do know this: there are places in this world, places on the fringes of reality, where the living have no business going. And once you cross that line, once you step into that darkness, there’s no turning back.
