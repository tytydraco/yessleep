The walls were closing in, $40,000 in student loans suffocating me, instant ramen my only meal in a paper-thin apartment. The pandemic had crushed my barista job, leaving my bank account gasping at $12.37. I was treading water, barely, when the messages started. Random accounts, new ones every day, slipping into my DMs: “Start an OnlyFans. You’ll get rich. Trust me.”  

I thought they were bots, some creep’s twisted prank. But they kept coming, sharper, like they saw through me: “Start an OnlyFans. It’ll change your life. Or end it.” I don’t know why they shook me so bad, maybe I was desperate, but when my landlord taped a third eviction notice to my door, I caved.  

I wasn’t stupid. OnlyFans meant baring myself, but I’d be careful. I created Avery, a version of me who was fearless, seductive, nothing like quiet Joce who faded into shadows. I used filters, wigs, clever angles to keep my face secret. My first post, a shadowy hint, got 50 subscribers overnight. By the week’s end, I had 200, and the tips were unreal. $500. $800. $1200. Every ping on my phone was a high, like I was finally someone. I paid rent, bought groceries, got a new phone. I was flying.  

But the rush dragged something heavy. Comments turned hungry, less “you’re gorgeous,” more “give us everything.” If I didn’t give in, they got nasty: “You’re nothing without us.” I called them trolls, until I noticed something worse. Subscribers started dropping details they shouldn’t know: “Loved your red hoodie today, Joce.”

 “You looked stressed at the library.” I never shared my real life, never showed my face, but they knew. It started small, like coincidences, but soon it was every day, someone mentioning my favorite coffee shop, the exact time I left my apartment, even the song I’d been humming on the bus. My skin crawled, but I kept posting. I needed the money.  

Then he appeared. Username: Collector_J. No profile pic, just a void. His first message was too calm: “You’re perfect, Evangeline. You don’t belong here.”  

My heart stopped. Evangeline wasn’t my name. Nobody, not even my old roommates, knew about OnlyFans. I blocked him, but the next day, another account: “You can’t hide, Evangeline. I see you.” I deleted it, locked down every setting, but the messages kept coming, like he was wired into my phone: “You owe me, Evangeline. Come back.” They weren’t just texts, they’d pop up in my notes app, my email drafts, even my calculator history once, just that name, Evangeline, over and over.  

Sleep became a ghost. My phone buzzed all night, notifications from strangers who knew my routine, what I wore, where I ate. My apartment felt like a trap, like eyes were burning through the walls. I’d catch shadows in my peripheral vision, shapes that vanished when I turned.

One night, I woke to scratching at my window, fourth floor, no way up. I yanked the curtains shut, shaking, but in the morning, white lilies sat outside my door. The note read: “You looked terrified last night, Evangeline. I’m watching.” I tore it up, checked the locks, but the smell of those flowers lingered for days, like it was soaked into my skin.  

I didn’t delete OnlyFans then. I should’ve, but the money was my lifeline, and I thought I could gut it out. I started filming in a corner of my apartment, away from windows, using a cheap backdrop to hide anything personal. It didn’t help. The comments got weirder, more specific: “Why’d you move the lamp, Joce?” “That green wall’s new.” I hadn’t shown my apartment, not once, but they saw it. I stopped eating in my kitchen, stopped sleeping in my bed, curling up on the couch instead, and the phone clutched like a weapon.  

Then the video hit. I logged in to check my tips and saw a post I didn’t make. A blurry video, shot from above my bed, showing me sleeping. No wig, no filters, just Joce, laid bare, my real face exposed. The caption: “Evangeline, unmasked. Mine.” Comments exploded: “We see you now.” “You’re ours.” My subscribers spiked to thousands overnight, but their profiles were blank, names just numbers, all chanting: “Come home, Evangeline.” I watched the video again, hands shaking, trying to figure out how it was filmed. There was no camera in my room, no way anyone could’ve gotten in. But there I was, vulnerable, watched by thousands of eyes that weren’t human.  

I deleted OnlyFans that day, hands trembling so bad I could barely tap the screen. I erased Avery, changed my email, my number, my locks. I even threw out my laptop, thinking it was compromised. It didn’t stop. Gifts started showing up: earrings I’d browsed online, a notebook I’d lost in high school, a photo of me at 16 from an angle I’d never seen, like someone was standing over me. Each had a note: “You’re mine, Evangeline.” I burned the photo, but the next day, another appeared under my pillow, identical, the ink still wet.  

I moved to a new apartment, thinking distance would help. The first night, I found a crack in my bathroom mirror, hairline thin, like it’d been scratched from the inside. I covered it with a towel, but the gifts followed: a bracelet I’d never seen, a torn page from a 60s fashion magazine, a key that didn’t fit any lock I owned. My new phone, barely a week old, started glitching, apps opening on their own, photos I didn’t take filling my gallery, all of the mirrors, reflecting nothing but darkness.  

Then Collector_J texted my new number, one I hadn’t shared: “I have something you want, Evangeline. A video. Not yours. Hers. Do what I ask, and I’ll give it to you. Don’t, and everyone sees your face again.”  

My stomach dropped. Another video? Hers? I didn’t know what he meant, but the threat of my face being exposed again, after that nightmare post, was too much. He sent a photo next: a grainy still of a woman who looked like me, dressed in 60s clothes, her eyes wide with fear, standing in front of a mirror. The text: “She’s why they watch you. First request: find an old payphone, call the number I send, say her name three times. $500. I’ll know if you don’t.”  

I couldn’t breathe. That woman, her face so close to mine, and the idea that she was tied to this, to me, made my skin crawl. I didn’t want to do it, but the video he promised, it might explain who Evangeline was, why he was doing this. And if I didn’t, he’d ruin me, splash my face across the internet for those faceless subscribers to devour. So I went. I found a payphone, rusted and half-dead, in a sketchy lot. The number connected to static, then a faint hum, like someone breathing. I whispered “Evangeline” three times, my voice breaking, and hung up. My phone buzzed: $500 in my account, and a text: “Good. She heard you.”  

The requests kept coming, each one weirder, each one tightening the knot in my chest. He texted: “Find a woman’s scarf from the 60s in a thrift store, wear it for a day. $700. I’ll know if it’s not hers.” I rummaged through musty shelves, found a silk scarf with faded flowers, and wore it. It reeked of old perfume, and all day, I felt watched, like the fabric was choking me. When I took it off, my neck had faint red marks, like fingerprints. I tried to throw it out, but it was back in my closet the next morning, neatly folded. The payment came: “She liked it, Evangeline.”  

Another request: “Take a Polaroid of yourself, leave it under a streetlight at midnight. $900. Don’t look back when you walk away.” I used a beat-up camera from a pawn shop, snapped the photo, and left it where he said. Footsteps echoed behind me, too close, but I didn’t look. The next morning, the Polaroid was outside my door, my face scratched out, replaced with hers, eyes hollow. I locked it in a drawer, but that night, I heard scratching inside, like nails on wood. The payment came: “She’s closer now, Evangeline.”  

He asked me to record a voice memo, just me reading a poem he sent, something about mirrors and lost names, and upload it to a dead website. $1000. I did it, my voice shaking as I read the words, feeling like they weren’t mine. The site was gone the next day, but my phone started playing the memo at random, even when powered off, her voice mixing with mine, saying “Evangeline” at the end. The money hit: “She’s speaking through you, Evangeline.”  

The last request was the worst: “Stand in front of a mirror, hold a candle, stare at your reflection for ten minutes. $1200. Don’t blink too much.” I did it, hands shaking as the flame danced. My reflection started to shift, my eyes turning older, emptier. She smiled, a woman who wasn’t me, her lips moving silently, forming my name, Jocelyn. I dropped the candle, and the room went dark, but her face stayed, glowing in the glass. The money hit: “She sees you, Evangeline.”  

Every request made her stronger. I started seeing her everywhere. In mirrors, windows, my phone screen, even a spoon. A woman who looked like me but wasn’t. Her eyes were wrong, too old, too empty, like she’d seen something awful. I’d blink, and she’d vanish, but each time, I felt less like Joce. My dreams were hell. I’d wake up choking, trapped in a house I’d never seen, her voice calling me Evangeline, hands dragging me into darkness. Sometimes I’d wake with bruises, faint marks on my arms, like someone had held me too tight.  

I tried to fight back. I stopped looking at reflective surfaces, taped paper over every mirror, kept my phone face-down. It didn’t matter. My reflection found me, in puddles, in other people’s glasses, in the shine of a doorknob. Once, I caught her in the window of a passing car, not just standing but walking, matching my steps, her head tilted like she was studying me. I ran home, locked the door, but my keys were gone the next day, replaced with that same strange key from the gifts, cold to the touch.  

Last week, I found a Polaroid in my mailbox. A woman who could’ve been my twin, same jaw, same hair, dressed in clothes from the 60s. On the back, in faded ink: “Evangeline, 1963.” My phone buzzed, a text from Collector_J: “She was sold too, Evangeline. Betrayed by her pictures. One last request. Check your closet.”
 
I didn’t want to, but my legs moved like they weren’t mine. I opened the closet, and there was a mirror I’d never seen, full-length, edges cracked. My reflection wasn’t me. It was her, Evangeline, smiling, her eyes boring into mine. She raised a hand, pressed it against the glass, and whispered my name, Jocelyn, like she owned me. The air turned thick, and I swear I smelled those lilies again, sharp and wrong. I stumbled back, but the mirror kept showing her, even when I turned away.  
I smashed it, broke it into a hundred pieces, but every shard still showed her face. My phone buzzed, a video from an unknown number. It was me, smashing the mirror, but from an angle inside the closet, like someone was right behind me. The text: “You’re hers now, Evangeline.”  

He never sent the video he promised, the one of her. I don’t know who Collector_J is, or why he’s doing this. I don’t know why my eyes are starting to look like hers, why my hands shake when I catch my reflection. I found out Evangeline was real, a woman from the 60s who vanished after posing for private photos, her life chewed up by men who thought they owned her. The requests, the money, they were traps, tying me to her, like I’m reliving her betrayal through OnlyFans. I’ve moved again, but the gifts keep coming, the mirrors keep cracking, and last night, I found that scarf draped over my chair, the red marks back on my neck. I’m posting this from a library computer because my phone’s not safe, my apartment’s not safe, I’m not safe. If you know anything about a woman named Evangeline from 1963, please tell me. I need to know what I’m becoming.  

I’m not just Joce now. She’s taking over, and I’m terrified she’s already won.
