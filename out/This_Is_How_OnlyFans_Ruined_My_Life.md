The world felt like it was closing in, $40,000 in student loans suffocating me, instant ramen my only meal in a paper-thin apartment. The pandemic had gutted my barista job, leaving my bank account gasping at $12.37. That’s when the messages started. Random accounts, new ones every day, creeping into my DMs: “Start an OnlyFans. You’ll get rich. Trust me.”  

I thought they were bots, some creep’s sick game. But they kept coming, sharper, like they saw through me: “Start an OnlyFans. It’ll change your life. Or end it.” I don’t know why they hit so hard, maybe I was desperate, but when my landlord taped a third eviction notice to my door, I broke.  

I wasn’t careless. OnlyFans meant exposing myself, but I’d be smart. I created Avery, a version of me who was fearless, seductive, nothing like quiet Joce who stayed out of sight. I used filters, wigs, clever angles to keep my face hidden. My first post, a shadowy tease, got 50 subscribers overnight. By the week’s end, I had 200, and the tips were unreal. $500. $800. $1200. Every ping on my phone was a rush, like I was worth something. I paid rent, bought groceries, got a new phone. I was alive again.  

But the high dragged something dark with it. Comments turned greedy, less “you’re gorgeous,” more “give us everything.” If I didn’t cave, they got vicious: “You’re nothing without us.” I called them trolls, until I saw something worse. Subscribers started mentioning things they shouldn’t know: “Loved your red hoodie today, Joce.” “You looked stressed at the library.” I never shared my real life, never showed my face, but they knew.  
Then he showed up. Username: Collector_J. No profile pic, just a void. His first message was too calm: “You’re perfect, Evangeline. You don’t belong here.”  

My heart stopped. Evangeline wasn’t my name. Nobody, not even my old roommates, knew about OnlyFans. I blocked him, but the next day, another account: “You can’t hide, Evangeline. I see you.” I deleted it, locked down every setting, but the messages kept slipping through, like he was inside my phone: “You owe me, Evangeline. Come back.”  

Sleep became a ghost. My phone buzzed all night, notifications from strangers who knew my routine, what I wore, where I studied. My apartment felt like a cage, like eyes were pressing through the walls. One night, I woke to scratching at my window, fourth floor, no way up. I yanked the curtains shut, shaking, but in the morning, white lilies sat outside my door. The note read: “You looked terrified last night, Evangeline. I’m watching.”  

I didn’t delete OnlyFans then. I should’ve, but the money was my lifeline, and I thought I could tough it out. Then the video hit.  

I logged in to check my tips and saw a post I didn’t make. A blurry video, shot from above my bed, showing me sleeping. No wig, no filters, just Joce, laid bare. The caption: “Evangeline, unmasked. Mine.” Comments exploded: “We see you now.” “You’re ours.” My subscribers spiked to thousands overnight, but their profiles were blank, names just numbers, all chanting: “Come home, Evangeline.”  

I deleted OnlyFans that day, hands trembling so bad I could barely tap the screen. I erased Avery, changed my email, my number, my locks. It didn’t matter. Gifts started showing up: earrings I’d browsed online, a notebook I’d lost years ago, a photo of me at 16 from an angle I’d never seen, like someone was standing over me. Each had a note: “You’re mine, Evangeline.”  

Collector_J texted my new phone, one I hadn’t shared: “Look outside, Evangeline. She’s waiting.”  

I peeked through the blinds, heart hammering. Nothing was there, but when I turned back, my laptop was open, screen glowing. It showed a live feed of my apartment, my kitchen, me standing frozen. The angle was from my ceiling, but I don’t have a camera there. Text crawled across: “You can’t leave her, Evangeline.”  

I unplugged everything, smashed my webcam, moved to a new place across town. The messages followed, hitting my new phone, my new email: “You’re running out of places to hide.” Photos started coming, of me in my new apartment, making coffee, reading, sleeping. One was me in my bathroom, brushing my teeth, taken from inside the mirror. I taped a towel over it, but the next day, it was gone, and a note was stuck to the glass: “Evangeline sees you too.”  

I started seeing her. In reflections, not just mirrors, windows, my phone screen, even a spoon. A woman who looked like me but wasn’t. Her eyes were wrong, too old, too empty, like she’d seen something awful. I’d blink, and she’d be gone, but each time, I felt less like Joce. My dreams were worse. I’d wake up choking, trapped in a house I’d never seen, her voice calling me Evangeline, hands dragging me into darkness.  

Last week, I found a Polaroid in my mailbox. A woman who could’ve been my twin, same jaw, same hair, but dressed in clothes from the 60s. On the back, in faded ink: “Evangeline, 1963.” My phone buzzed right after, a text from Collector_J: “She was sold too, Evangeline. Betrayed by her pictures. Check your closet.”  

I didn’t want to, but my legs moved on their own. I opened the closet, and there was a mirror I’d never seen, full-length, edges cracked. My reflection wasn’t me. It was her, Evangeline, smiling, her eyes locked on mine. She raised a hand, pressed it against the glass, and whispered my name, Jocelyn, like she knew me. I stumbled back, but the mirror kept showing her, even when I turned away.  

I smashed it, broke it into a hundred pieces, but every shard still showed her face. My phone buzzed, a video from an unknown number. It was me, smashing the mirror, but from an angle inside the closet, like someone was right behind me. The text: “You’re almost hers, Evangeline.”  

I don’t know who Collector_J is, or why he’s doing this. I don’t know why Evangeline’s eyes are starting to look like mine. I found out she was real, a woman from the 60s who disappeared after posing for private photos, her life eaten up by men who thought they owned her. Now she’s in me, tied to me because I sold myself too, through OnlyFans, just like her pictures. I’m posting this from a library computer because my phone’s not safe, my apartment’s not safe, I’m not safe. If you know anything about a woman named Evangeline from 1963, please tell me. I need to know what I’m becoming.  

I’m not just Joce now. She’s taking over, and I’m terrified she’s already won.
