I found the key to my revenge in a dark wood, in the middle of nowhere

I find myself in middle of nowhere, a small town sheltered in an endless sea of pine trees. It’s a miserable place with only 3 things you can do, hunting, fishing, or church. But my life was not always like this, before winding up in this hick town, I lived with my mother by the sunny shores of California. That was 4 months ago, then some idiot rammed into her car, fleeing the area, and leaving my mother in a coma. Now I’ve been shipped down to nowhere, to stay with Paul, my estranged dad, and Jim my brother. Every day I wake expecting a call to tell me she woke up and I could get out of this dreary place. That never happened, and that old bastard, keeps telling me that I should get comfortable here, I shouldn’t expect her to wake up anytime soon. I don’t care what they say she’s not brain dead, she’ll be fine. I know she will wake up eventually, so I still haven’t fully unpacked my bags, or bothered making friends. It’s not worth the effort, not that I even want to befriend the hillbillies in this town. 



But something has been eating at me for the past 4 months. A deep burning hatred, it flares up whenever my thoughts turn to my mother. That dammed bastard, the one that crashed into her, he got away with it, the police could never track him down. I couldn’t think of facing my mother again, not until that bastard got what’s coming to him. So that bring us to the present.  Standing in a clearing of the dark forest, a full moon hung in the night sky, thin wisp of clouds drifted across the black expanse above, backlit by brilliant display of the unfamiliar stars and constellations (which in California would usually be hidden by the city lights).  It was cold in this nowhere place, so I was wrapped in two wool shirts and deep blue jacket.  A cold wind buffeted my back, sending a chill down my spine and set the trees gently swaying back and forth. 



“BARK”. 



Down at my side stood Spot, that dammed beast was a mutt, half Labrador half something unknown.  He had a thick dark coat, with many small light brown patches. He had been bothering me ever since I arrived in this town. The mutt followed me around everywhere, always trying to draw some pets out of me, or coax me into throwing a ball. The creature never left me alone for a minute, he always by my side, always hyper. His large bushy tail was wagging madly, as we trudged into the clearing. In the middle of the clearing sat a large circle deeply cut into the forest floor, a pentagram was carved inside the circle and within the pentagram sat an intricate pattern. The patten looked like an inverted triangle with a T coming out from the point of the triangle. Inside it the triangle an ankh sigh was drawn. On each of the points of the pentagram sat a small firepits, burning brightly, emitting faint sparks under the wind’s encouragement. 



I was responsible for this strange scene. I tried everything I could to find the bastard. I reached out to a private detective, but I couldn’t afford him, and Paul wouldn’t pay for it either.  The police told me to stop calling, they would tell me if they found anything, absolutely useless. I reached out to all the stores near the crash, not even a single one had a camera facing the street, how was that even possible? But I won’t accept it, I can’t. If mortals can’t help me then maybe something else can. So, I turned to help from the dark leather bound book clutched in the right hand. It was the genuine article, a book that belonged to Michelle Renfield, a local Healer that lived in Massachusetts in 1753. While she was burned at the stake, but her grimoire survived.



At first I went searching the internet, I made a few posts, looking for help or advice on summoning anything that could help me.  I mostly just got junk responses, scammer, or people wasting my time. Then I received a cryptic message “I have a powerful grimoire, the genuine article, if your serious about this. call this number”. I was very skeptical, but I gave it a shot and I called the number, “Hello you messaged me about a having a book, one that could be used in summonings” He seemed very skittish, and nervously asked “Yes, I have the book you need”, “How much is this ganna cost me” I asked slightly sarcastic expecting a scam but he replied, clearly scared “You don’t pay for this type of thing with money. You can have it; you can have it. But you need to make me a vow now, an oath that you will follow its instructions perfectly, all right” I replied seriously “I swear on my life, my mothers, hell, on own dammed soul, if it can help me get to him, I’ll follow its instructions to the letter”, he let out a sigh and said in a much calmer tone “Where am I sending it too”. I gave him the address of my new school. To my surprise two days later a package arrived for me at the school reception. Inside that package sat and ancient book, old worn leather held together ancient papers with neat hand written notes, it really did seem like a real grimoire” 



Inside the pages of that book I found detailed instructions, and a sigil, the same one carved into the forest floor. I spent the next two weeks in the forest preparing for the ritual. As per the books instructions the sigil was cut at least 10 inches down into the dirt. Buckled to my belt was hunting knife, and as instructed it was desecrated. I got some holy water from the church, dripped some of my blood into it and added petals from the nightshade flower. I took me a full week of searching the forest to find those blossoms. I then left the blade to soak into the liquid for an hour, took it out of the mixture and dried it over a candle, while chanting a reparative script in an unknown language. I burned the blade black, and I don’t really know why, but the blade stayed black afterwards. I couldn’t even rub the black soot off the blade. Then I waited until the full moon and snuck out the house taking Spot with me.



I guided us to the centre of the sigil and ordered Spot “SIT”. He cocked his head to the side staring straight at me with those big dumb eyes, sitting down in the center of the pentagram. I drew the knife in my right hand and knelt down next to Spot. I placed my left hand gently on head, petting him. He started to lick at my hand, ticking me gently. “Sorry Spot”. I shakily raised my right hand, pressing the blade against his neck. The dumb mutt just kept licking at my left hand, tail wagging in the dirt. I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and shakily thrust my right hand forward, while pulling close with my left hand, clutching him to my chest. Spot let a loud Yip, fighting against my grip for a second. Then with a low whine, stopped struggling. I opened my eyes, looking down at Spot, my vision was blurry, but after blinking a few times and wiping the liquid from my face, my visioned cleared. Spot lay still on the ground, spilling a red torrent onto the ground, running down the furrows cut in the forest floor, the ones making up the sigil. I could feel his blood, leaking down, soaking into my pants and the lower part of my shirts. It warmed me at first, then as the wind blew through the clearing it chilled me to the bone. 



I closed my eyes again, focusing on my breathing and followed the instructions of the book. I emptied my mind of thoughts focusing on my breathing instead. Soon a sensation of falling overcame me. After falling for several minutes in the darkness of my mind, a light appeared, resolving into a dark room. Cold stone walls surrounded me, and in front of me stood a large altar, atop that altar sat Spot, happy and tail still wagging. I walked over to the altar and called out. Both in my mind and in the real world.   



“Lord Satan, by your grace, grant me, I pray thee the power to conceive in my mind and to execute that which I desire to do, the end which I would attain by thy help, O Mighty Satan, the one TRUE GOD who livest and reignest forever and ever. I make this offering to you and entreat thee to inspire ABADDON the prince of war to manifest before me that he may give me true and faithful answers, so that I may accomplish my desired end, provided that it is proper to his office. This I respectfully and humbly ask in Your Name, Lord Satan, may you deem me worth, Father”.   



I felt something sir in the dark corners of the stone room in my mind, then “WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING” that voice pulled me from my meditation. I jerked my head around and saw my brother Jim, he was standing behind me, at the edge of the clearing. His eyes were filled with anger, and he was slowly walking towards me. “J-j-j-im, what are you doing here” I asked trying to find an excuse to get out of this. “WHAT AM I DOING, WHAT ARE Y…..” his voice trailed off as he saw Spot. He froze staring at Spot and I froze staring at him. “Jim its, its not what you think” I said pleading, this brought Jim’s attention off of Spot and onto me.  He screamed something and charged at me, Jim loved playing football and it made him a massive hunk of muscle, I had no way of standing up or dodging out of the way before his bulk slammed into me. He swung his fits down, slamming it into my face. I felt something tear, and my vision went dark, and my body went limp. But that didn’t spare me from the repeated punches that he kept throwing into me.  While he was punching me, I could hear him saying “YOU BASTARD, HOW COULD YOU, YOU MURDERER, YOU DAMMED MONSTER” after what seemed like an eternity, the punches stopped falling. 



I open my eyes, looking up at Jim, my left eye was swollen shut. My right was also pretty busted up, but I could still make out his shape. He took a deep breath and spit down onto me, “You’re trash, If only I was with Mom instead of you, then maybe she’d still be alive, she deserved better than you”. His words stung far more than his punches. I could feel the blood drip down my face, and I said something stupid through my torn lips and fractured teeth “I wish you would die slowly and burn in hell, you and that deadbeat Paul”. He looked down at me again, and anger filled his face again, I was about to say something, but was interrupted by a wispy voice, which echoing around us, carried on the wind “SUCH A GOOD OFFERING”. I wasn’t sure when he got there, one second nothing was there, the next a massive man towered over me. He was at least 8 ft tall, black metal plate armor covered his entire body; he looked like a fantasy knight. Sharp spikes adorned the metal armor, and the gauntlets formed sharp metal claws. The only unarmored part of his body was his head. He had a strong handsome face, snow white skin, short pitch-black hair and a black large mustache, but his eyes, I will never forget them. Empty black pits going into the depth of the abyss. 



“Well then boy, shall you die with honor, or will you die a sheep”.  Abaddon said in a gentle airy tone. However, Jim didn’t say anything he took one look into those twin abysses and ran. He didn’t get far, I couldn’t follow Abaddon’s movement, one minute he was standing over me, the next he was in front of Jim. Jim was now dangling in the air, Abaddon had grabbed him by the arm and lifted off his feet. “Sheep it is”, and Jim screamed, as he flew through the air back into the clearing, landing not too far from me. Abaddon still stood at the edge of the clearing still holding Jim’s broken and severed hand. However, he didn’t enter the clearing again just hovering at the edge of the treelined cloaked in the shadows. 



Jim was clutching at his stump, suddenly his hand landed in front of him, casually tossed by the demon of the abyss. Seeing his hand treating like a toy, broke something in Jim, he started to weep and ran again, in the opposite direction of Abaddon. But in another blink of the eyes, Abaddon caught him again holding him up by his hair and again threw him back into the clearing. Jim was now missing a massive chunk of scalp, exposing the white bone of his skull to the night air. Jim was hysterical, and ran again, only to again be tossed back, losing a chunk of flesh from his side. He lay still in the clearing, and started to say “thou father that art in heave” and screamed as a large black boot stuck his leg, with a sickening crack. “Now.. now.. No need to bring my dad into this” Abaddon said in the same airy tone. Abaddon bent down over Jim, and Jim screamed. The things it did to him. I won’t repeat it. Even passing out didn’t save him, every time he passed out, Abaddon spoke these strange words and he would immediately jolt awake another scream on his lips. He screamed, he begged, he prayed, but nothing stopped the demon. Abaddon only stopped when Jim could no longer scream anymore. 




Suddenly Abaddon vanished again, and I felt a cold sharp hand on my shoulder. “It’s your turn now, finish him, sacrifice him to me”, I slowly raised to my feet, my head was pounding, and I was still feeling nauseous from my beating. But I stumbled over to the lump of flesh that was left of Jim. He said nothing as I approach, he just stared blankly up at the sky. I kneeled over him and stuck the blade down, into his heart, which currently sat exposed to the night air, in his torn open chest cavity. 



Abaddon held out his hand, holding a small metal object, my phone “Call your Father”. I nearly screamed, I didn’t want this, “No, no, please, no more, I can’t do this”. Abaddon knelt next to me, those black pits staring into my soul, and he lightly said with a smile on his pale face “you offered me 3 and I will get 3, one way or another. Now choose”. “I need your help, I really do, but I can’t, I’m sorry” tears ran down my face, mixing into the blood-soaked ground. “What a shame”, Abaddon opened my phone, and dialed a number, he held the small phone up to his massive face and said in the exact copy of my own voice.  “DADDY, PLEASE HELP”, “Felix, calm down, what happened, where are you” “I’m, I’m at the clearing, the woods, where we, we, would play as kids. PLEASE HURRY” and he hung up the phone. Abaddon stared down at me gently patting my head, “Like I said, one way or another".
 



Abaddon stood up, craned his neck upwards and just stood there staring up at the sky in silence. Then an eternity later I heard loud footsteps heading this way. “FELIX, ARE YOU THERE”. “HELP” I screamed back. Suddenly a tall man walked into the clearing, wearing shorts, and a cotton tee-shirt, his pajamas. He rushed out here, without even taking the time to dress properly, all because I needed him. Guilt welled up in my chest, but it was far to late now. “GET AWAY FROM HIS YOU BASTARD”, Dad charged into the clearing, throwing himself towards Abaddon tackling into his tall form, still resting his hand on my head. But Abaddon didn’t budge instead my Dad fell down into the cold blood drenched mud.  He looked up finally getting a good look at the demon illuminated in the pale moonlight. He stared up into Abaddon’s void eyes and I could see he knew it; he stood no chance against this creature.



 So instead, he pleaded “Let him go, take me instead”. Abaddon laughed and mockingly said “Let him go, but why would I let him go, after all he called me her, and wished for his death, then yours”  He pointed down at the mangled form of Jim, Dad looked over at the still form of Jim “He was even the one that struck the final blow”.  Tears poured down his face, as he made eye contact with me “SON, don’t let grief dammed you to hell, it’s not too late. We might have died here, but please go back to God, go to the church, we might die but he can’t claim our So….” Abaddon grabbed him by the neck cutting off his voice. “Enough of your prattle, you’ll ruined my fun. Kill him”. But I just sat there, staring dumbly at Abaddon, my hands where shaking, my body shivering, but I couldn’t do it “Now don’t disappoint me, otherwise she will never open her eyes again, and her killer will never be found. You need to redeem yourself don’t you, its your fault after all”. 



His words stuck harder than Jim’s blows. He was right it was all my fault. Me and some friends vandalized the library on a dare. We got caught and Mom was called into the office. If I never did that stupid stunt, she would never have been on the road. She would still be here with me. 



“The only way to save her, and the only way to make it up to her, is me” 



Dad was now fighting hard trying to break free from Abaddon’s iron grip, but he only managed to hurt himself, drawing blood on the sharp metal plates. I slowly shakily stood up and stumbled towards dad body dangling from the tall figure. I raised up the knife and said through tears “I’m sorry, so sorry, but I need him”. Then suddenly his big hand grabbed me, wrenching the knife from my hand. And plunged it straight into his own neck.  Abaddon seemed disappointed and dropped his body into the dirt. It fell with a dull thud and said” Well that was disappointing, but either way you did well. Now for the contract, your soul, for everything you could ever want. Revenge, your mother, Wealth, Power”. I stared down at the prone still figure of my father, as his blood drained down into the dirt and whispered out “deal”. Everything went dark and I heard laughter in the distance. 



I awoke in my bedroom, the sigil from the woods cut into the back of my right hand, and in the palm of that hand, gripped a small piece of paper. I slowly opened the crumpled paper. Two lines where neatly written in flowing script. A name and a Californian address. I’m now sitting in my bedroom, typed this out, and I only wrote this, because I have this strange feeling, that if I do, it will make its way to you. To the person that struck a white VW polo 4 months ago in California, and didn’t stop, leaving that poor woman in the wrecked car. I want you to know that we know who you are and where you live and when we find you, there won’t be pieces left to bury.
