[Narrated Story](https://youtu.be/CciTcNb44Q0?si=7p9nmJ9cD0rnujWN&t=1235)

My name is James, i’m 23 and from Michigan. I went camping about 3 months ago with 3 of my closest friends: Travis, Ellie and Rachel. This was supposed to be a fun and relaxing time where we could disconnect from the world and just have fun as we used to. Let me get into the story, firstly I was picked up by Travis who already had Ellie in the truck, and Rachel was to be picked up after me.

The car ride to the forest was pretty and the company was good so the start of this trip was amazing.

Then we arrived, the forest was dense. Darker than I’d expected. As we trudged up the winding trail to our campsite, I felt like we were descending into another world, one where the sun barely reached the ground. Shadows gathered between the thick trunks, and the trees seemed to close in around us, branches reaching overhead to form a sort of canopy that blocked out the sky.

Ellie, walking ahead of me, looked back with a grin, her blonde hair catching what little light filtered through the leaves. “You okay back there, James? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

I forced a smile, gripping the straps of my pack tighter. “Just… taking it all in. This place is a lot wilder than I thought it’d be.”

She chuckled, turning back toward the trail. Travis and Rachel, further up, were talking and laughing, completely at ease. Travis, always the jokester, had brought some ridiculous straw hat and oversized hiking boots, adding to his usual over-the-top charm. Rachel, usually quiet, was actually smiling, enjoying his antics.

Maybe I was just tired, but something about this forest unsettled me. The silence was deep, almost oppressive. No birdsong, no wind rustling the branches—just the soft crunch of our footsteps and the occasional crack of a twig.

It took us about an hour to reach our campsite, a small clearing surrounded by towering pines. As soon as we dropped our gear, Travis was already busy setting up his tent, joking about his “luxury suite” with all the extras he’d packed. Ellie and Rachel were chatting, laughing as they tried to figure out their own tents. I tried to join in, but I kept feeling like someone was watching us, eyes lurking just beyond the edge of the trees.

The sun was beginning to set by the time we finished setting up. Travis built a fire, and we all gathered around it as the darkness crept in. The flames cast flickering shadows across our faces, making everything feel surreal. I didn’t want to admit it, but the shadows in this forest felt wrong, somehow too deep, too alive.

Ellie leaned in, her face illuminated by the glow. “All right, who’s got a scary story? It’s not camping without one!”

Travis immediately launched into an exaggerated tale about a monster in the woods, a story he’d probably heard as a kid. It was about an old trapper who’d gone missing years ago, only to come back as a “forest wraith,” haunting the woods and dragging people into the shadows. He added his own dramatic touches, making the creature sound hideous, with claws like knives and teeth as sharp as razors. Rachel laughed, throwing a pinecone at him.

“Oh, come on! You don’t actually expect us to be scared by that, do you?” she scoffed.

I laughed too, but it felt forced. Part of me wanted to tell them how I felt—the sense that we weren’t alone, that something was lurking just out of sight. But I didn’t want to sound paranoid, so I kept quiet, staring into the fire instead.

The forest around us grew darker as the night settled in, the trees looming like silent sentinels. Eventually, the others drifted off to their tents, their laughter fading as they zipped up and settled down for the night. I was left alone by the fire, the last of the embers casting faint, fading light.

I wanted to go to bed, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was out there, watching me. I stared into the trees, my heart pounding, every muscle tense. The silence was complete, save for the soft crackle of the dying fire.

Then, I saw it.

Just beyond the firelight, half-hidden by the trees, was a figure. At first, I thought it was one of the others, maybe Travis messing around. But as I squinted, I realized something was off. The figure was… wrong. Its limbs were too long, its posture too stiff, like it wasn’t used to moving like a human.

I froze, my breath catching in my throat. The figure didn’t move, didn’t make a sound—it just stood there, staring at me. Its eyes caught the firelight, reflecting back at me in two pinpoints of dark, glassy light.

I wanted to call out, to ask who it was, but the words died in my throat. I felt an overwhelming urge to look away, but I couldn’t. The figure seemed to be drawing me in, holding me captive with its gaze.

Then, just as quickly as it had appeared, it melted back into the shadows, disappearing into the darkness. My heart was pounding, my hands shaking. I wanted to believe I’d imagined it, that it was just a trick of the light or a shadow cast by the trees. But deep down, I knew I hadn’t.

I sat there for a long time, staring into the darkness, half-expecting the figure to reappear. But the forest remained silent, the shadows undisturbed. Finally, I forced myself to get up, to douse the fire and crawl into my tent.

Inside, I lay awake, listening to the silence, every rustle and creak setting my nerves on edge. I kept telling myself it was just my imagination, that I was letting Travis’s story get to me. But even as I closed my eyes, the image of that figure lingered, etched into my mind.

The last thing I remember before sleep finally claimed me was a feeling of eyes on me, watching from somewhere in the darkness, just beyond the thin fabric of my tent.

When I woke up, the sunlight filtering through the trees felt like a relief. The forest seemed less oppressive in the daylight, less… aware. I stepped outside my tent, blinking against the brightness, and found the others already up, sipping coffee and chatting like nothing had happened.

Ellie looked over at me, grinning. “Rough night? You look like you didn’t sleep at all.”

I forced a laugh, rubbing my eyes. “Just couldn’t get comfortable, I guess.”

I wanted to tell them about the figure, but as I looked around, it felt silly. In the daylight, the forest looked almost normal. Peaceful, even. Besides, I knew they’d just laugh it off as a shadow or a trick of my tired mind.

Travis handed me a cup of coffee, a grin on his face. “You need to relax, man. This is supposed to be a getaway, not some horror movie.”

I nodded, taking a sip of the coffee, hoping the warmth would shake off the remnants of my fear. But as I looked out into the trees, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was still out there, watching, waiting for nightfall to return.

I’d like to say that breakfast shook off the unease from last night, but the nagging feeling wouldn’t leave me. I kept glancing over my shoulder, scanning the trees as if expecting that figure to materialize in the daylight.

The others didn’t seem to notice, though. Travis was busy making everyone laugh with a ridiculous story about his last camping trip. Ellie kept glancing over at him, her laughter bright against the morning stillness, while Rachel, ever reserved, offered a quiet smile. I tried to focus on the warmth of the coffee in my hands, the crackling of the fire. But it was no use. I was still haunted by the figure, by those two pinpricks of light in the dark.

After breakfast, we decided to explore deeper into the woods, take a look at the stream Travis had spotted on the map. I was hesitant but didn’t want to be the one to kill the vibe, so I pushed down my misgivings and followed along.

The forest seemed even darker today, somehow. The trees loomed overhead like silent guards, their branches clawing at the sky. The silence felt heavy, like it was pressing down on us. I noticed that even the others were starting to seem a little quieter, their laughter and conversation fading as we walked deeper.

Eventually, we stumbled across something that made us all stop.

It was a pile of stones, stacked in a rough, haphazard cairn in the middle of the trail. The stones were smeared with a dark, sticky substance that looked… disturbingly like blood.

“What the hell is this?” Ellie whispered, her face pale.

Travis shrugged, his tone a little less cocky than usual. “Probably some kind of prank. You know, to freak out campers.”

I could tell he didn’t believe that. None of us did.

I knelt down to get a closer look, my stomach twisting. The smell coming off the stones was faint but unmistakable—metallic, like blood. I reached out to touch one of the stones, but a sudden instinct made me pull back. Something told me it would be a mistake to disturb it.

Rachel took a step back, looking around nervously. “Maybe we should head back to camp. This doesn’t feel… right.”

I nodded, relief flooding through me. But Travis shrugged, trying to shake off the tension. “Come on, guys. We’re not going to let some creepy rocks ruin our trip. Let’s just keep going.”

No one argued, but as we continued down the trail, the silence felt deeper, more ominous. I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were being watched, like something was lurking just beyond the trees, waiting for us to let our guard down.

We reached the stream, but the usual relief of finding a clear, open area didn’t come. The stream ran through a small clearing, bordered by mossy rocks and low-hanging branches. It was beautiful, I suppose, but something about the place felt… wrong. The air was damp, heavy, and it felt like the shadows under the trees were watching us.

Ellie knelt by the water, filling her bottle, and Rachel joined her. I stayed back, glancing around at the trees, unable to shake the sense that we weren’t alone. Travis noticed and nudged me with his elbow.

“Hey, you good? You’ve been jumpy all morning.”

I forced a smile, not wanting to seem paranoid. “Yeah, I’m fine. Just… something about this place, you know?”

He nodded, his expression uncharacteristically serious. “I get it, man. It’s a little weird out here. But we’re probably just spooking ourselves.”

Just as he finished speaking, Ellie let out a soft gasp. We turned to see her staring at something carved into the bark of a tree, a few feet from where she was kneeling.

It was a symbol—a strange, twisted shape that looked almost like an eye with a line slashed through it. The bark around it was dark, charred, as if someone had burned it into the tree.

“Who would do something like this out here?” Rachel whispered, a tremor in her voice.

Ellie reached out, tracing the mark with her finger. “It feels… recent.”

Something about the symbol made my skin crawl. I wanted to tell them about the figure I’d seen last night, but I wasn’t sure how. I knew it sounded crazy, and they’d probably just laugh it off or think I’d had too much to drink. So instead, I just stared at the symbol, feeling an odd sense of dread settle over me.

“Let’s go back,” I said, my voice barely a whisper. “I think we should go back.”

This time, no one argued.

We made it back to camp just as the sun was beginning to set. The whole walk back, I felt like something was trailing us, keeping just out of sight. Even Travis was quiet, his usual jokes and comments nowhere to be found.

We sat around the fire that night, but the atmosphere was tense. No one wanted to bring up what we’d seen, but it was hanging there between us, an unspoken weight pressing down on us.

Ellie broke the silence, her voice barely audible over the crackling flames. “Do you guys… do you feel like we’re being watched?”

I looked at her, surprised that she’d voiced exactly what I’d been thinking.

Rachel nodded, her eyes darting toward the trees. “I haven’t felt right since we saw that pile of rocks. It feels like… like something’s out there.”

Travis scoffed, but I could tell he was rattled too. “Come on, guys. It’s just a creepy forest. We’re probably just letting it get to us.”

But even as he spoke, his eyes kept drifting to the shadows, his hands twitching nervously.

The fire crackled, casting dancing shadows across the trees. I was staring into the flames, trying to calm myself, when I heard it—a low, guttural growl coming from somewhere beyond the firelight.

I froze, my heart pounding. The others heard it too; I could see their faces go pale, their eyes wide with fear.

“What… was that?” Ellie whispered, her voice shaking.

We sat in silence, straining to hear. The growling came again, closer this time, a deep, primal sound that sent a shiver down my spine.

Then, before we could react, something lunged into the edge of the firelight.

It was the figure from last night, but now I could see it more clearly. Its limbs were twisted and unnatural, its eyes hollow and unblinking. Its skin was a sickly, mottled gray, stretched tight over sharp bones. And its mouth… its mouth was open, revealing a set of jagged teeth that gleamed in the firelight.

Travis let out a strangled scream, grabbing a branch from the fire and brandishing it at the creature. But it didn’t back away. Instead, it took a step closer, its eyes locked onto us, unblinking.

In the next instant, it lunged, swiping at Travis with one of its long, bony hands. He stumbled back, clutching his arm, blood seeping through his fingers.

“Get back!” I shouted, grabbing a burning log from the fire and swinging it at the creature. The flames seemed to startle it, and it retreated, melting back into the shadows.

We sat there, panting, our hearts racing. Travis was pale, clutching his bleeding arm, his face twisted with pain and fear.

Ellie knelt beside him, trying to stem the bleeding with a piece of cloth. “Oh my God… what was that?”

I didn’t have an answer. All I knew was that the thing I’d seen last night was real, and it wasn’t just watching us anymore. It was hunting us.

We sat in silence, too afraid to speak, too afraid to move. The fire crackled, casting flickering shadows that seemed to dance and twist, mocking us. The forest around us was silent again, but I knew the creature was still out there, lurking just beyond the light, waiting for its next chance.

As I glanced at Travis’s wound, a horrible thought crept into my mind: whatever that creature was, it had marked him. And I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were all next.

I barely slept after the attack. Travis’s wound throbbed and bled well into the night, and though Ellie tried to keep it clean, it only seemed to worsen. I could hear him muttering in his sleep, his voice feverish, like he was caught in a nightmare he couldn’t escape.

When dawn finally broke, it felt like a reprieve, a fragile shield against whatever stalked us in the darkness. But even the daylight seemed weaker, as if the forest itself was rejecting the sun. Shadows stretched long and dark between the trees, and the usual chirping of birds and rustling of animals was eerily absent.

Ellie, Rachel, and I gathered around Travis, checking on him as he drifted in and out of sleep. The cut on his arm looked… wrong. The skin around it was swollen, angry red, as if it were infected, but something about it seemed unnatural, almost as though it were spreading under the skin.

Ellie’s face was pale, her eyes wide with fear. “We need to get him out of here,” she said, her voice trembling. “This isn’t just an infection. There’s something… wrong with him.”

I nodded, but a sick feeling settled in my stomach. I knew, deep down, that leaving wouldn’t be as easy as just packing up and hiking out. I could feel it, pressing in from all sides—the forest didn’t want us to leave. It was like we’d stumbled into something ancient, something that didn’t take kindly to intruders.

But we had to try. We packed up as quickly as we could, supporting Travis as we made our way down the trail. Every step felt like a struggle, like the trees were closing in around us, trying to trap us. Travis was barely conscious, his skin cold and clammy. His breathing was shallow, his eyes glassy.

By midday, we reached the pile of stones from yesterday. But something was different. The stones were scattered, lying haphazardly on the ground. And in the center of the disturbed pile was something that made my blood run cold—a single, bloody claw mark, scratched into the dirt.

Rachel gasped, her hand flying to her mouth. “It’s… it’s following us.”

Ellie gripped my arm, her face as pale as I’d ever seen it. “James… what is this? What are we dealing with?”

I shook my head, my voice hollow. “I don’t know. But whatever it is, it’s not going to let us leave.”

We kept moving, but the tension was suffocating. Every rustle, every snap of a twig set our nerves on edge. The forest felt alive, malevolent, like it was watching us, waiting for the right moment to strike. And with every step, I could feel the creature getting closer, stalking us, driving us deeper into its territory.

By the time night fell, we were too exhausted to continue. Travis was barely conscious, and even I could feel the weight of exhaustion bearing down on me. We decided to set up camp one last time, hoping that somehow, we’d make it through the night.

We built the fire bigger than usual, the flames casting a protective ring of light around us. Travis was lying by the fire, his breathing shallow, his face pale and drawn. Ellie and Rachel sat beside him, keeping watch, their eyes darting nervously into the darkness.

I stood on the edge of the firelight, scanning the trees, every muscle in my body tense. I knew it was out there, watching us. I could feel its presence, lurking just beyond the reach of the flames, waiting for the moment when our defenses were down.

Then, without warning, the silence shattered.

A low, guttural growl echoed through the trees, vibrating through the ground beneath us. The sound was deep, primal, sending a shiver down my spine. I turned, my heart pounding, and saw a pair of glowing eyes staring at us from the darkness.

“It’s here,” I whispered, my voice barely audible over the crackling flames.

The others looked up, their faces pale with terror. The creature stepped into the edge of the firelight, its twisted form even more grotesque than before. Its limbs were long and skeletal, its skin stretched tight over sharp bones. And its face… its face was a nightmare, a twisted mockery of a human face, with hollow eyes and a mouth that stretched too wide, filled with jagged, gleaming teeth.

It let out a low, rumbling growl, and I felt a wave of cold wash over me. The creature was watching us, sizing us up, as if deciding which one of us to take first.

Travis let out a weak, delirious laugh, his eyes glassy with fever. “You… you’re all seeing it too, right?” he murmured, his voice slurred. “It’s not just… not just me?”

Ellie gripped his hand, her face filled with terror. “Stay with us, Travis. Just stay with us.”

But I could see the life draining from his eyes, his skin growing paler, his breaths slower. The creature took another step forward, its gaze fixed on him, almost… hungry.

“Stay back!” I shouted, grabbing a burning branch from the fire and waving it at the creature. But it didn’t flinch, didn’t even blink. Instead, it tilted its head, as if amused, and let out a low, rumbling laugh that sounded more like a growl.

Rachel clutched my arm, her voice shaking. “James, what do we do?”

I didn’t have an answer. The creature was too close, too real. I could feel the weight of its presence, the malice radiating from it like a physical force.

Then, without warning, it lunged.

It moved with inhuman speed, its twisted limbs propelling it forward in a blur. I swung the branch, but it dodged easily, its hollow eyes fixed on Travis. Ellie screamed, clutching him, but the creature reached out, its claws slicing through the air, and raked them across his chest.

Blood sprayed, and Travis let out a choked gasp, his eyes wide with pain. But in the next instant, something incredible happened.

The fire flared, as if in response to the creature’s attack. The flames roared higher, casting an intense light that drove the creature back, its twisted face contorted in anger. It let out a snarl, retreating into the shadows, its eyes blazing with fury.

For a moment, there was silence, broken only by Travis’s ragged breathing. Ellie clutched him, tears streaming down her face, and Rachel collapsed beside them, sobbing.

I stood there, gripping the branch, staring into the darkness where the creature had vanished. I knew it wasn’t gone. It was still out there, lurking in the shadows, waiting for its next opportunity.

But as I looked down at Travis, I realized that he was beyond saving. His skin was cold, his breathing shallow. Whatever the creature had done to him, it had marked him, drained him of life, leaving him a hollow shell.

Ellie looked up at me, her face streaked with tears. “We have to leave. Now.”

I nodded, feeling the weight of exhaustion bearing down on me. We gathered what little we had left, supporting Travis as best we could, and stumbled out of the campsite, into the darkness.

We didn’t stop, didn’t look back. The forest was alive with shadows, the trees closing in around us, but we pushed forward, driven by sheer terror. Travis’s breathing grew weaker with every step, and I knew he wouldn’t make it, but we couldn’t stop. The creature was still out there, trailing us, waiting for the moment we faltered.

By the time we finally broke through the trees and reached the edge of the forest, the first light of dawn was creeping over the horizon. The creature hadn’t followed us into the open. It was as if it were bound to the forest, unable to leave.

We collapsed on the edge of the road, gasping for breath, our bodies exhausted, our minds numb with terror. Travis was barely conscious, his skin pale and cold, his eyes unfocused. Ellie held him, her face wet with tears, but there was nothing we could do.

As the sun rose, I looked back at the forest, at the dark line of trees looming against the light. I could feel its presence still, lurking just beyond the edge, watching us, waiting. The creature was still out there, bound to the shadows, a nightmare that would haunt my mind forever.

And as we sat there, broken and exhausted, I realized that the forest had claimed us. We might have escaped, but a part of us would always remain, forever bound to the darkness, to the creature that had marked us as its own.
