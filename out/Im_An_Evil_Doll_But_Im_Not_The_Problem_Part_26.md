“He definitely took off on us. It’s been days.”, Leo says. 

On the horizon we can see the faintest hint of a skyline. Something other than gravel and patches of horror. 

“If I had a wallet I’d bet you ten bucks he comes back.”, I reply. 

Leo carries me. Over the past few days things have gotten pretty grim on my end. I’m falling apart like a flea market switchblade. Three of the metal fronds of my skullplate lay somewhere behind us, Leo carries two of my fingers in a pocket.

“Anyone have any thoughts on what the hell that earthquake was  yesterday? Or why the clouds shot up a half kilometer?”, Sveta asks, passing the time. 

“No clue, but it has to have something to do with how The Lost are acting.”, Leo answers. 

“Something changed.”, Alex adds. 

After a few hours of slow marching,  we notice something. A series of rocks, large enough to be noticed at a distance. 

“Is that an arrow?”, Sveta asks. 

“No, but it’s definitely pointing at something.”, Leo says, snickering and shaking his head. 

“You owe me ten bucks when we get out of this. Tell me that isn’t Mike’s work.”, I inform Leo. 


The crudely made phallic marker leads us up a large gravel dune. Sure enough, there sits Mike and Demi. 

 Their backs are turned to us, casually Mike tosses my phone toward me. It bounces off my chest, but Leo manages to catch it. He puts me down, and I steady myself on my makeshift crutch. 

“You two are just, hanging out now? What happened to ‘Shoot him’?”, Leo says, suspiciously. 

“We like the same kind of hat, I can’t just let that kind of connection go.” Mike replies. 

The two unlikely companions get up and face us. 

Demi looks about like I’d expect, after seeing him take over Mike’s body. 

Mike on the other hand. 

“What happened?”, Alex says, alarmed. 

“Bit of a scuffle young lady, nothing to be worried about.”, Demi replies. 

Demi’s understatement borders on the paranormal. 

Pieces of Mike’s face are missing, looks like frostbite. His hair has been ripped out in clumps, leaving the rest frayed and wild. Patches of skin are off-color, and the man has clearly been through the wringer, then tossed into a meat grinder. 

“What about you Wee-man? You’re looking a bit rough.”, Mike asks. 

“Not sure, Leo thinks this place doesn’t work well with mechanical things. Explains The Lost’s cars, why all their guns are half broken. “, I reply. 

“Has anyone seen the Bishop?” Demi asks, like he’s one of the gang. 

Leo looks at him suspiciously. 

“Not yet. Things around here are getting a little strange though. You two wouldn’t happen to know anything about that, would you?” Leo interrogates.

“Oh yeah, in between getting tortured I got myself some earthquake powers. 

Fuck off with your suspicion. 

I went looking for some payback against Demi. I got captured because my mind had me thinking I was scarier than I was, and he saved my ass. 

After that, he clarified a few things. 

I get it, seems strange, but you have to remember, a lot of the time I’m not thinking straight. Take any of my opinions with a huge grain of salt.”, Mike says, dismissively. 

Leo seems to believe him. I’m not so sure. 

“Seems likely that The Bishop has made it to the city by now. Regardless of your feelings on my history, you lot need the help. 

On my honor as a gentleman, no sanguinary proclivities. At least for the foreseeable future.”, Demi offers. 

A dry wind blows and silence turns into an unspoken agreement as we walk toward the city. 



“Didn’t think that was supposed to happen.” Sveta says, pointing out a herd of skeletal, cat-like things prowling out from a patch of flora that resembles nothing more than a massive pile of twisted vines. 

“Don’t look at me. 

I may have made a mark on history, but this path was something I wanted no part of. 

Being an occultist is one thing, the void is a tool. But trying to become a part of it, even in this minor way. Hubris incarnate. 

That being said, I do share your sentiment.”, Demi replies. 

A few more miles and things get stranger. 

Roving packs and hordes of creatures never destined for anything other than half-existence collide. Their conflict makes our path winding and slow. 

Some of the patches of plant-life we pass are unhealthy and wilting. Others seem to be flourishing beyond their borders. 

“Things are changing, from refuge to ecosystem.”, Demi comments. 

“You sound impressed.”, I accuse.  

“Intrigued is the proper term. I’ve been a man of science since the concept started.”, Demi replies. 

We pass many more corpses now. Both people, and the things that call this place home. The havoc around us is taking a brutal toll. 

We see the lost trying to ferry travelers away from the worst of things. Or in some cases, trying to wrangle rampant supernatural abominations away from each other. Their strange, slow cars pushing themselves to their limit. 

“Bad things about five miles ahead. We’re going to lose a lot of time going around it though.”, Sveta warns. 

“I’m running low on ammo, and I don’t know what will hurt any of the wildlife.”, Leo adds grimly. 

“Cross that bridge when we come to it I guess.”, I reply. 

From the east one of The Lost’s vehicles comes toward us. It’s sluggish, and pulling to the left, leaking a dark, red fluid. 

“I don’t know what to make of these guys.”, Sveta says. 

The car skids to a stop. 

“Let’s hear them out. I wouldn’t be against having some people that could help us quicken our pace.”, Leo suggests. 

A skinny, sunburnt man pushing fifty stumbles out of the strange car. His nose is wrapped in bandages, like something has torn it off. He, like all of the lost wears a strange attempt at a police uniform. Stitched and cobbled from a dozen different sources. 

“How can we help?” Leo says, Neutrally. 

The man catches his breath. 

“I’m Silvio. We need some able-bodied folks and we need them fucking yesterday. 

We don’t care why you’re here, what you’ve done. If we don’t get this under control, this place will be nothing more than chaos and death.”, the Lost says grimly. 

“We’re in a bit of a rush, but we could lend a hand if you’ll return the favor. 

Pick the worst mess out there, we’ll clean it up, then you and yours get us to the city.”, Leo offers. 

“We could save you a days travel.” Silvio ponders out loud, “You help us wrangle two packs of our choosing, we’ll escort you to the city. Rations and water to boot.”

The deal sounds good to me. Being pointed in a direction and cleaning house has kind of became our thing. I can tell by the look on Sveta and Alex faces that they’re feeling the same. 

“Throw in a little ammo and you have yourself a deal.

Your men have any idea what’s causing this?” Leo says, attempting to close the negotiation. 

“All but confirmed some fucking idiot…”, Silvio begins. 

“Ask him how those jalopies get around.”, Mike interrupts. His tone is caustic. He plays with a large hunting knife.

The group goes quiet. A steady dripping can be heard from the Lost’s car. 

Leo turns to Mike. 

“Mike, you’re having a moment.”, Leo says, calmly. Almost like an older brother.

“No, I’m not. But thanks for the concern. 

I just thought you’d want to know about the people you’re getting into bed with. 

What’s under the hood Sil?”, Mike questions. 

“An engine. Things tend to fall apart around here, so it’s made to be replaced easily.”, Silvio answers, “Do we have a deal?”

Pregnant silence. 

“Let’s see inside. My friend gets a little strange when something gets under his skin. I’m sure it’s nothing.” Leo says, diplomatically. 

Silvio looks stern. 

“I’m not taking apart my ride for some weirdo. What next, want me to strip down? Maybe do a cavity search?

Your friend’s a nutcase. We got a deal, or no?”, Silvio asks. 

I see the wheels turning in Leo’s eyes. 

Before he can make a decision, Mike flings the hunting knife. It spins end over end, burying itself in the side of The Lost’s car. 

There’s a muffled but unmistakeable grunt of pain. 

 Leo beings to walk forward, Sil steps in front of him. 

Without a word, Leo strikes him in the face, one knuckle extended slightly. Silvio drops to the ground, damaged nose pouring blood. 

Leo pauses before he lifts the jury-rigged hood. His face is a sudden mask of horror, rage and shock. 

“That’s one way of doing things.”, Demi says appreciatively. 

“You’re a monster.”, Sveta accuses. 

It takes me a minute to get a decent angle, but when I see what’s inside, it scares the hell out of me. 

We’ve done some dark things. I’ll admit that. I don’t want to justify them, but if I were to try and make our case, our hand has been forced. What was under that hood though. It was the child of ingenuity and evil. 

Four people, two at the front and ( presumably.) two at the back. Hacked, hobbled, and mutilated. They’re bound into cramped nooks, eyes gone, mouths sown shut. Their handless arms cuffed to rusting gears. Any bit of their body that wasn’t necessary to power the crude machinery clipped or sliced away. 

“Get the fuck out.”, Leo snarls. Turning on Silvio. 

The wounded man scrambles to his feet as he speaks, blood still streaming down his face. 

“That thing under the sand, it gets in people’s heads. It twists them, makes it so they have no other purpose than to get it victims. 

They worm their way into groups, each and every one of them is a killer. 

We use them to bring some kind of order to this place.”, Silvio stammers. 

Leo has Mike’s knife, he gestures with it as he talks. 

“Then put a bullet in their fucking head and walk. 

I’m not looking to start a war, but you, personally, have ten seconds to get out of sight.”, Leo demands. 

The force coming from those words has the presence of a brick wall. A nearly physical wave of authority radiates from Leo. 

Sil does the smart thing, his tortured conveyance moving unsteadily toward the horizon.

Our journey slows to a crawl. With every passing minute, every corpse strewn mile, more and more of this place becomes too dangerous to traverse. 

We make camp, tension begins to brew. Something about what Mike pointed out about the lost isn't sitting right with Leo. 

But we're past the point of being a squabbling bunch of strangers. The six of us are closer to family at this point. 

"We'll be coming up on the worst of it tomorrow. We need to talk about how we are going to get through things.

I say our heavy hitters are Demi and Sveta. I'd include myself in there, but low ammo and no info aren't really situations I thrive in.", Leo says over the dull glow of a small fire. 

"In better days, I’d agree with that assessment. But as things stand, I nearly died from a mere three gunshot wounds. Traipsing through a warzone is a bit beyond me right now.", Demi admits. 

"Far from ideal, but not much out there that’s going to want to mess with a werewolf.", Leo says hopefully. 

"Not going to be an option. Something about this place, I don't feel connected to that part of me.", Sveta says. 

It's a bald-faced lie from someone that isn't used to being dishonest with people they care about. 

"Just yesterday you were smelling things miles off. Hell, you've pretty much been the one guiding us since we've got here.", I say without thinking. 

Sveta looks frustrated. 

"My body is not a weapon.", Sveta begins "Changing has consequences...."

There's a look of understanding on Leo's face. 

"Okay. Jesus though, not leaving us with a lot of options. Mike, Demi,  we'll have to take point as a group then."

 "How bad is bad Sveta?", Mike asks. Clearly afraid of the answer. 

"I can't count, but it's not just a herd or a pack. It's a wave of blood and shit, and other bodily reeks I can't even quantify.

I think Demi pretty much nailed it with the warzone comment.", Sveta replies. 

I notice Alex listening. She seems like she wants to say something, but hesitates. 

"Okay, I can't say I've done more with less, but give me a little rack-time and I'll figure out our best chance getting through this.", Leo says. 

As always, I get watch. It makes me feel useful, especially given my state lately. I may not be able to do jack-shit to help get us through this horde, but if anything creeps up in the night I can still make one hell of a racket. 

As the night goes on, I notice I’m not the only one up. 

"You're not holding back anything that could help us, are you?", I ask Mike, at the edge of our camp. 

"Amazing how long a cell battery can last, isn't it?", he replies. 

"I'll take that as a no.", I type with rapidly numbing fingers. 

"What about you?", Mike asks. 

My laugh startles him. It's a terrible noise, but he understands. 

"We're all just lying to each other, constantly  aren't we?", I inquire. 

"No. I’ve got a theory. I mean, I've got a lot of theories, being a lunatic and all. But this one, maybe makes a little sense. 

We don't lie, we have secrets. And secrets can be powerful. 

The scary shit that sets all of this into motion, it's always watching. It's up our ass in a hundred different ways. 

Who knows if they can see into the future, or the past? Maybe they know every fear we have. Every weakness. 

But here's the thing about us, we don't know what we are capable of, as a group. It's a scary thought, we could be the worst group of assholes to wander into the abyss. Unprepared and one bad sneeze away from death. 

Or not. 

But it's that uncertainty that saves our ass, I think. That potential.", Mike rambles. 

"Sounds a little crazy, but then again, under most circumstances talking to a doll would be a sign of mental illness.", I reply. 

"Wouldn't that be a kick in the teeth? I'm really just wandering through New Mexico or somewhere getting into fights with livestock and killing folks out in the boonies.", Mike adds. 

After a while Mike does manage to get some sleep. Leaving me to think about the implications of what he said.

I wake up the next morning with something jagged stabbing into my junk. I try to move, the blistering gravel burns my palms. 

"Wait a second...", I say in a clear voice. 

Before I can open my eyes, I hear the hammer of a pistol set, then Leo's voice. 

"Say something that's going to make me stop thinking I'm looking at the person who killed my friend."

"I'm really glad I don't sound like a rampaging colon anymore?

What are you looking for Leo? This sand is about a minute away from peeling my skin back.", I reply. 

I hear the hammer release. 

To say I'm shocked is an understatement. I've been a doll for so long, and have so little memory of who I was, having a body again never crossed my mind. 

But as I stand, I see the same dark skinned hands from the vision in Alex's house.

I realise two things at the same time. 

The more mundane of the two is that I'm naked. One hand instinctively covers that same part the remnants of my skull were jabbing into. 

The more interesting one is that I'm tattooed, from shoulder to hip, front and back. 

It's a flowing, feminine script. Despite this, it's just shy of impossible for me to read. 

"I got it.", Mike says, walking over, "Always wanted to be a narrator:

Foresight is as much of a curse as it is a gift. No matter how prized it may be. 

Nothing gets a clear vision of the future. Nothing can. It's a tangled mess of possibilities and chaos. 

But you chose to brave that with me. 

I don't know who you will find yourself surrounded by, but if we've done our job right, they will be the right people. Those that can stare into the abyss, and not worry when it stares back. 

There is more to you, and to your story that I can explain like this. But understand, you and yours will play a role in fates greater than your own. Greater than what is in front of you.

You are more than a doll, you were one of the bravest men I’ve known."

We all stand in silence for a moment.

Leo starts to laugh. Making eye contact with Sveta. 

"It explains so much.", Leo says. 

"Feel like letting me in on the secret?", I ask. 

"You can get the Cliff's notes. We don't have time for much more. 

Go back far enough, and folks had a more direct relationship with the supernatural. People like myself kept the peace, and people like you made the peace. 

You were our diplomats, politicians, negotiators, merchants. We were only the soldiers. 

You've got a spark inside you that makes the things that go bump in the night like the cut of your jib. You speak their language, you get their respect. 

It's probably why all of us have been getting along.", Leo explains. 

"I think I've read about people like this.", Alex says, "A post online,  *Monster and Pasta* I think it was called?" 

"Can I do any of that magic I've seen you pull off?", I ask, desperately trying to think of something to improvise as clothing. 

"No, what you've been given is powerful, but a lot more subtle. Not overly many of you left. Not much need for diplomacy nowadays.", Leo replies. 


"You'll let us get through the city a lot easier.", Sveta says. 

"Not that it helps with our more pressing concern.

Cover your shame lad, I know it's been a while since you've had genitals, but they're best displayed sparingly.", Demi says handing me his trenchcoat. 

It's long enough it drags like a gown, but it does the trick. 

"Let me help.", Alex says. 

Something about her tone makes me tense up. 

"Kid, you just take care of yourself, I trust you to make sure nothing drags you off.

So Demi...", Leo says. 

He's interrupted by the sound of a slide being drawn. 

It takes Alex a few tries, but eventually she manages to get a round in the chamber of the small, stolen pistol. 

"I'm not a kid. Not anymore. 

I see things you can't, I hear things you can't, I know things you can't!

You were asleep for less than ten minutes when I took this from you.", Alex sounds shaken, a bit unhinged. 

Leo looks surprised, while I get to experience something I haven't in a long time. 

We've talked about how I can be afraid, what does and doesn't effect what was left of my brain. But now, in this strange way, being flesh and blood again, I’m firing on all cylinders when it comes to being scared shitless. 

Fear paralyses me, an overwhelming sense of vulnerability washes over me like ice water. I'm scared for Alex, for myself if she misfires, for our mission. I can't think of a damn thing to say or do. 

"He didn't mean anything by that Alex. We know you can handle yourself. We just don't want you getting hurt.", Sveta says trying to soothe Alex. 

Alex growls, a look of concentration on her face as she tries to fight her fractured mind. 

"You don't get it. 

Don't you notice it? 

All of you have changed here. Punch and Mike, they were obvious. But you and Leo have too. 

I haven't though. 

This is who I am, this is what I am.", Alex says. 

She begins to sob. 

"Kid… Alex, there's a million ways to fix things once we get back home and things are settled down.", Leo says without much conviction. 

Alex's twisted face is wet with tears, with a shuddering breath they stop. 

Mike understands what's going to happen next. He's sprinting toward Alex, screaming at her to stop. She wasn't trying to make us listen with the pistol.

Mike is too slow. Alex puts the pistol under her chin, firing. 

The shot rings out through the unnatural landscape. Followed shortly by our screams. 

A flat piece of brass, nearly perfectly round hits the ground, it's polished surface ringing. 

Alex fires the holdout pistol dry, warped slugs hitting the ground like lost change. 

She's fine. Not that my jackhammering heart has gotten the memo. 

The seventh member of our crew seems to be silence. It makes it's opinion known. 

"I can't think of many things that could endure that at your age.", Sveta says apologetically. 

"Yeah, I don't like it, but I think you've made your point, kid.", Leo adds. 

A smile grows on Alex's face. 



An hour later we’re on the march.

It doesn't take me long to find some clothing that makes me feel less like I should be on a registry. Corpses dot the landscape like road signs. 

I feel underdressed in a cheap black dress shirt and faded jeans. But that’s just one of the hundreds of new thoughts and sensations running through me. 

I don't have the words to describe the sheer amount of life we saw in front of us. 

The moment it breached the horizon, we understood what we were walking into. 

Another fight? I wish. What we were walking into wasn't a conflict, it was an event. A natural disaster. A storm of flesh and rage that was greater than the sum of it's parts. 

We could no more fight it than a tornado. It's something we would have to endure. 

"We're going to want to get through this as peacefully as possible. God-damn, I can't even see the end of it. 

Alex, you need to clear the path. There's things there that could kill any of us with a misstep. Focus on those. 

Demi and I will try and keep you from getting overwhelmed, but who knows what we can and can't hurt? 

Mike, you stick close to punch, we're going to need him in the city. 

Sveta, if you have any change of heart, let me know.", Leo says as we get close enough to the throng of flesh and claws Sveta isn't the only one smelling it.

Groups of the lost fight in vain to break up the catastrophe. Others simply for survival. Wounded prey and confused predators clash, digging furrows into the ground around them. 

The earth begins to shake beneath our feet. The sheer mass of the things in front of us making the ground tremble. 

Or at least, that's what we thought it was at first. 

Sinkholes start to appear around us, small things, no bigger around than a water glass. They begin to widen, gravel spilling into them. 

No way around, no way back, the mind bending carnage in front of us is our only choice. 

Call it a cliffhanger if you want to, but this is where I’m going to have to leave things. I could spend another twenty pages describing the various shapes and forms of entity in front of us, but you'd still never understand the amount of "We're fucked" that I’m looking at. 

The chances me, or this phone making it out of this in one piece are slim to nil. So I thought I’d get you as far as I did. 

A 'Next Time' would be a blessing, but in case there isn’t one.

Watch where you wander, or you might end up here. 

Punch
