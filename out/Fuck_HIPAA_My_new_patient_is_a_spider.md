In the summer of 2018, officers from several local law enforcement agencies attended a SWAT training exercise at the shuttered East Hills Mall in Bakersfield, California.

Approximately two hours into the training, two of the officers vanished. They responded to nothing, not even to radio calls.

The remaining participants searched the mall, assuming it was part of the exercise.

Three full sweeps later, the missing officers remained unaccounted for.

In the middle of the fourth sweep, their voices came crackling back on the radio. 

They were screaming for help. When asked to provide their location, they only said:

“She took us under the toy store.”

The only toy store in the mall was in the very back, a small, narrow shop that had once been called World of Toys. As the officers converged on the shop, the lights inside flickered on.

The two officers stumbled out, limping and bleeding.

A moment later, a young woman followed. Upon seeing her, both officers became hysterical.

The woman complied with orders when officers told her to drop her weapons and raise her hands.

Neatly arranged in the center of each palm were three small eyes.

The woman was arrested. Per the incident report, she expressed pain when one of the officers pressed too hard on her hands. 

She introduced herself as Nicole. When asked what she had done to the officers, she answered that she was just doing her job. When asked to clarify, she said, “They were web rippers. We kill web rippers and use them to repair the web. But I knew I wouldn’t kill them today.” She shifted her hands meaningfully. “I saw that through my hands. It’s why I let you catch me.”

She refused to elaborate further.

Four days after being booked into the county central receiving facility, she posted bail. Shortly after her release, representatives from AHH-NASCU apprehended her.

This inmate is a very special case.

Like many T-Class agents, Nicole P. often fails to display cooperation with Agency directives. However, she is the only inmate in the facility with precognitive abilities. The value of the instances of her cooperation currently outweigh the instances of noncooperation, particularly in light of the fact that she has frequently and repeatedly expressed fear and disgust of the Harlequin.

Nicole P. presents as an woman approximately 30-35, with blonde hair, green eyes, and an athletic build. She suffers major depressive disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and oppositional defiant disorder. However, she is generally pleasant and has repeatedly expressed willingness to work with both Dr. Wingaryde and T-Class Agent Christophe W. 

The assistant interviewer would like to note that immediately prior to the interview, she said the only reason she agreed to talk was due to the presence of Christophe W. 

It should also be noted that prior to this interview, no one at the Agency was aware of any link between this inmate and Inmate 23. For many reasons, this link is of immense concern to Administration. Further investigation is required.

Whatever else he might have been, Marley was the love of my life.

No one understood. From the minute we latched on to each other, people kept asking me, *Why?*

I always said things like, *Because I like him* or *We’re in love.* 

Those were lies, though. And lying gets old.

So when my friend Breanna asked, *Seriously, what do you see in him?* I told her, “It’s not so much what I see in him, as much as he sees everything in me.”

She rolled her eyes and went, *Let’s try again. Why do you love him?*

I was obsessed with theater back then, so I threw a Christopher Marlowe quote at her:

“*Why do you love him who the world hates so? Because he loves me more than all the world.”*

That quote was particularly appropriate because Marley’s full name is Marlowe, just like the playwright. 

“That’s why, Breanna,” I told her. “Because he loves me more than anything or anyone.”

There’s a lesson there for you. Did you know that? Probably not. I only know because I’ve seen it. But it’s a lesson you can only learn on your own. Remember it when the time comes, because trust me: 

The time is coming. 

But I’m not talking about Marley. You don’t want to hear about him anyway. You don’t want to hear the love of my life. You want to hear about my best friend. 

And no wonder.

Growing up, my best friend was a serial killer.

His name was Sorry, and I met him at the mall after my mom died.

The day of her funeral, my dad — who abandoned us the week she got her diagnosis — threw a tantrum when I wouldn’t hug him. He said, “I can’t stand the way you look at me, Nicky. It’s like there’s nothing inside you. Looking at you is like looking at a crocodile, or a shark, or a goddamned spider.”

My mom never said anything like that to me. Ever.

Her death was as far from sudden as Saturn is from the sun. But even though I knew she was dying, even though I understood on an intellectual level that her illness would eventually kill her, the key word was *eventually*. In my heart of hearts, I thought she would find a way to be there – to be with me— until I didn’t need her anymore. 

When she died, my heart became a hole the exact shape and size of her, a hole that only heightened the primal, panicked loneliness that is the purview of the newly motherless.

I missed her so much. I still do. Every minute, every day.

Before she died, our favorite place was the East Hills Mall. She took me there every Sunday to window shop, eat lunch, and watch a matinee.

So even though it felt empty without her, I clung to the mall after she died. Every Sunday afternoon, I spritzed myself with her perfume and made my dad drive me to the mall, where I window shopped and  ate at the food court and took myself to see a movie.

I cried every time, as silent and still as the spiders my father had compared me to. No one would even know I was weeping unless they looked right at me, no one ever looked at me. No one ever saw me except my mom, and she was gone.

I usually quit crying by the time the credits rolled.

That changed on an unseasonably oppressive afternoon in May.

That day, the tears just wouldn’t stop. I curled up in the seat and covered my face while the lights went on and everyone else trickled out of the theater. 

Only when the theater was empty did I exit into the lobby, hiccuping and puffy-faced, where I waited for my father to come pick me up.

Minutes stretched into an hour, two, three. Syrupy sunlight poured through the skylights stinging my swollen, sweating face. Finally, fresh tears pricked my eyes.

He wasn’t coming.

I was so unimportant, so completely forgettable, that my own father couldn’t bother to remember me. 

I spun around and marched away, wiping tears and terror away in equal measure. Fine.

*Fine.*

Let him forget. I’d stay at the mall all night, basking in the echoes and the heat and the memory of my mother’s perfume. It was a hell of a lot better than my dad’s house, where I had to listen to him stomp around while his girlfriend soothe their new baby every minute of every day.

I marched all the way to the end of the mall, trying and failing to absorb the ambiance – the activity, the excitement, the *being*, just like I’d used to\*.\* But it was impossible. The mall was like a happy hive that I couldn’t join even though I was right there inside of it. People parted around me, but didn’t spare me a glance. It felt like I was the wrong end of a magnet pushing all the other magnets away.

But that was the story of my life, wasn’t it? No brothers or sisters, no cousins, no friends from school or church. Something about me *repelled*. The only people who ever came close to my heart were my mother and my grandpa who lived in New York City, which might as well have been the moon for all the good it did me.

It had always been that why. And the reason wasn’t up for debate, nor was it a mystery. My own father had unwittingly admitted exactly what he, and probably everyone else, thought of me the night after my mother’s funeral.

I was a crocodile. A shark.

A goddamned spider. 

I wiped my eyes again. *It’s okay*, I told myself. *Spiders are useful. At least they kill flies. Dad doesn’t even do that.*

I reached the end of the mall, and found myself faced with three choices: a department store, a cookie shop, and World of Toys.

The toy store was my favorite store of all time. My mom and I used to spend hours there together. It was bursting with children now. I ached to be among them, to smile and be smiled at, to play, to make friends, to escape my own pain for just a little while. But I knew it wouldn’t happen. They’d just ignore me if I was lucky, and taunt me if I wasn’t.

I sat on a bench and stared down at the polished floor. It was so shiny I saw my own dim reflection. I wished it was a better, brighter reflection because I wanted to look deep into my own eyes. I wanted to see whether they were the eyes of a girl, or the eyes of a spider.

Someone sat beside me, breaking the reverie. Instinctively I stood up to leave, but the newcomer touched my arm. I looked down, startled; no one had touched me in weeks, not since my grandpa hugged me at the funeral.

The hand that was touching me now was pale and long-fingered, with prominent knuckles and bruised-looking nails.

Feeling hypnotized, I tracked hand to wrist, wrist to arm, arm to shoulder, up a long neck to a face covered in a hospital mask. Above the rim of the mask were two bright green eyes full of concern. Profoundly gentle eyes, eyes that *saw* me.

“Are you all right?” he asked.

Just like that, my shields came down. I was disarmed. The voice was everything I needed in that moment – gentle, soft, caring. 

*I’m fine*, I almost said. But why lie? I was sick of lying. I lied to my father and his girlfriend, to my teachers and classmates, to everyone I came across every day of the week. I lied because they expected me to. So why lie to someone who wanted the truth?

“Nothing is okay,” I answered. “My mom died last month, and my dad was supposed to pick me up three hours ago but he forgot, and now I want to cry but I don’t want everyone to see.”

“I don’t like people to see me cry, either.” Purple shadows spread under the green eyes like upside-down wings. He looked sick. But of course he was sick. Why else would he wear a mask?

I wondered if he was going to make me sick, too. Probably, but I didn’t care.

“What happened to your mother?” he asked. “If you don’t mind me asking?”

“She was very ill,” I answered, echoing the words of my father and grandfather, of doctors and therapists and my mother herself.

“Do you have any brothers or sisters?”

I thought of my father’s new baby. “No.”

“Is there anyone else who can pick you up? An aunt or uncle, maybe grandparents?”

“My grandpa would if he was here, but he’s not. He lives in New York. I wish I could live with him. He has a seeing eye dog named Bugsy.” I caught myself just then, and immediately wished I could take everything back. I was talking to a stranger. A *man* stranger. How stupid was I? If my mother really was looking down on me from heaven like my stepmom said, then she was surely throwing a fit. And what the hell had gotten into me? I hadn’t talked this much in months. In years. And here I was, spilling my soul to this stranger?

“Do you want to go find someone to call him?”

“No. I’m mad at him for forgetting me, but I’d rather be here than home.” I wiped my eyes again, but to my surprise they were dry. Then I held out my hand. “I’m Nicky.”

His green eyes crinkled. I wondered if it was dangerous to touch him—not for me, but for him. Experience with my mother’s illness taught me that it’s very easy to make sick people sicker with a careless touch or breath.

But took my hand in his and shook it. “Good to meet you, Nicky. I’m Sorry.”

“For what?”

“That’s my name. My name is Sorry.” He looked around the mall. “So…you don’t want to go home, and you’ve already seen a movie. Are you hungry?”

“No.”

“Well, what’s your favorite store?”

“I don’t know,” I lied.

He held out his hand again. “Then how about I take you to *my* favorite store?”

I hesitated, staring at the bruised nails and long fingers.

“Don’t be afraid,” he said. “I’m not scary. I promise.”

I doubted that, but there were people all around us. There wasn’t anything he could do to me without someone noticing and intervening. So I took his hand and hid a smile as he led me — of all places — into World of Toys.

None of the other customers spared me a glance. I was so disappointed, so bizarrely embarrassed about being a nonentity, that it took a minute to realize that they barely looked at Sorry, either. 

For the first time in weeks, I felt myself relax.

Sorry led me to the back corner, where there was a nondescript grey door. He opened it. I felt my hackles go up, but I needn’t have worried; he propped it wide open before beckoning me inside.

It was small and lined with tables, with a cracked concrete floor. The tables were cluttered with broken toys. Rising among the detritus like skyscrapers were beautiful sculptures. It took me a moment to realize that the sculptures were made with broken pieces.

“Is this like…your workshop?” I asked.

“One of them.” He pulled out a chair at the nearest table.

Even though I didn’t exactly want to, I sat down. “How many do you have?”

“Two.”

“Where’s the other one?”

His eyes crinkled again. “Close by.”

Fine, I thought; he could keep his stupid toy-making Santa Claus secrets. I turned my attention to the creation before me. It was fascinating and a little scary: A porcelain doll with three heads, six arms, and a tail that had clearly been appropriated from a Godzilla figurine. 

“That’s creepy,” I said. “But pretty, too.”

“I know.” He started picking through the pieces arrayed on the table, choosing the best ones – parts that were clean and shiny, things that would have looked new had they not been broken—and set them in front of me. “Do you want to try?”

To my intense surprise, I did.

While we talked, I built. I only paid half the attention I should have, following an instinct I didn’t know I possessed. I had no idea what I was doing, but somehow knew when I had finished.

So did he.

We both pushed our chairs back and studied the thing I’d made. Long and thin, skinny arms desperately outstretched with hands like claws. Eerie and almost inhuman, but not quite.

“It’s my mom,” I said. Even though I hadn’t known it until the words left my mouth, I knew it was true.

“It’s haunting,” he told me. “But beautiful, too.” He glanced up at the wall, at a clock I hadn’t even noticed. “It’s late. Do you think your father remembered to come?”

“I hope not,” I said. “If he did, I’m going to be in trouble.”

“We should probably check anyway.” He held out his hand for a third time. I grabbed it happily, wrapping my fingers around his narrow palm the way I’d once wrapped them around my mother’s. 

The toy store was almost empty and reeked of bleach. That could only mean it was almost closing time. I saw three kids sorting through a shelf of picture books with two spines, and two teenagers talking intently. One was a tall blonde girl, the other a boy whose curly dark hair shone under the lights. Everyone ignored us except the boy. He looked at me as we left, watching intently. I stared back curiously, wondering what he saw. 

I didn’t know it then, but that was Marley.

I’m not telling you about Marley.

Then we were out of the store and into the main promenade. Up beyond the skylights, the sky was dark. My stomach clenched unpleasantly. I was going to be in so much trouble.

Sorry led me to the front of the mall. My heart immediately fell to the floor; my father was standing there with a police officer, a security guard, and a lady who could only be a manager. Dad’s red face shone under the lights, sweat glowing like beads of amber as he yelled at them all.

Sorry’s hand slid out of mine. “I’ll see you again soon.”

Then he was gone. I turned around, but even though the mall was nearly empty, I couldn’t see him anywhere. I turned to face the front at the exact moment my father noticed me.

Tears stung my eyes again. I willed them away and held my head up high as Dad ran to meet me. For a second, I thought I was going to get slapped. Instead he dropped to his knees and hugged me. It was the first time in months. He held on so tightly I couldn’t breathe. I didn’t know what to do. 

“Where were you?” he asked.

The volume on my mental loop increased dramatically: *It’s like looking at a crocodile, or a shark, or a goddamned spider*.

“I got lost.”

“Are you okay? Did anyone hurt you?”

The hair on the back of my neck prickled. Somehow, I knew that Sorry was watching. “No. I just…I miss Mom.”

His face spasmed. I saw sorrow, guilt, anger, shame. He pulled me into another hug. “I know.” His arms tightened painfully. “But don’t do that again.”

“I won’t,” I lied. “I promise.”

My father grounded me for two weeks following what he called my “kidnapping scare.” Even though I hated it, part of me was grateful.

The moment we left the mall, my imagination roared into a horrifying sort of overdrive, examining every terrible scenario that could have occurred at Sorry’s hand.

By the time we got home, I was too scared to sleep.

I’d told Sorry everything about myself. What if he tracked me down? What if he broke into my house? What if my father found out? What if something even worse happened?

The terrors of childhood are uniquely powerful and overwhelming. They are hypnotic, paralytic, all-encompassing emotional typhoons. My fear or Sorry was no different.

But like all storms, it passed.

And on Monday afternoon, I went back to the mall.

I found Sorry inside World of Toys, standing behind the counter. The wall behind him was full of big, dark holes. The sight made me shiver.

Then he smiled, and my fear evaporated.

His eyes crinkled over the paper mask. “I’m so glad to see you.”

I don’t even remember what we did. I only remember that being with him gave me the same comfort as being with my mother.

We talked about everything and nothing. Talking to him was so easy it scared me. The only thing I didn’t want to talk about with him was my dad, even though he kept asking. I deflected. I was afraid that talking about him would somehow jinx my friendship with Sorry.

But it went even deeper than that. In my heart, my father was the opposite of my mother – in other words, the very last thing I wanted to think about when I was at the mall.

But Sorry just wouldn’t let up.

Finally, I snapped. “We don’t get along, okay? He said I’m creepy like a spider because I look at him weird and don’t hug him enough or whatever.”

Sorry gave me a confused look. “There’s nothing wrong with that. Everything in this world either is predator or prey. Order or chaos. A spider or a fly. Being called a spider is a compliment.”

“From you, maybe, because you’re weird. But it definitely wasn’t a compliment coming from him.”

“Just because he’s too stupid to know it’s a compliment doesn’t make it any less of one.”

I looked up at him, stunned. No one—not my grandpa, not my mom, and certainly not me—had ever referred to my father as *stupid*. It was blasphemy, a notion so thoroughly forbidden that I’d never even dared to think about thinking it.  

“Did you know,” Sorry asked, “that spiders can sense other spiders? They’re able to seek each other out, especially if one’s in trouble.”

I didn’t know much about spiders, but I knew they were solitary creatures so this sounded like grade-A bullshit. “Spiders eat other spiders, dude.”

“Not always. The *good* spiders know better. They stay in their own territory, hunt their own prey, keep out of each other’s way. But when their home is in danger, they come together.”

“How come no one’s ever told me that before?”

He leaned across the table, lean and liquid. “Because you’ve never met someone who understands spiders.” His eyes were bright on the surface but dark underneath. The kind of eyes that rose silently from the depths of a river before swallowing you whole. Eyes so still they almost didn’t look human. 

*A crocodile, or a shark, or a goddamned—* 

“Are you saying you’re a spider too?”

Those glassy bright-but-dark eyes crinkled. “I am. And I’ve waited a very long time to meet another one.”

I looked down quickly to hide the warmth in my face. “What do spiders do, exactly?”

“Spiders always do what needs to be done. No matter what.”

I caught a whiff of bleach and wrinkled my nose. “What kind of things need to be done?” 

Sorry looked up sharply. His eyes lost their smiley crinkle and their light, leaving flat, alien darkness.

Panic bloomed in my chest, thick and somehow lush. My muscles tensed up, ready to spring and sprint even though I knew I could never outrun him.

Then I realized he was focused on someone behind me.

“Nicky,” he said softly. “Look at that man.”

I turned. The stench of bleach intensified as a headache sparked to life behind my eyes. The man in question wasn’t much more than a boy, thin and bony with sad eyes and a sheaf of dark hair that shone copper in the lights.

“Do you see anything wrong with him?”

The man drifted toward us, scanning the shelves with their myriad toys. As he came closer, I caught another eye-watering whiff of bleach. 

“I don’t see anything wrong with him.” I turned to face Sorry. The darkness in his eyes was still there. Worse, it had dripped down to the rest of him. The easy brightness he normally exuded was gone, replaced with stillness and shadows. “But he smells really strong. Like bleach.”

And just like that, Sorry lit up again. “Bleach?”

“Yeah. It’s like…” I struggled to find words. I didn’t yet know the word *caustic*, but that’s what I was trying to describe. “Like a cloud. It burns my eyes. It’s almost like…like poison.”

“That’s exactly what it is,” Sorry said. 

“Is he poisoned? Should we call 911? Is that what spiders do?” I didn’t even realize I was half out of my chair until Sorry’s hand slid over mine and pressed down. 

“No,” he said.

I lowered myself back to the chair, watching Sorry with repulsed fascination. His brightness was flicking on and off like a lightbulb in a broken lamp. I’d never seen anything like it, could barely believe I was seeing it. Light and smiles one second, reptilian flatness the next. My friend, followed by a monster. Friend. Monster. Friend. Monster. Friend.

He slid across the table again. I leaned in instinctively, even though it was the last thing I wanted to. “He isn’t poisoned, Nicky. He *is* poison. Most people would never be able to tell. But we can, because we aren’t like other people. We’re more.”

“We’re spiders,” I said.

Sorry smiled. 

Then he said, “I haven’t shown you the shop rules. Do you want to see?”

“Did I break any?”

He laughed. “No. You couldn’t even if you tried, because the rules aren’t for spiders. The rules are for flies and web-rippers, but spiders still have to know the rules.”

“What are web-rippers?”

“Spiders that stopped weaving the web and decided to tear holes in it instead. Don’t worry. I’ll show you how to deal with them later. First — the rules.”

He went behind the counter and pulled out a piece of paper that said:

*RULES FOR THE WORLD ROULETTE*

1. *Don’t leave anything that’s yours inside*
2. *Don’t take anything with you when you go*
3. *Don’t open any doors*
4. *Ignore the tunnels*
5. *Stay out of the flowers*
6. *Don’t touch the red mold*
7. *Leave the animals inside*
8. *Don’t go anywhere with the Moon King*
9. *Don’t read the blue books*
10. *If you see yourself, have fun!*
11. *If it has too many eyes, then RUN*

I grimaced. “Sorry, those are some creepy rules.”

“Want to see something else that’s creepy?”

I noticed, then, that the store was empty except for us.

“I guess,” I said cautiously.

His eyes were practically glowing. He took me by the hand and led me to the wall behind the counter. The wall with all the holes.

“Reach in.” He pointed to the biggest hole. It bled darkness the way lamps bleed light. “And spread your fingers.”

I did. 

A second later, something inside the wall grabbed my hand. I shrieked and pulled it out. Then I laughed and put it back in. Whoever was in there laced their fingers through mine. “It tickles!”

“I’m glad you like it,” he said. “Because guess what? It’s your present. It’s a work in progress, but I’m making it just for you.”

Images of glorious giant dolls and animatronic animals filled my brain. The kind of toys only kids can dream of. 

And I dreamed of them for days.

I wish I could say the hands in the wall were the strangest thing that ever happened between Sorry and me, but they weren’t even the weirdest thing that happened that week.

Four days after the wall hands, Sorry beckoned me behind the counter again and showed me a tunnel.

A tunnel —a literal tunnel — in the floor.

“There’s a surprise for you on the other side,” he told me. “Something just for spiders.”

“The rules say we have to stay out of tunnels.”

“The rules are for flies.”

I didn’t want to go, but I didn’t know how to say so. I also didn’t want to tell him no.

So I went through the tunnel.

At the other end was another, better mall. Like an East Hills Mall from a brighter, better world.

And I don’t know how to describe it, except to say that it truly felt like home.

I’d never felt that sense of home before, and only felt it a second time after I met Marley. It was overwhelming. It was terrifying. But above all, it was a relief. It made me cry for sheer joy.

Once I calmed down, Sorry led me around the new mall.

There was so much there. So many more people, and it was so much bigger and *happier*. East Hills was a small and super dingy little single-story mall. This place was three stories high and beautiful. 

Sorry and I stayed long after the crowds left and the lights went off, dodging security guards and alarms. We chased each other around the rim of the fountain, stole cookies from the shop, and loaded up on bootleg Pokemon cards from the kiosks on the promenade.  

I felt like I was home. Like when my mother was alive and my father was with us and we were all happy.

After what must have been hours, we went back through the tunnel. It late — beyond late — so he made me a little bedroll in his workshop and tucked me in.

“Sorry,” I said. “I wish you were my dad.”

“Would you wish that even if I was a monster?”

I thought of my father, who couldn’t stand me. Of my mother, who had left me. Of my stepmom who pretended I didn’t exist. Of my grandfather, who refused to let me live with him even after I begged.

“All parents are monsters,” I said. “So I don’t care.”

He laughed, then started to sing softly. A lullaby. I drifted off to sleep, dreaming of brighter worlds and the mysterious hand-holding present inside the wall.

When I woke up, I asked him about it. HIs eyes crinkled, like always. “I’m still working on it.”

That weekend, he put me to work in his workshop. He told me to make whatever I wanted and to follow my instincts, and gave me a bin full of pieces that were weird, even creepy. But that suited me just find, because I was weird and creepy.

I was a spider, after all.

A few days later, Sorry took me through another tunnel. I thought we were going to the other mall again. I was wrong. Where he took me was even better: A massive forest, deep and dark, with a still black lake on the horizon and fireflies everywhere.

“Be careful,” he told me. “This is where the Moon King lives.”

“You said the rules aren’t for spiders.”

“*This* rule is for you.”

The memories start melting together after that. 

The next one I remember clearly is being in World of Toys, maybe a week later. 

I remember the smell. Bleach. A flood of bleach. Enough bleach to drown the whole happy, filthy world.

I turned and saw a girl. I couldn’t tell you what she looked like. All I can remember is the stench, the way it made my eyes burn and stomach turn.

“Nicky,” Sorry whispered. “Send her into the workshop.”

“Why?”

“So I can talk to her about her smell. Privately, so she doesn’t get embarrassed in front of the other customers.”

That’s what I did. 

Only it almost didn’t work.

The girl was hesitant. Like she could see through me. So I kind of lost it and pretended to be sick. I told her there was a phone inside the workshop, could she please use it to call my dad?

That worked. The door closed behind her.

I glanced around the store, checking to see whether anyone noticed her going inside.

When I turned around again, the workshop door was gone.

Just a blank expanse of wall where it had been ten seconds prior.

I waited for a long time. The door didn’t reappear. Neither did Sorry.

When it started to get dark, I went home.

My father started screaming the second I walked through the front door, so I spun around and marched right back out again. 

I stomped over to the empty playground and plopped down in one of the swings, staring up at the light polluted sky and withering in the humid, hot dark.

After awhile, I heard a shuffle behind me and caught a whiff of bleach, so powerful it made my throat tighten. 

It was a teenager, picking his way through the playground. I didn’t know him then, but I do now. Better than I know anyone. Better than I’ll ever know anyone. It was Marley. I’m not telling you about Marley. You can’t make me. 

The scent of bleach frightened me, so I trekked the three miles back to the mall. It was only twenty minutes to closing, so I hurried to the back and burst into World of Toys.

To my immense relief, Sorry stood behind the counter.

But as I drew closer, his eyes went dark, the kind of darkness that drowns you.

“Why,” he asked, “do you smell like a web-ripper?”

I told him about the boy in the park, how he didn’t come near me and I didn’t go near him because he smelled so bad it made my throat hurt.

The brightness flickered back into his eyes. “If you ever smell bleach like that again, bring them to me.”

I promised that I would.

And for a while, we just kept doing what we were doing.

I loved it. I lived for it. I lived for the mall and for the days I got to see Sorry. For the days I got to feel seen. For the days I felt like I was home.

Those days ended when a woman named Rebecca walked into World of Toys. That was the first time Rebecca ended something that made me happy. I’m not telling you about the second time.

Rebecca came to the store to meet Marley, but I didn’t know that then. I didn’t even know her name.

I only knew that she stank of bleach.

The stench made me gag. I started to cough the way people start coughing when they eat something they’re allergic to. Like a giant was crushing my windpipe.

Rebecca hurried over. She kept asking *Are you okay? Are you okay, sweetie? Where’s your parents?* I was coughing too hard to utter a word, let alone explain that she was the reason I was coughing in the first place. 

I staggered off, head swimming, eyes streaming. “Help me,” I wheezed. “Please.”

Rebecca followed me all the way to World of Toys, where I collapsed in front of Sorry’s workshop. 

Sorry came out immediately. Dark spots swarmed my eyes, dancing like flies. Sorry had a quick conversation with Rebecca. Together, the two of them carried me inside the workshop.

Once the door shut, I could breathe again. Like the giant had released my windpipe. 

Right as I sucked in my first breath, Rebecca screamed.

I couldn’t see anything through my watering eyes, but I smelled blood.

I heard something — a heavy thud, a wet choking sound — and Rebecca stopped screaming.

“What did you do?” My voice was raspy and weak. “Sorry, what happened?”

Sorry knelt down and wiped my eyes. “Nicky,” he said.

I looked over his shoulder. Rebecca was crumpled in a heap, her clothes already stained with blood.

Sorry grabbed my face and turned it to his. “Look at me. I’m going to show you what we do with web-rippers. Do you remember the rules?”

I nodded.

“Remember.” He took my hands and rubbed circles in my palms with his thumbs. “They’re for flies. Flies and web-rippers. That’s what spiders do: We kill flies, and we kill web-rippers.”

I couldn’t help it. I started to cry.

Sorry brushed my tears away again. “I’m going to show you something, Nicky. Remember: The rules aren’t for us. The rules are for flies.”

He pulled down his mask, showing me his face for the first time.

Neatly arrayed along his cheekbones and his jaw were six green eyes.

“What are you?” I asked.

“A spider, just like you.” Then he pulled me to my feet and led me to Rebecca.

She whimpered when she saw me. Blood dribbled from her mouth.

“Your present is ready,” Sorry told me. “You’ll get it tonight, as long as you finish this.” 

“What am I supposed to do?”

“Cut her open. We need her sinews to repair the web. They need to be fresh so the knots will hold.” He forced her to stand up, then pressed the knife into my hand.

Rebecca sobbed so hard she gagged.

I hesitated.

Then I whirled around and stabbed Sorry through one of his eyes.

As he screamed and staggered, I grabbed Rebecca by the hand and ran.

As we tore through the toy shop, something in the wall — something with eyes that glittered through the very same hole through which I’d stuck my hand a hundred times by now — bellowed.

We ran out into the mall.

Rebecca was slow. She was bleeding everywhere and kept slipping on her own blood. She kept trying to wrench away from me. She kept screaming *Your hands! What’s wrong with your hands?* 

Sorry chased us. He was screaming too. *Come back,* he said. *Come back, it’s okay, I’m not angry! I love you! Come back! Come see your present! I made it just for you*!

In between his screams, I heard another bellowing roar.

Finally, the entrance came into view.

Behind me, I heard feet slapping the polished floor. One, two, four, six, more, too many feet, too many footsteps pounding closer, closer —

“It’s your present!” Sorry screamed. “*Don’t run from me*!”

I reached the entrance and shoved Rebecca outside. Unable to help myself, I turned around. I saw my present.

It was my mother.

A corruption of my mother. That strange little sculpture brought to enormous life, all teeth and grasping claws and glittering eyes. Too many eyes, just like Sorry. A monster, just like Sorry.

Because all parents are monsters.

It extended a glimmering claw and stroked my cheek as Sorry wailed.

I ran away and didn’t come back.

Not for years. Not until I met Marley.

Sorry was a monster, but he taught me what it means to be seen. What it means to be truly loved. I recognized that kind of love in Marley. 

I’m not telling you about Marley. I won’t. I can’t.

His mother won’t let me.

No one can control his mother. Not even you.

But if you want to try, she’s waiting for you in cell 23.
