I think my coworker is a goblin. No, I *know* my coworker is a goblin. Or at least something like that. I've never heard of a goblin wearing someone else's skin. Some stories say they can shift into animals, but are humans really on that list? Anyway, if you are just finding me, probably best for you to start[ here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/z1kdi2/i_work_at_a_coffee_shop_my_boss_offered_me_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

\--------------------------------------

I wanted to explain some things in more detail to you all. First, I do not work Tuesdays or Wednesdays, unless specifically requested to by management (such as this Wednesday). Work days are ten hour shifts; we do *not* leave the store until it is time to close. I asked what would happen if we did and no one was sure, but Em suggested that Tall Ben would probably take advantage of the situation. I go in at 7:00pm, we lock up at 5:00:am. That was the shift I was getting used to, the overnights that Richard promised. For whatever reason, Monday's mystery resulted in a change of plans. Richard wants us to open earlier. He was incredibly specific about the time that the store needed to be opened, no earlier than 7:00pm, but now he wants to push back our hours to 5:00pm. That means a twelve hour shift, not including breaks.

That also means I get a flex day off. I honestly find the idea tempting.

It didn't matter what I thought about it, however, as Richard's decision was final. Selene told me that he was *not* happy about the situation on Monday. She tried to explained that we *did* work on Monday, a full shift, but that didn't matter.

"He isn't being unreasonable, though." She explained on my Wednesday shift. "You have to know the ins and outs of this weird place to understand why he makes those decisions. Do I agree with him? Maybe not. It is his store. So, if you want to keep working here, you'll have to accept the new hours."

Selene was already in the parking lot when I arrived. She was leaning against her car, observing Amber unload her boxes of candles. When I got out, Amber called me by name and waved. This time, she didn't offer me anything nor ask any questions. She got her stuff, disappeared around the building, and presumably set up her little shop.

"You told her your name?"

"The packet said to answer her questions."

"Touche."

"Is that... dangerous?"

"Listen, even I am not entirely sure *what* candle lady is. She sells extremely dangerous candles. She has rules, like any supernatural being." I hadn't realized she was supernatural, but it made sense with the whole candle thing. "The name thing, with them having power, is usually a fae thing. She isn't a fae, I would know. I don't think she cares about human names."

"She bothers customers too?"

"She bothers everyone that might be able to buy a candle. Drive thru menu lets everyone know that we do not endorse Amber's sales and are not responsible for whatever happens, should someone approach her."

I got there early again, by fifteen minutes. That's 4:15 on the new shift. With Tall Ben having followed me home, I was itching to get out of the apartment and around people who knew how to deal with him. Anyone who read my last post is aware that Selene was there with Tall Ben, or at least her likeness. I assumed that it was only a lure to get me to step out, but one of you suggested that it might have actually *been* Selene who led Tall Ben to my place. Did I have something to do with why Monday went wrong? Was Tall Ben tied to it? I wanted to ask her, but I held warnings to heart. You said to keep my mouth shut about it and, considering how new I am at dealing with the supernatural, I am going to listen.

We small talked, but the time to clock on was coming quickly. It was 4:22.

"The Wednesday crew is a bit different. Little John won't be in the kitchen, you'll be meeting Johnny today. One thing to note; you are the only one with any fixed days off. Lucky, if you ask me."

Did she mean Jonathan? Barrow had mentioned him on Monday. "Why do I get a special shift?"

"We already have someone like you on Tuesday and Wednesday."

"Someone like me?"

She smiled. "Johnny."

"I'll be the judge of that." I quipped. Cars were pulling in, so I would be making that judgment soon.

Barrow arrived, followed by Em. We went to the door, waiting for Jonathan. With seconds to spare, an old minivan turned into the parking lot at far too high a speed. The car almost tipped over, then missed a parking spot to hit a "handicap" sign hard enough to bend it. I was expecting a person to climb out, but I was unpleasantly surprised.

I am not sure if they were just called this thing Jonathan or if this was an early customer. It approached us at the door just as Selene was pushing it open. I let it pass, then followed Barrow and Em inside. Once in the lobby, Selene gestured at the thing.

"New Guy, Johnny. Johnny, New Guy."

That wasn't my name, but I didn't much care. "H-hey..." I offered awkwardly, denying the hand that he stretched out.

"You two know each other, Axel?" Em asked.

I certainly hoped I did not know, or had not known, whoever the thing was wearing. It was as if a person had been skinned and their... pelt treated to be worn as a costume. I mean, I could see the damn things eyes! It was like a poor fitting mask, the bone structure underneath did not fit the skin suit at all! The thing was short, misshapen, and far too fat for the person it decided to wear. Uhg, I can still smell the thing. Piss, it smelled like piss.

When its mouth opened, it was extremely wide. Bigger than the person it wore. It had to be the absolute worst disguise I had ever seen. "Nah, I don't think so. Nice to meet you there, Axel." It tried its hand again.

Now I try not to be insensitive. There are all sorts of people out there and, more recently, I am discovering that the scope of shapes and sizes is far beyond my tiny understanding. But surely this was not Jonathan, surely they intended to introduce me to a normal person. Well, not normal, but at least human!

"Okay, I am not trying to be rude, but-" I started.

A car pulled into the parking lot, dragging everyone's attention. I only looked briefly, but was quickly grabbed by the... Jonathan.

"Listen, bub." Its voice changed completely. Instead of passing as a chain-smoking person, it now sounded like a toad learned english. "Don't ruin this for me, or I'll skin you up and put you in my closet. Capiche?"

"Ruin what?"

It spoke quietly. "I'm hiding low and don't need a limp dick like you blowing my cover. Getting them all fooled isn't easy, especially the pixie."

"Pixie?"

"You're a dumbass, aren't you?"

"Look, what even are you?"

The car in the parking lot was idling and apparently lost the group's interest. They went to their stations and "Jonathan" turned to do the same. As he did, he opened his mouth wide and gave a few chomps. Did he want to eat me, or skin me? Both sounded unpleasant, so it seemed in my best interest to keep his identity a secret. I don't know what exactly I was keeping to myself, however, as all my coworkers had eyes. They could see that whatever the thing was wasn't their Jonathan!

When we open, there are a few things that are pretty important to have done beforehand. To paint you a picture, I'll start with stations. Depending on who you ask, the front counter is the easiest to learn. Since I am more experienced, and seeing as I worked it on Monday, I was given drive thru. Barrow was on bar, making any drink that had espresso. Either the front counter or drive thru, assuming they weren't busy, could make frozen drinks (we use pre-made base that has espresso) and anything else that didn't require steamed milk. With "Jonathan" in the back making sandwiches (god, I just realized that thing is making food for customers), we had all our bases covered.

Before opening, we want to make sure those frozen drink bases are good to go. It would be pretty stupid to run out in the middle of a rush. They'd already stocked them up the night before, so we were good on that. Sweet and unsweet tea, I had to make a pitcher of both. Brew a pot of drip coffee, then a coffee of the day as well. Our normal drip is a medium roast, just like The Drowsy Student. The daily coffee changed, todayâ€™s was a dark roast. Colombian, this time. Not that matters to you at all. Our lobby had booths and chairs and at night we put the chairs atop the tables. Em had already finished flipping them back, so we were pretty much ready to open.

Selene went to her office after unlocking the door and hitting the open sign. Her job seemed to simply consist of defending the store and employee base from random attacks. Since one happened on my first day, I'd say that they are probably common. I felt more comfortable with her there. As long as I followed the rules, she would see to the rest.

That car was still outside. Though, once Selene informed the supernatural world that we were open, a man stepped out. A tan coat, short hair, beard. Something about his jaw line, his nose, his eyes... this was a thinking man. I was certain I was not looking at some monster or cryptid. Calculated, he scanned the parking lot before making a move. I made the assumption that he must have not been to The Drowsy Spectre before. That was for two reasons; he was entirely suspicious, as well as he wouldn't have known that our hours changed.

Regardless, he made his approach towards the door. Em, Barrow, and I grouped up near the bar to watch him come in. To my dismay, I smelled piss and up came the squatter. To my surprise, he started to hurry back to the kitchen without a word when he spotted the man that was approaching. The door squeaked open, rang a bell, and closed behind him.

"Welcome to Drowsy Spectre!" I offered, as our usual greeting.

He moved to the front counter, eyeing the empty establishment. "Dr. Fields." A badge, which Barrow examined.

"An inspector." Barrow shook his head. "But how did you know we changed our hours?"

"Didn't. Never been this way." He put the badge away. "Naturally, I'll need to see everyone working right now."

"Of course, of course. Jonathan, Selene!"

Her office door opened, she spotted the man, and rolled her eyes. "Again?"

"I guess so." Fields replied.

Why on earth was a doctor doing inspections? Jonathan didn't come up, so Barrow called again. "Jonathan, come on!"

Out came the little ass. I guess it was nervous; the disguise was majorly out of place. Only one eye hole was lined up right, the nose was down by its mouth, and one leg was rolled up to its knee. How the hell was anyone falling for that? Still, Selene, Barrow, and Em stood with "Jonathan" as if nothing at all was amiss.

"And your names?"

Barrow introduced everyone.

"Looking for somebody. Not your usual suspect. He's been breaking some rules, been a real pain in the ass to track down." Was he an inspector, or a detective? "Stopped at a few places like this. Almost had him at a little gas station."

"Who is he?" Barrow asked, intrigued.

"Bilgoth. A goblin."

"You said he broke some rules?"

"Sure." Dr. Fields shrugged. "Whatever. Seen him?"

"We haven't seen a goblin. But, of course, I don't know if I would recognize one. They make pretty good disguises." Em replied.

I glanced over at the goblin, who *had* to be Bilgoth. She *couldn't* be serious! That was the worst... ah, nevermind. Anyway, Dr. Fields grinned at Em as if she'd said something funny. "You wouldn't?"

"Oh. You know?"

"You aren't hiding it very well."

Em shrugged. "Well that's your opinion, mister."

"Doctor." He turned to me. "And you; have you seen anything strange, anything noteworthy?"

"I just started."

"Even better." Dr. Fields waited expectantly. "And?"

I glanced at Bilgoth. Look, I wasn't certain if he had killed Jonathan. And if I am honest, the poor thing did look absolutely terrified. That, and Dr. Fields was kind of being a dick. "No, sir. Aside from normal... stuff."

"Normal?" Again, he chuckled. "Normal." He moved towards the door. "I'll be keeping my eye on things. Got a few other places I want to look." With his left hand, he flicked a card. I couldn't help but be impressed when it landed right on the front counter, next to the register. "Call me if you see Bilgoth. Be seein' ya."

With that, he left them to their work. Thankfully, no one else had come in. Heartmin was nowhere to be seen (it appeared that even supernatural forces weren't magically aware of the new hours). Of course, Barrow did say she isn't consistent.

I turned to Bilgoth. "Okay, I saved your ass and you stink worse than a rest stop bathroom. You owe me some explanation."

My coworkers were taken aback. "Hey, don't talk to Jonathan like that!" Em came to his defense.

"Axel, calm down man." Barrow too.

Selene, however, was suspicious. "What do you mean?"

Bilgoth leaned forward and sneered. "I don't owe you shit."

"Oh, maybe I should tell Dr. Fields that."

"No!" Bilgoth begged as I moved towards the counter. "No, not that!"

"Care to explain, New Guy?" Selene wasn't patient.

"I mean, seriously, guys? He's a goblin. Jonathan is a goblin, or... or I guess a goblin is wearing Jonathan?"

Em burst with laughter. "No! You're joking! *I* would know that!"

"Okay, first, he *is* a goblin. Second, why do you keep saying that?"

Her laughing slowed and she glanced at Barrow. "No reason."

Barrow hadn't said anything. I didn't see him silently go behind the counter, nor did I see him pull out a silver coin from underneath the front register. He tossed it on the ground near Bilgoth, who could not resist diving down to catch it.

"Oh." Was all Em said.

"Yeah, that's a goblin." Barrow crossed his arms. "A goblin wearing one of our coworkers."

Bilgoth, silver coin in hand, realized he'd been caught. "Jokes out, huh?"

Selene rubbed the bridge of her nose. "What? How did you... you didn't look like that before."

"What can I say? I am a master of my craft." He bowed.

"So what about Johnny? Did you kill him?"

He turned on me. "What? No! I didn't kill no one. Goblins ain't about killing people, then we'd have no one to mess with. Nah, I found the bloke in the woods. He'd been there a day or two."

"So you decided to wear him?" Barrow relaxed a bit. "That was your master plan?"

"That shitter Fields was on my ass. So yeah, best plan I could think of."

"But goblins don't wear human disguises. Besides, I would- or should- have spotted you."

Bilgoth looked up at Em. "Yeah, you should have. Losing your senses a bit, being around all these normies."

"But if it was that easy to spot you, why didn't Dr. Fields have a silver coin or something?" It only made sense. If I was hunting something that loved silver that much, it would be incredibly easy. "That seems like common sense."

"You ask the good questions, kid. My best bet? He can't go near silver. Tells ya he ain't human neither." Bilgoth rightened the eye holes of his costume. "So, what do you say, can I be Jonathan for a bit? Now, now, before gang up against me, think about it; Jonathan is dead, who's gonna make ya sandwiches and shit? I can do that and no one will bat an eye because I'll be in the back! You need me."

"We don't *need* you." Selene snapped. But, she sighed and nodded. "But we do need someone in the kitchen, and it is too late to call another employee in. So sure, why not?"

"Yippie!' The goblin jumped, a hand in the air.

There was no way. "You're serious?! He's not... he's not..."

"Human?" Selene crossed her arms. "And what's wrong with that?"

"Well... for starters, he is wearing our dead coworker!"

Selene hesitated. "Y-yeah. That is kinda bad I guess."

"Plus, he isn't a human."

"He's still a person."

"Not a normal person."

She didn't like that. "And if I were to tell you that you were the only 'normal' person working?"

Well that wasn't true. Barrow and Em were people. I only doubt Selene's humanity because of Tuesday night. "You aren't... normal?" Look, I know you guys said to be careful, but it was the perfect chance to get some answers.

But she walked away. So, yeah. I should have listened to you guys.

I lifted my eyes to Barrow and Em. "What does she mean?"

He nodded at Em, who stood next to him. "Us."

"What?" They looked normal!

"I'm a... I'm-" Em started.

"She's a pixie." Barrow answered for her.

"I didn't need your help, mister."

No, pixies were small. I know the media gets folklore wrong a lot, but surely they didn't just look like normal people. Yeah, Em was short, but not *fairy* short. "What, is this some sort of hazing?" They were serious. "Come on. You can't convince me that pixies aren't.... like... tiny flying people."

"I took a giant potion." Em stated, matter of fact.

I looked her up and down. "You're short."

She crossed her arms. "That wasn't very nice."

"And you?" I asked Barrow.

"Yeah, I don't think you're ready for that one." He chuckled. "Get a few weeks under your belt and we can touch that one."

Okay. I'll be honest, I didn't like that answer, but what am I supposed to do? As the shift went on, it eventually got dark. We were never busy, but there were just enough people trickling in to keep me attentive. In between tasks, when no one was in the store, Barrow and Em would tell stories about their time at the cafe. Those would make interesting posts, so I will certainly bring them up later. Something I am learning is that there is a difference between humans and people. Em was a person, Barrow was a person. Yet, as I was recently informed, they were not humans. Barrow was... something, and Em was a pixie. I didn't really know what that meant for them, nor did it seem proper to interrogate them on it. I preferred to treat them no differently than I had before. They welcomed me onto their team with open arms, it was only right I keep an open mind.

Tall Ben was at the window, he scared the shit out of me. His big head stared at me from the top left of the drive thru window and, when I saw him, he jerked his head in greeting. I know it is *technically* against the rules, but I opened the window.

"Do you actually understand english, or do you just mimic?"

"Nah, I don't speak english. Only American." Tall Ben grinned, as if he'd made the funniest joke ever.

I wasn't in the mood. "Why'd you follow me home? Have you done that to anyone else?"

"Do the people see you?"

I hesitated. "W-what?"

"When you go home, do the people see you?"

Such an odd question, one that I didn't really understand the meaning of. "What do you want from me?"

For once, Tall Ben seemed genuine. He leaned down, as if a grand secret was being revealed. "Milk. I make a special milk, but I am all out of meat. If you won't come outside, then let's make a deal. You get me some meat. Lots of meat. I will answer questions."

"What does milk have to do with meat?"

"I know how milk is made, okay? I watched a lot of videos. Read stuff. Just get me the meat and I'll answer one question. See, I know a lot of folks out here in the woods. Folks that know things. I'll tell you-"

"Bro!" Barrow shouted. "What the hell are you doing?"

I looked down and realized I was halfway up the counter and about to tip out the window. Tall Ben cleared his throat awkwardly, but said nothing. I quickly backed down, planting my feet on the floor, and drew a deep breath.

"Meat, huh?"

"Like I said, any meat will do. Even yours." With that, Tall Ben hurried off into the dark.

"So no more rules, then?" His tone wasn't angry, it was afraid. "You know, DeGuire didn't follow the rules. He was our friend, now look at him!"

"He followed me home! Apparently the rules aren't very strict if the monsters can break them!"

That changed Barrow's deminor completely. "What? Tall Ben followed you home?"

"Yeah, he was outside my apartment door." I left out the part about Selene. "Tried to get me to go outside. I almost fell for it."

"I've never heard of that. He's been trying different things. Recently, he started making puppets of people we know. That's what we thought DeGuire was when he came back."

That may answer why I saw Selene at my apartment, but I was still on guard. "Came back? I thought you said he bought a candle and got fired."

"Come on, Axel, you can't be that thick. He didn't get fired! I mean you got a good look at him. Do you think severance caused his eyes to turn yellow? No, he didn't get fired. He bought a candle, now he is changed. We didn't know he was alive until he stepped through the front door a few weeks ago, begging us to take his place."

"DeGuire is a last name."

Barrow had turned away. "Yeah."

"What's his first name? Why don't we just use that?"

"I don't know what Amber's candles do. I don't know what they are made of, I don't know what sort of creature she is. What I do know, however, is that if we say DeGuire's first name now, he shows up. We can get rid of him, but it just isn't good for any of us to see him like that. We can't help him, lest we want to trade places with him. Since we don't know what that means, I won't let anyone so much as try."

I glanced back to the kitchen, where Bilgoth worked away in Jonathan's skin. "Do we really have to work with that thing?"

"Selene is right. If we don't have someone on all stations, we are screwed. For now, at least, he can stay."

"But does he have to wear Jonathan?"

"He's got to look like one of us."

That was fair, but also too disgusting for me to agree with. "What about the real Jonathan, then?"

"Like I have said before; high turnover around here. He was only on for a month or so."

"So turnover means death?" That was morbid.

"Not always." Em had a customer, so Barrow went to the espresso bar. "But, most times, yes."

No other noteworthy supernatural things happened. At least, not big enough to spend time writing about. Heartmin didn't come in, which Barrow said was strange. Tall Ben did come back. He tried waving me into the woods. Nope, not going to happen. When I got off, I got my phone from my box. Richard had texted me.

"Selene told me the situation with the goblin. That answers some questions. I really appreciate you doing that for me."

Was that what he meant when he said to keep an eye open for anything out of place? The skin suit didn't even come close to fitting! I simply replied with a "Yes sir." And went home. That was the Wednesday shift. I also had to work Thanksgiving, which I had no heads up on. The day before, Selene told me. Thankfully, I have no family to speak of, so I was going to be home doing nothing anyway.

I was also granted Friday off, seeing as I worked Wednesday. I guess Richard didn't want to pay anyone overtime. I'll tell you all about Thursday in a bit, but I've got a whole lot of nothing to get to. Maybe I'll play the 2018 God of War now that it is out on PC. I need to do something to keep myself from looking outside and searching for Tall Ben. I've got to be able to sleep at night. Something he said stuck with me, something about people seeing me. It made me realize that I'd not spoken to anyone outside of work since my first day at The Drowsy Spectre. I am not super social (okay, not social at all) so that wasn't a big surprise. For some reason, it still bothered me.

I've got to decide if I should get meat for Tall Ben, honestly I am not sure if that is a good idea. I want some answers, but is it worth it? I don't know. Anyway, I'll try to get back to yall in a few days. Hope Thanksgiving went well!

And if you see a goblin in a skin suit, maybe don't let it know that you know. I'm pretty sure Bilgoth would have done good on his threat if everyone else wasn't there.
