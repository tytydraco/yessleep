The wardrobe had been purchased from an old antique shop that my mother frequented. It was an old wooden wardrobe, with brass handles, and the name, Simon (presumably the former owner) was etched into the back.

For the first few days things were relatively normal, despite the wardrobe doors seemingly opening on their own.

But then came the noises, always late at night, that sounded very similar to a horse's hooves on a stone floor, coming from the wardrobe, along with a chilly breeze blowing out from the cracks of the wooden doors.

*It's just your tired brain playing tricks on you!* I tried to convince myself. *It's all in your head!*

I told myself that for four nights, as I ignored the quite frankly *terrifying* sounds coming from the wardrobe, which I never had enough courage to open.

But on the fifth night I had had enough of the sleepless nights, I was tired of the absolute terror every night, due to my brain filling in the blanks of the many horrifying possibilities waiting for me behind those wooden doors.

I got up from my bed, with only the moonlight beaming through the open blinds. My heart was racing fast, as I slowly made my way towards the wardrobe, feeling that now familiar breeze through the cracks, only now much more intense, like a strong wind was blowing from the other side.

Slowly reaching out, I pulled the brass handles, the doors *creaked* loudly, moaning as they opened.

The darkness inside the wardrobe was so heavy and dense, that it was like staring into an absolute void of nothingness.

*Anything could live in that darkness!* I thought, which didn't do much to help my nerves.

I slowly, and hesitantly reached out both arms, plunging them into the wardrobe – reaching out far – yet never meeting the back.

I then stepped into the wardrobe, just as Lucy did in C.S Lewis's, The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe.

Only this was certainly not Narnia, there was no snow, or friendly Fauns offering cups of tea, only a narrow arched, stone tunnel greeted me.

*What is this place?* I thought, not having a fucking clue what was going on. *Am I dreaming?* I wiped my eyes in disbelief, then stared down the long passageway, which was heavily blanketed in darkness.

It felt endless as I blindly felt my way down the narrow passage, my breathing heavy, my heart beating like the drums of war inside my chest…

To say that I was terrified would be an understatement.

*I don't think this is a good idea!* The rational part of my brain said. *But it's not everyday you find something like this!* Said the more curious side.

Continuing on through the passage, my eyes finally began to adjust to the darkness a little, and I noticed the walls were dripping with some kind of moisture, which upon closer inspection felt way too thick between my finger and thumb to have been water, and smelled strange.

After a while I finally approached a bend in the passageway.

Looking down the new hallway, which was just as dark, and narrow as the last, I felt a sense of unease, like something was watching me in that darkness, I could feel it in my bones.

I debated whether I should continue on, or head back to the safety of my bedroom, and forget this place even existed…

But that wasn't going to happen, I needed to know what this place was, so curiosity drove me forward, down the new passageway.

As I continued on, I came to realise the absolute silence of this place, an unsettling quiet, that brought many terrifying thoughts to mind.

*Maybe I should turn back!* My eyes were endlessly darting around the darkness, my breathing was growing heavier, as my heart raced faster.

Each step I took became slower and slower, as I hesitantly continued on.

After a while, I reached a dead end.

*All of this for nothing!* I thought, as I stared at the stone wall in defeat.

Feeling exhausted, I leaned against the side wall to rest a little before heading back.

As soon as I leaned against the wall, a hidden door opened behind me, causing me to fall onto my back, and knocking the wind right out of my lungs.

*What the?* I slowly sat up, confused. *Where am I now?*

This hidden passage was much wider than the others, a lot taller too.

I got onto my feet, and brushed myself off, squinting in the darkness, as I took in my new surroundings.

Ahead were three arched tunnels, which each appeared to be branching in a different path – one left – another right – the last headed straight on from what I could see.

*Which way?* I thought, scratching my head.

Before I could make my decision, I was startled by a noise in the darkness behind me. It sounded like footsteps – bare feet on a stone floor – slowly getting closer.

I suddenly screamed, as a hand grabbed my shoulder.

"Shh! Be quiet!" Came a whisper.

I turned around to see a podgy boy standing there with his finger pressed against his lips.

"W-who are you?" I replied.

"Sorry to scare you!" The boy replied, still whispering. "My name is Milo."

"Why are you whispering?"

"It would be best if you also whispered too!" Milo replied, with a serious look in his eyes. "We don't want that *thing* finding us!"

"What thing?" I asked, confused, and a little terrified.

Milo's eyes suddenly looked frightened. "A monster!"

"W-what?" I muttered, feeling a strong urge to turn back.

Milo changed the subject. "How did you end up here anyway?"

"My wardrobe," I replied. "How about you?"

"Same!" He said. "I just walked into the wardrobe, and ended up stuck here in this maze!"

"What do you mean *stuck?"*" I asked.

Milo chuckled nervously. "Haven't you figured it out yet?"

"Figured what out?"

Milo suddenly looked serious. "There is no leaving this place!"
