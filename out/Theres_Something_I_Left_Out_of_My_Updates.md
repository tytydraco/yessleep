Sam here, I need to be honest about something I haven’t admitted in my last couple of updates.  
I’ve left things out. Not about the water, or the Board, or what I’ve seen at the plant — but about myself.

The truth is, I’ve been sick.

It started around the time I was suspended. I chalked it up to exhaustion — stress, bad sleep, pushing myself too hard. But then it settled in like everyone else in town has been reporting: the flu symptoms, the fever, the weakness. I told myself it would pass. I told myself it wasn't the same thing everyone else has, and that made it less frightening somehow. 

Even if I knew, deep down, it wasn't true.

I didn’t write about it because I didn’t want to admit what that meant. I didn't want to accept that, despite boiling all my water, I had nontheless been drinking this contaminated water. That I’d probably been carrying whatever it is Marlowe saw in those slides.

And if I’m being honest — focusing on the investigation was a way to avoid thinking about what was happening to me. Every hike, every note I’ve chased down, every person I’ve called, it was all easier than sitting in the quiet and wondering what’s inside me now.

The fever broke a little while ago, but it’s left other things behind. My joints ache, I have a limp that comes and goes. My fingertips feel numb sometimes, like pins and needles that never quite go away. Every so often, there’s a headache sharp enough to stop me mid-sentence. I’ve tried to ignore them, to keep moving, but it’s getting harder.

That said — I haven’t stopped digging.

I managed to dig up an old packet from when I first started at the plant — the training materials they give you. Safety booklets, technical instructions, facility maps. Most of it’s just routine paperwork, but when I unfolded the site map, something hit me.

I realized those maps don’t show everything.

There are doors in the plant — big, reinforced ones — that I remember walking past a hundred times, that aren’t marked anywhere on the diagrams. Nobody on my crew ever had access. Nobody seemed to know where they led. We used to joke about it, chalk it up to archives or storage, but now I’m not so sure.

Because lately, I’ve noticed Board executives visiting the plant. Normally they stick to their offices, or send someone lower down if they need something from the floor. But now they’re showing up in groups, and I can't help but assume that they, if anyone, are the ones with access to those doors.

Maybe their arrival means nothing. Maybe it’s just oversight or construction or some unrelated operation during this tense situation. But with the way the Board has been obstructing outside investigators, and the way the maps leave whole areas out… I can’t shake the feeling there’s something under the plant the rest of us aren't meant to see. 

Well I have to.

So here I am: sick, limping, with dead-feeling fingers, clutching an old folded map like it’s some kind of key. Maybe it is. Maybe it’s useless. But it’s something.

If I really am carrying this thing inside me, then what do I have to lose by finding out?

For now, that’s all I have. Just know I’m still here, still watching, still trying. And if you’re in Pineridge — stay away from the water.
