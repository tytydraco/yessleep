As research on quantum particles has improved, the "many worlds" theory seems to have more and more evidence. as of just a few days ago, a lab located in Saudi Arabia found something truly disturbing.

the research team was able to map different particles based on which universe it supposedly comes from. they were able to get sounds out of certain frequencies of these particles, and other information such as heat, and light, but due to restrictions a full camera couldn't be made. the researchers ran multiple experiments. first they tried running it on their own universe as a control. it was responsive, and the sound copied what was in the room. the thermometer read 19.1Â°C. the last test was the light. and it read the same as in the room. they were ready to test it on other frequencies.

some frequencies sounded exactly the same as the current room. others, sounding like a city, or meadow. some were silent. one of the silent frequencies read room temperature, but a light level of absolute zero, unlike other silent ones where there was at least a miniscule amount of light.

Everything was going well until they came to a certain frequency that some people quote "You can never unhear". It was very garbled, but it sounded like screaming, constant winds, and flames.

they were very surprised with what they heard. some thought it might be broken. they did more tests and found out that every other frequency worked differently than that one. after more testing they came to the conclusion that it was not broken, but it left another question: What was the sound they were hearing? they thought it might have been some atmospheric pressure, or a planet's center, but they were all wrong. the researchers looked at the light levels, and it flickered, it was never constant, and it was very hectic. the temperature levels fluctuated from absolute 0 kelvin to 483.15 kelvin, within a matter of seconds.

the lab published their papers, people were very confused, some tried debunking that it was something simple, but they could always be proven wrong. others frantically tried to find answers to this phenomena, but to no avail. lastly, people conspiracised that it was actually hell, or some sort of torture. even though this was brushed off, it was actually the one pointing to the most evidence, with the screaming, the temperature, the flickering. after new technology they tested more things, and it always pointed towards this.

in search for an answer they frantically tried to mock up an infrared camera, because normal photons and light would dissipate before they could be recorded, infrared signals were the only things that worked.

they recorded the new frequency and found a very grainy image, due to the fluctuation in temperature. they took several pictures and averaged them together, there was always a spot, slightly brighter in the image that was shaped like a person.

some quotes from the researchers:

"It was almost too much to look at."

"to imagine someone there, constantly bombarded with senses must be a fate worse than death"

"it's like an anti limbo, instead of absolute sensory deprivation it's just tv static and paresthesia."

the image was not released to the public, but the sound was, alongside the first paper. I must warn you that the sound is loud and disturbing and your discretion is advised, but if you wish to hear it then I have provided a small sample of the recording [HERE](https://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/1249037).

I don't know who may be there, or if they even exist, but there are some things that just shouldn't be messed with, and I think this might be one.
