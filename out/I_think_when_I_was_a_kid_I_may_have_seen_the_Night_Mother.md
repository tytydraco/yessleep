When I was a kid me and my parents would go across the border to the U.S. to go shopping. 

One time when we were in the duty free two people got into our car's rooftop cargo box, I guess hoping to get into Canada illegally.

We didn't know about it, but it worked and we drove all the way up to our cottage in northern Ontario with them inside. That's like more than a thousand kilometres. I think they passed out because we never heard any banging, and we didn't open the storage box until the morning after we got there. It wasn't until then that we saw they were in there, and they were dead.

It's still one of the scariest things that's ever happened to me, helping my dad open the box and seeing them in there like that.

We didn't know what to do and my parents didn't want to call the police. I think my dad had things in the car he didn't want the police to find, but I don't know. I was still too young to have a say.

The dead people didn't have any ID on them so we had no idea who they were, but what they did have that was super creepy was two animal skulls with horns and stuff. It was kind of like jewellery because they had it on chains around their necks, but it looked real to me. They had some weird tattoos on them too like nothing I've seen since then.

It was really remote where we were, lots of trees and not a lot of people, and my dad wanted to just leave the bodies somewhere in the woods, but my mom was afraid that would attract wild animals like bears and wolves and coyotes, so the two of them ended up spending most of the day digging holes and we buried the dead bodies in them.

It was actually really disgusting. I'd never seen a dead person before and the way they looked, almost like they were fake, it freaked me out. The way they were so still too, and they smelled even though I guess they hadn't been dead for all that long. I had this fear in the pit of my stomach that they might wake up at any moment.

I hated looking at their eyes the most, and it sounds bad but I was happy when they were buried and I didn't have to see them anymore. My mom was mad at my dad over it and over that I had to see it, but I'm not sure how else they could have done it.

Then my parents argued all night. I'm sure they thought I was asleep but I wasn't. It made me upset, and even though I know we didn't do anything to those people I felt guilty like we were the ones who killed them. I still feel it sometimes even now so much later. 

My dad was into pot a lot back then, and eventually they both started smoking it which chilled them out and they stopped fighting.

I still couldn't sleep though and at some point I went out because the pot smell was making me feel bad. It must have been early the next morning, and I saw a deer in the woods where my parents had buried the two people. It was facing away from me. I walked maybe to within fifty feet of it, then it turned and instead of a deer's face it had a woman's face, and the face was old and pale, and she had horns and was chewing and there was blood running from her mouth. I told myself I was dreaming but I knew I wasn't. I felt dead inside and terrified and I ran back inside and woke up my parents. When my dad went out to check he said there was nothing there and no signs of anything.

But what's always freaked me out the most was what I felt from whatever it was I saw. When it looked at me it didn't hate me. It felt [grateful.](https://www.reddit.com/r/normancrane)
