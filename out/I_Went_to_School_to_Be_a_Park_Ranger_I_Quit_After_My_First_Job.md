It was always my dream to be a park ranger. I loved the outdoors. The birds and bees weren’t just a metaphor for me. They were my life’s passion. So when I graduated college with a degree in wildlife management, it felt like I’d finally arrived.

But then I couldn’t get a job. I sent application after application, hoping against hope I’d stand out among the hundreds of candidates vying for a single position. 

It goes without saying that as a new grad, my resume wasn’t the most impressive of the bunch. 

That changed when I got a personalized letter, typed on a typewriter and sent through the mail. It was an invitation to a job at a small state park I’d never heard of.  My former college advisor and I had already planned to get coffee that afternoon so I excitedly brought the letter to show her. 

Her smile went flat and her eyes dark when she saw the letterhead, and after scanning the text briefly, she handed it back with a terse expression.

“Tell them no.”

I blinked rapidly in shock, completely surprised at her reaction. “But why? You know I’ve been job searching for months, and this is the first time I’ve gotten anything.”

“It doesn’t seem odd to receive an offer for a job you never applied for?” I frowned. I didn’t have a good answer.

“You were one of my best students, and you deserve a job that…,” she trailed off, then shook her head slightly before continuing, as though trying to clear her mind of a disquieting memory. Her stare was intense when she began speaking again. “It’s not a good offer. People I know say bad things have happened there. You have to trust me.” I promised I’d look into it more before deciding. 

When I got home, I checked Google and Yelp reviews. There weren’t many, which didn’t surprise me given I’d never heard of the park before, but they were all filled with enthusiastic praise. The trails were perfect. The weather was perfect. Everything was perfect. Then I reverse sorted to the most negative reviews stretching over several years. 

“My sister and her husband disappeared while hiking and no one cared.”

“My husband‘s car broke down right outside the gates. He called and told me he was going to walk to the ranger station to get help, and never came back. Why isn’t anyone talking about this?”

“This is going to sound crazy, but I swear some of the signs were changed. We only found our way back because our daughter was pretending to be Hansel & Gretel and throwing Cheerios on the trail.”

I decided to sleep on it, but if I’m honest, I already knew what I’d decided. My bank account was running on fumes. I was jobless and loans were due and I was tired of eating ramen. And most times, people who became lost or injured in a park had it happen because they weren’t paying attention - either to the weather or the trails or their own bodies. 

The next day, I called the number on the letter, and a man who sounded old enough to be my father answered. He seemed enthusiastic - if not a little surprised - when I told him I was interested in the position, and I did a short interview that felt more like a formality. 

By the end of the call, he asked when I could start. I said I could throw everything in my car and be there by Tuesday.

"That's perfect," he said, and hung up.

The drive across country was both scenic and uneventful. After months of demoralizing job applications, I felt excited again. I was going to work! In my dream field! The only shadow to my good mood was my former advisor. After emailing to say I accepted the job, she wrote back almost immediately, “Please don’t do this. Something else will come up. I’ll talk to the chair about letting you TA for me. Just don’t go.” I didn’t know what to say, so I didn’t reply.

The directions I was given brought me to what would be my new home. I had my own small cabin inside the park. Just one room really with a bed, a kitchenette, a couch, and a TV that would be right at home on Antiques Roadshow. That didn't matter. I preferred to read anyway, and it was going to take some time to get up to speed on my new park. By the door was a whistle on a thick cord with a sign that said to only blow in case of emergencies. 

I stared at it a few moments, wondering about the presence of bears, then a knock at the door brought me out of my daze. Outside were 2 men and a woman, all old enough to my parents or maybe even grandparents, with warm smiles on their faces and several tote bags full of supplies to help me get started. 

They were effusive in their welcomes, which is how I learned they were all older than my grandparents, but each looked to be in perfect health. As they helped me set up, they spoke easily about the magic of the park and how it was time to get a new generation trained. I enthusiastically agreed that nature was magical and thanked them again for hiring me.

That first night, we sat around a special welcome campfire to “officially introduce” me to the park. As I added my name to an old book of previous rangers (full names only and no nicknames, they emphasized), I felt as though I was exactly where I wanted to be.

They spent the next few weeks orienting me to my new position. I shadowed them during days and evenings and spent any free time I had reading about the area. Still, my advisor’s final words lingered. Nothing seemed weird or wrong or out of the ordinary. Why the warning to stay away?

I loved working there. There were no accidents, no crimes, and no missing persons, despite what the negative reviews said. The trails seemed to maintain themselves. We had a steady flow of visitors. Even “bad” weather days were good. I never got sick. Honestly, I'd never looked and felt healthier.

Then one late autumn night, at a team meeting over a campfire, I was told we'd spend the next few days taking down, hiding, redirecting, or otherwise changing the signs. They would be wrong for 3 days, then we’d make them right again.

"Oh this must be for some kind of maintenance, right?" I asked, guileless. 

My three fellow rangers looked at me without smiles, their faces the most serious I’d ever seen. 

"No."

"But there are people inside,” I replied, confused. “How will they find their way out?”

Silence was my answer.

I looked to each of them, expecting someone to smile, to tell me it was a prank, to give me some kind of explanation. 

“I don't get it."

"The park demands a sacrifice,” one of the rangers, a woman named Sherri intoned. 

I laughed. “You can't be serious.” 

At their continued stillness, my laugh subsided into a nervous smile, my eyes darting from face to face, waiting desperately for one of them to reveal it was a joke on the new ranger.

"Be ready at 7am,” Casey said before they all got up to leave. 

I shouted after them, “You can’t DO this! There are people in there!!!”

I don’t know what I expected. Maybe guilt or shame. Maybe one of them realizing they’d taken the joke too far. Instead, Sherri just answered without looking back, “That’s the idea.” 

I stared into the fire for a long time before finally putting it out. Human sacrifice? The parks were magical, but not that kind of magic. Right? 

Denial is a crazy thing. I think I still thought they were joking, at least until the next day.

"Keep your whistle on you,” Chip said as I followed him on the trail. “As you're changing the signs, you might see something out the corner of your eye. Don’t look at it. By now, the park knows you, but if you get turned around and truly can’t find your way back, blow your whistle.“

My stomach was twisted into knots as we spent the next few days turning signs the wrong way, hiding them in brush, or taking them down all together. I can’t explain why I just went along with it. Maybe I was in kind of a daze. Maybe I still didn’t believe it. 

Every so often we'd see hikers or campers. I opened my mouth to speak one time, and Sherri glared at me so fiercely I temporarily forgot to breathe. Then, with the sweetest voice, she sent them in the wrong direction.

Afterwards, we had one last team meeting where I was instructed to stay in my cabin for the next three days and to open the door to no one.

I drank myself into a stupor with the absinthe a friend gifted me before I left as a play on me being a “green fairy” in the park service. Despite working through a good portion of the bottle on an empty stomach, I didn't even wake up hungover. A fact that was so much more sinister now.

There was nothing of note the first two days. I’d almost started to convince myself that I must have been wrong or misheard. That this was some kind of trial period job test, maybe of my ability to follow directions. Then on the third night, so late it was almost morning, I heard screams getting louder as they approached my cabin. 

I wasn’t thinking when I opened my door. I wasn’t thinking when I shouted at the hiker to come inside. I wasn’t thinking when I left the safety of my threshold. I wasn’t thinking when I blew the whistle.

His shirt was torn and bloody, bruises and scratches on his face, and chunks of hair missing. His look of relief was heart wrenching. He ran towards me, our arms stretching towards each other, and then the forest…ate him. 

I don’t know any other way to describe it. The trees, the ground, the air…it’s like they came together in one giant maw and simply vanished him out of existence. I didn’t know what to say or think or do. I felt the forest looking at me. It was unhappy. Its warm, welcoming presence had gone ice cold. As I backed up to my cabin, I realized I’d done something very wrong. In the distance there was a rustle and the…entity simply dispersed, probably to chase new prey. 

The next day I threw everything I owned in my car and left without a word or note. And I finally texted my advisor. "Avoid the parks,” she wrote back. 

“Which ones?”

“All of them.”

I haven't set foot in or near a park since. My country has so many of them, more than you’d think, that I mostly fly now. The last time I got too close, it's like I could feel the air bending my way, see the trees and rocks reaching for me. 

But I suppose it could be worse. I’m in a support forum for these kinds of happenings now. There’s one man who has to avoid any body of water larger than a sink. He hasn’t taken a bath in years.
