It happened again. 

Last night I made a post talking about this place I went to in a dream, or at least I thought it was a dream. I ended up in a field staring up at this tower that loomed over me, there was chanting or this rhythmic thumping and then I woke up and there I was, in this field in the middle of somewhere I'd never been staring at these *two* towers I'd never seen before in my life. 

But now I don’t know what to think, I had originally thought that the melatonin gummies i took were bad or had some side effect that made hallucinate or have a nightmare or some logical explanation for this but now i'm here again in this place back where I was the other night.

I got into bed at around 12:15, I per usual couldn’t sleep and ended up just laying there staring up at my ceiling again like I always do. That's when I started to sink, it was like that feeling you get when you think you’re falling in a dream and you jolt awake grasping at anything you can to ground yourself to reality and convince yourself that you’re not falling. I tried to do that but my arms just flopped like the bones had melted and then I just sank, past the blackness of my room and down back through the deep red sky like before but this time I felt welcome, I felt invited. When I was allowed to “jolt” I felt that texture of the ground again, the rough sharp edges of what I assumed were grass trailed along my skin again, and like before I met the shadow. 

This time the sky was brighter than before, like a dawn of sorts. The most noticeable difference was the tower's sibling, the same brick work but just slightly shorter than its older taller twin. 

I stared up at them waiting as if they were going to address me but nothing. I stood up feeling the rough edges of the grass slice in between my toes, I began to walk away. Thats when i heard the groaning sound of a metal giant. No not a legit giant but what sounded like a machine groaning and screaming itself to life it sounded in pain, I turned toward the towers and watched for any sign of life from them but of course nothing. I slid my hands into my pockets and felt a familiar shape. I had to chuckle to myself at how utterly ridiculous this was that in a nightmare hell scape I had a fucking cell phone, so naturally I snapped a picture.

I made no thought of this just that it seemed like a logical thing to do, This wasn’t and couldn’t be real so when I woke up in the morning and checked my phone there would be no proof that I was here or that this place existed anywhere other than my mind, and on the very off chance that it was real well then i’d have something to show for it. I snapped a picture and the time stamp read 3:30 AM.

I am sharing this today because when I woke up and checked my phone I found a picture now its distorted and different from the one I took but nevertheless it’s the picture I took. I feel sick and I don’t know what to think about all of this. I thought maybe if a picture made it back then a video could make it back too. I don’t know, I know that's actually batshit crazy and none of this makes sense but if someone else can see that I was there and this isn’t in my head then maybe I can accept that too.
