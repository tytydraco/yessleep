The cool ocean breeze flows through me. Salt and sunscreen invade my nostrils. A deep, aching thirst overwhelms me. With every step, warm golden sand tingles against my feet. I see the glistening shine of the big blue on the horizon. I’m so damn thirsty. I collapse, letting the waves swallow me. I bend down, desperate for a single sip of the blue sea. As soon as I part my lips, I am ready to give in and accept my sin. 

I step into a dark, bitter place, the air thick with the stench of greed. I hear a peculiar sound of men squawking and the nonstop ringing of telephones. 

I rise from my cubicle, drawn to the bright lights of the “Break Room”. As I slowly march my way over, I examine my surroundings. The men huddled together, watching a man in a dark navy suit on the phone. Curious, I stop to see what has their attention.

The man grins, voice smooth, “Only $8,000? No, let’s go bigger.” Cheers erupt. Laughter. A frenzy of movement. Hands clasp. Voices rise. Obscenities cut through the air. I can’t focus. My throat is burning. The bright lights hum. The voices blur together. I crave water. 

A middle-aged blonde man, with a striking semblance to a gutter rat, approaches me, yelling. He goes in for a high five, and I regrettably indulge in this act of Neanderthals throwing their hands at each other to hear a clap. 

His hand passes through. 

Like I was never there. 

He tilts his head, clearly perplexed, and states, “What the fuck was that?”

I ignore him, tuning out the voices around me as I head for the break room. I open the door and pause at the entrance. 

The lights flicker in unison. The walls begin to collapse revealing pulsating tissue.

I inch forward and notice a clear substance in an oversized bottle, titled upside down. I feel the pain strike the back of my throat. 

The agony is becoming unbearable to withstand. Voices echo through the room. 

With every step, the tissue swells, stretching toward me, pulsing, alive. My throat is raw, my hands shake as I reach. The rubbery pink tissue devours me whole. I reach out, yanking at the jug. It spills, the cold sensation hits my feet. 

I hear a whisper, “Thirst will follow you forever.” 

I shut my eyes, drowning in thirst. My existence flashes before me. 

Everything that has led up to this point. The decades of torture and repeated disappointment echo through me. I see myself as a young, naive boy on my father’s farm. I was such an innocent soul. 

I start to remember. A woman in black. Her grip, like iron. Her rotten breath oozed out as she took a deep breath.

My eyes open wide to a view of deep red sand surrounding me. My thirst begins to overcome me again. I collapse in utter disbelief. 

Cursed, a walking corpse, I wander this planet. I have walked these lands for too long. I have witnessed every region and timeline on this planet. I’m so tired. I need my suffering to end. Trapped in this same twisted joke, again and again. 

Damned to eternity. Cursed. Always searching. Always thirsty.
