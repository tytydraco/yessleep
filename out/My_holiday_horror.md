It was when I was around 11 or 12 that my family and I took a vacation to the Spanish island of Fuerteventura. We arrived late — very late — somewhere around 10 p.m. The island was quiet, the roads nearly deserted as we made our way to the remote Airbnb we’d booked for the week. It was far from civilization, tucked away where there were no streetlights, and the signal barely worked.

When we pulled up to the house, my dad dropped us off and headed to the supermarket for supplies. My siblings and I, exhausted from the long journey, decided to settle in and watch TV. But within minutes, something strange began to happen. One by one, the lights started to flicker and then turned off completely. It was unsettling, considering the isolation of the place. The night was pitch-black outside, and our only source of light was an old, unreliable flashlight.

We sat in the dark for what felt like an eternity — about thirty minutes — until the lights suddenly came back on, just as my dad returned. We shrugged it off, convinced it was a simple power outage, and for the rest of the vacation, things seemed fairly normal. That was, until the last night.

I woke up in the middle of the night, around 2 a.m., to a faint tapping sound. It began as a distant noise, but it gradually grew louder, more insistent, as if something or someone was getting closer. I shared a room with my younger sister, who was only 7 or 8 at the time. The tapping seemed to affect her too, as she started crying softly, which woke up our parents.

They rushed in to check on us, but as soon as they stepped into the room, the sound stopped. They assumed we were imagining things, so they went back to their room. Still shaken, I tried to drift back to sleep, but the unease lingered. Then, at 4 a.m., my sister woke me again, whispering that she had heard someone laughing outside. Terrified, she asked me to check.

I looked out the window, my heart racing in my chest, and what I saw made my blood run cold.

Standing on the driveway, barely visible in the moonlight, was a figure. It was tall — about six feet — and though it appeared human at first glance, something about it was... wrong. Its features were blurred, distorted, as if it wasn’t quite human. It stood there, motionless, staring at the house with empty, black eyes.

I froze, my mind racing for an explanation, but there was none. It felt like hours, though I think I only stood there for about ten minutes, watching the figure in the dark. And then, it looked up, its gaze locking with mine, and I swear, in that moment, I felt like it could see into my very soul.

Panic flooded me. I ran to my parents’ room, heart pounding, and told them what I had seen. They came to our room, looked outside the window, but by then, the figure was gone. Just like that.

They dismissed it as a product of an overactive imagination, but I know what I saw. Something — or someone — was out there. The image of that creature, those dark, empty eyes, still haunts me. Even now, I can’t bring myself to look out of my window at night. The memory lingers, a shadow that refuses to fade.

I used to tell myself that writing this down would somehow make it less real, but if anything, it has only made it more vivid. The terror hasn’t left me, not really. It’s still there, just beneath the surface, every time I close my eyes.
