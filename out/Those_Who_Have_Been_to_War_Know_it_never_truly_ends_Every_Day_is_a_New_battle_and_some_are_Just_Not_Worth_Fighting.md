I’m going to tell this the way it comes back to me now, not the way I would have told it when I still believed in clean narratives. By no means is this closure; this is merely a confession that means nothing. Now and again, the silence digs a little too deep, and I am forced to speak, regardless of whether anyone is listening.

I’m sixty-three years old. I live alone. I attend church when I can stand the hymns. I’ve raised children and buried them. I have worn a uniform for a war that never deserved to have a proper name, just years of sand, checkpoints, prayers whispered into dust, and orders that learned to contradict themselves.

I was raised in a closed religious community. That matters. Not because I’m looking for absolution, but because it trained me to see desire as a threat that lived inside the body, especially when it refused to point in the approved direction. Men were supposed to be disciplined. Women were supposed to be orderly. Anything else was corruption, and corruption always came from *somewhere else*.

After I was discharged, officially, the war had ended for me. Only on paper it did, because only the dead are free to leave the battlefield. I ended up in a place like a lot of places former soldiers end up: a half-rural town where nobody asks too many questions as long as you don’t ask them back. Veterans everywhere. Different units, different wars, same posture in the shoulders. Same eyes. Same every day. A new battle, a new trench to be crossed in no man’s land with no ending in sight.

We drank together. We sat too close together without acknowledging it. War teaches you how to tolerate proximity without intimacy, which is its own kind of sickness.

Men started disappearing.

At first, it was written off as relapse. Suicide. Leaving town. Then one was found just beyond the treeline near an old irrigation ditch. No blood. No knife wounds. No struggle anyone wanted to describe.

His clothes were wrong on him; shifted, disturbed. His body wasn’t broken so much as *compressed*. His face looked calm in a way that made my stomach turn.

People don’t talk about that kind of calm. They should.

The town needed an explanation. It always does.

They found it in a woman named Queer Marta, though that wasn’t her name, just what people called her once they decided she wasn’t safe. She lived alone, practiced herbal medicine, didn’t belong to any church, and spoke to men without lowering her eyes. She also treated some of the guys for nightmares, pain, and impotence. That sealed it.

Witch isn’t a word people use anymore. But they still know how to mean it.

The accusation spread through prayer circles, Facebook groups, and whispered testimony. Spiritual warfare. Corruption. Seduction. The language was new. The logic was ancient.

I didn’t defend her.

That’s something I need to be clear about.

I am too weak to engage in another battle, especially if it isn’t my own.

The night before they dragged her into a so-called intervention, I was drinking at the VFW hall when I heard my name spoken the way it used to be spoken under incoming fire.

“Aron.”

I turned and saw Elias.

He looked wrong in civilian clothes, like he was wearing a disguise he didn’t respect. We’d served together years earlier. Same unit. Same bunk once. Same night in a forward operating base, when the mortars came down too close, and grabbed my wrist and didn’t let go. I hadn’t pulled away. I’d pretended it didn’t mean anything.

The next morning, he’d requested a transfer.

“I heard you settled here,” he said.

“I heard you were dead,” I answered.

“I was,” he said, and smiled like it hurt.

We walked outside. The night was too quiet. That kind of quiet that listens back.

“You know about the men,” he said.

“Yes.”

“They’re blaming someone else.”

“Yes.”

“They always do.”

There was something off about the air. Static without electricity.

“I don’t want to hurt anyone anymore,” Elias said.

My chest tightened. “What are you talking about?”

He laughed, low and bitter. “I’m talking about what happens when you spend your life pretending the worst part of you doesn’t exist.”

The howl came then.

I don’t mean metaphorically. I mean a sound rose out of the trees that didn’t belong to anything the wildlife department would recognize. It had cadence. Control. Grief.

Elias doubled over.

“Go,” he said. “If you stay, I won’t be able to stop.”

I stayed.

What happened next wasn’t sudden. It was intimate. His body bent inward like it was finally obeying a truth it had resisted. His face changed, not explosively, but *patiently*. Like something unfolding that had waited a long time for permission.

I didn’t see a monster.

I saw a conclusion.

It ran into the trees.

The next morning, another man was gone.

They found signs near the old irrigation ditch, discarded clothing, scuffed ground, impressions that suggested kneeling, grasping, proximity that had gone on too long to be accidental.

That was enough.

They brought Marta out in front of the church with cameras and scripture and righteous fury. She didn’t scream. She didn’t confess. She looked at me once, and I understood she knew exactly what kind of man I was.

That night, as the crowd closed in and words turned into violence, because the human heart is a cemetery filled with sorrow and pain, and a broken heart is so full of darkness that even the dead return to reign over the living. In the midst of this zealous passion, the howl returned.

It burst from the trees, and chaos followed. The thing went straight for the loudest voices, the men who had been quickest to testify. It took them without spectacle. Without blood.

Marta died anyway.

Fire still works the same way it always has.

At dawn, I found Elias again, human, shaking, bruised.

“They wanted it,” he said quietly. “Not death. That came later.”

“You’d be surprised what comforts men are willing to offer when the choice is between desire and teeth,” he lamented with a glint of disgust in his exhausted stare.

I asked him why he spared me.

“Because you never pretended you were righteous,” he said. “Only obedient.”

At that moment, something primal, almost bestial, snarled inside my head. A violent and lusting flame. It was familiar and bitterly hated. The war gave birth to this inside of me.

My vision narrowed into a tunnel as I dug my nails into my palms.

I shook with anger, hating just how right Elias had to be in that moment.

Hating myself...

The sparkle of hope in his otherwise dead eyes told me Elias wanted this; he yearned for me to become just like him.

In that moment, I knew he was no longer the man I *let* myself love.

I left him there.

*Alone.*

Deprived of what little hope he might have had.

Turned my back and walked away.

I left town soon after.

Years passed. I married. I tried to build the kind of life my faith told me would fix me. Wife. Kids. Sunday dinners. I learned how to smile in photos.

For a while, it worked.

Then one night, I came home late.

The house was quiet in a way that felt deliberate.

My wife. My children. No struggle. No frenzy. Just bodies arranged with care, as if whoever did it had wanted to remember loving them.

I didn’t scream.

When the sound finally came, it wasn’t human at first. It tore out of me raw and rising, a hoarse, lupine howl that shocked me with its familiarity, then broke apart into sobbing once my throat remembered what it was and what it was not.

I found the footprints in the snow at dawn. Bare. Human. Leading into the trees.

Elias waited there.

“I didn’t mean to,” he said. “I came to see you. To prove I could leave it behind. But seeing what you had... What I never could... It broke something.”

“I’m sorry,” he said, knowing it meant nothing.

The howl rose in him again, and he ran.

I didn’t follow.

I couldn’t.

Even if I could, there was no point in following him.

Elias took everything I had.

Hunting the beast would only serve to offer it what little human in me I still have.

I live alone now. I still believe some of the things I was taught. I still mistrust my own body. I still don’t know how to forgive myself for choosing obedience over mercy.

Men still vanish sometimes.

The world still blames the innocents.

And the war... Whatever name the outside world gave it, it never really ended.

It just learned how to live inside us.
