The first time I heard the lullaby, it was a whisper on the wind, a tune so haunting it sent shivers down my spine. I was standing outside the infamous Hollowbrook Inn, a place that even the bravest locals avoided. As a journalist with a penchant for the paranormal, I couldn't resist the allure of the inn's dark legends. I decided to spend a night inside, hoping to debunk the myths or, at the very least, get a thrilling story out of it.


The inn, nestled between two imposing mountains, had been abandoned for decades. Its once grand facade was now covered in ivy, and its windows were shattered, giving it an eerie, skeletal appearance. As I pushed open the creaky front door, a cold gust of wind rushed past, as if the building itself was exhaling.


Inside, the air was thick with dust and the scent of old wood. I began my exploration in the main hall, where a grand chandelier, now tarnished and draped in cobwebs, hung precariously from the ceiling. The walls were adorned with faded portraits of people who seemed to watch my every move.


Hours passed with nothing out of the ordinary. Just as I was beginning to feel disappointed, the soft strains of a lullaby echoed through the corridors. I followed the sound, my heart pounding, and found myself in front of a room with a slightly ajar door. Pushing it open, I was met with an unsettling sight: a vintage crib, rocking on its own, with an old porcelain doll inside, clutching a rusted music box.


Intrigued, I recorded the music. But upon playback, I heard a voice, soft and melancholic, whispering, "Stay with me." The doll's hollow eyes seemed to bore into my soul. I felt a mix of fear and pity. Was this the spirit of a child, forever trapped within the doll?


Determined to uncover the truth, I set up camp in the main hall. As midnight approached, the temperature dropped, and the lullaby grew louder and more insistent. I tried to shake off the unease, but then I felt a cold hand caress my face. I jolted awake to find the porcelain doll beside me, its music box playing that haunting tune.


Panic set in. I tried to flee, but every exit was sealed. The lullaby grew deafening, and the air grew colder. Desperation took over, and I addressed the doll, "If there's a spirit here, I promise to help you find peace. Just let me go."
The music stopped abruptly. The doll's eyes glowed, and a soft voice whispered, "Promise?"
I nodded, tears streaming down my face. "I promise."


Suddenly, the oppressive atmosphere lifted. The doors unlocked, and I rushed out, gasping for breath. As dawn broke, I returned with a local priest. Together, we performed a ritual to free the trapped spirit. The doll was later placed in a glass case in the town's museum, a silent testament to Hollowbrook's haunted past.


My story became legendary in Hollowbrook. But every night, as I drift to sleep, I hear the faint echo of the lullaby, a haunting reminder of the promise I made.


Weeks after the ritual, the lullaby's haunting melody began to invade my dreams, growing louder each night. It was as if the tune had embedded itself in the very fabric of my being. Desperate for answers, I decided to visit the museum where the doll was displayed.
The museum was a grand old building, its walls lined with artifacts from Hollowbrook's past. As I approached the doll's display, I felt a chill in the air. The porcelain figure sat encased in glass, its hollow eyes seemingly fixed on me. The room was silent, save for the faint strains of that all-too-familiar lullaby.


Suddenly, the lights dimmed, and the room was plunged into darkness. Panic surged through me. I fumbled for my flashlight, its beam cutting through the inky blackness. To my horror, the glass case was empty. The doll was gone.
A soft giggle echoed through the room, sending shivers down my spine. "You promised to help me," a voice whispered, the sound coming from all directions.


I tried to respond, to reason with the spirit, but my voice caught in my throat. "I did help you," I finally managed to stammer out. "I freed you with the ritual."


The giggling ceased, replaced by a mournful sigh. "You freed my spirit, but you didn't understand my true desire. I didn't want freedom. I wanted companionship."


The realization hit me like a ton of bricks. In my quest for a story, I had misunderstood the spirit's plea. It didn't want to be released; it wanted to be understood, to be loved.


The room grew colder, and I felt an invisible force pulling me towards the empty glass case. I resisted, but it was too strong. The last thing I remember was the feeling of cold glass against my skin and the lullaby growing louder in my ears.
When I awoke, I was no longer in the museum. I was back at the Hollowbrook Inn, lying in the vintage crib. Only having my phone as a belonging. The room was dimly lit, and the lullaby played softly in the background. I tried to move, but my limbs felt heavy and unresponsive. Glancing down, I saw porcelain hands and a delicate lace dress. I had become a physical ghost unable to leave the inn, a forever companion for the lonely spirit.


Days turned into weeks, and weeks into months. Visitors to the inn would occasionally hear the echoing lullaby and catch a glimpse of the porcelain doll in the crib, forever bound by a promise.
