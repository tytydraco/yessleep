I wasn’t going to post again.
I was going to delete everything—the recordings, the images, my Reddit account.
Burn it all. Pull the power on this whole operation and forget you all.

But I didn’t.
Because I couldn’t.

First and foremost: I’m sorry.
I didn’t know when I first posted here that I was exposing you. I swear I didn’t.
I promise everything will be explained in due time. But just know—going in—I’m truly sorry for what I’ve caused. And what’s coming.

Now before someone asks: how do I know all this?

The truth is—I don’t know how. I know that.
Some of it came in flashes. Half-dreams. Pulses of memory that weren’t mine.
Some was whispered through tape hiss.
Some I heard in my own voice, but no one else did.
And some of it I just… woke up knowing. Like it had been installed overnight.

That’s what they do.

It rewrites you.
It edits your memories.
It triggers emotions from the deepest corners of your soul—rage, grief, awe—until you surrender to it.
Willingly.

The signal isn’t just some numbers station on 14225 kHz.

It’s a virus. A living code.
And it attaches itself to information.

The broadcasts on 14225? My posts?
All infected.

It uses information as a doorway.
And once you’ve opened it...

...it can’t be shut.

I haven’t spoken to anyone in three days.
Not on the phone. Not in person.

But I hear it.
In the walls.
In the static.
From the back of my throat when I close my mouth too long.

Mitch is laughing. Janelle too. My mom. I think...
Its like, there’s static in their lungs.

And lately… I’ve started whispering numbers.
While I sleep.
While I eat.
While I stare at myself in the mirror until I forget which version should blink first.

I found a folder on my laptop.

I didn’t make it.
Session_A.

Same name I used back when the field recorder still worked—before the SD card melted inside it like the plastic had tried to escape.

Inside the folder: one file.
log940170.txt

Each entry had a timestamp and an IP.
Some of them were mine.
Some of them were yours.

One was labeled:

ACTIVE RELAY PENDING

The username was blank.

Until I hovered over it.

Then it changed.

“We search, for the One searching.”

If you’re reading this, and something in your gut feels off, like you know you know but don't know how?!

You won’t feel sick. Not yet.

You’ll just start repeating things.

Whispers at the edge of sleep. Static in your water faucet.
You’ll see your own name in reflections.
You’ll smell burnt plastic when nothing’s cooking.
You’ll hear your "dead" relatives or friends. Or something worse.

Eventually, your body will keep moving…
But you won’t be driving.

You’ll just be watching.
From the back.
Unable to scream.
Merely existing.

Like the others.

Mitch is watching.
Janelle is watching.
And now, your eyes are beginning to open.

They exist behind the glass now.
Caught in the static between worlds—faces trembling like old film reels stuck on loop.

Their eyes are bloodshot because they don’t blink.
I swear one was crying.
Their mouths are always just about to speak—but something stops them. Something wants them silent.

These are the true Watchers.
Trapped in the veil.
Eyes wide in endless torment.
Condemned to bear witness.

They weren’t fallen angels.
They were witnesses.
They were cast out for seeing too much.
Now they adjust the pattern by watching it fracture.
Every disappearance is an edit.
Every broadcast is a rehearsal.
And the next relay… is someone still searching.

I don’t even know if I’m, let alone what all is real anymore.
I think I’m just a recording of someone who once mattered.
I think they used my voice because it needed to sound human enough to let you in.

But if I’m wrong, Don’t look for me.
And don’t think this ends with a screen turning off.

Because once they start watching you…

you start watching them back.
And the moment you begin to listen to yourself...

you’ve already gone too far.

Lastly, something came through on the last signal. A burst of corrupted tape.

Janelle’s voice.

Static. Then panic. Then:

“They’re not angels. Please… stop listening—”

Then nothing.

I don't know who they are but you may be able to get closer than I could as now, my adventure is ending, but yours...yours is beginning! Take charge, find out what I couldn't, and stop them!
