[PART ONE ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mcp3eb/theres_a_man_in_the_woods_who_walks_on_all_fours/)| [TWO](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mg2pc6/theres_a_man_in_the_woods_who_walks_on_all_fours/)

He stalked forward—not toward me, but toward the boy, who was scrambling up the riverbank. The creature stank like decay. I stumbled after it, unslinging my rifle. My vision swam like a watercolor painting, and lining up a shot felt like it might as well be impossible. 

So I closed my eyes. 

Listened. Felt the vibrations in the stones. The way the monster shook the earth with its every step. The way it gasped and wheezed with each aching breath. 

My finger squeezed the trigger. 

Thunder broke the night. The bullet sang, ricocheting off the back of the monster—off that draping mess that must have been its coat of skin. 

The Brittle Man halted. 

My breath caught in my chest. I told myself to move, to do something, and so I started loading another rifle round when the boy hollered, voice tight with terror. ‘Forget the gun, dude! Get to the freaking lighthouse. We’re dead meat out here!’

Cursing, I tossed the rifle back over my shoulder. 

Move.

I bolted, feet carving a path toward the cave. A bleating roar rang out, followed by an anguished chorus of grunts as the Brittle Man galloped after me. 

My heart pounded like a funeral dirge. 

I doubled over, sprinting harder, faster than I’d ever moved in my life, but still the monster was faster. It shook the stoney shore. As it closed in, I felt my balance slipping, my boots sliding this way and that against the stones, threatening to fall out from under me completely when I ducked, rolling into the mouth of the cave while the Brittle Man’s curled fingernails snatched at air mere inches away. 

It couldn’t fit inside. 

Apparently, I had a guardian angel. 

The boy hollered something to me from the other end of the cave, but I couldn’t hear it over the pulse rushing in my ears. A single thought regurgitated itself in my head, over and over. Keeping moving. Don’t die. 

And so I scrambled, back hunched, head smashing off the ceiling of the tunnel but not stopping to care. Blood trickled in my eyes. It didn’t matter. All that mattered was the titan thundering overhead, the monster the size of a pick-up truck that was convinced I’d make a good addition to its coat of flayed faces. 

Out of the cave. Into the copse of trees. 

An awful crack stole through the night, the goliath leaping onto one of those needle-thin pines. It thundered toward the earth, crashing just feet behind me but the Brittle Man had already leaped to the next, and the next after that. I heard him, that click-clack of his fingernails racing above, waiting for the opportunity to pounce down on me. 

‘Almost there!’ called the boy, charging from the trees ahead of me. ‘The lighthouse is just over the hill!’

And it was.

I could see it, that shambling tower, reaching up beyond that hill of crackling grass, stiff and dead beneath my boots. I chased after the boy, lungs lit ablaze, thoughts numbed by the life-or-death kiss of adrenaline in my veins. 

Nearly there. Just a little further.

There—the girl. She stood just beyond the lip of the hill, arms splayed wide in the doorframe of the lighthouse. Eyes bulging with panic. With fear. 

‘Behind you!’ she shrieked. 

I felt it half a second later: the ground rippling beneath my feet like a tidal wave consuming the shore. The disorienting scatter of earth raining down around me, like a meteor had fallen from the sky and carved a new valley in the dirt. 

The Brittle Man. 

He’d leapt from the trees, and he was already on top of me. 

I saw the shadow of his arm, long and crooked, rising up behind me. His rake-like fingers. Those curled, serrated nails like rusted knives. It swiped—wind kissed my cheek.

A miss.

‘Arrrggh!’ I charged forward, faster and faster. My legs felt like lead bricks but I couldn’t let up, neither my heart or my body would let me. Slowing down even a fraction meant certain death. 

No, somehow I needed to dig deeper. Move faster.

And so I tried, throat like a desert, lungs searing themselves to ash. The boy reached the doorway ahead. He waved at me, desperate beside the girl. They spoke. They shouted. Words, maybe. I don’t know because by that point my mind had crashed, every iota of energy rerouted toward speed—toward survival. 

But the Brittle Man was gaining. 

The shadow of its arm rose again. Closer this time. It slashed, and this time I heard the scratch of torn fabric, felt the razor-blade sear of my flesh peeling open, the warm dribble of blood rippling down my spine. 

‘HURRY!’

***CLICK-CLACK.CLICK-CLACK.***

***CLICK-CLACK.CLICK-CLACK.***

***CLICK-CLACK.CLICK-CLACK.***

The monster was like some fell wind, inescapable, more force of nature than physical being. Its every breath came thick with cosmic hunger. Ancient. Unyielding. Breath blasted my neck, hot and putrid. 

The Brittle Man was close now. Too close to escape. 

Its arm rose again, an executioner ready to swing its blade. And this time it wouldn’t miss. After all these years, my childhood nightmare had finally caught up to me. I should’ve figured you could only outrun your demons for so long. 

The arm came down like a guillotine.

I lunged.

The lighthouse door slammed shut at my back. The Brittle Man crashed against it like a freight-train, the entire structure trembling with all the force of a magnitude seven earthquake. 

I tried to breath, tried to catch my breath as I lay on that floor, world spinning from exhaustion, but it was like I’d forgotten how. Instead I just lay there, red in the face, jaw slack, gazing up at a steel stairwheel winding forever and ever above me. 

‘You sure it’ll hold?’ 

The boy. 

‘Of course,’ said the girl, though her tone said anything but confident. ‘It was built to contain something a lot worse, wasn’t it?’

Footsteps. Soft. A pitter-patter of sneakers, then a face swimming into view. 

‘You good?’ asked the boy, gently smacking my cheeks. 

‘Let him catch his breath,’ said the girl. ‘He isn’t like us. He can’t just go forever.’

The boy sighed, squatting beside me. ‘Good stuff, man. Totally thought you were a goner back there. That last dive? You could’ve killed it in major league baseball.’ He laughed, imitating an umpire watching somebody steal home base. ‘AND HE’S SAAAAAFE!’

‘Would you shut up?’ snapped the girl. ‘I’m trying to think.’

He scowled her direction, sticking out his tongue. 

I groaned, finally wrenching myself into a sitting position. My vision settled. For the first time, I got a clear look at where we were, and it didn’t look anything like the lair of some unholy monster. It looked…

Normal. 

It would’ve passed for a pretty nice bachelor pad, if it wasn’t for all the beer cans scattered across the floor. Then again, I was hardly in a position to judge. The lighthouse had an old fridge that hugged the wall, and beside that was a gas stove. Posters plastered every spare surface. Classic cars, mostly. Camaros. Chevelles.

‘The Brittle Man’s got decent taste in vehicles,’ I muttered, using a chair to push myself to my feet. ‘And beer. This table seems a little small for a twelve foot nightmare, though. Same with that cot under the stairs.’

The boy laughed.

The girl’s eye twitched, impatient or stressed. ‘This used to belong to the Groundskeeper. Then the Brittle Man took it over.’

‘Right,’ I said. ‘So where’s the heart?’

Her eyes traveled upward, tracing the scrapmetal ring of steps that wound its way to the very apex of the lighthouse. ‘Up there,’ she said. ‘We saw it earlier.’

‘We did?’

She nodded. ‘The flame without a glow. That’s the Brittle Man’s heart. His real one.’

I felt a wave of defeat wash over me. I’d already turned my legs into jelly, and I wasn’t sure I could make it another dozen feet, let alone summit what amounted to a mountain in the shape of a lighthouse. 

The boy cracked the fridge. ‘Here,’ he said, grabbing a lonely beer off the shelf. ‘Some fuel for the trip. You can thank me when you free my soul.’

He winked, dropping the beer on the table in front of me. 

I lifted it up. It looked familiar, too familiar. It was my favorite brand, a micro-brew local to my hometown called Blue Buck. ‘Hold on,’ I muttered, lifting it for a closer look. ‘There’s something scribbled on it.’

Across the label were words in thick, black sharpie. It said ‘ONE FOR THE END.’

‘Guess the Groundskeeper expected he was doomed,’ said the boy with a jovial shrug. ‘Oh well. It’s yours now. It’s probably the last edible thing in this place now that the Garden’s shriveled up.’

‘There you go again,’ I said, turning to him. ‘You called it a Garden.’

He bit his lip, glancing at the girl like he’d just been caught pilfering the cookie jar. The girl clawed an exasperated hand through her hair. 

‘Why?’ I said, more forcefully this time. 

‘Because it was a Garden,’ said the girl, though she did not sound pleased to be revealing that. ‘A long time ago. Back before that thing at the top of the lighthouse corrupted it.’

‘That thing,’ I said, narrowing my eyes. ‘You called it the Brittle Man’s heart. Or was that another lie?’

‘None of this was a lie!’ she snapped. ‘It’s just a lot to put on somebody. No, the cold flame at the top is a much the heart of the Brittle Man as it is the heart of the Crooked Wood. It infected this place, back when it was beautiful. And it infected *him*, too.’

The lighthouse shook—the Brittle Man hammering against the walls. It seemed they might have hidden the doorway from him, but he wasn’t giving up without a fight. 

‘He wasn’t always the monster he is now,’ whispered the girl, wincing as dust drifted down around us. ‘Once, he was, well… majestic, in a terrifying way. He had ashen wings, like a dove. And carried a flaming sword. He was the guardian of this place, back when it was beautiful.’

The monster gave an anguished shriek outside. 

‘So what the hell happened?’ I asked. 

‘The Beast,’ said the boy. 

I turned to him, glaring. ‘You told me the Brittle Man was the Beast.’

‘He is,’ said the girl with a groan of frustration. ‘Don’t you get it? This whole palace is. The Beast is inside all of it—like some kind of divine parasite, or cosmic virus. It’s infected the Garden. It’s turned the trees crooked and the air cold. It’s a blanket of evil suffocating all the good it touches, the Brittle Man included.’

Another crash against the walls. Then another. 

‘So,’ I said, folding my arms. ‘All the children hanging from those trees, with stuffed animals stitched onto their necks. All those heads in those bags you made…’ My hand shot to my mouth. I retched. ‘Was that the Beast? The Brittle Man? Both?’

The children exchanged a look.

‘It wasn’t either of them,’ said the boy. 

The girl sucked back a shuddering breath. ‘It was the Groundskeeper.’

‘What? The guy that watched over this place? He was a psychopath?’

‘He hung those children to save the garden,’ the girl snapped, suddenly defensive. ‘He did it to keep the Beast from breaking free—because the man with no shadow left us all to die.’

A man with no shadow. 

The Stranger. 

‘This man…’ I said slowly. ‘Did he have a mouth full of thorns?’

‘And a tophat that covered his eyes,’ muttered the girl. ‘Yes. He’s exactly the person, or creature, you're thinking of. To be honest, none of us know what he is. Not fully. All we know is he brought us here after we died. He told us we’d earned our place in paradise, but that was a fucking lie.’

The boy gave a weak chuckle. ‘Surprise. We all chose to come here. Can you believe that?’

I snatched the beer can from the table, took a swig that lasted forever, but somehow wasn’t long enough. The can crumpled in my grip. I tossed it to the floor with the other empties. 

Why was all of this feeling uncomfortably familiar?

‘So you’re telling me you weren’t kidnapped? The Brittle Man didn’t abduct you?’ I said. 

The girl shook her head. ‘All those children hanging from the trees? We were already dead. Me, from pneumonia. Him,’ she said, nodding to the boy across the table, ‘from a car accident. The Stranger offered us a chance to live eternally in his Garden, and we took it.’

My head spun. 

Questions. There were about a trillion of them battering around inside my mind. 

Why were the kids’ corpses hanging with stuffed animals stitched onto their necks? 

Why were their heads used as wards, to protect this impossible lighthouse?

Why did the Stranger lie to them?

And what the hell was the Beast?

But before I could give voice to any of them, the lighthouse screamed. The Brittle Man stampeded against the outer wall. Harder. More desperate. The criss-crossed boards bulged, threatening to snap completely as a crack spidered across them. Nails burst free. They rained down on us like a deluge of rust. 

The Brittle Man was breaking in. 

‘I think you might’ve oversold how sturdy this lighthouse was,’ I said, lurching to my feet. ‘That wall isn’t holding. We’ve gotta move. You said the Beast is at the top?’

The girl gulped down, eyes widening as she followed the fissure forming before us. ‘That’s right,. It’s the heart of this nightmare. We kill it, and everything ends. The Brittle Man included.’

I adjusted my rifle on my shoulder, gathering my courage. ‘Then let’s go hunting.’

We shot up the spiraling stairwell. It was a tangle of warped scrapmetal, as bent and strange as the rest of the lighthouse. We took the steps two at a time. Three, even. We ran like our lives depended on it—because they did—and all the while the wall weakened, crumbling under the Brittle Man’s assault. 

I told myself not to look.

I told myself it’d be easier if I focused on the path ahead, on the looping steps that seemed to ascend toward heaven itself. But then my head began to spin. My ears ringing with old memories, the sort that wouldn’t stay down. That demanded their time in the sun. 

I told myself no, that it wasn’t the time or place to be taking a stroll down memory lane, that I had a Beast to put down and the souls of countless children to save, but I was overruled. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I fell.

Away from myself. Away from time.

My body kept running, kept sprinting, but it was like I wasn’t there. My consciousness had sunk into the mire of my trauma, and when I opened my eyes I found myself back in that place I’d tried a whole lifetime to forget: the Crooked Wood.

The very last place I saw Charlie alive. 

Click-clack. That’s the sound those fingernails made. And the breathing came fast then slow, uneven and tormented like a butchered sow. I recall telling Charlie that something was wrong. That I felt like we weren’t alone in the woods anymore—that there was a monster up there, watching us from the trees. 

But he just smiled, told me that he knew all of that already. That this is what he’d wanted. 

And I remember wondering why my best friend wanted to die. 

‘I was supposed to die,’ he told me. ‘Back when I got really sick. You were there for me every day, with soup and all my favorite board games, but even then I knew I wasn’t supposed to make it.’

I shook my head, confused. I didn’t know what he was talking about, but it was making my chest tight with heartache and dread.

‘But I survived, didn’t I?’ he said. ‘Somehow. Looking back, it almost felt like a miracle. Now I think maybe it was.’

He laughed.

‘For a long time, I wondered if mom had cut a deal with the devil. Now I know she didn’t.’ 

‘I don’t understand,’ I told him, wincing at the sound of the approaching monster. 

‘It was him,’ said Charlie, pointing behind us, through that mire of trees. ‘The Stranger. That’s who mom spoke to. Only I never realized it until I saw the drawing the Stranger made me. He’s the one that cured me, that gave me another five years of life. Mom didn’t make it. The disease took her, but she never had to bury me either.’

He nodded, as though satisfied. ‘It was a good deal she made, I think. Especially since now I get to protect everybody—you included.’

He was talking crazy. 

It was like the sketch the Stranger showed him scrambled his brains. 

‘Don’t do this,’ I whispered. ‘C’mon, man. Let’s get outta here.’

***Click-clack.***

***Click-clack.***

The fingernails neared, twigs snapping, leaves shifting as something creaked down the side of a tree—slowly—like it had all the time in the world. 

‘But what’d you think?’ Charlie asked, shoving his hands in his pockets. ‘You think the Stranger was the devil?’

‘I don’t know,’ I sputtered. ‘He was weird.’

‘Angels would be weird, too, I’d bet. So would God.’

Yeah, this whole situation was fucking weird. I wasn’t really in the mood to sit there and meditate on the nature of some man in the woods with a mouth full of thorns, doubly so when something decidedly inhuman was clacking toward us spelling of spoiled flesh, like it had pieces of other children caught in its teeth. 

I grabbed his arm, yanking for him to follow me. He stayed rooted in place. 

‘I’m not going anywhere,’ he told me. ‘But you should leave. Right now.’

I stared at him, eyes wide with disbelief as he unslung his backpack, fishing inside for an old stuffed rabbit his mother had sewn him. ‘You want me to leave you?’ I stammered.

‘Yeah.’

‘Why?’

‘Cause it’ll be better you don’t see this. Trust me.’

I never got the chance to ask him what he meant. At that moment, a shadow stretched over me, long and decrepit. It rose up on legs more crooked than branches. I couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe. Fear had stolen the blood from my veins. 

All I could do was stand shivering, watching as a gnarled arm reached across me, its curled fingernails plucking Charlie by the collar of his sweater. It lifted him into the air, wheezing like a dying animal. 

‘I’ll miss you,’ he told me, voice breaking. ‘A whole bunch, okay? Don’t forget it.’

There it was again, that smile, only now it was carved with grief. The way he was talking was like he was already dead, and all this was just some formality before his passport got stamped. 

But I wouldn’t accept it. 

I shouted, demanded that monster drop my friend. I beat my fists against those lampost legs, scratched and clawed and bit at its mottled skin, but nothing made a difference. The creature rumbled forward. It stalked through a copse of undergrowth too thick for me to follow, and as I screamed and cried for it to stop, it vanished into the dark of the crooked wood, carrying the only person I had left in the entire world. 

I was alone.

Always, I ended up alone. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

A deafening crash shattered my reverie. 

Far below, the lighthouse wall finally gave in, bursting apart in an explosion that suffocated the bottom floor in a rising cloud of dust. 

My heart slammed. 

Shit. 

Boards clattered. Nails rained. Footfalls, heavy and inhuman, thudded through the gaping void, a silhouette of a monster appearing in the haze of debris. It reared back a head with two floppy ears, then screeched.

‘Ignore him,’ shouted the girl from ahead. ‘We’re almost there!’

I looked up, and she was right. 

The top of the lighthouse was closer than the bottom, close enough that maybe, just maybe…

‘We can make it,’ I agreed, teeth clenched. 

A shriek of warping steel rang out, and I didn’t need to look to know the Brittle Man’s long fingers had wrapped around railing of the steps. He was climbing after us. No—worse. He was leaping. The lighthouse shuddered as the behemoth crashed from side to side, throwing itself up the collapsing stairwell, rising like a tornado of stolen flesh. 

I charged, my lungs feeling like somebody had taken a welding torch to them. The boy kept pace with me, urging me forward, while the girl led the way.

My thoughts raced. They were moving nearly as fast as my pulse.  Now wasn’t the time to be fishing for answers, not even close, but with how quickly the Brittle Man was gaining, I was starting to become convinced there might not another opportunity. 

And I had to know. 

‘Those dead kids,’ I said to the boy, breathless, as we scrambled up the steps. ‘What did the Stranger need with a bunch of hanging corpses?’

He bit his lip. It was like he wasn’t sure he was allowed to say this much, but the girl was so far ahead he knew she wouldn’t hear. ‘We’re fuel,’ he told me. ‘Batteries.’

I stumbled, nearly face-planting on a step, but I caught myself. The boy’s hand wrenched me forward. ‘Come again?’ I stammered. 

‘The Garden uses us,’ he explained. ‘Our innocence. Our purity. You know, stuff children have that sad old adults have forgotten how to tap into. That’s why the bodies are hanging from the trees—they’re helping to contain the Beast. Each one of em sits above a leyline. And all those leylines?’

‘Run into this place. The lighthouse.’

He nodded.

I almost hated how casual he was about it, talking about this nightmare like it had some sort of larger purpose, a greater meaning. But how could it? A monster tore off my best friend’s head. It sewed his mother’s stuffed rabbit in its place. There wasn’t any justification for that. 

There never could be. It made me sick to my stomach. It made me want to find the Stranger and throttle him until his eyes burst, and the Groundskeeper too, if he hadn’t already gone and got himself killed.

‘We made it!’

The girl’s voice stole my attention. There, right above her was a sight I wasn’t sure I’d ever get to fully appreciate—the ceiling of the lighthouse. 

And set within it, a rusted metal hatch. 

I could hardly believe it. We’d done it. We’d scaled the entire lighthouse, spun ourselves up a small mountain of stairs and made it to the hatch. We’d escaped the—

A black meteor crashed in front of me, throwing me backward with the impact. I hit the wall. Blood burst from my lips in a hematomic cough. I forced myself back to my feet, legs quivering with terror and ache. A great shadow rose up in front of me. 

The Brittle Man. 

He’d caught us. After all that effort, all that pain, he’d taken a handful of leaps up the damn lighthouse and cut us off. But that wasn’t the worst part. No, what was turned my stomach was the fact that I could see the monster clearly. No cloud of dust. No swimming vision. 

Just me and my childhood boogeyman. 

His colossal frame flickered in the lamplight, bent over on all fours, limbs crooked and rail-thin. A coat of skin hung across his back. It was mottled with decay, a tapestry of faces stolen from all the children that hung from those trees. 

But none of it compared to the monster’s own face. 

I inched backward, my voice a stammering mess of disbelief. ‘Not you…’

The Brittle Man rose up on its hind legs, coat falling open to reveal a chest that had caved in, a black heart beating behind the bars of its ribs. No—it wasn’t just beating. It was *breathing*. The heart itself was the source of those anguished, laboured gasps. 

But of course it was. 

Where else could it breathe from? After all, the monster had no mouth. 

It stalked forward, a decrepit behemoth cloaked in nightmares, staring down at me through a familiar button eye. Its head lolled from side to side, stuffing spilling from its open scalp. It wasn’t wearing the face of a monster. No, it wore the face of a rabbit. 

The kind a mother might sew for a son. 

‘Charlie?’ I said, voice hardly a whisper. ‘Is that really you [Charlie?'](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mio5te/theres_a_man_in_the_woods_who_walks_on_all_fours/)
