Hello, this is my first time sharing this story online. I was just 15 when it happend, our family and my girlfriend came back from France, we were driving in the Netherlands as our car broke down. We decided to grab our tents and sleep in an forest. That was a choice I regret for the rest of my life.  
  
I explored the forest, until i saw a run down cottage. it looked abandoned until i saw 2 figures moving behind the curtains. I thought nothing of it, I said to myself "must be the residents". I grabbed some tree branches. Until I heard my mom screaming. As I looked I saw my mom getting stabbed and dragged towards the house. I hid behind a tree. I was to afraid to attack the 2 figures because I saw that they each had one revolver in their pocket. I tried to make a run for it, they spotted me, I heard one gunshot. As I came to our campsite, I looked for my family, only my dad and girlfriend were left. I said to them: "we need to get the fuck out of here!"' My heart sank as my dad said "mom has the keys". We had to go back, but I saw in the distance the 2 figures sprinting towards us.  
  
I yelled to my girlfriend and dad: "RUN!" we all started running, i held my girlfriend's hand so i knew she did not stay behind. My dad saw a car of 2 hikers, but the only problem is, there were no keys. My dad yelled: "shit!". He tried to hotwire the car, but he got shot in the head. I was in shock, my dad... died. We turned, those 2 figures came walking to the car. as i was crying i pulled my dad's corpse off the driver seat, i tried to hotwire the car. Those 2 figures were not shooting us. I started the car, i started to drive, until i heard my girlfriend screaming. she was getting dragged out the window. With all the power in me, i punched 1 figure on his nose, it had metal armor around it's face, my hand started bleeding. I pulled on my girlfriend's leg. hoping i would drag her back. Before i knew it she was gone. I started driving, i was so sad and scared, I could not even cry anymore, I ignored all traffic laws. I did not even know traffic laws, i was 15. i raced to the police station. then my story went famous. I hated telling the story, reminding me of that tragic night  
  
. 6 months later, i was on my phone, My girlfriend send something in our groups chat, I was shocked. The message and picture were more shocking. It said: "I'm alive! but they said this is the last message you will receive of me, dont search for me". I saw in the picture she had short hair, i saw a window, i saw our car in the distance in the picure. She is in the same house! I regret that I did not go to the house, at that moment.  
  
5 years later. I heard someone knocking on the door, it was an police officer. She said I needed to come with her, i stepped into the car. The weird thing is, there were no signs of the inside of the car that it was a police car, same on the outside. It was just an ordinary hatchback. The woman stepped in the car. I did not trust this, but i was ready to fight her if needed. We drove by the police station, I knew something was wrong. I said to her: "Where are we going?" She said: "you will know this place". an hour went by. As we approached an forest. Memories came into my mind. My heart sank. I saw our old car. I yelled at the woman: "you murderer!". An angry expression came on her face, she yelled back:" You should not have trespassed!". I thought in my mind, was that the excuse to murder my family? We approached the house. I saw the window where my girlfriend Chloe had made the picture she send to the groups chat almost 6 years ago. i thought what happend to her, is she here, is she alive? would she remember me? She opened the car door, no gun pointed at me or anything. Just a friendly middle aged woman. I would not beat her up. Yet, she knew i had questions and want to investigate. I asked: "where is she?" she said: "find out for yourself" I opened the door. It was an run down house, the smell was okay. I thought it smelled like decaying meat, but it smelled like an normal house  
  
. I walked further, I saw an old man, sitting on the couch reading a book. It was just an normal couple, how could they do such things? Until i saw what was hanging on the wall. It was the head of my dead, perfectly preserved. i saw the bullet hole in his head. I tried not to puke. The old man stood up and said: "does he look familiar to you?" he laughed. I tried to keep myself calm and said: "why did you do it?" he said: "we needed somebody for the ritual". I said nothing, what ritual? who are these psychopaths? I walked even further. i saw stairs. I looked at the woman, she nodded in approval. I felt scared to go up those stairs, until I heard a muffled voice? could that be?! i ran immediatly up those stairs. I opened the door. I saw a girl that looked like chloe, she looked like she was 21. I was afraid to say anything. "Chloe?" I said, she looked at me with an bewildered face. She grabbed a knife and screamed "Intruder!". I began to run downstairs, the woman grabbed her and said: "It is ok, this is our new son". I was shocked? "What?!" i said, "You know the truth now, so you are going no where" she said. I just accepted my faith, because running was never an option here, look at what they did to my mom and dad. I do not want to ever get chased by them again.  
  
3 months later. I'm now finishing up my story, still in their house, nobody has gone looking for me. I still have contact with my friends but I told them i moved to America. Chloe, remembers me now, but she sometimes whispers in my ear "We need to make a run for it". I dont know if I ever want to make an escape. I will be dead in seconds, and if i ever escaped. That woman will find me, Also they told me their names. Apparently the woman is called: Martha. and the man: Dylan, So here I am, typing this on the computer. hoping somebody will find this house and save Chloe and me.
