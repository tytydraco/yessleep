I don’t have anyone else to tell, so I’m turning to you. I’ve been working a fully remote job for the past year. It can get lonely, holed up in my apartment, but my cat Mimi keeps me company. As I hunch over my screen, she rubs her head tenderly against my leg and jumps on my lap. I sit up straight, letting go of my mouse one moment to pet her sweet head. At all times and for all things, she is my light.

Until last year, I had been working as a barista. Meager wages, yet enough to sustain the little life Mimi and I had made for ourselves. I was content, happy to chat my shift away with my customers, happy to enjoy free drinks as a work perk. But I quit after an incident that left me scarred—literally.

To make a long story short: a customer, sweet-talking though slightly off-putting, took an uncomfortable liking to me. He was a regular, drank his coffee black with a splash of cream he would add himself at the pick-up counter.

One night, he was waiting for me outside the coffee shop, his hand wrapped tight around a brick from a nearby construction site.

I thought I’d be safe working from home. I’m not so sure anymore.

I’m now employed by a tech company, providing human feedback for all things large language models, generative AI and search engines. It’s repetitive but somewhat interesting work, although extremely impersonal. I’ve yet to speak to anyone from corporate, nor do I know any coworkers, as a matter of fact. I’ve barely even signed a contract. But I get paid on time, and I can watch movies as I work through infinite and mind-numbingly simple tasks. A few cents per submission quickly adds up, and I get paid extra for agreeing to rate NSFW content.

It started two months back. I was working at my desk, per usual, and about to take a break to feed Mimi who was already clawing at the back of my chair. “Just one more task, baby”, I whispered as I clicked around on the screen. I was rating search engine results for online queries. I submitted my task, ready to log out. That’s when I saw it.

My full name, spelled out in the search bar.

Now, my name is rather unique. The company, of course, had my contact information on file—do they use employee data to generate fake queries for us to evaluate? I don’t remember reading anything about this in any of my onboarding documents.

Was this a real search, then? I stared at the screen.

Now, I’ve searched for an old classmate or two to ruminate over the accomplishments they’ve immortalized on the Internet before. But I couldn’t be too flattered. It was the word that followed my name that sent a chill down my spine: “address”. Was someone looking for me?

I scanned the search results I was meant to evaluate. None of them, thankfully, displayed my real address. I thought I might have been overreacting. Ever since the incident at the coffee shop, I’ve been overly on my guard. Lost the few friends I had this way, including the coworker who found us and saved me that dreadful night.

Paranoia got the best of me. I wish I could say I’ve worked on myself, but I didn’t. I closed in on myself, locked the door and threw away the key. I order most of my groceries online nowadays, as well as any book I read. I used to love my local book shops—the smell of old books was always extraordinarily pleasing to me—but browsing Amazon has since replaced any and all of my past life’s rituals.

So, yes, I’ve been on my guard. When my package went missing, later to find out my neighbour had mistakenly picked it up, his face was the first thing on my mind. A flash of his crooked smile appeared to me then, too. Could it be him, looking me up? I checked the user’s location. My city. Our city.

Eventually, I had to submit the task and log off. Mimi was gnawing at the foot of my chair. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched. Yet, when I came back to work, half an hour later, routine was quick to set back in. Nothing abnormal. Nothing unusual.

I wanted to tell someone, call up a girl friend, but the line stayed quiet.

That night, I stared through my blinds at the dark a while before turning off the lights.

A few weeks ago, new tasks were assigned to me: evaluating instructions for image generation. It consisted, in short, of classifying user requests as either safe or unsafe. No images, just queries. This, I’m assuming, is to prevent the model from producing anything inappropriate.

Most of them were safe—entertaining, even. I was still chuckling at what an earlier query had conjured up in my mind when I pressed “submit”. I popped a grape in my mouth as I waited for the next one to load.

My heart sank when I found my name in the user search bar.



dead bitch **********-***** *******



I felt sick. Attacked all over again. My entire body was shaking as I hovered the cursor over the “unsafe” button. I read the query over and over again, hoping to find something different. I didn’t. It really was my name. No one else’s. I clicked “submit” and called out to Mimi, limbs trembling, begging for a bit of comfort. The page refreshed; the query disappeared.

What appeared next was far from a relief. I gasped, tears welling up in my eyes.



**********-***** ******* face smashed in whi tbrick



It was him, no doubt about it. Mimi, my best and my only friend, had walked into my bedroom, and however soft her meows were, in that moment, they were of no comfort to me. I thought of calling the police, but though I remember his breath, the empty look in his eyes, the ragged button-up he wore most days at the café, I never even knew his name. He always paid cash, and he was never caught. Never entered into the system.

My second reflex was to contact the company. Could they de-anonymize the user, given the violence of the requests? But again, I had never spoken to anyone from management. I didn’t know who my team lead was—if I even had one. I did receive employee newsletters, but I had serious doubts the marketing team could do anything for me.

I had never felt so alone, and God knows I had been.

This, however scary it was to me, wasn’t what prompted my writing this. After the second incident, I stopped working for a bit, fearing what my screen would show me next. The advantage of being a cog in so large and immaterial a machine is that you can disappear at any time, without a word. Not a single person would notice, and in my case, no one did.

But I quickly realized I needed the money. I couldn’t afford quitting, either. This was the only job that would offer me shelter from the outside world. With what I knew, I couldn’t and can’t risk stepping outside.

So I picked up some work again, my heart heavy with anxiety any time a page took some time to load. I’d breathe a sigh of relief every time I turned off my monitor at the end of the day. For two months, my blinds remained drawn.

But I can’t go on pretending nothing happened after what I saw today.

I took on more NSFW tasks as a moderator, hoping to make up for the week I had spent in bed. I would cover Mimi’s eyes whenever she would come to sit on my lap, though screens never really interested her, and I wasn’t sure she could even comprehend any of it.

Many of the pictures I could recognize from movies, others were rather cartoonish in style. These were okay. Others were grainy, dark. I would rather not know where those came from or who took them. Despite the gruesomeness involved in the task, I felt safe rating these pictures. I thought, perhaps naively, that though he could search what he pleased, he had nothing of the sort on me. I did not risk stumbling upon my name again.

I was wrong. Today, I was proven entirely wrong, because there, on my screen, I saw red.

Everything red.

Red blood.

Red flesh.

Red brick. 

And me. My face was an unrecognizable mess, beaten to a disgusting pulp, red like nothing I had ever seen in life and on my screen. But that hair was mine, and the collar of my shirt, though in the picture, soaked in blood, was unmistakable. It hasn’t fit me in years, but I know where it comes from.

My Facebook account is old, but remains publicly available. I lost my password a while ago. In my profile picture, I am still eighteen, full of life and colour, untouched, untouchable. Mimi was still a kitten then—I had posted a picture of the tiny orange ball of energy she used to be. My page is full of my thoughts—anything I found funny, anything I found interesting was shared with all the world to see. This unbroken part of me still exists online. And I know he has seen it. I know he’s reached right into it.

I can’t unsee myself. I can’t forget how I looked in that picture, dead. I don’t know who to go to. I don’t know what to do. Is there any way he would be able to find my address? Will that picture be enough to satisfy his urges? 

A question I’ve been asking myself every day for the last year echoes in my mind with a renewed gravity.

Why?

Why me?
