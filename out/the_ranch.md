I am Lorenzo, and this is the story of the most terrifying night of my life.

I decided to visit my family’s old farm on a moonless night, thinking it would be a great idea to prove that the ghost stories were just legends. The farm had been abandoned for decades, and the dense forest surrounding it only heightened the feeling of isolation.

I arrived at the farm just before sunset. The house, though worn by time, was still standing. Its windows were broken, and the doors creaked at the slightest touch of the wind. I entered, carrying only a flashlight, a blanket, and a backpack with some supplies. I decided to camp in the living room, a relatively central area of the house.

As the night progressed, the sounds of the surrounding forest became more intense. Owls hooted in the distance, and the wind whispered through the trees, creating an unsettling symphony. Inside the house, the silence was disturbing. I tried to distract myself by reading a book by flashlight, but the feeling of being watched wouldn’t leave me.

Around midnight, the temperature suddenly dropped. A dense fog began to invade the house, crawling along the floor as if it were alive. The flashlight started to flicker, and I heard heavy footsteps coming from upstairs. With my heart racing, I decided to investigate, thinking it might just be an animal seeking refuge in the house.

Climbing the creaky stairs, I noticed there were footprints in the dust, footprints of someone barefoot. I followed the marks to a room at the end of the hallway. The door was ajar, and when I pushed it open, I found an empty room, except for an old mirror hanging on the wall. The reflection in the mirror showed the room as it was decades ago, well-kept and furnished. However, there was something else. A nebulous figure with empty eyes was behind me in the reflection.

I quickly turned around, but the room was empty. When I looked back at the mirror, the figure had disappeared. Terrified, I tried to leave the room, but the door slammed shut, as if an invisible hand was holding it. Desperate, I started banging on the door and shouting for help.

Suddenly, the nebulous figure reappeared in the mirror, now closer. It began to whisper incomprehensible words, and the temperature in the room continued to drop. I felt my strength waning, as if something was draining my energy. I fell to my knees, feeling weaker and weaker.

In my last moment of consciousness, I saw the figure extend its hand, touching the mirror. A cold sensation took over my body, and everything went dark. When I woke up, it was already morning. The sun was shining brightly, the fog had disappeared, and the house seemed less threatening. I ran out of the farm, vowing never to return.

Days later, when I told my story, many didn’t believe me. But the few who did said I was lucky. They say the farm holds a dark secret and that those who do not respect the spirits that dwell there rarely come back to tell the tale.

This experience left a deep mark on me, and now I know that some legends have a grain of truth. No matter how much you think you can challenge the unknown, sometimes the unknown challenges you.
