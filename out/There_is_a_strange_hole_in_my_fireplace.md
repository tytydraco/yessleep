My new bedroom had an old fireplace, with black tiles and ornate ornaments on the sides. In the center was a round hole, no bigger than a dinner plate, that disappeared into the darkness of the chimney. At first I thought it was charming, a piece of history in my room, but that quickly changed.

It started on the second night. I was lying in bed, with my nightlight on, when I heard a scraping sound, like something scratching stone with sharp nails. It came from the hole in the fireplace. I sat up, my heart pounding, and listened. The sound stopped, but was replaced by a whisper – a raspy voice mumbling unintelligible words. I called my roommate, Sam, who came in very sleepy. "Do you hear that too?" I whispered. He nodded, his eyes focused on the hole. The whispers grew louder, alternating with a low growl that shook the tiles. We didn't sleep anymore that night.

The next day we couldn't handle it anymore. Whatever it was, it had to stop. We bought cement and closed the hole, layer after layer, until it was a smooth, gray circle in the black tiles. When we were done, my bedroom finally felt normal. No noises, no cold drafts. I thought it was over.

But that night I woke up with a heavy feeling, as if someone was watching me. My room was quiet, too quiet, but then I heard it: a soft tapping, as if something small was hitting the inside of the fireplace. The tapping became pounding, heavy and rhythmic, as if something large was trying to escape. The whispering started again, not from the fireplace, but from all sides in my room: "You've locked us up, but we still see you. You've locked us up, but we still see you.“

Panicking, I grabbed a hammer from my desk and smashed the cement, thinking I had to free the thing to make it stop. The hole was open again, but now I saw something in the darkness – a shining white eye emulating a bright light, but the size of a marble, staring back at me. Then quickly a second eye appeared, and right after that a third, until dozens of eyes were staring at me from the hole. The whispers became a chorus of voices, and I felt a cold touch on my neck, as if something invisible was standing behind me. I ran out of my room, almost stumbled from the stairs, almost bumping into a new closet I bought that day in the hallway out of the house, but the voices followed me, echoing in my head, and I knew I would never outrun them again.

If you ever find a hole in your fireplace that is making noises, do not plug it. And don't break it open. Because what's behind it has been waiting for centuries, and it's now watching you. Check your walls tonight – if you hear tapping, you're already too late.
