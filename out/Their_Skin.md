I promised myself the day I lost them that I would die on this property, buried next to my son and wife. They’ve been gone 3 years and there’s not a day that goes by that I don’t stop at their graves just to chat. The property was our dream, from the first steps Into our new lives til now. I sit on my porch and think of the good times often, not noticing the day passing by. The darkness in my mind trying to take me but I know she wouldn’t want me to do it that way. 

I have no family left in the world. My only friend is the post man that drives to my little nook in the woods to bring me mail. Charlie’s been delivering my mail for about six years now. I live in a pretty secluded area so he stops and chats for a while before his next stop.

“Hey old man whatcha doin?” Charlie said.

“Watching the paint rot mostly.” I chuckled.

“Yea well you gotta find a hobby man, you can’t just let your mind go to waste.” He said.

“You come here to bring me my mail or charge me for counseling. “I said. 

He shook his head and laughed. 

“After my last stop today imma come
by and we’re gonna play some cards and eat alright old man.” He laughed.

“Charlie give me my damn mail.” I laughed back.

He handed me my mail and turned to leave. Charlie was a good guy and his wife is such a sweet lady. They come over and visit from time to time and in my age I’m thankful. I don’t have a cellphone and I try to stay away from the TV but I’ll admit I’m a glutton for paranormal and conspiracy programs. Charlie came by that night and we ate and played cards. 

You know Ted, you’re only 45. You should get out there and find someone buddy. He said. 

I don’t think it’s that easy Charlie. I said back.

“Listen I know things aren’t the best and I know you’ve been through so much, but you deserve to be happy brother.” He said. 

I began to tear up, not because I was upset but because I knew he was right. Charlie stood up and put his hand on my shoulder.

“I got someone I want you to meet ok.” He said

“She’s my wife’s friend from work and she’s around your age.” He said.

I say quiet for second with the anxiety of a first date weighing on my chest. I took a deep breath and responded.

“Boy are you fuckin nutts…” I said.

“I’m so broken I look like a 1000 piece puzzle.” I continued.

“It’s not a request old man, you’re going” he said smirking.

Charlie stood up and pushed in his chair. 

“Friday night we’re going to dinner and a movie, I’ll be here to pick you up at 6”. He said.

“Well I guess I have no choice huh..” I joked.

“Put on your best boots and try to wear pants with no holes in em ok!” He said as he walked out the front door.

“See you later old man, this time Friday you’re gonna be calling me matchmaker Charlie!” He yell es over his shoulder as he jogged to his truck. 

“A date..?” I said out loud to myself. “It should be ok..I hope.”

That night was like any other but for some reason something felt off. I stood on my front porch and stared at my long dark driveway trees on both sides. I began to hear a noise but chalked it up to be a moose. I went inside and got into bed unsure of what I was feeling. That night I dreamt of my wife and son. This wasn’t my normal good dream at all. My son and wife were on my porch in the clothes they were buried in with pitch black eyes asking me if I could let them In.

“Lets us in my love.” Said my wife 

“Please daddy it’s could out here” said my son.

I made my way to the door, the closer I got the heavy this presence felt. I reached out for the door knob and noticed something. My wife’s my wife’s left arm was deformed and had claws. As I looked up they were both smiling now. I backed away from the door slowly and they both burst through screaming. I woke up screaming and drenched in sweat. I decided to wake up and get my day started. 

I went downstairs and found that my front door was cracked open. Did I forget to lock it when I came in last night? I walked onto the porch and stared down the driveway. I could almost feel eyes on me coming from the surrounding forest. I began to hear what I thought was a moose, but now I’m wasn’t so sure anymore.

“WHOS OUT THERE!” I screamed. 

“SHOW YOURSELF!” I screamed again.

Nothing but silence now. I began to relax thinking that maybe I was just paranoid and probably shouldn’t have drank so much last night. I sat on my porch waiting for Charlie but he didn’t show. It wasn’t like him to miss days let alone have no one show up at all. Before I worried I waited til it got late before I made calls. I called Charlie’s wife and asked if he was around. She said he came home acting strange last night and left this morning and hasn’t returned. I told her I would look into it and I hung up the phone.

I walked down the driveway and looked around. Not a car for hours in fact I haven’t heard any animals today and that’s not normal at all. I stood there and pulled out a cigarette and struck a match. As I began to light the cigarette a shrill tiny voice came from behind me. 

“Hey.” It whispered

I jolted straight and dropped my cigarette. I could feel the goosebumps ripple down my arms and back. I stood there frozen in fear and confusion. 

“Hello?” I said back.

Nothing replied to me. I began to make my way back down the driveway towards the house and could hear something following behind me. I began to up my pace towards the house from walking to jogging to full on sprinting. Whatever was behind me sounded like it was right on my ass. I got to my porch and spun around. There was nothing there. In my mind I must be suffering from some sort of psychosis.

“WHO THE FUCK IS OUT THERE!”I began yelling.

As I did this a loud yell came from the woods. It began to reverb through the woods getting louder and louder. The laughter circled me like annoying bees. I clutched my ears and dropped to my knees. I could feel the yell in my back it was so loud. Then it stopped. I ran into my house and grabbed my shotgun. I ran to my front door gun loaded and ready. As I stepped out the door with the gun raised I noticed a man gradually jogging up my driveway. It was Charlie.

“Charlie, what the hell is going on man!!” I yelled 

“You better not be pranking me!” I yelled again.  


Charlie was in a dead sprint towards my house now. He sprinted all the way up to my porch and stopped just before my step. He didn’t say anything he just stood there with his head down. He wasn’t breathing hard or even really making any noise. 

“Charlie are you ok man, there’s a lot of weird stuff going on and your wife’s worried man.” I said.

Charlie slowly picked up his head and stared me right in the eyes. His eyes were bloodshot and his lips were dry. 

“They’re here now Ted.” He said.

“They visited you last night and you denied them Ted.” He continued.

“Charlie what’s…” he cut me off. 

“You shouldn’t have done that Ted.” He said. 

“Charlie cmon man come in the house and get washed up.” I asked cautiously.

“Go inside Ted, they’re coming back.” He said before he turned and began to walk back up the driveway.

I was at a loss for words. I ran into the house and immediately tried to call his wife but the phones were down. I ran back out and he was already gone. An eerie silence surrounded me now. Absolutely zero noise, it was almost maddening. I went into the house and grabbed a beer and my cigs. I sat on the porch with my shotgun and waited. I dozed off and woke up to nightfall. The moon was overhead and the fear had kicked in again. 

I stood up on the porch and looked around the property. Coming down my driveway was a pair of people. A woman in a white gown and a boy in white clothing. They were almost glowing in the moonlight. I pointed my shotgun at the pair and waited for them to approach. It was them. To my horror my deceased wife and son walked to my steps and asked me if I could let them in. I began to sob shotgun pointed at them both. Their eyes black as the night itself. 

“Teddy don’t you want to be with us?” She said in a distorted voice. 

“Yea daddy, come with us.” He said as the boy outstretched his hand to me. 

“ I can’t.” I sobbed.

I wiped the tears off my face and straightened up. I shouldered my shotgun and stood my ground. 

“My family is dead, you’re not my family.” I said through clenched teeth. 

“I don’t know who you are or what you are but I’m about to blow a hole in your chest.” I said.

The boy put his hand down at his side and they both began to cackle. The boy dropped to his back and began to thrash violently. The woman grabbed both sides of her mouth and began to tear her cheeks to hear ears. I screamed in horror and fell back onto my ass. I closed my eyes and fired both barrels at the pair. I opened my eyes and they were gone. I stood up and dusted myself off. My mind was not ok. I slapped myself repeatedly 

“Wake up wake up wake up!” I said as I slapped myself harder and harder. 

But the fact remained that this wasn’t a dream at all. I was living a nightmare.
