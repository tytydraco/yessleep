Living in a small town in the bible belt south is typically a decently chill place. I mean there's the bible thumpers who can be a bit wild, but normally it's a nice calm place. Until last week.

Look you can call me and my friends crazy, but we know what we saw in those woods. It wasn't an animal, or a person. It was... something else entirely. I'd almost describe it like a not deer, you know the video that was everywhere a couple months back. But it wasn't a deer more coyote like, I don't know what it was trying to mimic because it didn't do that great of a job, but honestly I don't think I WANT to know.

Everyone in my towns hunts or fishes or just in general goes into the woods, me and my friends are no exception. Me and my friends, Nick and Ash, decided to go into the woods last week. Normal thing we do, there's not much to do in town unless you wanna wander around a couple parking lots or the like three fast food joints we have, so the woods it is.

We've all been in them before, usually to take pictures of the wildlife. Ash brought their camera, we wanted to take some pictures and Ash was the only one who was able to get their hands on a good quality camera. We just kept walking through on a path we always took. Seeing the game camera that people left up. We'd also made sure to wear the stupid orange vests so we didn't get shot at or something by hunters, it's Kentucky and we still have some things in season. We were just trying to see if we could find anything cool to take a picture of, maybe a doe and her fawns.

We hadn't been out there long when we heard something to out left. We looked over, Ash had their camera ready in case it was an animal, though we figured it may have been someone hunting. Then we saw it. I felt my blood run cold at the sight of it. It almost looked like a coyote like I said but only if a coyote was the size of a damn moose. It had black fur, teeth that were way too big for it's mouth, way too many teeth, and it didn't appear to have eyes. Then we saw it had something in it's mouth...or well some ONE in it's mouth. I saw the orange vest and bits of camo clothing. Then I saw the blood so much blood. I could tell I was frozen from fear at this point, hell I think Nick and Ash were too.

At some point it stepped towards us, dropping the body to the ground. That's when I felt myself break free, then I grabbed both Nick and Ash and started to run. How the hell it didn't grab us in our mad dash out of those woods, I'll never know. Maybe it let us go. One thing I do know, I'm never going back.

Call me crazy, say I probably am making all this up. But I know what I saw wasn't a coyote, I fear it is something much worse than I won't dare say the name of as to not make it come. But I'm sure as hell not whistling at night ever again. I know what I saw, it was real. I hope to God I'll never see it again.
