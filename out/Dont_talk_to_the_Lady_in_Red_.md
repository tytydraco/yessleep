I got off the train this morning at about 9:30 from the gym, it was approximately a two minute walk from the train station back to my house, which made the pouring rain seem a little less miserable.  

I entered our estate as usual, expecting to see the whole thing completely deserted, as it regularly was. But instead I saw an unfamiliar woman getting out of a red car holding a large box. Our family had known the people in our area for a long time. No one ever moved, no one ever left, which was probably the reason this felt so strange. 
But I just presumed this was a new resident just settling in, so I gave her a smile. 

She was dressed in a red raincoat, navy blue jeans, and ridiculously shiny red rain boots. Her face was pale, (like you’d think a ghost would be.) And yet again, a red shade of lipstick. She stared at me for a while before smiling back, and quickly turned around. Her movements were almost like a robots, very controlled and almost impeccably repetitive. 

My mom had left a key underneath the plant pot in the open garage as she had went out to our local city which was just about half an hour away by car. That meant I was home alone, as my older brother was working.

I got in, locked the door behind me, and jumped straight into the shower, eager to rinse off the sweat from my body. By this time I had almost erased the Lady in Red from my memory completely, and brushed it off without any further thoughts. I dried my self off, but some clothes on, and sat down on my chair, ready to start up my PC.

Just before I pressed the button to activate my computer. I heard an incredibly loud knock on the door, one only my family do, as we had a ring doorbell which strangers usually use. I ran downstairs, looked through the peephole, but to my surprise; It was the lady in red. 

“Hello?” I asked, I just wanted to find out what she wanted, so I could start on my Minecraft server as quickly as possible. 

“Hello,” she replied in an eerily slow way. “Are you all alone?” She asked very peculiarly.

“Yes, may I ask why?” 

“Ah no reason. Just curious to why a young boy of your age was to be left all on his own, that’s all.” I was 15 ( male ) so I didn’t get these type of comments regularly, I thought it was a little creepy at first. 

“Sorry, but why is it any of your business?” I snapped back defensively. 

Her body had jolted up as I had said this, as if a robot had just been powered on. 

“I’m sorry, I’m just thinking for your, your…” she paused for a moment, “Well being.” She remarked.

“Look lady, how about you find something else to do instead of bothering teenagers to find out if they’re home alone or not.” 

She laughed slowly and creepily, “ I’m sorry, but I must insist I come in, and make sure you are supervised.” 

I immediately replied with, “ No thanks, my mom’s coming back soon. It’ll be alright. “ 

I didn’t wait for a response as I quickly shut the door in her face, and ran up back to my room and instantly texted my mom. She said she’d be straight back, and left right away from her beauty appointment.

After about fifteen minutes, I figured I better get some breakfast, as I was starving at this point. So I went downstairs, checked the ring door bell to make sure that the lady had gone. And went into the kitchen to get myself some cereal. 

As my mom got back, I immediately told her what happened, and we had decided to check the doorbell footage, and call the cops.  

We went through the footage, nothing was there, just me talking to an empty doorway, my heart stopped. My mom then scolded me, before giving me a lecture about how not to make stuff up like that. Despite how much I tried to convince her, nothing worked. And she then drove back to her appointment, leaving me alone, again. 

I sat down on the couch, and began to watch the zombie show I was watching, and down to the 10th season. There wasn’t much to go. 

After a couple episodes and about three hours of binge watching, I got  a text from my mom again, saying how she was going to be out for the rest of the day, so don’t bother her. I was furious, but there was nothing I could do. I went into the kitchen to get myself a drink. 

I entered the kitchen, through the window I could almost see a woman, trying to peer into the house.

It was the lady in red. 

I banged on the window and told her to fuck off, and if she came again, I’d get the cops involved.
She didn’t take this lightly as she gave me a look of pure hatred, before she walked away. This made my heart sink, I couldn’t text my mom, my brother, I didn’t know what to do, so I went up to my bedroom, locked the door, shut the curtains and the window. 

I felt a sense of safety now, I didn’t even realise the time was two o’clock already, I was terrified of the thought of how long she was really out there for, watching me. Unaware of her intentions, I tried to put this in the past by logging on to my PC, I thought I’d have a quick session. 

Hours passed by as I played Minecraft for god knows how long. The clock read ten past nine. So I thought I would call it a day on my PC. So I got in bed and watched some more of my TV show, I hadn’t had anything to do with the lady in red since. So I thought that was it, my mom still wasn’t home, and my brother was going to be at a bar for a couple more hours: he had just finished work. 

I rolled onto my left side in bed. My curtains were closed, but there was a small enough gap to see through outside, about six inches. I thought about dozing off, and calling it a night, before I saw a familiarly smooth, shiny, red surface, it looked like a coat. Which made my heart stop. It must be the lady in red. I opened my window instantly, but to my relief, nothing was there. This time I left the curtains open, the window locked, and I was aware. I dozed off for a while before I woke up, at this time it was now pitch black, but I could see an image through the window. 

The lady in red, again. This time, I was convinced something was there, she was staring at me blankly, without emotion, she looked like she had something in her hands. 

A knife.

I unlocked the door, quickly opened it, but as soon as I did so, the image of her vanished. “I must’ve been hallucinating.” I thought to myself self. 

But to my devastation, I had realised my grave mistake. 

The image was a reflection.
