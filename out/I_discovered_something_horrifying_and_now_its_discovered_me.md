Hey guys, I’ve got something a little different this time. As I started writing this, I realised this is my 100th post. I just wanted to say: it’s been a hell of a ride here on *Down the Rabbit Holes*. When I started this site all those years ago, I just wanted a space to write down my discoveries and give myself an excuse to nerd out on some random facts and Wikipedia binges. I never expected to meet a community of like-minded curios. 

I never expected this question to bother me the way it has done. My latest project started the way most of them do, with me pondering a random question in the shower. This time: where do clowns come from? I mean, it’s always seemed so strange to me that across so many cultures there’s such a consistent archetype: non-verbal, exaggerated movement, white make-up and caricatured expression. Like how is it that the design is similar regardless of whether you’re in America, France, Russia, Japan, Brazil or anywhere else? It just seems like such an integral part of so many cultures. 

Lots of things end up looking consistent across cultures or geographies because they serve a singular purpose. In biology we call that convergent evolution (remember we covered when exploring how do animals mimic each other?) But it doesn’t seem like there’s any natural reason that clowns should be so consistent. That’s what piqued my interest.



Because, let’s be honest. Clowns are *weird*. This opinion is so common that there’s even a specific word for the fear of clowns: coulrophobia. That’s unusual in itself. Our fears are generally grounded in survival. You experience arachnophobia? That’s because our species has learned to fear poisonous spiders. Claustrophobia? That keeps us alive by avoiding narrow and dangerous caves (although there are those insane few that buck the trend…) What evolutionary benefit could there be for developing a fear of clowns? Well, I think I know the answer to that now.

When I started researching, I expected to come across dozens of different origin stories and competing explanations. Remember when I looked at the origin of eating utensils - there were so many competing theories for when and where forks first developed.  But no - the clown as we know it today can be traced back to a single origin. The classic idea of a clown - the white face, slapstick motion, caricatured expression - all comes down to a single figure in the commedia del-arte in sixteenth century Florence. One character, one instance, and now it’s in every culture and every country. 

I’ve looked through paintings from the time, and the same character keeps coming up, the dark eyes in a white face. In one painting, the arms seemed to hang below the knees. I thought it was a stylistic touch when I first saw it: now I’m not so sure. 



Good ideas stick and spread. We’ve picked up enough about human psychology and behavioural science over the course of this blog to see that. But what doesn’t make sense is that the concept of the clown doesn’t seem like a good idea. This figure is unsettling. Psychologists suggest that we find clowns unsettling because they lie in the ‘uncanny valley’. This is the name given to a fear of things that feel almost human, but not quite. Something like a puppet or a robot is disturbing as it seems like it could be human, but there is a wrong-ness to it. Those deep fears, the ones you’re born with: they go a long way back. When we were still living in caves and starting to master the ability to create fire, we were learning to fear things that looked almost human. Were there others, the *not-people*, wreathed in smoke around the tribe’s campfire, with a face that could pass in the flickering light, but whose deception would be revealed in the light of day?



In my deep dive article on ants, we spent a long time on those different predators that blend into ant colonies \[FN: it’s called myrmecomorphy - basically ‘looking like an ant’ in Latin. And like a lot of good ideas in biology it’s evolved independently (convergent evolution) over 70 different times\]. There are spider and beetles that can imitate ant pheromones and wander through the tunnels undetected, blending in with the rest of the colony. I always found it quite funny when I saw it on a documentary. Like how could the ants not see that this creature was obviously not one of them? I don’t find it funny anymore. But I do still wonder, is there a sense of wrongness that the ants feel? Something about those interlopers, those *not-ants*: how they move, or the shape of their features, that illicit an inarticulable fear in the rest of the colony? Before they’re devoured, is the unfortunate ant’s final thought, “I knew there was something wrong about that one”



So this character of the clown, this archetype, one that causes fear. Why would it dominate and spread so quickly, taking hold from a single origin? Why would an unsettling character prove to be so popular? But that’s looking at it the wrong way. Perhaps it isn’t successful as a character, but as a disguise. For the others, the *not-people*, that have hunted on the fringes of our species for so long that we are born with an innate dread, this new form clearly changed things for them. In the guise of the clown, they had a perfect disguise. An excuse and explanation for their unnatural features and exaggerated movements. On top of that, exposure to the more vulnerable young of the species. It’s no wonder the adaptation spread over the globe from that one instance. 

The problem is that ever since I’ve started to understand this truth, I’m starting to spot the ‘tells’: the mouth that turns the wrong way, just for a moment. The too-long limbs that bend where no joint should be. The obsidian eyes that stare for too long, sizing up each person they meet as a potential meal. And in noticing them, they notice me. 



That’s the terrifying thing. Maybe once they were poor imitations of people, but as they have infiltrated us more, and as we get so much worse at basic human contact, they’re no longer relegated to the shadows around the edges. 

And it’s getting more frequent. They know that I know. It’s gone from spotting one every few days, at the back of the bus or out at the store, to realising that any time I leave the house, there’s always one or two keeping watch on me. The empty eyes that they have, wordlessly watching. It’s starting to feel quite claustrophobic. 

About halfway through writing this, I noticed one of them out the window. All attempts at subtlety had gone, he was simply standing across the street from my house, staring in the window. I would say there was a slight smirk on his face, but I don’t know that they feel the same emotions we do. Maybe they’re learning that too.

He didn’t move when I shut the blinds. He didn’t seem to blink. 

I’ve just opened them again, now that I’ve finished. Now there are three of them. Like I said, I don’t think there’ll be any more articles. It’s been an absolute pleasure, thank you for indulging my bizarre curiosity. I don’t really have any idea what you should do with this information. If any of this feels familiar, I’m sorry. They’ve probably been noticing you for even longer than you’ve been noticing them.
