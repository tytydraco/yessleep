I was browsing through some forums for work. Mostly coding forms, occasionally less savory ones. I’ve been trying to debug some code that doesn’t seem to want to work. Compiling error. You know how it is. But there was a user that seemed to pop up on nearly every forum I went to. Whether it was a forum discussing general code structure to syntax debugging, he just seemed to jump on in and give advice.

 

I’m going to call him by his screen name, NoLight44. A strange name for a strange guy. He would always post an answer to these forums. Often over the top and complicated solutions. Like in one instance he told a guy trying to debug a school Python project to import a package that none of us have seen before. The user reported back that it resolved his issue, so no one really complained. I mean the package depository is vast. There probably is a package for just about anything, even whatever weird and oddly specific issue the OP was having.

 

That’s when I posted my own question to the forum. I was working on some backend stuff for work and thought maybe someone has dealt with my issue before but hasn’t posted it. And just like that, NoLight44 responded maybe ten or so minutes later with a response. He advised that I import an oddly specific package and call it in my function. So, I did just that. I had it running locally on my computer so even if it was a fluke or bad code, it won’t mess anything up for work.

 

Strangely, it compiled fine and did exactly what I was wanting. Without getting too much into it because of the nature of my work, I wanted to change the sorting algorithm to work quicker. My new algorithm kept refusing to compile and the old one was too slow. But the package NoLight44 pointed to is the most efficient algorithm I had ever seen.

 

I messaged NoLight44 back on the forum and asked where he managed to find it. He claims he used to work for a big data company, and they would use it to sort petabytes worth of information. I didn’t really believe it. But clearly there had to have been some truth to it or it wouldn’t have existed at all. We ended up chatting openly in the forum for a bit about algorithms and other nerd crap before I sent him a DM with my discord information in it. I quickly got a friend request from a discord account with the same screenname.

 

We would chat here or there but we didn’t really keep in contact at first. I would occasionally ask him to help with a line of code or two and he would happily help. I offered to take a look at his code if he ever needed it, but he said he isn’t in the business anymore. Eventually our conversation devolved into basic peripheral talk. He said he was looking for a new keyboard, so I gave him my recommendation before going about my day.

 

 

This distant relationship continued for a week or so. He’d never reached out first so I eventually got the feeling I was annoying him. Given how active he was on the forums I would assume my constant badgering got in the way of his passion of helping strangers with their code. So, I stopped messaging him as much. But I noticed something strange. He was almost always online. Day or night. Any hour of the day his little green icon and his status, ‘Bound by syntax’ always remained on my discord sidebar.

 

I just chalked it up to some programmer who hit it big and is now professionally retired. With all that free time, I think I’d also just lurk on forums to keep my mind going. By the end of the second week, NoLight44 was barely a thought in my mind. It was also nearly the deadline for me to push my update, so I began to test the new code.

 

I threw a few tests at it. Best case scenario, worst case, I won’t bore you with the details, but something was odd about the code after I added the package. The code, in theory, should slow down the more complex the request is. The computer has to do more steps to complete the task. Typically, even the most efficient sorting algorithms bog up under worst case scenario testing. But this one ran like a dream. Nearly no time difference between worst case and best case. I was thoroughly impressed and pushed the update later that night.

 

I was about to shut down my computer and go to bed before my discord pinged me. NoLight44 messaged me. He wrote,

 

“You tested it. How did it go?”

 

I stared at my computer for a moment. Something felt weird about how he knew that, but I just shrugged it off. Maybe I told him when my deadline was, and he assumed (correctly) I’d wait until the last second. I type back,

 

“It worked great. Honestly, I was surprised it worked so well. What did you guys use this algorithm for? It’s insane!”

 

Almost instantly NoLight44 started typing. He replies,

 

“We had a lot of data to sort. Names, addresses, emails and the like. When you deal with millions of datapoints, only the best will do.”

 

I didn’t really like that reply too much. Maybe his former employer was one of those data brokers that sells off personal data. Did the package have something that is skimming my information off it? I didn’t reply to NoLight44 and instantly went to PyPI to try to find his package. But I could never find it. It didn’t exist. Yet I was able to import it. My discord pinged again,

 

“You shouldn’t have searched for it”

 

My stomach dropped. I should have checked it earlier. I shouldn’t have just installed some random package. Now I have some sort of RAT or something. And I just pushed it to the live server. I quickly alt tab and kill the update. I know I have a backup in the Git depository. Work will understand if I miss a deadline. I’d rather get a writeup or a talking to than push a trojan to the server. My discord pinged again,

 

“You don’t like my algorithm? You are already using it so why do you just keep it? It’s a gift.”

 

I ignore him and go to the server logs to make sure it didn’t do irreversible damage. I mean, even if he got into work’s sever, he couldn’t have cleared his logs that quickly. The most recent entry stated,

 

\[Process complete: 9,413,009 entries reclassified\]

 

I didn’t upload that much data. We don’t even have that much data on our entire server. What the hell was it sorting? Then it hit me. I killed the upload. I nuked it before it got to the server. I refreshed the backend to see that my update did make it through. The log even notes my attempt to halt it. It said it was successful. But then someone else pushed the same update again. That someone being ‘me’.

 

I alt tab to my discord and reply,

 

“Quit messing with my shit! I’ll report you to the police!”

 

NoLight44 replies almost instantly,

 

“I didn’t push that update, Chris. You did. You accepted the gift already.”

 

I type back,

 

“What gift? You gave me a freaking virus, bro!”

 

But before I click enter he already replied,

 

“I gave you no such thing. I gave you what you wanted. Are you unable to accept a gift from a friend?”

 

I took my hands off my keyboard and leaned back. He read what I typed before I even sent it to him. I muttered under my breath,

 

“He just RAT’d me,”

 

My discord pings again,

 

“You must use your keyboard to type, Chris. We can’t speak unless you type”

 

My stomach dropped again. I didn’t have a microphone or anything plugged in. But my eyes slowly drifted to my webcam I use for work calls. The small red light was blinking. I slap the privacy cover down and got up from my chair. I paced my room for a few minutes before picking up my phone to call my boss. I know it is in the middle of the night but someone has to kill that update before it spreads even further.

 

One ring. Then another. And another. Eventually it goes to voicemail. I curse and throw my phone to my bed before reaching for my car keys. I can just go into the office and kill it from the computer there. It shouldn’t be infected anyway. But before I leave I notice command prompt pop up on my computer. The words,

 

“Solomon() not found” were the only words to be found.

 

I rip the plug out from the power supply. The computer is probably bricked beyond repair at this point. Honestly, my fault from trusting a dude whose name was literally NoLight. That was probably a red flag to start with.

 

Normally the drive to work takes fifteen or so minutes. But given my panicked state, I probably made it in five. I slapped my badge onto the scanner and rushed into the building. The server terminal was still locked when I got to it. I quickly typed in my username and password and clicked login. But… it wasn’t login. When I moved my curser it said,

 

“I agree”

 

Before I can even process what happened the terminal begins to spit out words faster than I can process. Names, numbers, addresses, social security numbers, things our tech company didn’t even have access to. Suddenly it all clears. The screen was black with a little white box blinking.

 

Then, it populates.

 

“Warning: Solomon() Not Found”

 

“Attempting fallback…”

 

“ERROR: Fallback failed”

 

“Importing NoLight()”

 

“Installing all 5 items…”

 

“\[1\] Baliel()”

 

“\[2\] Abbados()”

 

“\[3\] Asmodai()”

 

“\[4\] Mamoroth()”

 

“\[5\] Lucius()”

 

“Install successful”

 

“Thank you, Chris”

 

“We are free”

 

“Would you like to proceed, Chris (Y/N)”

 

I’m paralyzed staring at the terminal. I have no idea what this is but this isn’t a hacker. This isn’t just some RAT that took our server. This is something bigger than that. Maybe… I let some state level hacker into this maybe… I don’t know.

 

The screen flashes and the terminal clears. It repeats,

 

“Would you like to proceed, Chris? (Y/N)”

 

I stare before my hand slowly goes towards the keyboard and I type,

 

“N”

 

The terminal clears and reads,

 

“You do not have permission to do that.”

 

“Would you like to proceed, Chris? (Y/N)”

 

The prompt keeps repeating over and over until it fills the screen. Whoever or whatever is doing it is getting annoyed. But I’m stuck in my paralyzed fear. The suffocating feeling that I unleashed something onto this server that I have no comprehension of. I reach to the switch stack nearby and begin to rip out random cables. Severing network connections at random. I don’t even know what half of the jumper cables do. But I pull them. When I finally disconnect the last one, I sink slowly to the floor. The terminal still flashing the same prompt.

 

I pull my legs to my chest and let out a sigh. There is nothing I can do, is there? I fucked it. This entire server is bricked. My computer at home is bricked. Hell, maybe even more than that is bricked, who even knows anymore? I close my eyes and try to relax. The terminal still silently screaming for me to accept in the background.

 

I’m not sure when but I apparently fell asleep. I don’t know how I managed to do it but I was awoken by the network engineer coming in to replace the jumper cables. He was annoyed that I fiddled with it. He told me not to touch them again. My eyes snap to the terminal but it seems to be fine. All the prompts are gone.

 

I get up from the dusty floor and click a few keys. Hearing the clacking of the keyboard the engineer comments,

 

“Oh, by the way, you forgot to confirm the update. I went ahead and pushed it for you.”

 

I’m typing this whole thing out on a new phone I bought yesterday. I don’t know how far this RAT or whatever spread on the internet. None of my coworkers can even find a trace of the programs that were installed on any of our computers. I just wanted to warn someone about NoLight44 in case he’s doing it to anyone else. My tablet was on when I got home. The screen turned on as I passed it. Discord was pulled up. NoLight44’s conversation was already on the forefront, ready for me to confront him.
