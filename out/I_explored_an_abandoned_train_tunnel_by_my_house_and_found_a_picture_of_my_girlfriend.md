For context my girlfriend lives 5 hours away from me and we met online. 

I wanted to explore an abandoned train tunnel by my house for years and I finally grew the balls to do so. It was by an active construction site that I had to go through to access the tunnel, luckily I have cased it for weeks and found out the shifts. I went on a Saturday, a day that the workers weren't there. I climbed the fence and went in the tunnel. The walls were covered in graffiti and smelled like sewage. I went deeper in and saw some garbage and disturbing messages in red spray paint like "Killer clown up ahead" or "Turn back now. Serial Killer lair" I knew it was just some dumb teenagers acting like well...dumb teenagers so I kept going which was a mistake. I get about half way through when I noticed photographs of random women I look through the pictures and I stopped when I found one labeled with the date of that day. It was my girlfriend, I heard laughing and I've never ran faster in my life. I called her immediately and she said that she hasn't left her house at all today. I wanted to go back in but who knows who or what took that picture. I can't even call the police since that tunnel is private property and I could get a pretty hefty fine for trespassing. This happened about 3 years ago and both me and my gf are fine, but that still scares me when I walk passed that tunnel, thinking what lies in there. I did research on the area and nothing came up about any stalking or anything of that sort. I did some image searching on missing people in the area and none of those pictures were of anyone missing in the past 20 years.

 I remember thinking "What the fuck?" when I stumbled upon this next part. A police report filed an hour ago it was missing persons case for all the women in the pictures...I remember one of the dates on the pictures said 9/23/97 so how is there just now a police report? I was doing research on public records for hours and I found only one police report on a sketchy website. I don't know what to make of any of this and I want to figure out.

My girlfriend and I are still terrified about this. We don't know who those people in the other pictures were and we don't want to know anymore. Maybe it's a hoax, maybe it was a serial killer, maybe it was even a skinwalker or windego waiting for its next victim nevertheless it scares us both and we try not to think about it or anything that'll remind us of it anymore. this is the first time I'm talking about it in 2-3 years and I'm getting chills just writing this. If I get any updates on this I will post them asap.
