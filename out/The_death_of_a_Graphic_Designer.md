So this has been one of the scariest experiences of my life. Perhaps even another example of the butterfly effect.

I am a Senior Graphic Designer and recently needed a change within my field, I began studying UX Design and applying for positions even as junior just to gain some experience.

I came across a post. It was an official job listing for a UX/Graphic Designer and It was also not too far from where I live. I applied for the job and maybe 15 others. Within the week I received 2 interviews including the listing above.

I put on my formal black pencil skirt, white shirt, red heels and slapped on some stark red lip stick like always. There was a huge sign outside a double story run down house. It read “EA Designs” it included a professionally designed logo.

I don’t mind working in a building that looks like a house from the outside but as I got inside it looked like an unkept old age home. There was even a dark play room on the right as you entered. It had a ball pit and some other kids facilities but there was no light except for the light from the passage and the open front door.

A middle aged Caucasian lady appeared before me. She asked are you “Zed”? I slightly nodded yes not moving or blinking as she closed the door behind me, still skeptic of my surroundings I quickly snapped out of it and pulled out my hand. Yes, it’s nice to meet you I said confidently.

She said, right this way, the office is at the back. I followed slowly, gleaming through each room as we passed. It was mostly empty rooms, just rusted walls and no visible windows or air. It smelled dusty. My spider senses were on overdrive but the dumb naive me continued along the passage.

At the back was a medium to small sized room. There was a huge almost office/ dining room looking table in the centre. At the left hand corner there was an elderly lady writing on some paper, she did not even raise her head to look at me and sitting not too far from her was a young Caucasian girl who seemed to be in her early 20’s with long blond hair.

Oh Hey, you must be Zed she said in a cheerful voice, I smiled politely and responded yes and you are?. Sam! web developer, "yeeesh" she exclaimed: “I know this place looks like a dump but we don’t get walk in clients as we mainly offer an online service and we just moved here so hopefully we will be doing some interior design soon". Her words put me at ease and I felt like a jerk for being judgmental although it was quite an unprofessional setting and the table was filled with papers in stacks almost covering the entire table which again I might add is HUGE!.

The interview proceeded as usual and the next day they called to say I had gotten the position. The package was quite impressive too. I mean it was ALOT of money being offered but I didn’t think too much of it because there are some senior designers in the field that earn that well. I accepted, perhaps because of the large offer but also because it didn’t seem all that bad after the interview. I was to to start the following day , which was a Wednesday.

I got there early and was greeted by the same middle aged lady, at the back Sam had been waiting for me. She pulled up a chair next to her. The table was still covered in papers and there was not a single spot for me to sit my lap top down. I sat there quietly for about a few moments. I had suddenly seen something running across the room, it was probably a rat. I jumped to my feet knocking down a stack of papers at the edge of the table. The table became visible exposing a section filled with holes , scratches and what looked like dried blood.

Blood rushed down to my feet and my heart almost fell out of my mouth as I began having an internal attack. I said: “Oh no , was that a rat? I hate rats. I have some rat poison in my car. I'll be right back”. I left my lap top behind and walked as if nothing was wrong. As soon as I reached my car, I booked it. I didn’t even blink or look back, I sped back home.

I contemplated going back for my lap top and just quitting officially but something in me didn’t even want to move off the couch I had been seated in for almost 2 hours.

A few days later, there was a spur of out roar on the news. A body of a young boy in his 20’s had been found in an abandoned house. He was identified and images of him were being displayed on the news. The house he had been found at had flashed on the screen. It was the same house. I felt queasy and light headed. I remembered having left my lap top there and thought the police might suspect me but no evidence was found at the site.

I tried to find him on Facebook and google. I finally found him online and read through his profile . My fingers finally stopped scrolling when I read “Studied: Graphic Design”.

Had it not been for the rat, I would not have knocked over the papers, left and the Graphic Designer on the news would have definitely been me.
