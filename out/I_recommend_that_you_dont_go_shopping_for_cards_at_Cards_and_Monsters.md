I have been playing YuGiOh since i was a kid. I watched almost every anime, played few games, and i collect physical cards and play in real life. Yu-Gi-Oh became my hobby that i probably would never grow out of, since it's so dear to my heart. With each generation and each new edition i was happy to experiment and learn new summoning methods, new decks and archetypes and combos that became possible with new cards. It brought me many good memories But recently i had a strange experience that i have to share. Take this as a warning. 

I have a friend named Samantha, who was also a very big fan of Yu-Gi-Oh. We met at a local tournament. I was excited to play with my all time favorite deck, Gladiator Beasts, group of anthropomorphic animals who can fuse together without needing a spell, into big powerful animal warriors. I noticed that one of the only girls here was a blonde girl in green turtle neck sweater and long brown skirt. I decided to have a duel with her, and she happily accepted my offer. I expected her to play a girly or cutesy archetype, like Melodious Divas or Madolces.. but she played Dinosaurs and absolutely destroyed my Gladiators. We eventually became friends after our duel, complimenting each others skills and card choices. Ever since that day we were very close.

Samantha was my source of news for new cards, leaks and new content for the franchise. Cause somehow she menaged to find a lot more info about upcoming cards than i do. And from her i found out about the new, at the time, box set by the name of "Supreme Darkness", which supposedly contained new wave of support for Evil Heroes, Speedroids, Arcana Force and.. Gladiators. Imagine my face when i heard that my favorite archetype will finally get support. Samantha was more excited about Speedroids, an archetype of machine monsters themed around different toys from the anime. Samantha told me when the set will come out, and we marked our calendars so as soon as the day comes, we can get packs with our money. My job allowed me to afford an entire box of these cards, because my boss and i have good relationships and because i am very helpful, he raised my payment recently. So i planned to get all the cards from the set to make my old deck stronger and come back with a new and improved deck.

Problem was, we were impatient, and or excitement and curiosity led us to this situation. Like i said before, Sammy somehow menaged to find all the interesting info about the game. But one day, she came to my house with a big grin on her face. When i asked why she was smiling, she told me that she found a weird store that had the set on the shelf days earlier. It's no secret that sometimes, some people and countries get new stuff early, and some stores can probably get new item in their storage before the date they are supposed to he put on shelves. I was a bit curious, but at the same time, it sounded like some sort of joke. Samantha actually thought that maybe it's our chance to get the cards earlier. I shrugged and out of curiosity, i decided that we could at least check and see if what she saw was not a bootleg or a fake with horribly translated cards inside.

We arrived to the store on my car. The store's neon sign read "Cards and Monsters", very creative. Next to word cards was a card soldier, kinda like ones you see in Disney's Alice in Wonderland movie, and next to word Monsters there was a dragon. The store itself looked kinda old, i thought it was maybe an old store that was repurposed. I couldn't see the inside of the store, because the windows were really dark, so much so that i couldn't figure out if the lights are off or the glass is just dark. Sammy decided to enter the store, so she grabbed the handle and pushed it. I expected the store to be closed, but the sound of wind chimes proved me wrong. 

When i entered, i thought that maybe we made a mistake. Cause it didn't look like your average card store. It looked like a book store. If you ever been to a book store, you probably know the layout. Shelves everywhere, a table with few books for sale or books of the week, different sections for each genre.. only instead of books, they had cards. Boxes of cards of different origins. Magic, Pokemon, Digimon TCG and of course, Yu-Gi-Oh. I looked at the assortment of different cards, and soon realized that something was missing.. there was no owner nor a single worker. I thought that maybe we came at the wrong time and owner went to get lunch, forgetting to close the store, but we came at 11 am, it was too early for lunch. 

Sammy eventually found the section with Yu-Gi-Oh cards.. and she was right. The pack was there, weeks before it's release, sitting on the shelf with a price tag. I couldn't believe my eyes. And it was not fake, it had the date, the licencing and everything, i couldn't really judge it too early though. Sammy suggested i grab an entire box, but i told her that i don't want to spend too much money on entire box of what could be bootleg cards, so i just grabbed few packs for me and her. 

But my eyes noticed something else.. another box that i haven't seen. I looked at Sammy for a moment with a finger pointing at it. Sam was also very confused, which surprised me, cause she always seemed to know about everything that will get released in the future. It was a box with name "Doom of Dimensions", she haven't heard of it, neither did I. I decided to grab 5 packs from the box and see what they contained. We went to pay for the packs, but no one was around. Samantha jokingly told me that we could steal them, but i didn't want to seem like a scalper or a thief. I decided to write a note to whoever owned the place and leave the money as payment. As we were leaving, i looked back and saw that boxes got refilled. I thought it was my imagination. 

When we came back to my place, we opened packs of Supreme Darkness first. As i opened the packs, i checked for signs of legitimacy, such as id numbers, copyrights and so on. Those were indeed real cards. As i opened more packs in search for support for my deck i heard Sam speak.

"Those are legit."

"What do you mean? Which ones are legit?"

"Doom of Dimensions. Dude, we have cards in our hands that aren't even available yet! It probably doesn't even exist yet."

"..How is that even possible. No rumours, no signs of it being made, not even a word about this set."

"I have no idea.. But, if they have these cards in store.. Do you think that they will have other packs that we don't know about?"

This store has to have some sort of ties to Konami. No, it would've been too risky to sell boxes that aren't even out yet or even revealed. There was no possible explanation that made sense.. only paranormal explanations came into my mind. We stumbled upon a strange strore that somehow menages to have cards from far future in it. At the time of writing this.. the box we found turned out to actually be real, coming out in September.. 10 months after we found it. We were intrigued and excited, our curiosity made us want to see what Konami has in store for next months and years. So we planned to go to the store again, some other time.

After few weeks, we returned. Samantha was excited and she burst through the door as soon as i parked my car near the entrance, like a kid going to the store to get a new toy. As i looked around, the store was still empty. Either we came at the wrong time again, or the store doesn't even have an owner. Maybe it was one of those stores with no cashiers, i thought. I looked at different cards and sets for different trading card games that laid on the table with other various boxes and sets. Surprisingly, i found a few sets that i haven't seen before. A pokemon card set with what seems to be Zygarde attached to a blimp or a nuke. That was strange, but this was how i found out about Zygarde getting a mega evolution.

Samantha called me and i came to see what she found. That's when i noticed that she shelf was almost endless. The store wasn't that large, but couldn't see the end. Sam snapped me out of my trance and pointed at a box set with what seems to be Borreload dragon on the cover, a monster from one of the seasons of anime who was famous for having plenty of forms that seen play in competitive scene. I looked at other packs, and one caught my eye. What i really did not expect was to see Vehicroid support on the box. Vehicroids were cards with cartoony machines on them, they weren't really that good in the game because they couldn't work too well with each other. But i grabbed a few packs, and Sam grabbed few from one of the furthest ones. I put money on the counter and looked back at the shelf.. the boxes got refilled. I was not tripping. 

Even though i was excited for our next findings, i couldn't shake off the feelings that what we were doing was right. We literally look into the future and get cards that don't even exist yet. Is this really okay? Each time we went to that store, we would buy new packs, store would be empty as usual, leave, the shelves get restocked, and i would check what i got at home. But one thing i noticed was that it felt like the shelf.. started to get shorter. Little by little. I thought i was seeing things again. I felt like something was off about that place, it felt too good to be true..

Sammy and I decided to go to the store once again, because Sammy was too eager to get new cards for her brand new deck. I just decided to not get any cards at all, and instead explore the store. As i explored, I found a door. A door for employees only room, hidden out of sight behind shelves. Maybe it led to storage area, i thought. I grabbed the handle and twisted it out of curiosity. And to my surprise, it opened, it was not even locked. The room was dusty and dark, i had hard time holding my sneezes inside. It led to a basement area. I used my phone's flashlight to go down, and found a small room with table, few chairs, shelves, a tv and even a bunch of papers. 

I looked around in the dark, the light switch didn't work so i couldn't turn the lights on. I explored until i tripped on something. I pointed the flashlight at whatever that was, only to find a dead body of a person. I jumped at the sight of it, breath quickened and I was ready to go upstairs, but i calmed myself down and tried to inspect the body first to see cause of death and who the unlucky fella was. I took a look at him, broken neck, broken mug on the floor, lying on his back. Due to his close distance to the stairs, i assumed that he was on his way upstairs but tripped and tumbled down, breaking his bones in process. His clothes looked like a uniform, and he had a badge, so he must've been a worker. Eric Mitch, that was his name. I took a look at the table with the documents on it, and noticed what seemeed to be a log or a documentation of sorts, written by the worker. It was written with a type writer of all things, pretty old looking thing. I decided to sit down and look through it quickly.

This guy was documenting strange occurrences in this store since it was reopened. First nothing unusual happened. Until at one point, a customer found a box set that they didn't have at the store. He didn't know what to think of it, so he tried to tell the customer that they don't sell these, but that wouldn't make sense, since it should be on the shelf, where else would they find it. Be decided to just give the box set to the customer for a price and let them go. Eventually he noticed that sheleves seemed to have more products on them that he and his co-workers weren't familiar with or have on the list. That didn't stop them from taking advantage of this strange anomaly, so they started selling these for a price of normal boxes. Every time they would sell them, the shelves would be restocked on their own, which was odd. The last pages describe how workers would disappear or just leave for whatever reason, leaving Eric as the only worker. He also mentioned that one customer asked why the box they wanted was missing, but when he checked it was still ont the shelf, but they insisted that it's not there. He started to also notice that length of their shelves would extend and shorten with time, just what i experienced. Last page described a bunch of incidents involving customers he was familiar with dying. One got hit by a car, the other had an accident at work. The writing seemed to get cut off. I assumed that this must be a point where he wanted to go upstairs and fell. 

I felt uneasy, what could this mean? My brain tried to come up with an explanation, which eventually led to me forming a terrifying theory of what was going on. This store is not normal. It gives people opportunity to get cards and products from the future out of nowhere. Mere presence in the store and interaction with said products leads to them slowly disappearing off the shelves. And that's when it hit me. What if every product on the shelf is a certain point in time.. and if it disappears.. maybe we are losing years off our life!? It didn't make sense, and it sounded crazy, but what am i even supposed to believe at this point? All these thoughts ran through my head and i started to panic more and more, i had to leave with Sammy before things go bad. I went upstairs and saw Sammy with a disappointed look.

"Dude, you won't believe it. Doom of Dimensions is gone! I was gonna buy it today, but it's not here. Have they run out packs? Also where have you been?"

That's when i took a look at the shelf.. it was shorter than last time i saw it. Some box sets were gone off the shelf completely. Boxes that i saw on shelf many weeks and days ago were gone. The shelf got shorter.. but problem was. Doom of Dimensions was still on the shelf. My heart jumped. Document, it mentioned same thing. I couldn't get take it anymore. I grabbed Sammy's hand and told her that we are leaving. She didn't want to go, but i told her that i will explain to her what happened later. We ran out of the store and got into the car. Driving off to my house.

I explained to her everything. The man, the note, the anomalies in the store and the fact that we might have risked our lives for the sake of getting cards early. Sammy clearly didn't know what to say, and neither did i. I felt worried, nervous for what have happened. Where do we go from here? Sammy's positive demeanour changed, and she became very quiet. We had hard time talking about the game or any news. Cause we would get reminded that we already knew what next cards were gonna be. We felt no excitement, just dread from realisation that we may not live too long to witness sets of packs we bought at that store. Especially Sammy.. who apparently went to the store without me several times, and i didn't even know. 

It's been months since the last venture to the store. The store is still standing and people still visit it, not knowing what awaits them inside. I burnt the cards that i got from the store, along with the gladiator cards i got. As much as i liked them, i don't know why, but i felt safer afterwards. Can't explain why. I still play YuGiOh, but i buy cards from stores that i know and support my local businesses. For now, i've been doing alright. Can't say the say about Sammy. Recently, she went to her grandma's place in the other city. But during her trip on a taxi, a speeding vehicle crashed into it and killed both her and the driver, she snapped her neck from the knockback. It happened several days before the release of Doom of Dimensions in the US. 

I hope she is in a better place.. and if my time comes, we could see each other again..
