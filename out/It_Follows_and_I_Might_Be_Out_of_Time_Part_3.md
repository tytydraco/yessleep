I don't know if we can stay ahead of it much longer. We're so exhausted. Travelling or failing at our only goal is.... it hurts. It sucks. I think I need to wrap this up soon or I may not get to tell it all. Thank you for keeping an eye out while we do what we can.

I awoke a while later as the evening got darker, body stiff from sleeping on the floor. Bleary eyed, I blinked against the light of my phone going off. It was Evan. Again. I resigned to the inevitable, hitting the green icon. 

"Hey you."

"Don't 'hey you' me, I've been calling for hours, are you okay?" A wave of guilt, followed by shame, washed over me. 

"I don't think so. I think..." I didn't want to say it. I whispered the words like a secret. "I think I'm going crazy, Evan. The police seem to think so too and I can't prove either of us wrong."

"I'm packing my bags now, tell me everything." I squeezed my blanket to me, wishing it was him. I'd do anything to have him home. I told him about what I woke up to, how our neighbors saw me with a knife, how it all disappeared. I couldn't bring myself to tell him what this thing looked like and make myself sound further gone. How law enforcement acted. I fell silent as the last wind of it went out of me. I could hear him zip his duffel.

"What are you doing now?" I looked up at the underside of the bed. I tugged the blanket lying over me a little higher. The motion sent a sharp stab through my foot, toes to ankle, making me gasp and twitch. I smacked my head off the metal of the frame, crying out as my hand instinctively flew to my forehead. 

"Babe?" 

"Hold on," I grunted, clumsily kicking off the blanket. I tried to look at my foot, to find the source of the burning throb. I couldn't get a good view, so I started crawling out from under the bed… and I was dragging myself over that plaster. I stared at it, flooded with something like relief and even more fear. Was I hallucinating again? I got to my hands and knees and then sat with my legs out. I put the phone back to my ear as I bent my leg, pulling my foot up for a better look. A shard of light fixture stuck out of it, embedded deep in my heel. I stared at it, not daring to take my eyes off the bloody wound. 

"I'm switching to video chat, tell me what you see." He didn’t say anything as I turned the camera on and around, lowering it.

“What the hell is in your foot?”

He could see it. It had to be real, there was no way whatever this thing was could send a hallucination across the ocean. I shook with the thought, the relief, the feeling of clarity. The pain in my foot felt like a significant triumph.

“That my love, means I am definitely not crazy.” I pressed the screen to flip the camera back around to face me. Focusing in, I realized he was getting into a car. “You weren’t kidding about being on your way. I can’t wait.” I was startled to suddenly be fighting tears.

 

“Are you sitting on the floor?” I nodded, not daring to try and talk.

“Get a hotel, put it on my card–”

“I’m not sure it works like that, sweetie.” The pause from the other end of the line went on far too long. I couldn’t read the look on his face, but I could almost feel him thinking and calculating.

“What doesn’t work like that?” If I was gonna be honest, I thought I might as well be thorough.

“I’m pretty sure whatever this is lives upstairs now.”

“Did you just call the upstairs neighbor a ‘what’?” I bit my lip.

“I saw it when I was outside. It was wearing his hat but… it isn’t him anymore.” I knew how it sounded, how I looked. Still, it had to be true. I looked down at my foot, trying to remind myself.

“Okaaay, okay, okay, okay. I don’t like that. I do not like this, you better not be messing around Mimi or I might actually have a stroke–” Three soft knocks at the door snapped me away from him, back into the room, so fully that Evan stopped mid sentence. Then started again:

“I should have installed that damn camera–”

“Shhh….” I got up, trying to mind the glass in my heel and not drop my phone. I tiptoed closer, flinching at more knocking. My phone buzzed; I looked down, seeing Evan’s pale worried face. There was a pop-up text from a restricted number at the top of the screen: *It’s Officer Gedrick.*

“It’s one of the officers. He just texted me.”

“Do you want me to stay?”

“No, get to the airport, get home to me, we’ll talk in a bit.”

“I love you.”

“Love you too.” I hung up, and took a breath, bracing for whatever the policeman might be bringing to my doorstep. *Maybe an arrest?* That was too much to hope for. I unlocked the deadbolt and opened the door as quietly as possible. He was no longer in uniform and looked petrified. His dark eyes flicked down to his outstretched hand, which held a small slip of paper. I took it, waving Gedrick in. He shook his head, eyes glued to the exact carnage of glass and plaster he couldn’t see earlier. I studied him for a few seconds, trying to piece together what this was. Realizing there was only one way to find out, I read the note.

*1. It will follow you.*

*2. It will try to wear you.*

*3. Kill it with fire.*

"Officer--" he gently grabbed my hand, face begging me to quiet down.

'What is it?' I whispered. He shook his head again, but squeezed my fingers. I studied his face, his hair, a beautiful earring he now wore off duty. I already knew, but his manner put a different weight on seeing it: he was Native American.

*Look up your symptoms, seek other kinds of help.* He wasn't dismissing me. He was advising me. He wouldn't speak of it or come into my home, leaving only one explanation: it might latch onto him if he does. I nodded.

'Thank you,' I mouthed. He gave me one last worried look and nearly ran down the steps, disappearing into the dark. It felt lonely watching him go. He helped as much as he could but I was on my own. I slowly shut the door, limping to the bathroom, more and more aware of a deep ache in my heel. I needed to do something or go get something done. I sat on the edge of the tub, stretching to get another good look at the cut. It was deep but narrow. I'd stepped on a nail and saw more bleeding when I was younger; I was pretty confident I could take care of it myself. I had to bite into a towel. Watch my tweezers slip and slip on the bloody shard as it cut into its flesh prison all over again. It was like dragging a saw blade out of my foot..... but when it was out. Dripping and whole. Even in my trembling state, I grinned. 

Whatever was mocking, mimicking and fucking with me, could be killed. It was real enough that a lawman didn’t dare to take it on. That solid fact drove away the doubt wrecking me, leaving my mind feeling so much clearer; it was eager to get to work. 

So far, it seemed to dance around interacting with me, destroying my ceiling and sanity instead of using those terrible teeth. It occurred to me with a chill as I crossed the bathroom to get some peroxide: maybe it couldn’t use them for some reason. *Otherwise it could have eaten me in my sleep.* As I finished cleaning and bandaging my foot, a plan began to form. I'd research my symptoms-- the illusions, copycatting, its apparent disdain for my ceiling. Something with teeth. I'd study it back, try to see how sounds from my place affected what it did. I wasn’t wasting another moment. This had to end.

I got up, feeling my calf start to burn from the effort of keeping pressure off of my heel. I realized with a small wave of dread, this could prove to be a problem if I have to run.

*It will follow you,* the words echoed in my head. Okay, maybe running wasn’t even an option. Not unless it was dying. I scanned the small living area, finally spotting my target. I tiptoed over, and slipped on house shoes to protect my feet while I cleaned. That was the last bit of quiet for a while; I decided if that thing wanted to get pissy, I’d make it worth it. After I picked up the big pieces, I went to get the vacuum from the office. I plugged it in, and slowly, thoroughly swept the plaster sprinkled through the whole of my little home. I thought I could hear something above the loud whirring and was relieved to find only quiet once I turned off the machine. I retracted the cord, and started dragging it back to its spot next to my dresser. I hit the short hallway, and felt… something. It was close to that same feeling of primal terror that kept finding me; chilly static rippled over me, again. I knew now what my body kept telling , screaming at me, collapsing under: it was here. My gut told me I should be looking at it. I knew it was staring at me. So closely I was almost certain I could smell it. A whiff of sweet and rancid, buried in earth seemed to surround me.

The cold was something else. The cold of blood leaving the surface of my skin and diving deep made me shiver, but my face felt almost hot. It was disorienting for a moment. Above the smell, the iciness, the terrifying confusion, was absolute fury. It was shaking me as much as the turn of temperature. Anger kept my cheeks hot and my mind right in that moment.

“You’re a fucking coward.” My voice was stronger than I felt, another courtesy of blind rage.

“Show yourself.” A few silent moments gave way to the sudden urge to look up. It was like my own eyes had been holding it back. Not wanting to see why my ceiling was ruined. What it worked so hard to hide.

It was growing out of him, through him, white bone poked from its shoulders, its knees, elbows, some even pierced through the poor man’s forehead. Its teeth ended only inches from my face. Its milky white eyes hovered beneath them, an upside down mockery of the skin my neighbor once wore. I had no idea that much hate could live behind such a blank stare. I felt it burning through me. I had plenty of my own to unleash, but it was doused by instinct. It took every bit of me to muster something other than a bloodcurdling scream.

“This is your only warning. Get. Out. Go. Home.” I heard the sickening grind of flesh between bones as its head tilted. A crunchy and wet sound that matched its growing stench, the need to gag was overwhelming. Especially when it sounded like it was trying to breathe; it was hollow, burbly, like moving dirt just to speak. I tightened my grip on the vacuum, knowing there wasn’t enough room to swing the fucking thing before it could attack. It took another disgusting breath. 

“No home. Only hunt.” Its voice sounded ancient, unused.

“Hunt someone else,” I demanded, trying to keep the panic out of my voice.

“Soon I will.” I didn’t need but a moment to understand its meaning.

“Do it then.” I dropped the vacuum, spreading my arms. “Do it you fucking critter, finish your hunt!” I needed to confirm, even if this bluff killed me. I waited for it to pounce on me, shred my skin and wear it. I watched the mist stir behind its dead gaze. To my relief and surprise, it remained frozen. Stuck to the ceiling like a deformed and rotting bat. Still staring.

“All those teeth and you can’t use them.” I jumped as a choking, thunking sound erupted from it. I backed away, kicking the vacuum out of my way, knowing in my soul: it was laughing. Its legs and arms stretched in unnatural ways, pulling it towards me. I retreated as quickly as I could, but it was on me, leaping down.

Its body felt like jumping into an ice cold river. There was something paralyzing about being underneath it. It was painful, like a thousand smacks, punches, pokes all over. I thought I screamed, but it was among hundreds of screams suddenly piercing my ears. Screams I knew. Shrieks that were mine. My sister’s. My mom’s. It screamed and stunk above me, somehow familiar and otherworldly all at once. I could smell my childhood, feel its violence, the constant fear that lived under that dirt and rot. It was like I’d been buried with them. Maybe for moments. It could have been years. I felt myself separate from it like I used to. It made every second feel like forever and nothing at all. The last thing I remember was a single word as it let me go: 

“Delicious.”

It wasn’t much later that the world came back. I could smell something coppery and sweet, I think it may have been what stirred me. It took me a moment to figure out what it was. My stomach turned. I could feel the heat of my own breath brushing back against my cheeks, like something may be blocking it. I tried to control it. To ignore every ache in my body. It was strange; I’d never woken up so quietly alert. Maybe the scent of blood kept me laying in place, eyes closed, unmoving. I found myself thinking about bears, how you’re supposed to play dead if it’s a grizzly. Those thoughts fled as more plaster came raining down, sprinkling me, terrifying me.

I couldn’t scream with the angle of my turned head, otherwise I would have. I fought every instinct that told me to run. I laid there, hoping it would get bored. I tried to distract myself with a plan, but I quickly found… all I could think about was it. I tried to think of… what was his name? My love, he was gone for some reason. A reason locked behind wherever this creature had me. 

*No.* Despair threatened to give me away. I’d done something that gave it access, let it not just into my home… but my mind. My soul. It would work its way through every piece of me until it was wearing my skin. This was how it began. It didn’t want to kill me. It wanted to torture me. It wasn’t eating my flesh, but I could almost feel where its claws began its work on my insides. Mind and body, I felt weak. Raw.

*Pretending will not save you.*

I jolted, eyes opening against my will. The voice that just filled my head was nothing compared to the dead brown eyes only a couple of inches from mine. A growing pool of blood had nearly reached my lips, I screamed, sitting up and knocking over my end table, trying to crawl away from the body. Away from Officer Gedrick.

“Oh my God–”

*There is no God.* I clamped my hands over my ears, desperate to keep it out.

*Only nature. Your friend knew that.* 

“Please,” I begged, trying to think of something, anything where was my… I used it all the time, that’s where I last saw him, this man who wanted to help. “Dammit!” I yelled, ripping my useless hands away from my useless head. I looked up to where I knew it had been hovering. It was here but not appearing. I tried not to tremble but I couldn’t keep tears from falling.

“What… what did I do?” My eyes scanned my wrecked apartment. It felt like I was waiting for ages. I jumped when it spoke again.

*I knew there was something most delectable in you, and the hunt has been worth it. Oh so worth it.* I could feel something come online in my head, something critical: I needed to figure out how it got in. It may be my only way of getting it… like the mist behind its eyes, my train of thought evaporated.

*If you try that… well, do it and see.* 

With a pathetic whimper, I collapsed to my knees. “Just…” I wiped my eyes. “Tell me. Why.”

*No.* 

I felt my chest squeeze as I was wracked with more sobs. I knew something was going on, that this whole situation had come from somewhere, but even that was quickly leaving me. I didn’t know why I was crying anymore, who was in my head laughing, making it impossible to think. 

*Once you join us, you will get to taste how sweet this is, Miranda. How unique you are.* A face, his face, broke through the suffocating nothing. I gasped, not knowing who he was but knowing he was mine. He disappeared again.

*I think I can let you keep that for a while. You will have to search for it.*

“For what?” I asked, feeling faint.

*You humans are all the same in one respect* it continued in my mind. A scuff from above drew my gaze, and for the first time, I was watching its path through my home. It was a miracle that there was any plaster left for it to break. I tracked it as it moved, tensing up as it started crawling towards me. 

*You reach a point where you would rather die than be in your body. Your mind. I can sense it lurking in you, Miranda. Always waiting. You’re closer to that point than you believe... and that’s where you’ll be living for a very long time.*
