This was by no means my dream home, but it was a cheaper place to stay than my last one and a lot closer to work. The real estate agent was giving me the whole tour and then we went into the basement and that’s when I saw it, at the end of the basement hallway was a large iron door. “We couldn’t get that open and it seemed to be rusted shut, don’t worry we think its just an old food storage room.” I wasn’t really worried about it; in fact, I was curious as to what may have been behind that door. I signed the paperwork and for 280,000$ the two-bedroom, one bathroom was mine.

It was about a month in, and I had fully completed the move, I then procured tools needed to breach the iron door under my house, I used saws-all, Blow torches and prybars. After a week of working on it, I finally got the door to come off its hinges. I backed away as it fell to the ground with a loud echoing thud, and then looked on the other side of the frame to see a large mine, complete with structure beams and a minecart that stood motionless.

The first thing I did was call my friends, Ashley and Jack, to come take a look at it, they fancied themselves urban explorers and if anyone was going to have the right tools for the job it would be them. Jack was thrilled as hell, he thought it might have been an abandoned gold mine, Ashley on the other hand was skeptical about why it was abandoned and locked in the first place. I for one should have listened to Ashley.

We spent the day acquiring gear, Ropes, flashlights, provisions, also pencil and paper for a map, and finally a camcorder. We ventured down into the Mines opening, small and claustrophobic, it was so dead silent I could hear the sound of water coming from further in the caves. “Maybe there’s an underground river nearby.” Jake says enthusiastically. As we walked through the tunnels, we could see that they seemed to be mining coal, it was getting harder to distinguish things because the walls were starting to get covered in thick webs, layer upon layers of sticky silk stretched across the beams and even trying to block our path. Jake had a pocketknife and was able to cut through it for us, but it dulled the blade and was a daunting task.

“What the hell could make a web that big?”

I immediately got my answer when we shined our light down the hallway as it illuminated the biggest spider I had ever seen in my life. It skittered into a rock fissure above us, but it was so big I could hear its sickening footsteps across the wall. Its legs were long, black and spindly, it had a green pattern on its back and eight large eyes that reflected light. “D-did you guys see that? no way I imagined it.” Jake continued to walk forward and as he did, his foot stepped on something that almost caused him to trip. It was a human skull, looking around we could see the skeletal remains of many, each wearing miners’ hats, and each bound to the walls with cobwebs.

That’s when we noticed that mine went into a large cavern, and when we shinned our lights on it our blood collectively ran cold. At the heart of this cavern was a colossal spider the size of a small house or large shed, eight eyes reflected the light back at us and venom dripped from fangs that looked more like katana blades. Surrounding it were dozens upon dozens of spiders like the one we had seen earlier. We turned around and we booked it. We didn’t give them a chance to catch up to us, though as we ran through the webbing, we could hear skittering across the walls as though they were giving pursuit, luckily for us they weren’t fast.

Ashely dropped the camcorder and grabbed the map as we ran through the tunnels, we could hear the sound of crawling fade away and noticed it made the same sound as what we thought was running water, we figured this meant they had given up the chase as we got further away. As soon as we made it back to the surface, I wasted no time in packing everything up, and getting the hell out of there hoping to stay at a hotel until I could sell the house and get a new one. The next day I went back to the house to repack everything back up to put in a storage unit for as long as it took me to find a house that wasn’t teeming with spiders. I told them that I managed to open the iron door and the mine began seeping poisons gas into the house. I didn’t tell them about the spiders because they wouldn’t believe me.

I am writing this on my laptop from a hotel, nerves shot with a newfound arachnophobia. Jake and Ashley don’t talk about the mines, or the event and they have given up on urban exploring. But the thing that bothers me is, if those spiders were down there for so long…What or who were they feeding on?
