A year ago I lived a life of ease and happiness, I remember getting a call from my friend telling me to move back to the United Kingdom for a business project that we were working on while I was living overseas. I agreed and made my way back but instead of where I'm initially from I moved to a smaller area that I was unfamiliar with. Months go by with no issues but then one day I meet this girl while she's working. After several times of going to the same place for months, I decided to just speak to her. She immediately took down my contact details and we grew closer over the month. It was like one of those cliche movie scenes. With both of us in our early adulthood, both younger than 21. I wanted to be serious insisting on meeting her family. It happened and there were no issues. I go to sleep that night thinking I've made the right decision until I wake up abruptly from a call. I answer the phone asking who it is and turns out it is the girl's mother. 'Don't ever talk to her again you must be manipulating her, she's changing because of you' etc. I am being accused of being manipulative over things which the average person would find hysterical like encouraging the girl to not straighten her hair and keep it natural and etc and I was also threatened over the phone. Being extremely confused I keep it moving and don't think much of it until I run into the girl unexpectedly in public. Coincidentally her family member saw us and ran over yelling and giving me death threats involving gun violence. This was a person everyone knows that also runs a successful business so I was surprised.   


I tried to stay away and the girl had become very upset because of it but she kept telling me everything is okay and that there is no problem and that she could sort it all out so I stayed in the background. All until one day someone set up a secret camera in her living space and recorded her being on the phone to me. That evidence of us still talking caused a chain of issues and I've been threatened by her family on multiple occasions from making fake stories about me and posting them trying to 'expose' me, leaking the call (which they tried to gaslight me into believing I have said something wrong in which I know I haven't), harassing me, sending people to my house, threatening to get me shot and much more.  


I somehow managed to talk my way into being civil and agreed to the terms of the family to not contact the girl but they also tried to get me to commit a crime and lie to law enforcement and say that she has been stalking me when she hasn't been anything but supportive and on my side this whole time. A few days ago I got a random call and I picked it up. It was the girl warning me that her family might try to come after me in some sort of way. This is nothing new, she has already in the past told me that they will try to blackmail me and she gave me consent to record a call between us with her proving I have done nothing wrong.  


Fast forward to today. I have gotten the phone call and again comes a threat to my physical safety. What shall I do?
