I didn’t sleep that night.

I lay in bed, blanket pulled up to my chin, staring at the faint strip of light creeping under my bedroom door. I tried to convince myself it was from a streetlamp outside, from my alarm clock, from anything other than that door. But I knew better.

Because I could hear it. The slow creak of hinges straining. The almost imperceptible shuffle of something shifting in the dark. The whispering. Always the whispering.

By dawn, my mind was made up. I needed to leave. Permanently.

I didn’t bother packing much—just grabbed a duffel bag, stuffed it with clothes and my laptop, and made for the front door. But the moment my hand touched the knob, I heard something behind me.

Not knocking this time.

Breathing.

It was slow, heavy, deliberate. Right behind me.

I turned.

The door in the hallway was open.

Not just a crack. Not just a sliver of darkness peeking through. It was wide open, revealing that same impossible hallway stretching far beyond what my apartment should contain. The stale scent of damp earth and dust rolled over me. The whispering had stopped.

And then, from the shadows, something stepped forward.

I didn’t wait to see what it was.

I bolted.

I sprinted down the hallway, yanked open my front door—

And ran straight into my landlord.

“Oof—hey, hey, where’s the fire?” he asked, steadying himself. His face twisted in irritation as he took me in—disheveled, wide-eyed, breathing like I’d just run a marathon. “You look like hell.”

“There’s something in my apartment,” I gasped.

His eyes narrowed. “What kind of something?”

I turned to point—

The door was gone.

Just smooth, blank drywall.

I swallowed hard, my pulse a chaotic drum in my ears. I stared at the empty space where it had been, my mind struggling to make sense of it. The hallway, the whispering, the thing that had been right there—

Gone.

Just like that.

My landlord sighed, rubbing his temples. “Listen, I don’t know what’s going on with you, but you’re scaring the other tenants. Maybe take a break, get some fresh air. Sleep.”

I wanted to argue. To make him believe me. But what could I say? That a door had magically appeared and led to an impossible hallway? That something had been breathing behind me, whispering to me from the dark?

I shook my head. “Forget it.”

I brushed past him and left the building.


---

For three days, I stayed away. Crashed at a friend’s place, avoided my apartment like it was cursed—which, for all I knew, it was. I ignored the calls from my landlord, the texts from my neighbor asking if I was okay.

I almost convinced myself that I’d imagined the whole thing.

Until the fourth night.

When I came home.

I shouldn’t have. Every instinct screamed at me to stay away. But I was tired. I wanted my own bed. Just one night. Just to grab some real clothes and find a hotel.

I stepped inside cautiously. The apartment was silent. Normal.

The door wasn’t there.

I exhaled, almost laughing at myself. Maybe I really had imagined it. Maybe it had been exhaustion, stress, a waking nightmare.

Then I saw my phone.

It was still on the floor where I’d dropped it in my rush to leave. I picked it up and tapped the screen. The battery was dead, but before it blacked out completely, I caught a glimpse of the last photo I’d taken.

The one of the door.

But it wasn’t just the door in the picture anymore.

There was something standing in the doorway.

Tall. Thin. Limbs stretched too long.

And it was smiling.

The knocking started again that night.
