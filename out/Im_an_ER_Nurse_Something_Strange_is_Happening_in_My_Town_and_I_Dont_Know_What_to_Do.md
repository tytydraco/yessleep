First, I’m not really sure how to even start this post. I’ve never been someone that turns to an online group for medical questions. But because of what has been happening lately, I can’t shake a nagging feeling that something is really off in my town and I needed to talk with someone about it. With a *lot* of hesitation I finally confided to a close friend about all this hoping they wouldn't think I was losing it. Thankfully they listened and suggested I share what's going on here so I'm going to give it a try. 

A quick disclaimer. As a nurse, I take patient privacy and confidentiality very seriously. Because of HIPAA regulations, I won’t be using any real names, places, or other “identifiable” details. I've changed descriptions of patients, cases, and locations because of privacy rules. I want to share my experiences without crossing the lines for the trust and safety of my patients I take care of. So, if anything seems vague, it’s because I’m being cautious—better safe than sorry as I don’t want to jeopardize my career for this.

Let me share a little about myself and my community first: As I mentioned above, I’m a nurse, and I’ve worked in the ER at Pine Haven Medical Center in Willow Ridge for over a decade. I love what I do. Being an ER nurse is not glamorous. As cliché as it sounds I became a nurse to help people and my job has let me do just that. Pine Haven is a small hospital in a small town. Most of my shifts are spent patching up fishing accidents, treating sprained ankles, or stitching up Friday night bar fight injuries. Nothing exciting like you’d see on a TV medical drama, but I find it rewarding.

Willow Ridge is a small town where everyone knows everyone—or at least, they think they do. It’s hidden away in the southern U.S., surrounded by thick woods and rolling countryside that seem to stretch on forever. We’ve got a little historic downtown with mom-and-pop diners, a hardware store, and a general store that’s been here for as long as anyone here can remember. Our area lake is a big draw, especially for weekend fishermen and the occasional tourist, but honestly, most people just pass through our town without giving us much thought. We all joke about the idea that, if you’re driving through and blink you will probably miss our little community.

One thing about Willow Ridge residents is that they have a really strong sense of privacy. For instance, people don’t talk much about the woods. Let’s just say they’ve always had a creepy reputation. I've always shrugged it off, but sometimes, you can feel it. People joke that the Ridge has a story it doesn’t want to share. I’ve always chalked any odd stories up to old wives' tales or local legends that have been passed down over the years. Every community has folk tales and ours is no different.

Back to why I came here to post. This past week, something happened that I just can’t stop thinking about. Over the weekend, we had three patients come in, all with nearly identical injuries: deep scratches spiraling down their arms or backs. When I first talked with them, took their history and assessed their wounds, I thought maybe they’d been snagged by a thorn bush or maybe gotten into it with a stray cat. But here’s the thing: all three of them told me that they didn’t remember how they got the scratches and their "scratches" were for lack of a better word just weird.

One patient, an older guy I’ll call Mr. Calloway, joked with me saying that the marks looked like some kind of weird symbol. He laughed it off, but I could tell he was really anxious about them. The second patient was a teenage girl whose parents brought her in because her scratches were bleeding too much. She was quiet, and barely looked up from her phone. The third was a young man who looked pale and shaken, like he hadn’t slept in days.

Outside of the weird scratches each of them talked about “a weird smell”. They described a sharp, rotten egg odor that seemed to follow them, even when they were nowhere near where they thought they may have got the scratches. None of us in the ER could smell anything, but the patients swore it was there—metallic, rotten, almost like something burning. The young man said it was so strong it made him nauseous.

I don’t know. Maybe it’s just a coincidence, but three patients in two days? The same pattern of injuries and the same description of the smell? That doesn’t feel random to me.

I’m not jumping to conclusions here—I’m not the kind of person who believes in “aliens” or whatever. I’m a nurse, and I like to think I’m a pretty grounded person. But I can’t help feeling like I’m missing something, and it’s starting to keep me up at night.

Has anyone ever seen or heard of something like this? I don’t know if I’m looking for answers or just trying to get it out of my head, but I’d really appreciate any thoughts.

\*I took a snap of the wound to show the ER doctor that treated the young man and to upload to his medical record as part of my documentation. For some reason I forgot to delete it from my phone. I wanted to share the pic here but was not sure how. I did Google how to post it and hopefully the link below will work.
