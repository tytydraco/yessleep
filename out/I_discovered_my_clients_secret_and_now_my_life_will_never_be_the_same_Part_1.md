It is rare to meet a builder who wanted to be a builder, I certainly didn’t. Most will tell the same tale, throughout school they were either troublemakers or partakers, more concerned about the week ahead than the year beyond and spent more time working on trying to impress girls, than working on homework. Most of the guys I work with finished school with little to show for it, and just like myself, this tale usually ended with your old man dragging you by the rim of your ear to the building site because “that’s all you’re good for”.

This isn’t to say construction is a horrible job, depending on the site you’re on, and the pocket that is funding it, it can make it one of the best jobs in the world. Some people like to make the stereotype about builders that we do nothing all day, this is objectively wrong, we do nothing on *some* days. We have this saying on site: Boss on location? Get to your station, Boss is away? Easy pay. Don’t read this and assume we’re all slackers, we work hard when we need to, it’s just that hourly pay means we will *only* work hard when we need to.

The site I’m working on, or at least was working on, was one of the best gigs I ever had. The company I worked for had secured a massive contract refitting and altering a private home, we’re talking millions of pounds. The house itself was one of those concrete and glass monstrosities, only having one floor it looked as if someone had carefully removed a floor from a high-rise office building and plonked it right in the middle of the rolling hills and meadows of this West England valley. The structure’s cold and rigid appearance was a stark contrast to the flourishing wilderness of the area surrounding it, whenever we approached it on the long and windy road to work, nestled far from society, it always gave the me the impression of a prison. The inside of the house was equally as inviting, with matching concrete walls on the inside and hallways wide enough to fit a small car through, even prior to us ripping out all the old décor, I struggled to imagine anyone feeling cosy in a place like this.

Having only started with the company a year ago fresh out of school, I was still one of the ‘newbies’, and I still found myself at the lowest pecking order of jobs. Some of my exhilarating responsibilities included hauling rubble, removing plaster and mixing cement, jobs that continually made me feel more labourer than builder. Nevertheless, as I rolled my wheelbarrow down the expansive hallways, the nods and “mornins” from passing workers made me feel like I had finally started to accumulate some shreds of respect.

“Finally decided to get some work done today, did we?” Shaun called out as I rounded the corner into the kitchen, not turning his head away from the gas pipes he was fiddling with, “I didn’t expect you to be in after the state you were in last night”.

“That’s because I’m not an old man” I quipped, “I’m surprised you were able to get down here without your walking stick”. Shaun, tall and scrubby, was my best friend on site. Even though he was a good decade older than me, he still acted like a teenager, and he was the first to invite me along for post-work pints with all the other builders.

Shaun flashed a gappy grin, “Only one who needs a walking stick was your mother once I finished with her last night!” he said chuckling hard to himself which quickly transformed into a phlegmy cough. “Fuckin hell” he said wiping spit from his mouth, “on that bombshell lets pop out for a smoke break”.

“Now?” I said raising an eyebrow, “I only just got here?”

“And?” Shaun replied, already walking away.

I threw down my wheelbarrow and followed him. Walking back down the hallway towards the designated smoking area I listened to the symphony of circular saws, power drills, and very crackly Bluetooth speakers.

 “How’s the gas work going” I asked Shaun conversationally.

“Fucked” he said as we stepped outside and he handed me a cigarette, “the guy who’d set it up originally must have been blind, an idiot or both”. He took a long drag on his cigarette and continued, “Tommy was saying to me the other day that the ventilation system looks almost just for show, and Pauls been moaning that the rainwater hasn’t been draining off properly, so we’ve got leaks”. Shaun shook his head disapprovingly “For a multi-million pound build it sure looks like they did it in a rush”.

Before I could think of a joke about hourly and salaried pay, the site manager, who was a small and stout man named David, came through the entrance. “Thought I’d find you two love birds ‘ere” he called out in his gruff northern accent. “Need everyone to make their stations presentable, got the Client coming down today for an afternoon inspection”.

“You mean the Representative?” I asked.

“Nah, well he’s coming too” David said scratching the stubble on his chin “I mean the actual Client, Mr Money-bags, gotta show ‘im where his dosh has been going”.

This took me by great surprise, it had been six months since we had started this contract, and I had not seen the Client once, previously, I thought he had never even visited the property. Instead, once a month, he would send down his ‘Representative’, but even he only came down after hours, the only glimpse I had seen of him was his silhouette shrouded by the tinted windows of his black Mercedes rolling down the drive.

“Best we get to our station then” Shaun said as he let his cigarette drop to the floor and stubbed it with his boot.

“Remember, presentable” David called out as we began walking back to the gas works.

As we made our way back, I noticed that the word had gotten about quickly, workers were sweeping dust into corners, hiding rubble with plastic tarps and tidying away tools that had been trip hazards for the last week.

“You know anything about this fancy client then?” I asked Shaun as we passed a worker loudly cursing as the cement bag he was carrying split, engulfing him in a cloud of dust.

“Only whispers, I reckon he’s the sort of guy to have his fingers in many pies y’know?” Shaun paused to make a passing jest at a worker bent over a circular saw about his sexuality and the straightness of his cuts. “Oh, you know what I did hear?” Shaun said remembering the subject of conversation, “Mark who does the electrics said he knew a bloke who was actually here when this place was built, according to him this place was built to run events, parties n’ such. Though when it was being built there was one of them ‘Representatives’ there every day, real bad energy he said it was. The management must have been bad because apparently, they all got let go right before it was completed, swapped for a different crew.”

“That’s odd” I replied furrowing my brow as an unfortunate thought came time mind. “Maybe we’re about to meet the same fate after they see how little progress we’ve made”.

“Nah I reckon David’ll convince them, after all, progress is built on hours” Shaun said with a wink.

I went with Shaun back down the long corridor, passing the clouds of commotion, we cleaned, but mostly chatted away at our station. We were deep into a lengthy discussion into whether a payment of £10 million pounds was worth having your mode of drinking and urinating permanently swapped when we heard our own music stop.

“Client’s ‘ere” said David, lifting his finger of the speaker power button. “He’s waiting outside at the moment; he wants me to give him a tour while everyone’s to go to the dining room for a ‘message’ from him after”.

Shaun and I shared a glance, he then gestured in a sarcastic bow and waive of his hand, “Best we do not leave our lordship waiting then, after you good sir”.

I took the lead and began filtering into the other handfuls of workers making their way to the dining room. As I walked, my eyes could not help but wander over the exposed electrical wirings, half-finished cladding and still-wrapped furniture, all of which had looked the same for the last few months.

“You think this ‘message’ is going to be us getting the sack?” I asked Shaun, surprised by the carefree look on his face.

“Definitely not” Shaun smirked, “Might get a kick up the arse to try speed us up, but I’m telling you, they’d do the same even if we’d almost finished, no pleasing these people”.

We entered the dining room, joining a mass of other high-vis wearers. The room was on one of the far corners of the house, with its towering windows offering beautiful views of the surrounding landscape. However, the right side of the room offered an even more interesting view. I could just about make out the driveway, where I could see David speaking to the Client and his Representative. I assumed David was talking to the Client, a small, bald man with a tailored navy-blue suit who was patiently nodding along and smiling to David’s ramblings. The Representative, in contrast, was a very tall and chiselled man in a dark suit, wearing black sunglasses and holding a large briefcase, he kept his expression flat, almost like a statue.

“Hey, look its Lurch!” Shaun half-whispered to the group which was met by a few snickers.

“What?” I asked.

“Look, Lurch? From the Addams Family?” Shaun said pointing to the Representative, I raised my shoulders quizzically. Shaun sighed, “Forget it, sometimes I forget you’re just a wee baby”.

Before I could form my own remark, my attention was moved to David. He was nodding frantically and gesturing towards the entrance, the Client gave a quick nod to his Representative who, clutching his briefcase, made his way into the property. After a brief moment of talk, the Client clasped his hands together and waived his hand in invitation for David to lead and they both walked in, disappearing from view.

Turning back around to face the room, each of the builders had formed their respective conversation circles, I noticed Shaun had already begun regaling a story to a group about certain items he was able to keep hidden during a humorous traffic stop. Not wanting to cut in, or listen to half a story, I decided to take a leak before the Client returned for his presentation.

Here I was met with two options, walk the long way to the other side of the house where the crew portaloos were and run the risk of crossing paths with David and the Client, or the quicker route, walk around the side of the house to the plentiful bushes waiting to be watered. The choice seemed obvious.

It was halfway through relieving myself, as I stared at the wildflowers and busy bees at work, that a small movement caught the corner of my eye. Looking down at the far end of the other side of the building, I saw the Representative. Clearly visible through the glass windows spanning the exterior of the building, he was walking towards one of the empty areas of the house. It was areas like these I had always found confusing, even prior to ripping out the old décor and furniture, I had noticed there was a number of ‘dead spaces’ in the house. These were spaces that seemed to serve no purpose at all or had been forgotten. I always assumed they were a statement, a chance to show “I’m so rich I can build areas that I don’t even need”. Yet there was the Representative, walking with purpose to an area that lacked any.

He stopped just before he reached the end wall, it was difficult to see because of the distance, but I saw him put down his briefcase and began fumbling for something along the wooden cladding that was fixed onto the concrete wall. I stood transfixed, with my zipper still down, as I saw him pick up his briefcase and descend into the floor, disappearing from view.

Had I imagined it? It defied all logic, there were not any stairs there, nor even a basement in this house, I had seen the plans of the building, it was all one floor. It felt like I had seen ghost, a wrecking ball of discovery that had shattered my sense of reality. I must’ve been in a state of shock, because the first thing Shaun said to me when I returned was “Your flyers undone mate”.

“Why were you looking?” I said vacantly, but before Shaun could respond, David and the Client entered the room.

“Everyone, listen up” David called out, waiting for the hum of conversation to dim. He cleared his throat and, in a voice attempting to sound more formal, declared “I have our Mr Newmont here who would like to have a word with you all about our progress”.

Mr Newmont stepped forward into the semicircle of gathered workers, provided a closer look, I had not noticed how oddly smooth he was. The way he composed himself made him seem like an older gentleman, but his face was completely rid of spots, wrinkles and blemishes. If he had been standing still, I could have easily confused him for a wax-work model. It looked uncanny, and in that moment, I thought it could only have been a poor plastic surgery job.

“Good afternoon, everyone, thank you for joining me here” spoke Mr Newmont, his accent velvety and rich, the kind only heard on royal tongues. “I would like to thank you all on the great progress you have made, however there is still a lot that remains unfinished, which is why I need to make some changes”. Mr Newmont paused as if to catch the tense glances and awkward shuffles shared between the workers, “Certain conditions have led to me requiring this space for an event I shall be hosting in two weeks’ time. Which is why you all will be on leave following the end of this week, before any of you get disgruntled, I have assured David I will provide a sum of leave pay which will not impede on your allotted holiday days in compensation for this sudden, temporary, dismissal”. Mr Newmont paused again to allow the murmurs and shoulder nudges of the workers. “I have an internal team who will implement temporary fittings for the event, when these fittings have been removed after the event, you all will return to work. I hope you all enjoy your time off” Mr Newmont finished with a pearly white and very clearly rehearsed smile.

“Thank you ever so much Mr Newmont” David chimed in, his northern accent starting to break free, “We’ll make sure to get this place ripe n’ ready for you, please let me see you out” he gestured to the door where I only just noticed the Representative was stood waiting. I had been so captivated by Mr Newmont that I had almost forgotten what I’d witnessed, but there he was, stoney faced but with a noticeable gleam of sweat to his forehead.

As Mr Newmont and the Representative made their way out of the building, the general chatter of excitement started to rise again in the workers, gappy smiles and gold teeth began to shine around the room. “Can you believe it?” Shaun gleamed, “Can’t wait to tell the missus, been trying to find an excuse to go down the coast for bloody ages! Hah! And you thought we were getting the sack!” Shaun chuckled like a man who had just been saved from the draft.

“Yeah, it’s pretty great” I said disconcertedly, still trying to make sense of the recent events.

The hubbub of conversation was interrupted as David re-entered the room “Right you sorry lot!” David boomed to the room, “All of you back to work, day ain’t over yet!”

The workers, still nudging and bumping, slowly made their way out of the room. As me and Shaun made our way back down the corridor and the orchestra of equipment slowly commenced again, I decided to quell my maddening curiosity.

“Shaun, I have got to show you something” I said, more sternly than intended.

“Alright” Shaun smiled, “but I’m warning you mate, I don’t swing that way”.

“I’m serious” I replied.

“Okay, okay, lead the way” Shaun said jovially, the idea of beaches and seaside fish n’ chips still clearly on his mind.

I took Shaun down the winding corridors, leading him far to the other end of the building until the sound of construction had almost shrunk to a gentle a hum.

“You sure you’re not looking for something special?” Shaun said eyeing the room, we had arrived at the ‘dead space’, an area of the building neither of us had really ventured to.

“No, it’s not your lucky day” I sighed, and then I told him exactly what I saw. “He disappeared here” I said, pointing to an unremarkable area on the concrete floor.

Shaun just laughed, “What the hell have you been smoking mate? Thought I could smell something dodgy on you this morning”.

“No, wait” I said, wondering for a moment if I had truly gone mad, “he must have hit a button or something behind this” I reached down to the wooden cladding I had seen the Representative meddle with and began feeling behind it.

Shaun was still chuckling, amusing himself with an impression of Shaggy from Scooby Doo in the plight to find a secret passage. It was almost when I had given up hope and resigned myself to lunacy when my finger brushed against a small switch hiding behind the far end of the cladding. “Look” I called out to him as I clicked it to the other end.

As soon as I did so a minor eruption of mechanical whirring sounded beneath the floor as blocks of concrete began to descend down imperceptible grooves, sliding, twisting and moving into place, we both stood transfixed as a stone stairway began to emerge beyond our feet. The last clink of movement was followed by a deafening silence that slowly escaped both of mouths ajar.

Looking over at Shaun, I think it was the first time I had ever seen him unnerved, I was finally able to crack a smile, “still think I’m bonkers?”

“I…” he shook his head as if to wake himself up, he took a moment to breathe in and then exhale deeply, seemingly composing himself, “are we going in?” he asked, already knowing the answer.

“After you good sir” I said, gesturing to the abyss.

We began our slow descent, the initial straight staircase began to slowly curve, illuminated only by dim electrical lighting fixed to the ceiling, we found ourselves descending a sharp spiral staircase. After only a few seconds, the sounds on site above had been silenced, replaced by the careful plodding of boots on concrete.

“Hey, check this out!” Shaun said pointing to the wall of the staircase. It took me a moment to register under the dim light, but where Shaun’s finger lay was a clear separation. The smooth concrete had ended, replaced with large stone bricks and mortar.

“Woah, weird” I peeked down the rest of the staircase where even the stairs had switched to stone, all slightly indented from seeming years of use. I turned to Shaun, “These walls look ancient, they remind me of the church stonework in my village”.

“Looks like it” Shaun pondered and then chuckled to himself, “Last time I was in a church my mother dragged me out by my ear for downing all the communion wine”.

I laughed, Shaun was always good at humouring a bad situation, it was always a good remedy. We both continued our descent; it took us another minute to finally reach the bottom. I don’t think either of us could have expected what we found, my suspicions of it being a church was correct at least. It was an immense room, large stone windows lined the sides of the room which would have once held beautiful stained glass had been long bricked up, the same going for the grand doorway at the end of the room, but this was where sense ended.

In the centre of the room was a huge iron cage, at least twice the height of me, with black iron bars as thick as my forearms. They sat upon a hefty base; wrought in metal it mirrored its roof which was inlayed with strange and cryptic symbols etched into the perimeter of the cage. These symbols also bordered the cage door, which was bolted shut with an extremely large and heavy looking padlock. Although dominating the room, strangeness screamed around it. Beyond the cage were rows of ornate and antique wooden folding chairs, all facing towards it, yet between them was a large wooden ‘X’ cross, with thick leather straps nailed into each end, clearly mean to support a person. My eyes met its purpose on the adjacent wall, rows upon rows of different whips, flails, bludgeons and knives neatly hung in orderly rows.

“Jesus Christ”, Shaun said with a whistle as he slowly brushed his hand along the tools, making them clink and clang together like sadistic wind chimes. “Now we know what Mr Client is into”.

“I don’t know Shaun” I said, the room suddenly feeling a lot colder. “Doesn’t this all feel a little uh… satanic?”

“Nah this is all fifty shades of kink if you ask me” Shaun replied, picking up some kind of wooden morning star from the wall. “Typical rich man behaviour”, he said as he swung the star around and put on a posh voice “I’ve got so much money life has lost all meaning, so me and my rich fellows gather here to tickle and beat each other till we feel something”. Shaun stopped to poke the knives with the star, “It’s that or they come here to drink the blood of virgins” he said, flourishing with a Dracula impression.

“Not funny Shaun, this is some serious shit” I said, trying to shake the feeling that we were being watched, “don’t forget we’re playing around in a billionaires dirty secret here”.

“Hey, lighten up you wuss! This is the yarn of the century, the boys are gonna love this, doubt even David knows about it, the sod!” Shaun chuckled to himself again and then something behind me caught his attention. “Hey maybe you could find a little info about this place” he said pointing to a bookcase behind me, “maybe a list of his dirty disciples ey?”

I sighed, “Fine, a quick look, but then we’re heading back up, I don’t think we should stay here too long”. I said, not knowing I would regret my next choices for the rest of my life.

I stood before the great wooden bookcase. Each of the books, all thick and leatherbound, couldn’t have been less than a century old. Most of them looked like they had not been read for a while as a thin coating of dust had covered them and the bookcase surrounding it, which is why one caught my eye. One of the larger books, with nothing inscribed on its binder, had a clear disturbance of dust in front of it as if it had been pulled out recently.

I picked it up, surprised by its weight and put it down heavily on a dark oak desk that was next to the bookcase, causing a small cloud of dust to fly from its pages. Shaun was still admiring the cornucopia of torture tools, so I opened the book to a random page. The book must have been much older than I originally thought as the pages were all written in Latin, all beautifully inscribed in thick lettering. Thankfully at the centre of each page were illustrations, but they did nothing to ease my mind.

At the centre of the first page was a circle of old and decrepit looking men, their crooked backs shrouded by long black cloaks, small grey and balding heads peeped through their hoods. They were all facing the centre, looking in awe to something that can only be described as the outline of a demon. Tall and horned with abnormally long arms that led to terrible looking claws, it looked odd compared to the finely detailed illustrations of the old men, as if someone had decided to doodle where they shouldn’t have.

However, it must have been intentional, for the outline was still there on the next page. Here the old men were still present, but one was armed with a flail who appeared to be whipping a grotesque and bloody figure curled up on the floor. Each of the men had sickening smiles plastered over the faces as they watched what appeared to be a strange yellow light rising from the broken figure and surrounding the outline of the demon.

“Found any kinky shit in there?” Shaun called out as he placed his tool back on the hook.

“Looks more like the virgin-blood-drinking kind of shit to me” I called back as I flicked to the next page. At first, I thought the picture had repeated itself, but then I noticed the men’s crooked backs had disappeared. The hooded figures stood tall and proud, and an array of blonde, brown and black locks of hair pooled from the inside of their hoods.

“Woah no way” Shaun said as came to stand behind my shoulder, “you were not kidding, maybe these lot really are from the Addams family”.

I turned to look at him with an unimpressed look, “Are you satisfied now? We better head up.”

“No, wait, look at this”, Shaun reached down to the book. I must have been so captivated by the illustrations that I missed a small separation towards the bottom of the book, where the paper pages of the book ended, and some fake, very carefully painted pages began. He opened this section to reveal a hollowed-out section of the book, containing nothing parr a very hefty looking key. “Ha ha! Well call me Sherlock would you look at this! I bet it opens that cage” he said picking up the key and walking over to the metal structure.

“Shaun, wait! I don’t think we should be messing with this stuff” I called out.

“Scared you’ll take a fancy to it?” Shaun chuckled as he began to raise the key to the lock.

“Shaun!” I called in a huff as I bounded over and snatched the key from his hands, “I’m serious”.

“Cool your panties! I just wanted a look…”, I noticed a glimmer of inspiration pass through his eye, “I need you to get a video of me in the cage” he said with a strange clarity.

“What? No! Shaun come on let’s get out of here” I replied, urgency creeping into my voice.

“Dude, one video, something to prove our story to others, and it’ll be funny” he begged.

“No, Shaun”

“Come on, please?”

“No, Shaun!”

“I’ll buy all your pints on the next pub trip?”

“Goddammit, fine” I groaned as I rubbed my temples, I knew Shaun wasn’t going to budge. “One video, and then you promise we’ll go back up?”

“I promise”, Shaun said as he handed me his cracked and dusty touchscreen, he looked down at the key in my hand and hesitated for a moment, he then looked back up with a smile “Honours yours”.

I took a deep breath and put the key in the lock, it seemed irrational at the time, but every one of my senses was screaming at me not to do it, but I did. With a certain push the heavy lock turned, and the sizeable bolt clinked out of place. I unhooked the padlock and slowly opened the extremely heavy door, “after you” I said, gesturing Shaun into the cage.

“This ain’t far off the size of my living room! Hah!” he said running his fingers alongside the inside of the cage. “Hey, stand back a bit to get the video”.

I went and stood towards the entrance of the church, after a couple angry taps I was able to get Shaun’s camera app up, “I’m ready” I called out and hit record.

Shaun grinned, he held his hands on the iron bars and bent over slightly, and in what I assume was his best interpretation of an aristocrat started moaning “Oh yes Mr Newmont! I’ve been a very naughty boy; spank me Mr Newmont spank me!”

Despite my fear at the situation, it made crack out laughing. “Shaun, cut it out” I snickered, struggling to keep the phone level.

Shaun laughed as well, he began to call out again “Mr New…” but his hands suddenly clasped to his throat as he started splutter and sway.

“This your idea of a good time?” I joked out to him, but then I noticed the desperation in his eyes. His hands were actually held just beyond his throat.

“Alright Shaun, getting a little weird now” I called out as his face began to go red and he started to lean up on the tips of his toes “Shaun?” but as I uttered his name his feet began to lift off the ground as his legs started flailing from side to side. I stood transfixed, as Shaun rose and dangled a foot in the air. Our eyes locked, his were beginning to pool with blood. “Shaun!” I cried as I lunged towards him, but it was too late. In a moment that seemed to last a lifetime I witnessed the skin on his neck begin to crack and tear as red, juicy tendons started to fly from their confinement, I heard a sickening rip as his flesh was torn, his jugulars splattering everything around him in blood. I saw his mouth ajar, eyes in shock, as his head was ripped clean from his body.

Initially, I thought I was in a state of delusion, for as I stood frozen in horror, I saw Shaun’s body begin to glow and crumble; like ash falling from the embers of a fire, from his feet upwards he began to disintegrate in a sickeningly beautiful light show. Every speck of blood that splattered the floor began to rise and shine like a thousand fireflies, these flakes rose up, seeming to catch light from a source that wasn’t there and form a grand ring of light within the cage. If I wasn’t watching the disintegration of a dear friend, it would have been beautiful.

I watched the last of the embers flood over Shaun’s cold, dead eyes and escape through his hair to join the great halo, and in a process that could have been five seconds or minutes the ring folded in on itself, cascading like a great waterfall into its centre. This light then splashed into a translucent ripple, sending colourless waves into the area surrounding. I instinctively stepped back, but these ripples had borders, like water filling a glass I saw a pellucid form take shape. Torso, legs, arms. I took another step back. Head, hands, feet. My body began to tremble. Horns, claws, teeth, the immense crystalline shadow took shape. Then as soon as its form became undeniable, like the dimming of a fluorescent bulb, it was gone. All trace of that creature, and Shaun, had disappeared.

My chest tightened as I almost crumpled to the floor, catching my body on the desk near the entrance, I began to breath heavily as my vision blurred. I wanted to be sick, I had never seen someone die, not so violently, not to someone so dear. To worsen my woes, my mind could not even fully acknowledge it was real, it defied all reason.

I tried to control my breathing, each shuddering breath slowly brought clarity back to my vision, as the beating of my heart filled my ears, another sound broke the silence. A slow, grinding creak. I hadn’t locked the cage; its door slowly opened. In a moment of irrational hope, I thought it might have been pushed by a non-existent wind, yet this illusion was shattered by the outline of a three-pronged footprint disturbing the dust on the stone paved floor.

I hadn’t realised I was running till my hands hit the stairway, scrabbling and clawing my way up the staircase like a child escaping the monsters waiting in the dark. The spiral stairs seemed to warp and bend as I kept tripping, the air getting thinner, breath heavy in my lungs, I climbed, climbed, climbed till the natural light began to break through and the sound of power tools emanated closer, closer, closer like the trumpets of heaven, until finally I broke through, collapsing onto the cold concrete floor. The cool, fresh air instantly hit my sweat drenched body, and I began to shiver, I was still breathing hard, it felt like I was hyperventilating, I wanted nothing more than to curl up into a ball and dissipate into the ground.

“You alright son?” A voice called out from the far end of the corridor. I wanted to reply, but it felt like every muscle in my body had locked into place, my mind had diverted all focus into maintaining a rapid intake of breaths.

“Jake, Damian, get over here quick, someone’s collapsed” The voice seemed so distant, like calling out from the bottom of a pit, but this was followed by the slowly rising chorus of work boots plodding on concrete. I suddenly felt a hand grip my shoulders as I was flipped onto my back, three vaguely familiar faces started back at me, folks who my only interaction with came from the greetings and goodbyes of the coming and goings from the site.

“Do you hear me son?” The bearded worker spoke to me, but I still had not calmed enough to speak, “Jake you better radio this in” he said as the other worker grabbed the radio strapped to his chest.

“David, come in” the radio crackled for a second.

“What’s crackin” I hear David reply over the static.

“One of the workers has collapsed, think it’s one of the apprentices, far west side corner of the house”

“Jesus, I’ll be over now”

As Jake and the bearded worker looked over me, I could see that the man who I assumed to be Damian cast his attention behind me.

“Hey guys this is going to sound like a stupid question, but is this place meant to have a basement?” Damian said staring at the staircase.

“Holy shit” said Jake as they both realised the impossibility of what was in front of them, “You know anything about this Mark?”

The bearded man shook his head in disbelief, “It can’t be…” he looked down at me, still panting and wild eyed, “what the hell did you find kid?”

I could barely make out what they were saying, my ears were ringing, vision still blurry. Yet that high-pitched hum made way for an even less welcome sound. Slow, methodical thuds, as natural as the ticking of a clock, I could hear the echoes of that creature slowly making its way up the staircase. 

  
END OF PART 1
