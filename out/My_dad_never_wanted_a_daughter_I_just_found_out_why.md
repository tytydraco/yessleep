My dad never wanted a daughter, just found out why.

Ever since I was born i have felt a slight resentment from my dad, though he never showed it to me directly I always saw him go on trips with my five brothers while leaving me to stay at home.I always chalked this up to the fact that I was a accident and that I was much younger than all my brothers.

This Christmas I decided to visit my family as I had just broken up with my boyfriend and I had no one else to stay with.After putting the turkey in the oven,my mum asked “Olivia, can you go fetch the Christmas lights, they’re up in the attic”.walking up into the attic I spotted the Christmas lights, just before I was about to pick them up I noticed something, a book titled “my journal” picking it up and wiping the dust off of it I realised it was my dads journal.

Flipping open the book I started reading.”It has been the worst day of my life,I can even write i can’t tell anyone about anything that has happened, because they won’t believe me, all I can do is write and hope someone will read it and help me.Today was my 15th birthday,I was going to play laser tag with my friends,driving down the road in the back seat of dads car I couldn’t contain my self,I started bouncing up and down my seat while giggling.my dad turned around and told me to sit down,but then I saw it,a truck driving the wrong way.As soon as the truck hit our car everything went black.Waking up I looked around,pitch black darkness with just one chair laying in the middle of the darkness,walking up to chair I started to panic and cry,not knowing where I was or what happened.Then it appeared, a tall creature with empty eye sockets and elongated limbs with its rib cage poking out of its skin,though it had no eyes nor mouth I felt it staring at me grinning.i started balling closing my eyes trying to make it all go away.opening my eyes,my surroundings had changed, I stood in a maze,running throughout the maze I saw incomprehensible horrors at every turn.After what felt like hours of running I gave up,I curled up into a ball on the floor,closed my eyes and then started begging to go back to the normal world.Yelling out that I would do anything to go back I heard a response, “anything?” It asked, “Yes anything!Please just return me to the real world.”, I replied “alright you can go back,just with one condition,you must bring have 6 male children, if you do that, the children will be brought here,but you will go to heaven.” The being said.I agreed to the deal and as I opened my eyes,I woke up in a hospital bed.

Flipping to the next page, I noticed the date had a 20 year difference to the previous pages,and I carried on reading “After my daughter was born,I kept trying for a new child, a male one, so I could finish the deal, yet no matter how much I tried, I couldn’t get my wife pregnant.i went to the doctors for answers and the doctor told me, your infertile.”
