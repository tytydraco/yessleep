Today's shift began pretty easily. I mean it is a national holiday and everyone is out in less depressing parts of the city or at home. I of course am at work, as always.

Sitting at the desk with my laptop and power-saving mode on – writing this. Once the battery goes out I'll probably tinker with the radio. The thing has been stuck on one damn station for the entire duration that I've worked here. And its always the same rock, blues and occasional folk song over and over again with the host commenting on the local politics sometimes.

I really need something new to listen to...

But since there are no customers yet, I'll write a couple more things about the regulars.

Well... Last time I *did* mention the *hallway*. I should elaborate more on it before I go on my tangent.

As of writing the hallway has become a staple feature of the kiosk. There are no lights in there, so I have to have a flashlight with me whenever I go in there.

I never go far in. I find the shelf that has what I need and I come back, which is usually a couple steps in. And what I need is either vodka, beer or tobacco... Which is conveniently most of the damn hallway from what I can see.

I do hear shuffling when inside that place, too. Ever since the hallway appeared the little bastards aren't as active as before. I think they have all the vodka they need in the hallway. Though it still does happen that a vodka bottle drops down and breaks here and there... At least Winston doesn't cut my pay because of it... We do have an infinite supply of the stuff now anyway.

Oh, yeah. The shelves restock themselves in the hallway. Don't ask how or why. They just do. *Awfully* convenient.

The flashlight doesn't go that far inside, I can maybe see 10-ish meters inside, before it becomes pitch black. Though when I whistle inside there is an echo that lasts... *Uncomfortably long.*

The roosters though, they became a bit more active in the last few weeks I noticed. They would bang on the door more frequently. I mean the door is made out of metal, and is quite secure. There is one small detail I forgot to mention the last time. The door does have a few... Bumps that seem to have been made by someone – or *something* – from the outside.

If Winston didn't mention it, I guess it's fine. Could've been the roosters or something.

The whole place is pretty secure to be honest. I just hate that I have no real windows in here, only the little window that fits money, teeth, cigarettes and at most eight bottles of vodka through it – horizontally, top first. The rest of the windows are covered by newspapers, and Winston told me not to touch them.

I do find it annoying. But it does help with the anxiety when I hear the banging from the outside, or some other weird sounds sometimes. All I need to see are the customers.

Miss Six tends to try and squint through the newspapers I noticed. She'd knock and I would feel something *stare* at me. I think I once saw one of her eyes through a small slit in the newspapers. Just looking at me.

I forgive her creepiness. It could be that she is impatient to get her sixes – vampiric moonshine – or some shit.

...

She did offer me that hug? Or did she? Maybe I hallucinated, who knows. I'll ask her later if she comes around... Did I talk to her before? Like *actually* talk?

Agh, there's a first time for everything. Not like women scare me.

I mean I was once greeted by one big eye when I opened that window, it covered the whole view. I couldn’t see anything beyond it. Just one big, yellowish eye – staring at me.

I didn’t piss myself at all. I probably did shit myself a bit. But that was probably due to the kebab I bought before that shift.

And before you ask – “Why didn’t you go to the toilet?” – I already told you, I refuse to touch that toilet.

I can probably get some balls and venture further into the hall and make an improvised toilet in there… If Winston asks, I’ll blame the gnomes. Fuck them.

Huh, this journaling shit does help my thinking.

Well, I think there’s a customer. I’ll write a bit later.

\###

I had a weird thing happen. Someone knocked like ten minutes ago, I opened up and did my greetings. Just to realize no one was there.

Then again a few minutes later, the same thing. Out of all the shit I’ve seen, the most mundane knock and fuck off prank is *weird* to me.

I’ll try to see who it is.

I think I should put the time and date when I write.

I use “military time”. So if any of you Americans think that’s wrong. I am European. Fuck you.

\### 

1^(st) May, 23:58hrs

I forgot what I wanted to write. I apologize to the Americans, I was joking.

Anyway, Miss Six came around today, a little while ago – She was in a good mood as always, very polite, a bit flirty. And I decided to ask her something. Not her name, but how someone was knocking then bugging off by the time I opened.

Weirdly she got a bit more serious after that.

“Ah, *they* like to do that. Don’t worry about that darling, you can always go out and chase them off. I think a strong man is hiding behind that glass.” – She said, with a wink.

Who is that *they,* I have no idea and why she is constantly trying to get me to go out, I dunno. I only know that I have less of bottle number six and more teeth in the drawers.

I think Miss Six is trying to ask me out. I mean, “Go out and chase them off” – Could that be some sort of hint? Or am I overthinking it? I think this journaling shit is really helping my thoughts but I am thinking a bit too much for my taste. I don’t want to spiral again.

The last drunk of the evening got his daily evening dose of vodka and tobacco so I’ll be free for some time again, I think. Glad that I don’t have to clean the outside, I think he threw up right in front of the kiosk the moment I closed the window.

Anyway, I also wanted to talk more about the shit I saw.

There was this drunk once, not Smirnoff, but a dude that was his age. They seemed similar, like they came from the same dump – or swam in stale milk, because he smelled like a combination of a mold, shit, alcohol and milk… With a hint of lavender.

But he didn’t smell like that always, the first few months I worked here he just smelled like moldy shit and alcohol – and acted like your typical drunk. But I remember one night, he was buying the usual when he told me how – through slurred speech – “Tonight is a wee bit colder, innit brah?”

I agreed. Despite not really noticing it. He was a bit more anxious for some reason. Like the cops are on to him or something.

He had a gray beanie on his head. It looked like it had seen better days, but it had this specific tear on one side of it. Not deep, but it looked like it had been cut by a knife or something.

See, later that night I heard the usual banging and knocking. But there was a really strong BANG in the front of the kiosk – like something went full speed into it. Enough to make me jump from my seat.

I stood frozen for a few moments, before I decided to go and open of the window to see what’s up. I saw nothing. Then went back to watch Family Guy on my laptop.

Though when my shift ended I took a better look at the front of the kiosk in the morning. And I saw some red… It looks distinct on the snow, mixed with bile, mud and God knows what else.

And on top of the snow was the gray beanie, with that cut on one side.

I didn’t touch it, I just looked, and left. I figured the dude probably wanted to get another vodka but was so drunk that he fell, knocked himself out on the kiosk, and I couldn’t see him on the ground when I opened the window.

I mean if he wasn’t there he got up at some point, so he was alive.

And I did see him the next evening, but he was… Off.

He bought the usual. But he didn’t talk much, or at all. He’d just come to the kiosk, knock, have the exact amount for a vodka and ciggies in his hand – and he’d just stare.

After a few weeks he was gone completely. The beanie was gone too.

No customers, don’t know what to watch. I could maybe get a subscription service for shows and movies… Maybe? I mean, yeah I can afford it.

Yeah, I can.

I did get that USB with a bunch of newer movies from my cousin… I left it at home though.

\### 

2^(nd) May, 1:20

I had a customer who was new. I think he’s a bloodsucker. I mean, I know. He wanted number 11. But he also wanted cigarettes and a couple of strawberry juices… I had to go to the hallway to get some, because Winston didn’t restock the juices since last month, only kids buy them. Not a lot of kids around here… Kids that don’t drink alcohol, that is.

He was like most of them. But he did seem to kind of stare at me more than usual. For some reason. 

2^(nd) May, 2:13

I found something to watch, but my battery is low for fuck sake. I should save it.

I could ask Winston why for the love of God and all that is holy this kiosk doesn’t have one extra power thingy, whatever you call it in English. Plug?

I’ll tell him that my job satisfaction will go through the roof if he does that. Or just somehow lets me able to charge my laptop and phone. 

2^(nd) May, 2:44

About 3 hours and 20 minutes left. No customers in the last hour. I’ve been listening to the radio a bit. I tried to switch the station but to no avail.

The radio is on one of the shelves, an old piece of shit. I think its one of those crystal radios, it looks like it was working non-stop since the coronation of Franz Ferdinand… Wait, he was killed, yeah. Joseph? Yeah, Joseph Ferdinand. I think.

Anyway, I decided to unplug it. Weirdly it worked even when not plugged in… That’s when I realized that I have a free plug! But okay, it might have a battery. Weird thing is it started being a bit distorted closer to the desk.

I walked in circles a bit to see where the source of that disruption was, and I think its coming from the hallway.

I took like two steps inside with the radio and confirmed that it was indeed the hallway.

Well, I am not surprised… Hmm, I might catch some otherworldly radio station? Maybe Smirnoff will be the commentator, the gnomes the audience.

“All About Vodka FM” – It would be called.

My laptop is now charging, the radio is still playing some annoying blues. It at least fills the dullness of the space.

2^(nd) May, 3:00

The banging stopped.

I mean the constant banging that slowly intensifies until around 4:30, it stopped abruptly.

I can just hear the radio now.

Weird.

I am trying to remember if it happened before? I’ll ask Winston about it.

\###

I’m sitting here in front of the hallway. Just watching. For some reason curiosity is beginning to creep in.

What’s beyond all of that? Are the shelves infinite? Why do they restock?

Are the little vodka thiefs to blame for it? Is it the portal to their realm? Or just a colony?

And I think I noticed the shelves are in a *slightly* different arrangement every single time. Like when I go inside – let’s say three times per shift – I notice that the vodka shelf is maybe one step farther or one step closer… Nothing you’d really notice the first few times. But with me working virtually every single damn evening for the past few months. You start to notice things. Even if they might subconcious…

Or I might imagining things. It can always be that.

Oh, I have customer. I’ll write later.

I think that I will fucking kill her.

I said women don’t scare me. But one woman I really, *really* did not want to see. The one whose presence made my stomach drop – the one waiting for me behind that creaky, shitty window…

My sister.

I first thought I was hallucinating. But no it was really her.

After confirming that was really her – By asking a very specific thing about me – then I told her bluntly – “What the fuck are you doing here at this hour?!”

I swear to God no fucking energy drink or coffee can wake a man up as fast as this. Fucking hell.

“I need some help.” – She said.

And of course I was scared to hear what it was.

It ended up being that her friend lives around here and she was sleeping over after a study session. And she needed somewhere to sleep until the buses start driving again around 4 or 4:30.

Firstly, *bullshit.* I know she is a top student and all, but she is a *teenage girl,* and I wouldn’t be surprised if her *friend* was of the opposite gender\*.\* Secondly, I was inclined to scold her then and there.

But then I heard some knocks at the back of the kiosk.

Then – what if it wasn’t really *her.*

I heard the knocks go up the kiosk, tapping their way up.

What if I let her in and she end up being a rooster… And bloodsucker… Or, who knows what? A shapeshifter?

*She’ll see the damn hallway.*

I heard as the taps reached the roof.

“Dude why are you staring at me?” – She asked. – “It smells like shit out here!”

I heard the taps get closer.

“Get in. Now.” I said.

“Where’s the door on this thing?” She asked back.

I got up from my seat and was going to the metal door.

Then I heard her.

I heard her scream.

I bolted, I turned the key in the metal door.

  I flung it open and sprinted out. For the first time.

My heart was beating like cannons.

I turned the corner. I was ready to kill.

To die…

But she… She was fine.

She laughed.

And she was not alone.

“Good morning darling! You have a wonderful sister, I must say! My, and he’s a handsome one isn’t he Natalia?”

I stood there, confused. I didn’t know what to say.

“Bro, since when did you get a girlfriend? Why didn’t you tell me!”

“W-what?”

“Dude, Kristi, here.” She pointed at the gorgeous redhead.

“Natali, dear, don’t make him uncomfortable.” She said to my sister – “Look, darling, I brought you something.” She put forth her hand, holding a plastic bag. I just stared at it.

“I’ll… I’ll pas-“ – Before I could finish my sentence my sister cut me off – “He’ll take it, thank you!”

She grabbed the plastic bag. Then gave a the stink eye for a second.

“Thank you Kristi so much, you’re a very good teacher! And please do take care of my brother, he’s a thickheaded idiot as I told you.” My sister said.

I don’t remember much of the girl talk. I was stuck frozen in fight or flight mode for I don’t know how much.

I was jolted out by what *Miss Six* said.

“Oh, dear. Leave the man be, I’ll drive you home. It’s no problem. I am a night owl, and I do enjoy a night drive!”

I was about to say something.

But I somehow felt… She was not a threat.

“Can I drive her back home, or do you want her to be with you?” She asked – *like she read my mind.*

My sister naturally protested how I don’t order her around.

“Sure… Yeah, go ahead. Drive safe.” I turned to my sister – “You and I have to talk tomorrow.”

I am writing this from home. I am tired.

I returned back to the kiosk after that. I just sat down in thought. I didn’t know what to do. I felt dreadful yet somehow… Safe.

Was it a rooster? I asked my sis after coming back home why she screamed when I was heading out, she said *Kristiana* just appeared out of nowhere. And that *she was at her place.*

She – Miss Six – Is my sister’s tutor.

And apparently I am her boyfriend. Or maybe that a joke between the two. I don’t fucking know.

I just can’t shake the feeling that if she didn’t appear that the scream I would’ve heard from my sister wouldn’t have been from being startled but out of pain.

That tapping.

That was a rooster. No doubt about it.

I can’t think. I’ll post this now and just go to sleep. I’ll update you how it goes.

Good night.
