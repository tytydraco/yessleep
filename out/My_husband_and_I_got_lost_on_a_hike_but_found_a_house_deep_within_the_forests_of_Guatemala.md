We’d been wanting an adventure before starting a family, and the pandemic was the kick up the arse we needed. While we were involuntarily housebound we did a lot of research and decided on travelling the Americas for three months. We’re from the East of England, so quite frankly anywhere would have been an adventure.

We were fortunate to be in a position where a three month sabbatical was a comfortable option for us. My grandparents were wealthy and had left me a generous sum when they passed, and my husband Joseph and I both had great jobs. I had just turned 30 the week before we left, Joseph was 32. It just felt right; a now or never type scenario.

Calgary was our first destination, followed by Vancouver. Then we travelled through the Western States of the US down to Mexico. We were just over a month in by the time we reached Guatemala, where we were staying in a forest campsite next to Mayan ruins. On our first night Joseph excitedly called out to me as I towel dried my hair after an outdoor shower.

“Dani, come look at this!”

There was a tarantula in the corner of our spacious tent. One of the employees said it was harmless, and he even offered for us to handle it before moving it outside of camp. I was apprehensive but I briefly held it after my husband, such a surprisingly delicate creature. This was definitely the adventure I had wanted. I felt a million miles away from home in the best way possible.

On our second full day we hiked a trail that was noted for its wildlife spotting opportunities, particularly various monkey and bird species. In the process of taking a picture I dropped my phone, and was taken by surprise as a small monkey took off with it.

“Hey!” I yelled out. “I don’t believe it.”

“What’s up, Dani?” asked Joseph, a little ahead of me.

I couldn’t help but laugh. “A monkey just took my phone!”

“Seriously?” he asked, jogging to me. “Where did it go?”

“In the trees over there.”

“Little sod,” he said, running in that direction.

“Joseph, don’t bother. It’s gone!”

“We’re not leaving without trying,” he yelled back.

I reluctantly went into the trees and caught a glimpse of his shirt in the distance.

“Please don’t go any further Joseph, we need to stay on the trail!”

“I think I can see it!” I heard him yell.

Against my better judgement I began to weave between the trees, stepping over foliage. Howler monkeys spoke to each other in the treetops, probably laughing about the dumb British tourists. I spotted a few colourful birds but didn’t have time to observe their beauty, instead pursuing my silly knight in shining armour who I’d lost sight of.

“Joseph, please call out to me!”

“Over here!”

I could see him waving, allowing me to breathe. When I reached him I gave him a hug, then slapped his arm.

“Ow!”

“I was scared!” I said, wiping sweat from my brow.

“But look,” he said, pointing up.

I couldn’t believe it. The little monkey was sitting on a branch holding my phone.

“Hey, little one,” I said softly, holding up my hands. “Please could you drop my phone down to me?”

“It doesn’t speak human, Dani,” said Joseph, picking up a stick.

“They’re very intelligent,” I said.

“Not *that* intelligent. Also, we’re in Guatemala. It’s more likely to understand Spanish.” He brought the stick back as if he was about to throw it.

I grabbed his wrist. “You are *not* throwing sticks at the local wildlife. Jesus Christ!”

“Well asking nicely didn’t work,” he said, pulling away from me. But then there came a thud as my phone bounced a few feet away from us. It was undamaged too, the soft ground cushioning its fall. I was happy that we could head back to the trail, but that was short-lived.

Several hours passed and we couldn’t find our way out of the forest. Joseph did his best to console me but I could tell he was scared too. As the ground began to feel softer, and the air more dense and humid, we realised we were nowhere near where we had come from. Even the plant life looked different. I couldn’t help but snivel as my nerves got the better of me.

A weight was lifted when we spotted a solitary house in a clearing.

“Joseph, look!” I yelled with relief. There was sudden rustling in the plants to our left, followed by a deep growl. We only had a second to acknowledge it before a large crocodile snapped its jaws in our direction. I screamed as Joseph pulled me towards him.

*“Dejarlas!”* we heard a woman yell from the house. The crocodile’s growls became quieter as it backed up out of sight. We hurried to the moderately sized wooden house, which was elevated a little from the ground on stilts. A woman stood on the steps leading up to the door. She was around mid-thirties with raven black hair that spilled over her shoulders. She was beautiful. She was also heavily pregnant.

“Hola!” said Joseph, a little out of breath. “Por favor… Err… Lost… Perdido!”

“I speak English,” she said. “Please, come inside.”

She turned and walked up the steps. Joseph and I looked at each other, briefly hesitating before following her into the house. Once inside I broke down.

“Gracias!” I cried. Joseph put his arm around me as the woman took my trembling hands in hers.

“I have something for your anxiety,” she said. “Sit down.”

“We don’t want to be a bother,” said Joseph. “If you could just point us…”

“No bother,” she said. “Please, sit.”

We took off our backpacks and sat at a table in the rustic kitchen. I was surprised to see electric powered lighting, as wherever we were felt off the grid. The woman boiled some water on a stove, then started to prepare food. She put a plate of fruit on the table along with some bread, various spreads, and some sliced meat.

“Eat,” she said with a smile, turning back to the stove. I looked at Joseph who just shrugged. Despite our reservations we were famished. I used my fingers to eat some mango and banana. Joseph braved the unidentified meat, making a sandwich with one of the spreads which he said was similar to horseradish. The woman came back and put two hot cups on the table. It smelt strong with herbs and spices.

“You drink this, you feel better,” she said warmly.

“Thank you,” I said, taking a small sip along with Joseph. It was so bitter it made my face screw up. Joseph audibly groaned in disgust, then looked incredibly apologetic. The woman laughed.

“It does not taste good, but it is good for soul.” She tapped her chest and forehead.

We didn't want to be rude so we continued drinking it. “I’m Dani by the way, and this is my husband Joseph.”

“I am Lorena,” she said.

“Are those crocodiles dangerous?” asked Joseph.

“They can be,” she said, taking a seat as she lovingly rubbed her large belly. “But we share this land, so we must respect one another.”

“Will this be your first child?” I asked.

She nodded. “I am very blessed.”

“Congratulations,” I said, reaching across to take Joseph's hand. “We’d like to start a family of our own too, once we’re back home.”

“Speaking of which,” said Joseph. “We’d really appreciate your help getting back to our camp. Is there a path we can take or…”

“It will be dark soon,” said Lorena. “It will not be safe after dark. You can stay here tonight.”

“We couldn’t put you out like that,” I said.

“I insist,” she said. “You will find your way tomorrow.”

I looked at Joseph as if to say *do something*, but he just shrugged.

“You’re very kind, Lorena,” he said. “We’re incredibly grateful, thank you.”

I freshened up, feeling gross and sticky from the day's heat. Fortunately I’d packed a spare top and shorts in my backpack, thinking that they could come in handy for that very reason. While Joseph was in the bathroom Lorena showed me around. It was as quaint and rustic as you’d expect a house in the rainforest to be.

“An impressive collection,” I said, observing a large wall of books.

“You like to read?” she asked.

“Oh yes, I adore reading.”

“My favourite author is Virgilio Rodríguez Macal.” She showed me his works on the shelf and stroked the spine of one called *El mundo del misterio verde*. “This is my favourite book.”

“I’m afraid my Spanish is terrible,” I laughed. “I would understand very little.”

We went to the back of the house where there was an elevated deck over a large expanse of water, with trees and plants growing directly out of it. The sun was beginning to set and it gave it such a warm glow.

“Wow,” I said. “What a view.”

“Welcome to the swamp,” said Lorena.

“Are you out here alone?” I asked. “You haven’t mentioned the baby’s father.”

She looked down and stroked her belly, a small smile on her lips. “I am alone now, but not for long.”

“I’m sorry if I asked too much.”

“I have my sisters nearby. And them too." She nodded to the water where some crocodiles had surfaced. I got a little shiver.

“In England we look out back and might see the neighbour’s cat, or the odd hedgehog. Here it’s something that wants to eat you.”

She laughed. “We have cats too, but they also might want to eat you.” She groaned a little and held her belly. “Ooh, she is moving tonight!”

“May I?”

She smiled and took my hand, gently pressing it against her. I could feel as her baby turned inside.

“How does it feel?” I asked.

She sighed. “Magical. Like, the greatest honour. It is hard to explain.”

“I understand,” I said. “I honestly can’t wait for that next chapter in my life. At least, I hope for that next chapter.”

“You will be a great mother, Dani,” she said. “I feel it.”

I smiled. “Thank you, Lorena. So will you.”

The baby kicked out suddenly, making me flinch. I laughed it off as we went back inside.

Lorena kindly put us up in a spare bedroom. Joseph stared at me intently as we laid on the unfamiliar bed. He brushed the hair from my face and kissed me, his other hand stroking my inner thigh.

“Joseph,” I said. “We can’t, not here.”

“I don’t know what it is. Maybe the fact that Lorena is smoking…”

“Hey,” I laughed, playfully slapping him. But I couldn’t deny I felt the same way too. We made love, then fell asleep to the sounds of nature.

I woke up in the early hours when it was still dark. I stirred for a while but became restless, so I left the bedroom and went to the deck for fresh air. The swamp was bathed in moonlight giving it an enchanting look. Despite the terrifying experience of being lost earlier, I felt grateful that it had led us to Lorena and this beautiful part of the world.

As I was looking around I spotted something in the forest to the left. There was something white that stood out, but I couldn’t quite tell what it was at that point. As I kept staring I began to notice small details, and realised I was looking at the skull of a large animal. Its empty eye sockets appeared to be looking in my direction. I assumed it was attached to a tree as it was suspended a few feet from the ground, but it turned and disappeared into the forest.

I gasped and stepped back. When I turned to go back inside Lorena was standing in the doorway, making me scream.

“I did not mean to scare you,” she said.

“Lorena!” I said, clutching my hands to my chest. “I just… I saw something in the trees. A skull, a large animal skull...

I was breathing heavily as she took my hands. “You are far from home, Dani. We have different ways here. There are villages nearby with ancient tribes. Some of these tribes wear the skulls as a, how you say…”

I shook my head. “Tradition? Superstition?”

“Si, like this!”

“Oh my goodness,” I said. “Are they dangerous?”

“No,” she said. “Not to us.”

I took a deep breath and laughed uneasily. “Well, I wanted an adventure and I certainly got that!”

I went back to bed thinking I wasn't going to get any sleep at all. But within minutes of hearing Joseph’s gentle breaths I joined him.

◈

I awoke to sunlight and the smell of something delicious cooking, as well as an empty bed. Joseph was eating breakfast in the kitchen.

“Good morning,” I said, and Lorena was already guiding me to sit at the table, putting a plate of eggs and avocado in front of me. “You are spoiling us, Lorena.”

“It is my pleasure,” she said.

“Dani,” said Joseph. “Lorena is fishing this morning and I offered to help. You know how much I love to fish!”

“I do,” I said. “But perhaps we should be thinking about getting back to camp? I’m sure they were concerned when we didn’t come back yesterday.”

“They have our money already,” he said. “I doubt they care.”

His response irritated me a little. “I disagree. I think they will be searching for us, if not now then soon.”

“I am sorry,” said Lorena. “I do not want to cause trouble.”

“Not at all,” I said. “We’re so grateful for what you’ve done for us. But I worry that *we’ll* be causing trouble by being missing.”

“Dani, we only live once,” he said. “I don’t know what it is but I love it out here. Just let me have this, just for today. *Please*.”

I felt like he’d got me in a spot where saying no would make me a monster.

“How far are we from camp roughly?” I asked, telling Lorena where we were based.

“No more than three hours. You just follow the swamp north.”

Joseph was looking at me with puppy eyes.

“Okay, but we should head back this afternoon.”

“Absolutely!” he said. “Thank you, Dani.”

Lorena put a hand on my shoulder. “Will you join us?”

I contemplated it. “You know, it’s actually been pretty full on up until now. I think I might take the opportunity chill on the deck, watch the world go by.”

“Maybe read a book that you do not understand?” she laughed.

“Exactly, new experiences all around!”

I insisted on washing the dishes as Joseph and Lorena prepared to head out to a spot a little further up the swamp. I spent an hour or so on the deck before heading back inside to cool down, checking out Lorena’s book wall in more detail. They were all in Spanish from what I could see, but I recognized some of the more famous titles. I found the books by Virgilio Rodríguez Macal. My eyes fell on *El mundo del misterio verde*, Lorena’s favourite.

“Something green mystery,” I said out loud, chuckling to myself. When I pulled it out the book only moved slightly, and something in the wall *clicked*. I was frozen to the spot for a moment before I gently pushed on the wall, and part of it moved inwards on a hinge.

“Fuck off!” I said, taking a step back as cool air blew from within. I’d only seen secret doors in films and had no idea such things existed. On the other side was a dark passageway with stone walls. I looked around like a child about to do something naughty, and almost stepped fully inside without propping the door open. The last thing I wanted was for it to close behind me with no way of getting out, so I used a stack of old books that looked like encyclopaedias.

My heart was racing as I went inside. As I followed the wall it gradually became lighter as beams of natural light shone from cracks in the ceiling. The ground was a mixture of stone, dirt, and small plants. The temperature was cool compared to the rest of the house.

I eventually came to a large opening that was lit from larger beams and flamed torches on the walls. It was like a massive hall inside an ancient temple. It took me far too long to notice that it was impossible for this room to exist as part of Lorena’s house. It was at least double the size alone! My brain couldn’t work out where I was as I had only walked in a straight line. I should have been in the swamp.

There were several tall trees growing out of the floor. In the centre were some stone steps that led up to an idol. I climbed them to get a better look. Carved from stone was the figure of a nude woman, but her head was that of a crocodile.

“What the fuck,” I whispered. Lorena had mentioned the local tribes. I assumed this was something they worshipped, or used to worship.

I gasped as a tarantula made an appearance, crawling from the back of the idol’s leg. It looked similar to the one that had been in our tent. I felt compelled to pick it up, as if I was trying to prove a point to myself. So I gently placed a hand near it and used my other to coax it. I held it in my palms like it was made of porcelain.

There came a deep guttural growl from nearby. I made a sudden move to turn and I guess it startled the spider. It bit my right palm, forcing me to drop it. I watched it scurry away into the darkness as my palm began to sting. I had two puncture wounds that trickled with a little blood.

The growl came again and this time I fell back, my hand making contact with the idol. There was a strange sensation in my arm, like an intense vibration. I pulled my hand away and looked up, the long reptilian face appearing to look down on me. I backed down the steps, my heart bursting from my chest.

There was a loud hiss to my side and a large, very real crocodile snapped at me. I screamed and fell, throwing myself back. It turned to face me but didn’t move any closer, it just growled. I quickly got to my feet and ran back down the passageway, feeling relief when the hidden door was still propped open.

I ran out of the house and looked around, making an educated guess where Lorena and Joseph might be. I called their names frantically. I wanted to grab Joseph and leave, find our own way back to camp. As far as I was concerned the adventure was over. It had now moved into creepy weird territory.

I almost fell to my knees when I saw Joseph on the bank of the swamp.

“Hey, what’s up with you?” he asked.

“Where’s Lorena?” I asked, out of breath.

“She went back to the house, why?”

“We need to get out of here now!”

“Dani,” he said, grabbing my shoulders. “Tell me why.”

I did my best at explaining what had happened. He started to laugh.

“Why are you laughing at me?”

“Dani, look where you are. We’re in Central fucking America, not Suffolk! You know about the history and culture. These are not unusual things for this part of the world.”

“But… But the room shouldn't exist. It’s…”

“Shush, Dani. I thought you were more open to cultural differences. You’re embarrassing yourself now.”

I was completely taken aback. “I… I am open, Joseph. What I just experienced wasn’t like that though.”

“You want to go?” he yelled. “Fine, we’ll just shit on Lorena’s hospitality and go. Come on!”

He started to storm away, leaving me feeling uncomfortable. But he stopped and turned back, looking in all directions before he spoke.

"Fuck it. I was gonna wait until we got to Peru, people fall from those mountains all the time. But here’s as good a place as any. Middle of nowhere, no one out here but sweet Lorena.”

He started walking towards me and picked up a rock.

“I… I don’t understand Joseph…”

“You don’t really need to understand.”

I started to back away. “You're scaring me…”

“I do love you in a way, Dani. But one thing I *really* love about you is your bank account.”

I couldn’t believe what was happening. It made me forget about everything that had come before.

"But we're gonna start a family..."

He scoffed. "I don't want children with you. I never did."

My heart was broken and my nerves were shattered in the space of minutes.

“Joseph," I cried. "You don’t have to do this. The money is ours to share. You wouldn’t get it anyway, it would go to my parents…”

“Well, I know that’s a fucking lie because I was there when you wrote the will.”

“I changed it!” I snapped. “Without your knowledge.”

He froze and looked at me like he’d been deceived. “I don’t believe you. But regardless, I kind of have to do this now.”

I screamed and ran in the opposite direction. Joseph grabbed me from behind and I felt a dull pain on the back of my head. My vision became blurry as I hit the water and made a feeble attempt to stay on the surface.

“Oh no!” he said dramatically. “You’ve fallen in the swamp. Shame about the man-eating crocodiles and all.”

“Jo… Please…”

“Help!” he screamed from his lungs. “Oh God, help!”

He smiled at me, waved, then jogged towards the house. I could hear him screaming for Lorena as everything started getting darker. One thing I noticed was on a nearby bank of the swamp, there was another one of those skull people. They appeared to just watch me as I struggled. The last thing I remember is a crocodile on the swamp’s surface making a beeline towards me, and then I went completely under.

◈

I woke up to screams.

As my eyes adjusted I could see warm shades flickering in my peripheral vision. When I sat up, pain shot through the back of my head. I felt the wound that Joseph had inflicted, my hair still damp. As I focused I could see I was back in the chamber, the ancient hall. There was a large fire bathing it with light, casting shadows that reached to the ceiling.

Joseph was screaming. He was nude and tied to one of the trees, his arms stretched to the sides and tied to protruding branches.

Before the idol was Lorena, contributing to the screams. She was on her back with her legs spread. A slightly older woman with a striking family resemblance spoke encouragingly in Spanish, long dark hair covering her bare breasts. A younger, facially similar woman danced around the fire, waving her arms to imaginary music. Her hair was in a pixie style, her nude body proudly on display.

These were Lorena’s sisters.

Lorena threw her head back and looked right at me, thick veins protruding from her forehead and neck as she groaned in agony. There were crocodiles all around the hall coming to witness the events too. One brushed against me as it passed, its scales rough against my skin. I cowered but it showed no hostility. With a final scream Lorena collapsed, and the sister standing over her smiled wide.

“Oh God, no!” Joseph screamed from the tree, thrashing his head from side to side. The sister held up Lorena’s baby, but it wasn’t human. It was reptilian. It had a long tail and a long snout. She said something in Spanish and the dancing sister repeated it.

Lorena slowly got to her feet, looking shaky as she met her sisters by the fire. They chanted together. The sister holding the baby crocodile screamed something, then she threw it into the flames. A single fireball erupted, then became nothing but embers. The dancing sister retrieved a knife from the idol steps and skipped towards Joseph.

“No, you crazy bitch!” he yelled, violently thrashing about. She made two cuts as he screamed, one on each of his inner thighs close to the groin. Blood streamed down his legs, causing two crocodiles below him to hiss and snap in a frenzy.

Lorena walked over to me and I rolled over, attempting to crawl away.

“No, Dani,” she said breathlessly. She helped me stand up and guided me to the idol, where the sisters were waiting.

I cried. “Please, Lorena. I don’t want to be here.”

“It cannot be undone,” she said. “This is a blessing.”

When we got to the idol, the older sister took my right hand and ran her fingers over the small puncture wounds on my palm. She then pointed to the spot on the idol marked with my blood. The three sisters showed their palms, all exhibiting scars from previous self-inflicted wounds.

“Le diste tu sangre a la madre,” she said, then paused as if taken by surprise. She rushed to me and stroked my belly, then took my face in her hands.

“Eres una hija del pantano,” she said. I looked to Lorena for help.

“You are a daughter of the swamp,” she smiled, rubbing my belly. “Congratulations.”

I pushed her hand away and shook my head. “No! I don’t want to be, I want to go home!”

The older sister picked up a crocodile skull from the idol steps. It was the top half only, and it had a headband attached inside. She placed it onto the younger sister’s head, then took another and placed it on Lorena.

“Hija del pantano,” she said, putting a skull on my head before finally putting one on herself. I barely resisted, feeling mentally and physically exhausted.

The sisters guided me to the fire, where they all began to chant again. Several crocodiles joined us, looking up at the flames. I cried under the skull for myself, and for Joseph. His eyes were wide and delirious, his screams hoarse from the damage they’d caused.

“Dani,” he stuttered. “Stop this madness, please…”

I felt his anguish. The sisters gripped my arms as they chanted loudly. The flames grew higher and a form began to take shape within. A tall hourglass figure with hair that flowed down to her buttocks, and long scaly jaws filled with pointed teeth. She must have stood at least eight feet tall as she roared into the chamber.

I don’t know how long she’d been away for, the one the sisters called *madre*, but one thing was clear as she looked at Joseph.

She was hungry.
