[\[Part 18\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1ho0pvq/the_call_of_the_breach_part_18/)

Lying on the cold pavement, I struggled to breathe, and the world seemed to move in slow motion.

Bits of red brick trickled down like rain from the sky, smoke clouded the air, and muffled shots echoed from all directions. Two limp figures sprawled on the pavement not far from me, one with an orange jumpsuit pockmarked with steaming red gashes, the other curled in serene repose under her torrents of crimson hair. A growing ruby-colored puddle under them slithered over the ground in all directions, and something about the sight cut through my shock like a knife through butter.

*No.*

Rolling onto my stomach, I forced my limbs to move, crawled over the cold ground even as more bullets snapped at the brickwork around me in angry flight. It was little more than several feet but felt like an eternity until my hand closed on Andrea’s sleeve.

Both ocean-blue eyes stared far away, her face still as water in a glass, and my heart collapsed in on itself in disbelief.

“*Andrea!*”

Boots thundered over the cratered street beside me, and someone crashed to their knees to scoop her up in their arms. My hearing still rang from the rocket propelled grenade, but I didn’t need to hear the screams to know who they were.

Lucille held her sister in a desperate embrace, tears streaming down her paper-white cheeks. She’d thrown aside her rifle, and didn’t duck the incoming rounds that hissed close to her ears, merely rocking back and forth on her knees as she cradled Andrea’s head against her collarbone. Hunched over the last family she had, the girl wailed with a heartbreak that would never mend, a broken cry that made even the howl of battle seem mild in its horrible tenor.

More of our soldiers appeared from the gloom around us, firing back at the enemy, while medics rushed to drag the fallen away. Shells whistled through the air with renewed vengeance, and the concussive shockwave from each nearby explosion made it difficult to draw a breath. A few men tried to grab Lucille by the arms to drag her to safety, but she fought them like a wild animal, shrieking her sister’s name over and over, refusing to let Andrea’s body go.

“Hannah!” Someone yanked me to a sitting position, and like a switch had been flipped in my brain, all the ringing stopped, and my head cleared.

I drew my Mauser from its holster at my hip, and accepted Ethan’s hand up, machine gun rounds dancing on the ground around our feet. Together we darted to one of the old cars that had been left behind during the battle and ducked behind its ruined engine compartment for something like cover. Another hulking figure lay on his side a few yards from our current position, and my blood cooled at the superhero-handsome face locked into a horrified stare, his eyes filled with confusion, skin speckled with blood.

Sean didn’t move, but from his facial expression, I knew he was alive. He stared at Andrea’s dead body, and I saw the courage melt from him, the steely resolve fade like a dying flame. Underneath came an almost boyish agony, a youthful, innocent pain that made itself known in his own silvery tears. He’d been our fearless leader, our source of immovable strength, the voice of reason, hope, and fairness, but now he looked just as broken as Lucille. Of all the things Sean Hammond had seen, endured, or expected, it seemed this had never been one of them.

*I can’t tell if he’s hit or not. Does it matter? How could anyone feel anything after seeing something like that?*

Ignoring the storm of lead, Ethan ran to his friend and tried to help him up, but Sean waved him off, refusing to look away from the bloody spectacle in front of him.

“We have to go!” Ethan shook him by the shoulder as hard as he could, and the air filled with white smoke as our side threw smoke grenades to keep us hidden from the enemy sharpshooters. “Sean, we have to get off the square! For God’s sake man, the enemy is coming!”

*The focus* slid into place almost out of reflex, and with it came a crushing sense of doom that flooded my chest to drown all hope. In the ground under me, I caught the subtle vibrations of heavy vehicles moving, more trucks or perhaps even the fabled ELSAR tanks we’d been hunting somewhere in the city, ready to pounce at last. Thousands of rifles coughed from all over the line, and artillery split the sky with howling fury. Fighting hadn’t just resumed, it was intensified, as if the enemy had been holding back up until this point.

Horrified at the information being fed to my synapses by the enhanced senses, I slumped against the burnt-out car, and squeezed my eyes shut.

“A trap.” I croaked, just to myself, the others so close I could have reached out to touch them, but in that moment, so far away. “It was rigged from the start. They’re boxing us in.”

“*Wurnauw!*” A deep, hateful roar sliced through the air, and I swiveled my neck to see Sean up on one knee, the child-like shock gone from his expression, replaced by a seething, violent rage that would have scared me if I wasn’t already petrified.

He shrugged off Ethan’s hand, and instead Sean leapt to his feet, snatching an M4 from one of the coalition soldiers that had come to help us. With the rifle in tow, Sean threw himself at breakneck speed toward the closest enemy-occupied building, an outpost set in a two-story red-brick building that had once been a pizza parlor. It stuck out like a small bulge from the enemy lines, and the last of the ELSAR delegation vehicles had retreated there in wake of the ambush, rubble from our artillery blocking their exit. The crews of said truck were already scurrying to the bombed-out shop in question under heavy fire from our side, rockets sailing in to target their rig, and I caught a glimpse of the sheriff as he sprinted into the outpost.

“Sean, come back!” Ethan desperately shouted after him, but Sean didn’t seem to hear anything anymore, moving like a bolt of lightning across no-man’s-land.

At top speed, Sean charged the enemy head-first, zig-zagging through obstacles, dodging enemy fire with a carelessness to his own survival that bordered on manic, and continued to bellow that single name over and over into the din.

“*Wurnauw!*”

From behind my cover, I gaped at the scene, unable to look away from something that I knew had to end in tragedy.

*He’s going to get himself killed.*

“We’ve got to keep him covered.” Ethan ripped another long gun from the stunned hands of its owner and beckoned me to join him as a few other soldiers took off in a sprint to assist their commander. “Hurry, before he gets too far ahead! Come on, Brun, we need you.”

Gripping my Mauser in one white-knuckled fist, I took two steps to go after him, and my eyes locked with Lucille’s.

She remained there, surrounded by death and fire, clinging to Andrea with hopelessness in her gore-spattered face. Both chestnut brown irises pleaded with me, begged me to stay, to help, to do something that would make it all make sense. Lucille was my soldier, my aide-de-camp, but more than that, she was my friend. She’d been the closest thing I had to a little sister, and with her real family gone, I was all she had left. Yet, I was an officer of the coalition, a ranger, and our commander was in trouble. Without Sean our entire strategic command might fall apart, and with Crow’s forces advancing on us, we needed him now more than ever. I had to make a choice, and this time there was no Chris, Jamie, or anyone else to help me find the right path.

*God forgive me.*

“I’m sorry.” I choked the words out, saw Lucille’s already wounded gaze crumple under the reality of my decision, and turned to hurl myself into the chaos.

My feet flew over the cracked and pockmarked roadway as I charged after the others, our miniature salient across the square drawing every bullet the enemy could throw at us. Both lungs ached from the cold air forced into them, my boots slid and caught on bits of rubble, and the cold air stung my face. One of the men with us went down as a sniper caved his skull in, but I couldn’t take a second to stop for him, or I’d end up the same way. Our smokescreen was clearing, and in a matter of seconds we would be completely exposed to the most contested battle line in our entire front. While my brain screamed to grab his discarded rifle, I knew a single misstep would be the end of me, and so I raced onward with nothing but my 9mm pistol in hand.

The yawning maw of ELSAR’s anti-tank ditch drew near, and I wormed my way between the hedge of barbed wire, abatis logs, and steel spikes in the same fashion the others did ahead of me. Sean had been the one to find the gap, though from how far in front he ran, I had no idea if it had been by luck, design, or sheer will in his lust for vengeance. We were very close to the enemy trench line, too close, and my gut squirmed in alarm at how insane this was.

*What if Chris comes after me? He’d never make it across without the smoke. If I lose him like Sean lost Andrea . . . maybe I’ll go crazy too.*

Dropping down into the muddy bottom of the trench, its ends ragged from where heavy machinery had been used to tear up the pavement, I slogged through the mire to join the others. Frigid water seeped into my boots from the ankle-high muck, my nice green uniform was already smeared with mud and blood, and my braid had come undone at some point so that the brown hair was tangled around my ears like a bird’s nest. I longed for my Type 9, but it was far to the rear in Chris’s keeping, and I only had a few magazines for my antique clone of a handgun. If I ran out of ammunition then all that would be left was my ranger’s knife, and that prospect didn’t fill me with confidence.

*Boom.*

“Here!” Ethan waved to me from the next bend in the trench, just as a grenade explosion erupted somewhere ahead, followed by more erratic rifle fire.

Hunching down with the other two soldiers as lead tore apart the air above the trench, I leaned close to hear his instructions, my ears picking up every noise with annoying clarity. Thanks to my mutation, the ringing in both eardrums healed at advanced speed, only to return a few moments later from the intense gunfire all around us, making the world constantly fade in and out in terms of sound. Focusing on anything became difficult, as my brain had something of an ADD meltdown over the sheer bombardment of stimulation, and I had to grit my teeth against the tide of sensation to keep my attention in the right place.

“He’s somewhere up ahead.” Ethan poked his rifle over the top of the trench to loose off a couple rounds at the enemy, their positions close enough I could hear shouts on the other side of the ditch ramparts. “Good news is that he’s drawing their fire. If we move fast enough, they might lose us in the confusion, so stay low and keep your head down.”

The other two, a thin man with a scraggly red beard and a younger one with blonde hair buzzed close to his skull looked like they wanted to argue but seemed to recognize, as did I, that we were too deep into this mess to go back. Whatever unhinged plan was in Sean’s head, the only way for us to survive was to follow on into the morass and pray at least some of us made it out.

Ethan pulled a yellow-painted grenade from a pouch on his war belt and tossed it over the edge of the trench above us.

*Ka-whump.*

On the heels of the explosion, we scuttled around the bend like rats in a sewer, the agonized screams of wounded men assaulting our ears from the enemy trench line above the anti-tank ditch. Bloody chunks of flesh greeted my eyes on the slopes of reddish-brown clay, paltry remains of two ELSAR soldiers who never made it away from a previous explosion, likely the handiwork of Sean. A hand lay half-submerged in a pool of stagnant water, and a one-armed torso perched on the edge of the muck, intestines hanging like greasy purple ropes. Three more dead men were scattered further down the trench, their bodies intact, and Ethan paused to strip one of the plate carriers off a dead soldier, along with the man’s scoped rifle. We didn’t have much body armor in the coalition, save for what the militia men had before the Breach, or what little we captured from the enemy intact. Usually by the time we got hold of it the body armor was pretty well destroyed, so any chance to grab a set of intact plates as treated as a golden opportunity. They fetched an astronomical price in the market, and efforts by our armorers to make their own had been hampered by material being needed for more important projects, like the gun trucks, new production ammo, or more weapons.

Here we had a few seconds reprieve from the inferno of death that only grew in its fury by the minute, and the red bearded man knelt to strip anything useful from the second dead mercenary. Catching our breath from the heart-stopping run across the square, the blonde kid and I exchanged glances over the third corpse.

With an uncertain prod from his boot, he nudged the muddy plate carrier on the dead man’s body, which was speckled with metal shrapnel, blood, and bits of bone from the decimated men. “You want it?”

*God only knows what kind of mashed-gut-soup is underneath all that nylon.*

Fighting the nausea that mental image produced, I shook my head. “I don’t think it’s going to do anyone any good. Some of those holes go all the way through, see? Too many sharp things stuck in it, not worth the infection.”

At the base of the trench, Ethan paused beside an exposed section of the aged foundation for the pizza-shop outpost, from which shouts and gunfire spat forth as the ELSAR defenders did battle with our forces across the square. He pointed to a fresh set of footprints in the mud that led to a nearby blown out window, where someone had scrambled up the steep sides of the anti-tank ditch to climb inside.

“I’ll go first.” He leaned close so we could hear him above the roar of automatic weapons above, and tapped each of us with his finger so we couldn’t miss his commands over the din. “Liebner, you’re second in, Hart you’re third, and Brun watches our tail.”

I couldn’t help the indignant frown that came over my face at being given the fourth slot, a place usually reserved for beginners. “Why can’t I take point?”

“Because your eyesight is better than anyone’s.” Ethan’s gaze lifted to scan the trench edges behind us, and he held the scoped rifle out to me. “The moment we climb up, we’re surface level again, and every sniper from here to the wall is going to be waiting. You keep them off us while we find Sean and get this thing under control, yeah?”

Holstering my pistol, I took the weapon and turned it over in my hands. It was an AR platform rifle, similar to the M4’s we captured from ELSAR, but with a nice scope, camouflage paint coat, and a smaller twenty round magazine. It wasn’t much heavier than my submachine gun, and I accepted two extra magazines offered to me by Ethan, stuffing them into a spare pouch on my war belt.

“Okay.” I press-checked it like Jamie had taught me to do, ensuring there was a round in the chamber, and steadied myself for the climb. “I’ll cover you as best I can. Let’s go.”

At that, the red-bearded man produced his own two smoke grenades and tossed them out of the trench to fog the area around the smashed window in a cloud of salty white vapors.

I clawed at the mud to haul myself upward with the others, out of the gouge in the earth and into the fiery world of men once more. Not once in the entire interval of our journey through the anti-tank ditch had the battle slackened off above us, and it was like climbing into a hailstorm of fire. Snipers zeroed in on our movements almost immediately, and I could feel the air moving around me as bullets came far too close.

A small pile of shattered bricks lay near the window from the shelling, and I slithered behind them for cover, propping the scoped rifle up so I could peer through the reticle. Behind me, my companions jumped one-by-one into the hole in the wall, and as the blonde kid made his way in, a shot kicked up the muck at his heels.

Squinting hard into the long dark tube of the scope, I swept the crosshairs over the nearby buildings and forced my breathing to slow. *The focus* came to me as easily as breathing did, and I hunted for the flash of a rifle scope, a blur of movement, anything to give away the man who fired the shot.

*Where are you, come on, come on . . .*

As my eyes sharpened, a glob of dark motion on a third-story window caught my attention, and I rested the crosshairs over the shadow.

*Bang.*

The rifle jolted against my shoulder, somewhat harsher than my Type 9, but still manageable. Jamie had taught me to shoot many different kinds of weapons back at New Wilderness, and I’d become moderately proficient with every gun in the armory. Armalite type rifles like this one were easy to use, but it took every ounce of *the focus* to compensate for the shaking brought on by pure adrenaline in my system.

In the window, the blur dropped like a sack of potatoes, and I let myself enjoy a small grin.

*That’s one less.*

“You’re clear, Brun, come on over!” Ethan called from the building, and I dragged myself through the icy mud on both elbows, not daring to stand up for the number of angry bullets that hurtled my way. I wasn’t the only one who knew how to use a scope, and several times I felt my heart skip a beat for how close the rounds came to me, their hateful *snap-snap* like the drone of a hornet swarm.

At long last, I lunged to both feet and dove headfirst into the window, landing on the floor in a rather ungraceful heap.

Two hands grabbed the shoulders of my uniform coat to pull me away from the window as a wave of lead slammed all around us, and I crawled into the corner of the room to huddle beside my fellows as the battel raged on outside the beleaguered structure.

“We need to find the stairs.” Ethan waved the barrel of his rifle at the nearby corpses of an ELSAR machine gun team, slumped behind their weapon. “I’m guessing Sean’s on the second floor by now. Stay away from the windows and follow me.”

Much like the outside, this turned out to be a half-crawling, half crouching affair, as the walls and windows were shot through by the heavy volume of incoming rounds. To stand up too close to an exterior wall would have been suicide, and multiple enemy soldiers were slumped all over the floor, some dead from the crossfire. Most, however, seemed to have been killed by a threat instead the house, one that we sought with fraternal desperation as the four of us crawled over the cooling bodies like snakes in a pit. Even once we found the stairs, the stairwell was speckled with windows that overlooked the western edge of the square, all of them shattered to pieces, and each time we passed a glass-strewn hole, another sniper opened up on us.

As each of the three men took turns darting across the open spots like gophers in a field, I aimed from within the shadows behind the broken windows, and did my bets to fell their attackers before any rounds found their mark. Some were close, within a hundred yards of our building, while others were almost a quarter of a mile away or more, and these were difficult to spot. I didn’t get them all, but what ones I missed, I sprayed enough bullets at them that the enemy kept their heads down. It was a heart-pounding race to the top, the sound of gunfire not just outside, but inside, as the second floor above still held some active defenders, and we hoped our commander to be somewhere among them.

Pausing at the last bend in the stairwell before the top, I sucked in a ragged breath and palmed my belt for another of the stubby rifle magazines.

*All it’s going to take is one wrong step and—*

*Whack.*

Almost on cue, the blonde kid staggered sideways into the wall and slid to the floor as gouts of red gushed from his ribs on both sides of his torso.

He shrieked, his legs kicked in uncontrollable agony, but from the way he bled, I knew he didn’t stand a chance. The bullet had gone clean through the boy, and this far into the field, with the medic station a good half-hour belly crawl across no-man’s-land, he was finished.

“It came from the fancy three-story building!” The man with the red beard grabbed the blonde kid by one boot to drag him out of the line of fire. “On the roof, right side! I saw a flash near the owls!”

“On it.” As soon as the bolt closed on my rifle, I leaned around the corner and sighted in.

The sniper sat on the roof of what looked to be an old bank, pockmarked with shell holes. Talle than most other structures, it was just on the other side of the square from the building I occupied, to the extreme left flank of ELSAR’s center line. If these had been normal times, it would have been a few minutes’ walk from where our negotiations had been, but now it felt like staring across the whole world, an impossible distance.

Yet, there she was.

In the shadow of two faux concrete owls, Crow sat behind a scoped rifle much like the one I held, but black, and with a bipod on the front. Even at this range, with my hands shaking due to the fatigue and rush of battle, my enhanced sight easily found her short brown military ponytail, though she’d chosen an excellent spot that made her shape hard to pick out against the backdrop of the roof. No doubt she’d been working for a good few minutes, possibly killing more than just the blonde kid, and I could tell she too was scanning from how Crow hunched behind her scope.

My eyes flicked down at a blur of motion on the streets beneath her, and my curiosity peaked.

*What the . . .*

A fast-moving column of ELSAR regulars roared past in armored trucks, pulling back from the front with confused shouts between the turret-mounted gunners at one another, and I noted how Crow withdrew into the shadows of the cement owls to avoid their sight. In fact, the longer I looked, the more I realized that I could glimpse many retreating gray-uniformed figures, all of them regulars, as if the enemy couldn’t decide whether they were pulling out, or staying. Only those with green shield patches on their arms stayed behind, and a few even traded fire with their mercenary brethren when one of the regular officers tried to order them to follow.

It clicked with me then that this had all been by design, whether Koranti was in on it or not. Crow had fired the rocket that killed Andrea and Kaba, Crow had broken the truce before it could even start, and it had been Crow who pulled the rest of the armored trucks out so Wurnauw couldn’t get back to their main line. It hadn’t been some kind of knee-jerk reaction to the negotiations like I’d first thought.

Crow was staging an uprising against coalition and ELSAR alike.

*And if she wins, she’ll have control of the arsenal that Koranti would leave behind.*

Blood pressure rising, I tightened my finger on the trigger, but didn’t pull it.

“Look at me.” I hissed through clenched teeth, the memory of Tex, Andrea, and Kaba all fresh in my head as I squinted at their killer. “Look at me, I’m right here. I want you to know it’s me, I want you to know, *look at me*.”

All at once, Crow stiffened, and her subtle movements froze under the crosshairs of my rifle scope as she spotted my scope glare.

Neither of us moved a muscle, because we both knew the truth.

I was perched to Crow’s right . . . and her rifle was pointed left.

*Boom.*

From nowhere, a shell whistled down and exploded on the courthouse rooftop between us, sending a geyser of smoke, dust, and rubble into the air. My sights were clouded with the plume, and I squeezed the trigger to send a round into the abyss.

*Bang.*

Blinking through the scope, I cursed myself under my breath as the smoke cleared to reveal an empty rooftop, Crow nowhere to be seen.

“We found him!” Ethan called down the stairs from above me, and I tore myself away from the window with seething bitterness at my own fumbling. I’d had her in my sights, should have just pulled the trigger, but now the murderous commander of the Organs would live another day. She was dangerous, that was plain to see, and sooner or later we would have to deal with her.

Thanks to me, it would have to be later.

At the top of the stairs, I found a narrow hallway with offices on each side. A few doors down from the one my companions were sheltered in, Sean stood with his back to us, firing a handgun toward the opposite end. Bodies of ELSAR men lay in a few places, spent brass casings littered the floor, and bullets holes etched the walls in a wandering stitchwork pattern. Sean’s rifle sat discarded by his feet, empty and smoking. He was covered in mud, blood, and soot, his clothes torn. There were slashes and holes in his uniform, evidence from where he’d gone hand-to-hand with the defenders of the ELSAR outpost, but their blades hadn’t stopped Sean’s volcanic rage. Like a force of nature, he’d cut through at least a dozen of the enemy on his climb, and the floor was red around Sean’s boots from the blood that dripped from his uniform. Even the gray plate carrier he wore, no doubt liberated from an ELSAR soldier in the process of his attack, was peppered with holes. I couldn’t tell what was a wound and what was spatter from something else, but our commander didn’t seem to care as he fired back down the hall with fiery hatred in his bellows.

*Bang.*

“Wurnauw!” Sean sent two more rounds into the far corner, and I caught the flicker of someone behind that wall shuffling back a step. “Come out! Get out here, you coward!”

*Bang, bang, bang.*

“You did this Hammond!” A similar angry shout came from down the hall, and I recognized the sheriff’s wavering voice as it bounced off the walls. “This is your fault! You couldn’t stay quiet, you couldn’t shut your mouth and do your damn job, and now—”

*Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.*

“You lied to us!” Sean thundered back, his face redder than I’d ever seen it, both from blood and fury. “About everything! The mutants, ELSAR, the Cromwell girl, it was all a lie!”

*Wait . . . Cromwell?*

That name struck a chord in my memory, and while I stayed hunkered behind our corner further from Sean, I found myself reliving that walk through the check-in hut back at New Wilderness, seeing the faces of the dead in the various pictures, reading their names behind each lit candle. I knew that name.

More importantly, I knew the face it went with.

*Bang.*

“I did what I had to do!” Wurnauw shot back, more with his mouth and less with his gun, which I suspected was running low on ammunition. “There was a plan, it would have worked, but you wouldn’t listen! No one was supposed to get hurt.”

Sean loaded another magazine into his handgun, and his jaw worked with a coiled anger that could have lit a nuclear reactor. “Tell that to Andrea! Tell that to Randy! *Tell that to Jacob Walker!*”

*Bang.*

Another bullet zinged down the hall, and Wurnauw let out a pained cry.

Sean lunged from behind his alcove to barrel down the hall, emptying the pistol in his hand at the sheriff’s corner, the drywall reduced to little but dust, wood from the studs splintering.

Wurnauw limped from behind the corner to raise his gun, but Sean had already closed the distance and tackled him to the floor in a flying leap.

Ethan charged from behind his cover to follow, but even as we reached the end of the hall, all three of us that remained slowed to a cautious halt at what we saw.

Sean sat astride Wurnauw’s chest and rained blow after blow on the sheriff’s face with his fists. Fresh crimson speckled his arms, his face, but Sean kept going, throwing his full strength into each strike. I heard bones give way under his assault, Wurnauw’s flailing slowed to dull twitches, and despite the rumble of battle outside, I couldn’t help but hold a respectful distance. There was nothing more to be done, and even as we looked on, Sean roared in an animalistic hate laced with a pain deeper than anything I’d heard before. It was the sound of a man truly decimated, a man who had lost everything, and it reminded me with bitter guilt of Lucille’s cries as she held her sister’s motionless body.

*And I left her behind out there, in that street, to carry Andrea back by herself. Will she punch me when we get back? Do I deserve it?*

Sean’s hammer-fisted punches slowed, his grunts more and more ragged as his strength gave out, until at last he slid off his opponent.

Leaning against the opposite wall, he rested his unkempt head against the crumbled drywall and spat a stream of blood out from between his teeth. Both his eyes stared off into space, as if Sean was in a state of shock, and I noticed the first definite bullet wound just under the lower edge of his armored vest.

“Sir?” I broke from the other two men to shuffle forward, and knelt in front of Sean so our eyes could meet. “You’re hit, you need medical attention. We have to get you out of here, okay? Sean?”

At his name, the dark, Hollywood-handsome eyes flicked to me, and I saw no anger there, no fear, just pure indifference, as though every ounce of will had left Sean’s muscular frame.

Taking his silence for consent, I dug into the medica pouch on my war belt with trembling hands and found the gauze rolls. However, the more I probed at him, packed each wound to stifle the flow, the more I uncovered, until my arms were rusty-red with blood. Sean’s stolen plate carrier was in tatters, the ceramic armor plates underneath crumpled to pieces from numerous stopped rifle rounds. On top of close to ten different shrapnel wounds, he had taken six bullets on his mad dash to find vengeance, and at least one was still lodged inside his right hip. How on earth he’d kept moving, I didn’t know, but as the effects of adrenaline began to wear off, I could see Sean’s energy failing. Like the blonde kid, who lay dead not ten feet down the hall, if we didn’t get our commander to an aid station soon, he would be joining the list of those we would have to bury tonight.

“She liked roses, did you know that?” He rasped, his voice hoarse from shouting, and barely flinched as I cinched a tourniquet on his left leg to stop a nasty bleed from a hole in his foot. “Yellow ones, not the girly pink kind. She told me she wanted to buy a house in the country someday, and plant yellow roses under her window so she could smell them in the morning.”

“I know.” I bobbed my head along with what he was saying if only to keep Sean awake, and focused on pressing more gauze to each gash in his battered flesh. Chris had taught me some more advanced first aid during our spare time in New Wilderness, and I’d learned more in recent weeks thanks to my position as an officer, but it always felt strange doing it for real. “I’m so sorry, Sean. Can you tell me if you’re having any trouble breathing?”

He made a slight shake of his head.

“Okay.” I glanced at the others, and Ethan threw me a nod from where he watched over the stairs just in case ELSAR sent a team of men to retake their outpost. “Well, we’re going to get you back to headquarters, alright? Can you—”

“She would have said yes.” He didn’t have any tears left, but from how he looked at me, I knew Sean was right back down in that valley, back in that pain, all the high of vengeance burnt away with the finality of his circumstances. “That’s what she told me. If all this was different, if things were normal, she would have said yes to me. I never wanted anything so bad.”

*“Sparrow One Actual, this is Rhino One Actual, please respond.”*

Startled by the sudden noise, I glanced down at a larger pouch on my belt, where my radio headset was collapsed down to be more portable. I’d brought it out of habit to the negotiations, confident it wouldn’t go off due to ELSAR’s jamming, and to hear it now, out of the blue, was almost surreal. With all that had been going on, I hadn’t paid much mind to try and use it, but hearing Chris’s voice, and looking into the haunting, empty gaze of Sean made ice work its way through my belly.

“I’m here.” Fumbling with the leather flap of the pouch, I ripped the headset out and jammed it down over my ears to click the mic button. “I-I’m okay, but Sean’s hurt bad. We’re going to try and get him back across the square.”

*“Stay where you are, I’ll send a truck out for you.”* Chris didn’t seem to mind my lack of radio protocol, his voice as relieved in tone as I felt, and he too spoke in shorter, simpler phrases. *“I need you back here, in one piece. What the hell happened?”*

The red bearded man and Ethan worked to pick Sean up, each winding an arm over their shoulders as they carried his toward the stairs. It would be a long journey back down to the ground floor, then to the anti-tank ditch, then beyond the wire to whatever vehicle Chris sent for us. Already I was conscious of how filthy I was, covered from head to toe in mud, blood, and brick dust, but in that moment, I honestly wasn’t sure how to gauge my thoughts. Sean had always been a superhero-like figure to us all, our infallible leader, a man amongst men that inspired us to strive for greatness. He’d been the one we hoped would take over once the war was done, the one to negotiate on our behalf, to bring our story to the world so justice could be served, and now . . . now he was a bloody, silent husk.
