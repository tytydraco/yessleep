**DAY 4**

Phone died. I think batteries drain faster in here. I don’t know what time it is. No way to tell. 

I didn’t come across any more service spots after the last post I made anyway. 

I am writing in my journal to keep me sane.

I saw the creatures. Last night after I walked for hours, maybe even days. They were suddenly illuminated by my flashlight in the dark, lining the sides of the tunnel, just watching me. At least I think — they didn’t have eyes. Probably evolved to be rid of them after centuries in the tunnel, maybe? 

They hummed my tune again, softly, almost indistinguishable from the whistling of the wind. 

They were humanlike, but dark grey, veiny, skinny, tall. Limbs slightly too long. Again, no eyes, and just small holes for a nose and ears. 

Where was the mouth?

I walked past them all, backs pressed flat against the tunnel walls with their arms pinned to their sides.

I passed hundreds of them, noticing more and more features. Huge flat feet planted firmly to the ground. Long, sharp fingernails on fingers with at least 5 knuckles. 

One on its own, standing in the middle of the tunnel, blocking my path. Its back to me. 

I stopped. Should I speak? 

I stood there watching it for some time, debating what I should do. 

I turned around. All of those things were now facing towards me: leaning, peering around each other. Their humming grew louder.

I looked back to the one standing in front of me. It, too, faced me now. I gasped, overtaken by its putrid gasoline smell and its slimy, featureless face. 

Then, its face started… splitting. Its skin was pulling, ripping apart. Dark blood oozed as its flesh tore.

It opened wide and I looked inside. Look inside. Look inside. Look inside.

I saw everything. 

The answer.

I’m going crazy in here. Never-ending darkness, the same tunnel walls, the same puddles and pebbles, the same strange noises echoing through this hollow tomb. 

GET ME OUT GET ME OUT

I’m afraid I’ve seen too much. That they won’t let me leave now that I know things. 

I know what they are, what I am, what we are. Collective consciousness. Nothing matters, everything is meaningless, or is everything full of meaning?

I’m not making any sense. 

I need to conserve my light. 



**DAY 6**

I understand now. I cannot leave. This is where I am meant to be; I ended up here for a reason. 

They never wanted to hurt me. They wanted to show me. 

I am more than this body, this life. I am more than a lost drifter, constantly searching for meaning, for a place I belong. 

I was right; we are all connected. Except we aren’t living parallel lives — we are all living the same life in different universes.

In one universe, we are me, and in another, we are you. We are everyone, all at once. 

When I looked inside

I saw everything. I saw every human experience. Everything you’ve ever done, everything anyone’s ever done. I possess the knowledge that comes with having billions upon billions of life experiences.

All of you have it, too. You just need to look inside. You just need to look inside. You just need to look inside. 

Look inside. 



**DAY 7**

I walk with them now. 

We hum together.

My daughter’s body was found by a hunter and his two young sons. She was somewhere in a Nebraskan wildlife management area. Poor kids were traumatized. 

My daughter was… troubled. She dealt with paranoid delusions and manic depressive episodes throughout her life. She would often disappear for weeks at a time. 

I worried, of course, as any mother would. But I had called the cops to report her missing so many times, just for her to show back up at home a couple weeks later. The cops stopped taking me seriously after the 15th time, and I don’t blame them.

June, my daughter, was lost. A lonely, sick young woman who wandered the planet like a ghost. 

Please don’t go looking for this “tunnel” she was clearly so obsessed with in her final days. There was no goddamn tunnel anywhere near her body. She was found dead in the woods, leaning against a tree. We still have yet to locate her car.

She had gouged out her eyes with her bare hands. She had broken her own jaw, so her mouth hung open wide. Beside her, her journal, with the entries I uploaded here. I figured you all might appreciate the closure these would provide. I didn't want any of you thinking she was still out there, and, God forbid, go looking for her, just to get as lost as she was.

It was only a matter of time. 

I’m just glad that June finally felt connected to something when she passed. 

I feel connected, too. Ever since I identified her body at the morgue. Ever since I saw
