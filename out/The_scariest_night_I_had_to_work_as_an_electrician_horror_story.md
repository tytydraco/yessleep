This event occurred in the middle of a Saturday afternoon in January in the year of 2012. My town was left uncertain about whether or not it would snow that day. I headed to the living room with the one and only purpose of wanting to check the weather forecast. Upon turning the television on, I navigated my way through the channels until I landed on the weather channel. When I learned that the snow wouldn’t come for a while, I immediately grabbed my car keys and headed towards the garage door. This would allow me to make a quick trip to the grocery store.

After some time had passed, I was about to leave the store with my groceries in hand. As soon as I stepped out into the cold winter air, I felt the freezing temperatures penetrate the layers of clothing that I was wearing. This caused me to listen to the wind’s howling and take in the snowflakes’ mystical movement, catching my attention as I walked towards my car.

The temptation to shiver uncontrollably was overwhelming, as the coldness of the wind touching my face was too much to bear. Being curious about the size of the snowflakes, I outstretched my hand and looked at their complex designs as they fell onto clothing. Glancing at the snowflakes, I noticed that they were slightly smaller than the size of a dime. This made it seem like I was trapped inside of a winter wonderland.

Shortly after I got home, I unpacked the groceries and got settled in for the night. Not too long afterwards, my employer contacted me and asked if I could cover the night shift for the night. Fully aware that no one else could make it due to the snowstorm. This forced me to cancel my plans for the night. Despite the snowstorm, I now had a job to do. I layered back up and headed out to my garage to begin my journey to the worksite.

Upon entering the garage, I took my place in the driver’s seat of my Jeep Gladiator and started the engine. The garage offered no signs of relief from the cold, which led me to try at least a dozen times to restart my Jeep. After a few tries, it suddenly rumbled to life, filling the air with the sound of its engine.

I drove down a dark, and deserted road to get to the job site. The task that was assigned to me was located inside of a power plant. As soon as I had arrived, I wasted no time and quickly entered the building. This allowed me to begin working on my assigned task for the night. Due to the power outage that was caused by the snowstorm, I had a lot of work to take care of.

The power plant is on the outskirts of town, next to a cornfield and a pond. Despite the challenge of finding it, the view and signal once you arrive there are worth the trouble. The building’s design features see-through floors that enhance the spaciousness. It provides the workers with a one-of-a-kind view of the other levels. The power provided by this place is top-notch and is distributed to the rest of the town.

When it had finally reached the time for my break, I stepped out into the brisk climate. As soon as I exited  the building, I indulged in a quick smoking break inside of my Gladiator despite my boss’s no-smoking policy.

As I was nearing the end of my break time, the wind picked up speed. It began to lash against my Jeep as I finished my smoke break. Upon stepping out of my Jeep Gladiator, I was met with an unsettling noise. The sound seemed to originate from either the cornfield or pond that were nearby, however, I couldn’t tell due to the wind.

Despite the rumors of the skinwalker and wendigo sightings. I couldn’t resist the irresistible urge to explore the area for myself. I grabbed my flashlight out of my jeep. Following that, I shone it around the dark and mysterious area. As I began to check my surroundings, my heart began to race with anticipation. I hoped that I would hear the sound again and follow it to the source.

Soon after, I discovered a hill that was 13-20 feet tall, which was incredibly steep. When I reached the highest point of the snowy hill, I was met with the stillness of the snow-covered landscape. It enveloped me in a profound silence. With my trusty flashlight in hand, I carefully examined the area, hoping to hear the same sound I previously heard. When I wasn’t getting anything, I began the journey back to the worksite.

At that moment, I noticed something red in the distance. As I got closer, I realized that it was a trail of bloody footprints. Being intrigued by the trail of bloody footprints, I decided to follow them to see where they led. They led me to a beautifully built barn. It rested in between a cornfield and a pond.

As I approached the barn, I could feel the warmth radiating from the walls. After rounding a corner, the sight of a hatch drew my attention, and I decided to check it out. Upon inspection, I discovered an underground house. I couldn’t resist the urge to explore it. As I made my way down the stairs, I noticed the door was slightly open.

While I made my way deeper inside, an orange glow from an electrical fireplace caught my eye. Next to the fireplace sat a middle-aged man. He looked like he was in his late forties. He was all bundled up in flannel blankets. The next thing I noticed was the creaking of his rocking chair. This was the only sound within the quiet room. Beside him rested a shotgun; its stock appeared to be worn smooth from the years of use.

A few moments later, I noticed a humanoid looking creature that was starting to stand up. The predator was hiding behind the man’s chair, carefully observing its next prey. It had pointed ears and sharp, jagged teeth. Spotting the creature was challenging due to the flickering shadows that obscured its unremarkable yellow eyes and pale gray skin. The dim light made it hard to see the creature’s razor-sharp claws. However, the blood that was covering them gave them a menacing glow at the end of its bony arms.

Despite my efforts to warn him, I froze in complete terror as the man fell into danger right before me. Fearing that the creature would chase me, I ran back to the worksite. Upon my return to the power plant, I frantically searched for anything that I could use to barricade the doors with.

Little did I know, there was a secret underpass that led all of the way to the house. Assuming that I was completely safe, I returned to work on my task for the night. I knew my job was at stake if I didn't restore power quickly.

Just as I was on the verge of completing my task, a loud noise from the dungeon startled me. The noises were ominous and foreboding, and I could feel a chill run down my spine. The basement stairs led directly into a passageway that led directly to my workstation that I was working at.

After reaching the floor of where I was working, the creature, wendigo-like in appearance, let out a menacing shriek. Its gaze swept across the area in search of any trace of me. My headlamp soon caught its attention, and it immediately scampered towards me on all fours. Had I not completed my work task at that very moment, I shudder to think what might have become of me, and whether I would be alive today to tell this story or not.

Once I noticed the creature, I, a beginner in parkour, sprinted towards the edge so that I could perform a wall run. While I was jumping, I caught enough air, which allowed me to grab a few pipes. I then turned my entire body directly towards the wendigo and faced it.

With all of my might, I launched myself at the wendigo, causing it to stumble backwards. The impact was so forceful that the creature collided with the wall, leaving a dent in its surface. I swear that I used my entire body weight to hurl myself right at it. The moment I hit the cryptid, I felt a satisfying crunch of its flesh and bone beneath me, causing it to writhe in complete agony. It had fallen down, but to my surprise, it stood back up when I least expected it to.

The creature’s swift recovery quickly caught me off guard and In no time, it was hot on my heels. It began to chase me up the nearby staircase up to the fifth floor. In order to evade being caught. I had to shake off my active pursuer and quickly devise a plan. Despite the fact that it was a risky move, I was willing to take the chance. With quick movement, I turned off the light that was located on my helmet. This caused the darkness to engulf me, leaving me feeling vulnerable. I was left unsure if the cryptid could track me down using my scent.

With my assignment now completed, I began the dangerous journey back to my Jeep. Maintaining to keep a sharp eye out for any signs of danger. While I was in the process of trying to sneak around the building, I could hear the wendigo’s footsteps getting closer. Knowing that it wasn’t that far off, I quickened my pace. In search of a secure and peaceful descent from the fifth to the second floor. I found a padded cushion that helped cushion my landing, and it heavily reduced the noise.

Upon landing on the cushion of the second floor, I remembered that I had blocked off the doors on the level below earlier that night. Knowing that my options were limited. My eyes scanned the room until they settled on a window that seemed to offer a glimpse of what was beyond it. That was the moment I spotted another area of the roof that wasn’t more than 10 feet away. It seemed like it would be a good landing place if I could manage to catch enough air.

As I readied myself, my heart pounded inside of my chest. I suddenly heard movement that was right behind me. The sound triggered my swift reaction speed, and I made a sprinting leap towards the part of the roof that I had planned to land on. I knew that would be the fastest way back to my vehicle.

After finally landing on the rooftop, I paused to catch my breath as I took in the beauty of the snow-covered landscape. Working my way down into the snowy landscape, I felt grateful for being alive. The next thing I did was perform a barrel roll when I reached the ground, which helped soften my landing.

While I was in the process of making my way back through the snow to my vehicle, the creature quickly descended the wall. It was heading right towards me. My heart was racing as I trudged through the snow as fast as I could. I jumped into my Jeep Gladiator and floored the gas pedal, the engine roaring to life. The sound of my tires squealing echoed around the corner as I took off, heading home. During the drive, I made a difficult phone call to my boss and submitted my two-week notice.
