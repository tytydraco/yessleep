About 3 months ago, my former roommate and his girlfriend decided they were going to move in together. On the surface I couldn’t have been happier for the two of them, though I’ll admit I felt a pang of jealousy deep down because I was nowhere near doing that with a partner. Especially since I didn’t even have a partner.

After the hangover from the goodbye party had been tamed, I decided to do some budgeting. I calculated that I didn’t really need a roommate, but I knew I wouldn’t be happy living alone, and thought it could be fun to meet some new people. 

I don’t remember how many dud interviews I went through. They all felt like the human equivalents of the colour beige; boring, and dull beyond belief. It had to have been dozens because it was the 15th of the month by the time I met Jack, and we got on like a house on fire. 

As he was touring the apartment, he saw some posters I had in my room of bands that I like, he said he also loved their music, and named a few deep cuts from the bands that I absolutely gushed over, he also saw a collection of Star Wars merch I had and showed me pictures of some of his own that he had set up in his current place. All of his merch was still in its original packaging and I praised his restraint because I always had to open and pose all my figures as soon as I got home. 

This prompted me to ask why he was leaving his current place. 

“The landlord is selling the place. ‘Hot market’ or whatever. Only gave me a month’s notice, can you believe that?”

“Fuckin’ landlords.” I said in affirmation.

He then mentioned he liked watching stand-up comedy which was yet another interest we shared. He said he likes to watch it before bed because it helps with his mood when he wakes up in the morning. In hindsight this probably should’ve raised some red flags for me, but I was so caught up in the elation of finding what felt like a kindred spirit that I didn’t think much of it. 

I didn’t want to seem too eager so I said that I’d message him tomorrow, to let him know what I decided either way.

“See ya tomorrow.” He said with a wink as he left. 

After he left I took a look at the “roommate resume” I asked him to put together, just a list of previous addresses with contact info for the landlords, and a credit report. Jack had lived in 3 different apartments in as many years, and had a perfect credit rating, with the only recurring charges being his cell phone, and the rent for a storage unit across town. Always paid in full, and on time. 

I had already made my mind up at this point, but in the spirit of doing my due diligence I called Jack’s most recent landlord. 

“Hi, Sandy? My name’s Mason, I’m calling in reference to your current tenant Jack Kerninski.” 

I wasn’t really finished my sentence but for some reason I paused.

“Is this the police?” She said to fill the void.

“What? Uh, no. I’m just calling to ask about what sort of tenant Jack is, or if you have any insights into him as a person that I should know about before making him my roommate.”

“Oh! Okay, sure!” She perked up and almost sounded giddy. 

“Jack’s great! Very friendly and pleasant. Quiet as a mouse except for when he would get into his shows, but a quick text or knock and he’d quiet right down. And he’s a great cook! Such amazing smells coming from his suite. He’d often even share with me, as he frequently bought large cuts of meat and couldn’t eat it all himself. Exotic stuff, too. Pork, lamb, even sometimes the organs! Things like liver that before him I’d always gagged at the thought of! I had started to feel like I was living at a five-star hotel! He’s such a gourmand, you’re lucky.”

There was something in the back of my head that said it seemed like she was trying too hard to sell Jack to me, but because him and I got on so well, and because I was a crap cook, I ignored that thought. 

“He’s also quite the ladies man! Revolving door of women, I don’t think I ever saw the same girl twice!” 

“Thanks for all the info, Sandy. This has been very helpful.” 

“No, thank you!” She said, and I almost ended the call when I remembered what she said at the start of the call.

“Uh, one more thing, before I let you go. Why’d you think I was the police?” 

“Oh…” she paused for an awkwardly long moment “…you sounded so official when you introduced yourself! Jack doesn’t have any family here, so I’m his emergency contact. I was worried he might have been robbed or something!” 

“I didn’t realize I came off that way over the phone!” I said, but it felt like I didn’t believe either her words or mine. 

“Thanks, Sandy. Have a good night.” I said and hung up without listening to her farewell. My mind was preoccupied with questions I was doing my best to ignore, and replace with my daydreams of having a new best friend that would cook elegant meals for us as we listened to our favourite bands and talked about what the lyrics in the songs meant to us. 

I decided I’d message Jack in the morning with the good news. My still booze binge recovering thirty-year-old body and brain needed more sleep. 

The next morning I sent Jack the confirmation text. 

“Jack! It’s Mason. If you haven’t found any other place yet, I’d love for you to move in here!”

“Awesome! Super happy to hear that! Thanks!”

“When are you available for the move in? I could help you move out of your old place.”

“Moving van’s already packed. I could be at your place later today! Say around noon?”

“Sounds good. See you then.” 

Jack arrived precisely at Noon. The second the clock shifted from 11:59am to 12:00pm I heard the honk from the moving van, and I got up to greet him outside. 

“Told you I’d see you today!” Jack said as he walked to the rear of the van to open it and reveal his belongings.

Moving his stuff only took about an hour. He only had a bed and about 8 boxes of belongings consisting of clothes, books, collectibles, and CD’s, but we still acted like it was a great physical effort and that we needed pizza and beers afterwards. 

The rest of that day was normal. Jack spent it unpacking, and I spent it writing, the anxiety of looming deadlines hanging over my head. 

Around the time I usually ate dinner, Jack popped his head out of his room. 

“Hey, you hungry?” He asked

I paused to think and as if in reply, my stomach grumbled.

“Starved. I didn’t realize what time it was.” 

“Great! I’ll be back in a bit, gotta go get some ingredients.” 

Jack returned about an hour later with a plethora of fresh herbs, vegetables, and meat wrapped in brown deli paper that I didn’t recognize when he unwrapped it. 

“It’s fois gras. Fattened duck liver.” He said as if reading my mind. 

“It’s incredibly hard to find,” he continued as he prepared the ingredients “a lot of places consider the process animal cruelty because the ducks are force-fed until their livers become diseased and swell up to ten times their normal size. But I know a guy.” He looked up from what he was doing and winked at me with a smirk, without even stopping his swift knife work. With the way Jack glided around the kitchen, you could’ve told me I was watching a Michelin Star chef at work and I would’ve believed you. 

As he cooked he uncorked a bottle of vintage red wine, poured a small amount into a glass for a smell and taste test, then poured two glasses.

“A perfect pairing, don’t you think?” He asked as he watched me take a sip. 

“It’s…superb, but I gotta say, Jack, I think this might be a little…rich, for my blood. A fancy bottle of wine for me is the $50 bottles that I grab when they go on sale at the local liquor store. I don’t know if I can really appreciate this fully.” 

“Nonsense!” Jack exclaimed as he turned back to the sizzling pans.

“You know enough to appreciate it, just not enough to identify every aspect and enjoy its deeper layers. You’ll get there.” 

I was completely enamoured by this man. His every movement in the kitchen was measured, and as silky smooth as the surface of a still lake. He spoke with a reassuring tone that could melt all your fears and worries away, as he bathed you in affirmation and encouragement. He was charisma personified. 

That is what made what happened later that night all the more strange. 

“Alright man, I’m exhausted.” He said as he finished cleaning the dishes from dinner (I said I would but he insisted that he do it). 

I looked at the clock and noticed it was past midnight by then. 

“Oh shit it’s late. Yeah, time for bed!” 

“Goodnight, Mason.” He said, patting my shoulder once. 

“G‘Night, Jack.”

About half an hour later, I heard a laugh coming from Jack’s room. 

“Heh heh hehehehehe.”

I tried to ignore it, but it got louder. 

“Heh heh…HA HA HA HA HA HA HA”

If I didn’t know it was Jack in there, I would’ve thought that Mark Hamill had come over to record some audio as Joker in my apartment, Jack’s laugh sounded identical. It was uncanny. Every “ha” was pronounced but also sounded like it was all the same word, with a slight wheeze between each. I wouldn’t be able to sleep with it though so I got up to go knock on Jack’s door. 

“Come in.” Jack said after a short pause.

I opened the door to see Jack sat on his bed, on top of the covers. I hadn’t actually seen his room until this moment. It looked somehow both lived-in and sterile. The collectibles on his shelves were arranged spaced exactly the same distance apart, lined up perfectly with each other, the wires of his electronic devices were neatly tucked away, and everything was arranged in perfect right angles. Jack was sitting perpendicular on his bed, facing his tv across the room. The screen was paused on a frame of Kevin Hart, on top of which the title “stand-up compilation #21” hung. 

“Hey man, you mind keeping it down a little?” 

“Sorry, was I being loud? No problem, Mason, I’ll keep it down. Sleep well.”

“Thanks Jack. ‘Night.” 

After I had gone back to bed I heard him leave. Clearly making every effort to be quiet. 

This pattern went on for 2 months. 

Because of the massive amount of benefits there were to having Jack around, I didn’t really mind having to ask him to quiet down every night. It seemed superfluous. Every night he would cook these decadent five-star meals, exotic meats always paired with bottles of wine, champagne, or scotch that couldn’t have cost less than $500. He didn’t even flinch one night when I had a few friends over, and insisted that he cook for all 5 of us, he was almost excited by it, and the idea that I was going to order us pizza was simply unfathomable to him. He even talked and joked around with my friends, and whenever he’d laugh it was the same Joker-like laugh I heard every night. On hearing his laugh one of my friends shot me a look and I shrugged in reply, they raised an eyebrow at me then went back to the conversation. 

Eventually the laughing just became white noise to me. I had purchased noise-cancelling headphones but didn’t even take them out of the packaging because by the time they arrived, I could fall asleep to; 

“Heh heh hehehe HA HA HA HA HA HAHAHAHA AHA AHA AHA AHAHAHAHAHA” 

I stopped thinking much of it. “It’s just how he laughs” I told myself. 

Two weeks after Jack moved in, I started to feel like I was always being watched. Even when I was alone, when Jack had gone to work for the day. I couldn’t really explain why, or come up with any ideas how. My apartment window overlooked a park, with no other residential windows in line-of-sight of my window. I didn’t have interior security cameras, and Jack hadn’t set any up that I could see. 

The feeling was much more intense when Jack was around, and I still couldn’t figure out why. Sure, his gaze was intense, but he was sort of an intense person. In a fit of paranoia one night, when Jack was in his room, door closed, I wrote on a mini white board “I know you’re watching me, I found the cameras” held it up and faced my bedroom door. I waited two minutes for some kind of response before moving to the living room still holding the sign to my chest. Still nothing. 

“Heh heh hehehe HA HA HA HA HA HAHAHAHA AHA AHA AHA AHAHAHAHAHA” 

I pushed the feeling to the back of my mind. Surely, if I was being surveilled, the move with the sign would have brought my spy out, I thought. 

“Or maybe they just called your bluff” a voice in the back of my mind said. Another thought I pushed away. 

“Heh heh hehehe HA HA HA HA HA HAHAHAHA AHA AHA AHA AHAHAHAHAHA”
