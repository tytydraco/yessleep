**Rule 3 when dealing with the ANGELS: Once converted, an ANGEL retains all specialized knowledge but applies it to the new mandate.\*\***

"Come on, damn it. They should have been here by now."

My head was still throbbing as I pulled out my phone, finger clawing its way toward my sister's phone number, when the administrator slapped it out of my hand. "Are you crazy?" He was like a disgruntled parent, catching their child sneaking sweets after bedtime. The stakes now were obviously much higher.

"My sister," I stuttered out. "I need to warn her—"

The administrator's face hardened, then his expression eased slightly. "Did you hear about the incident at site 8-B in Colorado last year?" I shook my head. His tone was rhetorical anyway. He shifted his gaze toward the rushing fields of corn around us. "There was a breach. They were testing twins—one incarcerated, one civilian. They thought they could use the good twin's... essence, or whatever the hell it is, to cure the evil one. Turns out evil flows both ways. The good twin turned, and fast." He paused, searching for his next words. "When they put her down, sixteen men, sixteen good men, were dead." His eyes fell to the floor of the jeep. "Seventeen, if you count that site's administrator, and the brass didn't, when they tallied the cost. They don't let this shit get out. I don't want anyone else taking my lashes."

I brushed my hair out of my face. Maybe I had misunderstood him. "They're not gonna kill you—"

His voice dropped. "I'm as good as a dead man walking. I knew the consequences when I took the role." The veins in his arm strained against his skin. "We have a job to finish, and if we do it right, headquarters might at least spare you."

I couldn't look at him anymore. I was sitting in a jeep, escaping a nightmare with a guy already busy writing out his own eulogy.

The sound came before I could see them: a low rumble that grew into a roar. Two fighter jets screamed overhead, their silhouettes cutting through the darkening sky like knives. The administrator's whole body tensed as he watched them pass, continuing their trajectory toward the facility we'd just escaped.

"Finally," he breathed, but there was no relief in his voice. Only resignation.

Sebastian gripped the steering wheel tighter, his knuckles white. "How long until—"

The night lit up behind us.

Even from this distance, the explosion was massive. A column of fire erupted into the sky, followed by a shockwave that rocked the jeep. I felt the heat on the back of my neck, smelled the acrid smoke even through the closed windows. The facility was gone.

Along with everyone still inside it.

"N-6-P," the administrator said quietly, almost to himself. He wasn't looking at the flames anymore. His gaze had returned to the corn fields rushing past. "Do you know what that code means, Sofia?"

I shook my head, still staring at the orange glow in the rearview mirror.

"It's a 'Non-viable Patient Protocol.' We developed it during the rat trials, before we ever got to O'Bryon." He pulled out a pack of cigarettes from his jacket pocket, lighting one with shaking hands. "Some of the rats would receive the treatment and seem fine at first. Then they'd start producing that black substance, vomiting it up in their cages. We'd isolate them, thinking it was just a side effect, something they needed to expel."

He took a long drag, the ember glowing orange in the darkness of the jeep.

"But when that black goo touched the other rats, nothing happened. Rats will eat just about anything, so even when the clean rats licked up that black substance from the floor, they seemed fine. That's why I cleared Jessica, figured humans wouldn't be any different. Within hours, the rat that produced it would be dead. Massive organ failure. The body couldn't sustain whatever process was creating that stuff." He flicked ash out the window.

"But O'Bryon exploded," Aguero said from the back seat, speaking for the first time since we'd escaped. "That's not the same as the rats."

"No, it's not." The administrator's voice was grim. "It's worse. The converted have figured out how to weaponize it. Maybe it's some instinct. Or worse." He let the words hang in the air.

"Or intelligence," I mumbled. The administrator gave a solemn nod.

"That's why we need to get to Ricketts first," the administrator continued. "If the converted are smart enough to coordinate, to plan, to use themselves as weapons, well then we are in deep shit."

"They'll go after him," I finished. "They'll want to know how the treatment works. How to improve it. How to spread it faster."

"Or they'll want him to join them," Sebastian muttered.

The administrator nodded slowly. "Either way, Ricketts has information we can't let them access. The complete formula, the research notes, and the variations he tested. We can't let them get to him first."

We drove in silence for another five minutes.

"Why keep him separated anyway?" I asked, desperate to fill the silence with something other than my own spiraling thoughts. "If he created ANGEL, wouldn't you want him right there?"

The administrator took another drag of his cigarette. "Ricketts is brilliant. Maybe too brilliant for his own good. During the early trials, when he was on-site, we started noticing... irregularities."

"What kind of irregularities?" I asked.

"The kind where test results would be slightly better when he was the one administering treatment." The administrator's jaw tightened. "The board couldn't prove anything definitive, and his work was too valuable to scrap entirely, so they compromised. Keep him involved but at arm's length. Close enough to consult if needed, far enough that he can't tamper."

"So they didn't trust him," Aguero said.

"They trusted his genius," the administrator corrected. "They just didn't trust his objectivity."

The corn fields gave way to a small cluster of trees, and then we turned onto a narrow gravel drive. At the end sat a modest single-story house. It was nothing fancy, but not the shack I'd been imagining either. It looked almost normal, like something a schoolteacher might live in. A porch light illuminated the front door, and I could see a warm glow through the windows.

Sebastian killed the engine.

"Aguero," the administrator said. "You stay with the jeep. Anything goes wrong, you drive and you don't wait." The administrator dug into his jacket pocket and pulled out a white card, pressing it into Aguero's palm. "You drive to the coordinates and you tell them we have a possible Sector Leviathan scenario."

Aguero's trembling fingers clutched the card as he resigned himself to the driver's seat.

We stepped out into the night. The air here smelled cleaner, away from the facility's burning remains, but I couldn't shake the feeling that we were being watched. The trees around the property stood like silent sentinels, their branches swaying gently in the breeze.

The administrator approached the front door and knocked firmly. "Dr. Ricketts? It's Administrator Alan from Facility 50B-1. We have an emergency."

Footsteps from inside. A lock clicking. The door opened.

Dr. Ricketts stood in the doorway, and for a moment, I didn't recognize him. Gone was the theatrical figure from the demonstration, with his wide gestures and triumphant speeches. This man looked exhausted, his glasses sat crooked on his nose, his hair was disheveled, and he wore a rumpled cardigan over what looked like pajamas. But his eyes were alert, focused, taking in the three of us with growing concern.

"Administrator," he said, his voice hoarse. 

"Dr. Ricketts, we need to leave. [Now](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZJcortez/comments/1odnism/welcome/)."
