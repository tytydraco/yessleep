It was a very cold night. I was trying to sleep. I've been looking after my mom's house for her while she's away on a business trip. It's the same house on the outskirts of town she's lived in for years. The house itself isn't bad; it's the... neighbors.

I was in my bed, watching, you guessed it, more SpongeBob. You can't keep me away from that thing. I know it's childish, but that square sponge really hits it home. Anyways, I was so engrossed in SpongeBob that when I heard a "**Hello?**" in my mother's voice, it **spooked me like crazy**. Then I heard a **bark of laughter**.

"**What the fuck?**"

Mom. She's supposed to be gone for three more days. A cold, hard anger replaced the fear.

"**Whoever's!--**" I yelled, my voice cracking. I couldn't get the words out.

I grabbed my phone and flashed the light out the window, scanning the black trees. **Nothing**. Just an empty, silent yard. I stood there, confused and on edge, the beam of my flashlight cutting a useless hole in the darkness. I took a breath in. Then, as I walked back to my door, I caught a glimpse of something I cannot describe.

"**What, the...**"

For what felt like an hour, but was likely only a minute, I could hear soft **Scccrrrrittcchhhhh** noises outside my windows. Then I heard it again.

"**Daniel, sweety, could you cOme OuTsiDe?**"

My name is not **Daniel**, it's **Lloyd**. Whatever is out there be trying to make me come outside.

"**Who's there?**" I called out.

Admittedly, looking back, that was maybe a bad idea. My question obviously played into its game. In response, I heard a loud **CRASH!** from the back of the house. Scared out of my mind, I scrambled further under the bed. Luckily for me, that was the sound of the window cracking but not shattering. A cold, eerie voice that resembled my mother's spoke out again.

"**it's me, you're mother, i See want you out.**"

I decided to not respond, i was more confused on the monsters attempt at speaking After about twelve minutes, the sounds disappeared. I poked my head out, looked around, and took a sigh of relief. I went to my window... looking back, I never should've done it. I parted the drape and... there it was, a **gaunt figure** staring at me. I jumped back in terror, yelling, "**AHHHHHH WHAT THE FUCK!!**"

Whatever was out there knew I'd check eventually, and if that thing could smile, I think it would've. As next, I heard the most terrifying thing ever, a loud **SKEEIIIIIIIIII**.

The thing disappeared. Alone with my thoughts, I decided to not sit here like a sitting duck. I walked out of my room. Luckily, the house had drapes across the other windows already. I opened a drawer and pulled a gun out. The thing wasn't loaded, so I sat there for three minutes fumbling around with it, trying to load it. I was so focused on the metallic clicks and fumbling with the magazine that I didn't hear the shattering glass or the sounds of it breaking into my room. A "**Click!**" sound emanated as I finally loaded it.

Now, I like to think of myself as a brave person. I was telling myself, "You can do this, man, you got this!"

I stumbled back to my window in my room. But what I found was... **horrible**. Glass was shattered, the window was gone, my bed was roughed up. There were signs of an entry with **claw marks** across the bed. **Pieces of wood and blood were all over my bed.** It was horrible. I **almost threw up**. I slammed the door shut and walked into the kitchen. Whatever was looking for me gave up pretty quickly... or so I hoped... as I hear, "**Mommies... Loo0oking after---yo--u**." around my front door area. In a panic, I shot a round into the door, and I heard a deafening **RAAAUUGGGGHH**.

If anything, that pissed it off, as a slam at my front door was followed by another, then by the door slightly giving way. I threw the dresser down in front of the door and ran out the broken window to my stationed outside bike and **PEDDLED** like I'd never peddled before...

I never saw that monster again... As I'm here sipping my coffee and writing... I can't help but imagine what might've happened had I stayed under my bed... I won't tell anyone, as... who would believe me? ...alright guys... that's all, i-

**It's outside the coffee shop....**
