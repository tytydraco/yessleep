I had just graduated high school—18 years old, wide-eyed, and chasing the excitement of newfound freedom. Around that time, I started talking to a guy I knew through school. He was 19, and we’ll call him James. James lived in a house he rented with his brother and two other roommates. His brother and one of the roommates weren’t really part of the story, but the other one—Dwayne—definitely was. Dwayne was 21 and someone I didn’t pay much attention to at first.

At the beginning, I was mostly going over to James’s place to spend time with him, hoping something would blossom between us. For the first few weeks, it was all innocent—just group hangouts and casual flirting. But slowly, I started noticing Dwayne acting… differently. He’d offer to grab me my favorite late-night snacks or linger around after everyone else had gone to bed, just to talk. It was subtle, but persistent.

Then one night, I got a Snapchat from Dwayne. He said, “If James doesn’t make a move soon, I will.” I brushed it off at the time—thought it was pretty shady of him to say that about his friend. Like, doesn’t that break the bro code? But what I didn’t realize then was that this was just the tip of the iceberg.

A few weeks later, I was at a girlfriend’s house. We were drinking, acting reckless the way teenagers do, and eventually everyone else went to bed. I stayed up, half-drunk, scrolling through my phone when Dwayne messaged me again. I told him I was bored and stranded at my friend’s place, and he offered to come pick me up—at least a 45-minute drive. I said yes, thinking it’d be fun, and truthfully, I liked the attention. Plus, James would be at the house, right? Maybe something good would come of it.

Spoiler: it didn’t.

The car ride was full of jokes and flirtation. But when we arrived, James was already asleep. One thing led to another, and—well, you can probably fill in the blanks. That night changed everything. Afterward, I found myself thinking less about James and more about Dwayne. And before I knew it, I had started seeing Dwayne romantically.

It was awkward at first—James was still there, still part of the same house. But I was young and stupid and thought it was all part of some dramatic, messy love story. A couple weeks later, Dwayne took me out to a fancy restaurant. He pulled out all the stops: candlelit dinner, confident conversation, stories about his “great job” and his future plans. He made it sound like he had his life together—ambition, money, maturity. I was impressed. But it didn’t take long for the mask to slip.

In the beginning, the red flags were small. He’d try to break up with me over little things, then come back the next day acting like nothing had happened—apologizing, love bombing, promising he’d do better. But if you’ve ever been in an abusive relationship, you know how it escalates.

The arguments got nastier. The manipulation deeper. Eventually, he was spitting in my face, kicking in doors, slamming my belongings against the wall, lying constantly. He lost his job. He moved back in with his mom. Then came the money requests—over and over again. I was stuck in this cycle of chaos and hoping it would get better. But the worst hadn’t even happened yet.

One morning, after getting home from an overnight shift, I collapsed onto the couch in my parents’ living room, exhausted. Not long after, I heard a knock at the door. It was Dwayne. He looked pale—shaken, almost sick. He walked in and told me he’d just come from the police station. The officers had questioned him about a situation with a girl from town.

He said they asked if he had had sex with her. He claimed no, but then added that she had “just given him head.” (For the record, yes—that is sex, legally and otherwise.) The officer told him the girl had lied about her age. She said she was 16—but she was actually 15. Dwayne was 21.

I remember the pit in my stomach as I listened. His phone had been confiscated. He was clearly rattled. But what stood out even more was how he and his mother reacted when I brought it up later. They both insisted the girl was just a “h03” trying to ruin his life. His mom repeated it like gospel. That should’ve been my wake-up call. That’s when I should have left.

But I didn’t.

A few months went by. Things were relatively quiet, and part of me was still holding out hope that we could fix things. Then, out of nowhere, he went dark—stopped answering my texts. A few days later, he finally responded and explained he’d been in jail, bailed out by his dad, and now had a court date.

Even then, I stayed. I was clinging to this toxic hope that we were meant to be. Eventually, I couldn’t take it anymore. I broke things off for good.

A few days later, I went to his house to return some of his clothes. I pulled up and parked next to his truck. He was outside working on it, a large rolling toolbox nearby. I didn’t even get out of the car—I just rolled down my window and handed him the bag of clothes. He asked why we couldn’t try again, and I told him the truth: “You’re a bum. A loser. You’re abusive. You’re a felon.”

That set him off.

He grabbed the heavy toolbox and hurled it at my car. It left a dent—and my heart dropped. I couldn’t afford repairs. This was my car, the first big thing I had bought for myself. As I started to drive away, he pleaded with me, promising to fix it. I told him I was calling the cops.

That’s when things got scarier.

He reached through my open window and snatched my phone out of my hands—trying to stop me from calling 911. (In my state, that’s illegal.) I told him that. He made me promise I wouldn’t call, then finally gave the phone back.

I rolled up the window, locked the doors, and called the police anyway.

His mom came running outside, banging on my window, screaming, “Look what you’ve done to my poor son! Isn’t that what you wanted? To see him cry?”

No. What I wanted was to be safe. I wanted peace. I wanted accountability.

The dispatcher told me to stay in the car until officers arrived. Those 15 minutes felt like hours with Dwayne only a few yards away. When the police finally showed up, they asked if I wanted to press charges. I said no. I was scared—afraid of what would happen next, of my parents finding out, of legal fees I couldn’t afford.

They arrested him anyway. He had an active warrant.

That was the last time I saw him.

A few months later, I got a call from the jail. It was Dwayne. He told me he missed me. Said he’d been thinking about me. I told him, “That’s funny. I just got back from a date.” And I hung up. I never looked back.

A year later, I got a call from a police officer in some unfamiliar county. Apparently, because of the police report I filed, my name had been attached to Dwayne’s vehicle. They found his abandoned car and were trying to contact him. I told them the truth: I didn’t know where he was. I didn’t have his number. I didn’t want anything to do with him.

And I asked them—please—to disassociate my name from his plate.

Looking back, I wish I could go back and shake that 18-year-old girl by the shoulders. But I also know she was doing her best with the knowledge and confidence she had at the time. That experience taught me more than any classroom or textbook ever could. It taught me the warning signs, the power of boundaries, and that no matter how far someone has dragged you down, you can get back up and walk away—for good.

And you should.
