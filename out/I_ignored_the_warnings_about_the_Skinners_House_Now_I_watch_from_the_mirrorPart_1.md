They always said not to take the shortcut through Ash Hollow. Every town has a place like that—some road wrapped in legend, all rot and whispers and “don’t go there” warnings passed from kids to kids like an urban myth.

But the thing is, when you’re seventeen, drunk on shitty whiskey and your own imagined invincibility, those warnings sound more like dares.

So when Max suggested we cut through the Hollow after that night at the quarry, none of us hesitated. Not even Jess, who’d always been the one to remind us that “urban legends are just trauma wearing a Halloween mask.” We were too buzzed, too stupid, too loud with laughter that cracked like glass in the thick forest air.

Ash Hollow felt colder.

That’s the first thing I noticed. Like stepping into a place where the sun had died years ago. We kicked through dead leaves, flashlights bobbing and weaving ahead of us like lazy fireflies, until we hit the fence.

Or what was left of it.

It was old. More rot than wood. Covered in vines so thick they looked like veins. A single rusted sign still clung to one post by a nail, swinging limply in the wind:

“KEEP OUT – PRIVATE PROPERTY”

But someone had scratched something over it with what looked like a blade:

“SKIN WALKS HERE.”

Max laughed and kicked it. Jess rolled her eyes.

The Skinner.

That’s what they used to call him. Some guy who lived in the house at the end of the Hollow, back in the 1940s. Rumors said he was a tanner, or a surgeon, or something worse. Some said he went mad—started skinning animals… then people. Turned them into clothes. Curtains. Wallpaper.

Supposedly the town buried the stories after his house mysteriously burned. But the house didn’t stay gone.

It grew back.

They said he never left.

We stumbled through the underbrush and up the overgrown trail, pushing past thorns that scratched like claws. When we finally saw the house, every ounce of bravado drained out of me.

It looked wrong.

Not haunted in the usual sense—no lightning bolt silhouetting it dramatically in the distance, no ominous red glow.

It was quiet. Starved. Like it had been holding its breath for decades.

The house slouched in on itself, roof sagging, ivy clinging like a death grip. The front door dangled open like a broken jaw.

“Home sweet home,” Max muttered.

We stepped inside.

The smell hit like a slap. Metallic. Rotting. Wet and wrong. It stuck to the back of my throat and crawled up my nose. Max gagged. Jess made some half-assed joke about raccoons pissing everywhere, but her voice cracked halfway through it.

The floors creaked under our weight. Flashlights danced across moldy wallpaper and sagging beams. But then something caught my light—something under the peeling wallpaper. I stepped closer, brushing the edge away.

It wasn’t paint beneath.

It was… leather.

Not the kind you buy in stores. This was pale. Stitched. Inked with names. Dozens of names.

I kept peeling. Every wall was the same—stitched patches like a quilt made of people.

That’s when we heard the whisper.

It wasn’t a voice. Not really. More like… breath, dragged through broken teeth. A wet sound that made my spine curl in on itself.

“Cut it out, Max,” Jess hissed.

“I didn’t say anything.”

My flashlight flickered. So did theirs. The batteries were new.

Then I saw it. At the end of the hallway. A shape moving—no, crawling. But it wasn’t crawling on the floor.

It was on the ceiling.

Its limbs were too long, bending in ways they shouldn’t. Its head was upside-down, twisted like a broken doll. And its face—God, its face was a mask of skin, stitched at the edges, mouth sewn shut… but still smiling. The smile moved.

Max screamed first. Bolted.

A door slammed behind him, except it wasn’t a door anymore. Just wall. Flesh. Pulsing.

Jess and I tried to follow, but the hallway shifted. Literally. The walls moved, like the house was breathing. Sighing. Stretching. Rearranging us.

I grabbed Jess’s hand. “We need to leave. Now.”

She nodded.

Then she was gone.

One second there, the next—nothing.

I heard her scream. It didn’t end. It cut off, mid-breath, like someone had yanked her lungs out before she could finish the sound.

I turned in circles, disoriented. Every doorway led somewhere new. Every stairwell twisted. The house had no rules.

I stumbled into a room full of mannequins.

Except they weren’t mannequins.

They were people.

Naked. Hollow. Skinless. Eyes frozen open in horror. Mouths stretched in eternal screams. Hung from the ceiling like suits on display.

A human showroom.

In the center of the room stood a mirror.

I looked into it.

But it didn’t show me.

It showed him.

The Skinner.

He was massive—stitched from hundreds of faces, each one twitching, blinking, screaming in silence. His arms were bone wrapped in tendon, dripping with muscle like wet ribbons. His eyes—if you could call them that—shifted under layers of skin, roving independently, like they were trying to see everything at once.

He raised a scalpel the length of my forearm and pointed at the floor.

Kneel.

I couldn’t stop myself. My body folded like paper.

I tried to scream.

I couldn’t.

I watched as he stepped forward, towering, smiling with a mouth he didn’t have. I saw my reflection rise as I remained kneeling.

He stepped into me.

Into my skin.

My body stood up. He stood up.

I stayed behind.

Trapped.

In the mirror.

I screamed until my throat tore, but the mirror didn’t echo sound. It only showed.

He turned. My body turned. He flexed my fingers, like a kid trying on a Halloween costume.

Then he left.

And I stayed.

I don’t know how long it’s been. Time doesn’t move here. I can’t move either. Just… watch.

Sometimes, he brings more. Kids who think they’re invincible. Who don’t believe in monsters.

I watch them enter the house. I watch the house shift. I watch their eyes stretch in fear.

And I watch as he skins them.

One by one.

Their faces… they get added to the wall. Their names inked in neat cursive.

And the mirror gets another scream.

If you’re reading this—don’t go to Ash Hollow.

Don’t look in mirrors that don’t reflect you.

And if someone you know starts acting a little bit off after a trip in the woods?

Check their eyes.

He’s still out there.

Wearing us.

And he’s still stitching.
Still hungry.
Still watching.
