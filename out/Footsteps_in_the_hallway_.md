PART 1: 

I have always sucked at grammar so please don’t come at me. Thanks. 

I used to have a true crime podcast but I have since gave it up after being enthralled with this one…case…

It takes up all of my time, my energy, my thoughts, I just can’t get away from it. 

So, I have decided to go full blown vigilante investigator mode and investigate it myself. The way the cops should have. 

I guess this is sort of a written podcast/ journal/ way of not feeling alone…I don’t have anyone to share all of this with and thought maybe one of y’all might get something out of this and may be able to help me along the way!! 

Anyway, I’ll start off with some info about the case and why I’m so infatuated with it. 

Case Report: The Disappearance of the Hargrove Couple

Date: September 12, 2017
Location: Gypsy Pines Airbnb, Stowe, Vermont
Missing Persons: Jordan Hargrove (32), Emily Hargrove (30)

Background:

Jordan and Emily Hargrove, a married couple from Boston, Massachusetts, rented an Airbnb in Stowe, Vermont, for a weekend getaway. The property, known as Gypsy Pines, is a secluded, century-old Victorian house located deep in the woods, known for its rustic charm and peaceful surroundings.

Timeline of Events:

Day 1: September 8, 2017
The Hargroves arrived at Gypsy Pines at 4:00 PM. They settled in, took photos, and shared them with friends and family, excited about their stay. The first night passed without incident.

Day 2: September 9, 2017

8:15 PM: The Hargroves called 911, reporting strange, intermittent thumping sounds coming from the hallway upstairs. Emily described the noises as “heavy footsteps,” but Jordan dismissed them as possibly just the old house creaking. The dispatcher reassured them it was likely nothing serious.

Day 3: September 10, 2017

7:45 PM: Emily Hargrove called 911 again. This time, she reported hearing scratching noises on the walls. She was more anxious, saying the sounds were now constant and seemed to be moving around. The dispatcher suggested it could be animals, but Emily insisted it wasn’t. The couple was advised to contact local pest control, but no immediate action was taken by authorities.

Day 4: September 11, 2017

10:05 PM: Jordan Hargrove made another 911 call. His voice was shaky as he explained that they had heard whispering sounds, even though they were alone in the house. He mentioned seeing fleeting shadows in their peripheral vision and that the scratching noises had intensified, almost as if something was trying to get in. The dispatcher offered to send a patrol car, but the Hargroves declined, saying they’d wait it out.

Day 5: September 12, 2017

9:30 PM: The final 911 call came from both Jordan and Emily, who were frantic. They claimed that doors they had locked earlier were found wide open, and a figure was seen standing at the end of the upstairs hallway at the top of the stairs. The call ended abruptly, with the couple screaming. All attempts to call them back went unanswered.  

Discovery:

The local police were dispatched to the property at 10:15 PM, approximately 45 minutes after the last 911 call. Upon arrival, they found the house completely dark. The front door was ajar, and there were no signs of the couple inside.

The officers noted the following:

1. The house was in perfect condition.
2. The couple’s belongings, including their phones and wallets, were still in the house, but there was no sign of Jordan or Emily.
3. There were muddy footprints leading from the hallway to the backdoor, which was also found open, leading into the dense woods behind the property.

Investigation:

There pretty much wasn’t one. 

A search of the surrounding area was conducted by local law enforcement, but search and rescue teams were NOT dispatched and no effort to gather volunteers were made. I have called the department many times to ask why this was the case but no one wanted to comment. 

Hunting cameras in the surrounding areas were looked at but revealed nothing unusual, and there were no witnesses who reported seeing the couple leave the house. The only peculiar detail was that people reported hearing what they described as “odd, low-frequency sounds” coming from the direction of Gypsy Pines that night.

Weird right? I like to imagine the sound  was like the videos you put on when you get water in your phone…but I don’t know. 

Theories and Speculation:

Supernatural: Some local teens (and twitter detective’s) believe it was either aliens, big foot, or even a “witch from the woods” wooooooo~~~ 

Criminal Activity: Investigators have not ruled out foul play, but the lack of evidence or motive has stymied this line of inquiry.

Wildlife: Some speculate that wild animals could be responsible for the sounds and the couple’s disappearance, but if it were animals wouldnt  the scene have been more gruesome and messy? 

Status:

The case remains open, with no new leads. The Gypsy Pines property has NOT been removed from Airbnb listings, and the house is currently still up to book. The disappearance of Jordan and Emily Hargrove went in and out of the media very fast and it seems the whole town doesn’t think about it much if at all. 

Public Appeal:

Authorities don’t have much to say about the case these days but still have flyers up around the city urging people to speak up if they have any information.


That was the case file I made after the FIRST incident…but no more than year later another couple goes missing… 

And what do you know…they went missing from none other than Gypsy Pines.
