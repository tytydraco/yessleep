Let me just start this off by saying:
I know how it sounds.
I know what kind of person you think I am just reading that title — delusional, sleepless, maybe a touch of cabin fever.
But I'm begging you — if you read something today, let it be this. Let me be your cautionary tale. Because the trees here… they're not alive. They're something worse than alive.

The job was a fantasy when I first got the offer. Remote forest outpost. Simple pay. I just had to monitor some old equipment and make sure that no one wandered onto government property after dark.

"Nothing ever happens," said the old guard, pushing a rusty walkie-talkie into my hand with a smile that fell short of his eyes.

"Just you, the stars, and the silence."

I lasted for four nights before the trees screamed.

The observatory is camouflaged about 30 miles back in the Cascades, nothing but pine, fog, and the sound of your own heart beating in your head. No cellular connection. No Wi-Fi. One access road in and out, and it's closed after you. They don't want people stumbling into this facility by mistake — or stumbling out without permission.

There's a central dome structure for the server room and telescope, and then my little shack down about 100 yards. It's barely bigger than a cot and a desk will squeeze in, but I was fine with that. I was looking for solitude. I was looking to get away.

I just didn't know I was getting away to.

The first nights were still — ominously so. No howl of a coyote. No rustling of the wind. Even the trees remained too still, as though they were not to be noticed.

Then came the fourth night.

2:46 a.m.
I remember the hour clearly because all the clocks in the shack were stuck.

No warning. I'm listening to a podcast on some battered-up old iPod, and then the sound distorts into this twisted static, like a voice trying to scream through a mouthful of water. Then — silence.

That was when I heard it.
The tree line groaned.

Not the wind. Not animals. This was low. Vibrational. The forest sounded as though it were in pain.
Then… they started screaming.

Not all in a rush. One by one, slow and low, like being gutted in slow motion. Then another joined in. And another. Dozens. Hundreds. It built up like a chorus of the damned, ringing off the trees, crawling down the radio and the walls and my fucking teeth.

I ran to the window. My flashlight only illuminated the tree line — but it caught the movement.
The trees were shaking.
Not swaying — trembling, as though something inside them was trying to get out. Their bark stretched taut, like skin. Branches cracked at odd angles, some curving inward. Like ribs.

Then the eyes.
Small, moist pinpoints, opening on the trunks like pores.
One tree. Then two. Then the entire forest was looking at me.

I drew back, telling myself I was dreaming. That it was a hallucination. But as soon as I reached the door of the shack, the screaming stopped. Dead. Cut off as if someone hit mute.

And then the whisper.

Directly behind me, in a non-human voice:

"Where do you think you're going, little bones?"

I spun around.
Nothing.
Only my flashlight, which I'd dropped on the ground. Flickering.

I didn't sleep. I hid beneath the desk until morning, gripping the old revolver they keep in the emergency locker. At dawn, I phoned central — static. Nobody answered. The satphone in the dome? Incinerated.
The GPS? Disturbs. It says I'm over the Pacific Ocean.

I tried to leave. I swear to god I tried. I strolled to the gate and found the access road. gone.
As if the forest had closed in behind me. The gravel road just ends, invaded by thick, newly grown trees where there shouldn't be any.

And they're closer now.
The forest is encroaching.

I have no idea what the observatory was tracking when it went dark.
I don't know whether it saw something out there… or something saw it.
All I know is that I am no longer alone. And the trees?
They do not like to be seen.

They're quiet now, during the day.
But at night —
God have mercy.
They sing.

And I believe they're learning phrases.

If you read this and you know someone who does government surveillance in the Cascades — get them out.
If you've ever hiked there and seen a tree with a scar in the form of a mouth — run.
And if you ever hear the forest whispering your name?

Do not answer.
