So this is 100% a true story, exactly the way I remember it. This night was so traumatizing to me as a child that I remember it vividly, but thinking on it as an adult made me realize that it may have been more terrifying than I ever realized! 

This took place one night when I was really young. 3 maybe 4. I know i had to be super little because me and my 2 sisters were all still sharing a bed. Something had stirred me awake that night, my sisters were both still asleep. The room was dark except the light from the bathroom shining through the bedroom door that was cracked open and left slightly ajar. (this is what we used to use as a "nightlight")

As i lay there in bed awake I see something in the corner (the same corner as the bedroom door, almost behind the door) that's kind of scary looking. Im not exactly sure what it is because it's dark, and it's in the corner so all I really see is a silhouette.

Now even as a small kid, I was a rational person, I remember having the thought, "it can't really be the scary thing I'm imagining, it's probably just some coats hanging in the corner or something" so I look at it closer, I stare at it for a good 2 or 3 minutes really trying to figure out what it is when suddenly it moves, not a little, or slightly but full sprint. Not straight at me thank God. It came around the bed to the opposite side of the room, blocking out the light from the bathroom as it passed the door, confirming something was really there. 

Since it came around the bed, leaving a straight shot to the bedroom door, I didn't hesitate! I probably never moved as fast. I screamed down the hallway, to the left the dark kitchen,to the right the living room, the only room little up except the bathroom. I ran into the living room still screaming bloody murder, there was a little plastic jurassic park tent set up in the floor, I had gotten it for my birthday or Christmas.

I hid in the tent shouting at the top of my lungs. It was the most obvious place I could be. As thin as I kite so it offered no protection. And if it wasn't obvious where I was I was just screaming out of pure terror. I definitely lacked survival instinct!! My parents never came to check on me, (they might have yelled out and asked what's wrong, but never came out of their room) and I rocked myself to sleep screaming and traumatized In that tent that night. 

This has always been a scary event to me, that I couldn't explain and always said this was the one paranormal thing/event that keeps open minded. But looking back as an adult, with logic and reasoning, I thought we'll if it wasn't a ghost or something supernatural, what could it have been???

I froze in a new level of fear as the thought entered my head.. it blocked out the light, something was there..if it wasn't a ghost, it had to be a person!! It ran around the bed, not at me but possibly towards a window. My parents didn't react so even with me sounding the alarm somebody could have easily slipped out. 

The thought to me is even more terrifying than if it was a ghost. Along with the chilling thought of what could have happened if I hadn't woken up! What did I see? What did I stop? What was it that really went bump that night? 


This is again 100% true and has been something I have pondered on lot. It's an event that haunts my thoughts, so I thought I'd share it so that it my haunted yours as well! So what do you think it was? Was it a ghost? A person? Or do you think I'm making it all up?
