I hope my story makes it out to the internet or the news, or to wherever most people will see it. My story must be heard not only for my sake but for yours as well. I’m cold, tired, and bleeding out. If this is the last testimony of my life, the things that I saw and heard here can’t remain hidden from the outside any longer.

I always remember being drawn to nature, even as a little kid. The small backyard of my suburban home felt like a thousand acres of untamed land — a secret world that only I knew existed. For a time, I was happy with this small taste of nature, but I knew I wanted more. This feeling only grew as I got older.

When I was about eight, I remember sitting at home, walking around the house pretending to be trekking through the forests in Oregon, breathing in the fresh air of a world that hadn’t been violated by skyscrapers or traffic backed up for hours — buses and cars idling mindlessly, waiting to escape the gridlock.

This world I had built in my mind — of birds singing high up in the Douglas firs, or hearing an elk bugle in the middle of its rut, ready to fight any bull willing to clash, like I had seen on TV and in old *National Geographic* magazines — was only a fever dream of mine. Being able to escape the twenty-by-twenty-foot backyard I had grown so accustomed to.

However, this would change when I turned twelve. I had known my grandpa lived in Montana, but I always wondered why we never went to visit him. I always thought it had something to do with living in California — the distance being just too much to deal with.

My dad and my grandfather had a falling out right before he left Montana to go be with my mom in California. They had met on the side of the road where my mom’s car had broken down. My dad was driving back from town when he spotted her. He told me, “There she was, sitting on the side of the road waving her arms like they were on fire.” He always joked that even without her glasses on and at a mile away, she could see how handsome he was in that blue ’68 F-250.

The only thing louder than her sigh was a tornado siren.

I never really knew what my dad and grandpa had fought about back then, but I know that when my mom got pregnant with me, the dynamic between them changed. It brought them closer together — well, as close as they could be.

This small change made it possible for me, with more pleading and begging than you could ever imagine, to spend time with my grandpa.

My grandpa was the type of person who knew everything about the trees, the soil, the animals — basically anything natural. He had always been that way at least that's what I was told. He grew up in Alaska, hunting and fishing and selling his day’s work in town. He would eventually start his own guided hunting business, which turned out to be very enticing for those who wanted to get outside of their cubicle and 9-to-5 job to get a taste of how man was supposed to live.

He had saved up enough money to eventually buy land where his nearest neighbor was an hour away in any direction.

The day before I was supposed to fly out, my dad sat me down and told me, “Tommy, I want you to have fun and enjoy being with your grandpa, but promise me you won’t take any of his stories seriously.”

“Why?” I asked, with a puzzling look etched onto my face.

“Your grandpa spent a lot of time out in the woods and with these people who lived like him. The stories they would all sit down and share around the campfire or in small bars were nothing but old drunken men telling tall tales.”

I nodded, looking at my dad — not fully understanding what he meant back then, but I know now.

The next day I was on a flight to Montana to spend four days hunting, fishing, hiking, and mostly spending time with a part of my family that I never really knew.

I landed at about 2:00 p.m. that day, impatiently waiting at the baggage claim for my duffel bag full of everything I’d need for this excursion. I grabbed my bags and slowly found my way outside, and standing there waiting for me was Grandpa.

I had seen a couple of pictures of him in old photo albums, but never in person. He was a mountain of a man — standing head and shoulders above anyone around us. He had a thick gray beard and long silver hair. He wore an old cowboy hat, jeans, boots, and a flannel Carhartt jacket that you could’ve used as a blanket, it was so large.

I was always told I was rather big for my age, but when he hugged me and picked me up, I never felt smaller.

“Tommy, it’s so nice to finally get to meet you,” he said, bellowing with the deepest voice I had ever heard.

He grabbed both of my duffel bags — which I had struggled to carry with one hand — and hoisted them into the bed of his pickup. We didn’t waste any time hopping inside the truck and making our way back to his house.

We left the city, and as soon as we did, there was nothing but wide open plains with bison grazing or sprawling forests that could’ve hidden all the secrets in the world. Looking back on it now, it wasn’t big enough to hide one of them.

He must have seen me staring out the window in awe. “Gorgeous, ain’t it?” he asked.

I looked at him and said, “Dad used to tell me stories about this — how he and his buddies would ride four-wheelers and hunt rabbits in these fields. About how these golden landscapes would seem to stretch past the horizon.”

Grandpa chuckled. “Your dad and his friends were hell on wheels back then. Drinking, fighting, and who knows what else those boys would do after school.”

I never would’ve assumed that of the man who drove a Honda CR-V and worked for the leading software company in all of California — the man I had never seen get mad or so much as raise his voice.

We drove for another hour before we made it to his land. He had a large metal gate at the bottom of his property with a big *‘Trespassers will be shot’* sign chained to the metalwork. He held the gate open as I slid into the driver’s seat and slowly drove the truck just past the gate, where he put the padlocked chain back on and took over the wheel again.

His driveway stretched for what seemed like miles, surrounded by cedar and pines that touched the sky. The dirt driveway gave way beneath the tires, flinging earth behind us — as if the road itself wanted to escape.

It had rained a couple of hours before we arrived, so there was still water on the trees, making the bark look almost black — as if they had absorbed all the sin in the world.

Before we started driving again, Grandpa looked at me and said, “Once we get past that gate, this is my world, and the only laws that govern it are the ones you and I make for it.”

The sun was past noon and the light gave the trees a golden aura. It was one of the most beautiful things I had ever seen.

When we got to the cabin, I really got to see what his life was like. There was a tall oak cabin that he had built when he first bought the property. It stood fifty yards from a river with a current strong enough to carry you downstream but not strong enough that you couldn’t paddle against it to get back.

A small garage where he kept his kayaks, four-wheelers, tractor, and anything else he felt belonged in there. Most of it seemed random, but I assumed that when you lived so far away from anyone or anything, it was better to have things and not need them than to need them and not have them.

We got out of the truck, and I grabbed my bags from the bed. We walked onto the large porch. The porch sagged a little in the middle and showed the scars of decades of weather. Two rocking chairs sat there — his and my grandma’s — but hers hadn’t been sat in for ten years now.

Above the door hung the twelve-point antlers of a whitetail deer. He caught me staring at them in adoration.

“I remember when I shot that deer,” he said, putting a hand on my shoulder. “I had just finished building the cabin, and I was on the roof putting extra chink down when I saw him drinking from the river about a hundred yards away. I snuck down, grabbed my 30-30 with the scope, got back up on the roof, put the crosshairs just behind his shoulder, cocked the hammer back slowly, squeezed the trigger on the exhale — and boom! He dropped where he stood. Fed me and your grandma for two weeks.”

When we got inside, the house smelled like oak, campfire, and gun oil. There was a large table big enough to seat seven, maybe eight people. A small sink sat below a window that looked out toward the driveway and the woodline. I looked out into the woods, feeling like the forest was staring back at me.

He showed me to my room. It was small, but it didn’t matter. Paintings of wildlife scattered the walls, with a nightstand and a closet completing the space. I almost wondered if he had made them himself, but I couldn’t imagine him sitting in front of an easel with a palette in one hand and a brush in the other.

“This is where you’ll be staying while you’re here — and if you like it enough, maybe when you come back too,” he said with a small smile.

I beamed up at him, knowing I wanted nothing more than to spend every minute here.

I set the bags down on the floor and walked out to the kitchen with him. He pulled two backstraps from the fridge.

“Have you ever eaten mulies before?”

“No,” I said.

“Well, that changes tonight.”

Forty-five minutes later, we were sitting on his porch with backstrap, potatoes, and corn for dinner. I had grown up eating in some of the nicer restaurants in California, but nothing came close to how good this was.

We were about done with our meal when he pointed out to the mountain in front of his house and said, “You see that ridge right there?”

“Yeah,” I answered.

“Right past there is a bed for this elk herd that lives here. When your dad was about your age, he hiked up to that ridge, slipped down into where those elk beds were, and tried to sneak up on them with a slingshot he’d gotten for his birthday.”

He grinned, remembering when he and my father were still close.

“Did he ever manage to hit one?” I asked.

“Naw, but I tell you what — he sure did piss his boots when the largest bull of that herd stood up and bugled something fierce.”

We both laughed thinking about my dad running back home, trying not to get caught.

He laughed again, then grew quiet as he looked back at the ridge. “I ain’t seen that herd in a couple seasons now.”

We walked back inside and sat down at the large wooden table. He put his hat on the table and walked over to the cupboard, grabbing a glass, a bottle of 80 proof, and a soda for me. He sat and poured the bourbon in the glass and looked at me.

“I always hoped that one day you’d be here,” he said, smiling.

“Me too,” I said.

He finished his glass, then poured another. “Have you ever heard any of the legends about this place, Tommy?” he asked, leaning back in his chair.

I shook my head.

“Back when I bought this land, I’d gone down into town to buy some supplies — building materials, food, a generator, guns, bullets, bourbon, etc. When I was buying lumber, the man who owned the place, old man Jim, was checking me out when he asked me, ‘You’re not from around here, are you, son?”

“‘No sir. I just moved here from Alaska. I just bought a plot of land about an hour out of town, and I’m gonna put a cabin out there,” I told him.

“The old man asked me where I’d bought it.

“The piece of land right off Country Road 47,” I said.

“The smile on his face faded as soon as he heard that. ‘What’s wrong?’ I asked him. Jim looked at me and shook his head. Told me, ‘Don’t build too deep in the timbers out there.’

“I asked, ‘Why?’

“He told me there’s something that lives out in the pines where the fog gets real thick and the trees grow so close together they make a wall. Those things — once they see you, they’ll follow you all around. They hunt you from the heat of your breath, and they can smell you from a state away, Tommy. People around here say it’s hunters who went out, got lost, and couldn’t find their way home. They still lurk out there, deep in the woods. They move so fast people call them *Wind Walkers.*”

I sat back in my chair thinking about what he had just said. He picked up his glass and waved it in the air, seeing the visible fright on my face.

“Ah, you ain’t oughta put too much thought into it, Tommy boy. My guess is it’s just a story to spook the kids from running too far off into the woods.”

I felt how hard I had been gripping the chair when I picked my head up to ask him, “Have you ever seen one before, Grandpa?”

The old man looked out the window next to the sink and said, “Naw, Tommy, I ain’t — and I aim to keep it that way for both of us.”

He stood up from the table and yawned. “Well, Tommy, I think it’s about time we get to bed. We got a long day tomorrow, and we’re having trout for dinner — and I ain’t got any in the freezer,” he said with a wink and a smile.

I sat at the table as he walked down the long hallway to his room and listened to the wind whistle through the trees.

That next morning, I woke up to the smell of coffee and the crisp air you can only find through the mountains lofting in through the slight crack of the window in my room. Outside, I heard Grandpa making his axe sing with every swipe he took — *thunk*, then a brief pause, and then another *thunk*. I grabbed my boots and wandered outside, where he had made a sizable pile of split logs to feed the furnace in the living room.

“I would have guessed you’d cut down half the trees on this mountain by the size of that pile. You been out here long?” I asked him.

“Long enough for that coffee to burn if it ain’t get poured, Tommy boy,” he said with a playful smile.

I went inside and fetched him a mug full. When I came back out and handed it to him, he put the axe down and took a long swig.

“Good man,” he said.

We spent most of the day working the land — picking apples, mending fences, and stacking the pile of logs Grandpa had split earlier that day. We chatted while we worked, never about anything serious, more so about life lessons.

We were cleaning a bramble of thorns from one of the fences when Grandpa stood up and said, “Tommy, what do you see in front of you?”

I looked at him, confused. “A fence with some thorns on it.”

I felt so dumb for stating the obvious. Grandpa looked at me with a smirk. “Well yes, but it’s more than that. Think about the fence as your mind, your body, or your soul. The thorns represent all the badness in the world. You want to pull the thorns off the fence before they become too ensnared, before you can’t get them off.”

I looked at him, thinking how such a simple analogy could carry a weight that heavy.

We worked for what felt like years, and that summer heat might have been hotter than the sun. It was about five in the afternoon when Grandpa pulled the blue hanky out of his back pocket and wiped his face, pulling his attention from the new garden bed we had been working on.

“Well, Tommy boy, I figure we ought to go catch our dinner. How does that sound?”

I don’t think I could have nodded my head any harder.

We went into the house, and I waited for Grandpa to come back out with our fishing supplies. When he came out, he had two fishing poles and a tackle box. He set them down, then walked back to his room. I sat there wondering what else we would need to go fishing. When Grandpa walked back out, he had with him a scoped Marlin 336 in .30-30, a Remington 870 in 12 gauge, and a Ruger Super Redhawk in .454.

I asked him what the guns were for if we were just going fishing. He looked at me and said, “Oh, you know — the local wildlife.”

I figured he meant a bear or a wolf. 

I carried all the fishing gear while Grandpa carried the guns. We walked about a mile or two down the river to a spot where Grandpa said the trout were always hiding. We tied on some flies and spent an hour fishing. He taught me how to let the fly mimic the way a bug would float on the water’s surface. He told me to be patient and let the fish take some line out before setting the hook.

Being this far into nature was something I had dreamed of for so long. Getting to spend time with someone who enjoyed it just as much — if not more — made it that much better.

I sat on the bank of the river watching Grandpa cast his line out and saw the small bugs land on the water, only to be eaten by predators lurking just beneath the surface. A looming danger that was so close yet unknown to them until it was too late — if they even knew what happened before they were swallowed whole.

This time with Grandpa was the most fun I had ever had.

I picked my rod back up and walked about ten feet from where Grandpa was standing. I put my pole on the ground to clip the line and tie on a new fly. When I picked my head back up, that’s when I saw it. I didn’t know what it was, but I knew it was something that hadn’t been there before — or at least I didn’t think it was.

At the top of the ridge where my dad had snuck up on elk with his slingshot was a person. But something seemed off, because where this person was walking, there wasn’t a steady path. The ridge was mostly loose boulders that were too risky to walk across, so my Grandpa and Dad had cleared out a trail just above — that’s how my dad used to go up there to watch the elk in their bed.

I turned my head and called out to Grandpa. “I think someone’s on the ridge,” I said, pointing just as the sun was slowly starting to hide behind its crest.

He followed my finger to the general area and pulled out this beaten-up pair of binoculars he had stuffed in his vest, hoping to see some bighorn sheep trying to get across the rocky terrain. He put the binoculars to his eyes and held them there for what seemed longer than necessary to determine who — or what — someone was doing up there.

It seemed weird to me that anyone would be on his property, but it wasn’t unheard of for people to hike on public land and accidentally wander onto private property. It didn’t raise much alarm at first, but seeing him stare at that ridgeline for so long made my chest feel tight.

“Is everything okay?” I asked nervously.

He didn’t answer right away. He put the binoculars down after a while and finally said, “It’s nothing, Tommy. Between the last bit of sun, the heat, the distance, and the water reflecting the light, just an optical illusion, buddy — nothing more.”

I didn’t fully believe him, but I had no reason not to. My dad’s words rang back in my mind.

Still, I stared.

“Tommy,” Grandpa yelled, “you ain’t ever gonna catch any fish staring at the sky, bud.”

He smiled at me, but the smile seemed almost insincere. I brushed it off, though. He picked his fishing rod back up and started casting again, but this time I noticed his hands shaking ever so slightly.

We had packed up our bucket of trout and started walking back when Grandpa, almost like he was thinking out loud, said, “Remember that story I was telling you about last night?”

“Yeah, those hunters who got lost and never came back.”

He nodded. “The locals used to say they could walk on the wind itself, gliding right over the earth. People would say they’d see them in places they had no way of being — the sides of cliffs, the middle of rivers where it was too deep to wade. Some of them said they weren’t really there, but instead it was an echo of something that had come and gone long ago. Something that should have left already, but maybe couldn’t — or didn’t want to.”

I glanced over my shoulder at the ridge just before we got back to the cabin. Where I had seen “something” was empty now, just another unoccupied spot on the side of a large mountain.

“Do you think that’s what I saw on the ridge?” I asked him, almost blurting it out.

Grandpa chuckled — or something that *constituted* as such. It almost came out like a cough, like he had swallowed something that got caught in his throat.

“Naw, buddy. I told you those were just some old ghost stories, that’s all. Every place has them. The old Indians that used to live here had stories about people who got caught in the woods during the winter and would eat the people with them in order to stay alive. These people would turn into large beasts and stalk the woods, looking for their next meal — howling or screaming in pain because they were cursed with an appetite they could never fill.”

I looked at him with a twinge of fright, but also a little relief that these ghost stories were just original to us.

“Don’t let that stuff cloud your head too much, bud. Remember what I said about keeping the thorns off your fence.”

I nodded my head in understanding.

By the time dinner was ready, the stars were starting to take over the sky. This was the first time I had ever seen a sky not interrupted by something man-made. It was like heaven itself had opened up and let the angels dance across it.

We ate on the porch again, with the firelight from the campfire just off the porch throwing long shapes into the yard. The wind had picked up, and I could hear it running through the trees.

“What?” I said, not fully hearing what Grandpa had asked me.

He turned his head. “I didn’t say anything, bud.”

I figured it was just my mind playing tricks on me. Grandpa stood up and asked me what I wanted to do tomorrow, knowing that after that, I’d have to go back home.

“I want to learn to shoot,” I said.

He rubbed my head as he walked in and told me that wouldn’t be a problem at all.

I walked into the cabin, shutting the door behind me and locking it. When I looked up, I could see a faint glow off in the distance — right on top of the ridge.

I walked off to my room and laid in bed, listening to the wind blow a branch against the window, faintly tapping on it. Then I heard heavy footsteps walking across the wooden floor, accompanied by a chair being dragged and then sat in — the final noise being the cocking of a pistol.

The next morning arrived with the singing of birds and the blue sky serving as its background. I looked out the window at the mountains, watching the clouds slowly climb their way up and eventually past the peaks. When I walked into the kitchen, the smell of metal, gun oil, and coffee hung strong in the air of the cabin.

“Look what the sunrise dragged in,” he said, not looking up. I sat down next to him. On the table were only a few of the guns Grandpa owned. He was polishing his rifle. The metal shined bright with the reflection of the sun off its barrel. It was his Marlin. It was the first gun he had ever bought, he told me. He had paid $100 and 40 lbs of deer pelts to the town gunsmith back in Alaska when he was fourteen. The wood was dark and smooth from the decades of use it had been through. I could only imagine how many bullets had been put through it and the stories that were sunk deep into its grain.

“You ever shot a gun before?” he asked me.

“Just a BB gun. My dad used to set up old tin cans, and I'd shoot them in the backyard.” I paused, thinking to myself, not wanting to share why I wasn’t allowed to shoot anymore.

He looked at me with a smile and said, “Well that’s a start, ain't it.” He finished cleaning his rifle and put it on a large towel sitting on the couch next to the table. He picked up a slightly smaller rifle from the table and looked it over.

“Do you know what this is, Tommy?” he asked me.

“It’s a deer rifle,” I replied.

“Not bad, Tommy boy,” he said. “This was your dad’s first gun. I bought it for him when he turned thirteen.” He handed me the rifle, and I looked it over. The wood was matte, and the barrel had slight signs of rust on it. **REMINGTON ARMS MANUFACTURING CO.** was emboldened on the side of the barrel, with the numbers .270 following it. In the stock of the gun were little tally marks that had been carved into it long ago. I asked Grandpa what they meant.

“That’s how many deer and elk he killed with that.” There must have been fifty marks carved into the stock. Grandpa handed me a rag and the gun oil and asked if I knew how to handle and clean a gun. I shook my head. He told me to make sure the safety was on, the magazine was empty, and that the chamber was too. Before long, I had taken the bolt out of the gun and was pulling the bore snake through,Pulling out years’ worth of hunting seasons’ carbon buildup

We had the guns clean and were out the door with a box of shells for each of us, a stack of papers that had hand-drawn bullseyes, tin cans, and a dented metal plate that looked like it had taken shots all the way back at Lexington and Concord. The walk to the barn made the world feel alive. The trees swayed with a gentle breeze, birds fluttered above our heads, and insects raced around us. Grandpa had unslung both guns from his shoulders and laid them up against a fallen tree opposite the clearing we were shooting into. I set up the targets and walked back to where Grandpa was standing. He wanted to teach me basic safety before we began.

He said, “Rule number one: treat every gun like it's loaded. Rule number two: keep your finger off the trigger until you're ready to shoot. Rule number three: be sure of what your target is and what's behind it. The fourth and most important rule,” he told me, “never point a gun at something you're not willing to destroy, Tommy. No matter what it is, if you point your muzzle at it, you need to be sure you're willing to destroy whatever stands on the other end of your weapon.”

Hearing him say this made me feel uneasy, but I knew he did this to make sure we were safe. I think about it now, and I’m confident he was preparing me for what really goes on here—the things that live in these pines. After his lesson, he grabbed my dad’s rifle and loaded one bullet into the gun before handing it to me. He stood behind me, showing me how to hold the rifle.

“Tuck it tight into your shoulder. Don’t fight it, just breathe and squeeze. Let the shot surprise you.”

The first shot of the gun ripped through the quiet of the morning and echoed back through the valley. The tin can flew from the post, rolling in the grass once the bullet collided with it. The recoil dug deep into my shoulder, rocking me back a little. The smell of gun smoke filled the air around me. It would become a smell I would be familiar with for the rest of my life.

“Good shot,” Grandpa said as he readjusted my stance. “Most kids jerk the trigger or get scoped the first time they shoot, so you're already leagues above most.”

“I guess I got it from you,” I said, looking back at the old man. He took the gun from my hand and pulled the bolt back, ejecting the shell and sending it flying in the air. When it finally landed, he picked it up and gave it to me as a souvenir of the occasion. He pulled out the magazine and handed it to me, telling me to load it and load another shell into the chamber.

We did this for the next hour or two, taking turns shooting at the targets. Every time we fired, birds would fly from the trees in masses, chirping or squawking at us for interrupting their peace with gunfire. We took a break, sitting on a log and eating ham and cheese sandwiches that had been warmed by the sun, making the cheese stick to the plastic bag as we pulled them out. He pulled out his canteen of water and passed it to me.

“You know, back when your dad was a little longer than you, that rifle used to buck him something nasty, but after a year or two he got real good at shooting. Used to stalk Bighorn sheep and shoot them from 300 yards away. Never got as good as me though,” he said with a smile and wink. I laughed as Grandpa walked to put up another target.

Something out of the corner of my eye grabbed my attention—a white flash in the trees. It was close enough that I should have been able to hear it from where I was sitting. The sight jolted me out of this moment with Grandpa, a moment that would now be forever blemished.

“Grandpa, I think there’s something close to us, right over there in the trees.” I tried to hide the fear in my voice, but I don’t think I did much of a convincing job.

He walked back over to where we were sitting and grabbed his rifle. He scanned the woodline, looking for anything that seemed out of the ordinary. After a while, he looked down at me and said, “Probably a deer or a coyote, Tommy. They usually wander down from the mountain when they hear shooting. Nothing to get knotted up about.” He said it with that same reassuring smile, but his eyes didn’t match what his face was trying to say.

“Grandpa, I don't think it was,” I said.

He looked back at me. “You just a bit tuned up from the shooting, boy,” he said calmly, walking back to the tree where all our stuff was laid out. As he walked, I saw him pull a shell out of his pocket and slide it into the loading gate.

The rest of the day passed quietly. We gathered kindling and talked the afternoon away, walking through the property, even still feeling that a tension was present just out of sight. Evening came with a golden hue and soft light. The mountains obstructed the pink sky behind them. We fed the fire the kindling we had gathered earlier that day. Grandpa laid two large pieces of trout on top of the grate over the fire while I sat near him, playing with the shell from earlier.

After we ate, we sat on the steps of the porch, taking in the sky on the last night of my stay. As we watched the fireflies make the fields glow, Grandpa broke the silence.

“You did good today, Tommy. Most boys your age would’ve bitched about the work or been glued to their phone, but not you. You're the last of a dying breed. You belong out here, grandson.”

“Thanks,” I said. “I just wish I could stay here with you longer.” I told him, carrying what felt like all the sadness ever known to man in those words.

“You’ll come back, boy, and I’ll be waiting when you do, and so will the woods.” I looked at him and nodded, sitting on the old man’s words. For a while, we stayed there, listening to the river rolling just a short way from the cabin, the quiet whisper of the pines rolling through the acres.

Somewhere deep into the sea of trees, there was a sound so unnatural it didn’t belong here—not only on this land, but in this plain of being. It wasn’t what you’d consider a voice, but not just the wind passing through. It was like the forest itself took a long exhale through gritted teeth. I turned, hoping to spot the origin of the sound, but I never did. Grandpa sat unfazed by what I thought I had heard. He stared straight ahead, watching the fire dance in the small pit bordered with old red bricks that were new before my dad was born.

He took a breath and softly said, “Don’t listen too closely, Tommy, especially at night. The woods will talk to you till you turn grey.”

I thought he just meant they’d talk to you until you got old, but now, sitting here with this gash, I know what he was trying to tell me.

When we walked in and went to bed, I lay awake staring at the ceiling, thinking about those old legends Grandpa was talking about before slipping off into the warm goodnight. That night, I dreamed of cedars and oaks stretching for miles in the sky and swaying until they seemed like they would snap. I blinked, and there I was, standing in the front lawn of the cabin, staring at the ridge. Even from a distance, I could see multiple figures standing on the ridge, watching me.

I woke the next morning, the sun sending slivers of light through the curtains. I sat up in bed and looked out the corner of the window where the woodline was. Something about the woods this early made me feel tense. I walked into the kitchen, where Grandpa stood by the stove, cooking bacon and eggs in a cast iron pan. The woodstove popped and creaked softly, almost trying not to disturb the peace of the morning.

“Morning, buddy,” he said, not turning away from what he was doing. “Last breakfast before you gotta head back home.”

I sat at the table, rubbing the last little bit of sleep from my eyes. “I wish I didn't have to, Grandpa. This place is heaven on earth.”

Grandpa looked at me, smiling. “I know, buddy, but your dad would be pissed if I kept you here any longer.” He gave me a plate stacked with food that smelled like a professional chef had made it in one of those fancy kitchens in Paris.

“Eat all you want, we got a long drive ahead.”

We ate in silence. Only the clink of silverware, the crackle of the fire, and Grandpa sipping his coffee broke the silence. It felt like it echoed off the cabin walls. We went about the normal chores for the day, which, I happily admit, took longer than usual. The day felt still, absent of the singing of birds that became an orchestra most mornings. Grandpa never said anything, but every now and then I would catch him glancing toward the woodline or the ridge.

By the time the sun was directly overhead, my bags were packed in the bed of his truck. I was walking to the truck, where Grandpa was standing, smoking a cigar. He looked up and asked, “You ready?”

“No, but I don't think I get much say in this.”

Grandpa put his cigar out against the bottom of his boot as he chuckled. “Unfortunately, no.”

He started walking to the cabin and told me to follow him inside and wait at the table. I did as I was told and sat down, waiting for him to come back. When he returned, he had a black bolt-action rifle in his hand. He gave it to me before sitting down. I studied the rifle, looking over all of its details. The rifle wasn’t new, but I could tell it hadn't been used much, if at all. There was a picture of an Indian with a large headdress on the bottom where the grip met the stock. The barrel read **“Savage Arms Axis .30-06 Springfield.”** The sling was made out of brown leather and had a painted picture of a deer staring at a mountain.

“That thing will bring down anything you put your crosshairs on,” Grandpa said.

I couldn't contain how happy and grateful I was. I stood up and wrapped my arms around the old man, and he did the same.

“I’ll keep it safe until you get back, but it’s your responsibility to keep it clean and maintained.” He grabbed it and went to put it back into the safe in his room. When he came back, we walked to the truck and started the drive back toward civilization.The dirt driveway wound like a dead snake — the road laid over it like a careless coffin. I rolled the window down and smelled the pines and river water fill the cab, taking it all in for one last time before I left.

When we got halfway down the driveway, there was a patch in the forest that had been cleared out, I assumed when Grandpa first got here—maybe for logs or just a walking path so he and Grandma could go on picnics. When we got to the small gap in the woodline, I could see the mountains, and for just a second, a fraction of a heartbeat, something on the ridge moved into the woodline. I must have gasped or moved in my seat just enough to catch his attention.

“Everything okay over there, Tommy boy?” he asked, his eyes on the road.

“Yeah, it was just… I thought I saw something.”

“Probably just some cabin fever, buddy. You can only spend so much time with this old man before you go stir crazy.” I nodded but didn't answer.

As we reached the gate, Grandpa hopped out of the truck to unlock it. He walked back, rolled the truck past the gate, and hopped back out to lock it. The chains clicked and slid back around the gate posts. I could see Grandpa glancing into the trees, scanning for something or someone. A strong gust of wind blew off Grandpa's hat onto the ground as he walked back to the truck. He turned around and bent over to pick the hat up—and that’s when I saw the handgun tucked into the back of his jeans.

He came back, shifted the truck into drive, and said, “Back when I was your age in Alaska, I’d walk a half mile into the woods before first light. On those walks, I’d feel like there were more eyes in the trees than stars in the sky. When the sun would rise just enough, I thought I would see shapes where there weren’t any. I think nature has a way of messing with a person’s mind, especially when they're young.”

I smiled faintly. “I guess it got me a little bit too.”

“Just means that you're paying attention to what’s around you, and that’s a good thing, Tommy. Not paying attention could be the difference between a good hunt and going hungry, or making a hike and getting lost on a back fort. Never let the woods scare you. Fear only makes the woods—or whatever is in there—meaner.”

We rode the rest of the way in silence. When we got to the airport, he helped carry the bags to the doors and set them at my feet.

“Take good care of your parents, boy, and say hi to your dad for me. Tell him thank you for letting you come out here.” I nodded, hugging him. The smell of smoke and pine seeped into the fabric of his jacket.

As I walked back to the terminal doors, I waved goodbye one last time. Grandpa got back in the truck and waved back as he drove off. I was almost inside the doors when a breeze came from behind me, and for just a second, I could’ve sworn I heard someone calling my name.
