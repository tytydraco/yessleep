 No one was ever able to tell us apart. From birth until the age when we could begin to speak, our names were completely interchangeable.  I can picture it now; our already forgetful and borderline useless father unable to recall which son got placed in the green pajamas and which one the blue. Our mother, too busy doing every necessary task to keep the household running, unable, or rather simply uninterested in assigning the correct name to the correct son. Identification was at the very end of her long list of to-dos. I’ve often wondered whether or not I’m really myself. After my parents spun the wheel of names for those first few years, did I end up with the title I was supposed to have been given? Or does my body in actuality belong to him? To Wagner? I guess I’ll never know for certain, but it was our uncanny likeness that prompted the start of everything... 

\-- 

“*I’ll be with you the whole time. We’ll be anchored right off the coast. If you need anything, and I mean anything at all-*” 

I held up a hand. I knew how to finish the sentence. 

“*I’ll use the sat phone*.” 

Gemma smiled proudly.  If she was nervous, I couldn’t tell. She carried herself with such poise and composure that her other traits were at first glance imperceivable. There was more there though. So much more. My last three weeks with Gemma were spent in a state of monk-like preparation. She meticulously guided me as I fumbled my way through company terminology, financials, projections, names of coworkers and professional rivals, possible acquaintances that I would come across on the island, as well as various random and bizarre details about my brother that I couldn't fathom any practical reason to actually learn; Who’s favorite *Friends* character was Ross? Gemma was a Spartan mother about to send her son off to fend for himself in the wilderness. Hunt or be hunted. She did everything in her power to make sure that I wouldn't be the later.  

Gemma took my shirt in her hands and undid the top two buttons- 

“*Wagner liked people to think that he didn’t take himself too seriously.*” 

A crisp ocean breeze cut across my chest, sent shivers down my body, and made my nipples grow hard.  

“*Could we maybe split the difference?*” 

I went to re-do one of the buttons, but my hand was quickly slapped down by Gemma’s.  

“*No. The next six days are about coherence. From the second you step off this boat, you are not you. You are not Eddison. You are his brother. You are CEO of one of the fastest growing companies in the US. You are a tech savant, a recreational diver, a collector of modern and overpriced art, a habitual womanizer, and you leave your top two buttons undone. Always.*” 

I sighed. This wasn’t the first time she had to recite this speech to me.  

“*It’s less than a week. You can handle that.”* 

“*Well, what about after?*” 

“*You lie low and get fat on the company dime. Myself and the members of the board in the know can run things for a while, and then when the time is right and the markets have finally settled, we announce your- His- passing*.” 

My hands began to shake. It wasn’t just the wind this time. Gemma gently took my fluttering appendages into her own grasp and held them tight. She stared deep into my eyes.  

“*You’ve come so far. I’m quite proud of you. I mean it.*”  

I smiled back and offered a quiet nod. I couldn’t say thank you. I couldn’t rejoice in Gemma’s misplaced hope for me. I knew exactly what would happen as soon as I left the island, and returned to America. I would cash the check dangled over my head for the past month, head straight to my dealer, hole up in in my apartment, and dive head first into a sea of hazy bliss. The experience would not change me. It would not make me a better, smarter, more enlightened person. I would not remerge from the island as some sort of vessel for Wagner’s genius. I would stay Eddison Page. I would stay a pill addict, a junkie. I would be less than remarkable forever.  

The ship’s horn blared. Across the water, a sliver of green began to make itself known and from that thin strip of earth, a small tender tore away and headed straight towards us. Gemma released her grip and handed me my bag.  

“*This is it. Are you ready?*” 

“*You aren’t going to dock with us?*” 

“*No women on or near the island. Who knows what sort of havoc could be wrecked if a pair of tits made its way into the ranks. This is where we part, I’m afraid*.” 

I looked back towards the sea. The tender had somehow already arrived, its driver tethering itself to our dock below. I fiddled with my bag, taking in every last second as myself.  

“*What if this all doesn’t work? What if I slip up or the plan fails or..*.” 

Gemma cocked her head. 

“*Or what?*” 

“*I don’t know. Something bad happens?*” 

She chuckled to herself before letting the failing scenario sink in. For a moment her eyes sank. Had she never considered that the plan could fail? Surely, she must have. The whole board must have. A pantheon of scientific titans and not one of them accounting for an Error 500. Impossible. Gemma finished her calculations and as factually as she could mustered a quiet, blatant- 

“*Then chaos wins.*” 

She turned me around and pushed me towards the tender.  

“*I’ll see you in a week, Mr. Page.*” 

\-- 

The island was crawling with men. Men of all shapes, sizes, colors, and countries. From the guests to our Malaysian attendants, the Y chromosome was inescapable. I thought back to my adolescence. To a time when my pubescent mind would have used the setting as fodder for more erotic scenarios. These men however weren’t the chiseled jocks examining each other’s bodies in a post pump locker room or the sun-kissed pool boys looking for a workday distraction with their older, more established employers that typically filled my fantasies. These men were a breed unto their own. What they lacked in physical attractiveness they made up for in greatness. One less ab meant one more zero in their bank account. One less hair atop their head equaled one more world problem they were on the cusp of solving.  They were masters of their respective fields. Overlords of science, business, philanthropy. Scions of influence and power. The big names were never in attendance though. No Clinton, or Branson, or Bezos, or Musk. The household names were never extended an invite for the yearly gathering. According to Gemma they were considered far too self-absorbed and removed from reality to contribute anything of substance to The Garden. This meeting, this melding of minds, was meant for the second tier, the toilers. Those who didn’t just come up with the big ideas but actually struggled to achieve them. These men could do things. Unimaginable things. As I stepped off the dingy my knees buckled at the thought of it all.  

SPLASH! 

I hit the water face first.  

A group of pastel clad men smoking cigars on the beach began to laugh as two young attendants came running. The first helped me to my feet while the second grabbed my bag that began to float away in the surf.  They kept their heads down and ushered me towards the beach as fast as they could. A third boy approached with a handful of towels and all three began to work away at my clothing.  

“*You always know how to make an entrance, don’t you Page?*” The Green Pastel shouted across the beach.  

This was it. My first interaction. My first ruse. I furiously scanned the manifest of Waspy men that Gemma had tried to upload to my brain. They looked at me in anticipation. They were waiting for a reply. A retort. A joke. Who were these men? Their names were on the tip of my tongue. I was blanking. Drowning, faster with every second. They knew I was fraud. They could sense it like an odor I emitted. I was not one of them. I didn’t belong here. I wanted to turn around, dive into the water, and swim all the way back to Gemma. 

Green Pastel wouldn’t accept my silence. “*What’s wrong Wagner? Kitty cat got your tongue?*”  

His accent was thick. Thick and Southern. He was Texan. He had a cliched name. What was it? What was it... Houston! Houston Stevens. He ran a fracking company that operated throughout the Gulf of Mexico- 

“*You should give it back since you’re the only pussy I see here.*” 

Houston and the other Pastels let out a chuckle as he threw up the bird. The attendants finished drying me off and handed me my bag.  

“*Come join us once you’re settled. I've been waiting all year to own your sweet little ass in some Bacci Ball.*” 

“*I bet that’s not the only thing you’ve been wanting to do with this ass.*” 

The Pastels were inconsolable with laughter. I flung my bag over my shoulder and made my way towards a set of villas that I could make out just beyond the tree line. As I crossed the threshold from sand to dirt, their giggling began to morph amongst the acoustics of the jungle and turned to a chorus of demonic cackles. They taunted me with every step I took.  

\-- 

I did my best to steer clear of the other Garden guests and discretely made my way to Wagner’s assigned villa. I dropped my bag to the floor and fell onto the bed with a thud. No more than twenty minutes on the island and I was already spent. How could I possibly last a whole week? I pulled the sat phone from my bag and texted Gemma.  

“*Just got to villa. No slip ups... yet.*” 

She responded almost instantly. Anticipating my anxiety most likely.  

“*We’re off to a good start then. Breathe. You got this.*” 

KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! 

I shoved the phone into the nightstand drawer like a teen with a porno mag and jumped to my feet. I did as Gemma instructed. I took a breath and opened the door.  

“*Mr. Page. It’s good to see you again. Welcome back to The Garden.*” 

The young Malaysian, holding a fresh set of towels, stared at me with pleasant sincerity and I stared back with blank nothingness. Out of all the faces that Gemma had me study, the local support staff were not included on the list. God damn it Wagner, why did you have to be so fucking charismatic? The attendant awkwardly chuckled and bowed his head in embarrassment. 

“*Excuse me, Sir, that was presumptuous of me. I’m sure you must meet so many people. I’m Bishaam. We spoke during last year’s Garden. I’ve been promoted to a valet this summer. Your personal valet.*” 

I smiled and dove into the narrative the young man had unwittingly, and thankfully provided. 

“*Bishaam. Of course. I’m sorry it’s just... It’s just been a long day of travel. It’s good to see you again... you’ve been well?*” 

“*Very. I’ve been sticking to my English classes like you suggested. I’ll be applying for a translator position with the Ministry as soon as I pass my proficiency test*.” 

“*Well... you sure sound proficient to me.*” 

He waited for more. Most likely hoping that I would deliver more morsels of bonding from the previous summer’s chat with Wagner, but before I could improvise something generic and feasible, Bishaam  cut my suffering short and handed over the towels in his hands.  

“*Anything that needs washed or clean you can leave in the basket on the porch. I also took the liberty of placing some fresh Ixora on the dressers. I remember you said that you were fond of it.*” 

“*Thank you, Bisaam, that’s very thoughtful.*” 

“*I will let you be. It is good to see you again, Mr. Page.*”  

Bishaam left with a smile and I shut the door with a huff of exhaustion. More names. More people. More storylines to keep straight. I needed a fix. I needed it bad, but I came to the island with nothing. Part of my agreement with Gemma and the company was a mandatory detox and daily room and cavity checks. My demons were of no surprise to them. What Wagner didn’t tell them of my life I’m sure a simple Google search into my past would easily reveal. They knew what issues could arrive with this complex plan but they made sure that my vices would not be a wrench. 

I began to sweat. I checked the minibar. Nothing but waters, and juice, and soft drinks. Foolish of me to think that someone would slip up and stock a few bottles of Titos. I ran across the room and threw open the windows. I dashed to the AC and fiddled with the buttons. I worked myself into a tizzy. The air became thick. I couldn’t do as Gemma instructed. I couldn’t breathe. I was having a panic attack. A big one. I hadn’t had one like this since after the accident. Since that fucking car hit us head on, left a gash in my skull and the man next me dead. I needed something. Anything. I ran to the flowers of the desk. I widened my nostrils as far as they could go and sucked in the aroma of Bishaam’s gift. For a moment it worked. The scent calmed me down. It relaxed my mind. I felt light. I felt easy. Then everything began to spin as I blacked out and fell to the floor.  

\-- 

I woke to the sound of drums, distant but close, and felt a thick moisture dripping down the side of my head. I put a hand to the sensation and dabbed. Red. I must have hit my head on the way down. I sat up and looked out the window. The sun had already set and the moon shone brightly over the ocean.  How long was I out for? I grabbed one of Bishaam’s towels and held it to my skull as I opened the door and peaked outside. The chorus of thumping continued as a volley of drunken men, skipped and staggered their way through the villas towards a nearby bridge connecting to the jungle. I clutched the towel to my head and followed after.  

\-- 

The lamp lit jungle was filled with a cacophony of ululation. I’m not sure if it was my head, the shrieking or the drums, most likely a combination of all three, but my skull began to pound. I walked across the bridge as slowly as I could, one foot in front of the other, as savant after scholar whipped past me reeking of booze. I fell to the floor and vomited off the side of the bridge into a small river.  

“*Poor baby can’t hold his liquor.*” Houston Stevens came up behind me and giggled as he began to feign anal sex with me.  

“*Oh yeah. Page loves it.*” 

His pasteled posse of inebriated imbeciles responded with the same laughter as they did on the beach.  I wanted to break his jaw and toss him into the water below.  

“*You never showed for Bacci Ball*!” 

I managed to muster a weak, bile tinged- 

“*Tomorrow.*” 

Houston completed his penetration and slapped my back. 

“*Daddy is looking forward to it. What the hell happened to your head?*” 

“*Nothing. I’m fine.*” 

The Pastels grabbed me by the shoulders, pulled me to my feet, and tossed the towel into the river. Houston wrapped his arms around me and aimed me towards the jungle.  

“*Let it bleed. Let’s go! It’s Opening Ceremony!!”* 

They all let out a cheer. I wanted to slit their throats.  

\-- 

It was a bumble bee. Eight or nine feet tall, carved into the thick body of the tree, and outlined in gold. The way it reflected the moonlight gave it the look of a hieroglyph, like a symbol from the Book of the Dead that pulled some sort of magical trigger. The fifty or so drunken men danced and drank and vomited before it as a small group of attendants off to the side accompanied the madness with a symphony of untamed drums and bells. As we got closer Houston shouted to the group- 

“*Buzz, Buzz!*” 

The phrase was recited back, this time amplified by 50-fold.  

“*BUZZ, BUZZ!!*” 

Houston tussled my hair like a creepy uncle.  

“*That’s the stuff!*" 

Houston and the Pastels pushed me into the crowd. They circled around me and began to flail their bodies with the rest of the crowd. The vibration of the drums pulsed through my skull. I could feel them inside me. Every note and beat shot a bullet through my veins. I tried to free myself, to escape, to find an out from the painful middle aged mosh pit. It was no use. Everywhere I turned there was an elbow to the ribs, a loose hand to the face, a Pastel to yank me back in. This was chaos. This was hell. I thought I was about to pass out again when from nowhere a loud horn was blown and the music immediately ceased. The men fell to their knees and thankfully so could I.  

An aged, sturdy man carrying a torch walked through the crowd and ascended the stage before the Bee. He lit a small firepit at the center of the stage, raised his hands to the sky, and yelled to the heavens- 

“*Buzz, Buzz Brothers*!” 

The man looked down to face us all. I knew this one. This was an important one, the most important one. He was the Organizer, the Master of Ceremonies. The Garden was his brainchild back in the 70’s. This was James. The men all said hello to him- 

“*BUZZ, BUZZ BROTHER!!*” 

James peered down at us like a farmer inspecting his harvest and smiled at his lot.  

“*My Brothers. It’s finally here; Another Garden is upon us!*” 

The men hooted, and hollered, and cheered. 

“*Each year we make our pilgrimage to this island. From the four corners of the globe, we travel by sea, and land, and sky to assemble here and revel in a year’s worth of change, a year’s worth of progress. Here no friend, no family, no woman may enter. Here there is only Us. There is only Man. Our Dominance alone and nothing else!*” 

The dominant men roared again.  

“*Over the course of the next few days, we will dance, we will drink, we will be merry. But most importantly we will connect. We will bond. We will become one. So that when we depart, when we return to the fragmented realms that we master, we will know that we are always tethered to our brothers.* " 

An excited Pastel stood up and let out a loose Buzz. James and a few other attendees began to chuckle. 

“*Yes, I know, I’m excited too, Brother. Let us not wait any longer then. Let a new Garden bloom! Invites; To the stage!*” 

“*To the Stage! To the stage! To the stage!*” The men ponded their fists on the ground and chanted in unison.  

From behind the Bumble Bee, three men with burlap sacks over their heads were led onto the stage as a young attendant produced a chalice and handed it to James.  

“*We drink the nectar of the Garden so that we may always be reminded of how sweet it is. The Garden is our vitality. The Garden is our lifeblood*.” 

The excited Pastel yelled out once more- 

“*Drink it up!*” 

More pounding and chanting. “*Drink it up! Drink it up! Drink it up!”* 

James put out a friendly hand to calm his congregation. “*My, my, it’s going to be a fun Garden this year, isn’t it?*” 

James approached the first masked man. “*An invitee of Brother Houston-*” 

Houston stood to his feet. 

“*Brother Houston, do you invite this man into The Garden?*” 

Houston beamed with arrogant, pride, “*I do Brother James*!” 

“*Then let us all welcome, Brother Sawyer, Brother Houston’s very own son!*” 

James removed the sack on Sawyer Stevens. The young man, who sadly was just as appealing as his father, took the chalice and drank as everyone let out a cheer and a Buzz. Houston was beside himself with pride as Sawyer descended from the stage and joined his father on the ground. James moved onto the next pledge.  

“*An invitee of Brother Donald-*” 

A stuffy looking obese man stood. 

“*Brother Donald, do you invite this man into the Garden?*” 

“*I do Brother James*.” 

“*Then let us all welcome, Brother Reza!*” 

James removed the sack and I stifled a gasp. Reza, unlike the backwoods Texan pledge before him, was stunning. The beautiful, Persian man, who couldn’t have been older than 30 took the cup and drank deeply. The crowd congratulated him and he descended the stairs and took a seat next to his sponsor Donald.  

I couldn’t take my eyes off him. In an ocean of calloused monsters, Reza was a sight to behold. He looked like sea glass. Shiny and smooth and glistening as you pulled it from the water. I studied his face in detail, looking for some sort of flaw or speck of mistake, but there was none. This man was perfect. A true flower for the garden. He turned his head and our eyes locked. I quickly diverted my attention back to the stage where James was approaching the final pledge. 

“*An invitee of Brother Wagner-*” 

I gulped. I stood. I thought back to my lessons with Gemma. Who did she say Wagner invited? Did she even say at all? My mind raced to think who this person was or could be, but there was nothing. Gemma had not mentioned this in our studies. The man behind the sack was as big a mystery to me as it would be to the other men.  

“*Brother Wagner, do you invite this man into The Garden?*” 

“*Yes I- I do. Brother James...”* 

He nodded and smiled.  

“*Then let us all welcome, Brother Tiger!*” 

As James removed the sack, the congregation went quiet. There were no cheers, there was no buzzing or hurrahs or fraternal jubilation. There was only silence and then an obnoxious and repugnant voice. Houston’s. 

“*What the hell?!*” 

Whispers began to work their way through the crowd as the realization slowly began to set in. The man standing before us came with an asterisk. Why though? Who was this man. The congregation began to cry heresy. At James, at Tiger, and at myself- 

“*You’ve got to be kidding me!”  “Is this a joke?”  “I know a man when I see one!”* 

Tiger held firm. He did not move. James put out a hand to try and calm the zealots beneath him.  

“*My Brothers... Brothers please..*.” 

They wouldn’t stop though. The taunts kept going. The hate kept spewing. And the anger kept flowing. 

Houston stared daggers at me from the ground.  

“*What the fuck, Page!?*” 

James grew frustrated and tired of the insolence before him. From the depths of his diaphragm, he released an Earth shattering- 

“*ENOUGH!*” 

Everyone settled. I looked to Tiger who looked like steel. Completely unphased and unbothered. James's voice echoed throughout the jungle.  

“*The world- society- is constantly changing. In order for our Garden to truly blossom, for our roots to reach deep across the Earth, we must change as well!*” 

Donald stood- 

“*James this isn’t... this is not*\-” 

He tried to find the right words. I looked to his side, to his pledge Reza who looked down at the Earth with the same steely stare that Tiger adorned.  

“*This is not the... this place... this place is meant for... for men*!” 

Tiger stepped forward and snatched the chalice from James’ hand. 

“*I am one*.” 

He drank deep as all sets of eyes turned to me.  

\-- 

A meeting was called.  James, Houston, a few other senior members, Tiger, and myself sat at large round table in James’ villa. Houston and a few men argued to remover Tiger immediately. Another faction fought for him to stay. Tiger sat in his same unbreakable silence he arrived with at the ceremony. James listened to all sides, cupped his hands in a ball over his mouth, and after a few moments finally spoke- 

“*I have to say I anticipated a bit of backlash, but nothing quite like this... I began this retreat more than half a century ago so that the men who watched over this world could have a week of peace and bonding. However, it is quite evident that the peace I sought to establish may not fully take effect under the current situation and whatever bonding could happen is at risk when there is conflict such as this. Brother Houston; I have heard your arguments. And while I understand your concerns, we cannot deny that the world today is different than the one in which The Garden was first established. That being said you are a forever and well-respected member of this brotherhood and Brothers always come first.*” He then looked to me, to Wagner- 

“*Brother Wagner; you are also a well-respected member of this order.  This is your guest. You have invited them to the Garden. You have identified a quality within them that you thought would enhance the Brotherhood and in effect help make the world a more connected, better place. You will be the deciding voice. The decision lies with you*.” 

I had gone from one of the popular kids to a social pariah in less than a day and the status of my remaining time on the island, all relied on my next set of words. I wish I could say that I did the brave thing, that I chose justice, that I made a conscious decision to further the status and platform of a fellow member of the LGBTQ+ community, but I didn’t. My decision was based entirely around self-preservation. If I allowed Tiger to stay, to enforce Wagner’s choice, I would be black balled. No one would speak to me and I could ride out this week hopefully not having to interact with anyone. Maybe being a pariah wouldn’t be so bad. I’ve been adjacent to it for most of my life, what was six more days?  

“*Tiger stays.*” 

And it was done.  

\-- 

I walked back to my villa in relief. I could hide in my room for the rest of my stay, practically retreat and no one would care. I could achieve Gemma and the company’s goal of showing face, presenting Wagner as alive and well before the company went public, all while staying true to my shrinking, private self. I began to smile. I felt a sense of ease for the first time in a while. Then I hit the dirt. 

“*Traitor.*”  

Houston and two of the anti-Tiger faction walked past and spat at me in contempt. Shit. I began to wonder if I had really made the smart choice after all.  

I got to my knees and examined my elbows and palms, both coated in dirt and specks of blood. That, along with my still open forehead, made me look like someone who had escaped a mugging rather than enjoying a tropical vacation. A voice from behind me- 

“*Wow. You really look like shit*.” I turned to Tiger, smoking and chuckling against a palm tree. He took a long drag and blew out into the moonlight. 

“*You did a pretty stupid thing just now, you know that?*” 

“*What was I supposed to have done? Send you back after inviting you all this way?”*  Wagner didn’t have to be annoyed; I was plenty irked at Tiger’s seemingly casual ungratefulness. 

“*Don’t get all pissy. We both knew we were doing. We brought a storm with us. Lighting strikes were-  are to be expected. Also, I’m not great with ‘Thank You’s.’ But you know that already.*” 

Tiger took another drag. “*Let’s chat tomorrow over breakfast. I want to hear more about this ‘World Changing Idea’ of yours.*”  

I got to my feet and quickly tried to negate the proposal.  “*Let’s do it after we leave. When we’re back home. I’ll have my people... call your people. I want to just relax this week*.” 

Tiger laughed heartily and stubbed out his cigarette.  

“*Please. I can already tell no one comes to this place to relax*.” 

He pulled a bottle of pills from his pocket, popped one, and tossed the bottle to me.  

“*What’s this?*” 

“*Fresh from San Fran. Don’t worry. It’s completely pure. I told you; I’m not good with ‘Thank You’s.*"  Tiger began to saunter back into the jungle.  

“*I’ll see you tomorrow*.” 

He was gone and I was left alone with a bottle pills. I wish I could say it was hard for me. That I struggled with the devil and angel on my shoulders. That I made a real effort to stick to the sobriety that Gemma, the company, and myself worked so hard to achieve, but if I said all that it would be a lie. And this story is only the truth. I emptied four neon pink pills into palm and dry swallowed them as quickly as I could.  

\-- 

I sat on the beach and watched the surf roll in beneath the moonlight. The sand felt like silk between my fingers. I couldn’t stop sifting through it, swirling my palms in large motions by my side, making tiny crop circles in the ground. Tiger was right, this stuff was pure. I fell back and began to make sand angels. I looked up to the stars that shone with a vibrancy I had never seen before, not just because whatever drugs were coursing through my system were top of the line, but because the sky out here was so clear, completely unfettered by skyscraper or plane or streetlamp. Even though my heart was pounding through my chest at a mile a minute, the familiar calm that took over me was indescribably soothing. I basked in the glow of the cosmos above and began to cry. I would only ever truly be at peace when I was in this state of nothingness, when I was lost. My crying ceased and my heart went still when I heard a voice, his voice, beside me- 

“*Eddison.*” 

It wasn’t him. It couldn't be him. He was no more, gone in a blink of an eye. He was gone and buried just like my brother was. His stuff was sold and his mail was shredded when it kept arriving at the apartment. My fiancé was just that. He was shredded. Un-whole. Unable to be put back together or saved. This was not him. It was merely a drug indued mirage caused by Tiger’s potent pink pills. I knew it. But even though I knew it, I still couldn’t help myself. I opened my eyes and turned my head- 

“*Brett*?” 

He smiled brightly at me, his teeth looking like pearls in the moonlight. He was ghostly but only in a way that made him shimmer, made him sparkle.  

“*Is this real? How are you-*” 

He put a hand to his lips and I stifled my sentence. Brett took me in. Every wrinkle, every hair, every cell of my skin. He saw me in death, just as he did when he was alive; completely and totally. He raised a hand, hovered it in front of my face, and whispered- 

“*Run.*” 

He touched my forehead and my whole being began to shake. Limb by limb, every cell in my body began to vibrate as searing pain shot from my skull down to my toes.  What was happening? What was this ghost, this drug induced hallucination doing to me?  

“*Brett... Brett...*” 

I couldn’t speak. My mouth was going dry and I couldn’t feel my tongue. Was I convulsing? Having a seizure? The ghost offered no help, instead Brett stood, raised his hands above his head, and as if he was being doused in tar, his body began to turn an icy black. His eyes rescinded into his head, his mouth sinched itself shut, and all discerning features began to succumb to the strange oily substance that began to coat his body. I was frozen in fear. What was going on? I had never had a trip like this before. One so terrifying, so specific, so utterly heart stopping. It all felt too real. I managed to get to my knees and begin to crawl away.  

As I crawled, I heard a roar. I turned back and saw not Brett, but a monster. His coating was complete and he began to float. He rose higher and higher off the sand until he hovered above me, a good seven or eight feet above the ground. His new self-looked like a shadow against the moonlight. I got to my knees and ran.  

\-- 

Across the beach, over the trees, and through the villas, Brett’s Shadow chased after me. I looked up to the sky. Brett hovered above and stared down at me through an opening in the trees. He roared in anger and began descending, like a comet. I staggered as fast as I could towards my villa. The pain was still so strong. Every step, every inch, sent a shock through my nerves. I reached the porch. I fumbled for my key. I looked back the way I came; Brett had reached ground level and was gliding straight for me with his arms outstretched. It was coming for me. It wanted to consume me. I found my key, ran into my villa, and shut the door in the Shadow’s face.  

I locked the door, through a chair beneath the handle, and slumped to the floor as I began to sob. I did not want to be on this island. I did not want to be doing weird frat brother rituals with the rich and powerful. I did not want to be an addict. I had a good a life. A life I loved. A man I loved. All I wanted was Brett.  

As my heart began to slow, I looked around the room and noticed that my things were everywhere. Clothes, toiletries, towels, even the flowers Bishaam had gifted me were turned over and smashed. What the hell happened? Was it the work of Houston and his clan of good ol’ boys? Or someone else who had some sort of bone to pick with Wagner? It didn’t matter. I was done with all of it. One day on this island was already far too many. I didn’t care if I got the check from the company. I didn’t care if I let Gemma down, if all our prep and hard work was for naught. I was tapping out. I ran to the bedside table and threw open the drawer.  

“*No.... no...no!*” 

I must have felt every square inch of that small, hollow, retractable box, but there was nothing. Nothing at all.  

The sat phone was gone.
