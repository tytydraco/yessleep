I could have flown home, but I thought a drive would clear my head.

I’d just finished four years in the Marines, four of the messiest years of my life. I had made the mistake of bringing my new wife to California with me and returned from Iraq to find her warming someone else’s bed. The bed in question was of a fellow Marine, someone left on base while I fought and bled for my country. After six months of staying on base so I could meet with lawyers and finish my divorce, I was officially out and done.

When I told my dad that I was going to rent a car and drive home, he understood. I told him I needed to come back slow so I could clear my mind, and he told me to drive safe. “Take your time, kid. We'll be here when you get back,” he said and I took him up on it. I was coming cross country, California to Tennessee, and I was seeing the sights and taking in the local flavor. I had decided to make this a long overdue vacation.

I did a lot of thinking on that trip, but my only mistake was picking the kid up.

I was driving through Oklahoma, enjoying the sights and feeling like I could watch the hills and valleys roll by forever, when I saw the kid standing there with his thumb out. He was young, couldn’t have been old enough to enlist, despite his army coat. It was July, the heat stifling, but he was wearing fatigues and a service jacket that looked antique. A breeze ruffled his hair, pushing it back in a harsh puff that made me think of kids blowing on dandelion fluffs. Maybe it was the jacket or maybe it was the look of naked want on his face, but I pulled up beside him and rolled the window down.

“Hey kid, you need a lift?”

He turned his perfect sky blue eyes to me, and I’ll never forget his words. 

I sometimes hear them in my sleep.

“I sure do. Can you give me a lift to McMan, mister? God will thank you if’n ya do.”

I thought that was a little weird, but I told him to climb in and he did so gladly.

The signs told me McMan was about thirty miles up the road, and I expected the kid to chatter like a squirrel the whole way. To my surprise, he was quiet, his eyes closed and his head bowed for the first couple of minutes. It took me a second to realize he was praying, and when he finished, he sat up and plastered a half daffy grin on his face. 

“God tell ya I was a straight shooter?” I asked, more to break the ice than anything.

“He said to thank you for your assistance, Mr. You will be greatly rewarded in his kingdom.”

I nodded, thinking I could use all the help I could get. The farther we drove, the more I began to suspect that something was off about the kid. He stared forward the whole way, his blue eyes on the horizon, and his mouth seemed set in an eternal grin. He wasn’t as young as I’d thought, maybe eighteen or nineteen, and the jacket had the name Harris stenciled on it. It was covered in patches too, the kind you get for service, and I was glancing at one on his left breast when I saw the bulge under the coat.

I felt a cold shudder run through me as I recognized it.

The kid was packing!

“You look a little young for the service, kid,” I said, trying to disuade some of my fears,“Your brother give you that jacket? Was he in Iraq like me?”

“My dad left it to me when he died.” the kid said matter of factly.

“Sorry to hear that. Was he in Iraq?”

“The Gulf War,” he said, his voice not matching the grin “He enlisted before it started and was there for a couple years after it ended.”

I nodded, “I bet he had some stories. I was in,”

I had been about to start on one of my Sand Box Tales, but the kid cut me off suddenly with the last thing I expected.

“Do you believe in God, Mister?”

I blinked, the subject unexpected.

“Not really, kid.” I answered, being honest, “I’m an atheist, have been ever since what happened to me overseas. I think that, if there is a God, it’s pretty crummy of him to let us live here like this.”

I had expected a fight, but the kid just nodded.

“He forgives you for that. Daddy was like you, Momma said, before he went to war. He saw something over there, bad things, and he came back from the war looking for God. He said he had seen some things over there that scared him and made him want to be better, and he couldn't do better without some help. So, he came back and started looking for a purpose, and he found one. He found a lot of people offering purpose, but only one who delivered. By the time I was born, he was part of the Family.”

I listened politely, not wanting to interrupt the kid, but the way he was talking about his dad's search for God made me a little concerned.

It didn’t seem like a happy memory.

“I was born into the Family. Father Marcus was our everything, our teacher, our preacher, our second father, and our salvation. He brought lots of people together, lots of lost people, but that wasn’t enough. Father Marcus wanted more. He had plans, big plans, but they wouldn't turn out be so good for us.”

He was quiet for a minute, looking out the glass and seeming lost in thought. I thought again that he had to be a kid, couldn't be out of high school, but maybe it was just whatever was wrong with him. Even though his eyes looked like he was in the worst pain imaginable, he still wore that plastered-on grin that never reached those eyes. He was like a doll with a troubled owner, a doll that smiles through its destruction.

“When I was ten, Father Marcus told the congregation that the end times were coming. He told them that the government was going to come down and take everything that we had built here, that the Devil was set against us and we needed to escape. He told everybody to sell their things, bring the bare minimum, and come to a place that he had found. It was a farm on the outskirts of town, a big farm that had once been a dairy. They gave him their money so that he could secure their paradise, free from anything that the government or the devil or anybody else might do, and came there to start their new lives. We were hopeful that this would be our paradise, but it wasn’t a paradise. In the end, it was a prison.”

I felt a chill run up my spine as he said that. I wanted to tell him to stop. I didn’t want to hear the end of it, but instead, I just listened. The kid was hurting, that was clear enough, but his story was so captivating. It was like one of those true crime stories, the ones so bad that you just know it has to be true. I kept my eyes on the road and listened, just letting him tell it, already knowing that it wouldn’t have a happy ending.

“We were basically his slaves. We worked in the fields, we took care of the animals, we kept the big house, where he lived, and did his bidding. Father Marcus came down to spit the hellfire every night and to pass down new edicts and rules. Men were not permitted in the big house. No one but Father Marcus could lay with a woman, even within a marriage. All children were Father Marcus's children, but his actual children were special. Eventually,he took all the women that he liked up to the house to "populate the earth". He took my sister up there with him, and we never saw her again. People didn’t like it much, but what could they do? Father Marcus was keeping us safe from the apocalypse, right? So we followed his orders, until everything fell apart.”

We rolled into the outskirts of McMan then, the farms and barns making me think of the place the kid was talking about. I wondered, suddenly, where we were going, and why the kid wanted to go to McMan so badly? Every mile felt like an eternal march, and I was dreading coming to the end of the journey.

“Where,” I started but the kid seemed to be expecting my question.

“Stay on the Main road, mister” he said, clearing his throat before going on. He seemed as dry as an old stick, and when I reached behind the seat and offered him a coke from the cooler, he took it with a smile. I wondered why I had done that? I didn’t want the kid to go on, but in a way I did. I needed the end of it, I needed to know how it had all shook out. I was a curious bastard, it seemed, and I needed to see the bodies in this kids path.

“Then one day, he gathered us in the barn and told us that the end was near. He told us we needed to prepare ourselves to go, because we were meeting God tonight. He gave us all something to drink, something in a red cup that his wives dipped out, and we all drank it. No one argued, no one fought him. We were all so brainwashed that we would have jumped in front of the six fifteen train that ran near the farm if he’d asked. Everyone drank, everyone obeyed, and everyone went to sleep. They stayed asleep too, except me. I woke up in the hospital with tubes in my arms and my wrists secured to the bed. The police were there, one of them waiting in the room with me, and they had questions. It turned out that they were the ones who had been coming, not God. They had arrived to find everyone dead, fallen around the barn like dolls, but had managed to get there in time to save me. I don't know why I lived while everyone else died, and it ate me up for a long time. Father Marcus, my family, everyone was gone, and I had been left behind. No one wanted anything to do with me, my Dad had burned a lot of bridges before we went into the Family, and none of them wanted to take in a moody sixteen year old who'd just been through hell. So I went into the system, going from group home to group home, until a couple weeks ago.”

I clutched the wheel hard, suddenly very worried about what we might find in McMan. The town was coming up now, a nice old brick town that looked downright picturesque. We passed a sign for a new Mega Church, the Sunrise Gospel House, and there was a smiling old guy beaming down from the front. The kid shot a glare at him, and patted his heart, inevitably patting the piece as well.

I suddenly wondered who was in McMan that this kid needed to see?

“I was watching TV in the group home and an ad came on for a church. The church had recenly aquired its own network, and the pastor of the church was very familiar. He spoke about peace and God's love, but all I could hear was the voice that told us to drink the juice and go meet God. As I watched him smiling and hugging people, I heard a very different voice in the back of my mind. It was God, the real God, and he told me what I had to do. He said I needed to be his sword, and I needed to cleave the unrighteous from his midst.”

He patted the gun again, whispering a prayer to God, and my hair stood up on the back of my neck as something strange and strange wafted from the kid.

At that moment, he felt very righteous. 

We were well into town now, rolling up Main Street, and he told me to stop. I dropped the kid off at the light, and he thanked me, saying he could make it from here. He gave me a real smile then, not the doppy one he'd been wearing the whole way through his sad little tale, and waved at me.

“God bless you, mister. I'm off to do his work.”

Then he was gone, and I sat there watching him go until someone politely honked behind me and I was forced to roll along. 

I wasn’t sure what to do as I made my way out of town. Did I tell someone? If this pastor had really messed the kid up like that, then maybe he had it coming. Was that really my call to make, though? In the end, I called the McMan police department and told them what I suspected. I told them about the kid and the story he had spilled, but I don’t think they took me seriously. The dispatcher seemed like the report was going in a little pile of crackpot shit, but I felt I had done my due diligence.

I was still thinking about it when I stopped for the night, wondering where the kid was and what he was doing as I drifted off to sleep.  

I woke up the next day and turned on the news to see that Pastor Michael Wheeler of the Sunrise Gospel House had been shot in front of his congregation. The Pastor, someone wanted by the FBI for his alleged connection to several past cults, had been shot by someone from one of his past religious orders. The kid was in custody, but police were already saying he was mentally unwell and this was likely a retaliation slaying. Police were still looking for a mysterious caller who had tipped them off before the shooting, and they had many questions for that individual.

I left Oklahoma as quickly as I could, flinching every time I saw a cop.

That was a couple of years ago, and I've never told anyone what happened on that trip home. 

It's something that's weighed on me since I let that kid out on Main Street, and I can only imagine that he was right about God blessing me. I came back, found a job that paid well, met the love of my life, and settled into wedded bliss fairly easy. It all seemed very easy while it was happening, and I can't help but wonder if a little divine direction had something to do with it.

As long as he doesn't point me at his enemies like he did that kid, I suppose we can be square.
