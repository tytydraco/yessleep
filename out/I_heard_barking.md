I work night shift at some barrel factory. 6pm to 4:30 am. After my shift I usually just drive home, which usually has me paranoid because I live deep in the country and watch alot of YouTube videos like Wendigoon and missing people stuff. But usually when I get home I let my dog out, watch some tv and do whatever other things need done. 

Sometime last week while letting my dog out to pee, she seemed to see something in the trees around my house. She kind of just stopped in her tracks before frantically running back to the front door. I kind of brushed it off as her seeing some animal that I didn't see, like a rabbit or something. 

But tonight while taking my dog out, as I'm calling her inside. I heard what sounded like a weird kind of barking, just in the tree line, but it sounded like a grown man poorly trying to sound like a dog. It sounded more like someone yelling "ruff" in a monotone voice. I'm inside now but I'm really freaked out, my heart is racing and I'm scared. I've watched alot of stuff on cryptids, like skinwalkers and whatever else, and while I don't necessarily believe in them, I don't exactly not believe in stuff like that either. 

My dog is acting weird and has been hiding under my bed, which is not normal behavior from her. Also the window in my room is broken due to a recent accident by my younger brother and it only has a layer of plastic and some curtains over it. I'm afraid that I'm going to hear something else tonight. My doors are locked but I don't know if I'm going to be able to sleep. I'll make another post if something else happens.

After writing this I had just thought about something I heard this morning from my older brother. He said that he and my parents had saw lights that were similar to people walking around with flash lights down the hill, through the trees behind our house last night. This might not have anything to do with what I heard but it's just weird. Another weird occurrence lately is that our dogs have been coming home with a limp. My parents have 3 dogs, my brother has one and I have one. Within the last week, 3 of our dogs have come home limping for seemingly no reason. We all went out to look around the yard and just into the trees and didn't find anything out of the ordinary. Our dogs don't typically wander too far from our home so we have no idea what's causing this. I don't know of any of these weird things are related but I think they're worth mentioning. Also all of the dogs, except for mine, were inside when I heard barking. 


I made this throw away account specifically for this story, as I did not feel comfortable posting it to my main reddit account. I would also like to note that these occurrences are true and really happened. It's been about a half hour that I've been inside and I haven't heard anything through my window, but I will post any updates. Probably to a different subreddit that allows shorter posts.
