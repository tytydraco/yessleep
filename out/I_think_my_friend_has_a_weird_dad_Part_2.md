[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1obzc0w/i_think_my_friend_as_a_weird_dad/)



In my last post I was asking if you guys found J’s family as weird as I did. Apparently, you all very much did, so that was vindicating to hear. J still is pretty certain his family is normal. Or was normal, I suppose. Mikayla and his kid are his family now. They are pretty normal, I’d say.

After we dropped our kids off for school we had breakfast at a café we used to frequent in high school. I shared with Mikayla my recent theory about J’s family and how they are weird. She agreed with me. J just rolled his eyes and argued with us. Mikayla then brought up a story I forgot about. The arcade and her dad’s car crash.

 

A lot of the summer before high school was spent with Mikayla, Emily, and J. The four of us would ride J’s dad’s two dirt bikes around town. Sometimes we’d go to the park and camp by the lake until the park rangers found us and politely told us to leave. Other times we would drive a little out of town to the abandoned construction sites and find abandoned tools to sell at the pawn shop. New tools kept showing up at the sites. Looking back, I think they were still working there. We were just kids accidentally stealing their impact drills and saws.

 Some nights we were able to scrape up enough cash by doing odd jobs for J’s dad to afford a special trip: the arcade in the town over. This arcade was the coolest place to be for kids in the middle of nowhere. Hot food, cold soda, and the newest consoles with the newest games hooked up to TVs. That arcade is where J and I fell in love with Call of Duty Modern Warfare for the 360.

We weren’t good at it.

 

As was tradition back then, the four of us would go to the dollar store before our trip to the arcade. We had to smuggle in energy drinks so we could stay up all night, obviously. On the way down the big hill leading to the store, Mikayla gave us the ‘cop ahead’ wave.

Yeah, J and I didn’t catch it in time. We sped past that Sheriff’s deputy at like 45 in a 30.

His lights flickered on, and we pulled to the side of the road. The deputy was someone we knew. He was one of the three deputies that would serve this part of the Ozarks. Unlike his coworkers, he was pretty lenient about our tomfoolery. He told us to slow it down because we could hurt ourselves. He gave us a warning but threatened to give us a ticket if J and I don’t get helmets.

Looking back on it, I find it odd how much he kept reaching his hand under the dirt bike’s fender. At first, I thought he was motioning Emily to scoot up on the bike. But I don’t think that was it. That doesn’t make sense. If anyone has any ideas what he was doing, please let me know. I have no idea.

The moment the officer drove off to find his next trap, J turned his speaker back on. We, despite the best warnings from the officer, continued to go 40-50 down the county road all the way until the dollar store.

We loaded up on drinks, candy, anything else Mikayla and Emily could stuff into their jackets when we get to the arcade. We paid at the front counter, heading back out to our bikes. The officer’s cruiser was pulling out of the parking lot as the dollar store door chimed. I don’t think I can remember if he was there before we got there or not.

 

The sun was setting by the time we filled up the bikes with gas and got back to J’s house. His dad’s red F150 sat in the gravel driveway. We piled into the bed of his truck and sang along to whatever crappy song J blared on his speaker all the way to the arcade.

Most of the night has been lost to time, unfortunately. It was fun, I remember that. But the exacts weren’t really memorable. I just remember J fumbling Emily at least twice. Mikayla awkwardly flirted with Blake, a classmate who J and I knew from the football team. I played Ms. Pacman for much longer than I care to admit.

The hours bled away faster than any of us thought possible. When one of the staff members told us it is time to leave, we all were confused. J’s dad was supposed to pick us up at eleven. The arcade closes at midnight. J asked to use the phone and called his dad. He didn’t pick up.

One by one we called our dads. Mikayla and Emily couldn’t get ahold of theirs. I got ahold of my stepdad but only briefly. Blake just said he’s going to ‘walk home’. I think he was picked up by the Sheriff’s department later that night for trespassing. Can’t say for certain, though.

Around one-thirty or even two, my stepdad finally pulled up. Shortly after, J’s dad’s truck pulled in too. My stepdad seemed really confused by it. I couldn’t tell you why. But I saw J climb into the passenger seat. Mikayla climbed in the back right after. But Emily lingered. She looked my way before slowly climbing in after her sister.

 

My stepdad told me on the way home that the sisters’ dad was in a car crash. J’s dad took him to the hospital, and it didn’t look great. My stepdad was supposed to pick us all up when he got the news, but J’s dad still showed up. I still remember making excuses for J’s dad. I tried grasping at straws. Trying to make sense of how he’d make it to the nearest city hospital and to the arcade within a few hours. My stepdad joked that maybe he can teleport. I still remember how tightly he was grabbing the steering wheel. The tension in his jaw that I could see, even in the darkness of night.

 

Emily and Mikayla still came by my house the next morning. The three of us walked to J’s house to get him. His dad’s trucks were all gone. All four of them. We didn’t think anything of it. We just kickstarted our dirt bikes and headed down to the dollar store to get more soda. J and I were quieter than usual. The girls, oddly, were just as bombastic as usual.

On the way to the store, Emily and I were talking about her dad. I mentioned the car accident to her and she seemed confused. She said her dad left for work in Little Rock a few days ago. I asked if she was sure. She said she was pretty certain since the family’s van has been gone for a few days. Her mom has been stuck at home because of it.

The sheriff’s deputy was sitting at the foot of the hill just like yesterday. I only caught it briefly but his jaw was tightened. His eyes stared daggers into the bike J and Mikayla were riding on. I could have sworn I saw a bullet hole in the side of his cruiser, too. I couldn’t be sure.

The dollar store was just as empty as it always was. I still remember my heart sinking when I grabbed a newspaper. The headline across the front said, ‘\[Name redacted\] killed in tragic car accident on Sunday’.

 

We went to the arcade on Tuesday.

 

 

Mikayla doesn’t remember half of what I do. In fact, she just remembers her dad died on a business trip. I asked Emily about it years ago but she was too scared to talk about it. I wish I could ask her now, but… well it isn’t important. J seems to think I am misremembering. Mikayla says I’m just mixing events up. I don’t really know what to make of it all, really.

I can write more stories as I remember them. For now I need to get some sleep. I have to drop my kid off at her mom’s house early tomorrow so I should get some sleep. I finally got her to fall asleep a few hours ago. The damn neighbor still has his truck’s high beams on this late. It’s really getting on my nerves.
