Okay. I’m still trying to process what happened last night.
I didn’t expect to post this so soon, but something about it feels... unfinished.

So here it is.

I went to the dead feed.

I made the drive. Two hours northwest. Road was narrow, barely maintained. Trees were thick, leaning in over the gravel like they didn’t want anyone going in—or coming out. My GPS cut out near the old county line, but I had printed coordinates from an FCC relay archive. That’s how I found the access road.

I brought my old Zoom H4n field recorder with me. I used it for interviews at the station—clean audio, reliable batteries, and honestly? I’ve kept it in my car ever since WQRC shut down. Call it a habit. Or maybe paranoia. But after everything that’s happened (the tapes, the voices), I knew if something went wrong, I wanted it on record. Something physical. Not digital. Not editable.

Anyway, the site was exactly where it should have been. Unmarked. No fencing. No locks. Just a slab of moss-choked brick with one door, one window, and one rusting satellite dish.

There was a hum. Not a machine hum—deeper. Rhythmic. Faint. Like breath.

I found an old electrical panel near the back wall. The kind with round fuses and rusted screws. Inside was a single, crisp index card taped to the metal. Handwritten numbers in marker:

940170

Same as the envelope. Same as the tape. Same as the signal.

The air shifted. My ears popped. I started to feel like I was shrinking—like the woods were growing around me. My hand brushed my coat pocket and I felt the recorder—it was already on.

I hadn’t powered it up.

I pulled it out and watched as the screen flickered to life. Then it played a file.

I hadn’t recorded anything.

The voice was synthetic. Calm. But the pacing... it mimicked our traffic break cadence. In Janelle’s voice.

“Relay active. Signal confirmed.
Transmitting: Mitch Halwell, WQRC 98.7… status: unknown – presumed terminated.
Next relay pending.
Begin phase two.”

Then silence.

Then—my mother’s voice.

She passed in 2016. But there she was. Same breathy tone she used when I’d come home sick from school. Same shakiness. Like she was afraid.

She whispered:

“You shouldn’t have come here.”

That broke me. I took off. Bolted into the trees. The building vanished behind me—I swear it did. I couldn’t find it again for at least ten minutes, even retracing my steps. When I finally got back to the car, the recorder had gone cold. No power. Wouldn’t boot. I didn’t stop driving until I hit streetlights and saw other people.

A few minutes ago, I opened the recorder to check the SD card.

It was melted. Not burnt. Just fused—like it had been microwaved from the inside out.

There’s no file. There’s no proof. Just what I saw. What I heard.

Last night, when I turned the radio on, 14225 was already broadcasting.

And it was me.
My voice. Saying:

“Zero. Four. Eight. Nine. Two. Two.
Transmitting new relay.
Location confirmed.”

I don’t know what “Phase Two” is or when it could have started.
I’m in the dark just as much as you are.

If anyone is still listening at 2:37 a.m.—and if you hear anything—please tell me what you hear.

Or anything at all. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
