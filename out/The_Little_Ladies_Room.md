When I was growing up, my parents didn’t have much money. We lived in a little shack stationed on land my grandparents owned, edging the woods. As I got older I realised how much I disliked the woods. It was a difficult time for me, I was struggling to sleep, always feeling paranoid and most importantly, I felt isolated. That summer I begged my parents to go to a ‘normal’ school - and after much convincing, they complied.

The nearest school was 2 hours away, ‘Queen High’. For the first year, every morning my grandpa would make the 2 hour drive at 5:00am just to get me to school. I didn’t mind it there, for the most part everyone kept to themselves. It was quiet. Too, too quiet. One thing everyone agreed was that there was a strange feeling in the girls bathrooms. It wasn’t just the creaky doors, dim lighting, salty aroma and the gold plastered name plate on the front of the doors titled ‘The Little Ladies Room’ - it was something even weirder, the voices.

My second year at ‘Queen High’ was the most memorable, I remember that the school had just announced their new boarding school branch, which was great because I didn’t need to get my grandpa to drive me to school at 5:00am. The school also went through a lot of renovations over the summer break, they renovated everything; except ‘The Little Ladies Room’.

I still remember what happened on the 22nd of October, 1991 like it happened yesterday. I went about my morning like normal, had breakfast, had a shower, and then went with a few friends to ‘The Little Ladies Room’ to do our makeup together. That’s when it happened.

As we walked in, we saw a horrible sight, our classmate, Scarlett was dangling from the ceiling.
In 10 minutes the whole school board and police department was there. That was the start of a horrible yearly tradition, the years that followed we lost Zach, Braydon, Alicia and Rachael. The last year I was there, I had walked into the same bathroom with the same friends. The sight was all too familiar, but this time, splattered across the wall was red writing, written in blood. It said: “you will be next, Sophie.

My name is Sophie. I didn’t go back to that school the following year. I dropped out all together and took a year off before doing anything else. One day, during my year off, I was laying in bed late one night playing flappy bird on my new flip-phone. When I felt eyes, eyes looking at me. I turned around in bed to face the window, when I saw 3 beady eyes looking at me one yellow, one blue, one red. I was so scared I hid under my covers until I fell asleep, when I woke up I looked up at my roof, where there was more words in a familiar red ink saying, ‘You look familiar’ under it was another all too familiar gold plastered name plate, on it, it said: ‘The Little Ladies Room’
