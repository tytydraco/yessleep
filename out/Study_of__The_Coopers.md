This story has haunted my family for four generations.

I visited my great grandparents frequently as a small boy. My great grandfather was a tall man with the sense of humor of a teenager. We genuinely connected despite our obvious age gap. One day, my grandparents left me with him and the air was different in his house that day. He was more somber and sat and appeared almost callous in his rocking chair. 

I was young but I knew he was disturbed by something and I just had to know what. So without thinking I asked him, rather bluntly, "What's got you all upset old man?" I usually called him old man as a joke and some part of me was hoping the verbal jab would lighten the mood. 

Thankfully this did seem to pull him from whatever mental ocean he was pondering. He grinned at me and said in a rather low voice "Would you think I was crazy if I told you a ghost story?" 

This was a weird and uncharacteristic for him so I nearly stepped back. Some part of me thought that he was beginning to slip mentally even though he had never shown any other signs. "N..No? I wouldn't think you were crazy."

I wasn't actually sure if I believed this to be honest. Part of me was scared that he might do something uncharacteristic. Something about older people going insane scared me a lot as a kid I remember being freaked out by a Ben 10 episode with old people attacking the main characters. 

He smirked at me and told me this. 

"I grew up with a man named Jeremiah. He was my neighbor in the house beside this one when I was a kid. We played together when we were very young and were best friends throughout high school. I joined the military and he went to college. However when I finally came home after being stationed in Japan for 6 years we reconnected. One weekend we decided to go hunting together. We planned the trip and were packed up the night before. 

When that morning came for us to leave something in my stomach felt off. I felt nervous and I wasn't really sure why. 

The whole time driving I couldn't settle my nerves and nearly called the whole thing off thinking I had some kind of breakdown. However, I was finally able to swallow it and got us where we needed to go. 

I parked my truck and Jeremiah parked next to my truck. He mentioned he was having some kind of motion sickness on the way to our spot. I mentioned I had similar symptoms and we shrugged it off thinking maybe it was the road. 

Walking through the woods I came across a clearing I didn't remember when I originally set up the spot. The air felt light and it felt like every instinct I had told me to turn around and go home. I pushed through and about halfway through the clearing I realized I heard foot steps and breathing right behind me. The wind seemed to spiral around the clearing and my nerves finally broke and I wanted to leave. 

I told Jeremiah to step back a bit but when I looked back he wasn't there. 

I called for him for a bit and used the whistle I packed hoping he would hear it and say something or whistle back. When he didn't I ran towards where we were parked until I made it back to my truck. 

His truck was gone and I immediately got upset that he just dumped me in the woods without saying anything. 

I drove back pissed and went to his house to figure out what was going on. When I got there his parents were there. They passed the house on to him when he turned 20 and hadn't lived there in a few years. 

When I asked them about when Jeremiah would be back they looked at me shocked. Saying they never had a son named Jeremiah.  

I was very confused by this and eventually started asking everyone else. Nobody had ever heard of him. He wasn't in our yearbooks or school pictures. 

The only evidence that he every existed was the list of things we packed for the camping trip that I still have. It is worn and old now but it has his name and what he was expected to bring." 

He looked a little down trodden when he finished the story and I didn't really know what to say. I remember hugging him and hoping he wasn't losing it. 

When my grandfather picked me up to go back home, since I was raised by my grandparents, I told my grandfather I thought his dad may be starting to need more help being looked and I started to tell him the story that I was told before he cut me off. "He isn't beginning to lose it just yet. He's been telling that story with that paper in his wallet since I was a kid. He told it to your dad when he was growing up as well. I believe him. Or at least that he truly believes it."

I didn't know how to take this. Since my grandfather didn't believe in ghosts, aliens, or any cryptids. 

I still think about it sometimes since my great grandfather has passed and I still have the packing list for the hunting trip him and Jeremiah were supposed to go on."
