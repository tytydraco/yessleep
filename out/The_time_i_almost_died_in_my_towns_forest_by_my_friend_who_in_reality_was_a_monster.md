It was a dark and stormy night when me and my friends decided to play a game of truth or dare. We had been drinking and smoking all evening, and were feeling brave and adventurous. As the game went on, the dares became more and more daring. Finally, it was my turn. "Truth or dare?" my friend Jason asked, a mischievous glint in his eye. "Dare," I replied, feeling a rush of excitement and fear. "I dare you to go into the woods alone and spend the night there," Jason said, a wicked grin on his face.  


I hesitated for a moment, unsure if I should go through with it. But the group encouraged her on, and she finally relented. I grabbed a flashlight and a sleeping bag, and headed out into the woods. It was pitch black, and the only sound was the rain tapping against the trees. As I walked deeper into the woods, I began to feel a sense of unease. I felt like she was being watched, like something was lurking in the darkness. Suddenly, I saw movement out of the corner of my eye. I turned my flashlight in that direction, and saw a tall white-headed entity staring back at me, its glowing red eyes fixated on me. I screamed and ran, but the entity was too fast for me. It grabbed me by the neck and dragged her into the darkness. The next morning, My friends found my sleeping bag in the woods, torn and bloody, but I. There was no sign of me. The townspeople searched the woods for days, but they found nothing. I disappeared, gone, taken by the tall white-headed entity. The day I disappeared my friend Jason was nowhere to be found, his existence disappeared.  


Little do they know, I'm alive hiding in the woods from Jason, turns out he was the entity, I cant find my way back, not yet, he dragged me deep into the forest, deeper than anyone else went. I made a spear out of sticks, to defend myself just in case Jason came back. I tried to find my way back through the path Jason made while dragging me but it was more or less covered up by rain and dust.   
I found Jason 3 days after he dragged me into the forest, he had his guard down, i readied my spear and plunge it through his chest, bursting open his heart. He looked at me with anger and disgust and said, "You are alive....\*coughing up blood\* I tried to kill you since you forced this curse upon me...\*coughing more blood\*... I could only die by the hands of your family members and now I have, but alas ill be reincarnated... it is this town's curse... one day ill have my revenge of killing your family and drain their blood one by one... starting with you." with that he died.   


It took me 5 more days before I found the way to my town again, the townspeople were horrified at my appearance, bloodied and cut body. After a couple of days, regaining my health, my friend Laurel told me that while I was away, she had a son, she showed me him and i immediately recognized those bloodlust red eyes, the same as Jason. I congratulated her but made a mental note that when the time came I will myself have to execute her son or else.... everyone in the town would suffer.
