A quick timeline of the past couple years. 

2021- dog died (a dog they had for a couple months) 2 months after they got a new puppy this is a trend. 2 years later 2 more dogs passed within 2 weeks of eachother. Within weeks of woman complaining about them barking. 

2021- august house fire came from dryer. Woman left the drier running while she ran to the store real quick. Smoke damaged the whole house allowed woman to completely makeover the house with the money they got.  Did not pay the dog boarders even though they gave insurance money for it. Ended up being sued. (Docket number redacted for social media) A couple cats got out during the smoke damage but were found near redacted. Like someone dropped them off there as they were very far from home in no time. 


2023 3k dollars was stolen from the cornhole safe at house. The safe was pincode locked.  

Weekend of september 25th 2023 someone broke into aunts house. They only stole insulin. When neighbors were asked they saw woman crawling into her house through window. Life 360 confirmed it was woman. Aunt dropped charges as man begged her to. 

September 25-  man was taken by ambulance to pitt. He was in a coma. Low blood sugar was noted 

Around jan 21st man was arrested for assult on woman. She was caught cheating a second time. Man found out during this time woman borrowed 3k from his boss. Was never aware until he was in jail and leaving her. She said she would drop charges and talk thing through and they did. 

Febuary 12th 2024 deed was transffered into both names. Unsure about the date but also his beneficiary was changed. She also took over POA to put her name on this house. Bettering herself and abuse of POA.

March 3rd man was placed in the icu the second time. While in the icu he kept asking aunt to ask woman to tell her what she did to him and she tricked him. His bloodsugar was 18. Wednesday march 6th he passed away. 

A few days after mans death woman had a huge fire outback her house. Neighbors saw smoke. She was burning all of mans things 

March 24th at 1130 pm 3 cats all died at once in her care. Woman claimed they had marijuana smoke inhaltion. Then story changed to they drank alcohol. 

End of march- all of mans things were sold. Make over of house so only womans pictures were up. Garage was gutted and house is now hers alone. 

Is this not sketchy to anyone else? Unfortunately this stuff is not made up. No one is looking into this. No one cares. Life is going on as usual for most but not his family. This is not a horror story. This is a real life situation no one is doing anything about and i think more people need to know. I have a full timeline on my phone and redacted a lot for social media. Who can get involved? How do we get justice? Im done waiting around
