[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/d4PXeQXXET)

It took me longer to recover than I thought it would—physically, mentally, all of it. But guilt has a funny way of sharpening your focus. Sarah was gone, and I knew it was my fault. People like to think they’d never let someone suffer because of them, that they’d put themselves on the line without hesitation—but when the time comes? It’s messy. 

It’s terrifying. Sarah wasn’t coming back unless I did something, and the cops? No help there. If she disappeared without a trace, I’d be the one answering their questions—and rightly so. Still, it wasn't just about them or about clearing my name. It was about her. About what they did—or were doing—to her, piece by piece. The not knowing was the worst. But I couldn’t let that stop me. Not then. So I went back—to the pyramids, to the twins, to this whole nightmare I thought I could survive the first time around. Turns out, that was just the warm-up.

So when I got there—or at least thought I got there—I couldn’t even process what I was looking at. The twins weren’t themselves anymore. They’d turned into these massive, otherworldly forms made up of what looked like millions of glass panes, shifting and shuffling outward in impossible directions. And inside those panes, I could see things—eyes, organs, these pulsing pieces of flesh, sliding through the glass like they were alive. 

In the center, there was this spiral of pure blackness, but it wasn’t empty. Sparks of light kept flaring from somewhere deep inside, and they felt... wrong. Like they weren’t meant to exist. The closer I got, the more everything started vibrating. It wasn’t just the air or the ground—it was me. I could feel it in my bones, in my teeth, like the vibrations were trying to rip me apart. I swear, my atoms felt like they were about to scatter, like this... frequency was specifically targeting me to obliterate me piece by piece. 

I had to back away before I completely lost it, because standing there any longer felt like dying in slow motion. And that’s the best way I can explain it. That’s when I asked them why they looked different, why they weren’t in the forms I’d seen before. And they just stared—or, like, their panes stared, if that makes sense. Then these veiny, pulsing tendrils started spilling out from them, moving around me in these slow, deliberate patterns, almost like they were thinking. That’s when they told me. They didn’t ‘look different’ because they’d changed. They were showing their true forms now, and the forms I’d seen before? 

I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t move. All I could do was stand there and listen as they explained what they were, what they’d done. And then, like they were pulling thoughts straight out of my skull, they showed me. Hunter. My older brother. My hero growing up. We thought he’d just... disappeared. I thought he’d run away or maybe gotten into some kind of trouble, the kind you don’t come back from. But no. He hadn’t run away. He wasn’t in trouble. 

He’d been taken. Him and Tim—his best friend, his *everything*—they’d been dragged into something darker than I ever imagined. The flashes the twins showed me weren’t just memories—they were nightmares. I saw Hunter. I saw Tim. And the gym teacher. The way he lured them in. The way he—God, I can’t even say it. And then my dad—my *dad*—finding out, piecing it all together, and snapping. He killed the gym teacher and buried them all in a single grave in the backyard like that would somehow fix it. Like that would bury the horror. But it didn’t. The twins still found them. They found the bones, the essence, the fear, everything. And they used it. They made themselves out of it. Out of Hunter. Out of Tim. Out of something that should’ve been sacred.

 I’ll write some more later. I’m really exhausted this time—more than ever before. Whatever this is, it’s taking a toll on me. I’ve got more gray hairs than I’d like to admit, more lines on my face, and it feels like my body is aging faster than it should. Almost like someone’s sucking the soul right out of me with a straw or something. I’ll finish the rest soon, I just... need to catch my breath.

Part 4 is up, labelled wrong as part 3 in the title. New to this Reddit stuff so please forgive me. Also it goes without saying that I’ve been drinking. A lot.
