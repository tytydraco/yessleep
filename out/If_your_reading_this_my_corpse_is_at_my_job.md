I want a personal testimony that I existed. I want someone to read this and know that my body is here in a hell called a supermarket, rotting in Ireland. I’m more than corpse I’m a person.

“You’re late!”

Being stuck in a car ride with my partner questioning my future prospects is a depressing reminder of the dullness of my life. The questions of “When are going to start to drive?”, “Why don’t I leave my job? Try to find something better?” or my ‘most anticipated question’ “what’s holding you back from doing something good?”.
 I replied with kindness of “It’s grand, it’s fine. and I’m working on stuff, it’s not ready yet, okay”. 
“Look I don’t want to cause an argument her-“
“But you are!”
“Jesus! I’m tryna help you for Christ sake. You’re 22 now! That place has nothing for you it’s holding you down and you’re drowning in it. You need to take your life into your own hands.”
“Ava, I’m workin on stuff I’m doing my writing and I’m gonna…”
“Yeah…..sure”
“You know I just been bus-“
“Look I’m at my wits end okay I don’t want this to be seeing you waste your time okay. Just please find somewhere else.”
Even with her crystal blue eyes on the road she saw straight through my shit. I don’t think we could couldn’t tell if she was talking with each other, to us or at me. Pulling into the car park she sighed, looked at me with these heavy eyes of defeat. 
Getting out of the car I threw her a “love you”. She threw it back in my face, “Yeah. You too”. I wasn’t gonna fight it, I can’t afford to be late in work.


Stepping into the supermarket I worked in it was the culmination of the forced modernisation of a dilapidated building. Its original 90’s shelving and paper thing squared ceilings paired with oppressive monochromatic displays, paired with a depressing lack of more colour palette that doesn’t bleed a bright ungodly yellow. Its flooring was always something that made me hate its fake marble to fake grey wood panelling. It was nothing more than a dated relic with a few shiny new additions. Much like its employees.   
   
 “You’re late!” 

The great words I got to hear as my fingers pressed down on the clocking machine. The words coming from the shrivelled voice Janeen. The women’s whose commutation in life was the what ifs she ever thought of. “We need you to stack the preserved goods. Can you do that for us?”. Looking at me with a cup full of cheap store brand coffee mix. For a woman in such a high position she just away with the fairy’s sometimes. Just kinda ditsy. I just nodded keeping my head down and doing my job, no point arguing.

Going to stack cans of baked beans and jars of persevered fish really gives a sense of peace everything has a place, an order.
“How’s it going down there Boss?” The voice of one of the many people I loathe in this hell Johno. For a man a year older than myself he look twice my senior. 
“Fine.” I replied with, eyes following my hands placing each tin of baked beans.
“I need you to work the checkouts after you get this done okay?” Asking me to go to checkouts as a sad excuse to as he sees got flirt with some of the girls on the tills. Well flirting is a strong word, more like a violation of the Human Resources hand book.
“But I’m working the floor today!” Moving my eyes away from the tins to look his sagging eyes.   What followed was a tirade of mockery, to anger to eventual sulking with a brooding cloud over us. Granted Johno’s temper was like the poor attempt of hair on his head, thinning and barely even there. I ended up agreeing. I don’t want confrontation, I wanted this day to be over. While I was at the end of the isle moving from cans to glassed oddities my hands slipped. 


Knocking a glass jar of wild salmon encased in olive oil. The jar falling and cracking open letting its mildly gone off smell escape its tiny crevasses. Grabbing the jar was a nothing more than a disaster in place. The pressure of my fingers pressing into the unstable glass cause its cracks to fall through. The noxious salmon pieces, each streaked with red dotted blood marks oozing out of the cracks. It’s shards finding comfort in my palm. It digs deep into my skin. It was painful but I cleaned the floor of its oily mess as customers pass by. The job comes first. 

A mother pushing her young child on a trolley approached. The mother swerving  it around the yellowed fish splat. One hand on the trolley driving, the other shovelling a chicken fillet roll into her mouth. Her roll filled with breaded fillet diced up, with a mountain of shredded cheese on it. She evaporated each eaten piece with little to no respite. Each crumb landing on her tiny son’s head. The boys tiny chubby legs poking out of the trolly kicking away. God it’s putrid to watch. I was fortunate I was only in for four hours, saves me the torture of interacting with any more of these feral beasts in undersized clothing.


I bandaged my hand and continued to work the shop floor, then the tills. You get used to the complaints they give, the 
“Why isn’t this priced this way?”
“Ya bleedin kiddin me why ya not charging me dah price?”
“For fuck sake will ya just give me your discount!”
To tell you I was overjoyed to clock out was more than an understatement. Granted I would be dealing with the anxieties of my life but at least I could relax in my own bed and give my hand a proper cleaning. Clocking out and turning to face freedom it’s beautiful.

“You’re late!”

“What? Janeen I’m done now.”
“We need you to stack the preserved goods. Can you do that for us?”
She is ditsy like that so I gave it a pass. Age isn’t good to her. But leaving the front doors of this supermarket I’m face to face with the clock in machine. 
“You’re late! We need you to stack the preserved goods. Can you do that for us?”
I walked down to the door pushing straight past Johno. 
“How’s it going down there Boss?”
I ran to the door waiting for the doors to open up for me. Each inch it opened up by going at an agonising speed. But going through I was back facing that machine and hearing that voice.

“You’re late!“.

I tried each time to run out the door time after time. Each stride feeling less powerful than the last. Each time running to the door barrelling out of it i end up falling out on to that machine. 

“You’re late!”

I couldn’t say how many times I attempted to leave from windows. 

“You’re late!”

To side entrances to even.

“You’re late!”

Fire exits. 

“You’re late!” 

I ended up in square one. Back to nothing. Do you know when you put a clear cup over a spider cause you want to trap, it’s how I felt. I could see the outside as I ran out but I was back. I felt like those pieces of salmon just stuck.  I screamed, I shouted and I shook people but they only looked at me. They didn’t change anything just looked in confusion of a member of staff having a manic episode.  But God after doing it so much I just saw the routine these people where in the same position the same actions. I was in a glorified manakin store. Christ I was alone. I think after a while I gave up on trying to force my way out. It seemed pointless. I just ended up doing my job again, the only thing I can do.

“You’re late!”


I’ll be honest I thought I could do so much unique stuff with life. When I was younger I wanted to be a comic artist or a writer. I liked imagining my life in the leagues of the great. Hell when I started this job I talked about on different ideas of books, characters and interesting tidbits. That’s what Ava liked about me when we first met in class. We loved talking about literature from contemporary to speculative. We love to talk shop on ideas of how we could be the best Sally Rooney, Oscar Wilde or Sarah Kane. But work happened staff didn’t care what I wanted to talk about more eager to talk about a night out that would end in a shared 12 pack in someone’s dingy room. My passion for talking about words and typography were soon replaced with disgruntled customers and shitty workers. Johno always shut down any talk of books he said it was “gay talk”. I wanted to leave and find somewhere better but I got comfortable here. I got comfortable in stocking shelves and serving customers. I hate it but it’s what I know. Ava knew that. She needed me out of it but I stayed with it. Now I’m stuck here. All alone here.

“You’re late!”

 
Time passes differently here I never really noticed it. I’m not hungry or need a bathroom but it’s just the same day repeated but it’s off. I wander around the store doing menial tasks trying to work out a plan but i realised somethings. The smell. The fruit and vegetables were rotting. The bananas had gone from a bright yellow to a mushy brown. The whicker baskets which held them it’s seeped out pouring onto the floor slowly. Dripping down. The fruits where nothing more than pieces of slugs he holding onto the semblance of the shape it once was. But the customers didn’t seem to notice they took them and put them in their trolleys like they always did. There was one elderly woman. Grey long overcoat, a black trolley bag with her granny headscarf silver locks of hair peering out. She took an apple, she would normally have had to force her dentures into the apple to get a bite. Her teeth sliced through and you could hear the “comp” from her teeth. The rotten juices flowing down the sides of her lips and she eat with a smile. The food was rotting and the smell was only getting worse. It stunk and it lingered. But no one noticed everyone carried on like this was life. Yet I’m stuck.

“You’r late!”

At first I tried using sell by dates as timer marker.  It worked well for a while till there more live than dead things on dead in the fridges. Maggots dancing in the remains of tightly packaged black pudding. Its presence so known the flies buzzs replaced the fly zappers hmms. While at first it was parked was using my cut on my hand as a bit of a marker of how long things have been going on for. The cut had been healing over time but I knew I knew I wouldn’t last it was soon going to be gone. I knew if I went to the til and slammed my hand in the cash register the mark can just give me a good enough time to know how much time is progressing. From what I worked out it’s just the four hours looping over and over. I spent many attempts doing all my tasks thinking it would appease some being watching and trapping me. But I don’t think there is anyone watching. Hoping, actually more rather praying that God isn’t watching me. It would make me feel that bit better knowing that my suffrage wasn’t a test of faith and commitment. If it is I’m failing.

“You’re late!”

The point where you notice all the floors going from a salmon pink tile to a brown sludge it hurts. Not just emotionally but physically. The smell of rot creeping into your nose. The mold on the shelf’s of bread causing a continuous coughing. The stench so horrendous from even the canned goods it just makes your eyes water. 
The melding of foods on the shelf’s only divided by the packaging it try’s to escape from. It was slow but it covered everything. It spread on the tills. The office like panelled ceiling, the corny product displays of corporate mascots welcoming you to try a product. Everyone just continues. On a set time and schedule. Every word the same with no alternation not course of change. It’s stagnant like nose pinching smell of this place.

“You’re late!”

The way everyone just walk, talk  and act. Its horrific. Only bright side is that Johno’s poor attempt of a comb over has fallen off. But the rest. The woman with the chicken fillet roll. She continues to eat her roll with no caution to her chews. Each bite in the mold covered baguette getting faster than the last. She once cheese shreds a bright orange not a spotted blue and green. The chicken it dances with maggots. Her teeth yellow filled with more plaque than tooth. She doesn’t care but and eats away at the rock solid bread roll. I wonder if she could notice the taste. The lack of a zest from its seasoning if there even is anything left. But her hair it was in a pony tail but now it is all matted. Clumps on top of clumps. Worst part I don’t feel bad for her it’s her child in the trolley. I don’t know how long it’s been but the child. The once tiny feet sticking out of the trolley now grown to fit it. The child’s legs were bulging and grown from the prison wiring of the trolley. Legs where the blood was cutting off its supply, both a mixture of dark blue and red. The child’s clothes where grown into the them fat folding over its wear with sores and rashes to match. The little tiger on the child’s clothes with its big happy smile once laid. Now lost to grease, sweat and the residue of what ever food that child once smashed in their face. I think a child is wrong to say it was more like a teen with teeth all scattered all over the place. At least my future isn’t the only ones who’s gone. 

“You’re late!”

After some time you learn to forget your appearance. I was always one who would often to forget the morning off leaving a bristly stubble. Ava always complained I didn’t book my hair in enough to be cut. Work really complicates tryna organise stuff. I prioritised work over some friends before. Lost a few dates to it as well. I dedicated my time working I focused on it. I need bills to pay and hell a bit of money in my back pocket doesn’t hurt. I wanna be independent. I haven’t looked at myself in the mirror for a while now. The bathrooms had a now green tint to it’s once blue tiling. The mirror was caked in dirt. Probably years of it being built up. God years. I have been stuck here years trying to leave in vein. I finally saw myself properly. Baggy eyes. Clumped up matted greasy hair and a beard that looked like untamed waves of the ocean at night. I don’t think I know who I’m looking at anymore. I don’t think I am me. I barely remember anything. I barely remember Ava. I miss the look of her brown eyes, or were they green. I know the form of her face but the features are long but gone to me. I’m only left with the idea of her. I’m wish I cou-

“You’re late!”

And I lost it. I punched Janeen in the face. Knocking her down. The once hot coffee all those years ago now cold falling all over her. I started beating her face in. I couldn’t stand her words. I couldn’t stand that voice. I didn’t want my life stolen from me and now it’s gone. I kept on beating her face over and over. I went to get the lid of the toilet tank knowing that I wanted her shrilled up voice gone. I smashed it over and over again into what once was her face. Her dated librarian glasses were more than just crushed under the weight. I kept on doing it even after every twitch and inch her corpse made I kept going.  Her head was more of a “u” shaped now. I don’t remember how long I kept smashing it into it but my hands were bloody after it was done. I couldn’t tell if it was mine or it’s. I cried for a while. I tried apologising but a corpse isn’t very talkative. Maybe it was a silent treatment. I wish it was all silent. Even God is silent to me.

When I inevitably faced that clock-in machine I heard nothing. I heard a dim buzz off the fluorescent lights I thought I found my out. I felt something I could hold on to as a way out that maybe me doing something as bad as that would set me free. I felt a clod splat on my hand.

“Yyyyyy….ooooohu’reeee l…l…ate!” 

The mangled caved in head of Janeen spilt wide open. Standing up and proud with her coffee in her hand. Spitting blood out of her mouth as she tried to speak. Her head moved in force with every syllable spoken. Her cold, sticky, copper smelling blood going everywhere. Taking a sip from her coffee only for it to poor straight onto the floor as her jaw stuck ajar. She continued as normal. Her body just adjusted to her new movements of her head erratic and all over the place.


Ava was right in me needing to resign from this place. She was right on a lot of things. I wanted to but fuck at my tails end with a life bound to store decaying and undying. I should have just left and done something. I should have taken back my life. I should have written more. I wanted to. I need to. This place has taken so much from me. I could have been the next Sally Rooney, or the next Sarah Kane. But all I’m gonna be is lost to time. I wish I could have said I’m sorry a thousand time to her. I know I can’t take anything back now. But I am taking what little I have left here. I don’t care as long as I don’t need to see this place again I’m going to take my life in my own hands. I’m probably not gonna see tomorrow or today again after I do it. But at least it’s my choice. I want to be more than a person I want to be a writer but it’s not gonna happen. I’m taking charge for just once I’ll be the one in control. I just hope my name can be remembered at least that I existed. I don’t care if it’s on a subreddit or anything I just want it to be quite right now. I want something back.
