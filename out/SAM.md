Found on the hard drive of a laptop found at the scene, along with a broken mobile phone. Recovered under black sand determined to be made mainly of graphite and clumps of rubber. Written on Notes app. Posts are as follows:

Some of the weirdest shit just happened, and I don’t know where else to turn. I don’t really know where to start, to make things worse. This is my first post, I believe, so I apologize if it’s slightly illegible. I am not a poet, and what happened has me pretty fucking rattled.

Have you ever had a day where, with no real reason whatsoever, things seemed to go against you at every instance? You wake up to cat piss in your bed and you don’t own a cat; you forgot to empty the old coffee grounds in the coffee machine after putting in a massive layer of new grounds on top and breaking the coffee machine inexplicably; your car’s battery dies midway out of you pulling out of your driveway and you’re basically emergency parked in the middle of the busy street and the tow company is stuck in traffic caused by your unfortunate park job; the coffee place you went to accidentally gave you a small cup of coffee with spoiled milk and you didn’t know until you left the building and got back into your rental car that you were nearly denied had it not been for the sweet soul of the front desk person who smudged some rules to give me a fair deal; despite knowing how terrible your day started, your boss still rips you a new one for being late which led to a meeting with HR and facing a real possibility that you wouldn’t have a job if anything happened again; your card declines at a luncheon and you have to settle for some free fruits (two apples, an orange, and a banana,) and a couple of spare granola bars that your coworker was kind enough to spare… there’s more, but I’ve listed so many already.

This all sounds like a nightmare for some folks, but this was my morning. I wish I could say the rest of the day was just mildly frustrating if not downright infuriating, but after I somehow managed to convince my boss to leave early, I got home to someone tagging my parking spot in the garage with the weirdest sprawling lines I’ve ever seen. I did try to take pictures of the lines, but my phone’s rear camera broke when it fell out of my pocket during lunch and the front has a weird glare in the lens that just appeared. I wish that was the worst of the tagging, but the scribbling lines almost seemed to lead into the building straight to my apartment. Hell, there were lines in the damn elevator that lined up. It was like lines on a kid’s drawing, almost like a fake pirate’s map that doesn’t have a set location of the treasure. The lines that almost didn’t lead directly to my door were violently scrawled over, like it was wrong. My damn door was covered in those lines, too, but more like a circle surrounded by very small question marks surrounding the door frame well beyond the neighbors’ doors and on the ceiling. I freaked out so much I called the cops and the front desk about everything. They tried pulling footage of the garage and the hallways, but the cameras must’ve been broken. The officers, Wilson and Singh, told me they’d look in my apartment for anything and that I did the right thing by not going inside and calling them first. They set me up with a hotel room in the meantime.

Jesus I’m tired. It’s not even that late in the day. What the cops said about me doing the right thing… it feels off for some reason and I can’t for the life of me figure out why. Maybe once they give me an update, I’ll ask them to clarify, if they can. If that weird shit was involved in a whole ass other crime (or worse), what the fuck does that mean for me? I’m getting anxious just thinking about the possibilities. I’ve told the front desk not to forward calls to me or to send anything to my door per Officer Wilson’s orders. I’m exhausted, but I don’t know if I can sleep. I guess I can try. What else can I do?

Shit got weirder.

It’s been a week since the graffiti shit happened. I’m still at the hotel. Officer Singh dropped by the day after everything happened to let me know that the room is still being thoroughly investigated, but what they found was… God, it’s weird to type out. It was like the room was turned into a drawing. The walls were slanted at weird angles, the appliances were vastly out of proportion to each other and the surfaces they were on, but the stuff with the lights? Holy shit. Any room with a light on had those little lines of rays that kids draw to show light, but when the lights turn off, the fucking lines disappear. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK. If it wasn’t for the bodycam footage, I wouldn’t have believed it either. It sounds whacked.

I’m fucking wreaked. I managed to get HR to approve my time off for “emergency mental health reasons”. I can’t work with this shit running in the background of my mind and act like everything’s gonna be fine. I barely have a proper grip on reality right now. Weed doesn’t help, and the bar downstairs (while being super sweet about it and I do absolutely understand and get the reason why) isn’t allowed to send me any more alcohol. I guess I drank a dent in their inventory and I was costing them a pretty penny in reordering supplies. Whoops. Thank you, Doordash and Instacart.

The apartment complex has fully dropped my lease, no fee, nothing. The head maintenance guy went with the cops the first time into that place. He quit right after. I’m looking into getting a new place soon-ish, but given that my belongings are not physically possible to exist, furniture and clothes are a luxury at the moment.

My music app has been acting up as well. It stops playing my music for like 20 seconds, then I hear something like humming, only I don’t know the song. Swear to G if my life is a real-life fucking creepypasta.

Upside, got my car back. I guess it just needed a new battery. I need to eat, I’m too hungry to think.

May 26



I got my phone replaced yesterday. I guess I had some malware installed without knowing it and my entire phone just… broke. None of the apps worked, few actually opened. Stupid thing had some bizarre “game” on it that I didn’t really know how to play, but it played that same song like the humming from the music app. How have things gotten so weird? I’m done with all this. Please, God, I’m so tired.

Well fuck.

My car is basically internally totaled and the mechanics don’t know how or why. From what they’ev told me, it just “stopped working”, and popping the hood only confused them more. It was like everything was made of plastic, like a Barbie doll car or an RC car. Same engineering design of the inside, but fake. As if it was just for display.

So on top of getting a new apartment, I now need a new car. Fuck me running.

To make things worse, that stupid game is back on my phone. I swear I can hear the humming in my sleep sometimes. It’s almost haunting. I’m so tired.



\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Jun 8



I finally figured out that “game”, sorta. Like it gave me a choice. Damn thing opens on its own, sometimes. I would just close the game and turn my phone off but curiosity and dead cats, and all that jazz.

I was right, it’s not really a game per se, but a graphic novel of sorts… if a child made one. Like a choose-your-own-adventure graphic novel made by kids, for kids, so no real story to follow at all. From what I’ve gathered, the main character is a little girl, and she has an imaginary friend named SAM or something like that. As the little girl, you control your imaginary friend via benign prompts like “pick doll up” and “dance silly”. Kid shit, y’know? Like kid games should be, but with worse graphics and designs. The little girl is a stick figure drawing with red pigtails and a green dress with yellow and blue flowers on it, and SAM… didn’t look like how I expected him to look. He was short and bulky, like a cardboard box filled with too much stuff that bent the sides out, wearing a white shirt with SAM in bold black letters. His legs were like twigs, skinny and tall, and a comically wide stance covered in weird blue pants that disappeared under the shirt and big black shoes. His arms were similar, but long, longer than they should be, and were bent at sharp angles, ending with what looked like those hook claws from arcade games, but his face… It was wider on one side, but longer on the other. His mouth was almost star shaped, warping to the shape of the face and filled with pin needle teeth. The eyes were somehow worse. One eye was large and cloudy blue– cataracts? Maybe. The other eye was small but wide and extended over one corner of his mouth over the longer side of the face with a black dot serving as a pupil. For some reason it was obvious the smaller eye wasn’t useful in any way, and the blue eye always seemed like it was looking at me the few times the app opened.

I did manage to find a cheap-ish apartment right next to the subway and bus lines. At least I don’t have to worry about how I’m getting to work if I get the place. Silver linings and all that.

I GOT THE PLACE!!!! I move in next week! Oh thank Christmas. I never wanna stay at another hotel for a long fucking time.

Mom set up a storage unit for me in town and stuffed it to the brim with furniture from Ikea that she had Dad, Linette, and Marcus fix up for me. Marcus also said he and Mom can help me out with getting a car while Dad and Linette worked on getting me clothes and knick knacks to make my new place feel homey.

The police haven’t really updated me about my old place since Officer Singh told me about what they found last time and I can’t build up the courage to ask. Mainly because I wouldn’t know how to ask, and I’d rather not really know.

That damn app still opens itself up from time to time, but only if I’m alone, and only when I’m using my phone. Only this last time was disturbing as fuck.

App opened up like usual, but something about the main screen was off. SAM still looks creepy, but the little girl has gone from smiling to a weirdly neutral face, and her dress went from a cute little green dress to a black dress and a big black hat. They’re standing next to a big brown mound on the scribbled grass flooring, almost like a grave. The game prompted something along the lines of, “she isn’t here anymore” with the choices being “cry” or “laugh”.

I closed the app after that. So far it hasn’t opened back up yet.



\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

My fucking storage unit got tagged.

Same scribbled lines. Same question marks surrounding my unit. Same drawing furniture.

How. The fuck. Is this happening.

My folks are beyond confused. Rightly so. My step-parents are talking to the cops out front.

I don’t know what to do.

Hotel, here I come.

The goddamn game cha



–EDIT: On laptop, finishing post now–

The goddamn game changed.

The little girl was lying down, crying. Same little black dress, the hat drawn flung off to the side. Sam was center of the screen. He wasn’t smiling anymore.

The prompt on screen asked, “Where’s Mommy?”

The only answer I was prompted to give was, “find her”

I closed the game and threw my phone in the closet.



\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Jul 2



I got a laptop. I managed to save my previous notes from my phone on it and update the one I started after the game opened up. I pray I don’t find that fucking game again. I haven’t touched my phone since I threw it in the closet. Here’s hoping the damn thing died.

My stuff is still cartoon-ized. Again. I don’t know how they cleared out the storage unit. Don’t know, don’t wanna know.

Sort of.

I called the police and asked about my case file, which transferred me to a detective named MacKenzie, I think. She told me the officers in charge of my case were dismissed for erratic, nearly violent behaviors following the weird discovery. She reminded me that all this was still under investigation, but she might have a lead.

Det. MacKenzie told me about another case similar to my case, where a woman’s house was marked up and “vandalised”, she called it, and the woman went insane, saying things like “she’s coming for me, I wasn’t paying enough attention, I didn’t love her enough”, creepy stuff like that. It was three weeks of constant calls about her screaming down the street and getting at least three arrests to finally get her into the psych ward. Apparently she calmed down in the psyche ward, but kept up the muttering of someone finding her.

The detective took a minute to tell me this next part, and I nearly threw up.

It was another week until they found her body in pieces, covered in clumps of “black sand and a dark pink rubber material”, but the pieces looked like they were “erased”, since no more parts of her could be found. She had her phone on her, and it looked like it exploded from the inside. Like someone smashed a window from the inside of the house.

I still haven’t gotten my phone out of the closet. I don’t want to anymore.



\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Detective MacKenzie came over today. I never realized that we were close in age, all of our talks have been over the phone. She brought over files from similar cases that ended in the same bizarre way. Some were from different states, and two were in different countries. I almost asked why she brought over all this, but the frazzled look on her face shut me up. Something tells me something happened to her, too. Not sure what, I wasn’t gonna ask. She went almost in circles about how everything nearly ended the same, every victim in pieces, missing the parts that were “erased”. Like a drawing.

Then she pulled out her phone.

She was playing the game. SAM wasn’t smiling. He was crying. The little girl was gone.

Then I saw the prompt.

“Find her”



\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Jul 22



I finally got the courage to grab my phone out of the closet. If it was dead, I didn’t check. I kept it face down and plugged it in, then looked over the files Det MacKenzie left. What I’ve gathered is that all 16 of the victims were women, all in their mid-30s, all with variations of strawberry blonde to bright red hair. At least four of the six victims had dyed hair, pitch black, like it made a difference.

How did I even get into this mess? Fuck, I don’t know what to do. I have to look at my phone eventually. Maybe something changed.

SAM is alone. Crying. And pointing to the right, toward the window.

I shouldn’t have checked.

There’s a woman out there, wiry bright red pigtails... I thought her dress was black but it’s just covered in black sand, turning it gray.

She’s crying. Wailing. There was something in her hand.

I need to leave. Now.



\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Jul 28



Detective MacKenzie’s dead. Same way. I need to go.

She can’t find me right now. I don’t know how, but she can’t see me. I have to find a way to get around her. I can’t die like this.



\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Aug 3



I finally left the hotel. Had to. She was close to finding me. I couldn’t stay there. First thing I wanted to do was fly somewhere not here, but I read the damn files. I’m still being hunted. What the fuck did I do? What DO I do? I’m scared shitless, but I can’t run for long.

Who am I supposed to find?

SAM only cries if she’s nearby. He doesn’t prompt me for anything, just stares back, the eerily wide smile gone. Maybe he can hear me? I must be going insane. I’ll try to get set up at another hotel. I’m in dire need of a shower. I’ve been driving for hours. I need to stop. Just for now. I need a breather.



\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Aug 4



He can hear me.

He answers in prompts. Prompts I can only verbally respond to. My first question was if he could, in fact, hear me.

YES, I CAN HEAR YOU. In big, bold, sprawled letters on the screen. I asked who I had to find.

HER.

Why?

MOMMY LEFT US. WE WANT HER BACK. FIND HER.

Who is we?

BETTY. SHE ISN’T HERE NOW. SHE WANTS MOMMY BACK REALLY BAD. FIND HER.

How the hell am I supposed to respond to that? I asked instead if he knew Mommy’s name. It was really the only other thing I could think of. SAM’s mouth somehow twisted more.

THAT WASN’T MOMMY. SHE WAS A LIAR. WE WANT MOMMY. NOT HELEN. WHERE IS MOMMY?

Ok so I have a start. I gotta get my laptop, I need to look up these names. Nothing is making sense anymore.

The names that came up led to some weird article about a woman named Helen Jeffers who stole a baby from a hospital in buttfuck nowhere New Jersey in the mid-to-late 90’s. She was some sort of fucked up in the head, according to the article, but about eight years later, a woman’s body was found in pieces in her home after a wellness check from Helen’s estranged husband (who was not named, I guess for anonymity). Same small pieces, same black sand that was tested as a graphite and eraser rubber mix. The little girl was never found.

Fuck.

Fuck fuck fuck.

SAM is crying. I need to go.



\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Aug 8



SAM stopped crying finally. Four days of driving nonstop except to sleep and get food and gas. I look insane. I feel insane. A drawing on my phone is helping me survive. Sort of. I’ve asked him more questions since, but it’s like asking a 6 year old child about advanced algebra. I have to be careful about how I ask my questions. SAM isn’t good with complicated questions. He doesn’t really answer in anything longer than a couple sentences. Mostly it’s been small tidbits of random word bile for a bit, stuff like SHE WANTS MOMMY BACK and FIND HER, but I did learn that Betty found out about her birth mom when Helen let slip that she wasn’t her mommy, and that something happened right after. I didn’t ask for more info. I had a feeling I knew where that line of questioning would go.

Betty’s getting closer. SAM’s giant blue eye has that weird cartoon glint on it. I need to leave here, too. Soon. I can’t stop for a while yet.



\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Aug 12



Jesus Christ, I think I know where Mommy is.

Now I have to make sure Betty can’t find me, not yet. SAM isn’t crying yet so I might have a chance.

I’m gonna ask him about the dirt mound in the background of the drawing.
