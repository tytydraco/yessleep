My grandmother, when I was five, gifted me her old diary, this leather-bound *thing* of aliens and youkai and impossible people doing impossible things, all somehow hidden from the common eye. Then I’d start questioning whether the teacher had blinked the past few minutes, whether the shopkeeper had moved and fidgeted at all before I entered his shop.

This would be paranoia, I know, but my best friends are respectively a sociopathic android heiress who plays with knives and a multireligious exorcist who shaved herself bald. Not to mention all the ghosts and parahumans that operate around the city.

 

In other words… “So why, exactly, are we-”

“For the last time, my dear,” our club leader put his face to mine, “we are exploring the manor because it is *there*. Its existence alone is its purpose.” Is that a card sticking out his shirt pocket?

“So is Pripyat.” Allie has been fidgeting with that scalpel for the past two minutes.

I rose my voice. “Pripyat isn’t *that* dangerous these days-”

“Shut up. Pripyat is *boring*! It is well documented, the causes of death in Pripyat, it’s either radiation or patrol squads. But the supernatural! The great unknown!  It is that that scares us, and that that inspires us.”

The car kept driving.

 

“In that regard, *child abuse* would be exciting. I still fail to understand why anyone would mutilate their own flesh and blood, produce a being that will never function properly for society. Would it not be easier to buy a punching bag?”

I should be used to it, having known her for a decade. “Children are not *beings* measured by their contribution to society, Allison.” I couldn’t.

“Tell yourself that when the waiter mistakes your order,” she turned her head.

I point out that *I*, personally, would try to empathize.

“You’ve known me long enough- of course you would.”

 

“... well Akemi! You’ll keep us safe, right?”

The poor lass huddled at the window slowly stretched out. “Mother only let me bring a few paper talismans-”

Somehow he was angered. “Incompetent *brat*. Incompetent *family* cannot believe in protecting the lives of a few poor kids, isn’t it? Didn’t I say to bring at *least* a few melee weapons with you? But noooo, of course that stupid woman-”

“Don’t call my-”

“THERE WILL BE GHOSTS THERE. VENGEFUL SPIRITS. Did you not try, even in the slightest-”

I shout at him to stop. He didn’t even acknowledge my existence.

“Paper talismen! The *nerve*! What are you going to do, give the ghost *papercuts*?”

 

Silence. “Come on, answer me.”

Silence.

 

“Are you not a purveyor of the supernatural, Julian.”

And that is how I finally noticed that Allie had a scalpel aimed directly at his head. Glaring other blades at me, she put it down.

That, at least, shut him up.

**I only wanted perfect attendance credit.**

“I should not have put down my blade. Threats are to be followed on, or they see it as hot air. I should have embedded the thing in the seat next to him. Dear god, I *am* going soft.”

I turn to look at her. “Isn’t this a good thing? Less lawsuits. Less attempts at blackmail. Less people unable to sleep at night, fearing your silhouette.”

“But they did deserve it.”

 

So I look out the window, trying to admire the view. Some analytic part of my brain can appreciate the beauty of mountain forestry; most of it is panicking, screaming.

It’s only an abandoned, burnt out, likely haunted manor with tales of painful demises surrounding it. If it killed *everyone* it met, how did these tales ever come into existence? Likely there is nothing there and we’d just get lost and die of starvation- no, wait, I’d rather there *are* ghosts then.

Who even lived on that hill, anyway? What madperson locks their family high in the trees? How do they get groceries? What if there was a medical emergency?

 

“You can always hide behind me, you know.”

I get whiplash from whipping my head.

 

“If I get shot in the head, it would give my mechanics a big headache. If *you* get shot in the head, I get to sit through several tedious hours of your funeral, listening to your parents wailing and eulogies, then somehow find it in me to be *sad* when delivering my own. Why are you-”

I wipe tears off my eyes, meet hers. “Yep, you’re growing soft.”

She looked annoyed. 

“ wait, no, i- ” I stretch out my arms to- wait, are you supposed to hug friends? We’ve known each other almost since birth, but isn’t hugging a bit… intimate- wait, why am I having this sort of train of thought?

She sighed.

I settle for a thumbs up. 

 

Well, I can see the tip of the manor from here. Seems that part of the roof has ceased to exist- why hasn’t anyone torn down the place yet?

Eh, as well check on Akemi.

—

Now, I *have* seen Akemi’s talismans and *ofuda* before. Rough yellow paper with flying, artistic, illegible red script for the former; smooth white paper with clear, flowing, almost typed Japanese kanji for the latter. Either set them alight or somehow *throw* them, both can nail targets from a mile away.

What I *haven’t* seen was this… card…thing, covered with enough script to almost be darkened in the center, physically radiating power, looking as sensitive as a landmine.

She seemed to notice my staring. “I was indulging myself in a shmup, had to bomb. Hey, I’m playing as an exorcist with a hat. *I’m* an exorcist with a hat. Wouldn’t it be nice if my family and I had a fallback? Just in case? So a couple of days later, and *voila*!”

“... what.”

“But now that I think about it… I didn’t really need this, did I? This would be overkill against anything less than some thousand-year-youkai.”

So what in Christ was the point then. “So you’d just… leave *this* here. In a hot car.”

She brushed off my concerns, noting that the car won’t be *that* hot in a *forest*, and besides the thing only worked by incantation anyway.

 

Eh, as well go catch some Zs.
