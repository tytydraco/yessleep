All right, I get it. I know what you're thinking: there's MORE to this psychotic bullshit?! Well, it's not like I'm complaining. But feel free to take a rain check if you're super doubtful.

__(Viewer count: uh)__

Fuck. Oh well. I still need to get this off my chest.

Anthony's Trades, 'Tiques and Thrift is still where I am, and I've been promoted to supervisor. To be fair, I'm not so certain we ever really needed one, because everyone was well behaved, Anthony the owner was around a healthy amount, and everyone seemed very content with this job.

Oh well. Looks can be deceiving, because Shanika was in college, and she took time off a month ago to begin her first semester, which requires in-person classes. She's only around on weekends these days. Logan's still around full time, and I'm guessing he's enjoying the high pay just like I am, and sees no need to ruin the simple, happy life he's found for himself.

Mine is happy. Simple? Eh. Easy to say, but holy fuck. Let's catch things up a bit.

Anthea----do you remember her? That shaky young woman from last time, who came in with that asshole sounding guy I felt like I wanted to gut like a Christmas turkey at first sight for being the obvious abuser?

Well, Cyril, that bitch, was the full kit and kaboodle. I made sure. I became Anthea's friend. And then closer. I got her to talk. Open up.

Get a job here with me. Now I'm in charge of her.

And as far as she knows, Cyril just stopped calling her one day. Stopped bothering her. What's that, the news says he's missing? Weird...I dunno, Anthea, but you really can't trust guys like that to be too reliable, can you? Ooh, damn, he was a crack addict too, you say? Probably got into some bad drug deal and...well, maybe some dark alleyway at night is the perfect setting for retribution for non-payment of long-owed debt to some providing gang hiding in the underground, and certainly not for being a woman-beating piece of shit whom a young woman with few long-term prospects, little stress in life, and a love of both blunt and sharp objects would like to "accidentally" run into after finding out his usual work schedule.

I don't exactly have chloroform on me, but pepper spray to subdue, a grain sack to shove over his head, and having a pair of very strong hands to squeeze the consciousness out of him was a good substitute.

Not MY hands, though.

I love my girlfriend. She's the one who started me on the path of ultimate good. She saved me from my ex boyfriend Donald, and as far as the world is concerned, he's history.

Cyril woke up in an abandoned quarry tied up on a big rock. He loved beating Anthea, making up any reason to get fake-angry at her and punish her. Well, someone who loves beating must LOVE big rocks. You know, those kind that are about the size of footballs, small enough to hold without losing your grip, big enough to crush a skull with after several wild blows from a bloodthirsty woman. I was panting and giggling like mad, and his screams stopped pretty quickly.

Alice cleaned up the bloody mess out of sight while I burned Cyril's body and clothes into nothing. The rainstorm that came up that night probably took care of anything that might have remained; of course, Alice might have slipped out at some point and gotten rid of any scraps she found as well.

Then there was Anthea to tend to. She was covered in bruises all over from her most recent beating. It took a lot for me to earn her trust enough to show me, and even more for her to let me doctor all of the worse, more recent wounds.

That night, with her at my apartment, finally breaking down the barrier enough to trust me with all those disinfectants and clean sponges, while sitting trembling in a bathtub full of soothing warm water, was probably the night we became as close as sisters.

It ended with her dry and freshly bandaged up, us hugging, and she cried harder than I'd thought she had in her.

But that was a couple months ago.

Nowadays, Alice works with me in the store the same as always. Of course, she isn't officially recognized as an employee, but she obviously is----she models clothes in the clothes department.

Now it's nearly September, and the fall fashions here are a bit OLD-fashioned, but seeing her wear these beautiful mixes of orange, red and brown that somehow don't clash on her at all, is always rewarding.

Her job is tough, of course----she has to stand the WHOLE TIME. Can you imagine how difficult that is?

I smiled at her as I gently draped an orange-and-brown scarf over the collar of her light red jacket. Her ponytail was gone nowadays, her hair hanging down long and straight, and the light tan sun hat didn't ruin the look.

Anthea was at the register checking out a customer. Logan was hanging up some decorative photos in a far corner of the store. I glanced around to make sure nobody was around to see me.

Then gave Alice a quick peck on the lips. She's got to know she's appreciated.

As the supervisor, I'm usually the last one in on weekdays. I don't mind; the raise that came with the position wasn't even necessary, but I sure wasn't complaining, and you couldn't pull me away from Anthony's store for anything. With me helping run the place, he didn't feel the need to be around as much, but he was always there in a pinch.

It's too bad I can't...you know...really *tell* him, or anyone really, about Alice. Even Anthea doesn't know. But maybe someday.

That day is not today.

Closing time came. The sun was setting. Anthea had clocked out just a half hour ago, and I was ready to leave.

I'd set up a bed for Alice on the bench in the back of the store where the lockers are in the employee hall. I've told the others it's just for whenever I might have a late night and decide to stick around. It crushes me a little to lie, especially because they're sympathetic and think I'm working too hard.

Maybe I am. This isn't my only job.

I laid Alice down gently on the cushion laid over the bench, pulled the weighted sheet over her, and positioned her head gently on the pillow. She looked like she usually did, blank and stoic.

I turned to close my locker and pick up my bag. Then I looked back at her.

Her eyes were closed. She was sound asleep. Her lips had curled up at the corners just a little. She looked so peaceful, so unsuspecting. I hoped she wouldn't trouble herself to come after me. She always felt the need to protect me, and she was always doing so much for me.

Fryder and Beau were different. They didn't seem to need this type of care, but Alice...I mean, yo. That's my GIRLFRIEND. She may not get around much most of the time, but I'm not going to leave her standing up 24/7 if I can help it. A hard working girl's gotta rest, got it?

I left the store, locking the door and setting the alarm. I got into my car. Started to head toward home.

But I made a right turn where I should have made a left.

Highway 85.

Exit 76.

A rest stop. A lone square building, with a little cafe and inn that hardly anyone ever went to. You hardly ever find rest stops with all those accommodations. Usually it's just a parking lot to park and sleep in.

A faded yellow car sat at the farthest corner, only visible after pulling in and driving more than halfway across the lot.

*Perfect.*

I pulled up next to it, hidden from the road like Dylan.

He stood next to his car wearing a black leather jacket and stained black jeans, smoking a cigarette. He smiled as he saw me get out of my car.

I smiled back at him, my heart pounding. I was breathless. I hadn't had this with someone in over a month, and I needed it.

I'd met him in Grays Mart, at the dairy section. Sounds romantic, huh?

"Baaabe," he crowed, opening his arms. "Almost didn't think you'd show."

"There's just something about you, D," I whispered, stepping up to him and grabbing his shoulders. Exciting him. "You seem like a guy who likes adventure. Like someone who's seen it all."

"Oh, I seen *plenty* of good shit, Jen," he drawled, pleased with himself. "But there's always room for more." So saying, he ran his hands over my front.

This was getting good. "In your car," I panted. He grinned, nodded, and turned around to pull open the door so fast that he fumbled the handle twice.

As he turned back to me, I threw myself at him, kissing him as hard as I could. My heart was about to leap out of my chest. I could feel my blood simmering, that beautiful feeling of satisfaction, the familiar lust curling through every vessel, every nerve ending on fire.

For a minute, it was just hot, heavy panting and lips and tongues dancing, but I managed to push him slowly into his car and scoot us both far enough into the back seat that I could reach behind me and close the door.

I heard his car keys jingling in his jacket pocket as we tussled around lightly for a few seconds, but his attitude was becoming aggressive, eager, and I was ready. I unzipped his jacket and let it slide to the ground, hearing the keys make a muffled *chlink* on the dirty carpet.

With a quavering moan of longing, I reached into my pocket and pulled my hand back out. I could see his eyes travel down to it momentarily, but he couldn't see it. Part of the car interior's shadow was right over my hand, and the streetlight outside was too far away to illuminate us. That was the plan. He could only hear my noises, and he reached for me.

My moan turned into a low, gutteral groan of pleasure as I unfolded the modified butterfly knife with a single flick of my thumb. The groan collapsed into a low, heaving laugh as my hand swung down. My fist gripped a six inch blade tightly, and the *thud* as it met its target, followed by soft, squishy resistance and a warm spray in my face, was the most satisfying thing in the world to me.

The usual pleasant symptoms arrived; my simmering blood was now boiling, my nerves were singing with fire, colors exploded before my vision, my hearing greatly decreased so I could barely perceive the gurgling sounds of his agony.

He thought we were in there to have a *different* kind of grand old time, but for me, this was exactly that. My eyes fluttered, rolling up into the back of my head, and a strand of drool dripped from my lower lip as I uttered a low, shaky, husky moan of contentment and release. Dopamine was fucking *surging* right then. I was swimming in a pool filled to my neck with blood that wasn't mine.

As he died, my hands continued to work, and at this point it was less for me now, and more for revenge for the little girl I'd found out he'd drunkenly hit with his car. Something he'd admitted to me early on, saying he just couldn't help it, he'd done his best but he lost control, he just couldn't face the guilt or afford the charges if they stuck to him, but he tried to play it off as a simple mistake, something anyone could have done. He tried to make himself sound like a saint somehow, laughing it off, saying that he was better for it and it taught him not to drink and drive, so the loss wasn't in vain, and it all worked out in the end.

I pretended to let him say all that, but that had been the moment I was like *yep, THERE it is, I knew I suspected something was off about this guy. He's carrying THAT on his shoulders.*

Hit and run. He instantly suspected her dead, and fled in a swerving, screeching panic, hoping it would just go away.

Spoiler alert: it didn't. She actually survived. And by now, she was already out of the hospital. But he had no idea she'd made it. How did I know? Let's just say, me and Alice make something of a great research team, even if she isn't usually talking and moving a lot.

A monster who doesn't go to the prison he deserves can instead go to hell. He thought he'd killed her by his own vice, and he still tried to joke about it and forget it happened. I wanted him unrecognizable, just for that kid's satisfaction. I wanted her to know his death had been a ghastly thing, for her to know he'd been utterly destroyed.

"For you," I whispered, shivering as my arms went side to side, up and down. It looked like I'd showered in blood by then, and my own was pumping through my veins, warming me, making me drunk. Even better than drunk. I was high on EVERYTHING.

"For you, Mimi." My voice whimpered my sympathies for her. That was her name. Poor sweetheart. I hoped to God that she heard about the news report once media got wind of Dylan's disappearance. I hoped it would help her heal and slowly forget the injustice of her near-slaughterer getting off the hook.

No one should be forced through that.

I wondered how I would get rid of him, and what type of evidence I'd leave behind that would show not who did this, obviously, but just that it had happened at all, rather than him disappearing. His car, of course, a few scraps of his clothes, maybe I could slash the seats some to show there had been some kind of struggle and that a knife had been involved, obviously some blood would have to remain----

*KNOCK KNOCK.*

I turned around, and my heart sank. *Noooo.*

Alice stared grimly at me through the window. As my face fell, her eyebrow cocked at me, and she tipped her head in a *so what the hell's going on in here?* kind of look.

I slowly, shakily got out of the car. I must have looked a sight, and that didn't help. Neither did the blazing high crashing through my veins, making my vision blur and swim like I'd just had a twenty-four pack.

"Alice," I whispered, "How did you get here so fast?"

She narrowed her eyes. "I can run like sixty miles an hour, you know."

I lowered my gaze shamefully. "I-I can explain."

"Why?" she cut me off. "Why did you try to do this without me?"

My shoulders slumped. "You work so hard, every day. I can't *always* expect you to be helping me 24/7. You need rest, too." I sounded and felt miserable, even with my blood racing at one hundred degrees Celsius in the aftermath of my fresh kill.

"Do you have any idea what would happen if you got caught because I wasn't here to fix it up?" she hissed. "You can't *put* yourself in danger like this, Amanda. I told you. You aren't able to do the things I can do. You'd have gotten caught. I love you----don't *do* that to me. I don't want to wake up in there one day because someone other than you set me up for the day, and then hear from that TV on the counter that you're in prison for murder. No matter how much he deserves it, you can't do it alone. No matter how much *anyone* deserves it, we do it together. We love together----and we pay the world's equals together."

I looked timidly up at her. "Don't you ever get tired? All these weekends I sneak you out for us to have fun, all the days you spend standing up for hours----"

"It's our life," Alice said softly, stepping closer and touching my face with both hands. Her fingertips were like a soft electrical buzz on my skin. "It's not the usual kind, but it's what we both love. Who cares if you have to hide me from the world? You're *my* world, and that's what counts. If you go, Amanda, I'll never be the same again."

"I'm sorry," I whispered, stepping closer. We hugged. We kissed. She shivered, tasting the blood on my lips.

Next time, yes, I realized she was right. Besides, Alice seemed to be able to go at any hour. I tried to give her as much sleep as I could, other than the times...you know, like she said, I snuck her out for our little private getaways...drive-in movies, fancy delivered dinners at my house (she could sure put food away, but by God, it definitely didn't seem to go anywhere), but she didn't seem to mind when it was interrupted.

I sometimes wondered if I was trying to "human" her too much. But she liked when I did things like that.

She looked at me, her gaze deepening a bit, and even then I was beginning to notice the shine of her cheek as the distant streetlight reflected off of it. My high was beginning to wear off.

"Hey," she said softly, and her voice was beginning to sound faint. "Look, get some of that water, okay? Just take a minute and cool down. Don't worry about this."

I nodded, and quietly slunk off to my car. It had worn off faster than I expected this time----with Alice by my side, these things usually lasted a long time, twenty or thirty minutes. But the shock of realizing I had frightened her like this yanked it down fast, sobered me up.

I opened my door and picked up the water bottle in the middle cupholder. After slowly draining it completely, I felt more like myself again, and my blood flow was back to normal. I knew my addiction could raise my blood pressure if I wasn't careful, but being around Alice so much kept it down naturally. She was so good for me. So good.

She stood stiff and still in her usual department store pose as I walked back over to the car Dylan would never drive again. He was completely gone; the stench of blood had vanished entirely, and I suddenly realized I was clean, too. When had that happened? Oh well. I didn't question these things.

Even though she was stiff and still, I couldn't help myself. I gently pulled Alice close and kissed her softly for a few minutes. I knew she was okay with it, even like this.

I looked around Dylan's car, but it just looked like an abandoned car. Nothing to suggest there had ever been a knife, or any blood, or any Dylan.

I turned around and saw that Alice had come up behind me. Her hand was raised.

There it was, I realized----she'd picked up the knife for me. "Thank you," I whispered, relieved, and took it back, pocketing it.

"And THAT is all I need to see," said a low voice from nearby. I almost leaped out of my clothes as a man wearing a uniform stalked forward, holding a bright flashlight. I couldn't tell who he was in the dim light, but his next words sealed it for me. "Amanda Wingleman, we've been tracking you for over a month now for suspected murders. I am authorized to place you under arrest and have you----"

I instantly spun around, picked Alice up (thank heavens she didn't weigh much), and started running. "HEY! Don't make me chase you down, now! There's a whole police force after you, miss, and you can't possibly----"

"Bullshit!" I shrieked. Police did NOT just approach people out of the dark like that and claim to have been secretly tracking them. What police force operates that way? Or do I just not know what the fuck I'm talking about?

I heard gunshots behind me, and that only heightened my fear and suspicions of his intentions. It also put me into a hyperactive state. I wasn't quite all there anymore. My blood was pounding, my heart was throbbing, my vision gained new, sharp focus and clarity.

She was running beside me, holding my hand. "Come on!" Alice cried, and with her I was definitely moving faster than I'd been before. "He isn't who he says he is!" Well, at least I wasn't alone in my figuring.

"Alice, where are we going?" I cried.

"We just need to loop back around!" she replied. "Lead him this way, then slip back to your car. He's not a cop. He's a member of a downtown gang, but he's disguised as a cop because it's an easy way to take you in."

My stomach clenched. "Alice..." we were starting to slow down, already halfway wound back toward the rest stop. In the distance, the man's footsteps kept going, passing us by over a hundred yards while we were now stopping behind an enormous shrub shielding us from view.

Now it was Alice who looked ashamed. "I'm sorry. He's a member of the same gang Cyril was a part of."

I blinked at her. "A whole gang is after us now?"

"Only because Cyril owed them money, and they never got paid back. They aren't good people, not in the slightest. Amanda, I'm sorry. I hoped they hadn't caught onto us when we took care of Cyril. I didn't want you getting wrapped up in his problems. But I was wrong. They must have been tailing him."

"No? Well, maybe I have an idea where we can look next time I get that itch."

She smiled grimly at me. It wasn't a bad idea----but we'd have to move fast. This sounded like a pretty cheap and stupid gang, at least when you put them up against Alice and I. They must not have had access to a lot of real information. The dumbass had even gotten my name wrong----I was Amanda *Winboltan,* not freaking Wingleman.

But if he'd found all that out, and they were trailing me enough to know I was headed here, then I knew I'd have to take some emergency time off until after Cyril's old buddies were out of the picture.

Maybe I couldn't wait until it was time to satisfy the urge. At least today had been Friday, and I had the whole weekend free. I sure couldn't go back and put my other coworkers in danger until this gang was taken care of.

As my head slowly cleared and I carried Alice back to my car, I realized it was about to be time to plan, and plan well. In the meantime, no going home yet. Time to check out the local inns.

But not this one right here. Too many unsavory folks about.
