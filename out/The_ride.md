I had been on many rides, but this one felt different... Sounded different; the wheels clanged heavily as the ride went up the track, a sound that mixed with my now deafening heartbeat to make a strange sort of rhythm:

Clang...... Thump

Clang.............Thump

Clang........... And then perfect silence as the ride reached its apex, affording me an incredible view of the seafront. The silence seemed to last forever (the perfect moment) I thought as I looked out at the surface of the water; an unchanging green wave that raced against the grey sky for miles until meeting it with a kiss at the horizon…  It was beautiful. I looked down at the waves crashing against the rocky shore (I'd never be able to swim out of that) I thought morbidly and giggled to myself in a bid to calm the fear that now crept slowly into my chest. I felt a stir, followed by a sudden jerk as the car began to move along the track, accelerating at a jaw dropping rate. I watched the rails become blurry with speed, turning them into a shiny grey carpet that appeared to be devoured by the front of the car. Suddenly my throat was dry and my head was spinning; at this point I was sure I would vomit or pass out, but actually, what followed occurred in about 5 seconds:

I heard a loud bang followed by a screech as the front of her car became derailed whilst the back continued to roll along the track. I didn't understand what was going on, but the screams around me clearly said I was in very real danger. My heart raced as my fight or flight reflex caused adrenaline to pump through my veins, I tried to raise the buzz bars and slip out, but it was too late, the ride made a sharp left, causing my carriage to twist and swing off the track, only to return at an angle, with its right side sliding across the rails, instantly decapitating the girl next to me with a loud crunch and a violent arterial blood spray that painted the entire car a deep crimson. I looked through the blood in my eyes that now cast a red tint over my vision, only to see the mangled body of my passenger still fastened to the seat next to me. There was yet another crash and then a swing and suddenly I felt weightless. My car had fully detached from the ride and I was now flying face-first towards the sea at an unimaginable speed. That never-ending green coming closer by the second, greeting me with a loud splash and unimaginable amount of pain as the surface tension of the water broke every single bone in my body, causing me to lose consciousness... A great mercy as I needed not feel the salt water filling my lungs as I descended to the bottom of the sea, still fastened to my seat.

I opened my eyes.

Perfect silence as the ride reached its apex, affording me an incredible view of the seafront. (Did I just fall asleep on a fucking rollercoaster?!?). I thought marveling at the ridiculousness of the situation, (why am I even laughing?? Look at the size of those waves, I'd never be able to swim out of…..). I froze… suddenly my body grew cold, I didn’t understand what was happening but she knew more than anything that I needed to be off that ride. I began to scream; thrashing and wailing until my chest burned and there were razor blades in my throat; but it was futile, my cries served only to draw the attention of the other passengers, all of whom shared the same fate as me… 

I felt hopeless as the ride began to move. It gained speed at an unimaginable rate, devouring the rails as it went, I began to scream anew, clawing at the sides of my seat in an attempt to remove myself from under the buzz bars, but once again, it was too late… The ride made a sharp left.
