I can remember it so clearly. The day where everything changed completely. The day where the world was thrown completely upside down. The day where millions of people across the globe lost their livelihoods, and billions lost their main form of entertainment, their coping mechanism, something they held dear their entire lives.

It all had to do with music. Nobody knows why it happened. Was it some kind of disease? An experiment unleashed upon the globe by the people that ran the world behind the scenes? Or an act of god, punishing humanity for its terrible acts throughout the centuries? No one knows for sure. 

When it began, I was at home in my studio apartment. You see, I used to be a music artist. I made music similar to machine gun kelly, well his pop punk stuff anyway, I was never that good at rap. I was listening back to one of the songs I’d had in the archive for a long time, editing the auto tune and adjusting the mixing. This specific song was a bit more metal than most of my other work. As I sat there in the corner of the cramped room listening to and waiting the song, I began to feel… strange. It was subtle at first, then it became more prominent. I felt… high? Impossible. I’d given up smoking weed months ago. And I knew for a fact I hadn’t smoked anything, taken any pills, or anything of that nature. 

I decided to ignore the feeling and continue working on the music. The sound was cranked all the way up as the drums and guitar and my own voice blasted through my eardrums at full volume. Minutes later… I started to feel worse.. more stoned.. but at this point it was beyond a marijuana type high. As a recovering addict, I knew the feelings of different types of highs all too well. This felt like I was oxytocin or something similar. Numb, euphoric, way too relaxed. I took the headphones off immediately, sitting in my chair, staring at the computer monitor that displayed the different layers of vocals and instruments. What the hell was going on? Was I hallucinating? Did I relapse and take a pill earlier and simply forget about it? No… that couldn’t be the case. 

I took out my phone and began trying to research what could possibly be going on with me. That was when I saw a news article that had just been posted. “Unorthodox Tragedy at Taylor Swift Concert in Chicago Illinois.” I read through it, the best I could because my focus was far from there currently. It basically explained that during Taylor’s performance, everyone in the audience began to become disoriented. It only got worse from there as some fans began to throw up, black out, have seizures, and there were various confirmed deaths. Specifically they estimate at least 1,000 out of the tens of thousands in attendance  had died, while almost everyone else that had been there was ill in some kind of way.  

As I continued reading, my phone began to buzz as if there was an amber alert. The message that popped up was unsettling. “Due to unknown circumstances, music of all kinds is causing every listener to become impaired as if they had taken drugs. Please do not listen to any music including rap under any circumstances until this issue has been investigated further. Additionally, do not sing to yourself as this can cause the same effect. In extreme cases, listening or hearing yourself sing may cause severe symptoms including death.” 

“What the actual fuck?” I muttered out loud. Seeing the message was enough to sober me up somewhat. I immediately went over to my tv and turned on the local news station. Taylor Swift’s concert wasn’t the only event that had stricken tragedy. Concerts all over the world had similar outcomes. Heavy metal concerts and concerts that had larger attendance had reportedly been the worst,  causing the most fatalities. The world was forever changed that day. And it would never be the same again.

The coming days were chaotic and unstable. Legislation was passed worldwide to ban all types of music and singing. Millions, including myself, were out of a job and forced to find work elsewhere. Apps like Spotify and Apple Music were effectively removed from all app stores and discontinued. They found that different music gave you different types of highs. Upbeat, fast music gave you a more intense high, similar to meth or cocaine. Slower, more depressing music gave you a calming more relaxed feeling such as if you smoked a blunt. Just a minute or two of music started to give you an effect, and the more you listened, the higher you got. The louder the music the stronger the effect. And too much, would enable the negative effects and eventually kill you. 

I was forced to get a job outside of music. At first it was just a retail job in some grocery store. I didn’t have a proper education, sure, I’d graduated high school. But never anything beyond that. Music was my whole life. It’s what paid the bills. I was never that big of an artist, most people probably wouldn’t have heard of me if you mentioned my stage name. But I had enough fans and monthly listeners to afford the small studio and to keep the lights on, and that’s what mattered. 

I developed a hatred for the job at the grocery store. Depression crept in. So I kept looking for new work that I might actually enjoy. I can’t lie to myself, sometimes when the depression got bad enough, I would play the small ukulele I had stashed in the back of my closet until I was chilled out and buzzed enough to not think about how shitty my life had become. It was so easy to get high now, most drug dealers were completely out of business. Instead of selling elicit substances, they sold musical instruments, which were a lot harder to sell considering the size difference but a lot easier to find.

Eventually I found a remote job as a car insurance salesman. It wasn’t glamorous but I enjoyed it more than the grocery store, and it paid way better. And that’s where I’m at now. A recovering addict whose career choice got outlawed by law, and he was forced to adapt. My story isn’t the most interesting, or eventful. But it’s real, and it’s mine, and now, it’s out there for the whole world to read.
