I tried to scream when I woke up but found there was some kind of invisible, *almost magnetic* barrier preventing my mouth from moving. 

Instead of my bed, I was immobilized on an operating table. And instead of a TV, across from me stood a figure in a drooping gray cloak, wearing what I could only describe as a white pharaoh's mask.

“This is your only warning,” The figure said. His voice didn't come from any mouth. It's more like his words were stroking the inner cavity of my skull.

”Any more meddling and your punishment will be permanent,” his skull-voice said.

My bedroom—which I definitely fell asleep in—was now replaced by an oppressively white surgical bay. There were mirrors and shiny silver instruments arranged above me and along the walls. I could see a single black cable running along my operating table and disappearing somewhere behind my neck.

*What is happening*!? was the prevalent question pounding in my head. The figure seemed to sense this and gave a response

“You have taken too much interest in our pods,”

*Pods? What pods?* I had no idea what he was talking about. But then I remembered that last night I had spotted a particularly bright drone traveling above the downtown skyline. I took some high-res photos and shared the discovery on my discord. 

*Is this about my UFO obsession?*

“This is about you stopping, and never starting again.” 

The figure walked up to my side and began to stroke my head with a glossy, reticulated hand. I didn't know it was a prosthetic, or if the pharaoh was entirely robotic.

I was terrified but tried my best to make my thoughts sound consistent and clear. *I’ll stop!* *I'll stop recording any other night-time lights I swear!*

“Why did you seek out our pods?”

*Why?* The question momentarily stumped me. But immediately I gave the only explanation I could. *It was curiosity. I just wanted to know more about UFO’s. I’m sorry!*

“You wanted to know more?” The skull-voice scraped behind my ears, as if there was a chalkboard inside my head. 

“If you wanted to know more, then I will show you what it's like to *know everything*.”

*Know everything?* With a flick of a switch, a jolt of electricity shot through the cable and entered the back of my head. Suddenly, I understood that the bizarre metal instrument above me was both a clock and a calendar. It used a series of notches to indicate exact temporal relation to an exo-planet that this alien pharaoh was from.

I could see a linkage on the calendar-clock that lowered every two and a half seconds. Judging by the lightning-quick math I was now able to do in my head, this meant that the linkage had lowered about 240 times since I woke up, which meant that I had been in this chamber for at least sixteen minutes.

*How was I able to do that?*

“You can figure out everything now.”

It's like I had been given some kind of drug, only I didn't feel high. I felt more lucid than ever before. I was hyper-sober.  My brain was processing everything, every passing thought, idea and concept at speeds that felt impossible.

It was overwhelming. I tried to focus on just thinking about the facts.

*My name is Callum I had been born 34 years ago in Portland, Oregon and ever since seeing “Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind” as a kid I’ve always had an interest in aliens which is what made me get a camera at a young age to photograph the night sky which is what got me into photography and why I went to Art School and still owe $17,510 in student loans*—*which I will likely never be able to pay off because I spend the majority of my time getting high and playing videogames to stave off the void in my life from having never been in a meaningful relationship*—*which is a result of my overbearing nature from my ADHD and trust issues I developed when my mother left me with my ill-equipped father when I was four years old*—*hence why I gravitate toward mindless hobbies like video-recording UFO lights in the night because I feel that they give me some miniscule sense of purpose.* 

The psychic surgeon caressed the sides of my head with his plastic fingers. “Tell me about … purpose.” 

As soon as the word flitted into my cerebellum, I knew the result would be bad.

*Photography was a very loose sense of ‘purpose’ I had always given myself, but what function does it really serve beyond capturing something that already was? A photograph is a recording of a fragmentary blip in a universe that has been ongoing for 13.8 billion years and is about as meaningful as recording a grain of sand. I’m likely to die in about forty years from Alzheimer's from my dad's side. Why would I record thousands of grains of sand?*

The pharaoh went to a console that my cable was connected to. His synthetic hands turned a serrated dial, and suddenly my brain was working so fast I could feel my heartbeat behind my eyes.

I couldn’t help but think about humanity itself.

*Based on the underdeveloped nature of human psychology we are always doomed to repeat the same recursive wars we’ve always had throughout history. This trend is unfixable and will result in the stagnation of human intellect and resources, granting an assured extinction in either the next 200 or 2,000 years. The human race will end, having made no impact on the universe besides briefly sullying planet Earth. This pharoah studies ‘impotent’ planets like mine for a glimpse of the perpetuated evolutionary incompetence. I am but one grime stain of bacteria from this festering petri dish.*

The glazed white mask stared at me. Behind its two oval eyes I could sense the penetrating stare of the pharaoh. He was exposing me to dark truths I did not want to know. This ultra-intelligence was *not* a blessing.

Inherently, I understood that the surgeon’s race purposefully kept their IQ’s lower than 300, to avoid self-annihilation. He was ratcheting mine to more than triple that number. 

This was torture.

Suddenly, I could anatomically comprehend the very molecules that made up every cell on each part of my body. I no longer saw myself as a living person, but rather as a series of gases, protein chains and memories stored by electrical impulses. I was a busy piece of dust kicked up by the universe. 

*My life is so fucking meaningless.*

Then the pharaoh pulled out a thin white scroll from a drawer. He came toward me and unfurled the paper. I wish I was able to look away, but my gaze was fixed.

It was a math equation. The numbers were not centered around our base-ten numeral system, but something far more advanced. And far more true.

In a single glance I realized it was an equation for reality. Indisputable proof that this entire existence was a simulation. Our entire universe is just used as an energy source for an even higher *Alpha* universe that truly governs all things. My life was an afterthought’s afterthought.

*I don’t want to know this. I don’t want to understand this.* 

Each moment of comprehension felt like a saw blade ripping into my soul. What few acquaintances and modest achievements I had found in my life were revealed to be humiliating non-things. The cosmic dread became so intense I had an out-of-body experience. 

*I don’t want to know this. I don’t want to understand this.* 

Floating up and staring down at my naked, skinny pathetic body, I reached out with ghostly arms and tried to choke myself out. *I am a non-thing and I shouldn’t exist.*

No sentient being should ever be exposed to something so vast and de-stabilizing. The knowledge was endless despair.

Just when a stygian abyss was about to envelop me whole, the pharaoh turned down the dial.

I floated back into my own body, where I felt groggy and disoriented. It's almost as if I had died and come back, or been struck by lightning, but the truth was, neither of those things happened. I was just given *too much* intelligence.

“Never seek out our pods again,” the pharaoh said.

\*\*\*

Had to call in sick from work. 

I was bedridden for the next few days, overwhelmed with flashbacks of being shown that equation. It felt as if a monolithic weight was bearing itself down on all parts of me. Only after a week was I finally able to leave the house and look at the dying star we all cheerfully call a ‘sun’.

Ever since that abduction and ‘High IQ torment’ I’ve had perpetual insomnia, lack of motivation, and complete lack of desire for any social interaction. I just can’t bring myself to do or care about anything. It’s like my brain was irrevocably rewired to realize I’m a broken toy in a virtual game without a purpose. 

I’ve seen dozens of therapists, who attribute my mental state to an intense episode of ego loss and depersonalization, it’s what can happen on a really bad acid trip. I'm hopeful that maybe after another year or so of seeing psychiatrists, I can find a breakthrough and feel at least 10% normal again. Or maybe 5%. Hell, I would even take 1% over nothing at this point.

Let my story be a warning.

I know there’s a lot of fun, mysterious ‘drone’ sightings happening right now—a bit of a UFO-mania resurgence. But don’t get sucked in by it. Leave those drones alone

There’s a catchphrase in the ufologist community you have probably heard of: “The truth is out there.”

Well, listen to me. Do not take this lightly.  *The truth IS out there.* I know for a fact that it is.
