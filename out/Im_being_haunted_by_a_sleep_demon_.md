I started experiencing strange sleep phenomena, and when I told my parents, they just laughed. These encounters happened so frequently that I unofficially named my sleep demon Jerry.

Some context: I was a caterer who worked long, grueling hours on concrete floors, which destroyed my back and feet. Even months after leaving the business, I'm still dealing with the consequences of that physical toll.

It all began about a year ago. After another exhausting shift, I collapsed into bed. My sister, a Navy sailor, was home on leave that week. That night, I awoke to the sensation of someone sitting on my back. Given my sister's history of cruel pranks (raw eggs on pillows, tarantula molts in my bed), I immediately assumed it was her. I shouted for her to get off, saying she was crushing me. When I finally managed to roll over... no one was there. I checked her room, but she wasn't even home. I tried to rationalize it as just a dream and brush it off. She left shortly after, not due back for at least a year.

The encounters escalated. Weekly, I'd wake up feeling someone standing over me, their feet pressing into my mattress and disturbing my sheets. Before you ask – yes, I have pets, but they couldn't be the culprits. I sleep with my door shut and locked. The doorknob is broken; the only way to leave requires slipping a card through the gap and pressing the release. I'm the only one who knows how, and it's impossible to do in the dark. I was definitely alone.

These sensations evolved into nightmares – the kind that left me in such shock that I'd stay awake, lights on like a frightened child, screaming for my mom.

One vivid nightmare began with a seemingly normal evening. After dinner out with my parents and a quick stop at AutoZone for motorcycle parts, we returned home to find all the lights on and music blasting from upstairs, where my sister's and my bedrooms are located. Standing at the base of the stairs, I felt an overwhelming sense of being watched from above. While my younger sister came down those steps, she wasn't what terrified me.

In another nightmare, I woke to see a woman crouched beneath the desk across my room. Her stare was haunting – the purest form of evil. She appeared to be rotting. Behind my open door, a shadow lurked, as if deriving pleasure from my terror.

During this period, I had just gotten married and was preparing to move in with my husband, an Army serviceman deployed for nine months. While the experiences continued, I managed some sleep despite minor nightmares and sleep paralysis. Here's the strange part: whenever I wasn't in my room – during sleepovers, vacations, etc. – these problems vanished. I slept peacefully.

My final nightmare before leaving was the most memorable. I'd gotten up to use the bathroom and felt his presence behind the door. I remember screaming and bracing against it, desperately hoping he'd leave. What felt like hours passed before I could exit that dimly lit bathroom and finally wake up. I felt liberated, believing the nightmares and sleep issues were over.

Five months have passed since moving. We got a dog, and the problems have subsided. I still have nightmares, but the overwhelming unease and anxiety are gone. However, I'm heading home for Thanksgiving, and I can't help but wonder if Jerry is lurking there, waiting like a loyal dog for its owner's return.
