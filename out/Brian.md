Pretty much every day was the same for me. Get up, brush teeth, shower, get dressed, breakfast, then out the door for work.

I lived alone for awhile and it seemed to work out pretty fine for the longest time. But just like most people experience, spending most of your time alone eventually becomes pretty lonely. I was beginning to feel as if a roommate could be a good idea. 

Asking around to coworkers who maybe knew of anyone in need of a roommate ended in nothing. I asked around to the few “friends” that I had the very same question and still the same answer. “No.” I started to think it was pointless in even trying anymore. Nobody needed (or wanted) a roommate.

Honestly, I gave up for another 2 weeks after that. Everything remained the same; loneliness and the same old repetitive days. Until I remembered the power of Facebook. I started to think that there had to be at least some sort of group in my area that was searching for the same thing I was. Thankfully I was right. 

It didn’t take me very long to find a group that seemed suitable for me to make my post. Looking back, I feel a bit stupid that it took me this long to even try social media. Probably because I’ve just never really been a big fan.

I began making my post. “Searching for a roommate in the local area.” I added in extra details in the comments about what would be preferable in a roommate to live with. To my surprise, I started getting replies.

To be honest, once I checked out most of the profiles, it didn’t seem to be a good fit. Not trying to be discouraged by this I just logged off for a bit and gave it some more time.

When I woke up the next morning I was honestly a little excited to see if my post got anymore replies. Logging into my account I was pleasantly surprised to see I had gotten 2 more.

One of them said “my buddy Brian would probably be interested.” They put a link to this profile after that so I decided to check it out.

From what I saw just browsing around on his profile he seemed like your average guy. He seemed pretty laid back, clean, didn’t appear to come off of as annoying. I figured we’d get along well and it would give me someone to talk to and hang out with when I wasn’t at work. I got along pretty well with my coworkers but they just weren’t exactly the type I wanted to hang out with once I clocked out.

I messaged Brian and told him that his friend mentioned he may be interested in a roommate on a post I made. 

About an hour later Brian responded and told me that he was. He was staying in a place with another friend of his who just bailed on him and left him with all of the bills and it was getting hard for him to afford staying there. 

We worked things out and within a short time Brian had moved in with me. Everything was pretty cool. We got along pretty well and everything was working out.

I woke up for work one morning and checked my phone to see if I had any texts or calls. I had 3 missed texts. One from my mother telling me goodnight and she loved me. One from a friend just saying “how you been?” The last one is what started this whole ordeal.

From an unknown number, I had a text that was just a single picture of a man with his eyes blindfolded, lying in bed. 

Obviously I thought that was insanely creepy. I texted “who is this?” I never got an answer and I brushed it off as some weirdo just playing a dumb prank. Especially because the number was way out of an area code I was in and I already had everyone’s number I would even speak to. 

From that morning forward every morning became absolute hell. I woke up every morning to these awful pictures of a man in awkward poses with a blindfold on that covered most of his face. I tried calling and texting this number more times than I can count and I’ve never gotten a reply. 

After about 2 weeks of this I got the same type of text. Only this time it was from a different number. My roommate Brian had left a little earlier than usual for a morning shift. 

With just me in the house, I called this new number that was sending me the same type of picture. 

My entire body started to shake when I heard a phone ring from the kitchen. Brian had forgotten to grab one of his phones before he left.

This whole time that man in the pictures was me. I’m not letting Brian back in this house.
