There’s a myth where I live, I won’t name the area for the sake of privacy, but I’m sure you’ve heard of it if you live nearby.

There’s a young boy that started showing up around three years ago. He blindly wanders around construction sites, running, climbing, crawling, and at least once a week, he dies.

I’ve heard of him having been found with self-inflicted nail gun wounds to the forehead, charred black by power-lines, bruised blue from a self-inflicted crowbar beating and tumbling around, inside a cement mixer. For most people in the area, he is an afterthought, but to me, he has always been a looming presence.

I’ve worked construction since I was thirteen years old. The work wasn’t heavy. It was, for the most part, me blindly following my father around and doing menial tasks while him and the others did the heavy lifting. There was no other way for us. There were no other jobs in the middle of nowhere other than putting together buildings that attempted to give what was bordering on becoming a ghost town a purpose.

Sure, I’d tried my luck at school, but two years of failed classes, and my following actions I am deeply regretful of, made it clear that schooling was not meant for me. So, at the age of nineteen, I offloaded the burden of becoming something not subject to parental shed tears over lost potential to my younger and only brother.

The first month was hard to grow accustomed to; Now that I was not considered a dependent, I was sent to jobs without my father. Thankfully, the years of pointlessly running tools back and forth had paid off, and the men that had watched me grow up did not let me stray off with little guidance.

The longer I spent working the more my fascination with “the immortal kid” grew. While having not seen the kid made me feel weirdly left out, the others called it luck.

Sadly, that luck did not last for long.

It was a cold, dark, fall morning. One of those where you can only bare to drag yourself out of bed with the promise of a hot cup of coffee, and the bloating of your bladder. At the time we were working on an expansion of a small residential neighborhood that sat halfway up a hill and overlooked an ocean of pine.

The rest of the morning was easy for me; I don’t struggle to move myself along much after my ass leaves the mattress. At the site, I got caught in the sights of the new kid, and was forced into a sad attempt at having a conversation. He looked years younger than me, but the coming rumble in his voice assured me that the age gap could not have been higher than five years.

“God, fucking cold out here huh?” He was the level of awkward you’d expect out of a kid in his early teens. He still stumbled after the ‘F’ like he was mentally fighting back the urge to look over his shoulder; afraid to get in trouble for his loose lips.

“Better than the heat I guess” I answered back.

“I mean, I don’t really mind the heat, I’m used to it… But… the cold’s scary”

*‘Scary?’* I thought but mumbled out a bland “I get that”

There was a moment of silence while I waited for him to speak up again, but his stream of conversation seemed to have run dry. I took the opportunity to ditch the puddle deep conversation while I had the chance to.

“Shit, time to start already” I groaned and turned back to the scraps of a building that had been wrapped in tarps and shrouded by the mist.

“Alright, good luck man” he said as I began to walk away “I’ll catch up with you in a bit”

The group of men stood out front, a bunch, varying in height and girth. As I walked in closer, I realized that they were all looking at me, their faces pale, foreheads wrinkled with concern, and lips mumbling words I could not quite make out.

“What the fuck were you doing over there?” Marcus broke the silence, his brown eyes glaring at me from the dark pits they sat in

“I don’t… what are you talking about?”

“what’d he say?” asked another man, from the group

“He just said that it was cold out toda---” I stopped answering, realizing that I shouldn’t play into their bullshit “The fuck are you guy shitti’n yourselves over?”

“that’s the kid” Marcus spoke up again “he’s the one keeps endin’ up dead”

“yeah, guys really fuckin’ funny, this isn’t my first day working” I called out their bullshit “hey, why don’t you try that out on him huh? I’ll go hide out-back”

They stared at me for a moment, their faces still frozen. It felt bizarre, having a group of men all teetering a few inches over and under 6 feet stare down at me, true fear lit ablaze behind their eyes.

“Fuck off!” I said with a shiver sprinting across my spine, and turned around. He was still there, kicking at a small mound of dirt, distracted.

“Just uhhh…. Leave him alone, he’s bound to wonder off somewhere on his own” Marcus commanded and turned his back towards me to head inside; the rest of us followed.

We tried to ignore him for the rest of the day, act like we weren’t shooting anxious glances in his direction every chance we got. But he kept drifting towards us, inching in so slowly you’d hardly even notice.

“Never get used to it huh?” I heard two of the crew talking a few feet over.

“God” Redford, the older of the two shuddered, his voice more agitated than afraid “You hear how Frankie found him last week?” He continued while pinning up a sheet if drywall.

“No, haven’t talked to him in ages” Jacob answered while trying to look like he was doing more than dick all.

“He left a sander on for two seconds, stepped away and when the little bastard came trotting by… BAM!” He slammed the nail into the wall “tripped and fell face first onto it, fuckin’ thing peeled his face right off and ripped another good inch past his skull”

“Jesus” Jacob responded rather unsatisfyingly.

“Will smith was by him in five minutes, peeled his face off the ground and dragged him away”

Will Smith is… both a nickname that I will opt out of using for the sake of being taken seriously, and exactly what it sounds like. A man in black, formal attire that shows up whenever the kid dies. He always carries two briefcases with him, but only opens the one in his right hand, and bribes you with enough money to keep your mouth shut. Once you take his offer, which you always will, he drags the kid away.

I’ve heard that he sometimes comes with a small crew, depending on the severity of how many chunks the kid blows himself into, but it is neither something I, or the men I’ve worked with have experienced themselves.

I looked over at the kid again, he was no further than 12 feet from the building, still looking to the ground, innocuously kicking rocks and dirt into the air. His hands in his jacket pockets, not taking his eyes off the ground.

“Ya ever find him?” Jacob asked.

“No” Redford spat out the answer, and turned the question back towards him “how ‘bout you? You ever find him?”

“Couple years back” Jacob responded and ran a hand over his dry, hairless scalp “damn, fuckin’ lucky though, he’d just downed a bottle of paint thinner. Most o’ the mess I saw was the little he got to puke back out” he took a moment “still not fuckin’ fun to see, layin’ there, limp and blue. He was round’ the same age as my youngest back then, couldn’t help but imagine my boy in his place” he chuckled as the thought came to him “damn near grabbed the bottle out his hand and took a shot to forget!” He let the words hang in the air for a moment, and looked over at the boy again when the laugh he expected never came.

There was a sudden tonal shift, one so aggressive that it turned to a bothersome heat radiating through the air and stinging my skin until I finally paid it the attention it craved.

The kid was gone.

No other words came out of them other than a collective “shit” He was in the building, and if he was going out, there was a chance he would take us with him. The basement boiler was the biggest of our worries, but hell, with the stories we’d heard we were damn sure he could firebomb the whole building eight different ways if he wished to.

A brief mental debate decided that jumping out of the window would be suicidal at best, so I followed the two down the stairs with two others following at my back.

As we neared the bottom of the stairs, they stopped.

“Hey what the fuck! Go!” a voice shouted from behind.

“I can’t” Redford shouted back “Little bitch blocked off the exit.

I peered over Jacob’s shoulder and felt my stomach rip open at the sight. Power tools, tires wood, pipes, bags of cement. They were all piled up, filling the exit at the base of the narrow staircase.

“That little cunt!” Redford began digging into the pile, pulling away handfuls of metal and wood “I’ll be the one to kill that fucker this time” he tossed a metal pipe back in my direction and I passed it up to the men behind me, then came a plank, and a drill and box of nails…

Him and Jacob made progress fast enough to not warrant looking for a new plan, but slow enough to cause worry; And besides, climbing back up the stairs would be much harder, now with the growing pile behind us.

“I see light!” Redford shouted soon after, re-positioned himself so that he was laying on the steps, and began kicking at the freshly formed hole that began to give away with ease.

A kick widened the hole. Then again, another kick flung more metal scraps out of the way.

The last kick came with a scream.

Redford pulled his boot away from the wall, his leg shaking, his muscles contracting and clamping so hard I expected them to rip from his bones. He screamed like he could not stop, his mouth agape, cigarette charred lungs flinging spit in our faces.

“The fuck is wrong with him?” asked one of the men from the back, more concerned about his own well-being than Redford’s.

“I don’t know” Jacob responded and took the few steps down to stand beside his feet. “Mother fucker” he coughed out in shock.

“What is it” I asked to no response.

“Stay still for a second!” Jacob brought his hand to Redford’s heel and grabbed something. He tugged, but only managed to drag his shaking body lower down the stairs.

“Hey, get your ass down here” he called over to me “You two, hold his shoulders”

We followed the commands; I shimmied down the edge of the staircase while being careful to not step on Reford’s flailing hand.

“Here, I’ll grab his foot and you pull that out” He pointed to the four inches of metal that prodded out of the heel.

I froze at the sight, I felt the imaginary pain shoot up my leg, jut along my spine, and nestle itself in my brain. I wrapped my fingers around the girth of the metal; felt it’s coarse lining dig into my skin and gave the call.

“Alright, on three… one, Two, three” I yanked the metal back with all my might, freeing half a foot of its bloody length from the leg with a wet squeak “One more time” I called up and counted down again. Both the addition of more to grab ahold of, and a harder tug lead the rest of the metal stake from Redford’s leg with an elongated squeal of distressed meat.

I somehow had not heard it yet. It was hard to, past the panic and the now amplified screaming.

Laughing.

With my face still shriveled by disgust, I glanced around, and finally saw him staring at us through the hole in the pile, a giddy smile barking in excitement.

“oh… your mother… ha… I’ll… I’ll fucking… you’re…” Redford had caught on too and shouted obscenities to the kid while trying to catch his breath.

In this moment, I realized that the absurdity of the situation had not really come to me. My mind had been so focused on survival that it had forfeit any reasoning. I didn’t think to question how the pile had formed in such a short time, or how no one heard it being constructed.

I was not given much more time to think though, as Redford had caught ahold of his breath, yelled “Oh you Mother fucker!” and leapt for the hole, almost knocking me and Jacob down in the process. He sat on his knees and began violently clawing at the exit, tossing back whatever he could grasp his hands around and giving us bruise worthy injuries in the process.

The kid just stared, giggling, that juvenile grin still taunting us all the way until Redford’s ass eclipsed the light coming in through the hole.

“I got him” He shouted while half of his body still poked through the hole, leaving us to wait until he exited on the other end to see.

He took down a part of the clutter with him and widened the hole when he fell to the ground on the other end. We huddled around the fresh window, to catch a glimpse of what was happening on the other end. Redford had the kid pinned to the ground, his right wrist digging into his neck and his functional knee into his spine.

The kid had not stopped laughing and would not while the rest of us followed through the hole, and despite the visible struggles, let Redford drag the him outside.

Three more of the men had already run a good distance from the building. They stared at us, baffled as we escorted the kid towards them.

“The fuck are you guys doing?”  Marcus spoke up.

“Gunna get some answers outta’ him!” Redford answered, and kicked the kid in the back of his knees, forcing him to the ground, and a hell of a pain to shoot through his own leg.

“Just let him go, we don’t know what we’re fuckin’ with” Marcus tried to reason, looked around, realized that there was no point in arguing and took a few steps back with a shrug of his shoulders and a disapproving shake of his head.

“where’d you drop the thing from my leg?” Redford looked over at me “Go get it. Jacob, get whatever’ll hurt this sun of a bitch real bad”

I turned away before he gave more commands and listened to the kid’s manic laughing grow distant.

My compliance in the moment is not something I’m proud of. I wish I could lie, spout some bullshit about how I saw him as lesser than, A thing with no soul or ability to be good, but it was quite the opposite. A part of me, somewhere deep in my mind tried to humanize him, a part of me wanted the harm and anguish to be real. That part of me reveled in the pain and the blood.

At first it was quiet, but like a subtle hiss that grows deafening once you notice it, it bloated into a tumorous weight and popped like a cyst, sloshing its filth around my living, hateful carcass. And it scared me, the thought of such filth brewing inside of me and foaming out of my esophagus, forming thought into action. It was all horrifying and irresistible at once.

Even though the blood had mostly dried, the metal still felt slick in my hands. I shifted its weight from one hand to another and walked back to the already bruised kid that was circled by the men.

They had him tied down into a chair, his right foot propped up on another in front of him.

Redford was by the kid’s side with pliers latched down onto his front teeth “Now listen mother fucker, if you don’t quit with this bullshit and start talking, we’ll rip your skin off… Inch, by, inch”

“Jesus Christ!” I heard Marcus mumble in the background, a grounding reminder of the lost humanity that was promptly ignored by the rest of us.

The kid was still laughing uncontrollably. His chest heaved in quick jolts, his lungs overloaded, straining for breath, his eyes spinning manically while he drooled around the metal of the pliers.

“ANSWER ME YOU FUCKING CUNT!” Redford swung the pliers back with all his might, a wet snap cracked the kids’ tooth in half.

He kept laughing. Even as his drool turned to blood, even while his left eye was slowly taken over by a slowly spreading red. He kept laughing.

“Oh, you fucking!” Redford grit his teeth and raised the pliers to the kid’s mouth again. There was no reluctance this time, just the same, sickening, wet crack.

“Put the spike up to his heel” he called over to me “NOW!”

I did as I was told and waited for Redford to slowly hobble over towards me with a sledgehammer supporting his weight.

“Guys, this is fucking crazy!” Marcus tried to give one last push into the right direction “you’re torturing a fucking kid! Can you not see how---” Jacob slugged him in the jaw and sent him tumbling into the dirt.

A loud bang rang out of nowhere and I realized that it was vibrating through my arm. I let go in reaction to the sudden sock, the metal stake stayed still.

Redford began screaming again, yelling at the kid to stop laughing, to answer what it was, where it came from, but as expected, all he got in return was breathless laughing. Another slam of the sledgehammer nestled the entirety of the spike into the kid’s leg and brought a spurt of blood splashing onto Redford’s face.

Nothing, not a flinch, or a waver in his voice. He acted as if the pain was trivial to him, that our attempts at hurting him were the equivalent to a toddler trying to chop down an oak tree with his bare hands.

“Oh shit!” one of the men from the crowd shouted.

“Over there!” another man yelled and pointed a finger to the mound of dirt in the distance.

It was the collector. His open black suit flailed in the wind. Seeing him move made me nauseous, his legs were buckled and the only part of his body that moved. His back was always kept straight, his elbows were never bent and kept at his sides, holding the two briefcases. As he neared the peak of the mound, he began twisting his head around like a lost Meerkat.

“Good, let’s wait for him, maybe he’ll have some answers” Redford spoke up “Tommy, shoot him in the legs if he doesn’t answer, we might have to give him the same treatment as his friend here”

Marcus had brought himself to his feet again. He groaned and began walking to his car, frustrated, disappointed and expectedly misanthropic towards the crew he had considered friends before now. I could not blame him, in fact, I was jealous of his ability to speak out to the level he had. I wish I could have joined him, given some pushback to the depravity, maybe even tried to stop it with more men backing morality. But in the moment, *this* was easier than allowing myself to recognize that what we were doing had no righteous reasoning behind it, that the men I had trusted had this evil brewing within them, that I had the same evil within me.

The man in the suit did not take much longer to come to us. That was when Redford grabbed the boy by the hair and yanked his head back.

“Hey… look who we got!” he called over to the man, sadistically prideful “He’s not dead yet, hope you don’t mind the wait!”

The suited man stepped closer to Redford, the rest of us stepped back.

“This is quite unnecessary; you know that right?” the man’s voice caught me off guard, it sounded too smooth, with no imperfections, or hints of an accent. Each word carried a solidifying, absolute certainty behind it.

“Cut the bullshit, just tell me what this… *thing* is and I’ll end him quick”

“I don’t have time for your games” the man said, pulled what looked like a hatchet with hammer heads at the two ends of the blade, (seemingly out of nowhere) and hacked at the back of the kid’s neck.

The Laughing finally ceased in an instant; the kid’s eyes shot to the sky in a quick jut while the same, slowly spreading red took over the left.

“Now, there is more of you than I accounted for, and I apologize for that” he dropped the right briefcase into the mud below, squatted (while still retaining his posture) and cracked it open “But I promise to make up for it at a later date”

“Enough of this bullshit” Redford looked to Tommy, just to see that he was frozen in place, hugging the nail-gun to his chest. Redford groaned in expected disappointment, stepped back, and tightened his grip around the handle of the sledgehammer “Answer. My. Question… what is he”

“Is this about your son?” the man asked while looking up from the briefcase “If so, I am truly sorry. I have no way to control the boy’s actions, I’m sure I made that clear. All I can do is cover the---”

“I don’t want your fuckin’ money” Redford raised the sledgehammer and brought it down onto the suited man.

The mud splattered through the air. the man stood upright, a foot back from where the head of the hammer had landed.

“What do you plan to accomplish with this” the man asked “it would be harder to get answers out of my corpse, would it not?”

Redford shifted his weight to his good leg and swung the sledgehammer again, missing by a pitifully long distance.

“Sure! If you insist! Makes my job easier I suppose” the man gave in “just so you know, you’ll have to deal with the consequences of that knowledge” he looked over at us, and raised his tone so all would hear “all of you… if you are not sure of your will, I recommend for you to avert your eyes”

I turned around instantly, afraid enough to not look, but still cemented in place by deep curiosity. For a moment, as the suited man’s words were left to be thought over, I thought that I’d be the only one to do so, but the other men followed soon after, mud squelching beneath their boots as they spun in place.

“I commend your care for self-preservation” the suited man spoke up again “but you” his tone dropped “I hope that you have a god to pray to”

The locks of the suitcase clicked open, the hinges squealed as they revolved, and with it came the sounds of wet tearing. Whatever was being torn fell with a moist smack.

“Wh---” the exhale of confusion was distorted by a Chill shaking Redford’s frame.

“Give me your hand” The suited man said.

“No… I---” Redford mumbled.

“You have no choice in this, you wanted to see, so I will show you. Now, put your hand into the suitcase, Redford”

“NO, GET AWAY FORM ME YOU FREAK!” Redford suddenly burst out screaming, making the rest of us jump just at the sheer volume.

I disregarded the sounds of quickly paced footsteps until I realized that they were growing louder. Before I had the chance to react, a hefty force Bashed into my shoulder, nearly knocking me over, while he himself went sprawling into the grimy dirt just a few feet ahead of me.

The suitcase clicked shut behind me and another set of footsteps begin to approach.

“I am not surprised” said the suited man “But you were warned, not just today, but many times before. Now, look at you… Pathetic”

He walked past me, secreting a misty cloud of discomfort that stung as it clawed on its way down to my lungs.

“Now… look at these folk, Redford” He flipped the flailing man over, forced him up and controlled his vision by grasping onto his skull, his index and ring finger an inch away from gouging his eyes out “They were smart enough know what they are, chimps, minds molded to know not much more than eating and fucking” He let go of Redford’s head and walked in front of him “But you… you have a mind tainted by blind spite” his voice grew more agitated, I could feel the frown thought his words “You are too ignorant to recognize that this world spans much further than a life of slavery and pointless pleasures”

The man grabbed Redford by the throat and lifted him into the air, where he hung like a ragdoll on a meat hook.

“You were given a choice, and your foolishness led you down the wrong path. Now, it’s time for you to atone”

“No... Please!” Redford let out an airless squeal, but it was too late.

The suited man grabbed Redford’s pants, right at the hip, and tore them away with a single swipe of his hands. His cook sat shriveled above his shrunken scrotum, obscured by a tuft of hair.

The man pulled his hand back, cupped his fingers, and swung it upwards into Redford’s crotch in exchange of a flail of his legs.

The sounds came right after, and they never left me. They sewed themselves into my brain tissue like the patches on my pants. The ripping of flesh, like the sounds of rubber bands snapping in unison. The trickling of blood, like a downpour of rain. The creaking as his carcass pried from itself. And the screaming, oh god the screaming, its deafening in its finality, the despair of a man who’s indecisive over screaming in pain, or vein of his fleeting life.

The hand rose past his pelvis, scraping off gore as it went, rising up, higher, exposing the bone underneath. Guts came in their indiscernible form, yellow, red, and purple intertwined, spilling and sliding over one another; Their contents poured out if his asshole in an in instant release. The hand rose higher, still, scooping meat, ripping skin in a jagged line along the ravine of meat until it reached Redford’s sunken, dead face. The scream was still etched into his features, his face was still blood-red.

It was only when the Screaming ceased that I could hear the laughing again, it must have been dozens of them, laughing in unison, manically taking part in the rising mass hysteria that shook the ground with its violence.

I turned around and saw him… them, all just the same as the next lined up side by side, laughing, jumping with the same haunting, giddy joy.

And then they just stopped, giving way to the dreadful silence blowing past my ears with the wind. It was the first time I’d been granted the comfort of silence in what had felt like an hour. My ears felt numb, my thoughts were gagged, forced into silence despite their desperate need to tear my sanity to shreds. The air smelled of copper, dirt and sweat. My mouth tasted like the rot of my molar.

The suited man dropped the corpse into the mud like it no longer held any value, and walked away, shaking the blood from his hands. I dared to look away from the kids and saw the other men looking around with the same fearful eyes that begged for guidance. No guidance ever came though, so we all stood frozen as the kids helped in disbursing the money, and carrying the limp body of their brother away.

“With this gracious reimbursement for your troubles, I hope that you will uphold the promise of secrecy” The suited man gave us a final message before departing “and since the severity of this incident is more intense, I will be making up for the extra cause for distress at a later date. I appreciate your compliance!” He turned and sped away with that same, alarming perfection from the hips up, his legs still buckled and pattered in quick, short steps.

The tension in the air sat thick, even after we had been liberated from his company. I felt like I’d been entombed within a pit of slowly drying concrete, writhing, flailing, desperate to get out of the slowly solidifying walls that pressed in on me.

Even though they didn’t show it, the others weren’t better off either. The silence pummeled us with fists of iron until we were bruised and bloodied. There were no words spoken, no tears shed, I’m sure we barely knew how to. We all thought independently, but still, thought the same, understood the others grievances, and tried to move on.

Moving on was the hardest of all, clocking in a day later while having seen the death that loomed around the construction site, and tumbled in the cement mixers. But there was no other choice, there weren’t any other jobs worth sweating for, hell, there were barely any other jobs to pick from in an area that bordered on being a ghost town.

So, we all went back the next day, a noticeable pit in the crew that had only been filled by constant paranoia and a “You heard the man, you were paid to keep your mouths shut” from the higher-ups.
