Blood gets in the strangest places.

Under a rug, in a drawer, hell, I once pulled a chunk of brain matter out of a ceiling lamp. My point is, when you're in the business of cleaning, you can't leave a single stone unturned. All it takes is one thing out of place, one whiff of bleach, and the pigs'll bring out the big guns; UV lamps, chemicals, swabs, and then the whole thing is fucked. Your client, your payday, your life: all gone cause you made one miniscule mistake.

I guess this is a story about that, kind of. A story of shit hitting a fan which was turned up to its highest speed, flinging the feces about the whole room. The word fuck getting fucked by fuck.

You might be wondering how someone even manages to get themselves in the position of cleaning up after other people's dirty work.

Don't.

All it takes is a single bad choice, one tiny misstep on the map of your morals. It's certainly not something you seek out, not something you wake up and decide to do one day.

But none of that's important.

I'm here to tell a story.

It started off routine, regular. A random message on my burner. Some guy heard my name from some other guy who knew a guy and so on. The way these things usually work. I gave him a call and from the panicked whispers on the other side of the line, I gathered that it was a domestic. An argument got out of hand and the girlfriend ended up with a knife in her throat.

It happens pretty often, more often than you'd think. A lot of guys out there snap like a dry twig the second their masculinity's on the line. 

Like I said, regular.

The scene was supposedly contained to the living room; hardwood floors, central rug, nothing too complex. An easy two grand for a night's work. I instructed him to leave the scratch at the scene, toss the phone, leave the back door unlocked, and lay low at a hotel for a couple nights. He thanked me like a preacher praising God before cutting the line. 

Snapping my burner, I grabbed a new package on the shelf and went through the monotony of activating it before sending a message to my regular clients so they'd have my new number.

I packed my things and hit the road; handheld UV, scrub brushes, nylon coveralls, body bag, and a couple gallons of what I call Magic Milk sitting in my duffle. The milk is a combination of chemicals I probably can't name here, my own orchestra of compounds dangerous enough to melt skin if exposed directly. A couple wipes and what was once a red stain on the floor was now cleaner than a government grow lab; albeit, minus a layer of lacquer. So I carried some of that with me as well. 

Like I said, no stone.

It was a longer drive, about an hour outside of the city, and it was teetering on midnight by the time I rolled into suburbia. I checked the address and pulled into a picturesque yellow cottage straight out of Better Homes Magazine. The fact a bachelor lived here surprised me, I would've guessed mid-30's soccer mom.

That's when it hit me, it wasn't his house.

I sighed. These jobs had to be meticulous, perfect. If it had been the killer's house, the cops wouldn't have free reign over the crime scene since there was someone actively living in it.

But a soon to be missing girl? Her apartment would be chock full of pigs trying to sniff out a truffle. Now, I treat every job as if a whole precinct would be taking magnifying glasses to the place, but I still feel the added pressure. It's not a job that gets less stressful over time.

I hopped out of my car, slung the duffle, and headed for the door as if I belonged. Looking confident is a sure way to stop potential witnesses from remembering a thing about you. As instructed, the back door swung open without a hitch. Good boy.

The scene would've made a fly gag. The body was there, sprawled across the floorboards, knife handle protruding from a bruised neck. 

But the cat. 

The fucking cat.

The little bastard had slid through the puddle of blood which haloed the poor girl's head and painted a mural of gore all about the room. Streaks of blood weaved between furniture legs, under the sofa, on the sofa. The thing had wreaked havoc on the poor, country-style, interior. 

And it was nowhere to be seen.

In a mild panic I began opening doors, careful to avoid any of the streaks. I didn't need to be tracking more around the place. Not to mention I hadn't even changed into my coveralls yet. 

Into the dining room, through the kitchen, and into a small reading room I went until finally, I laid eyes on the little shit. I spotted a small kennel in the corner and, sliding on a pair of elbow high latex gloves, I approached the furry friend. 

It stopped licking blood from its paws and looked up at me, eyes wide before letting out a tiny squeak and trying to rub up against me. I grabbed it before it had the chance, and carefully put it into the crate. Its lock was finicky, and didn’t feel too strong, but it’s not like the thing could burst out.

The job just went from one room to four. If I had a way to contact the fucker I'd demand more pay, but I knew he had probably already tossed the phone and disappeared. I could've left, but that'd get the dude caught and he'd most definitely try to take me down with him.

I was backed into a corner, fuming, pissed, angrier than a gay conservative. The only way forward was to clean. 

I put in some earbuds, flicked on some Grandson, pulled on my suit, and got to work transferring the body and murder weapon into the black bag. She would go by the door until it was time to leave.

 I took pictures of how the room was arranged, and moved all the furniture to one corner of the room. First step was rolling up the central rug and tossing it in a milk bath. Thankfully the girl had a ceramic tub otherwise it'd have to go in the sink bit by bit. 

Next, I dabbed up the wet blood with paper towels, careful to avoid smearing it. The dried stuff would be cleaned shortly. I took toothpicks to every single crack and crevice between the floorboards, scraping up dried flakes of blood. Once the 'pores' were open, it was time for the milk. A whole gallon on the floor, squeegeed around everywhere to get into the cracks. It immediately brought up the dry blood and any stains that might've started to form. 

Sopping up the milk with a whole roll of Bounty, I got to work hand washing every single board with a sponge and yet more milk. By the time I was done the floor had lightened a couple of shades. That was fine.

The leather couch was easy, just more paper towels and milk made it look brand new, and I rinsed it thoroughly with water to avoid taking any color out of the leather. If it has been a cloth couch, the whole thing would have to go in a milk bath or be reupholstered. I've had to do both.

While the floor and sofa dried, I took a lint roller to every single surface in the room, the only real defense against stray hairs of my client. I took off the vent covers and cleaned out all the dust, threw every dish that was visible into the dishwasher, then took the lint roller to the underside of any removable cushion. The legs of all the furniture would get some care, just in case the cat rubbed up against them. The doorknobs each got a wipe-down with a damp towel along with the arms of each chair and every other possible point for fingerprints.

When I was pleased with my work, I laid a layer of lacquer over the floor and started in on the dining room. It was the same process again and again and again until I saw the sun start to rise through the windows.

All things considered, I had a day or two before the police bothered doing a wellness check, but I'd rather not live in a murder victim's house any longer than necessary. After finishing the dining room, I headed into the kitchen. The mess wasn’t near as bad here; just a trail of bloody paw-prints leading around the island to the reading room. I wouldn’t even have to move around furniture this time. I checked the countertops to make sure the rogue feline hadn’t run across them, and when I was happy with the results I took a step back to scan the room in full.

The stove was expensive from the looks of it, a flat, black top gleaming in the light from a low-hanging fixture. The refrigerator was equally nice, equipped with a touch screen which displayed the interior temperature. I swung the door open to look for a drink and almost had a coronary. The bottom and middle shelves were lined with mason jars, each one full of what at first appeared to be entrails. Human organs. 

I took a closer look and felt my heart start beating regularly again. Various roots and leaves sat submerged in some kind of pickling agent, each jar containing a separate curiosity. I grabbed one at random and turned it in my hands. It appeared to be a bundle of Sandalwood, like the uncoated tips of hippie-shit incense sticks. Another had a tight knot of thin tendrils, taproot maybe. I set it back down and grabbed a soda from the top shelf. I was parched.  I’d of course take the empty can with me once it was time to leave.

Closing the door, I scanned the room for the knife block. I’d have to clean and replace the murder weapon before I left; even the dumbest cop would note a missing knife. Spinning in a slow circle, I cracked open the can and scanned the room once more. Fancy microwave, chef-level mixer; this girl clearly enjoyed cooking. Finally I found the block perched beside a row of neatly stacked cutting boards. Two neat rows of pristine damascus knives glared at me from across the room, each slot full, each knife accounted for.

Something hit me then, a weird feeling that made the world seem off-kilter. I hadn't paid any attention to it because it wasn't important to the task at hand, but the knife, the murder weapon. It suddenly and harshly thrust its way into the recesses of my mind. Setting the can down, I hurried back to the living room and unzipped the body bag. It definitely wasn’t a kitchen knife.

I grabbed a roll of paper towels and carefully pulled the blade from puckered flesh. A thin stream of dead blood rolled down the poor girl’s neck. Wiping off the sharp tooth, I examined the weapon in full. A silver tooth of a blade curved its way from the most ornate handle I had ever seen. A series of spheres randomly dotted the engraved knife guard as embossed tendrils worked their way down the golden hilt, this also engraved with an odd texture. The tendrils all met at the pommel, a large shining globe made from some unique stone; iron-alloy, meteorite? I ran my gloved thumb across the texture and realized with a thrill that it was a pattern, not-repeating yet uniform. Hundreds of circles sporadically sat around the whole of the handle, each one connected to another by a series of thin lines. Miniscule symbols floated within each circle, every one different from the last.

This was handmade, awe-inspiring, a collectible of the highest degree. I checked the room for any sort of empty display, shadowbox, holder. I checked the dining room, reading room, even the never-seen bedroom.

Nothing.

A knife like that surely wouldn't just be sitting out on the coffee table, wouldn’t be tossed in a drawer at random. Which means there might've been some premeditation involved. Either there was a random collectible dagger sitting on this pseudo-country coffee table, or one of them had brought it from somewhere else. And how would the guy know where the girl keeps her keepsakes or collectibles? Was this self defense? Did the guy bring it and plan to do this all along?

I shook my head. None of it mattered. I was there to fix someone's fuckup, not piece together the events which led them to fuck-up.

But still, it nagged at me.

I finished the soda and got to work mopping up the kitchen. It was a white vinyl floor, uninterrupted by cracks or grout. A splash of milk and it was good as new. The reading room however, was a different story. It was a cheap shag carpet and I couldn’t even begin to guess whether it would survive my intense cleaning.  The furniture in the room looked clean, and passed that test with my UV. The carpet, though, had clear prints leading over to where I found my little friend.

I snatched a metal spray can from my bag and gave the spots a light misting of milk before scrubbing cold water over it with a sponge to dilute the chemicals. The UV still showed me the spots, nearly pitch black in their composition, though slightly more faint, so I repeated the process three more times until I was convinced it was clean; then did it once more for good measure. All that was left was the cat. That damned cat. 

I sighed and sat down on the like-new carpet. The room was relaxing for sure, and if I wasn’t currently under so much stress I might’ve fallen asleep. A leather futon sat beneath a wide bay window edged by two potted plants whose leaves reached towards the rising sun outside. A desk with a new model Macbook lined the wall opposite. A black door was set into the wall beside the kitchen entrance, its brass knob catching the morning sunlight and throwing it about the room in strange patterns. 

Finally I got to my feet and began the grueling work of pulling up the carpet to make sure nothing soaked through to the boards beneath. When it was rolled up past the paw-prints, I closed the blinds and shone my UV across the bottom of the carpet, and to my delight, it came up empty, that is to say a nice, pure purple.. As I started laying it back down, the light slipped from my hand and fell to the floorboards. Void black erupted around my feet, a dazzling congregation of smears and spatters and streaks became suddenly visible all across the otherwise purple floor. I was stunned.

Blood gets in the strangest places.

My brain racked itself for an explanation, any answer as to how a horror-show ended up beneath a layer of carpet. The cat couldn’t have done this, nothing could’ve. And the carpet was fine. My mouth agape, I realized the implications. Someone was murdered right here, in this room, before it was carpeted. With shaky hands I lifted the UV to the walls. Streaks of gore flung themselves about the room against bright purple highlights. The blinds, the ceiling, the closed door; its knob blacker than an underground ocean. Carefully, slowly, I reached out and grasped it, pulled it open slowly as a bimbo in a scary movie. 

A set of wooden steps led down into the dark. I set the UV to regular light and started the descent. The stairs came down to the center of a concrete room, the wall directly in front of them lined with tables and desks all stacked high with various old books and papers. Indecipherable language was scrawled above it all in marker; a permanent whiteboard. I walked along the chaos and let my eyes graze across dozens of open books and papers, chalk full of symbols and words in tongues unknown. Clavus Sapientae, Steganographia, Ars Magna es Ultima, Borellus, forgotten tomes of forgotten times piled themselves upon cracked wood and dusty shelves. 

I turned to my right and saw a cobbled together laboratory, beakers and flasks each containing unknown fluid and dusts. Indescribable formulae crawled across the walls in patterns too complex for my mind to comprehend. I wanted to vomit, run, forget about this damnable place I had so willingly stumbled into.

When I turned once more, and glimpsed the travesty behind the mouldering staircase, I had to swallow the bile which burned and climbed my quaking esophagus. Three bodies hung from iron hooks around a central altar, each one wholly disemboweled, their eyes seething pits to match their maws agape.

Clumps of gristle and flesh slumped from their hovering corpses in piles beneath their feet. Strings of sinew and intestine were strung across the spaces between, each meeting atop the altar in an unholy tangle of black gore. 

A fourth and final hook hung empty at the circle’s apex nearest the stairs. It seemed that one more victim would complete this spiderweb of muscle and tendon, this blasphemous congregation of flesh and blood. I took a step forward and looked down as my boot slipped on something. A circle of dust, or ash, ran around the altar, now broken by my accidental insolence.

The air grew cold, my heart caught in my throat.

A voice deeper than the bowels of the earth echoed defiantly around the insanity. Its tongue unutterable and sharp, bringing with it black ballads from aeons beyond time. Of what it said I cannot know, cannot even fathom fathoming, but transcribe it phonetically I will try.

“W’lngornia Th’glew ZALUDU Igi’Dphila Khor’ifdit” 

My eyes rolled back into my head, I fell to my knees in exasperated pleasure. Images, etchings, frozen moments from places outside of existence flashed throughout my mind. A yawning infinity of writhing stars, mountains of flesh pulsating an intelligible rhythm, ground that is also the sky morphing and expanding into horrors beyond comprehension, the shepherd, the glorious, sheep of a thousand eyes, the thin whine of accursed flutes.

I hung the lady upon the dull iron hook. Her neck popped as the metal separated her vertebrae and poked through the front of her neck like a maggot retreating from a rotting corpse. I leaned down to the empty body bag at my feet and grasped the serene blade before plunging it into her stiff body. I tore her open as her insides slopped out in a grotesque splatter of gruel. Her eyes melted down her face. Her mouth hung open. I grabbed handfuls of intestine and began tying them in intricate knots. My heart thudded dully behind my eyes. My breath came out in heavy rhythm.

Something heavy shattered from miles away, cut through the infinite distance which I was from myself and suddenly I was here, back to the present, back IN me. I dropped the handfuls of gore and turned to see the cat. The DAMNED, BEAUTIFUL feline staring at me, head tilted, from atop the makeshift laboratory, a shattered flask on the ground beneath it.

I wasted no time in running, and after grabbing my blood-caked savior, I was up the steps in a matter of seconds. I quickly stamped back down the carpet of the reading room, grabbed my bag, put the cat in the now-open cage, and carried both to the kitchen. I flung open drawers at random, and finally threw a handful of silverware into the microwave on max time. I was getting blood everywhere but I didn’t care. It wasn’t mine.

Back in the living room I pulled a can of Ozium and a lighter from my bag and began torching the curtains and paintings and furniture and more until I was standing in a miniature inferno.

By the time the fire department arrived, the house had all but collapsed in on itself. Over the following days the cops pulled four charred corpses from the heap of timber, and though they were ruled homicides, the causes of death were inconclusive. Too much damage had been done to the bodies. Only one lead reached the cops, a report from a man driving by, who swears he saw a blood-covered madman in a hazmat suit sprinting down the sidewalk holding a small cage.

I write this now, an untold time after the incident, with a cat on my lap and a weight releasing from my chest. I write this simply as a way of moving on, an acceptance of things outside of my realm of comprehension. 

I still clean, though now for a university. Restrooms, hallways, dorms. It isn’t a happy existence, but neither is ours.
