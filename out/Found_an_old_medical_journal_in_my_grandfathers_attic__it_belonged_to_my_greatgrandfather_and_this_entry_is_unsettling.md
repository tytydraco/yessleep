I was up in my grandfather’s attic yesterday, helping him clear out some old storage. Most of it was harmless - boxes of clothes, a few tools, a stack of brittle newspapers that crumbled if you touched them wrong.

In the far corner, under a moth‑eaten quilt, we found a cedar trunk. My grandfather said it had been his father’s - my great‑grandfather’s - and that nobody had opened it in living memory.

Inside, under a layer of folded linens that smelled faintly of dust and cedar, was a leather‑bound journal wrapped in oilcloth.

The handwriting was small and careful, the ink browned with age. The earliest dates were from the late 1600s.

From what I can tell, one of my earliest Hogey relatives was a surgeon when the family first came to the Americas. Most of the entries are what you’d expect - fevers, broken bones, childbirth. But one… one is different. It reads like a case report, but the details are… I don’t even know.

Here it is, exactly as written:

**Port Providence Settlement, October 3rd, 1691**

I was summoned to attend a man newly arrived from the northern territories, who complained of a persistent pressure behind the eyes. He was afebrile, his pulse regular, his breathing unlaboured. He denied cough, catarrh, or recent injury.

While seated before me, he raised a hand to his left nostril and withdrew a filamentous substance of unusual character. It was pale, lustrous, and of a consistency between softened sinew and thickened serum. It did not detach, but lengthened as he drew upon it, offering steady resistance.

Clear mucus clung to his upper lip. His left eye watered freely, the tears tracking down into the corner of his mouth. He swallowed often, reporting a briny taste.

The patient described a deep traction felt behind the maxilla and into the pharynx. As more of the substance emerged, I observed it to be thicker, with darker vascular striae along its length, and a faint longitudinal ridging to its surface.

At close proximity, a distinct odour was noted - metallic, with a putrid undertone, akin to blood left to stand in heat. The patient complained of a metallic taste and a heaviness in the chest. His saliva had thickened, stringing between his teeth when he spoke.

I attempted to sever the strand with a scalpel. The edge did not penetrate; the material neither frayed nor parted. Upon contact, the patient stiffened and reported a muffled sensation within the cranium, followed by a slow, rhythmic pulsation transmitted along the cord.

He became agitated, stating he was “not drawing it out” but “being filled by it.” His words: *“I am the sheath, not the host.”*

Shortly thereafter, tremors began in the mandible. Several teeth loosened in their sockets, and a thin seepage of blood appeared along the gumline. The odour intensified, acquiring a cloying sweetness akin to overripe fruit. Sweat beaded on his forehead and ran down his neck, soaking the collar of his shirt.

He described the sensation of the substance moving in all directions within him, not merely forward or back. A thin, watery discharge began to leak from both nostrils, tinged faintly pink.

Convulsions followed. The thorax distorted; the costal cartilages flexed beyond their natural range. The vertebral column arched to an extreme degree. The patient uttered a single cry, flecking the air with spittle, before the body appeared to invert upon itself, the integuments folding inward, viscera briefly visible - glistening with serous fluid - before collapsing into a form unrecognisable to my knowledge of anatomy.

When the episode ceased, the substance was no longer present. The odour persisted in the chamber for several hours.

I record this without conjecture as to its cause, and without any proposed remedy. The remains were interred in accordance with the patient’s final whispered request.

I don’t know if this was a real case, some kind of metaphor, fiction, or something else entirely. But the way it’s written… it doesn’t feel like a story. It feels like something he saw.
