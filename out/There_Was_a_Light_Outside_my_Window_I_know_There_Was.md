Having a bedroom in the basement has its perks. For one, nobody really bothers you down there, so you’re unlikely to be bothered if you are trying to relax. It’s always cool in the basement, and if you’re anything like me, you prefer to sleep in a cooler room. So no matter how hot it is upstairs, your room always feels just right.



Sure, it can feel a little creepy at times, but when I was seventeen I was really lucky. My basement bedroom at the time had a window, it was one of those basement rooms where the window poked out just above the surface. During the day, it let in plenty of light, and at night, you could see the trees, silhouetted by the light of the moon outside. It was a great room, I think it might have been the nicest I’d had up until that point. My bed was in a perfect position to look out the window while I would fall asleep, and the paint job of the room made it feel bright and spacious. White, but not a stark, austere white. Almost a creamy color.



Everything began one night in the early spring of my grade eleven year. I had been going to sleep the same as always. About eleven-thirty at night, falling asleep to a YouTube video on my phone. I had school the next morning, so the video was something I wouldn’t want to stay up for. I think it was a top ten list, something mundane enough to put me out like a light.



As my eyes closed, I could feel sleep starting to take me over. Normally you wouldn’t notice that moment, it would just happen, and then you’d be asleep. But in the exact moment I was about to slip into unconsciousness, something grabbed my attention. There was a flashing light, faint white and blinking.



I sat up, thinking it was some annoying ad on my phone, but when I looked at my phone, I saw that the video I had been watching had just ended, no ad, and now my phone screen was dark. The only light in my room was the one flashing, and that seemed to be outside my window. I figured it was just a car driving by, traffic was light on the street where I lived but not unheard of. No, that wasn’t it. The treeline between the yard and the road would have made the light choppier, and it was going on for too long, too rhythmically. 



I sat like this for maybe a few minutes, looking up at my window in confusion. I decided to get up to look out the window, to properly see what the light was. 



I was dazed, my mind foggy from having been nearly asleep. I can assure you though, I was wide awake when I realized it. The light didn’t seem to be coming from anywhere specifically. It was just some flashing point in the distance. Outside my window, at the very edge of the bottom, the yard began, a large expanse of grass ending at the treeline. The light seemed to be coming from the very edge of the trees, as if from something laying on the ground. I couldn’t see what from though. Whenever the light would go dark during the course of its blinking, I would try my best to see where it could have been coming from. I thought maybe someone had dropped a flashlight and it had set itself to strobe when it fell. Why the owner would not have picked it up though was beyond me. It was too dark to see anything well when the light would blink off, so I couldn’t tell what was there. The moon was glowing outside, but it was too faint to make anything out.



If I had owned any curtains I would have closed them, but I had never wanted any before so I didn’t. I always complained that If I had curtains my room would have felt like a coffin, buried under the earth.



Ten minutes passed like this, and the light showed no sign of letting up. I decided that I would investigate in the morning, but for now, I needed to sleep. I went back to bed and pulled the covers over me to shield myself from the flashing light outside. It took a while, but eventually, I did finally manage to sleep. It wasn’t a restful sleep, nor was it a very deep sleep. It was as if I spent the whole night in a strange state of being half awake, half asleep.



When I woke up the next morning, the sun was shining. I got up and looked out the window, and didn’t see any sign of the lightsource.



I got up and prepared for school that day, brushing my teeth and eating a few bites of some oatmeal before heading out the door to catch my bus. As I left though, I paused, my father was there working in the family room on his computer. I asked him if there had been a light outside the night before, one that might have woken him up. He said nothing had woken him, but that it was likely nothing, whatever it had been.



I went to the spot where the light had been the night before, pushing through the tall grass at the edge of the trees to see if there was anything there, but I couldn’t find anything. That’s when I finally started to feel a little uneasy. I couldn’t explain it, but something felt off about the whole thing. The light hadn’t been particularly bright, but I knew it had been there.



I left the tree line, going back to the driveway, and walking up to where the street was, I saw I had gotten there just in time for the bus.



I didn’t mention it to anyone at school, after all, I had no real reason to be uneasy about the light I had seen. There was likely a reasonable explanation.



The rest of the day went by without anything of note happening. Classes, lunch with friends, a pop quiz in history. I got back home around three that day and went to my room to do homework. I was starting to feel better about the night before, figuring it to have just been a dream, or at least if it was real, something unimportant.



As the darkness of night arrived though, my concern was awakened. I held off going to my room that night till I knew I had to go to bed, to try and sleep. 

I put on another video, something light and cheery, sure to let me drift into sleep with peaceful, happy thoughts. It took a long time though, it must have been one in the morning when I could finally feel sleep claiming me.



Just like the night before though, just on that edge between awake and asleep, the light started again. I got up immediately from my bed and looked out. It was closer now, halfway across the yard, pointing directly at my window. This time, I felt truly frightened. I had no idea what this was, if it was some kind of prank or what, but I didn’t feel safe. I ran upstairs to my father’s room, which was on the same side of the house as my room was, and woke him up. At first, he seemed annoyed, but as I explained it he realized how upset I was, and got up to check outside of his own window to see if anything was there. He pulled his curtains aside and looked out into the now pitch-black night. Nothing was there now, and he tried to comfort me, saying it was some kind of crazy nightmare.



I reluctantly went back to bed, and the light was no longer there. As I lay down though, it flashed once, before going out for the rest of the night. I didn’t sleep at all.



I got up, got dressed, and went to school. I made my dad take me to buy curtains that afternoon.



That night, I drew the thick shades closed and laid down once more to try and sleep, no YouTube for me this time. I felt sleep coming over me, and in that moment I felt the briefest of reliefs, thinking I would finally sleep properly. That’s when the scratching started. It was subtle, quiet, almost as if it was not there. But it was there and was enough to wake me up fully.



I jolted upright in my bed, head pointed at the covered windows. It was a slow, agonizing sound. Like nails slowly dragging down a chalkboard. Every few seconds it would stop, presumably having reached the end of the window, only to start up again. I felt sick to my stomach, my head was pounding as fear slowly gave way to terror. I had to think of something, if the night before had taught me anything, I knew going to my father would do nothing. I stood up slowly and turned on the light in my room. Once the light was on, the scratching continued, but now there was a thumping. It was as if when whatever was making that noise would begin again, from the top of the window now, it would thrust its hand at the window, banging it before dragging itself down again. Of course, guessing it was a hand was just me trying to guess, I had no real way of knowing what was out there.



In a moment of clarity, I decided I needed to know what was out there. I reached out, before I could convince myself otherwise, and opened the curtain.



Whatever had been making that sound was gone, replaced now by only the blinking light. It was closer now, the light directly outside of my window, and with every blink, it now shone so brightly that the world around it disappeared. I went to grab my phone, only to find that it was dead now, the charging cord seemingly having been knocked out of the port. That ruled out filming it. 



As the light continued to flash, a thought crossed my mind. I grabbed a notebook and began writing. I was recording the length of each flash, perhaps it was morse code or something, either way, I couldn’t just sit here and watch it again. I needed to start being proactive.



I took note of the flashes for maybe an hour, I had lost all sense of time. My phone was plugged in now, but it wasn’t charging for some reason. I didn’t care now anyway, I had decided that whatever this thing was, it didn’t want others seeing it, and was making sure I couldn’t use my phone to show anyone. 



I must have passed out at some point during that, because I woke up suddenly and realized it was light out now, the flashing object having left. I looked down and realized that I must have gotten a lot taken down in the book that night, as I flipped through page after page of dots and dashes. 



It was a Saturday, so I didn’t have to go to school that day. I grabbed my phone and saw that it had finally charged. 



I took to Google, looking up a morse code translator online. I found one easily enough and began inputting what I had jotted down the night before. It took me an hour, there were so many dots and dashes. Most of them were highly repetitive, but I wasn’t risking missing anything I had seen. 



When I had finished, I hit enter, and the program began translating it into text. I could feel the blood leaving my face as I saw what it said. “New friend. New friend. New friend.” It just repeated over and over, new friend. New friend. New friend. I began to tremble violently, I felt like I was losing my mind. At that moment my father knocked on my door. He opened the door and saw me sitting there, my phone in my hand, and I realized tears were streaming down my face. He looked down at the phone screen and saw what it said. He looked at me, concern in his eyes. 



We went upstairs and talked about it. He still thought it was a dream, but figured either way, whatever was going on, I couldn’t sleep downstairs for now. I had tried to convince him it wasn’t a dream, it was real. He was not convinced, and the harder I tried to make him believe me the more concerned for me he got.



It was a solemn day, I was drained, but I wasn’t able to sleep. I just sat there, staring at my phone, reading the message over and over again. My dad went into his room, making some phone calls. I know they were about me.



That night, my dad set up the couch for me in the living room. It was on the main floor of the house, the upstairs being only an attic. If he had let me, I would have slept up there for the night, as far from the basement as possible.



I lay down and closed my eyes, trying to sleep. Obviously, it was not going to be an easy task, especially because I needed to keep all of the lights on. There was no way I was going to sleep in the dark that night.



It must have been about two in the morning now when I started drifting off to sleep. This time I actually went to sleep, but it was short-lived.



It was the scratching that woke me up now. I sat up slowly, only to panic when I realized I was back in my room. I scrambled to my door, trying desperately to open it, but it wouldn’t budge. The door refused to swing outward and release me, it was as if something on the other side was blocking it. The scratching was still there, rhythmic and haunting. I was crying now, barely able to see through my tears. Hysteria was growing inside of me, and I ran to the curtains, ripping them off the wall as I screamed now at whatever was outside. The window behind the curtains was lower now, and instead of sitting on the edge of the grass, it was now below the soil. By the light of my bedroom, I could see the dirt behind the glass of my windowpane, and the hand that came out of it.



The hand jutted out from the dirt, pushing soil aside around it as it lifted itself up to the top of the window to drag mud caked fingernails down my window.



I curled up on the ground, rocking back and forth, going between sobbing uncontrollably and screaming at the top of my lungs. As the hand scratched at my window, the light in my room started blinking out that same cursed message from the night before. New friend, new friend. 



It felt like days passed like this, me rocking and panicking, the hand scratching, and the light blinking. The rhythm never changed, the same cursed message blinking in the light, the same slow scratching against my window. My voice grew hoarse, turning to a raspy wheeze of dread as I lay there, my eyes trying and failing to close tight enough to prevent seeing the light go on and off.



I must have passed out eventually. When I woke up my father was shaking me, holding back tears as he looked down at me. I could see in the reflection of his glasses, I was covered in dirt. 



We moved out shortly afterward. We had to. With the cost of my therapist, we couldn’t afford the rent there.



We moved into a small apartment in the city. It was on the twelfth floor of the building, high above the ground. It wasn’t very nice, but it was cheap. Luckily for me, it is very far from the basement of the building.



My therapist has tried to diagnose me. They throw all sorts of terms around, but I never really listen. I know it was real. I know it was. 



I still sleep with my lights on. From time to time, I wake up outside of the door to the basement downstairs, seemingly stopped from going down only by the sturdy padlock on it. 



I am afraid that one day the padlock will not stop me, that one day I will be under the earth once again with whatever the thing outside my window was, attached to that vile hand, looking for its new friend.
