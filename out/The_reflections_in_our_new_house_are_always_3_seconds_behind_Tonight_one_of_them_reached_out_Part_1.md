\[Part 1\]  
On our first night in the house, something tapped glass below us like it was trying to be polite about it. Three crisp clicks, a pause, three more. Cold slid along my mouth and into my teeth even though every window upstairs was locked. Mia breathed against my collarbone like a little motor trying to keep time. I told myself pipes. I said it twice in my head so the word would sound ordinary.  
  
We weren’t supposed to be there. The orange paper on the porch said unsafe to occupy, and a man at the town office had told me not to risk it until the inspector came. But we had a borrowed space heater, two sleeping bags, and more month than money. It was my uncle’s place—uncle like a title you inherit, not a person—and the lawyer said “yours” as if that made it simple. A roof is a roof, I kept saying, even when my stomach clenched saying it.  
  
By daylight the wallpaper in the hall peeled in curled petals that showed damp plaster. If I stared straight at it, it was just flowers. If I walked past, the pattern seemed to reach for itself and then let go again. The house had a sound to it—tiny ticks and throttled breaths and distant drips—that gave the air a flavor, sweet-sour like overripe fruit left in a warm car. Hannah rolled her eyes at me when I said that, but she sniffed, too, trying to locate it.  
  
We needed the breaker. I took my phone as a flashlight and opened the basement door and every inch of me goose-pimpled like I’d stepped into a walk-in fridge. The cold down there wasn’t the same kind as upstairs; it wasn’t air so much as a hand closing gently around my throat. My breath came back to me in the dark like a fogged mirror. The stone walls were sweating. My shoes slid a little on packed dirt that had been scraped into lines like something had been dragged and then dragged again.  
  
I swung the light and it shook in my hand. The beam hit a wall of tall shapes leaned up in the far corner, draped in old sheets. The cloth had dried to the texture of a bandage you leave on too long. Dust came off it sweet and stale and stuck to my fingers like sugar that had gone damp. The corner of my phone vibrated against my palm as a text came in; the light blipped; and somewhere behind me glass made a single bright ting the way a spoon kisses a champagne flute.  
  
“Pipes,” I said to myself. “Old house.” I peeled one sheet back because I’m exactly the guy who will prove to himself there’s nothing. The smell that came out wasn’t mold. It was powdery and old-lady nice at first, violet and something chemical, and under it, faint metal—like touching a coin to your tongue. The frame was gold turned green at its edges, carved with leaves. The mirror was clear and thick-looking, like water held in a window.  
  
It showed the opposite wall. It showed the fuse box with those glass fuses pigeonholed in, each one making a tiny cooling tick. It did not show me. I had one clean second of nothing where I should’ve been, like I’d held my body outside the picture by mistake. Then there I was, but half a beat late, like whoever was filming me had lag.  
  
I lifted my hand, stupid test. The me in the glass lifted his hand a breath after mine. When I put my fingers to it, the surface gave, just a hair, like a storm pushing on the other side. The cold didn’t sit on my skin; it slid in. It made the bone in my finger ache. I jerked back and laughed because that’s what my throat did.  
  
The tapping started again. Three neat taps. Silence. Three more. The sound was everywhere—near my ear, but no echo, like it traveled through the ribs of the house instead of the room. I watched the basement door at the top of the steps in the reflection. It was shut there and shut behind me. My breath smeared the glass like smoke and the edges of the frame were tacky, subtly sticky like someone had spilled syrup a long time ago and wiped it badly.  
  
I let the sheet sag back down. I told the cold I was done for now and climbed. The air on the stairs warmed wrong, like breath from a mouth you couldn’t see. By the time I hit the kitchen, the smell dropped away and it was only dust and old wood and the plasticky singe from the heater’s element.  
  
Every step I took upstairs echoed twice in the morning. Mia dragged her blanket like a cape and asked if the house could hear her. “Big rooms make big echoes,” Hannah said, rubbing the flat of her hand over Mia’s head until static snapped. The draft teased the banana peel we’d left on the counter and made it whisper; we laughed because it really did sound like someone reading to themselves and turning pages slow.  
  
In the light I noticed thin scratches on the floorboards leading in a stuttering line from the back door toward the basement. Not gouges. Not a pet. More like something heavy had been inched along the boards and set down and pulled again. When I squatted, a thread of cool air licked the hair on my wrist. I tasted copper when I swallowed and told myself I’d bitten my tongue in my sleep.  
  
The neighbor came by with a pie he held like it might spill. He didn’t cross the sill. He kept one boot on the top step and one on the porch and twisted his cap in his hands. “You’re the nephew,” he said. It sounded like bad news. “Place has stories. People don’t… They say folks don’t leave so much as they change rooms.” He chuckled like he was kidding and didn’t make eye contact. The pie smelled like canned cherries and nutmeg and I said thank you too loudly.  
  
By noon my laptop threw a tantrum whenever I walked past the basement door. The screen fuzzed with gray snow and the speakers hissed like frying fat. The carbon monoxide alarm chirped twice when I put the batteries in and then blinked green, steady. The house sighed.  
  
I found a second cold place in the upstairs hall where the wallpaper had loosened and bowed away from the plaster like a throat. The air there felt freezer-bite cold up and down the bones of my forearm when I reached behind the wardrobe. In the loop of paper hung a crumpled envelope like a tongue stuck out. My name was on it in slanted ink I recognized from stiff Christmas cards. I slid it into my back pocket without opening it. I didn’t want my voice to form whatever words were inside with Mia humming in the next room.  
  
Mia drew with the charcoal pencil because the crayons vanished in a box I couldn’t name. She made tall, narrow people with long hands who stood too close to the corners of rooms. “They don’t copy me when I move,” she said, not looking up. The space heater coughed warm currents across her bare feet and every few minutes the pipes above us ticked like someone rapping a spoon against a jar.  
  
That night in the bathroom, toothpaste gritty in my mouth, Hannah and I crowded the tiny sink and watched our faces sag in the bad light. The bulb hummed. Mia leaned on the doorjamb with her sleeves covering her hands. “Why is there another me?” she asked. “She looks sad.”  
  
Hannah smiled without amusement. “Baby, that’s you.”  
  
I looked up in time to see the right thing—the three of us, the towel hanging crooked behind us, the door. The bulb buzzed louder. For a sliver of a second the mirror showed the exact same room emptied of us—no shoulders, no steam-cloud breath—just the wet soap and a little girl standing by herself with her eyes bad-glossy like she was trying not to cry.  
  
Something tapped. One, two, three. Not in the pipes. Not right. It had the careful rhythm of knuckles on a table. Hannah’s fingers tightened in Mia’s hair until Mia winced.  
  
I reached because I don’t learn quick. The glass met my palm with the same soft pushback, and the cold climbed into my wrist like water poured into a sleeve. In the silver, Mia lifted her hand the tiniest beat after ours—as if she were following, not reflecting. There was a whisper of sound then, the dampest little scrape, like fingernails moving on the other side of a window in rain.  
  
The light over the mirror blipped and went black. We were three breaths in the dark, the heater humming from the hall, the house knitting quiet around us. Then the tapping came again, closer this time, right at our faces—three measured clicks—and the envelope in my back pocket warmed like a hand pressed through fabric as something pressed back from the glass.
