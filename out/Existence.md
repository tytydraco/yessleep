There was a tree bigger than the mountains with branches and leafs so wide that it covered the very sky, and that tree chosen to be placed in the middle of the lake, a lake so transparent that you could see the very bottom of it...that sounds like a beautiful scenery doesn't it?


 We were a group of four people. We were Amy, Elizabeth, Mathew and myself. In that moment we were just crossing the bridge made to be able to feel like you were walking on that very lake.


Well until the bridge broke in half forcing us to swim...after that a creature of wood with branches on its back resembling the wings of a demon was forming from that very bridge, when it finished forming, letting itself free Elizabeth was caught by that creature grabbing her neck with its sharp claws. 


In that moment all we could do was stare in terror while she was carried to the depths of the lake until they've reached the roots of the tree. All we saw after that was the blood in that transparent lake.


We were swimming while panicking thinking if we are able to even escape the creatures grasp, we survived because it didn't seem to chase us again.
After we escaped all I was able to feel was terror.


We were a group of three. 

2 moths after the incident we stayed at my house, it was a full moon at that point and we decided to do a sleep over, it was a pretty fun night, we talked and laughed until Amy asked where is *********. 


But none of us were able to understand what she said and so she tries again and again, and so all of us even Amy was confused since we are not able to hear or read her lips when she tries to say it, even she doesn't understand why whenever she tries to say it, it feels like she can't pinpoint the actual person she tries to think about no matter how much she tries.


And so she asks if none of us thinks that our group was more than three...we do but we never know why...and after that all of us are hit with a bit of grief as if we lost someone important.


After talking a bit more we decided to give up on it and tried to have some fun.
Later a heavy rain started and we still haven't slept.


Mathew was in the kitchen trying to cook lasagna for us while me and Amy decided to go in my room and watch the rain.


"Sooo...how are you feeling Amy? 


"Pretty decent, I still have a lot of nightmares cause of that damn wood monster but besides that I'm actually alright. You?" 


"Same-ish...anyways about that monster I was thinking why did it not attack us and just went deep in the lake?" 


"Good question...actually hear me out wasn't that creature releasing blood when that happened? Wait...no maybe it did attack one of us remember earlier when I said that it feels like we had another person in the group? Ehh  its sounds like a stupid theory." 


"Actually no you might be onto something. Dude what if that monster made it so we for-"


As the theory got really spicy we finally noticed the window was open...she said "Curios I swear it wasn't open...right?" 


"It definitely wasn't maybe I didn't close it right."


I started noticing that the rain wasn't the real rain cause the rain looked as if it was a bit animated while making no sound whatsoever and the ground was still dry...I was right.
I tried to close the window while screaming "GET AWAY FROM THE WIN-" 


But the window was gone and so in that moment we were paralized of the horror that we felt unfolding...while we stayed frozen in time we "saw" the being but it changes form so much that it actually looks like it's invisible and so all we could hear was some faint steps as if it was running. 


Those steps got louder.
And louder.
And...
The heavy rain started with a loud sound telling us that it's over.


The window was back and so we decided to close it being glad that none of us died.
Me and Amy were crying of happiness and jumping cause we escaped hell again...when we calmed down a bit we started feeling like we've actually lost someone. Someone named ****** but we don't know why so we decided to ignore it.


We were a group of two.


5 months have passed.


The city has a mountain in the middle of it and that was my destination since I've never went there and so I decided to climb it.


After 2 hours of climbing I reached the top and to be honest the view was superb but what caught my eye was an abandoned building that looked like a temple. 


I decided to go in "Damn it's dark I'm glad I brought my flashlight"...then I noticed that the building has stairs that go deeper and I thought in that moment "This is clearly a horror type of movie where I go down and die like a stupid moron...whatever let's go." 


After that there was a big room with pillars and torches with purple flame. While I was investigating the room I've found nothing interesting. 


"You are still thinking about those who you think you've lost...right?"


"Who the hell is talking to me?"


"Let me answer that first...I'm basically no one and everyone at the same time." 


"I guess that makes a bit more sense as of why you sound like me but at the same time not...but I have a question am I in danger right now?" 


"No you aren't I'm pretty much a pacifist that likes to see people's memories and the stories they might have."


"I see...well then let's get straight to it...why when you asked if I still think about those that I think I've lost you actually sounded like you know exactly who."


"Because I do."


"Explain!"


"The truth might hurt you but first I should say that even if I say the names of the people I'm about to mention you won't be able to understand it...so are you ok with hearing the truth or you won't care to listen." 


"I am ready to hear it."


"As you wish. So remember the creature in the lake? In that moment you've lost *********...and the rain incident in your house? You've lost ******." 


"By the way you and Amy are kinda smart since you two were almost able to deduce what happened." 


"I'll tell you why you can't remember them and that's because we higher beings have the ability to store people's existences making those existences dissappear completely, appearance, voice, memories about that person it's all gone but the only exception is when you are very close to that person's final moments before its disappearance making it so you have at least a vague memory of someone being the victim, nothing else." 


"The tree's storer stores it's victims in the tree's roots making the tree grow very very slightly and so you can imagine how many victims are in that tree and the same goes for the rain's storer and my existence is that I get the memories of those whose existences disappeared."


"I want you to know this detail.
The ****** body is still in your house but you won't be able to see or feel it cause he doesn't exist. One last thing...take care of Amy."


As the truth was surging through my brain I was left in a complete shock of words.
And so I went back home.


"You weren't ready...I knew that and so it was fun to traumatise you."


I got home and went to the bathroom. I was looking in the mirror while I was barely able to see myself through my icy foggy breaths as if the coldest winter came...feeling panicked and angry cause I can't remember the names of my dead friends I screamed. It was so muffled...


After I went to the kitchen I've noticed that Amy was somehow in my house. 


"You've left your door open but that's good cause I wanted to talk with you about something."


Her hands was shaky and her body looked cold.


"After the rain incident I started thinking more and more about the fact that we might have lost some important people that we had and I cannot sleep cause I'm feeling like I'm being tormented by the fact that I DON'T REMEMBER IF THEY EVEN EXISTED!"


It truly was the day for rain. 


I tried to hug Amy trying to explain her the talk I had with that higher being but
she pushed me away with tears on her face.


"Liar..."


"And not just that but everything you might try won't save me."


"I came here cause I wanna tell you my final words to you...I wanna die because I just can't live with this thought in my damn head."


"I'll say this after the day we met when we were kids I always liked you as a person and I always appreciated you for being my best friend throughout the highs and lows...but this feels like the biggest low point, to me this feels like I'm in the Void."


"So my final wish is that I want you to test if you can see my dead body...Don't worry I will watch over you and understand the truth together."


"IDIOT WAIT LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS."


As I screamed trying to make her stop she opened the window.


The second *** did this *** got captured by the rain.
At that moment I started having a panic attack while my head was repeating what that higher being said to me "Take care of ***."


I was in a group with nobody. 


It was morning after the incident and it's still raining.
I didn't sleep having that thought in my mind all night trying to remember who that person was as well.


I just couldn't do it anymore and with the rage, grief and the deep depression that I've felt I decided to end it all.


And so I went outside ready to be hunted.
I was kneeling and praying that it will end while the heavy rain was adding the sadness I had.


My last prayer was:
"kill me" "kill me" "kill me" 
"kill me" "kill me"
"kill me" "kill me" "kill me" "kill me" 
"KILL ME ALREADY!" 


My perspective started to move on its own far away from my body. Slowly but surely it revealed myself still kneeling, beheaded.


As I saw my body like that people were crossing through me like I was never there. 
The days are going so fast all I see is the sun and moon crossing each other with my body still kneeling.
Still praying that this endless cycle will end.


This group never existed.
