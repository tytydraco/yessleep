One might consider it an irrational fear, but I have always wondered if I am the same person in the morning as the one who went to sleep the night before. When I close my eyes, it feels like a blink that severs time—hours slipping away, lost to the void of sleep. What happens during those forgotten moments?

The bathroom light flickers on as I sloth-walk inside. Wrapping my hands around the cool porcelain sink, I stare into the face looking back at me in the mirror, holding my gaze with it. Long shadows stretch from its brow, shrouding the finer details of its face. I tilt my head to the left—it follows, perfectly in sync—but a part of me feels it lingers behind. Like watching a movie with the dialogue just slightly delayed.

I pull my comb from the glass cup on the left side of the tap, sculpting my hair like the hands of the maker. The movements seem like mine, yet they feel rehearsed.

Gently, I begin brushing my teeth. My eyes track the reflection’s, trying to catch the person behind the glass off guard. I gargle and spit out the remnants of the paste, cracking a smile into my expression. The stranger mimics me too, but it doesn’t quite fit.

Slowly, I inch out of the bathroom, dragging my feet across the carpeted floor—its beige fluff leaving footprints behind me like trampling through snow. Just at the edge of my peripherals, I notice a picture frame: my wife and me, standing in front of the ocean upon the shimmering beaches of the southern sea. Her golden blonde hair seems to blow in a non-existent wind, with a smile brighter than the summer sun we had stood beneath that day. The picture is the only warmth offered in the cold, unlit room with curtains perpetually drawn.

“Has it really been a year?” I whisper to myself before stepping through the front door. “A year since she left?”

A flash of yellow from the car’s headlights stretches across the driveway as I walk toward it, illuminating my path like a ship at sea guided by a lonely lighthouse. I open the door and climb inside, turning the key to awaken the sleeping metal bull. As it rises from its peaceful rest, the radio springs to life alongside it, filling the silence. I turn the volume up, drowning out thoughts of her with the chatter of the morning hosts.

Driving to work would pressure even a saint into a scornful rage. This system, this automaton we all turn for like cogs in a machine, feels built more like a torturer’s dungeon. And this—this labyrinth of twisted roads, with cars screeching like insects, crawling over each other to reach their desired destinations—this is the hell we endure every day. Until the moment we are lowered into the eternal embrace of our mother earth.

The mindless act of pressing the brake pad up and down propels me into the chasm of thought—an escape from the massacre of the soul. My body and I remain at a distance, tethered by an invisible thread. Out of the corner of my eye, I see a man staring at me, yanking me back into reality. His gaze is unshakable. His eyes never blink. Not a single glimmer of humanity ripples across his stiff face—no twitch, no subtle movement of muscle. A personified statue wrapped in human skin is the best I can describe. I rotate my head away, cutting him from view—only to be met by another man. And a woman, side by side. Sharing the same face as the man beside me. Their jaws hang open, as if they are screaming, but no sound emanates.

The traffic light flips to green. I floor the accelerator, launching the vehicle forward, doing my best to forget the ethereal encounter.

Eventually, I arrive at work, put my car into park, and practically run for the office. My shirt clings to my back, soaked with sweat from the car seat as I enter. Overhead, the fluorescent lights buzz like a swarm of irritated wasps. The office reeks of burnt coffee and cheap imitations of expensive perfume. As I walk through the workspace—with chairs neatly rowed on either side, shaped like eggs laid by some monstrous prehistoric bird—the company receptionist sits before me, tapping away at her keyboard.

She pulls her attention from the ghostly glow of the monitor, her eyes catching mine, the faint text of an email list reflected in the lower part of her glasses.

“Good morning, Miles. How’re you doing today?” she asks, her tone an exact replica of the day before. High-pitched, unlike her actual voice.

“I’m doing alright. Hanging in there,” I reply, forcing the words through a strained throat.

She leans back in her chair, rotating slightly, tilting her head to the left while clasping her hands together.

“That’s good to hear. Interesting weather we’re having, hey? The clouds are so dark and eerie. Wouldn’t you say?”

“Much like the rest of this place. It’s like walking into a crypt,” I respond—my tone harsher than intended.

She giggles—whether out of politeness or sincerity, I can’t say.

I walk past her. Faces pass me by—familiar, yet as distant as strangers brushing past on the street. I know the occupants of this building about as well as they know me. Which is to say: not at all.

A translucent kettle greets me in the kitchen—already filled with water. I flick it on like a light switch, summoning a blue glow from within. As the temperature begins to rise, I reach for my mug in its usual corner of the cupboard. It stands out among the others, printed with an image of my dog: a wire fox terrier, looking like a heap of snow shoveled to the side in the dead of winter. He wears a bright red collar—a gift from my wife—adorned with a diamond-shaped tag, like a medal of the highest honor.

I pour the coffee into my beloved cup and head up the towering staircase to the company’s main office space.

Booting up my laptop, I watch as it wakes alongside me, the coffee beginning to take effect. The slump of morning starts to fade, the fog in my mind replaced by a thought train with clear rails ahead.

The door behind me clicks open. My manager walks in and comes to my side.

“Hey Miles, how’re you doing today?” he says, with an exaggerated smile.

“Good, good. Nothing I can necessarily complain about.”

He offers his hand, and from my seated position, I grip it. His eyebrow twitches slightly, pressing against the muscles in his forehead before he turns away, retreating to his wall of stark black monitors. From there, he watches me like an all-seeing eldritch horror.

“Remember, we’re being pressed for those new illustrations. So I need you to push them out. We’ve got more things cooking in the back. And we can’t have you messing around anymore. Understood?” he says, hidden behind his fortress, barking orders like a mad king commanding his servants.

I feel the heat beneath my skin rise—but quickly, I smother the fire before it spreads.

“Not here. Not now. It’s not the time or place,” I mutter to myself.

The rest of my co-workers begin to trickle in, one by one. All offering the same good mornings. All echoing my manager, down to the exact mannerisms. Savoring that same condescending tone.

Finally, the parade of greetings and handshakes dies down, allowing me to turn back and continue my work in peace.

Hours creep by, dragging themselves into what feels like weeks. Not a word exchanged between me and anyone else—just the way I prefer it. And yet, guilt drips in slowly, whispering that I’ll never truly know the person seated right beside me.

Eventually—after what feels like years—the hands of the clock reach up to lunch hour. Like cattle, we all rise from our seats, shuffling into the kitchen to retrieve our meals, tracing the footprints carved out by yesterday’s rut.

I retrieve my pasta from the cold, low-humming fridge and turn to sit at the counter, listening to the flow of ordinary, monotonous conversation.

“So how is your cat doing today?” one smartly dressed woman says to another.

“Oh, you know, same grouchy energy as usual,” the other replies.

“Still wearing that cone around its head?” the first asks, flicking her curled hair behind her back. It falls perfectly into place, forming bronze rings and silver tunnels.

“Yeah. Always knocking into doorways,” the second says. “Where did you get your hair done, by the way?”

The first woman ignites to life.

“Well, you know Jenner from across the street, right? Well, she—”

Their voices begin to blur together, transforming into something unintelligible—just noise filling the space. But it keeps my mind distracted as I chomp away at my nearly week-old pasta. It tastes plain. The grated cheese masks it somewhat, but the lack of seasoning is obvious. Still, I keep chewing, watching the pasta slowly vanish, piece by piece.

My mind drifts away from the scripted dialogue of the two women, returning to the memory of the staring man. His unblinking gaze. It still makes no sense—why would he do that? It was like he was peering into my soul. Judging every thought. The ones I had then, and even the ones from a year ago. I don’t know how I received that impression, but it just seemed to click.

Lingering on the thought,I lifted my fork, stabbed the final piece of pasta, and gently raised it to my mouth.

“Hey, Miles…”

The sound of my name wrapped around me like fishhooks sinking into bait—familiar, unwanted. I set my fork down, slow and steady, not bothering to turn toward the voice. I already knew what was coming. Same hour, same questions.

“How’ve you been?” The bronze-haired woman’s voice rang clear. Soft, careful. Sincerity dripping from every syllable.

“Alright, I guess.”

A simple question. Deserving of an equally simple answer.

“Good. That’s excellent. Just making sure. Because… well… it’s been a year since—”

“Please, don’t,” I snapped, the words hissing out between gritted teeth.

She stiffened. Lips pressed into a thin, downward line. “Oh. Okay…”

The distance between us thickened, bloated. A mangled corpse of conversation lay in the space we shared. The overhead lights buzzed, filling the silence with artificial static.

My gut twisted. Too late, I realized the sharpness in my tone.

“Sorry,” I offered, voice drained. Like I was running on fumes. “It was just… I’d rather not think about it. You know? It was better that way.”

She gave a small nod. Her face softened, warmth returning to it, and just like that, the room felt a shade brighter.

“It’s alright. I can imagine it was quite a cross to bear.”

“Sometimes,” I thought. “The weight of it was much too difficult to uphold.”

But I kept that part to myself.

Eventually, the day dragged itself to a close. We gathered our things, each of us retreating to our cars like tired ants trailing home.

On the drive, I caught myself peering into every passing window. Searching. Still haunted by the image of the man who had stared—unblinking, unsettling. A trespasser lingering in the background of my mind.

At every red light, I checked my phone. Nothing. No texts. No pings. Not even an emoji from a coworker. Just blankness.

Strangers again.

The light shifted to green. My foot slammed down heavier than I intended. My body moved faster than my mind could course-correct.

When I arrived, the sky had shifted from dark morning to darker night. The kind of black that felt like a mountain standing between earth and moon. No silver light. No stars. Just absence.

I stepped inside. The lounge greeted me like an echo chamber. Walls that once bounced with her laughter now trapped me in silence.

I was a prisoner here. And yet, I returned to my cell every single night.

Like a dead satellite, I drifted across the room, crashing down onto the fold-out couch.

The TV was already blaring—Season 13 of *The Rickets*. My favorite sitcom.

I could quote the lines before they left the characters’ mouths.

The crowd laughed where they were supposed to.

But I only laughed in the spaces between. Those awkward beats between laugh tracks—those were the only moments that got me.

The glow of the television danced against the walls, flashing in shifts of color—blue, red, yellow. Like a slideshow.

Part of it was blocked out by my shadow. My silhouette, laughing alone.

Then a sharp yelp from Bella.

Right.

“Oh no. How could I forget about you?” I whispered. A smile crept across my face, uninvited but welcome. “You were her gift to me.”

I reached down and scratched behind her clipped ear. Poor Bella. Too brave for her own good—always thinking she could take on anything, no matter the size. That jagged scar where her ear ended would never let me forget.

I rose from the couch, slow, and walked to the kitchen to feed her.

“Sometimes,” I said as she started munching, “I don’t think I’d make it through another day if it weren’t for you.” I paused to sniff, building a dam wall to stop the flood of tears from bursting out.

“I get to say whatever I want, and you don’t judge me. You don’t understand, of course. But that wasn’t the point, really, was it.” I stopped scratching the back of her neck. Let my arm hover just above her.

“I remembered the day she left. She was sitting…” I moved my hand to point towards the couch.

“… there. Unmoving. Unblinking. There was a stillness to her that was almost uncanny.”

A smile raised my cheeks, though its intent wasn’t happiness. My eyes squeezed to slits. Tears collected, then spilled.

“I saw a man today. You know. He also…”

More tears streaked down to the bottom of my chin. Dripped off like a leaking tap. Merged into the mat below.

“… shared the same face she had that night.”

My jaw opened, as if to let out a cry. But it was silent. Not wishing to be released.

“It sounded ridiculous when I said it out loud.” I closed my mouth. “I hoped I wasn’t beginning to lose it, Bella.” I chuckled slightly, releasing the tension building in my muscles.

“That wouldn’t be good for either of us, now would it.” I chuckled again, but stopped just as quickly.

However, saying it aloud felt like confession. And that night, Bella was my church.

After feeding her and giving her water, I walked toward the bed and placed myself gently into its sheath. I rolled over to her side. Empty. Cold. The warmth of her body now existed only in memory. I held the pillow closest to me—once hers—clutching it as if memory could turn fabric into flesh.

We used to drift off to sleep together like this.

Now I just drifted.

I got up. And went to sleep.

The alarm clock rang, dragging me from the subconscious plane. I ascended slowly—delta, to theta, to alpha. Consciousness took hold. I turned in place. The space beside me was still empty, just as it had been yesterday.

I wished I had awakened to find it was all a dream. That I’d been locked in some cruel nightmare, and there was another version of me, in another life, still waking up beside her. Still seeing the calming look of her face.

I ran through my morning routine. I hopped into the shower—and immediately twisted away as arctic water beaded down my back. I lurched out of the glass-encased stall.

“Did I forget to turn the geyser on?” I muttered. “I never forgot to do it.”

I wiped the wet chill from my hair, looking into the mirror. The stranger stared back. I reached for my comb—only to find it on the right side of the tap. It was always on the left.

“Strange,” I whispered. “I don’t remember moving it.”

A moment passed. Then something else broke the morning pattern. The photo of my wife and me at the beach was facing the wrong direction. Tilted—almost turned completely around. And the carpet below felt thinner. The threads seemed shorter. A minor detail. But one I couldn’t unsee.

Driving to work, my foot tapped the brake at each intersection, my body moving on autopilot. I avoided looking at the windows or mirrors. For fear that face would return—the one I’d seen yesterday. The one that wasn’t mine.

I arrived. Greeted the receptionist with the same smile I’d offered yesterday. Walked the same path to the kitchen. I opened the cupboard. My cup was there—but off-center. I picked it up and tilted it. Faded remains of someone else's coffee slid down the inside, like wax trailing from a burned-out candle.

I turned sharply to one of the cleaners nearby.

“Excuse me,” I asked. “Did someone use my mug this morning?”

She scrunched her face like a sponge. “No. Not that I’m aware of.”

I walked off. My heavy footsteps thudded through the silence. Each step landed with a thunderous echo, like I was stomping on the ceiling of another world.

I dropped into my seat in front of the computer. My fingers raked through damp hair. The monitor was already on. The keyboard was warm—like someone had just been there. My heart skipped. My palms sweat.

Lightning-fast, I opened my emails. My messages. Socials. Everything. Nothing had been touched. All the unopened messages from family were still marked “delivered.” Emails, untouched. DMs unread. Everything still exactly as I’d left it.

“Miles, how’re you today?” my manager asked, walking in. He mirrored the exact tone and posture from yesterday. Like a looping recording.

“Alright, I guess,” I said. “My computer was on when I got in.”

“Huh. That’s weird.” He paused. “Maybe you just forgot to turn it off. Happens to all of us.”

Maybe. But I never forgot to turn it off.

“Maybe,” I lied.

He nodded. “About the items on your board—I need them cleared today.”

“On it.”

He nodded again, too many times. “Alright. Good.” Then disappeared behind his wall of screens.

As the day continued, I couldn’t shake the thoughts. The geyser. The comb. The mug. The computer. It was all off. Slight, yes—but wrong enough that it echoed. I replayed the moments in my head like scenes from a broken film reel—front to back. Back to front. A creeping unease flowered inside me. Something was wrong. More than wrong. Unnatural.

It distracted me. Time began to warp. One moment, I was typing. The next, it was lunch.

We were all in the kitchen again. A sea of chatter and chewed pasta. I sat across from a glass-walled meeting room, barely tasting my food. 

The sounds of me crushing my food down to swallow slowly begin to change — morphing into the mechanical beat of an oxygen machine. That sound. I know it too well. It’s carved into my psyche.

A memory:  
The room is silent, save for that soft, rhythmic hiss of the oxygen tank.

She’s asleep — or something close to it.  
Eyes half-shut. Mouth slightly open.  
Her skin looks like old paper, pale and thin.  
I sit beside her bed, spoon in one hand, bowl of cold broth in the other.

“Open up,” I whisper, guiding the spoon toward her lips.

She turns her head away.

I sigh. Set the bowl down. Pinch the bridge of my nose.  
Everything aches. My eyes burn. I haven’t showered in… three days? Maybe more.

“You’ve gotta eat something,” I say. “You have to. I can’t—”

I stop.

The nightstand holds a row of pill bottles. Each name feels like a curse.  
A crumpled medication schedule sits beside them — rewritten so many times I can’t read my own handwriting anymore.

Her breathing fills the room. Shallow. Ragged. Constant.  
Even music can’t drown it out anymore.

“You could at least pretend to try,” I mutter, immediately ashamed of how bitter it sounds.

She opens one eye. Just a sliver.  
A flicker of recognition? Or just a twitch?

I don’t know anymore.

I grab the washcloth from the bowl beside her, wring it out, and gently wipe her forehead. Her skin is cold. Damp. She flinches slightly.

“You never say thank you,” I whisper. Quieter now. “Not once.”

I pause.

“I took leave from work. Missed Joey’s birthday. I sleep on the couch now because your moaning keeps me up. You know that?”

No answer. Her eyes are closed again.

The noise shifts from the beeps of the oxygen machine back to chewing.

I swallow.

My plate’s empty.

I push the chair back, rising to my feet.  
Beyond the silver-bronze-haired woman in the glassed-off meeting room, I see—

Her.

A woman staring at me through the glass.

My jaw tightened

She didn’t blink. I did—but she didn’t. Her eyes were unbroken beams, burning into mine.

My breath stopped as the shape of her face came into focus. The cheekbones. The lips. The delicate curve of her brows.

She looked exactly like my wife.

Not similar. Not close.

Exactly.

I rose abruptly. My fork clattered. Pasta spilled to the floor like shredded flesh. Conversations stopped. Heads turned.

But I was locked on her face.

“Miles. Are you okay?” a bronze-haired coworker asked gently, pulling me out of my trance.

I crouched, picking up the shattered plate with trembling hands.

The cleaner stepped forward. “Don’t worry, Miles. I’ve got it.”

I looked up at her through the curtain of my hair.

“It’s my mess. I’ll clean it.”

“Why don’t you step outside for a second? Get some air.”

I didn’t reply. I just left.

Outside, I breathe. Four in. Hold for four. Four out. Hold again.

 Repeat.

 My heart rate begins to soften, barely.

 Then I see him.

 Across the parking lot, just beyond the fence.

 A figure. Standing still. Watching.

 The outline resolves into a face I remember.

 The man from yesterday.

 Frozen.

 Staring.

 I begin walking toward him. Each step faster than the last. His face comes into focus—glassy eyes, pale skin, mouth slightly open. Unmoving.

 “Hey!” I shout. “Hey! What’s your problem, man?! Why’re you watching me, huh?”

 He doesn’t flinch. Just stares. Hollow. As if waiting for something.

 “You some sick voyeur? Is that it?!”

 Still no answer. But then—his mouth opens.

 And moves.

 No sound escapes it.

 But I read his lips clearly.

 The realization of what he’s saying freezes my blood. My heart seems to stop. I stare into the abyss of death itself, before the shock surges down from my head to my feet, snapping me back into my body.

 I turn and sprint toward my car. Co-workers and other staff rush out, yelling after me.

 “Miles! What’s going on?!” one of them screams.

 I don’t answer. I climb into my car and slam the gas, tearing through the parking lot and merging onto the main road, leaving the area behind in a blur.

 I crash through the front door of my house. It’s darker inside than out. I flick the light on, flooding the room with harsh brightness.

As my eyes adjust, the first thing I see is my couch, flipped upside down—the coffee table with it, everything that was on the table now lying on the floor beneath it, also upside down. My mind, incapable of processing what I’m seeing, begins to twist and turn, trying to bridge some kind of rational thought, but failing.

 As my eyes drift across the room, I realize everything is upside down. The television—perfectly balanced in the air, as if designed to sit that way. The kitchen too—the fridge, the cupboards, even the damn handles. All of it, flipped.

 I move through the house, grabbing a butcher knife from the kitchen and clutching it so tightly that my knuckles—like the rest of my body—begin turning white. My mind buzzes with possibilities, each more terrifying than the last.

 Is someone stalking me? Have I been robbed?

 I move into my bedroom. The bed is completely rotated—the mattress faces the floor, the blanket is buried beneath it, the frame crushing it even deeper into the wood. I turn every corner cautiously, expecting an armed burglar, a masked invader.

 With a shaking hand, I reach the cupboard and yank it open. I scream and begin stabbing into the dark interior—but there's no one. Just shirts. Hanging upside down on their coat hangers.

 I soften my steps, creeping to the bathroom. Even the toothbrush holder is upside down. The bottles, the soap dish, the razors—gravity-defying as if I’m in a dream.

 I keep closing my eyes, waiting to open them up in the safety of my bed.

 But it’s still there. Flipped. Mocking me.

 My phone rings—the sudden noise pierces the silence like a gunshot. I scream, grabbing it.

 My manager’s name glows on the screen.

 I answer.

 “He-hello, Miles,” he says, stuttering slightly. “Is everything alright? You left so suddenly. Got everyone shaken up.”

 “No. I’m not well right now. I just came home and found my whole place flipped upside down,” I say, wiping sweat—cool and slick like melted ice—off my brow, and the tears running like raindrops from my eyes.

 “Shit…” he mutters. Then, lowering his voice, softer now: “...Has the place been ransacked?”

 “No. Strangely… everything is here. But it is all—quite literally—upside down.”

 “That sounds completely absurd.”

 “Well. Imagine seeing it for yourself.”

 “Couldn’t if I tried. Look, Miles, why don’t you take a few days off? Get yourself right, then come back in next week. I feel you could use it. I understand it’s been a year since—”

 “I appreciate that,” I interrupt quickly. “I’ll take you up on that.”

 “Good… good. We’re all thinking of you. We’re concerned.”

 “Scared of me, more like it,” I think, biting my tongue to keep it in.

 “Thank you,” I say aloud, ending the call.

 As the line clicks dead, I hear something.

 Faint whimpering.

 Not human.

 A dog’s.

 Bella.

 I bolt toward the sound, racing down the hall. I find her under her bed, trembling like she’d seen a ghost. I flip the bed off her and cradle her against me, trying to calm her, whispering into her ears.

 But then… something strange.

 My hand passes over her head… then over her ears… then into nothing.

 I do it again.

 And again.

 The clip in her ear. It’s not there.

 I freeze. My heart tightens.

 That’s not my dog.

 It looks exactly like her—same coat, same collar—but it isn’t Bella.

 Someone replaced her.

 I drop her.

 She hits the floor, then sprints out the open front door.

 “Bella!” I scream, lunging after her.

 “Bella!”

 I tear through the backyard, flinging the door open with such force it slams into the wall. I scream her name again, again, again.

 No response.

 I scour the garden. The bushes she’d hide in when she was sick. The patch under the stairs. The corner behind the trash bins. Nothing. No trace.

 I fling open the shed door—even the shelves inside are upside down. But no Bella.

 Hours pass. I’ve flipped the house back to normal as best I could. The couch had fought me. Everything fought me. But eventually, I collapsed into it—breathless, broken, defeated. I scroll through my phone. I comb through every message I’ve ever gotten. Months back. Random requests. Someone asking to borrow a tool. A ride. No threats. No clues. No sign of a stalker. Just normality. Plain, forgettable conversations. And yet…

 Someone replaced my dog.

 Why?

 I drop my phone. Bury my face in my hands, fists pressing into my knees.

 “I think I’ve lost it,” I whisper. “This is it. The precipice. The line between the sane and the insane—and I’m falling.”

 My mind unhinges from logic. Slipping into something darker. Something less reasonable.

 Am I in some kind of simulation? Did someone change the code while I was sleeping?

 Am I being haunted? A restless spirit?

 The pale, emotionless man flashes in my mind again.

 That could explain it. But why?

 And then I remember. His lips. The words he mouthed.

 And again, like before… my blood freezes.

 “You know what you did.”

 My eyes well up with tears. A cold, painful realization slides in like a blade through the ribs. I turn my head toward the seat next to me.

 The one my wife had been sitting in.

 One year ago.

 As I do, I see her. Sitting there, unmoving. Unblinking. Staring into space—into the gaps between existence.

 Next to her, a mug—tipped over, contents long gone.

 “I remember you’d gotten sick,” I say quietly.

 “I remember taking care of you.”

 I rest my hand on her cold, bony shoulder.

 “You were impossible. I had to take leave just to be there. But you were never grateful.”

 Her head begins to turn.

 “I couldn’t stand being around you… but I had no choice.”

 “So I just… hurried the sickness along. I had to.”

 “I poisoned you.”

 Her mouth opens. A breath escapes—thick and fetid, like the inside of a rotting deer.

 I close my eyes.

 The stench vanishes.

 I open them again.

 She’s gone.

 The house—flipped right side up.

 Then, a bark.

 Through the hallway—

 Bella.

 I rush to the bathroom, splash cold water on my face. Tears blur my vision. I look up, meeting my own reflection. I run my hands through my hair, brushing it back to see clearly.

 Every detail of my face. Unshrouded.

 But just for a moment… I swear the reflection lagged behind.
