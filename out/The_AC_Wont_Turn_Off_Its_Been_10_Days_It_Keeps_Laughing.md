I was going to bed after a long day of travel, and I was ready to get comfy in my blanket, turn on the AC and the fan. I pick up the AC remote and put it on 16 degrees celsius, and eventually fall into a deep sleep.
At around 4:33 am, I wake up and start to sneeze from the cold. Not strange, it actually always happens since I get triggered from the AC for whatsoever reason. I try to grab the ac remote control, but it gets knocked down instead. 

With my eyes half open and half closed, I look for the control on the floor while on my bed and pick it up and click the power off button. Nothing. I try again but this time I point the remote control to the AC, so the sensor can understand. Again, nothing happens. It doesn’t turn off. 

It was my first night in this hotel, I was new in town so I needed a place to stay and chose this hotel. I start repetitively pressing the power off button, and become more vigorous with it but still it wasn’t turning off. I slowly stand up on the bed and approach the AC, right in front of it, I hold the AC remote and press power off again. It doesn’t turn off, so at this point I decide to call the reception so they can deal with the broken remote control. 

While waiting for them to come, I try to look for a manual switch to turn it off but I don’t find anything. I hear strange noises coming from the AC, sort of like a laughing noise.
The staff arrived and they had a spare remote control in hand, they pressed the turn off button and it turned off. I wasn’t too shocked, it just meant my remote control had probably broke. They told me I could take the new one and I did.

They left, and I fell asleep in my bed once again. Only an hour or so later, I decided to turn it on again as it was unusually warm in the room, and it turned on. Just to test it, I tried turning it off but it wouldn’t.

I tried to make sense of the situation. The air was still blasting cold, the display on the AC glowing a steady 16 degrees. The chill in the room was biting, unnatural even for an AC set to such a low temperature. My breath came out in visible puffs, something I hadn’t noticed before. 

I decided to call the front desk again. Maybe it was just another faulty remote, and they’d bring me a new one. As I waited for someone to arrive, I paced the room, rubbing my arms to stay warm. That’s when I noticed it—the faintest sound, like a distant murmur. I paused, holding my breath to listen more closely. The noise was coming from the AC unit. It was subtle, almost like the low hum of the fan, but there was something off about it. It almost sounded... like a laugh.

I shook my head, dismissing it as a trick of the mind. I was tired, cold, and frustrated—my brain was probably just playing tricks on me. Moments later, a knock on the door snapped me out of my thoughts. The hotel staff had arrived with a replacement remote. I handed them the old one, explaining what had happened again, and watched as they pointed the new remote at the unit.

The AC clicked off immediately. Relief washed over me, and I thanked them, feeling a bit foolish for letting myself get so worked up. They left, and I crawled back into bed, finally warm enough to get some sleep.

But sleep didn’t come easily. Even after the room began to warm up, I couldn’t shake the unease that had settled over me. I told myself it was just exhaustion, but deep down, something didn’t feel right. And then, just as I started to drift off, the room began to grow warm—too warm.

Annoyed, I reached for the remote to turn the AC back on. The moment the unit powered up, I regretted it. The same blast of icy air hit me, but this time, something else came with it—a low, mocking chuckle. It was unmistakable now, like a voice hidden within the mechanical hum. My heart pounded in my chest as I tried to turn the AC off again, but the remote was useless. No matter how many times I pressed the button, the AC stayed on, the laughter growing louder, more distinct.

I lay there, staring at the ceiling, trying to ignore the cold that was seeping into my bones. Eventually, exhaustion won, and I fell into a restless sleep.

The next morning, the AC was still running, as cold as ever. I tried turning it off again, but nothing happened. I went about my day, telling myself I’d deal with it later, but when I returned that evening, the room was like a walk-in freezer. My fingers fumbled with the remote again, but it was useless. The AC wouldn’t turn off, and that damn laughter was still there, faint but constant.

Over the next few days, it became a relentless cycle. I’d call the front desk, they’d come up, turn it off with ease, and I’d feel like I was losing my mind. I switched remotes, unplugged the unit, even covered it with a blanket, but nothing worked. It would turn on by itself, blowing icy air that filled the room with a biting chill and that eerie, haunting laugh.

By the fifth day, I’d had enough. I packed my bags and checked out, determined to leave this strange hotel and its malfunctioning AC behind. But when I checked into a new place, my relief was short-lived. That night, as I lay in bed, the room suddenly grew cold. I looked up, and my heart dropped. There, mounted on the wall, was the same AC unit, identical in every way. And as soon as I noticed it, the laughter began again.

I tried changing hotels three times, but the cycle continued. Luckily, a new colleague of mine let me stay over in his house. I know I shouldn’t have trusted a stranger but I had, absolutely had enough. He took me to his bedroom and the AC was turned on. I was terrified at the thought of AC’s, but once I saw the AC, I realised it was not the same unit and it was different from all of the hotel’s AC. I thanked him, and I got comfy in the bed, and turned the AC off because I was too afraid.

Finally, no laughing, no giggles, no chuckling every time. The sudden quiet was disorienting. For the first time, the air was still, and the warmth of the room felt comforting. I finally won.

I woke up later at 4 am, and I couldn’t tell why I had woken up. From the heat? I wasn’t going to turn on the AC again, of course not. I put my hand on the blanket to take it off, but I couldn’t. I looked down to see why, my hand was frozen. Then the laughter erupted.

The AC was the same exact unit. Again.

I’m writing this at 6 am, with one hand, I can’t move any other limb. The AC was never an AC to begin with, It’s actua—
