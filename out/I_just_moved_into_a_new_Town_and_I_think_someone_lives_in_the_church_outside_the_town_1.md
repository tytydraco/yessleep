Tucked deep within a forgotten corner of the Midwest, surrounded by the towering pines, shrouds of mist and seldomly used trails of a vast national park, lies the small town of Ash Hollow (No, not the region in Nebraska). It doesn't have more than a dozen permanent residents and honestly the town feels more like the setting of a shitty mystery show then an actual place. The empty streets are usually blurred by the ever-present fog that clings to the forest at least four fifths of the Year and at the heart of "town" sits "Maggie's Diner", an old, silver-paneled relic from the 1950s.

It's the only place with regular hours and the flickering neon signs hum in the dark, reminding you they've probably been running, more or less non stop, for longer then you've been around. When you step inside the air usually smells of burnt coffee and cigarettes and the foresters and sheriffs gather here. They speak in low tones about strange tracks, sounds in the trees, and whatever they can lie about, just to hide just how boring their day was.

But once the sun slips behind the hills, that's when it truly dies out. A chorus of crickets fills the air, sometimes interrupted by the distant, haunting yowl of a mountain lion echoing through the ravines. You're probably more likely to meet Bigfoot, rather then another person walking about. Streetlights buzz to life but barely pierce the mist.  
Ash Hollow doesn't welcome strangers so much as tolerate them and most who visit don't stay long.

So of course - as you may imagine –it has been a blast moving there last month, when my father got an offer for a deputies position in this corpse of a town. I would love to tell you about the friends I have made since but I'm fairly certain, that the youngest resident apart of me is the 30 something year old guy running the hardware store near town center. A depressed looking caucasian man best described as "ordinary", although he feels more like the shell of an office worker, if you scraped the soul out from the inside.

I've gone by calling him "John Human" since his name tag only says "John". It's still a riddle to me how the store is held above water, as I've never seen a soul set foot into that store, of course counting out the one time I bought some batteries there for a flashlight.

I can still remember how John stood at the counter already when I first walked past the store, back then I didn't think it was too weird, but it already felt off-putting, his empty eyes, his posture. Something was wrong. As long as the store is open he always stands behind the counter. When I walk past he stands behind the counter. After my shift at Maggie\`s, on the way home he stands behind the counter. And he doesn't even look bored. When I told my dad about how strange I thought it was he replied "What, you mean that mannequin?". At least I'm not the only one who thinks hes weird.



John isn't the only strange curiosity you can find in this town though. As I just mentioned I work at Maggie's. I picked up the job a week after we moved here and serve the regulars their breakfast pie and afternoon beer. Maggie, my boss, is a woman in her mid 50's, a warm welcoming ginger woman of short stature. She is the kind of woman grandmothers would praise for not skipping her dessert.

Working at Maggie's for three weeks, I've by now met most of the familiar faces. One of the less noteworthy for example is Archie Donovan. Archie is a quiet man who gets a black coffee every morning. When he drinks it, right at the counter, he is always hunched over it and looks into the dark liquid as if it might hold the answer to some sort of riddle. When I asked Maggie what he works as she just shrugged.

But not every customer is as quiet as him. The most regular customer is Earl Whittaker, or "Old Earl". A retired farmer who usually orders a waffle with blueberries and syrup. He is mostly in a good mood and quite cheerful, which makes it all the more strange when he switches. Sometimes, especially in the evening hours, he will get very serious, very quickly. Then he will usually tell you about some local myth and warn you of the woods and the fog with furrowed brows and a dry coughing whisper-tone. After he tends to brighten up again. Maggie told me to ignore it but every time it happens it doesn't sit quite right with me.



But now to the important part. I'm not sure what the reason I'm posting here is. Maybe To find help, advice or whatever possible explanation there could be for the events I'm about to tell you, but honestly I think I just want to tell someone about it and not be called crazy. To get it off my chest.



Two days ago, it was a quiet day. It was likely the rain was to blame for the slow traffic in the - even more then usually - empty diner. Maggie wasn't in today, leaving me alone to handle business. Earl sat at his Table alone and not even the sheriffs stopped by after their shift, leaving the air thick and the room so quiet you could hear the fridge hum faintly in the corner. After burning through a cigarette earl coughed into his fist and got up. He was at least around 90 years old and every time he stood up you could see how much he struggled with it, however he'd refuse any help and shoo you off with one hand if you offered it. After he made his way over to the counter, his steps on the red checkered floor slow and careful, he opened his mouth, as if to say something, but closed it again.

"Waffles with syrup?" I asked him with my customer-service smile. He cleared his throat before his dry rustling voice escaped his crusty lips. "Kid" He coughed again. "Stay clear of tha chapel, will yer?". He looked at me with a hint of concern in his stiff eyes. They were sunken in deep, to a point where you could make out his eye-sockets clearly. The chapel he talked of, was an old small church, 20 minutes out of town. A majority of the scary stories I've been told by now revolved around it and I had yet to go there even once, admittedly though I really wanted to.

"I didn't plan to go there." I half lied half honestly answered, before clearing my throat, when I heard just how dry my voice got. Earl nodded and shoved a dollar into the tip jar with shaky hands before he walked out into the rain with his cane.



Frankly I had been curious about the chapel for a while.

I really hoped to hear Maggie´s usual "don't bother with him, honey", to get it out of my mind and move on with my shift, but I was alone in the diner. The quiet was louder then ever now, leaving me to my thoughts. Id lie to myself if I told myself I hadn't toyed with the thought of going to that place, a place eerie enough to inspire all these stories. But then again I've seen enough horror movies to know why going to the haunted evil forest church may be a bad idea. Especially now that I had been warned of it. On the other hand they were just Movies and reality tended to have a lot less ghosts from my experience.

I couldn't ask dad to accompany me as he worked in the late afternoon hours until late. Most likely he wouldn't even go. I sure as hell wouldn't go there at night and I wasn't sure who else could accompany me on this trip.

"Maybe I can ask John Human if he wants to come." I said to myself with a chuckle.

But no, i´d have to go there by my own. Honestly it was kind of ironic how the old geezers warning had given me the push I needed to finally make a plan to go, how it reignited a morbid curiosity, that had slumbered for some time now.

Now before you throw rocks at me for not taking his warning seriously, please consider that this warning came from the same man who warned me about the Wendigo, Moth-man and other folklore creatures. Saying he lost his credibility was an understatement.



Sundown that day was around nine so I would have about an hour and a half after my shift to go and have a look.

After closing the diner and locking the doors behind me, no customers having come until closing hour, I soaked in the fresh humid air. The rain had stopped. It was foggy out, but at least not "cant see jack after 3 feet" foggy, as Maggie liked to call it. The treeline seemed to hold most of the fog from pouring onto the road and I could see fairly far.

Passing the hardware store, its sign reading the creative name "Hardware Store", I could see John Human behind the counter, expression blank as usual. Honestly by now I would be more weirded out if he didn't stand there one day. I waved once and as usual got no reaction.



After walking along the main road for ten more minutes I stopped at a lone sheet of paper, stapled against a telephone post. "Missing: Jessica Albert". Below there were ripoff phone numbers, none removed. I always wonder if those people where found by now or if they were still missing, when I spot these missing person posters. They are usually at least ten years old and ever since moving here this was the third I found. But I shrugged it off and kept walking, mostly because the spot, that the hunter in the diner told me about roughly a week ago, was already in sight. Right at a part of the road, where there stood an abandoned brick house - lonely and only one story tall, no windows in sight, a path strayed straight into the woods. Here I would have to leave the main road. If I still wanted to see the chapel in daylight I should get a move on.

After about 25 minutes outside of Ash Hollow the Chapel was Visible at the end of the winding forest path. Its white, washed facade shining at the paths end, piercing the foggy veil like a ghost. With each step the trees slowly let go of its walls and their greedy twigs moved aside to reveal the chapels crooked bell-tower and how its entire left side was hanging into the lake like a limping dog.

The muddy water pierced by the abandoned and flooded graveyards tombstones looked dirty and had a mossy green tone. The pond must have been fairly shallow there, but somehow it felt deep like the sea. I had heard so many different ghost stories about this place and looking at it now I understood why. A hunter at Maggie´s once said that every now and then he would find bare human footsteps leading into the chapel.



While I didn't expect to find said footsteps, nor any of the other stories, including ghosts and other oddities, I was drawn to it by an almost unnatural curiosity.

With every step I took the air felt thicker and thicker. The forest seemed to hush, neither the birds nor the bustling leaves daring to break the silence. It was dead quiet except for the mushy sound of my shoes in the grassy wet dirt floor. A closer look revealed how the weathered wooden board paneling seemed to be holding on for dear life. The colour was washed off by the weather and the spacing between the boards was almost fully filled with dirt and moss, ants walking along the houses stone base into a hole in the wall. Around two meters next to the main entry, the lake began swallowing the chapel. Hadn't I known how long it had been like this already I would have expected it to slide and sink into the water any second now. It was easy to imagine how the entire house would just slowly glide into the lake like it was some sort of bottomless pit, but it must have stood firmly for at least a hundred years now.

Another five steps and I stood at the doorstep. The inside was eerie to say the least, the benches and altar were standing, almost too neatly for how abandoned this place was. Stained glass from shattered windows laid across the floor. The white paint on the furniture was faded but far less damaged then the outside. The fairly tidy state everything was in, not counting the vandalized windows, was by far not the weirdest part about the chapel though. On the stone plate of the dusty altar laid a single wilting flower. Apart of that the room gave barely anything interesting for my curiosity to be stilled. I was a little disappointed, but also kind of glad. A closer look at the flower showed it was a Daffodil, at best two days old and the thought someone was here, even recently, made me uneasy. So after one last look around I decided to leave the tidy and bare room again, even though I had only just set foot into it. Outside, the sky was slowly turning orange as the sun was slowly hiding behind the treeline, the sunset bleeding into the ponds reflection.



I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but something felt off. It took me a minute to realize the chapel looked bigger from the outside then the room just had been. Careful not to tread into any puddles in the tall grass I circled it. After a while I found what I was looking for on the chapels side. On a small muddy island at the waterlogged side of the Chapel, surrounded by water there was a single grey door. From here the building seemed so devoid of color the bright orange sky made it seem black and white. I would have to hurry on my way back if I didn't want to walk in the dark, but I was determined to have a look at the door. I regret being that curious now, but I didn't know any better.

Before climbing atop the overgrown graveyards wall, it only breached the ponds surface by around a foot, I brushed some moss of the stone, so I wouldn't slip. If I was careful I could get to the door without getting my feet wet. While it felt like a sacrilege to use the old mossy tombstones as steppingstones, I didn't really want to put my feet into the dirty water either and arrived at the muddy island after 5 steps and one leap. The ground making a wet squelching sound as my already weathered converse sunk around an inch into the Mud from the impact, receiving an involuntary brown paint job. The jumps momentum and the way my feet slid about two inches in the mud brought me to my hands and knees.



After the shock from slipping wore off, a chill ran down my spine, slowly like dripping cold water. Between my hands there was a human footstep, not of a shoe or boot like I now left them, but just bare and naked. They led out the lake and straight to the door. It was probably just someone who didn't want to get their shoes wet... right? I tried not to think much of it as I now set my attention to the door. Looking up at it I only now noticed how the chapels bell tower was towering above me. The chapel being crooked and askew, leaning over me like a dark giant.

Only now did the idea, to stand right under it, appear to be mildly dangerous to me, but going back now felt silly. I brought my attention back to the door. It was a rusty metal door, detailed and ornate. Its grey paint was flaky and had obviously seen better days, slowly being swallowed by the rust that seemed to originate from the lock and the hinges. There was no doorknob, only a metal door-pull next to the lock, rusty and frail. Curiosity got the better of me and right away I gave it a gentle tug. The door didn't even budge. Once more I was disappointed, although I'm not sure if I'd be brave enough to set foot inside had it opened. I tugged again, harder, yet still to no avail.

After all my attempts left me empty handed I decided to at least lay my ear on the door. It was still dead quiet to a point where I heard my own heartbeat, so it was easy to focus on what I could hear from the inside, although I wasn't sure what to expect. After nothing for a couple of seconds, my heart skipped a beat. I heard someones breath. Right on the other side. A lump formed in my throat and it took a couple of seconds for me to rationalize, that what I heard was most likely my own breathing. With a nervous laughter I took a deep breath in an attempt to lower my pulse again and my hands weren't shaking, but I could feel the adrenaline in them. I didn't dare to put my ear to the door again, scared of discovering my paranoia to be rooted in reality.



Slowly a small cloud pushed before the sun and I realized how dark it would be without it. The sun would be swallowed by the horizon soon and while I always had a flashlight on me it was high time to start my return. I didn't really like the idea of walking all the way back in the dark, however realistically by now I would at best have five more minutes of sun. The first stone, the one I jumped off earlier was luckily not too far and I could still reach it, without getting more then my feet wet. The other stones didn't cause me any trouble either. Fairly quickly I had made my way back on land and half walked, half jogged back around to the entry.



I picked up my backpack and made my way toward the forest and as the suns last rays fled up the treetops I was left without direct sunlight by the time I made my way half way across the field. The chapel around fifty meters across the plains behind me still stood tall and silent, the wind having returned and brushing through my hair. I stopped to reach into my backpack, pushing aside my water-bottle and my keys at least 4 times before finally laying my fingers onto what I was looking for. Turning on the flashlight I instantly regretted not taking the massive heavy kind my dad used for patrol work with me and deciding to grab the small more handy looking dinosaur themed one. I had got it out a magazine when I was 9 and barely ever used it before, but it sure fit into my bag better. The flashlights rays were barely reaching about a meter in diameter and its pathetic light was barely enough to lead the way. But it had to do.



It was only about twenty more meters that I walked when I heard its awful sound.

* *- GONG*



The chapels bell made me turn a full 180 degrees in an instant. But it didn't leave it at one time.

* *- GONG*
* *- GONG*
* *- GONG*
* *- GONG*
* *- GONG*



It was only after its sixth ringing when I was able to think again and started to break into a sprint toward the forest line, by now only a good twenty to thirty meters away. I didn't stop to run, even when I noticed I had strayed off the path. I knew what direction to run and that was enough.

After running for what seemed like a good five to ten minutes, slowly running out of breath I felt something under my right foots step give way. Whatever I stepped on, felt like I just jumped onto a giant snail-shell, breaking the surface with a crunch. My foot sunk into something warm, followed by a wet sound. I tripped and fell over, barely managing to catch myself in the damp mixture of dirt and pine needles beneath me, my foot stuck in whatever I just stepped into.

When I grabbed and directed my flashlight to it, I could see fir. It was the body of a small deer, laid down in front of me, obviously dead, my foot ankle deep in its torso. Had I killed it? It was so frail it had to be dead already and I didn't hear it scream or breathe. But when my flashlight moved to its head, I was met with a sight that made me gag. Where there should be a head I was greeted with a stump, the wound not even clean cut. It honestly looked more like someone tore it off with brute force or cut it off with a sharp stone.



I felt my Stomach give way as I couldn't hold it in any longer, barely moving my head away from the deer before I emptied my gut. Slowly I remembered what I was doing before I fell and fear replaced shock again. I stood up, and spat out most of the taste that was still lingering on in my mouth. With a closer look, having to pull aside the soft fur to see my foot, I could see how from my ankle down my leg was lodged in between ribs, covered in blood. The sight reminded me of a bear-trap. I only closely avoided vomiting again as I bent the ribs aside with my hands, prying them open to release my foot. After I pulled it out I shook off any deer that remained sticking to my now red shoe before trying to orient myself again, having trouble to form some logical thoughts after what just happened.

I didn't exactly have a reason to run for my life like this yet, after all it could just be a really bad prank or something like that. My mind still had trouble to rationalize the situation. But honestly I was deathly afraid to get a reason to run. The thought, that whoever rang that bell might chase after me filled me with a sense of dread I don't think I've ever felt before. So running before I even found out if that was the case still seemed like my best option. It only took me about five more minutes, of what was by now more of a pitiful jog then a run, to finally see streetlights in the distance. Filled with new energy and determination I burst into a rush and broke out the forests bushy edge not even too far from my Home. I really only allowed myself to breathe properly after the door was closed shut behind me.  


A glance at the time revealed to me it was about twenty past nine now, still a good forty minutes until dad came home. I Limped into the bath and threw all my clothes onto a towel holder before showering. Had I overreacted? Honestly it doesn't seem far fetched someone was playing tricks on me, but who even in this godforsaken town would want to scare me like that. And now that I thought about it my day trip was spontaneous. Unless someone was coincidentally in the church it seems unlikely to me, that it was a prank. It was probably a homeless man, wanting to scare me away. But then again, a homeless man in the middle of the forest? It would be weird enough to find one even in Ash Hollow.

I showered off the blood on my foot carefully. It all washed off fairly easily and it didn't reveal any wounds on my leg. It seemed I was unscathed apart of some bruising and the scratches some thorns had left on me. The washing machine has by now also washed away most of the red color the deer left on my clothes.



I'm still scared and I haven't even talked to anyone, not even my father about this. I don't know if I will get any closure if I don't find out what happened there but I really don't want to go there again. At least not late and not alone. I don't know what to do. I haven't gone back to the chapel and I haven't looked for the deer again.
