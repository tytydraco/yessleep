Okay, so first... let me list all of the reasons why I think so. I'd like to hear if you agree or if someone can debunk this whole thing.

**bad events happening ever since we moved in**

Ever since we moved into our new home (which was around 8 years ago) we've had bad luck. My little sister got diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, only 2 years later we found out that my mother has breast cancer and only a few years left. My parents, to this day, fight and scream all the time, they've said that they will get divorced several times but they didn't. Everyone at home is constantly irritaded, depressed and confused. Our neighbours have started hating us. 

**it feels as if something is there and watching us**

I feel watched very often, especially in the dining room and upstairs in the bathroom and my bedroom. Sometimes I feel a tingling and I've even experienced something touching, even grabbing my shoulder, hands or feet. Again: most of it happens in the evening or at night. 

**strange, unexplainable occurances**

**incident 1:**

5 years ago my sister and I both abruptly woke up at exactly 3 A.M. (I know it's unbelievable) because we could hear a deep growling. It came from downstairs. We only had one dog at that time. After minutes of shaking from fear I gathered enough courage to go downstairs and get my dog. When we were upstairs in my bedroom again, the growling went on 2 minutes later but this time it could be heard upstairs (in our parent's master bedroom). I looked at our dog sitting next to us. She was sleeping peacefully. We called our parents because they were gone for night shift (my mother was helping my father out) but they just laughed at us.

**incident 2:**

I was in the bathroom brushing my teeth when I suddenly saw something moving from the corner of my eyes. Something invisible was lifting up the toilet paper sheet and when I turned to look I could literally see it going back to its original state (and that unbelievably fast). The windows and door were all closed, there was no wind whatsoever. I've tried everything. I moved around in every possible way but nothing caused for the toilet paper sheet to rise. 

**incident 3:** 

We have a huge mirror in the entrance hall. I once looked at myself in it and felt weird. It's like my body could sense that something is off. I could feel the negative energy coming from where I was standing. So I started waving my hands. Nothing. I started dancing. Nothing. And then I decided to just stand there and smile at my reflection. *My reflection wasn't smiling back.* My heart skipped a beat. I stepped back and it was still not moving. After a few seconds it was back to normal. 

**incident 4:** 

I was peacefully sleeping at night. That night I had decided to leave my bedroom door open. Suddenly, I abruptly awoke. I could feel a presence that my body was trying to alarm me about. When I looked towards the open door, I could see a humanoid figure sticking out its head from the upper doorframe. It had black soulless pearl eyes and a wide grin that revealed sharp teeth. It was thin to the bone and dark grey. I immediately screamed and called my father. It disappeared and my father came. He looked around everywhere but he couldn't find anything.

**incident 5:**

3 years ago, one summer night, my little sister and I went outside to play hide and seek with our flashlights. The additional rule was to catch the hider if you find them. My sister eventually found me and I immediately ran from our driveway outside into the alley. It was dark and only a few old street laterns were shining. Suddenly, I stopped. My whole body went tense and when I turned to the left, I knew why. I saw two apparitions. It was a woman and a man, arms intertwined, going for a walk. The man wore a hat and had a walking stick in his right arm while the woman had her hair neatly tied up into a bun and appeared to either wear an old-fashioned dress or a long skirt. They were walking extremly slow and in a weird manner. It almost seemed as if they were floating. The energy they exhibited was so negative that I immediately turned around and ran back home. After a minute my sister came walking towards me and asked me what the matter is. I said "That couple... something about them felt off. It's like they were stuck in a trance. They were walking down that alley as if they had no other choice but to do so." All my sister responded with was...

"What couple? There was no one there."

And that's where it hit me. I immediately ran back to go look for them. I searched for them everywhere... there was no one around.

**shadow figures**

I keep seeing shadow figures from the corner of my eye, rarely right in front of me. Flashes of light and smoke are also a common occurance. Even my sister reported having seen such things very often.

**flickering lights/someone playing with the light switch at night**

It only ever happens in our dining room or living room but the lights are constantly flickering (again: mostly in the evening). We've had several electricians come over to search for the problem only to find nothing. We also constantly change the light bulbs... only for the lights to start flickering again. 

At night I could sometimes hear someone or something playing with the light switch. You could hear it repeatedly clicking and the lights going on and out. Every time I went downstairs to check it immediately stopped. The rest of family consists of deep sleepers so they could never hear it. The weirdest part about it: It would always happen around 00:00. This type of activity stopped around a year ago because I had started ignoring it. 

**things disappearing only for them to reappear in the weirdest places**

This doesn't require any further explanation. All I'm gonna say is that I usually find them days later, completely hidden (for example under the couch or behind the cushions). This happens to every single one of us.
