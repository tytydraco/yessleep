Sometimes as I wander my daily path, so does my mind. At every moment I wish for a break from what I know the world to be. A constant waking nightmare, preserved for the most sinful of sinners. Doomed to live out their own Sisyphean tale.  My dreams by day or night are the solace I constantly crave from this familiar world. Familiar birds, familiar clouds, familiar grass, familiar sky. Familiar. A word I've grown to despise in the monotony that is my waking reality. When you have nowhere to go, you have no couch to surf, and no car to sleep in; all you can do is wander. 

That's why I've come to know these roads well; come to understand the personality that each holds. People see neighborhoods as a collection of homes in which people stay. This is not true. Neighborhoods, roads, streets, avenues; they all have a life of their own, and so does every house within them. Personalities that arise, not from the people; but from the place. A home, a true home is when a person or a family overcomes the personality woven into the house in which they stay. Morphing that personality into something new, something beautiful. A metamorphosis of nature, to nurture. However, when those families leave those homes or when those families lose their shine… they mutate back into what they once were. Being overrun by overgrown vines of hatred. Nature, reclaiming the house that once was a home. 

The personalities of these places in my little town were once again, all too familiar. A town that doesn't feel like anything special. A small downtown, and town center with shops and restaurants that are family owned. A sprawling suburbia, with houses that to some blend together. Some were bright and beautiful, full of life and promise. Some were dark, and sinister, lacking anything but the sun or moonlight that illuminates the yards. Regardless though, one thing that remained constant across all of them; was that I was not welcome. 

Whether I wake up in the alley behind Sal's Pizzeria, or whether I wake up next to a tree with the birds singing in the park; I always woke up estranged. From the planter boxes with spikes on them, to arm rests on benches that force anyone who wants sleep to sit up straight or leave. To shelters that wouldn't accept me, because the male only shelter closed; and the rest were only for women and children. To parents that crossed the street with their children to avoid even the possibility of an interaction. As if worrying eyes were meant only for the wanderer, I was forced to continue moving from one spot to another. So I might not end up with my freedom stripped for simply laying down in the wrong location.

Yet, with all my frustration, and all of the false assumptions about me… I understand. Those business owners don't want me driving away business, the city wants the benches to be usable for the people within it, and those shelters dealt with horrifying situations due to allowing a mixture of men, women and children. Even if those men are not me, I understand. 

So from sun up to sundown I continue. Down the same set of paths, roads, and corridors day in and day out. So much so that I knew my town like the back of my hand, even the foliage was too familiar to me. This town held thick rows of trees at every turn. Trees that could easily feel like visual white noise to those unfamiliar with the area. Yet every speck of dust, every tree, every house, as well as every person and argument I've seen them have; all mapped out neatly in my brain. 

So, you might be able to imagine how perplexing it was to me that on my daily walk to find my next place to lie down, a road I hadn't seen before suddenly appeared. Perched between two houses that I had seen more than most others in this town, there suddenly lie a long dirt path shrouded in rows of thick trees on either side. Trees that you could swear blocked out any inkling of light that might be able to reveal what lies ahead. Making the dirt road appear almost as black as concrete.

You might be thinking that I am just mistaken, that it must be an area that I just hadn't paid attention to. That I just overestimated my knowledge of this area, or maybe that I've simply gone mad. All those questions reeled in my mind as well, thinking back to every moment that I passed this very spot. Moments in my life that were many in number, yet as clear as day.  For this specific location, I knew there was no way I could be wrong. 

You see, I’ve called this town home for longer than I've lacked one. In fact I've called this town home for longer than I've even understood what a home even was. My oldest memories start when I was already in the foster system. I never knew my parents, and they never knew me. I had lived with them for a very short time, at a home that I could not remember even if I wanted to. When I got old enough, I went in search for them. I had found out that my parents were long dead. Not just deceased, but a death for which the police reports only made everything more confusing. What wasn't confusing was the address that was listed on the police report. 

When I visited that address, I had found that the home had been demolished. The lot on which it sat had been split in two, and two new houses lie on either side of the spot the home used to be, separated by only a fence. That was the same spot I found myself staring at now. Yet a road I had never seen now sat where the fence once was; and a feeling was bestowed upon me that I hadn't had to deal with since the monotony of my life had begun. Complete and utter darkness. Yet I found myself drawn to the oddity that I had found, and before I could even think about it I realized… I had mindlessly already begun walking. Walking the dark path devoid of light. Walking towards whatever lay ahead...
