*So there's this ESL teacher I know - let's call him* ***Mike****. He's American, born in the '80s, came to Shanghai around 2015 to teach English in an international high school. During Halloween 2019, he told this story to my friend Jason's English class. Still gives me chills thinking about it.*

\---------------------------------------

**Mike**'s German-American, grew up in Richmond, Virginia. Had this best friend since childhood - let's call him **Henry**, Italian-American kid. Their dads, **Big Mike** and **Big Henry** (Mike & Henry aren't their real names), were tight as hell - knew each other since they were kids back in the '40s, neighbors and all that.

When they grew up, Big Mike went to med school, Big Henry studied architecture. Then the '60s hit and LBJ started drafting everyone for Vietnam. Both guys got shipped out - Big Mike as an army medic specializing in orthopedics, Big Henry as infantry grunt fighting Charlie in the jungle.

It was fxxked up how it happened. Big Henry had barely been in-country a few weeks when a sniper's bullet shattered his left thigh. Lucky to be alive, they rushed him to a field hospital. And get this - the doc who had to amputate his leg? His best friend Big Mike. Can you imagine having to cut off your buddy's leg to save his life?

After the surgery, they sat there in that army hospital, Big Henry in a wheelchair, both of them just staring at the ceiling. "All this for what?" Big Henry said. "To spread ideology and grab territory? Send hundreds of thousands of kids to die as cannon fodder and destroy half of Vietnam in the process. What's the fucking point?"

They both decided to get out. Came back to Virginia and Big Henry got fitted with a prosthetic.

This was right when the hippie movement was exploding. These two war vets - Big Mike with his medical training and Big Henry with his new metal leg - they dove headfirst into the counterculture scene. Dropped out of their PhD programs halfway through, got into the whole peace-and-love thing: rock music, LSD, protest marches. The whole nine yards.

By the mid-'70s, when the movement started dying down, they finally got their shit together. Big Mike opened an orthopedic practice, Big Henry went back to drafting blueprints. Both got married, both had sons in the '80s - that's how we got little Mike and little Henry.

# -----------------------------

Just like their fathers, Mike and Henry were inseparable growing up. Same high school, basically brothers.

2000, Y2K year. Their graduation was on a Monday, and everyone's pumped as hell - except Henry. Kid looked like someone had died, just trudging through the crowd with this heavy expression.

"Hey bro, we just graduated! Summer vacation's starting, cheer up!" their friends were saying. "Where's your dad anyway? Thought I saw him here earlier."

Soon as they mentioned his father, Henry just broke down crying and ran toward the school building. Everyone's standing there like "What the hell?"

Mike followed him into the empty hallway and found Henry sobbing against the wall. In the dim light, Mike could see this tall, thin guy standing next to Henry - sharp dressed, wearing a little coppola hat, walking unsteady with his left leg clearly messed up. You could see the metal ankle of his prosthetic peeking out from his pants. The guy had his left arm around Henry's shoulder, right hand gesturing, lips moving like he was talking, but Mike couldn't hear a damn thing.

"What's wrong with your dad?" Mike asked.

Henry choked out through his tears: "My dad... he's had heart problems for years... day before yesterday around 10 AM... he was walking in the park and had a massive heart attack... neighbor found him coming back from grocery shopping, but by the time they got him to the hospital it was too late..."

Mike was like, "Dude, don't fxxk around with that kind of joke. Who's that guy making gestures next to you? That's your dad, right? I've known him since I was a kid, used to see him every weekend at your place."

Henry looked confused as hell: "What? Don't scare me like that!"

"I'm not messing with you," Mike insisted. "Before graduation started, I heard him talking to my dad. Said he just got back from a business trip to Charlotte, North Carolina, rushed back to Richmond just to see you graduate. Wasn't he sitting right next to my dad in the stadium? Right behind where your mom was sitting? I could see that prosthetic clear as day."

Weird thing was, Big Henry didn't respond to Mike at all. Just kept facing Henry, silently gesturing. And Henry couldn't see anyone except Mike.

Finally, Henry followed Mike out of the building to meet up with their friends for dinner. As they left, Big Henry waved goodbye to everyone and silently walked toward Henry's house.

\-------------------------------------------------

That night, around 1 AM, Henry was alone in his room looking through his yearbook, remembering all the good times from high school. He was getting tired, so he lay down on his bed with the yearbook, slowly drifting off to sleep.

Just as he was about to fall asleep, he felt someone gently stroking his hair and body. The touch was light and familiar, just like when his father used to comfort him as a little kid. He knew everyone else in the house was asleep, hadn't heard any doors opening - no way anyone could've come into his room. It was scary but somehow comforting at the same time, and Henry soon fell asleep.

That night, Henry had a vivid dream. He and his father were sitting together on the living room couch, surrounded by white light. Big Henry was squinting and smiling just like when he was alive, telling Henry about life lessons, speaking gently and deeply (though when Henry woke up, he couldn't remember a single word). Then his dad handed him a green leather journal - Big Henry's thoughts and reflections from when he was young. Henry opened to the first page and immediately woke up. The eighteen-year-old was already crying, tears soaking his pillow.

\-------------------------------------------------

Saturday morning - 7 days after Big Henry's death - they held Big Henry's funeral. Mike and Henry's families, plus Big Henry's old war buddies and hippie friends, all came to say goodbye. Big Henry's body had been cremated and buried in the community cemetery nearby.

Starting that night, Mike, Henry, and Henry's mom began experiencing some weird shit.

Tuesday around 1 AM, Henry's mom got up to use the bathroom and heard footsteps upstairs - that familiar rhythm of left foot heavy, right foot light, exactly how Big Henry walked with his prosthetic leg. She went upstairs to check. Empty hallway.

That whole week, Mike started having crazy dreams about Big Henry. Random fragments - sometimes Big Henry at his drafting table, sometimes intense jungle combat in Vietnam, sometimes him and Big Mike partying with their hippie friends, drinking and listening to music.

Thursday evening around 7:30, Henry was home alone doing homework when he heard a sharp sound from his dad's study. Scared the hell out of him. He opened the door and saw a framed blueprint lying on the floor - his dad's proudest architectural design, the one that used to hang on the wall.

Friday, everything suddenly stopped. The house went back to normal.

\----------------------------------------------

*The really freaky shit happened Saturday night of that week. Mike and Henry had the exact same dream: Mike, Henry, Mike's little sister, Henry's mom, Henry's aunt and uncle - all of them gathered in this "open courtyard of a building" (some scenes are hard to describe), standing around a fountain. In front of them were modern glass skyscrapers, behind them classical European palaces and gardens. It was drizzling, but the raindrops didn't get anyone wet.*

*Big Henry was there too, wearing his usual shirt and slacks, both legs perfectly normal, body completely healthy, but his expression was blank and peaceful. He just stood there silently, staring. Gradually, the drizzle turned into heavy rain, and everyone's hands started glowing with golden light, flowing through the space like liquid. All their light combined into this massive golden ring that surrounded Big Henry from head to toe.*

That's where the dream ended.

After that, Mike and Henry never experienced anything paranormal again.

\----------------------------------------

*This story was told to my friend Jason by Mike during a Halloween party in Shanghai. Mike swears it's all true. I've heard similar stories from other American expats - seems like these kinds of experiences are more common than you'd think. Whether you believe it or not is up to you, but the way Mike told it... there was something in his eyes that made me think he wasn't making it up.*

*(PS. I wrote this story in Chinese in June, and I translated it into Creepypasta style English using Claude 4.0.)*
