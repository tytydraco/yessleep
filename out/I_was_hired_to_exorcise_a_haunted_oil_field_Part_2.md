Edward sat down in one of the chairs and looked me dead in the eye. I sat across from him, lit a cigarette, and let the silence hang before I spoke.



"So, Mr. Edward… the thing haunting this place? It was here years ago. It's not something new. And I believe your company did their research before they started drilling here."



"They should’ve heard the rumors."



He narrowed his eyes. “How do you know about these rumors, Mr. Nox?”



I puffed and grinned. “I live around here, Mr. Edward. Long enough to know what people whisper after too many drinks. This field’s been cursed since long before your crew showed up.”



"So you mean that—"



Before that cocky boy even finished his sentence, I cut him off and answered in a mocking tone:



"Yes, Mr. Edward. Since you came to me, I knew about this place and the rumors. I always believed it was just that—rumors. But looks like it isn’t."



"So you were gonna scam us, Mr. Nox?"



"Of course. What was I gonna do—exorcise a thing that doesn’t exist?"



"But it does exist, right?"



"Yeah, it does. And I’ll take care of it. But there’s one thing I’m still not sure about."



"What’s that, Mr. Nox?"



"Who’s this ‘thing’ after? You, Mr. Edward—or me?"



"Why would it be either of us?"



"Because the ‘thing’ knows the workers aren’t the ones disturbing it. And if you’re gonna ask how—well, I don’t usually share these pro tips, but I’ll share with you."



I stood, walked to the window, and pointed out at the camp.



"Anyway, the ‘thing’ tried to scare the workers. And it was successful. But they didn’t leave—they couldn’t. Because you're keeping them here. But you… you showed up here with just me."



"And you're quiet. And I’m the one who angered it. So it could be after me. Or after you. We gotta see."



I turned back to him, smoke curling from my lips.



"How are we going to do that, Mr. Nox?"



"Well, Mr. Edward, we’re gonna spend another night here. In different containers. And I’m gonna tell you some things just in case."



"If the thing is after you, it’ll scare you. Whatever happens—don’t get scared. Resist the urge. Don’t run. Don’t leave. If you see something—close your eyes, then open them again."



I stared at him. He didn’t say anything.



“Now,” I said, standing up again, “get the fuck out and send me some alcohol.”



He left without a word.



A few minutes later, the workers brought the booze and the coal.



I told them to make a circle. Wide. Thick. Cover it with anything that burns.



“And don’t fucking disturb me,” I said, already cracking the first bottle.



Then, well… I got drunk. More than I should have.



By the time night came, I was a bottle in and slurring Latin prayers at the ceiling. I don’t remember lying down. I just remember the weight hitting me and everything going dark.



I don’t know how long I was out.



But when I opened my eyes, it was pitch black. The kind of black that doesn’t feel like nighttime — it feels like you’ve been buried.



I tried to move.



Nothing.



At first, I thought maybe I was paralyzed. Alcohol poisoning. Maybe I'd pissed myself and my brain was frying. But then I felt it.



A breath. Cold and wet.



A whisper of air across my chest, like something crawling over me but never quite touching.



Then a drop hit my forehead.



Thick. Warm. Not water.



Then another. And another. Slow, rhythmic. Like it was marking time.



And then — tapping.



Not random. It was deliberate. Knuckles, maybe. Fingers. A rhythm. On the walls. On the ceiling. On me.



My body was frozen, but my skin was screaming.



And the whispers started.



"Mr. Nox…"



"Nox…"



"Priest…"



"Priest Nox…"



Voices overlapping — deep, dry, distant — like someone whispering from inside my own skull. They knew me. They knew more than they should’ve.



Other names came too. Some I didn’t recognize. One I hadn’t heard in twenty years.



I closed my eyes.



I knew the thing was here now. Really here. Not a trick. Not a bluff.



I only opened them again when I heard banging at the door.



“Mr. Nox. It’s almost evening. Please wake up!”



It was the foreman.



I didn’t even sit up. Just croaked out:



“Did Edward die?”



“No.”



“Then nothing to worry about.”



"Mr. Nox, people want to see you. Please come out."



"Alright, alright. Shut your trap. I’m coming."



Ten minutes later, I stepped out.



I was a mess. Hair slicked with sweat. Eyes bloodshot. Shirt wrinkled, half-buttoned, stained with last night’s fear.



They all looked at me—this stumbling, hungover bastard—and realized their priest wasn’t a priest at all.



I gave them a glance. Just enough to remind them I wasn’t here to save anyone—I was here to end it.



Then I turned to the foreman.



"Everything ready?"



"Yes, Mr. Nox."



I raised my voice:



"Listen up. The thing’s gonna come at me tonight—this time to end me."



"You—stay at your windows. Watch my container. When you see me run out and light the torch, that’s your cue."



"Everyone gets out. Everyone lights the circle."



"Then I burn everything. Oil. Oily. Oil-related. I don’t care."



"And come morning, this thing ends."



"Be prepared. And send me breakfast and coffee. Oh, and cigarettes. I ran out."



Once again, somehow, I was their savior.



I went back inside and waited for dusk.



When night fell, the whispers came. Soft at first. Like a prayer said backward in a room you shouldn't be in.



I grabbed the book. Took the torch.



Lit the flame.



And ran.



I dropped the torch in the center, sat cross-legged in the dirt, and opened the book.



The workers moved like they’d rehearsed it. Coal lit up. The circle glowed.



And the oil—from everywhere—started flowing toward me.



It came in thick rivers, seeping through the cracks in the ground, oozing from pump valves, bubbling out of machinery like it had a mind of its own. It didn’t drip — it crawled, dragging itself across the dirt like veins searching for a heart.



And the moment the fire kissed it—



It screamed.



Not the ground. It. The thing inside it.



A sound tore through the earth—wet and wrong. Not human. Not animal. Like metal bending in grief. Like lungs filling with smoke and bile and hate.



The fire didn’t burn it like oil. It ripped through it. Like punishment. Like justice.



Flames ran along the black veins, racing back to whatever buried root the thing had. And as they reached deeper, the screams got higher.



Then came the shapes.



Faces—just for a second—bubbling up in the fire. Twisted, melting, mouths open in agony. Hands clawing from the mud. Not to escape. To pull the world in with them.



I kept reading. Louder. Faster.



The torch by my side roared. The circle glowed white-hot.



The smoke turned thick as tar, rising in columns that didn’t drift — they thrashed, like snakes trying to slither into the sky and being burned alive mid-climb.



It was dying. Not just burning — dying.



And it wanted everyone to feel it.



But no one moved.



Only me. Sitting in the center.



Reading louder.



And watching it end.



By dawn, the field was gone. Everything outside the fire line was ash and ruin.



But the air? Clear.



The whispers? Silent.



Phones started buzzing. Radios came to life. The curse lifted—like it had just walked away, bored of us.



The cars… they didn’t survive.



I call it collateral damage in my line of work.



The sheriff arrived late. He always does.



I got paid. Big.



My name went around. People talk.



But if there’s one thing I’ll say—and hear me on this—



If you ever hear whispers from your pipes…



Or see a hanged man in your backyard...



Don’t call an exorcist.



Burn the whole fucking place down.
