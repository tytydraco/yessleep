I always wanted to share this story, I'm not sure is this suitable to share it here... But I'll give it a try. English is not my native language, sorry if some part sounds weird...

Things happened 10 years ago, I'm not sure this is still happening or not.

In our country, we celebrate Haji, you can Google what is Haji for detail, but in short it is a day for Muslim praying and thanking the Almighty in mosques, and then perform Qurban ritual, sacrifice cows or goats.

tbh I'm not a Muslim, so I'm not very sure normally where do they celebrate Haji, but one of the place is high school (In my country, 10 years ago).

I still remember that was a sunny morning, we asked to gather at sports field. At first I dk what is happening, there's many students from other class, form a big circle. And inside the circle I saw my PE teacher digging a small hole.

"What's happening? Are we going to have some kind of sport here?"

"I don't care as long as I can skip (some subject, I forgot) class lol"

Me and my friend have no idea what is happening, until we saw our teacher leads three goats to the field, one male, one female and one child.

"Ah I see..."

Although we still DK what we celebrating, we know the goats are not going to have any good time, we all heard about it from our sisters, brothers, or whoever older than us.

After that one of my teacher started chanting, while my PE teacher with another PE teacher tie up the male goat.

The male goat sounds very angry, idk how to explain but it can tell from the noise he make. And then my teacher drag the goat to the small hole he just digged, and pin the goat head on the floor.

When the chanting finished, my teacher bring out a cleaver, sawing the goat neck until it have a big enough wound while the goat is in full conscious.

My god I swear I wasn't prepared for that, when my teacher start sawing the neck, I already can see there's a lot of blood come out, and the goat, that was the worst scream from an animal I've ever heard. I really don't know how to describe the sound, but it's not typical goat "baaa" but louder, it's more like a man using a very deep voice screaming "uhhhhhhh...".

Just when I was starting to think things couldn't get any worse, my teacher hand didn't stop sawing until the would deep enough to cut a big blood vessel or something, the blood start to flow out a lot.

And now I know why they dig a small hole on the field before slaughtered, so that all the blood will flow in to the small hole instead of making a whole mess like what you would see in snuff film. And I'm not even joking, if you close your eyes and listen, you will though someone opens a faucet at the field, but actually the sound is come from draining the blood of the goat. I forgot if the goat still screaming or not, but I think he just couldn't do it anymore.

When finish draining the blood, my teacher just drag it to aside, and prepare for another ritual. I think the goat still alive, because he still breathing rhythmically, he breath so hard that whole body twich every time when he trying to inhale some air. After 2 to 5 minutes, the goat finally stop moving anymore, no sign of life.

Mother goat and child goat witnessed the whole slaughtering, trying to run away. To bad they can't escape from the rope that leashed them, so the ritual continues. Same things happened to the mother, then the child.

So the ritual finish, we are asked to back to our classroom, continue our classes like nothing happens.

Then the corpses of the goats are not wasted, I believe they cooked to some delicious dish for students and teacher who just attended the celebrations of Haji. I forgot why I didn't eat any of it, because I was busy vomiting? idk

Anyway, this is how Haji celebrated in school in my country, 10 years ago. I'm not sure how does it sounds like to people from other country because I never share it before and I don't think anyone shared this before ðŸ¤”. Do let me know what do you think in the comments.
