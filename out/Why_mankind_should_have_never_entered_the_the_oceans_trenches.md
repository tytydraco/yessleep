I was a marine biologist, and I had dedicated my life to exploring the depths of the ocean. I had always been fascinated by the creatures that lurked in the darkness, and I had spent countless hours studying them. But there was one place that had always eluded me - a deep trench, unexplored by any human, that lay at the bottom of the ocean that had been recently discovered by my colleagues.

It was my dream to explore that trench, to be the first human to lay eyes on the creatures that lived there. And so, I set out on my mission, with my trusty submersible and a sense of excitement that was almost palpable. The journey to the trench was long and arduous, but I finally arrived at the mouth of it, and I knew that this was it. This was my chance to make history, to discover something truly incredible.

As I descended deeper and deeper into the trench, the darkness began to close in around me, and I could feel my heart pounding in my chest. But I pushed forward, my submersible's lights illuminating the way ahead of me.

And then, I saw it. A creature unlike anything I had ever seen before, a shapeless, gelatinous mass with thousands of appendages, feelers, and tiny legs sticking out of it as it moved, somewhat like a squid. It was massive, easily four times larger than my submersible, and it seemed to be staring right at me.

I froze, unsure of what to do.

Instinctually, I tried to back away, but my submersible was slower than the creature, and before I knew it, the creature was upon me. It slammed into my submersible with a force that nearly knocked me unconscious. I could hear my equipment rattling and the metal of the submersible groaning under the pressure.

I tried to regain control of the submersible, but the creature was too relentless. It continued to slam into me, its tentacles wrapped around my submersible, crushing it like a tin can.

I was thrown around in the submersible, my body battered and bruised as I desperately tried to find a way to fight back. But every time I thought I had a chance, the creature would strike again, its attacks becoming more and more vicious. I realized then that I was going to die. My dream of discovering something incredible was about to become a nightmare, one that would end with my body being crushed to a pulp by a monster from the depths.

But then, something strange happened. The creature, seemingly satisfied with the damage it had done to my submersible, began to retreat. Its tentacles unwound from around me, and it disappeared into the darkness. I was relieved, of course, but also confused. Why had the creature stopped attacking me? Had it simply gotten its fill of destruction, or was there something else at play?

I was fully silent for a moment, trying to process what had just happened. And then, almost as if on cue, the lights flickered back on. I had power again, and with it, a small glimmer of hope

As the lights turned on, I saw the distinct flipper the size of a fucking house belonging to a creature which must have been larger than a skyscraper slowly move. Whatever was attacking me hadn't retreated because of me, it was because of the bigger predator.

With a heavy heart, I began the ascent, my mind still reeling from the encounter with the creature.I pulled up to the surface, my body battered and bruised, but alive. As I was hoisted out of the submersible and onto the deck of the rescue vessel, I knew that I had seen something truly horrific. Something that I would never forget for as long as I lived.

Days later, back on land and recovering from my injuries, I couldn't stop thinking about the creature that had attacked me. I became obsessed with it, pouring over my notes and researching everything I could about the trench where I had encountered it. And then, one day, I stumbled upon something truly terrifying.

In 2019, there was a report that dead whales had washed up on the coast of Oregon, damaged and half-eaten. Whatever killed those, must have been huge.
