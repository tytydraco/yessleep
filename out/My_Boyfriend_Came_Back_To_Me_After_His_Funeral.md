I just wanted to see my boyfriend one more time. I miss him so much.

When the physical body dies, the soul doesn’t go straight to heaven or wherever it’s meant to go. It lingers for a while. But when a body receives its final blessing in the church, the spirit stays for just a little bit longer — and then it moves on. I know this because I live in the church as the sacristan. I see the ghosts — or spirits — of the dead at night, when the church is quiet. Sometimes, they even talk. They’re confused. Lost. But when they see the light — the invitation, I think — they’re gone. Like sparkling dust, scattered in the wind.

I’ve lived in the church for a year now. The priest told me to stay here for protection, and help with the daily activities. My father wants me dead. But he can’t touch me as long as I’m under the priest’s care.

The priest told me, “Everyone deserves to feel safe.” And I believe him. I am safe in the church.

My father wants to hurt me — physically. He says I brought shame to the family. He caught Miguel and I kissing in my bed room. Miguel was my best friend. We had been hiding our relationship since we were kids. We were the only boys in town, no girls around, and somehow… I just fell in love with him.

My father threw me out the moment he saw us. Told me never to come back.

Word spread fast. Everyone in town knew. My father — already a drunk — spiraled even more. He got wasted every night, started causing chaos. People said he’d go around shouting that he’d kill both me and Miguel.

Miguel died a few days later. A tragic accident, they said. Someone hit his motorcycle during the night. No witnesses.

The police came to the church and told me the details. It was brutal. They said he wouldn’t have survived. His helmet was split in half. One side of his face was still inside the other half of the helmet. The motorcycle was unrecognizable — and on fire when they found it.

They also asked if I’d seen my father. Said they just wanted to talk to him.

I told them I’d never speak to that man again. But if I saw him… I’d let them know.

Miguel’s body was blessed in the church on the day of his burial. I was the only person there, aside from the priest.

I stayed in the church after the service. I knew he might show up at night. Spirits often do.

He showed up — but not like the others. He didn’t appear inside the church. He stood outside, calling my name.

He wore the same suit he was buried in — with the bowtie I gave him on his 19th birthday.

He said he missed me. Missed my hugs. My kisses.

I’d never touched a spirit before. Only spoken to them. But I missed him so much.

I stepped outside. Every step I took toward him, the colder it got. Goosebumps ran up my arms. The hairs on my neck stood up.

He hugged me. I hugged him back. He felt like ice. He smelled like rotting flesh. But I didn’t care.

Then, as I pulled away, he grabbed my face.

His face changed.

It wasn’t Miguel.

It was a demon.

Its mouth stretched wide, grinning from ear to ear, revealing rows of rotting teeth. Its eyes were like a goat’s — yellow, twisted, and wrong.

I froze. I couldn’t move. His hand wrapped around my neck, choking me. I couldn’t speak. Couldn’t hear. Everything was black — just me and him, floating in nothingness.

I was suffocating. Twitching. Dying.

Then he released me.

I heard the priest’s voice. A Latin prayer I couldn’t understand.

I fell to the ground. The priest stood between us, holding a crucifix. Shielding me.

The demon backed away, slowly. Still grinning. Then it vanished — just like that.

The priest dragged me back inside. Told me never to speak of it again.

⸻

A year has passed. I still live in the church. I haven’t seen Miguel since. But I still hope — every night.

Then one night, while I was closing the doors, I saw someone sitting in the last pew.

It was my father.

Not alive.

A spirit.

He was sobbing when I approached. Wearing a hospital gown. I sat in the pew in front of him.

He spoke to me.

Said he didn’t kill Miguel. Didn’t know who did. Said he died of a heart attack — from drinking too much.

He said he was sorry. That he loved me.

And then a light appeared. So bright it filled the whole church.

His body turned to sparkling dust.

And just like that — he was gone.
