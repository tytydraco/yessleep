That’s the question two frail-looking men asked me — white short-sleeve button-ups tucked into black shorts, knee-high socks and black ties. They were pale, hair slicked back, eyes sharp, grinning from ear to ear. Why did I even answer the door? I never do for this sort of thing; people like that are usually about to ask if I’ve accepted Jesus into my heart or whether I’ve considered Mormonism — something along those lines. But I was wrong. These men didn’t care about religion or which organization I might hand my money to for peace of mind and comfort in death. No — they wanted something far, far stranger.



I cleared my throat and asked what they wanted. One of them smiled wider and said they were representatives of a group of “Analyzers,” documenting human lives. They wished to come in, to speak further.

“No,” I said flatly, already shutting the door.

But before it clicked shut, one of them slid his foot into the gap. Through the narrow crack, he slipped me a card, telling me to call if I ever changed my mind.



I carried on with my Sunday morning: sat in my chair, turned on the television, and checked my phone. An alert from my banking app told me my account was overdrawn — great. As I set the phone on the side table I saw the two men standing in the field outside my apartment, staring at me and smiling. I stormed outside to confront them, but they were gone. I called the number on the card they’d slipped me and listened to hold music while I waited to chew someone out.



After a few minutes the hold music cut out and a bright, robotic woman's voice came on, too friendly to be real. “Thank you for calling. Please remain on the line. A customer-service representative will be with you shortly.” It guided me through a short automated script — name, address, nature of inquiry — each question answered by my own startled voice. Then, in the same flat tone: “A representative team has been dispatched and will arrive shortly.” Before I could tell it I hadn’t asked for anything, there was a firm, measured knock at the door.



I swung the door open. The same two men stood there, identical smiles pasted on. “We’d like to come in,” one said.

“You were standing outside my sliding door,” I snapped. “Watching me.”

They both looked shamefaced for a moment. “We apologize,” the other said, voice carefully measured. “We only wish to explain.”

“Explain what?” I asked, but the words came out sharper than I intended. I told them to wait a second, closed the door, and moved like I always did when something felt off — grabbed the gun from the drawer and tucked it into my waistband.



When I opened the door again I kept my tone flat. “Fine. You’ve got three minutes.” I stepped aside and let them in, keeping an eye on them as they crossed my threshold. I guided them to the couch and sat opposite, the TV murmuring in the background, every muscle ready. They sat back like polite guests. One cleared his throat. “I’m Chuck,” he said, offering a small, practiced smile. The other added, “Gibby.” Both voices were soft, too precise. “We represent a company that studies, analyzes, and documents human behavior — on a very personal, intimate level.”



I felt my jaw tighten. Chuck pushed a thick book across the coffee table and tapped the cover to reveal it to be a contract. “We’re offering five thousand dollars,” he said simply, “to document your entire week. Twenty-four seven. From using the bathroom to going to work — everything, recorded for our analysis.”

Gibby watched me like someone waiting for a diagnosis. The words hung in the room, clinical and obscene. I wanted to say no so bad, but the money problem I was having made it an easy decision for me, no matter how odd it was.



My face must’ve said it all, because I didn’t bother to hide how disgusted I was. “You’re out of your minds,” I muttered, leaning back in my chair. Five grand to watch me take a piss? Not a chance.

But then my phone buzzed. Another alert from the bank app: **Immediate Attention Required.** My stomach knotted. Rent was due. Bills were stacking up.

I looked back at Chuck and Gibby. Their smiles hadn’t moved an inch.



“…Fine,” I said, the word sour in my mouth.

Without missing a beat, Chuck reached to open the telephone book sized contract. “We suggest you read it thoroughly,” he said smoothly, sliding a pen across.

I flipped through a few dense pages filled with fine print, then skipped straight to the back and scrawled my name on the dotted line. Both young men smiled.



The two of them left the moment my pen lifted from the page, saying only that my case worker would arrive shortly. The apartment felt heavier after the door shut, silence pressing in on me. I wondered if I’d just made the dumbest mistake of my life—but five grand was five grand.

I headed toward the bathroom, still chewing on the thought. But when I pushed the door open, a man dressed exactly like Chuck and Gibby was already there—sitting on the toilet, clipboard in hand, scribbling furiously.



“Hello, sir,” he said without missing a beat, standing to let me pass. “Please proceed with your day and act as if I am not here.”

He planted himself against the wall, pen scratching again, eyes darting between me and his notes. I froze in the doorway, unable to move, until he stopped writing and looked at me directly—waiting, smiling faintly—while I just stood there in shock. I decided against the bathroom.



The rest of the day was utterly bizarre. The man shadowed me around the apartment, scribbling notes at everything I did. When it was finally time for bed the problem only got worse. He watched as I tossed and turned, jotting down the occasional observation while I shifted from side to side. Does he not need sleep? Will someone come for a shift change in the middle of the night? Why the hell did I agree to this?

Those questions looped through my head until my early-morning alarm ripped me awake and it was time to get ready for work.



He was still there. Standing in the exact same spot where I’d last seen him before sleep, pen scratching across the clipboard as I stretched and silenced my alarm. Already on edge, I pushed past the irritation and got dressed for work, his presence trailing behind me like a shadow.

Something inside me finally snapped. *Enough.* I decided then and there I was leaving without him. If he missed the ride, that was his problem, not mine.



I bolted for the door, keys in hand. He tilted his head as I sprinted, calmly jotting more notes as if my outburst was just another line in his study. I dove into my car, started it up, and tore down the street. *Ha! Choke on that!* I thought, grinning as the city blurred by.

When I pulled into the lot at work, there was no sign of him. Relieved, I walked inside, dropped into my chair, and soaked up the rare peace of being alone again. That moment didn’t last long. My phone rang—it was my mom.



I grabbed the phone and answered. “Hey, Ma—”

Her voice cut through me, ragged and high. “There’s a man in my room. He—he was watching me sleep and writing things down. I woke up and asked him what he was doing and he said—he said you broke the terms and conditions. He said *you* broke the terms and conditions!” Her words tumbled over each other, panicked.



“What?” I sat down hard, the blood draining from my face. “Ma, where are you? Is he still there?”

“He’s sitting on my bed beside me with a clipboard. He won’t leave. He keeps repeating something about a breach. What does that even mean? Why is he in my house? Why is he saying it’s because of you?” Her voice shook so badly I could hear it over the phone.

I opened my mouth to answer and found nothing that made sense. “I—I signed something,” I heard myself say, small. “But I don’t know what he means by—by ‘breach.’ I’m coming over.”



“He’s grabbing my wrists—he won’t let go,” my mom gasped, breath ragged. I could hear the scrape of fabric and the thud of furniture in the background, and then, impossibly, another voice — flat, clinical, right behind her words — said, “Come quick.”
