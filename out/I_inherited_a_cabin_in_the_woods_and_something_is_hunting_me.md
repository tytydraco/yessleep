Now, I think it's important for me to go ahead and say that I've never believed in supernatural or urban legend creatures. I've found it hard to believe that most of them exist, but a certain set of events has made me think otherwise. I have always loved to hunt. It's been one of my favorite activities since I was young. When I got the news of my grandfathers death I was sadden I got on plane and flew to Arizona as quick as I could. I was then informed that The cause of death was apparently a suicide, which threw me off because I remember my grandfather being a very happy go lucky person.

I arrived in a small town in Arizona little ways from Navajo country and attended the funeral, it was a small funeral about 5-7 people and consisted of family and friends I recognized everyone’s face except one persons. It was a man who was tall and dark with eyes that had a certain other-worldly hunger to them we made eye contact and I felt him looking into my soul he then whispered the words let me help you. I blinked and the man was gone I was returned to reality by my mother calling out my name but I didn’t see her I followed the sound of her voice to a room where a man at a desk was reading what I assumed to be my grandfathers will. My mother got $100,000 and my grandfathers 2013 Nissan Altima, the benefits of being an only child I guess. We knew my grandfather was a well off man but we never knew how well off the surprises didn’t stop there, I was caught off guard when I was named the new owner of my grandfathers luxurious log cabin in Hunters creek.

After the reading my grandfathers will I soon called and quit my job and was happy to start my new life away from the city in Arizona. Moving there wasn’t really a hassle I didn’t have that much stuff and the cabin was furnished with nicer furniture than I’ve ever seen before. I walked up to the bed room and was over taken by the beauty of it, it had a kings bed with a walk out balcony separated by sliding glass doors the sight from the balcony was breath taking, I could see hunters creek and the border of the forests edge. I knew I would love my new life here in Arizona when I saw that view.

At 3:30am I was awoken by the most vivid dream I had experienced no it wasn’t a dream it was a nightmare it was almost as I was actually there I now know that I was looking through the eyes of someone or something. It started with in the forest pacing around it was I would say 300 feet from my cabin to started moving towards it stepping through the steep brush and up a tree to get to the area right to where it could see me sleep. I then woke up terrified I began seeing branches shifting in the trees as the wind howled a sinister cry. I pickup up my phone and used the flash light to flash it in the last direction I saw movement...nothing I sighed, I must be imagining things because of the nightmare I just had what scared me about the dream was how real it felt. I stayed awake processing what had just happened I don’t k now when but I eventually fell back to sleep.

I woke up around 8am in the morning remembering what had happened I don’t know why but I laughed at myself because at the time I thought I was getting worked up over nothing I should’ve just left then and there but I stayed. Not understanding how weird what had just happened was the day was a blast, I swam,fished,and hiked a little bit and I had a giant fish fry that night after stuffing my face with trout I walked out to my balcony and soaked up the beauty of the land. After watching the sunset I decided to call it a day as soon as I got to my bed I instantly thought about what happens last night now it was dark and quiet out I felt afraid I tried and tired but I couldn’t fall asleep. Around one when I was beginning to fade I got hit with an overwhelming amount of dread I was instantly wide awake I popped out of bed with my flash light and baseball bat something was clawing at my door. It was followed by one of the worst sounds I have ever heard in my life it sounded like a woman screaming like she was getting murdered combined with this low demonic growl god it scares the absolute piss out of me thinking about this I stayed in my room with the door lock in my closet.

As if things couldn’t get worst I started to hear someone or something fiddling with the door down stairs I remembered last night and the dream I had and I thought to myself I’m gonna die. I guess I passed out from fear because when I opened my eyes it was morning it was then I decided that I would need to get a gun I walked out dressed and walked out the door noticing the huge gashes left in my cabin door. I arrived at the gun store and purchased a 12 gauge shot gun and some buck rounds the cashier then said to me in a rough deep southern voice”I noticed you moved into the cabin around hunters creed Navajo speak I’ll about that land they say stuff out of the ordinary goes on out there everyone who goes hunting up there goes missing later only to be found mangled in inhuman ways.” I told him that I had inherited it from my granddad and then his face fell showing sadness he replied “I knew your granddaddy son we use to work together we were like best friends before he just got up and left one day. Didn’t tell me where he was going, just handed his notice in, and left. He was acting extremely strange, beforehand. Talking about something in the woods, a creature who would cook and eat flesh. He said he could smell the burning meat on a night and then he would have horrible dreams. He started sleepwalking and we would find him in random places in the woods. He was an old man and we just assumed the stress of those Navajo stories was taking its toll, so no one really battered an eyelid when he left. We just assumed he had retired.

He then pulled out a slip of paper and slid it to me “We found this when we found his dead body”. The note read I wish to apologise to who may find me, but you must know, this was for the greater good. Every word, every Chinese whisper, every single ounce of fear we create for it – it grows. If it grows, it will soon walk the earth. It MUST NOT WALK THIS EARTH. It is in my head, I can’t unsee what I saw that night in the woods. With my death, it must find a new victim This will no longer be me. However, if it is you, he seeks out next, please don’t make the mistakes of others.

“What does he mean by it!?” I asked in a panicked frantic voice. He means the skin walker son I know you city folk don’t believe in this kinda of stuff but please hear my words move out of that cabin right now. And with that I took my newly purchased gun and shotgun shells and headed back to the house to ponder about what I heard. I want to say I believed him, I want to say I moved out as quick as so could but I didn’t I didn’t believe what the old man at the gun store was talking about and I dismissed it. I wish I did because night two was the worst and last night of my life.

I woke up at 3:30 to walk downstairs and get a glass of water and noticed how quiet it was in the night usually there would be insects and frogs making noises but this night was very quiet. That was when I heard it faintly but close outside my cabin I’ll try my best to describe it, it sounded like the bleed of a goat and the yowl of a wild cat coming together to seem so broken in form. Quiet at first it was accompanied by the clacking and scraping sound getting closer and closer to my front door I ducked under a window and focused my eyes to a figure illuminated by moonlight hiding behind my car. What I saw next has been burned into my minds eye and I will never forget it in the light long rotted fingers with thick black claws curled the back of my car and proceeded to revel a thing that was about 6 feet tall with long deer like legs to skinny to to support it that ended with small hooves. That seemed to float above the ground the body looked semi human but a skeleton draped with rotted flesh, patches of mangled fur,and ribs protruding from its chest said other wise the smell was wretched and I wanted to look away but I was paralyzed with fear.

I kept staring at the long curled antlers, the wrapped and twisted body, and the long arms that hung loosely with front claws that scrapped the ground but mostly the disturbing contorted mix of human and animal intertwined to make a face so haunting. I will remember vividly on my dying day I’m sure it then locked on me with its empty rotted sockets meeting my eyes and then I heard it quietly but all around me in my head the horrid howled mangled words “let me help you”. Instantly my front door shot open and with that I rushed to my room locking the door behind me I am now held up in my room with that thing outside my door clawing,scrapping, and laughing a sinister deep laugh repeating the same phrase over and over “ let me help you”. It’s now broken down my door I don’t have much time left I’ve decided to post this in the last moments I have left on this earth if you’re reading this please send help
