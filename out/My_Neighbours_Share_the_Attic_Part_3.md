The police told me I’d have to seal the hatch myself. Other than that, all they had to go on was a male voice and a (from their point of view) potentially unconnected bit of vandalism. They said they’d knock on some doors and see what was said by the neighbours.
My sister had messaged back. She said nothing insightful but told me she thought people in Stu’s position needed as much time with people as possible. I needed to keep him safe. 

To my pleasant surprise, nothing new was out of place with the car. But I was regretting what I’d done to ‘fix’ it. I googled the nearest B&Q and found it was just down from a garage I’d found to rent. The car paint I’d do later when I’d time.

I’d told work I wouldn’t be in today and took the car out. I walked back an hour later, loaded with a hammer, a bag of nails and some gorilla glue.

By the time was done speaking to the police and running my errands it was after midday. There’s something about daylight that makes places feel friendlier. This estate though just felt tired, ready to give up the last few ghosts still living here. It was hard to imagine it hadn’t been too long ago in the grand scheme of things since people cared for the place. Hard working people, with their own lives and interests bringing up families that could be anywhere right now. It felt strange knowing I was a product of this place in so many ways, despite how alien I felt in the place. But then again, there must’ve been people like me here. For hundreds of years before these were even built this area must have had the nerds and the losers who were born too early for software testing.

There was something different when I got back. Stu wasn’t sat in his chair, and I could hear movement upstairs. I went into the kitchen to be greeted by a raspy deep voice: ‘you must be our interloper’
I twisted my neck round so hard it’d be sore for days when I saw a middle-aged lady in blue overalls. Stu’s carer had shown up. She was flicking through his post and rolling her eyes at his scrawls on the envelopes.
‘So you do exist?’ I joked. She didn’t laugh and instead gave me a challenging look.
‘Of course I do. I’ve been coming here a long time. Not as long as since you were last here though.’

She’d clearly been expecting me.

‘David’ I introduced myself.

She paused and looked up as if something was off.

‘Stacy’ she said at last.

‘So, what do you do for Stu?’ I asked.

‘In practice, whatever he needs. Organising haircuts for example’. She moved over to the fridge and started unpacking some empty boxes from the fridge. ‘I thought you’d be older you know.’

That same assumption again. ‘Why?’ I looked at her sharply.

‘Because of how old Stu is’.

‘I’m not his son, why does it matter?’

She sighed and explained Stu’s condition. It was dementia Stu had. Not that this was news, but it least explained some of the odder behaviour of the last two nights. She’d figured with how much he talked about me and Sarah that we were his kids.

But I was stalling now. I had a job to do, and it needed doing before dark.

Stu was in his bedroom watching train videos while all this was going on. Stacy had set it up for him on an old laptop.

I was standing under the hatch now, knowing something that meant me harm had been just on the other side last night. I gambled that anyone who’d been in there wouldn’t be patient enough to wait until morning. Assuming it really was a person on the other side.
Pushing open the hatch I shone the torch from my phone into darkness. Half a dozen pairs of footprints were clearly visible in the old soot all surrounding the hatch itself. I hadn’t even thought to look for footprints when I first went up there a few days ago. But these were definitely fresh.

There were papers and old photos strewn across the wooden boards. My heart sank. All of Stu’s life was in this stuff left alone for years until I came along.

I could see all the boxes I’d put up there, most of which hadn’t been touched. A few of them though had been torn open with papers and photos strewn across the wooden boards.
I had to pick them up and save them. It just seemed wrong to let those go to waste like that. At first, I didn’t even look down at them, but there was just enough light coming in to make them out.

The colour photos were nearly all of people I missed but recognised. But as they drifted into sepia and eventually lost all colour, new faces started to appear. In particular, a woman kept I’d never seen cropping up and many of her appearances were next to Stu.

Then there were photos of a baby who I assumed was my mum who the two of them were holding. But then she appeared holding the very same baby in a photo dated from the early 60s – my mum would’ve been in school by this point.

I quickly took a snap of the photo on my phone and sent it to my sister. Sarah wouldn’t really have any reason to know more about the photo than I did, but you never know what sort of memories something like that might jolt.
I wondered for a moment how long these boxes had been up here unperturbed. There didn’t seem to be much in them aside from the photos. I found an old VHS tape of the 1991 League Cup Final in one and realised I’d genuinely no memory of Wednesday winning it that year, not that I really cared for football since Dad died.

Whoever had been up there, obviously hadn’t found the video or the mountains of old clothes interesting either. These footprints didn’t look old, and I couldn’t see any sign of anything being out of place when I’d come up here two days ago. Then I remembered the sounds of the first night. Those hadn’t been footsteps it’d been a rolling sound.

Shining my torch onto the ground I started to look for any signs of tracks or anything that might have rolled along in the night. Maybe an old cricket ball or something?

But then I spotted something just on the edge of visibility. Something wooden I think, very old, like a trolley or a suitcase. I was following the track lines over where the hatch had been when something touched my leg.

I kicked back at whatever it was and hit something hard. Stacy let out a scream.
‘Arsehole!’ followed by the slam of the front door was all I heard as I scrambled out of the loft.

I was stood at the bottom of the stairs now and finally realised I’d gotten covered in soot again but this time I hadn’t had time to wash it off. Stu was sitting as usual in his chair smiling. His eyes told me he knew something was wrong, and he kept looking me up and down.
‘Sorry about that Stu,’ I said sheepishly, ‘I’m just stressed out.’

He looked confused, ‘oh it’s no bother... lad.’ He clearly didn’t know what I was stressed about at all and seemed more bothered about the state of my clothes.

I still had the picture in my hand of him, the woman and the baby. I glanced down at it and then back to his face. ‘Who are these people with you Stu?’

His smile went away. ‘I don’t know’.
I felt the cogs turn in my brain. Stu didn’t sound dismissive, but then again, his dementia hadn’t wiped his knowledge of how distant relatives had their tea. I took a step closer, not knowing if I was going to show him the photo or just walk past and check to see if I could rustle up some food when Stu pressed himself back into his chair and yelped ‘they’re not with me anymore!’

Stepping back, I put the photo down on the mantlepiece, making sure Stu couldn’t see it. I reassured him that I didn’t mean to upset him. He was breathing heavily but steadily now and calmed down yet further when I offered him a cup of tea.

In the kitchen I could see he’d been up to his old tricks again, scrawling ‘R’s across all his letters. 

While the tea brewed, I had a moment to think. Women round here all seemed to have something to say about Stu. The barmaid had hinted at something (unhelpfully) and there was that old miner’s wife who didn’t want to sit with him. ‘We don’t know it was even him’.
My phone rang just then. It was my sister was on the other end of the line. I’d figured a few things out she confirmed. The woman in the photo was Stu’s wife, who’d only ever been mentioned in passing as a ‘bitch’. It’d stuck in Sarah’s mind as the worst word she’d ever heard Grandma say.

As for the baby? Well, we guessed it must have been theirs. As for where the baby now was, we’d no idea.

‘He’s got a nickname…’ I told Sarah. ‘Bit of a weird one but I guess it’s baby related Rock-a-bye Stu’.

‘Well, you’d have thought that’s a nice thing with it being a lullaby’.

‘Oh no, it’s definitely pointed.’ I replied.

Sarah picked the obvious question, ‘Have you asked him about it?’ 

I told her about the miner’s wife, the kids who called me ‘rock-a-bye junior’ the first day I got here and the way the barmaid had talked about it. ‘I decided I didn’t want to upset him. We know if it was something he’d done we’d have heard about him going to prison or something. Then just with what happened with the car and everything it kind of slipped my mind’.

It was already coming up to 3 o’clock and I still hadn’t sealed off the hatch. I heard Stu stir in his chair, and thought it was best to stir in the sugar and take the tea in for him. Sarah kept talking as I walked back into the living room.
‘Must be a line in the song or something’. She started half humming it, half singing it. I handed Stu his tea, by now he was going back to his normal smile only for us both to hear the words on the other end of the phone ‘and down will come baby, cradle and all’.
It felt like a rhino had hit my chest the way he shoved me. The chair had fallen backwards, and I’d thrown hot liquid across the carpet. Stu was shouting indeterminately not at me, but not at nothing.

‘A KEY!’, he shouted repeatedly. ‘A KEY! A KEY!’
I was still lying on the floor when I heard my sister still speaking on the phone. I told her I was ok and hung up. Checking there was no bleeding, I pushed myself up to my feet and stumbled over to Stu.

He stopped shouting at me, and started breathing heavily, his eyes wobbling in their sockets like he was staring up at a lion ready to finish him off.

‘It’s ok Stu’, I told him. His eyes still shook. ‘Do you know who I am?’

He steadied his breathing for a moment. ‘A Tommy Knocker!’

‘I’m David,’ I insisted, ‘I’ve been here a few days, but you’ve known me my whole life!’
He didn’t appear afraid anymore, and instead just went back to repeating ‘A key... A key’
‘Do you need the key?’

‘A KEY’ He said pointedly.

‘Where can I find “A Key”?’ I tried to calm him.
‘In the trunk.’ He looked upwards. He meant the thing I’d seen just on the edge of the torchlight in the attic. Away from the hatch, in the attic I still hadn’t sealed. His breathing was getting heavier again.

Needless to say, I did not want to go back up into the attic. But watching this old man in front of me almost convulsing with fear, I knew what I had to do.

I told him to wait for me there and headed back up the stairs. On the way up the ladder, I took a look at the hatch again. The panel was pretty sturdy so my thinking was the glue once set would mean you’d need a crowbar to get the thing off again. I could even put a nail or two through it if the angle was right and attach it to the wooden frame.

With a less than an hour of daylight I told myself it’d be safe to go in there. Lifting myself in there I shone my torch towards the thing I’d seen. It was probably above the next house across but only a few steps away. 
The irony of walking across the top of another house wasn’t lost on me as my heart pumped so fast I wasn’t sure whether it was medically significant. I got to the trunk and noticed the tracks from its wheels again. It’d only been stopped by a small pile of loose bricks on the boards. 

The thing was surprisingly heavy as I rolled it on its side as I looked for the latch, expecting it to be locked. Instead, it popped straight open and the packed in contents made me more worried about how I was going to close it again.

I was kneeling now in near total blackness, with just two islands of light one from my phone and one from the hatch back to the house. The trunk was full of tiny clothes, and the odd photo. I pulled out the baby clothes which can’t have been for a child of more than a year old and saw pictures of that same baby I’d seen before in Stu’s arms. No sign of the woman though.

My fingers touched something hard and varnished under it all. It was packed in tightly and needed a bit of force to prise out. What I’d found seemed like an old jewellery box. I reached back into the trunk, looking for the key I assumed this box needed almost not noticing it had popped open with no effort.

No jewellery inside, just a birth certificate and an article from the newspaper dating back to 1961. 

‘Richard’, the boy’s name was. The ‘R’ Stu had been scribbling on his post, ‘a key’ in the trunk. ‘Ricky!’

Monique had expected me to be older. Stu had looked at me strangely and mouthed an R when he’d seen me. Stacy had expected me to be older too. This is who they thought I was.
I scanned the newspaper. A headline showed in the corner:

‘Infant Remains Found in Local Colliery’.
The story read fairly flatly. I guess Stu wouldn’t have kept something sensationalist on the subject. 

‘The remains of what appeared to be a small child were found early on Monday morning by workers at a mine in Sheffield... Police investigations revealed the child fell into a coal chute which would have been easily accessible to someone who knew the area well.’
Down will come baby, cradle and all
‘It has been impossible to determine the identity of the child, however, it is extremely unlikely that a child of that size could have found their way up there alone. Police have interviewed dozens of locals looking for witnesses or information, however, given how large and accessible the area is, narrowing down suspects will be difficult...’

We don’t know it was even him

I rolled back and sat properly on the floor now. I don’t know how long I was sat there for until I felt by phone buzz again. My sister had called me back, just coming out of the subway. I didn’t even hear her at first, I could just see the photos in there of Stu and Ricky standing outside of this house smiling at each other. All I could think of was how New York felt like another planet to me.

She was talking at me for about 30 seconds, clearly panicking. 

‘Do you remember what a Tommy knocker is Sarah?’ I breathed out.

The sound of busy New Yorkers drowned out the silence in the attic of Yorkshire miners. I could picture Sarah now, stopped in the frosty grounds of Columbia university thinking back to an old story someone long dead had told her.

‘They’re spirits. There to help out souls in the mine who need something. They’ll knock for you when you’re lost’.

It’s not me they’re here to help
‘I know why they call him rock-a-bye Stu.’ The photo of him and Ricky was still in my hand with no mother in the picture. 

They’re not with me anymore

I breathed, ‘I think only he knows what’s true... But there’s a chance he doesn’t even remember anymore’. Sarah was still there but didn’t say anything. 

The torch on my phone had switched itself off now. I’d felt like I’d been in total silence barring the chattering on the phone until the slam of Stu’s hatch proved me wrong.

‘Rock-a-byyyyye' sang a small voice a few yards away.

‘Fuck off!’ I screamed back at the voice.
A giggle came from over by the hatch along with the tap of small feet jumping up and down on wood. ‘Rock-a-byyyyye!’, yelled another voice ‘Rock-a-byyyye junior!’ shouted another.
Adrenaline left my fingers feeling weak. Whoever was there couldn’t possibly have seen anything but the light from my phone. My thoughts were racing now, with a limited number of options.

Could I run the other way in the quarter mile darkness of hundred-year-old terraced attic space? Could I risk going down another hatch? Would I end up in someone’s home or be trapped inside somewhere derelict with only the only hope of freedom being to smash through a grate from the inside?

No, the best thing was to get back to Stu’s house. There was still daylight left, I could still try to seal it. I just needed to make whatever was over there more scared of me than I was of them.

There were bricks at my feet. They needed to feel a danger I thought, but they needed to see it. I turned the torch back on hanging up on a confused Sarah as a scrambled for one of the bricks, shining the light very obviously on it.
The weak light could only show the outlines of three skinny figures stood restless and abreast of each other. I could see a few wooden beams to the side and in front of them. Pointing the light at one of those I threw the brick with all my might watching the weight of the it splinter the wood and leave a huge dent on the floor.
The three of them laughed, getting ever more excited ‘Rock-a-bye!’ one of them squealed gleefully. I could hear them whispering to each other now.

‘Rock-a-bye-bye baby!’ they all squealed again, and they receded back into the distance. I grabbed another few bricks and sprinted head down to the hatch. They’d be back I knew it.
