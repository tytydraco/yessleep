I'm sorry it's been so long since my last update. I haven't been well. I think the land doesn't like me to talk about it. It certainly seems to be trying to stop me. But now the telling of my story has become an addiction. And I'm paying for every word I write. 

Illness and injuries are common for me recently. Falls and flu and migraines and covid, despite the fact that I never go anywhere these days. A couple of months ago, I broke my nose and two of my front teeth when I slipped on a patch of ice outside the old barn. I don't even remember it happening. One moment I was walking, the next flat on my face, spitting out gritty shards of enamel into the blood that was flowing from my nose. I hadn't even had a chance to put my hands out to break my fall. 

The blood had frozen when I went back later, the splinters of my teeth hanging in the murky puddle like insects in amber. The earth hadn't had chance to taste my blood before it froze. I felt like it had been cheated out of the payment for my betrayal that it had exacted. The equivalent of a bad check that couldn't be cashed. 

I'll pay it all back when I've finished my tales. In whichever way I can. Till then, let me entertain you. 

The doppelgangers and mimics on the land are one thing, but I can't tell you about those before I tell you about the man we see sometimes. We have all seen him, but I have seen him more than anyone else if the relation of encounters is to be believed. 

I don't know if he's an apparition, or something more solid. I don't know if he is an intelligent spirit, or a recording on time that repeats at random. I don't even know if he was ever an actual person. All I know is I have always called him the Shit Man. 

The first time I saw him I was about 7 years old. 

I had been lying in bed, with the grey early morning light slowly illuminating my room inch by inch. I had been in that misty stage between sleep and wakefulness, just blearily gazing at the faded pattern of my wallpaper, when I smelled something horrible. 

The house has never had completely modern plumbing, and sometimes the septic tank that collects our waste overflows, even more so in rainy weather, and my first thought upon detecting the foul odour had been that the septic tank had backed up again. 

I don't know if you've ever smelled the result of an accumulation of old shit that has stewed and fermented for long periods of time. But I can tell you that it is worse than the fresh stuff. A thousand times worse. It's indescribable. 

I put the covers over my head and tried to ignore the stench, clinging onto the last few shreds of sleep I was unwilling to surrender, but the smell only got worse, and after a few minutes of this I was fully awake. 

There was a sound too, trapped inside my head. Like tinnitus, but lower pitched, a strange buzzing of static. The vibrations made me feel just as sick as the smell. 

I flung my covers off, ready to run to my father and complain, but was stopped as I was halfway out of bed by what I saw. 

The old wooden stairs finished right opposite my main bedroom door, opposite my bed. The top step was just level with it, and to my horror I saw a man's head. It was sideways on the floor, only visible from neck upwards, peeking around the bannister, as though the man who owned the head was lying on the stairs and had laid his head down there. 

The head had a thick mane of dark hair, bushy eyebrows, and a full beard, but all of it was slicked down by something that looked greasy and slimy. His features were large and brutal, with a sloping forehead that led down to a pronounced ridge above the eyebrows, and a wide nose and square jaw. His eyes were very dark too, and shiny, the pupils dilated. He was staring right at me.

I knew that he was the source of the bad smell.

Terrified, I retreated under my covers again, attempting to blot out both the smell and the sight of him, but when I ventured out a few minutes later he was still there, features expressionless, still gleaming with filth. 

I'd screamed then. Screamed until my mother was roused from her bed and came to tend to me, closely followed by my father clumsily trying to load his shotgun, both of them still in their nightwear with their hair awry.

The head was gone then, and I gibbered my encounter to my parents. They didn't fully understand what I said, but they accepted it nevertheless, and I got hugs and kisses and special treatment that day. Their response to my trauma made me feel like they had also witnessed the Shit Man at least once themselves. 

He is an infrequent visitor, but feels vital to the narrative somehow, to me at least. As if he was Ghost Zero. Like everything began with him. 

I won't bore you with other encounters. They are pretty repetitious. But I did do some research, and older family members had apparently talked about such sightings periodically, and one great great grandparent even claimed that he was the spirit of a man who had drowned in a cesspit before the septic tank had been installed. It's a reasonable theory, but one that can't be verified, and I, for one, don't believe it. I think the Shit Man is far older than that. 

I don't even know if it's worth mentioning, but I remember the first time I ever saw a picture of a Neanderthal in my schoolbook. I can't fully explain the strange sensation that overtook me upon seeing the artistic representation, but all I could think was "Shit Man". 

Whatever it or he is, we will never know. All I know is that when the Shit Man is seen, bad things happen in threes.

Three is a significant number on our land. My mother, renowned to be religiously ambiguous, claims the threefold law and the holy trinity at once. Pagan and Christian in a confused mishmash that makes as much sense as anything else here. We have always been subject to the Crossing of Ways. 


The mimics have always been a part of our lives on the farm. They are separate from the doppelgangers. I use the different terms to divide them for my own convenience. The mimics are only audible, the doppelgangers audible and visible. I don't know if my interpretation is correct, but it has always served me well. 

I never got chastised for being slow to answer a call from my parents when I was young, because I always had to confirm who or what I was talking to before I would respond. My parents understood that more than anyone. It could be my mother calling me, or it could be something else. I walked into many an empty room following a deceptive voice when I was young, and it cured me of automatic obedience. 

There is something indescribably eerie about walking into a room you have just been called into only to find it devoid of anyone. The first time I answered such a call it was the voice of my mother, speaking to me in a tone I rarely heard from her. She sounded angry, and impatient, and I ran at the summons by instinct, only to find myself all alone in a room I didn't like to go in. 

It was a room that none of us used unless we had to. Kind of an office, kind of a junk room, kind of both and neither. The vibes in that room had always been "off", discomfiting in a way none of us could ever accurately describe. Being in there made your skin crawl, as if many judgemental eyes were watching you. I hated the room because of that, but also because of the inside of the door to that room: There were scratches in the wood, ones that someone had once attempted to erase by sanding and staining, but would never be obliterated. 

They were low on the bottom panel of the door, deep scourges that looked like they had been made by claws. But only three claws. Careful scratches made for effect rather than by desperation. 

Finding myself in that room after following my mother's harsh calls - and the voice had been calling me, specifically - felt like a bad dream. The kind of nightmare where being naked in public is the least of your worries. I felt scrutinised, like an organism under the microscope of a being that wanted to end me. As if I was a virus that needed a vaccine, but made personal.

I ran out of that room and found my mother, who was doing laundry in the opposite end of the house, and recounted my experience with the honesty of a child who has always been indulged when telling of weird experiences. My mother might have seemed strange to some, but I always knew that no matter how outrageous my tale was, my mother would never tell me I was imagining things. It was a blessing, honestly, although some might think she was enabling me. Encouraging me.

She sealed that room with salt within the hour, but it never stopped the mimics. They are very adaptable. And like I said, I never got scolded for taking too long to respond when either of my parents called me. They knew. 


I used to sleepwalk a lot as a child, and that was always traumatic. I would always wake up in some part of the house - or outside even, on some occasions - completely disoriented and terrified in the darkness. 

The room I mentioned was often a focus of these sleepwalking adventures. Thankfully, I never found myself inside it, as my father began to lock the door and hide the key, but once I did wake up opposite the yawning void of the open door. How it was open nobody could say.

It called to me. All the time. I wondered what it wanted from me, but knew that whatever it was wouldn't be good. 

It's worth mentioning that whenever a mimic called, there was something "off" about it, in the same way that room was "off". The voice would be familiar but very slightly distorted. Almost mechanical. Once I learned that it was easier to discern between what was real and what wasn't, but sometimes the mimics could still be very convincing. 


The doppelgangers were a different breed. Familiar yet unsettling, especially when I realised what they were. 

We saw them a lot. I don't have the time or patience to recount each case. They are too numerous. But I can tell you the times that disturbed me the most. 

I was around 12 years old. I went downstairs with the important mission of asking permission to go into Town. 

Town was a bus ride away and I had never done it without one of my parents with me, and I wasn't sure they would allow me to go. 

I found my father first. He was in the living room, reading his newspaper. 

"Can I go into town with my friends at the weekend?" I asked. 

I had expected an outcry, but my father hadn't even looked up. 

"Ask your mother," he said. 

"Where is she?" I asked.

It was a ritual I was familiar with. The passing back and forth between parents, neither of them prepared to take responsibility. 

"In the kitchen," he said. 

I had passed the kitchen on the way to him. My mother hadn't been there, not that I'd seen. If she had, I would have asked her first. Nevertheless, I had turned myself around and walked into the kitchen. 

My mother was there, washing dishes. There was a window above the kitchen sink and she seemed fixated by it. She didn't turn when I spoke to her. 

"Can I go into town on the weekend?" I asked. "With my friends."

She continued to wash dishes in silence, lifting a plate and rubbing suds over it before dunking it back into the water. 

"Better ask your father," she said, and I sighed.

I walked back into the living room. My father was no longer on the couch, but standing with his back to, looking out of the window. 

"Mum said I should ask you," I reported. 

"Ask me what?" 

His voice was dull, and I was even more frustrated. 

"If I can go into town with my friends!" 

He didn't respond beyond a shrug of his shoulders, and I turned back towards the kitchen. 

"Mum, dad won't answer? Can I go into town or not?" 

My mother was washing the same plate she'd been washing before. The dish rack was empty. It was only then I started to get uncomfortable. 

She didn't reply, and didn't turn her head. She lifted the plate, swirled suds over it, dunked it back in the water. Like a robot. 

I backed away from the door. From where I stood in the hall I could see both my mother and my father. Neither of them were showing their face. 

At that point, I heard loud footsteps on the stairs behind me. It was my brother, Luke. 

"Who you talking to?" he demanded, with typical older brother entitlement. 

"Mum and dad," I told him. "Maybe." 

Luke leaned around the stair bannister, craning his neck, taking in both figures from where he stood. 

He sighed, and descended the rest of the stairs. 

"One ain't real," he said in a low voice. "Dunno which one though. We better go." 

I obeyed without debate. It wasn't in my nature to respond to my brother with such mild acquiescence, as most of our childhood had been a friendly battle of wills that was normal for most siblings, but on this occasion I was disturbed enough to follow his advice. 

I found a pair of shoes in the hall, hanging beneath the coats, and levered them on. My father was still looking out of his window, my mother out of hers.

"How do you know?" I murmured as I laced my shoes. 

I didn't doubt him, but wondered what particular thing had triggered his distrust. 

"Saw dad out in the fields early. Hasn't come in since," said Luke. "And saw mum taking flowers to the stones an hour ago." 

I nodded. Straightened from tying my laces. We both burst through the back door into the dry mud of the courtyard beyond. 

"Let's find dad," suggested Luke. "He probably isn't far. And don't look back at the kitchen window!" 

Like I said, it wasn't in my nature to respond to my brother with mild acquiescence, and even though I knew it was sound advice, I did look back. 

My mother's profile had looked normal from where I'd stood in the hall, but looking back at her whole face was a different matter. Her face looked warped, twisted and misshapen, the eyes too far apart and the mouth a gaping, toothless curve. 

I must have made some sound, because my brother punched me in the arm, hitting me in a bunch of muscles that made my whole arm ache. 

"I said don't look back!" he scolded, and I punched him back in the same spirit, finding a spot beneath his ribs that made him grunt and wince. A minor triumph. 

But I pointed my eyes forward and we trudged across the yard together, bonded in terror and a complicated sibling love that was as cruel as it was caring. If you've ever had a sibling, you'll know what I mean. Sometimes you hate them more than you ever thought possible, but you would also fight any god for them. 

We found my father first: Toiling in the fields in his ragged coat and muddy boots, a perfect portrait of a man despised by nature but refusing to accept defeat. He fought every day, against himself and the elements, and somehow managed to last as long as he had. 

He looked up when we approached, and gave us the familiar greeting common amongst the English:

"Alright?" 

This man might have been uncomfortable, but he gave me no uncomfortable feelings. This was my father. And I don't know which gods knew what that other thing in the house had been. 

My mother appeared then, from around a hedge, rosy cheeked and somehow merry despite her undoubtedly morbid task of taking flowers to commemorate an awful event. Remembrance was mother's religion, and she bent at its altar every day. 

"Alright, you two?" she asked. 

Luke cast me a meaning look then, and I didn't have to acknowledge it. I knew the truth. Whatever I had been conversing with that day inside the house, neither had been my parents. 

"Just came to see what you were up to," said Luke. 

He watched my father wrangling a bale of hay off his truck, and sighed. 

"Want some help?" he offered, and my father looked up in surprise. 

"Yeah," said my dad. 

He wanted to say more. Wanted to make a dig at how he could've used help before now. But he didn't. He let it go, and Luke waded in to help. 

My mother stamped towards me, the roses still in her cheeks, stopping only to goose my father in a brief gesture that made him squawk and her giggle, and for a moment I saw how they must have been when they were young. Carefree and playful and flirty, with none of the burdens they had now. 

I linked arms with my mother. She smelled like the fields, fresh and green, and she hugged my arm in a sporadic display of affection, and in that moment I didn't care about what beings tormented us. We lived in a strange place, with strange things to deal with every day, but we were human together, and would cope with it however we could. 


I think I have one last update in me. For whoever is still reading. And if you've followed my story from the start, thank you for still listening. I have some theories that might surprise you, but until next time, be safe.
