There's this really weird thing I found recently that I've been meaning to share and explore a little bit, so here's a bit of backstory:

I came across this unsettling YouTube video the other day on my recommended. It was titled "KR Noise" and the thumbnail was just this overexposed photo of a forest- these blackened birch trees against a bright white sky and sharpness turned so high up that I couldn't actually tell what it was until now, thinking back on it. I watched the video and it was potentially the WEIRDEST thing I've ever seen in my life. I clicked on it thinking it was like brown noise or white noise or something to help me focus on homework, but it wasn't, it was this narration of some abstract physical theory about timelines and 'jumping' or something, with a very strange ink-animated diagram explaining it... I don't actually remember what the theory was about, it was kinda complicated. I was trying to follow along, because I found it interesting, but it was not really making sense. Watching it, I felt… unsafe. Like, not just creeped out, but targeted. Specifically. Like I was being watched, or spoken to directly through the screen.

But here's the even weirder part. I can't find the video anywhere. 

I looked it up this morning, but there was no trace of it anywhere on the internet at all. Not on YouTube, and it wasn't uploaded on to any other sites either.

 I did find, though, a reference to it somewhere, on a forum called AFysica. A user called xAffo_gato made a post about something called the Kaiser Phenomenon, and it sounded extremely similar to what was being described in the video (I think the video was uploaded by a channel by the name of the Kaiser Institute? Kaiser Institution? Something like that). 

I asked them about the video, and they said that they had seen it before, but that it'd been taken down years and years ago, in 2011. Which is weird, considering I definitely saw it last Monday. I think it was Monday.

But I asked them anyway, and they broke the theory down into fundamental parts. It's mainly about these timelines, called 'channels,' which are referred to as the 'vector' channel and the 'sub-scalar' channel. And they're connected, or something. You can only be in one at a time, and in order to get to a 'sub-scalar' channel, you had to 'jump' from the main 'vector' timeline. And it was completely random when you did that, and impossible to determine when it would happen.

There's also an extremely rare but non-zero case that someone can get stuck in-between the main vector and sub-scalar timelines, and in that case their existence is like, superimposed on top of the scalar timeline. I KNOW this doesn't make sense. I might be relaying this wrong, I don't know, it honestly doesn't really make sense to me either, but anyway.

I tried asking xAffo_gato about the video itself and the channel it was on, but I never got a response. Since this whole interaction, I've been feeling really strange. Like, chills down my spine, can't sleep kind of strange. I don't know what it means, but if anything, I'm just going to keep looking. This feels too weird to just ignore and move on with my life. I feel like there is more to be found here, like, WAY more.

Oh. And I figured out why the video was so strange to me. I know the woods in the thumbnail, because I live near them. I was out walking this morning and it dawned on me. It's in Ashpan City, North Carolina (ironic name, considering Ashpan is much less a city and much more a rural hellscape of the greatest proportions). And I am a little freaked out because of this, considering my city's… extensive… history with sketchy shit. I'm going to do some more research and see what I can find, hopefully it'll be interesting.

Down the rabbit hole we go.
