**The street split open under me in Mid-Wilshire.**

The day I retired, my captain told me I’d earned it. He was wrong.

What I’d really earned was a wrecked back, half a lung, and a pension that barely covers rent on a Koreatown one-bedroom where the ceiling fan threatens to decapitate me every time the Red Line rattles underneath.

So I drink burnt coffee, watch pigeons fight on the fire escape, and try not to replay the Wilcox fire. Spoiler: I fail. Every day. The flashover, the screaming, the radio static. The order I followed instead of trusting my gut. The half-second that cost Emma’s mother’s life.

Emma won’t talk to me anymore. Can’t say I blame her.

Outside, LA did what LA always does: honked, screeched, smogged. The air was thicker today, carrying that metallic taste that meant the drilling crews were working overtime. For months now, the city’s been punching holes deep into the earth, chasing geothermal energy like it was the answer to everything. The scientists promised it was safe. Same thing they said about the building codes before Northridge.

That morning’s plan was modest: buy groceries, maybe call my sponsor, and finally fix the cabinet hinge in the kitchen that had been loose for six months.

I stared at Dave’s number. Two months sober, but some days the bottle still called louder than common sense. Today was one of them.

By the time I left, the drilling noise from the Mid-Wilshire site had gotten worse. They’d been at it for weeks, tapping into something six miles down. The ground vibrated constantly, a low thrum that made my teeth ache. Mrs. Kim from downstairs stood by her jacaranda tree, frowning at cracks that had appeared overnight in the sidewalk.

“Not good,” she said, pointing. Her English was sparse but her worry was clear.

The corner market’s radio was tuned to a call-in show. The host grilled one of the DWP engineers about the drilling project. The scientist kept insisting the borehole was stable, hitting temperatures right where they’d predicted. The host kept pushing: what happens if you hit something unexpected?

“The magma chamber is stable,” the engineer said. “We’re nowhere near the active zones.”

Famous last words.

I grabbed eggs, bread, and the cheap coffee I’d grown accustomed to. The kid at the register looked nervous, glancing out the window every few seconds. Even the pigeons seemed agitated, circling in tight, erratic patterns.

Walking back, I felt the first real tremor. Not the usual drilling vibration. This came from deeper, rolling up through the soles of my boots like the earth was clearing its throat. Mrs. Kim’s tree swayed without wind.

My coffeemaker rattled across the counter when I got upstairs. Then came the sound — a deep groaning, like metal under stress, but from everywhere at once.

I’d heard that sound before. Not from earthquakes. From structural failures. When a building decides it’s done holding up.

Except this was the ground itself.

The crack appeared with a sound like a rifle shot. A black seam split the asphalt outside my window, running straight down Wilshire toward the drilling site. Steam rose from the gap — not water vapor. Something sharper. Sulfur dioxide.

I knew that smell from hazmat training. It meant volcanic activity. In Los Angeles.

The delivery van went in first. Front wheel caught the edge as the crack widened, axle snapping, cab tilting nose-down into the gap. The driver was trapped, screaming, while yellow steam poured out around him.

I should have walked away. Not my job anymore. The department made that clear when they forced my retirement. “Psychological unfitness for duty,” they called it. What they meant was: Jack Morrison makes bad calls under pressure.

But twenty years of running toward disaster don’t just switch off.

I grabbed my boots — the ones I swore I’d never need again — and hit the stairs.

The crack was wider now, three feet across and growing. Heat rolled up from below, carrying the stench of sulfur and something else. Something organic. Burning.

The van’s cab dangled over the edge, metal shrieking with each tremor. One more jolt and the whole thing would drop. I could see the driver inside, hands frozen on the wheel, eyes wide with terror.

Just like Sarah Morrison had looked, trapped in that bedroom while the Wilcox fire ate through the floor beneath her. While I stood in the hallway, following orders instead of trusting what I knew.

Not this time.

I lunged for the van’s door handle, hauled myself up onto the tilting frame. Heat blasted my face as I yanked the door open. The driver — young, maybe twenty-five, wearing a wedding ring — stared at me like I was a hallucination.

“You can’t spend it if you’re dead.” I grabbed his jacket, braced against the door frame, and pulled. We tumbled backward onto solid asphalt just as the van’s front end gave way with a scream of tearing metal.

The kid rolled away, coughing but alive. I lay flat, staring at gray sky, my lungs burning from the sulfur. My heart hammered like I was twenty again.

That’s when I heard it. The roar.

Not from above. From below. A sound like a freight train bearing down, muffled by six miles of rock but getting louder. The drilling had found something, all right. Something that didn’t want to stay buried.

The eruption wasn’t the Hollywood version. No graceful fountain of molten rock. This was violent. The street split wider with a sound like the world cracking open. Superheated gas blasted out, carrying chunks of debris that hit like shrapnel. A glowing mass of rock and metal — what used to be the van — shot skyward and crashed into a storefront.

Ash began to fall. Real ash, volcanic ash, turning morning into dusk. It stung exposed skin and made every breath a struggle. The air tasted like metal and sulfur.

Then I saw the city bus.

It had stopped maybe fifty yards away, passengers pressed against windows, driver frozen at the wheel as a new crack raced toward his front tires. The ground under the bus was already sagging, asphalt turning soft from the heat below.

Twenty-three people on that bus. I counted them through the windows.

Same number that died in the Wilcox fire because I waited for orders instead of acting.

My legs moved before my brain caught up. The bus driver was shouting into his radio, trying to back up, but the crack was too wide now. The front end tilted forward, hydraulics screaming.

A woman in scrubs — mid-twenties, composed despite the chaos — was already pushing passengers toward the rear exit. Smart. But not fast enough. The bus was going down.

I reached the front door as it tilted past the point of no return. “Everybody out! Now!” The voice that came out was the one I’d used for twenty years, the one that made people move without thinking. “Back exit only!”

The nurse caught my eye through the glass. A moment of recognition — two people who knew what they were doing in a world gone insane. She nodded and kept pushing passengers toward safety.

The bus folded in half as I pulled the last person free — an elderly man who kept apologizing for being slow. It tumbled into the crack, swallowed whole.

Ash fell thicker now, and the roar from below grew constant. The drilling site had become a wound in the earth, vomiting fire and rock into the sky. Car alarms wailed. Windows shattered. Someone was screaming for help.

Mrs. Kim stood by her broken tree, soot-covered, looking at me with something I hadn’t seen in anyone’s eyes for a long time.

Trust.

The nurse appeared at my elbow, hair gray with ash, stethoscope around her neck like a talisman. “What do we do?” she asked.

Behind her, the survivors clustered together — the bus passengers, neighbors who’d run from their buildings, the van driver. Fifteen, maybe twenty people. Looking at me like I had answers.

Like I was still a firefighter.

The truth was, I didn’t know what came next. The ground was still splitting, still vomiting up the contents of the earth. No sirens yet. No help coming.

Just us. Just me.

But for the first time since Wilcox, I wasn’t paralyzed by the choice. Sarah Morrison was gone. These people weren’t.

“We move inland,” I said. “Away from the drilling sites. Find high ground and wait for rescue.”

The nurse nodded. “I’m Rebecca. I can handle medical.”

“Jack. I know evacuation.”

As if on cue, another section of street collapsed, taking out the corner market where I’d bought coffee an hour ago. The Korean owner ran toward us, clutching a cash register, looking stunned.

Mrs. Kim barked at him in Korean, then looked at me. “He asks if you know the way.”

I glanced back at the growing fissure, the column of ash and fire climbing into what used to be a clear morning sky. Los Angeles was tearing itself apart, one street at a time.

“Yeah,” I said, surprising myself with how steady my voice sounded. “I know the way.”

For the first time in two years, it wasn’t a lie.
