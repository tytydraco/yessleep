When I was 7 years old, I used to go to Sunday church. I was bored like every kid and I started to daydream about things. I have always had a very active imagination. I imagined this woman haunting in the church and at the cemetery around it. She was young, had a long brown hair and was wearing a long white dress. She would sit in the benches of the church praying and praying. 

I imagined this every time I went to the church. I stopped going when I was about 13, my parents left the church. But my fascination with the church stayed. 

I forgot about my imagination of this woman until she started to appear in my dreams when I was 16. In the dream I was in front of the cemetery and I saw her in a distance sitting under a willow tree. I never saw her face. She moved her hand in a expression for me to come closer. I was spooked by the fact that my old daydream was a dream and I woke up.

From this moment on, I saw that dream every night. And every in every dream she was becoming more frantic to talk to me. She started running up to me, trying to grab my arm or yell something. Everytime she got close to me, or tried to speak to me, I woke up in cold sweats.

I hated the dream. Why did I see it again and again. Fast forward when I was 19, I didn’t want to see that dream again. So what a idiot I was, I went to the doctor to get sleeping pills. I was in such a deep sleep with the pills, I didn’t see nor remember my dreams.


When I was 20, I met my husband. He was handsome, charming and had a lot of money. Me begin young and naive, fell for him instantly. He took me out to see Europe and Asia. When I was 22, he proposed to me at New Years in Paris. It was magical. 

Until I found out his secret. When I asked about his job he always told me he worked at his father’s company. He would in the morning at 10am and came back at 7pm. I never saw anything suspicious about it. 

One day before our wedding I was going through his closet because I was packing for our honeymoon. That’s when I saw loads of guns and a bag of white powder. I quickly closed the door and accidentally knocked over the guns. I pretended I didn’t see anything. 

I was panicking and thinking what the fuck. We had promised not to contact each other a day before the wedding. So I ignored it.

It was our wedding day. I was in my white gown and my long brown hair was in curls. We wanted to have private vows, before the ceremony. We were at the backyard of the church. I started reading my vow to him. When it was his turn he said “you shouldn’t have gone through my things. now i need to do this. “ as he took a gun from his pocket and shot me in the head. 

I woke up in the darkness. I quickly realised I was buried in the ground. But it was weird, I didn’t have difficulty breathing in the dirt. Nor did I have a bullet in my head. I dug myself up and saw loads of ambulances and police at the parking lot of the church. They were carrying my dead body in to the ambulance. I tried to yell at them but no one of them heard me. I tried to grab their hands and shake them but it was like I was a ghost. 

I have been stuck in here, in my wedding dress at the cemetery for two weeks now. Every Sunday I see 16 year old me standing in the front of the church. I try to speak to her but she won’t listen. I found a phone at the church stairs. So if you, should I say me, are reading this, please listen to me in your dream.
