Last night I went to bed early that night. Nothing felt off at first. I drifted out quickly, only to wake suddenly and check the time. It was exactly 12:00 a.m. I got up for water, returned to bed, scrolled on my phone for a bit, and felt that familiar heaviness pull at my eyelids. When I put my phone away and closed my eyes, I expected sleep to take over.

Instead, my body rebelled.

I could not get comfortable. Heat flooded me, then vanished, replaced by a cold that crawled beneath my skin. I twisted and turned, but the bed felt wrong, like it was not meant to hold me anymore.

Then I felt it.

Something crawling.

Not just once, over and over. Across my arm, my leg, my face. The unmistakable sensation of tiny legs moving deliberately. I jumped up, heart racing, and searched the room. Nothing was there.

That was when the noises started.

At first, I told myself it was one of my brothers awake in the house. Normal sounds. Explainable sounds. But soon, they were not coming from the hallway.

They were coming from inside my room.

I tried to rationalize it. Wind, rain, old walls shifting. I was finally starting to drift off again when I heard movement on my sister’s bed. Half asleep, I assumed she was turning over.

Then I remembered.

She was not home.

She was on vacation.

I sat straight up.

The bed was empty.

Panic settled into my chest, and I tried to pray. My mind went completely blank. Every prayer I had ever known vanished, as if erased. I could not even form the first word.

That was when my mother’s voice surfaced in my memory.
“Manda todos tus problemas y angustias a los pies de Jesús.”
Send all your worries and fears to the feet of Jesus.

I focused on that. I tried to breathe. But every time I closed my eyes, something new happened. Another sound. Another shift in the air. Another wave of heat and pressure. I flipped my pillow to the opposite side of the bed, desperate for relief.

For a moment, it worked.

As I started to fall asleep, I felt it.

A presence.

Not a sound. Not a shadow. Just the undeniable awareness that I was no longer alone.

I opened my eyes and tried to speak.

“Who’s there?”

No words came out.

My mouth moved, but my voice was gone. I tried again. And again. My body felt heavy, frozen, pinned in place. On the third attempt, I finally heard myself whisper, “Who’s there?”

Silence.

I grabbed my phone and turned on the flashlight. The room was empty. But the air felt thick, like it was pressing down on me, like something was still there just out of sight.

That was when I began reading Psalm 91.

The moment I started, it felt like the room resisted me. My words slowed and tangled, stumbling like I had forgotten how to read. Each sentence felt forced, like something did not want those words spoken aloud.

Eventually, the weight lifted enough for me to fall asleep.

But I do not believe it left.

I believe it could not fully take hold.

Every time I felt or heard something, I could barely move. Classic sleep paralysis, they would say. But this felt intentional, like something was testing its grip. The third time was the closest it came.

What haunts me most is the thought that maybe the reason I could not sleep was because I was not supposed to. Each time, it felt like I was awake in my room but unconscious at the same time, hovering on the edge of something deeper.

I used to astral project when I was younger.

That night, it felt like I almost did again.

It felt like something was waiting in the darkest corner of my room, waiting for me to leave my body unattended.

I refused.

So instead, it turned to fear.

And tried to drive me out.
