It's almost time, my mother has told me to begin writing a diary. So that I shall do, nothing special today but don't fear. Something terrible will happen soon.

*29/12/2020*

Same as yesterday, what a bore.

*30/12/2020*

I'm beginning to lose control, it'll be time soon. Calm yourself.

*31/12/2020*

It's like being at the edge of a cliff. Any moment now, everything will fall.

*01/01/2021*

I entered my fathers room early in the morning, armed with a kitchen knife. I began to carve the following into his stomach 'The end comes closer, for you have sinned.' The thrill I got from this deed made all the waiting worthwhile. After I completed stage 1, I cut off all fathers communications. Mother was not to know about this. Oh I must have forgotten to mention, mother is celebrating the new year with the family. Father and her had a big fight about this, of course a part of this was my doing, Father cannot say no to his dear daughter. Which is one of his grave sins. How foolish.

*02/01/2021*

Father begins to suspect an intruder was the cause of yesterdays events, of course I am the cause of these suspicions but I'll stay quiet until the final day. He begins attempting to get help, this is not possible, strangely enough and I manage to coerce him out of doing so. I allow his wounds to close up, to show some pity as in short time he will be gone, forever. As expected, he follows his pattern. At 21:05 he requests a black coffee. Something must have been put into this coffee, as shortly after he ingests this coffee, he is suddenly lying unconsciously on the couch. I dragged his body to my room, pushed the dresser aside and threw him in there. Oh, what is 'there'? What an unnecessary question but I shall answer, **hell.** Putting that aside, I tied him up just as he tied me down when I was an infant before he brut-, oh sorry that must've slipped out by mistake! **My father is evil.** What is coming over me today?. I pushed the dresser back into place and made sure to screw the vent back on. As I slept in the peace I had been craving since I witnessed all of my fathers sins, I began to plan how I would explain to mother what had happened. I would tell her that I woke up to a loud noise and went to my fathers bedroom to see blood on the sheets and him missing, and would say all of this with a terrified expression. **It was a horrific experience knowing you, father.**

*03/01/2021*

My writing days will now come to an end, as I am the only person deserving of the details to the torture I will put my father through for the next 2 years.

*01/01/2023*

I know I said my writing days were over, but just wanted to say. Mother, when you find this, know that he was deserving of what happened, I no longer wish to own him anymore, I have not fed him since last November. It's likely you do not want to see what lays behind that dresser. And I know you'll be snooping in my room so I made sure to leave this out for you, satisfied? Mommy? As you are reading this, if you walk downstairs you will find my remains, devoid of life, hanging from the ceiling, what a thrill!
