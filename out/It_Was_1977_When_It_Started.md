I was a child, blinded by the novelty of my new life in California. I thought it was a land of possibility, eagerly beckoning me into adulthood.

Little did I know that after that sweltering summer day in 1977, this promised land would soon become the bane of my existence and the birthplace of my addiction.

I don’t know how I ended up here, in my vacant childhood home; standing motionless in the garden I had spent so many vibrant days in. Nostalgia had been tempting me lately, its pull slowly becoming irresistible. 

And so, here I am. Passing through the area seemed like a perfectly rational reason to see what life was like before I grew up and cowered in the shadow of reality.  

Unsurprisingly, the house was deserted. I let out a raspy chuckle at how easily the ancient doors buckled, pelting me with dust and splinters as they opened. A little pain didn’t deter me as I headed inside. The main hallway was eerily quiet.

And cold. I shivered when I realised we were in the dead of Summer.

The relentless chill nipped at me as I continued into the cramped kitchen. A hazy atmosphere obscured my senses slightly, but I could still make out family photos sprawled across the floor, leaving the walls bare with their rectangular stains. 

The kitchen was exactly how it was all those years ago, complete with a black substance covering the table - Our last meal. I bent closer, inspecting the dark sludge. The smell was musty and putrid, leaving me reeling.

The sound of my choking coughs resonated through the empty kitchen and I made for the stairs, eager to see my old bedroom. 

Thick cobwebs lined the walls and I had to constantly wipe them from my face and clothes until I burst through that familiar blue door. A warm feeling of nostalgia washed over me, lingering in my chest. I felt tears sting my eyes as I saw the faded Star Wars posters welcome me. 

Everything was identical, from the gentle caress of the carpet to the smooth texture of the walls. Slowly, I made my way around to the mirror.


The grin dropped from my wrinkled face. 

A sad, pathetic excuse of a man stared back at me with an appropriate dopey expression. A bulbous, hairy stomach bulged from underneath my dirty flannel shirt and my face had an oily sheen to it. The bald spot on my head shined proudly and the sunlight streaming from the window exposed the greasy fingerprints coating the lens of my glasses. I felt sick.

Swiftly, I turned toward the single bed, biting my thin lips. Dust billowed around me, almost applauding the dive I had performed into my bed. A musty smell invaded my nostrils but I ignored it. I was a little boy again.

I leapt from the bed, running through the silent house into the garden. If the house hadn’t created any impact on me, the garden definitely did. It resembled unruly moorland; nature had reclaimed the space that I once loved to spend days roaming. 

Tall grass grazed my legs and wild weeds peeked out at me from every crevice. The once bright yellow paving slabs were smothered in a coat of weeds. 

I squinted my eyes against the powerful rays and surveyed the kingdom that was once mine.

The swing set that my mother used to push me on was still there and I ran forward, craving her touch one last time.

“Mummy, push me higher!” My high-pitched voice screeched in joy. Her hearty laugh rang through the lush garden as she looked at my baby sister with the adoration only new parents possess. I was holding her on my lap, enjoying how her little body resembled a doll. 

She brought our family such happiness. 

My mother was left single after being deserted by my deadbeat father but she did a remarkable job at raising my 8-month-old sister and I.

Each time I was pushed, I relished in the way the wind whistled against my ears; the sun hitting my skin; the smell of flowers and the chorus of grasshoppers.

“We didn’t need a dad.” I rasped, staring at the patch of lilies hidden behind a now imposing conifer tree. My footsteps made no noise as I approached them. The square of flora was small in size and very familiar. Panic gripped me as I bent over and searched feverishly through the lilies.

“Agh, where are they? They were right here…aha!” I exclaimed. 

My face broke into a satisfied grin that stretched ear-to-ear. I found them.

Two crudely crafted wooden sticks protruded from the cracked ground, staring at me accusingly. I laughed, the noise echoing through the garden.

They were poorly made, but what can you expect from an 8 year old?

I threw my head back and sighed in ecstasy as the memories flooded me.

They were both so weak. My mother was a fighter, but my sister was notably easy to snuff out. It’s like she wanted me to do it.

Her confused crying was priceless, but not as memorable as the pathetic way my mother spat her own blood at me as her life ebbed.

“You’re a monster.” she gargled out, pressing her pale, shaking hands against the gaping wound that stretched from her stomach to her neck. 

I could have almost taken a picture: Her spitting such powerful words at me while her guts lazily spilled into a puddle around my feet.

I leered at the wooden grave markers below me as the nostalgia faded away, finally satisfied.

My family was special. 

They were my first of many.
