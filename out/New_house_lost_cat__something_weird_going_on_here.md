When my son, Alex, and I moved into our new house at the edge of town, it felt like we were stepping into a place that had been waiting for us—almost like it had been holding its breath, waiting for someone to fill its empty rooms. The house is old, with walls that seem to lean in a little too close, as if listening to everything we say. It was supposed to be a fresh start for us, but from the moment we walked through the door, something felt… off.



Our cat, Chewy, picked up on it immediately. He’s always been a little skittish, but that day, he was on edge, prowling the rooms with his ears twitching at every creak and groan of the old floorboards. I tried to brush it off as just nerves from the move—Chewy had never been fond of change—but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong.



“Alex,” I remember saying as I glanced at the open door, “be careful with the door. We don’t want Chewy getting out in this new place. Who knows what’s out there?”



Alex nodded, but you know how kids are—easily distracted. He was excited, eager to explore the new house, and I didn’t think much more of it. I should have been more cautious, though. I should have kept a closer eye on the door.



It happened late in the afternoon. I was busy unpacking, trying to make the place feel a little less strange, when I heard it—a soft thud, the sound of paws on the porch. I turned just in time to see Chewy darting out into the yard. The door had been left ajar, just for a moment, but it was enough.



“Alex!” I shouted, panic tightening my throat. “I told you to keep the door closed!”



He froze, guilt all over his face as he realized what had happened. “I’m sorry, Mom,” he mumbled, but I was already moving, rushing to the door, my heart pounding as I scanned the yard for any sign of Chewy. But he was gone, disappeared into the gathering dusk like a shadow.



I grabbed a flashlight, pulled Alex outside with me, and we started calling for him. I know it sounds silly, but Chewy’s always responded to this ridiculous call we made up—“Cha-cha-chewy, woo-woo, where are you?” It was something my late husband came up with when Chewy was a kitten. We used to laugh about it, and somehow, it just stuck. But standing there in that strange neighborhood, shouting those words into the dark, felt wrong. It felt like we were disturbing something.



As we wandered through the streets, everything felt off. The neighborhood was unfamiliar, sure, but it was more than that. The houses seemed to blend together, the streets winding and twisting in ways that didn’t make sense. It was like we were walking in circles, but each turn led us somewhere stranger than the last. The whole time, I had this gnawing feeling that something was watching us.



We turned a corner and saw a street post covered in old flyers. They were all for lost cats, their faces faded and forlorn. Some looked like they’d been there for years, untouched and forgotten. A chill crawled up my spine. I wanted to turn back, but something kept us moving forward.



That’s when we met the old man.



He just appeared out of nowhere, stepping out of the shadows like he’d been waiting for us. His eyes were cloudy, and he had this thin, uneasy smile that made my skin crawl. “Lost your cat, have you?” he rasped, and there was something in his voice that I didn’t like.



“Yes,” I said, not sure why I was even answering him. “Have you seen him?”



He nodded, but the way he did it, slow and distant, made me think he wasn’t really talking to us. “Aye, I’ve seen many cats come and go. Had one of my own, years back. Smart cat, but one day, he just up and vanished. Called for him, just like you’re doing now—‘Cha-cha-chewy, woo-woo, where are you?’” He repeated the call with this twisted grin, and my stomach turned.



His story got worse. He started talking about how his cat had wandered into the woods, where the trees grow thick and dark, and how something else had found him first. Something old and hungry. He said people around here talked about a witch, or something even older, that fed on lost things—cats, dogs, whatever strayed too far from home.



I should have walked away then, but I was frozen, listening to this man’s twisted tale. When I finally managed to pull Alex away, I felt like we were running from something we couldn’t see, but could almost feel, lurking just behind us.



We didn’t find Chewy that night. We went back to the house empty-handed, and it felt different somehow—oppressive, like the walls were closing in. The wind picked up, howling around the corners of the house, rattling the windows. I couldn’t sleep. I just lay there, listening to the storm outside, thinking about Chewy, about that old man’s story.



And then, just as I was starting to drift off, I heard it.



“Cha-cha-chewy, woo-woo, where are you?”



It was faint, carried on the wind, but it was there. My heart stopped. The call was twisted, distorted, like something was mocking me. Beneath it, I could hear laughter, soft and cruel, like the wind was whispering secrets I wasn’t meant to hear.



I sat up in bed, my heart pounding in my chest. The house was silent again, but that feeling of wrongness, of something lurking just out of sight, didn’t go away. I knew Chewy was gone, and whatever had taken him was something I couldn’t fight.



The next day, I made flyers, even though I knew it was hopeless. I taped them to every post I could find, including the one with all the old, faded flyers. As I worked, I felt this deep, sinking dread, like I was sealing Chewy’s fate, like the neighborhood had already claimed him, and there was nothing I could do.



That afternoon, the phone rang. I almost didn’t answer it, but something made me pick up. The voice on the other end was thin, almost a whisper. “I saw your cat,” it said, the words sliding into my ear like ice.



I could barely breathe. “Where? Where did you see him?”



There was a pause, a breath of static, and then the line went dead.



That night, the wind picked up again, howling around the house, and I woke to the sound of voices outside. “Cha-cha-chewy, woo-woo, where are you?” It was louder this time, closer, and there were more voices now, all blending together in this twisted, mocking chorus that made my blood run cold.



I crept to the door, my heart hammering in my chest, and looked through the peephole. The night outside was thick with shadows, the wind screaming like a living thing. And then the doorbell rang—sharp and sudden, like a knife cutting through the dark. I jumped, my hand flying to my mouth.



I opened the door slowly, my hands trembling, and there, on the stoop, was Chewy.



Or what was left of him.



His body was twisted, broken, his fur matted with blood. His eyes, once bright and full of life, were dull, empty. I stumbled back, tears blurring my vision, but as I backed away, I felt it—a coldness seeping into the room, something darker than the night pressing in on me from behind.



Slowly, I turned, my breath coming in short, ragged gasps. There, in the shadows, was a shape—a twisted, barely human figure, its eyes glowing with a sickly light, its mouth curled into a smile that dripped with malice.



It leaned in close, its breath icy against my ear, and whispered, in a voice that was mine and yet not mine, a voice that echoed with the weight of every lost call, every unanswered plea—



“Cha-cha-chewy, woo-woo, where are you?”



I don’t remember what happened next. Maybe I passed out, or maybe I just blocked it out. All I know is that when I woke up, it was morning, and the house was quiet again. But the feeling of dread hasn’t left me. I still hear that voice sometimes, late at night, carried on the wind, calling out to me. And every time I hear it, I know that whatever it was, it’s still out there, waiting.



And it’s not done with me yet.
