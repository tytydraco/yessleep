Hi, I'm a 30 year old male and I live in Boulder Colorado by myself. I just moved into my first home about 2 mouths ago and everything has been super great so far and I really havent noticed anything else going on before this.

It started about an hour ago now, I heard a cat meowing when I was sitting in my living room watching TV, not a regular meowing though. The kind cats make when they're stuck somewhere you know? Anyways, I thought I was just hearing things at first because every time I paused my show to listen closer I wouldn't hear anything. At first I thought it was just coming from my show but then it started to get louder. It got so loud I thought for sure it was coming from my attic. I paused my show again and I finally heard it 

"Meoowww meoowww" 

Only twice and then it stopped again. I decided to walk over to my attic entrance and see if somehow a cat made its way up there and got stuck up in there y'know? I didn't want the poor thing to starve to death or anything. When I popped open the cover and peaked in with my phone light I didn't see anything, just dust covered boxes as usual. No foot prints, nothin'. So I shut the door and went to go finish my show, but on my way back to the couch that's when I heard it again.

"Meooooooowww" longer and a bit more distressed this time. I started to walk back to the attic entrance and that's when I noticed something odd. See I have two dogs, both hound dogs so whenever there's any kind of squirrel or cat or anything like that they go crazy, ears parked up, sniffing around, you know typical dog stuff. However the two of em when just laying in their beds, totally unbothered. I thought at first maybe they didn't hear it? But I know that's not true cause if I could they definitely could. It was odd but I didn't think much of it after that, maybe they didn't care? I don't know. I went to go check again, but this time when I peaked in, and I'm not exaggerating, HUNDREDS of footprints in the dust. They were everywhere, the floor, the boxes...the windows and the ceiling. I slammed the door shut and backed off the door as an eruption of cats crying and meowing came from just behind it. This went on for what felt like forever but was probably only about two minutes.  

Once it stopped I was too afraid to open the hatch again, I'm sitting on my couch now and about 5 minutes ago the cries started back up again and they haven't stopped, my dogs still don't seem to notice anything they just keep looking at me concerned and the meowing is just getting louder. Please I need help I don't know what to do.
