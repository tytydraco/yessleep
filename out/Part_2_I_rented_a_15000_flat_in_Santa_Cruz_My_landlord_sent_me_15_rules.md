My name is Sameer. I was an engineering student until I wasn’t. I dropped out to chase acting, and I moved into this place because I needed my own hours. The rent is fifteen thousand a month, too cheap for Santacruz, and it came with fifteen rules from a landlord who never shows his face. I posted those [already](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/tqpAYjWEmi).

Tonight I couldn’t sleep. Every tick and hum in the flat felt like it was aimed at me. So I unpacked.

The bedroom closet is old laminate, swollen and ugly from the monsoon air. The bottom drawer screamed when I pulled it and then gave way. At the back my thumb found a panel that bent inward when it shouldn’t. I pressed. It sighed and lifted, and a hollow space gaped open where there should have been wood.

Something was inside.

Dust bloomed in the air, bitter in my throat. The cover of the book was dark brown and cracked, the corners soft as though too many hands had worn them down.

Inside the front page a name was scrawled in block letters

*Shaan*

The next page had something glued to it. A cut-out from a school ID card.

A boy’s photograph. Twelve, maybe thirteen. Light blue uniform shirt, striped tie, the emblem of some school pressed into plastic. His hair was combed neatly, his eyes wide like he didn’t want to blink.

I sat cross-legged on the floor, the diary heavy in my lap. The handwriting started neat, but even at a glance I could see it change. The pen dug deeper into the page as though the boy’s hand had been fighting the paper itself. I turned to the first entry and began to read

**17 October 2017**

*Today is Diwali. The Festival of Lights. First time we lit rockets on the roof. Everyone counted down and the sky opened like a flower.*

*I ate six kaju barfis. Dinner was puri with potato sabzi and kheer. I ate ten puris. Mom laughed and said run it off.*

*My favorite firework is anar. The fountain that burns upward from the ground. I like it because it pushes light into the dark from below. It shows everyone’s faces.*

*When it hissed and climbed I could see Dad and the uncles playing cards, Mom and the aunties laughing with bangles on their wrists, the watchman clapping once before pretending he didn’t.*

*The air smelled of ghee and sugar smoke and the building itself seemed to smile.*

*I went to bed smiling. Tomorrow is Sunday.*

**18 October 2017**

*A new man moved into 13B today. Dad said hmm, new guy, and Mom told me to carry flowers and a bowl of sweets.*

*We went to greet him. He said his name is Ajmera. His hair was neat. He carried a tan briefcase.*

*I thought he said he worked in fin… ninedance. Dad corrected me. Finance.*

*He smiled at me. Mom told him if you ever need help, don’t hesitate. He said thank you and took a sweet. He chewed slowly, like he had to remember what to do with it.*

*When he shook my hand it was cold. His palm was smooth and tight, like skin that healed wrong.*

**19 October 2017**

*Ajmera uncle called everyone to the community hall. He said he was holding a small prayer, a pooja, once a week. He told us prayers bring peace of mind, focus, and strength. He said prayer makes us powerful.*

*We all sat cross-legged on the floor. He told us to close our eyes. His voice was low and steady and the words sounded like they were coming through water.*

*I almost fell asleep.*

*When it ended he gave us sweets. Black sesame and jaggery. They tasted strange, bitter and sweet at once, like medicine.*

*He stood in front of each of us until we finished eating. I chewed and swallowed. Later I wished I hadn’t.*

**20 October 2017**

*This morning the water ran red.*

*I woke to brush before school and the tap coughed brown, then red, and it stayed red. The smell was metallic. Like a coin in my mouth.*

*Mom shouted not to touch it. Dad banged on doors and found out it was the same everywhere. The uncles and the watchman went to the terrace to check the tank.*

*They found five stray dogs floating in the water. Throats cut. Eyes glassy. Their bodies swollen.*

*I didn’t see them, but my friend’s father did. He came back without any words.*

*They drained and scrubbed the tank, but all day the halls smelled of iron. At night the pipes made a wet sound like swallowing.*

*In the evening I saw Ajmera in the stairwell. He stood very still, both hands wrapped around his briefcase as if he was holding a tray.*

*He told me, “Bottled water only, beta.” He smiled as if he already knew.*

**21 October 2017**

*Ajmera came to our house today.*

*Mom said he was doing a ritual for our health and well-being. She told me to be grateful, because such rituals are difficult and he was doing it free of charge.*

*What job, I wondered. I never saw him leave the building.*

*He lit too many incense sticks. He pulled a black jagged stone from his bag and placed it on a plate. We closed our eyes and prayed. My head felt heavy, drowsy.*

*Before leaving he offered us prasad. The same black sesame and jaggery sweet.*

*I put it in my mouth but spat it into the sink when no one was looking. The taste stayed. Like tar on my tongue.*

*When he bowed goodbye, the cuffs of his shirt were damp.*

**22 October 2017**

*Sunita didi on the 14th was studying for her 10th exams again. She was kind. She always carried bags for the aunties and told me to study even when I hated it.*

*Last week I gave her a chocolate for luck.*

*Today Mom said I couldn’t visit. She has gone to God, she said. Later my friend whispered she had jumped.*

*The aunties cried into their sarees. Their voices sounded like rain falling indoors.*

*I looked up at the roof and saw a figure on the parapet. For one long second. A man. A briefcase in his hand.*

*I blinked. Nothing there.*

*The corridor smelled faintly of incense that didn’t belong to our house.*

**23 October 2017**

*School was closed. Everyone stayed in. Dad didn’t go to work.*

*Police in brown uniforms stood at the gate and pulled tape across the entrance. I’ve only seen those uniforms in textbooks. Their shoes were too clean for our dust.*

*They said someone died in 5A. My best friend Shiva lived there with his grandparents.*

*I waited by the door.*

*When Dad came back his face looked wrong. He whispered to Mom that all three had hung themselves. Mom broke in the kitchen. She tried to cry quietly, but I heard her.*

*Ajmera was outside, speaking softly to the policemen. He poured them tea and stood too close to the tape.*

*He said we are family. He said it twice, as if practicing.*

*When he walked past me the smell of jaggery clung to him, heavy and old, with something like oil beneath it.*

*His smile was too polite. Too long.*

*I don’t want Mom to cry.*

The diary ended there. Blank pages followed. A pressed marigold hid between two sheets, its petals leaking a brown-orange stain into the paper like a wound that refused to dry.

I shut the book and sat very still. The air in the flat felt thicker. The walls seemed to know I was awake.

The building has a way of noticing you if you stare at it too long.

Ajmera.

I knew the name from when I was twelve, when the news shouted it over every channel. Dharavi ka Darinda. **The Beast of Dharavi**. Back then I didn’t understand.

Now I was holding the words of a boy who had.

The room was too dark. I walked into the hall for light.

I pressed the switch. The bulb flickered once, then steadied. I tugged the fan cord without thinking, desperate for movement in the heavy air.

The blades creaked into life, slow and uneven, and something swung with them.

At first I thought the shadows were playing tricks.

But then the shape turned, and my stomach turned with it.

A boy was hanging from the fan. His body dangled by strips of cloth knotted around his arms and chest, dragging him upward into the blades as they spun.

His uniform shirt was the same pale blue as the photo in the diary. His striped tie whipped against his swollen cheek with every rotation.

The sound was worse than the sight. The fan groaned under his weight, each blade clipping the air with a labored wheeze. His shoes scraped the ceiling once, then swung back down.

The smell hit a second later—incense gone sour, mixed with something metallic and rotten.

His head lolled, eyes bulging, tongue black and heavy. And yet, as he turned with the blades, I swore his gaze locked on mine, just for a heartbeat each time he swung around.

My knees gave out. I crashed to the floor, gasping like I was the one choking. I pressed my palms into my eyes, hard enough to see sparks.

When I opened them again the fan spun empty. No rope. No boy. Just the creak of old blades and the echo of a smell that clung to the back of my throat.

My heart was a drum in my chest. My vision blurred. I didn’t see the face properly, I told myself. I didn’t.

But I knew. The jaw. The eyes.

It looked like the boy in the photograph at the front of the diary.

*It looked like Shaan.*

My hands fumbled for my phone. I pulled up the landlord’s WhatsApp thread. The rules glowed back at me. I scrolled, desperate.

Was there one about lights? About the fan? Who can remember fifteen rules when a boy is spinning above your head?

As I was scrolling, my attention went to his profile picture And in my landlord's WhatsApp profile picture, the blurry one of the building at night… if I zoomed enough, I could swear the faintest light was shining from one flat.
