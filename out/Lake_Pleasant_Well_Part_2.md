I got a job three days ago. A small family-owned laundromat that sits right next to a Circle K. My savings are running low so... I got a job. You know, I thought it would distract me but it really hasn't. I just get home more exhausted than normal. Why did she have to go? What gave her the bright idea to go!? Better question. Why didn't she tell me? These are the only thoughts on my mind recently. I've yet to tell my family because Honestly, I'm to scared. What if they go to. What'll happen to them? Each time I think of her, I think of that... that well. Those drawings clearly depict cannibalism. I can't bring myself to do anything. And honestly, I'm fucking pissed more than anything. I'm pissed that I haven't done anything. And I'm pissed that she's... I have been at the ranch for a day now. My parents asked me to look after it while they were on vacation. Don't have to pay rent haha... Im going to bed right now ill update this later.





You know people are always saying they're afraid of the dark. I can understand that right? Darkness has set it. Nothing but darkness around you. The light from your house can only illuminate so far out into to open night. It can be pretty scary. I always thought the night was objectively the scariest time of the day. But I was wrong. There is no safety in daylight. There is no bliss till nightfall. I saw him watching me. I woke up this morning doing my regular routine. Eating breakfast, brushing teeth, etc. I decided to do some research. I started looking into disappearances near Phoenix. Not surprisingly in a place like Phoenix, there are a lot of missing people. I was looking for anything on my sister. Any report that was given. I did find one but it didn't give me anything new. I didn't get much further before my alarm went off scaring the shit out of me. I had woken up about an hour early and I must have forgotten to turn it off. At that moment I realized that the alarm was for waking me up for work. So I left my laptop and went to my car.





I got in my car started the engine and began to drive off. The road out is pretty long. Long enough to have two gates that you have to close manually on the way out. My parents installed them to keep anyone who decided to go further into the desert from driving up onto the property. Makes sense but I find it tedious to do every time I leave. But that's just me. After about a minute I get to the first gate and I get out and close it. Hop back in and start heading to the next one. But as I'm driving I take a quick look in the rearview mirror. And I see up on the cliff side a figure standing at the top looking in my direction. I tap the brakes and slow down to a crawl as I stare at this clearly human figure staring presumably at me. I keep at a crawl for about another twenty seconds or so before finally stopping. I sit and wait. As I  do I notice my palms are pretty sweaty. And I feel just a tad uneasy. I wait hoping this figure just walks away or something but it just stands there.





My patients starts to give as I sit. At that moment I remember trying to decide whether I was going to keep going or turn back. My mind filled with what could or what would happen if I stayed or went. And my thoughts were instantly interrupted by what I saw just below him. Another figure staring from a distance. He definitely wasn't there the first time I looked. What I did next was. To put it bluntly, stupid. All I could think about was so many questions at that moment. Who are they? What do they want? Do they have Sarah!? Well... I wanted answers. I put the car in reverse and peeled out of the rough gravel below flying backward scared and confused but determined to get something. But I hadn't even moved thirty feet before I hit the brakes this time hard. Halting the vehicle.





They were gone. thinking back now. I don't even know if they were there in the first place. But never the less. They were gone. Was I going crazy? Am I Going crazy? They were there for a moment and by the time I had hit reversed and started moving they had disappeared. I vividly remember sitting there with the engine running for about thirty minutes. Thinking back. Don't know what I was thinking about. I just remember being utterly confused and angry. Furious really. Like whoever these people were they were fucking with me. for the fun of it. My anger slowly simmered to a horrifying feeling. Someone is watching me. And Something tells me they come from well. I drove off and finished my day of work.  I met the lady that ran the place and her daughter. Me and her got along pretty well actually and for a second I was in bliss. I hadn't thought about well anything throughout the whole day. That is till I reached the on the way back to the ranch. Where my thoughts about work were abruptly interrupted when I hit the rough and bumpy dirt road. And my uneasy feeling from this morning came to crawl back up when "that" mountain came into view.





I cautiously made my way back to the house. From there I skipped dinner and I of course made sure every door was locked. Then I went straight to my bed. Exhausted like normal I would have slept just fine. But the recent memory of those figures were the only things keeping me up for most of that night. I eventually close my eyes and wake at noon to the sound of my phone ringing. I look and it is an unknown number. Normally I would ignore this but at the time I had yet to get my boss's number so I didn't want to take my chances of missing her call. I answer and all I hear is static. I wait about twenty seconds before I go to hang up but I'm stopped by the disturbing sound of breathing. Heavy labored breathing mixed in with the static. A shiver goes down my spine. I'm frozen. I do however manage to muster up the words



Maxus- He- Hello?





There was never an answer. But I do know who was on the other side. I look up at the clock and in my peripheral I see standing in a bush, fifteen feet or so away from my window, A man staring in at me holding the phone. My stomach drops. And I'm stuck there staring. My grip on my phone loosened. And my phone slips out of my hand as I am stuck in a petrified state of fear. It's immediately clear why he is breathing so heavily. He's wearing the head of a donkey. The head is much smaller I recall than an adult. So it must have been a younger and smaller one. The man was not completely naked. barely any muscle at all. In fact, he looked very frail almost malnourished even. The staring went on for about another ten seconds before I heard something from the phone. He had spoken. However, I didn't hear it because my phone had fallen out of my hands and it was not on speaker. But he had said something. The only word I could make out was... Feast. The stare didn't last much longer after that. He hung up the phone and casually walked down the road before running off toward the direction of the mountain.





I called the police not long after that. They snooped around and didn't find anything. No tracks no nothing. No sign of anyone near me. They told me to keep an eye out and call if I needed anything before they headed off. And that brings us to now. I've been in bed for at least more than a day now. Haven't moved much. I did research some more. Turns out there was a woman who went missing about three years ago. Right near... Lake Pleasant. I was right when I said the mountain was watching. it still is. I have been desperately trying to turn off my brain. Trying to not think of what they di- have done to Sarah. I'm scared. I'm Really fucking scared. The desert is so quiet tonight. Nothing but the small solar-powered lights that are spread throughout the long driveway. Each one with just enough light to illuminate the base of the many agave plants and the tall Emory Oaks. I think I have to do something. Something bad is coming. And I don't wanna sit around and wait as these freaks watch me through my windows. I'm going tomorrow night. I'm going to that well. And I'm going to find Sarah. And we're gonna move far away from that fucking mountain.



The desert's quiet...

I'm on my way Sarah.
