I think it was the third or fourth night that I was staying over at David’s place that I realised I could understand what they were saying.   
The crows, I mean. I could understand what they were saying. Or rather, cawing.   
I remember the morning- waking up, staring at the unfamiliar ceiling, David breathing gently beside me. The cawing broke through the window, and I heard words. I stiffened.   
And then relaxed. There was nothing to be scared of. The words were quite innocuous. Wind. Up. Clouds. Here. There. Cars. Food. They filtered through to me. I got up, and walked to the living room to figure out how to use the coffee machine. Why do these things work differently in every place?  
David didn’t get up. I stayed in the living room, eating breakfast and playing on my phone, unbothered by the words trickling through. Then I went back to the bedroom. “David?”  
He grunted, then reached up and pulled me back in. “Where were you?”  
“Just in the living room”.  
“What were you doing in there?”  
“Oh just had something to eat. Playing on my phone, you know.”  
He frowned, muttered something like “fucking phone phone all the fucking time”. The mood between us shifted, soured. I didn’t understand why he was upset.  
   
But then, as if a cloud passed, he became happy again, and everything was delightful. I forgot about the cawing.  
Days passed, becoming months. Everything was lovely, except when it was not. I woke up in the mornings before David, listening to the crows. I tried to stay in bed with him, timing myself to his rhythms, because he seemed so much happier when I did, and everything was just so much better when he was happy.  
I didn’t tell anyone about the crows- why would I? It seemed like a trivial, pointless ability to have. And besides, I had other things to worry about.   
David was so difficult to keep happy. That’s all I wanted. But it never seemed to be working. It seemed to become easier and easier to make him unhappy. Sometimes it felt everything I did was wrong. But it would always pass, he would be lovely again, and we would have a lovely time together, and I’d find myself waking up to the cawing, trying to keep still so as to not wake David up, but not wanting to leave the bed either. Neither of those options were correct. I just listened to the words. Sky. Up. Over here. Water. Food.  
Then one evening his unhappiness didn’t pass, and everything I said and did seemed to make it worse. It morphed into madness, and I spotted a glint in his eyes as he yelled at me that I hadn’t seen before. I cringed back in fear as he squared up to me, my back against the wall.   
Then he dropped back, shook himself and left the house, banging the door behind him.              
The fear slowly drained from me, giving way to a misery I never knew was possible to  feel. I went to bed not knowing what else to do, and fell asleep sobbing.   
The harsh caw cawing entered my sleep. Images of crows swirling against the clouds filled my brain. A particularly loud caw ripped my sleep apart and I jerked up, gasping. I was awake, and the sound of the crow filled the bedroom. I could see its outline behind the gauzy curtain at the window, grey in the early dawn light.   
There was no sign of David.  
“Leave!” The beak opened and closed. I got up, and slowly went to the window. I pushed the gauze aside.   
“Leave!” repeated the crow. “He will kill you. He is coming back now.”  
I stared at the large black bird, unable to move.  
“Run! We will slow him down!” The grey sky seemed to turn black as thousands of crows rose, cawing and then descending towards  the driveway. I could hear the car.   
I became galvanized. Grabbing my phone, I rushed out of the back door, and left his house. I began running down the streets.  
I never went back to that neighbourhood, and never heard crows talk again.
