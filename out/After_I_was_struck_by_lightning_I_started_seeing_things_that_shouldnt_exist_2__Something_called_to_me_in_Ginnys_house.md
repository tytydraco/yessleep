[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11pevp1/after_i_was_struck_by_lightning_i_started_seeing/)

I slept in complete darkness, the blinds closed so no light would penetrate the house even as morning came. My sleep was plagued by nightmares - shadows ravagin the world, encompassing all light, streetlamps, torches, bioluminescent creatures, until finally the sun was smothered to death, leaving earth and the galaxy in eternal darkness.

That morning I texted Fred that everything was fine at the house; nothing of note. The decision to not tell him about the lamp was a sort of last hurrah to Ginny - I wanted to protect her memory in any way I could. It’s the least I could do. Hopefully Fred would speak of her more respectfully once he saw the house for himself - how clean and tidy and well kept it was; how it was a representation of her character.

After Fred texted me back saying “good to hear. Thanks Nick,” I called up my doctor’s office to move up my checkup. I didn’t want to let them in on the whole truth so they wouldn't think I’m completely insane. Instead, I said that my vision seemed a bit off, wherein objects and light would sometimes behave weirdly. Not that they cared for my specific reasoning; my insurance covered everything that could go wrong - and plenty more - so they kindly scheduled me an appointment for the following day. I called off work, citing something about post-traumatic symptoms of the accident, and spent the rest of the day cooped up in my dark, lonely house, envisioning a pitch black world.

The next day at the doctor’s, I was given another EKG, along with some other basic tests concerning eyesight, cognitive abilities, and physical ailments. After a couple hours of being prodded and poked, following objects with my eyes, and answering quizzes, they concluded that there was nothing inherently wrong with me - in fact, my burns were healing remarkably fast. When I reiterated my symptoms, the doctor implied that, with survivors of lightning strikes, anything can happen post-accident. He recommended that I wait for a few more weeks and see if things improve, but to call in case any dramatic changes occurred.

After I got back home, I called up my boss and asked for a few more days off, saying that I’d just visited the doctor for the symptoms I had earlier. I kept my explanation intentionally vague, since I knew that the whole thing made him uncomfortable. At work, he couldn’t rescind the wince his face made every time he saw my burns, or even just the bandages. Whenever I’d talk about the accident, he would suddenly leave the room. Another man’s queasiness is another man's paid time off, I guess, and I’m sure he was nothing if not relieved to not have to look at my burned and bruised body for a few days. He said to take as much time as I needed, which I intended to do in full.

I stocked up on groceries and huddled back up in my house. I finally relaxed enough to keep some lights on and have my blinds open. For the next couple of days I stared at screens and buried myself in One Piece, watching the seemingly never-ending anime for hours at a time. This kept grief at bay, instead numbing me into a comfortable, gray existence where I blocked my mind from wandering too far.

One morning, I woke up to the flutter of men yelling and trucks beeping. I checked my phone and became instantly furious as it told me the time: six-in-the-fucking-morning, the witching hour of suburbia, when no man should make a sound, thereby interrupting the volatile sleeping patterns of honest working people.

I jumped up from my bed in fury and ran to the bedroom window as I smudged my crusty eyes and tried to focus my gaze. When I looked outside to find the culprit, my anger turned to frustration turned to every memory I had of Ginny flooding my mind in an instant. A large truck had backed up to Ginny’s driveway, workers lifting and carrying furniture and boxes from the house to the truck, like worker ants fetching leaves and sticks to their nest.

All that she owned and all that was left of her on this planet was moved to that truck by noon. Through the open blinds and the missing curtains in her house I could see its rooms stand empty, void of all things Ginny. After the truck left along with the workers, someone came and knocked on my door. It was a man, whose voice I quickly recognized as he introduced himself as Fred Murphy, Ginny’s father.

“So, you must be Nick Fowler. Pleased to meet you. I’m just here to thank you again for doing that checkup on the house - you were indeed correct, it was tidy as can be.”

“Glad I could help, and again, sorry for your loss,” I said solemnly. Upon the word *loss* his eyes instantly averted to something in the distance as he gave a small nod.

I decided to move the conversation away from Ginny. “So, you moving in? Those workers got that place cleaned out pretty quick,” I asked, trying to hide my lingering annoyance at the early wake up as it occurred to me I’d be needing a nap soon.

Fred turned his gaze back to me, glad to talk of something more mundane “No, no… I decided to sell it. Preferably as soon as possible. Sorry if the movers woke you up, I just needed to get this done as quickly as I could. I’m quite comfortable where I live, and it would just be a hassle to try and move in or rent it out. Better to just get rid of it, and cover the funeral service with the cash.”

“Yeah, I get that.”

At that moment, it felt like Fred finally took a *real* look at me, noticing the burns and bandages and the unkempt house behind me; like he’d been snapped out of a trance, bringing him tumbling back into the present.

“Y’know, me and Ginny’s mom bought that house together way, *wayy* back. It was our first house - this was before Ginny and before the cancer.”

“The cancer?” I asked, immediately embarrassed if I’d crossed a line, although Fred didn’t flinch at the question, like it was routine.

“In the lungs. Marge took it in stride, but ultimately it defeated her, although she fought like a real champion. I couldn’t bear living in that house alone, so I moved away. Ginny said she could take over the house, and so she did. She always did things her way. Back then she was just a college student, and a bit sloppy regarding her homekeeping. One time she’d blacked out in the shower after coming home from a party, her ass covering the drain. The whole house was flooded by the time she woke up.” Fred let out a long sigh, followed by a singular, bittersweet chuckle accompanied by a faint smirk.

“That’s why I asked you to check the house beforehand, but I should’ve been smart enough to realize that after living there for so long, she was more than capable of handling the responsibility.”

“She was one of the most responsible people I knew,” I replied. “Always there when the garbage truck came. Always triple-checking that the door was locked when she left. Sometimes she’d get in her car and then drive back five minutes later to check the door once more, just to make sure. Shit, once she texted *me* that I’d left my back door slightly ajar.”

Fred gave a hearty laugh that he seemed to surprise himself with, almost embarrassed at its sound. “Yup. She got *that* from her mother,” he said, still chuckling.

After his laugh subsided, he gave me a warm smile and reached out his hand for a shake. I grabbed it, making sure to grip it firmly, like I was trying to prove myself to the dad of the girl I liked, which I guess didn’t make much sense posthumously.

“Good to meet ya, Nick. I’m glad Ginny had someone like you in her life.”

“I’m glad too. It was good to meet you, Mr. Murphy.”

And so, Fred Murphy left with a respectful nod, as men often do, taking with him the last bit left of Ginny.

During the following couple of days, more people came in and out of Ginny’s house: contractors, cleaners, realtors. Together they made sure the house was in tip-top shape for potential buyers. I watched them work through the windows, amazed and saddened at their efficiency. As I followed the process, I couldn’t stop thinking about the shadow in Ginny’s bedroom.

If I stopped watching the house, it started to call to me, demanding my gaze like a lighthouse in the distance. The idea of going inside the house started to infect my mind, rummaging through the corners of my brain, toppling over all other thoughts, overloading neural pathways until its demands were met. It was all melding together in my mind: the darkened earth, the shadow in Ginny’s room, and the alien *hunger* to go inside.

On the third day, after the contractors and cleaners had done their duty and the realtor had photographed and filmed the property, I decided to pay a visit to the house in the dark of night, when no one was around. There was *something* there, I could feel it. I stepped out after midnight and approached the house, the warm day betrayed by the chilly autumn night.

To my surprise, the key still fit. After all the work they’d done to the house, I’d thought they would have changed the locks while they were at it, especially since Fred hadn't asked for the spare key back.

Stepping into the house, I could hardly believe it was the same place where Ginny had lived. Fresh paint adorned the walls, new carpeting ruffled under my shoes, and the smell was no longer that of life, instead a sweet, tangy lemon left from industrial cleaning products. Although I’d seen all of this work done through windows, experiencing it myself was like walking into a sterile, steel morgue. The emptiness, the smell, the nooks and crannies -- it was all overwhelmingly devoid of life, a mall built upon a graveyard.

I walked down the hallway into the living room. On my left was one of the windows through which I’d watched the workers. On the opposite end, previously out of sight to me, was a door. I stared at it, confused as I tried to visualize the dimensions of the property in my mind. *By all accounts, that door should lead outside*, I thought. *Maybe it does. Maybe Ginny had a bookcase in front of it, which would make sense because who needs a door leading outside from their living room? No way to know until I tried.*

I pushed the door handle, and as the door’s seal was cracked, a gust of cool air pushed it open the rest of the way, slamming it against its hinges. I expected to see the fence surrounding Ginny’s property, but instead I saw something that couldn’t possibly exist.

Before me laid a staircased tunnel that burrowed into the earth on a gentle slope. What made it unfit for reality was its size: its width and height must have both been closer to two hundred yards. From the ceiling hung defiantly large, rusted oil lamps connected by chains as thick as limbs, which gave the tunnel just enough light to reveal itself in full.

Similarly, the stairs were gigantic in size; unevenly laid, wide and nearly ten yards in length. To walk down them would require a small jump down on each step, and similarly a light climb when coming up. The stairs were caked in grime, black as night, like something filthy had walked over them a thousand times over.

Looking down I could not see a landing or a curve, the tunnel seemingly endless. The draft that had slammed the door open now raised the hairs on my skin, its temperature cold and its smell musty and ripe with mildew. Although the sight screamed *wretched*, I felt the deep dark within the tunnel calling to me, welcoming me into the maw of the beast.

The surreal sight was so vivid that I could not ignore it. What I saw and felt was senseless, impossible, and abyssal - but real. Stepping inside of the tunnel materialized itself before the decision to do so; in an instant I stood on the topmost stair, breathing in the humid air. Behind me I heard rocks scraping against each other in loud screeches. Turning around, I saw a glimpse of the door through cracks in the black rock, then it was gone, consumed by the wall itself. The rock wall solidified and returned to inertia, leaving only the glow and hum of the tall flames above. I was left with no choice but to start my descent, hoping to find another exit.

The tunnel was confoundingly monotonous; if not for the gentle slope it would have been impossible to distinct one end from the other. As I walked down the gigantic steps, taking careful jumps on each ledge, I felt as if I was in purgatory, forever looping downwards, never to find an end. The air felt thick and light seemed to travel shorter distances in the corridor, the fires above weak illuminators, the darkness an impenetrable mist.

Soon I started to make out sounds coming from further down the tunnel: groans and hisses, splashes and disembodied roars. I inched closer and closer, the sounds' amplifying as their primary sources fused with the echoes produced by the tunnel. Suddenly, I saw the bottom of the stairs, and took swift leaps and great strides to reach it as fast as I could.

As I reached the bottom, the tunnel’s mouth widened as it opened up into an enormous, dome-like room, as was evident by the slight curvature of the walls around me. Its true size was impossible to decipher, as the nearmost walls continued onward in a modest curvature until they were swallowed by darkness - the same holding true for the ceiling. In front of me, some hundred yards away, I saw the thing that made its residence in this tomb. From its body wafted a foul, hot stench that seemed to stick to my skin. It breathed in slow, large exhales and violent gasps that moved its giant, bloated body in mesmerizing waves that shook the ground.

The thing was the approximate shape of a slightly deflated basketball, parts of its body continuing in abhorrent, thick tentacles, that evaporated into the darkness of the room. Its magnitude was insurmountable, the visible ball-like torso the size of a large office building. Underneath its skin were bioluminescent strands similar to blood veins, that pulsated in their deep blue glow.  Black tar-like substance oozed across its uneven body, infected by thousands of jutting bumps and crevices and fleshy scars. I could hear its giant tentacles slither across walls and high above as they twisted their way across the black rock around the room.

Suddenly, a thousand blots of yellowy white appeared on the creature's body, the uneven orbs clumped together like the florets of a cauliflower.

**Eyes**. A thousand eyes, all staring directly at *me*.

My legs burned with an itch to run as far away as I could until I dropped from sheer exhaustion, but the panic brewing inside of me gave an unrelenting reminder of an important, terrifying fact: there was nowhere to go; flight was no option.

A rumble shook the room as the creature shifted in place, flexing itself to face me with its fleshy exterior, although for me its eyes were the only clue of what forward-facing meant for such an abomination. A loud voice spoke in a foul language I did not recognize, its sounds consisting of chatterings, puffs, and long strings of consonants, each phrase beckoning a curse of its own. Although the language was foreign to me, I understood each word and sentence in perfect clarity.

“You have heard my calling. I am glad of your presence,” the creature said, its eyes shifting in slight movements as it scanned the surroundings. Scanned *me*.

I swallowed the ball that had formed inside my throat and replied with as much gusto as I could muster “Who are you? How can I understand what you are saying?”

“I am Moros, the bringer of death. Although that you probably knew - the Keres are not known for their silence in matters of death, feasting upon it like jackals, hardly surreptitious.”

The thing paused for a moment, its eyes relaxing, seemingly satisfied with the scan of the room.

“I speak the language of R’lyeh, which all creatures understand, but only the eternal can speak.”

“Eternal? So like God?” I asked, wanting to continue the conversation as I raked my panicking mind for a possible escape.

“*Yessss*,” it said, in a deep hiss that electrified the air.

The thing's eyes widened as it spoke, and black tar oozed out of its myriad of crevices as it became intoxicated by fantasy “I am the guiding hand of destruction, of which no thing can escape. Each mortal death is destined by me. I have moved battlefields and made wars with no end - men slaughtering villages, women and children included. I have guided the minds of great scientists to construct bombs that evaporate cities. Each newborn choked to death before seeing the sun, and each mother bled dry by their son’s rising. The thousands who each day slit their wrists and drown themselves in medicine, overloading their body to ruin. The diseases which plague mankind each hundred years, smothering out the weak and the old. Men wrought with old age, kept alive by machines as their loved ones die before them, leaving them alone until their doom.”

A meek pause was followed by a growl that rattled my bones “**I am the architect of death.**”

“Does -- does that mean you killed Ginny?” I asked.

“Like all, her death was fated by my hand. I thank you for your part in that - what a peculiar coincidence you brought me through your meeting. Through your intervention, I could construct her fated death to fall on that day.”

The panic that had brewed inside my mind evolved into sheer *hate*. My sweaty hands clenched into fists as I drew blood from the side of my mouth as I clenched my teeth tight.

“So, what? You got me here to finish the job? Well fucking kill me, then. If you know it and it’s gonna happen since you’re the god of death, just do it. Or are you gonna bore me to death with another dumb fucking monologue?”

As the words slipped my mouth, fear intruded upon me. I’d just threatened something that could, for all I knew, bring down literal hell upon me, just to see me suffer until my inevitable death.

“Death is indeed what I am here to offer you, a chance to reunite with Ginny. It would give me great pleasure to see you die.”

“If you are the ‘architect of death’, why the speech? If you already know how everyone is going to die, and you manifest that death, why ask me? That’s what you did with Ginny, and now it’s my turn, isn’t it? Then just KILL me already!” I screamed, accepting that there was no escape - somehow knowing that my threats and insubordination had no effect on my chances of survival.

For a moment, the thing seemed to squint its eyes in surprise, assessing my words.

“I do not know your death, for it is not I who destines it. Instead, I can offer you safe passage to Ginny in exchange for your demise, but you, Nick Fowler, must make that decision yourself.”

“How? How do you not know? Is this some kind of sick game?” I shouted at the creature.

Its thousand eyes squinted in unison, staring me directly into my eyes as it replied “Each mortal death is destined by me. You are not mortal, so I cannot see your fate, nor can I influence it without your beckoning. Your affair with the woman brought you to my knowledge, a fated mortal death interfered outside my all-knowing.”

The creature paused, gauging whether I’d understood his words, then continued.

“I offer you a choice: safe passage over Styx - reunitement with your Ginny. You are alone, Fowler, that much I know. This is your last chance. If you decline my offer, it is your choice, although I cannot guarantee that the others will be so gentle.”
