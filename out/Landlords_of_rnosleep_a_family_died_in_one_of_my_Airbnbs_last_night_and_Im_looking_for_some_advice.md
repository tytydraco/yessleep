Just to be clear, and before anyone lectures me, I know I have to go to the police about this. I thought maybe I should come here first to see anyone has dealt with something similar or had some advice. I’m also open to the idea of selling this property so if you might be interested, read through and let’s chat.   
  
Some background: my business partner and I are developers in Upstate New York mostly specializing in buying out undervalued properties or getting them in foreclosure and turning them into getaway Airbnb’s for people from the city. Rural or low-income people often times also have no clue what they have and you can low ball them and if you offer cash we’ve had a pretty impressive hit rate on that. I’m not going to name the exact region or towns for obvious reasons but we have a pretty incredible portfolio at this point and post Covid, city people with money are starving to spend a weekend in the woods or a cute little town and you can charge a premium. We do the whole thing with the artisanal gift baskets and local honey and soap, etc. and people just eat that shit up.   
  
Recently my partner and I were scouting new properties (to be accurate we are *always* scouting new properties), and this open parcel came up in our database and the day it went on the market we basically burned out the turbo on the Land Rover trying to see it first. If you aren’t a landlord, you probably wouldn’t understand the thrill of acquisition but arriving there first and trying to close the deal before anyone else is honestly half the fun. When we rolled up the long driveway out into the massive meadow the realtor was waiting for us. She explained that previously the plot had been a religious community of some kind but, curiously, they had leveled everything before they left. The one thing they hadn’t leveled, though, was what we noticed immediately. Out in the middle of the meadow standing alone like a little lighthouse was an abandoned chimney and a full stone hearth. If you don’t know what I’m talking about just google *abandoned chimney*. Seriously, do it now. They are fucking sick. Often times on a really old house the hearth will be made entirely of stone or well-crafted brick and when someone gives up a house or the roof caves in and nature takes over the whole structure will disintegrate but the chimney will still be standing there like the day it was built. It’s intriguing and sort of freaky at once.  


As we crossed the meadow, the realtor reiterated our conversation we had had earlier on the phone: *the sellers were eager to sell and a reasonable offer, cash preferred, would likely be accepted immediately*. We nodded along – that’s why we were there – but it was the chimney and hearth that we were really focusing on. The masonry was immaculate and so were the carved flourishes of creatures and wagons and farm tools that would look incredible in a listing photo.  
  
“We could build the whole house around this,” I said, rapping on the stone, "look at this fucking thing!"  
  
My partner smiled and thumbed the carvings when from inside the chimney came a clacking, crawling noise.  
  
“Chimney swifts. It’s nesting season,” said the realtor. “Hopefully you’ll go easy on their rent.”  
  
After we had closed on the property, we broke ground immediately and three months later we’d constructed a Nordic looking cabin expressly designed to feature the chimney. Hemlock siding. Rustic, reclaimed beams and skylights and black brushed steel features, a breakfast bar and the whole nine. Some person from Manhattan’s wet dream. We’d stuck our heads up the chimney a few times and you could see the sky and there didn’t seem to be any birds and by late May of this year we were ready for guests.  
  
After we had the cleaning ladies come and scrub out the last bits of construction dust and mop every corner, I visited on the eve of our first guest’s arrival to sign off on everything being ready to go. When I was closing the door to leave, I heard the clacking noise again coming from the chimney. We’d already filled the hearth with wood mostly for decretory and ambiance purposes, but if the guests wanted to light a fire for whatever reason those birds would just have to figure it out. Those birds could actually fuck off because whatever they were using for nesting material – some sort of blackish hairy skin like paper – kept flaking down the chimney and fouling up the vibe.  
  
A few days later, the first review posted and they gave us five stars which every host knows is important for the algorithm. It was a good review but after reading it my partner and I were left scratching our heads:  
  
*The Chimney House was everything we could have hoped for! The place was spotless, the pictures were accurate, and the meadow wildflowers were in full bloom! The hosts were even gracious enough to start the fire for us before we arrived. Some appliance was making a scratching or skittering sound – probably the fan –but the spring peepers were courteous enough to help drown it out!*  
  
 We didn’t start any fire, obviously, but people get away from the city for the weekend and get drunk and it is what it is. One of the guys who didn’t write the review must have got in there first and decided he was Prometheus.   
  
A week later we got another review:  
  
*We took a chance on a place with only one previous guest, which is something we’ve never done, but I am certainly glad we did. The interior was more spacious than it appeared from the outside (or the pictures!) and the hardwood floors were polished to perfection. If you get a chance definitely soak in the master tub. My crazy son woke us up a few times telling us he had seen a man that looked like a spider walking on the ceiling but despite his best attempts he couldn’t ruin a lovely night!*  
  
My partner almost spit up his bulletproof coffee when we read the weird son anecdote – why would you even include that? – but after the next guests stayed there our cleaning ladies sent us pictures of what looked like eight long scratch marks in front of the hearth, and above it tucked on the underside of the mantle, about the size of golf balls, were a clutch of translucent eggs.  
  
The next review deservedly had given The Chimney House five stars but the one after that contained another bizarre tidbit:  
  
  
*Talk about serenity! Do not miss walking the meadow path at twilight and the espresso machine made us feel like we were in Rome! Our hosts were gracious enough to grant us late check out which was sorely needed because my kid wouldn’t stop crying on the way out the door that he didn’t want to leave his friend “Mr. Legs.”*  
  
Which bring us to today and our latest family of guests, all of whom are dead.  
  
This morning my cleaning lady called me and I couldn’t understand a word she was saying primarily because I don’t speak Lithuanian but also because she was hysterical and kept dropping the phone.  
  
When I got there, she was stumbling out of the door covered in vomit. As she got into her car and ripped down the driveway, I tepidly turned the knob of The Chimney House and opened the door.   
  
Inside on the living room couch the family sat with their eyes gouged out all gazing at what seemed like the chandelier. Their necks were gnawed to the spine, their shoes were festooned about the room, and their intestines had been ripped out and tied together and strung up on the wall in the manner of a spider web.   
  
I’m aware that I have to tell the police at some point but this property is booked solid for the next two months and we’re something like 500k in the hole for this project and my partner and I are hesitant to cancel those reservations.   
  
This was an hour ago and I am sitting at the dining room table running some numbers right now and am understandably freaked out but with a portfolio our size there are bound to be some hiccups.  
  
Anyway, if there are any landlords in this community that have had any experience with something like this, we would be super appreciative to hear how you kept a similar property profitable. I’m also totally open to flipping The Chimney House to you – for the right price, obviously. The countertops are Calacatta marble. If you want to make an offer you can do it here or send to DM. Thanks.
