I knew something was wrong as the taxi took me into the cranny of the valley. There was a dreariness to the town and its people.

Still, my passing glances at their glum faces assured me that I should feel fortunate to be living and working in a secluded pocket of land past the outskirts of the town.

I was wrong.

“Oh, thank goodness you’re here!” the director greeted joyously from the building’s double-doored entrance. “Marion, is it?”

I nodded, following the man inside.

“Well, I’m Derrick,” he said, leading me into the kitchen. “Ben quit today, unfortunately, meaning it’s only you and me at the moment, in terms of carers. Obviously, there are three of us if you include Roger—*Kid of the Castle*, I like to call him.

“The little lad came to us under a week ago from the local hospital. You must’ve passed it on the drive into town?”

I nodded, though a frown was tickling the folds of my brow.

*Only you and me?* I internally echoed, recalling the man and woman I’d seen walking past the lounge’s windows whilst the taxi had come up the driveway.

“How was the drive?” the director asked, interrupting my thoughts with the question and the loud sloshing of boiling water pouring from the kettle into two mugs. “It’s pleasant around these parts. Quiet. Uninterrupted. Wouldn’t you say?”

The young, handsome director wouldn’t let me slip a word in edgeways, but I hardly cared; I felt a little smitten. He had a frenetic, yet alluring energy. Like junk food, I was drawn to him.

Yet, deep in the part of my gut that I was choosing to ignore, I feared that he would be *bad* for me.

Feared that I should quit my new job and leave.

“I apologise if the driver told you any stories,” Derrick sighed, handing a steaming mug to me.

“Thank you,” I said, taking the drink. “Stories?”

The director nodded. “Locals get a little superstitious, you see, when it comes to the hospital. Over the past, oh, year or so, the town’s number of maternal deaths during childbirth has been rather high.

“Mothers die, and children are left without parents, hence the heavy turnover at our lovely orphanage. Hence the need for more *helping hands* like yours.”

The way in which he cooed those words—*helping hands*—clamped my skin tightly against my body, as if some primal part of me were physically recoiling, despite how enamoured my mind otherwise felt.

In a valley of such murk and sorrow, he was a beacon of light. As I looked at Derrick, I forgot all about the sad, little houses I’d seen on my drive—and the sad, little people walking by the sad, little houses.

Still, one important question did manage to wiggle its way out of my lips. “Did none of those children have fathers? Or *anybody* to take care of them?”

Derrick frowned momentarily, before correcting his face; it was a momentary glitch that made my clenching body scream at my lusting mind, once more, to *wake up*. “You’ve worked in the social care system for years, Marion. You know how flighty they can be.”

Somewhere beneath all of the warmth and fuzziness I felt for Director Derrick, there burgeoned a doubt—prickly and unstoppable, if only I should give it the time to blossom.

“Roger!” cried Derrick suddenly.

And in walked a little boy, ten or eleven years of age, with a green waistcoat, beige trousers, and dark-brown hair slicked back into a ducktail.

“Ah, Marion!” Roger said, extending a hand. “Wonderful to meet you, my dear.”

It took all of my might not to muster a chuckle at the young boy’s eloquent tongue.

However, as we shook hands, the amusement faded. There was a coldness to his touch, and his eyes, that felt familiar somehow. Dreadfully familiar. And I found myself, much to my shame, quickly withdrawing.

“Right, it’s six o’clock,” I said. “I suppose Derrick and I ought to be making you some dinner, is that right?”

The director nodded, then put his arm around Roger’s shoulder. “I told you I’d find one heck of a lady, didn’t I?”

“You sure did, Derrick,” the boy replied, and the two laughed with locked eyes, as if they were old friends, not an orphan and his carer.

“First, let me show you to your room,” the director said, untangling himself from Roger and scooping up the suitcase by my side. “And don’t even think of offering to carry your bag, lest you wish to offend me.”

I followed Derrick up to a bedroom at the end of the corridor, and then—

*Nothing.*

To my terror, even now, I don’t entirely remember what happened.

When I think back on that evening, it is a blur. A blur of lust, laughter, and light—blinding white light, wiping my memory.

I remember, in some sense, being seduced by Derrick. I remember clothes leaving our bodies, and I remember the sun coming up.

I suppose we mustn’t have made dinner in the end.

Or perhaps I had *some* memory of the night, before the morning arrived with a surprise that drowned any other thought. A surprise that left me caterwauling at the bathroom mirror.

A bulge was protruding from my abdomen.

The impossible bulge of a woman four or five months into a pregnancy.

I staggered back into the bedroom and gasped at Derrick, who was sitting in a pair of boxers at the edge of the bed, smiling face bearing a few more wrinkles than the day before.

“Heavens, Marion, you look as if you’ve seen a ghost,” he said softly.

Only, his voice had become soft not like butter, but like *rot*—like some poisonous and deceptive delicacy that had finally spoilt in the sun pouring through our bedroom window.

“What… have you done to me…?” I slurred between breathy, fearful sobs.

The director suddenly shot to his feet. “Just relax, Marion, and we’ll get to the bottom of—”

I scurried towards the upstairs landing.

As pursuing feet sounded along the carpeted floor behind me, I knew that I was right to flee.

“Derrick?” came a croaky, pubescent voice from behind a creaking door.

“We’ll sort it out, Roger,” the director yelled back as I dashed downstairs. “She won’t get far.”

And he was right.

I tried windows.

Tried the front and back doors.

Skirted around the entire ground floor, circling back to the lobby in which Derrick waited with a big smile and open arms.

“None of this is good for the baby, Marion,” he whispered, taking steps towards me. “Goodness, you’re just about ready to burst. Before dinner time, if I had to guess.”

Then my eyes shot to the basement on my right.

I opened the door, then locked it behind me and began to descend into the orphanage’s already well-lit undercarriage.

And the loudest scream of all came when I laid my eyes upon two bodies lying in the centre of the room.

The man and woman from the lounge.

She wore a nighty—belly bulging, legs akimbo, and body resting in a pool of blood.

He wore a smile—belly flat beneath his folded hands, legs straight, and body entirely deflated, as if he were a burst balloon.

I started to hyperventilate, feeling terror-induced cramps in my core, then I keeled over. Fell to my knees and started to screech as blood gushed through my pyjama shorts.

It didn’t take a medical expert to explain what had just happened to me.

“There goes Little Derrick,” whispered a voice behind me. “Still, there’s always next time.”

Clutching my bloody lower half, I turned to see a figure leaning against the wall in a shaded nook of the room, between two shelving units.

A toddler.

Wearing eyes and lips too knowing for a boy of, at most, two years old.

Wearing an umbilical cord from his belly button, long enough to drag against the floor.

His legs wobbled as they supported his precarious upright stance.

This wasn’t a child.

“*What are you?*” I screamed at him in fear.

And the thing answered, “I am Ben.”

My stomach dropped.

A man named Ben had quit just before I came.

It surely had to be a coincidence.

*The little lad came to us less than a week ago from the local hospital.*

That was what Derrick had said about Roger, the boy aged ten or eleven. I’d assumed, at the time, that he had been in the hospital for some sort of check-up. Some sort of medical issue, minor or major.

*The little lad.*

Roger was tall for his age. Not far off my height.

I thought also of the grey hairs on Derrick’s head.

Thought of the inexplicable pregnancy bump only a few hours after the director and I had slept together.

“Who were they?” I asked, nodding tearfully at the dead woman and deflated man beside me.

Ben smiled. “She was a vessel. He was Ben. And *I* am reborn.”

My eyes welled up until all I saw were dazzling lights and blurry shapes.

The boy’s legs stopped wobbling, and he took a shaky step towards me.

It felt foolish to be frightened of someone so small—*something* so small, for these rapidly ageing creatures certainly weren’t human. Yet, I twisted on my heel and stole away, gunning for the basement window.

I hoisted myself up on cardboard boxes, wailing in horror as the door at the top of the stairs unlocked; I was struggling to slither my body, belly still bloated, through the narrow window.

“Marion?” came Derrick’s voice, along with calm footsteps down the stairs. “Marion, I…”

And then those feet came more hurriedly; the director had seen what I was doing.

He flew across the basement and swiped a hand at me a mere half-moment after I managed to pull my legs out. I pushed up from the grass below the towering building and darted away. Darted towards the bridge, crying and screaming for help as the old, double doors of the orphanage opened behind me.

“Where are you going?” called Derrick.

I heard the adolescent voice of an older Roger add, “You won’t beat us to town on foot.”

I realised they were right. I could hear their heavy shoes slapping against the gravel behind me. Horror gripped me as I prepared to face the same fate as that poor woman in the basement.

I looked over the edge of the bridge, which ran over a stream passing through the valley.

There was no other way.

I flung my weak body over the barrier.

When I woke, I was in a hospital one town over. Some locals had pulled my unconscious body out of the water, then I’d been saved from near-death by a team of, quite frankly, heroic doctors.

And, of course, I told the officials my story. Told them about the horrific orphanage and its unholy practices, though I spared some of the supernatural details, for fear that I would be sectioned.

But when police investigated the house, it was already empty.

Derrick, Roger, and Ben had fled.

Those three men are still out there, looking for vessels through which they can be reborn.
