I'm not certain how I should start to write this. It pains me greatly, and I feel like I'm going to cry at each letter that I type.



Months ago, my dear dog "Toby" died; he was the best pet I could've asked for. He was the cutest Yorkshire terrier, bigger than the average, and he was smart and would smile while wagging his tail whenever he saw you.



I remember moments, like one time when I decided it would be a good idea to sit in a chair on the balcony to observe a thunderstorm from that safety, I felt a hairy thing on my hand, and I turned to see little Toby, worried and scared out of his mind, but urging me inside.



He would go to great lengths only to protect us, even if he was tiny, even if he was weak.



He was the kind of pet that felt so integral to the family dynamic, the thought of his death never occurred to any of us... but one day his kidneys failed.



I was at work when I received the news of his passing from my mother, who was at the veterinarian's. My mother has never been a sensitive woman; she said it like the car had broken down... like it was a small inconvenience.



I remember crying so much I couldn't breathe that day. I felt I had lost much more than just a pet; I had lost a friend that I had known for over 15 years.



My little sister was my biggest worry; after all, she was the one who adopted him after I left my family home, and she felt a deep connection with the animal. When he died, I expected her to be bereaved...



I didn't expect what would happen... I can't even process what happened.



I live nearby, but I rarely visit on account of my job... that day, however, I decided to spend the night over, since I believed the family should be together.



Then I was greeted by a bigger-than-average Yorkshire who wagged his tail so amicably, so cutely and who ran at me full of life.



I remember I plummeted with my backpack; it was Toby! For a moment, it passed through my mind that his death was some sick joke my mother thought funny; it wouldn't be the first time, but then I noticed he wasn't smiling. 



I was about to say something when my mother urged me to be quiet and pointed to my little sister, who was smiling in the living room, drawing something, completely unaware.



I greeted her and went with my mother to her room while "Toby" sniffled at my heel and seemed happy to see me... when my mother and I were sitting down, and the door was closed, she finally explained.



"I suppose you have questions. I present to you Toby the third"



She said with a smile that felt cold and calculating, as if it was expecting me to smile back, but I didn't. I couldn't... this felt mocking.



How could she replace a dog I felt was so special? 



No... that wasn't the part that angered me the most.



"You lied to my sister, why? Doesn't she deserve to know he died?"



"Well, I didn't tell you, and you turned out fine... stop whining"



I felt a cold liquid running down my nape, I felt my legs wiggle...



"You didn't question me when Toby started smiling, and she hasn't questioned why it stopped; you're both slow like that"



I snapped at my mother. I don't remember what I said, but I remember it being pretty hurtful, and then I stormed out of the house.



I don't know why I feel like I'm feeling... I know she meant to protect us, but there was something in how she smiled, in how she waved it away as if it was nothing. And I feel we deserved that pain, we deserved to know, both my sister and I deserved that closure.



She will never know...



Am I in the wrong to hate my mother for lying to me for so long?
