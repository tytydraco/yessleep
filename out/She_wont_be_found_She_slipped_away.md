Long ago in my childhood, while at home on an ash-gray rainy winter day, I sat drawing in my notebook alone in my room. As I aimlessly doodled, my mind drifted to the sound of the scraping pencil and the gentle cyclic thrumming of raindrops hitting the roof overhead. Above these noises, there arose another. A voice, enveloped in some odd familiarity, speaking from somewhere downstairs. At first, I thought my father had returned with a friend he had run into and they were having a conversation, or my little sister was speaking to an imaginary friend of hers, but as I listened closer, I could not only not detect another speaker, but the voice repeated the same phrase over and over, like a record stuck in the final groove of its spiral.

I descended the stairs to investigate and found neither my father, nor my sister, to be the source. Dad had left some time ago to buy groceries, and my sister must have been up in her room. Aside from the rain, there was silence, and the repetition of the voice. It could be heard slightly clearer now, coming from a far corner of the living room.

I crossed the room and approached the source of the sound, which I could not yet discern. It seemed like it came from nowhere in particular, simply emanating from a point in space beside the old burgundy armchair, spoken by formless air. Despite its impossibility, it repeated the same phrase.

"She won't be found. She slipped away."

Now that I heard it clearly, I realized the reason for my familiarity with its intonation. The voice, it seemed, was my own. Recorded or reflected somehow, stolen from my own lips, it was unquestionably my voice. But the words were not any I had ever spoken. I had no recollection of ever saying the phrase in my then-short life, nor could I imagine any reason to. But here was my voice, speaking them as clearly as I would from my own lips.

"She won't be found. She slipped away." it grotesquely recited.

I stood there in shock, hoping that my realization of this perverse phenomena would cause it to cease, like all manner of shadowy apparitions banished by sight or recognition of their form. But whatever cosmic tape loop that it emanated from refused to cease, and it repeated yet again. And again. Another time, and again as I ran from the living room, the words echoing behind me as I ran out the front door into the cold embrace of the rain, the sound of the falling water banishing the voice from my ears as it continued to echo in my mind, looping undeterred.

After many hours, my father found me huddled and shaking beneath the boughs of a sturdy pine some miles away from the house. In the car, I couldn't bring myself to explain the reason I had for fleeing, as there was no explanation I could give that made sense to me, nor would make sense in any configuration of reality I hoped to still exist in.

He quickly abandoned his search for motive and changed the subject to my sister. He had returned to the house to find both of us missing, and now she was still out somewhere in the world. He questioned me, frantically, asking if I knew where she had gone.

As if compelled, I could only repeat the same damnable phrase. As I did, I saw his eyes reflected in the rear view mirror. In them was a grim recognition, a sense of connection and confirmation that he had heard the same thing, and gone through the same fruitless speculation as I. He could make no more sense of it than I, a child, and thus we were condemned to its grim and inscrutable prophecy.

The police would search for my sister over the coming days, which bled into weeks and months. To this day she has not been found. I have no hope of her return, and can only try to quiet my mind by keeping myself preoccupied with comforting banalities. For my father, there was no such comfort. He became consumed with the futility of a deterministic existence, knowing there was nothing he could have done to save his daughter.

I still think of her with every word I write, and with every drop of rain that falls. I try not to think about what puppet strings pulled taut at my limbs, even now as I write these words. I try not to think about what predestined stitch of cosmic fabric that voice could have slipped through. If the appearance of my voice was itself part of the same long-tempered metal of the cosmos. I try not to think about to where she could have slipped away.
