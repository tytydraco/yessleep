It started with an email.

After spending most of the day trying and failing to make Starbucks drinks with tongue twister names and being spat at by customers, the last thing I wanted was to check my emails. I would just do a skim through. That’s what I told myself—and after scrolling through spam and job rejections, I found myself staring at one which piqued my interest. The sender was Amazon. But I didn’t remember ordering anything. It didn’t look like a scam. When I clicked on it after hesitating, the email popped onto my screen and I found myself losing all the breath in my lungs.

I should delete it, I thought, hovering my mouse over the trash button.

But I couldn’t.

Instead, I found myself clicking on the link—my heart in my throat.

I don’t know if it was the email, or that it was almost the eighth year anniversary of their disappearance, but something snapped in my mind, and I found myself once again internally spiralling. All the emotions I’d felt, that I’d tried to push down. Feelings I shoved to the back of my head to build a façade that I wasn’t crumbling. That I was completely okay. 

Eight fucking years of pain and longing and healing—all of it shattering apart in favour for my most precious memory hitting me, one that I had intentionally supressed. I had told the story so many times to my therapist, and she told me it wasn’t my fault and that it had nothing to do with me. 

Except I couldn’t believe that. 

How could I try and convince my own paranoia, that tightening stranglehold around my neck, that it wasn’t my fault? That I didn’t cause it? Even knowing deep, deep down it really wasn’t anything to do with me, my brain wanted me to think otherwise. It wanted me to feel guilty. For something which was completely out of my control.  After surrendering myself to therapy, and then never going back after three sessions, I pushed everything down. 

I should have known that it would come back to bite me on the ass. That no matter what I did to distract myself every fucking  day, I was bound to be plunged back into my own personal oblivion. One second I was twenty five years old sitting in my apartment against the backdrop of a rainy November evening, and in the blink of an eye I was eighteen years old again. It was senior year and I had a record breaking 0 friends. I did try, but it was hard to get past that first hurdle: Talking. Sure, it’s easy for some people.

 I knew of kids who could make a friend in a matter of seconds. 

I didn’t have the confidence to just walk up to someone and strike a conversation. It’s fucking hard. I know mental health is taken a lot more seriously nowadays, but when I was in school, anxiety was only just being recognised as a genuine disorder. Which the teachers still didn’t understand. 

So, I was classed as “shy” and “not doing enough to participate in discussion”.  I did however have an unhealthy one sided relationship with three other kids since we were little. Which had quickly become more of an obsession than a liking. My infatuation with Annalise Duval and her friends began in Kindergarten when they refused to let me join in with their live-action game of Scooby Doo.  

They needed a Shaggy, and I rocked up to them with a giant grin, pointing to my bright green dress. But they just exchanged glances, shaking their heads and giggling. I spent the rest of the day following them around and begging them. And if that wasn’t embarrassing enough, our teacher gave me a stern talking to. The three wanted me to leave them alone, but as a kid, I didn’t want to do that. Annalise Duval, Jasper O’ Brien and Jack Locke were the bane of my existence throughout my whole childhood.

 But I also loved them. 

I’m not sure what kind of love it was, especially as a child. As I grew up though, it became more than infatuation. I started to get butterflies when we hit middle school, and then burning cheeks when puberty slammed into me, and I realised I liked both boys and girls. It was mainly Annalise. 

How could I not like Annalise? 

She was like a real-life princess to me. Her hair was almost to her tailbone, a shimmering red like Ariel, and she wore pink like she owned the colour, often coming into class brandishing a pink dress, or a baby pink shorts and t-shirt combo. The boys were often mistaken as twins. Jack had dark curls, while Jasper sported sandy blonde hair his mother would sometimes tie into a ponytail. He got teased once for it—before Jack threw a book at the kid’s head. 

Nobody ever bothered him again. While Annalise was the Princess, I couldn’t help falling for her knight’s in shining armour too. And I didn’t really know why. There was nothing special about them really.  

Well, to others there wasn’t. To me, they were the light in a dark room. While the rest of the world was boring and grey, Annalise and the guys were  interesting and colourful. They made me actually want to go to school, even when I spent most of the day keeping my head down and my mouth shut.

When we were kids, Annalise and her friends made up their own games which had these intense plot lines thought up in a matter of minutes. I saw them crawling across the carpet looking for buried treasure and pretending to climb the classroom walls. In their imagination they could be anywhere in the world. 

They could be anything. Unlike the other kids who sat and read books and played with toys, the three of them wanted to make their own fun. Middle school, they hung out together and had this unbreakable bond which never severed. High school, I never saw them. 

They had a hideout in the art room on the very top floor of our school, and if anyone so much as bothered them, they were verbally ripped to shreds. So, that’s where it started. This obsession with them began when I was a little kid, and unfortunately, due to my own problems with making friends, as well as seeing them as literal god’s who could do nothing wrong, our embarrassingly one-sided relationship bled into teenagehood too. I won’t say they were nice people. Annalise and her gang were pretty fucking awful as the four of us grew up together. They never let me join in their games, and if they did, I had to guess a password which was never right.  As we got older, I  stopped wanting to play games with them-- I wanted to know them. Understand them. 

I wanted to know why Annalise was obsessed with germs, carrying hand sanitizer everywhere. I wanted to know why Jack refused to wear his glasses and crashed into things, bumping into people, and squinting at the whiteboard like his life depended on it.  What I really wanted to know was why they were so close. Why they had never branched out and made other friends over the years.  

I guess it confused me. Why nobody else had been invited into their inner circle.

It was always them. 

Annalise, Jasper and Jack.  I couldn’t help crushing on all three of them, and it’s not like they made it easy, taking every chance to tease and bully me. As kids, and then teenagers. When we were five, it was passworded games, and fifteen, I had to carry their bags up seven staircases, only for them to slam the door in my face after they promised I could hang out with them. Yes. I know it was pathetic.

But I was a seventeen year old desperate for friends and idolised them like they were the 2nd, 3rd and 4th comings of Christ. They didn’t even  turn me down, which was worse. The three wanted to play with my fucking heart. And… I guess you could say I’d had enough. I’d had enough of being ignored. 

They weren’t just ignorant. 

They loved the way I squirmed, making a performance out of belittling me  to a gleeful audience of our classmates. So, I was done with them. I had gone three days without thinking about them, ignoring my blazing cheeks when they walked by. Classes were over, and I was waiting for my dad, sitting on the wall in front of the school. The sun was already setting, and I was frowning at blurs of red and orange streaking the clouds, kicking my legs. 

I was starting to regret wearing a skirt when it was bitterly cold. Sure, I suited it several hours earlier in front of my bedroom mirror. But now day was bleeding into night, and I had once again forgotten my jacket, all I could do was mentally kick myself. 

Dad was taking ages as usual. I was halfway through the sandwich I’d forgotten to eat for lunch, when a shadow loomed over me. I lifted my head, instantly recognising Jack’s bright red jacket I was sure was permanently glued to his skin. His face was handsome, sure. I had fallen in love with him, just as I had with Annalise and Jasper. But his personality sucked. Jack hid under his hood a lot, so I couldn’t see his face under a dimming orange sky.

 Illuminated under a lamppost, I could see the curve of a smirk on his lips, dark eyes ignited with spite. 

As a kid, his hair had been a curly mess he kept brushing from his eyes.

Now it was clipped and perfected under a beanie.

“Glass.”

I nodded at him, swallowing my sandwich. “Jack.”

“Where have you been?” His smirk didn’t waver, and I caught that familiar childish glimmer in his eyes. 

He had never lost it.

“It’s not like you to stop following us around like alove-sick puppy.” He cocked his head. “Not that we like it. But hey, it’s cute. Pitiful, but cute.”

His words stung, but I shrugged them off. 

“Busy.” I kicked my legs and forced a grin. 

“Why? Did you miss me?”

He didn’t smile back. But I was used to it. Shoving his hands in his pockets, Jack stepped closer. I could smell coffee on his breath. Behind him, I glimpsed Annalise and Jasper keeping their distance.

 Annalise was laughing, Jasper playfully trying to yank off her woolly hat. Bathed in the light of the lamppost, they almost looked ethereal. I found myself mesmerised by them, until Jack brought me back to earth, clicking his fingers in front of my face. “Annalise wants to know if you wanna hang out,” The boy  said, with the tone of someone who was completely against it. I chewed my sandwich.

 “Uh-huh.” I nodded behind him. Jack’s friends were moving closer, and in the glow of the setting sun, I realised they still looked like they did as kids.

Annalise, skipping over cracks, her red hair tied in pigtails, and Jasper with his mouth stretched in its usual cartoonish grin. He’d cut his hair so the ponytail was non-existent, but the bed-head style he went for actually suited him well. I could count every individual freckle on his cheeks. Just seeing them enjoying each other’s company, completely relaxed and carefree, made me feel like shit. Instead of keeping my cool, I jumped off of the wall, situating myself in front of Jack, who pulled a face. 

He took a resounding step back.

It was always like that. There was always tension between us. I got it. It was an influx of overwhelming obsessive love, and also hate.

“Does Annalise not have a mouth?” I  demanded. “Why can’t she ask me herself?”

Jack laughed. And it was almost genuine.

“Are you saying no, Glass? You’ve been begging to be friends with us since we were kids, and now you’re getting cold feet?”

His words twisted my gut. I felt my cheeks blaze. “That’s not what I—”

“Oh my god, you’re adorable,” Jack folded his arms, raising a brow. “Just say you’re in love with us and get it over with.”

When I couldn’t reply, choking on a comeback, Jack stepped back. “Alright! We’ll see you tomorrow at 12?” He offered me a two fingered salute. “Don’t be late.” The boy hovered for a moment, his expression wavering, and part of wondered if he was regretting his words—if he thought he’d gone too far.

But then Jack gripped my chin with two fingers, forcing me to look at him. His eyes were cruel. I remember feeling like I was drowning, and yet sensing his touch filled me with butterflies I didn’t want. It didn’t make sense. Why him? Why them? 

Why did my body have a physical, stomach churning reaction for these three? “You’ve really gotta let it go, Glass.” Jack murmured, his grasp on my chin slipping. “This obsession you have? It’s fucking embarrassing. It was cute when we were little’s, sure. But you’re really starting to freak us out now.” He gestured behind him. “I can’t tell you why Annalise wants to hang out with you, I’m sure it’s pity. But hey, don’t let us down, alright?”

Turning to go, Jack, shot me one last patronising smile. “Lunchtime. Art room. Do you like hot cocoa?”

Something splintered inside me. Exhaust fumes hit me in the face when a van rushed by, and I had a vivid image of pushing him in front of it.

“Why are you doing this to me?” 

He frowned. I could sense the cogs in his brain turning before his lips curved into a bright smile. 

"Because you’re easy.”

Jack must have loved my expression. I wanted to cry—but I refused to give him the satisfaction. He scoffed out a laugh, twirling on his heel.

“You did it, Glass. You won! All those years of following us around and being a total fucking stalker actually paid off! Kinda pathetic, right? You may be the first person on earth desperate enough to actually buy friendship! What next, huh? Are you going to pay us to compliment ya?”

Behind him, Jasper burst out laughing.

Annalise was giggling too, shoving him. “Shh! Stop being an asshole!”

She hit him. “Jasper. Stop it! Oh my god, you’re such a bully!”

“I’m a bully?” Jasper snorted. “Dude, Jack ain’t holding back!”

The memory is vague after that. Mostly because I suppressed it. I didn’t want to remember the last time I saw them. The last time I saw him, Because if anyone saw what I did, I would have surely been a suspect. I  remember my bag slipping from my shoulder and hitting the ground. 

But I paid no mind. I was taking steps forward, trembling. I couldn’t breathe, and all I could think about was making him hurt—like he’d made me hurt. 

One step—and then two. “Jack.” I spoke through gritted teeth. My hand was already grasping his shoulder and forcing him to look at me. I didn’t see my fist swing forward. All I saw was a blur of red, my blood boiling, my stomach jumping into my throat. Impact hurt my knuckles, but I’d managed to knock him off guard. His head snapped back, and he made an “oof!” noise. It wasn’t enough force to knock him to the ground, but when he lifted his head, his lips pulled back into a silent cry, just glimpsing a blooming bruise under his left eye was enough.

“Ow.” Jack surprised me with a choked laugh, and behind him, Annalise and Jasper were staring in awe. “Dude, that fucking hurt!”

It was me who was crying. Not him. Not them. I was standing, trembling, trying to get a hold of myself. While he was laughing, gingerly rubbing at his eye. 

It didn’t even faze him. I was a fucking joke to him. To all of them. It started like poison in my blood, a suffocating sensation beginning to rip me apart inside. They could make me hurt. They could make me cry and hate myself for wanting to be close to then—but when I tried to do the same back, it’s like they were impenetrable. I couldn’t hurt them.  “Damn, Glass! I didn’t know you had that in you!” Jack  bent down and scooped up my bag, throwing it at me. I caught it quickly, my heart in my throat. “We’ll see you tomorrow. Nice right hook, by the way!”

He walked away, laughing, throwing his arms around the other two,

And I stood there for way longer. I stood there while the sky turned inky black, and the first snow of the year began to fall.

Snowflakes danced in front of me, a flurry of white illuminated in orangeade light. I barely felt them grazing my cheeks.

My phone vibrated, and I pulled it out.

Dad.

“Elizabeth, you will have to walk home tonight. I have an important meeting with shareholders.”

Followed by another one: “Are those children giving you a hard time again? Sweetheart, we should talk.”

Instead of answering him, I turned off my phone, stuffed my frozen hands in my pockets, and started the long trek home.

Despite everything, I still went to the art room the next day—and I waited for them, fashioning conversations in my head.

“Hey, so about punching you in the face…”

“Annalise, I kind of like you. A lot. Your friends suck, but maybe we could hang out? I mean, you suck too. But I can’t stop… I can’t stop thinking about you…”

But I never got to speak to them. Neither up them turned up, which was odd. I waited until the end of lunch. Usually, they at least turned up to laugh at me. But there was no sign of them. I can’t say I was surprised they had stood me up again. But then I heard they hadn’t even come to school. Which again, sent alarm bells ringing in my head. 

They had perfect attendance. The three had not been seen since the night before. Since around 4pm.

Right before I punched Jack Locke in the face.

I never saw them again. Officially, they had moved away with their parents. 

Unofficially? Annalise, Jack and Jasper were missing in a town which didn’t care about its kids. It wasn’t the first time a teenager had disappeared, and my town treated their disappearance like they did every other. A statement was made. The three had left town with their parent’s permission. I actually visited Jack’s parents’ house, three weeks after he’d gone missing. The lights were off, and the car was gone. I waited for them to come back. Hours. I stood there for hours waiting for Mr and Mrs Locke to pull into the driveway. But there was nothing. Like their son, they too had dropped off the face of the earth.

Blinking myself back into the present, I realised I was staring at the link I’d opened, my hand quaking on the mouse. Outside, it was pouring, and I found myself glancing at the sliding glass doors leading out onto my patio. It was pitch black, but if I let my imagination run wild, I could imagine a figure standing there. Shaking my head, I turned back to my laptop screen. The page was simple. Just a search bar. According to the email, I just had to type the name of a person. It was stupid, right? Just a scam.

That is what I thought as I slowly typed in his name. It felt strange typing it, thinking it, even saying it out loud. Jack Locke. My stomach was trying to catapult itself into my throat when I slammed the enter key. 

I got one result. It was just like using Amazon. There was a product name, and a description. I don’t know why I expected his face to come up, but instead I got the usual default picture when an image wasn’t available. For a moment, I just stared at the result, hovering my mouse over the default image. 

Part of me wondered if any new images existed of the three.  I had spent 8 years thinking Jack was dead, and if this thing was real, had it documented photos of him past 2015? Was he really still alive? I felt hope prick into me, relief flooding me like ice cold water. But as quickly as that hope came, it was replaced by despair slamming into me. I felt it like a noose around my neck, tightening,  when my gaze found his status. It was staring at me in large capitalised red letters, but I refused to take it in. In refused to register what I was seeing.

Name of product: Jack Locke.

Age (When lost): 18.  

Status: Lost.

Refurbishment available? YES.

I knew what lost meant—and I found it hard to take in. After so long, I had finally gotten my answer.

They were dead.

I didn’t know how they were dead, or why. But they were dead.

Knowing that information, I should have clicked off. I should have never gone further.

Except I was human. You would too. I know you would. If you had the chance to bring that loved one back, you would in a heartbeat.

Besides, I had unfinished business with them. The three of them still owed me lunch.

There was a giant yellow BUY button next to the description. They said it was refurbishment, an innovative rebuild of a memory I refused to let go. I didn’t understand how it worked or what it was, but with the option in front of me, with the option to bring him and the others back in a way I could have never imagined—of course I clicked buy. 

Leaning back in my chair, I felt like I was going to throw up when I got a confirmation notification via email, followed by a prompt to buy Annalise and Jasper too. Their statuses were the same. 

Name of product: Annalise Duval.

Age: (When lost): 19.

Status: Lost.

Refurbishment available; YES.

-

Name of product: Jasper O’ Brien.

Age: (When lost): 18.

Status: Lost.

Refurbishment available: YES.

-

I wonder if a “found” status existed. Was it possible to find a loved one who was still alive?

I got 3 confirmation emails after:

“Your order with Amazon Bring Back is on its way! Orders [SER17678765, SER90876765 and SER8987656 will be with you very soon.”

It turned out “very soon” meant the following day. 

I had Prime, after all.

I had just returned from work the next day, when my laptop pinged with an email telling me my orders were ready for delivery. I started to wonder what exactly this service was. What did they do? 

Did they deepfake loved ones faces onto lifelike robots? That seemed way too sci-fi for me, but it was Amazon. And they had spoken of innovative technology. It was 2021 and the world was already slowly starting to rely on technology and AI. 

Robots would not surprise me. I had just ordered Uber Eats for dinner when my phone vibrated.

I ignored it. It was most likely dad, and I really couldn’t be bothered with attending whatever party he was holding. Something about a new project he was working on. Dad worked for a company which rhymes with Shmoogle, and he was in charge of creating algorithms to act exactly like the human mind. His new project was being funded by billionaires, and I’d already told him multiple times I didn’t want to meander with the elite and pretend I was one of them. Pulling my phone out, though, it wasn’t dad. It wasn’t even a text. An unknown number had flashed up onto the screen.

After hesitating, I answered it.

“Hello?”

The line was staticky, a whistling sound shrieking in my ear before a hiss startled me. It sounded like the speaker was in a car. I could hear the low mumble of voices around him. The guy was aussie, and his voice didn’t make sense to me at first.

It sounded strangely robotic—like a mix of both human and machine. He was maybe a few years younger than me. 

Early twenties. College age. 

“Did you use Amazon Bring Back?” He demanded, and before I could reply, he cut me off again, hissing out. “Look, we’ve just spent nearly two fucking hours tracking him from the college to the factory. His serial number is registering under your address which means you’ve just purchased a Friend."

“You’ve… you’ve got the wrong number.” I said shakily.

Before I could hang up, I was being deafened by static. “Listen to me,” He said. “Cole bought us, and then they took him, alright? We have no idea what is going on,  but wherever he is, is the key to our memories. And I know…I know I’m not making sense right now. I just properly woke up. I’ve been out of it for so long, and I don’t even fucking know who I am any more. All we know is Cole. So, if you could just listen to us—"

Gripping my phone tighter, I cut him off. " "Who is this?”

He surprised me with a laugh. “Yeah, I’d like to know that too. Did you buy a Friend or not?”

“A Friend?”

Suddenly, I was very aware that I was living alone, and the sliding glass doors leading into my yard were just that. Glass.

“Model.” He said. “Sorry, I mean model. I keep forgetting they changed the name. Did you use them? Amazon Bring Back? We’re registering two faults, and one stable. The stable one is showing under your name, so you need to be honest with me, alright? Have you used it or not?”

Something ice cold slithered down my spine.

“Yes.” I said in a breath. “Yes, I have, but—”

“You need to tell us where you are,” he said. “Right now. We can’t get a full reading of your location and the system is blocking us out.”

I opened my mouth to reply when the phone went dead—and there were three sudden rhythmic knocks on my door. I started towards it, realising as I was getting closer, that a figure was bleeding into the dark. My thoughts spiralled. 

It was the caller, it must be. He was tracking down my address. I grabbed my phone, my heart in my throat. I was ready to call 911 before the outside light switched on, bathing the night in warm light and carving the figure out of the dark. I knew I’d dropped my phone when I heard it hit the wooden floor. 

My breath was stuck in my throat. I was walking slowly, and then my footsteps were quickening. 

I was gripping the steel handle when my mind screamed at me to stop. To think about what I was doing. Except my brain wasn’t in control. It was all of my heart, everything I had been in the last eight years which had come apart, sliding back together again. Yanking open the door, I was hit in the face with icy cold air. Almost like he had brought that night with him. Jack Locke was standing in front of me. 

It wasn’t a robot, or a deepfake or someone’s attempt at replicating him. I was looking at the exact face I had seen that night in the snow. His bright red jacket hung off a wiry frame, dark brown hair damp against freckled skin, and that same scowl carved into his lips. It was almost as if he had stepped right out of the year 2015. Straight from that night. Breathless, I couldn’t stop myself. I was standing on my tiptoes, leaning forward and grazing my fingers over the blooming yellow bruise on his right eye.

The bruise was fresh. Just after I’d punched him.

He looked exactly the same. And I couldn’t understand how that was possible—how they had replicated not just a memory, but a whole person. Emotions and feelings and expressions. If I concentrated, I could smell the aroma of coffee on his breath. I could see the annoyance sparking in his eyes from the school day, and the amusement of cornering me as usual. 

Jack didn’t react to my touch at first. But when I was pulling back, his eyes widened, and he backed away with a scoff. He was soaking wet, standing under a shower, and I finally found my voice.

“Oh my god… you’re…” I couldn’t say it. If I said it, I’d admit that what I was seeing was actually fucking real.

Instead of speaking, I grabbed him, wrapping my arms around him. He felt real.

Warm.

“Wet!” Jack finished for me, struggling in my arms. “Also, you’re hurting me! Jeez, when did you get all huggy?”

I couldn’t stop prodding his eye. “But… that’s where I punched you.” I was speaking in hysterical gasps.

He didn’t look impressed, side stepping away from me. “Can you stop that? I’m drowning out here. Are you letting me in or not?”

After staring at him in disbelief, I nodded, pulling open the glass sliding door and ushering him in. Jack wandered in, pulling off his jacket. The exact same white shirt from that day, the jeans he’d spilled paint on during art class. Before he could head into my living room, I stopped him.

“Jack.” I said shakily. “Do you remember me?”

He raised a brow. “Is that a trick question?”

Before I could reply, he was striding past me, his expression lighting up. “Holy shit, is this your parents place? You’re rich! Like, super fucking rich!”

“Jack,” I was already starting to get pissed with him, but it felt familiar. It felt.. comforting. Still though, he was driving me crazy, and he hadn’t even been back five minutes, The guy was already in the refrigerator grabbing the cake mom had brought me and stuffing slices in his mouth.

“Want some?” He was already carving into it with his fingers, regardless of my answer.

“Do robots even eat?” I found myself hissing out.

Jack frowned, almost choking on a mouthful he’d managed to get all over his jacket. “What was that?”

“Never mind.” I shook my head. “No, I don’t… I don’t want cake.”

“Your loss.” He said, swallowing a piece whole. “Oh my god, this is orgasmic. You’re missing out,” He said through a mouthful.

“What year is it?” I leaned against the countertop, observing him somehow swallowing a whole cake, and washing it down with Coke.

Jack burped loudly, his gaze catching mine. “You’re joking, right?”

“I’m deadly serious.” I said. “Tell me. What year is it?”

Jack rolled his eyes. “It’s 2015.  And yes, we’re on Earth. Or at least I am.” He gestured to me with his can. “I always knew you’d lose it at some point. You kinda have that vibe, you know? You’re all…” He pulled a face. “Weird. And a little pathetic. You’re like the resident crazy cat lady.”

Weirdly enough, his words didn’t sting anymore. I’d grown up way past sticks and stones. If anything, he sounded childish.

But more importantly…

Jack was stuck in time.

Something prickled up my spine, twisting in my gut. The Jack I was talking to was the exact replica ripped from eight years ago.

Jack was halfway through the food in my refrigerator when I glimpsed… something. At first, I thought it was a trick of the light. I thought it was an earring. Slowly, I made my way over to him. There was something stuck to his ear. It reminded me of a Bluetooth device, but far more advanced. 

This thing snaked around his ear, a silver ear-piece glowing an electric blue. Looking closer, it looked like it was permanently stuck there. There was no way to pull it off. I stepped back, a shiver creeping its way down my spine. It must have been a registration tag, something which connected him to Amazon Bring Back. But it was still freaking me out. I had seen so many TV shows and movies where humanity and metal had come far too close, and was I was staring at was eerily similar. Jack caught my gaze, his eyes narrowing. “Why are you looking at me like that?” 

He sighed, finishing off the bag of chips he’d been snacking on, “I know you’re obsessed with us, but you’re freaking me out.”

I shook my head, ignoring his protests and prodding the device. It was..humming. Warm. Like it was alive.

Retracting my hand, I swallowed hard. “This… this thing on your ear,” I said in a breath. “What is it?”

Jack cocked his head. “What?” His hand grazed his right ear, and then his left. He skimmed right past the device. “Nothing I know of. Why?”

I don’t know what possessed me to reach forward and try and yank the device from his ear. I could feel myself mentally figuring out an angle, s way to pull it off without hurting him, when something slammed into the glass sliding door. I saw it in a blur of streaking red dripping from glass. A lump of something… black. Furry. 

I couldn’t move for a moment, paralysed, watching that black, furry thing being slammed into the glass over and over again—until it registered in my head that it was a cat’s head. My neighbour’s cat. 

A scream clawed at my throat, and no matter how much I tried to move myself, to force myself to move. To fucking move! I couldn’t. Because the neighbour’s cat was clenched in  familiar hands. I glimpsed dark red pigtails and made up eyes, the exact same dress and sherpa jacket she had been wearing that day. But they didn’t look right splattered in blood. Her eyes were too wide and yet had no light, no life. Blossom red lips stretched into a maniacal grin.

When I could move, and I was stumbling over to the door, trying to ignore gory chunks of red spattered all over my door, Annalise Duval slammed he cat’s severed head against the door once again. When I opened the door, she greeted me with a wide grin. 

"Where’s your daddy?”

The two of them were sitting cross legged on my patio. Annalise and Jasper. Covered in… in cat. Jasper’s hands were slick scarlet, and he was wiping at his face, smearing intense red like war-paint. Like Jack and Annalise, he was an exact copy of that memory. But just like Annalise, he looked… wrong. Like her, he was pressing his hands on the doors, making bloody handprints, mimicking Annalise’s scratchy voice. “Where’s your daddy?” His eyes weren’t quite on me. They penetrated me, looking straight into thin air. “Where’s your daddy, huh? Where’s daddy?”

I dropped to my knees, my stomach heaving. My gaze was on what was left of my neighbour’s cat. They had ripped it apart—dismembered it.

While I was trying to find my breath, trying to hold in a scream, I glimpsed something else glowing deep, dark red, on Jasper, and Annalise’s ear. That same device. Jack was behind me. I could sense him coming closer and kneeling in front of his friends. His expression had changed. It was more stoic.

 He reached out, poking the devices on their ears which were glowing red. “They’re like me,” He murmured, his tone suddenly different. Robotic. 

“It looks like their tag has been messed up. It’s still active, but it’s scrambled their brain which has caused them to act out.”

Somehow, I managed to find words. “What are they?” I demanded. “How… how do you know this?”

I crawled away from Jasper when he lunged forwards giggling hysterically, trying to wipe his bloody hands all over me.

Jack shrugged. “I don’t. I am the AI built into this model containing the last available data of Jack Locke. This includes memories, emotions and feelings. I am that left over data trapped in time.” He shot me a look. “I am still Jack Locke, but what we call a fault protocol. I am triggered if I detect any faults within the model, or the brain melded to it. In this case, the fault appears to be within these other models. If you look at their tags, they are red. Which indicates something is wrong with the programming.”  Jack turned to me. “Do you want me to report it?”

I jumped to my feet. “No.” I hissed out. “No, don’t report it! Just… just let me think, okay?”

Annalise copied me, diving to her feet. She had stringy pieces of cat clenched between her fists. “Where’s your daddy?” Her eyes were cartoonishly wide. Stepping closer to me, the girl’s laugh got progressively more maniacal. “Where’s your daddy? Where’s your daddy?”

Tyring to ignore it, I focused on Jack. “Why do they keep saying that?!”

He didn’t respond for a moment, his gaze on the two of them. He seemed to be studying them. Not like a human. Like a robot. He was assessing the situation, trying to find a resolution. Finally, Jack turned to me, his expression crumpling. I caught pieces of the memory bleeding back to fruition. Confusion, and flickers of pain he was trying to hide. “Your dad…” He said it like an accusation. “Your father invited us to his house that night… the night I…” He trailed off, shaking his head. “That’s the last thing I remember. Or at least what this last remaining data remembers. Jack Locke’s memories came to a stop on November 11th 2015. Exactly fifteen minutes after entering Elizabeth Glass’s house.”

No.

No, I wouldn’t believe that.

So, I pushed his words deep, deep down.

The next hour went by in a blur. Between Jack and I, we cleaned up the neighbour’s cat, and tied up Annalise and Jasper inside.

When I slammed the sliding glass door on them singing songs, and screaming “Where’s your daddy?” I was shaking.

We were on our way to my dad’s house. He had a showcase thing anyway, and I was determined to prove he had nothing to do with their disappearance. I dialled an Uber quickly before texting dad I was on my way. “Okay, so Jack AI, or whatever the hell you are. What are they?”

He shrugged. Since the AI had been triggered inside of him, he was like a different person.

“Empty shells. Something went wrong during the transfer. Imagine shoving a brain into an empty husk. That’s what they are right now.”

“But you’re not.”

“Because my tag didn’t malfunction.”

“Then we take the tags off.” I said. “You’re just… robot’s, right? You’re synthetic.”

Even as I said that, I was in denial. The tags on their ears, as well as that mysterious phone call, told me otherwise.

Jack’s eyes darkened. “Not yet.” He said. “Pulling off their programming tags would be very, very bad.”

“What? They killed a cat!”

“Trust me. We can’t restore their minds when we don’t know where they are. If there’s a fault, it could either be internal or external. External is a manufacturing fault. While internal… appears to be a fault due to the model’s reacting to the original’s data. If the originals have experienced any kind of trauma or pain, this can sometimes control the AI. It’s rare when it happens, but if the data is strong enough, it can send them…” He trailed off. “Well, we’ve seen it. If the originals memories/data is too much for the program, it will become overwhelmed.”

His eyes found mine. “Keep me under observation."

“What?”

He pointed to his tag. “Jack Locke became lost around the same time as Annalise Duval and Jasper O’ Brien. It is very likely what affected them will affect me too. Like I said, if the original’s data begins to affect me negatively, I want you to pull my tag off. Even if I don’t want you to.”

I swallowed. “Even if you don’t want me to?”

“Yes. I may revert back to Jack Locke’s surviving data. Which will most likely be the trauma of how he became… lost.”

I was still thinking about his words when we dived into the back of an Uber. No matter how loud the Uber cranked up the radio, I could still hear them.

Annalise and Jasper.
