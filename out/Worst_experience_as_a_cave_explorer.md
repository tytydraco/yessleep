I downloaded Reddit just to talk about what happened, I have no idea how to explain it to my or his family. 

I am a cave explorer and a couple weeks ago some friends and I decided to explore a cave. 
This cave, which I will not share the location, use to be a military base for experiment decades ago and was abandoned very quickly with everything still in it. 
A bunch of urban tails were told, and me and my friends grew up with them and always wanted to go in. 

Anyway, 3 weeks ago we went in, with all the equipment necessary. 

The cave starts with a metal door in the mountain with an old “do not trespass, military base” sign on it. We forced the door and got in. 

The cave quickly dropped for about 120m of man made stairs. We went down, it took us a while. 
Once down we could see a huge hallway going for dozens of meters. 

Approximately every 5meters was an other gallery going in each direction for god knows how long. 

Once we walk through the big gallery it took us to a huge room, with all kind of scientific equipment all over the floor, and the tables place there.  

We didn’t payed a lot of attention to it as none of us could barely understand the science behind what was happening. 

The next few hours were just exploring the cave. 

After 2 hours of walking we came across a huge 20m deep canyon in the ground. We had to walk on a very thin edge to get across it. That’s when IT happened 

One of my friend, Zac, slipped and fell. We saw his body hit the ground 20m bellow us and blood spreading to the floor. 

We immediately rushed to the exit and called 911. They came very quickly, like 10 minutes later, which I thought was quite strange due the remote place of the cave. 

We went to show them the hole and body.  But it was gone, nothing was left, not Zac, not his blood, nothing it was like no one was ever here. 

At first I thought he was still alive somewhere in the cave. But it was not possible I saw his scull crash on the floor.  

We were escorted home. 

Last week I went back alone, it was late at night and I wondered in the cave for about 2 hours. I started reading the documents 

They were talking about time experiment, nuclear weapons and something refers as “subject 176”. At precisely 1:37am I heard someone shout my name from across the first hall. 

I thought it was Zac, still alaise and run toward it. 
I fell in a hole and knocked myself out for exactly one hour. 

I wake up and Zac was here, but it wasn’t really him, it was his face body and voice but I could tell it wasn’t him. 
He started to train got me like he would’ve done but something was off. 
I could barely see anything, but they were a beam of light coming from a hallway at my left, the light felt warm and calm. 

Zac grabbed my hand a tried to take me there. But I suddenly remembered a bit a saw. 
“ if subject 176 tries to take you the the beam do not follow and run the opposite way”   

I started running without knowing where I was going and I could here him scream my name and starting to run in my direction.  

He was insanely fast and running on all four. 
I don’t k so how but I got out of the cave by an other exit. He stopped at the edge and said really calmly “see you soon, I know you’ll be back” 

I run again and got back home. My mom was surprise to see me and I learned that I went missing for 4 days, even though I’m convinced only a few hours passed. 

It’s been a week now and from what I can figure subject 176 is a shape shifter trying to lure you to the light. I know it don’t make any sens 

But I don’t know why I need to go back there and found out the truth about all this
