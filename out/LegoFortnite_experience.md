I was in my world doing the normal sweep of certain material when I noticed a new player icon. I checked to see if my party was opened, it was not. I started to follow the icon to find this player that had joined my world. But as I kept moving toward it, it kept moving away. I opened my chat to try and talk but nothing was heard. I then noticed a text chat on my screen.

RandomUser169: “Your eyes are open and I am there. Close them. I’m there too. What am I?”

At this point I was thinking this was one of my friends playing a prank or something. I kept on to try and find RandomUser169. The icon was moving at a very high speed over the ocean so I assumed it was moving by boat. I quickly went back to base to gather the material to make a boat and checked my map. I was horrified when I saw that the icon was right outside my house. I had no windows in this particular part of my house (basement) so I could not see outside. I had to go back up there and look for myself….. I checked the map again and there was a glitch on it. A cubed dark patch where the icon was supposed to be. I peered above the stairs and crouched through the house to the nearest window praying this was a joke. It was night time but this was different. I couldn’t see anything. I checked my map again to see that it was all pitch black. I opened my door… There was NOTHING. No stars, no clouds, no village.
I started to FREAK the hell out and just as I started to, I saw another text chat on the screen.

RandomUser169: “The dark”

I was MORTIFIED by this point so I quickly turned off my console. I was legitimately having the worst anxiety attack ever. I called the friend I thought it was, knowing that noone was capable of doing any of these things in Lego. And like I knew would happen, he denied every bit of it. I was scared af but I said screw it. I turned the game back on and got back to the world I was in. My screen was black as soon as I loaded into Fortnite. A text chat appeared.

RandomUser169: “Where do skeletons walk their dogs?”

I then loaded straight into Lego. It was daytime. Everything felt normal and I was relieved. Except for the fact that my inventory was filled with bones. Each slot individually had max bones. I emptied them but they kept going back into my inventory. I checked my chests………Bones. Max bones in every slot. All of my hard work was gone. Everything. Kind of like the glitches that were making people’s houses crumble. GONE. Then it happened again.

RandomUser169: “The boneyard”.

After seeing this I was reluctant but I did it anyways. I walked outside. The fear that was running through my body put me in tears. The ground was nothing but bones. The mountains and the sky melted with…bones. I checked the map and as I was doing it-

RandomUser169: “Look”.

I did NOT want to turn off the map… The icon was dead center in front of me and I had no control whatsoever of my world anymore. So I did it. I looked. As soon as I saw it, it was burned into my memory forever. A slender and tall dark figure was standing in front of me. It was so hard to get past its vast holes that were eyes. They felt as if you stared into them long enough you will get sucked into them. Its body looked like it was entwined with thousands of burned vines. Vines the crawled over every crevice continuously. It felt…Alive. All of my villagers were behind it looking at it with a smile. I tried to move my character but it wouldn’t budge. Meowscles approached my character and sent the most chilling electricity down my spine.

Meowscles: “You’re certain to be wearing your best outfit or something special when you come to stay”.

I said aloud into my controller. What does that mean?

Meowscles: “The answer is! A coffin!”

My screen went black for almost 2 minutes. I sat there shaking in horror. Waiting for something bad to happen.

Game: (Error code 607: There was a connection issue)

I was on the main screen of Lego. My world was gone. I immediately took my system to my sister’s house and gave it to her. I even bought a new tv. I will NEVER play a game again! Not a single one. EVER!
