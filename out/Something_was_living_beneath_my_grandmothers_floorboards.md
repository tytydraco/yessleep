I’ve gone back and forth on whether I should post this. I’m not one for paranormal stuff. I’ve always been the “it’s just the wind” kind of guy. But after what happened last summer, I haven’t been the same. I figure if anyone would understand—or at least take me seriously—it’d be the people here.

So, for context, I’m second-gen Japanese-American. Most of my extended family is still in Japan. Last May, my grandmother passed away. She lived in a very rural part of Aomori, in an old wooden house just outside Hirosaki. When no one else could make the trip to take care of the estate, I agreed to go.

I hadn’t seen her since I was a kid. The house hadn’t changed at all—same paper sliding doors, same narrow corridors, same musty tatami mats. It felt like stepping back in time. It was small, dark, and strangely cold, even in June. Everything creaked. I chalked it up to age, but there was a heaviness in that place I didn’t remember from childhood. It wasn’t welcoming.

I was supposed to be there for a week, just to sort things out, clean up, and coordinate with the real estate agent. I stayed alone. No one lives nearby. There’s a forest behind the house and nothing but silence at night.

Things were fine for the first few days. Boring, even. I swept, boxed up old dishes and photos, checked drawers for paperwork. Then I found a trapdoor.

It was in one of the smaller rooms I hadn’t gotten to yet. The corner of the tatami felt slightly off when I stepped on it—squishy, almost. When I rolled it back, I saw a wooden panel that didn’t match the rest of the floor. It had no handle, just a small notch.

I pried it up with a screwdriver.

Beneath it was a hole. Not a basement or storage space—just a pit. Maybe six feet across, with dirt walls that had been scratched raw in some places. No ladder, no lining. Just a drop into darkness. I leaned over with my phone flashlight, but the light didn’t catch anything but loose soil and what looked like old drag marks. That was enough for me. I closed it and moved on.

That night, I heard scratching.

It started around midnight. Light at first—faint scrapes, like mice in the walls. But it wasn’t coming from the walls. It was coming from beneath the floor.

I tried to ignore it. Old house, weird noises. But the next night, it got worse. The scratching was louder, slower. Like nails dragging across wood. And then I heard something that didn’t make sense—a giggle. Just one. High-pitched, breathy. Like a kid playing a prank.

I didn’t sleep.

I decided to leave the house the next day to clear my head in town. I thought I was just getting stir-crazy. But when I came back that evening, the trapdoor was open. I hadn’t touched it since I closed it. Nothing had been disturbed around it. But the panel was lifted just slightly, propped open like someone had started to come out.

I sealed it with duct tape and stacked boxes on top. I didn’t know what else to do.

The next morning, I found a bowl of rice I had left out on the kitchen table placed neatly beside the trapdoor. I hadn’t put it there.

That’s when I found the photos.

They were in a small wooden box in the bedroom closet. Most were old family pictures—faded, yellowed. But one stood out. It showed a little girl standing in the yard outside the house. Her face was blurred. Not motion blur—just blurred, like someone had smeared her out of the photo. Her arms hung straight down, and her posture was weird—shoulders too low, legs turned inward.

Tucked behind the photo was a note in my grandmother’s handwriting. It said, “If you find her, do not speak to her. She listens. She waits.”

I don’t know what she meant. I still don’t.

That night, I heard a voice.

Just after 2 a.m., I woke up to the sound of someone whispering my name. Not shouting—just calmly saying it. It sounded like a child. Maybe eight or nine years old. Soft, like she was standing just outside the room.

I didn’t move. I kept my eyes closed and pulled the covers over my head like I was five years old again. The whispering stopped after a few minutes, but I could still hear something moving. Not walking—crawling. Hands against the wood. Slow and deliberate.

In the morning, the trapdoor was open again.

I taped it shut with more layers, nailed down a board from the shed, and pushed a shelf over it. I left the house that afternoon and stayed in a hotel for the rest of the trip. I didn’t tell the real estate agent what happened. I didn’t tell anyone.

The day after I went back to gather my stuff. I arrived early—around 7 a.m. I didn’t want to be there when the sun started going down. I loaded everything up fast. I didn’t even go into that small room.

But as I got into the car and started backing out of the driveway, something told me to look back.

I don’t know why. I wish I hadn’t.

There was something in the window.

It wasn’t a little girl. It was tall, almost touching the ceiling. Standing behind the paper screen. But the face was wrong. No eyes. Just smooth, pale skin, stretched tight with deep, empty sockets where eyes should have been. She wasn’t moving. Just standing there, head tilted slightly, arms limp. Watching.

Or pretending to watch.

Then she smiled. It wasn’t a normal smile. It was too wide, too deliberate. The kind of smile someone makes when they’re trying to imitate what happiness looks like.

I hit the gas and didn’t stop until I was back in Hirosaki.

The house has been off the market ever since. No one will buy it. A neighbor told my cousin that people walking past at night sometimes hear knocking from inside—or see a little girl waving from the garden, even though the grass hasn’t been cut in over a year.

I don’t know what I saw. I don’t know if she followed me. But I haven’t slept through the night since. Sometimes I dream of her voice, whispering like she did that night.

And sometimes… it’s not a little girl’s voice anymore.
