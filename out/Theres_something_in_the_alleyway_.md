The reason I want to write this is actually for my English class. It’s winter break and we were tasked with the job of gathering family stories. Our teacher wanted us to gather tales of fun family memories, and show off our traditions and culture. He didn’t specify if they should be based upon Christmas, so I made the executive decision of collecting a scary story since my family had them in abundance. 

Let’s start with the person in my family who has the most encounters. I personally have never believed in people that say they can talk to the dead or even see them, I think most are phonies praying on the vulnerable who have lost loved ones and are desperate to see them one more time. But I believe every word that comes out of my cousin's mouth. Him and I have a large age gap, so he has always been there to give me a good scary story. His name is ironically Jesus, (hay-seus as it’s pronounced in Spanish)

He told me that his earliest memory of seeing things began in my grandparents house. Everyday after his father would pick him up from school, his mom would yell out the window as he walked through the courtyard, she’d yell in her shrill voice. 

“JESUS TAKE YOUR UNIFORM OFF AND PUT IT IN THE WASHER” he obviously obeyed and would strip off his clothes till he was left in his underwear, it was his only set of school clothes so he could never skimp out on loading them into the washer even if he had to sprint half naked into his house.

 Now let me take a moment to explain the house's layout. It's a pretty big place and all my grandparents' children lived there once. There was a small concrete house at the end of the property where my parents and I lived for a short while, and dividing it from the rest of the house was an alleyway maybe 10 ft wide, this is where the washer was connected. Facing the alleyway was my parents bedroom window and my aunt's kitchen, and connected to her house was my grandmothers. The courtyard was always brightly lit but since the alcove was tucked away between the houses, it was naturally always dark, the only flight that flooded in was my parents bedroom light. 

One day after coming home from school, the same routine followed. My aunt stuck her head through an open window while she was preparing lunch and yelled for him to load his clothes into the washer before turning her music back up and closing the window. He placed his school bag against their door and began to unbutton his shirt. He was six at the time so he was not very dexterous yet. It was slow progress taking off his uniform, but once he had his shirt off he walked towards the washer, preferring to take his pants off in a more private place. Unbuckling his belt, he placed it flat against the window sill, and just as he was shimming his pants down he paused, the skin on his back felt frozen and the foreign sense of dread began to fill the pit in his stomach. He felt it than, thin fingers spreading across his ankle and clamping down. 
 
Jesus says it was the first day he understood the meaning of fear. Turning back fast like the crack of a whip, he looked down at the dusty concrete floor and saw a man holding onto him. He only had a few seconds to understand what he was seeing, just a few inches down where the man’s belly button would be was empty, he was cut in half. Behind the torn man was a trail of blood that snaked towards Jesus, his heavy pink guts fell across the floor and flies seemed to swarm around the open wound that wiggled and squirmed. 

Jesus recalls that the other hand that wasn’t holding onto his ankle was tightly entangled in what seemed like Saran Wrap. And the face that looked up at him was bashed in on one side, its cranium obliterated, one protruding eye pink and the other leaking pus. 

My cousin fell back as the thing violently tugged, legs furiously kicking him off and lungs releasing all oxygen as he shrieked at the top of his lungs. Jesus began to fervently crawl back on his now shredded palms, legs shaking off the man’s desperate grasp as he kept reaching for him. Only gurgled groans escaped the figure's throat as it scraped its belly against the grainy hard concrete, its palm opening and closing, attaching itself to his foot once more. 
 
“Jesus, I heard you scream, are you okay?” He says my mom was like shining bright light at the moment, she let the screen door slam shut as she tumbled outside in a panic after hearing him yell. 

“THE MAN HE WON’T LET GO!” Jesus pointed down at his feet, turning his head to look back at the disfigured beast. Only a putrid stench was left in its place. “TIA I SWEAR!” He was much too overwhelmed at that moment, the edge of his eyes began to swell with tears, and they’d turn into body wracking sobs once my mom picked him into her arms. 

“what happened?!” His mom finally heard the commotion and came rushing out the door. 

“T-t-there was a man there, he grabbed my leg!” He pointed to the alleyway and both women turned white in shock. In the end my uncles, grandfather and dad were looking all around the property, shimming between the house and the fence, behind the garage and they even shone a light underneath the crawl space but no one could find a single trace of this mysterious man. 
 
Jesus hadn’t spoken much after that, he says he sat on our grandmother's kitchen table, eyes wide and fixated on nothing while he sucked on his capri sun. 

“Jesus come on, tell me more? What did he look like? What was his skin color? Did he look like one of our neighbors?” His mother tried persuading him to talk with another capri sun. He was much calmer now, shaken but finally willing to talk. 

“He didn’t have legs…mamma he was crawling on his hands.” Jesus admits that his brain hadn’t yet understood at that time that this thing was dead, a rotting corpse grasping for him. 

“Hmm you don’t think he’s lying…” my grandma whispered to my aunt. But my cousin furiously threw his capri sun onto the floor, a preview of his future demeanor. 

“I'M NOT LYING I'M TELLING THE TRUTH!” They all gasped and began to reprimand him for yelling at his grandmother.

“That’s it! You wouldn’t be so angry if you weren’t lying! You were probably lazy and didn’t want to put your clothes in the washer so you lied!” She scolded him. “Go back to the house! I want you in your room when I get back, no tv for you!” My aunt grabbed his raw hand and dragged him to the kitchen where the door that led to their house was. She pushed him in and slammed the door shut. Jesus whined and rubbed at his aching eyes, as he turned he came to the sudden realization half way that he was now in their kitchen; if he moved one more inch he would be faced with a view of the alleyway. His mouth became dry, his chest tightening. He squeezed his eyes shut but could imagine that thing with its mouth fully unhinged and hanging open, those glazed over eyes looking at him. Instead he clung onto the wall and shimmied his way to his room, knowing that if he turned and looked out, something would be waiting for him at the window. 

Jesus tells me that he has more stories, I know a few of them already but a fresh retelling is always good for the mind especially since I’m writing it down now, I can squeeze out a few more details. He also says that that house always felt heavy to him, but I never noticed that when I stayed there, and after that day he says it’s like they stacked a ton of bricks onto his chest and that feeling has never left him.
