Yesterday’s events have changed things to a point of disrepair. I don’t have much time for this draft, so let’s begin earlier—last afternoon, about eleven hours ago from when I’m writing this.

Saturday, 12:47pm.

My sister and I watch Yoel plug his laptop into the hotel room’s television. He sits beside the TV as it displays my house, which is split into different panels named: “Cam 1,” “Cam 2,” “Cam 3,” and “Cam 4”. The first view was of my living room, the second was of my bedroom, the third was of my kitchen, and the fourth was of my bathroom. My guest room was ignored since I didn’t use it anyway.

“Really? Cameras in his bathroom? That’s fucked up,” Cindy said.

Yoel snickered. “Remember, this isn’t really David we’re gonna watch. I need much info on this and its behavior. Its level of detail.”

My sister scoffed. “Creep.”

“Listen, you’re not even supposed to be here," Yoel said. "If you stay, then you must want to watch your brother’s ass; I’m doing it for study. The cameras will be removed when this is all over and David can safely go back home.”

I chuckled. 

If you’re unaware, I ended up doing exactly what Yoel requested in my previous post. Except, after telling my sister everything that was to go down, she forced me to tag her along. Cindy still had her doubts, and I couldn’t blame her.

She made sure to let me know this even before we made it to the hotel: *“You know this could all still be bullshit, right?”* Cindy said, as she steered the wheel of my car.

I had to let her drive on the way there because I couldn’t get over the perpetual feeling of wanting to puke.

*“Even after everything you saw when I showed you that recording?”* I said.

*“I heard my voice on that phone. And yeah, it really did look just like you. That was all freaky, I’m not gonna lie,” Cindy said. “It’s just so hard to believe, you know? Ghost and shit actually exist? All that paranormal stuff is real? Come on, David, what if this whole thing is a setup by this guy?”*

*“It’s real,”* I responded. *“Believe me, I had those same thoughts. But you didn’t spend night after night in my house. I could feel it, sis. I don’t know if it’s dark energy, or ‘supernatural intuition’ or whatever the fuck he called it. But this is all real.”*

*“I hope you’re right,”* Cindy said.

20-minute drive later, 15 stories up a hotel, and now we were watching a live recording of my house. Waiting for this thing to show up.

It wasn’t showing up, though.

I gulped. “It’s running late. It usually walks through the door by now. Well, from what I’ve seen anyway.”

“It’s taking its sweet time, but it’ll be there,” Yoel said. He locked his fingers together behind his head.

I bit my nails. “What if it knows what we're up to? What if the camera crew alarmed it or something?"

“That would be unfortunate. And awkward," Yoel said. "Don't overestimate this creature's ability or intelligence. In any case, it’s a would-be workday for you, right? It believes you’re at work, so I don’t see why it would break habit now of all times.”

As he finished his sentence, the sound of my door unlocking through the footage alerted us all.

Cindy gasped as she witnessed a live feed of the other 'me' walking into the house.

My Mimic carried grocery bags in both of its hands.

So that’s what it was doing. It was buying things to stock my fridge.

“He’s like your fucking roommate or something,” Cindy said.

I could see Yoel’s brows were tense. I wondered if he had ever heard of a Mimic exerting this level of behavior.

“Alright. It’s in my house, what now?” I asked.

“Hey. David. This elaborate setup ain’t for shits and giggles. Allow us a few hours of watching this thing,” he said.

“Seriously?” Cindy said, her foot tapped rapidly against the beige carpet.

“It’s alright,” I responded. “I figured you’d want that. You need as much record of this as possible, right? Might as well.”

Yoel snapped a finger and pointed. “You’re the man, David. Correct. It’ll be nice to add hours of modern evidence and study into the Mimic catalogue. All leading up to when we finally decide to interact with this thing using the radio. If I ever actually get to post this one day, that’ll be the cherry on top.”

We spent the next few hours watching the footage. Truth be told, it was kind of boring. Nothing changed, it still did the same things I would normally do. Pretend to read, watch TV, clean, eat junk food.

The three of us even began a game of “I Declare War” on the mattress.

Yoel was spading us into oblivion.

“Damn, how the hell are you good at this game?” I asked.

Yoel shrugged. “Meh. It’s all in the cards.”

Eventually, my other me laid down on the living room couch and we could tell it was beginning to doze off.

Yoel headed back to the seat by the television. “It’s not a good idea to let it sleep. Let’s get this thing started. Ready? In a moment, you’re gonna come over here to this little microphone, push the grey button on the side and start talking.”

“Wait, what does he even say to it?” Cindy said.

“I’m getting to that,” Yoel said. “All you have to do is convey how you feel. You want it to cease its copying of you, and strike for a halt on the stalking all together. Articulate that to the best of your ability, kay?”

“Sure, but what if it refuses,” I said.

“It won’t…probably. Most likely,” Yoel said.

“That’s real assuring,” Cindy said.

Yoel sighed. “All the sources indicate that this should work. To catch it red-handed is the best way to confront it. Listening to David’s plea, it’ll feel heartbroken to have caused him so much trouble. How it’ll react from there depends on two variables, both resulting in the stoppage of its mimicking.”

“All this for such a simple resolution? No way,” Cindy said.

“Wait, what two variables?” I asked.

Yoel cleared his throat and continued. “The Mimics are described as either being male or female. Whichever gender it is will determine its reaction. A female Mimic is known to be a lot more understanding. It’ll listen, and if confronted politely, it’ll abandon you all together, moving on to find a new lover. These types of Mimics actively seek hosts to copy and replace. Male Mimics are different. They tend to accidentally form an obsession with a human, but then won’t be able to easily let it go. It’ll care for you enough to not replace you after the confrontation, but likely, it’ll continue stalking you for the rest of your life. From the shadows.”

“That’s fucked. We can’t let that happen,” I said.

Yoel shook his head. “You’re gonna have to nut up, and veto Murphy’s Law for the time being. Either way, you live through both results. We’ll worry about the conditions later,” he said, then reached over into a drawer beside him. “I prepared a script for you, if you’d like. Though, I’d recommend authenticity.”

I waved my hand. “I got this.”

Yoel got up from where he sat to allow me to sit there.

I planted myself next to the microphone, aimed the mic towards me, and my finger inched towards the grey button.

Deep breaths. “What am I gonna say?” I thought. Figured the words will come as I go. He said to say how I felt. So that’s what I wanted to do. Figured, it was best to treat this thing as a person who is non-belligerent, who doesn’t mean any real harm.

I pressed the button.

“…Hey, ‘David’?” I said into the mic.

Heard a low grunt from Yoel behind me. I guess he didn’t expect me to address the thing by my own namesake.

My doppelganger made a slow rise from where it laid its head on the couch. It looked around, aimless.

“David…” I continued. “You hear me? It’s me. The person you’ve been copying. The real David.”

“What…?” The Mimic said, in a manner I would say it. An excellent impression. It sat up from the couch completely then stood.

Yoel snapped his fingers in rapid succession behind me.

I hastened to continue. “Hey, I know you’ve been infatuated with me as of late. I know what you truly are. And I get it. Sometimes you come across this once-in-a-lifetime thing, and something just clicks. And before you know it, you can’t imagine your life without it. Here’s the thing: I know you mean well, and I appreciate how you’ve held down the pad when I’m not around, but I can’t sleep at night knowing you’re there. Humans and folks like you just don’t mix well, y’know? And if this keeps up, I don’t think this relationship will end on a good note. So. . . if you could just move on—. . .if you could not do this ever again, that would be nice?”

The Mimic stood frozen for a long time, maybe a couple minutes. Like it was in some state of pure shock.

I look back at Cindy and Yoel. Their eyes were glued to the screen.

Then the Mimic spoke again, and my attention returned.

“…You expect me to just go away? After all I’ve done for you?” The Mimic spoke in a tone of voice I haven’t heard from myself since my father passed away. It then closed its eyes, like it was focusing.

“What the fuck. . .” Cindy whimpered out.

“Please?” I begged.

“Oh, David. . .” it said, standing completely still. “I don’t think you understand our relationship at all. I never wanted to replace you, sweetie.”

“What?” Yoel said. He was taken aback.

What did this mean? Never had I voiced my knowledge of it wanting to replace me.

My voice slightly raised, I replied. “The only thing I understand is that I don’t want you to be in my life anymore. You’ve been stalking me, watching me, living in my home without my consent. I want it to end. Surely you can understand that. If you don’t want to replace me, what do you want?”

I blinked, and in that fraction of a second, it was in front of the living room camera. A melting, corroded version of my face stared into the lens, as if peering at us through a window.

All three of us gasped and jumped out of our seats.

Cindy shrieked.

“Oh shit,” Yoel said. “David. . .”

He was at a loss for words, as I was.

“If this is some fucking elaborate prank for some Television show, Yoel, then this is a dandy time to bring out the cameras,” Cindy said. “This has gone too far.”

The Mimic’s impersonation of my face continued to melt off. It backed away from the camera as something seemed to be wrong with it. It held its face in pain, trying to hold together the flesh that was oozing off of it.

It spoke again but it wasn’t my voice anymore. It was a foreign cadence, scratchy. “It wasn’t supposed to be like this. You’re ruining everything.”

“Yoel? What’s going on? What’s happening?” I said.

He didn’t respond, instead went for his briefcase, and took out one of his books.

I stared back at the television. All of its skin formed a puddle of some kind of essence on the carpet. What's left was some kind of green creature with black hair extending passed its backside. It had a feminine frame about it. I guessed it was a female.

“. . . But I thought females were the safer ones?” I thought.

The Mimic, writhing, gaped its mouth. It screeched as its body contorted and cracked open.

The screech was powerful.

It’s not like it could only be heard through the setup, it was loud enough to be heard even from outside the hotel’s walls. Imagine the volume of a siren for an upcoming weather disaster. I was sure the entire city would have heard it. Yoel and I were brought to our knees, pushing palms to our ears.

Cindy, however, wasn’t reacting. She came to my side asking what the fuck was wrong with the both of us.

“Can you not hear that, sister? How can you move? It’s so loud, it’s terrible,” I said.

“My ears are gonna bleed,” Yoel said.

As the noise persisted, I looked back at the television. As this thing whaled, my house was going through a tornado. My couch, lamps, chandelier, TV, swirled around—the Mimic as an epicenter.

“My house. . .” I grunted out.

“Your house is being torn to shreds, David. This is insane, but where’s the thing? Where did it go?” Cindy asked.

“What do you mean? It’s right fuckin’ there. Yellin’ its ass off,” I said.

Cindy squinted; her eyes were aimless as she examined the screen. “I don’t understand.”

The noise ceased. Finally.

I only then noticed why it was in pain. There were things crawling out of its skin. The main Mimic itself was more humanoid, but these things were almost exactly what Yoel showed us in the book. Tens of them. It didn’t make sense, though. The proportions were off. How could so many of these things be crawling out of a body that couldn’t have possibly been holding them all?

Yoel flipped through his pages. “Oh dear. . . This can’t be happening.”

“What is it?” I asked.

Yoel turned to me, a grim look. “David, you unfortunate bastard. It’s a Mother Mimic.”

I shot up. “What does that mean?”

Before he had time to explain, I heard…god, I don’t even know how to describe it. The little creatures that came out of her made phlegm filled groans and chants.

The mother lifted her finger toward the camera. “Bring him,” it said.

All of the eyes in that room aimed their gazes at us. They rushed towards the lens and clawed at it.

Yoel grabbed his suitcase and dashed toward the door. He turned back. “Let’s go. We gotta go. Now.”

“Can someone explain to me what the hell is happening?” Cindy asked.

I grabbed my sister’s arm. “What about the footage—”

“Forget it,’ Yoel interrupted, “We’re gone.”

I heard a crack. Couldn’t believe it. One of those thing’s arms came through the Television. It was able to grab the edge of the drawer it was on top of, attempting to pull itself through.

That was all I needed to see. I tugged Cindy and we made a break for it.

“Head for the stairwell, obviously the elevator means death,” Yoel said as we entered the hallway.

We undoubtably caused a scene with whoever staff, maintenance, or guests that happen to be on the floor. I turned back and saw four of the little creatures exit the room. As Yoel burst open the stairwell door, I noticed the little monsters didn’t even bother with anyone else who was present in that area. It also didn’t seem like no one even noticed them, more concerned with the three of us running like mad men.

We raced down the stairs. Cindy didn’t seem to know what was going on, but she at least went with it enough to where I didn’t have to hold her arm. The monstrosities cackled as they chased us down the swirled path of stairs. Some attempted to jump down the middle in an attempt to land on us. One caught my arm, and I turned back to throw a jab at it to set myself free. Yoel had to give a hard kick to one that landed at his feet. Adrenaline coursed through me, chest burned, temples pulsing, I felt like I could’ve ran for days.

We made it to the lobby and slammed the stairway door behind us. Everyone there looked at us, baffled. Not wanting to halt another second as we heard the echoes of their scramble, we bumped into shoulders and jumped over luggage in order to get to the exit. Of course, the demons behind us continued their pursuit with no attention thrown their way by any other person.

There was a problem, though. The parking lot was underground, and I could tell by the look on Yoel’s face that Cindy & I’s ride weren’t the only ones that were down there. Even if we had gone to the garage level, there was no way we could’ve pulled out in time.

“Screw it, follow me,” Yoel said. Mid-run, he dug into his luggage and took out a pistol.

“What? Are you crazy?” Cindy said. I could tell she was moments away from collapsing.

Yoel jumps in front of a blue Volkswagen that was making a turn. He aimed his gun at the driver’s side and demanded him to get out the car.

“Are you kidding me? You’re out of your mind,” the man in the vehicle said.

“Shut up. Get out,” Yoel replied.

I saw the monsters approaching. There were dozens of them, some huger than I would’ve imagine. They were moments away from leaping at us.

“Get in,” Yoel said. He’d manage to get the guy out of the car. We jumped in with him.

“I’m so sorry,” I said to the stranger through the window.

One of the things jumped on the trunk but couldn’t get a grip and fell off as we sped away. Through the passenger seat mirror, I could see the man standing in disbelief next to the creatures. The damn things must of realized there was no way they were catching up.

It took us several minutes to catch our breath.

“You just stole someone’s car,” Cindy said from the backseat.

“What, this piece of shit? Trust me, he was begging for someone to take it off his hands,” Yoel said.

Cindy scoffed. “What is wrong with you? David, why did we just go along with that?”

“If you had any idea what we were running from, you wouldn’t complain,” I said, on the verge of throwing up.

“Precisely. In reality, Cindy didn’t have to tag along,” Yoel said. “It seems she couldn’t process that level of insanity. Just like all the others back there. She was safe the whole time. Cindy, what’s the last thing you remember seeing?”

Cindy put on her seatbelt. “The other David’s face covering the screen. Then it disappeared. Then shit started flying around in his house and you guys went nuts.”

Yoel nodded his head. “Cindy, you can be classified as a civilian. Ordinary people. Sometimes, though, ordinary people get wrapped up in the supernatural and no longer live normal lives. Sometimes, they channel enough energy to be able to perceive things they aren’t normally supposed to. That’s what has happened to David. All thanks to that Mimic contacting him.”

“So, what now? Is my life over?” I said, checking the rear-view mirror, waiting to see sirens pop up.

“Not necessarily, but I hope you saved a lot of money, because you need to get far away from here, David,” Yoel said.

“Why? What the fuck is a Mother Mimic? You only said there were two kinds,” I asked.

“I said male or female, I technically didn’t lie about that,” Yoel sighed. “Well, beside from the absolute mayhem it bestowed upon us, not much is known about them. Mimics themselves are vague legends, David. One of the few examples was from the 1600’s for goodness’ sake. My sources gave me brief mentions of the possibility of a mother's existence, but there was no credibility to it. No accounts to tell. The books themselves couldn’t verify anything. And from manuscripts that struggle to verify jack-shit to begin with, that says a lot. No point of bringing it up beforehand.”

“What makes it different from the other two variants?” Cindy asked.

“The only piece of detail about it said that it seeks to not replace its lover, but to make a father out of a male human,” Yoel said. “It’ll ritualistically impersonate David enough to obtain the power necessary to drag him into its main plain of existence. I have no idea what a father Mimic’s roll might serve, but Imagine existence in an abstract. You're unnable to comprehend anything you’re feeling or seeing. Forced to operate on a higher dimensional realm, enslaved by a higher power. A fate worse than death.”

I wanted to cry. “How far do I go? Another state? I mean, shit, man, it climbed out the TV. Before, you said it could follow me anywhere.”

“It’s complicated how these entities work," Yoel replied. "In order to take effect on the physical world, they can only use the mind and imagination of a person they’re connected to. It can follow you, but not anywhere. It was only able to do what it did back there because of your direct contact—by talking with you. We gave it enough connection, enough liberty. The farther the space between you and it, the less contact you’re giving it; therefore, the weaker its connection. Make sense? It won’t be able to find you.”

“. . .I have family in New Mexico. . .” I said.

“Perfect. I’ll pay for your ticket myself. I am sorry this happened, David. You can’t even pack because that would require you to go back home.”

“My aunt and uncle will take care of me,” I said.

“I’ll go with you, David,” Cindy said.

“You don’t need to,” I replied. “You have work.”

“I’ll call off. Just for a week or two, then I’ll fly back home, okay? I can’t let you go through this change by yourself.”

I reached into the backseat and gave Cindy a hug.

We drove nonstop for hours. By the late evening, we were able to score a rather expensive last-minute flight. It's set to take off in the early morning hours, Sunday. Yoel kept his word and paid for everything. We even had time to stop by a couple of retailers to give me a luggage filled with a decent supply of clothes and some shit to eat. I don’t have much else with me but a phone & charger I’m using to type this draft. It’s currently 6:38am as I’m writing this, next to my sister, waiting for the plane to arrive.

Guess I’ll crash at my aunt and uncle’s place until I can find out my next move. This is going to be a complicated change.

This will also be my last post on this matter. I don’t imagine anything else crazy happening as long as Yoel was right and I don’t stay in the proximity of that thing.

Thanks for all your supportive comments and be safe out there. Be on your guard. Most of you will never have to deal with anything like this, but for you unlucky few, know you’re not alone.

Signing off. Wish me luck.
