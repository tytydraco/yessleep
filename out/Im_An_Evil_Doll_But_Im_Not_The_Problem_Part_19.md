For anyone wanting to catch up on the ritual.

“The tall guy from Pete and Baz. God, that’s a coincidence.” Mike says, out of nowhere. 

We sit in the livingroom nervously waiting for Alex to get back. None of us feel good about the situation and all of us are showing it. 

“What are you talking about?” Leo asks. 

“Kaz. Who he’s reminding me of now that he’s looking more presentable. “ Mike clarifies. 

“Who the hell are ‘Pete and Baz’?” Sveta inquires. 

“Do none of you listen to music? “ Mike says, his attempts at conversation falling flat, “Don’t look at me like that, we’ve got to do something besides sit here and stew about how messed up it is we sent the kid into a meat grinder.”

“She’s strong.” Kaz volunteers. It’s still taking me time to get used to his voice coming from an elderly looking human body. 

“She’s also ten, missing an eye and starting to show symptoms of being exposed to too much void touched crap. 

What do we do if this doesn’t pan out?” Leo asks. 

“Let’s cross that bridge when we come to it. “ Sveta offers. 

Seems like the best course of action to me. I feel bad enough agreeing to let the kid risk her life. I’ll avoid feeling guilty about getting her killed till it happens. 

We don’t sit in silence, but our conversation is perfunctory at best. All of us have had time to realize how far this has gone. The brief period of relative peace has let us take a look at who we’re becoming and what the fallout of everything is. 

But Alex comes back, as I’m sure everyone who’s been keeping up has guessed already. 

After the first part of the ritual, she was banged up, shocked and scared as hell. This time though, she just seems, different. She doesn’t look physically hurt, but something that happened there has had a severe impact on the kid. 

She sits down in the livingroom, face tear stained and red eyed. 

“Did things go as planned?” Kaz asks. 

“I asked the question. “ Alex says, offering no more information. 

“Is everything okay?” I ask, using another in a long line of JP’s burner phones. 

“No.” Alex replies. 

I want to pry further, but as I start to type I see Mike subtly waving his hands in a ‘stop’ motion to me. 

We asked Alex to risk her life, maybe even her soul. We did it not knowing what she’d be going through, and we did it for nothing more than a chance, at a wisp of a plan.

What I’m saying is, whatever happened there, whatever torture we sent her to, if she doesn’t want to talk about it, we all know we have no right to ask. 

 For the first two days Alex doesn’t come out of the guest room. The shitty thing is that we’re so deep in what to do next we don’t notice till the second day. 

“So when do we get to watch the fireworks?” Mike asks.

Sveta is pouring over various tomes, Leo is either making or maintaining equipment, Kaz, Hyve , Mike, and myself sit around the kitchen table feeling like we’re doing nothing more than treading water. 

“I’m not sure, not even sure if this will be a coup de grace or a minor annoyance.” Kaz admits. 

“I’ve been able to make contact with some of my older acquaintances. No one willing to stick their neck out, but we’ll know if your plan worked. “ Hyve offers. 

“I’m sitting on a small army. The longer we fester here the more will get bored, or come to their senses. 

Anything we can do in the meantime?” Mike questions. 

“Should we really be poking the bear?” I ask. 

“That is a concern. 

What they did was costly, in specie and currency. I’ve no doubt the Bishop used mainly his own resources, but no one person would be able to fund something like that. 

There’s a good chance we’ve simply became more trouble than we’re worth. “ Hyve says. 

“Hands up everyone who can be killed with a brick.” Mike says, spitefully, raising his hand, “I’m not spending the rest of my life worrying about car bombs and things that go bump in the night. “

“We do have to be wary for our human companions. And the residents of this block for that matter. Banking on the Bishop’s lack of savings seems both risky and callous. “ Kaz agrees. 

“We’ve got mail. “ Alex says from the front door startling us all. 

From the outside the envelope looks normal. Nice but plain brown paper, with a simple plastic window giving the address and a name of “To whom it may concern.”. 

“It’d be the first time in 15 years.” Sveta says, waking into the kitchen, curious. 

She opens the letter, one eyebrow raising as she reads it once herself before reading it out loud. 

“To whom it may concern:

It has recently came into our knowledge that a member of our organization has engaged in an unauthorized use of force using our organization’s resources. 

We apologize for any inconvenience caused by this, and wish to send a representative to negotiate an end to any further hostilities. 

If you and yours are interested be at the following location in 7 days time. 

*address removed*

Regretfully yours. 

The Son.”

Alex and myself look confused as the rest of our unlucky group stands shocked. 

“Is it legit?” Leo asks as Kaz inspects the letter. 

“It’s their letterhead, and besides who else could it be?

The bishop would just attack if he was able, and if his organization was in support of him, we’d not be here discussing it. “ Kaz replies. 

“I don’t believe we’re in a position to be turning away any olive branches. “ Hyve adds. 

Alex and myself don’t have much to contribute to the conversation. Everyone else has lived this life for decades, if not hundreds of years. I can’t tell what it is, but something doesn’t sit right with me. Something about the situation seems too neat, too straightforward. But I can’t think of what it could be. 

Sometimes it’s easy to forget what I am. I still relate to someone like Alex much more than Kaz or Sveta. If I had a gun to my head, I’d say, on some level, maybe I’m holding out hope for a way out of this for myself. 

Is that so crazy? After everything I’ve seen, all the rules of the universe I’ve watched get broken, is the only thing that can’t happen a happy ending for me?

Probably. Tends to be the way the universe likes to do things. 


We expect Alex to demand to come along, but truth be told, there’s not much of a choice. If things are a trap, we can’t leave her alone. If not we can get her to some family once we have our assurances. Get her away from the effects of…us as soon as possible.

“So, why this place?” Mike asks, trying to pass the time on the day long road trip. 

“There are some locations that naturally are inclined to impeding observation, and limiting connection to the void. 

You have your famous ones, the Bermuda triangle comes to mind, but there are also thousands of other smaller places where the metaphysical walls are thick. Does well as neutral ground if one party is more, paranormally inclined than the other. “ Hyve explains. 

“Why not just send us a letter saying, ‘Our bad.’ And be done with it?” I ask. 

“It wouldn’t allow them to gauge our reactions, or our ability. It’s not wise to leave unknown pieces on the board when one plays games like this.” Kaz answers. 

“You seem to be traveling a bit light Mike. “ Leo says. 

I get what he means. No makeup, no getup, no weapons. 

“What the hell am I going to do if things go south? You’re looking at Captain Nobody of the good ship Who Cares. I’m here to make sure things get smoothed over and I can move on. “ Mike replies. 

Small talk and nerves make up the rest of our drive. I still can’t shake the feeling something’s wrong. But I trust that everyone else knows what they’re doing. 

 A few miles away we all feel it. Conversation goes silent, everyone besides Alex and Mike suddenly look carsick. 

The sign reads “Golden Sal’s Museum of Hollywood Curiosities.”. 

“Interesting choice.” Hyve remarks as we pull into the nearly empty parking lot. 

“How so?” I ask. 

“There’s esoterica, and then there’s *esoterica*. “ Sveta begins, “The things JP and I collected, they’re known quantities. Not safe, but safe in the right hands, and not earth changing in the wrong ones. 

A lot of ‘Dead Space’ is used to house objects that are more dangerous, or unpredictable. Every government is involved in their containment. “

“Seems like a tourist trap is a bit of a stupid cover. “ Mike adds as Leo shuts off the engine. 

“Not really. The Dead Space makes people forget, makes them want to move on. The objects themselves are mixed in with mundane items. The location is made to look disused and outdated. 

The odd person who stops by will see nothing stranger than 60 dollar tickets and z-list memorabilia.

Now if this was some kind of secure facility, then it would attract attention.” Kaz explains. 

We get half way through the litter strewn parking lot before Mike holds a hand out. 

“What is it?” Leo says impatiently. 

“Door’s open. Back door. Could mean someone snuck in. “ Mike says almost in a whisper. 

“Our contacts are the kind to make sure they are not being watched. They could have…neutralized those inside as a precaution. “ Hyve suggests. 

“Well, that makes me feel a lot better. 

We go in through the back. If the front door is unlocked, that’s where they expect us.” Mike instructs. 

“You sound paranoid.” Leo chides. The fact he doesn’t disagree speaks more than those three words. 

To say the inside is what you’d expect would be an understatement. Rows upon rows of glass cases and dioramas showcasing some of the most unimpressive junk from television and film I’ve ever seen. We’re talking a used bottle of Tang from “ Married with Children” levels of ‘Why Though?’.

Leo takes point as we enter, there’s no one waiting in ambush. 

We get about twenty feet into the building when there’s an unnatural noise from behind us. Like sheets of flint scraping against each other. 

The door we entered is not only shut, but gone. Desensitized to these kinds of things as our group is, we think nothing of it. 

“Greetings, we’re here at the request of The Son. “ Kaz yells as we walk from one genre themed room to the next. 

No response. 

That sense of missing something, of being blind to some obvious clue is nagging at me worse than ever. It started as a tiny spark of worry, but has now burned itself into a fear inducing panic. 

“Guys, haven’t we been in the Sci-Fi room before?” Alex asks. 

“No way we went in a circle, the place isnt that big. “ Leo says, looking around the room. A look of dismay on his face as he sees a familiar sign. 

“I don’t remember seeing the unused drink bottle from the Star Wars cantina last time. I swear it was a lot of Lost in Space and Dr. Who trash earlier. “ Mike adds investigating the room. 

We keep walking, but everyone is keeping a closer eye on things now. And as we go from room to room, tension begins to build. We’ve walked five minutes in any given direction. Which is to say much farther than should be possible. 

But even then, kind of par for the course for the kinds of places we frequent. It’s going to take a lot more than a bit of unnatural architecture to get our attention. 

“It takes a special kind of asshole to not only not show up, but not even give us the courtesy of trying to kill us. “ Mike laments as we walk through our fiftieth 90’s comedy themed room. 

“Be careful what you wish for.” Leo responds. 

Minutes turn into hours, we eventually sit down on some understuffed leather benches in a room themed after the evolution of the television. 

“I’m calling this a bust. Maybe they got spooked, or thought we were trying to spring something. You two have any idea how we get out of here?” Leo asks Hyve and Kaz. 

“With a few hours effort. This isn’t my first non-Euclidian  building. “ Hyve says confidently.

“Oh, I wouldn’t be too sure about that.” I hear a familiar voice say through the overhead speakers.  

Alex and I look to each other which makes sense. After all the voice belongs to the person who traumatized her and her family for weeks. 

Alex looks scared, her tormentor and our lies suddenly becoming a problem. 

I don’t get why Mike looks so enraged when he hears the voice, but then I remember the ghoul mentioned something about knowing him. I wish I had the context on that. 

“I didn’t pick this place from a hat. 

By now everyone in the know can wander their way through a warp in reality. Hell, I hear kids been doing it for a few years now, ‘No-Clipping’ or some such nonsense. 

You’ll get out, but it’s all a matter of when. The dead space is real good at making things less convenient, gumming up the works, slowing things down. 

You say hours? I’m thinking, weeks, if you’re lucky. “ William taunts. 

“Alex, is this the man from your house?” Mike says through gritted teeth. 

I see her blanche, her one eye goes wide. I try to step in, reply for her, I don’t like the look on Mike’s face. 

He looks to me, serious, deadpan. 

“You don’t want to do that. 

Alex, is this the guy?” Mike demands. 

She can’t bring herself to talk, she nods. 

“You described him like a special forces zombie Punch. Would it be more accurate to say undead cowboy?” Mike asks. 

It was one lie. One tiny bend of the truth I did for everyone's good.  It wasn’t for profit, or to make my life easier. I had no idea. 

I decide it’s time to tell the truth. I nod. 

“You said he was dead. “ Sveta adds, tears starting to form. 

“I didn’t want you killing yourself. This guy was one out of what, 5 dozen things there? He didn’t seem important. 

If I came back and said he ran off you’d have ran off after him. Either the bishop, the government or some hunters would have killed you by the end of the week.” I plead. 

“And that would have been my choice to make. Now I’m defenseless, at this bastard’s mercy.” Sveta growls, unfortunately I’m not being literal. 

“I told you things were personal lil fella. Didn’t take much to put out a few feelers find some information. 

See, y’all are real desperate, makes you do stupid things. Makes you take stupid risks. 

Could have killed you a few times over by now, but I don’t want to let you off that easy. You took my fingers, parde. And I mean that in every sense of the word. So you get something special. 

 In a week or two, the hunter, the kid, and my friend Mike there will be dead of starvation. Actually malnutrition would be a better way of saying it. Only so long you can survive on expired vending machine food. 

And you will have to watch. Starving is a horrible death, turns folks into animals. 

And Mike, my boy, been a long time since we crossed paths on The Big Rock Candy Mountain. How’s it you knew my voice? If you don’t mind me asking.” William’s words feel like the hearing the door of a cell close. 

“You’re half as smart as you think you are Mild-Bill. I’ve seen plenty of video of you talking since then. 

And what I said to you then still stands. “ Mike spits. 

“Bozo, you’re never even going to see my face again. You won’t die fighting killers, or monsters, you’re going to waste away for no other reason that having the wrong friends and pissing off the wrong cowpoke. “ William taunts, as the speakers cut out. 

We sit in silence. Our situation obvious and grim. Betrayal made in good faith sitting plain as a turkey on a thanksgiving table. 

Leo takes the first bite. 

“He’s trying to turn us against each other. We can’t let that happen. “ Leo says. 

“Lose a spouse and get back to me. “ Sveta replies. 

“You have a responsibility Sveta. Getting killed would effect more than just yourself and you know it.” Kaz points out. 

“She’s right to feel the way she does. “ Hyve begins, “This situation has made some of you myopic. 

I’ve risked my existence a half dozen times by now for your boondoggle. At no point has anyone offered to lift a finger in helping me find out Flapp’s fate. “

Lines are being drawn, I don’t like it. I wish there was something I could do to take things back. 

“That piece of shit murdered a friend of mine in front of me. He did it because the man wanted to save lives. And the way he did it was fucking awful. 

My friend, Rabbit, he wasn’t like us. He didn’t decide to go up against some monsters and lose. He was a blown out old hippie who came within a hair’s breadth of escaping a paranormal honeypot and had it ripped away from him. “ Mike takes in a large breath, looking at me for a moment before he continues, “Yeah, Punch fed us a line of bullshit, but none of us hasn’t fucked up along the way. 

Do we really want to tear each other apart because Punch’s fuck up was the most recent?

I say we blame Alex, can’t stand that god-damned kid.” Mike says, giving Alex a small light slap in the back of the head. 

The laughter starts slowly, and doesn’t really reach side bursting levels, but it’s an unspoken agreement. One that says, despite our faults, we’re in this together. 

“It does leave the question of how we are going to get out of this situation.” Kaz says, bringing down the mood a bit. 

“Worst case scenario, how long does it take for you to figure this place out?”Leo asks. 

“It’s not senseless, in a very literal way, it can’t be. It’s meant to house objects. That being said it’s also funded by nearly all world governments, and designed to do this very thing to unwanted guests. 

Three weeks isn’t out of the question. Of course we could find something in here that could get us out quickly, between the six of us we’ve enough knowledge. But I wouldn’t bank on that. “ Kaz replies. 

“If we can find a kitchen, I can try and turn junk food into a nutriloaf kind of thing. Might give us another week or so. “ Mike offers. 

“Punch, no more keeping things to yourself, okay?” Sveta says, her tone tells me she isn’t over things, but willing to work together if it means getting her hands on William. 

“I’ll do anything I can to make it up to you. I get that I was wrong.” I reply. 


Time is a monster in and of itself. As much of a fear inducing force as endless rooms, or strange noises coming from too far away. 

The first day goes by quickly, heads on a swivel, fear and rage fueling our trudge through the rooms. 

The second day we start to see the effects of eating nothing but expired vending machine snacks on Sveta, Mike, Leo and Alex. Conversation is less, thankfully there are functional washrooms. Nothing resembling a kitchen yet though. 

On the third Kaz and Hyve seem to figure out a kind of pattern. After 12 hours of testing, they manage to be able to predict where rooms will be. Everyone gets excited till it’s explained that this is the non-Euclidian equivalent of popping the trunk on a vehicle.

By the fourth the human ( or close) members of the group are looking bad. Pale, sweating, even Leo seems out of breath constantly. Alex’s damaged eye is looking bad. Though this isn’t the worst of the day. 

Those noises, they seem to be getting closer. 

“We’re not alone here are we?” Alex asks as we search through a Western themed room for anything that isn’t just crap memorabilia. 

“Don’t think so.” Leo replies. 

“No way that prick doesn’t have something on stand by. “ Mike explains. 

“Hyve and myself could use some time to run a few experiments.” Hyve says, hinting at something. 

“Are you thinking these are Liminal space critters, or someone who might know something?” Leo prods. 

“Hard to say. But either way they will be making an appearance shortly. Within the next day or two. “ Kaz answers. 

“And in another two days, the three of us will be shitting blood and passing out. “ Mike adds. 

“It would likely be better to engage whatever may be waiting for us on our terms. “ Hyve says. 

Which is where I’ll leave things off at the moment. 

Whatever is around the corner, we need time to plan. We’ve been through a lot, but walking face first into this beartrap, is scaring the hell out of me. 

As always, all of your ideas, help, plans are appreciated, let me know. 

Till next time, if there is one. 

Stay safe. 

Punch.
