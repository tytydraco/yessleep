I met a girl, fell in love, and asked her to marry me. It's the oldest story in the book, isn't it?

We bought our dream home. We were both in love with our jobs. We even had two children—a girl and then a few years later, a boy. We were happy, you know? But then that damned fire. It took everything from me.

Rachel had taken off early that day. It was my turn to pick up the children from daycare, but I had to finish up something at work. It seemed  important at the time, but now, I can't even remember what the fucking thing was. Anyway, I asked Rachel to pick up the kids for me. She said she would, but I owed her "the date-night of the millennium." She laughed, I said I loved her, and I hung up. That was the last time we talked.

When I finally got home, it was burning. Firetrucks and firefighters were surrounding what was just a shell of what it used to be. No one survived. When they told me they found their bodies, I collapsed. My legs just stopped working. I don't remember much after that. It's all just a blur.

After the funeral, I quit my job, sold the shitheap that used to be my house (I sold it for pennies), and moved somewhere as far away from that city as possible. I couldn't be there any longer. I wouldn't have been able to hold on. And I knew my wife and children wouldn't want that for me. I was just trying to survive for them. I didn't give a damn about myself.

I bought a rundown house in the middle of nowhere and threw myself at alcohol. My day was never over until I could see the bottom of the bottle. I couldn't be sober. I just couldn't.

After several weeks of drowning myself in liquor, I began seeing my family again. I thought it was the alcohol. I had whole conversations with my wife and children. I would usually be sobbing by the end of them. I told them how much I missed them. How badly I just wanted one more fucking day with them. I would usually pass out drunk while speaking to them. I would wake up in the morning and throw myself back at the bottle. If being shitfaced was the only way I could talk to my dead family, then so be it.

There was a shitty swing in the backyard of the house I had bought. When I wasn't talking to my family, I was staring at that thing. My daughter—Alice—had loved the swing in our backyard. If she had had her way, she would have made me push her on that damn thing for hours. One day, after trying to drink enough to talk to my family, I went out to stare at the swing. Alice was sitting on it. I smiled and walked over to her. I wouldn't have to be alone with my thoughts. 

With her back still turned to me, my daughter spoke to me. "Daddy, you should join us." I stopped dead in my tracks.

"What, honey?"

"I said you should fucking kill yourself." 

I dropped the bottle I was holding. She had turned to face me at this point. She still looked like the same innocent girl I had known before the fire. Her hair was still up in pony-tails, and she still had her cheerful smile that could make you want to do anything for her. But her words....

"You're the reason Mommy's dead. Sure, me and Benny probably still would have turned out to look like burnt pieces of chicken, but you could have saved her. If only you weren't such a coward. Why couldn't you have told your boss no? Why couldn't you have given a damn about your fucking family!"

"Honey, I...."

"You're sorry? Don't you dare tell me you're fucking sorry! YOUR WHOLE GODDAMN FAMILY IS IN THE GROUND, FEEDING WORMS, AND YOU'RE FUCKING SORRY!"

I couldn't take it anymore. I ran inside. I ran away from my own daughter. That night I got rid of all the alcohol I had. I didn't want that to happen again. That night I weeped. I mourned what I had lost. I don't even remember falling asleep.

I woke to the sound of something knocking on wood. I had a hell of a hangover, but I was sober for the first time in God knows how long. The knocking was giving hell to my head. I got up and opened up my door. There was little Benny. He was still in his PJs. I was completely sober, and I was looking at my dead child.

"Daddy, why did you run away from Aly? She was just trying to help you. You destroyed our family our family, and she was kind enough to give you a way out. All you have to do is get that gun out from under the bed, put it to your head, and pull the goddamn trigger. You might not have been able to save us, but surely you can do that?"

I slammed the door shut on my son. I thought I was going insane. If it wasn't the alcohol, then it was me. Had I really had so much damage done to my psyche that I was seeing my dead family? No, I thought. I was not going insane. I opened up the door, telling myself that none of this was real. My son was still there. This time half of his face was burnt off. I fainted.

When I came to, my sone was gone, but my wife was standing over me. Of course she was. I had been visited and blamed by my dead fucking children. Why not my wife too?

I was now on the bed instead of on the floor in front of the door. My dead wife was sitting next to me, stroking my hair.

"I watched them die, Robert. I watch the flames devour our children, and I could do nothing. Why would you do this to me, Robert? Why the hell did you make me take off work just so you could finish your fucking project? Did my job not matter? Or was I just a tool to be used at your disposal, your royal highness. 'Oh shit, I need to finish this. Better call that fucking whore to pick up those leeches at daycare. Ah, wouldn't life be better without those damn nuisances?' Well, you got your wish, Robert. We're all fucking dead, and it's all your fault, you selfish bastard!"

"It's not like that. And you're not real."

"I'm not real? Are you serious?"

She wrapped her hands around my neck and shoved me against the headboard of the bed.

"Is this real enough for you, Robert?"

"Please, stop."

"Then fucking end it."

She disappeared. I got out of that house as fast as I could. I couldn't stand to be there for another second. I drove myself to the nearest hospital as fast as possible and checked myself into the psych ward. I don't know if they were real or not. I have fucking handprints around my neck. The staff here think I did that to myself. I really hope that they're right.
