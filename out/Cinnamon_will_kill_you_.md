Let me start by saying I am *not* allergic to cinnamon. This isn’t one of those “I ate a cookie and my throat closed up” kind of stories. No, this is worse. Much worse.



You see, I suffer from PTSD. Not the military kind. Not the “I got lost in the Amazon jungle” kind either.

My trauma stems from something far more sinister: Margaret.

Margaret, my ex-wife. Or, as I like to call her, MargaBitch.



She left me for a guy who looked like Jabba the Hutt if Jabba wore Gucci loafers. And when she left, she didn’t just take the house, the car, or the money. Oh no. She took Rocket, my pet raccoon.

Who does that? Who steals a man’s emotional support trash panda?



After the divorce, I was a wreck. My coworkers kept chirping about "plenty of fish in the sea," like the sea wasn’t filled with mercury and floating garbage.



So, naturally, I decided the solution was isolation. I bought a cottage in the middle of buttfuck nowhere. A fixer-upper with no Wi-Fi, heating, or running water, but it had a fireplace, so that’s something.

One evening, after five failed attempts to light said fireplace, I finally got it going. I made myself a cup of hot cocoa—because I’m classy—and put on Schlatt’s Christmas album. (Yes, it’s a banger. No, I won’t apologize.)



My therapist had suggested keeping a journal to “process my emotions.” I wasn’t thrilled about the idea, but fine. I named it Jerry. Not a diary—diaries are for preteens. Jerry was a respectable, manly journal.



I was mid-sip, listening to “Merry Schlattmas,” when I smelled it. Cinnamon. Strong, sweet, and unmistakable.

Now, let me remind you: I was alone. In the woods. Miles from civilization. The only smells I expected were wet wood and my own failure.

But cinnamon? That scent was Margaret’s signature. She wore it everywhere, like a walking Yankee Candle. Back when I loved her, I called it “the scent of Christmas.” Now, it smelled like betrayal and alimony checks.



I followed the scent outside, onto my rickety porch. The boards creaked under my feet, and the cold bit through my flannel pajamas. And there it was. A figure.

I don’t know how to describe it. Tall? Maybe. Humanoid? Sort of. It stood about thirty feet away, blurry and indistinct. Then again, everything is blurry to me. I’m basically blind without my glasses, and I wasn’t about to risk fumbling around for them in the cold.

It didn’t move. Neither did I. I considered the situation carefully:

1. The smell of cinnamon.
2. A creepy figure in the woods.
3. My hot cocoa cooling by the fire.

I made the only logical choice.

I flipped it the bird, muttered, “Not today, Satan,” and went back inside.



That night, I locked the door, threw an extra log on the fire, and finished my cocoa. I didn’t think about the figure again—well, not until the next morning when I found Cinnamon's footprints leading up to my porch.

Great. Just what I needed. A cinnamon-smelling cryptid stalking me in the woods. What’s next? A peppermint demon? A gingerbread zombie?

Whatever it is, I’ll deal with it. But first, I need to buy more cocoa.
