Was it the work of reality or was it the work of my fantasy? Even I didn't know the answer. Who am I? Where am I? Am I even real? These are the questions that came into my mind as always as I open my eyes, even the question of Is someone else opening them came into my mind, but whatever, it was always like this, "Huh! This is... This is not what I wanted" I screamed outloud as I realised that going back is improbable.

I was always someone who was looked up by many and feared as well. As they say 'People fear the Unknown' and that unknown was obviously me, as I could do things easily that others couldn't, they called me the guy who can do the impossible as you should already know. They had many questions in their mind when looking at me from their screens or directly from their eyes, so do I, even now after so many years. Even I wondered, why is it like this? Is it because I am supposed to be a main character? Is it because I am gifted? I know they also have these questions in their mind but let's talk about real question how do I make them understand that I am not hiding anything, they think 'He knows why he is different from us but doesn't tell us or can't tell us' but since I also don't know the answer I am also same as them, I also want to know the inconceivable truth that this reality hides.

Everyone thought he is some great person to be either looked up or just get rid of him but they couldn't since he is also powerful and he even made something that he doesn't share with others, he calls it, 'Anti-bomb missile' and tells everyone he has that and can use it anytime, even nuclear bomb can not harm him. So no one even tries to kill him as people wonder what wrath they have to go through if they harm their helper as he also created many medicine and found way to use most of resources in the world and also helped establish a common society. He was going right way until this point, people always knew his discoveries and next moves but he just went and did something as dumb as being a teacher of kids, everyone wondered why?

I became a teacher, yes, the one who teaches to middle schoolers since toddlers and those high school kids ain't my thing. I was making the kids understand things from my perspective but it feels empty since no one ever asks dumb questions, Is it because they know me and fear me? Well I would also fear myself if I were them. But what about this notification? Huh? Notification? Wait what is this screen in my left? It reads- 'Task failed'. What was it a game to begin with? Or is it a simulation? Am I dreaming? Now something new happened, I was bored as hell, I feel refreshed, all fatigue gone! Something is gonna happen, right? This translucent red thingy will tell next procedure let's wait. Huh? Nothing happened why is it not not saying anything else or at least it should disappear, its not transparent so my one-third vision is just a blur. I should try something, 'Understood', 'Remove', 'Cut', 'Back', 'Check'.... I have tried so many of these but nothing seems to happen, now let's think my next option, oh I am still at this school and I was yelling those words in front of kids like an Idiot, well at least they have different emotions because of me. Now let's go home and think over it on the way since I can't tell about this to anyone, it will just create ruckus, I will just ask my mom. 

"I thought of many ways on the way but I can't figure out what to do, Mom." As I completed my sentence. My mom smiled and said "I understand, it is exactly as they said on TV."
??? What?
