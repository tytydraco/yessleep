We don’t know how long we have, but me and a group of truth seekers have managed to break into a facility. We had someone hack the system and we got in stealthily. It was all fine until we heard an alarm. Two people wearing hazmat suits ran out, immediately ran back when they saw us. We all know the jig was up. 

All of us were running back. I already knew we were dead when I heard aggressive voices and even some barking. Two of the members of our group managed to escape and help the rest of us. I was the second one to get out. The last member was half way out, but the dogs got his legs. It was horrifying; watching him yell in pain from some aggressive animals. I wanted to move, but I was still left in shock from the yelling and this man’s pleads for mercy. I snapped back when I heard him tell us something before he got pulled back in. “Upload… the logs.” He was immediately pulled  in after. As me and the other two members were running, I heard more pleads and barking. Then a gunshot. We are still driving back from the facility. I am still really spook from the events, but I have to get these logs out. The internet isn’t that great right. I think I can get one log out before we get back. Let’s hope someone sees this.

[Day 1][Ben Harris][Subject #73]
I don’t know what’s going on. This can’t be a prank, nor some type of challenge. H-Hold on. Let me start from the beginning. My name is Ben Harris. I am an elementary school teacher. I was going through business as usual. When I got home, I was feeling tired. I went to bed. I went to sleep quickly. 

I woke up in a completely different room; a different house somehow. I got up and started looking around my surroundings. I left the room to start investigating the rest of the house. The layout wasn’t the same, but it had some of my stuff. The family photos for example. It was the same photos, but the eyes were gone. They still have the noses, mouths, and even ears, but no eyes. 

I went downstairs and noticed even more of my stuff. My teacher award, my bike rack, even my PlayStation. My concern was definitely starting to go up from here. This house isn’t mine and yet it has almost everything I own. It was when I heard some people hollering to each other, I was getting a little hope. I left the house and saw some more people leaving and out of the houses; all looking confused. Some people were just standing there, a couple of people were trying to talk, but they both were speaking different languages, a woman was running around crying, there was even some children by themselves. 

I went to a man close to me to ask him what’s going on. Thankfully, he was an English speaker. He too, was confused over the whole situation. “I was watching a movie with my family, then I started to fall asleep.” he said looking around the area. Reading back I forgot to mention the surroundings of the environment we are in. There were homes everywhere. It was just like a regular neighborhood. Every house had a similar look to it. 

While me and the guy were talking, the crying woman ran up to us. It was hard to get her under control because of all the weeping and tears. Me and the other guy got her to calm down and explain to us why she is crying. “My baby. Where is he? My baby.” was the only thing she was crying about. We still couldn’t understand her. 

Another woman walked up to us with a strong British accent. She introduced herself as Emily and told us some things that she said “We needed do know”. We aren’t the only ones here. There are a lot more neighborhoods with different looking houses. Each house seemed to have came with house person. That’s all she told. She said it was to protect us from freaking out even more. I kinda don’t blame her. The first guy I talked to asked her to show us her form of currency. I was expecting pull a few pounds out of her pocket, but should pulled out a few Euros. The guy made the accusation that she wasn’t from the UK, but she said the Euro was the official currency of England. I was going to say something, but the crying woman added “No. The official currency of England was the American dollar.” 

Now, we were all really spooked. We can’t explain why each of us had different currencies. Either way, it was getting dark. We all agreed to meet up at the same spot. The British woman lived a few blocks down she said. We planned to learn each others laws and backstories from our homes. In the meantime, we needed sleep. I can’t explain what is happening and why we are here, but one thing is for certain. None of us are from the same place.

[Researcher’s note]
The subject seems to display confusion, just like the rest of the other subjects. He had remained to stay calm throughout out the day. His vitals were all normal. Further research is required.

We are almost at base. I’ll try to continue posting. They are going to search for us. That is definitely for certain. But that doesn’t matter. We have to get this out.
