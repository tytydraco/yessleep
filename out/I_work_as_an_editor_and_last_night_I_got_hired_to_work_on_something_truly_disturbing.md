My name is Simon Miller, I work as an editor and I mainly edit movies, but sometimes I edit other stuff like YouTube videos and such. Sometimes I get weird requests like editing a weird indie movie, or weird gameshows that are mostly just people doing disgusting things. I have never experienced anything as terrifying or horrible as what I have experienced today, and I don’t know If should be telling you about this, but I will because I must share this because I will go crazy if I don’t.

 

Last night around 7:30 pm I was in a bar with some friends when I got an email from a person that was going under the name of John Doe. I found that suspicious because that obviously wasn’t their name. I opened the message, and this is what the email said.

&#x200B;

Dear Mr. Miller 

I have been looking for an editor for one of my movies for a long time and you Mr. Miller, are the perfect one for my work.

My movie might be a little out of the ordinary but that isn't anything to worry about. 

I am willing to pay $250 000 for this film and of course, I am open to negotiations.

&#x200B;

I was astounded. I have never gotten that much money for any of the films I have edited, the most I have ever gotten was $25k for one weird artsy flick. This was amazing for me because I haven't had any work in a long time and this much money would’ve changed my life for the better. I should’ve realized that this was a red flag because if I hadn’t taken that job, I would’ve been free of the nightmares that I will experience for the rest of my life.

&#x200B;

So, I stayed at the bar for another 30 minutes, and I came back home. I sat down in front of my computer and wrote back to the guy.

&#x200B;

Dear Mr. Doe

I am willing to take that job for the price you mentioned in your email. Please send me everything you need me to edit.

&#x200B;

He replied almost instantly

Dear Mr. Miller

That’s wonderful news!! I have attached all the scenes to this email. Once I see the movie in its full glory, I'll send you the money we agreed upon. Once again, I want to remind you that this movie is out of the ordinary and you might think it’s a little weird but don’t worry, just keep thinking about what you’ll do with the money once you get it.

&#x200B;

I thought that the last half of the message was very weird, but I guess that the beers I had an hour ago were thinking for me, so I downloaded the scenes and put them all into premiere pro.

&#x200B;

When I started editing the scenes, I realized that every single one was at least 8 hours long. I thought that was extremely bizarre because this movie was only supposed to be 80 minutes long.

&#x200B;

I started skimming through the scenes and the only thing that was on it was video camera footage of a chair in the middle of a room, there was blood all over the floor and something that looked like creepy-looking red eyes staring at me in the corner of my screen. I got so freaked out that I closed the program immediately, but the eyes were burned into the monitor. I realized that I was probably just being stupid and that it was just a movie and that I couldn’t possibly be real. 

&#x200B;

I opened Premiere again and put the scenes back into the program and started skimming through them again. I got back to where I was before and let the scene play. I could’ve sworn that the eyes were staring right at me and whenever I moved or looked someplace else, I felt them looking at me. 

&#x200B;

I got to the 1 hour and 23-minute mark when I saw something I could never unsee again. The red-eyed creature crawled out of its dark corner crawling on its back and its spine being twisted and turned, it looked so disgusting that I feel the need to puke just thinking about it. It crawled to the middle of the room, stood up, and stared staring at me and pointing to the chair. I wanted to look away, but I just couldn’t. I tried with all my power, but some weird force kept me glued to the screen. That’s when it spoke. 

&#x200B;

“This is your place, Simon” 

&#x200B;

It started pointing to the chair, and I tried to close the program, but I couldn’t, I couldn’t move, I felt trapped. Then something happened that shook me to my core. Something walked in, at first, I couldn’t tell what it was because its face was deformed. It sat on the chair, and that’s when I realized what it was. It was me, a deformed version of me.

&#x200B;

 I couldn’t stop looking and that’s when the thing spoke again.

&#x200B;

“This is where you belong, and you will be here shortly.”

&#x200B;

I started thinking I was insane, that someone had spiked my drink, or that I was hallucinating or something. And then, I started feeling lightheaded and I passed out on my desk.

&#x200B;

I woke up in a dark warehouse or something like that, there were no windows, and the only thing I could see was the creatures' red eyes staring at me. I tried to yell but I just couldn’t, something was stopping me. 

&#x200B;

I felt terrified, I didn’t know what to do, the only thing I could think about was who that guy that messaged me was and why did he do this.

&#x200B;

The creature was staring at me and every single time I looked away it was closer to me. I decided that I would just look away and let it get me because either way it would attack me.

&#x200B;

I looked away and started thinking about my family and I hoped that I was the only one of them that was experiencing this horrible nightmare. 

&#x200B;

I waited for a while, and nothing happened. I looked back at where the creature was, but I couldn’t see it. I was relieved, I thought I was safe now and I tried to stand up and to my surprise, I could. I was happy and I thought I was free. I started walking up to something that I thought was a door when I walked up to it. I got attacked by the creature; I don’t know what it did to me, but I saw and felt things that I have never seen or felt. I didn’t know what was happening to me, I didn’t know if I felt pain or euphoria. I saw things like colors I have never seen before. I don’t remember anything that happened after that, I only remember singular images of other things I have seen in this state, like as if I was dreaming. I didn’t know what happened but I'm glad it's over because I didn’t like what I was feeling, it didn’t feel good nor bad, it's just something I couldn’t explain.

&#x200B;

After that experience, I started to feel normal again. I woke up from whatever happened to me back in the warehouse, but this time it was different. I knew that It was over now. My eyes slowly started to close, I tried to resist it, but I couldn't.

&#x200B;

I woke up on a bench in New York with a wallet that wasn’t mine that had a check for $250 000 in it and a note that said thank you. I don’t know what happened to me, but I hope that nobody else will ever have to experience this.
