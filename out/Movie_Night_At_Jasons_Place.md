It was a bitter cold February evening, perfect for a movie night indoors with friends. Jason had agreed to host. 

 

Well, no one had to twist his arm, he was practically begging for the opportunity to force-feed one of his “indie” arthouse movies down our throats. He said he had a new system installed and the “watching experience” would be unforgettable. 

Tony picked me up. “Did he say what he was going to put on?” 

“Nah man. But I’m down for anything, it’s just good to get out.” 

“Yeah man. I wanted to see *Gladiator 2*\- I should’ve said that in the group chat.” 

“Jason won’t be putting on *Gladiator 2*” I scoffed. “he’s all like, Hollywood is for the masses, you know that.”  

Tony grunted, pulled up, parked and we got out, trudging through the frozen snow up to Jason’s place. 

“So long as it’s not *Babygirl,* I’m good. Emily had it on with her girlfriends last week- I’m so done with hearing about how Hollywood is degrading women by showing them as dogs under the guise of empowerment. Between Jason and Emily-” I shook my head. 

“Sounds like my type of movie.” Tony smirked. 

Jason was waiting for us. He looked much like he had since middle school, when we had all become friends. He had started becoming a weeb back then when it was kind of mainstream, what with Gwen Stefani’s music videos everywhere those days- lots of guys got really, really into Japanese stuff. 

Years passed- Jason talked less and less about Studio Ghibli, pronouncing the “gh” in the hard way which somehow always made me twitch, and got into indie movies and foreign films. 

Now his eyes shone excitedly behind his narrow glasses. 

“You guys, come on in- can’t wait to show off my new system!” 

We trooped down to his basement where we had spent many childhood hours- he still lived in his parents’ house after they had both passed on. The walls were all decorated with Asian artefacts. A large sword hung on the door of the basement.  

We followed Jason in. And then we stopped in surprise. 

The basement was all stylishly done up like a proper movie theatre- five big leathery bulging seats set in a semi-circle, looking up at a wide silvery screen. 

“Nice, man,” said Tony. “Where you get the dough for this?” 

“Oh you know- after my parents’ passed-” his voice drifted off. 

“Looks great!” I plonked myself in nearest chair. It was incredibly comfortable. 

“I got booze and snacks in the fridge over there- grab what you want guys.” Jason said. 

It was a bit of a struggle hauling myself up, but soon we were both seated with a beer and crisps, watching Jason fiddle with a panel installed into the wall. 

“So, what are we watching Jason? Can we watch *Babygirl*\- heard it shows Nicole Kidman having sex with a dog, but like, arty, you know?” Tony took a swig of his beer. Even in the dark of the basement, I saw Jason’s back stiffen. But his voice was calm. 

“We are not watching *Babygirl* Tony. We are watching *Parasite*\- an award-winning Korean movie.” 

“Ah c’mon man- parasite? Is that like that disgusting fly movie you tried to make us watch in high school? Is it body horror?”  

Jason straightened and turned to us. “It’s not body horror; it’s not like that- and I promise you’ll like it. Give it a chance!” Again, I couldn’t help noticing a stiffness in his features. 

“Korean, dude? Ahhh listening to those Asian languages make my heard hurt. We have to read sub-titles - Can’t we just watch *Gladiator 2*?” The last question was said in an obnoxious fake “Asian” accent. 

You must realise though, Tony wasn’t a bad guy, just that kind of guy’s guy, you know? The guy that would get fired in a second if HR saw his group chat. 

Well, all our group chat, I suppose. 

“We’re not watching *Gladiator 2*! I’ve picked the movie we’re watching! *Parasite* has won the Oscar for best Foreign Film! Bong Joon-Ho is the best director-” exclaimed Jason. 

Tony brought out his phone, cutting Jason off. 

“Whatever man. You gotta get over it” 

“I didn’t want to do this, but you two aren’t giving me a choice! I told you before about phones when watching!” cried Jason, and he punched a button in the wall. 

Immediately, three wide belts snaked out of the armrest of the chair, whipped across our bodies and fastened us in place. One belt went across our legs, just before the knees, the second across our waist, and the third just below the elbows. 

There was a moment of dead silence.  

Then Tony yelped. “Hey! What the actual fuck- you little prick- what the fuck do you think-“  

Jason started talking very fast.  

“I didn’t want to do this Tony- but you never give me a chance! I’ve been telling you about Bong Joon-Ho- you just won’t listen. I tried to make you watch *A Taxi-Driver* by Jang Hoon- and you walked out. Give it a fucking chance- stop yapping about Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise! It’s for your own good- your brain is infected by Hollywood and there’s so much more out there-” His voice became pleading. 

“You fucking psycho, let me out!” shouted Tony. We were both struggling but the belts were very tight- and tightening. I felt the one across my chest constraining my breathing. 

“Please Jason!” I gasped. 

In response, a fourth belt whipped out across our necks. I could feel the thick fabric pressing against my windpipe. 

“If you keep struggling” said Jason, “I’ll activate the contraption that will keep your eyelids open and your mouth shut for the two hours. Is that what you want?” 

We whimpered. Tony’s eyes were bulging, and I thought he would die there and then. 

“You’ll thank me, I promise you’ll enjoy it. I can’t let you have your beer I’m afraid, because I can’t trust you not to go on your phone, but you won’t need beer. *Parasite* is just fantastic.” 

He pressed some more buttons, and large perfect Korean faces began to shine on the screen above us.  

“Wait till I get my hands on you you psychopath!” screamed Tony. 

Jason pressed more buttons. The Korean actors paused. A fifth belt snaked out of the armchair, across Tony’s mouth, effectively gagging him.  

And then, tiny little metallic arms emerged from close to Tony’s head, scuttled onto his face, attached themselves to his upper and lower eyelids, and pulled them back.  

I had never been so terrified in my life.  

Tony was perfectly still. Jason moved towards Tony. “Listen to me asshole. Here’s what’s going to happen. You are going to watch *Parasite* with the respect it deserves. Afterwards, I’ll free you, and the three of us will discuss the movie together. Then you can go home. Understand?” 

Tony nodded slightly, as far as the belts constricting his face and neck allowed him. The light from the screen gleamed on his frantic eyeballs.  

Jason continued. “And, if you tell anyone, or make any kind of fuss about this, or try to hurt me in anyway afterwards, all the text message from our group chat will be released for all the world to see. I think your boss would really like to see the ones you sent describing what you’d like to do his wife after you were denied promotion, remember? Or when they hired a Black guy- remember what you said about that?”  

Tony’s eyes stretched wider if possible and he nodded again.  

Jason looked over at me. “You good there Mike?”  

I nodded.  

“Ok then, let’s get started. I’m so excited we’re doing this you guys!!” cried Jason. He went back to the panel. The actors started moving again. I frantically started reading the subtitles.    

Jason was as good as his word. He loosened the belts halfway through, and honestly, it wasn’t a bad movie. When it was over, Tony and I both were able to have a reasonable discussion which seemed to make us happy. He showed us out, and we thanked him for the evening.  

Tom dropped me off. We didn’t say a word on the drive home.  

And we never watched a movie with Jason, ever again.
