**PART ONE**

I never, in a million years, thought I’d ever write this story down, but I feel like I’m all out of options. I’m twenty-eight years old, and I’m not a functional person. I don’t sleep well on the nights I actually manage to close my eyes. My appetite has been gone for years. I’m on my third job this year and will probably get fired soon from this one too. The times I’m not at work, I’m high or drunk. Usually both.

My therapist thinks I should try writing this stuff down, if only to just get it out into the world, to make a record of it. There’s no better neutral party than a blank sheet of paper, she says. It reserves all criticism, holds no biases.

I like her the best out of the many therapists I’ve tried over the years. She’s the only professional I’ve seen who hasn’t tried to talk me out of the facts of my own story, the things I’ve seen with my own two eyes.

It’s hard to tell how much of my account she actually believes, but maybe the truthfulness of it doesn’t really matter to her. Whenever I’ve retold the story to her, as impossible as it seems, she always sits there with her cool, kind gaze, her eyes professionally trained to withhold judgement. The homework she assigned me this week is to write my story down in full, sparing no detail, no matter how painful. In bringing these things to light, she hopes, I can begin the process of moving on. I can begin getting… unstuck.

I doubt it’ll help, but at this point I’m willing to try anything. The alternatives, after all, are much worse.

So… here goes nothing.

I was thirteen, having just finished seventh grade, when my mom got a new job in a small town two states away. The place where she worked had just shuttered, but her company had offices all over the country. It seems that corporate HR had seen enough value in her to try to retain her, which would mean transferring her to a different branch. This was 2009, mind you, and the thought of having to look for a job on the open market, especially as a single mother, was gut-wrenchingly terrifying. During the worst financial crisis of her lifetime, it seemed like there were two options; transfer or starve. My mom chose transfer.

I was still a kid at the time, so these details only really became clear to me in hindsight. All I really knew about the situation was that I was moving away from all the friends I’d ever known to a new place I didn’t even care about, for seemingly no reason at all. As an adult, I appreciate the sacrifices and hard decisions my mom made on my behalf. As a thirteen-year-old boy, I took it about as well as you’d expect.

I hated every second of it.

School hadn’t started yet, so beyond unpacking our few boxes of belongings, there wasn’t much to do during the day. I hadn’t made any friends yet, and there was nowhere to go in town besides a mall that smelled like cigarettes and bleach and a movie theater that smelled like cigarettes and popcorn. I mostly stayed home playing video games and reading my old comics all day, but whenever my mom came home, I’d do my best to muster a cheery response when she asked me how my day was, plastering my best fake smile across my face.

I tried my best to never let mom see how miserable I really was. My dad died when I was six, and my mom never remarried, never seemed *interested* in remarrying. We were a team of two, and a team didn’t work if its own members started turning on each other. So, I gritted my teeth and tried to get through the summer, hoping that when school started up again and I enrolled in eighth grade, I’d at least find one living person that would like me enough to spend time with me.

As I mentioned before, you start to understand things better with the hindsight of adulthood, and I imagine that I didn’t hide my misery from mom as well as I thought I did. It was evident in the way she tried to brighten up the home at every opportunity, tried to make memories with me in times when I’d try to withdraw.

She’d fished her old record player from her college days out of storage and started playing music throughout the house after work. She’d take me to see movies on Saturday and wouldn’t even crinkle her nose at how bad we both knew the place smelled. She’d cook pancakes for dinner on random weeknights, go on walks with me Sunday afternoons when she could tell I’d spent all day in my room.

She was trying her best, and I loved her for that. She even started going out every Sunday morning to the thick forest behind our house and bringing in bouquets of freshly cut flowers to add to the garden she was working on out in the backyard. She even brought a pot of fresh purple lilacs to my room one day, putting it in the far corner to, as she so lovingly put it, “clear out that teenage boy smell.”

We had lived there for three weeks by then, and through mom’s hard work I’d resolved to try to, if not love, at least tolerate our new home as much as she was trying to. In the fall, I’d start eighth grade, and I’d do my best to make friends there. I’d make the most of our time in this new place, for her. I’d make myself excited to live there, at any cost. And anyways, all things considered, there were far worse places to live.

About a week later, I’d change my mind. That’s when the visitor came for the very first time.

It was somewhere around 2:00am when I woke up to a faint, light tapping noise. A soft *tink-tink-tink* sound that was just barely above the threshold to register it. It almost sounded like a tree branch periodically brushing against the side of the house, but we didn’t have any trees sitting that close, nor was it a particularly windy night. It also could have been the sound of water dripping from the roof onto the gutters, that sharp clang of falling water on flat metal, but we hadn’t had rain in a few weeks. Yet there was the sound all the same. *Tink-tink-tink*.

As I first drifted out of sleep, I barely even registered the noise and easily returned to my slumber. But it roused me again just a few minutes later, and this time I actually sat up in bed, craning my head to the side to try and focus my hearing, as if that actually did anything. And there it was. It was irregular, usually in short bursts of two to four, but it was definitely there. I scanned the room while the tapping continued, looking for the source of the noise.

*Tink.* My room was divided in half by a line of pale moonlight shining through the window directly to my left. My bed was shoved in the far corner of my room, so I could barely see out the window from where I sat. *Tink-tink-tink---tink.* There was my dresser sitting on the other side of the light on the floor, topped with pictures of my father holding me as a baby, my mom and I at the zoo, my old friends and I at my twelfth birthday party. *Tink-tink.* My desk sat near my dresser on the intersecting wall, just on the other side of the window from me. A small television sat on its surface next to my PlayStation and a set of two controllers. One of them had accumulated dust. Next to the television was the pot of flowers my mom gave me.

*Tink-tink*. My open closet was a jumbled mess, boxes piled high and shoved in at precarious angles. My clothes sat in scattered piles on the floor. I wasn’t sure what was clean and what wasn’t. My eyes danced around these parts of my room, over and over again, looking for what could be making the noise I was hearing, which seemed to be right there in the room with me. Then, my gaze landed on my window, where… *Tink.*

My blood ran cold when my eyes stopped on the window. Remember, due to the way my bed was positioned, the window was only about five feet from me, along the same wall I had my back to. As a result, I only got the slimmest of angles on it as I sat up in bed. Just a few inches that allowed me to see what was outside. And when I focused, when my eye caught the movement just right, I could finally make out what was producing the sound.

A gnarled finger, sticking out just barely into view, tapped against the glass of my window, ever so slightly, here and there at irregular intervals. The structure of the finger looked warped, like it had been run through a meat grinder with the skin on the outside still intact. But the skin was a mottled gray-green, and the nail at the end was chipped and snaggled and jaundice-yellow. The finger paused its tapping when I finally laid eyes on it, as if it knew that I had seen it, knew that I knew it was there. Then it tapped again with the same softness as before. Again, again, again. *Tink, tink, tink*.

My brain felt like a set of gears that someone had poured cement into as I tried to understand what I was seeing, working through that this wasn’t a dream, that I was really seeing this, all while the finger continued to tap away at the window. And when my still half-slumbering brain finished processing the information in front of me, my heart stopped, my back muscles tensed, my breath caught in my throat as I froze where I sat in bed.

Two reasons made me freeze so solidly, reasons that I would continue to return to on any clear night, even as a grown adult. The first reason was that, when I looked at the beam of moonlight cutting my room in half, there was no shadow to be seen. Whatever was outside my window either couldn’t be seen, or didn’t want to be seen, in the pale light cast onto my floor.

The other reason may seem obvious now but wasn’t quite so obvious to me at the time, especially in my sleep-addled mind. See, for all my life, I’d always lived in single-story homes. But with my mom’s transfer and subsequent pay raise, I finally had a room on the second floor of the house. It was the first time I ever lived in a house with stairs, ever had a window that looked out onto my front yard from above.

But that fact still took some getting used to, which was why it took me so long to put together that *there was no solid ground directly underneath my window*. There was nowhere to stand. No way to even climb up to it. No roof or lips or gutters that someone could get their footing with. There was just twenty feet of open air below my windowsill. And that frightened me more than anything else I’d ever seen.

I don’t know how I ever mustered up the courage to say something. I’m not even positive that it was a choice. Maybe it was more of a defense mechanism. But either way, I said the only thing that I could think of, that my mind was able to conjure up in that situation.

“He-hello?” I called timidly.

It was as if someone had flipped a switch. The finger stopped cold in its tracks at the sound of my voice. But it was still there, hovering just in front of the glass of my window. It felt like an eternity, and I was just waiting for another tap that would make me jump out of my skin. Then, all of a sudden, the finger slinked out of view. It was just… *gone*. Just like that.

I don’t know how I ever got to sleep that night, but I imagine that exhaustion eventually took me, just as it does these days. Regardless, when I woke up, still sitting upright against the wall next to my bed, I was only half certain that what I’d seen was real. It was only when I got out of bed and apprehensively approached the window that I was unfortunately proven wrong.

Because right there, in the lower right pane of the window on the outside of the glass, was a series of scratches in a tight circle, like someone had jabbed a knife, or a very sharp nail, lightly at the glass, over and over and over again.

Someone, or *something*, had been at my window last night. And I didn’t know what they wanted, or if they’d ever be back again.

Luckily, or unluckily, I wouldn’t have to wait long for the answer.
