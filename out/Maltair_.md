My friend, there’s a story around here that’s hard to forget, and even today, every time someone brings it up, I get chills down my spine. You know what it’s like living in the countryside of Minas Gerais, right? Life moves slow, everyone knows everyone, but there are things that get tucked away, almost forgotten, until someone decides to tell them again. And one of those stories is about \*\*Maltair\*\*, that strange old man who lived up on the hill, near the creek.



Maltair wasn’t much of a people person. For as long as I can remember, he was always that lonely figure. Nobody really got close to him, and he didn’t seem interested in talking to anyone either. If you saw him walking to the market or down at the fair with those weird pants of his, always pulled up high to his chest, it was like he was trying to hide behind his clothes. Folks said it was just his quirk, that he was afraid of something, but no one really knew what. His long white beard covered half his face, and the old straw hat took care of the rest. It was unsettling to look at him, you know? Like he carried the weight of something the rest of us couldn’t understand.



His house was the last one up the hill, a small, rotting wooden shack that got more and more forgotten as the years passed, just like him. People around town whispered that Maltair was cursed. Some thought it was just nonsense, idle gossip from those with too much time on their hands, but over time, it got harder to ignore. He lived alone, and that's how he died. They say one quiet night, with no moon in the sky, he just dropped dead right there in his house. There was no one to mourn him or watch over the body. His burial was quick, without ceremony, like folks wanted to be rid of the memory of him as soon as possible.



But the real problem wasn’t Maltair when he was alive. It was what came after. Not long after they buried him in the town cemetery, people who passed by the hill started telling stories that sent shivers through everyone. They said they saw a strange figure walking around at night, especially when the wind picked up. The story was always the same: a tall man, with his pants pulled up high to his chest, his white beard swaying in the wind, and that old straw hat. He never spoke, just stood there, staring, and then vanished without a trace.



The old-timers, who grew up hearing tales of curses and hauntings, said it was a bad omen. Whoever saw Maltair in that ghostly form knew that something terrible was coming. And sure enough, after people started seeing him, strange things began happening. People went missing in the woods, livestock died in strange ways, crops rotted without explanation. And every time something went wrong, someone would say they had seen Maltair, standing there, watching.



I never put much stock in those kinds of stories, but one day, when I went to gather firewood near his old place, I felt a chill run down my spine. It was a sunny day, but I swear, for a moment, the wind turned cold, like the shadow of something unseen had passed by. I didn’t see anything, thank God, but the older folks said just feeling that cold wind was a sign that Maltair was still roaming around.



No one dares go up that hill anymore, and Maltair’s house is still there, falling apart, being swallowed by the weeds. They say if you’re brave enough to go up there at night, you might just see the old man standing in the field, pants pulled up to his chest, staring into the distance with those empty eyes that seem to pierce right through you. But I’ll tell you, I don’t know anyone who’s tried. And I think it’s better that way.
