You might have heard about it. 

The village,  abandoned .The news, as vague and scarce as possible . The tight-lipped former inhabitants that you somehow just could pick out from the crowd.  Theories of natural disaster,  of mass psychosis, of government experiments,  even aliens. 

The truth is much simpler and horrifying than that. 

You see..it happened because of my actions.  It was my fault. 

I will not be disclosing my name or country.  Let me just say that I am a woman of faith. I pray, I go to church,  I believed as long as I remember. My husband left me years ago so I took my daughter Julia and moved to a farm in the village. We lived a calm, orderly life. I would get up early,  take care of the few animals and vegetables we had and then leave for my part time job. When I returned home I would cook and clean and take care of other chores. My little daughter would spend most of the day in the kindergarden. 

It was a rainy evening when the strangers appeared on my doorstep.  A small family,  a woman and two girls. They kept knocking on my door,  begging to be let in. I decided to shelter them for the night.They didn't appear dangerous . I wanted to show compassion,  to help the needy.

I have to admit,  they did look strange..as if they had been tortured. The girls had glassy eyes and they kept clenching their yellowy-blackish teeth, constantly hiding behind their mother. The mother was pale and thin, as if she had been starving. She did not want to answer any of my questions,  just kept repeating how tired she was and that she just needs a bit of rest. So I decided to stop prying and just let them rest downstairs, figuring we would talk in the morning. But they were already gone when I got out of bed at 5, leaving just prints of bare feet all over the place. 

I don't know how, but the neighbours already knew about this nightly visit.Apparently strange things were happening through the night, lights flickering,  livestock acting as if the animals were possessed,  people having nightmares or not being able to fall asleep at all. Our farm sits on the outskirts of the village so I didn't notice any of it. 

The day went by as usual up until the evening,  when our resident..well, I don't want to say witch came to visit me.  I am not sure but I think she calls herself Wiccan. She kept asking questions about last night but a strange thing happened when she was leaving.  On the doorstep she turned around and looked me in the eye.

" You have left evil into your house. Bad things will happen ".

I later learned that we weren't the first who did it. My neighbours told me that they also were visited by the woman and her two girls that night. There were also people who refused to let strangers into their homes in the middle of the night.


That occurence slowly began to be forgotten but it didn't stay forgotten for long. After a week I began having nightmares about that woman. But she didn't appear helpless in my dreams. I would stand near my house on the street and see her leering over my daughter's bed, holding a noose. I would try to run into my home but her two girls were holding me back with such strength that I  couldn't do anything and it was usually then when I would wake up. 

It didn't take long for strange things to begin happening after the nightmares started. My cow died (which was bad), the chickens started dying as well (which made things worse) and as I tried to bury the animals their carcasses broke open,  hordes of maggots squirming out of them and liquid of consistency and colour no animal should have poured from their bodies . I am not sure it wasn't blood. I thought nature would accept it's creatures into the soil. I was wrong...

Then my daughter fell sick.

It started as a common cold but quickly grew into something else. I called a doctor who gave her meds and injections before he left again,  but my girl didn't get better. All I felt was despair and fear. I didn't feel well in my own home,  as if it hated us.

I decided to find the Wiccan woman and maybe talk to her, ask for advice.  But I couldn't find her anywhere and the other village people kept saying that she disappeared long ago. Nobody believed me, that she visited me. Aside from that I learned the newest village news: the livestock began to die in all households,  two people went missing and the neighbour two houses down the street from my house hanged himself last night.

I returned.  I didn't know that the scariest thing of my life would happen this night. I did all the chores and tried to tuck my daughter in but it was difficult.  She was afraid of something but wouldn't tell me. 
I couldn't fall asleep for hours and when I did I had the nightmare again.  I was awoken by my daughter's scream. I tried getting out of bed but couldn't,  someone was pinning my arms down.
It were the two girls, standing on both sides of the bed, holding me with inhumane strength. I panicked and started trashing in my bed, trying to break free. But the more I struggled,  the stronger they kept me down. 

I don't know when or how I began praying. And only then did their grip loosen and I stormed to my daughter's room, my heart pounding in my chest. In the room I saw the silhouette of the pale woman fade, the noose from my dreams tightly wrapped around my daughter's neck. I tore it off, scooped my girl into my arms and ran to the neighbours. They weren't exactly happy about our nightly visit but seeing our condition they let us in and didn't ask any questions. 

I barely managed to stay the night. In the morning,  not packing any of our things, not returning to our home at all we took the train to my sister who lived in the nearest town.
She didn't believe my story but when she saw the bruises on my arms and the trace of the noose on my daughter's neck even she, an atheist, crossed herself. 

We lived at her place for a while before moving to our own place in town. 

They say the village got deserted entirely half a year after this. Most people just up and left their homes.  And those who stayed didn't live long.

So there you have it.  Now you know.
