I wake, and in the darkness of mine and Naadia’s tent a light blinds me... I squint my eyes towards it, and peeking in from outside the tent is Moses, Tye and Jerome – each holding a wooden spear. They tell me to get dressed as I’m going spear-fishing with them, and Naadia berates them for waking us up so early... I’m by no means a morning person but... even with Naadia laying next to me, I really didn’t want to lie back down in the darkness, with the disturbing dream I just had fresh in my mind... I just wanted to forget about it instantly... I didn’t even want to think about it... 

Later on, the four of us are in the stream... We were all just standing there, with our poorly-made spears for like half an hour before any fish came our way... Eventually the first one came in my direction and the three lads just start yelling at me to get the fish. ‘There it is! Get it! Go on get it!’ I tried my best to spear it but it was too fast, and them lot shouting at me wasn’t helping. Anyway, the fish gets away downstream and the three of them just started yelling at me again, saying I was useless. I quickly lost my temper and started shouting back at them... Ever since we got on the boat, these three guys did nothing but get in my face. They mocked my accent, told me nobody wanted me there and behind my back, they said they couldn’t see what Naadia saw in that white limey... I had enough! I told all three of them to f**k off and that they could catch their own f*****g fish from now on – but as I’m about to leave the stream, Jerome yells at me ‘Dude! Watch out! There’s a snake!’ pointing by my legs. I freak out and quickly raise my feet out the water to avoid the snake. I panic so much that I lose my footing and splash down into the stream. Still freaking out over the snake near me, I then hear laughter coming from the three lads... There was no snake...  

Having completely had it with the lot of them, I march over to Jerome for no other reason but to punch his lights out... Jerome was bigger than me and looked like he knew how to fight, but I didn’t care – it was a long time coming. Before I can even try, Tye steps out in front of me, telling me to stop. I push Tye out the way to get to Jerome, but Tye gets straight back in my face and shoves me over aggressively. Like I said, out of the three of them Tye clearly hated me the most. He had probably been looking for an excuse to fight me and I had just given him one... But just as I’m about to get into it with Tye, all four of us hear ‘GUYS!’... We all turn around to the voice to see its Angela, standing above us on high ground, holding a perfectly-made spear with five or more fish skewered on there... We all stared at her kind of awkwardly, like we were expecting to be yelled at... but she instead tells us to get out of the water and follow her... She had something she needed to show us... 

The four of us followed behind Angela through the jungle and Moses demanded to know where we’re going. Angela says she found something earlier on, but couldn’t tell us what it was because she didn’t even know... and when she shows us... we understand why she couldn’t... It was... indescribable... but I knew what it was... and it shook me to my core... What laid in front of us, from one end of the jungle to the other... was a fence... the exact same fence from my dreams!...  

It was a never-ending line of crisscrossed sharp wooden spikes... only what was different was... this fence was completely covered in bits and pieces of dead rotting animals... There was skulls - monkey skulls, animal guts or intestines, invested with what seemed like hundreds of flies buzzing around and... the smell was like nothing I’d ever smelt before... All of us were in shock. We didn’t know what this thing was. Even though I recognized it, I didn’t even know what it was... and while Angela and the guys argued over what this was... I stopped and stared at what was scaring me the most... it was... the other side... On the other side of the spikes was just more vegetation – but right behind it you couldn’t see anything... it was darkness... like the entrance of a huge tropical cave... and right as Moses and Angela get into a screaming match... we all turn to notice something behind us... 

Standing behind us, maybe fifteen metres away... staring at us... was a group of five men... They were clearly locals. They wore ragged clothes and they were short in height... In fact, they were very short – almost like children... But they were all carrying weapons: bows and arrows, spears, machetes... They were clearly dangerous... There was an awkward pause at first, but then Moses shouts ‘Hello!’ He takes Angela’s spear with the fish and starts slowly walking towards them – we all tell him to stop but he doesn’t listen. One of the men then starts approaching Moses – he looked like their leader... There’s only like five meres between them when Moses starts speaking to the man – telling them we’re Americans and we don’t mean them any harm... He then offered Angela’s fish to the man, like an offering or some sought... The way Moses went about this was very patronizing – he spoke slowly to the man as he probably didn’t know any English... but he was wrong...  

In broken English, the man said ‘You. American?’... Moses then says loudly that we’re African American, like he forgot me and Angela were there. He again offers the fish to the man and says ‘Here! We offer this to you!’... The man looks at the fish, almost insulted – but then he looks around past Moses and straight at me... The man stares at me for a good long time, and all I can do is stare right back... I thought that maybe he’d never seen a white man before, but something tells me it was something else... The man continues to stare at me, with wide eyes... and then he shouts ‘OUR FISH!... YOU TAKE OUR FISH!’ Frightened, we all turn to look at each other. Moses looks back to us with a look of help. The man then takes out his machete and points it towards the fence behind us... He yells ‘NO SAFE HERE! YOU GO HOME! GO BACK AMERICA!’... The men behind him also begin shouting at us, waving their weapons in the air, almost ready to fight us! We couldn’t understand the language they were shouting at us in - but there was a word... a word I still remember... They were shouting at us... ‘ASILI!... ASILI! ASILI! ASILI!’ over and over...  

Moses, the idiot he was, he then approached the man, trying to reason with him. The man then raises his machete up to Moses, threatening him with it! Moses throws up his hands for the man not to hurt him, and then he slowly makes his way back to us, without turning his back to the man... As soon as Moses reaches us, we head back in the direction we came – back to the stream and the commune... but the men continue shouting and waving their weapons at us – and as soon as we lose sight of them... we run! 

When we get back to the commune, we tell the rest of the group what just happened as well as what we saw... Like we thought they would, they freaked the f***k out. We all speculated on what the fence was... Angela said that it was probably a hunting ground that belonged to those men, which they barricaded and made to look menacing to scare people off... This theory seemed the most likely – but what I didn’t understand was... how the hell had I dreamed of it?? How the hell had I dreamed of that fence before I even knew it existed??... I didn’t tell the others this because I was scared what they might think – but when it was time to vote on whether we stayed or went back home, I didn’t waste a second in raising my hand in favour of going – and it was the same for everyone else... The only person who didn’t raise their hand was Moses. He wanted to stay... This entire idea of starting a commune in the rainforest, it was his... It clearly meant a lot to him – even at the cost of his life... His mind was more than made up on staying, even after having his life threatened, and he made it clear to the group that we were all staying where we were. We all argued with him, told him he was crazy – and things were quickly getting out of hand... 

But that’s when Angela took control... Once everyone had shut the f**k up, she then berated all of us... She said that none of us were prepared to come here and that we had no idea what we were doing... She was right - we didn’t... She then said that all of us are going back home, no questions asked – like she was giving us an order... and if Moses wanted to stay, he could – but he would more than likely die alone... Moses said he was willing to die here – to be a martyr to the cause or some s**t like that... But by the time it got dark, we all agreed that in the morning, we were all going back down river and back to Kinshasa...  

Despite being completely freaked out that day, I did manage to get some sleep... I knew we had a long journey back ahead of us, and even though I was scared of what I might dream, I slept anyway... and there I was... back at the fence... I moved through it – through to the other side. Darkness and identical trees all around... and then I came onto something... Again, I came onto a tree – just a normal tree... but its trunk was big... really big – like wide... I could hear breathing coming from it... Soft, but painful breathing like someone was suffocating... I then came across something by the tree – I mean, on it – on the tree... It was a man... he was small – very small, like a child... He was breathing very soft but painful breathes. His head was down so I couldn’t see his face... but what jilted me was the rest of him... This man – this... child-like man... he was crucified to the tree! A nail in each hand – stretching him out - bleeding! He looked like a cross... His hands were not the only things bleeding... He was bleeding from in between his legs... He’d had his balls cut off!... All I can do is look on in horror, unable to wake myself up – but then the man looks up to me... very slowly... he looks up to me and I can make out his features... His face is covered all over in scars – tribal scares: waves, dots, spirals... His cheeks are very sunken in, he looks almost like an alien... and he opens his eyes with the little strength he had and he looks straight at me... He says – or... more whispers... ’Henri’... He knew my name... 

That’s when I wake back in my tent. Panicked to hell... and sweating all over... My breathing finally begins to calm down so I don’t wake Naadia beside me... but that’s when I start to hear a zipping noise... a very slow zip, like someone was trying carefully to break into the tent... I look to the entrance zip-door but it’s too dark to see anything... It didn’t matter anyway – because I realized the zipping noise was coming from behind me... and what I first thought was zipping... was actually cutting... Someone was cutting their way through mine and Naadia’s tent...  Every night that we were there, I slept with a pocket-knife inside my sleeping bag. I reach around to find it so I can protect myself from whoever’s entering... Trying not to make a sound, I think I find it, I better adjust it in my hand when I... when I feel a blunt force hit me in the head... Not that I could see anything anyway... but everything suddenly went black... 

When I finally regain consciousness, everything around me is still dark... My head hurts like hell and I feel like vomiting... But what was strange was that I felt as though I was floating, and I could barely feel anything underneath me... and that’s when I realized... I was being carried... and the darkness around me was coming from whatever was over my head – like an old smelly sack or something... I tried moving my arms and legs but I couldn’t - they were tied! I tried calling out for help, but I couldn’t do that either. My mouth was gagged!... I continued to be carried for a good while longer before suddenly I feel myself fall. I hit the ground very hard which made my head even worse... I then feel someone come behind me, pulling me up on my knees... I can hear some unknown language being spoken around me and what sounded like people crying... I start to hyperventilate and I fear I might suffocate inside whatever this thing was over my head... 

That’s when a blinding bright light comes over me, hurts my brain and my eyes - and I realize the bag or sack over my head has been taken off... I try painfully to readjust my eyes so I can see where I am, and when I do... a small-childlike man is standing over me... The same man from the day before, who Moses tried giving the fish too... The only difference now was that he was shirtless... and painted all over in some kind of grey paste! I then see beside him are even more of the smaller men – also covered in grey paste... The contrast of the paste with their dark skin made them look like skeletons! I then hear the crying again. I look to either side of me and I see all the other commune members: Moses, Jerome, Beth, Tye, Chantal, Angela and Naadia... All on their knees, gagged with their hands tied behind their back... The short grey men, standing over us then move away behind us, and we realize where it is they’ve taken us... They’ve taken us back to the fence!... I can hear the muffled moans of everyone else as they realize where we are, and we all must have had the exact same thought... What is going to happen?... The leader of the grey men then yells out an order in his language, in which the others then raise all of us to our feet, holding their machetes to the back of our necks... I look over to see Naadia crying – she looks terrified. She just stares ahead at the fly-infested fence, assuming... We all did...  

A handful of the grey men in front us are now opening up a loose part of the fence, like two gate doors. On the other side, through the gap of the fence, all I can see is darkness... The leader again gives out an order, and next thing I know, most of the commune members are being shoved, forced forward into the gap of the fence to the other side! I can hear Beth, Chantal and Naadia crying. Moses, through the gag in his mouth, he pleads to them ‘Please! Please stop!’... As I’m watching what I think is kidnapping – or worse, murder happen right in front of me... I realize that the only ones not being shoved through to the other side were me and Angela... Tye is the last to be moved through - but then the leader tells the others to stop... He stares at Tye for a good while, before ordering his men not to push him through – instead to move him back next to the two of us... Stood side by side and with our hands tied behind us, all the three of us can do is watch on as the rest of the commune vanish over the other side of the fence... one by one... The last thing I see is Naadia looking back at me – begging me to help her... but there’s nothing I can do... I can’t save her... and the darkness on the other side just seems to swallow them...  

I try searching through the trees and darkness to find Naadia but I don’t see her! I don’t see any of them. I can’t even hear them! It was as though they weren’t there anymore – that they were somewhere else!... The leader then comes back in front of me. He stares up to me and I realize he’s holding a knife... I look to Angela and Tye, as though I’m asking them to help me, but they were just as helpless as I was... I can feel the leader of the grey men staring through me, as though through my soul... and then I see as he lifts his knife higher – as high as my throat... Thinking this is going to be the end, I cry uncontrollably, just begging him not to kill me... The leader looks confused as I try and muffle out the words, and just as I think my throat is going to be slashed... he cuts loose the gag tied around my mouth – drawing blood... I look down to him – confused... before I’m turned around, and he cuts my hands free from my back... I now see the other grey men are doing the same for Tye and Angela – to our confusion... 

I stare back down to the leader, and he looks at me... and not knowing if we were safe now or if the worst was still yet to come... I put my palms together as though I’m about to pray and I start begging him – before he yells ‘SHUT UP! SHUT UP!’ - this time raising the knife to my throat... He looks at me with wide eyes, as though he’s asking me ‘Are you going to be quiet?’ I nod yes and there’s a long pause all around... and the leader says, in plain English: ‘YOU GO BACK! YOUR FRIENDS GONE NOW! THEY DEAD! YOU NO RETURN HERE! GO!’... He shoves me backwards, telling me to go. The other men push Tye and Angela forward with their spears, in the opposite direction of the fence... The three of us now make our way away from the men, still yelling at us to leave, where again, we hear the familiar word of ‘ASILI! ASILI!’... but most of all... we were making our way away from the fence - and whatever danger or evil that we didn’t know was lurking on the other side... The other side... where the others now were...  

If you’re wondering why the three of us were spared from going in there... we only came up with one theory... Me and Angela were white, and so if we were to go missing, there would be more chance of authorities coming to look for us... I know that’s not good to say - but it’s probably true... As for Tye, he was mixed-race... and so maybe they thought one white parent was enough to make the authorities come looking...  

The three of us went back to our empty commune – to collect our things and get the hell out of this place we never should have come to... Angela said the plan was to make our way back to the river, flag down a boat and get a ride back down to Kinshasa. Tye didn’t agree with this plan... He said as long as his friends were still here, he wasn’t going anywhere. Angela said that was stupid and the only way we could help them was to contact the authorities as soon as possible. To Tye’s and my own surprise... I agreed with him... I said the only reason I came here was to make sure Naadia didn’t get into any trouble, and if I left her in there with God knows what, this entire trip would have been for nothing... and so I suggested that our next plan of action was to find a way through the other side of the fence so we could look for the rest of the commune... It was obvious that me and Tye hated each other, which at the time, seemed to be for no good reason - but for the first time... he looked at me with respect... We both made it perfectly clear to Angela that we were staying to look for the others...  

Angela said we were both dumb f**k’s and were gonna get ourselves killed... I couldn’t help but agree with her... Staying in this jungle any longer than we needed to was the same as staying in a house once you know it’s haunted... But I couldn’t help it... I had to go to the other side... not because I felt responsible for Naadia – that I had an obligation to go and save her... but because I had to know what was there... What was in there, hiding amongst the darkness of the jungle??... I was afraid – beyond terrified actually - but something in there was calling me... and for some reason, I just had to find out what it was!... I felt like a junkie that was dying to get out of rehab – but I wanted in!... Not knowing what mystery lurked behind that fence was making me want to rip off my own face... peel by peel... 

Angela went silent for a while... You could clearly tell she wanted to leave us here and save her own skin... but by leaving us here, she knew she would be leaving us to die... Neither me nor Tye knew anything about the jungle – let alone how to look for people missing in it... Angela groaned and then said ‘...F**k it’. She was going with us... and so we planned on how we were going to get over the other side of the jungle without detection... We eventually realized we just had to risk it. We had to find a part of the fence, hack our way through and then just enter it... and that’s what we did... Angela, with a machete she bought at Mbandaka, hacked her way through two different parts, creating a loose gate of sought's... When she was done, she gave the go ahead for me and Tye to tug the loose piece of fence away with a long piece of rope...  

We now had our entranceway... All three of us stared into the dark space between the fence, which might as well have been an entrance to hell... Each of us took a deep breath... and before we dare to go in, Angela turns to say to us... ‘Remember... You guys asked for this...’ None of us really wanted to go inside there – not really... We probably knew we wouldn’t get out alive... I had my secret reason... and Tye had his... We each grabbed each other by the hand – as though we thought we might easily get lost from each other... and with a final anxious breath, Angela lead the way through... through the gap in the fence... through the first leaves, branches and bush... through to the other side... and finally into the darkness... like someone’s eyes when they fall asleep... not knowing when or if they’ll wake up... 

This is where I have to stop... I... I can't go on any further... I thought I could when I started this bu-... no... This is all I can say... for now anyway... What really happened to us in there... I... I don’t know if I can even put it into words... All I can say is that... what happened to us already... it was nothing compared to what we would eventually go through... What we found... Even if I told you what happens next, you wouldn’t believe me... but you would also wish I never had... There’s still a part of me now that thinks it might not have been real... For the sake of my soul... for the things I was made to do in there... I really hope this is just one big nightmare... even if the nightmare never ends... just please don’t let it be real... 

In case I never finish this story – in case I’m not alive to tell it... I’ll leave you with this... I googled the word ‘Asili’ a year ago - trying to find what it meant... It’s a Swahili word... it means...  

The Beginning...
