I recently moved back home to the country side, I've been having financial issues after visiting the doctor so much so regrettably I moved back in with my parents. A nice house built back in the 1920s and improved upon ever since, which sits at the front of the woods that went down hill. I loved exploring it as a kid but only ever in the daylight and only about half a mile in, I always got scared if I couldn't see the house.

You have so many good memories of a place you don't really remember the bad parts, for every party we had you eventually forget when a bat got into your room one night, for each deck you help build you forget that the room you slept in was essentially an attic, where everyone didn't mind if a mouse, rat, squirrel, or mentioned bat sneaks in and all you can do is listen to the squeaks as you try to sleep.

Those memories have been flooding my mind lately, finally moved into my old bedroom after living in a city and you start to miss the constant police sirens, it's weird and sad to see both negatives and remember that the positives are in the past.

A few nights ago I took my medication and lied in bed and as I'm about to fall asleep, listening to the old house rest before I hear a thump on the window. We had a oak tree, older than myself that reached the attic window, but the branches only ever made a brushing noise as the leaves grazed the glass.

As I sit in the dark it happened again, a simple thump, like dirt or a snowball hitting it. My curiosity was peaked and I stood up to look out the window where I just saw a little squirrel, holding onto a nut. It was hard to see but luckily we had a light connected to the garage so I could barely make it out. It sat there looking like it was going to throw the nut but I just shrugged, why would a squirrel waste food? But as I was about to talk away, thump.

"Just let me sleep." I groaned as I go back to the window tapping on it a bunch to hopefully scare it away and get some sleep.

"Go into the woods" my finger tapped the window one more time before I went silent, that was a person's voice, a calm but demanding tone that made you listen even if you didn't want to. I kept quiet, listening downstairs to see if someone woke up and needed me, but as I look away from the glass, thump.

"Go into the woods" it repeated, my heart racing as I heard no one downstairs and so I look to the only visitor I had.

"I'm not going crazy am I?" I said to myself looking at the squirrel before it shook it's head. No no it has to just be a terrible dream, I just went back to bed the thumping continued eventually sounding like pebbles but thanks to living near the railroad I was able to sleep through it.

The next day I woke up, taking my medication before joining my parents downstairs for breakfast. Should I question how I fell asleep in a dream? Maybe but the alternative was much scarier. I didn't mention anything hoping to fool myself with it being just a simple nightmare.

I walk to the edge of the woods, just as winter is approaching everything looked dreary, no sun shining, dead leaves on the ground, all trees being either grey or white tied it all together, winter sure is depressing.

I chuckle, pushing my dark humour to the side before I coughed, my chuckling stifled as I see a squirrel in a tree. It wasn't surprising to see, but it was making some sort of hand gesture with it's paws. It stood on it's hind legs and kept using the gesture come here or follow me as it looked at me.

My body was tense, fight or flight trying to figure out what to do before my golden retriever, Toby started barking at the squirrel and it ran off. With Toby by my side as well it was comforting, I grabbed him by his collar and held him back from chasing the squirrel.

"He isn't worth it buddy, let's go play huh?" I asked Toby in that puppy dog talk that everyone does, he barks a few more time with excitement before I trust to let go and he runs to get his beloved Frisbee and the day carried on till it started getting dark.

It was nine o'clock much earlier than last night the thumping started again, but I took deep breaths and put my headphones on and just played my games, plus Toby was sleeping on my bed and like the big fur ball he is, It felt fine to ignore it. Maybe it wasn't a nightmare but what could a squirrel do?

Not long after I hear Toby barking, I look over and he's barking at the window, my parents from downstairs yelling at him to shut up. He dashed downstairs and continued to bark and I took my headphones off I listened downstairs.

"Dumbass, need to take a shit or something?" My dad said going to the door and the tumbling of a large dog could be heard, I look out the window the squirrel wasn't there but I could see Toby running into the woods at full speed.

My heart dropped, he's going to be fine right? Toby was big some people called him a blonde bear cub so what could some squirrel do to him?! I bit my lip trying not to let my thoughts run, minutes felt like seconds but just like that I heard the door open and the big floppy steps of Toby came in and the house shook as he pooped down on the wooden floors downstairs.

I continue with my night, gaming till midnight, everyone else asleep as I take my medication not even glancing at the window as the thumping continued. I laid in bed about to put some earbuds in before I listened again.

Thump thump, pause, thump thump. Was there another squirrel outside now? I guess the branch was big enough but why are two of them doing it now? I wish I could answer these questions but more sounds started happening.

A light scratching from inside the walls, a mouse I guessed and with a quick knock on the wall making it stopped I was more than certain it was a mouse.

Thump thump, scratch, thump thump was the next hour the only other noise I heard was my heart pounding in my chest, to scared to get up or interrupt the orchestra but the   symphony only grew. Thump thump , scratch scratch, squeak squeak. 

My room sounded like a tree ready to die from the creatures infesting it. Ten minutes of it I couldn't handle it before I sat up.

"Toby!" I didn't care to wake my parents I needed Toby, I needed someone to make it seem like everything would be alright. As the words left my mouth, the noises stopped. I could hear the dog grown from being awoken and slowly climb up the stairs, and ocean of relief flowed through my body as I started to pet Toby.

"Oh buddy you deserve so many treats, I don't know how to repay ya lump of fur."

"Go into the woods."

I pushed him to the stairs making sure he walked down before I sat at my bed, the thumping began again and all I could think to do was go to my computer and stay up all night, trying to not look at the window but more importantly make sure Toby didn't come back up.

And that's where I sit now writing this, it's been three days, I haven't slept, I only go downstairs if Toby is outside and even then I don't feel safe. I tried to explain to anyone else that would listen but anytime I have someone else upstairs it's silent... Whatever is going on it wants me, and what if I just leave would it go after my parents? I don't want to know. The noises are starting again, should I listen to the animals?
