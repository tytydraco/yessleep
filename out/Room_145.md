Being a nurse is not easy. 

Being a triage nurse is even harder. 

Hi, my name is Diane. There’s no real reason for you to know my name, but maybe it will make me feel less alone to know I’m being heard, and that people are reading my story with a name attached to it. 

All of this story is true. I won’t embellish or try to make it scarier. Sometimes real life is scarier than fiction, I think. Don’t you?

Before I get into this story, let me explain what my job is. I work as a nurse for emergency situations. If someone comes in by ambulance, I’m the nurse there. Let’s just say- if it’s an emergency, life or death- real emergency, I’m the nurse there. 

This story takes place on a very quiet early evening, no dark and stormy cliches. It was actually a beautiful day in the Midwest… humid, a beautiful sunset just beginning to descend, and I was feeling unusually afraid. 
I’ve seen it all. That’s no exaggeration. Gore and blood and suffering sadly doesn’t faze me. If you worked as long as I have in this profession, it wouldn’t faze you either. 
Why was I afraid? Who knows. Maybe it was the fourth cup of black coffee I had just downed. Maybe it was the stillness - it was a very slow night. I roamed the hallways, looking at the cold hospital beds that were previously occupied by human beings in the last five hours, now stripped off and wiped down, the last people who had laid on them downstairs with a toe tag on. Just a number.  Just a cold body. How could it be that I had just been talking to them? I guess it did affect me more than I let on. 

As I pondered, I heard a familiar sound. The automatic doors swishing open. The wheels against cold tile. Show time. 

I rush into the room, the new, incredibly young doctor to the right of me, and now on the hospital bed, a woman who must be around 80 years old. I searched her with my eyes, taking in the delicate skin, the floral nightgown, the perfectly curled white hair. Just like my grandma. I immediately felt a softness towards her, but also a feeling that I can’t quite explain still to this day. The only word I can think of, is dread. 

Heart attack. Very common. I’ll never forget her looking into my eyes as we tried to save her. 
Hundreds of poor souls had looked me in the eyes before the flatline. Usually they had a look of fear, or peace, or sadness. This woman looked at me with pure hatred. 
In all my years, it was the first time I had ever seen that look. The dread came back.  
We couldn’t save her. Too old, too frail, too worn. I’ve seen that before. 

Our new young doctor was shaken, this was his first death. His first time hearing the ominous hum of a flatline. God love him, he tried to bring her back like a little boy trying to wake his parent up after a nap. He tried for so long. 
I touched his shoulder gently, and met his eyes, and he understood. She had been gone for almost 15 minutes. 

We start unhooking her from the machines. Writing her time of death. I think Young Doctor teared up at the process. I went through it like I was doing laundry. The process was almost second nature. 

Here comes the part I will never forget, as long as I live. Our patient had been dead for almost 15 minutes at this point. Suddenly she sits upright on that damn hospital bed, gripping the sheet with both her wrinkled, manicured hands. We immediately shot into action. This is something I’ve never seen before, but I guess nothing is impossible. Except that she had no pulse. She had no activity in her heart. She was colder than any corpse I had ever touched. 

She turned her head towards me slowly, with the same hate I saw before, but beyond her unfocused clouded blue eyes was something more like pure fear. Her paper thin lips opened, and she screamed. Guttural and primal, a scream that made other nurses and one other doctor run to the room. Room 145. 

The scream ended, but my head was spinning. This woman is dead. She’s dead. Could it be a reflex of the body? Escaping of gas? No. I would’ve seen this before, right? Am I dreaming? I must be. 

Her eyes rolled in the sockets. We were frozen in fear. I think I squeezed the arm of a nearby nurse, or maybe she was squeezing me. 

From the paper thin lips of the woman in the floral nightgown, came nine words that none of us will ever forget. 

In a voice too deep, and too dark to be human, she yelled to the top of her lungs, 

“I’ve been to Hell, and I don’t like it”
Then, she laid back down. No pulse. No activity. Just like before. Eyes open and still rolling. 

It took three nurses, including me, to pry her manicured hands from the bedsheet.  

All I can say is, this story is true. She was dead. Sometimes, out of my peripheral vision, I still see an old woman in a floral nightgown, mouth opened impossibly wide, eyes rolling from side to side, and I pray. 

I pray.
