If you have noticed a streetlamp in your town change from yellow to purple, stay away from its light. Don’t look into it, and above all else, don’t stand under it. If you see anyone standing under the purple light, avoid them. 

They starting changing around my neighborhood a few weeks ago. Our old streetlamps were starting to dim, so city officials had installed new lamps all across town. Right away, it was easy to see the improvement. The new lights were much brighter, and their brilliant yellow made a huge difference at night.

My hometown is pretty small and sleepy, so we don’t have much light pollution. That’s probably a good thing, but outside the lamplight, the world is pitch black at night.

Soon after the new lights went up, my friend Taylor visited from the city. We were up later than we realized, and she had to be at work the next day, so we rushed to the nearest bus stop hoping she hadn’t missed the last ride out. There was one stop on the edge of town, under a single yellow streetlight.

Our town didn’t have many restaurants open late, so we had spent most of the evening at a hole-in-the-wall pizza place. The junk food had caught up with Taylor while we sat at the bus stop, so I offered to run down the street to the gas station to grab some reflux relief.

I left her at the bus stop. I wish I hadn’t. Just once, before I had gone too far, I looked back. There she was, looking a little uncomfortable on the cold metal bench under the warm light.

Then the streetlight changed. It was sudden, like the flip of a switch. The warm yellow glow was gone, and Taylor was bathed in a deep, cold purple. I remember she looked up into the light as if there would be an explanation there.

I turned back to the gas station without a second thought. I ran in to find something to settle her stomach. It didn’t take long, but by the time I stepped out again, Taylor was gone.

I texted her “hope you feel better,” and left for home. As I walked by the bus stop, the streetlamp gave off a loud, aggressive drone, like someone had just rattled the world’s largest hornet’s nest.

\*\*\*

I was a little surprised to see Taylor hadn’t texted me by the next morning. She usually messages me to say she got home safe. I tried calling, but I didn’t get an answer.

The uncertainty weighed on me. I felt like a bad friend for not seeing her off. Guilty voices started chattering in my head. *If I had a car, I could have driven her home*. *If I were a good friend, I could have gone to see her instead. So what if her roommate doesn’t like company*?

I was starting to fear the worst, so I checked the morning news hoping I wouldn’t see anything about her bus.

There was nothing like that, though. The worst thing the morning crew had to share was something about a group of kids who didn’t come home from the park a few nights earlier.

As the day went on, I tried calling Taylor again and again. I didn’t want to appear crazy if everything turned out to be alright, but I was worried. I shouldn’t have left her at the bus top.

That evening, Taylor’s roommate called me.

“Is Taylor still there?” she asked.

“No,” I answered. “Have you heard from her at all?”

“Not since she left for your place.”

“I haven’t seen her since last night,” I said.

“I don’t know what to do,” she said. “I guess I’ll call her family.”

I asked Taylor’s roommate to keep me in the loop. I could hear in her voice that she was as scared as I was.

The sun had set while we were talking, and I watched from my window as my neighborhood slowly shut its eyes for the night. The last of the garage doors closed as people filtered home from work. Kids crossed their lawns and left their bikes in the grass.

The last full colors of the day drained into gray and then black, and then the lights came on all along the street. Bold cones of yellow stood alone in the dark, and then down at the end of the road, a streetlamp turned purple, as if to wink.

\*\*\*

The next day, I decided to return to the bus stop to look around. I didn’t know what I would find, but if something had gone wrong, maybe there’d be some sign of trouble.

I’m no detective. I never really watched all those crime forensics shows, so I didn’t know what to look for. I scoured the grass behind the bus stop, looked for scuffs on the concrete, bloodstains, hair, anything. I was there late into the afternoon, until finally the streetlight came on again.

It was warm yellow.

That’s not how I remembered it, so I went back to the gas station to ask about the lights outside.

“The city came by this morning to replace it,” the cashier said. “The purple was an eyesore.”

That didn’t really help me out, so I started to walk back home. As I approached the bus stop, the streetlight flickered out and returned a deep violet. I stopped, standing just outside the cone of light. It strained my eyes just to see it, like nothing within the light was fully defined.

But there on the ground, just within the purple light, I saw Taylor’s bus pass. My heart sank as I tried not to think of what could have happened out here. I knelt down to pick it up.

As my hand crossed the purple light, I felt my movement slow, like trying to swing a fist underwater. A prickling static climbed up my arm. Then I looked down to the concrete.

My shadow was reaching up for me. I panicked and fell backwards out of the light. The tingling in my arm ceased. High up in the air, the light started to hum, louder and louder as it did the night Taylor disappeared. I scrambled to my feet and ran home in the dark.

It was the dead of night when I reached my street. It didn’t look like anything was chasing me, but I had hurried all the way. As I reached the sidewalk, I slowed to catch my breath. My home was within reach, and the path was marked with welcoming yellow lights.

Just as I passed under the first lamp, it went black. I stood still like a prey animal who just spotted eyes in the brush, listening out for anything other than my own exhausted breath.

Then the light switched on.

In the stark purple glow, Taylor’s face glared back at me. The lamp cast deep shadows over her face, like the dark recesses of a skull, and then I realized she was barely more than a shadow herself. She stretched two dark and trembling arms out to me, and I could sense a crackling static climbing up my legs. The shadows were closing in.

It was like moving through quicksand, but I forced my way out of the purple light. I looked back to see my own shadow, halfway risen from the ground, collapse back into a pool of itself.

I ran through the dark street, each streetlamp switching colors as I passed. Taylor’s shadow stood under each one, just at the edge of the light. The vicious drone of the lamps was raging all around me. I crossed the final driveway, opened my door, and slammed it shut behind me.

I tried to tell Taylor’s roommate what happened, but she hasn’t answered her phone in days. I’m afraid to look into what’s going on, but I think everyone should know that the light is no safer than the dark.

Now, I always make sure I’m home by the time the streetlights come on.
