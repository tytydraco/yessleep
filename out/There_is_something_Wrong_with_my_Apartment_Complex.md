A mere couple of months ago, the resolute decision to transplant my life to the heart of New York City was made. Coming from the outskirts of Sacramento, this move was nothing short of a seismic shift for me. Every aspect of my life was poised for a complete overhaul - a new vocation, unfamiliar faces, and an entirely fresh world to navigate. The prospect filled me with an exuberance that knew no bounds. Graciously, my aunt, a resident of New Jersey, extended an invitation to stay with her until I could get my own place in the city.

Once I got settled at my aunt's place I immediately began looking for apartments in the city. My family of course didn't come from a-lot of money and my job didn't pay me enough to the point where I could live anywhere in the city, so I had to be open to wherever I could find a place. After a couple of days of looking, a new listing appeared for a great deal. It was located in a good part of the city and seemed to be in good condition. They only had private open houses so I called and set up with the realtor. She told me that they wouldn’t have an open house appointment until some time next week. I told her it was completely fine and there was no rush. 

After around a week the open house had rolled around and we were visiting the apartment. When we got to the building it looked like any other Manhattan apartment building. I expected to see something much more ragged and old considering the incredible price that it was listed at. The neighborhood was nice and clean which was a big deal for me as well. As I was walking towards the entrance I could see from the corner of my eye someone peering down from the window up above. I tried to peek a look at them, however they disappeared from view before I could get a look. 

Probably just neighbors concerned with who might be coming in. The realtor showed me around the apartment and to my surprise it was really fixed up. Brand new flooring, great paint jobs and new windows. The apartment was clean and new. The realtor however told me that the apartment had been put for so cheap due to renovations that were going on at the time. That anything above the 4th floor was empty due to new renovations. 

Noise would be going on constantly and construction workers would be in and out. However the 4th floor was almost done so noise should not be a problem. She also said the neighbors were very quiet and private, which of course was great for me. I looked around a little longer and couldn’t help but fall in love with the place. I told her that I would love to have it, but she told me that many others were interested as well, so she would give me a call back to let me know. On my way out I couldn’t help but feel like I was being watched again. I turned around this time quicker than before , but saw no one there. I called myself crazy and headed home. 

Around a week later the realtor's voice rang through the phone and told me that I had gotten the apartment. I couldn't help but scream in joy and jump up and down like a child. I was unbelievably thrilled and filled to the top of my head with joy. I was finally going to live in Manhattan, a dream I have had since I was a little girl. I hugged my aunt in joy and jumped up and down for as long as I could remember. 

After some time of doing paperwork and packing my things up it was time to move in. I had only 2 luggages with me containing only things I really needed. I wanted to buy new clothes here and really change up my style. I wanted to try something new and exciting. However I needed to take this one step at a time, so for now baggy sweatpants and hoodies will do. I said my goodbyes to my aunt and uncle as I thanked them for allowing me to stay with them. I couldn’t be more grateful because without them no one this would have happened. 

The realtor was already there at the requested time to hand me my key and be on her way. As I arrived I noticed a lot of construction going on. Workers and equipment filled the lobby area. I dodged through it as I attempted to drag my stuff upstairs. I struggled due to the tight design of the stairs. This place didn’t have an elevator which absolutely sucked for me. However as I attempted to go up I heard a voice call out 
“Need some help? These stairs can be a pain in the ass to get up.” 
It was a middle aged man white and decent looking to be honest. He stood around 5 '9 with a lean frame, introduced himself, "I'm Marcus."

"Haley," I replied.

"Just moving in?" Marcus inquired.

"Yeah, I got really lucky with the price here," I shared.

"Me too. The construction isn't too bothersome for me, and they're usually gone by the time I get home anyway."

"What time do they usually wrap up?" I asked.

"Around 6, I think."

"Great, so they shouldn't be here when I get back either."

We continued our ascent up the stairs, finally reaching the third floor. I was winded and couldn't help but lean against my door.

Marcus reassured me, "Trust me, it gets easier once you're going up and down every day, sometimes even two or three times."

"I hope so," I admitted.

I pulled out my key as Marcus exclaimed, "No way, you're in 203?"

"Yeah, why?" I inquired.

"I live right across in 204. Isn't that something?" Marcus said, with a chuckle.

"It is. Well, it was great to meet you, Marcus. And thank you for helping me up too."

"Anytime," he said, a warm grin on his face.

I found my key in my pocket, swiftly unlocking my door. As Marcus made his way towards the staircase downstairs, he called out, "Have a good one, Haley!"

"You too!" I called back.

So far this place didn’t seem too bad. At Least not yet. 

After a couple of normal weeks of settling and getting comfortable I began to go out more with friends from work to meet new people. I couldn’t explain how excited I was to explore the city and meet new people. It was a breath of fresh air and I wanted more. One night me and my friends went out to a restaurant just a couple of blocks from my apartment. It was a small, but neat little Italian restaurant. Brick wall surrounded us and every table had that red and white italian table cover on it. The walls were covered in beautiful paintings from all over. It was a splendid night. My friends invited some of their friends and it was nothing short of a good time. My friends walked me back to my apartment since they lived nearby. They wanted to make sure I got home safe, especially after a heavy night of drinking. They walked me up the stairs and I thanked them for being so great. 

I got inside and layed my bag on top of my bed. Locking my door with both the chain and normal lock. Then I started going for the fridge and an ice cold glass of water. I downed it rapidly and couldn’t help but feel incredible after. Nothing like downing an ice cold glass of water after a tiring night out. I started to prepare for a shower before bed. I hopped in planning on just a quick cleanse to make myself feel cleaner before i layed down. As I was washing my hair I couldn't help but hear scuffles and noise from outside. I couldn’t tell If it was coming from outside our downstairs users , no clue. 

One thing I didn’t mention was my neighbors were very to themselves. Whenever I got up I basically saw either construction workers or someone random. I couldn’t tell who lived where or did what. Then again this was New York, most people didn’t care about anybody else and couldn’t give less of a shit about their neighbors. Going back to the noise I couldn’t make it out. The noise from the shower blocked it out. I was too tired and drunk to care about it, so I continued on. After my shower I got ready for bed, turning off all the lights in the room and closing all the windows. But as I reached for the final light switch, my gaze snagged on the chain hanging from the door. I stood there, caught in a disorienting swirl of thoughts, vividly recalling how I had secured the chain earlier.The noise and the door both correspond together, but I was too drunk for this I thought. My alcohol was getting to me. 

“The fuck am I doing?” I said 

I grabbed the chain and pushed it back in. Turned off the light and went to bed.  

A week later I was getting ready to head out again. This time I actually left out my sleeping clothes so when I got home I could just shower and get straight into bed. Same as always I got buzzed and my friends walked me home.I entered my apartment, my body heavy with weariness, every step a weighted effort. As my feet met the familiar floor, a surge of adrenaline shot through me, banishing fatigue for a moment. I turned to where I had carefully laid out my clothes, only to find them gone. Panic fluttered in my chest, like a trapped bird, as I scoured the room.

I scrutinized every corner, my eyes darting from the bed to the kitchen, then sweeping across the bathroom. The space seemed to close in on me, each detail magnified under the harsh glare of the lights. The soft hum of the refrigerator seemed to fill the room, a stark contrast to the frantic rhythm of my heart.
My voice came out in a hushed mantra, “No, no, no... What the hell!” Frustration and anxiety knotted my fingers into trembling fists. I pushed my hair back from my forehead, my fingers leaving a trail of moisture from my clammy skin. Every breath was heavy , and each beat of my heart seemed to bang against my hollow chest.

For a couple of weeks the weird shit had stopped and I had stopped going out and just stayed home. Maybe it was all the drinking and going out that was causing this anxiety and weird shit to happen. One night I had a company Christmas party, so of course I had to go. I was looking forward to it since I hadn't gone out in a while. I dressed up nice and headed out early. I just got off my train to head to the party when I felt like I was being followed. I’m not one to be paranoid or have anxiety, but I have a tendency for these things. As a shiver of unease prickled my neck, I couldn't shake the sensation of being pursued. With a quick glance over my shoulder, my eyes caught a glimpse of a figure trailing in the distance. They seemed distant, but that didn't make me feel any better.

In response, I quickened my pace, each step a hurried movement. The city stretched out before me, the familiarity of the streets now tinged with an unfamiliar chill. My heart raced in my chest, a steady drum banging against my chest.
The destination was just a few blocks away. Yet, I dared not look back again, fearing what I might find. Every passing second felt like an eternity, the silence of the night amplifying the pounding of my heart. I kept going until I could feel the presence of more people around. Then I looked back and they were just standing there. A dark figure in a black mask just standing there. Not moving at all. I went inside the party and I headed straight for the bar because I needed a damn drink. The night of course was fun and laid back mainly. It was nice to get out again after all of the awful stuff that has been going on. As soon as I got home I needed a glass of water from all the walking I endured. 

As I swung open the cupboard door, my fingers wrapped around the cool whiskey glass, ready to quench my thirst. But then, an abrupt halt. Time seemed to halt along with me. Every muscle tensed, my senses on high alert. The glass in my hand trembled, mirroring the seismic unease rumbling within me. A tiny smudge of moisture glistened against its surface, a barely perceptible hint of dampness that sent a jolt of electricity through my veins. Without warning, the glass slipped from my grip, meeting the floor with a shattering crash. The sound hung in the air,  like a gunshot. 

"NO, NO, NO," I cried, tears streaming down my face in disbelief. Was I losing my mind? The glass could only be wet if it had been washed recently .
KNOCK KNOCK
"Are you okay in there?" Marcus's voice called from outside. Trusting him, or anyone in this building, was becoming increasingly difficult.
"I'm fine! I've got it under control," I replied, my voice shaky.
"Just dropped something," Marcus offered.
There was no further response.

I cleaned up the mess I had made and pulled myself together. I had to figure out what the fuck was happening. Was I really insane? I couldn’t go to the cops with this story. They would call me crazy or do nothing at all. I planned to talk to the landlord soon. 
A couple of days later while watching TV in my apartment I saw Marcus arriving. I had never seen the inside of his apartment. It faced the back of the building so light never really went in. It was always pitch dark in there from wherever I saw him go in. However one night while grabbing the mail I noticed Marcus had a ton of excess mail just sitting there. Maybe he forgot to grab it. Usually he would give me mine so I wanted to return the favor. I grabbed his stack and took it up. About to slide it under I realized it was too much to slide under. I could do it one by one,but that would be messy and ugly. Then I wondered if his apartment was open. 

Maybe I could leave it in there just on his counter. No, that was a dumbass idea. But I did want to see his room. I had never seen his apartment before. Rarely ever saw him even go inside it to be honest. I looked around to see if anyone was watching and concluded I was in the clear. I twisted it and of course it was locked .So I left the mail infront of his door. I only saw him enter it one more time after that. Of course I saw nothing but darkness when he did. The Little peephole I had didn't help either. But one day again when grabbing the mail I decided to try again. I’m not one to be nosey, but I truly had no idea what his apartment looked like. I just couldn’t help my curiosity. I looked around once again and was clear. I grabbed onto the handle and twisted it open. It was unlocked. I was actually surprised. Who leaves their door open in New York? I peered in slowly and used my hand to look for a light switch. I waved my hand around, but nothing. 

Finally I felt a switch and flipped it up. A bright white blinding light illuminated the room. I hadn't even opened the door full yet. Then I did. The chill seeped into my bones, sending tremors through my frame. My breaths came in shallow gasps, struggling to keep pace with the sudden, suffocating reality. I felt like throwing up ten times over. There were no words to describe it. I put my hands over my mouth to stop any noise. The room was completely empty. No furniture, no decoration, nothing at all. The room looked like it had just been emptied. Marcus had just been here earlier, so there was no way he was moving or renovating. I couldn’t explain anything. I wanted to just cry in a way. I knocked on one of our neighbors doors however no one answered. Matter a fact, I have never seen anyone come in or out of here before. I went down stairs as well knocking on doors, but nothing, no one answered. I had an idea. I needed an answer now. I searched for a construction worker in a panicked voice

"Excuse me, sir. Please, I need your help," I said, desperation creeping into my voice. He regarded me with a mixture of confusion and concern.

"Yes, what can I do for you?"

"I need to know which rooms are currently under renovation in this building."

"Ma'am, I'm sorry, I don't quite follow. Are you referring to the entire building? All the units are vacant except for one on the third floor. We were instructed to prioritize its renovation. As far as I know, you're the only resident here."

A suffocating silence settled over me, squeezing the air from my lungs. My heart pounded, the sound echoing in the empty corridors. The reality was sinking in, and it was a chilling realization. I was alone. Completely and utterly alone in this vast, echoing building.

Questions swirled in my mind like a maelstrom. Who had I been hearing? Who was Marcus? The pieces of this twisted puzzle refused to align, leaving me adrift in a sea of terror and confusion. 

"Have you heard of a resident named Marcus?" I asked, my words coming out in a rush.

"No, I don't believe so. Ma'am, are you alright?" he inquired, genuine concern etched on his face. I turned and hurried back upstairs.

"MAM!"

I packed my stuff I had to leave now. However, I had to know what was going on here. With my deal, my clothes, the glass. Then it hit me. Marcus had a key to the mailbox and the room not because he lives here because he owns the place. That would mean he has a key to every room. I hurried to grab my bags and pack stuff. I immediately ordered an uber out to New Jersey where my aunt was. I hurried as fast as I could. I left certain junk and clothes I had no care for. I never wanted to come back. I grabbed both bags and headed for the door 
The footsteps reverberated through the stairwell, each one a chilling echo of impending dread. I froze, every muscle in my body tensed, as the metallic sounds grew closer.

CLINK
CLANK
CLINK
CLANK

Then, his head emerged from the shadows, a sinister silhouette against the dim light. My breaths came ragged, each exhale a visible puff of panic. I watched, paralyzed, as he slithered into his "apartment."

Minutes felt like an eternity. When the moment finally came, I inched open my door, praying for silence. Each creak of the hinges felt like a thunderclap, threatening to expose my desperate escape.

As I crept out, my heart thundering in my chest, his door swung open with a gut-wrenching creak. 

"Hey, Haley… Where are you headed? Look like your moving out" He said with a chuckle

My heartbeat roared in my ears, drowning out his voice. My words stumbled out, a shaky whisper in the face of terror.

"I-I'm going... visiting friends..."

Sweat drenched me, a chilling testament to my fear. He could undoubtedly see it, an unspoken confirmation of my dread.

"I was just heading out... to a new spot down the street. Are you sure you don't want to try it before you go?"

"I'm sorry, my ride's here. I really have to go."

I pushed forward, but he reached for my arm. Panic surged, and I yanked away.

"It's amazing... I had a meal there just a few days ago. I've even made a reservation for us."

"For us? " 

“Yes Haley for us? You don't see it? You don’t get it… do you” 

Then, his revelation struck me like a bolt of lightning.

"This whole place... it was all for you, you know. Ever since I saw you, I knew you were the one. Even those cute little designs on your pajamas... they're incredible. But you've changed, for the worse. Every night you went out with your friends. I saw you change a little, becoming more like the girls in this city. I couldn't allow you to go out anymore. Ever since I tasted your lips on that whiskey glass. I knew we were meant for each other."

My legs carried me downward, every step a desperate plea for escape. He pursued me, his voice a twisted symphony of madness. 

“Do you not see? THIS WAS ALL FOR YOU! All those other girls that came to see the apartment were all the same. But you.., you were always meant to be here with me. ”   

Tears began falling from my eyes
“You are fucking crazy. Leave me alone” I ran for it going downstairs

Marcus’s voice echoed from up above 

"You're crazy here Haley! They'll never believe you, Haley... HAHAHAHAHA..." 

Tears streamed down my face, uncontainable and desperate. I hurriedly hailed an Uber, my voice choked as I gave my aunt's address.
As I glanced back at the apartment building, a shiver ran down my spine. That same window where I first saw him held something that will haunt my nightmares forever. His smile... It was a grotesque parody of humanity, inhuman and twisted. Words falter in describing its sheer terror. I should have known the first time I saw him through that window something was wrong. That stupid fucking window.
