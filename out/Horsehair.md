I rang the doorbell with a nudge of my elbow, careful not to tip the container of homemade stew too much for fear of spilling it, rendering my journey relatively useless. 

I was there to deliver some homemade food, and play nurse to all three of my sick friends, whose house had apparently been torn through by some unnamed sickness - taking care of some of the chores that had fallen by the wayside; feeding the cat, tidying up a bit.

It had been a week since the first of the three got sick. It was the ever punctual Chelsea, missing a day of school for the first time I could recall since she had Mono in high school. 

"I just feel like shit," she explained when I called her that first day, after she’d missed class. 

“My head hurts, my muscles keep spasming, I'm dizzy."

She sighed for a moment, before adding," Fuck, my hairs been falling out in clumps. And it…it's growing back but it's…it's different. I dunno what I'm saying." 

"You think it's Covid?" I asked, unsure quite how to respond.

She was the med student after all, studying veterinary medicine, in an exclusive program, operating at the top of her class so well that she’d been working some government internship she’d been reluctant to speak about. 

I studied early education, besides suggesting a doctor, a thought I’m sure she’d had on her own, I wasn't sure what else I could say. 

"Dunno, I'd guess so. Whatever it is, I need to shake it before finals week." 

That had been almost two weeks ago. Yet finals week came, and went, and her condition only worsened gradually. Kyla and Tracy followed soon after, and before long it had been days since I’d last seen or spoken to them in person, and almost a week since I’d heard from Chelsea at all.

I wiggled my nose trying to ensure my mask was on, as the chime of the bell echoed from behind the double doors, running over my mental list. 

Drop off food, make sure the cat is fed, hang for a bit and leave before getting yourself sick too. It was a simple enough itinerary. 

Through the stained glass, I could see someone approaching from within, small and huddled beneath what looked to be a thick blanket.

After a few moments, Kyla opened the door, and I struggled to stifle my reaction as I took in my best friend's appearance, changing so drastically over a week.

She looked utterly pallid, her brown skin appearing unusually pale and paper thin, covered in a glistening sheen of sweat in which strands of thin hair stuck. I could see small flecks lining her skin, like blackheads though they weren’t raised, almost as though someone had scattered tiny seeds across her face. Her hair, what of it I could make out from beneath the blanket she wrapped around her like a shawl was coarse and short, and patchy in some places, almost to the scalp. 

It was a stark contrast to how I’d even seen her last, skin glowing and hair in healthy twin braids hanging past her shoulders. I did my best not to relay my shock.

“Hey girl,” I said, injecting perhaps a bit too much artificial cheer into my voice.

Lifting the tupperware I said, “I brought my famous chicken soup.”

“Come in.” She said with a thin smile, before shuddering, her body rocked by a sudden spasm that made her wince.

Her hand rose to her face, running along her skin gingerly as she winced. 

Her smile returned in an instant, but her eyes gleamed for a moment with pain and…*panic*? Unease? There was something in there for a moment, gone as soon as it appeared. 

I frowned beneath my mask, as I stepped inside, feeling both worried for my friend, and hoping beyond hope my N95 would work for whatever this was, assuming it wasn’t just Covid.

A part of me wanted to turn back and leave, to place the food on the entryway table, and say my goodbyes but a greater part of me had missed my friends, and didn’t intend to look like an ass in their collective moment of need.

Whether I wanted to admit it to myself or not, Chelsea’s complete radio silence unnerved me. It wasn’t like her to not even text, and it had been days since she’d given even that courtesy. I had to worry about just how sick she might be.

And besides, I’d only offered to come help with a few things they’d been too exhausted to do in their condition. I could be in and out in an hour or two, and shower vigorously once I returned to my apartment.

I stepped inside past Kyla, kicking my boots off in the loft. The first thing to catch my attention was the temperature, a bone-chilling cool, somehow worse than that outside. 

Quickly, I determined the jacket would be staying on.

“Is your heat broken?” I asked her, unable to keep the shock from my voice.

She shook her head with a humorless laugh, scratching her head roughly for a moment.

“No, we…like it like this. It gets…really hot.” She said, her eyes meeting mine. I stifled a shiver, an odd chill creeping up my back as she did so. There was something in her gaze, an…empty sort of intensity is the only way I can think to explain it, that was very much unlike her. It made me uneasy, in a way I couldn’t quite understand. 

I worried for a moment, just how sick my friends might be.

I nodded, unsure what to say, and continued forward into the house.

As she stepped forward to move in beside me, another sudden shudder seemed to rip through her, making her muscles tense visibly and body jerk violently.

“I’m okay,” she breathed, before I could speak, “Let’s take this to the kitchen.”

I nodded, stepping into the living room from which I could hear the T.V. blaring.

The room was quite a mess, empty and half-empty glasses and mugs littering the place, all filled with water to some extent, plates with unfinished meals, some of which were at least days old sat along any open space on the coffee table or lamp stands.

The air smelled stale, the aromas of faint sweat and sickness filling the room, as dust motes drift lazily through the air illuminated only by the glare of the television. 

I nearly jumped when I saw someone stir on the couch. 

“Tracy?” This time I could hardly contain my surprise at the sight of her.

After a moment Tracy opened her eyes, the lids an unhealthy yellowish tint with the rest of her skin no better off. As she did so, her eyes locked on me for a moment, and in that instance I was taken aback at the sight of a hunger, no, a thirst I had never seen before.

She shot up, for a moment revealing her bare skin in the t-shirt she wore, as she reached for the half-empty glass of water on the coffee table in front of her, in an instance breathing it down, and I felt my stomach turn. 

I stepped away, hardly able to help myself as I saw the skin of her chest, neck and forearms. Small holes seemed to riddle the now exposed skin, almost like massive pores in an effect that would send the worst trypophobe into a panic. 

It was a brief glimpse, but in that moment, I could swear the flesh beneath them…pulsed and moved, as though the very veins beneath were alive.

She quickly threw the blanket she was using as a makeshift shawl back over her, muttering an apology, her body wracked by a familiar shudder. 

“Hey,” she said weekly, smiling weakly at me.

“Is that the famous chicken soup?”

It took me a moment to respond, my mind still lingering on the sight of her skin, already questioning what I thought I’d seen. The image of her flesh seeming shifting beneath those patches riddled with so many holes…it was beginning to feel more corporeal and unlikely. 

I quickly nodded, realizing how my lack of response must have been seen, and determining that it was clear I hadn’t seen correctly. The lights in the living room were off, with only the T.V. and what waning sunlight spilled in through the shuttered blinds to see, and I couldn’t be certain what I had seen at such a brief glimpse, especially to determine it was something so…well, impossible.

“Yeah, I figured you guys probably weren’t feeling all that up to cooking, so,” I lifted the container with a smile.

She grinned, an expression that died before reaching her eyes - sitting up with visible effort, grunting and grimacing as she did so. 

I could see she was gathering herself to stand and greet me, likely with a hug.

My mind flashed back to those images just moments before. Whether I’d seen wrong or not, my stomach turned at the thought.

It feels awful even in retrospect, but the truth was I didn’t want them to touch me. Seeing the condition they were all in, the thought of getting…whatever this was was starting to horrify me, to the point that I was beginning to regret ever coming.

“I’m…gonna go put this down,” I said quickly, stepping away before she could make her way to her feet, and turning towards the kitchen. 

“Sure,” she spoke, voice notably hoarse. “You thirsty? Need water, anything?”

“I’m good.” I said, shooting back a tight-lipped grin, as I made my way into the kitchen.

Kyla trailed a short distance behind, pausing at the table to grab one of the unfinished glasses, and similarly finishing it in an instant.

Stepping into the kitchen, I was greeted by a scene hardly better than the rest of the house. Half-empty plates piled in the sink, meals abandoned in the midst of being made lining the counters as a heavy, mildew-y stench hung heavy the farther into the room I came. And similar to the living room, the presence of half-finished glasses of water appeared a staple of the place now.

I searched from some space, seeking out one of the few open surfaces I could find in the room, and making my way forward to set down the stew beside what usually served as the dining table, and now simply held glass after glass of water, and filthy plates.

As I was setting it down, my hand near a plate atop which a glass, and a myriad of trash had been piled, my skin buzzed with a sudden shock of panic as I felt…something, thin and cold run across the back of my hand. 

I yanked it back, in the process, toppling over one of the glasses and spilling water across the table. I shot up, some of the water spilling back into my lap.

“Fuck.” I spat. I was about to search the kitchen for the paper towels, the roll on the table empty save for a sparse few shred of paper, but before I could my eyes fell on the impromptu puddle on the table, searching for whatever it was I’d felt on my hand.

As I looked, I felt my stomach twist and furl into nauseating knots with snakelike motion, 

At first glance, they’d appeared some odd pattern in the table. I hadn’t looked too closely at first, more focused on the front of my pants now uncomfortably damp, but as I did so I noticed the tiny black lines moving and wriggling spastically through the shallow water.

They were bugs, worms of some sort, and as I looked I realized there weren't just a few, but dozens, maybe hundreds of the disgusting little things, throughout the room, visible in several of the glasses and mugs of room temperature water, floating and twisting lazily. 

I’d hardly noticed on entry, barely glancing in the cups and mugs lining the room, but now peering into each of them, my skin crawled as though the very insects were moving in droves across it, almost each turning up the same.

“Jesus Christ, what the hell are those?” I couldn’t keep the disgust out of my voice, as I looked over the table.

This was more than just a few bugs, it appeared to be a veritable infestation. Just how sick were they to let things get this bad? I knew Chelsea, she was a clean freak by the most generous of estimates, I couldn’t imagine her being okay with such a situation even on her deathbed.

No, something was *deeply* wrong here.

Kyla moved with the most quickness I’d seen from her since I’d arrived, pulling a series of hand towels from a drawer, and throwing them over the table, muttering nervous apologies.

“I’m sorry, I know it’s disgusting. I don’t know what they are, they showed up last week and the damn things have been everywhere.” I watched, skin crawling and stomach turning as I watched Kyla kneel by the table, peering closely at one of the small creatures dangling off the side.

I almost shuddered as she grasped it between her index finger and thumb, raising it for a moment to observe closer. 

“They seem to like water.”

“Jesus Christ, Ky, you’re touching it that’s…” I felt my gut rumble with the distant threat of nausea, mentally cursing my weak stomach as I watched her twist the thing between her fingers. 

I had half a mind to slap it from her hand, so taken aback by the behavior so unlike Kyla who until that point had never demonstrated anything less than utter revulsion when grazed by so much as a ladybug.

In that moment, watching her observe the wriggling creature as it wrapped around her finger, a look of placid interest bordering on something more, I felt as though I didn’t recognize the woman before me.

She scratched mindlessly beneath her eye for a moment, with such ferociously it left angry red cuts across her skin, thin trickles of blood running from it.

Another twitch seemed to shock her system.

“Ever since Chelsea got sick, they’ve been here,” she spoke, her eyes not leaving the creature still writhing around her fingers. 

Her face contorted for a moment, into something resembling a grimace, as though the muscles weren’t entirely under her control before returning to normal.

Standing in the light of the kitchen, my eyes followed the shape of her bones visible beneath her skin which clung to her like an ill-fitting suit. Her face was gaunt, what looked to be a single errant vein visible beneath stretching from her chin, down her neck and disappearing under her shirt, pulsing in a way that made it seem almost alive. 

The odd effect made my skin crawl, despite myself. 

Her eyes were bordered with deep set bags, casting a shadow around them and…

“Kyla…” I breathed, my vision not wavering once from her face, focused on the area beneath her eye. 

“Your face…” I felt my hand brush against my own, and after a moment, head cocking to the side as she looked at me with a moment's confusion, she appeared to realize what I was indicating.

I could feel the contents of my stomach shift as her hand touched her face. She scratched absently for a moment, staring at me with a glazed sort of expression that made my heart drop, before pressing her finger against it. There was…*something* beneath her eyelid. 

I almost hadn’t registered it at first, appearing almost like an overly-pronounced vein, thin and protruding, but after a moment I began to notice an unmistakable movement as the skin above shifted with a decidedly unnatural affect. 

“Huh.” she breathed, as if I’d simply pointed out an errant string on a piece of clothing. 

I watched in confusion and disgust as she lowered her hand, settling the worm-like thing between her fingers onto the lip of one of the cups before her finger began pressing against the lump in her skin.

I felt like I was going to vomit as a silent, squelching sound could be heard with each movement. 

“I’m gonna go say hi to Chelsea,” the words tumbled forth, as I turned my head staring into the living room and avoiding looking her way. 

“T - then I should get going, it’s - I have homework.” I could see her from the corner of my eye, heading tilting curiously as she looked at me. 

I didn’t want to look, couldn’t, the bubbling in my stomach telling me one more unpleasant sight might reintroduce me to my lunch from earlier, but I couldn’t help but see from the corner of my eye as she began to pull…something from beneath the lid.

My heart pounded, a sore, acidic taste welling in my throat, and swallowed hard against it.

“It -  It was good seeing you, Ky.” I said, making my way to the living room before she could say anything else, pausing only to add, “I’ll go look in on Chelsea, but I think you guys should see a doctor.” 

I left it at that, not feeling comfortable explaining just how odd they were all behaving. She didn’t bother to respond, and when I saw why I turned and left the room before I could lose my lunch. The tip of her index finger was below her lower eyelid, as she moved it around pulling at something….what, I didn’t stay to find out

I nodded a silent greeting to Tracy as I passed, feeling far too sick to my stomach to speak for a moment. As I entered the room, a drop of water fell before me, making a soft *plink* in the carpet before me. 

I glanced up at the ceiling, taken aback at the sight before me. The drywall seemed to sag ever so slightly, forming a hanging bubble on the ceiling, drops of water falling from its bulging center. I  locked eyes with Tracy for a moment, her own gaze traveling from the drop on the floor, to the ceiling, and back to me with a look that was almost frantic in its fear, as though she was terrified of what I may ask next.

“Chelsea’s upstairs?” I asked, doing my best to keep my voice even. I could feel Kyla’s presence behind me, and was beginning to feel all too surrounded. I wanted to see Chelsea, and *go*.

Tracy’s eyes met mine for a moment, before quickly breaking contact as she peered down at the carpet. Something in her expression made my heart skip a beat. 

“Tracy? Is Chelsea upstairs?”

She nodded slowly, before whispering,

“In the bathtub.” Her voice was low and uneven, hollow almost, like hearing some A.I. recreation of the real thing, missing that inherent human sort of liveliness.

I made my way to the stairs, casting an uneasy glance over my shoulder back into the living room. Kyle stood under the doorway of the kitchen, peering back at me with an expression I didn’t like. A glance over at Tracy revealed she, too, was watching eyes wide and body taken with slight tremors.

It revealed something else too, as I caught the tail end of something long and thin, as it disappeared beneath the collar of her shirt. It was an all too familiar sight after what had taken place in the kitchen, and one that made my lingering need to vomit all the more pronounced. 

I glanced into the nearest of the mugs on the table, stomach turning at what I expected to find. 

My head spun as I saw what lie in the cup. Contained within maybe an inch of water, there was a swarm of those long thin insects, like so many tiny snakes, curled around each other until I could only see a thrashing mass of movement at the bottom of the cup.

Feeling a pit form in my gut, and all the more certain I needed to be gone as soon as possible I began to climb the stairs towards the hallway leading to the bathroom. 

Chelsea had been my best friend for years, and if anything the weirdness with the others now had me slightly worried for her. It wasn’t as though I imagined they might have done something to her. 

No, even for how strange they were behaving, I knew Kyla and Tracy, and they’d never hurt her. 

Still, since I’d stepped foot in the house things had seemed…wrong, and only gotten moreso. I felt an almost suffocating unease as I wondered just what state she might be in comparatively, looking at the two of them.

As I stepped onto the stairs, I flicked the light switch, once then twice, anticipation turning into disquiet as the darkness remained.

“We...took the bulbs out. She didn’t like the light.” Tracy’s voice was small, almost a whisper as though she were sharing something she ought not to be.

There was little to no light guiding the way, the hallway pitch black, and the windows in the rooms curtain shut tight, leaving me to feel for a light switch as I made my way up. 

The stairs creaked underfoot as I arrived at the landing, and a glance over my shoulder revealed both Tracy and Kyla standing opposite each other at the bottom of the stairs. 

Tracy shuddered, her body shivering as though the temperature in the house was in the negatives, scratching violently at her cheek for a moment which appeared to…well, I couldn’t be sure with the distance, perhaps it was just a muscle spasm, but in the moment her flesh appeared it shift in response to the touch. 

Kyla just watched, teeth grinding as she worked her jaw from side to side, a smile on her face that looked deeply out of place. 

They watched me with wide, glassy eyes that seemed almost…hungry, in the darkness the gaunt shape of their faces casting eerie shadows across their features.

The lingering pit of anxiety had only worsened as throughout this visit, now feeling like a boulder in my gut. 

Any distant thought I may have had of turning back abated by the sight of them watching me, peering around the corner like sneaking children.

My heart strummed rapidly, and I swallowed hard against the lump I could feel forming in my throat, head buzzing with the din of anxiety.

Despite their behavior, now fully past unusual and into well creepy territory, I continued on, that unease lingered over me like a stubborn fog. 

As I passed Chelsea’s room, I peered inside. It was dark , though even with the lack of light, I could see it was in a state of utter disarray. 

Using the light of my phone, I stepped inside and looked around. 

The room smelled of sweat, blood and sickness. I pulled my shirt over my nose,  the acrid taste of bile filling my mouth.

I looked down at the dresser, seeing one of Chelsea’s vet school textbooks open, several papers and notes surrounding it, covered in her illegible handwriting, her laptop sat beside it. A tap to one of the buttons told me it was dead, seemingly having been sitting unused for a while. I glanced down at the textbook, my brow furrowing as I took in its contents.

It was a book pertaining to various insects and parasites one might encounter in the veterinary field, and the page was open to one particular section. I recognized the creature depicted immediately, I’d seen dozens of them sense I’d arrived.

Horsehair Worm: *Nematomorpha are a phylum of parasitoid animals superficially similar to nematode worms in morphology, hence the name. Most species range in size from 50 to 100 millimetres long, reaching 2 metres in extreme cases, and 1 to 3 millimetres in diameter.*

*Harmless to humans, but this worm is deadly to its pray. Once it finds the perfect victim, it will burrow its way inside, altering the victims mindstate and behaviors, leading ultimately to their death as the horsehair worm drives it to drown itself in order to lay its eggs in water.*

“A parasitic worm…” I spoke the thought aloud, my skin crawling once more as I recalled being touched by one of the things. 

I was no entomologist, but I’d heard of things like that; parasites that could take over the mind of an unwitting host, usually some poor insect, driving them to destructive behaviors. 

My mind turned immediately to Kyla and Tracy, to their strange behavior and the way their skin seemed to move as though something was burrowing beneath… 

No. I tried to dismiss the conclusion beginning to form, though it clung stubbornly. Were my friends under the effect of some animal parasite? Whatever was happening, something told me only Chelsea would know. It seemed she was already looking into things.

A sound from the darkness ahead made me jump, something between a cough and a hacking.

On the far wall, a trail of those insects moved in disturbing unison, forming several trails as they all traveled into one corner of the room, the corner from which I’d heard the sound. It was dark, behind the long dresser against the wall, keeping it out of the light. 

Reluctantly I stepped forward, casting the light into the corner. I gasped despite myself, sucking in a mouthful of the awful air, sending me into an awful coughing fit. 

I couldn’t help it any longer, raising my shirt as a mouthful of vomit forced spewed forth. 

In the corner, sat Marlo, or what was left of the poor creature anyways. With all that had happened, I had forgotten the cat was half of the reason I was there. By the look of it, the creature was clinging to life, if it could even be called that, by a thread.

The right side of its face was gone, revealing flesh that was a patchwork mix of pale white and an inflamed, infected sort of red. In the gaping hole where its eye had one been, I could see those things moving in and out by the dozens. They covered him like so many massive fleas, and it didn’t take long to see what they were doing.

They were burrowing into his skin, moving through the fur and flesh, embedding themselves until only the smallest part was visible, appearing like thin, stiff strands of hair.

He tried to hiss, opening his mouth but managing little more than a crackle mewl.

“No, oh no, Marlo. You poor baby.” I felt my eyes burn with tears, heart pounding. 

For a moment it raised its head, and in its other eye I could see all of the pain it was in. Yet, in an instance it shifted. Without warning, it was on its feet. 

A look of animal rage filled its features, all the more horrifying given the state of it, as it began to stumble forth under legs that looked utterly destroyed, just a few visible tendons holding fur to bone, moving as though it was still learning their use.

It tried to hiss, this time making a sound between a hack and a growl, as a cloud of those wriggling horrors were sent forth from its mouth.

My heart thrummed against my chest, as I took a step back, its hiss rising to an awful yowl made worse by visible damage to its throat, which had been eaten away at so thoroughly I could see through it.

It stumbled forth with a sudden burst of speed, hacking up another cloud of the writhing things, nearly nipping me as it caught me off guard. 

“Marlo,” My voice shook, as I stepped back, head spinning. 

It hissed again, and when it did, its jaw snapped out of place, whatever tendon had been holding it tearing as the right side of its mouth hung impossibly wide. 

It started forward again, and I scampered back glancing over my shoulder at the door.

It was as though the cat knew what I was thinking, and as I turned to make my break for the doorway, it burst out into an uneven, frantic sprint in my direction, mouth hanging open as those things fell from its face with blood and saliva.

I ran, hurrying out of the room and slamming the door shut just as in time for it to collide against it, hissing and clawing furiously from the other side. For a moment, I remained there, pressed against the door and catching my breath before I felt something against my sock. Peering down, I could see a trail of those things, horsehair worms, I now knew, moving in unison from under the door and up my foot.

I stomped and kicked and shook until every last one was gone, stumbling away from the door. 

After a few moments to regain my composure, the sight of poor Marlo still fresh in mind, I peered down the stairs for the other two girls. They still stood there, watching me with big, empty eyes. A trickle of drool could be seen running down the corner of Tracy’s lips as she watched me.

I wanted to run, to speed past them and out the door but…my mind turned to Chelsea. I had to see her, with things seeming so wrong in the house, I had to be sure she was alright.

The bathroom was the last door at the end of the hall. It was shut tight, with only a small hint of light visible from the crack beneath, and with each step I made towards it I felt the knot in my throat grow until…

*Squish*.

I recoiled at the squelching sound beneath my feet, my foot suddenly soaked as I stepped onto damp carpet. There was water spilling out from beneath the doorway, and by the way it had spread out in a circle for almost four feet of the hallway carpet, it had been doing so for quite a while. 

My heart leapt in my chest, my entire body seeming to buzz with a shock of panic, as I quickly covered the rest of the ground between myself and the door, pounding three knocks against its frame. After several moments, suffocating on the tension that seemed content to strangle me with the knot in  my throat, I tried to knob. It turned without an issue, unlocked.

Taking a breath, I pushed inside.

A swell of water poured forth, running past my feet and into the surrounding rug. As I moved the door aside, I was taken aback by the sight of the bathroom. The walls, for a moment, appeared dark and writhing, until I realized that I hadn’t seen the walls at all, instead looking at a sheet of insects so thick it covered almost every inch of the place.

“Oh, oh *god…*” 

My blood ran cold at the sight.

I couldn’t see inside of the bathtub, the curtain, also rife with the horrid things was closed, but I could hear the running water and faint sloshing sounds from just behind the curtain, the unmistakable sounds of movement within the tub. 

My body was wracked but faint tremors, adrenaline, panic, and sheer disgust all coursing through me in waves, and the contents of my stomach twisting and turning at the thought of millions of little insects slithering over me. 

The floor was slick to the touch, water soaking every inch, discoloring the bottoms of the cabinets, sloshing as I reluctantly made my way into the room.

I shrieked, unable to help myself as I felt something hit my neck, cold and thin. I knew immediately what it was, slapping at the back of my neck furiously until I saw it fall onto the ground, washed out of the room in the streaming water. 

My skin crawled, and my eyes burned with tears, everything about this feeling like a waking nightmare as I stood before the bathtub, reaching for the shower curtain. 

I pulled the curtain aside with a hiss of the metal hooks against the rod, and in an instant I was face to face with a picture of horror. A scream ripped through me, loud and shrill, for what felt like minutes, head spinning with a sort of lightheadedness to when I stood up too fast. 

Chelsea was dead surely, the sight of her indicating she must have been so for quite some time. Her body was nearly unrecognizable, lying at the bottom of the tub utterly swollen and waterlogged, and her eyes…they were open, a glassy yellow staring up at me frozen in a look of utter horror. 

It would have been horrifying enough, had that been all, but from every inch of exposed skin, I could see holes riddled as those things, the worms burrowed their way out en masse. 

Before I could move, reach for my phone to call the police or do anything of the sort, her mouth snapped open with such force I wondered if somehow she was still living. 

The idea was stomped out by a wash of cold dread, as it continued to stretch, and stretch, until it was far past the limit of anything that ought to be possible for the human body.

At once, something began to emerge. It was large, a dark, shiny black like the carapace of a beetle. It began to slowly pull itself forth, shifting her head and stomach at points as something that appeared less like an insect, and more a massive snake began to unfurl through the water. 

It took only a few moments for me to realize what I was looking at. I took a step back as the massive worm began to thrash about the water, sending drops spraying in my direction. 

It had to be no less than five, maybe six feet in length, and from its surface it seemed to shed dozens of its smaller counterparts.

A creak from just beyond the door caught my ear. I turned just in time to see Tracy and Kyla bounding towards me, their faces utterly expressionless as either one of them grabbed me by an arm.

“What the fuck are you doing?!” I shrieked, struggling to pull myself free of their grip, which felt like iron. 

I struggled for purchase against the wet floor, realizing quickly where they were bringing me, as they began to drag me towards the tub. 

I felt the familiar sensation of those cold, tiny insects beginning to slide along my wrist, and could almost feel myself lose consciousness as I saw them pushing forth from Kyla and Tracy’s arms, burrowing out of skin like dirt, and crawling along my own.

My skin stung where they settled, and it didn’t take long to realize what was happening as so many needle-like sensations began to blaze through my forearms. 

They were burrowing…forcing themselves through my skin with excruciating effect. 

“Tracy, Ky, please get off of me, I -”  as I struggled pleading desperately in a vein effort to appeal to my friends, knowing already that it was useless, the sight of both girls filled me with a renewed terror. 

Both of their mouths hung open, so wide I was certain something in both of their jaws must have dislocated, and from it emerged the front half of creatures identical to that which had just emerged from Chelsea’s body.

It became horrifyingly apparent what they intended to do to me.

I fought, pushing hard against them to no avail as they brought my head closer to the tub.

The smell…it made my eyes water and stomach turn. My arm screamed with excruciating pain as three of the creatures attempted to burrow beneath my skin.

I felt a hand grip the back of my hair, forcing me towards the water. That thing, it coiled as, its body twisting and slipping into itself, writhing with something as similar to anticipation as such an alien form could permit, as it slowly rose up the side of the tub to meet me. 

I could see my face in its carapace as it approached, its body an oily black and smelling strongly of bile.

My arms sang with a stinging pain, a sensation like having fingers digging beneath my skin setting every nerve alight.

I had one chance to act, one opportunity to do *something* and little time to do it before I was a walking, talking *infestation* like my friends had become. 

My hair hung in the water below. I winced as they pressed my head against the side of the tub, my chin digging into the porcelain as my mouth was pried open.

The pain and panic lit my mind on fire. I let out a shriek, a shrill, primal sound like nothing I could imagine myself making, feeling a final surge of adrenaline. I pulled my legs in close so they were tucked beneath me, then out in front of me, and with all I could manage, kicked out against the bathtub. 

The sudden force sent me sliding back against the wet floor, taking the other girls off guard and making them momentarily lose both their grip and balance.

That thing emerged from over the edge of the tub, its head twisting in the air expectantly. I knew I had no time to think, scrambling and slipping to my feet, as I made a b-line for the door.

“NO!”

Tracy screeched in a voice that hardly seemed her own. I didn’t want to risk a glance back, unwilling to slow down as I barrelled towards, and down the stairs, desperately trying not to slip against the slick wood.

I could feel them behind me, my arms throbbing with a radiating pain that served as a reminder of why I needed to move, as I reached the door.

I quickly turned the lock and pulled it open, disregarding my shoes only a few feet away as I stumbled out into the night

As I clamored down the stone steps, feeling safe to chance a glance behind me, I could see Kyla reaching out from the doorway, her clawing hands just missing my shirt.

Tracy stood beside her, peering past us, face darkened in an expression that made my skin crawl.

There was a man walking his dog on the sidewalk just beyond watching us, the clamor of my exit having caught his attention. He looked on with an expression of mild interest and unease.

I pulled the gate open, thankful for the distraction as   I practically tripped over myself onto the sidewalk, landing on my knees a few feet in front of the man and his dog, which barked furiously at the doorway, its eyes never leaving Kyla or Tracy. 

"Are - are you okay, ma'am?" he spoke. 

"Do you need me to call someone?"

The reluctance and unease palpable in his voice as he looked between myself, disheveled and wet, arms trialed with ribbons of blood, and the girls in the doorway. 

My head swam, and after a moment I made my way back to my feet, not taking my eyes off of the doorway from which Tracy and Kyla stood, watching me with those dead, empty eyes.

A sharp pain in my right arm snapped my attention back to it, and my skin crawled as I saw why. Two of those things hung halfway from newly created holes on the skin, still attempting to burrow beneath. 

I could hardly help myself, I gripped the first then the second by the half of their body still exposed, and gritting my teeth, yanked with all my might. 

The sensation was excruciating, tears springing into my eyes as I could hear the wet *pop* upon their release. 

"Jesus Christ," the man took a step away as I tossed them to the ground, stomping down furiously upon them, his eyes wide as he stared at my arm. 

He looked as though he was going to be sick, and I couldn't blame him. I raised my hand breathlessly, to motion for him that I was alright. I would surely call the police, my friends needed medical attention and Chelsea… I pushed the thought from my head, feeling emotion threatening to bubble to the surface, I just wanted to gather myself before I did so.

The dog barked at me furiously, urging me to take a step back, growling as its head swiveled between myself and the doorway, as though it were unsure of who the threat was. 

My eyes locked with Kyla’s then Tracy’s as they looked over me. I couldn’t be sure, but it seemed in the moment, cast in the shadow of that dark house, as though the girls bore the slightest of smirks. I could feel Kyla’s eyes on my arm, and followed her gaze. 

At the back of my forearm, what appeared to be a vein extended out past the skin, bulging unnaturally.

With only a brief nod, the momentary motion filled with darker meaning than I could understand the two disappeared back into the house, moving as if with a single mind. 

I wanted to feel relief, or calm, anything other than what I felt in that moment, which was an unshakeable lingering sense that, in one way or another, they’d accomplished what they’d intended.

Unsure of what to do, and feeling very uneasy in my own skin, I bid the shell-shocked man farewell with a nod and a tight smile, mind still reeling as I turned and pressed forth from my car. As I made the same walk back that I had made on my way to their door, it occurred to me how drastically my view of what was possible, what horrors this world contains had been distorted in a single evening. 

As I started my drive, my mind awash in chaos as I made my way in silence, watching the streetlights glow pass overhead, I squeezed hard against the steering wheel, my eyes traveling to the vein on my forearm. Had it always been there?

I called the police when I got home. Upon searching the house and finding no trace of any of the three girls, or even the cat, I was given a stern warning on the wastefulness and consequences of prank calls to the police. 

I suppose I should be worried about that. About the potential of Kyla and Tracy and whatever horrible parasites they were under the effect of coming after me, but truthfully my mind has been on other things.

I find I’ve been taken by a strange sort of twitch recently, a spasm that started in my arm and seems to be spreading through my body with time. Even as I right this, I can see the muscle in my arm contracting, shifting as if by some other power.

Perhaps it’s just nervous energy. That’s what I'll keep telling myself.

I don’t want to consider the alternative.
