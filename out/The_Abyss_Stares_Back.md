I don’t have much time. My hands tremble as I write this, and though the words may sound absurd, I beg you to listen. I am Sister Maria. For twenty years, I served the Lord in quiet devotion at St. Agnes Convent, a crumbling abbey hidden in the woods of Vermont, as humble and forgotten as I often felt. Ours was a life of quiet service, endless prayers, and the hope that our sacrifices pleased God. I thought I understood devotion. I thought I understood suffering. But what happened here…

It made me question everything.

It began a month ago, the day Sister Eleanor found the statue.

The crypt beneath our abbey was old, older than the convent itself. Generations of sisters lay buried in those dark halls, some so long forgotten their names had eroded from the stones. We rarely ventured down there. It was a place of silence, a reminder of our mortality. Memento mori, they said. Remember your death.

But Sister Eleanor… She always had a restless heart. She claimed she felt drawn to the lower levels, to explore parts of the crypt none of us dared visit. When she returned, she was pale, clutching a statue unlike anything I’d ever seen.

It was grotesque.

Vaguely human shaped, but warped, its limbs twisted, its face an unreadable tangle of ridges and hollows. At its base was an inscription in a language none of us recognized, though it seemed to hum with meaning just beyond comprehension.

“This was buried in a sealed alcove,” she whispered. Her hands trembled as she held it. “Why would someone hide something so… divine?”

Divine. That’s what she called it. I should have known then. My heart screamed against it. It wasn’t divine; it was wrong. But I said nothing. I was too cowardly, too afraid of seeming paranoid, too trusting of my sisters.

We placed the statue in the chapel.

The first night, I dreamed of fire.

It consumed the abbey, the woods, the world. I saw my sisters burning, their faces twisted in agony. Through the flames, the statue stood tall, its form shifting, its hollow face filled with countless eyes.

I woke to whispers, soft and slithering. At first, I thought it was Sister Margaret praying in her cell. But when I stepped into the hall, I saw the others standing there, wide-eyed and shaking.

“Do you hear it?” Sister Beatrice asked, clutching her rosary like it was a lifeline.

The whispers grew louder as we gathered in the chapel, searching for comfort in prayer. But there was no comfort, no peace. The whispers seemed to come from inside us, unspooling in the deepest corners of our minds, where doubt and guilt festered.

The statue began to change.

At first, it was subtle. A new crease here, a hollow deepened there. But soon, it was undeniable. The ridges and hollows of its face began to resemble features, our features. My sunken eyes. Sister Eleanor’s trembling lips. Sister Margaret’s wrinkles of despair.

“God is testing us,” Sister Eleanor insisted. “We must endure.”

Her words were fervent, but her eyes betrayed her fear. She, too, had seen the way it moved, not when we looked, but when we turned away. It shifted, closer and closer, like a shadow that grew in the light.

The dreams worsened.

I dreamed of standing before God, trembling as He towered over me. But when He turned His gaze upon me, His eyes were not kind. They were voids — endless, suffocating voids.

“You are unworthy,” He said. “I gave you salvation, and you squandered it.”

The weight of my sins crushed me: the lies I told, the thoughts I buried, the times I doubted His will. Every sin felt like a stone around my neck, dragging me into the darkness.

When I woke, I found a note on my bedside table, written in my own handwriting. He knows. You were never worthy.

Two nights ago, Sister Eleanor disappeared.

We found her rosary in front of the statue, its beads blackened and warm to the touch. We prayed for her, but our prayers felt hollow. The whispers grew louder, more insistent, speaking in that unknown language I couldn’t understand yet somehow knew.

When I looked at the statue, I felt its gaze piercing through me, peeling away my soul layer by layer. It wasn’t just alive. It was sentient. It saw me. It saw the parts of me I tried to hide, the shame I carried like a shroud.

I was not a good nun. I prayed, but I doubted. I served, but I resented. I knelt before the altar, but my heart was often empty. The whispers seemed to know this, repeating over and over: He is not here. He has abandoned you.

Last night, I found the others in the chapel.

They knelt before the statue, their heads bowed, their mouths whispering in unison. The air was thick with an unholy presence, heavy and oppressive.

I called their names, but they didn’t respond. Their faces were pale, their eyes glassy. The statue had grown. It towered over them now, its form writhing with faces—dozens, maybe hundreds—all of them twisted in torment.

And then I saw mine.

I don’t know how much time I have left.

The statue is in my room now. I didn’t see it enter; it simply was. Its hollow face looms over me, and the whispers have stopped. The silence is worse.

I understand now.

This thing is not of God. It is older than Him, older than the universe. It is not evil, not in the way we understand. It is indifference incarnate, an abyss that reflects your soul and shows you the truth:

We were abandoned long ago.

If you find this letter, burn the abbey. Burn the crypt. And pray…not for salvation, but for ignorance. Because once you’ve seen the abyss, it never stops staring back.
