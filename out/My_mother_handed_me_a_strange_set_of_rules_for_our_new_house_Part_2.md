Part 2- You are here

(FINAL)

Picking up where I left off last time, I was sitting behind a creaky shelf in a warehouse.

It took me about an hour to finish writing the first part. Between paragraphs, I'd take a sip of dusty water and brainstorm ways to survive the night.

A few minutes after I'd posted, I was gathering supplies in a rather tattered backpack when I heard the screeching of metal being torn apart.

Turning around, I saw the creature tearing through the walls, having recovered from the eucalyptus-scented shaving *cream.* (Thanks for criticizing my wording, Reddit, now I can die correctly.)

It sniffed the air and immediately its attention snapped to me. I knew the shaving cream was mostly empty, and so I threw it at the monster, full force.

It roared, more annoyed than injured, judging from how it didn't flinch and instead swiped at its surroundings, trying to hit me.

I picked up the backpack, not bothering to put it on and dashed through the hole it had made in the wall, but it turned around, smashing the window next to me, giving me a few unappreciated cuts.

I practically flew to my car, almost dropping my keys as I started the engine. Deciding that, well, if they couldn't see me, I couldn't get fined, I ignored almost every traffic law. I mean, if that thing caught up to me I'd be dead anyways.

I weaved through traffic, not knowing exactly where I wanted to be. I checked my rear view mirror. Seemingly irritated that it couldn't see the cars, it fell behind, stumbling through the road. For once, I was glad to live in such a heavy traffic area.

I kept checking the time as I drove.

4:50   I could see it in the distance.

4:53   It was slowly getting closer.

4:56   I'd gotten out of the more densely populated areas. It was definitely catching up faster now.

4:58   Almost there. 2 more minutes. It wasn't all that far away now.

4:59   Oh crap. Oh crap it was only about 20 feet away.

5:00

I checked the rear view mirror... and it was gone. I thought for a moment and decided to go home, hoping people would be able to see me during the day. If not, I could at least get the rules.

&#x200B;

I arrived home about a half hour later, since traffic had started to pick up. When I walked in, I noted, relieved that neither my sister nor my mother had woken up yet. I went to sleep after a long night, happy to finally be out of danger.

That is, until I heard a window opening. I'm not sure when- maybe an hour or two later? The second rule flashed into my head and I kept my eyes closed.

1... 2... 3... I almost furrowed my brows, worried that I might not be able to remember what to count to.

4... 5... 6... I could head something coming into my room.

7... 8... 9... It was walking across the room. The floorboards creaked as it stepped. Odd, my floorboards don't creak...

10... 11... 12... I could feel my mattress dipping as it climbed onto my bed.

13... 14... 15... It was so cold I could feel it reaching out to me.

16... 17... 18... It was gone. My mattress went back to normal, and I kept counting. I was a bit miffed that they'd simply wrote "at night," since now it seemed that it just happened when the unlucky winner sleeps for a bit.

28.. 29... 30. I fell back asleep.

&#x200B;

It was about 9 AM when I woke up again. I decided to go out and read the rest of the rules, since, well... now that I knew only the *protective* rules didn't apply, I had to watch out. It could have been any other rule that I'd needed, and I wouldn't have known it.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*5. In the events of hearing a knock at the door, you must* ***always*** *look through the peephole first. If it is a delivery person, do not open the door. They know to leave it. In extension to this rule, you must bring it to whoever it belongs to. If this person isn't in your family, you must leave it near the woods.*

&#x200B;

*6. Never go into the room with a grey door. All real doors in the house are white. If someone asks you to go in, whether it be alone or with them, you must decline. Real other people cannot see the door.*

\*\*^(7)\*\*^(.) **^(If a)** \*^(m)\*\*\*\*^(a)\*\*\***^(n)** *^(with)* ^(a) \*\*\*^(w)\*\*\**^(hite)* ^(cap a)\*\*\*^(s)\*\*\*^(ks you to follow) \*^(h)\*\*\*^(i)\*\*^(m,) \*\*^(d)\*\*\*\*\*^(ecl)\*\*\*\*\*^(ine)\*\*^(.)

*7. In the events of a man in a white cap asking you to follow him, accept. If you don't, you must immediately apologize- this way, you might be spared. Apologies, there isn't really much in the way of hope for those who decline.*

&#x200B;

*That is all for the rules! Good luck surviving in your household. You probably won't though, as it's been documented that 80% of people who read this note eventually go insane. Remember to cross out any fake rules you see! That one's just etiquette, though. And don't worry, the page won't tear. Have a magnificent morning.*

I scratched out the first "Rule 7" with a pencil. Wouldn't want to be rude to whoever inherited my personal hell, right?

I decided that first on my to-do list would be checking if anyone could see me during the day. I knocked on my sister's door, but it swung open and I saw that it was empty. Of course- it was 9AM. She'd be at her day job.

Oh well. But.. this was something I needed to know. After a quick google search, I dialed the nearest pizza place. They seemed to hear me well enough.

When they came to the door, they seemed to see me just fine. I concluded that people could see me during the day, just not at night. How inconvenient... there goes my plan of stealing everything at Walmart.

&#x200B;

I spent the day gathering supplies and pretending I wasn't in danger of dying when I spoke to my family.

In the old tattered backpack, I added some clean water, a few granola bars, some money, matches, shaving cream, and a metal pipe for self defence. (Hey, its all they had.) The matches were to make a fire in case of emergency... and see if that thing was flammable.

I checked my watch when my mother and sister finally went to sleep. 9 PM. Enough time to hop on a train, just in hopes of the creature taking some time to catch up.

&#x200B;

I handed my ticket in and sat down in my seat.

It was 10:30PM when I saw it catching up to the train...it wasn't the same creature.

Crap.

&#x200B;

At 10:42, I got a good look at it. I was right. No way was this the same creature. This thing looked like all my family and friends. It was so welcoming. It wouldn't hurt me, right? *WRONG.*

I shook myself out of it, and for just a moment it looked like a 7 foot tall humanoid. What little hair it has is long and thin and its eyes are devoid of emotion. Yikes. Definitely not my aunt Jennifer.

This thing is definitely a lot smarter. It picked the lock of, mind you, a moving train, and calmly walked in. One woman's purse was knocked out of the train, but she didn't even notice. Each and every passenger seemed not to care.

It called my name. "Alex, there you are! Come with me. We're having pasta for dinner." It hadn't spotted me yet, so it said this in a warm and loving voice while it stormed from car to car, looking around and storming to the next.

Somehow, it passed by me.

"Come on, Alex, where are you? It's not nice to hide from your.. friend."

It began to look more agitated, passing through each train car again until it locked its eyes on me. "There you are." Not exactly being in the mood to die, I hit it in the head with my backpack.

***Clang!***

It fell to the floor. I'd been hoping it would stay that way, but it started to get up. Luckily, the train had reached a stop. I jumped out just as it got up and slammed its fists against the window angrily.

I'm writing this at the train station. I'm worried it'll break out and come back while I'm off guard, so yet again, I've written it all down in hopes that, if I die, at least someone will know what happened to me.
