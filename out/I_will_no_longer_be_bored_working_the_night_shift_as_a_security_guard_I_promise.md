  

I am a night shift security guard for a series of parking garages in the entertainment district in my city. Security is necessary here because people will leave cars after hours, drunkenly trash the bays and homeless people will seek shelter here which is an insurance liability. I take no joy in turning away people looking for shelter, but I take very little joy in any aspect of my job, save the solidarity. I put in my headphones at the beginning of my shift at 9PM, I set up podcasts to listen to until my shift ends at 5 in the morning. From 2 to 2:30 I get drunks out of the garage and on their way home, but other than that I very rarely have to talk to anyone. Nobody wants to talk to a security guard, and this particular security guard doesn’t care to talk to them either. Of course I get bored, but I need the money and I don’t ever think to myself “I wish I had someone to talk to.” I always just think “I wish I was at home watching movies or playing video games.” That’s part of what made the night I met Lauren so strange.

I will start by saying that despite my natural disposition of being a lone wolf, I am still a straight human man with a pulse so I enjoy the attention of a beautiful girl. The second Lauren walked into the garage, sat down on the curb and lit up a cigarette she had all of my attention. First of all, she didn’t acknowledge me, like at all. Most people walk into an empty space and see a security guard they at least say something, she did not. She was gorgeous even under the florescent lighting, which very few people are, and she moved with so much confidence. She was wearing grey jeans with rips and tears all the way down her legs. She had a blank black t-shirt on and an old pair of Vans on her feet. She had a pixie cut that was died green and a ring through her nose. I caught myself staring and so did she.

“Can I help you with something.” Her voice echoed across the garage where I was standing. It filled all of the space in the garage, almost like we were in a school gym, I just figured she was loud on purpose. 

“Well this is private property, ma’am. No parking after 2 AM and it’s almost 3:30 so anybody in here is considered to be trespassing.” God, I sounded like such a dweeb. I hated myself when it came out of my mouth. Maybe she could tell. 

“My goodness! Trespassing because I’ve sat down to have a cigarette? Call the cops I’ll be gone before they get here.”

“I won’t call them as long as you promise not to stay too long. My bosses check the cameras.”

“Your boss won’t even notice I’m here I’ll be gone so fast. Just tired of walking is all, needed to rest my feet. Not a lot of safe places for a girl to stop at 3 in the morning around here.”

“That’s ok. What are you doing out here anyway?”

“Couldn’t tell you, darling. Feels like I’ve been walking forever and I just need to sit. You’re kind to let me have a moment to rest.”

“I’d let you rest longer but I kinda need this job and they’ve gotten on me about being too soft on people looking for shelter before.”

“Imagine that. Someone just trying to get out of the cold or the rain or away from the thieves and other animals. A whole concrete building, safe and dry just sitting empty while people suffer on the street. How much do they pay you to watch people suffer.”

“Umm… I”

“Don’t answer that, I’m just giving you a hard time. I really am grateful for the rest, even if it was momentary. I should be on my way, my cigarette is out.”

I looked down to step away from my station and by the time I looked up she was almost out of the door. I didn’t say anything, just let her leave. There wasn’t anything to say anyway, I couldn’t offer her more time to rest or a safe place. I just sat back down and went back to watching the security cameras.

Before my shift ended I went back to look at the footage my boss would inevitably see so I could measure how long she was there. Couldn’t have been more than 4 or 5 minutes, I couldn’t possibly get in trouble for that but I wanted to check anyway. I started rolling the footage between 3 and 4 in the morning and no matter which camera I was checking I couldn’t see her in any of the video. Not every single spot in the garage is covered of course, this isn’t Ft. Knox, but I didn’t think she was sitting in a blind spot. The camera from the security station was looking over my shoulder at where she should have been but there wasn’t anyone there. Furthermore, the cameras don’t record audio so I couldn’t hear our conversation even if I wanted to. 

The tapes bothered me all the way home and then for days after. I then spent weeks hoping she’d come back for a sit, I wanted her to have a safe place to smoke a cigarette and rest her feet but she never came back. It was almost 4 months later, I came across the article. The article on the internet version of our local paper said that it was the one year anniversary of the police discovering the body of Lauren Keller. There was Lauren’s face. A picture clearly taken from some social media post. She was smiling in front of a waterfall, green pixie haircut. My heart sank into my stomach. I started to read. 

*“The body of a local woman was found in the Parker entertainment district downtown today, 6 days after she went missing. Local authorities have confirmed the body is Lauren Keller, who went missing in the early hours of September 22nd. She was walking to her nearby apartment after a night out with friends when she sent a text to her sister that she thought someone was following her. She eventually called her sister and said she would take shelter and wait for someone to pick her up but there was some arguing heard in the background before the signal cut off. When Lauren’s sister tried to call back there was no answer.* 

*“Security cameras show Lauren’s last location as a parking garage on West and Main, where a security guard is seen blocking her entrance from the garage. Lauren walks away and then 30 seconds later a hooded figure is shown walking down the sidewalk in the same direction as Lauren. No suspect has been identified.”*

I hope she finds a place to rest. I know I won’t for a very long time.
