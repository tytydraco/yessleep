I was in an accident 17 years ago. I was 20 then. I needed a blood transfusion, so they tested my blood and got me the type I needed. I’m grateful for it, really. 

But what happened after, changed my life in ways I could never have predicted.

I got a call from someone claiming to be from one of the largest medical research lab in the world. I’ve since signed an NDA, plus a bunch of other hush hush forms, so I can’t mention their name. That call was quickly followed by a visit to my home. By officials. Medical and official looking personnel in suits. 

They had detected a rare strain of antibodies in my blood. That’s what they told me, anyway. Antibodies that could cure a previously untreatable disease. I can’t say too much of what it is, for I’ve signed papers. And very honestly, I didn’t understand half of what they said.
 
But it sounded important. Like my blood saves lives. Millions of lives, even. So I agreed to donate my blood for their research. They didn’t get back to me for more than six months, and I thought that was it. Maybe my blood wasn’t as useful as they had thought it was. 

They turned up at my home 8 months after that first meeting. They had figured out a way to use the antibodies in my blood to cure and prevent said disease. 

That was when life really changed for me. 

Initially, I was ecstatic. Having blood that saves lives? That made me feel useful. Helpful. Powerful, even. I committed to donating blood once a month. I ate well, kept fit, to make sure I was fit for donation. I knew the importance of my blood, after all. 

But then, they found a way for me to give blood every week, without serious repercussions. I just had to keep myself in tip top condition. They gave me nutritional and lifestyle guidelines. I said yes, though it was a chore, because, well…who can say no to saving lives? And so many lives, at that?

Let me tell you this. However meaningful something is, when you’ve to put aside plans, modify your entire lifestyle for it, and get jabbed with a thick needle every week, it quickly loses its shine. 

Nobody forced me to do anything. But they outlined the consequences of every action clearly. If I were to smoke, I’d not be able to donate blood for the week. And that would mean an average of 347 lives lost. That’s what they said. I don’t even know if that disease has that high rates of death and prevalence, but okay. I tried to check said disease and its prevalence rates online, which didn’t seem to match up to what they said, but they explained that there were many layers to it, that their lab has a worldwide reach. That you have to consider the entire world’s people with said disease, their access to the cure, the stage of their disease, etc. etc. Again, they lost me. I’m not especially smart. 

So I went along with it. Honestly, being told that moments of carelessness, of impulsivity, may cost hundreds of lives, well. That leads to a meticulously planned out life. One full of anxiety and stress. Yet, at the same time, I needed to keep mentally well. To not let my mental health affect my physical health.  So I had to do a lot of therapy and mindfulness. They allowed antidepressants, but dissuaded me from them, just in case. 

If it doesn’t sound that bad to you, let me paint you a picture of my last vacation with my ex husband. 

It was 12 years ago. We agreed to go to the South of France. Sounds ideal, romantic, yeah? Nope. While there, I had to watch my diet. That’s fine. But that was when I first noticed the people following me. 

I don’t know when it started. I mean, I’m not the most aware person when it comes to my surroundings. I’m often in my head. Worrying about my blood health. 

But I finally noticed that I was being followed. Very subtly, very stealthily. I probably wouldn’t have spotted them if not for the fact that I was robbed at knifepoint. 

My ex husband was knocked out first. The robbers looted his stuff as they waved the knife in my face, saying that they were gentlemen, but that I needed to hand over my purse. Trust me, I wasn’t about to fight. 

I was about to hand my purse over, when I think I had a panic attack. My vision blurred, my breath came in strangled, short gasps, and my chest squeezed painfully. Doubling over, I felt cold sweat oozing out of my pores like my insides were being wept out my skin. 

My vision had all but gone dark when I heard two thumps. I collapsed to the floor, and from my viewpoint on the ground, with the cobblestones filling half my field of vision, I saw the two robbers on the ground. Out cold. Three vague figures dragged the downed robbers along the path until they were out of sight. 

Next thing I knew, someone was checking my pulse. I heard the man say something along the lines of me being all right, and that the emergency services were on their way. Then I was alone. I passed out just as a group of people began to surround me and my ex, cooing in worry.

When I woke up, I described what happened to the police, to the medics, but no one had seen those three people. The ones who had knocked out the robbers. There was no sign of the robbers, either. The police weren’t sure what to make of it, but they let me go after getting a thorough report and making sure we were checked in at a hospital. They claimed that I had passed out due to my panic attack - which was odd, since that had never happened before. My ex was fine, and we wanted to go on with our holiday after we had both recuperated in the hospital for a day. 

We tried to extend our vacation to make up for lost time, but then I remembered - any delay in blood donation meant the loss of lives. 

My ex husband blew up then. He had been more than patient with my strict lifestyle and requirements. He never could get me to go on vacation with him for over 6 days. He understood my issues, and he had signed papers as well.  But he just really wanted one trip where we could enjoy ourselves for real. 

“What’s one delay going to do? It’s one time. In years!” he had begged, frustration lacing his tone. 

I had caved. Texted my contact, asked to push back the date of the blood donation. He got back to me saying it was up to me, but that X number of lives hung in the balance. I showed the message to my ex, who hung his head. We didn’t extend that trip.

In a month, my ex had upped and left. He disappeared from my life, seemed to just have moved out of the country all together. In the morning, he said he was leaving for work, and by the evening he sent me a text. He had enough. He was leaving. He told me he never wanted to see me again, that if I ever loved him I would let him go. Not make things harder by searching for him. I never heard from him after that. He didn’t bother to pack. His leaving was a huge slap in the face. I never thought him capable of being so cruel. The fact that he never even said goodbye in person made me wonder if our marriage had been such a torture the entire decade.

Well, I never dated again. 

And people kept following me. It didn’t help my sanity. I mean, I know they were there to keep me safe. That I ought to feel secure, at ease, knowing people were out there watching out for me. But all I felt was watched. Paranoid. Targeted. No matter where I went, I didn’t feel free to just be. I was always aware of trailing eyes. 

But it never truly scared me, until a time when they stepped in again to protect me. 

I was drinking a soda at a bar (since my diet was strictly no alcohol). As I was lifting the glass to my lips, someone rushed forward, smacked my drink out of my hands, and scurried off. Disappeared. I was pissed. The drink got all over my stuff, including my phone, which died (temporarily, thankfully). I requested the CCTV footage to hunt down that man, which the bar obliged - I was close to the bartender. She was endlessly amused by my regular appearance at the bar, despite only ever drinking soda. Or hot chocolate. I was the butt of a lot of good natured jokes. 

As we looked at the footage together, it quickly became clear that the drink slapper had been watching me the entire night. I simply hadn’t noticed.  My jaw tensed and I felt a rush of heat to my head. Minutes before he had slapped the drink from my hands, the footage showed a man shifting closer to me. He unobtrusively dropped something into my drink. 

The drink slapper had saved me from being roofied. 

It sounds great, right? Well I thought so. Except, the bar and I both thought it was important to report the guy who roofied my drink to the police. It was late then, around 2am. My bedtime’s usually at 10, 11pm, but once a month, I let loose a little. Not in terms of drinking alcohol, but in that I liked to pretend I was a normal person who could hang out with her friends ‘til late at a bar. 

I was wiped. Didn’t want to deal with the police and interrogations blah blah. So we agreed that the next day, we would contact the police. 

We didn’t contact the police. Overnight, the bar burnt down. 

I don’t know how, or why. But I have my suspicions. More than one face was captured in the footage. Mr Drink Slapper must have not wanted his face known to the authorities. 

Honestly, after that, I couldn’t really trust the personnel from that medical research lab. I don’t even know if that’s what they are. I’ve been to a small clinic that they are supposedly affiliated with, but I’ve never been to the headquarters. 

I wasn’t sure what else I could do though. Did I want to risk not saving hundreds, thousands of lives, just because I wasn’t convinced that my blood was being used to do good? They had shown me a tonne of data. Given me a lot of information. But I didn’t truly understand those. I had never met a single person that I’ve saved. I’ve been told that I’ve saved more than two hundred thousand lives so far. I don’t know how much of that is an exaggeration. Or if it’s even real. Honestly, sometimes I really start to have serious doubts about whether that’s really what my blood is being used for. Would a medical research lab put so much effort into ensuring my well being, just to save lives? Is any organisation that powerful, with so many resources at its disposal, be that good-hearted?

I know. I’m probably just resentful and making up conspiracies to try to give myself an out from the nonstop blood donations and controlled life I lead. 

Anyway, where was I. Oh yes. So last week, they asked that I check myself into their facilities to do a full body check up. They also wanted to run some tests. Non-invasive, and pain-free, they assured me. They needed me to be in there for a month. 

Something snapped, then. I don’t know if it was the 17 years of strict regimens, the lack of freedom, the inability to take long breaks, or the paranoia of being followed 24/7. Maybe it was their interference even in my choice of career. They insisted on something low-stress. That they would provide funding if I needed it. Definitely not vet school, they had said. Something about would I rather save animal lives than human lives? Whatever it was, something did it. I snapped. 
“I’m done,” I had said. “I’ve done enough, and I’m done.”

The officer speaking to me had seemed shocked. All his flabbers were ghasted. He sputtered something about lives to be saved, lives lost, the weight of all those deaths on me, but I simply shrugged. 

“You have money. You have tech. You can figure out how to replicate my blood, the antibodies within. I’ve given enough. There’s plenty for you to experiment with.”

“We can’t do that yet. We need your blood. They need your blood” he said, or something along those lines.  

“I’ll die one day, anyway. And who would save those lives then? I ain’t having kids, can’t have them, so…what happens after I die? Better you guys start figuring this out now. Go figure.”

After which, I shut down. Refused to say another word no matter how he begged. 

Until he agreed. All he needed from me, he said, was a visit to their headquarters. Donate blood just one more time. And do a full body screening. Whatever helps them leave me alone. 

So yes, my freedom began last week. It has been amazing. I went out to a bar just now, had my first drink in almost two decades. The trip to the headquarters is in a week, so I’ve plenty of time to get my body back to tip top condition before my final blood donation. 

I know I should be feeling immensely guilty right now. After all, I’m putting my freedom above others. My freedom, at the cost of other lives.

But all I feel is relief. I guess I’m more selfish than I thought. 

To the organisation’s credit, they haven’t badgered me at all. There’s been a complete lack of contact from the organisation after. Part of me is a little unsettled. Would they really just let me go? After they had put so much effort into keeping me safe and well? Another part of me is just glad they are respecting my decision. 

They haven’t stopped following me though. I can see the shadows from the men’s legs blocking the light entering the gap beneath my front door. They’ve been there for a good two hours now. I’m not sure when they’d leave. 

Maybe they’ll just keep watch until I head to their HQ in a week. Then I’d be free. 

Damn it, work texts. Don’t people know to respect the official work hours? It’s 1am.

It’s my boss. 

‘WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU’RE QUITTING?’
‘You can’t just disappear, you’ve to serve your notice!’
‘Did something happen?’
‘Call me.’
‘Btw it’s really surprising you’d pull something like quitting over email.’

My eyebrows shot up. Quitting? I had done no such thing. I wanted freedom, but not that much freedom. I need my job. I’m gonna check my email.

Okay omg. There’s a sent email. A whole ass resignation letter. Declaring that I won’t be showing up for work with immediate effect. That I had an emergency to attend to in another city. 

Someone must have hacked my email. The resignation letter even had my e-signature. It was sent out just half an hour ago. Trust my boss to be awake at this time of the night, checking her emails.

I’d better call her to clarify. 

Wait. Shit. Someone just inserted a key in my lock. Wtf. Do the guys outside have a key?! 

Okay I just locked my bedroom door. Holy shit they’re in my house. I don’t know what they want. 

I’m calling the cops. Shit the call got cut off. I’m not sure how long I’ll have the internet

banging on door. i’mscaredhelp


EDIT: Oh. It was a false alarm. Just my family coming to check in on me. I overreacted. The work thing was settled too. Just an angry ex colleague. All is well. No need to worry.
