I still hear her scream.
Jessika.

The wolves came before I could even raise my rifle. One moment she was running toward me, the next her head jerked sideways, teeth sinking into her throat. The sound—the crunch—stayed with me. They dragged her into the woods, and all I could do was scream her name until the trees threw it back at me.

That was ten years ago. Ten years of conquest, of burning cities to ash, of nations bowing under my armies. And still I feel nothing. No victory, no peace. Only emptiness.

“If I suffer, the world must too.” That’s what I tell myself every time another city falls. But it never works.

The night it happened, I was drunk. Another victory feast, the air stinking of wine and sweat. My scientist, Jack, found me. Pale man, quiet voice, always watching.

“You asked for it,” he said. “It’s ready.”

I knew what he meant. The simulation. The machine.

“Then let me see her,” I told him.

“You shouldn’t do this drunk. The chip—it doesn’t like poison. There’s a chance—”

“Do it.”

He hesitated, but I saw something in his eyes then. Not fear. Not doubt. Something darker.


The chamber was steel and silence. In the center, a chair beneath a blank screen.

I threw myself onto it, barely steady. “This will bring me back to Jessika?”

“In a way,” Jack said, hands moving over his instruments. His voice was flat.

A needle slid into my arm. Blackness swallowed me whole.


When I opened my eyes, I smelled garlic. Heard humming.

Jessika.

She was in the kitchen, her hair falling in curls over her shoulder as she cut vegetables. The sunlight slanted warm through the curtains. She looked back at me and smiled.

“Dinner soon,” she said.

I stumbled forward, tears burning my face. I touched her. Warm. Real. Alive.

For the first time in ten years, I breathed.


At the table, I waited. Minutes passed. Her humming stopped.

“Jessika?”

No answer.

I went to the kitchen. The pot smoked on the stove, broth blackening. Jessika stood with her back to me, knife still in her hand.

“Baby?”

She turned.

Her head slid from her shoulders, eyes wide, mouth opening and closing as her flesh peeled away. The smell hit me like rot poured straight into my lungs.

I grabbed her, tried to hold her together, but she fell apart in my arms.

And from the trees outside—I swear I heard the wolves again.


I slammed my thumb on the switch in my wrist. “Jack! Get me out!”

His face appeared on the monitor above me. Smiling.

“I warned you,” he said. “But you never listen, Daniel. Not when you slaughtered villages. Not when you burned my daughter alive.”

My blood froze. “What—?”

“You don’t even remember,” Jack whispered. Then he laughed. “Good. You’ll die never knowing where the nightmare began.”

The screen went black.


The house changed. Shelves along every wall. Each shelf lined with Jessika’s severed heads, eyes staring, some laughing, some weeping, some begging.

I ran upstairs. Our bedroom. Jessika lay sleeping on the bed.

I touched her hair.

Pain ripped through me like lightning in my spine. My vision blurred white. I screamed, then darkness took me again.


When I woke, my hands were wet. Blood. Jack lay at my feet, his body stabbed open, screwdriver in my grip.

But as he twitched, his face shifted. Jessika’s eyes looked up at me.

“Daniel… why?”

The walls peeled away. Wolves burst into the kitchen, tearing Jessika apart again.

I lunged to save her, but this time the pack turned on me. Teeth shredded me, ripped me alive.

And over it all, I heard Jack’s voice, laughing through static.

“Ten seconds. That’s all you lasted. Ten seconds, Daniel! And now you’ll last forever.”


I woke again.

Jessika was in the kitchen, humming. Dinner almost ready.

And I knew—I would never leave.
