*This is not a call for help. This is simply a chance to feel heard. Below is a catalog of thoughts, feelings, and descriptions of the events that have led me to where I am now, in space, but more specifically, in my own head. Things like what I describe have happened to me before, but this time…well, it felt malicious. I’ve tried to talk to several people about what I’ve seen, the energy I feel from the empty apartment right across from mine, but everyone just shrugs it off, claiming that what I feel is a fear manifested by grief.*

*It’s real. I know it’s real. There’s a squatter in that empty apartment, and it has been playing games with my mind.*

There is a certain tumult to apartment buildings, especially in a college town. A semester ends and the vacancies increase until the neighborhoods and surrounding boroughs almost seem to lack that certain quality that makes a city breathe. I’ve seen it, time and again. The moving trucks and parents arrive, then depart a day or so after, children in tow. Then a month before the following term, the dance resumes again, but in reverse. You can see the young, bright eyed kids eagerly on the cusp of learning what independence means— at least, that certain parent funded brand of it— or there are the older students, returning to the playgrounds of said independence after spending a winter’s or summer’s worth of time reliving how it felt to be under the thumb of what raised them.

This turnover is typically quick, albeit annoying. U-Hauls are parked poorly in the streets, blocking traffic, blocking parking lots. Every dumpster for blocks is full and unable to take the daily trash of those of us who stay here year round. 

And the parties. Good god, I could go a lifetime without being neighbored to a dozen apartments sagging and bowing under the weight of people drinking, smoking, fucking, and blasting music in a haze of goodbyes, fights, and cheers of congratulations that last until dawn all the week prior to that cyclical, en masse moving, and it still wouldn’t be enough to make up for the sleep I’ve lost living under or beside those bouts of loud revelry. 

I used to not be this cynical. I’ve done my fair share of this ritual, helping friends for pizza and beer lunches, I’ve even thrown my own housewarming or moving parties, but once you cross the hump of your twenties, things usually change. We slow down. The quiet isn’t such a scary thing. I love the city I live in, I wouldn’t trade it for the world, but when I turned 27, I knew I had to get out of that raucous center. 

After a short time looking for an escape, my wife and I found H— Court (or simply, The Court). We could have kept looking, we could have moved out of state. But this was the bed we chose, the place we picked to lie our heads. 

Tucked in a neighborhood far enough from the college, but not so far that we couldn’t quickly access the non-collegiate half of the city, was a five story brutalist structure, all brick and glass, unappealing from the outside, but spacious and welcoming once you step beyond the structure’s threshold, its dimly lit stairwell, and hospital like hallways. It was a really nice place. Cheap enough for what we could both muster, expensive enough to not be a complete shithole.

The Court was shaped like a big block letter U, its arms extending out four units long. We got a place on the second floor of the left arm, closest to the stairwell. 

The neighborhood was quiet, and from what immediate neighbors I did see when they milled about, walking pets or kids in strollers, we seemed to be surrounded by folks our age or older. There were no loud parties, just small get-togethers that, in the coming months, my wife and I were invited to from time to time. The kind of events where wine is served alongside small bites of food.

Sure, there were crying babies, and the occasional spat heard coming through the floor, sounding hollow and without substance, or the echo of lovemaking that bled through walls and sounded much like the fighting, but besides that, the people of The Court seemed to thrive at a pace I had been wanting to mimic since I had graduated college. 

From what our leasing agent told us on the day before we moved in, people who found themselves at The Court rarely moved out, citing to us the reasons they did as if it were a checklist of wants and dreams. 

“We try to do exit interviews with the tenants that move out,” the leasing agent clucked, “Sounds odd, I know, but think of it like quality control on our part. We want to make sure we are doing everything to make everyone’s experience here a perfect one. Most folks cite that they are only leaving because they found higher paying jobs in different cities, or that they finally found the perfect home to raise their family in. I can proudly say that we have 5 star reviews all the way down.” 

And he was right. That was the main reason we hastily signed a lease and laid down a hefty deposit on our new apartment. We couldn’t find a single bad word about The Court, and, as we were informed by the agent, that day, their vacancies are few and far between. 

 The agent continued gassing up the space we had already consigned the next year of our lives to: “And you should feel real lucky to get a stairwell unit, too. These puppies are envied by everyone here. So convenient! Makes getting in and out super easy!”

My wife and I nodded in agreement, speaking in gregarious platitudes that seemed flat against the agent’s forced and shrill customer service tone. As I walked about the empty cavern of our new home and took a turn into what would soon be our shared office space, I noticed that the apartment directly across from us, the mirror of ours in the right arm of the U, was barren. The dull wattage of the only present and lit bulb in the three socket, combination ceiling fan/only light source in the room was putting out just enough light to illuminate a single, solitary corner. The rest of the space was caked with shadows. The room looked sad. It looked hungry for life to be inside it. 

I went back into the living room to ask the agent about it. When we were originally touring the place, we were informed that there was only one unit up for grabs. If there was another, we had a host of friends or coworkers that would snatch it up in a heartbeat.

My words seemed to confuse him; he almost looked threatened. His smile went from relaxed to forced, then quickly eased back into relaxed as a remembrance washed over his disposition. 

“Oh. Oh, yes. We reserve that unit for short term tenants. Folks who only stay a couple of months, here and there. Visiting professors, vacationers. We even had a famous artist stay there once. I can’t quite remember her name, though.” 

He paused and made deliberate eye contact with me, and lowered his volume, never once breaking his smile, but putting on an air of pretend sorrow. 

“There’ll be an elderly woman moving into that unit soon. Hospice care, essentially. Cancer. Stage four. Her sons’ll be here sometime next week to move her in.” He took a step towards me, like he had a secret he wanted to share. “They told me her doctor gave her four, six months maximum. Really sad, I know, but I’m just happy we’ll be able to provide her with a wonderful living situation for the time she has left.” He hadn’t blinked once since the flood of information began. 

I nodded, slowly, hoping to mirror his same play-acting of concern before turning, and going back to wandering the vacant space. I could feel the agent’s eyes follow me into every nook and cranny I ventured into, like I was a stone’s throw away from figuring out a terrible truth he had been keeping close to his vest. 

A couple days later, we had completely moved in. It was an easy task. The stairwell was wide, and the halls and doorway were spacious enough that we didn’t have to finagle any of the furniture. We were so excited about the place, we even unpacked the various odds and ends that usually take most folks weeks to get to, the wind of our excitement pushing us along to put everything in its place. 

Not long after we had settled in, the old woman moved in across the way. Her huge, hulking sons made swift work of the meager possessions of someone you’d think would own a lifetime’s worth of memories. But no. There wasn’t a lot to be seen. I did the “neighborly” thing, and peeped from my shade covered window at what the sons lifted to and fro. Kitchen supplies, a small bundle or two of clothing, old medical equipment, and near-bursting boxes with the word “PHOTOS '' written across their sides in chicken scratch scrawls. No more, no less. 

The men were gone almost as fast as they had arrived, one riding away in a moving van, the other atop a wide motorcycle. I thought it rude that they hadn’t stayed to help their own mother unpack, but recognized my own hypocrisy in hiding behind my curtain and not going down to offer a hand in the unloading process. 

While doing the mental gymnastics to try and convince myself I wasn’t a bad person for not showing some initiative and going to help, I saw the woman. She appeared in the dimly lit room, and opened its window. I hadn’t seen her once in that entire moving process, but here she was, the punk rock grandma riddled with cancer. She wore a spiked denim jacket and the quarter inch of hair she still had was a bright shade of green.

Her name was Miss Janice, and she became my favorite neighbor. 

The first time my wife and I met her, she had been struggling up the stairwell with two plastic grocery bags weighing her down. We stopped, insisted on helping, and after carrying her groceries into her new home, she invited us over for treats and drinks after she got done with the unpacking. We offered to help her unpack, but she only laughed. 

“I got shit you youngins shouldn’t ever have to see.” We heard her laugh from the hall as we went back to our place with intrusive thoughts of the weird stuff a dying seventy year old woman gets herself into when she is alone swimming through our heads. 

Miss Janice weakly knocked on our door a few days later, and my wife and I followed her to her apartment. The interior was quaint, though eerily bare. No pictures hung on the walls, despite the many “PHOTOS” boxes I had seen. A plant had already begun gathering dust on its wide leaves by the entrance. It seemed more like a nursing home than a bohemian paradise, or modern suburbanite safe haven, or whatever bullshit nomenclature it was our other neighbors used to describe their garish homes. In the living room Miss Janice led us into, there was a remote controlled recliner, a love seat, and a TV set that was a decade or so out of fashion. We sat on the loveseat while Miss Janice took to her well loved space on the recliner.

She served us brownies, coffee, and various stories about her life. Sometime in the mid 70s, she had denounced the religion her parents’ forced upon her and shaved her head right in front of them. She made a pilgrimage from her once home, here, in the bible belt to New York, and soon after arriving there, it became a permanent move. She had played bass in dozens of punk bands all throughout the 80s, most of which only had lasted a week before they played a show, and quickly disbanded after the concert. She talked about her late husband, how they met in a tattoo shop where she quickly learned that needles weren't for her. They got married a month after they met. They had two rambunctious boys that were always in and out of trouble, and had learned to ride motorcycles before they were five years old. She had worked in a car part factory for nearly twenty years before cancer was found in her lungs when she was around the age of fifty. 

“I beat its ass, then, but now it's back for revenge!” During the extensive rundown of her history, Miss Janice had interjected jokes and declarations, putting on voices to fit the seriousness or hilarity of whatever it was she was talking about, and to follow this, she approached her sickness with a play-ominous tone, but punctuated it with an all-too-real hacking laugh-cough.

We had spent upwards of three hours at Miss Janice’s place, and I would’ve stayed for much longer had I not noticed my wife getting antsy to get back home and walk our dogs before the sun finished setting. We excused ourselves, making vague plans about returning on another day, and went for the exit. As I walked by her, Miss Janice put a hand on my arm.  

“Oh, Aaron. Would you mind helping me with something?”

“Sure. Whatcha need?” I looked at my wife and mouthed that I would be home in a moment. She left quietly, eggshell walking like so many do around the old and dying, but I could hear the double kerchunk of the stairwell doors breaking the silence of her politeness as she went from Janice’s side of The Court to ours. It was a common nuisance of a noise that frequently broke the tranquility of The Court, but also an unavoidable, though easily dismissable, fact of living here.

Miss Janice took a second to stand, and began walking to the room that looked into our office. I was expecting her to need something electronic fixed, or moving trash taken out, but when we got into the spare room, a space full of random bits and pieces strewn about: home care medical equipment lined the walls, and stacks of scrapbooks were precariously shoved into  those sagging, bulging copy paper boxes I had seen on her move in day, Miss Janice stopped at the room’s closet door, turned to face me, and asked, “Would you mind grabbing the little black box off the top shelf of the closet for me, sugar?” 

She looked into my eyes with a tense stare, her smile never ceasing. Her look made the hair on the nape of neck stand on edge, but I tried to shrug it off with a smile of my own. I opened the closet slowly, expecting a waterfall of more clutter to descend upon me, but no. The closet was well maintained, if not a little deeper set into the wall than the one in our office. Winter clothes were hung on nice wooden hangers, some holiday decorations were in matching boxes on the floor that were stacked in a neat and even pile. And on the top shelf was the little black box. I grabbed it for her, and turned to see Miss Janice with a disappointed scowl on her face. She was looking directly into the closet. When she noticed my confusion at the face she made, she quickly went back to her previous jovial demeanor. 

“Thanks, hun. Here.” She reached into the box and rifled around its varied, small contents before producing a single, yellowing pin back button with a band name under its plastic made with cut out letters from what appeared to be a wide variety of books. It read “Hell’s Idiots!” 

“This is the only band’s name I can remember. Mainly because I have the button, but also I think I had the most fun while playing with them. In those other ones, throughout the years, we couldn’t stop fighting, someone slept with someone else’s squeeze, or someone started doing the hard stuff. It all just led to fighting and eventual breakups of several kinds.”

“Leave a bunch of enemies in your wake, huh?” I joked, trying to lighten the mood that had soured as soon I opened the closet door. I held the button up in the dull lightning, and had a hard time examining the many decades worth of surface scratches the button had collected. I made a mental note to get Miss Janice a fresh set of bulbs for this room’s fan. 

“Hon, when you live life like I did when I was young, everyone was your enemy, and they either stayed that way or they became a lover. Hell, now that I think about it, it was usually the other way around!” 

I stood there chuckling with her for a few beats, but through her fit of mucus filled laughter, I could see that Miss Janice wouldn’t take her eyes off the slightly ajar closet door.

In the following months, we began to understand the ebb and flow of Miss Janice’s good days and bad days. We could tell by how quickly she answered the door whether or not her body was working with her or against her. My wife was resolute that it was just the cancer that was overtaking her, making Miss Janice ill more and more frequently, but I felt there was something else underlying the physical stress of slowly perishing. 

On some of the good days, when we were all together in her living room, watching game show reruns on her old TV, I’d catch Miss Janice staring at us. Well, what I thought was us. When I looked at her, her eyes were focused above our heads at the door behind the loveseat, the only thing that broke up the monotony of that bare white void of a back wall. That door that led to her clutter room would be closed every time we walked into the den. I was sure of it then, as sure as I am now. But on those occasions that she would be staring and I would notice where her attention was fixed, Miss Janice would seem to grow ill and tired and scared, and would ask us to leave. As we moseyed on home, I would look back at that door and see that it had opened slightly, the darkness behind it seeming to breathe and writhe, expectantly. 

The days that followed were usually the bad ones. It would take Miss Janice so long to unlock and answer her door, she eventually just gave us the spare key, so we could go and leave as we pleased. We brought her meals nearly every day, placing foil-covered paper plates on the same counter on which the previous day’s meals had begun the all too quick procession of rotting. Miss Janice lost so much weight, that her jean jacket began to envelope her entire body, and when she could walk, she would wander around her apartment looking like a denim ghost.

I eventually got around to bringing light bulbs for her spare room. I let myself in, noticing Miss Janice was peacefully sleeping on the love seat, the new accessory of a plastic tube of an oxygen tank wrapped around her shrunken face. I went to go screw the bulbs in, but was quickly sidetracked when I noticed  that the closet was open. I swore something knocked about within it, a muffled ruckus thumped in a beat of three knocks. I nearly dropped the bulbs at the sound. I began to sweat a little as I slowly approached the locus of the noise. With fear in my stomach and a chest full of false bravado, I swung the closet door open.

It was empty, now, save for the contents of a box having been strewn about, papers carpeting a portion of the closet floor. I looked around the room. hadn’t noticed upon entering that the closet’s once many boxes and hanged clothes were now piled in the three darkened corners behind me. 

I locked my attention back onto the closet. I looked further into the confined space, my view now unobstructed. I couldn’t see the back wall of the closet. I hadn’t realized how much deeper this closet went compared to the supposed matching one in my apartment’s office. I reached out to see how far the back wall sat, my hand disappearing into the inky, ever present shadows of the seemingly endless space, and nearly fucking jumped out of my skin when Miss Janice came rushing into the room, loudly calling my name. She grabbed me by the arm, and began pulling me toward the front door. She was bug-eyed and frantic. Whatever strength we hadn’t seen in the days prior, she had apparently been saving for a moment like this. I nearly tripped over one of her threadbare rugs, and was out the door before I could reconcile with what I had done wrong. 

I still had the bulbs in my hand, and placed them outside Miss Janice’s door, and all but sprinted home.

See, there isn’t much you can do for those resigned to dying. They know they are already licked, that they will have to endure countless days of pain and misery before the end is truly upon them. I’m sure it was hell for her, but watching her wither away did a number on me, too, though I never brought it up to anyone but my wife. 

Like me, she was also distressed by how quickly Miss Janice seemed to be wasting away. I told her what happened when I was attempting to replace the lights, that Miss Janice had been fine one minute, peacefully napping on the couch, then she was up and screaming and crying the next because I was looking into the closet. My wife determined it might be dementia, that Miss Janice might not have a lot of time left, that, if her doctor had been correct, we were approaching the minimum time frame of her four to six month prognosis. She wondered aloud if we should call Miss Janice’s sons and let them know that their mother might not have much time left. I agreed and decided I would call the leasing office the following day and try to get their contact info. 

That night, after filling myself with resolve to do what I could so Miss Janice had family around her as she passed , I found myself in the office, unable to sleep. I tried catching up on some reading, but struggled to focus. The day's events were behind me, but I could still feel the pangs of curiosity I had when looking into the closet. I got up and looked in ours. It was normal, if not a little cramped. No light in it, as was the standard of all the closets in this apartment complex. It had a shelf up high with a bar underneath it for hanging clothes. I reached my hand past the jackets and sweaters that crowded the bar and felt relief as I touched a cold, matte textured wall. 

After nosing around my own closet, I checked my phone and saw that it was midnight. Work came early the next morning, so I made to leave the room, rubbing my eyes and yawning. When I took my hands away, and from the corner of my eye, I noticed Miss Janice’s spare room light had turned on. It hadn’t been lit when I started reading around 10:30 or so, at least I hadn’t seen any signs of wakefulness in her apartment since I had been in it. 

I studied the room, it’s light like a far off, dying beacon. Miss Janice entered the room wearing a long, white night shirt. Her movements seemed robotic and stilted under the yellow intrusion of her ceiling fan’s disparate glow. 

She took her place in front of the closet of her spare room, as if she were a stage actor and that’s where the floor had been marked for her to stand. I could see the shapeless forms of the odds ends stacked in the corners, unmoved from the positions where I last saw them from inside the very space. She must have been at that closet door for two, three minutes before she slowly put her hand on the door knob, and barely opened the closet to a crack wide enough that from my vantage I could see the darkness inside.

Something was moving in the closet.

I couldn’t see what it was, if it was a person or an animal, but there was definite movement, something shifted and flailed about. Miss Janice wasn’t reacting to the movement. From the void within, I could hardly make out a shape taking form. Then there were two shapes. Little orbs danced about, bright and piercing, glowing with the same shine and luster as a brass bell. I drew closer to the window. They were eyes. Large eyes that were ever- growing, as if whoever the eyes belonged to was walking down a long corridor, and they would soon be at the closet’s threshold.

Miss Janice gave this rising action a meager consideration before turning around to look right at me. A somber smile split her face, as if to say, “See. I’m not crazy,” before she broke into what looked like a full body sob. I was at the window, now, my nose almost touching the glass. 

The closet shut itself quick as if whatever inside knew it had been caught. I jumped back at the suddenness, but Miss Janice didn’t even flinch at its slamming, she just stood there, alone in that near empty place, and wept in shudders that almost looked like laughing. 

My head reeled, playing through scenarios. I left the office and stood still in my living room. I made for the door to head to Miss Janice’s, but some deeper, fearful part inside began to convince me to do otherwise. I went back to the office, but the light in Miss Janice’s spare room had been snuffed out. Looking at the nothing contained behind the large window, I felt like I could see those brassy eyes ringing in the darkness. 

I didn’t sleep that night. I laid in bed calling myself all sorts of names in my head for showing such cowardice in the face of a situation that was obviously a danger to Miss Janice. Once the internal beratement ended, a great fear took over as I repeated a mantra in my mind for the rest of the night, until the sun shone from behind the horizon: “Was she crying or was she laughing, was she crying or was she laughing, was she crying or was she—.”

That morning, I left quickly for work, embarrassed by my inaction. And tried really hard not to think about the color of brass. My wife called me at lunch time. She had been crying. 

“Miss Janice died this morning. Sometime around 1 am. I talked to the police. They said they found her face down on the floor of her spare bedroom.”

I was too stunned to speak. Guilt pummeled me in crashing waves. I could hear my wife trying to get my attention. 

“Oh, I’m sorry, I, uh. Why were the police there?”

She chuckled at the cruel joke of it all. “Coincidentally, her sons dropped by for their monthly visit and found her.”

“Jesus. Did, did they say how she died?” I thought of the eyes, how they grew out of the darkness in the closet.

“What do you mean? Aaron, it was the cancer. Her body just gave out.”

“Yeah, yeah. Of course.” I tried stumbling through more words, unsure of how my tongue worked. She spoke up again.

“I know you two were close. Closer than I was to her, at least. I’m sorry, baby. I’m so sorry.”

I wanted to cry, but my mind wouldn’t let me. How could I cry for someone I could have saved?

*I had to separate this post into two parts. My thoughts have always been longwinded, even when I'm morose or panicked. I'll post the other half at an appropriate time tomorrow.*
