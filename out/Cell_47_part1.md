So this is my first post on Reddit and I honestly don't even know why I'm writing this. Maybe I need to get it out somewhere anonymous because I can't talk to anyone about it. Maybe I'm losing my mind. I don't know anymore.

My name is Sarah Chen and I'm 26 years old. I work as a correctional officer in Nevada. Well, I *worked* as a correctional officer at a women's facility in Henderson. Past tense. Because three days ago, everything changed.

Let me back up. I've been in corrections for about two years now. It's not glamorous work but it pays okay and I'm good with computers, which is weirdly useful in prison administration. I handle a lot of the software systems, digital logs, surveillance management, that kind of thing. Most guards just know how to operate the basics, but I can actually troubleshoot and fix things when the system crashes, which happens more than you'd think.

Anyway, I got a call from the Department of Corrections regional office on Monday morning. They said there was an "urgent staffing situation" at Ironwood Correctional Facility—a men's maximum security prison about 90 miles northwest of Vegas, out in the middle of nowhere. One of their guards quit suddenly (they wouldn't say why) and their entire digital security system was having catastrophic failures. They needed someone who could both work as a CO and fix their software problems.

I said no at first. Obviously. A women's prison guard at a men's max security facility? That's insane. But they kept pushing. They said it would only be for two weeks, maybe three, just until they could hire a replacement and get their systems stable. They offered me double my current salary plus hazard pay. And here's the thing—I have student loans that are crushing me. My mom needs help with medical bills. I'm barely scraping by.

So I said yes.

I regretted it the moment I pulled up to Ironwood yesterday morning.

The facility sits in this dried-up valley surrounded by rust-colored hills. There's nothing else out there. No towns nearby. No gas stations. Just the prison, the desert, and this feeling of wrongness that I can't really describe. Like the air is heavier there. Like something is watching.

The building itself is old—built in the 1970s, all concrete and razor wire and guard towers that look like they haven't been properly maintained in decades. As I parked in the staff lot, I noticed how quiet it was. No birds. No insects. Just wind.

I walked up to the main entrance, showed my temporary transfer papers to the guard at the gate. He was an older guy, maybe late 50s, with gray stubble and tired eyes. He looked at my paperwork, then looked at me, then back at the paperwork.

"You're the new transfer?" he asked.

"Yeah. Sarah Chen."

He didn't smile. "You know this is a men's facility, right?"

"I'm aware," I said, trying to sound confident. "I'm here to help with the software systems and cover the guard shortage."

He stared at me for a long moment. Then he just shook his head and buzzed me through.

The interior processing area was standard prison stuff—metal detectors, X-ray scanners, multiple locked doors. But the guards working intake looked... off. Stressed. One of them, a heavy-set guy with a buzz cut, kept glancing at the monitors showing the cell blocks like he expected something to jump out of them.

They gave me my uniform, radio, pepper spray, and baton. Standard issue. Then a younger guard—his name tag said "Morrison"—was assigned to escort me to meet the warden and show me around.

We walked through the first security door into the main corridor. The smell hit me immediately. Every prison has a smell—sweat, industrial cleaner, bad food—but this was different. There was something underneath it. Something metallic and sweet and wrong.

"You get used to it," Morrison said, noticing my expression.

"What is that smell?"

He didn't answer.

We were passing through a section where inmates were being moved to the recreation yard. That's when I first felt the eyes. About forty men in orange jumpsuits, all stopped and staring. At me.

I'm used to being stared at. I'm a woman in corrections. But this was different. This was predatory. Hungry.

"Fresh meat," one of them called out. "Damn, they hiring models now?"

"Yo, sweetheart, you lost?" another one laughed. "Women's prison is the other direction."

I felt my face getting hot. I'm not good with confrontation, especially sexual stuff. I get embarrassed easily, which is basically the worst trait for a prison guard. But I kept my expression neutral and kept walking.

Then one of them—a big guy with a shaved head and a tear tattoo—stepped closer to the bars of the holding area.

"I got something you can guard right here, baby girl," he said, grabbing his crotch. "You wanna do a cavity search? I'll let you get real thorough."

The other inmates erupted in laughter.

Something snapped in me. I get shy, I get flustered, but I have a breaking point. And when I hit it, I lose it.

I walked right up to those bars, so close I could smell his breath.

"You want to say that again?" I asked quietly.

He grinned, thinking he'd won. "I said—"

"Because if you finish that sentence," I interrupted, my voice dropping to a whisper that somehow felt louder than shouting, "I will make absolutely sure that every single guard in this facility knows that you're the inmate who can't follow basic conduct rules around staff. Which means you'll be on red status. No commissary. No phone calls. No rec time. And I'll personally volunteer to process every single one of your requests for the next three weeks, which means they'll all mysteriously get lost in the system. Do you understand me?"

The grin fell off his face.

"I asked if you understand me," I repeated.

"Yeah," he muttered. "Yeah, I got it."

"That's 'Yes, Officer Chen' to you."

"Yes, Officer Chen."

I turned and walked away, my heart hammering. The other inmates were dead silent now.

Morrison was staring at me with wide eyes. "Holy shit," he whispered. "Nobody's ever—I mean, that was—"

"Let's keep moving," I said, my voice shaking slightly now that the adrenaline was fading.

We continued down the corridor. But as we walked away, I heard one of the inmates—not the guy I'd confronted, but someone else further back—say something in a low voice.

"She ain't gonna last. Not once she finds out about the thing."

I stopped walking. "What thing?"

Morrison grabbed my arm. "Nothing. He's just trying to mess with you. Inmates do that."

"What thing?" I repeated, louder.

Morrison wouldn't look at me. "Come on. Warden's waiting."

We walked in silence through two more security checkpoints until we reached the administrative wing. The warden's office was at the end of a hallway lined with filing cabinets and outdated motivational posters.

Warden James Harding was not what I expected. He was in his mid-40s, fit, with an easy smile and an almost inappropriate sense of humor for someone running a maximum security prison. He stood up when I entered and shook my hand firmly.

"Officer Chen! Welcome to Ironwood. Sorry about the mess—we're having a hell of a time with the digital systems. Hope you brought your IT superpowers."

"I'll do my best, sir," I said.

He gestured for me to sit. Morrison stayed standing by the door.

"Look, I'm not going to bullshit you," Harding said, leaning back in his chair. "This is going to be a rough assignment. You're going to be the only female CO in a facility with 847 male inmates. Some of them haven't seen a woman in person in fifteen years. You're going to get comments. You're going to get stares. You're going to get propositions that would make a sailor blush."

"I understand, sir."

"But," he continued, "and I want to be crystal clear about this—you will not be assaulted here. We have protocols. We have systems. Every guard here knows that if a single inmate so much as touches you inappropriately, they'll be in the hole for a month minimum. We don't tolerate that shit."

"I appreciate that, sir."

He smiled. "Course, that doesn't stop them from running their mouths. But I heard you already handled your first encounter like a pro." He glanced at Morrison. "Word travels fast here."

Morrison shrugged.

I took a breath. "Sir, on my way here, one of the inmates mentioned something. He said I wouldn't last because of... 'the thing.' What did he mean by that?"

The temperature in the room seemed to drop.

Warden Harding's smile vanished. His entire demeanor changed in an instant. He leaned forward, his hands flat on the desk, and when he spoke, his voice was cold. Hard. Nothing like the jovial tone from seconds before.

"There is no 'thing,' Officer Chen. Whatever you heard was an inmate trying to get in your head on your first day. It's a tactic. They make up stories, spread rumors, try to spook new guards. You ignore it. Are we clear?"

I swallowed. "Yes, sir."

"Good." And just like that, the smile was back. "Now, let's get you set up with your schedule. You'll be working the evening shift in Cell Block D, 3 PM to 11 PM. Morrison here will train you for the first few days. After that, you'll be on your own. Sound good?"

"Yes, sir."

But it didn't sound good. Because I knew—with absolute certainty—that he was lying.

There was a thing. And whatever it was, it scared a man who ran a maximum security prison.

I left his office with Morrison, my mind racing. We walked back through the corridors toward Cell Block D, where I'd be spending my evenings. The whole way, I wanted to ask Morrison what the inmates meant. What "the thing" was. Why the warden had reacted like that.

But I didn't. Because part of me didn't want to know.

Not yet.

We reached Cell Block D just as the afternoon count was finishing. Three tiers of cells, each one housing two inmates. The noise was deafening—men shouting, metal doors clanging, guards calling out numbers.

Morrison showed me the control station where I'd be monitoring the block. Banks of screens showing different angles. Buttons to control cell doors. Radio for emergencies.

"It's pretty straightforward," Morrison said. "You count every hour. You monitor for fights. You process requests for things like medical, phone calls, and meetings with counselors. Most of the time it's boring as hell."

"Most of the time?" I asked.

He didn't answer that either.

As I stood there, looking at the screens, I noticed something odd. Cell 47, on the third tier, was empty. Not just empty of inmates—it was completely bare. No bunks. No toilet. Nothing. Just gray concrete.

"Why is that cell empty?" I asked.

Morrison glanced at the screen, saw which cell I meant, and his jaw tightened. "That cell's not in use."

"Why not? You're short on space, right?"

"It's just not in use. Don't worry about it."

"Morrison—"

"Look," he said, turning to face me. "You seem cool. Tougher than you look. So I'm going to give you some advice. Do your job. Keep your head down. Don't ask questions about things that don't concern you. And whatever you do, don't go near cell 47."

"Why?" I pressed.

He opened his mouth to answer. Then his radio crackled.

"Morrison, we need you in Block A. Inmate down."

He grabbed his radio. "Copy. On my way." He looked at me. "You good here? Your shift doesn't start for another hour. You can use that time to look around, get familiar with the controls."

"I'm fine," I said.

"Alright. I'll check on you later." He paused at the door. "Remember what I said. Don't go near 47."

Then he was gone.

I stood there alone in the control room, surrounded by monitors showing men in cages. The sun was setting outside the narrow windows, casting long shadows across the cell block.

That's when I heard it.

A sound coming from the speakers connected to cell 47.

Even though the cell was empty.

A sound like breathing.

But not human breathing.

Something else.

I know this sounds crazy. I know you're probably thinking I'm making this up or that I'm just spooked because it's a new environment. Maybe you're right. Maybe I am just psyching myself out.

But I'm sitting here in my motel room 20 miles from Ironwood, and I can't shake this feeling that I've made a terrible mistake. That there's something wrong with that prison. Something that has nothing to do with the inmates.

I go back tomorrow for my second shift.

I don't want to go.

But I need this money.

I'll update if anything else happens.

If I can.

**UPDATE**: It's 2:47 AM and I can't sleep. I keep thinking about that breathing sound. I've been researching Ironwood Correctional Facility online but there's almost nothing about it. No news stories. No scandals. It's like it doesn't exist outside of official DOC records.

I did find one thing though. An obituary from six months ago for a correctional officer named David Reeves. He worked at Ironwood for three years.

Cause of death: suicide.

He's the one whose position I'm filling.
