I ain’t a good man. I will readily admit that now. If you had caught me a few decades back I like as not would have given you some Robin Hood bullshit right before I drew down on you. Though I have tried like hell to change my ways, and found some absolution along the way, I’ve found we cannot fight the past. Leastways, we cannot fully beat it.

Perhaps my final act of contrition can be to warn the rest of y’all about *him*.

You see, this all ended where it began; with a good old-fashioned American robbery.

The cadre I was in had just hightailed it down to Arizona after becoming a little too notorious in our Midwestern stomping grounds. I was eighteen then, I think, and with a mind ripe for chaos.

The dishonor of leadership belonged to a silverbeard veteran known only as “the Skipper,” and his M.O. had long been the fine art of transport robbery. Tail the local crew, figure out their product, and most importantly where and when they make their runs. Straightforward work and easy for our apathetic consciousnesses to justify. We rarely had even a minor hiccup.

Until the day we met the fiend who called himself Scratch.

By some combination of bad intel and our impulsive nature or perhaps an act of the Almighty, the street crew we held up some fifty miles outside of Yuma turned out to be a chapter of the hardass Native Disciples.

They were more than ready for even a practiced group of rough riders such as ourselves and took great pleasure in ambushing the ambushers. Three of our number fell dead a minute into the holdup. Davey, our point man had his entrails blown clear of his stomach by some meanass double-0 buck while his brother Lou’s brains met the scorching road courtesy of a 30-30.

Good God but I can still smell that grey matter sizzling like scrambled eggs when they hit the asphalt. Haven’t been able to so much as look at the food since.

Old Ray got stitched across the back as he turned to run for cover, ragdolling face-first into a crop of prickly saguaro never to rise.

The rest of us fought back as best we could, downing some of theirs until more of ours got grazed, including myself and the Skip. We were wholly outmatched this time. That, and we were fast running short on rounds not having expected such ace resistance. We bid a retreat back to our own vehicles and took off into the desert, the Disciples hotter on our heels than the afternoon sun.

When we came upon the lonesome shack we decided then and there to make our stand. I didn’t much want to die there among the cacti and the creosote, but I wasn’t sure that I cared enough *not* to. Besides, I figured going out with my boots on was a better way than most men got.

With eight of us left and half bleeding freely, we poured into the abode to take up firing positions. Right dead center in the main room of the two-room wooden bungalow sat the rangy pale figure who later introduced himself as Scratch.

I dunno about the others, but I believe whatever good part of me that remained could sense what the bastard was even then.

“Good morn to you, gentlemen!” he said with a smile as if greeting an old friend. “In somewhat of a violent predicament, I take it?”

The Skipper drew his Redhawk and for a second I thought I’d see the stranger’s pale face turn to red mush much like Lou’s had. As the two men stared into each other’s souls, I noticed a glazed sort of look come over Skip's face and he holstered his wheelgun. I wish I had urged the boss then and there to slay the stranger where he sat.

The towering man just smiled and stood upright from where he was seated in front of what appeared to be a sizeable workshop bench. The thing stood as tall as the shack itself and near as long against the wall, covered in drawers and tools and material of all variety. The Skipper displayed his typical laconicism and talked with his eyes.

Unlike the rest of us himbos who so often annoyed our leader, the stranger seemed to immediately pick up on each unspoken word.

All the while we could hear the purring engines and horrible war-whoops of the troop of Native Disciples edging closer and closer, our doom following with them.

The boys were busy cursing our fate as I watched the outsized stranger move with a quickness that belied his great frame around that equally great workbench. Like a practiced dancer the figure who would introduce himself as Scratch bent to open drawers and stretched to grab tools, producing tubes and powders and bolts of all manners.

He noticed me observing his actions and that grin only widened. Sweat began to bead down my face in increasingly weightier droplets. Whether they were from the heat, impending doom, or this Hephaestian hermit I could not tell.

His elongated fingers worked with a precision that made even our best lockpicker seem pitiful. I don’t know how he managed the feat, but by the time the Disciples had pulled up to our little hideaway the man had created about a dozen odd-looking cylindrical devices and began distributing them.

As he spoke I truly believed that I could feel the boards beneath my boots reverberate with his weighty tones.

“Now then, gentlemen,” Scratch proclaimed, “Now come take part in your own salvation!”

Aside from the Skip and myself, none of my comrades had witnessed the man’s devilish skill and instead eagerly took the pipe bombs in hand like children do candy. I saw their hardened faces go giddy at the possibility of survival.

Our enemies were creeping forward toward the bungalow in a crescent formation when our self-proclaimed savior nodded at us and moved toward the door. Jeering cries and the promise of tortures long forgotten to outsiders rang out amongst the sagebrush.

“When the moment arrives, sirs, take advantage and let fly,” he said opening the door.

I thought the madman was looking to get himself shot to shit in some delusional sacrifice but to me and my companions’ utter shock, the two dozen rival roughnecks froze dead in their tracks at the sight of him.

One exceptionally broad Navajo man broke the spell and stepped forward. His ochre face paint glistened in the sun’s meridian and his engraved hunting rifle was now pointed down at the maroon dirt instead of the moon-skinned giant in front of him.

“Who the fuck are *you*, white boy? Didn’t see you with the others,” the rival boss asked with a glower.

“My name is Scratch, sir. The others, meaning no offense I am sure, have little wish to commune for fear of losing their heads,” our savior replied.

The equally herculean Navajo man sputtered out a laugh and his cronies followed suit. Meanwhile, the Skipper motioned for us to prime the fuses.

“You speak too much nonsense in too hot of sun! I will be generous though,” the man continued. “I will give you exactly ten seconds to get out my way ‘fore I bury you with the rest of these fools. *Hoka hey!*”

Scratch howled in a way that made even the man opposite him seem diminutive.

“Mato, oh dear young Mato, did you never *once* pay attention to your grandfather’s wisdom at those fires late at night? Have you lost your path so profoundly that you do not even know that that is a *Sioux* warcry?”

At the hermit’s words, the man I now knew as Mato froze in place as if the desert had suddenly shifted to an arctic tundra. His coffee eyes went wide in terror and his arms stiff as planks, dropping that handsome rifle onto the hard ground. The ganger’s minions had fallen under the same spell as their boss, their heads and arms now hanging lazily and their eyes harboring the glaze that I had seen in the Skip’s.

“You…it’s *you*,” Mato began, “I’ve heard-I know what you ar–”. I never heard the rest of what Mato might have revealed, for right then the first of our devices detonated.

Our resident ex-chaplain, Chente, had cast the first bomb. Even at the moment, I found it ironic as the former holy man was certainly not without sin.

His IED exploded with a fury just a few inches behind the entranced Mato. The large man was thrown up and forward, the mighty blast tearing through his flesh from back to front.

The rest of us launched each of our bombs in turn, those finely crafted cylinders of death landing amongst Mato’s followers and upon their hateful outbursts showered Scratch in a deluge of gore. Flesh and blood and teeth and bone crashed down upon the land. It seemed as if the crimson rain would never cease.

My fellows were busy cheering as men saved from the hangman do and were far too elated in their unexpected victory to care to notice how Scratch lifted his arms up to the heavens in a grim sort of worship, bathing in the fountain of red and violence. How he also remained untouched from the savage explosions themselves I could not guess.

I shuddered at the macabre sight, feeling that we had just indebted ourselves to something wicked even though I knew that to rebuke his gift would have meant my own gruesome end. It was a feeling that only amplified as the months with Scratch went on, and one that would come to its crescendo in a little Wyoming town.

The Skipper motioned for us to follow him outside to that wretched scene and without hesitation began murdering the survivors. No writhing or begging stayed him nor most the rest of my then-comrades. I hung back. For his part Scratch stayed quiet, crossing the distance to the messy stain that was Mato’s legacy upon the formerly pristine land.

He bent down, that great frame bowing low to that stain and I saw his mouth move, though I could not hear his words. He picked up the dead man’s rifle, somehow unharmed, its polished etchings catching the fading light enough to strike me blind.

I massaged my eyes, and when sight returned the first thing I saw was Scratch staring me dead in the eyes. Perhaps even then he saw the hesitancy within me as I believe I saw was truly within him.

While the boys looted the fallen and their cargo, the beast of a man still covered in the blood-rain glided over to where I stood just at the edge of the soaked ground. He put his paw on my shoulder and the look he gave me brought a trembling throughout my body like I was some desert bighorn facing down a puma.

“Would you not take part in this sacred celebration?” Scratch asked of me, the wetness on his hand leaking into my shirt.

“What’s sacred ‘bout blowing up some men?” I asked.

He smiled, or perhaps he had never stopped smiling.

“Death is sacred in all of its forms, and to play its agent is arguably the most sacred act of all,” he replied.

“You’re fuckin’ nuts.”

The smile remained.

“It makes little difference what you or I or even the ex-holy man there thinks of Death nor of how it comes about,” the rangy man declared, “‘for it endures all the same, and will endure long after you are gone from this earth.”

“And you.”

“Perhaps. In the meanwhile, set yourself upon the path laid before you, and take pride in it being a far more exalted one than most folk have enough intestinal fortitude to walk.”

For a moment I swore I could see the man’s eyes shift into the blazing yellow of a snake, his pupils going narrow and tall. It took all of my willpower to not piss myself as those infernal eyes bored into me. Through me.

Mercifully, Scratch turned and left me there, shaken and utterly perplexed.

Where his hand had rested left in its wake a vast print of burgundy speckled with bits of scorched viscera. I twitched at the sight and tried desperately to brush it off my shoulder to little gain. It felt almost as if the man had put his mark on me.

I reflected on those diabolic orbs and manic ramblings long into the next few nights as our crew fled the region to fresher pastures. Scratch was ever at the Skipper’s ear, always whispering to our increasingly silent leader. We were in a constant state of revelry that week, flush with both cash and the sensation of immortality, and none aside from myself and the ex-chaplain saw this.

Had I known then where it all would lead, I would have listened to my gut then and picked an opportunity to flee into the darkest hours of the night.

As I sit here decades later putting this all to paper with nothing but whiskey and dread for company, I can say with assurance that had I done so, my fate and the fates of the others would have been far, far different.
