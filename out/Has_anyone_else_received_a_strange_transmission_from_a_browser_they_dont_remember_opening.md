Hello. I'm writing this because I don't know if it was a dream, an error in my mind... or something more real than I want to accept.

This happened two nights ago. I don't use the Dark Web, TOR, or weird VPNs. I'm pretty normal, I work at home, I have no knowledge of hacking or anything like that. But what happened left me sleepless ever since.

I was working on my laptop, around 2:30 a.m. I had a YouTube tab open with instrumental music in the background, and I was writing a report for my job. Suddenly, the screen went black for a split second, as if I had reset the graphics card.

When he returned, there was an open window that he didn't recognize. It wasn't Chrome, nor Firefox, nor Edge. It was like an old interface, from the 90s, gray, without any logo or buttons. Just a window in the middle with a video player that said “LIVE - PRIVATE SESSION” and a counter.

I thought it was a popup or malware, so I tried to close it... but it didn't respond. Neither the mouse nor the keyboard. And then the video started.

The camera was fixed on a red room. There was no sound, just a low hum. In the center, a chair. And in it... someone sitting, with a bag on his head. He didn't move. The broadcast lasted exactly 1 minute and 47 seconds. Then it closed by itself. As if nothing.

I thought it was a virus, so I turned off the laptop and had it checked by a technician the next day. He found no trace of that browser, no history, no cookies, absolutely nothing to indicate that something had been opened. He even reviewed hidden processes. Nothing.

Here's the worst: when I checked the security cameras in my room, you can clearly see how I'm working on the laptop... and suddenly I remain completely still for almost 2 minutes. I don't blink, I don't move a finger. I'm just there, staring at the screen, like I'm hypnotized.

Since then, I've had nightmares where I'm in that same red room, and there's someone behind the camera, watching me.

Last night, when I woke up to the noise of notifications, I checked my laptop. It was off, but the fan was spinning as if it were in use. The screen was black, but illuminated, and in the reflection of the room, I swear I saw a figure standing behind me… although when I turned, there was no one. Still, the chair in front of the laptop moved slowly, as if someone had just gotten up from it.

The strangest thing is that today, when I was checking my laptop's history, I found a new file, with no name, no extension, that appeared a few hours ago. When I tried to open it, the screen turned red and a message appeared in white letters:
“We are watching you.”

I don't know what to do, or who to turn to. I'm starting to fear that this isn't going to end soon... or that it hasn't even really started.

I write it here because I no longer know if it was a hack, a mental attack... or something else.
Has anyone experienced something similar? Are there similar cases?
