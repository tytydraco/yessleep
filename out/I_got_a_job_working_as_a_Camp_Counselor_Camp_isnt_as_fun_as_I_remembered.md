Looking back, some of my best memories as a kid were during the time I spent in summer camp. The time spent hiking in the woods, kayaking on the water, late night campfires with endless s’mores, and getting into hijinks with the friends I made at camp. My favorite of these childhood hijinks were the attempts to scare each other with scary stories and the pinnacle of childhood rites of passage, playing Bloody Mary.

As I outgrew the age of going to summer camp, I always looked back fondly on that time for the good times I had and how the camp counselors had always been there to make sure everyone had a great summer.

At the end of my junior year of college, with the dread of having to go back to my parents’ home to spend endless hours helping my dad work through a midlife crisis or the endless questions from my mom asking about my dating life, I was saved by the suggestion from my roommate Eric about the summer camp he worked at needing more counselors this year. The opportunity was a golden ticket for me, and a chance to bring the same joy that I was brought as a kid. After an unbearable weekend at my parents’ house, Eric picked me up in his Jeep and we were off to the summer camp we would be working at for the next seven weeks.

“You’re gonna love Camp Stonebrook, man,” Eric said as we turned on the highway on-ramp. “I’ve been coming to this place every year since I was like nine.”

“Damn, I knew you were a little slow, but I would think there would be an age limit before they told you you couldn’t keep attending camp,” I jested as we merged with traffic.

“Asshole, I started as a counselor as soon as I was too old to attend,” Eric said, tossing his empty can of Monster at me while we both chortled. 

“Nah, that’s awesome Eric. I loved camp as a kid, I’m glad you told me about this. I don’t think I could have spent another summer with my mom and dad. Mom was already trying to set me up with one of her friend’s daughters and Dad was talking about restoring his old Ford.” I let out a breath of relief as I reclined back in the passenger seat.

“Your mom still in denial?” Eric said flatly, as he flashed his highbeams at the person doing 50 in the fastlane. 

“You know how parents can be…”

A moment of silence was shared between Eric and myself. I had recently come to terms with my sexuality and after sharing the revelation with Eric he had told me about how he had been thrown out of the house by his Dad when they had learned of his sexual identity. Eric and I had spent many long hours talking about our revelations and while our relationship had remained platonic, I always felt a sliver of tension between Eric and Myself when the topic of sex would come up.

“I don’t want to focus on that,” Eric said, breaking the awkward silence. “We’re going to camp to have fun, help kids have a great summer, and of course celebrate someone’s 21st birthday!”

“I don’t know how much celebrating we’re going to be able to do at camp,” I replied as Eric shook me side to side with one hand.

“Oh, don’t worry about that, I got plenty of party supplies before I stopped to pick you up.”

“You going to be able to keep those bottles unopened for two weeks, or are you going to have to sneak away to buy more?”

“I can hold off a couple of weeks without drinking it all, plus I got a lot of bottles anyways. We have to bring your birthday in with a bash, plus several of the other counselors will have stuff too. The camp is miles away from the nearest gas station or liquor store and Sue would probably blow a gasket if one of the counselors drove off in the middle of the night for a beer run.”

Sue was the director of Camp Stonebrook, a massive camp that catered to boys and girls from ages nine to fifteen. She was a pleasant person over the phone and made the entire process of applying almost effortless. With the recommendation from Eric and email of my driver’s license and social, I was called back with an acceptance a couple weeks later. Everything about the camp was described in vivid detail by Eric during those last two weeks of college. 

Camp Stonebrook, set in a wooded area with plenty of trails, waterfalls, streams, creeks, and limestone caverns, was one of the top four camps in the state. It featured all of the classic camp activities that I remembered from my youth plus an end of season bonfire that Eric said was the closest to a religious experience he has ever had.

While all of the summer camps I had gone to as a kid were faith based, it was nice that I would have a chance to work at a place where I didn’t have to push religion onto children. Not that I didn’t enjoy that aspect as a child as I am still devoutly Lutheran, I didn’t want to push faith onto kids like an evangelical hypocrite. 

After a couple hours passed with the sharing of stories of fun experiences at camp, we exited the highway and stopped at a gas station to stretch our legs. After the quick pit stop, we began our final approach to camp. Eric told me about one little quirk about the camp after we were rolling again.

“So, there is a little…Urban Legend…Cryptid…Scary Story that is commonly told by the counselors at the camp. It's a tradition that has been told since my grandad went to camp decades ago,” Eric said, the eagerness in his voice nearly bursting out.

“Tell me, what is the big bad monster of Stonebrook? Is it a Werewolf? A Vampire? The Frogman? Maybe a Wendigo? Oooh, Tell me it’s a vicious Skinwalker disguising itself as another one of the counselors.”

“No, no, no, nothing as cool as that,” Eric said laughing. “It’s this ghost called The Hangman that lurks around the caverns that looks for runaway criminals that try to hide in the caverns in camp grounds. It is just a story that the counselors tell the campers because it is the hangout where we go to drink and smoke away from any prying eyes. I’ll let Jen tell you her version of the story since it is probably the best. You’re free to put together your own version, just try to make it as scary as possible. The campers will be too petrified to go anywhere near that place.”

As we entered the camp and parked outside of the Admin Building, we were immediately greeted by Sue who was waving at us as a group of our fellow counselors were already moving about with the set up of the camp. Boxes open with various decorations spilling out were scattered around, some of the other counselors were already grabbing some of the items and setting off further into camp. A tall brunette standing next to her caught my eye as I exited the Jeep.

“Welcome to Camp Stonebrook! It is so great to see you both! I’m so glad that you’ll be joining the team this summer!” Sue exclaimed with an infectious smile and bubbly personality that bordered on clinically insane. 

“Hi, uhh, it’s great to be here,” I replied, caught off-guard by the assault of joy and colorful flair littering the vest that Sue wore.

“This is Kyle,” Sue said as she pulled the tall brunette forward. “This is his first year as a counselor too!” I hope you both learn a lot and have as much fun as possible! There’s a lot to do before the campers get here. Eric, would you mind?”

Sue rushed over to Eric and the two off towards one of the nearby buildings, one of the boxes overflowing with blue and green quickly placed in his arms. Kyle and I stood in awkward silence as everyone else rushed around us, clearly already assigned tasks that they eagerly were working on.

“I don’t think I have been able to get a word in with her since I got here,” Kyle said leaning against the fence in front of the Jeep.

“She seems like she is in a thousand places at once, while her mind is in a million more,” I stated, looking around at the camp and wondering if I should wait here or start exploring around the camp for what I was supposed to do.

“Why don't we head over to the dining hall. I am pretty sure that the group working on it could really use the help,” Kyle suggested, clearly aware of my uncertainty at what I should be doing.

We both made our way over to the dining hall, making small talk about our excitement over camping and the fond memories we had going to camp as kids. As soon as we entered the dining hall, we were quickly swept up in the rush of setting up for the campers that would be arriving in a couple days. The busy movements of everyone gave little time to talk beyond the quick exchanging of pleasantries and remaining tasks to be done.

As the day wound down to a close, Sue called for everyone to gather in the dining hall, a large stack of pizzas splayed before us. I had felt like it was a non-stop series of tasks one after the other and the smell of the pizza already had my stomach roaring in anticipation.

“I wanted to take a moment to thank you all for the hard work you have all put in,” Sue began as the crowd of hungry all stared in anticipation. Only myself and the other new counselors seemed to talk among the crowd.

“Before you all dig in, I want you to each grab one of these little plastic eggs,” She cheered, holding one of the eggs before dropping it in the basket. “Inside you will find your color, animal, and age group for the summer. This will be your…team that you will be working with as you compete against the other teams. As a reminder for last year’s counselors and for the new recruits this year; Your matching color will be your allies and who you should lean on for any help that you should need throughout your time here. Remember to do your very best to be our top team of the season as you compete against one another. Now that we have that out of the way, thank you all again and dig in!”

The dining hall erupted with the sound of hungry young adults grabbing food and their plastic eggs. After I grabbed my own, I sat down with Kyle and Eric as well as Jen and another girl I had met earlier named Sarah. As we began eating and discussing the day’s work, Eric nudged me and nodded towards Kyle. I kicked him before shaking my head before turning my attention to the group.

“So what are your teams for the summer?” I asked as I opened my own egg.

“I got the Blue Foxes for age 13,” Eric said with a dorky smile.

“Green Frogs for age 11,” Sarah said between a mouthful of pizza.

“I have the Purple Squirrels for age 9,” Kyle said with a light chuckle.

“Look at that. I’ve got the Purple Deer for age 11,” Jen stated. “Looks like we will be teammates this year, new guy.”

“What about you Jake? What did you get?”

“The Purple Porcupines, age 13 as well.” I said trying to hold in my excitement at being teammates with Kyle.

“Oh, I get two newbies this year,” Jen said as she glanced at us both. “We’ll have to kick major butt this year. Especially you Kyle.”

“Why is that?” Kyle asked with slight confusion in his voice.

“The Purple Squirrels were the Big Losers of last year, kind of a cursed team to get.” Jen said lackadaisically.

“That’s just because they didn’t have me on the team before.” Kyle said, giving a mock Hercules pose.

Our table laughed at the gesture and we returned to eating, idly chatting about the day and about the excitement for when the campers would arrive. The conversation bounced around the different activities that we would be doing and about the various competitions that would be held throughout the summer. It was during a lul in the talking that Eric suggested to Jen to tell her version of the Hangman story.

“Well if you insist, just make sure to make it your own when you tell your group. You might want to tone it down a bit for your guys, Kyle.” Jen said before starting her story. “Back during the late 1800s, this camp was a little logging town. Back in those days, they treated criminals a lot more harshly, but due to the small size of the town, they were reliant on recruiting their executioner from out of town. They did this because no one wanted to live next door to the guy that killed the criminals. Hiring a Hangman who would do the job dispationally gave an air of justice that was not fueled by the fury of a mob. Well when one of these Hangmen came into town to take care of the thieves and outlaws that had filled the jail of the small town, he wasn’t quick to leave when the job was done. It wasn't long before the people noticed that townsfolk were coming up missing. The town came to the conclusion that the stranger in town was the one responsible. As they confronted the Hangman, the accusations were denied, but the people of the town forced their way into his wagon. Inside they found the mounted scalps of the missing townsfolk. The Hangman fled from the people, escaping into the caves that linger nearby. Despite the efforts of the town, they were unable to locate the man. Hoping that they had sufficiently scared the man off, they returned to town to carry on their lives. Despite their efforts, a new problem arose in the town. Whenever someone in town would break a law or would do a misdeed, it wasn't long after that their dangling bodies were found hanging from a tree. Despite the efforts of the town, they were never able to catch The Hangman. One day the remaining townsfolk abandoned the town, but the rumors that a man dwells in the caves, waiting to punish rule breakers and thieves…”

Jen concluded her story to a series of clapping and applauding of the other counselors around us. Several of the other counselors slipped off to tell their own versions of the story.

With the night coming to a close, Eric led Kyle and Myself over to the Purple Cabins, our bags in tow. He explained that the cabins were grouped up by ages with the nine and ten-year-olds having their own cabins, eleven and twelve having their own, and thirteen through fifteen being grouped together as they usually had the fewest campers. It would still be nice as the older kids usually had the biggest cabin and a few more amenities than the cabins for the younger kids.

As I walked over to the section of the cabin labeled “13” I found a box of purple decorations and several porcupine pictures printed out. I smiled at the cartoonist depiction and sat on what would be my bed for the coming weeks when I glanced out the window. Eric had waved at Kyle and was walking away when someone caught his attention. While I couldn't see the other person, whatever the conversation was had brought a wide smile to his face. Instead of walking towards the individual, and closer to the Blue Cabins, he walked off towards the woods.

I found it strange that he would spend his first night back getting into mischief, so I went out to see what he could be doing. Just as I returned to the main hall of the cabin, I was stopped by the other counselors of Purple Cabin 13-15 carrying a collection of their bags.

Francis and Wyatt had begun the bombardment of welcomes and questions and it wasn't long before Eric was far from my mind. We talked late into the night and at the shock of the time, Francis suggested that we turn in before the long day ahead. Lying down, I glanced at my watch to see that it was nearly three in the morning. After an exhausted sigh I closed my eyes only for them to shoot back open as a strange sensation of being watched overcame me. My eyes darting over to the window caught nothing but the sensation remained. Looking out the window revealed nothing but I still grabbed a blanket off of one of the nearby beds and haphazardly covered the window. With a slight uneasiness, I laid back in bed and soon drifted off into a troubled sleep.

The days before the campers arrived followed the same pattern. I would wake up and head over to the dining hall and try out the latest recipe the kitchen staff had concocted before brushing my teeth and finding out what I needed to do for the day. Around lunchtime, I would meet up with Eric and Kyle for a quick sandwich before going back out to the task at hand. I would meet up with Francis or Wyatt and go over the basic rules for the campers and work on my version of “The Hangman” before returning to the dining hall. The counselors would all gather in and Sue would update us on our progress with her usual cheery tone before giving us the countdown before the campers arrived. After we finished eating, Jen and Eric would show Kyle and Myself the mapped out trails we should use for our groups. Once night began to creep in, I would get a shower and return to my cabin, exhausted but happy with the progress of the day. 

Before I would turn in I would try and scroll through my phone, but because of the campsite’s spotty reception, I was forced to sit atop the bunk bed closest to the window to get even a single bar. From my spot I could just barely see over the top of the curtains I had put up the second day there. Just after 1am every night I could see a few of the other counselors walking off towards the woods. Despite my questioning of Eric and a few of the other counselors I had grown comfortable enough to ask, they either denied going in or simply suggesting that some of the counselors were sneaking off for a late night stroll. Eric had suggested that the cavern he had mentioned before was likely completely stocked with booze and that some of the counselors were getting their fun in before camp officially started. My questioning of his activity that first night was met with dismissal and that he had snuck his stash over there during the daytime.

“Trust me, after a few days of dealing with the campers, you'll be dying for a chance to unwind. Some of the counselors won't get a break due to the need for constant adult presence. You're lucky enough that the kids in your cabin are fairly self-sufficient. Poor Kyle will likely have very few chances for a break. Plus, Wyatt and Francis will be more than happy to cover for you when you need a night off as long as you cover for them,” Eric said the evening before the campers arrived. 

“It's just been annoying to have people creeping by the window late at night,” I replied, thinking about the feeling of being watched every night since I arrived.

“It'll pass, you'll see tomorrow. Once the kids get here, everyone will be too busy for late night prowling.”

Kyle offered for me to join him for a hike with him as I was making my way back to my cabin. Since meeting him, I had wanted a chance to spend some one on one time and this seemed like the perfect opportunity. We strolled out by the purple cabins, noticing a few of the other counselors out enjoying the last night before the campers arrived. We talked about the interest in working at the camp and I learned that a friend of Kyle’s had also mentioned working at this place. We shared a laugh about the camp having a great way of recruiting friends to work there. We found our way towards one of the trails and followed it until it reached a stream that flowed from the cave where Eric and other counselors stashed things away. Looking up, I saw that starlit sky and gestured to Kyle. We gazed up into the sky, drawing closer to one another. Right as I was about to ask him if he was seeing anyone, the sound of a large tree branch cracking and falling echoed around us.  With a slight start I jumped at the disturbance, drawing a laugh from Kyle about my reaction. Feeling as though the moment was ruined, I suggested we turn in for the night. With a nod we returned to our cabins, disappointment and regret carried me into slumber. 

The next day was filled with the overwhelming excitement of campers’ first day at camp. I was swept up with the squall of campers wanting to do as much as possible during the first day. Despite my assurances that we would have time to do everything, I was busy until late that night, after finally calming the boys down long enough for them to finally turn in for the night, I stepped out onto the front porch of the cabin with Wyatt. We discussed the day and the energy of the camp when a strange smell distracted me from the conversation. I turned back to the cabin, mentioning the smell to Wyatt.

“What smell?” Wyatt said with a smirk, a look of confusion across his face.

“Do you not smell that? It’s like someone is burning cedar and vanilla and something…else,” I said, standing up and stepping towards the smell. 

“Seriously, I don’t smell anything at all. Are you imagining it?”

“No way, the smell is too unique to just imagine,” I answered, the smell growing slightly stronger as I stepped from the porch to ground in front of the cabin. The slight smell of iron and decay resting just below the cedar and vanilla. 

I rounded the cabin, following the smell back towards the center of camp. As I passed the other cabins, the sensation of everyone watching me rose in my mind. I tried to ignore the feeling when I stopped dead before the large fire pit behind the dining hall.

Standing in a circle around the fire pit, at least ten counselors including Eric, were chanting something low as a wrapped bundle at least four feet long burned at the stake. It wriggled and writhed as the flames licked at the bottom of the canvas. As the scream caught in my throat, I stumbled forward. My eyes connected with the void filled eyes of Eric before everything went dark.

I sat up gasping for breath. My sudden movement startled some of the drowsy campers in my room. They turned to me with childish guilt stricken across their faces. Worry that I was about to yell at them for disturbing my sleep was plastered across their faces. I jumped to my feet and stepped out of the room with words of apology for jumping awake. Rushing to the small bathroom in the cabin, I splashed the cold water on my face from the running water and looked at my reflection in the mirror. 

Did I just have a nightmare? Or did that really happen?

The questions lingered in my mind as I splashed more water in my face. I turned the tap off and bowed my head, staring at the drain of the sink, when a soft knock at the door caused me to jerk my head back up.

“You okay in there?” The voice asked.

“Yeah, all good in here.” I answered, wiping the water from my face.

“Just making sure, one of your boys said you had jumped out of bed and gave him a real freight,” The voice said through the door.

“Wyatt?” I asked as I went to open the door.

“Yeah?” Wyatt asked back.

“Did we talk last night?” I asked as soon as the door was opened.

“Probably no more than a few words,” Wyatt replied with a look of concern on his face. “You got back with your group pretty late last night. You looked completely bushed. I was worried if you’d even make it to your bed before passing out.”\

“Yeah, I had been completely wiped. I think I was worried I had overslept,” I said, trying to reassure him. The thoughts of the strange dream lingering in my mind.

I passed by Wyatt, doing my best to act as though I wasn’t frightened awake by a nightmare. When I returned back to the room with my group, I apologized for waking with such a start. I explained, for myself just as much as them, that I had jumped awake worried that we had missed breakfast. My words were received with more acceptance by the boys than it was by myself. A few minutes later we were all off to the dining hall for breakfast.

As we neared the hall, I glanced at the fire pit. There were no signs that it had been used last night. I shook my head and marched forward, trying to shake the memory of the dream from my mind and instead think about the fishing and archery that I would be leading my group in for the day.

The rest of that week passed in a blur, every day was filled with camp activities that kept me busy from waking until I crashed at the end of the day. The strange dreams did not stop however. 

Every night I dreamed of that first nightmare. Each time I approached a bonfire surrounded by other counselors. The details of the dream grew with more and more clarity each time. I became aware of the fact that none of the other counselors wore purple. That the canvas surrounding the wriggling form had been purple slowly growing black as the flames leapt across the material and set it ablaze. Despite the terror of the sight, I would draw closer and closer to the scene. In the latest dream, I had made it all the way beside Eric who gestured for me to stand beside him. In the dream, I asked what was inside the canvas bag only to be answered with the words…

…The Big Loser.

I had gotten better at not jumping awake from the recurring nightmare. I had repeatedly told myself that I was just scaring myself with worry for no reason. I had just needed a chance to take a break. Which I would finally have a chance to that night. 

I was about to turn 21 and Francis and Wyatt would cover for me so that I could meet up with Eric at the cave to celebrate with some of the other counselors. Throughout the day, I did my best to only think about the coming night of revelry. With great fortune, I was able to push the memory of the recurring nightmare from my thoughts. As evening approached, Francis offered to take my group with his own so that I could grab a shower and meet up with Eric.

Since camp had started, I had very little time to talk with Eric and even less time to talk with Kyle. With any luck, the little birthday party would be a chance to catch up with Eric and to further my progress with Kyle. As dusk gave way to the night, I raced up to Eric who had been talking with Kyle just before the trail towards the cave.

“About time,” Eric said with a smile as I approached them.

“Yeah, yeah,” I said back, waving him off.

“I was starting to get worried you were going to ditch your own birthday party,” Eric said smacking my back before put a hand on my shoulder and guiding me forward.

“Not a chance.”

Eric took the lead walking ahead after I gave him a pleading look. I slowed my pace and walked alongside Kyle.

“I’ve been so busy I haven’t had a chance to ask…” I began wanting to ask the question since meeting Kyle. My face grew slightly pink after my hand brushed against Kyle’s. I was glad that it was dark enough outside to mask my slight embarrassment but I stumbled over my words and asked something less personal. “How’s camp been going for you?” 

“Oh…fine I guess,” Kyle answered, a slight hesitation to my question. Was it a look of disappointment at my question or something else?

“That’s good, pretty much the same for me. I just wish I could get some decent sleep.”

“Tell me about it, I keep having these wild dreams every night. For a second I thought I was going mad,” Kyle replied with an exasperated sigh.

“Wild Dreams?”

“Yeah, I think it is just nerves,” Kyle said before looking up at the sky. “Propably just worried about doing a good job or something. I’ve been really looking forward to this, y’know? A chance to not obsess over doing a good job and relax.”

A thought occurred to me as I slowed down to a near stop. “Does the dream involve something with a bonfire and large bag?”

Kyle stopped as well, his look of puzzlement matched my own.

“Yeah…How did you know?” Kyle asked.

Before I could answer Eric yelled from up ahead. “Hurry up, you two lovebirds! This alcohol ain’t gonna drink itself!”

We rushed ahead and entered the cave, our conversation temporarily on hold as we ducked under a low hanging rock to the lantern lit enclosure with Jen and Sarah already laughing along with several of the other counselors. Drinks in the hands of everyone and laughter echoing off the walls. As Kyle and I joined the rest of the group, Jen handed Kyle a drink and Eric began to hand me one before stopping and lifting his watch up.

“You’ve got about 2 more minutes to go,” Eric said, pulling the drink back towards himself.

“Oh come on, I hardly think a couple minutes really matters,” I said leaning forward to take the drink from Kyle.

“Hey, I don’t make the rules. I don’t want to be the one encouraging underage drinking,” Eric said, lifting the drink over his head as he stared at his watch.

When I finally was able to grab the drink from Eric, he shouted out, “Happy Birthday, Jacob!”

The words were echoed by everyone else in the cave before a horrible rendition of the Happy Birthday Song was sung by everyone. After the singing had thankfully come to an end, I threw the drink back before grimacing at the taste.

The taste of flowers, iron and gin flooded my mouth, causing me to gasp out for air.

My vision blurred as the alcohol burned down my throat towards my stomach, my hand swaying out in the air to steady myself.

“Breathe there, breathe…You act like you’ve never had anything to drink before,” Eric strained to hold back the tears in a stifled laugh.

“I’ve…” I started, sucking in air. “...Never…had…gin before.”

A small series of chuckles emerged from the other counselors in the cave, all drinking from their red plastic cups. I gave a weak smile as I gave another cough at what my body clearly viewed as poison. After I had regained my composure, Kyle handed me a cup with the promise that it wasn’t gin. We shared a laugh and I began to sip from my cup as Eric began to play music from his phone.

Before I could ask Kyle to elaborate on our apparently shared dream, Eric pulled me over to the caveface beside the folding table filled with bottles and cups and a large lantern illuminating the cave. Lifting up the lantern to make the view of the wall clearer, Eric gestured to his name chiseled into the stone along with the multitude of names alongside it.

“Now, I didn't bring anything for you to add your name tonight, but before camp ends, I want to see your name up on that wall. Kyle’s too, if you fancy him enough,” Eric said with a smirk.

I elbowed him in the gut before checking to see if Kyle had overheard him. With no apparent response from Kyle I leaned in to take note of all of the names collected. As I drank deeply from my cup as Eric began listing off the names of people he knew that were on the wall, I was startled by Kyle’s voice.

“Hey Jake, do you have a moment?” He asked.

I swallowed hard before responding, “Ye-yeah, Eric was just showing me the names on this wall but I am sure we’ll have plenty of more opportunities for the elderly to reminisce about their old war buddies.”

Eric shot a stern look before laughing, he turned the music up louder on his phone before pouring himself another drink and wandering away to give us some privacy.

“So is it true?” Kyle leaned in, his voice just above a whisper.

“Is what true?” My voice steady with an air of casualness but I could feel my face grow warmer.

“‘That you fancy me?’ is the words that your friend had used,” Kyle said, his face stoney and unreadable.

“You…uh…well that is…Eric is just…I mean…” I could feel my face go bright red as I stumbled over my words. I felt like a schoolboy talking to his first crush. As the embarrassment had neared its crescendo, Kyle gave out a reassuring laugh.

“It’s okay, really. I would say that I ‘fancy you’ but I wouldn’t really use those words to describe it. You’re pretty chill and do what you can to help everyone out. I didn’t want to be so forward but I’ve liked you from the moment we met.”

I stood with my mouth agape at his words. I could feel my stomach somersault and not just because of the bourbon mixing with the gin I had drank earlier. 

“If you keep your mouth open like that, you’re bound to swallow a fly!” Eric shouted from the group he was conversing with. A wide smile and a thumbs up that I returned with a middle finger.

“Th-that’s great,” I managed to stutter out as laughter and music echoed around the cave. My head was swimming and I needed to sit down. The overcoming sensation of Kyle’s words plus that alcohol were leaving me with the dire need to sit down or throw up or jump into the pool or a combination of all three.

“I would love to get to know you more and hang out once camp is over,” he said setting one of his strong hands on my shoulder.

“I’d like that too. Y’know it would be nice to…” I trailed off as a flicker of lights and shadows danced along the cave walls.

Kyle continued to talk but his words did not meet my ears as I watched the shadows of everyone blended and changed form against the lights that moved back and forth. One of these shadows twisted to the form of a serpentine that connected to a body with eight appendages sticking out. The shadowy thing moved across the wall, avoiding the wavy shadows of the other counselors. As a set of large mandibles stretched wide as if to bite the head of one of the shadows when it returned to the body. As if the shadowy monster had become aware that I was staring at it, it rushed across the wall of the cave and disappeared into the night. As the tail of the shadow passed above my own, it flicked back and hit the shoulder of my own shadow. 

A sharp pain screamed from my shoulder, causing me to drop my nearly empty cup. The lighting of the room returned to normal as I grimaced and reached up to grab my shoulder. A look of concern from Kyle met me as I opened my eyes, after they shut from the throbbing pain that was now echoing from my shoulder. 

“Are you alright?” Kyle asked as the pain radiated out. 

Before I could respond, Eric was there beside us repeating Kyle’s question, his own face filled with the worry. My vision doubled as my words slobbered and stuttered but refused to emerge.

I could feel my body grow heavy as the pain seared throughout. Just as I could hear Eric tell Kyle to help him get me back to camp, everything went dark. The look of concern on Eric and Kyle was contrasted with the look of anticipated excitement sprawled across the faces of the other counselors.

When I regained consciousness, I was propped to the side of a shower stall with the water pouring down on me. My clothes were drenched and my head was still swimming. Eric and Kyle were both standing beside me, the worry etched in their faces was slowly replaced with relief as I began to move on my own.

“Oh thank God,” Kyle said before standing up. “I’m going to check to see if anyone noticed us.”

As Kyle left the room, the relief on Eric’s face was replaced with guilt as he spoke, “I am so sorry Jake. I didn’t know that they were going to give you such a big dose.”

Anger began to overtake me as I gritted my teeth to respond, “What are you talking about?”

“The others said they were going to spike your drink with a little something to loosen you up. It was just supposed to make it easier for you to set your nerves aside so you could talk to Kyle.”

“And you didn’t think the booze would be enough liquid courage for me?” I responded, sitting up and reaching to turn the water off.

“I didn’t think it was going to affect you so much. Kyle had some and you could see how relaxed he was. He really likes you man, I was just trying to…y’know give it a little gas.”

I swung my arm to hit him but missed. I hadn’t fully regained my depth perception back yet. The pain in my shoulder, however, was gone. Before I could say another word Kyle returned, he said that Sue was out and that we should sneak back to our cabins and talk about what happened in the morning.

Without another word, Eric stood up and let Kyle help me back up to my feet. Eric mouthed another apology to me before sneaking off to his cabin as Kyle and I silently stalked back to our own.

As we neared our cabins, thankfully avoiding a close call with another counselor consoling a crying young girl and Sue standing with them also doing her best to console the unhappy camper, Kyle and I stopped just behind my cabin.

“What happened?” Kyle whispered, his face inches away from my own. Despite my rage with Eric, my heart still leapt in my throat. 

“The other counselors thought they would play match-maker and spike our drinks to move things along,” I whispered back.

“Fucking jackoffs!” Kyle muttered, before hearing Sue’s voice grow closer. “We will continue this conversation in the morning. Right now I think it would be a good idea to sleep off whatever it was they gave us. I’d rather not have to explain to Sue why we are both out so late or why you’re drenched.”

With a nod I began to turn back towards my cabin when Kyle placed a hand on my shoulder.

“I want to know what's going on here, the crazy ass dreams, the weird behavior of the other counselors, all of it. After that I’m getting the fuck out of here. If you want, you’re more than welcome to join me”

“Absolutely,” I answered before Kyle gave me a longing look before sneaking back towards his cabin.

Grabbing a change of clothes and easing my way into bed, a flood of thoughts echoed in my mind before I drifted off to sleep.

What was that shadowy creature? What did I get spiked with? What is with these crazy dreams?

The last question that I mulled on before I drifted off to sleep, fills me with regret as I recount what happened at Camp Stonebrook.
Why didn’t we just leave that night?

If we had, Kyle might still be alive today.
