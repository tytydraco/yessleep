I lived in a small town. 

At the centre of it is the community garden. 

Lately, I’ve been getting a bad feeling when I visit my plot. 

I’m not the only one either. 

It came to a head the other day when the man diagonal from me dug up a finger. 

This of course sparked a lot of questions and a little bit of panic. 

Whose finger is that?

What the hell did that guy do?

How long has that been there?

Are we going to end up digging up a body?

Well, we got the answers to that last one. 

After digging up the rest of the plots, we had most of a body. 

Only thing missing was a head. 

Nobody could identify the body. Everyone who lived in that town was accounted for. 

Rumours and theories started flying about who this may be and why they were buried in the community garden. 

The local police were pretty sparse on releasing details to the public and the garden was closed to the public while the investigation was going on. 

This did not help lessen anyone’s fears. Over the course of a week, the atmosphere in the town changed. 

Whereas before it was a small tight knit community with almost no crime, now people were all suspicious of each other and looking over their shoulders. 

This got worse when the body went missing.

Accusations flew. Everyone had someone they suspected of taking the body but there was no main suspect. A few people were even attacked on the street over this. 

The body turned up a week later. Stood up in the middle of the community garden. 

That’s when I said NOPE and went to stay with an aunt who lived 2 towns over. 

I never considered myself superstitious or paranoid but I didn’t feel like sticking around to find out what happened next. 

Clearly I was not the only one. A friend asked they could stay with us a week after I left. 

I kept up with what was going on through another friend who stayed to see how this played out. 

Apparently after the police took the body back to the coroner’s, it appeared again. In the same spot as before. 

If this was a prank, it was a really fucked up prank. Though I think even back then, I knew this wasn’t a prank. 

That’s also when the dreams started. 

I kept having the same dream. 

I start out at home. 
I wander through the empty town until I get to the garden. 
The body waits for me. 
It beckons me. 
It tells me despite not having a head, never mind a mouth that it needs a head. 

I guess I’m not the only one who’s had that dream. 

The next time it turned up, some psycho gave it a head all right. 

An elk skull. 

Nobody admitted to doing it. Just like nobody wanted to admit they were relieved. 

The relief didn’t last long. Soon I
started having a different dream. 

I’m wandering through the abandoned town again. 
Nothing is out of place but the atmosphere feels suffocating. 
I end up at the community garden as always but the body isn’t there. 
This does not bring me any comfort. 
I continue to wander through the garden, then out around the rest of town. 
The weird atmosphere doesn’t let up. 
Nothing happens but I feel like something will at any second. 

I always wake up exhausted. 

The body stopped appearing at the community garden. 

This brought exactly no comfort as it was still missing from the coroners office. 

I was super glad I had moved in with my aunt. 

That is until last night. 

I was driving back to my aunts place after picking up some of my stuff from my old place when saw the body with the elk skull standing on the side of the highway. 

When I turned back to look, it was still there but further back in the tree line. 

This morning, the local mall was cordoned off. When I asked someone in the crowd what happened, they said someone found a human finger in one of the planters.
