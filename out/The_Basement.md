I think I've seen a demon. Let me explain. I work at an old bar where I live that was recently sold to a new owner so when I joined the team they were still in the process of getting everything up and running. The first couple weeks went by smoothly, I washed dishes for the most part and helped with salads and desserts if it got too busy, and my coworkers were some of the nicest people I've met.

 One night just after we closed I had to run down to the basement to grab some stuff we had run out of. I hated the basement.. it was a long unfinished hallway that stretched under the entire building, with freezers and supplies lining the walls. I flicked on the light switch and made my way to the furthest shelf to grab what I needed.

 As I had my back turned I slowly got the sense I was being watched, I glanced over my shoulder but saw nothing and returned to the task. Suddenly I let out a scream as a cold hand descended upon my should and spun around, nearly punching my coworker Mike in the face. "Woah! Easy there!" He said, taking a few steps back to dodge the blow, "Sorry Mike, what's up?" I said, attempting to regain my composure. "I just wanted to let you know you're the last one here so make sure you lock up when you leave." He said, making his way up the hall and around the corner. Soon after I heard the front door chime as he left and I was alone. I hurriedly finished with what I was doing and made my way back upstairs, locking the basement door behind me. 

I crossed over to the bar and set down the various napkins and cups i had grabbed and went about organizing them and putting them away, quickly zoning out into the repetitive process. I was suddenly snapped back to reality as I heard a loud crash come from the back of the building. "Hello?" I called out, leaning out to see if there was anyone there, "I'm sorry, but we're closed.". Mike had said I was the last one here but it wouldn't be the first time some teenager had snuck in hoping to score some booze after hours. I sighed when there was no response and made my way toward the area where the crash had come from.

 As I entered the back room I noticed one of the racks of pool sticks had somehow come off the wall and crashed into the floor, great. Everyday I would find more things broken or in disrepair but at the same time the bar was an old one, some of the machines we had in our game room dated back to the early 70s and constantly needed repairs.

 I bent over to pick the rack back up and froze as i heard a door behind me click open. I slowly turned around, clutching a pool stick and gulped as I saw, of course, it was the basement door that had decided to open. I walked up and was just about to close it again when I noticed the lights down there were all turned on even though I distinctly remember turning them off on my way up. Any other time I would have just left it for the morning shift to deal with but unfortunately it was the last day of the work week and we wouldn't be open for another 3 days. I knew if it was discovered I was the last one here tonight and had neglected to turn the lights off, I would be getting a talking to Tuesday and I wasn't in the mood.

 I sighed and warily made my way down the stairs, cursing whoever built the place for awkward lightswitch placement as I slowly made my way down the hall to the far switch. I flicked it and made a dash for the next switch, trying to stay away from the dark because you never know what lives there. This continued until I reached the last switch at the bottom of the stairs and turned back to make sure I hadn't forgotten anything. I peered into the darkness, going through a mental checklist when the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. 

I froze, chills making their way through my entire body as some unseen force made its way through me. I shivered and backed up, deciding that maybe I would make it an early night after all when out of the darkness there came a low growl, causing me to stumble backwards, falling onto the stairs. A wet slapping noise followed the growls and I sat there, frozen in fear as the noises came closer to where I was sitting. I begged my legs to work, stand up and take me out of there but to no avail, it was if I was trapped there by some unseen force. I stared into the inky blackness and nearly screamed as I saw a large bulbous mass appear and make its way towards me. The smell honestly hit me first before I even saw it, it smelled like a sewer under the worlds smelliest swamp and looked the part too.

 I won't go into detail on how terrifying this creature was for fear you may go to bed with nightmares, I know I did. Instead try to imagine a giant caterpillar with too many human arms and sharp bloodstained teeth. It made its way toward me, it's many arms grabbing at the ground to drag it along the rough stone floor, leaving a trail of inky black residue behind. It reached the doorway to the stairs and that's when feeling made its way back into my body. I kicked out at the thing and connected with what I assume was its face and nearly vomited when my shoe sunk into its goey flesh, it was warm and I could feel it pulsating with some heartbeat. The thing roared and shook its head, sending me crashing into the wall and falling to a heap at its feet. I shook the fog out of my head and scrambled for the stairs, going up them as fast I could when I felt it grab me and I crashed headfirst into the wooden steps, feeling my nose crunch as it hit the wood full force. Pain radiated across my face and blinded me as I kicked out again, this time feeling a snap as I assume I hit one of its arms. It screeched and it's grip on me loosened and I was up the stairs, taking them two at a time and bursting through the door at the top. 

I slammed the solid steel door behind me seconds before the thing reached the top of the stairs and fumbled with the lock, finally throwing it into place and trapping that God forsaken thing in the basement. I watched the doorframe shudder as the thing threw itself repeatedly into the unmoving door. I ran to the bar and grabbed a bottle of liqour and some matches and quickly went about dousing the basment door and the surrounding area. I flicked a match and watched as it flared to life and with one last look, I dropped it. Immediately the room was filled with the roar of fire and I stepped back as the heat licked my face uncomfortablely. I quickly gathered my things and left the bar, nearly forgetting to lock the front door like I'd been asked and made my way home, at the same time texting my boss saying I quit and leaving some half-assed excuse as to why I didn't want to work there anymore. 

The next morning I woke to the town's community page screaming with the news the local bar had burned down mysteriously in the night but no one was inside, thank God. As my eyes landed on the pictures from the site of the fire, a jolt of sick dread went through me as I noticed that while there was nothing left of the bar besides charred remains, that damned door still stood even though everything around it was burned to a crisp, there it was, as foreboding as ever and I swore I could hear a low growling ringing in my ears.
