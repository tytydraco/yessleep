The clock struck 12. I lay awake in my bed, listening to the rain pour outside my window. Suddenly, a loud clap of thunder sounded. I shot upright, hyperventilating. I took a few deep breaths to calm myself down, before promptly grabbing my phone from my nightstand. The glow of my phone's screen illuminated my face as I unlocked it. I'll only use it for a few minutes, I thought, opening TikTok. Three hours of mindless scrolling later, I checked the time. *Shit,* I thought, *it's been three hours. I should get some sleep... Nah, I'm not that tired.* Slipping my phone into my pocket, I rolled out of bed, my bare feet coming into contact with the cold hardwood floor. Grabbing my slippers, I quietly tiptoed down the hallway, passing both my parents' and my sisters' rooms. My parents were out on a vacation, and they wouldn't be back for two weeks, thank god.I had two sisters; one older and one younger. They always thought the older one, Hiroko, was unstable, so they sent her to a mental facility. But she's ok now. She's always been ok. My cat, Aki, seemingly appeared out of nowhere. I bent down to pet her behind her ears. "Yuki? Why are you awake?" My eyes widened, and I slowly stood up and turned around. It was my younger sister, Mitsumi. She's the favorite child, and she's a fucking bitch. "Can't sleep," I responded quietly. "Where are you going?" Mitsumi inquired. "I don't know." "Can I come?" I hesitated. "Sure, if you promise to be quiet." Mitsumi's golden brown eyes lit up, and she grabbed my hand, smiling. I smirked. *So na√Øve...*  
  
Together, we crept down the hall, and towards the stairs. We peered down the long, winding staircase, into the dark abyss of the basement. Mitsumi's grip tightened. The rain poured relentlessly outside, soaking what seemed like the whole world. "W-what if there are monsters down there?" Mitsumi asked, voice trembling. "There are no monsters down there. Monsters aren't real," I responded firmly. Something seemed off about the basement, however. Usually, you could see the faint outlines of objects through the darkness. But you couldn't. It was just pure, infinite blackness. What the hell?Nonetheless, we started down the stairs, hand in hand. At the bottom landing of the stairs, Mitsumi paused. The thunder seemed louder now. "W-what was that?" I turned my head to the left, and just barely managed to catch a glimpse of a dark figure disappearing around a corner. I gulped. "It was nothing. Just a pile of stuff on a chair or so-" A loud, almost inhuman scram erupted from the corner where she saw the figure disappear. Her breath hitched. "Mitsumi, we should go ba-" I paused. I didn't feel her little sister's hand in her own anymore, and promptly began to panic. "Mitsumi!" I hissed. "This isn't funny. Get back here!" There was no response. "Mitsumi...?" *She just ran off because she was scared...Right?* My pulse raced, and I took deep breath. *I have to go look for her.*  
  
I turned on my phone's flashlight, shining it towards the corner I saw something disappear around. I slowly stepped forward, eyes adjusting to the sudden harsh light. *Squelch.* My slipper landed in a damp spot on the floor. *Ew. What is it, cat vomit?* I peered down, disgusted. It was a pool of crimson red blood. I swallowed nervously and kept walking. Finally, after what seemed like hours, I reached the corner. What I saw permanently fucked me up. My little sister's body was propped up in a chair, her skin peeled off like a tomato. Bloody viscera lay in a mangled heap on the floor. All that was left of Mitsumi's mutilated body was her muscle tissue and bone. I dropped to my knees, bile rising in myr throat. My phone clattered to the floor. "Mitsumi..." I started, choked sobs escaping my throat. I grabbed my phone, hands shaking violently. I fumbled with it for a few minutes before finally calling 110. It rang. My heart hammered in my chest. "\[REDACTED\] Police Department. Please state your name, location, and emergency?" A calm female voice spoke. " I'm Yuki \[REDACTED\]. I'm at \[REDACTED\]. My younger sister was just murdered." Yuki whispered, choking on the last word. "I'm sorry about that. Did you see who it was? "...No." "Are they still in the house?" "I don't know.\`" "Ok, we're sending dispatch your way. Stay where you are, ok? " "Ok." She hung up. The room was eerily silent for a few moments, before my stifled sobs began to echo in the spacious room.   
  
10 minutes felt like an eternity. I heard a loud knock on the door. "Police! Open up!" A voice shouted. I slowly dragged myself up the stairs, which seemed longer that before. Wiping my eyes, I reached out and grabbed the doorknob, slowly pulling it open. "Hi..." I mumbled quietly, stepping aside. "Where did it happen, miss?" The officer asked. "In the basement, sir. Down there." I motioned down the dark staircase. "Stay behind me, ok?" He said. "Wouldn't want you getting hurt." I nodded. The officer pulled his gun out of its holster. My concerned expression transformed into a sickeningly satisfying smile. Before he even started down the stairs, I pushed him. There was a sickening crack as his bones snapped and he tumbled down the stairs. I stepped over his crumpled body and into the basement. Mitsumi's body was gone. All that was left was the chair she was propped up in, which was saturated in congealed blood and bits of mangled viscera. Her blood had started to drip off the front of the chair.  
  
"It's safe to come out now, Hiroko." I called.A mysterious figure stepped out of the shadows. "We did a good job, big sis. Nobody would miss her," my older sister mused, her voice laced with venom as she twirled a sharp, blood-coated knife in her hands. "Everything went accoring to plan," I stated. "Everything..."
