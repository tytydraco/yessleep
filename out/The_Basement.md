I grew up in an old house. Not Victorian old, more like 1950s old. It was a small rancher that only had 6 rooms. You'd enter a very narrow kitchen before turning a corner where you'd be at a junction. Go straight and you'd wind up in the living room. To your right is a pantry door with a set of steps leading to the attic. To your left was a small hallway that we called the "dining room" since there was enough space to set up a small table on the left side of the room to eat at when we had company. The first door to your right was the master bedroom, my parents’ room. At the end of the hall, you could go right or left. To the left was our one and only bathroom and to the right was my small, cramped room. The room that I swear was supposed to be a closet.

The dining room, bedrooms, and bathroom were the original portion of the house that was built in the early 1950s. It was tiny and cheap. It just had a crawl space underneath, and it was poorly insulated. My room was scorching hot in the summers and freezing cold in the winters. Interestingly, it was only my room that ever had these wild fluctuations in temperature. The kitchen and living room were an addition put on in the late 50s and the owners opted to dig out a basement underneath this portion of the home. A small one, but no less imposing than any other unfinished basement is to a child.

I grew up in this home from the day I was born. This story occurred when I was maybe 12 or 13. It was a good house, for what little it was. I had a lower middle-class family, but it was a loving home, and I had a family that never let on if there were hardships. I was an only child. My mother had endometriosis and had to have a hysterectomy when I was still an infant. I was the only child she'd ever bear. My father was....scratch that....is a good man. He works hard and though we butted heads when I was a teen, he always wanted the best for me.

Unfortunately, like so many families, mine didn't stay intact. My parents divorced when I was 10. I won't go into the details as they're not relevant to this story but know this. It was amicable and clean. My father gained full custody of me without any long, drawn-out legal battle and my mother moved to the next town over and I saw her often. I was lucky that my parents saw past their differences and tried to keep my life normal.

My father didn't make enough money working his regular schedule to keep the house. So he worked overtime.....a lot of overtime. He normally worked the day shift, 7am to 3 pm. After the divorce, he would pick up nights from 7 pm to 11 pm or even 3 am at times just so he could make ends meet. I was old enough that he trusted me to take care of myself. I'd get off the bus, let myself in the house, and he'd be home shortly thereafter. We'd talk about our days, he'd cook dinner, take a nap, then go back to work. It was hard on him, I knew it was, even if he didn't admit it. We made it work like that for years, by the time of this story, we had gone on like this for 2 or 3 years.

If you've ever lived in an old house, then you know that they have a unique......personality to them. Creaking floors, uneven floorboards, poorly done renovations, terrible wallpaper, etc. This house was no different. As a kid, like most kids, I was afraid of the dark. I slept with the nightlight on until I was 7. I was so easily spooked. I watched the opening scene of the original "IT" movie....you know the one, where Georgie gets dragged down into the sewer?? It traumatized me for MONTHS when I was 5 or 6. I had trouble sleeping for the longest time and I would see monsters in the shadows of my nightlight, always hiding under the blankets for some sort of protection, the naïve notion all children seem to have as though by instinct. Having seen the IT remake as an adult, the Georgie scene in the new movie would've terrified me for years as a child.

The one thing that always helped me sleep was our American Bulldog Paisley. She was the best dog we ever had, playful and full of energy but protective. She once nearly killed our neighbor's Black Lab when he jumped the fence into our yard and ran straight towards me. When she was with me in my bed, I knew I could sleep in peace. She wouldn't let anything near me. At the time of this story, she was 7 years old.

Our house being old as it was, had its own flavor of creepy noises. I swore at times I would hear footsteps in the attic above my room, of course it was probably just the expansion and contraction of the wood. My father liked to play it up by saying things like "Well you know, someone did die in this house..." just to rile me up. I never really knew if it was true, but some nights I swear I heard whispering in my room coming from the closet. I used to chalk it up to my imagination and ignore it.

The worst noises came from hot water baseboard heat. In the winter, the boiler in our house would heat up water before sending it through copper pipes that would heat our home via conduction. I understand this process now as an adult, but I didn't as a child. When that hot water went through those cold pipes, the pipes would expand. They gave out this god-awful creaking and snapping sound as it happened. When it would occur in the middle of night when everything was still and silent, it terrified me.....unless Paisley was there. She wouldn't bark, or stir, or pop her head up. She'd snore away, unbothered. As a kid, it was the best indication I had that everything was ok and there was nothing to be afraid of.

That all changed one night.

Our small basement was a dimly lit mess. You entered through the kitchen. The door to the basement was across from the door to come into the house. It contained our washer and dryer, hot water heater, and boiler. It also had a bunch of assorted junk that couldn't be stored anywhere else. It would leak when it rained particularly hard so it always had a damp feel to it and mold would stick to the damp concrete walls. I only went down there to do laundry, that was it. There was a small basement hopper window on the front side of the house and a full size, normal window on the back side with a window well that was 6 feet deep. Ostensibly it was there so someone could get out of the house if need be. It had a couple of dark corners behind the steps into it where you couldn't see. My mind would play tricks on me and after retrieving my laundry, I'd run as fast as I could with my eyes closed to get out before I heard or saw anything. It always gave me a feeling of dread. Even at 12 or 13, I knew it was irrational, but I couldn't help it.

On this night. I began to think it wasn't my irrational and childish fears.

It started like any other. My dad cooked dinner, laid down for a nap before going to work. His shift was 7pm-3am this night. After he left, I went about my usual night routine. Grab some snacks and watch TV like any kid left to fend for themselves. I don't remember exactly what I was watching but for some reason I think it was The Clone Wars animated series, this was around 2011 and as big of a Star Wars fan as I was/am, it would make sense.

My night was...typical. I snacked on junk food, watched TV, let Paisley out so she didn't pee on the carpet overnight, etc. After letting her in around 9:30 or so, I sat down and began munching on nacho cheese Doritos when I heard a noise below me. It was indistinguishable due to the noise from the TV, so I muted it and listened for 30 seconds or a minute. I couldn't really tell what it was, it sounded like something dragging across the floor, but I also couldn't be sure that it wasn't just the TV or maybe the furnace kicking on, it was December after all. I shrugged it off and unmuted the TV and continued stuffing my face.

Then it happened again.

This time, Paisley heard it. She was lying on the floor in front of me and popped her head up, her ears raised and alert. I muted the TV again. I wasn't crazy after all. Now my heart began to race, pounding in my chest. Paisley didn't move, I tried to pet her, but she didn't budge. She remained looking at the corner of the room, listening intently. Taking my cue from her, I listened too, although all I could hear was my own heartbeat.

Then it happened again. Even louder than the first two times.

It sounded like something scraping against the concrete floor of the basement directly below. Paisley heard it too and she's now standing and growling. She never growls. Her back hair standing on end. She's never like this. The last time I had seen her like this......she saved me from the neighbor’s dog. She had been viciously defensive of me that day. After the two dogs had been separated, I remember my dad holding her back as she growled and snarled at the other dog, blood on her mind and her hair on end. She now had a similar look to her now.

I tried to rationalize what was going on. Furnace kicked on?? No, not three times in succession like that. I felt the heat registers, they were hot. The furnace had been on for some time. Maybe it was a mouse or rat, shuffling through some old backpack. It sounded heavier than that but, it wasn't impossible. My mind was racing, going through all possible explanations but all the routine, normal moans and groans of the house didn't explain Paisley's reaction. She never reacted like this to anything except for that one time....that time.....that I was in immediate danger.

I hear shuffling below me. Not the dragging sound like before but not footsteps. It sounds like someone taking a stiff broom or brush to the floor of the basement. Paisley loses it. She runs out barking like crazy. She stands looking at the basement door and she stops. As she stops the noises in the basement stop. She then sits against the basement door, putting her back into it.

My first thought after this was "Oh my god, someone's in the basement." I grab my phone and start to text my dad,

*Hey, I think there's someone in the basement. I hear a bunch of noise down there and Paisley is freaking out*

After a few minutes, my phone vibrates,

*lol what*

I rolled my eyes and began furiously tapping on my phone,

*Dad, I'm being serious. There's a bunch of noise down there and the dog is flipping out too.*

My phone, buzzes again, he's calling me,

"He-Hello..." My voice was shaking.

"Are you ok??"

I explained to him what was going on as fast as I could. My voice was shaking, heart still pounding.

"Ok, ok. I believe you; I'm coming home. Grab my gun and if you think you need to, just call 911, ok??"

"I-I-I'm sorry dad, I feel stupid......" my voice trailed off. I hated to make him come home over this, but I was scared to death. I hadn't felt this level of fear since the time I had seen "IT" so many years ago.

"It's ok, I'll be there soon," he hung up. He sounded genuine in his concern; he wasn't frustrated or mad.

I went to my dad's room and retrieved his 9 mm handgun that he kept just in case of a break in. I knew how to use it; I'd shot it dozens of times. I made sure to keep the safety on and the chamber was empty, I kept it that way. God forbid I accidentally shoot myself. I figured the threat of a firearm would be enough to deter any would be attacker. Oddly, it had been quiet for maybe 10 minutes and Paisley was now lying down against the basement door. I went around the house, turning on all the lights just to calm my nerves some and closing the blinds in case anyone was watching from outside.

Just as I thought it was over, I heard a loud BANG from the basement as if something heavy had been dropped on the floor. My heart is racing, and I go over to the basement door. Paisley is standing and growling once more, letting out the occasional bark.

Now I heard the shuffling again, even louder than before, moving around now I can hear it going towards the washer and dryer. I hear it hit the washer, I know this because the washer is old and out of balance and makes a similar noise when the inner basket slams against the aluminum skin. I hear things falling on the ground. The sounds of plastic hitting the floor and the distinct sound of aluminum rattle paint cans smashing into the concrete floor. Then another loud metallic bang, louder than before, slamming against the washer. Paisley is freaking out, scratching the door and barking incessantly. The noise all seems too crescendo all at once. Things falling, dog barking, heart pounding....I cover my ears as a tear rolls down my cheek......stop please...I think to myself......just stop..... STOP!! Then silence.

The noises all stop at once. Paisley stops barking but maintains a low growl. I take a deep breath. I try to muster the strength to open the door but Paisley snarls at me. A warning. I listen to her judgement. Then light reflects off the kitchen walls from behind me. I turn around to see a pair of headlights coming closer. Dad.

I had never been happier to see my father in my life. I placed the gun on the kitchen counter and hugged him tighter than I ever had before in my life, tears streaming down my face. For the first time in what seemed like hours, my heart had stopped pounding.

"Jesus bud, are you ok?"

I started rambling, recounting everything that occurred in the minutes before his arrival. The noises, the barking, the fear. He listened. He seemed to be trying to make sense of it. When I finally stopped to catch my breath, he finally interjected,

"Well, I guess I need to go down there."

I nodded. He retrieved the gun and opened the basement door, having to push the door against poor Paisley to get it open as she steadfastly guarded it, still growling, still on edge. He turned the light on and began to slowly walk down the steps with me attached to his hip. Paisley stood at the top of the steps. Her growling gave way to a low whimper. He made the left at the bottom of the steps towards the washer and dryer. Paint cans and cleaning supplies were strewn across the floor. A plastic, portable shelf was pushed over leaning against the washer. Aside from the newfound mess, the basement was empty as far as we could tell.

"Well bud, I think we might have a mouse problem." He chuckled and shook his head, amused that his son had dragged him home because a rodent had made noise and knocked some things over. As he turned to face me, he looked me in the eyes before looking up and past me. He turned white as a ghost and the amused expression gave way to a look of pure fear.

"Dad?? What is it, Dad??"

I felt a cool breeze against my back and heard the distinct sound of something dragging across the concrete directly behind me.
