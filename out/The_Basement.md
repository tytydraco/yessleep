When I bought the old house, people in the town gave me those kinds of looks—half warning, half pity. But I ignored them. I wanted solitude. The creaking floors, dusty corners, and overgrown yard made it perfect. Quiet. Forgotten.

There was just one thing that bothered me.
The door in the basement.

It wasn’t supposed to be there. The blueprints showed a flat wall. No door. No knob. Just a slab of concrete embedded in the foundation. But when I first stepped down into the basement, I felt it watching me. Not a presence—something beneath presence. It radiated wrongness.

It looked more like a sealed-off vault, with rusted hinges and thick iron bars fused into the cement. No handle. No keyhole. But it was definitely a door. I tried to ignore it. For months, I did.

But every night, I’d hear the knocking.

Always three slow knocks.
Then a pause.
Then scratching. Like nails trying to remember how to be fingers.

I started sleeping upstairs. Then stopped sleeping altogether.

Sometimes I’d hear it sighing.

One night, I pressed my ear to the door. I don’t know why. Maybe I wanted to confront it. Maybe I hoped it was all in my head. But when I did, I heard something that shattered my spine with cold.

It was humming. A lullaby. The one my mother used to sing to me. But she’d been dead for ten years.

I started to unravel. Shadows moved wrong in that house. My reflection blinked when I didn’t. Mirrors grew breath-fog like something was behind me, always just behind me.

But the door never opened. Not once.

Until last night.

I woke up at 3:33 AM—of course. The knock came again.
Three times.
A pause.
Then… a click.

I crept down the basement stairs, flashlight trembling in my hand. The air was sour, heavy. The kind that clings to your lungs like wet fabric. The door—the door was open. Only a few inches, just enough to suggest invitation.

I should’ve run.

But the humming. That damn lullaby. It was coming from inside.

So I stepped in.

Darkness swallowed me. I wasn’t walking on concrete anymore. It was soft. Spongy. The air buzzed like a thousand flies trapped behind my eyes. And all around me were walls. But they weren’t stone. They were…skin. Human skin. Stretched, twitching, pulsing.

And then I saw the faces.

Dozens. Hundreds. Melted into the flesh-walls. Some screaming. Some weeping. One smiled at me, and whispered:
“You opened it. That’s all it needed.”

I turned to run, but the doorway was gone. No light. No exit. Only the smell of rot and something ancient waking up.

And then I heard it. A voice not from the walls, but from me.

“You were never real, you know.”

It hit me like a scream from inside my bones.
What?

“You’re just a skin it wore once. A borrowed face.”

Suddenly, memories crashed in. Every familiar thing in my life—my job, my friends, my family—they were echoes. Shadows painted over something else. I had no past. I had only what the house gave me. That house didn’t belong to me—I belonged to it.

I dropped to my knees as the truth peeled me apart.
I wasn’t a homeowner. I wasn’t even a man.

I was the next mask.

⸻

The house is still there.
Still waiting.
Still knocking.

And soon, someone else will hear the lullaby.
And step into the dark.

Where I’ll be waiting.
Smiling.
Just another face in the wall.

Because you see… the door never opens for you.
It opens into you.
