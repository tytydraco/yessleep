I don’t know if I should be telling this to anyone but I feel like it’s necessary to talk about it.

I was 17 years old when it happened.

At school when I was in the cafeteria I overheard a conversation with the girls and they were just talking about guys they wanted to date and having a sleepover, normal stuff.

Until one of the girls says a rumor about the strange door that doesn’t show until every night in Friday 13th from 11pm to 12am when it becomes Saturday 14th.

They even said that fifteen kids within the past decade were missing after they went in the room, as if they have vanished into nothing but atoms or thin air.

I thought it was bullshit, no way anyone would believe this.

I thought that the rumor would die out after a few weeks, but it was the opposite.

Everyone was talking about it, students, teachers and even the principal were all talking about it, though everyone was not so sure.

Then one day I met up with my friend and she said:

“Hey Casey! You want to go to a party in my house, school has just finished. We can relax on the stress of exams and studying.”

I calmly reject and walk back to my house (which was three houses away from the school) where I decided to sit down and read something to ease my mind.

But when 11pm hit something in my mind snapped.

It’s like it wants me to go to the room.

I tried to resist the urge but I couldn’t do anything to stop it.

So I caved and decided to try to see the strange room to see if the rumor was true.

After I put on my outfit back on, I took a flashlight and my phone with me and I walked to the school to try to uncover the mystery.

I tried to open the door but it was locked.

So I grabbed a large stick and broke the glass door where I finally entered into the school to try to search for the strange room.

I looked everywhere in every corner but I couldn’t find it.

I was ready to leave when I turned to my right and saw the strange room was right next to the science lab.

There was a paper in yellow that read:

“PROHIBITED AREA - DO NOT ENTER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.”

I ignored the message and I placed my hand on the cool metal door knob and twisted it open.

And when I opened it all I saw was a long hallway with paintings.

I was annoyed, why would the school start a rumor about a room that was just a long hallway with paintings?

But I sighed and entered the room where the door closed behind me by itself.

Then I decided to move forward and I saw some paintings that looked.. wrong..

It looked like the past kids but scared and little by little it distorted until they looked weird and grotesque.

Then after twenty minutes of walking I make it to another door and as I was opening the door, a foul and powerful smell poured out and it covered the entire hallway.

I held my breath and entered the room where I saw that all the kids were mutilated beyond recognition.

Some had their organs dangled but all of them had a message about The Crimson Cross.

I was confused until I saw a body bag shake.

It wanted someone to help it, so I went and opened the body bag.

But when I opened it I saw my mom.

She looked fine, except for the nose bleed.

Then blood poured from her mouth and then she suddenly exploded into a fleshy and bloodied mess.

Then I hear a voice telling me that I shouldn’t have been here and that I’d meet a terrible fate.

Then it told me to run as one of the body bag is ripped and out came an eyeless and pale and skinny yet tall figure charging up whilst yelling.

I saw the paintings were heavily distorted and they had dark eyes and they looked mutilated beyond repair.

Then I open the door and slam it shut and I hyperventilated for a bit and then calmed down.

I tried to check the time from my phone but it was dead.

I checked my watch and the time read:

‘Saturday 14th 12:00:01am’

Then I get a notification from messages from an unknown number and it reads:

“Congratulations Casey, you are one of fifteen students who survived the trial for The Crimson Cross and we would like to reward you greatly for your survival of the events. We apologize if we caused any trouble towards you and you will be given a great reward to live up until the horn has been blown and the earth has been destroyed and reduced into nothing. Thank you Casey, Please go back to your house.”

Then I look back at the door and it was gone.

All there is the janitors room that no longer has the hallway or paper in yellow.

I walked back home but right as I was about to enter I saw a lit candle in the living room.

I went to the window where I saw multiple people in black and red robes chanting something about their new member and for the new member to have a prosperous life.

Then the leader of the cult walks towards a body and says that they will be given eternal life and other great gifts that will be given after they become 18 and when they have fully devoted themselves to the cult of The Crimson Cross.

I look who it was that they were talking about.

It was me
