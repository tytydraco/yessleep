My name is ThÃ©o, I am 32 years old. I have never been particularly lucky in life. A monotonous job in a small company, a salary that just covers the rent and a few extras, and dreams that I had put away in the corner of my head, stifled by reality. Then one day, everything changed.

It was an ordinary Wednesday. I had bought a Lotto ticket as I often do, almost mechanically, without much conviction. But this time, the numbers lined up on the screen matched mine. Six million euros. For a few seconds, I stood frozen, breathless. Then, a mixture of laughter and tears overwhelmed me. I was rich. I did not yet understand that my life had just taken a turn that would escape me completely.

At first, it was exhilarating. I left my job the next day, without warning. I bought a nice car, a loft in the city center, and started traveling. I finally had access to everything I thought was unattainable: five-star hotels, private parties, starred restaurants. People who once looked down on me suddenly seemed fascinated by me. I had become the man everyone envied.

But quickly, the excitement gave way to a void. After all, what can you do when you can afford anything? The days looked the same, easy pleasures lost their taste. So I started looking for stronger sensations. It started slowly: a bottle of champagne here, a line of coke there. Nothing too bad, I thought. I had the means, so why not?

But the spiral closed in on me. What started as a distraction quickly became a necessity. Alcohol helped me escape what I refused to face: my loneliness, my loss of bearings. Drugs offered me moments of forgetfulness, false outbursts in a daily life that had become insipid. I started hanging out with people I would never have met before, night owls who took advantage of my generosity as much as my naivety.

Months passed, and my life turned into chaos. I distanced myself from my friends, from my family, from everything that had meaning. My nights were filled with endless parties, and my days with constant hangovers. My bank account was visibly emptying, but I didn't pay attention to it. The money seemed infinite, like the abyss I was falling into.

One morning, I woke up alone, in a messy apartment, with a feeling of suffocation. I hurt everywhere, physically and mentally. Looking at my reflection in the mirror, I had difficulty recognizing myself. My eyes were dark, my features were drawn. I was just a shadow of myself.

Today, I have almost nothing left. The six million were gone, squandered in excesses that left me broken. I've been in rehab for two weeks. I enjoy spending my time on Reddit with your stories which are equally crazy and which take up most of my time. I'm trying to reconstruct something, to understand when I lost control. Maybe I wasn't cut out for that money. Maybe it wasnâ€™t the money that changed me, but it simply revealed an emptiness that I had always carried within me.

I'm 32 years old, and my life is in pieces.

Ps: I have emptied my bag, I hope that my story can help you realize that money actually contributes to happiness but also can destroy you. As in my case thank you to everyone who took the time to read I am open to any type of questions. ðŸ™‚
