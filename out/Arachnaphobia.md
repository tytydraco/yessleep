I, a 24 year old mom, wait no Today is my birthday I am now 25, and has a daughter of 4 years of age. Currently I am writing this under stressful circumstances, I am a mess. Though I need to hurry I am writing this as slow, and as well as I can. So my daughter learns to not make the same mistake I made, My family's women always die at the age of 25, it is unknown why to this day but because I am 25, now I understand.

When I turned the age of 24 I started to get paranoid, I was being as careful as I could. I isolated myself into a room with no openings other than a sealed door and a ventilation system. It had all my stuff in it and food and water to last, the women in my family had a bad allergy to one specific red spider. But I had never seen it in my life, when I asked about it no one had known a spider such as the one I was "deadly" allergic to.

After isolation I started to have dreams, strange dreams. They always went like this. I see my 5th greatest grandma, but younger she looks like she is in her 20s, in the middle of a giant pentacle. She was pleading crying for help and protection, and power, After an hour of this I looked  up. A giant red spider is above my grandmother looking down on her. It hisses but somehow I understand what it's saying, "Do you understand what the cost is for this protection?" the spider responds "Yes" My grandmother says "So now, you and your descendants will have my power and protection until the age of 25, but all the females souls will be mine on their 25th birthday, to pay for your sins" "Of course". My grandmother slits her hand as a blood offering and everything goes black, I see a giant spider saying to me before the dream ends, a promise made, a promise fulfilled. and I wake up sweating.

It is now the date of my birthday, I wake up at 1 up  in the morning in a cold sweat. I go to the bathroom anxious to wash my face. I look up to find a small red spider in front of me, it jumps on my face. The only thought that runs through my head is "block off the entrances, don't let them take your daughter" I close off all entrances as I throw the spider across the room, but its to late, as I finish with the door I see a red bump between my eyes, it bit me. I see a little hair poke out of the bump. Only for it to become a giant red spider and bite me again and again. more red spiders  pop out of my skin and bite me.

As I write this I fill the room up with hair spray to kill the spiders and myself, I am slowly becoming nothing as the spiders start to fill up my skin only to pop out and make me become smaller. My message for my daughter is. There is no escaping, enjoy life, don't be afraid and before your 25th birthday Fucking ki#l yourself so your soul doesn't belong to him.
