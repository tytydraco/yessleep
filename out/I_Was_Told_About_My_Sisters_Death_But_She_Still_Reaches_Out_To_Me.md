 

***knock knock.*** I was stricken with an illness I have yet to comprehend. The screams of shear terror and horror I can only fathom. I spoke to a therapist to see what plagued me so, but oh no. He thought I was crazy, but I assure you, I’m not the one who’s crazy, but rather, I’m one who is of sound mind, it is he who is blind. The truth I will share here, but beware, it is one of horror and of fear.

It started on a relatively normal day, I was happy, but it would soon turn to dismay. I was told of Jill, my sister’s passing, I cried at what could have been a life everlasting. I had been to her funeral to mourn, but one person was there, who I would soon scorn. James Harville, a beloved colleague, stood in front of me. He saw my pain. I was hurting at the fact that Jill was taken from me. However, he just faced me with glee. I asked, “Why do you smile during this occasion?” “No reason.” He said sternly, “I guess in the face of despair, you can only smile about the life the two of you led together.”

There were many things I had not known about Jill, I would soon realize the kind of person she was in the following days. I tried to hold my head up high as much as I could, owing to the fact that I had just lost the only person I truly enjoyed spending time with. I had walked home and started going through the old photo album. There was a sudden sense of ease that consumed me. I felt as though nothing else mattered, but that would soon change after I closed the album. When I locked away the album one last time, I heard something strange, like the whirring of factory machinery. I started moving through the house to find the source of the ever present *clank clank*. I moved across the downstairs area where it seemed to get louder. Wait no. Closer. I must be getting closer. 

I went into the bathroom, figuring that was where the noise was coming from. When I had found the source of the whirring, I froze. I don’t know how to describe what I had seen. I thought I had fallen into a bad dream, a very horrible dream. I wasn’t. All I saw were… eyes. I couldn’t put my finger on it, but there was something odd about those eyes, like they were beckoning me to get a closer look. I then heard the phone ring. It was James. I went to send a picture of the eyes to him. They were there, mind you. I got in close to take the picture. *Click*.

I sent the photo to James. “There are eyes staring right at me when I walk into the bathroom.” I said hurriedly. “I sent the picture to you.” The line had gone silent. I could hear the near silent hum of the phone. “There’s-” James paused suddenly. He then continued. “There’s nothing here.” “How?” I said in a loud manner, almost yelling, “I saw the eyes! I can’t be imagining it!”  I then hung up and ran to the bathroom. I looked at where the eyes appeared.

There were no eyes there at all.

I leave this for the wary readers. I was back to the way I was before Jill’s death, but I would soon start losing my mind whenever I heard in a shrill and petrified voice, “Help me, Carter.” No one other than Jill and my parents knew my name. I’m living in constant fear from that day. My therapist thinks I’m crazy, but I know the truth.
