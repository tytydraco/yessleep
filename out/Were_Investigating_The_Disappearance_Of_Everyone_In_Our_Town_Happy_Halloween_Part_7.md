Now I know what some of you are thinking. Pete, where in the fuck have you been? This is a valid question and the answer is that I’ve been really busy. Yeah, what else is new, right? The difference is it’s been more hectic than usual for us. First, let me get the greeting out of the way and wish all a Happy God Damn Halloween, well almost.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

True, we may not be celebrating with the people in town, but how many people can say they’re celebrating Halloween with a real-life gray? Not many, I’ll bet, and speaking of Zohl, guess who finally got to see the inside of his ship? That’s right. We did, including Stevenson.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Of the four of us, he seemed the most excited to be there. I’m getting ahead of myself, though. I won’t lie. Since I got over two weeks of stuff to talk about, I’ll have to split this into two posts. Oh yeah, one more thing, I finally got down baking pumpkin pie thanks to a helpful commenter.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I also found this super easy recipe online that uses graham cracker crust. I’ll link it here if anyone wants to try it. Now, without further ado, I’ll pick up where I left off last post. This first part is a couple days after it due to us needing to recover from the card tree incident.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“So what do you guys think?” I asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We were all in Carl’s living room. We decided to spend our first day of downtime decorating. Zohl helped us and now we have lights up, jack-o’ lanterns, fake crows, and Freddy and Jason lawn inflatables. Two pumpkin pies on the coffee table in front of us. Between them was a bowl of homemade cinnamon whipped cream.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There was enough for each of us to have two slices.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Damn good,” Carl told me, biting into a slice. “I like the classic kind more, but I wouldn’t knock this graham cracker one either.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I have to admit this is pretty good,” Stevenson said, cutting off a piece with his fork and dipping it into some whipped cream.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I looked at Nick who gave a thumbs-up with a slice stuffed into his face.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Thanks, I’m glad you guys enjoyed it. By the way, Zohl, I’ve been wondering something. Do you actually need to eat?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He was spreading some whipped cream onto his slices.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Not as often as other species. Mine can go weeks at a time without needing sustenance.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He dug off some of the filling and put it in his mouth. I picked up a slice from my plate, swirled it into some whipped cream, and bit into it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“As much as I’m enjoying this, I think we should move on to more important matters,” Zohl continued.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Right, so what’s the plan here?” Carl asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Indefermast…”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Inde.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Inde?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“We shortened the name.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Well, whatever its name, we’ll need all the resources we can get to destroy it.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He noticed our expressions drop.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Did I say something wrong?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“We weren’t planning on fighting it,” I explained.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Yeah, the idea was for us to just go in and get everybody out,” Nick added.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"You've all managed to overcome every challenge thus far and yet you seem apprehensive. Why is this?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Because monsters and paranormal shit’s one thing,” Carl answered, “but we’re talking about a full-fledged eldritch abomination here. We can't exactly fight, let alone kill something that'll fry our brains the second we lay eyes on it. The other stuff was bad enough. We'd be goddamn idiots to try this."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Believe me when I say I can empathize with your fear. Indefermast or Inde as you prefer to call it was my home's terror longer than you can imagine."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

His words made me realize something.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Oh yeah," I said, "you mentioned creatures overrunning your planet before. I'm guessing it's responsible?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Your guess would be correct. I and a handful of others managed to escape it before it was taken over completely."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"How did you end up on Earth then?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"One of the creatures was chasing me. I managed to hurt it, but my ship was damaged in the process. It crashed near your town and I passed out on impact before your townspeople found me."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"When did you arrive exactly?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"The late sixteen hundreds."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Stevenson, who'd been quietly observing up to that point, spoke up.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"That was during the witch trials," he said, surprised. "How did you manage to convince them not to burn you at the stake?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Contrary to popular belief, there were places back then that you would consider progressive. While we were initially scared of each other upon first contact, the townspeople and I grew fond of each other."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That surprised us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"You were friends with them?" Nick asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Indeed, I was especially close with the founding family. They let me stay with them and provided me with clothing while I found the right materials to repair my ship."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"You knew the founders? What were they like?" I inquired.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"You mean you don't know about them?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Well, no. Information about them kind of got lost over the years."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Zohl seemed lost in thought. His gold eyes stared down at the pie slices on his plate.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"For us to succeed, knowing the history of your town is of vital importance. Before I begin, I suggest someone write all this down."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Since I'm already writing these posts, I volunteered to type up the history of our town according to Zohl.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"To start, the village that would become your town was still in its infancy when I arrived. Earth was a planet we'd been occasionally monitoring. However, we considered it to still be too primitive to make direct contact."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Stevenson piped up again.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"So you were the first alien on Earth then?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"The first of my kind. I can not say if other species were there before me. We were impressed with your species' ingenuity and thought you needed more time to develop before we were ready to make ourselves known to humanity. We’ve made sparse communication over the years, but we’ve kept it to a minimum.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Zohl’s voice, despite its monotone, showed the slightest hint of regret.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“That’s the way we did things when meeting new species. However, I’m beginning to think that was a mistake. We thought if we helped species develop that would give them an unfair advantage over others, but if we had maybe we would have come up with a way to deal with threats like Indefermast sooner.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You couldn’t have known something that powerful would show up,” I said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“This is true. Our planet was able to repel many outside threats up until then and I suspect it may have made us unintentionally arrogant. Now, getting back to when I was meeting your town’s founders…”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He went on to explain that he was found passed out in the lake near the village.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Some hunters were out fishing at the time. Among them were two of the founders, a man by the name of Lorcan O'Rorke and his wife, Faye, My species had already studied your languages by then so I was able to catch what they were saying. There was some discussion of what I might be and what should be done with me. Dissection came up several times.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Yikes,” Nick said, “were you nervous?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“A little. I knew your species while smart didn’t deal so well with the unknown.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

His mouth curved up into a faint smile as he continued.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Which is why they surprised me. Lorcan deduced I may be able to communicate with them and helped carry me back to the village.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Who were the other founders?” I asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Another couple by the Laelim and Ashkira Davis. They worked as doctors and aided greatly in healing me. In fact, if it weren't for them, my crash would have been fatal.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Well, our townspeople always have their moments even if a lot of them are fucked up when they do them. What did they tell you about the town?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Zohl explained that the town acted as a safe haven for the outcasted and the scorned. Be it escaped slaves, women from overly religious villages, people with different sexualities, or even people falsely accused. They all ended up meeting each other and migrated far to settle on the land that became their village and now, our town.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It took them months to get here,” Zohl said. “I don’t believe it was random chance either. I think the land was calling them.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“How exactly does land call something?” Nick inquired.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“By someone else leaving a message from beyond the grave. This land was occupied by a prehistoric type of ape that would eventually become human.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That rang a bell in my head.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Oh yeah, I think Inde mentioned something about that,” I said. “Didn’t they think it was a god?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“They did. How it got through was due to weak spots in reality.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Meaning it was strong enough to create a rift between its world and ours?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Correct, planets will form a natural barrier against the paranormal to minimize how much of ti can get through. Yours was still young, though, and wasn’t quite strong enough to keep something as strong as Inde out. The fortunate thing is that the rift was only large enough for some of it to get through.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“But that was still enough to convince them,” Stevenson spoke up. “What simpletons.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Why are you being so judgemental?” Carl angrily asked him. “They didn’t know any better. How could they have?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Because things haven’t gotten much better since then. Zohl said it himself. If we were more advanced, we’d have a better chance against threats like Indefermast.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Honestly, he wasn’t wrong. As much as we want to believe that reason and logic are going to win out at the end of the day, the fact of the matter is, most people will end up choosing what makes them feel comfortable over an unsettling truth eight out of ten times. We spend most of our time bickering instead of coming together to advance and when progress tries to happen, there are people who drag their feet every step of the way. It’s depressing as hell and yet, unsurprising.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Your frustration is understandable,” Zohl told Stevenson. “However, all we can do now is focus on what we currently have to stop it. The early humanoids were able to harness the energy from the riff and, for lack of a better word, enchant the land to attract people to protect it.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What do you mean by for lack of a better word?” I asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You could consider the enchantment to be both a blessing and a curse. It attracted both people to defend the land and also acted as a magnet for paranormal forces. Dealing with threats such as that requires people who are more open-minded and ready to face the unknown. I became fast friends with the O'Rorkes and the Davis family.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What were they like.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A reminiscent expression came over Zohl.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Kind, strong, and intelligent. They helped free their people from enslavement and led them away. I have many fond memories of me having meals with them.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Zohl picked up one of his slices of pumpkin pie.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“This reminds me. They used to make pumpkin pie back then as well. Although, it was a little more cinnamon heavy and occasional due to the rarity of spices. I also recall it using honey instead of sugar.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He opened his mouth and stuck in the slice, pushing it through with two of his long fingers. Seeing that, we realized we should be finishing ours too.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“If I had to pick,” he said after chewing and swallowing, “I would probably choose the pie they made, not that yours isn’t good, Peter.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Thanks,” I replied. “You wouldn’t happen to know their recipe, would you?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“That and more. The blacksmith helped me craft part to rebuild my ship.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“How long did you stay there exactly?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“At least a few decades. Unfortunately, I wasn’t the only extraterrestrial guess during that time.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

His words chilled the mood in the room.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“That monster found you, right?” Carl asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Zohl nodded.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It must’ve left its scent on my ship and was able to track it.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“From space?” Stevenson asked, shocked. “That far away?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I thought I finished it off. I was wrong. It came in the form of a green meteor. The way it looked was like an octopus attached to the body of a mantis. It was fueled by Inde’s power and managed to infect villagers before I and others banned together to stop it.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“The first returned were created?” I said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Yes, that thing managed to infect over half the town. Luckily, we were able to utilize the runes to fight it. By then, though, it was too late. Its presence severely weakened your town's paranormal defenses and has allowed the creatures you are familiar with today to get through.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“And others, so what happened after you guys killed it?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“We realized more threats were coming so I helped create the journal of runes to combat them, but I can’t take all the credit. The Davis family had fast sketching hands. When it finally came time for me to leave, I made the villagers a promise that one day I would return with a way to stop Indefermast once and for all. This town holds that key and there’s far more to it than you know.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“So what should we do now?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You’ll have to reattempt the ritual you were trying to do before.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Collectively, we got an “aw fuck” feeling.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Do not worry. I will be assisting you this time. Since you were nearly done already, completing it should not take long.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Once again, we attempted the ritual again. The offerings were already burned so all we needed to do was reconnect the sets. Zohl was on the roof of the town hall and would shoot at any card trees that came too close.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Alright,” Carl said into his radio, “let’s try this again. My parts reconnected. What about all of y’all’s?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We replied that they were as I was drawing my sets back in. Once completed, the orange light once again appeared, and with Zohl’s help, the next ten minutes passed, not like a breeze. I mean things were still trying to kill us and time always seems to go the opposite of how you need it to in high-pressure situations. I will say it did alleviate much of our dread to have him helping.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It is complete,” Zohl called out to us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We went back to the town hall and saw the statue of our founders had slid away, revealing a stone staircase.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Okay, that's new," I said. "How long has this been here?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Since before this town's founding. We discovered it during the making of the journal through an old cave. Then we built this to keep it safe."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He gestured to the statues. We went down the stairs. What they led to left us in awe. There was a massive obsidian door in the wall. There wasn't any handle or switch on it or the walls nearby.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"How do we open it?" Stevenson asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Zohl stepped past him.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Allow me."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He took out a long piece of chalk from a suit pocket and began drawing. He drew a circle of runes in the door's center that started glowing a faint white. He tapped them in a certain combination and they changed to a forest green. The single door turned out to be double which came open as if pushed by an invisible force. The inside made my breath stop and for once, I mean that in a good way.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I'm not exaggerating when I say it was one of the most beautiful things any of us ever laid eyes on. The cave walls were decorated with smooth crystals of varying colors. On them were prehistoric paintings, men fighting with spears against winged monsters or ones that were humanoid, but massively tall. We even saw one of a bunch of people fighting a type of lake serpent with a head on each end instead of a tail. One especially unnerved me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It showed people on their knees or in poses I can only describe as towering. Some still stood with their spear in hand. Above them was a dark formless mass with red eyes. Tendrils seemed to be sprouting from its body, reaching in every direction. Even though we knew this wasn't Inde's true appearance, that didn't make seeing this any less unsettling.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The floor of the cave was the same obsidian black and stretched off into an unusually shaped crystal. It reminded us of an open hand. In the palm of it were holes meant for some kind of

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"What is this?" I asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"A gateway," Zohl answered. "I built it myself in order to access a realm that may help us to defeat Inde."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Hang on. May? So you aren't sure where this thing opens up to? What if it's somewhere we can't even breathe?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"I assure you we would not be trying this if that were the case. Do you all trust me?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We replied yes. It wasn't as if he'd given us a reason to distrust him.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Then I need you to trust that wherever this goes, we'll get back from it safely. Now, please step into the hand with me."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We did and he reached into his suit pocket again, pulling out some jewels.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"These are the reason I was gone for so long. I needed them to power this and they are very rare. Help me put them in."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Once we got them all in, the air around us seemed to distort.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"My insides feel backwards," Nick groaned.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Mine too," Carl replied.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Stevenson and I weren't fairing much better. Thankfully, this didn't last long. When it stopped, we found ourselves in a sort of void consisting of only dark blue and purple swirls. Behind us was the hand.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"What is this place?" Stevenson inquired.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"The realm between dreams and the waking world. The reason it is empty now is because it creates places based on the consciousness of those within it."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"So we think it and it'll appear?" Nick asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Not exactly. It's more that it'll pick up on what's close to you as a collective and create it accordingly. Observe."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Bright orange cracks spread throughout the space around us. When they connected, they shattered, causing the light to spill over us and forcing us to shield our eyes. The light faded and in front of us was something that made our jaws drop. A black castle sat atop a tall hill. There was a spiked fence in front of it with Jack o' lanterns in front of it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

On them were crows, ravens, and owls. Hanging upside down from nearby trees were bats.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"This is awesome," I exclaimed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I know it must have seemed childish as hell, but this place was practically oozing Halloween.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"While it is indeed festive, you must be wary of danger lurking within."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Huh? Oh, right, so anything we need to know before we head in?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"There are certain items that we must locate that are rumored to be contained in this realm. I am not sure what they are. However, I have the feeling we will know them when we see them."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Welp, no point in standing around then. Come on."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The entrance doors were made of dark oak with golden handles. We tried it and found they were unlocked. The doors opened with a creak. The walls were stone and the carpets were red. Chandeliers hung high above us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There were several different doors we could choose to explore and a staircase both going to upper and lower levels.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Which one?" Carl asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"The objects will be in difficult-to-access areas. I suggest we start with one of the hallways."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We picked the one on the far left first since it was the closest. Upon opening it, there was only darkness and yet it was solid. When we all went through, we found ourselves in an underground temple.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"How'd we get here?" Nick asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"I've heard of this before, haunted houses changing where people should end up to fuck with them," I replied. "Are those hieroglyphics?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They were painted on the cave walls.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Remember, we'll face threats related to the world created," Zohl told us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Given our location, there was a pretty good idea of what we were about to face. We came to a room with a sarcophagus that was solid gold with red claw marks all over it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Okay, I'm sure I already know what's going to happen," I said. "The pharaoh or whoever is going to be holding the thing we need and as soon as we take it, he'll wake up and attack us."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"I mean, that does seem par for the course in these kinds of situations," Carl replied. "Let's see here, the door is still open. I'll bet when they wake up, it's going to close so we should hold it open and then run like hell when we get what we need."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In fairness, it was a decent plan. That’s probably why it was doomed to fail. The pharaoh had seen better days. Seeing as how he was dead, that wasn’t unusual. In his hands was a silver orb covered in golden symbols. It seemed to have the consistency of a jello mold.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It jiggled when I touched it. Nervously, we checked on the Pharoah. He remained the same, a dried corpse wrapped in bandages. We glanced back and could see the door back to the castle held open with one of Carl’s knives. I let out a breath,

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Here goes,” I said and then grabbed the orb.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We turned tail and ran. We could already hear the Pharoah’s groans as his ancient remains became reanimated. Now, here’s where things went downhill off the edge of a cliff. The door didn’t close. It vanished and my urge not to shit myself along with it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“The Pharoah is this item’s defender and the only way to escape with it is to beat him.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Well, it’s only one stupid mummy,” Carl said. “We can take him.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

At that moment, the walls slid open, and a group of undead armed guards flooded in and pointed their spears at us. Sweat trickled down my face as I closed my eyes and groaned.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You were saying?” Stevenson nervously asked Carl.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Ah, shut up. This shouldn’t be difficult because we got firepower.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Carl drew out his handgun as the guards were shambling towards us. He took aim a the Pharoah and fired. The shot was dead on and the former ruler collapsed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“See? Nothing to it,” he said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Then why is the door still gone?” Stevenson pointed out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Carl frowned. The wall was indeed still smooth without any sign of an opening. Turning back to the still-approaching horde, the Pharoah was back on his feet. The bullet wound in his head was sealed up. Beneath the bandages was gray rotted skin.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“At least they’re slow,” Nick said at which point the Pharoah moaned out a command and chopped his hand downward in the air.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The guards were now sprinting toward us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Fucking shit,” I hissed,

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Run,” Carl yelled.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We split up to force them to divide. I went with Zohl and Carl, Nick, and Stevenson went together.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Okay, regular weapons aren’t working,” I said as we ran. “What will?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“The creatures created here correspond with the world they come from and will share their traits.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Wait, does that include their weaknesses?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It should.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Then I think I know what to do.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I shouted at the others to get their attention.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What?” Carl called back.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Fire.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He and the others were confused at first and then looked at the torches lining the walls. Instantly, they understood. While we knew what to do that didn’t mean doing it would be a walk in the park. We knew the mummies’ weakness. However, their advantage lay in numbers.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Duck,” Zohl warned.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I did and a spear zipped over my head. We got close to the wall, grabbing some torches. Now we were ready to fight back. Two guards thrust their spears at us. We side-stepped them and shoved the torch in their faces.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The result was almost instantaneous. They screamed in pain and turned into ash. That gave us a confidence boost. All of us were armed so we thought from here on out this would be a breeze. Soon, only the Pharoah was left. He snapped his fingers and more guards came in.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You’ve got to be kidding,” Nick said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We figured they’d keep coming unless the Pharoah was taken out. The obvious problem was that when we took out his guards to get to him, he’d just keep summoning more. On top of that, there was the whole tiring out from running for our lives thing. I really hate the human body sometimes. We searched for something, anything to give us the upper hand.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Guys, the pots,” Nick yelled, pointing with a torch.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Oh yeah,” I said, “the spices.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Certain species used for burial were flammable so that meant we essentially could make firebombs. Grabbing one required me dropping my torch. My heart thumped rapidly as two guards came at me and I was unable to defend myself. Luckily, Zohl came to my rescue. Turns out, he’s a lot stronger than we originally thought.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

When he hit his torches into the guards, they went flying and exploded into ash against the walls.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Since when could you do that?” I asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I’ve been holding back my strength. Now to end this.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I took aim at the Pharoah and chucked the pot at him. Zohl threw his torch which hit it, covering him in flames. He wasn’t the only thing to burn. The entire temple was catching and soon began crumbling around us. The door had reappeared and we got through it as the area finished collapsing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Anyone else want to take a break?” Carl asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We told him yes between heavy breaths and sat by the wall outside the door. It was only when we calmed down did I notice the cuts on Carl and the others.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You guys okay?” I said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“We’ve been better,” Nick replied. “You aren’t looking so good either.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Huh?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I felt a sharp pain and glanced down to see a wound in my abdomen. All the adrenaline must’ve made me not register it sooner. We brought some medical supplies so we were able to patch ourselves up. Once ready, we got up and headed for the next room. This time it led to some dark woods.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"At least we can get some fresh air," Carl said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Yes, at the expense of something trying to kill us," Stevenson responded. "Let's just get this over with."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A loud howl chilled the mood instantly. I'd seen enough movies to know that could only mean one thing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Werewolf," Carl murmured.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It came bounding out of the forest. This thing was insanely huge. It made the one in American Werewolf In London look like a puppy. Hanging around its neck was a red orb with blue lines running through it that reminded us of veins.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Zohl, please tell us you're strong enough to fight this thing," I said as fear came back over me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"I am not. I am sorry," he replied.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Then we're up shit creek," Stevenson groaned.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The werewolf sized us up. We drew our guns. Then it noticed the orb in my hand. It tilted its head and then peeled it back its lip, exposing its teeth in a faint grin. My blood's warmth quickly plummeted at the sight of this. With a bellowing roar, it charged forward. We fired only for our bullets to not even so much as make it flinch.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Carl cursed and we fled. The werewolf was quickly gaining on me. Realizing it was after the orb and recalling what Zohl told me earlier, gave me an idea.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Carl," I called out and he gave me a questioning look.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I waved the orb and from his expression, I knew he understood my plan. I threw it at him as the werewolf was breathing on the back of my neck. It let out an enraged roar, seeing him catch it and it switched targets, bounding after him. The others picked up on the situation and what followed was basically a game of extreme catch.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Whenever the werewolf got too close to someone, they'd throw the orb to someone else. This went on for a while as we were also keeping an eye out for the thing that would help us. Nick, who had the orb, threw it to Stevenson. He fumbled it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Oh hell," Carl yelled.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Stevenson was on his hands and knees trying to find it, letting out multiple cusses as he did.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Hang on," I shouted. "I got another idea."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Admittedly, this was simply plain fucking stupid on my part. The werewolf was nearly on Stevenson. It stopped, getting ready to leap on him. I jumped on its back. You see, I thought since this place was associated with the dream world, the whole doing whatever you want in a dream thing applied.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It didn't. I was flung away like an ant. The only saving grace was that I gave Stevenson enough time to pass the orb to someone else. I was seeing stars upon impact and pain shot through my body. Shaking off the fatigue, my fingers brushed against something as I was getting back up.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I'd found it, wolfsbane. I yelled for the orb to be tossed to me. Zohl was holding it this time and he threw it a second before being knocked to the ground. When the werewolf came after me, I stuck the plant forward, hoping like hell this would work and that I wouldn't end up a chew toy. Its fur sizzled.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I drew my gun and shot it between the eyes. It reverted back to a naked man and then crumbled into dust, leaving only the orb behind. We got out of there. Along the way, I snapped off some large branches.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Second one down," Carl said. "How many more do we got to get?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Four."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Four? This could take a while then. Pete, what are you doing?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was sitting down and snapping the sticks I got in half.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"We'll probably run into vampires in this place so I'm making stakes."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Oh, good thinking. Here, we'll help."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We spent the next half hour whittling down the sticks into stakes, during which some concerns were brought up, namely about food and where we would use the bathroom.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“This place is pretty weird. Maybe we’ll come across one,” Nick said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He turned out to be right. We tried another door and found a restroom with stalls eerily similar to the ones at my old high school. I won’t lie. This did bring back bad memories, but I did my best to ignore them as we went about doing our business. After leaving, we marked the door.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We were super tired so we chose to rest up with Zohl on guard whose species needs very little rest. I’ll have to leave it off here for now, due to Reddit’s character limit. Expect the second post [tomorrow.](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/) Goodnight, [everyone.](https://twitter.com/RoseBlack2222)
