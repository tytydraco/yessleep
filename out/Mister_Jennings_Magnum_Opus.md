If somebody wanted to get away with something for a long period of time, they would have to refrain from bleeding their source of pleasure dry. Hoard what scarlet nectar they were able to gather and replenish with only the necessary amount before returning to the well of awful temptation.

This logic is why he was able to get away with it for so long. It's a big town - a couple of disappearances a year generated enough concern, but far from enough concrete suspicion.

Mr Jennings and I crossed paths when I answered an advert in the paper. Block letters in the bottom right corner that would have been easy to ignore if not for my increasingly desperate financial conditions: "*HELP WANTED: LIVE-IN CARER FOR LOCAL GRANDFATHER OF SIX.*" The sympathy-generating sentiment of those words drew me in, tugging at heartstrings with the emotions of my own grandpa's disappearance and presumed death, whilst hiking a few months prior. I called the number on the listing and a few days later found myself standing outside a great big house on the edge of town. It was close enough to me that I could walk, so I was more than happy with the commuting arrangement, but I'd still never come out that way, and the unfamiliar surroundings felt strange to me. Not necessarily in a bad way, just strange. The wrinkled elderly man inside opened the door after just two raps and introduced himself as Mr Jennings.

"*And you must be little Miss Paulina*", he spoke, voice raspy and low.

The immediate setup of our all-too-familial dynamic struck an uncomfortable chord within me. I didn't really want to be seen as a helpless little girl, but my few seconds of thought on the matter ended when I told myself he just came from a different time. That belief was set in stone when he invited me inside, and I felt as if I had stepped into a long-gone period altogether.

In every nook and cranny, unsightly wood spoiled my view. But this was his home, and my job wasn't to judge his taste in home d√©cor, so I quickly moved on to a more in-depth discussion of what he expected of me.

"*You worry too much, sweetie, you really do take after your grandfather, don't you?*"

"*I'm sorry, what?*" I blurted out, before correcting myself - "I*'m not sure what you mean*" in a feigned attempt at politeness.

He evaded my expression of confusion and moved swiftly onto his short list of rules. As discussed on the initial phone call, I was to assist him with anything he didn't have the capacity to do himself. A simple enough carer's duty and one I had done perfectly well in the past. He did have one rule that I didn't understand, though. I was to treat his family well and to present myself in a ladylike manner when in their presence.

I fumbled over my words as I launched another failed attempt at clarification: "*Again, I apologise for my confusion, Mr Jennings, but I thought you said you didn't have any family left?*"

I should have left that place after his response:

"*You'll come to understand, and you'll come to love them.*"

A mix of unknowable fear and sad pity sank into my mind. His odd behaviour scared something within me, but his appearance as a lonely old man with nobody for company except the ghosts of days gone by made me feel for him. He was once like me, and chances are I would once be like him - I wanted to treat him as I did my own grandparents.

Those early weeks were okay, in retrospect. My days consisted mostly of cooking, cleaning, and occasionally assisting Mr Jennings around the house when he would become too weak to move himself. It was a little odd, though, because it seemed like he could move quite fast when he wanted. Too fast for a man of his age. He went down to the basement an awful lot and requested I stay out of it, which I thought was weird but didn't pay much mind to and adhered to nonetheless. Any time I could have alone without his bizarre assertions and subsequent lack of explanation was well needed.

I suppose he noted my reluctant comfort, though, because Mr Jennings decided it was time to introduce me to his family. It was a cool, clear evening when I woke up in a sweat after a nightmare I can't quite recall. I fetched myself a tall glass of water and composed myself before returning to bed. The next time I awoke, I had a pounding headache and a smiley-face sticker brandished on my arm. My eyes took a little adjusting through their induced grogginess before the scene in which I had become the prized star revealed itself.

Six bodies in varying states of decay were propped up by wooden chairs around a long table in a poor imitation of a family dinner. What remained of the father, judging by the pristine suit and tie he was draped in, sat at the head of the table with the supposed mother across from him at the other end, dressed in a floral dress and with a blond wig stapled to her scalp. The children, albeit clearly adults in a nearly invisible silver lining, were sitting along the sides, one brother and one sister along each. The contrast between the cracked, discoloured skin and the clothes each corpse wore made matters all the worse. To launder and press their clothing only to dirty those garments all over with the repeated stain of violent death took a level of depravity beyond humanity. 

I'd also never thought a human could scream as much as I did until the moment I laid my eyes upon it all. My lungs gave way not long in, but I continued until my throat was raw and burning and sound refused to escape into the stale air around me. I didn't stop until I passed out once again, and when I woke up, I felt something I had come to relish. Ignorance. I've experienced it before, especially after losing grandpa, that suspended moment in time after waking up when nothing means *anything* beyond the bare bones of existence. Where all that you know is that you are conscious, and all your problems and sorrows past that are trapped in a void somewhere beyond reach.

But then, inevitably, it all comes back. I only pray the dawn of remembrance never feels worse than it did when I woke up in that basement for the second time. The early days were all like that. Forgetting and remembering all over again. I was kept well-fed. Clothed. He never really spoke to me after he locked me up, just grunted and stared at me through the rectangular slit in the reinforced door with pity, like I was a dying pet. But still, I had all the dignities you would expect to receive from an elderly man, except the one I craved the most. Even after accepting my situation and struggling past the sheer horror that had become just another day for me, I never stopped toiling for my freedom. My first few attempts failed. The chair leg I had fashioned into something of a spear to jut into his stomach whilst he was feeding me, and the hours I spent in the dead of night waiting for him to push my food for the day through the slit both amounted to nothing. I slept little, and even when I did, it was with one figurative eye open. I learned to wake, alert and ready, whenever so much as a pindrop sounded.

It was before my third attempt to escape that he finally spoke to me again. I suppose in an effort to get me to understand. To get me to love my family. He waited for me to cease my wild swinging between rage, fear and servitude before calmly speaking:

"*Don't you understand, Little Paulina? You're the star of the show! I've spent my life waiting to show this piece off, to show my family off. I love them all, but you are certainly my favourite - now, before you interrupt me, I know parental figures say that all the time, but you really are! I haven't been able to create a true bond between myself and my families until now. Strangers just weren't enough any more, so I brought you all together. Now you've always been a smart girl, but I can't believe you didn't recognise my brother Edward! He has been asking for you, and I'm so glad you can be together now.*"

His voice was drowned out by my beating heart threatening to burst out of my chest as I crawled across the room to the father at the head of the table. My blood curdled as I realised he hadn't been lying: my grandpa Ed had a birthmark on his shoulder, and even though it had decayed somewhat, I could still see it. I screamed through my exhausted lungs once again and froze as the door began to swing open. It was time for me to become the seventh, squeezed alongside my nameless siblings and left to rot. For a moment, I accepted my fate. I laughed to myself as I hoped he would choose one of my nicer outfits, lest I be condemned to that awful fate in my work clothes. A final moment of jest in amongst inevitable evil.

The door finally gave way to the silhouette of Mr Jennings, and he moved towards me with a speed that was again much too fast for his age. Before I could even spring up, he was pushing his weight against me in an attempt to plunge a syringe into me. But I wasn't going to let him this time. I wasn't going to sleep again. We wrestled for what felt like aeons against that backdrop of his horrendous family dinner until I was able to scrape against his skin with the needle deep enough to inject the fluid into his system. Mr Jennings muttered something as his eyes grew heavy and his body limp, something I struggled to hear until he weakly repeated it:

"*All I ever wanted was a family.*"

The investigation following my escape and gradual recovery led to a mortifying conclusion. As if the damage of the scars forever imprinted on my psyche wasn't enough, a final revelation brought them all together in a web of terrible truths.

Mr Jennings was indeed an elderly man who lived in that ancient house on the edge of town. His parents and sole sibling passed away in a car crash when he was 19, and he never married nor did he partake in any normal form of life following the passing of his loved ones. From everything the police learned, he was a shut-in.

But he died, alone and with nobody to care for him, in 1972. The house had presumably been empty ever since.

All those people he snatched away from their lives became unwilling participants in his recreation of what a family should be like. And when his desperate endeavours failed, all that remained in that house were the bodies of the countless before me who never managed to escape his clutches, buried beneath soil save for those I was supposed to join around the dinner table.

They never found Mr Jennings in the house.

He never managed to bring any people with familial ties together until his final attempt.

Until he took my grandpa away from us.

Until *me*.

His little Paulina.
