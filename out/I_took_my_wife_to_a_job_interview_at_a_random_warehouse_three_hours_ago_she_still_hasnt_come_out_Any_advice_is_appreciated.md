Hey everyone! I hope I’m in the right subreddit.

I’m looking for some advice on my current predicament. I’m really not the best at social situations, so I’m not all that sure what to do. 

It’s 3:00 AM, and my wife Ashley has been in this warehouse for three hours. I’m trying to decide if I should go in and check on her or not.

I know that sounds kinda weird. But, well, before you make a decision, let me start from the beginning.

Ashley and I grew up in a small town in Nebraska. We met sophomore year of high-school, and got married a week after graduation. It’s been two years since then. We didn’t really have anything going for us outside of jobs at Walmart, so four months ago we decided to sell everything we could live without and start fresh in a new, bigger city.

So we moved to a suburb just outside of downtown Houston. I had a pretty easy time finding a job in construction. That, along with our savings and frugal lifestyle (most of our meals are either ramen noodles or Cheerios) has allowed us to get by while Ashley continues to look for a job.

She’s had a much harder time finding work than I have, but this is partially due to the fact that she doesn’t want to settle for something like Walmart or Taco Bell. She wants a “big girl” job: receptionist, administrative assistant, something along those lines.  I’ve been supporting her not only financially, but emotionally. The last few weeks have been especially hard for her. She’s called herself a lazy bum more times than I can count, but I always make sure to remind her that she’s doing the best she can, and that she’ll find the right job very soon.

So we are just so fortunate that Ashley always checks her spam, because yesterday she found this amazing email! It was from a company that found her resume online and wanted to interview her immediately. If she gets hired, the pay will be $25 an hour starting out. Full time with benefits too. Her only responsibility will be watching some cameras and pushing a button if she's anything weird.

She called the number they left in the email, and ended up scheduling an interview for midnight last night… or today, however you wanna say it: it started three hours ago, okay? I know it might sound weird to go to a job interview at midnight, but if you consider the fact that her shift would be from 10:00 PM until 6:00 AM, it makes perfect sense.

But yeah, that brings me back to my question. I drove her to her interview at midnight. It’s now past 3:00 AM, and I’ve just been sitting in the car. To be honest, I’m getting kinda bored and I’m a little worried about why she hasn’t come out yet, but… I mean, I’d hate to embarrass her or ruin the interview by storming in.

What do you guys think I should do? Any advice is really appreciated!

Anyway, I’ll make sure to post an update when she comes out! Or if there’s anything else to update you all on. I’m sure everything is fine. I’m just a little scared that something might be wrong. I’m probably overreacting, right?
