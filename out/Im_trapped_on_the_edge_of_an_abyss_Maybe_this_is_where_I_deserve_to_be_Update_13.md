The top of the cliff was interesting because it looked exactly like the forest I had entered the town from to begin with. It wasn’t rotting and in decay like the shelf below; it was simply ancient and quiet the way old growth woods always are.

It was hard to tell this over the frantic sound of our panting and thundering footsteps.

There was a small path that led from where the catwalk let us off, although it was horribly overgrown and hard to make out with how fast we were moving. To be fair, though, I doubt Kingfisher used the stairs over the elevator very much anyway.

There was a frightening few first moments of running where we could see nothing in the dark ahead of us between the mighty sequoias and evergreens blocking our path. The woods somehow felt even darker than the abyss usually was, and even more oppressive. We knew creatures could come from up here too, which meant we were running through a lion’s den right now. Not to mention the quiet beast behind us still chasing vehemently.

I could hear it in the distance, never losing our trail, snapping through the sticks and shrubs. Scraping past the bark of the trees.

The girls and I pushed our bodies to the absolute limit until finally, a light at the end of the tunnel. Through the organic bars of ancient giants, we could see light shafting through ahead, florescent and disparate from the dark, natural flora. We funneled anything we had left into pressing the gas just a little harder, then finally broke through.

It was a parking lot, vast and open, rows and rows of street lights competing in height with the nearby trees. They stretched on about the length of a football field before stopping at the foot of a massive building, one that, to no surprise, I recognized.

If I thought seeing my old house was the worst it could get, I was sorely mistaken. I had hated that place so much because it was where I had watched my mother wither away. It was where I was caught up in a washy blur of emotions that streaked across a canvas of years and years, painting a picture that was entirely illegible. I thought that I really didn’t have many good memories in that place, but at least now and then I was able to draw some warmth from even the coldest of corners.

I couldn’t say the same about the hospital ahead of us. A dark monolith where I didn’t just watch my mother wither away.

I watched her die.

I didn’t need to hear any of the other Hens say anything. I didn’t need to see their faces. I knew it hit all of us just as hard to know what we were running toward. In that sense, it was probably good we were running for our lives. That way, there was no chance for us to hesitate.

I tried not to let my gaze wander to the finer details of the building and just focused on the front doors, our main target. Still, in my peripheral, I couldn’t help but notice some things that I know for a fact weren’t part of the original medical center.

There was a section near the main wall of the building that was composed of natural stone brick, a design choice that clashed with the sleek, white paneled walls of the rest of the hospital. There was also a flower bed in a large swath of grass that I certainly didn’t recall either. Granted, memories fade over time, and my mental capacity wasn’t exactly running full steam at this point of my life, but still, I dreaded walking into this building every time we approached it, and by the time we left it for good, I knew it’s nasty mug better than I wanted to.

The most damning piece of evidence, however, was something that I barely caught as the front doors of the hospital slid open to greet us, and we ran inside. There was a large wooden sign on two posts resting near the pavilion that hovered over the entrance. A sign far older than the rest of the architecture, and with a name on it that wasn’t the hospitals.

My throat tightened as I read the words just before they left my view.

*Austaway Funeral Home.*

I wondered if any of the other girls saw it too. The dread of seeing it combined with the hospital only compounded my already growing reservation about this rig, but we were already inside now, and there was nowhere else to go.

Finally indoors, I risked a look back to find that Hope was doing the same. Our footsteps slowed to a stop as we peered out at the lot and saw that there was no beast bounding across the concrete to follow us in.

At the edge of the tree line, lurking just on the edge of where the light's glow faded to dark, we could still make out the creature. It paced the edge of the lot back and forth rapidly, the way a dog might run along a fence trying to catch the squirrel it sees on the other side.  It was too far and obscured to make out its finer details, but the way its gangly, spider-like limbs scuttled in front of one another made me shiver.

No matter how intimidating it looked, though, it wouldn’t step past the curb of the parking lot. It just kept pacing, either trying to find a way in, or too afraid to follow us into whatever tomb we’d just stepped into. Knowing the history of these rigs, I had a feeling it was the latter, which didn’t help my courage.

My fear began to fizzle alongside my adrenaline as I realized we were safe, and it all gave way to a very painful reminder. A reminder of what had happened only a few minutes ago. My steady panting began to grow fast and shaky again, and I felt my hands begin to tremble.

“It doesn’t look like it’s interested in coming in here,” Ann noted, still glaring out the front door.

“Do you think there’s something worse in here? O-Or is it just cause there’s barriers?” June questioned.

“Probably both,” Ann grunted, spitting a wad of phlegm and inhaled dust onto the tile from running.

Hope was looking out the glass too, but she turned to me when she heard my panicked breathing. With a step closer, she placed a hand on my shoulder, “Hen, you okay?”

“I… I dropped her..” I said slowly, looking past the other me’s and the creature at the edge of the lot into the dark forest.

Hope furrowed her brow, “Huh? No you didn’t hun, we’re all right here—we caught you, you’re safe—”

I finally turned to her and gripped her arm tight, “No, Hope, *I dropped her.*” The girls all looked at me confused, and I shook my head, pounding my blood covered palms into my face in anger, “Hensley five; back on the ladder, did you not see?”

All the confusion left the lobby at once, and it was replaced by a deep, sober air.

I continued, “I-I felt her coming—I tried to catch her, but… T-There was so much happening, and she was so slippery—I…”

“Hey, calm down,” Hope said, trying not to sound panicked herself, “There was another clone, you’re saying?”

I nodded, “The last rig—did you all see it appear on the edge of the shelf?”

Ann and Hope nodded. June nervously rubbed her arm.

“It was time, and I didn’t catch her…”

“Hensley, hey, it’s okay!” Hope told me again, “The way we come out—we’re small, right? Just little blobs of meat? I’m sure that fall won’t hurt it at all; she’ll be okay.”

“We need to get back down there,” I told her, “We need to go save her.”

“What?” Ann chimed in, a confused look on her face, “Hensley, no. We can’t do that.”

“Well, we can’t just leave her down there!” I said, brushing past Hope.

“*She* doesn’t even exist yet, Hen. She’s just a wad of flesh, and she will be for another 24 hours at *least*. We just got up here, and there’s a monster right outside guarding the way back. We’re not getting back down.”

“She may not be one of us yet, but like you said, she will be soon,” I spoke, “You know how those beasts out there work—that thing knows we’re in this rig now, it will at least wait that long for us to leave, and by the time we’re able to get back down, she’ll have already woken up and have no clue what’s going on.”

“Look, I hate to burst Hope’s little bubble, but even if we come out small and with not a lot to damage, we’re still just soft, fleshy cists. Hitting the concrete from that height could just as easily be a tomato splat as it could a bouncy ball—we don’t even know if she survived.”

“And if she does? And she wakes up and is naked, lost and alone? She’ll die a way worse death, Ann.”

“Well then, maybe that monster will sniff her out on its way back down and kill her before she wakes up. That’s the best we can hope for right now.”

“Ann, it’s not that far back,” I protested, “W-We can’t just leave her out there—how would you have felt if you had woken up with nobody to help you? You almost got eaten by that giant bird thing your first day when you had no direction.”

“Look, I know you feel guilty that you dropped her, but sorry to say, Hensley, that’s too bad. It’s a miracle that we haven’t had any casualties this far, so a little piece of flesh that came out of your throat five seconds ago is a pretty acceptable loss if you ask me. We almost died getting to this rig this first time, so I don’t think I want to chance having to make a second trip. We’re running out of time and you know it.”

She was right about a lot with her sentence. The acceptable loss and us running out of time. I thought back to my nightmare and felt my nausea grow even more, but still, the part of me that Ann had been born from in the first place wasn’t about to give it up, and I shook my head.

“I can’t believe you—you’re fine just letting another one of us die out there for no reason other than convenience to the rest of us?”

“Yeah, Hensley, I am!” Ann snapped, “I thought I made that stance pretty clear from the beginning, but I guess you guys keep forgetting so I’ll say it again; we need to take risks if we stand a chance of getting out of here alive. You said back during Hope’s big meltdown that you didn’t blame me for leaving you at that house, so why is this any different? Going back to help that new clone can only spell danger, and we can’t afford that right now. If she dies, great; she never lived. But if she doesn’t? Well, she’s you, and *you* managed to figure out how to survive this place alone. She’ll just have to do the same.”

I opened my mouth to once again lash back, but I came up dry. I could see Hope had something she wanted to say too, but the guilt of Ann bringing up her freak out kept it in inside.

Ann took a deep breath, then spoke to me soft and stern, “You told me to make up my mind on what I wanted to do, and I’m committed to getting out now. So you can go back if you want, but I am going to keep pushing forward.”

I took a deep breath to steady myself, then for the first time in a while, swallowed my pride, “Fine. You’re right. But let’s get this over with. We have two timers running now.”

Ann looked surprised at me backing down, but she didn’t show any gratitude for it. Instead, she turned away and moved back to one of the lobby windows, peering into the lot.

“What are you doing?” June asked, “I thought we weren’t going back?”

“We aren’t,” Ann said, pointing to something on the far side of the yard to the left of where we’d come from. We all moved to join her, as she pointed to where she was looking. There was a large, concrete box with a floodlight and metal door resting just within the tree line, a small black box mounted on the surface next to the door. The elevator into the compound.

From this distance, we couldn’t tell if the little black box was a card reader or a keypad, but given the track record so far, we didn’t really need to guess. We had a plan for how to get the scientist's body down from the cliff after we grabbed it, but it was going to be a lot harder than if we just figured out how to use the elevator. We’d been holding out hope that we’d be able to get inside once we found it, but clearly that was a broken dream now.

Instead, we turned back to the hospital lobby to finally take it in.

Right away, it was clear that something was wrong with this rig. Of course, every rig was out of the ordinary, but based on the rules that we’d come to know of the machines, this one was especially off.

The rigs so far had replicated the spaces of our memory with perfect accuracy, exactly the way we’d left them so long ago in our lives. If the air smelled a certain way, it was present there too. If it was lit with a specific lighting, the rig was too. The only exception to this rule that we’d seen so far was back at the house where, for some reason, the rig had manifested the pill bottles everywhere. Given that those were a core memory of my time living in that place, my theory was that in its ruined state, the rigs would sometimes glitch, focusing in on specific parts of a memory and doubling down on their presence or blurring the lines between them and reality.

If that was accurate, then this rig was on its last legs.

The first thing was that the lights were all off. All except one searing white tube light above the reception desk, buzzing and humming like it was struggling for dear life. One of my main memories of the hospital was always the never ending, nauseating flow of unnatural glow that assaulted my eyes the longer I was there, so it seemed odd that now they weren’t present. The lights were the most tame part, however. We stepped closer and inspected the right half of the lobby ahead.

The whole room had a line running diagonally from a nearby wall, trailing across the floor, slicing straight through the main desk, then running up the wall and continuing along the ceiling. It reminded me a lot of the dead space that Hope and I found at the back of Zane’s, the areas that our memories couldn’t fill. The only difference here was that they were filled alright, but it wasn’t with the brutalist concrete that the rigs were made out of.

The white hospital walls with the green and blue lines for flair stopped abruptly at the seam where it suddenly turned into old, 70s style wood paneling. The plain, glossy linoleum floor gave way to a faded, navy blue carpet with ornate floral patterns repeating across its surface. Any modern or minimalist posters and decorum on the hospital side of the scene were in start contrast to the fancy, detailed paintings and vases posted up around the more vintage half. A sign on the back wall of the hospital read the first parts of *Cainhurst Polyclinic Hospital,* but it was abruptly cut off and continued on the other side by the letters of a different sign that I recognized by their ending.

*Austaway Funeral Home.*

“What… what the hell?” Ann muttered.

“What’s going on with this rig?” Hope asked, “None of the other ones were like this?”

I pursed my lips and thought, “Zane’s got funky like this when we pulled the core, and the house started to turn to ash when we pulled that one. I’d wager that something’s not running right.”

“It’s unstable.” June agreed.

“All the more reason to move faster,” Ann growled, looking either way down the nearby hallway.

Hope adjusted the grip on her flashlight and did the same, “Where do we even begin? This place is nearly three times the size of the other rigs we’ve been to.”

“You’re right. We should split up,” Ann said, “We can cover more ground.”

“N-No.” June opposed, much to everyone’s surprise. Her confidence went out like a blown candle the second we all turned to look at her, however. She shied away and began playing with the sides of her jacket, “I-I just mean—I don’t think that’s a good idea. How would we find each other again even if we do find the door? Plus, last time we split up, Hensley, um… she almost… you know.”

Ann rolled her eyes and sighed, “Yeah, yeah, I forgot. Baby doesn’t like to be on her own.”

June folded further into herself, “I-It’s not that; I just told you—”

“She’s right,” Hope jumped in, “We only have the one key card anyway. If the two that don’t have it found the door first, they’d have to double back to find the others, and we could end up passing each other and getting all sorts of confused. It’s better for us to stick as a group.”

Ann looked off to the side with a frown, then nodded, knowing she was outnumbered.

“So which way, then?” I asked.

“Um…” Hope began shining her beam down through the halls in thought. Her face scrunched after a moment as, in the silence, she picked something out that we hadn’t heard beneath our chatter and heavy panting. “Do you guys hear that?”

It was music; soft and distant, muffled somewhere in the belly of the building and leaking into the surrounding halls. Old hymns on an organ flawlessly playing to an audience that we hoped it wasn’t aware of.

June spoke again, this time in a low whisper, “You guys said that the zebra didn’t come to life until after you pulled the core… do you think this one is like that, or more like the angel?”

We all exchanged glances, but didn’t verbally answer. Given the state of the rig and that it was similar to Zane’s during its meltdown, it was likely we weren’t alone. We all agreed to stay on our toes, then set off.

The entire building was exactly as the lobby. Sterile hallways of a hospital with the occasional flickering light inter-cut with hallways of an old, musky funeral home lit by warm, struggling lamp bulbs. Some of the stretches were long, others very short, and though the building on the outside mainly looked like the medical center, the more we walked, the harder it became to tell if the interior was more hospital than home.

What was interesting is that unlike Zane’s, where the back hallways were nothing more than the rig’s base form, this one filled every nook and cranny, whether I knew it or not. That fact made me very nervous. We passed the same oil painting on a funeral wall 3 different times in our sweep of the first floor, and I began to wonder if this place too, like Zane’s had turned into an infinite expanse already. Relief washed over me, however, when after a while of moving, we came back out the other side of the hallway to the lobby that we’d neglected in our first journey out.

Though there was a lot of space to sweep, it was surprisingly easy to check it all. Since most offshoots in the hallways were hospital rooms, all it took was a quick glance inside to confirm that the great steel door we were seeking wasn’t inside. It was the funeral home sections that were more difficult. The rooms that branched out from them were often bigger. Meeting hall areas for after funeral processions, kitchens for catered food prep, disturbing sections that were embalming rooms with body storage lockers. We left those pretty quickly, none of us too fond of looking around.

The weird thing was that I hadn’t ever seen the rooms before. Nowhere in my memory of the home had I ever seen where the sausage was made, let alone some of the storage areas or offices. There were spaces like this too with the hospital side, but they were never quite right. The details were always very weird and off, almost like a dream. The legs on tables and chairs seemed too long for a normal person to be comfortable with. Parts of the wallpaper or wooden panels would blur and smear together as if nothing more than paint, but reaching out and touching it would reveal that it was somehow built that way.

The whole thing felt like the rig was trying to read my imagination to fill in the blanks. It was as if the busted rig needed to fill out the entire building, but with no more material to work with, it just started repeating scenes and pulled from what I’d always imagined to be behind the curtain.

After finishing the first floor, the girls and I took a break. My bones (and I’m sure theirs too) was aching bad from so much physical activity that morning, and we had skipped breakfast so that we could get an early move on to the cliff before something showed up (a plan that obviously didn’t pay off). We needed food and quick rest, so together, we stepped off into the gift shop in the lobby and slouched between some racks.

Hope cracked a can of peaches we’d gotten from my old home, then one by one, we plucked them out, passing the can for the next in line to take their turn. While waiting for mine, I checked my phone to see the time, finding that it’d been a few hours since we’d arrived. My stomach felt ill when I began wondering about the Hensley at the bottom of the ladder, and how far along she’d be by now.

I stood and looked out the window of the gift shop, these ones actually functioning as windows rather than the fake ones back at my old house. I didn’t see the creature stalking the woods anymore, and that made me lose my appetite. Maybe Ann was right, though. Maybe it would go back down and find that growing lump, then she wouldn’t have to worry about being trapped in this hell at all. Maybe it was for the best.

“Hen?” June softly spoke.

I turned to see her sticking the can out to me.

Reluctantly, I took it, then forced a peach down. As I chewed, I turned away from the window and looked around the space, hoping to find something else that might steal my attention. I found it in the form of a book rack.

Slowly, I crept toward it, swallowing the sweet, syrupy lump of fruit right as I reached the shelf. With a soft, solemn smile, I reached out and brushed my fingers over a book three shelves up, taking it in my hand and looking down at the thing fondly.

“Find something interesting?” Hope called, curious for my sudden meandering.

Smiling, I turned around and held up the cheesy, dumb romance novel that I’d found. The same one I had bought for mom while she stayed here. The one we never got to finish reading.

I could tell it hurt to look at, but Hope and June seemed to share in my sentiment. It was a rose; painful to hold, but containing something so beautiful and sweet. Something that brought Mom joy in her final days, and something that we were able to enjoy together. For all of my sour memories from this time, I was pretty surprised to find that I harbored no ill will to the cheap paperback.

Apparently, Ann didn’t feel the same.

“Why this place?” she asked softly.

“Huh?” Hope questioned.

“Why here? The hospital and the funeral home? Two of the worst places from our lives?”

Hope looked at me, then back to Ann, trying to speak as warmly as possible, “Ann, it doesn’t mean anything, I don’t think. These rigs always pull places that were important to us; even the bad ones.”

Hope was smiling, trying to ease whatever was plaguing our sister, but when Ann looked up with a dark expression on her face, Hope’s smile vanished, and the air got thick.

“Are you sure about that?”

Hope, unsure of how to respond, knitted her brow and shook her head, “I… I’m not sure what you mean—are you okay Ann?”

The girl stared at Hope a little longer, then at me, then sighed, dropping her expression and standing, “Nothing. Forget it. It’s not important. We need to keep moving.”

I could tell that Hope wasn’t a fan of that idea; she wanted to get to the bottom of whatever just happened, but after how badly she’d just flopped it, I think she decided that trying again later was the better move.

The four of us headed back out into the hospital, finding a staircase and starting up. It too was an amalgamation of hospital and funeral steps, signaling that the next floor would be more of the same, but as we climbed, there was one difference. The organ that had been playing got louder, no longer muffled by a floor. It had to be on this same level.

The whole time we’d been exploring, the music hadn’t ceased at all or changed in volume, so we assumed that it had to be a recording playing somewhere, and more importantly, it wasn’t moving. That meant its source was stationary, I.E, not a monster. That was at least a reassurance.

Heading into the second floor and running off that assumption, we decided to head toward it first to investigate. Zane’s had recordings playing too when Hope and I visited that rig, and while it hadn’t led to anything important, here it was really the only thing of note. If we didn’t find the door anywhere else on this floor, we’d have to go there eventually. May as well knock it out now.

We were all a little more on edge this time as we crept closer to where the music echoed from. Not bumping into anything on the first floor meant that if something was in here with us, it would be somewhere up here, and it was a lot farther to an exit on this floor that it was on the first. Combine that with the confusing, repetitive layout, and if we needed to make a run for it, I was very worried we might not make it far.

The music was also a big put off. We’d grown used to its drone by now, but it was more the volume that gave me chills. After living in the silence of the abyss for so long now, noise has become a sort of harkening for danger. It’s usually either coming from a beast, or it’s attracting one. Anytime now that there’s a loud eruption of sound, it makes my skin crawl; that’s why working our way up the cliffside with all of our racket was such a nightmare.

Still, I pushed past that writhing feeling beneath my skin in order to draw closer to the organ. We could see where we assumed its source was now; a slice of funeral home with two sturdy double doors on the inner wall of the building. It looked very official, and I recognized the golden finish handles on those doors right away. I’d once spent a whole day staring at them, dreading what I was going to face on the other side until it was finally time to step through.

I suppose now was no different.

Ann reached the door first, that same dark look on her face as back at the gift shop as she eyed the handle. Without further delay, she pushed them in.

The ceiling was the only thing that was out of place. Long and high—so high I couldn’t see the top. Like the past areas in rigs before it, it seemed this was where the abyss found its way in, darkness looming just overhead.

Other than that, the service parlor was identical to the way it was set up the day of my mother’s funeral.

Rows of old wooden pews layered one after the next down the long, rectangular chamber, small bouquets of pansies and tulips affixed to each of their ends. Ahead, all the way down the aisle, the pulpit waited. A pulpit where a random man who hardly even knew my mother once stood and talked about how we needed to ‘look at the good she left behind in these dark times’.

I remember being angry when he said that. As if there was any good left now that she was gone.

Before it, there was a long table set with several things. Two more bouquets, much more extravagant than the simple ones on the pews. There was a large board propped up on a stand plastered with pictures of my smiling mother, some of them even with me and my dad. He still has them all in a box under his bed, and sometimes when I visit, he would ask if I wanted to pull them out and look at them. I always declined.

Now I guess I had to look whether I liked it or not.

There was also other things on the table; clothes she often wore, trinkets that she was fond of. These were all piled and laid around the main centerpiece on the table, however.

A golden urn, glinting softly in the warm, dull light from the lamps on the sides of the room.

I was pissed. I was more than that—I was livid. The audacity of the rig to rip this memory from my mind and throw it up in front of me like some sort of museum. Not only that, but to pull my mother herself—her fucking \*ashes—\*and set them before me again like a cheap replica. As if the first urn full of corpse dust was even a semblance of anything that could fill the gap my mother left—the rig wanted to give me another? Yeah, I was pissed, but what pissed me off even more was what was in the middle of the room that I neglected to mention.

A sliver of hospital ran through the hall where we currently stood, enough to compose most of a hospital room. I recognized all of that part too. The chair that I used to sleep in. the TV mounted on the wall that I used to watch with Dad while Mom slept.

The hospital bed that my mother died in, her IV’s and equipment lingering nearby like ghosts come to haunt me.

The fact that the rig put these two rooms together—stitched them that way like some sick joke—it was all I had to not finally snap. To not finally have my Hope moment and scream and shout and cuss and kick. It wouldn’t be to anyone specific, just this godforsaken abyss. Just scream up into the darkness above for mocking me so horrifically after everything it had already done. The only reason I was able to hold my composure, however, was because of what was at the back of the room.

Against the far wall, right next to the organ that was running loops of songs once played on its old weathered keys, was the Kingfisher door.

Ann wasn’t like me, though. She couldn’t hold her composure.

We stood motionless by the door for a long time, taking the scene in with disbelief before she took off down the aisle. Her boots stomped hard and angry, and as she passed each pew, she stopped to rip off the flowers and chuck them hard into the wall. Petals went flying like confetti as she made her way up, and though it was rather intense, none of us attempted to stop her. We all understood. Even Hope.

It got harder though, the further she went with it. Watching her shatter the big glass bouquet vases wasn’t an issue other than the noise, but witnessing her tear apart the board of pictures was. We winced as she tore at the blouse my mother always wore and tossed her old stuffed animals into the sterile hospital section of the room. Hope finally spoke up when Ann grabbed the golden urn and lifted it high above her head, ready to smash it down.

“Ann!” she gasped quickly.

Ann stopped, shooting her a glance with teary eyes as if she’d just been jarred from a trance. Her shock quickly faded though, and returned to anger. Through choked sobs, she said, “It’s not her. It doesn’t fucking matter—it’s not even her!”

“I know…” Hope returned softly, “I get it. I really do. But just… please?”

Ann’s face returned to a space between emotions, her crushing grief trying to prevail against her boiling rage. Tears streaked more furiously down her cheeks, and she shook her head, still clutching the urn tightly, “So this is me, huh?”

Hope shook her head, just as confused as back at the gift shop, “What… what do you mean?”

Ann scoffed venomously and slammed the urn back down on the table, looking around and gesturing, “This! This rig. That’s what you said this morning, right, Hensley? The rigs are manifestations of us?”

I felt my skin go numb, followed by a sinking feeling in my gut. My mouth fell open to speak, but all that came out was, “Ann, I-I didn’t mean—”

“Save it. I heard every word; I was out in the hall. Figures right? The most jaded, bitch-of-a-person out of all of us came from the worst days of our lives? I guess you all were right, I really am the worst of us.”

“Ann that’s not—”

“No, no, no, Hen, it’s okay,” Ann interrupted, mocking with fake understanding, “I need a good reality check, right? This is good. This is good that now I can’t deny how much of a major piece of shit I am.”

Hope did what Hope does and tried to step forward, “Ann, if you really heard everything then you also heard me talking about how that’s not true. I know that’s not all you are.”

“Save it, Hope,” Ann scoffed, “You said that because it made *you* feel better about what you said, but let’s get real; people like you don’t just snap and say things to hurt people. You bottle up bitter truths and resentments, then spit them back out when you need ammo—that’s what we’ve done our whole lives. It’s what we did to Trevor before skipping town too. Or, should I say that’s what *I* did since it’s my fault we’re here?”

“Ann, that’s not true.” Hope shook her head, starting to tear up now too under the stress.

Ann furrowed her brow and put on a smug thinking face, “You know, funny you say that because I’ve been thinking the same thing. I have since I woke up on this damn rock. I don’t think it’s my fault that we’re here. I think it’s somebody else’s, but heaven forbid she admits that.”

“What is that supposed to mean?” Hope squinted, “Ann, we can’t help that we ended up here. I told you I didn’t mean that when I said—”

“No, Hope, you were right. It was my fault, but remember, I didn’t exist yet so that means it can only have been one other ‘Hensely’. I tried to tell you that last time, but you didn’t listen.”

I finally cut in. At first I was being quiet to let Ann deal with the emotions of the situation, but this was a waste of time, and we needed to move, “Guys, cut it out,” I snapped, “It's no one's fault we're here! No one except the people that built these damn rigs."

"No! Wrong! Try again!" Ash snapped, whirring on her heels to jab a finger at me.

Guilt sizzled against my chest; I was well aware of what she meant, but I didn’t want to give her the satisfaction, "What do you want me to say, Ann?" 

"No, enough with the 'Ann' bullshit. My name is Hensley. *Her* name is Hensley," clone 4 told me, stabbing a hand at June. "All of our names are Hensley because we. Are. You. And we're here, 'Hensley prime' because you decided that it was better to run, hide and sulk from your issues rather than face them!"

"Ann, that's enough," Hope gently cooed, still trying her best to diffuse.

Ann ignored her, keeping her eyes on me, "None of us asked to be here. You dragged us into this place like shit on the bottom of your shoe because you wanted to sulk down the highway for weeks on end. If we had just answered Trevor’s calls, if we had just told Dad about the cancer and gone home, we would have never gotten spirited off to this place, and we would be home safe with them right now."

My mouth fell open, but no words came out. She had a point. A very good one. One that I had thought about every night since I got here.

"I miss Trevor too." Ann spit, "I miss home and Dad and our friends—friends that probably hate us now, by the way, because we ghosted them for months on end before we even got here! But the fact of the matter is that we're trapped now, probably for good. So if we *really* want to talk about who’s fault it is that we’re here, Hensley and 'Hope'," Ash mockingly flourished at my number 2, "We're here because of *you*."

The room went silent again. Dead silent. The organ was still playing, but I couldn’t hear it. My own eyes stared me down with pure malice from 10 feet away, and though I’d always hated myself, I didn’t know true self loathing until I saw Ann’s face in that moment.

She was right. That was the worst part. No matter what Hope told me, no matter how poor of a mental state I was in back then, there was no reason for me to have walked out on my own life like that. All my friends. All of my family. The only single person who was somehow able to tolerate all of my shit. I just left them because the pain of that was easier to swallow than the pain of being with them.

The worst part was, I’d dragged 3 other people in here with me, and left the 4^(th) bleeding out on the asphalt below us.

  I didn’t have anything to say after that. Nobody did. Ann and I’s starring contest lasted a few more minutes before I slowly began to move toward her. She held her ground, expecting me to do something, but I just moved past, slipping my keycard from my pocket and stepping up onto the stage. I slapped the small piece of plastic to the reader, then pressed the button on the door.

The wheels began to grind along their track, drowning out the organ’s somber tune, and I didn’t bother looking back at my clones. Not until another sound joined the chorus, loud and far above everything else.

Screaming. Blood-curdling, raw, visceral screaming. Somewhere deep down the halls of the same floor, something had woken up at the sound of the door’s rumble, and the scariest part was, by its tone, it sounded human.

That was enough to spin me around. The other three me’s looked at one another, then scrambled up to the platform by my side while we waited for the door. My heart pounded in my chest as I pivoted my head between the entrance and the bunker, praying that it opened before whatever was out there got to us. It was getting closer fast, however.

Then, the screaming stopped. For three full seconds, it went dead silent. We all held our breath as the door finally opened enough for us to slip through, but we still had to wait for it to complete before shutting. Once we were on the other side and turned around, the shrieking started up again.

Down the hall. Getting closer.

Then nothing. One second, two. Five. Six.

The pattern continued as the door clunked to a halt, then Ann pounded the shut button. The rusted wheels began back along the track, and we held our breath again.

The screaming didn’t kick up again before the beast in the halls reached us.

It was silent. Hauntingly so. The double doors creaked open, and what came through made my limbs weak.

It was jet black as the abyss and massive, nearly the size of a small car. The head of a serpent. Its dark, slick scales glistened in the dull light of the room as it drew near, but it wasn’t slithering on the ground. It was floating. Its massive, elongated form slithered through the air as if it were a dragon without the dancers, slowly writhing closer and closer. It had no eyes, just two gaping holes in the side of its scaly skull, and its mouth was simply a long, open pit that disappeared into its gullet of purple and grey tissue.

At least, that’s what it looked like for only a moment.

Its appearance was black until it hovered over the section of the room that was hospital. As soon as it did, its front half changed. The back of its body still out the door remained black scales, but anything over the line shimmered and flipped over like tiny tumbling stones, revealing a pale, porcelain white underneath. The snake’s mouth opened wide, folded itself back over its own head, and from deep within its jaws, I saw something squeeze out.

A new head. A perfectly sculpted, pale mask of porcelain sprouted out and consumed the creature’s face. Its eyes too, were dark sockets, its all too human lips parted just enough to release that hellish screaming that we’d been hearing down the halls. From its now white scales, small silvery quills like syringe needles shot out between the gaps, and its movement became more jerky and violent as it jostled through the air.

It was that way again until it once again reached the funeral side of the room, at which point the mask made a sound like a neck snapping, turned 90 degrees, then was slurped back into the snake's gut. It’s mouth returned to normal, its scales flipped back to black, and it continued its hauntingly silent crawl toward us.

The girls and I reflexively took a step backward into the control room, but it wouldn’t help so long as we were at the mercy of the doors. Luckily, right as the beast bumped the pulpit over, the doors shut, and we had just enough time to see it lunge before hearing a hard thump against the barrier.
