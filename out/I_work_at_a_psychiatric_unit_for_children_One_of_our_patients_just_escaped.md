“Mama.”

That’s all I ever heard that kid say.

Just, “Mama.”

Now, I meet a lotta kids that got something off about them, working security for a child psychiatric hospital. But something was different about that kid, Edward.

Real different. As in, *scary* different.

I’ll start by saying, I ain’t gotta fix any of these kids. I mean, some of ‘em don’t ever get better. I’m just here to make sure they’re not hurting nobody or themselves while they get treatment.

And treatment, that’s up to the docs. Tri-City hospital has got some of the best. I think we were top five or something like that, before all this went down.

Now, I don’t say all this to make things worse on Tri-City. Don’t get me wrong: this place is *real* good to a *lot* of kids, especially kids that ain’t got anywhere else to turn. I’ve seen a lotta good done at Tri-City for all sorts of conditions, all ages.

I’m sharing all this as a warning, ‘cause I think the hospital’s gonna cover this up. They already got lawyers and folks doing interviews, taking hard drives. I just don’t like the look of it. I don’t like knowing that the kid could be somewhere out there and nobody even knows what they’re up against.

I work the overnights at Tri-City, so I don’t see as much action as the daytime guys do. But when stuff does go down, it’s usually a big deal, being middle-of-the-night and all.

I saw Edward come in on what we call a “hot admit,” like some kinda meteor smashing into Earth and causing a volcano or whatever. (I don’t know astronomy, but you get the vibe.)

Hot-admits take a lot of security to handle right, but we got fewer numbers on the overnights, so that’s where I gotta get my hands dirty. Thanks to cameras and computers and stuff, I still got an eye on the rest of the ward in case something does flip while I’m helping with a patient.

Anyway, Edward was like, shouting, and covered in glass shards. A good Samaritan had brought him into the hospital ER after some kinda car crash off a farm-to-market road. The ER phoned up psych ward, knowing he was having post-traumatic issues, getting physically violent and all, so child psych staff came in.

By my next shift, Edward was physically stable and had been moved over from the ER. But like, mentally, the kid was beside himself.

The docs in child psych have some powerful meds, which usually give even the worst cases some peace. Not Edward though. 

I don’t know a ton about dosage, but they told me they gave him the highest CC’s that was safe for a kid his age, and even then he wasn’t going to sleep. Seemed a bit loopy, but even that didn’t really last.

The docs were worried, but to their credit, they weren’t panicking. They chalked that up to – what was it? Like, adrenaline, or something... Basically, Edward’s body was overpowering his meds in those first days and nights. Docs said he’d ease into it. Called him a “Teflon” case.

I said the overnights were quiet, right? Well, that was before Edward showed up. Docs called it “milieu contagion.”

It started slow, almost unrecognizable...

We have a real sweet girl named Kayleigh, who came in a few weeks ago after she had a breakdown. She’d been doing better. But then, she started this outburst one night that needed hands-on, almost a full take down, which we try not to ever do unless it’s totally needed, you know?

Then, it was one of the more troubled cases who acted up, like one night later. Benson was unit royalty, the type that might spend his whole life in-and-out of psych facilities. But he’d never needed a 4-point. That night, we had to strap him down. He’d even gotten ahold of a metal utensil. That sort of stuff gets *real* dangerous, *real* fast.

By the end of Edward’s second week, the docs had started diving into the patient files and the security recordings, trying to get to the root of what was going on. We had tens of kids in that second week that had needed attention, and that was just during night shift.

It wasn’t unheard of, to have the milieu start to lose control like that. You know, maybe it was a full moon sort of thing, which is pretty legit in the ER, I learned. But that’s case-by-case.

The psych unit was a true contagion, and I was face-to-face with Edward when the milieu took a turn for the worse. He’d tried to dart from his room while the staff was handling like two “bangers” and a “flooder” during a single Q15 check.

You know when the hair on your neck stands up? That’s what it felt like, standing between Edward and the end of his hallway. I don’t like thinking back on it.

“Mama” was all he said.

I told him, “We gotta get you back to your room, son.”

“Mama,” he muttered defiantly.

But I had him blocked. He obeyed. I brought him back to room fourteen and double-checked the locks.

We ended up having to call in extra staff that night. It was horrible. And it only stayed the same or got worse in the weeks to come. 

Worse, when I checked the tapes with the doctors, we could tell there was a connection of some kind, which is weird to say. But anytime a patient got triggered, Edward was lookin’ at them, near the edge of his room, I mean... it was *eerie* some of the stuff that we’d find on those videotapes.

I actually wasn’t surprised. I’d looked at the kid that second week. He’d made me feel real uneasy. I just couldn’t put my finger on why.

Now, like I said, daytime’s got most of our staff. Overnight, not so much. But that almost flipped after a month with Edward. Not to mention, the docs had no clue how to treat his condition. They didn’t even have a grip on what was going on. The research specialists were working overtime trying to get to the bottom of it.

I don’t get more patient info than what they’ve gotta share with me, you know, with privacy laws and whatnot. But that don’t mean those docs and nurses didn’t talk in the break room and stuff. Not that any of us got breaks when things really started to heat up, even with the extra staff we’d called in.

What I learned was about all the docs knew: Edward’s dad had died when he was real young, some kind of accident with a ladder. Then his momma, we didn’t know much about her, and they was doing their best to find her. Detectives from the PD started working that case, but with all the more violent crime they’ve gotta handle, it wasn’t an investigation getting far.

Kid was basically an orphan. A few more weeks and they might have had something figured about it. But we didn’t make it that far, 'cause it all came to a head.

See, Edward had turned himself into what they all called a "milieu leader," and not in a good way.

Worse, if they tried taking Edward into isolation, the rest of the milieu just acted out worse when he was gone. At a certain point, the nurses said they weren’t running things. They were just tip-toeing around the new normal until the docs could figure out a solution.

I came in for my shift last Wednesday right after dinner, when all the kids get their last activity and doses before lights out. As soon as I showed up, I knew something was off. There was a *flight risk* situation in the reception area: Kayleigh had tried to run, something that was totally out of sorts for the poor girl.

As I’d made my way further into the ward, there were already three mechanicals underway, where they gotta four-point a patient on the gurney for safety reasons.

Mikey, head of security, was out of breath. I don’t think he’d had a bite to eat all day, and looked white as a ghost. Usually he gives me the rundown at shift change, but he only had one word for me when I’d walked in: “Help.”

“Should we call in aux from the PD?” I asked.

We’d never brought in cops, but it was way down the list of options when something like this happened.

“We did,” he groaned. “They keep getting called back out. Longest any of them stayed was ten minutes before some crap went down in the ‘hood.’”

Mikey sighed, “We’re on our own.”

I’d nodded, seeing we were up against it.

I marched past him, promising, “I’ll suit up and check the computers. Let’s get it under control.”

I turned the corner. The floors were soaking wet, water pouring out of rooms three and five. Not one, but *two* flooders.

I radioed it to Mikey before reaching the office. I couldn’t believe my eyes when I got in there.

I think every single kid was code green.

And no, *green* does not mean good. It’s the code we use for rare – but violent – outbursts. Tonight, they weren’t rare. Like, at all.

Except Edward. He was just sitting cross-legged in fourteen.

I jumped into action, coordinating with the staff, doing days of work in an hour.

Pretty quick I’d realized why Mikey was looking so wiped. We were battling something here. In all my years, I’d never heard of anything like this.

*What the hell was going on?*

The head doc, Lars, who I never got a lot of facetime with, was working a double just like Mikey. I found him in the security office after realizing I needed to hydrate.

“Fourteen. I need to get patients in there.”

He tapped a badly-chewed pencil on Edward’s camera feed.

“Doc...”

I wasn’t no stranger to room fourteen’s resident. Nobody was by now.

“We don’t have a choice," he interrupted. We got two flooders and we need to get the milieu back under control for the sake of the kids’ safety.”

“We need line-of-sight and one-to-one on Edward,” I made clear.

“Of course,” he agreed, taking Mikey’s key fob off the table and walking back out toward fourteen. “We’ll keep line-of-sight.”

“Help!!!”

It was Mikey, who I could see on one of the other feeds. He’d tried to restrain one of the oldest kids in the ward, the age who’d soon graduate to adolescent care if he didn’t improve.

Soon, with my help, we'd got the bigger kid stable again. Thank goodness too, ‘cause until the ER folks could help, we were out of restraints and gurneys.

But it wasn’t just the older kid who'd calmed down. It was all of them.

Like someone had snapped their fingers, the whole building went silent, besides the water still trickling out of the flooders’ rooms.

“What in the...?” Mikey wondered aloud.

I shrugged, considering, “Something, like, in the air that got filtered out? Mold, monoxide?”

A frantic *shriek* broke the silence. I’ll never forget how horrifying that sound was. 

It was coming from room fourteen, end of the second hallway.

Dr. Lars was face down, his body jammed in the open doorway.

“Code blue!”

“Where’s the patient?” I asked the screaming nurse, seeing that Mikey already had the ER unit next door on alert.

“The room was empty when I got here,” she told me, tears streaking down her cheeks.

I sprinted toward the security office, cussing under my breath. My pulse was off the charts. We’d lost line-of-sight. Never had it in the first place.

When I got there, the whole system doing a manual reboot. Not a single camera was on.  

I took off again, this time toward the reception area. Almost knocked over the ER staff as they ran toward fourteen with their gurneys.

“Edward!” I shouted, to no reply.

“Edward!!!”

When I reached the front doors, the only thing in the parking lot was the freshly arrived ambulance.

I was out of breath. I didn’t even notice Benson, still restrained in the corner of the room.

“He’s not here anymore.”

“Who?”

Benson answered, something I’ll never forget.

“The evil.”

Sent *chills* through me, man. 

“...The evil’s not here anymore.”

Benson was smiling ear-to-ear and looked totally at peace. Almost relieved.

The other kids were too, the ones who I saw the rest of that night.

They were *relieved* Edward was gone.

And I was too.

Like I said though, they didn’t call in those detectives. Haven't seen it on the news either.

Tri-City ownership didn’t want their top-five award taken away. They didn't wanna cause a stir. So they fired Mikey, since it was his key fob that opened the door. Nobody cared when I told them it all wasn’t his fault. Told me to keep quiet or I'd be next to go.

And I did, for a bit. But it's already gotten to me.

The constant anxiety and the nightmares, they won't stop.

Somewhere, Edward’s out there. 

And whoever “Mama” is, she don’t even know it.
