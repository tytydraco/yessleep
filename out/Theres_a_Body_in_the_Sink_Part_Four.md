When I next woke, it was to fingers gently combing through my hair.

I found myself lying on my side, knees half-curled toward my chest, cheek pressed to something rough and bony. In front of me were a row of white hospital beds, and on the farthest bed lay a man hooked up to an IV and a heart monitor. The dividing curtain that sectioned him off from the rest of the room was pulled halfway through its rod, obscuring his face; the rest of his body was covered by a blanket. The only feature of his I could see was his arm, riddled with open wounds that were swarming with maggots.

“Do you know what it’s like, to be shipped across the waters and brought to strange lands?” Eyeless Mary asked above me.

My nose wrinkled as the scent of slowly-decaying flesh hit. It smelled just as I remembered it, just as it had been when my father’s body stopped healing itself and instead started to rot alive. That powdery, sour smell that would scrape down my throat and linger on my tongue, no matter how much I tried to hack or spit it out.

“Presented to the masses like an animal,” Mary continued. “Something to be gawked and marveled at.”

Another memory hit me—a hazy one of sitting in class on a bright, sunny afternoon. My history teacher was running us through the American colonization period. I’d flipped the textbook open a little too far, and the black and white image of a child in a cage stared up at me. The kid was small and emaciated, wide-eyed as she looked at the audience gathered around her enclosure.

It was a human zoo, I later learned. The Americans had taken indigenous Filipinos and shipped them to the States to be put in attractions.

“They brought me miles away from home as a package of salvation for your people,” Mary said. “The Spaniards called you savages, with your nature spirits and animal gods. They brought me and my son to steer you away from the fiery depths of hell—and into their ships were they could enslave and sell and violate you.”

I rolled onto my back as best as I could to look at her. A wince escaped me at the movement; my shoulders smarted, my biceps burned. It felt like something was squirming under the skin of my forehead, fighting to break through the epidermis.

“I was given to you as peace and love and hope.” Mary stared out at the mostly-barren hospital room, a serene smile on her face as she spoke. “And they slaughtered you while you knelt in front of me.”

She laughed, bright and airy and carefree. My skin prickled.

“Of course, that was the point of it. I was part of the valiant excuse your colonizers wielded while they burned everything to the ground. It made them feel *good,* bringing salvation. My supposed nature never clashed with my purpose.” Mary ceased combing through my hair to grip my chin. “What does it feel like to live in a post-apocalyptic world, Ryan? There’s nearly nothing left of your ancestors aside from your blood and bones, you know?”

“Why are you here again?” I asked instead. Entertaining Mary only got me dead blood poured down my throat. I wanted answers, this time. “Why do you keep haunting me?”

“I haunt everyone.” She slid her hand up the side of my face and patted my cheek. “I just like you.”

Bile coated the inside of my mouth. “And…why…do you like me?”

“Because you listen.” She poked my nose. “You’re the only one in this house who listens.”

If she were the house—or whatever malevolence that made its corners breathe and its walls bleed—then she wouldn’t have warned me about the water. Warned *everyone,* it seemed, if she was telling the truth. “What are you?”

Her smile widened, lips peeling back to bare gums and teeth. “Say, Ryan,” she said. “Do you know what it’s like to be a vessel for heaven when the worship you receive is hell?” She rested her hand on my temple, her thumb poised right in the middle of my forehead, where the pulsing, squirming thing under my skin thrashed and writhed. “It’s maddening with its contradictions. My head always feels like it’s about to split open.”

Her nail cleaved straight through my skull.

\-

I woke—in the real and dull exhaustion of the waking world, this time—to the sound of Anika praying. For a moment, I thought I’d fallen into a deeper layer of my dream instead, that the monotone drone of recited psalms was the auditory backdrop Mary had chosen for this nightmare. But Leo peered in from the corner of my vision, and the sight of him damp and disheveled looked too mundanely bleary for something she could have created. It looked nothing like the cranked-up colors and head-achingly sharp saturation of my dreams. I sat up.

Foam dipped under my weight. I’d expected to have to peel myself off the kitchen floor, but the others must have moved me to the couch while I was unconscious.

I surveyed the lightless, empty room. Instead of Bonifacio Grove’s pristine interior, the walls here were a peeling mess of paint and grime; the floor was bare of its carpet, and the boards were termite-worn. Even the couch I was sitting on was threadbare.

Maybe the flood had washed the house of all its cosmetics—if this even was still Bonifacio Grove. Perhaps it just had the bones and shape of it, and we were sitting in the belly of something completely other.

“Where’s everyone?” I asked as I felt for where I’d hit my head earlier. Surprisingly, nothing stung under my fingers, no blood came away. I’d hit my head, I was sure of it, but my skin was smooth and unbroken.

“Anika’s in her room. Dominic’s asleep.” Leo jerked his thumb toward the hallway. “Sam and Charles are trying to see if any of the appliances still work so we can make some food. No luck so far.”

I abandoned trying to find injury on my head—I was either dreaming that I’d gotten hurt or this was another one of the house’s oddities, and if I thought about things too long, I would go mad—and instead eyed the light switch, then the dark hallway. Either the lights were busted too, or this place just didn’t have electricity anymore.

I got to my feet. My socks squelched; I grimaced at the disgusting sensation of wet cloth sticking to my toes. I needed to dry off.

Surprisingly, my things were in my room when I came up: my mattress, my packed bags, my phone. They were just caked in dust like they’d been abandoned for years. I pulled my wet clothes off and changed into fresh ones—relatively fresh, as they smelled of the must and age that came with forgotten things—then checked my phone to see if it still worked. It didn’t. Plugging it into an outlet didn’t wake it up either.

I clicked the light switch on—off—on—nothing. No electricity, then.

With a sigh, I ducked back into the hallway. Anika was still praying in her room, her voice thin and reedy; some of her syllables rose and hitched like she was barely keeping herself from crying. *“Lead us not into temptation,”* she said…then paused. Too long. *“And deliver—deliver us from evil.”*

I thought of my mother, curled fetal in her seat as my father’s corpse laid in the hospital bed. *“My God, my God,”* she’d cried, nails gouging red lines into her neck and collarbone. *“Why have you forsaken me?”*

I headed for the stairs to leave Anika to her grief. The floorboards creaked under my heels—the sound almost swallowed the faint sobbing that came from Elise’s room. But I heard it, over the woody croak, and turned so fast my neck twinged with pain.

I wrenched Elise’s door open, nearly tearing it off its rusted, brittle hinges. But there was nothing inside. Nothing at all. The room was bare of even furniture: it was just an empty, windowless space of crumbling walls and hole-ridden floorboards. Even the bathroom door was gone.

My throat bobbed. I closed the door. As soon as the latch clicked, Elise’s crying resumed from the other side like someone had hit play on a recording.

“…Elise?” I called out, softly, hesitantly.

*“Ryan?”* she responded, to my surprise. I grabbed the doorknob, tempted to pull the door open again; the thought of finding it empty and Elise’s voice disappearing—this time perhaps permanently—stopped me. *“Where are you?”*

“I’m…” My grip tightened. The cold metal pressed painfully into my feverish skin. “I’m right outside your door, Elise.”

A sniff. *“What door?”* she asked. *“There’s no doors or windows here anymore. I just—I looped back and everything was gone.”*

Oh. Shit. *Shit.*

Was she in the real Bonifacio Grove, then? The version of the house we’d been in before we’d gotten swept away? Or was *this* Bonifacio Grove now, and Elise had looped back into the version of it discarded by reality? I didn’t know, I didn’t know *how* I could even begin to know.

*“Ryan?”* Elise called out timidly. *“It’s dark here. I’m scared.”*

I swallowed. If she was in some previous incarnation of the house, perhaps I could find her by going back into the sink—so I rushed down to the kitchen. I reached the hallway and found no ominous shape bulging from the lip of the basin, indicating the presence of a corpse head peering out. That made it easier to rush to the counter and check if the water was still unnaturally deep, if it still led to those impossible depths that flooded out the wall Dominic kicked in.

But there was nothing in the sink. No black water, no otherworldly flood. The only thing that stared back at me was the grimy bottom of the basin and its rusty drain. Like the rest of the house, it appeared as if it hadn’t been used in years, as if we hadn’t just climbed out of there hours ago.

I couldn’t get to Elise. I couldn’t even go back to that flooded house. I was stuck here, and I knew, with the dread of someone who knew futility, that Elise was stuck wherever she was too.

“I’m sorry,” I said, helpless, frustrated, and feeling just a little insane.

\-

The others couldn’t hear her.

Of course they couldn’t. That seemed to be the trend around this house, people not witnessing things they were supposed to. Things that were right there. No matter if it was Anika, or Sam, or Charles, or Leo, or Dominic, who pressed their ear to Elise’s door, they couldn’t hear her crying on the other side.

“You’re going as crazy as that Bible thumper, man.” Dominic leaned back against the wall across Elise’s unit and crossed his arms. “You gotta be careful or else you’re gonna—” He jerked his head toward Anika’s room, where she’d immediately returned to after complying with my request to check Elise’s door. She was praying again, the rise and fall of her litanies now white noise to me from how much I’d gotten used to it in the past few hours.

“Is it really such a strange thing to believe?” I pressed two fingers to the itchy, heated skin below my eyes and tried to massage out the heaviness there. “We had to crawl out of the sink. The house is” — I motioned to the walls and ceiling — “it doesn’t even look like our house anymore.”

Our group fell silent.

Charles coughed. “I don’t think anything’s unbelievable, at this point,” he said. “The cops and that pastor couldn’t see the head in the sink. Maybe this is just like that.”

“Yeah, but those guys weren’t the ones being haunted by whatever the fuck’s going on with this place.” Dominic’s lips curled into a jeer as he narrowed his eyes at me. “And why’re *you* the only one who can hear Elise? You supposed to be special or something?”

I pressed down on my irritated skin harder. Eyeless Mary’s condescending coo rang in my ears: *“You’re the only one in this house who listens.”*

“…no.” I dropped my hand to my side. “It has to be the house.”

Leo fidgeted with his sleeve. “Well…what do we do now? Like, can we help Elise or something?”

Another awkward silence. Leo’s gaze flitted around—looking for suggestions, for someone else to pick up the topic—but Sam and Charles only averted their eyes. Dominic glared. I had no answers either, so I just dropped my attention to my shoes.

Sam cleared his throat. “We’ll…figure something out.” He forced that patient, empty smile on his lips. “If we managed to swim our way out of that strange flood, we can probably find a way out of this place.”

Dominic scoffed. “Positive thinking, really?”

Sam chuckled and scratched his cheek. “Well, it’s better than losing our heads, right? Situation’s crazy enough.”

“Whatever.” Dominic pushed off the wall and headed downstairs. “Talk to me when all that bullshit actually solves something.”

“Dominic,” I called out, before he could descend. He stopped by the landing and looked over his shoulder, an irritated frown on his face. I pushed through. “Have…have you dreamt of a woman with no eyes?”

He flinched, his shoulder stiffening to a rigid line. I stood a little straighter, attention caught. “Have you dreamt of an eyeless Virgin Mary?” I pushed through. “Has she told you to keep away from the water?”

Dominic’s shock contorted to something ugly. *“No.”*

With that, he stomped down the stairs. I looked to the others—they wouldn’t meet my eyes. I tried anyway: “Have you guys—”

*“No,* Ryan,” Charles said. “Stop fucking talking about—stop listening to the shit that’s haunting us.”

But I couldn’t be sure if she was. Maybe she was something else, something that hung over this place but wasn’t necessarily cruel, something pulled here and there by the contradiction of her existence, and so she tormented in one breath and assisted in the other.

The others walked away before I could voice my thoughts.

\-

Dominic parked himself on one of the living room couches and refused to be disturbed, so that left me, Charles, Sam, and Leo to search the estate for possible exits. Unfortunately, this weathered version of Bonifacio Grove still had no doors or windows that led outside. Forcibly carving out an exit held the possibility of another flood washing us away, so we forfeited the option.

“We could try breaking the ceiling?” Sam suggested, when we regrouped in the library after two hours of scouring the house for anything that could get us out of here—I estimated that it had been two hours, anyway. All the clocks in the estate were dead, and the analog ones mounted on the walls were frozen at 11:11.

Leo’s expression pinched. “What if we get more water in the house again?”

Nobody answered. I glanced toward the hallway—toward the kitchen—then prodded at my itching eyes once more. They felt hot and tired. I hadn’t slept or eaten in hours.

Charles sagged into his seat with a sigh. He craned his head back, baring his throat as he buoyed his gaze skyward. “We’re going to die here, aren’t we?”

“Don’t say that,” Sam chided. “We’ll probably be giving the house what it wants if we give up.”

“Yeah, but what the hell are we even supposed to do?” Charles lifted his hands to motion around us, then dropped them listlessly to his sides. “No way out, can’t *make* a way out, our phones are dead, we can’t charge them, we’re hungry as fuck…”

“Has anyone tried the landline?” Sam straightened. “Those things get a different power supply, right? Even if the house doesn’t have electricity, they should be fine.”

Leo lifted a hand. “I checked it out earlier. Dead.”

“Damn.”

“Yeah, so we can’t call for help either.” Charles pushed out a loud, weary sigh, and kicked his chair back so it balanced on its back legs. “I don’t know what this place wants with us, man. I mean, it’s not killing us right away, so—what? Does it just want to torture us or something? Keep us trapped, make us starve, watch us die slow?”

Tears pooled at the edges of his eyes. He blinked rapidly and set his chair back on the floor with a loud thud. “I mean” — his voice climbed, went nasally — “I don’t get it. If it can take away the windows and the doors and summon a shitton of water, it could just end all of this at any time. So why the *fuck”* — the table jolted as he banged his fist on it — “are w still here? Why the *fuck”* — another hit — “are we still alive?”

He curled in on himself, breaths harsh and shoulders shaking.

“One of us is stuck in some other place we can’t see or hear, and another’s just desperately praying non-stop. I can’t fucking stand hearing the praying anymore. She just goes on and on, and it’s not going to do anything. Nobody’s fucking listening. Nobody’s going to help. Nobody ever does.” His hands found their way up to his scalp and grabbed fistfuls of his hair. “I feel like I’m going crazy,” he hissed. *“I feel like I’m losing my mind.”*

I was well-acquainted with the heartbreak of the faithful. Nearly everyone in my hometown was religious, so the fallout of disaster or disease or death was always laced with self-appointed guilt and hopeful reframing. It was either: *“God must be displeased with us, that’s why this happened,”* or *“It’s just a test—for He knows the plans He has for us, remember? Plans to prosper us and not to harm us.”*

The jaded devastation of the faithless—it existed in my periphery, and I am ashamed to say, deliberately so. It’s a different kind of agony, to see the world around you fall apart and have nothing to anchor yourself to. If you believed in a god, you could place the weight of your blame, your hurt, your misery on it; if you believed in a god, you could yoke your hopes and dreams to its hands, believe that somewhere out there, someone gives enough of a shit about you to pull some strings in the background, make sure you land on your feet once everything blows over. You can abdicate responsibility of your misfortune. You can abdicate your loneliness and isolation. A god is a self-soothing device, something you can dig your nails into when the agony spills past your mind’s capacity.

But if you don’t believe in a god, then things happen just because they happen, and you’re screaming, endlessly, into the massive black hole of the open mouth of the universe. The only person to carry every miserable thing in your life is yourself, and only ever yourself, the sum of cosmic coincidences that you are.

“We’re going to fucking die here,” Charles spat, tears streaming down his face. “Nobody cares, nobody gives a shit.”

\-

That night, or what passed for a night in that house, I laid on my mattress and just stared at my ceiling. Sleeping would invite Eyeless Mary to plague me again, and I had had enough of her cryptic words and senseless ‘help’. If she really wanted to aide me, she would have told me how to get out of this place, how to escape the loop that led me back to this house even after I’d put distance between it and myself.

Elise’s crying continued in the room across from me. Down the hall, Anika’s prayers harmonized with the sobs. It was hours of hours before the wretched ambience ceased, leaving the second floor in complete silence.

Bonifacio Grove was not in a noisy neighborhood, but it still had the sounds of life surrounding it; birds singing, trees rustling, people chatting as they ambled down the street—it was never dead quiet, never a vacuum of silence. With my other housemates asleep and Elise and Anika hushed,  it was like I was stuck in a sensory deprivation tank. Nothing stirred outside of the house, and nothing creaked within it. The sonic emptiness made the hairs on the back of my neck stand.

I got up; deliberately wrestled with my blanket just so I could hear the cloth rustle. I padded into the hallway with purposeful, audible steps, and stopped by Elise’s door. I didn’t want her to be crying constantly, but the lack of noise coming from her end was unnerving. I knocked.

“Elise?”

No answer. After another attempt at rousing her, and a minute to wait for her answer, I cracked the door open. The rusted hinges creaked.

Just like before, there was no one there. I pulled the door shut and waited for something, *anything*—nothing came. Elise must be—was hopefully just—asleep, wherever she was. I continued to Anika’s room.

“Anika?” I rapped my knuckle on her door thrice. “You okay?”

As with Elise, no answer. Shit, what if she was in trouble too? I took hold of the door knob—it was jammed when I twisted. Locked.

*“Anika?”* I called out with more alarm. I had to check—

Bony fingers slipped from the thin space between the doorframe and the door. I jumped back in surprise. The fingers curled around the door’s wooden edge, the side with the door latch—but did nothing to attack. Instead, it pulled the door inward, swinging it open.

I blinked and squinted as my eyes struggled to adjust to the darkness of Anika’s room. Compared to mine, the space was void of any furniture, and only had a single altar pressed flush to the rightmost wall. On it were a fleet of unlit, half-melted candles, which surrounded a decapitated statue of the Virgin Mary.

Strange. From what I knew of Anika’s religious denomination, she didn’t pray to the Virgin Mary.

“Anika?” I cautiously edged closer to doorway. I couldn’t see anyone. “Are you, um, are you in here?”

Maybe she was in the bathroom? I squinted harder, searching for the outline of her bathroom door on the walls. In my unit, it was on the left side, but on hers…

There was a large, weird lump on the floor. It looked almost human-shaped, with two legs and two arms splayed out, a torso and a head—

“Oh my god.’ I rushed into the room and dropped to my knees beside the prone form of Anika. “Anika! *Anika—shit!”*

I hadn’t immediately realized it was her because the front half of her body mass was gone. She’d looked like a mannequin, bisected sideways, the back half left lying on the ground.

“Anika!” I shook her shoulders. No response, save for her body dipping slightly from my grasp and melting into the floor. To my horror, I realized she was *sinking* into the floorboards. *“Fuck!”*

I got to my feet and pulled on the back of her shirt in an effort to yank her up. Her body didn’t move; the cloth in my hands just stretched and pulled taut.

*“Come on!”*

Footsteps thundered down the hall from outside. Sam, Leo, and Dominic reached the doorway a second later.

“Ryan?” Leo stepped in. “What is—oh shit!”

“The floor!” I desperately grabbed Anika’s shoulders again. She still didn’t budge. “She’s sinking into the floor!”

Sam darted to my side to assist me, but even with both of us trying to lift Anika to her feet, she was immovable.

*“Leo!”* I pleaded. *“Dominic—help—”*

Only Leo moved to help us. Dominic just stared, wide-eyed with fear. Leo’s hands hovered in hesitation for a few seconds before he grabbed Anika’s arm—or tried to, since it continued to sink and forced his fingers to keep finding higher ground to hold. “It’s…it’s like quicksand.”

The floor was eating her. No, *the house.* The house was eating her; this place was alive and sentient, responsive to threats and hostile to its inhabitants.

“Come on.” I grit my teeth and grabbed onto her right leg this time. “Please. *Please!”*

I pulled on her jeans, her shirt, her *hair,* but her body only dipped further and further into the wood below us. It was like watching someone sinking into water in slow motion: the floor swallowed the front of her body until it was just the curve of her head, the arch of her spine, the swell of her legs; within minutes, it took those too, until it was just the very top of her hair and the back of her shirt; then *those* disappeared into the termite-eaten hardwood, and I was left on my hands and knees staring down at nothing.

“Okay, maybe—maybe she wasn’t sinking into the floor. Maybe she phased through it.” Sam got up and ran to Dominic in the hallway. He shoved him forward. “Let’s check downstairs. Come *on.”*

Tears stung in my eyes even as the other two ran off. We would have heard it if she’d phased through and fell. There was no noise. Predictably, a few minutes later, Sam yelled out from downstairs: *“There’s nothing here, it’s just…”*

I slammed a fist down. My head seemed heavy, with exhaustion, with anger. I let it hang low, too tired to bother holding it up. Maybe if I pressed myself to the floorboards close enough, I’d be able to see where the house had taken Anika; maybe I’d be able to pull her out. A tension in between my brows grew, tight enough that it seemed my skull would split.

“What do you want?” I whispered to the floor, frustrated tears streaming down my face. *“What the fuck do you want?’*

Nothing responded. Of course not. This house only ever did anything when it was to torment us; it wasn’t in the business of giving us answers.

I sniffed and pushed myself back upright. In my outburst, Leo had retreated to the hallway and was cowering by the wall, his back to the room, palms over his ears. Like turning away from where Anika had disappeared would help. Sam and Dominic lingered by the door—they must have returned while I was on the ground.

Leo, Sam, Dominic…I should have had four housemates left.

“Wait.” I swayed to my feet. “Is Charles alright?”

Considering silence from Anika hadn’t boded well for her, we needed to take stock of everybody. And even if Charles had a mental breakdown earlier, he still should have come running when he heard me yell. He didn’t seem like the type to ignore someone when they were audibly distressed.

*“Shit.”* Sam bolted for the stairs. I followed closely, with Dominic on my heels a second later.

Sam reached Charles’ room first. He bust the door down with one swift kick that sent splinters scattering all over the hallway. “Charles—”

He froze.

I skid to a stop beside him, about to ask what was wrong—then I spotted it: a figure slumped in the corner of the empty room, head tilted up, neck bared, jaw hung open. Charles. His empty gaze stared up at the ceiling. His arms rested bonelessly at his sides. His legs splayed out in front of him. Dark water poured out of his mouth, soaked into his clothes, and spilled all over his lap. A puddle had formed around him and was steadily spreading to the rest of the room.

“Is he…” Sam trailed off—turned away and put a hand over his mouth.

I swallowed. “I think he is.”

I couldn’t see any visible injuries on Charles, but there was nothing behind his eyes. He was too unnaturally still. That was just a corpse now, spewing water out of its throat.

\-

There was nowhere to bury Charles, but Sam and I tried to give him some semblance of funeral rites anyway. We planned to properly clean him and wrap him in cloth—except, when we tried to move him, his corpse refused to be uprooted from the corner where it sat. His wet body and damp clothes seemed to have fused with the moldy wall behind it, and any attempt we made to rip him away only resulted in his skin and muscles tearing open—the wounds spewing out more water—before his flesh writhed, stretched, and reached to meld itself with the wall once more.

I tried to at least close his mouth to stop the water pouring out from it, but his jaw wouldn’t budge. It had a stiffness that wasn’t of rigor mortis; it was something else, something *heavier* that made my hands go numb and cold when I touched the corpse’s skin.

By the time I gave up, the first floor was flooded with an inch of black water. It was sure to keep rising, so Sam, Dominic, and I retreated upstairs. We found Leo still in the hallway outside Anika’s room, rocking back and forth and crying.

Dominic’s expression curdled into clear disdain when he saw him. The hatred in his eyes burned, cut through the fatigue weighing his demeanor down and sparking life back into his gait. My stomach flipped with anxiety—far too many times, I’d seen my father go from a lethargic drunk to a violent madman at the drop of a hat. And that little change in posture, that manic gleam in his stare always preceded his outbursts.

I hurried to Leo’s side and got him on his feet, before leading him to my room. I needed to get him out of Dominic’s sight right now, diffuse the situation before it could explode. We didn’t need a fight on top of everything that was already happening.

“It has to end at some point, right?” Leo sobbed as I ushered him to sit on the floor. “This can’t just be it forever. We can’t just be stuck here in this nightmare.”

I returned to my door and closed it softly. My father always hated it when I slammed doors while retreating from the man’s moods; I didn’t know if Dominic was the same way, but that was the only benchmark I had for this kind of ugly, deep-seated anger, the kind that seemed embedded into the foundation of violent people, and welled up from their guts at the slightest provocation. It was best to not stoke the fire. Best to be quiet. Best to hide.

“Things always change, time always passes, nothing’s supposed to last.” Leo babbled near-incoherently behind me. “Something has to give. I’m sick of this. *I’m so fucking sick of this.”*

I waited and pressed my ear to the door, more focused on Dominic’s anger. Outside, there were footsteps, then muffled conversation:

*“I think you scared him,”* Sam said.

Dominic scoffed. *“I didn’t do shit. What, you blaming me for making Leo cry now?”*

*“I didn’t say that.”* Sam’s voice slid to that deliberately calm soothing pitch of his. I imagined him speaking with his empty, don’t-hurt-me-smile, his hands out in placation, in surrender. *“But we’re all just dealing with a lot right now, so we’re understandably a little high-strung. And I don’t think getting angry is going—”*

*“When the hell was I angry? I didn’t do shit to you.”*

A pause. *“I didn’t say that, Dominic. But you have a history—”*

*“Stop talking like that! Stop talking with that voice, it’s so fucking condescending!”*

There was a smack, then a thud. Silence. I couldn’t place the sound of it, the weight of it; it could have been a million different things, a million different cruelties. Maybe Dominic slapped him across the face, maybe punched him in the arm. I just know there was a hit. I just know it made me tense, brace. The shape of pain never mattered when it hit you. It hurt all the same.

*“Dominic.”* Sam’s voice was even softer now. Gentler. *“Please don’t push me around.”*

*“You’re still talking like that!”* Another thud, louder this time, followed by the scuffle of shoes on the floor. *“You stupid son of a bitch, I told you to stop!”*

The next thud reverberated across the floor. This was getting too much. I had to step in, had to help somehow. I cracked the door open.

“Are you crazy?!” Leo latched onto my arm and yanked me back. The force of it spun me around to face him. “Dominic’s going to fucking kill you!”

In the corner of my eye, from the tiny sliver I could see the hallway through the barely-opened door, Dominic’s fist smashed into the underside of Sam’s jaw with a deafening *crack!* With how quiet the house was, it rang through the space like a gunshot. I flinched. Leo trembled.

“They’re going to kill you,” he hissed, his eyes going glassy and his nails digging into my skin. He started dragging me back—behind him, my already-dark room seemed to lose more light, seemed to stretch backwards and deepen. The shadows turned to tar, to that oppressive opaqueness that haunted my dreams. Leo stepped back into them, until his entire body was swallowed by that mass of darkness, and the only parts of him I could see were his hands still holding onto me, and the pinprick shine of his eyes.

The sickening thud and thump and crack of Dominic’s fist against Sam’s skull rang out behind me. In panic, I bucked back from Leo’s hold, but his grip only tightened.

“If you go out there, they’re going to tear you apart,” he said.

*“Dominic!”*

The shrill pitch of Sam’s voice had my attention snapping back to the hallway. Both men were on the floor, Sam sprawled on his back while Dominic loomed over him, one hand fisted in the downed man’s shirt while the other was raised high in preparation for another blow. Blood stained his bruised knuckles, and when he brought them down to crush Sam’s eye, more splattered all over his face.

“He’s going to kill Sam!” I wrenched Leo’s hands off me—more fingers lurched from the darkness and hooked into my shirt. There were so many of them: seven on a lump of flesh that should have been a palm, ten on a strip of bone and skin that might have been an arm; deformed amalgamations of human limbs clawing and dragging me toward the dark with inhuman strength.

I didn’t think that was Leo standing in front of me anymore, but it still shrieked with his voice. “Exactly! So, why would you go out there?!”

I bucked again, thrashed; the wild rhythm of my feet desperately scrabbling on the ground melded with the sound of Dominic’s fists pounding into Sam’s head. I pulled my knee up and *kicked* into the shadows—my foot crashed against something solid, flinging the creature back and loosening its hold on me. I collapsed with a thud, shoulder first; pain smarted against the joint, but I grit my teeth and bolted into the hallway.

“That’s *enough!”* I grabbed Dominic by the shoulders and wrenched him off Sam’s unmoving form.

Dominic hit the floor with a grunt; before I could kneel next to Sam and check on him, Dominic rose and swung a kick into the side of my head.

I crashed into the wall headfirst. My vision blackened. All sound ceased for a moment. When the world returned, I was on the floor, staring up at Dominic stomping Sam’s skull in.

*“You stupid son of a bitch!”* Dominic barked at the body below him. “I didn’t do shit to you!”

Brain matter squelched under his shoe. Bone fragments stuck to his heel. Dominic stomped and stomped and stomped, until his jeans were coated in the evidence of his rage, and Sam’s head was a puddle of viscera.

Then he just stood there, half-hunched, breathing hard, and stared at the body by his feet. After a minute or so, his teeth bared in a snarl, and he gave the corpse one last kick. Finally, he turned away and headed toward his room.

Halfway through, he froze.

I braced. Perhaps he’d remembered there was still another target in the hallway. Perhaps he still had more fury to spare. I struggled to bring my hands under me, tried to push myself up, but it had been a long couple of days, and I hadn’t eaten in over twenty hours. All of that was catching up to me now.

Dominic turned. I kept my eyes on him, because it hurt less when I saw it coming.

“Dad?”

Dominic wasn’t looking at me. Instead, he was staring at the direction of the stairs. I was too tired to check was what there, but whatever it was, it was making him shake and cower.

“I’m sorry,” he whimpered. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean it.”

He stumbled back, past his apartment door and deeper into the hallway. It was an aimless kind of retreat that I was familiar with, the kind I used to do when I was young and scared and just picked a direction and ran. I forced all my strength into one arm so I could prop myself up and turn to the stairs.

There was nothing there. But this house was alive, this house was angry, and this house made people see and hear different things.

“I didn’t mean to hurt him, Dad.” Dominic lifted his hands over his head, a shield against a strike I couldn’t see. Holes bloomed on the skin of his hands and arms, spread under his shirt, crawled up his face. They were pinpricks at first, but then they melted open, wider and wider, until they exposed the inner layers of his flesh. “I was just so angry.”

Strangely, it wasn’t muscle beneath his skin. His face melted away and revealed—himself again, but bloodier, and younger, with more fearful eyes and less frown lines near his brows. More holes bloomed on this Dominic’s skin, melting once more to reveal an even younger version.

He continued to back up into the dark hall, head bowed low, apologies spilling from his mouth, a trail of gore and sinew in his wake. His body peeled away until he was a teenager, until he was a boy, until he was tiny and small and couldn’t be older than five. Just a child, kneeling in the mess of his own exposed nerves and arteries.

“Dad…” The child stared up at something I couldn’t see, trembling, eyes shiny with tears. “Please don’t hurt me.”

The barrel of a rifle emerged from the shadows behind him, rising in an arc as two white hands pointed it at the back of his skull.

I lurched forward in alarm—in that moment, I didn’t think about how Dominic had just killed a man in front of me. All I saw was a little boy. But my legs wouldn’t work, and all I managed to do was uselessly pitch my torso forward a few inches. I threw my hand out in a desperate attempt to reach for the child. His terrified eyes snapped toward me.

The gun went off.
