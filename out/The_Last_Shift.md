Emma had always been the type to finish her work, even if it meant staying late. It was nearing 11:00 PM, and the office was eerily silent, save for the hum of the fluorescent lights. Everyone else had gone hours ago, leaving her alone on the 12th floor of the towering corporate building. The city lights outside twinkled, a stark contrast to the dim, almost suffocating stillness inside.

As she typed away, the rhythmic clatter of her keyboard filled the empty space. She paused to stretch her neck and glanced at the clock. "Just 30 more minutes," she muttered to herself, trying to shake off the unsettling feeling of being watched.

The feeling had been growing ever since the janitor had locked up earlier, wishing her a good night. At first, she chalked it up to her imagination. After all, late nights and silence could play tricks on anyone. But then she heard it—a faint click down the hall.

Emma froze, her fingers hovering over the keyboard. The sound was subtle, like the soft click of a door latch. She knew everyone had gone home, and she distinctly remembered hearing the janitor lock the main doors.

"Probably just the building settling," she told herself, though her heart was pounding.

She stood to investigate, armed only with her phone. The hallway was dimly lit, the motion-activated lights flickering on as she walked. The open-plan desks stretched out in rows, their computer screens dark and lifeless.

"Hello?" she called out, her voice cracking slightly. No response.

She was about to turn back when she saw it—an office chair spinning slowly at one of the desks. She stared, frozen in place. There was no draft, no movement to explain it. The chair spun lazily, as if someone had just pushed it.

"Okay, this is ridiculous," she whispered, more to convince herself than anything. She approached the desk cautiously, her shoes clicking against the polished floor.

As she reached out to stop the chair, her phone buzzed violently in her hand. She yelped, nearly dropping it. A message flashed on the screen.

"You shouldn't be here."

Her stomach dropped. The number was unknown. She spun around, scanning the empty office. The silence pressed down on her like a heavy blanket.

"Who's there?" she demanded, trying to sound braver than she felt.

A loud thud came from the break room. Emma’s pulse raced as she turned toward the sound. The glass door to the break room was ajar, and the light inside flickered weakly.

She crept toward it, her hands trembling. The room was empty. At least, that’s what she thought until she saw the coffee pot. It was shattered on the floor, the dark liquid seeping into the tiles.

Her phone buzzed again. Another message.

"Behind you."

Emma spun around, her scream catching in her throat. The hallway was empty. She stumbled back, clutching her phone. Her breath came in shallow gasps as she tried to process what was happening.

The lights in the office flickered violently, plunging the space into intermittent darkness. In the flashes of light, she saw it—an outline of a figure at the far end of the hall. Tall, unmoving, and watching.

Emma bolted. She didn’t care about her bag, her laptop, or the unfinished work. She sprinted for the elevator, slamming the button repeatedly. The doors opened painfully slow, and she threw herself inside, hitting the ground floor button.

As the elevator doors began to close, she saw the figure again. This time, it was closer, standing just outside the range of the flickering lights. Its head tilted unnaturally to the side, as if studying her.

The doors shut, and the elevator descended. Emma pressed herself against the wall, clutching her phone. She kept her eyes on the door, praying it wouldn’t stop before the lobby.

When the elevator finally dinged, she burst out into the empty lobby and ran straight for the exit. The night air hit her like a wave, and she didn’t stop running until she was several blocks away.

The next morning, Emma called in sick. She tried to convince herself it had been stress, a lack of sleep, or her imagination running wild.

But when she checked her phone, the messages were still there.

And so was a final one, sent at 3:00 AM.

"See you tonight."
