My kids were still asleep. My heart was beating fast I have never had a dream like that before. Honestly I was shocked that my mind could come up with something  like that. 

I looked at the time it was time to get up. I made breakfast, drove the kids to school then checked in with the cops. They sadly told that there hadn't been any updates. They had no leads to go on. They told be if they don't  get a lead in the first 48 hours. Someone doesn't want her to be found or she doesn't want to be found. They asked me again if I had noticed any weird behavior or her going out more often as of late. I hadn't everything had been as it also had until that night. One of the officers put her hand on my shoulder and said don't worry we'll find her. I  hoped that they she was going to be right. 

The rest of my day went by as normal. Again  the kids wanted to sleep in my bed with me. I thought to myself  if it continues I may need a kid size bed. They were too scared to sleep in their rooms alone. I read them a bed time story and they fell asleep one by one. I fell asleep not long after. 

I was back in the room with ten pools. This time  I was alone. I saw something on the floor by a  pink slide on the other side of the pool room. I  walked over to it slowly and carefully. I didn't  want that thing to come back again. As I got closer I  realized it was one of my wife's swimsuits. What the fuck was going on. I heard my wife call my name again. I turned and saw a new slide had appeared. It was yellow and not far. I walked over to it and yelled down it" honey are you okay, Are you there!" No answer. It was then I felt someone push me down the slide. As I was going down the slide I was rapidly gaining speed. I was going impossibly fast. I was in that slide for what felt like hours before it ended. 

I was now at what looked like my old high school. I looked down and saw that I was now naked. What a fucking Cliche. I walked to my old classroom to see if I could find anything there. I didn't find anything. it was just an empty classroom. It was then I heard a deep growl. I looked  out of the door. I saw the woman again she was standing at the end of the hall. Then that monster grabbed with its long smooth black tentacles. I  watch it tail her apart like someone that was tairring a piece of paper and want to see how many pieces their could rip it up to. After her blood and Guts were everywhere. I didn't know what to do I froze as it ran at me. Before I me I fell everything again warping around me into melting faces that were screaming for help. The would just get louder and louder. After what felt like forever I saw the end It was an other pool room. 

Before I hit the ground I stopped mid air. Then heard my wife called for me again. A tentacle Pierced through me I began to see multiple versions of my wife melting away. I started to fade my hearts could bare to see my wife go through that. I woke up screaming.
