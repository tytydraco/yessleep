  *Don't we all love a nice meal to lift our spirits after a long day at work? Food that makes you forget about your boss who yelled at you for no reason. We have that and much more.* 

This message is your only indicator that you are about to enter our restaurant. It is the only thing that stays the same. You are more likely to read it in your language or English. 

We are pretty good with shapeshifting and usually blend with the aesthetics of the area we teleport to. I am not good at shapeshifting, as I am a human, but my boss does it for me. 

As a waitress, the shifting is crucial as customers see me. Sometimes I am a man, others a woman. On days I misbehave, they can turn me into an animal and make the cook chase me for the whole shift, with three minutes break. 

Have you ever run and hide for 12 hours? Yeah, it is no fun. Unless you want to be the next meal, you survive. 

**Why do I work there?**

Three things: money, traveling, and helping people. In addition to that, nobody is rude to me unless I do something stupid. They mostly ignore me and let me do my job. 

  Here is the list of rules I came up with that should keep you safe. Keep in mind that these rules are based on my observations. 

**Rule #1: Do not take a pamphlet if you are offered one.** 

Politely decline, and no matter how much they persist, keep doing so while trying to walk away. Do not explain yourself, and under no circumstances you are to be rude. You may think you are edgy and cool, but unless you want to be the next steak glazed with honey, keep the sass to yourself. 

**Rule #2: Do not let anybody drag you into the restaurant.** 

Sometimes the owner gives a sob story about the lack of customers or some sh\*t. **Again:** do not explain yourself, politely decline and walk away. And do not let him corner you, or you will have to go inside or fistfight a supernatural being for your way out. 

When you walk away, (very important) turn off your phone for four hours and do not go to your original destination. Go somewhere else for a little while. Otherwise, they will follow and harass you. At first, they will stalk you, and then you will get the pleasure of experiencing a full-blown haunting that I cannot tell you how to get rid of. 

We have a table-cleaning lady we call Wicked Nancy. She has mental issues due to being haunted. I do not know why or how she got hired. Maybe the owner took pity on her. 

But Nancy is one of the victims. She cussed the owner, got haunted, and now her brain is as good as a stale breadstick. Nancy escaped two asylums before joining our family. We call her wicked because if you are in a storage room with her, she will stab you. The owner replaced my liver twice because of her. 

Thank god for supernatural powers, am I right?

**Rule #3: If you do not have money, do not eat here. Thus being said, no dine-and-dash folks either.** 

In case you enter the place somehow, mention your lack of finances and do not sit down unless you get the credit card number of the owner. You must show you are ready to pay him back. After you leave, transfer the money you owe with a 35% gratuity tip for the whole restaurant. The boss usually gives the money back. 

If he happens to invite you again, send the money back. Do this until he accepts defeat. 

**Rule #4: Do not speak in the restaurant/ be mindful of your words.**

A client once said that their meal was to die for. Can you guess where they are now?

I am so sick and tired of watching the waiter lick his lips every time someone says something like that. He loves paying short visits to customers and making them mean their words. 

One time a lady swore that she could drink the whole liquor bar, and the next day, she was found wide open, guts everywhere, and her blood was no longer blood but alcohol and fresh orange juice. 

**Rule #5: Do not complain about the food, drinks, etc.** 

You love everything, and this is your new maxima. Our meals and beverages reflect your personality, emotions, etc. You will finish what is on the table, even if it makes you gag. No matter how it looks and tastes, I guarantee you - it is completely safe and edible. 

**Rule #6: Pay in cash or use a burner card. Never your own.** 

Do you want to be stalked? No. Then follow this rule. As little about you they know, the better. Yes, the owner can google you, but he never goes this far unless you piss him off. 

**Rule #7: If you f\*ck up, pay the tip jar on your way out.** 

This rarely works, but when it does, you will know. If you leave the restaurant feeling heavy, I am so sorry for you. But if you feel light and happy - you are finally off the radar. Congratulations! Don't come to dine with us again.

**Rule #8: I can't believe I am saying this - Do not be rude.** 

Be nice and polite. Even if you are rude, the staff will be surprisingly accommodating to your needs. Later, when you get home, you will be accommodating to our needs. 

**Rule #9: I don't care what you do - Do not mention this post. You have no idea what I've been through to keep this hidden. Do not ruin this for me.**

Be a bro, please. Nobody needs to know what you have heard about this place. It will only do me worse and then you will disappear. The owner will not leave an alive customer who knows what happens in his establishment. Make both of our lives better and keep quiet. Alright?

And here you have it - a full guide on how to survive your dining experience at our restaurant. I am sorry if you have the misfortune to stumble upon us, but if you do, at least you will be prepared.
