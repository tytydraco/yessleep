I stared down at my pale, exsanguinated corpse; at its deflated, fractured skull. She’d left it on a slab of white rock, in the rubble-strewn belly of a quarry. As a threat? A promise? *Flirtation?* I picked through the pockets, scavenging what I could. I was so hungry; I hadn’t eaten in days. There hadn’t been anything on the last body, though I didn’t spend much time looking at t*hat one,* given the abominable state of it. Washed ashore on that absurd, nightmarish beach with its inexplicably vibrating sand, the corpse had been bloated and ugly, the mottled flesh teeming with ravenous aquatic parasites. How could I have spent more than a few moments in its unwholesome presence?  

Using a shovel I’d found in a derelict shack atop the quarry’s ridge, I dug a shallow grave and pitched the bloodless corpse inside. I didn’t want the thing being consumed by whatever carrion vermin subsisted in the dusty biome, at least not while I still roamed about the area. I was sure that sounds of tearing flesh and blood slurping would reach me, no matter how far I traveled.  

Once I had completed my sepulchral duty, I set out again, following her lingering scent: ever consistent, neither mounting nor diminishing; the artificially sweet yet also earthy tones an alluring reminder of her somewhat libertine hygiene. She bathed, but with no formal regularity. 

 She wouldn’t have gone too far ahead, wouldn’t have utterly abandoned me in this harsh domain of her design – *this willfully induced folie à deux.* Conjured by her perverse sense of playfulness and cognomancy, she’d imprisoned me in a metaphysical mind-realm, a new level to what had been an ever-increasing yet initially harmless progression of sexual experimentation. Now, physically exhausted and mentally strained from having come across corpse after corpse, all bearing my image, I wanted only to find her and end the horror; even if it meant prematurely ending—or at least sterilizing—our intimacy. The date had gone on long enough.  

I followed a winding path through low yet indescribably menacing vegetation; bushes and hedges which somehow intimated an aura of malignance; as if evil—or thoughts of such a nature—porously emanated from the flora itself. The sun—if you could call the pathetic sallow sphere hanging in the sky such a thing—barely managed to penetrate the dim umbrage of the shoulder-high shrubbery; a wan gloam, auguring not just night, but something more ominous.  

Eventually, I reached the next corpse: singularly crucified in a vast, moonlit desert. Despite the chill—which had arisen without my conscious notice, yet nonetheless felt at once intolerable—the corpse appeared to glow with a soft warmness. Drawing closer, I felt an actual emission of heat from its starkly naked form. 

 Tentatively, more so out of a desire to warm myself than any want for contact, I touched the bare chest. The whole corpse then burst into flames, and I recoiled in horror at seeing the once closed eyes flash open in sightless reanimation. The jaw went slack, unhinging down to the chest, and a roar of unrelatable agony erupted from revenant’s throat. Then the corpse started to thrash about, spasmodically yet uselessly; the detaining nails solidly affixed to the perdurable wood. There was a darkly savory aroma of cooking meat, and I was reminded of the pork chops I'd had a few days prior.  

I waited for it to end, sickened beyond thought. But the dead body heaved and struggled tirelessly, and the flames burned on as if the flesh were the perfect kindling; ever-replenishing or simply inexhaustible. Finally, after hours of this grisly animacy, my shock subsided, and the horror of the moment transformed into a more manageable disgust. Bracing myself against the desert’s dauting vastness and paradoxical cold, I continued my journey.  

I found her in the middle of a murder. As I summited a dune, I came to find her standing over a simulacrum of me, which she’d made to kneel before her. She held a black trident overhead, poised to impale my doppelganger through his chest. My trek through the desert had ruined me, had diminished my spirit to something less than a man, and any sense of identical kinship that might’ve compelled me to come to his aid was utterly absent. The trident shone brilliantly, though my eyes couldn’t tell if the light was lunar or solar in origin.  

Nonplussed, I watched her drive the weapon—shaped out of some obsidian-like stone—into his body. The *crunch* of it sounded too normal, like something you’d hear during dinner. There was no auditory gravity to the penetration of the chest by that triply bladed tool. I felt nothing beyond what one might feel upon seeing one’s place of work at the start of yet another dismally monotonous day. The dread was there, but it had long ago become digestible, suppressible, nearly inert.  

She wrenched the trident free, letting the body roll away from her like a shoe she’d kicked off. It came to a stop facing me, and for a moment of exhaustion-induced disassociation, I thought that I was the one who’d been stabbed; and that it was finally time for me to rest. But her voice recalled me from that freedom-promising delirium, and I flicked my eyes up to meet hers.  

“You’ve lasted so long, are you ready to finish?”  

I’d been ready to finish ages ago, cycles past. Weakly, barely possessing the energy to perform the gesture, I nodded my head. The whole environment—hazily, erratically sunlit, like a madman’s deranged rendition of a summer prairie—seemed to tremble with the motions, and I stumbled a bit, even though I hadn’t moved my feet. She smiled and clapped her hands together. A breeze blew through the field, briefly lifting her sable hair and giving a greater view of her pale, lightly freckled cheeks. I saw streaks of dried tears on them and wondered if they’d been for any of the corpses, or at the idea that I’d never reach her.  

I didn’t notice that I’d been teetering until I fell; she rushed to catch me just before I hit the ground. Cradled in her arms, I knew that I was safe, that my voyage through those twisted, cataclysm-wrecked realms was over. Here, in the peaceful yet nonetheless uncanny field, I would finally be allowed to finish; would finally experience what I'd been promised since first speaking with her. Carefully, still holding me with one powerful arm, she undid and discarded her bra, and I was allowed to nurse.  

There was a faint bubbling sound, which my mind knew to be the sudden and impossibly rapid decomposition of the impaled corpse, but my thoughts—if thoughts they could be even called—were totally focused on other matters. The wind threw out another breeze, helpfully carrying away any olfactory evidence of the corpse’s putrefaction. I inhaled, nasally, basking in the fragrant musk of her body; and as if on cue, I felt her hand probe downward, to do away with my tension and stress. 

Afterwards, we sat together on the field and watched the world unmake itself. Great pluming geysers of flame burst through the earth, sending cyclonic conflagrations across the land, incinerating plants, animals, and man-made structures indiscriminately. Dragons, or her headless, weirdly amphibian interpretations of such, were struck by golden lightning streaks mid-flight and plunged lifelessly landward, cratering the earth with their titanic bulks. Anthropophagic beast-men, gleaning some bestial sense of their imminent demise, turned on each other; devouring friend, foe, and family alike.  

It was all so absurdly chaotic and fantastical that I barely even cared. We rested in each other’s arms, limbs entangled, bodies pulsing to a single heart’s rhythm, though I couldn’t have said whose. When the sun sent a solar flare coursing through the region— perhaps refusing to be outdone in exhibitions of world-ending destruction – I was already “gone”, mentally. I had already joined her in a far-flung telepathic abysm wherein naught but our love existed. Our bodies, summarily abandoned, burned along with the Earth; drifted amidst the ashen rubble in sidereal space, innominate as ever.  

Begrudgingly, I opened my eyes to the ceiling, whereon were plastered various anime and bodybuilding posters. Hello Kitty paraphernalia – some of it distinctly new -- stared at me from atop crowded shelves. The bed shuffled, and she hopped out before I could turn to her. My eyes tracked her litheness as she rounded the bed, heading into the bathroom. I felt weak, depleted, and had I not promised to meet with friends after, I probably would’ve fallen asleep. My body still somehow ached from the weeks-long exertion through the dreamscape, the eldritch experience neither entirely imaginary nor fully real, but having happened in some indefinable state betwixt the two potentialities. Flesh and spirit couldn't tell the difference. 

She returned from the bathroom with a bottle of ointment. For a terror-flushed second, I suspected “the worst”, in a mundane sense. That she’d been harboring *something* and hadn’t told me. But then I remembered the multi-triangular sigil she’d branded on my chest with her witch-magick at the beginning of our date. 

Placidly, I let her apply the burn ointment. Her fingers traced the inflammation tenderly, flicking away black specks where the flesh had been charred by the sorcerous branding. As she soothed my flesh, she murmured incantatory lyrics in some time-forgotten and profane-sounding language. My mind swooned, lulled almost to mental dormancy by the outré hymnal verses. 

Once fully applied, she withdrew a bandage from her nightstand—I was too tired to wonder at its peculiar presence there—and gently patched up her work. I was hers, now. Had been claimed as her lover – and more.  

She drove me back to my home—I was basically catatonic—where my friends were waiting to meet me. Seeing me in such a physically sapped state, they crowded around me and cast resentful glances toward her, but I waved away their burgeoning animosity. She’d done me no wrong, no matter what harm had come to my flesh.  

She left me in their care, promising to again summon me to her home sometime soon. She’d been a demoness, at some point in the early periods of antemundane Time; had dwelt among Haden flame-forms and feral incubi in the sweltering furnace of some proto-Hell. Millennia after that, a swamp-sired witch, who’d brewed and concocted blasphemous victuals for dumb or merely short-sighted peasant folk. Now, she’s a Goth Mommy, Wheyfu, and Hello Kitty Girl, all rolled into one ridiculous—or, ridiculously hot—amalgam.  

She terrifies me, but I love her.
