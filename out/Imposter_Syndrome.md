Another night decaying by my computer as I frantically scribbled a design here and slapped together a story there; people liked what I created so I’d consider myself happy. It’s less daunting when I build up a strong momentum and can ignore my intrusive thoughts.  A familiar bloop kidnapped my attention and redirected it to my messages. I could afford to break my momentum to communicate with the outside world, at least once a day. I changed windows to see a mention notification on my display when my heartbeat crawls into my throat and time begins to stop.

 The disheveled desk littered with soda cans, crumpled paper, and LED screens was immediately ripped from my view and replaced with a blinding and dreadful fog. Like releasing a possessed smoke grenade, I gagged and sputtered as my vision failed, mouth dried with a putrid odor,  and my ears assaulted with anxious screams and agonized wails. It felt like an eternity, the billowing smoke and gasping for air feeling every inhale deprive me of more oxygen. As instant as it started was how sudden the process ended and left me stranded in what I hastily judged Hell. 

There wasn’t a sky when I looked up, not an endless horizon. Instead, it looked as if I was in the middle of a hurricane. The storm clouds billowed and swirled into each other. Unlike a normal storm, there wasn’t anything behind the pulsing clouds, just more mess. The frigid wind caused shivers down my back while pushing the black smoke to terrifying speeds. I couldn’t mentally ground myself to subside my panic, because every single sense betrayed me.

The ground I was trembling on was composed of cremated ash and incandescent embers from charred books and dilapidated bookshelves. The soft lack of foundation seeped to my knees only to feel the singe of fiery pages wrapped delicately on me, branding me with ink and charcoal runes. Behind me was instead a colorless, black abyss that I labeled ‘water’, but I couldn’t imagine what horrors stirred under the surface. I could feel from the pounding in the earth that something titanic is aware of my presence, guess the inky depths are safer. The ash stirred with each rhythmic stomp, yet no signs of which direction to be most afraid of. The stomping grew quicker in tempo and I made the decision to let my mind plague me with the unknown instead of getting answers and dying after. 

I grabbed everything I could on my way towards the coast; slowing down only to stoop and pick up supplies. I sprinted to a fractured and still burning shelf and constructed a raft, with fistfulls of burning and stained paper acting as a paste holding everything together. The burns were intense but unsuccessful in slowing me down. Wincing, I fashioned layers of the thin pages around my arms as makeshift bandages to cauterize my wounds while preventing more splinters piercing my hands as I broke apart a board to make an oar.     

I pushed my hastily crafted raft towards the dark and undulating water. The hopeful buoyant mass of varnished wood and disintegrating paper wobbled inconsistently the further I pushed. Nonetheless, I had no choice but to thrust my entirety when the water reached my neck. The black liquid clung to my skin as it ran down me like mascara escaping through tears; leaving me feeling not necessarily wet but weighed down regardless, leaving me to think this is more ink than water. In disbelief, I fixated upon a small patch of land shrinking into a nonexistent spec on the horizon; I managed to escape, but clueless as to what could possibly lie ahead. 

As I struggled to paddle, I couldn’t help but notice something too strange to be coincidental; the water mimicked my breathing. My rowing began steady and focused, to my surprise the water likewise swayed in a meticulous manner. Then, my arms grew heavy while my panic took flight, the waters would begin to grow restless while mercilessly sloshing and churning within itself. More ominous is a deep, almost rhythmic, pounding somewhere deep in the unfathomable depths lost in the dizzying mire below. I was too out of breath to match whatever beast was left on the shore, this felt like it emanated from all sides and distances.

My anxious thoughts ripped and whizzed past me like vicious gales slicing through the swirling fog. The less control I had over my thoughts, the heavier the air would become as the wind began to sound like the desperate wails of the trapped souls. The fierce wind veils the whispers, whispers of doubt and self-sabotage made each stroke of the oar tax my energy harder and harder still. I couldn’t decipher whether the whispers are born of my own terror, or if they were the trapped declarations of the withered souls that failed before me. 

My eyelids clung to each other as I continued to paddle as hard as my upper body would allow. My heart frantically raced, supplying ample blood to my shivering and aching body as I desperately continued the same monotonous pushing through a limitless abyss and praying for an edge. 

I couldn’t fathom how I ended up here, even less why. As surreal as this may be it all felt familiar, as though this wretched damnation is nothing more than a thin, translucent veil away from the reality I’m accustomed to. My mind and body subconsciously agreed to trudge further towards an imaginary destination, almost as if it were instinctual or from a repressed memory. Despite the bedlam erupting all around, I discovered brief glimmers of a faint emerald light dividing the endless smoke, however I could only steal miniscule glimpses when I opened my eyes after taking deep though shaky breaths.

Newly invigorated, I continued to splash helplessly in the direction I believed the light to be. The helpless splashing stirred the stagnant water, causing attention to my vulnerability once again. The ink, while motionless, began to almost hum. I noticed thin spires rising slowly from the ink slowly after the humming started. The water within the ring of spires began to ripple and bubble while the spires continued to rise. A brief moment flashed before I realised they weren’t spires but teeth and I needed to escape whatever maws I found myself in. I dove into the inky water and kicked behind my raft. A tectonic shift forced torrents of ink to launch me and my raft airborne. I heard a deafening roar, but couldn’t clean my face fast enough to identify the leviathan. I thudded in the water with a greater force pushing down deeper; my raft landed on top of me. I fought with tooth and nail to reboard, still unsafe but relieved. The pillar shone in my vision as I layed on my back lifelessly, that has to be safety. 

Closer and closer the pillar crept while I struggled to power through, with my muscular structure falling apart at the biological seams. My biceps resembled decommissioned, frayed Naval ropes and still I move forward, only now dueted with wails of agony. The fog in my brain congealed into a thick mud, leaving me feeling utterly hopeless and inferior, to the point of almost successfully slowing my momentum. The louder I screamed the more ferocious and insidious the echoes would roar back, repeating my inner doubts for the vast ocean to hear. Surreptitiously, my will was being ruthlessly smothered into an inky abyss but before I could submit and relinquish all power, mercilessly my raft crashes into shallow land. The beacon of light was just a sprint away.

My bare feet recoiled sharply by the jagged and splintered bones comprising the dry land and replacing the ash. The splinters sunk into my feet with each step through my already burned flesh as I forced myself up the shore and into a claustrophobic thicket of thorny brambles and insect ridden logs. My toes curled into the sharp ground as I cringed at the fear of what could lurk in the thicket, still I knew the base of the pillar lay within. The sound of crunching and squishing beneath my bloodied feet accompanied by the symphony of grunts, tears, and wet smacks from the splintered brambles stretching beyond my eyes.

Exhaustion crept its way through my open wounds and petrified my legs. My bloody chest heaved trying to desperately inhale through punctured lungs. The longer I stood still the worse the environment around me twisted while signs and sounds of movement flooded the area now marking me as prey. The calcified pillars, the final remnants of victims in this abyss would fall apart as mutated insects and other stinger and fang wielding terrors closed the distance. The shadows swayed confirming my suspicion of whetting something’s appetite; still I remained motionless. 

The new threat scuttled to me at eye-length from a decayed branch. A deformed or mutated arachnid chimera; Wasp, spider, and panic combined. Rearing tailless whip scorpion jaws, wolf spider fangs, and hornet stinger equipped, its pincers locked into my torn muscle fibers through my left bicep sinking its fangs into my corroded arteries. The beast’s tail tore into my wrist and lodged itself into one of the surface veins. I felt the horrific agony of the piercing, yet there wasn’t any temperature change that comes with venom; until something snapped. Each negative thought, each doubt began to take physical weight and heightened the impossibility of moving forward. The parasite was accelerating my anxiety while breaking my pursuit.

The foreign substance being injected acted as blood while insidiously corroding my veins and body until deteriorating to nothing but bone. My gaunt hand clawed into my emaciated arm as a desperate attempt to free myself now forcing the spider to burrow deeper and leave a tunnel through my forearm, rushing towards my heart. I grabbed the spindly branch it perched on before and punctured my armpit. The pain was excruciating but somehow the grotesque sounds of crunching and squishing were worse. The husk faded to dust by the time it hit the ground. The lethargy never subsided now that I was losing blood at an even quicker pace. I regained control of my legs and forced on.      

 The idea to stop and give up, not having to endure the inevitable pain of seeing the absence of a solution, the burning intensity of pincers, fangs, stingers, and more doing things to my body and soul I never considered, was the most tempting offer my mind could create in this scenario. Succumbing to my fate felt just the smallest bit comfortable then the unknown that came with pursuing forward. Shaking my head violently, I pushed on and suffered more, still I ran enduring considerably more agony, blood loss, and hope.

I tilted my heavy head upward and wiped my sweaty, blood-soaked hair out of my eyes; the pillar of light and its base of origin were just within my reach! Fragments on the floor sunk deeper into the soles of my feet, scraping bone. The pillar of green light, what was so recently a beacon of hope, became an ominous threat. I contemplated all the scenarios where my situation could possibly get worse; and messing with an energy emanating pillar seemed like a solid way to lead to it. My immediate familiar torture became slightly more comfortable than the unknown all over again. 

I continued slowly step by step until a polished ivory tower stood up to my chest with a glass-looking dome,  guarding a concentrated area of the same angry fog above me. The black, inky clouds swirled furiously within the dome and beckoned me to interact with it. I stared, mesmerized, and noticed there wasn’t a dome, just electricity firing wildly from the smoke made it look that way. Impulsively, I sunk my hand into the foggy storm and almost instantly the winds above me followed suit. My hand began to instantly feel numb the longer it was in until the same sensation crawled up to my elbow. I panicked and flung my arm; a rift appeared in the sky where my hand had cut. A second plunge followed by stirring my hand in circles caused an imposing oculus to rip above me.

The newly formed portal revealed a blurry sight that felt familiar, I rotated my hand in the fog and the image sharpened. It was a perception of the reality I inhabited before the fog and nightmare started. I recognized the familiar sights of my bedroom, faintly heard my computer hum and cats purr. Last thing I could remember was accurately displayed; my monitors, the papers, and the cans. The harder I tried to understand, the worse my mind spiraled. I gazed at my own point of view, and yet I’m consciously trapped here. I could feel everything I suffered, the rowing, bacteria filled splinters, nightmarish insects. No words could escape my torn throat, just primal shouting as my mind gave up.

That portal was me, the real me, but I was still here. Something was in control; taking my spot in life, building relationships to unreasonable amounts that I could never fulfill; writing stories I could never conceive for the public to demand better work when I couldn’t aspire to the original. My life was being lived for me in bold ways I never imagined. I didn’t know what was a more horrific fate; I return back to the driver’s seat and live as the destined disappointment to all around me, or I stay shackled to this damnation and live what could be an enjoyable and satisfying life knowing I will never be truly responsible for any achievement or meaningful progress. Can one truly be happy and fulfilled when separated from themselves? Would the brief splash of glory mixed with the bitter sewage of defeat from reality be a concoction you could survive?

I reeled my hand away from under the billows and the circular rift in the sky was swallowed whole. In all the panic I faulted to a catatonic numbness; something that would’ve been a miracle not too long ago. Numb to the pain I suffered toward what I hoped was salvation, numb to the injuries and horrors I’ve endured, and worst of all numb to the enclosing darkness. I succumbed to crushing defeat as I tumbled to the ground. I shrunk inward, begging for change, anything to push me from this very spot. I closed my eyes tightly to fight back the muddy tears welling up only for my eyes to open and I’m back in my computer chair without a second passing by, staring at the new message with the timestamp reading, ‘Just Now’.

“Looks really solid! I’m excited to see what you come up with next!” a message sent by a loved friend of mine who just got done seeing the new design I was working on and published. A message of unwavering support and optimism left their heart and became a frightening promise I couldn’t fulfill once read.

I went back to my keyboard and sketchpad to continue my diligent work, trying hard to stay focused, desperate for momentum so I could move on and finish my work.

When you put your creation out there; what’s the worse outcome? Honest and blunt silence or deafening and entitled applause?
