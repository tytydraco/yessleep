I always hated being home alone. I’m far too anxious; I imagine that every little noise I hear is someone breaking into my house, or a ghost, or a demon. I just spiral until I’m panicking and shaking. Because of this, I lived with my parents until I was about thirty. I have a good job coding, with good pay and everything. I could afford to move out for a while, but my parents are homebodies and never left me alone for very long. It can’t help that their overprotection certainly contributed to my fear of the unknown, and the fear of being robbed or attacked by some stranger. 

Well, when I turned thirty I decided I couldn’t live with my parents anymore if I had any hope of being married at some point. I opted to move in with three other roommates: Stacy, Shelley, and Sage; no, they’re not sisters, it’s just an odd coincidence. I hoped that they’d make me feel less alone. They were all still in college, and I think they judged me for being so old and living in the college apartments. 

I think the only thing we actually had in common was that we all hated the old landlord who lived in the downstairs apartment and refused to hire anyone to fix anything in our apartment, opting to do it himself instead. He’d always take forever and end up doing a total hack job. 

When it got too quiet in the house I would flinch at any sound I’d hear. When I got too paranoid about the noises, I would knock on the door of whichever of them were home, and ask if they could hear it, and investigate it with me and a weapon. Stacy and Sage, to their credit, were pretty understanding at first, but after the fifth or sixth time that month, I could tell they were sick of me, so they refused to help me. Anytime I would ask Shelley, a meek and sweet girl, to check out the noises, she would grab the aluminum baseball bat out from under her bed and follow after me, not saying a word. She had a bit of an annoyed look on her face, but she never denied me. 

After about six months, I used up the little credibility that I once had, even with Shelley. She didn’t confront me, she just stopped answering the door. There were times where I’d be hyperventilating and shaking, begging outside her door. I felt bad bothering her. My roommates told me I was being irrational, but it didn’t make my fear feel any less real. Some nights I would end up crying myself to sleep in the hallway, and I’d wake up feeling awful. 

That’s before the noises became more intense. 

...

I heard someone breathing right behind me. 

I was working from home on my laptop, sitting on my bed with my back against the wall. My heart was racing and I bit onto my hand so I wouldn’t scream. I slowly put my ear against the wall and listened. There I heard breathing that was labored, and mucousy. My whole body shivered with terror and I felt goosebumps crawl down my arms and legs. I climbed out of my bed and inched quietly down the hallway. 

Thankfully, my roommates were sitting in the kitchen having dinner, so they couldn't pretend I wasn’t there. Their faces turned sour when I entered the room, and they fell silent, staring at me. 

“What is it this time?” Stacy said flatly.

I shushed her and whispered, “I know that you think I’m crazy now, but this time I know I heard something.”

Sage sighed at me, “Erica, I’m going to be honest. We were talking about you and this problem you keep having. We don’t know how much more of this we can take. You’re keeping us up at night and we have to go to classes in the mornings. You’re really killing the vibe around here” 

I grabbed Shelley’s hand, and pulled her towards the hallway. “Come on, I’ll show you what I’m talking about. I swear it’s real,” I pleaded to her. 

Stacy slapped my hand away from Shelley. “No!” she ordered. “We’re not feeding into your delusions anymore. Either you get help, or just like- move out already! Sorry if that’s harsh, but you're making us miserable.” 

I looked at Shelley, and she just looked at the ground. 

...

I knew they couldn’t be convinced, and that’s when I determined I had to prove to them that it wasn’t all in my head. I scurried back down the hall towards my room. I slowly turned the doorknob and hoped the door wouldn’t creak. The hinges whined louder than ever before, just my luck.

I heard something bang on the wall inside. I gasped and stood in the doorway, frozen. I heard something sliding behind the drywall. It scraped across the length of my room and then stopped. I felt around the floral wallpaper with my hands and came across a rough spot. I moved my hand off of it and looked closer. There was a hole there, perfectly round. It was about 3 millimeters across. Right in the middle of one of the flowers. I don’t know how I never noticed it before. I gulped nervously as I brought my eye closer to the opening to peer through. 

I met another eye staring back at me. I fell backwards, away from the wall, and let out a scream. I crawled backwards on my hands, then clambered back down the hallway. 

I shouted at them, “there’s someone behind the wall! I’m calling the police if you still don’t believe me! Actually, I’m calling the police, period”! 

...

My heart pounded the entire time the police searched. The officer finally got back to me as I was rocking back and forth on the kitchen floor. 

“No forced entry, no secret entrances, no holes. No entry period. We’ve searched the place up and down about a billion times now. Those girls say you keep making this crap up. You pull this again, and you’ll be written up for wasting police time.” He practically yelled, “Maybe you should get a therapist while you’re at it, lady!” He walked across the front yard back to his patrol car. 

My roommates had all fled the house. Shelley texted me that they decided to stay in a hotel for the night, unable to deal with my ‘craziness’. I was so sick off of adrenaline that I didn’t even care. Anyway, it’s not like they were any help to me. I knew what I had to do. I drove to a hardware store just down the street, and bought an ax. I was going to find what was inside, security deposit be damned. 

...

I flung open the front door and flew down the hallway, ax in hand, fury boiling in my blood. I threw my dresser down onto the floor and hacked at my bedroom wall. As I swung the ax, tears streaming down my face, I thought about all the times no one believed me. My face was hot with wrath and my arms went numb, repeating the same motion.  After a while I was gasping for breath, and set the ax down at my side. The drywall was gone. I began sifting through the rubble. There were blurry pictures of me, taken on a polaroid camera. I searched more, and felt something soft. 

There were socks, used cotton swabs, tooth floss, napkins. These were things I had thrown out. A chill spread through me and my arm hairs stood on end. I was no longer able to stop myself as I entered the space between the walls. My rage consumed my fear and pushed me onward. Gripping the ax close to my body, and inching through. I could only move forward about an inch at a time, after what felt like hours. There were nails sticking through the drywall and they scraped my arms as I moved past.

Finally, I reached an opening. Something light bumped against my forehead. I reached up and grabbed onto it: a string. I pulled down and a light bulb sparked on. Looking downwards, I saw a roughly-cut square of wood that wasn’t flush with the rest of the floor. I grabbed at it, leaving a splinter deep in my hand, but pulling it up and out of its hole. Below it was a ladder, which descended into the downstairs apartment. 

A smile beamed across my face. That bastard landlord will get what’s coming to him.
