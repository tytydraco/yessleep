Dispatcher: Help is on the way, please can you put your hand in front of her nose?  
  
(Pause)  
  
Dispatcher: Do you feel any air?  
  
Caller: No! She's starting to wobble, she can't stand.  
  
Dispatcher: Try and encourage her to lie down.  
  
Caller: (voice break) Come baby, there. There. Shh, like that.  
  
Dispatcher: Does her neck appear to be swollen? Or anywhere on her face that looks puffy or discolored?  
  
Caller: No but I can see it in her throat.  
  
(Pause)  
  
Caller: It's a ball, or a marble. Please, please.  
  
Dispatcher: Try and keep calm, they should arrive any second. What breed is she?  
  
Caller: She's a border collie.  
  
Dispatcher: What's her name?  
  
Caller: (Voice break) Lottie.  
  
Dispatcher: Don't leave Lottie alone, okay? And stay on the line. It should be less than five minutes now.  
  
Caller: I just heard her going insane from upstairs, she woke me.  
  
Dispatcher: Keep calm, okay?  
  
Caller: Yes... Oh, oh, wait I think she might be managing to get it out!  
  
(Pause)  
  
Caller: Shh, shh, come on girl! Push!  
  
(coughing and spluttering heard)  
  
Dispatcher: Hello?  
  
Caller: It's out! God, God, okay. Ahhhhh, thank fuck.  
  
Dispatcher: Is Lottie breathing?  
  
(Licking heard)  
  
Caller: Yes! She's wagging her tail, but a bit shaken up.  
  
(Pause)  
  
Caller: Jesus Christ.  
  
Dispatcher: I need to know if Lottie still requires the vet ma'am.  
  
Caller: What on earth is that?  
  
(Pause)  
  
Caller: ... It's moving.  
  
Dispatcher: What's moving? Lottie?  
  
Caller: Whatever she coughed up, it's moving... What the fuck? What the fuck is that?  
  
(Pause)  
  
Caller: Is it a fucking squirrel?  
  
Dispatcher: Okay, calm down, can you explain what's happening with Lottie?  
  
Caller: She's fine but... Whatever she got out is moving, it's on the floor, Jesus Christ. It’s brown, and it won’t stop moving.  
  
Dispatcher: What was in her throat?  
  
Caller: It looks like ... a squirrel- without a tail. No, it looks white.  
  
(Pause)  
  
Dispatcher: Do you still require the vet? Is the dog breathing now?  
  
Caller: Ah, no, Lottie, no, drop it. Fuck, she’s trying to get it back in her mouth! Lottie leave it alone!  
  
(Lapping sounds.)  
  
Caller: … It's a puppy! I can see its little face! And ears.  
  
(Pause)  
  
Caller: It's all wet, but it's a puppy, it's a puppy and- Shh, shh. Girl?  
  
(Dog whimpering, retching)  
  
Dispatcher: Is Lottie okay?  
  
Caller: No, no? I think she's scared, no she's sick. Her stomach must still hurt, or- God, oh God no.  
  
Dispatcher: Do you still require the vet? Or should I cancel your request?  
  
Caller: Yes I require the vet because there's a fucking puppy on my kitchen floor! Lottie, shh, shh. Come on, sit. Do you need to lie down again?  
  
(Pause)  
  
Caller: I think there's another one coming up.
