Hello readers, my name is Chase, and I have a story from the Perry state forest and my home that neither me nor my friends will ever forget, but before that, here is some backstory.  We lived bordering the perry state forest, on a large hill. My entire immediate family lived on this hill, my grandfather, aunt, uncle, cousins, my mother, father, and me. My aunt and uncle had a medium sized farm and raised many goats and had free roam chickens. It was extremely common for the animals to go missing. We honestly just chocked it up to the coyotes, until we caught a mountain lion on one of our trail cams. Mind you, we live in southern Ohio, we aren’t supposed to have mountain lions here, yet there was one, with its own den in our woods. Our.. “wild” woods. 

we always had odd things happen at night, Seeing shadows, hear loud knocks, whispers, screams, footsteps, even hearing drums in the woods every year around Halloween. Pretty creepy. But moving forward, let’s get into the meat of this story. My first encounter that I can remember is when I was maybe 8 years old and fell asleep late in my living room. We had a very large window with a TV to the left of it, in the corner of the room. I woke up and looked at the clock, and It was about 3:00AM and the TV was buzzing static, I looked out the window from the couch and there it was. A tall man, wearing a brown cloak (likely made of deer skins) and a deer head covering his face. Standing in the window with a little Indian girl in braids to his right. He stood there and stared at me for a long time, then waved to me in a way that said “come out side, it’s okay, just come on out”. After I freaked and just sat there in shock, they both walked out of view of the window. I had a sudden urge to follow but I stayed put and cried out of fright. I then ran to my room and eventually fell asleep. 

The next morning I explained what had happened to me earlier that night and My mother told me it was a friendly Indian chief who was just paying a visit, meaning no harm. I had since then blocked the experience from my memory And pretty much forgot that it even happened until years later my mom sat me down and told me the truth. That “cheif” has been around for a very long time and terrorized everyone on the hill and staring at them from a distance since they first moved in, around 1999. She told me, according to her knowledge that he was from the Adena  tribe and during his time, he would collect kids from the surrounding tribes and take them away, for human sacrifices. She then further explained that He wasn’t waving me hello, he was waving me on, to follow him outside with the Indian girl, To do god knows what with me once I was alone in the woods. She said He is evil, and my mother doesn’t use that word often. But she said “whatever that thing is, it’s evil” and “don’t ever go out there in the woods alone at night. Don’t even go with friends. Stay as far away from the deep woods. A evil lives there.” 

And so of course, I didn’t listen. And me and my friends quickly learned our lesson. 
Me and my two friends, we will call them Andy and Jeremy, decide to have some spooky fun after a long and boring night. we were all 17 to 18 years old, so we hatched the plan to go into the woods, and into the Perry State Forest to try to scare ourselves and just mess around and have a fun time. After all, there where roads in the forest that was only a couple of miles long, for example in a twenty minute drive you could easily make it right into the city, it was a straight shot, one single road, with no turns. We decided to drive, because hoofing it out there was just a little too ballsy for our Taste. In all honesty we just loved the rush of being spooked. Andy and Jeremy are, or at least where, the furthest thing from superstitious, for they didn’t believe in anything unless they could see it or feel it themselves. And that’s exactly what they got. We was in my father’s car, a  manual bmw, it was a fast car and we felt oh-so cool driving it around. The time was approaching 2:30AM when we slowly drove into the forest, after turning off of the main road. 

Upon entering the forest had a wave of… something come crashing into us, it felt as if we were fazing through a wall that wasn’t there. The air felt heavy and thick. and we felt extreme pressure on our chests. this made our eyes tear up, and it was hard to breathe. There was no pain, just an overwhelming feeling of sadness, anger, guilt, dread, regret and emotional distress. it honestly felt like every bad feeling you could possibly feel all together at once. We felt like we needed to turn around and just say “forget it” but we wanted this, we wanted to feel scared. It’s what we came here for in the first place. 

So we continue driving through the weird wall of bad feelings and we all just thought we got that weird feeling because we were in the woods at night and it was late and dark out. And I mean really dark out, it was a new moon so we really didn’t have any light. It made sense at the time, yet the headlights were only able to see about a yard in front of us, which was not normal for the LED lights my dad had installed. We talked amongst ourselves about how weird that feeling we got was when we entered the forest. Then out of nowhere we saw a large black figure standing at the left side of the road, and just watched us drive by, and by the time we passed it, it was gone. And when I say black, it wasn’t just black, it was darker than anything I’ve ever seen before, the darkness of the forest behind it almost looked bright in comparison. We checked in the rear view mirrors, and it had just vanished, poof, gone. Like it was never there in the first place. We said some obscenity’s to each other completely stunned and aghast at what we just witnessed. 

We drove for about a whole minute in silence, until Andy said “Did y’all see that shit?” We all agreed with a simple “uh-huh”. We continued to drive. After a little while Andy looks up at the sky and says “uh guys, the sky looks kinda.. off”.  Me and Jeremy looked up, and the sky wasn’t just “off” it was blood red, yet it was so dark in the forest that you couldn’t see your hand in-front of your face. We thought maybe it was starting to get daylight out but it was only 2:32AM. We were perplexed at how little time passed since we entered and at how on earth the sky could be light up in such a dark red. At first, we thought it could possibly be a blood moon, yet there was no moon to be seen. We continued on our journey for what felt like a half an hour in a straight line. Then suddenly Andy yelped and said “no.. no, no, no we just seen that tree, I just seen that tree, it’s like we are going in a circle! You didn’t take any turns did you chase?” I denied with a simple “no, why would I? It’s a straight line through here, I don’t want to get lost, especially out here.” and so we continued to pass the same trees, the same guard rail, the same lake, the same signs, the same exact everything over and over and over again. Everything kept repeating, as if we where driving in a big circle, but that’s impossible since the road is only a straight line through, there are many turns that we could have taken but we never turned, not once. 

“Dang man this feels like some blare witch shit” Jeremy murmured. As we continued to drive through the endless loop we where now apparently stuck in, over time we slowly started to see dark figures in the woods, shadows, things staring at us in the trees and and scariest of all, deer that didn’t look right. Something was off about them. They would all just stand there and stare at the car, and sway back and forth. yet unlike how normal deer eyes glow when lights hit them, there was no glow, like a black, empty void within each eyeball. then one spontaneously jumped in-front of the car, making us all physically recoil, and brace for the impact of a deer entering my front grill, but it never happened. It disappeared just as quickly as it had jumped in front of us. “No man this isn’t right We need to turn around that can’t happen, this isn’t real” Jeremy said to me, I told him that we couldn’t be far from the exit after all we’ve been driving for what we felt like was hours.  So we continued driving down the dirt road We then noticed the dark figures in the woods to slowly transform into a more.. human figure. We also started seeing disembodied eyes staring at us and heard odd distorted animal noises, screams and whimpers. we suddenly all had something in our heads telling us to “just stop the car. Stop the car and get out and everything will stop” We all shook off the eerie feeling that came over us. We then  heard whispers, but these where no ordinary whispers, they sounded like they where coming from INSIDE the car. Again, we continued to drive. While driving we would also sporadically get a glimpse of the.. thing we seen at the very beginning when we entered. 

Then, abruptly all the visions and sounds stopped. We then heard a girl scream, not a coyote or a bobcat, a girl, and it wasn’t in the woods, it was right in all of our ears, it was loud enough to make our ears ring. then the car shut off. Dead. No lights on, no nothing. Just off. Pitch black darkness. I tried to start it and nothing. While trying to start the car we heard a train in the distance and it sounded like we were on the tracks ourselves, hell we could feel the ground rumbling. But the odd thing was, there was not a railroad anywhere near the park. Not for many miles. So how is it that we could hear the chug of the engine, the whistle and the screeching of the wheels? We had absolutely no idea. it got closer and closer until it sounded like the train was in the car, passing right through us. while the train was going through the car, that car came back to life, all the lights on, just like normal. So I started it. Tried to take off, and killed it. (It was a manual and I was scared, it was my own error but it still scared me when the car lurched to a stop) I then started it again and took off. 

We were fleeing for our lives at this point so we were easily hitting 50 mph on a shitty gravel road.  We continued to pass the same everything over and over again, I then abruptly slammed on my breaks. “Damn dude!” “What the hell man?!” Andy and Jeremy both yelled as they face planted into the front seats. Guys, look. They look up in awe to see car two car headlights coming right at us, growing bigger by the second. I was stopped and i panicked and instead of driving out of the way, which there wasn’t any real “out-of-the-way” since we were on a very narrow Road, I started to flash my lights at them, hoping they would see and stop. But they didn’t. They continue to get closer and closer, so we all just accepted our fates and put our heads down to protect us from the collision. We waited and waited, and nothing happened. We all looked up and it had just vanished, just like the deers had previously. no car, no tread marks, no dust cloud, nothing. It was just all in our heads. 

At this point we knew something was in our heads, warping reality and making us perceive whatever it wanted us to see. We continued down the road. After about 15 minutes of relative peace, other than the screams and human figures and other horrific things happening, the radio randomly switched on and we heard people talking on the radio through static but they weren’t just radio hosts, it was people, so many people talking at once it was defining. We heard loud knocking and banging on the doors and windows, enough to shake the car. The voices in our heads were now  scream at us to stop driving, to roll down the windows. to get out of the car. To do anything to let them in. Everything was deafening, it was so insanely loud and we all started weeping, we just gave up, we couldn’t handle it anymore. 
 
then, In the blink of an eye we appeared on the new reservoir road, right before the city. We all looked to each other, completely stunned on how the hell we just teleported to the end of the dirt road, out of the forest. the radio was still blaring static so reached and turned it down so we could talk amongst ourselves. I looked and seen The time was now 3:00AM. How did such little time pass? How did we get here? We had no clue, and we still don’t. We were just glad it was over. We drove away, to the city. The sky slowly faded from red to black. We stopped at the 24 hour Taco Bell and got some food, and sat in the parking lot talking about what we all had just experienced. We then drove back to my dad’s, and walked up to the front door, exhausted. Then right before walking in, there it was. The figure we seen at the very beginning, standing right on the edge of the property line. Staring directly at us. But now we could see it in finite detail. 

It was about 7 feet tall with broad shoulders and the stature Akeem to a man. wearing a blacker than black cloak and a deer skull on its head with piercing red glowing eyes. It then raised its hand to its chest and waved a single wave, from its chest to its hip, then it vanished into the woods behind it. We then went inside, and all fell asleep immediately, after vowing to never, ever go out there again. 

But funnily enough, years later we have all agreed to go camping in those very woods, next week. If anything happens, I will write again. This was my first time ever writing something like this and if it wasn’t for my friends experiencing all of it along with me, I would simply think I am bat shit insane. It was their idea for me to even write this in the first place, so I hope it was easy to read. And thank you, for reading our story. And also, heed my mother’s warning and don’t ever go into the Perry State Forest at night, because an evil really does live there.
