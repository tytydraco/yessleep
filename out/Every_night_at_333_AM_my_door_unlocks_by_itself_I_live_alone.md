For the past 17 nights, my front door has unlocked itself at exactly 3:33 AM.

Not 3:32. Not 3:34. 3:33 AM, on the dot.

I live alone in a small one-bedroom apartment on the third floor of a building that’s honestly more run-down than I’d like to admit. It’s the kind of place where the wallpaper peels at the corners and the hall lights flicker more often than they shine. But rent is cheap, and I don’t have many options.

It started innocently—or at least, I thought so. I’d get up in the morning, bleary-eyed, and notice my front door was unlocked. At first, I assumed I’d forgotten to lock it. I started double-checking every night. I’d lock it. Test it. Even pulled on the knob a few times to be sure.

Still, every morning: unlocked.

So I set up my phone camera on a chair, facing the door. I hit record, left the hallway light on, and went to bed.

When I checked the footage the next day, my blood ran cold.

At exactly 3:33 AM, the lock just… *clicked*. It didn’t rattle, no one touched it, the knob didn’t turn. It simply unlocked itself like an invisible hand had turned the deadbolt from the inside.

I called my landlord. He shrugged it off and said old doors can settle weirdly, that I was “probably dreaming” and should “stop watching late-night horror movies.”

But I wasn’t dreaming. And I stopped watching horror anything weeks ago.

On night five, I placed a strip of tape over the inside lock and jammed a chair under the doorknob. I even balanced a glass on top, figuring if anyone tried to open it, I’d hear it crash.

At 3:33 AM, the tape peeled off, the chair slid gently aside on its own, and the door… clicked open.

The glass never moved.

But the hallway light flickered once—just once—and went out.

I didn’t sleep at all that night. I just laid there, staring at the door, heart pounding, phone in hand, too scared to move.

By night eight, I stopped recording. Watching the footage was worse than experiencing it. Something about seeing it play out in silence, again and again, broke something in me. I didn’t want proof anymore. I wanted out.

But when I tried to break my lease, the office told me I’d already submitted a written request to stay another six months. I hadn’t.

They showed me the form. It was my name. My signature. My handwriting.

I didn’t write it.

Night eleven: I nailed a wooden plank across the door. Not just the lock, but the whole frame. It took me three hours, hammering with shaking hands.

3:33 AM.

I heard the nails creak, groan… and then fall to the floor, one by one. Soft clinks in the dark. Then the door swung open—not fully, just a crack. Like it was *watching* me.

I never saw anyone. I never heard footsteps. Just the sound of the lock. And the overwhelming sense that something was in the room with me.

Last night—night seventeen—I didn’t sleep. I sat in the corner with every light on, armed with a kitchen knife, waiting.

At 3:32 AM, my power went out.

And at 3:33, the door creaked open again.

Only this time… something walked in.

I couldn’t see it. But I *felt* it. Like the air shifted, thicker and colder, like the breath of something ancient had filled the room. The knife slipped from my hand. I couldn’t move.

I couldn’t scream.

Whatever it was, it knelt beside me. I swear I felt a hand touch my hair.

And then I heard a voice, rasping like leaves in windless woods:
“You’re almost ready.”

Ready for what?

It’s 3:15 AM now.

The door is locked.

But I don’t think it matters anymore.

I think tonight, it’s not going to wait to be let in.
