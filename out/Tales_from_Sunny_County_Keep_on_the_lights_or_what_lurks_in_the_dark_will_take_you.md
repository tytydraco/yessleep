Tales from Sunny County, Part 1

You've heard it before. Small town, but somethings off. That's how it is here in Sunny, always has been. There's been a hundred and one explanations; it's divine punishment for sin, it's a curse, you get the idea.

All you need to know is that we don't know what "they" are. It's not really explainable, the whole point is it doesn't make sense and it isn't supposed to. I was a Police Officer here in Sunny for 20 years, and even I couldn't really explain it. 

This is my journal. An account of events, I guess. My therapist said it'd help my retirement. 

• My childhood, born in 49. 

Ever since I was a boy, it was normality: keep the lights on at all times, no dark places in the house, curtains shut the second the sun starts to go down. Became second nature, whenever I questioned my Mama about it she'd shut me down. Protecting me, I suppose.

Life was good. There was the odd incident, but it was always kept away from a child's ears as not to scare them. At school, we'd hear whisperings about the monsters that lurked, but we had no idea what they even were. None of us had seen it. None had been affected by it, either, thankfully. Except one girl. She'd lost her Dad, and she didn't talk about it at all, or talk much. Knowing what I know now, I feel for her terribly. 

• 1972, my rookie year.

Being a cop was always my dream since I was a kid. It felt right. The first few weeks went smooth, there was never really any crime here, people had other concerns. Them. My first call with my senior partner, Mick, regarding these things came on any old afternoon.

"Code Black. I repeat, Code Black on Francis Drive. Number.. uh.. 34." 

Our patrol car spun around in the middle of the road, racing to this suburban house on a nice road. You could see it from outside. A light off upstairs. 

"It's upstairs. Let's go."

I frowned, rushing out of the car and drawing my revolver. 

"Shouldn't we wait for bac-"

I spoke, interrupted as Mick booted open the front door. 

"No time! SCPD!"

We rushed inside, without surveying the room, rushing up the stairs and that's when I saw it. My ignorance to these.. things.. shattered. My childlike innocence was gone just like that. I knew OF them, but never saw one. 

A single tear dripped down my cheek as Mick turned around, dragging me down the stairs like a ragdoll as I froze. In the darkness, a face. Distorted. Impossibly distorted. The most inhuman monster, completely incomprehensible. If you're thinking of a demon or maybe a masked killer.. you're wrong. It'd be better if you were right, because what had reered its ugly head in the dark was Hell itself. Hell on Earth. Whoever was in that room.. I knew it had done something to them. Slaughtered them, perhaps. Mick did too. 

It's a blur after that, there was about 5 cop cars and a government van outside of the house. An ambulance, too, I could see a woman trying to comfort her two kids, both wailing and terrified. I sat silently on the hood of our patrol car. I'd never be the same, nor would those kids.

"Bust bulb. They say he shoved his kid outta the room before it came. Crazy how fast it happens, huh, kid?"

Mick interrupted my train of thought, handing me a warm coffee. I was still lost, half of me hearing what he was saying after that, half of me trapped. Trapped in that house. The image of fear itself burned into my memory. Perhaps forever. 

I saw it at night. Every single night. Closing my eyes was terrifying, I always kept multiple lamps in my room, backup generators and whatnot. I couldn't even sleep for weeks out of fear of some lamp bugging out and something.. doing something to me. 

The Code Black calls were infrequent, but my blood ran cold every damn time. I'll write about them some other time. Until next time.
