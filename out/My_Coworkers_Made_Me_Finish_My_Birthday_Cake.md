It's my birthday today. I hate going to work on my birthday, not because I care about it (I’m not 12), but because I hate the way people treat you on your birthday.

“There’s the birthday girl!”

“Happy birthday to you!”

“You don’t look a day over 35! Oh, you’re turning 31? Well… uh… happy birthday…”

Plus, my office has this aggravating tradition.

Everyone gathers around the birthday person, party hat strings cutting into jiggly jawlines, cheeks aching with taut, cloying smiles, and we watch that poor sucker choke down a whole slice of cake.

Protest all you want, you’re inhaling that entire fucking piece. *You have to! Finish so we can dig in! It’s tradition!!*

To be honest, no one has ever refused to finish their slice. Until today.

…

I spend the morning anxiously awaiting this humiliation ritual. It usually occurs in the slump of the day, around 3pm.

By 2:15, my knee is bouncing with unease. I’m thinking maybe I can slip out early. *I’m not feeling well*, I’ll say, *please enjoy the cake without me*. It’s worth a shot.

I approach Teresa in HR, master of birthday ceremonies, and plead my case.

“I’m sorry you’re not feeling well, girlie,” she purrs, “but who could enjoy a party without the birthday girl? I’ll set up the conference room.” She bustles away in a hurry.

Come 2:45, I’m seated at the head of the table, a neon green tablecloth crinkling every time I shift my weight. Around me, a sea of delighted faces, cone hats pointing up at god as if to say: *one year closer to meeting your maker!*

Teresa sets a hulking slice of chocolate cake in front of me with glittering eyes. Everyone cradles their own, eagerly awaiting the chance to dig in.

“Happy birthday, girlie. Bon appetit!”

I fork off a massive chunk, hoping to devour this wedge in as few bites as possible. I raise it to the stiff smiles around me, *cheers!* Teresa licks her lips.

Then I swallow.

A round of polite, golf applause fills the room.

A sugary film coats my tongue, settling like silt between my teeth. There’s something else there, lurking behind the chocolate, chalky and dense. My palms tingle with sweat. Everyone’s staring at me, I hate that.

I hack off another glob, scraping the gooey icing with my bendy plastic fork.

Down the hatch. *That taste,* I ponder, *what is it*? My heart rate picks up, thumping loudly in my ears.

“Eat, eat, eat!” Chants someone from the amorphous stretch of genial faces.

As I scoop up another wad of cake, a surge of bitter bile rises in my throat. Prickles of sweat collect at the nape of my neck. Sparse giggles crop up around the room. *Are they laughing*? *Why are they laughing*?

I slurp my third hunk.

My stomach drops. That familiar tightness in my throat, the flaming itchiness blooming up my cheeks. It can’t be.

“So uh,” I squeak out, sputtering specks of chocolate onto the table, “is there peanut in this?”

Teresa giggles, shrill and grating. “You can’t make Reese’s cake without peanuts, silly billy!”

*There are so many people here. I need air. No, I need my EpiPen.*

Between panicked, gulping breaths, I wheeze, “I’m allergic. EpiPen. In my desk.” 

But they all just stand there, beaming madly.

She knows I’m allergic to peanuts. Everyone does. *Is this because PB&Js aren’t allowed at the office anymore*?

My throat tightens, vision narrows. I only have minutes. I rise and swim through the crowd towards the door. I’m bumping into cheery coworkers standing stock still. They block my path, and throw good-natured jabs my way.

“Aw, c’mon, you can eat more than that!”

“You deserve to indulge, it’s your birthday!”

“We can’t eat until the birthday girl finishes her slice!”

I slam into the metal doorframe, and a shockwave of pain radiates from my hip. Through my tunnel vision, I spot my desk. A few mere feet stretch out like miles before me.

“Excuse me!” Teresa’s face floats in front of mine, contorted into a purplish red scowl. “I made this from scratch. For you. You have to finish it.”

I weakly swat the smeared paper plate and careen around her. My coworkers boo and murmur to one another. I hear a few stray words whiz past me. “Rude,” “ungrateful,” “poor Teresa.”

My sweat-soaked hair clings to my forehead. My heart vibrates weakly. My mouth runs dry, sickeningly sweet. *WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING*, I scream in my head.

Teresa marches in front of me and forces a trembling fork in my face. “Eat it.”

I have no choice but to barrel straight through her, landing with a harsh thud on the punishingly hard floor. The harsh carpet bites at my elbows as I pull my useless body closer to my desk, inch by agonizing inch. Breathless, I reach for the drawer.

Then I feel it, smashed against my slacks, a gluey slice of cake. A wave of frantic hilarity surges through the room. Then another slice, this time square into my lower back. Another on the bottom of my shoes. Another smashed into my ear. I think of the people throughout history who were stoned to death by their peers.

My vision goes black as my dumb fingers fumble for the drawer. My head drifts in darkness, drenched in poison. I’m going down…

SPLAT! Straight into a cloying, syrupy mess. Chocolate peanut butter frosting oozes up my nostrils, under my eyelids.

“She finished it, finally! Happy birthday, girlie. Everyone, dig in!”

Then the mouths of my coworkers engulf me, sucking the sticky icing from my clothes, hair, and face. Every surface of my body grows slick with candied saliva.

I’m fighting, flailing, drowning. *SAVE ME*, I scream internally. But the voice in my head grows meeker, farther away. I’m sinking, sinking, sinking…

…

I wake up to harsh, fluorescent light. My doctor tells me I’m lucky to have a coworker like Teresa. Says she rode with me in the ambulance. “She saved your life, no doubt about it.” He muses. I’m too shocked to object.

I decide not to tell my mom the full story, I don’t want to worry her. The car air is thick with words unsaid. She drives me home, and drops me off at my apartment complex with a kiss and an Amazon gift card.

I collapse into my hand-me-down couch, weak and splotchy.

I have to type up what happened, just to get it out of my brain. I know most people will not believe me, but I feel lighter with every word. I finish, but it seems to lack an ending. Anxiety creeps over me, *it’s not done yet*.

I check my phone, hoping to distract myself with a few birthday texts. Surely someone remembered.

No texts. Only one new email. From Teresa. I take a deep breath and open it with a shaking finger.

“Happy birthday, girlie! Sorry you didn’t love the cake. We’ll try again next year!

“p.s. We saved you a slice in the break room. See you tomorrow! :)”
