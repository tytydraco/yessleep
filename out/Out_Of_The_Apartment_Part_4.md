Things have finally calmed down here to something in the vicinity of peace. I'll try not to complain too much since this is probably as good as it's going to get with Van and Roscoe living under the same roof. Speaking of whom, I'll be sharing their sequence of events in case there may be anything to glean from them. I'll relay Roscoe's perspective since I heard it firsthand. This was the morning of my terrifying escape at Walmart and Drake having to fight for survival in the gym.

Roscoe was already down in the dumps since the court ruling last month. His “no good two-timing bitch of an ex-wife” as he so eloquently put it was able to convince the judge overseeing their custody case that a small apartment stocked with booze and guns wasn't a safe place for two toddlers. Although it's not my place, I can't say I object to that ruling.  To vent his frustrations, he and his buddies planned a weekend hunting trip. So they set off to set up camp about four hours from town.

For the most part,  the trip was an enjoyable experience, just shooting, joking, and drinking among friends. That said, Roscoe witnessed some things I think should be mentioned. The first is that some animals were acting out of sorts.  There was a river by the campsite that many of them were drinking from. I know that animals get thirsty too.

What Roscoe and the others found strange was that many of them were drinking from it simultaneously. Both predator and prey alike were standing side by side, lapping up water, but this went beyond thirst and into addiction. They were consuming such an enormous quantity that many of them threw up and collapsed. Many of them also appeared starved like they hadn't eaten in days. While none of them were scared by this, it did rub many of them the wrong way.

A deer approached their camp. Given that they are normally fickle creatures, this was odd.  Yes, there are exceptions to this, and some are somewhat trusting of humans. That’s one reason a deer may not flee. The other is if there’s something wrong with it, brain disease, in this case.

Someone in the group pointed this out. Roscoe being Roscoe, though, said “I can still put it on my wall”. Then he put a bullet in it point blank. Not very sporting if you ask me. Then again, I suppose he needs a win every once in a while. Anyway, his friends weren't exactly happy about him firing off his rifle without warning in their vicinity. They proceeded to chastise him, throwing empty beer cans as they did.

The mood went from peculiar to unnerving at what occurred next. One person in the group was the first to notice it. The animals had stopped drinking and were now staring at them. Even from that distance, everyone could tell there was something in their eyes that didn't sit right with any of them. It was a sharpened hunger combined with a distinct awareness.

Nobody had seen anything like it and many thought they would be attacked. Roscoe also mentions he remembers the animals being thin like the water was the only thing they were consuming. Neither humans nor animals would break eye contact. Even armed, Roscoe and his friends were severely outnumbered. Luckily for them, things didn't escalate to that point.

The animals went back to what they were doing. Everyone in Roscoe's group decided to cut the hunting trip short. There was still the deer he'd shot. Nobody trusted the meat from it. Roscoe wanted to get something to take home so he cut its head off to mount.

Then everyone went home. By the time Roscoe got back to our neighborhood, the sun was rising and he wanted to get the deer's head inside before anyone spotted him. I should mention at this point that deer hunting is only permissible during the winter months in our state. If reported, a violator will suffer a fine and possibly have their hunting license as well as their gun taken. In a stroke of bad luck, Van happened to come outside in that instant.

He caught Roscoe carrying the deer's head and said he was going to report him which led to their altercation. Moving onto Van, he had a conversation with Drake who in turn told me about it. Van's job at the town hall mainly revolves around answering calls, shredding documents, sorting through files, and receiving all the complaints Schneider got on his computer. That sounds miserable as hell. Our jobs at Goodwill may not be the most lucrative, but at least we aren't working for a scumfuck like him.

I'm not trying to hold that against Van. I understand people need to earn a living. For his sequence of events, things were relatively normal except that they were having him shred way more documents than normal. Drake asked him if he noticed anything odd on them. He said he has to get rid of so many that there isn't time to read even a single paper.

He did overhear something peculiar on the day prior to his time off. He was getting back from a restroom break and walking past Schneider's office. He stopped when he heard yelling coming from it. Curious, he figured a little eavesdropping couldn't hurt. Of the bits and pieces he picked up on, he gathered that someone was trying to put pressure on Schneider over a deal.

With whom, we don't know. While it can't be confirmed that's related to what's happening now, the timing does raise a red flag. Van said that when Schneider left for the day, he looked rattled. From there, nothing else noteworthy happens until his fight with Roscoe. That brings us to today.

While Hummers are loud and obnoxious, they are also roomy and we took advantage of that, packing up the rest of the groceries. Then we were off. I helped by directing Roscoe to the road we were going to use. When we reached it, we realized the Hummer may be a bit too big to drive through it.

“Fuck it,” Roscoe said, flooring the gas.

At first, it seemed as if the Hummer was stuck. He kept at it and soon we heard branches begin cracking. Pushing our way through, we were on our way out.

“By the way, what’s the plan once we’re done with this?” he asked.

“I got cousin Me and Gus can crash with,” Drake said.  “What about you?”

“I have an uncle out of state who’s a pretty cool guy. I’ll have to give him a call.”

I turned to Van.

“What about you?”

“Me? I’ve got savings so I’ll be fine for a while. I’ll probably stay at another motel or a rented room until I can get back on my feet.”

“Of course, you’d be the only one of us who can save money working for shit Schneider.”

Van once again gave Roscoe that customer service smile.

“I get paid well because I’m good at what I do, unlike some people.”

Seeing Roscoe’s glare in the rearview, Drake and I intervened.

“Guys, we can please not do this shit right now?” Drake asked. “Once we’re in the clear, have it, but until then let’s  try to get along.”

Roscoe and Van simmered down, only giving each other the occasional dirty look.  We continued in silence and were relieved when we finally reached the path's exit.

“Thank Christ,” Roscoe said. “That fucking scraping was driving me up the wall,”

All of us were glad town was behind us or so we thought.  I still had the binoculars and once again, I glanced through them. What I saw, nearly made my heart stop.

“Hit the brakes,” I abruptly screamed.

Roscoe slammed them out of reflex giving us all whiplash.

“The hell’s the matter with you, Gus?” he asked sharply.

Instead of answering, I handed him the binoculars. Upon raising them to his eyes, his face turned pale. It was the same when they were handed to Drake and Van. Someone set up a blockade at the town limit. If that wasn’t bad enough,  it was being guarded by people in swat armor and cops, several of whom we recognized.

We also saw a handful wearing hazmat suits.  However, the most disturbing thing is it turned out we weren’t the only ones with our particular plan of escape. This was evidenced by the corpses getting bagged away with bullet wounds in their foreheads as well as all the abandoned vehicles.

“They’re keeping people here,” I said.

Yeah, that was a no-shit statement. I just needed to get it off my chest.

“Those government mother fuckers,” Roscoe spat, “but why are  the police working with them?”

Answering that was a whole other topic. We needed to focus on the one at hand.

“Maybe we can cut through the forest on foot?” Van suggested.

“That would take hours,” Drake told him. “They got snipers over there which means they’re probably checking the woods. Not to mention, we don’t know how many zombies we might run into.”

“You know what? I say we get the guns in the back and blast our way through these sons a bitches,” Roscoe said.

“Roscoe, I hate to be the one to break it to you, but they have basically a small army and, there’s fours of only three who know how to use guns, “ I pointed out.

Roscoe was about to object when a sniper bullet went through the windshield, piercing through his eye and seat and into the back seat directly above Van’s shoulder. He slumped over lifeless, falling on the steering wheel and making his horn go off. We freaked the fuck out and crouched right before being met with a barrage.

“We have to get out of here,” Van shouted over the sound of shattering glass.

“You think we don’t fucking know that?” Drake snapped.

If they hit one of the tries, it was game over for us. Roscoe’s foot was still on the brakes. Drake shifted the Hummer in reverse and then put Roscoe; 's foot on the gas. Luckily for us, the path was straight so backing out of it was relatively simple, provided us not getting shot at. When it was safe, we all straightened out.

Drake opened the driver’s door and pushed Roscoe out. Then he got in the seat. We didn’t have time to catch our breath since who should be waiting for us other than a hoard of zombies? In hindsight,  maybe all the noise we made snapping branches wasn’t t our stealthiest option. Although in fairness to us, we thought we wouldn't have to worry about that.

Like ants to sugar water, they were on us, breaking through holes in the windshield.

“Gus, Van, guns,” Drake screamed, trying to drive with them clinging to the hood.

Scrambling, we grabbed some pistols from that back. I undid the safety on one and tossed it to Drake. He caught it and when a zombie broke through, he pulled the trigger. It rolled off and we ran over it, hearing a popping sound as we did. On his side, Van was screaming and panic-firing

“Don’t waste ammo. It only takes one shot to the head to kill them.” I  yelled.

I was covering both my window as well as the back windshield.

“I can't see anything like this,” Drake exclaimed.

A zombie managed to poke its head into the passenger side. Without looking, he put a round in it. We eventually managed to take them all out in time to realize we were heading for the edge of a cliff. Drake tried in vain to stop. The Hummer hit a curve and flipped on its side, rolling downward all the way.

It stopped, now a wreck with smoke coming out of its hood. Then the engine went dead.

“Is everyone still in one piece?” I asked.

I felt something trickle down my face. When I went to wipe it away, there was blood on my palm.

“No, but I'll live,” Drake replied.

“I think I fractured something,” Van said, in pain.

Roscoe's camping supplies included a first aid kit. We used it to mend our injuries as best we could.

“Okay, now where exactly are we?” Drake asked.

Where we'd ended up was another part of the woods that stretched on for miles.

“I don't know,” I said. “Do you think we can climb back up?”

“Not in our condition and besides, it's too flat.”

“What should we do then?”

Drake glanced at the Hummer and then back to us.

“I think our best bet is to see if we can get this thing working again.”

Yeah, so things didn't turn out the way we hoped. I'm afraid we've been at this for hours with no luck. My phone battery is almost out and I know it's only a matter of time until the zombies find us. We still have plenty of firepower so the three of us can at least make a heroic final stand, well me and Drake anyway.  If I don't update again know that I want my last words to be fuck this shit.
