[Part 7.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1p57y1s/every_night_a_strange_flight_of_stairs_appears_in/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

I pushed the door open to find another corridor stretching ahead, a faint glow beckoning from its far end. As I made my way forward, a subtle hum vibrated at the edge of hearing. The hallway emptied into what I can only describe as a white void, not a white room, but an absence of any real architecture. No visible walls, ceiling, or floor, just a void of white that somehow held me up. Three more corridors branched from this non-space, each terminating in a door that seemed to hover in the distance.

After standing for a moment in the center of the surreal space I had found myself in, I decided to pick another hall and approach the door. It looked plain at first, until I got close enough to see a strange word carved near the top into the door itself.

It said,

“**S N O M E D**”

It was strange but I had no other idea on which one to pick so I opened it. The knob gave a soft click, and the door opened slowly to reveal the sight beyond.

The first thing I noticed was the smell. The stench poured out of the place in a noxious wave that made my eyes tear up. It was like charred meat and burnt blood mixed with boiling sulfur. The terrible sight beyond made me freeze in place. Just a few yards away lay a red bowl of stone; its floor carpeted with limbs still twitching between gorged silhouettes. Horned shapes squatted over the remnants; their jaws unhinging farther than anatomy should allow. There was an awful tendon snapping sound. One beast lifted a face smeared in blood and saw me. It rose on massive hooves and presented terrible black horns. It bellowed something that sounded like the vocalization of a bull and a grizzly bear combined and launched itself at me.

I snapped out of my daze and scrambled to close the door. I managed to shut it just in time as the thing crashed into it. Yet once the door was closed, there was no impact, no violent shudder, no horns piercing through the plain door. I let out my breath and tried to calm myself. I was not going back there unless I had no choice. I decided to try another door.

The second corridor felt longer. When I reached the door, its surface bore no word, only a shallow depression shaped like a human hand. Though when I looked closer, I saw the fingers were too numerous, the palm was too wide. I pressed my own hand onto the irregular print before I could think better of it. I looked near the depression where a handle ought to have been and as my hand was held there a small engraving started to shimmer into existence just above.

It read,

“**S R E P A E R D N I M**”

I considered pushing the door open, but as I started to nudge the door, the pulsing behind it increased and I felt something tickle the back of my mind. The sensation felt like the consciousness eaters but worse. I took a reflexive step back and left that door, not wanting to see what horrors might lay within. I had to reconsider; I had to try another door.

The third corridor swallowed light as I walked into it. Each footfall echoed longer than physics should allow. The door at its end hung crooked; its warped wood expanding and contracting like diseased lungs. No carving, no handprint, only a thin seam weeping clear fluid that hissed when it touched the whiteness beneath me. I pressed my ear close to the door and gasped when I heard my mother’s voice speaking backwards. I reached for the knob and it felt like warm skin, pulsing with a heartbeat not my own. Then it whispered into my mind,

“**E M O H K C A B**” I realized that somehow, I’d already opened it from the inside hours ago.

I tried the final door and this time I saw something I had remembered writing in chalk just a while ago.

“**N E A R Z E**”

I remembered Sherrie’s words, “Write it backwards.” I considered the other doors and shuddered. I felt foolish that I was almost devoured by the horrors on the other side. Yet this one made no sense. “N E A R Z E” or “E Z R A E N”

I did not know who or what was an Ezraen, but if Sherrie was through the door I had to try. I held my breath, gripped the handle and opened it.

The door led to something I had grown accustomed to at this point, more stairs. The stairs were bone white and too smooth. They ascended into a terrible gallery that was as horrific as it was memorizing. Rows of black iron cages lined against both walls, packed tightly to envelop the whole area.

Inside them I found the denizens of the stairs.

Twitching Grabbers folded over and partly skinned but somehow alive. The terrible, blind hunter beasts clawing aimlessly at sounds they heard. There was one of the nightmarish consciousness eaters spinning slow circles with its mouth sewn shut by what looked like braided hair.

Near the end of the awful menagerie was Sherrie.

I rushed to her cage and checked on her. She was crouched at the far end, chalk still in her hands, eyes wild as she saw me approach. I stepped toward her and every cage rang at once, sounding like a thousand tiny bells inside my skull. I looked back and noticed the white stairs behind me quietly vanishing.

“Sherrie...” I whispered, fingers scraping rusted bars.

She crawled forward and spoke with a voice that was a cracked whisper.

“I...was too slow. A bunch of grabbers chased me down and I tripped and fell. They took me here. I have not been here since I first arrived, when I first lost it. I lost my scream, my soul in this place. I thought I could get it back...but he was here. You have to go. You have to leave now!”

Her eyes were wild and manic. There was a disturbing fear in them, not for herself and her own fate, but for me. She was genuinely frightened for what might be coming for us both. Despite her fear for my safety, the state she was in had made me want to help her even more.

I set about trying to find some way of opening the gate when I heard a different voice ring out overhead.

“Visitors, oh my my my.”

We looked up and saw a man standing on a dais near a second story of the grim prison. He loomed over us for a moment, then jumped theatrically down to our level. He landed neatly, suffering no discomfort from the drop which looked at least twelve feet or so.

He was wiry and emaciated, but had an odd energy in his movement, like he was hiding something unnatural. When his features became clearer, I was disturbed to see he wore a pallid, expressionless mask on his head. The blank sight amidst all the madness of this prison was jarring.

“I am Ezraen,” he crooned, arms drifting wide. “You must be my other honored guest. Oh, how I have longed to find you both here. I’m so happy it’s finally happening, two of you together. This time I cannot fail, this time I will be released.”

Sherrie clutched the bars as she watched the strange man move closer to us. Then she started mumbling.

“I mapped the salt crusted steps below. I had to come here, I had to get it back, my spirit, my focus, the tether to my soul.” She looked distant and broke into her sing song rhyming again,

“The water bends, the waves break. Cast a shadow on the path to take, away from him, away from fear, to finally see a way out of here...”

Ezraen’s laughter rang out and Sherrie spoke.

“Silence, little chalk sparrow.” Unless you want me to add you to the other enclosures and see if they treat you any better. Sherrie looked back at me as if pleading for me to run.

I did not know what to do, but I had seen enough to know whatever this crazy man wanted to happen was not something that would be good for us.

I called out, trying to sound braver than I felt,

“Let her go! She is a human being, not a monster like these other things.” Ezraen chuckled again, a cutting sound that illustrated his disdain for me.

“Is she? Well for now yes, though this one is special. Her spirit, her ability...well she would make a fine specimen, perhaps even a replacement. She could hold this place together with some training, but with two, oh why yes, I think it might finally be time.”

He clapped his hands together and cocked his head in what might have been some semblance of happiness. Despite the disturbing situation, my curiosity about the situation won out and I had to ask this strange man living at the top of the stairs about this place and why he needed us.

“Why did you take her? And what is this place?” I asked him directly. He paused for a moment, and I heard a delighted laugh under the impassive mask.

“Why haven't you noticed? It's just a lot of stairs!” He cackled at his own remark and laughed until he began a hideous wheezing and coughing fit. He composed himself after and continued.

“Truth be told even I don’t know its exact nature. Though I suspect it is a nexus. An idea of a place, shared in many minds. It is here and not here. It only appears to a select few people who are in the right place at the right time and are willing to see it. I never meant to find it when I did, yet I was overjoyed when I had stumbled upon a different dimension just outside my room. But of course, all knowledge has a price and the gifts of this place cost me something as well.” He paused for a moment and looked down as if he was lost in thought.

“I don’t know how long its been now, how long I have languished here. Even the dominion I asserted over the strange creatures here brought fleeting respite. I tried to expand for a time, to leave for another nexus. But the pinnacle is only able to control the things here. The others that live beyond, the ones separated by the other doors are horrible things that resist my control and slaughter my servants, yet the simple doors and words keep them contained. Yes, I have learned much and gained power. But the power means little when I cannot leave. The beasts I feared when I arrived, I brought them to heel. Then I sought to control them and succeeded. Though now they only disappoint me in their random and eternal instinctive nature to possess and destroy. Who could live in this place with only them as company?” He had a deranged almost pleading appeal in his voice that wavered and cracked into a cynical laugh.

“Suffice to say I have had my fill of this place now, that is where you two come in. I have played enough; I need someone with as much mental energy as I had when I first arrived to keep this place alive. It will not let me leave otherwise.” He sounded more agitated as he continued.

“Fortunately, your little friend arrived, the curious little lamb. She eluded my pets for a while, but eventually she fell into my web, I thought I had her, thought I could keep her as a companion, but she ran. So, I had to take a piece from her, to keep her from leaving. I knew if she would not stay with me, then she could take my place. The price of the pinnacle of the knowledge to control this place is a piece of your soul. The part I stole from her was not enough, not enough for me to leave this place, or for her to. But with a third person....” He paused and looked at me, and I could feel him smiling under the distorted mask.

“Well that might just be enough to finally get out. It is only fair really, I have been here so long, but you, yes you two can stay. Perhaps in another century or so someone else can come along and you can convince them to stay and you can leave. But my time is up I am leaving and I’m afraid you are in no position to refuse. As long as I’m in control here, I will have my pets rip you limb from limb if you try and escape or deny me my freedom again.”

I almost felt sympathy for the creature speaking to us. The man had been trapped for who knew how long, surviving in this nightmare, somehow taking control of the creatures and living alone on the pinnacle for ages. Yet I was not prepared to stay in this purgatory for his sake or leave Sherrie to do the same. I knew I had to think of a way to escape for both of us.

I looked at Sherrie, and she glanced back at me and gently shook her head. I knew she wouldn’t trust anything he said and for good reason. Suddenly she gestured with her eyes towards a large stone plinth near the area where Ezraen had descended from. I saw it then, a small crystal like stone embedded in the face of the rock. It seemed to shimmer with a strange after image, like a mirage in the desert.

I slowly nodded my head at her when I looked back. We had to reach that rock, it had to have the piece that was taken from Sherrie.

Ezraen began tapping his foot and then snapped his fingers. I heard the shambling sounds of a host of grabbers walking into the room.

“I’m afraid I don’t have all day, or night, or whatever time it is in the real world. So I will ask again, stay here and try your hand and managing this place? Or I can have the grabbers disassemble you and maybe I can make something interesting with what remains. I always wanted to make a chimera but I wanted the heads to have more....sentience.” He cackled maniacally and I did not know how the hell we were going to get out of the situation.

Sherrie spoke up, surprising me.

“Wait, you can keep me here. Just let him go, I will stay, he was never supposed to be here. I lead him here to try and escape, it's my fault.” I looked back at her, shocked that she would suggest that now.

“Wait no, you don't mean that. You can’t stay here!” I blurted out.

“Sherrie looked back at me, pain and resolve mixing into a beautiful but tortured expression.

Ezraen chuckled. “Well I managed to find a way to keep you here after all, I almost regret that I won't be here to enjoy the company. Alright then, come up to the dais here with me, as for you.” He pointed at me. “You stay right there and don’t cause any fuss untill we are done.”

Sherrie was released from her prison and slowly walked up the incline to the stone on the dais overlooking the room. As she walked, she stumbled for a moment, and it looked like she had dropped something which landed only a few feet away from me. It was her chalk.

Soon she reached Ezraen and he took her hand.

“A wise choice my dear, now place your hand on the stone, it will take a bit more than last time. You may feel a draining sensation that will leave you flushed, like giving blood...but worse.” She held out her hand reluctantly and while Ezraen eyed the stone and began the strange ritual, Sherrie looked at me and then the chalk she had dropped. I saw her mouthing something to me, it looked like she was trying to say,

“Draw something now.”

I was not sure what to do, what could I draw? Then I had an idea. She could not escape with me yet, but maybe I could make a distraction that could allow us to escape. Ezraen began muttering some words and the stone changed color. The pressure in the room changed and a static charge seemed to linger in the air, I had no idea what was happening, but I knew I did not have much time. I inched closer to the fallen chalk and a grabber noticed me and moved to intercept, I managed to pretend to trip and fall. Then I inched forward and grabbed the chalk. I fell down on my face and lifted my head, pretending to watch the scene unfolding before me. The grabber stopped when it realized I was not running away.

Then while I was still down on the ground I wrote something that I hoped would be able to help and not get us killed. I wrote the word I had seen on the door before.

I did not write it backwards like on the door, I wrote the simple, frightful word correctly and hoped I had not just done something that would see us all killed,

I wrote, “D E M O N S”

Then I reached down below the writing to the handle that was on the ground now in the shape of a door. I opened it and madness emerged.

The strange energy in the air was sucked out immediately, and Ezraen knew something was wrong. The grabber nearest to me tried to seize me, but an amorphous shifting shadow burst from the door on the ground and swallowed it whole.

I shouted out, “Sherrie the stone!” She reacted instantly and wrenched her hand free from Ezraen, grasped the strange crystal from the stone and pried it free. There was a howl of rage from behind the mask of Ezraen and just as he was about to grab Sherrie again, the monstrous bulk of a horned demonic figure had leaped onto the dais and knocked him over.

I thought he might be dead, but I saw a brilliant flash of light and the demonic form of the creature who attacked him began to bubble, then eventually burst with a wet popping sound. Ezraen stood, covered in blood and visibly shaking with rage. Sherrie was rushing to get back to me, crystal in hand.

More demonic beasts emerged from the door and legions of grabbers and other stairs dwellers marched forth to meet them in a clash of nightmares come to life. We used the terrible battle as cover to flee and took off as quickly as we could. Ezraen burst into motion to pursue, but was assaulted again by more of the demonic cohort. I grimly suspected that they might be drawn to his power and looking to feed off whatever strange energy empowered him.

Some of the grabbers and blind beats tried to pursue us, but they were attacked in turn by more of the demonic entities breaking forth from the door. We had a chance, we had our distraction so we ran for our lives.

We fled out of the strange antechamber and the swirling mass of monstrous carnage. I had lost the chalk in the melee, but Sherrie pulled me along. Whatever it could do to help was not as important as getting as far away as possible just then.

We made it to the long halls and saw the way back. We burst through the door and continued, rushing down the strange, gilded glass steps back to the stairs. As we ran we heard more movement following us. Worse, bellow us there was a lumbering scraping sound that heralded more of the blind beasts. At the rate we were moving, they were bound to hear us and the cover of the demonic invasion was too far away to help us.

We slackened our pace and Sherrie put a finger on her lips. We stopped just in time to avoid a large figure dropping down onto the steps just a few feet away from us. We heard it sniffing the air and scraping the walls. We had to move, but if we tried it could bring more of them down upon us. I looked at Sherrie apologetically, and she shook her head, not knowing what I was going to do and not condoning it if she did.

I couldn't blame her, it was not smart, but we were desperate. I crouched low and took a few quiet but hurried steps towards the massive blind beast. Just as it regarded my footsteps and turned to face me, I struck. It attempted to bellow a warning, but I was already in the air, jumping out and extending my legs in a makeshift dropkick that sent the giant creature tumbling off the stairs into the abyss bellow. It screeched as it fell and the other ones seemed to converge on the falling monster bellow, instead of on our location. I landed hard on my side, but managed to keep from falling off when Sherrie grabbed me and kept me from slipping.

“This way.” She urged, as we rushed down the steps.

“There is an angle here, its close to where the door back to the room has shown up before. We just have to hope it will manifest here.” She said, with a hint of desperation in her tone.

“What if it doesn't?” I asked, despite not really wanting confirmation of the answer.

“Then we will be trapped, and he will find us...” She responded grimly.

We moved down a few more steps and she held out her hand,

“Wait! It's here!” She cried. We took a step back in tandem then forward and then back.

Then it was there, the door. I saw the safety of the room again, and we moved in unison toward it. Sherrie paused for a moment and held her breath. I took her hand and we moved to the threshold together. I crossed my fingers and we moved. It worked; she was able to step through. Yet just as we were almost in and ready to shut the door behind us, a terrible burst of energy erupted in the door frame that nearly burst my eardrums and caused me to fall, half in, half out of the door. 

I looked back in a daze and saw Ezraen, he was floating down the center of the stairs. He channeled torrents of a strange shimmering energy that pulsed through him and when I looked closer I saw his mask had fallen off in the attack. The withered and hideous visage I beheld was no longer human. He looked like a mummy, dry withered skin emaciated flesh and only that odd shimmering light burning in the shriveled sockets where his eyes had once been.

I tried to scramble in through the door but the strange energy held fast onto my leg.

He spoke, sounding distorted and less human than before,

“You two are not going anywhere. You have destroyed the only peace this nexus, maybe even this dimension has ever known. You let them in, they will be even worse. You will stay you will suffer for this act” He reached for us and was about to pull me into the vortex of lethal energy.

Then Sherrie rushed forward and threw the strange crystal she had recovered earlier onto the ground near me. Before I could react she stomped on it and a burst of force emerged from the act, along with the ressonating sounds of shattering stone. I couldent tell if it was just the crystal or the steps collapsing themselves but the effect was imediate, a blinding flash burst forth and Ezraen screamed and fell into the abyss. He powers leaving him just long enough for gravity to do the rest of the work. He cries rang out even as we rushed through the door and slammed it behind us.

We fell in a heap on the floor in my bedroom. We looked back at the door then each other. We started laughing, the tired semi hysterical laugh of people who had just survived an impossible situation.

Suddenly I realized she had shattered the stone. I touched her face and made sure she was really there with me. “The stone? How? Are you...” I mumbled in a daze.

She smiled, “I think whatever was stolen has come back. I can’t believe it, I made it out. We made it out.” She started to cry tears of joy and I found myself doing the same. I held her for a while we decompressed from the horror of our ordeal.

In the aftermath, we had a bit of explaining to do when we reconnected with our families. Sherrie’s family had thought her missing or dead for a long while and were overjoyed to see her again.

My parents thought I had gone missing too since my latest adventure into the stairs had seen two weeks go by in the real world, despite only feeling like a couple of days. When they had calmed down after seeing I was okay, I asked them many questions on what they knew about the stairs.

It was not much, but they each acknowledged that they had seen them before. I decided to move out of our old house since I did not like the notion of seeing the stairs again. They could be gone now, but I believe they still exist somewhere. Though wherever they truly are, I don't think I will ever know. When I think about them I shudder as I consider how the things haunting the endless spiral are more terrible than they ever were before.

Sherrie and I settled things down with our families and lives after a while. But our connection remained strong. We had saved each other and were still drawn to each other. It felt inevitable that we would end up together and soon we were moving in together to an apartment building downtown.

Its a small cozy place on the second floor. We managed to move in quickly and I think we will be happy here. Sherrie is waiting for me by the entrance with one last box. She smiles at me and I feel content. We walk in and I move towards the stairwell. She holds up a hand and I stop.

“Can we take the elevator? I know it's just one floor, but I think I've had enough stairs for a while.” She grins and I nod my head as she presses the button to call the elevator. She has a good point.
