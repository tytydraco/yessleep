A few months ago (yes I'm still thinking about it), my boyfriend and I were sleeping peacefully as usual when suddenly we woke up with a jolt because we heard a scream that sounded like a woman screaming for her life. My first reflex was to check the time because it was a Saturday, and we always go to bed very early, so I thought it might be a normal noise on the streets of the busy city we live in depending on the time. But I saw that it was exactly 3 AM, the devilâ€™s hour, so that added a layer of fear. The scream was incredibly loud at first, and it seemed to be moving farther away, as if the person screaming was on the move. I went to look out the window in my room, but I live in a condo tower, and I donâ€™t have a window that faces directly onto the busy street, so I didnâ€™t see anything. My boyfriend tried to calm me down and said it was probably nothing serious, so I tried to go back to sleep.

A few minutes later, we heard another scream, just as loud as the first one, but this time the scream was very close. So I jumped out of bed and my boyfriend did too (which stressed me out because Iâ€™m the true crime fan in the couple, so seeing him panic confirmed that I really had a reason to be scared now). We went into our living room where thereâ€™s a window that looks out onto the courtyard. Our building is shaped like an "L", so from this window, we could see the neighbors who live on the other side of the "L" (I hope thatâ€™s clear), and their lights were on. My boyfriend crouched down and looked out the window while I sat on the couch in a small ball, not wanting to be seen.

We heard another scream, and my boyfriend said, "Wtf, it's our neighbors, she opened the patio door and screamed outside, then closed the door but stayed in front, motionless." The neighbor in question is a woman in her twenties who lives with her boyfriend, and theyâ€™re both very laid-back. Sheâ€™s a shy person, and weâ€™ve never had any issues with them, so I was extremely surprised. I told my boyfriend to see if he could spot her boyfriend around, but he said no, she seemed to be alone. We tried to calm down and rationalize the situation, suspecting that maybe she was sleepwalking, but at the same time, I had my finger on the phone ready to call the police because thereâ€™s no way I was going to be the person in the true crime stories who didnâ€™t call the cops when it was needed. We stayed there for a few more minutes, subtly watching through the window, and once again, she opened the patio door, but this time she screamed, "STOPPPP AHHHHHH." Instantly, my boyfriend opened our patio door (it seemed like he did it out of reflex) and yelled, "HELLO???!!!!" Silence. Their lights went off. I told my boyfriend, "No, no, no, Iâ€™m calling the police," but he told me, "Wait, she really looks like sheâ€™s alone." We kept watching, and we saw her playing with her curtain in a very strange way. She was holding it from both sides and lifting it up; I canâ€™t really explain how, but it was just so nonchalant. Thatâ€™s when I became convinced she might be sleepwalking. After a few minutes of inactivity, we tried to go back to sleep.

The next day, I couldnâ€™t stop talking about it with my boyfriend and thinking about it, so I decided to call the police to make sure I wasnâ€™t making a mistake (better late than never, I guess). I explained the story to them and also mentioned that it could possibly just be someone sleepwalking, but since it was the first time it happened, it might be worth making a quick check up to make sure she was okay. Then I received another call from the officer on the way to ask more questions, and I gave them the building entrance code so I could let them in remotely. About thirty minutes later, I received a call from my front door, so I know the police came by, but I never got any updates, so unfortunately, I still have no idea what happened. ðŸ˜­

PS: I ran into the girl again, sheâ€™s safe and so is her boyfriend, but Iâ€™ve never dared to ask them what happened because weâ€™re not that close.

PPS: Since that night, nothing strange has happened... is it possible to sleepwalk only once in our life? I have no idea.
