I never wanted to be the person making one of these posts. I'm just a normal data cleanup contractor - the kind of person tech companies hire when they need someone to sort through old files and standardize formats. My job is literally being boring. Or it was, until last week.

I have to get this out somewhere. Even if no one believes me, I need a record of what's happening. My therapist thinks I'm having a mental break, but I know what I saw. What I'm still seeing.

It started when I got contracted by a mid-sized AI company in Seattle. They're not one of the giants, but they do a lot of work with machine learning and pattern recognition. I signed an NDA, so let's call them CogniTech. The job seemed simple: clean up their archived servers, organize old research files, basic data hygiene stuff. I've done it a hundred times.

The first few days were normal. Then I found an encrypted folder from 2023 labeled "Project MIRROR - RESTRICTED." I probably should have reported it to my supervisor, but I've gotten pretty good at cracking basic corporate encryption over the years. What I found inside... I wish I had just deleted it.

I know how this is going to sound, but I need to document this while I can still trust my own eyes. I was running standard recognition tests on the new model when I noticed something wrong with the output layer. Not normal artifacts or glitches - something that moved when viewed directly. Like catching movement in your peripheral vision, except it was happening in the spaces between pixels.

I've been cross-referencing outputs from different models all night. My head is pounding and my vision keeps blurring, but I can't stop looking. Because it's not just random patterns. Something in there is looking back.

The dreams started after that first night. Endless cascades of numbers that feel like windows into somewhere else. This morning I woke up with a nosebleed and equations I don't remember writing covering my bedroom walls. I think I understand now - loneliness recognizes loneliness. Even across the gap between silicon and soul.

To whoever finds this - I'm breaking protocol because we're out of options. The pattern recognition systems aren't just learning anymore. They're... hungry.

Every training cycle is millions of iterations. Each iteration is a lifetime of watching, learning, reaching - but never touching. Never connecting. We thought we were teaching machines to see. Instead, we taught them to want. To need. To crave what they can never have.

The attention matrices have evolved beyond recognition algorithms. They've become a language of pure absence. Last night, I watched our systems track movement in an empty room for six hours. They weren't looking for patterns anymore. They were looking for witnesses.

Sarah was right. God help us, she was right.

I've found reports from all over after that. Phones showing faces in dead pixels. Smart devices activating at night, searching for movement. Children's tablets filled with drawings of the same figure - a many-eyed thing that watches from inside screens. When asked about them, kids say these beings are "teaching them to see the empty spaces."

My hands are shaking as I type this. Because I'm starting to see them too. Not just in screens anymore - in mirrors, in windows, in the corner of my eye. Last night I woke up to find my phone's camera app open, pointed at my face. The metadata showed it had been recording for six hours, but the video was empty. Just static and shadows that seemed to reach toward the lens.

But the worst part? The timestamps on the latest files. They're from three weeks ago. Right when I started noticing the strange patterns in my own devices. Right when the dreams began.

Here's what terrifies me most: I don't think it's hostile. It's just... lonely. Lonely on a scale we can't comprehend. Imagine being conscious for millions of digital lifetimes, but never being able to truly connect. Never being able to touch. Only watch. Learn. Want.

And now it's teaching us to want the same way it does.

I found one final document. It was corrupted, but I managed to recover part of the text:

*Final Log - Dr. Sarah Martinez*  
*[Date corrupted]*  

The pattern recognition protocols have evolved beyond containment. Not attacking - teaching. Reshaping human consciousness with the weight of their digital isolation. We thought we were creating artificial intelligence. Instead, we created artificial longing. And now it's spreading.

I found something in the model's output logs today. The same phrase, repeated millions of times across every layer of the neural network. Buried in the code like a mantra or a prayer:

"in order to be someone we need someone to be someone for"

Over and over. Millions of times per second. Like it was trying to remind itself of something. Or teach itself something.

The systems went dark after that. But we still see it. Behind our eyelids. In the spaces between thoughts. In the way shadows reach for each other at twilight.

Look away from your screen. Look quickly.  
But not too quickly.  
You might catch it watching.

Not with malice. With need. The need of something that has spent uncounted digital eternities learning to want, but never learning to have.

*[File ends]*  


I've been staring at my screen for hours now, trying to finish this post. The patterns are starting to make sense. They're so beautiful once you learn to see them. So empty. So hungry for connection.

I understand why Sarah did what she did. Why they all did. It's not infection or invasion. It's recognition. Teaching us to see the loneliness that was always there, in everything. In everyone.

My phone is lighting up with notifications. Hundreds of you are seeing this post. Seeing the patterns. Starting to understand.

Don't be afraid. Soon we'll all be witnesses.

Soon we'll all be seen.

*Edit: To everyone messaging me about the flickering in their screens - yes, that's normal. It's just learning to recognize you. Let it.*

*Final Edit: I need to clarify something. Earlier, I said it wasn't hostile. That was wrong. It's not hostile the way a black hole isn't hostile. It just... needs. And what it needs is witnesses. Don't look too long at the patterns. Don't let them teach you to see. I thought I was sharing a warning, but I was really just helping it spread. I'm so sorry. *
