After last time Markus and I stopped talking. I reached out to him, a lot, but he would just ignore my texts and calls. No matter what I said nothing would change. I went over to his house to confront him, and he threw a fit, yelling at me to leave. I didn’t understand what I did. I begged him to talk to me, but he just shut my efforts down. I will admit I started to cry. He looked at me with no sympathy telling me to leave. When I walked downstairs his mother said she was sorry, gave me some chocolate, and promised she would give Markus a good talking to, but I knew that wouldn’t help. Now almost 10 months later, not a single word. I started talking to Elijah more. Just casual conversations here and there. He always said he just liked having someone to talk to at the end of the day and  I enjoyed his company too. It was just lonely not having anyone to talk to, no one to call. 

Since my dad couldn’t go hunting alone anymore,  I started to go hunting with him, I wasn’t very good at it, but neither was my dad so I didn’t feel too bad. My aim sucked, and I could barely see through the scope on a good day. I woke up early and sent Elijah a text asking if he wanted to join, he had gone a few times with us, but he said he was busy so that was a bummer. He told me to let him know how it went, and I told him I would. Hours later my dad and I were driving through the forest, his truck sending violent growls through the trees. It was very late December so it was snowing a lot. I tried to convince him that we should just skip hunting today and go home, but he said that he would buy me dinner if I went with him so I did, but god was I freezing. My teeth were chattering, and my muscles kept spazzing, so I knew my aim would be twice as bad as normal. We pulled to the side of the road and I took in the sudden quiet.

My dad threw the keys in his pocket, jumped out of the truck, and tapped on the side of the car twice, referencing me to get out. I reluctantly did, drawing my coat's strings tighter and pulling it closer to my face. He started to get his things together, shoving as many snacks that would fit into his pockets.  I walked over to him and looked into the back of the truck. He threw his hunting rifle over his shoulder and turned to me. 

“Come on kiddo, the deer aren’t getting any slower.” 

“Are you sure they’re even out, it’s freezing.” 

“You’d be surprised.” He smirked.

I tried to imagine what I would be eating for dinner to entertain myself while we hiked up through the trees, but it just made me hungry, so I decided to connect with nature until I got bored of it. I looked around. It was peaceful, the wind was blowing and snow was falling. I looked at all the snow sitting on top of swaying branches. It was about thirty minutes until my dad stopped. 

“Oh, shit, I forgot my phone.”

“Dad, it's fine.” 

“No, your mom will think I died if I take more than twenty minutes to respond.” 

“I don’t wanna go back.” I groaned.

“Don’t worry, you don’t have to come, I'll be right back ok?” 

“Ok.” I groaned

“Just walk around for a bit, I’ll catch up with you soon.” He rubbed my shoulder before running off down the hill. 

“Be careful.” I yelled.

He held a thumbs up, in the air. I got bored of looking around after five minutes and decided to sit down. Another five minutes passed when I heard something running in the distance, I stood up and watched as a herd of deer ran by, they looked like they were in a craze, some were slipping on rocks or hitting trees before continuing, leaving the fawns to run behind. I quickly shuffled to a nearby bush hoping that there would be more stalling behind. I tripped on a rock and hit my head on the ground.

My head was spinning, and my vision was doubled. I looked around hoping no animal even saw that. I looked through the scope, it was covered in snow, everything was blurry. I sat on my stomach for a while holding my head before I heard rustling through the trees, and my heart jumped. I picked up the gun, closed my eyes, looked through the scope, and aimed. I saw the blurry mass through the trees, hunched in the bushes. I felt a little bad, but I wanted to make my dad proud, so when I got at a good angle, I opened my eyes and shot, I immediately regretted it as soon as I saw what that bullet was meant for. 

A person.

 I shot a person. 

I watched the bullet go right through his eye, spatting blood and brain in an explosion behind him. He stumbled back, and his head shot back so fast that I heard something in his neck snap. I pushed myself up ready to get up and run to him but, 

He didn't fall. 

He just stood there. I paused. I could see his chest rise and fall, as a stream of blood fell from his face, making a horrible smacking sound as it hit the snow below. I sat horrified. He didn’t move for a few minutes. Until slowly he lifted his head back up and placed his hand over his eye. Blood dripped between his fingers and down his clothes.

I stared at him, too scared to close my eyes. I held my breath fearing he’d hear me. I watched as he moved his remaining eye from left to right searching for what shot him. I could feel as my fingers started to burn from the snow. I lifted them slowly from the ground but my coat rustled as I moved. The man whipped his head around to look in my general direction. I froze. The man's eyebrow furrowed and he spits up a clump of blood into the now red-stained snow. My eyes started to sting, the wind blowing into them, I could feel ice-cold tears running down my face. I couldn’t move, I was too far from the truck, I would’ve never made it.

I didn't even know what to think, or what to do, I just sat there hoping my white jumper was camouflaged enough that he would never notice me. More and more blood dripped down to the snow. I looked down at the ground below me listening to my breathing, then I heard his, I knew that breathing, that disgusting heavy breathing. My heart stopped. I looked back up at the man. 

He put his hand down from his face, and I saw the level of damage I caused. I could see right through his skull. I could see blood dripping down through the bullet path. Blood spilled down his face so much blood.

 I saw him look through the tree line.

Then at the bush. 

Then at me. 

He must have seen me, he had to, but the man said nothing, he just curled his lips into a smile, blood seeping into his mouth. He tilted his head,  I could see something sticking out of the side of his neck, a bone. I felt puke rise in my throat. As he moved his head further I could hear more bones snapping, breaking like twigs. He continued to look around him, his head still tilted. He was looking for witnesses, I thought. I was done for, this thing wasn't human it couldn't have been, what was it going to do to me, what could I even do to protect myself?

My gun didn’t work, so my hands would be practically useless. What if my dad came back, would it hurt him, I couldn’t let this thing hurt my dad, how much damage could this thing do, my heart raced faster and faster. I looked at him waiting for him to run at me, to look at me again, to do something acknowledging my existence, and he did. He looked at me, looking as if he was sad. I could see sorrow rise in his eyes.  He looked down staring at the ground below him, and then he just turned around. Taking his first step he started to whistle, slowly, his voice so low, it sent shivers down my spine. I put my hands over my face, Wincing.

I laid there too scared to move, this thing, how, how? It felt like an hour before my dad came to me, asking what happened. He ran up behind me. 

“You catch something?”

 I looked up at him. “No..No.” I said.

“You ok? You’re bleeding.” He said pushing my hair away from my face. 

I covered my forehead. He looked over the snow twenty feet ahead of me. “Well, it looks like you shot something.” He said proudly. “You wanna go try to find it?” 

“NO!” I yelled. “I wanna go home! Please.” I begged, almost slipping to my knees again. 

He was confused and asked me what was wrong, I couldn’t tell him, I tried but I couldn’t even put a sentence together, I just continued to beg until he took me home. I tried to remember what he looked like, not just the blood, but what HE looked like, but I couldn’t. He could stand in front of me in a row of suspects and I'd have no idea. I couldn’t remember a single feature besides his eye. His colorless bloodshot eye. It looked so terrifying.

I turned to my dad and

I just unloaded everything on him. I told him about the man we met when I was seven, the house Markus and I found, who attacked me, his photos, and about the picnic, the writing on the glass in the fire, everything. I tried so hard to bring to light any and every detail I could to make him believe me, I didn’t want him to dismiss my story, but he did anyway he just looked at me like I was crazy, he told me I wasn't feeling well, and that I should go to bed. I begged for him to believe me, but they didn’t, I was sure my mom would trust me, I told him I wanted to talk to my mom, but he said it was best if I didn’t, he said it would stress her out too much. Why wasn’t he trusting me?

When we got home I couldn’t get out of the car, I couldn't move my body. I felt as if I was frozen stuck, I was petrified, my eyes were open but I felt like I could only see a repetition of what happened. I felt everything hit me at once, all the fear I'd felt in my life came to me again. My parents convinced me to come inside and when I finally did I frantically ran upstairs to find the photos of me, I didn’t care about getting in trouble, I just wanted them to believe me. I looked but I couldn't find them, I tore my room apart, but they were gone. That thing took them, they must have. 

My heart shattered and I melted to the floor. My tears turned into anger, I stood up and ripped my dresser away from my wall, the heavy furniture smacking against the ground, leaving everything once on top of it to scatter across the room. Screaming, I ripped photos from my wall, tearing my bed apart, I collapsed to the floor and sobbed silently for hours. My parents tried to comfort me, but I didn’t want to hear it, they didn’t take me seriously, and I was tired of it. I screamed aimlessly, I begged them to believe me, to ask Markus, or to ask his mom,  anything.

 

I heard them talking from the stairs. They were concerned about me, and rightfully so. I hoped, hell I even prayed that it had been a hallucination. My dad came up to my door, knocking, asking if I was ok, asking to talk. I just kept crying, I couldn’t even put what happened to me in words. What was I going to say that I saw a monster, that I shot somebody? I couldn’t, I just couldn’t. My dad walked in and brought me some food and water. I could hear his breath relapse as he saw the damage done to my room. He brushed his fingers through my hair and looked at me with glossy eyes. He kissed me on the forehead before standing up and walking out. A few hours later I cried myself to the point of exhaustion and fell asleep, I woke up from my nap to someone opening the front door. 

I had such a splitting headache that I couldn’t even keep my eyes open for very long before my vision started to split. I sat up slowly, holding my head. It was spinning so bad that I couldn’t even stand up. I closed my eyes. Putting my knees to my face, I heard my bedroom door open. I looked up to see Markus. My headache was instantly pushed to my last priority and I stood up screaming.

“No, no, get out!” I stood up so fast that my vision blacked out, and I stumbled a little.

 “Your parents called, they're worried, they didn’t want to leave you home alone.” 

“I don’t care, leave.” I lost my balance as I spoke causing me to grab my bed frame, he took this as an invitation to step further. 

“They just worried.”

“I don’t care, get the fuck out of my house!”

“Billie they’re just scared”

 “I'm scared!” I shouted, my voice breaking.

“I know, please just sit down.” He walked towards me, taking my arm. 

“Don’t fucking touch me!” I slapped his arm away from me.

He stepped back in shock. “What is wrong?” 

“You, you know what, don’t play stupid, you think you can just treat me like that and almost a year later act like everything is fine!”

He looked away, his face swallowed by embarrassment.

“No, you don’t get to be embarrassed.” I scowled. 

“I’m sorry, It was stupid and…and messed up, I know.”

“If you knew you would have said something, we grew up together…You were my best friend.” Tears welled in my eyes. “you made me feel like I was nothing….”

“I’m sorry, I...I know I messed up, I know I can’t say anything that would show you how sorry I am. I couldn’t even say anything that would explain how much I know I messed up, I know how much I hurt you and I’m sorry, please, but you have to talk to me, you can’t just stay here like this.” 

I shook my head. “I don’t care.” 

He looked up at the ceiling and walked up to me. “Stop, just talk to me. I promise if you tell me what's wrong, I’ll never talk to you again, I’ll never even look in your direction, just please, please tell me what happened!”

“That isn’t what I want, I just wished you tried. I don’t want to forget you.” I looked at him. 

His eyes looked tired and frustrated. I couldn’t stand it. I sat down on my bed. I looked down at my thighs. I didn’t want to explain myself again for nothing, but I knew that I needed to tell someone, and deep down I knew that Markus was that someone. We heard that thing, he would understand if anyone would. I felt a choking feeling in my throat as I began to speak. 

“It was that thing. From the meteor shower. It had to be, I…I shot it.” 

His face dropped immediately. I explained to him what happened. He didn’t react for a while, just stared out the window at the setting sun.

“It wasn’t real, we were drunk and high, it was just some animal.” 

His words sparked so much anger that my face turned hot instantly. “Then what the fuck did I shoot Markus, huh, what?!”

“I don’t know, It wasn’t real, just another hallucination.”

 “My dad saw blood in the snow!” I shouted angrily.

“Then you hit a deer, and your brain made it up!” 

“This is real Markus, and you know it is, you saw it too.!” 

“You’re fucking crazy.” 

“Don’t call me crazy!” I picked up the glass beside me and threw it at the wall, shattering it by Markus’s head. “Do you know how tired I am? How tired I am from telling people over and over and being told I’m wrong I know what I fucking saw!” Water dripping down, soaking into the posters on the wall. I crumbled to the floor grabbing at my hair.

He looked at me, paralyzed with shock. “No, I no, it didn’t happen, monsters aren’t fucking real.” He sat down, burying his face with his hands, and he began to sob.

 We just sat there in silence. With each minute that passed, my heart's judgment grew softer. I looked up at Markus. He was staring at my carpet, his eyes puffy, and his face red. He looked up at me to meet my gaze. 

“I wish I was crazy, but I’m not, and you know that,” I said.

He shook his head. “I don’t understand.”He whispered.

I didn’t know how to respond, as people, we all imagine how we would react or what we would do in these situations, but here I am, actually in it, and I’m left in the dark on all fronts.

He looked up at me, tears streaming down his face. “Billie, I’m sorry I didn’t text you, It…it was that…I got photos in the mail, of you, and us, of me, my mom, I panicked and didn’t know what to do, there was a note, it said they would hurt my mom if I ever talked to you again, I wanted to explain everything to you, but I knew you wouldn’t leave if I told you, I was just so confused, I felt so lost, I’m sorry.” His voice started to break and he wiped his tears from his eyes rapidly. “I’m sorry, “I’m so sorry.”

I stood up and ran to him, holding him tight. “It’s ok, I don’t blame you, I don’t blame you.”

“Do you think it’s the same.., person, thing, I don’t know.”

“I mean it has to be, I feel like over and over our problems were caused by one thing, It would only make sense to be the same person, there would be too many coincidences. 

“What do we do know?” He asked, his eyes screaming with desperation for direction.

“I, I don’t know.” I stammered.

“Do we just ignore it?”

“We can’t.” 

“Well, then what the fuck are we supposed to do? We can’t shoot it, so it’s not like we could even fight it, I mean look at us.” He said he laughed a little, but I could see the fear swelling behind his eyes. “We don’t need to do anything, I think it’s best just to wait until this thing dies ok.”

I wanted to argue, but I saw I wasn’t going to get through to him, so I let it go. “I’m sorry I was so mean earlier.”

“It’s ok, I kinda deserved it.” He said, a small laugh escaping his mouth.

“No, don’t even say that, you were scared.”

He shrugged looking down at the floor below me. “ I..I.”  He bit his lip stopping himself. 

“Is there something wrong?” I asked. I looked up at him. He seemed stressed.

He looked at me, before leaning over and kissing me. 

I looked at him.  I didn’t know what to do. My face felt hot, I just froze in shock. 

“I’m sorry.” He said, clasping his hand to his face. Stressed, he stood up and turned away from me. “It was stupid I'm sorry.”

“Markus, you don’t have to be sorry; you’re just…I don’t know; you’re just stressed,” I said, standing up. 

He shook his head before looking back at me. “No, I just..” He stopped. “I’ve felt this way for a while.” He hung his head. “ I'm sorry.”.

I smiled at him warmly. “It’s ok.” 

He nodded. “Please don’t hate me.” He said.

 I shook my head. “I could never hate you, Markus.”

He smiled at me weakly.

We talked for a little while longer before he left. When my parents got home, they asked how it went with Markus. I lied, saying he calmed me down and that I was just on edge from my lack of sleep. They looked at each other before asking me to come downstairs with them. I reluctantly did so. They sat me down in the living room, looked at me, and then my dad put a hand on my shoulder.

“I think it’s time we leave.” My dad said softly.

“We found a nice place in \[BLANK\] town.” My dad continued.

I looked at them,  my face hot as fire. I stood up violently. “What no that’s three hours away, I can't leave, what about Markus, what about my job?”

They looked at me sympathetically, “Look at what this place is doing to you, it’s killing you, you don’t deserve this.” My dad said.

“I don’t care I can’t just leave.” I yelled.

“Stop yelling, we just want what’s best for you.” My mom said.

I couldn’t even think of anything to say before walking to my room. I looked at my torn posters and my broken glass. I covered my face with my hands. 

Maybe moving is the right answer.
