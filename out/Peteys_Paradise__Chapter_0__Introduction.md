The first visit’s excitement does not dull over time.

I remember my mother telling my younger sister, for the tenth time that day, that she would have to wait until she was a little older before it was her turn to go.

The youngest age group to ever receive tickets was 10. In the ten years that the highlight of our small town has been opened, there has constantly been what we call an “opening” once a month.

Wait, sorry…

I almost forgot to explain some basic things to you. It’s second nature to us at this point, but of course you wouldn’t know these things. I apologise if I repeat things here. I’m not feeling quite like myself today and I’m running out of time to write this.

If you want to be included in the “drawing”, (what we call it when we get a ticket), you simply download the app, verify your age, confirm your identity and wait. 

The night before an opening, we all eagerly stare at our phones, waiting. 

The streets had emptied, businesses closed early. You get the idea.

It was one such night. Our eyes flicked between the time and the app. No-one talked.
*
Ten seconds to go.

Five seconds.
*
My leg started shaking in a mixture of anticipation, nerves, excitement and hope.
*
Come on. Please. 
*
I heard the unmistakable fanfare which we were conditioned to almost drool at the sound of, like a Pavlov dog.

I held my breath and looked at my app.

I swore under my breath.

It wasn’t my turn.

It was my mother’s.

She cheered and answered the four questions on the app. In the morning, we waved her goodbye, telling her to have fun. 

She returned late that night, looking tired. Apparently, the experience was too intense for her this time, which she agreed was her own fault. She could have left.

Entry was free, you just needed a ticket and to answer the questions before the morning. You also had to agree to their sort of NDA privacy agreement, which was only a few paragraphs. The town’s population *had* stuck to the rules of this; don’t disclose your individual experience to not spoil it for others. 

You could, however, say which characters you had seen. We were fascinated by this so much that this spawned fan made trading cards - One card had no character but a weird rhyme scratched on it: ‘From grief they weave the rides we leave.’ I thought it was just creepy marketing. We also had  an ever changing escape room.

Some would take their cards to try to get the characters to sign them, but often found they experienced new characters instead.

It was like nothing we had experienced before. 

Our town was very isolated and so, apart from a couple of attractions that got stale quickly, we were hard up for entertainment. It was very remote and, therefore, most of us had never been outside of it.

That’s ok, we quite liked it like that. At last count; there were around 20, 000 residents, so plenty of different cultures, especially as every district was only accessible by a tunnel underneath a hundred foot tall concrete wall. Some people thought we should live differently, as often happens, way back when. 

One singular road wound from the top of the, almost impossibly tall, mountains that encased us to the town. A few thousand miles of dense forest all around the town separated the mountains from us.

We had crime, like any other place, but it was quite rare and spread out. I was 18 and in my lifetime in my district alone, there’d been 10 suicides, five murders, twenty disappearances and fifteen robberies. Some solved, some still puzzling to the community. 

One of the unique “selling” points of the attraction - a zoo/theme park called Petey’s Paradise, Petey’s for short, was that it would only invite a certain age group at a time.

This was because every time it had opened, it would have rides and an experience tailored to that age group and their answers to the questions. 

*Don’t like rollercoasters but still want to be scared?

Want to throw up on every ride?

Want a more gentle time, maybe with fair and free carnival games?

A mix of all of them?*

Petey’s Paradise catered to all tastes.

You always get some educational parts in between though. So you didn’t get too hyped up and have a heart attack or something. 

I mentioned the trading cards before. The characters. In order to keep the experience fresh, they would sometimes change the costumes, so you’d have a variety and not know which you were getting on your visit. 

A truly magical place. 

Another one of the things that the “parkgoers”, (those who had visited Petey’s), had said was that they had built it in a way where you could only see the gates of the entrance until you entered the park. Its location in the woods surely helped that mask. I say built but it pretty much just appeared, discovered by a camping family ten years ago.

The running theory was that they ran, or at least worked for, the company behind Petey’s, as they were new to The Town and vanished shortly after. 

Think of a famous household name known for a chain of attractions, but *stealthier*. 

I should have known.

In some ways, I guess I did.

Not that I could have done anything to stop it.

Not that I can now, either.

It was all a lie.

The worst thing is…what I write here won’t stop it. I’m running out of time to.

So why am I choosing now?

Because now I do see the truth and it disgusts me. 

I may have started writing with a small amount of false hope that I could help in some way; get some control. 

But false is all it is. It doesn’t matter. I don’t know where to start.

Oh, my name is Frank, by the way.

When I was 18, it was my turn. 

I got my ticket. 


Edited for a small clue - check the cards!
