The church reaches out when a demon slips past the warded walls; the cartel reaches out when something older, hungrier, emerges from shadows even demons avoid. I knew both kinds of calls all too well. That night, I was drunk on cheap mezcal, drowning in prayers I no longer believed in, trading a silver rosary for enough pesos to buy my daughter's medicine. The room reeked of mildew, sweat, and grief I had grown used to. Her cough throbbed in my memory, each one a countdown, while money disappeared faster than her breath. Every peso I earned went into medicine that barely kept her alive, and I was running out of both.

Then the phone rang.

"Padre Luzferante," the voice said, smooth and merciless. "There's a house in Sonora. A girl inside. You cleanse it… or your daughter dies. And if she dies, you die next. Do it right, and we'll pay you more than you've ever seen, more than any priest ever touches. It'll be enough to keep your daughter alive for years."

I laughed, a dry, cracked sound. I had no faith left, only hunger and debt and the faintest trace of stubborn pride. Yet I went. The place was in Sonora. The house was alive. Walls that whispered, floors that quivered under my weight. Shadows lingered in corners where no light fell. Something was there. Something that had always been there. Something that waited.

"Padre," the cartel leader said, "cleanse it. Save her. Or your daughter dies. And ours…" He nodded toward a pale girl curled in the corner. "Dies anyway."

I began the exorcism with all the tools I had, prayers, holy water, incense, Latin phrases rolling like chains around the thing that hungered in that place. I screamed the old words as the shadows twisted and pressed against me, clawing at my sleeves, my hair, my skin. The girl cried, the walls moaned, and the air thickened like water in a storm.

Hours passed. My voice was raw, my hands trembling. I feared I would fail, that all the prayers, all the rituals, had been in vain. Then, silence fell. Perfect. The girl's eyes opened, clear, alive. Relief washed over me. I had done it. I had saved her. The cartel's men nodded, sliding a thick envelope across the table. Pesos, enough to cover her medicine for years. I took it without a word, shaking, believing, if only for a moment, that the nightmare was over. 

I went home, thinking it truly was.

Weeks passed. The city went on as if nothing had happened, cars moving, vendors shouting, people laughing in the streets, but I felt like I was rotting from the inside out. Not my skin. My mind. It started small. A slip in memory. A word that vanished before I could say it. A thought that wasn't mine but felt like it belonged to me anyway. Then more came. Flashes of rooms I'd never been in. Faces I'd never seen looking directly at me. Moments that didn't exist, but I remembered them all the same.

Every time I passed a mirror, my reflection seemed a second too slow, like it needed permission to move. The shape was mine, but the eyes didn't match. Too distant. Too alert. Too aware of things I didn't want to know. I wasn't tearing at my body, no. My body was fine. But my mind was cracking open like an egg under a boot. Thoughts spiraled. Voices overlapped. Silence hurt more than noise. I prayed in latin the way I'd been trained to since seminary, but the words came out empty, like I was reciting a language I'd never understood. I whispered my daughter's name again and again, hoping the sound of it would anchor me.

It didn't.

I stopped sleeping. Every time I closed my eyes, something else moved behind them. My hands twitched at night, my fingers clenching without my permission. I woke to my nails digging into my palms or clawing at the wall beside my bed. The whispers grew louder, no longer passing thoughts but full sentences curling around my mind.

"Padre... you promised. Padre... pay. Padre..."

I covered my ears, but it didn't matter. The voice wasn't coming from the outside. It lived underneath my thoughts, speaking with my breath. One morning, I looked in the mirror and didn't recognize the man staring back. Not because he was disfigured, but because he didn't feel like me. He blinked at the wrong time. His breathing didn't match mine. The shadows of Sonora hadn't followed my body home, they had crawled inside my head and shut the door behind them.

Then I heard it.

"Padre...?"

I froze. It wasn't a whisper in my head this time. It came from the room. Soft. Careful. A voice trying not to wake something else up. My first thought was my daughter. My second thought was the cartel girl. My third was panic, because the voice didn't sound like either of them. It sounded like someone trying on their voices like clothing. I pressed my hands to my face, to my jaw, trying to feel something solid, something real. My palms were cold. My skin felt wrong beneath them, numb in some places, burning in others.

A knock at the door. Then again.

"Padre...?" 

Every muscle in my body tightened. I moved toward the door slowly, unsteady, my legs shaking like they belonged to someone learning how to walk for the first time. My chest felt tight, like something was pressing its hand inside my ribs.

"Padre...?" 

The thing in my head pushed against my thoughts, amused, whispering without sound. It filled the gaps in my memory, the empty corners of my mind, as if it had been waiting for this moment. And suddenly I understood, whatever hunger it had, whatever need it carried, it wasn't going to end. Not today. Not tomorrow. It had rooted itself in me, patient and permanent.

On the other side of the door was someone living. Someone real. Someone who would see exactly what I had become. And I had no way to warn them. I had saved the cartel girl's life. But piece by piece, I had lost mine.

Then I heard another voice, closer than the door, closer than the room, impossibly close, right behind me.

"Pa...?" 

I turned, and she was there.

Something about her was wrong. Empty. Still. Too still. Like a photograph pretending to breathe. My stomach twisted so hard I nearly dropped to my knees. My hands shook uncontrollably. Every instinct in me screamed to run, but another part, something small, desperate, human, wanted to reach out to her.

I didn't know if she was my daughter. I didn't know if she was real. I didn't know if she was the thing from the house wearing her face like skin. But I wanted to reach her anyway. God help me, I wanted to.

I don't know how long I can keep this going.
