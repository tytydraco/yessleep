There were many advantages to being the rich kids in town. We were envied and never had to worry about running out of designers, and best of all, we got to go on exotic holidays abroad. It was our first time going alone though. Me, Edward, Natalie and Jason had just turned eighteen so our parents had allowed us to go on a holiday in Serbia alone for summer break. Luckily for us,though she wasn't fluent, Natalie knew Serbian fairly well because she took classes.

When we arrived, walking down the plane, Jason pointed at a sign right next to the plane that said "Dobrodošli u Srbiju"

"What does that say?"

"Welcome to Serbia", Natalie translated.

We went into the hotel but apparently Edward made a mistake when booking and booked the wrong hotel. We were re directed to where he booked us in because the hotel we were supposed to stay at was to full to take us.

 "Bro.. you're actually such as a dumbass", Jason snorted.

"Whatever," Edward rolled his eyes.

We arrived at the new hotel, which was old, eerie and too secluded. The first thing the receptionist said to us before we even spoke to her was: "If she stops dancing you better start running."

"Sorry...?," I said looking at the others who shrugged in unison.

Jason made a "she's crazy" gesture with his hand.

Just then another woman walked in.

 "Sorry, ignore her, Lyra is feeling a bit ill today," she said patting her on the shoulder.

"Here's the key. There's only one room available, sorry. By the way, if you hear any music coming from outside, don't look out the window. Ignore anything unusual."

"Oke-okey?," I said uncertainly taking the key from her.

"What was that about?," Natalie asked as we went into our room.

Edward shook his head.

"Just a pair of crazy bitches."

We couldn't go to sleep because of jet lag, so we stayed up playing jenga for a while. Jason was clearly sabotaging everyone By 'accidentally' knocking his arm against anyone who was pulling out a block, but that made it all the more fun. It was around past 2 or 3 am when the music started. Soft at first then loud, going from melodic to disturbing real quick.

"What the fuck?," Edward said standing up and opening the curtains to look outside.

We all gathered around to see. I didnt expect there to be anything or anyone there, but there was a seemingly insane woman, dancing like a maniac in the middle of the street. She started singing, high pitched and inhumane.

"Pleši, pleši dok ne poludiš, poludiš, poludiš!"

The words kept repeating like a mantra, over and over. I shuddered, covering my ears as it got louder, making me suddenly feel dizzy.

"What the fuck does that mean?! Why is she repeating it?," Edward shouted, taking a step back in horror.

"It means "Dance,dance until you go mad,mad,mad," Natalie translated looking lost and unbalanced as she steadied herself.

I had forgotten she took lessons in Serbian from her language tutor.

Suddenly I began to feel a strong urge to copy her movements, follow along with her choreography as I continued watching her. It was like I was transfixed. Then...she stopped. She stopped moving. And slowly, deliberately turned around and stared right at us.

"Oh shit!," Jason yelled,quickly stumbling forwards and closing the curtains.

But she had clearly already seen us. It was like she was actually staring through our souls. And then I suddenly remembered the receptionists words. I felt a chill run down my spine. What did it mean ?

"Guys don't freak out! It's just a insane psycho that escaped a mental asylum", Edward said firmly.

"But...don't you remember what the receptionist said...?," Natalie said in a wisper, thinking the same as me.

"You know what? Now that I think about it... maybe she WAS referring to that crazy lady when she said that!," Jason said snapping his fingers.

"That's ridiculous ! No, this whole thing is fucking ridiculous, we need to just get the fuck out of here!," Edward said losing his cool.

" Edward we can't just-"

But he was already storming out the door When-

TAP.TAP TAP. TAP.

"What the fucking hell?!," I hissed whipping around like a lasso. Someone was knocking at our window.

"Shit shit shit, is it her?!" Natalie said panicking.

"Hell no! How would she get all the way up to our window?! What is she, a ghost?," Jason snapped.

"Let's just get the actual hell out of here!" Edward snapped and we followed him down the stairs.

But when we got downstairs there was no one there. The receptionist was gone, so we didn't bother to check out, we just ran. As we did, I felt the music in my head again, getting closer and closer, louder. But apparently I was the only one hearing it.

" you're imagining it Marissa, it's just in your head," Edward said as we sprinted faster.

Was I going mad too? Why did I feel that strong urge to dance again?

We arrived at a motel, a crowded normal seeming one, and stayed for the night. In the morning we were so traumatized we just decided to go home.

As we got of the plane on our flight back, I felt like the surroundings were familiar, but in a strange way. It didn't feel like we were home. But as we walked past the sign "Dobrodošli u Srbiju" I realized.

"Guys...weren't not in England."

And then I heard it. Whispered in my ears over and over again, loud and clear, as I began to dance, uncontrollably dance, as I felt my mind succumb to insanity. And then it dawned on me. It was me that was saying it now.

"Pleši, pleši dok ne poludiš, poludiš, poludiš!"
