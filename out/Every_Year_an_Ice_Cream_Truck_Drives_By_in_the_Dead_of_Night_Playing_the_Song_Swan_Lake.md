I live in a small Mormon town in Utah. We live in a pretty backwoods neighborhood in a tightly knit community, everyone kinda knowing each other in the ward. 

Ever since I was 12 there has been a strange phenomenon of an ice cream van driving around at about 2 in the morning on February 15th for a couple of years now. The first time this happened, everyone thought it was a dream, reporting a song playing in the distance outside their homes. It kind of caused a mass panic at church the next day, everyone immediately drawing the conclusion that he was obviously a satanic child predator trying to lure kids out in the night. He never showed at any other day besides that one 

Almost exactly a year later… it happened again. I was in bed, unable to sleep, probably secretly playing Mario brothers under my sheets. Deep into the night I heard a distant chiptune song start playing from outside my window.

This is the song used, tuned a bit differently and a tad slower. 

Anyway, as soon as I heard it my blood ran cold and I was paralyzed in fear, probably from all the nasty rumors I’ve heard at the playground exactly a year ago. I woke up and ran to my mom’s room and told her that the ice cream truck was back. Me and my whole family looked out the window as the van drove by, slowly and deliberately, seemingly waiting for kids to arrive. A couple minutes pass, the van still now at the end of our neighborhood’s entrance. 

My parents took all of us to their room, albeit not very comfortable in the same bed but we were all so spooked that it was 10x better than the paranoia that a mysterious ice cream man would snatch us out of our beds. Something to the same effect happened just like the year before. Mothers panicking, police being called, and fathers loading their rifles. Everyone was panicking, even at school everyone knew what was happening even if only a fraction of us lived in that neighborhood. Rumors sparked of a satanic cult member or a serial murderer and even the rumor of a killer clown driving an ice cream van.

The next year our whole neighborhood was prepared to basically lynch this man. Dads waited outside their house waiting for him on the 15th of February, but this time he didn’t show. The hours slowly went by and people started to go inside. But at about 5:30 that morning he showed, this time not on our street, but we heard that chilling version of Swan Lake from a distance, quickly this time, only for about 20 seconds.

For a couple of years, he didn’t show up. This story kind of faded from public memory, but last year, on February 15th, at 2:00 AM, a song slowly crept up to our neighborhood’s ears. As you might have guessed, it was this haunting version of Tchaikovsky’s Swan Lake. This time, funnily enough, one of our neighbors notorious for being a bit of a Karen soccer mom opened the door and started running down the street to try to confront this man. She called the police but the truck just drove fastly away and immediately turned off the music box. Police arrived and the given description of the driver is what really spooked me. She described the driver as looking like a child. She said he was wearing suit and tie, and even said and even added that there was a bloody pentagram on his back, but personally I didn’t believe that. It’s just the description of a childlike figure driving an ice cream van in the dead of night which chilled me to my core.

Everyone was in a panic again. Facebook posts were detailing plans of catching this man by laying down hoses with nails attached and even asking police officers for their help…

This year, he showed up. Not on our street though. He was in the woods, not even in a van, just the music box echoing through the trees…


To this day I haven’t a clue on this man’s intentions. Maybe he truly was trying to lure kids out of their house in the night and snatch them with their parents still asleep. This is actually a true story, this has been a phenomenon in our neighborhood. There are only 2 ice cream truck vendors in our city, none of them owning a music box programmed with Swan Lake. Next year I will update you guys on whether he returns.
