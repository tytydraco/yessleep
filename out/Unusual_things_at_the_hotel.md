[The silence of the the radio](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/9HbW92n0yr) part 1

After what happened I decided my safest option would be staying at a hotel, I drove to the nearest hotel and I went to the counter. Behind the counter was a young man with blonde hair and blue eyes . 

I checked his name tag and his name is William.

I started the conversation "hey, do you have any rooms that are available?" 

"Of course we do!" He happily replied,he was quite jumpy in his response.  

"But you will have to wait some time  until we can give you the keys to the room" 

"Why?" I replied. 

He looked at his computer then he looked to me then he started speaking"Well first we have to check if the room is clean and then check if electricity works just fine. Since we don't want for you to have any problems that will last for about 15 minutes" 

My hands were on the counter,i looked behind the rows of keys,he picked up a phone and called someone, I waited until he finished the conversation then i decided to ask him"How old are you and when did you start working?"

He was a bit startled by my questions but he answered quickly "I'm 21 years old and I started working here 3 months ago! I spoke on the phone, in 15 minutes I will give you the key to your room" 

I stared at the floor, then after 5 seconds of silence I decided to ask him one more question "anything unusual happening in this hotel?" 

I looked up at him and saw that his face was serious "there isn't anything unusual that happened or that is happening in this hotel" 

I didn't say anything and I just grabbed my bags and sat on a chair. 

I waited and after 15 minutes I saw him getting nervous and after 5 more minutes he called and had a conversation. 

After 2 minutes of talking he put the phone down and yelled out to me "I am sorry but you will have to wait at least 10 more minutes until your room is ready" 

"What is wrong?" I replied 

"One of the guests attacked our workers, but there were 2 more workers nearby so they manage to subdue the attacker. The police has been called" 

I didn't say anything and after 5 minutes 2 policemen arrived in the hotel and I saw them dragging out a man out of the hotel.

The worker behind the counter spoke loudly "your room is ready!" 

I got up and grabbed my backpack and bag and I took the key that he laid on counter, a man in red hotel clothing came near me and grabbed my bag. 

We went into the elevator and then we walked to my room, numbered 36. 

The worker put my bag down and I gave him a 10 dollar tip. 

I grabbed my bag and threw it on the chair, I then closed the door and locked the door. 

I put my backpack on the floor and I sat on the bed. 

I thought about what happened, so I pulled out my radio out of my bag and put on the station 101,there was no sound.

I turned off the radio and I pulled out duct tape,I went to the door and placed the duct tape on the peeping hole.

I made the duct tape loose so that there was no sound when I pulled the duct tape back to see through the peeping hole.

The day was calm and the hotel staff brought food for me. 

When the night came as I was about to shower I heard tapping on the other side of the wall, I placed my ear near the bathroom wall and on the other side I heard someone tapping with  their finger.

I checked the bathroom for any holes or camera and I found nothing. I washed myself and when I was putting the towel on myself I still heard the tapping.

I went to my bag and I pulled out my clothes and I put them on, then I heard three knocks on the door,I silently walked over to the door and pulled over the duct tape.

There was no one in the hallway. 

I felt fear wash over me,I put the duct tape on the peeping hole, I then went to bed, hoping that i am safe.

I heard knocking again but I ignored the knocking and in the morning when I opened the door I saw on the ground a iron tray which had food,I picked up the food and locked the door. 

In the room that was next to mine I heard furniture moving.

I wasn't hungry so I placed the food tray on the desk. I then felt anxious,I checked the room for any hidden holes for peepers or camera but I found nothing.

When I pulled the wardrobe from the wall I saw a giant vertical cut on the wallpaper. 

I pulled the wallpaper off and saw a note in the hole,I pulled out the note and I started reading. 


"I hope you find this note as soon as possible, always check if your door is locked,as long as you have locked your door you will be safe. If you find anything unusual such as a tray of food always check with the hotel staff if they placed the tray of food for you, If they didn't then don't eat the food and don't drink the water from water bottles or glasses,they could be poisoned. If you hear knocking on your door and see no-one then don't open your door. 

Always look at the details,the name tags. The clothes anyone wears,their facial features. Always look at your surroundings. 

Once you read this letter go to the abandoned building near the gas station that is on the other side of the street. In the basement you will find a man selling guns and ammunition. 

Buy a pistol from him and 2 magazines. 

Then go to the gas station and say you are there for electricity check up. After the clerk let's you in the basement you will find a note there. Leave the pistol and ammo where the place of the note was."

I checked if my door was locked, my door is locked. 

I grabbed 200 dollars and I brought the tray of food Infront of William. 

"Did any of the hotel staff leave a tray of food this morning?" I asked William 

"No-one is supposed to bring you a tray of food in the morning, we only do that during the evening"  William responded, worried. 
.
"Check if the food is poisoned" I told him. 

I then went to the abandoned building and found the man who sold weapons in the basement. He has gray moustache and wore a  hat. 

We didn't speak much but i managed to buy the pistol and the ammunitionfor 40 dollars. 

I then went to the gas station and told the clerk that I have come to check the electricity. 


Surprisingly he didn't question me and he let me in the basement.

When I entered the basement I saw a loose painting, and after I pulled out the painting I saw a circular hole in the wall with a note. 

I picked up the note and started reading 

"Look carefully the faces of the employees, always be alarmed. When you leave the pistol and the magazines in the wall put the picture back in the wall and go to the hotel. In half an hour 3 men will come into the gas station and pull a gun on the gas station worker, the gas station worker will kill them. The gun shots will be heard even in the hotel, you will have enough time to go on the second floor toilet room to find the next note." 

I placed the firearm and the magazines in the hole and and placed the painting back on the wall, but I made the painting a little bent towards one side. 

Then I went to the gas station clerk and told him that the electricity was fine.

I then went to the hotel and William approached me alarmed  "where did you find this tray of food?" He spoke in a rushed tone. 

"Infront of my hotel room door" I replied 

"When?" William asked 

"This morning" I replied 

"Did you know" William swallowed his spit,his eyes blinked wildly "that the food in that tray was poisoned?" 

"The food is poisoned? Who could have done that?" I said

William said "soon we will call the cops will come and we will look at the video recordings to see who did that" 

I said to William "someone on the room next to my wall kept hitting the wall with his finger, while someone was knocking on my door yesterday, I don't know who knocked since I didn't see anyone. Also the furniture in the roo. next to my bedroom was getting pushed around" 

"What?" William replied,clearly confused by my words "you do know that you are the only one who bought a room in the third floor where your room is located? I will call the cops now." 

As soon as he went to call the cops I started walking towards the second floor and on the second floor I saw a hotel employee approach me and speak to me 

"Hey, are you the resident in the room 36? You should later this day leave your door unlocked so that the staff can enter and bring you food" 

I stared at him, I didn't make any facial expression or say anything, but I clearly noticed that his left eye was noticeably larger than the other eye and that his left arm is slightly longer than his right arm, he didn't have any eyebrows and. his left foot also is clearly broken but he walked completely normal when he approached me.

I have to be honest,I was scared,my heart was beating fast and when I spoke I felt as if I would let out a high pitch yelp.

"Where is the hotel snack machine? I want to buy some snacks to eat" 

The hotel employee said "down at the entrance" 

I then went towards the stairs and when I looked back behind the wall I saw the hotel room employee click the elevator button, when the elevator doors opened I turned and went towards the toilet room. 

I entered one of the stalls and saw that behind the toilet seat there is a note. 

I picked up the note and started to read 

"You saw the employee with one eye larger than the other? If you did the next time he sees you he will attack you, if you placed the pistol behind the painting then when the gas store worker starts shooting then the hotel employee won't attack you but will start running away, when he does that then go and grab all your stuff and run away from the hotel and travel a decent distance between you and the hotel so you can be safe. In the room next to yours the monsters have started to dig a hole into your room, they plan to kill you when they make a hole into your room, the next note will be found in a road phone box" 

I put the note in my pocket and I ran to my room and gathered all my things, I already paid  the hotel worker. 

When I was on the first floor I saw the hotel room employee with the broken leg and just when he saw me gunshot rang out and the hotel room employee started running away. 

When I came to the hotel entrance I saw the cops were already in the gas station,I quickly walked over to my car and I started driving to get to the phone box as quick as possible.
