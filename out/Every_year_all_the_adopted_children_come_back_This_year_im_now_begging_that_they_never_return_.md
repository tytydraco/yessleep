That was the first question that edged into all of our minds.











Harlow’s Institute for Orphans was settled West Yorkshire, in Marsden. A beautiful countryside and villages filled with warm, bustling people. 






Then there’s the orphanage.







The old building had a soul of it’s own - one that was bright and innocent, the air was indulging to breathe in. Now it’s settled on the large grass field, remote from any civilians for at least half an hour away.



The archaic walls surrounded the entire building, they stood upright as it displayed a gloomy, chilling shadow that watched the mornings pass in silence. 







The black metal gate guarded the entrance of Harlow’s Institute, declining any unwanted visitors that stumbled across the building. The gate only parted open when there was a family that wanted to take onboard a child of their own, but until then it will stay locked.








And it has been locked for a very long time.









Every child in the orphanage had to dress to a standard, walk properly, and not talk back to any adult. Our caretakers didn’t tolerate any complains or questions. And it was highly unusual for any older child to ask the common question about when they were going to be adopted.








I grew up with many children, some which have started their new lives in the city or ran off to another country, part of me wished to live in a grand home with my own bedroom and bathroom - not having to share it with other kids. But the other part of me wanted to take my closest friends and we could all live together and not wake up smelling the damp air that mingled over our heads.








Like I said at the start.








Why them?







Our caretakers always threatened each child with the same phrase;







“If you want to be adopted, don’t misbehave”






That was the only thing that kept each of us sane as the days stretched out, our innocent faces morphing into a rebellious teenage smirk. We were the only teens left and I hope we aren’t the last. 







Then that day came along.







Roman Carter sprung into our bedroom as he practically dragged me out of my slumber as my body softly hit the ground - I was lucky I snagged the bottom bunk. He was shouting for me to wake up as he climbed on the ladder to reach Malinda who woke up in fight or flight response.



Roman shot down the ladder as Malinda followed afterwards, a look of confusion and anger plastered across her face. I couldn’t help but yell at him for waking us up like that, after all it was a Saturday and we can sleep in until 10:00AM.







“You—You guys have to come downstairs…I’m fucking serious…” He added as Malinda rose one of her eyebrows up with a look of rage. In that moment, I could already tell that something was horribly wrong. Roman’s eyes pleaded with ours, his light brown curls resting next to his cheeks.






Malinda hesitated for a second until she stated,






“Roman…what is going on.. you look like you saw a ghost.” She chuckled, her eyes looking upon the teenage boy that trembled in fear.







“V-valerie…Malinda.. follow me..” And with that, we both followed Roman down the long damp hallway towards the concrete stairs that seemed to drag on for ages.





It was silent.








Too silent.









We made our way past the younger children’s room, the steps creaking and groaning, the only noise that filled my ears as my mind raced in confusion.









The last steps, we found ourselves in the Hall. A large dingy room filled with three wooden long tables and chairs for each child and adult.







Heaps and heaps of eyes and tiny faces fluttered back at us in curiosity. I felt myself stumbling back on a wooden chair, I spotted the groups of strangers that thanked our caretakers, shaking their hands with tears brimming their eyes.







That was when I felt a pit of nausea bubble inside of me.








I peered at Malinda and Roman whose eyes were drawn on mine. 








Silence.








Everyone clasped their hands together as the families trotted out of the hall with their adopted teenagers - faces beamed with joy and surprise.







I couldn’t feel any of those emotions. I know Roman and Malinda felt the same way.






Call me jealous or arrogant. But I just did not understand.







You see, every child that ever lived here didn’t mind that one of us will be adopted soon enough, in fact we always told each other how thrilled we would be if that special day comes. 








The caretakers will never truly comprehend what each of us that live here really feel, when it comes to them.






“Jackson Hills, Logan Reed, Norman Porter, and twins, Inessa and Iliana Grove, are blessed by new families! Please children, settle your chattering and hooray’s, this is an honour and we shall all say thank you.” Mrs Powell, the head of the caretakers exclaimed, as she followed the families and teenagers out the orphanage - the loud high pitched voices of kids that thanked the strangers that waved happily back. 






Then they were gone.





And we found ourselves seated at our assigned table which was filled with stale scrambled eggs, toast and water. Our table was for the older children, but it was just the three of us now.







“I really thought I was gonna leave this dump…” trailed Malinda as she tucked a strand of blonde hair behind her ears.








“I don’t get it.. out of all the children Mrs Powell recommended, she chose them..” Sneered Roman, as he avoided eye contact with anyone else but us.









“You saw their faces…it-it was like they were…happy” I stuttered, tossing my egg around my plate.










“How else would they feel if they got adopted!” Hannah chimed. The small eight year old stood next to Roman who smiled back at her.









“Hannah we talked about this…-“








“Yeah yeah.. don’t ears-drop in your talks but I know it’s a top secret mission to do with the freaks.!” Hannah excitedly giggled, her two brown plaits on either side of her shoulder bouncing as she jumped up and down - it only stopped when Roman clasped his hand around her mouth and we all shushed Hannah quickly.








“Who taught you that word…?” I asked, Malinda smirking as Hannah pointed to Roman.








But Roman was right, they were freaks, and I will tell you how.










Jackson Hills was a troubled kid, always pestering the smaller children by taunting them, taking their things and placing it in his drawer, some older kids before us said that his parents did very bad things to Jackson and that was why all the caretakers never allowed him to be alone with any small child. I always knew Roman had this rage against him, he never wanted to be in any room with Jackson even if there was the caretakers or just me and Malinda - he couldn’t stand the thought or see him, if he did. Well he said it himself, he will beat the shit out of Jackson, until his body was unrecognisable.







 
The twin girls, Inessa and Iliana Grove who never separated from each other, even if we were taking a test or showers before bed they would never leave. During free time, they would always carry their red rubbered ball and throw it down and catch it back up, then repeat the process until the caretakers ordered us back into our classrooms.  








When we were ten, there used to be a cat in the orphanage that everyone looked after, then there was a day when it went missing and the caretakers found the cat’s body parts stuffed under Logan Reed’s bed. None of us had to look after any animal again, soon the orphanage was filled with social workers that came to check up on him, the only response to their questions was a wicked smile that seemed to never leave Logan Reed’s face, throughout the interviews. 








Then there was the night fight between two boys in their rooms, Norman Porter was there, standing upright, wide awake staring at the two children who punched and wrestled each other. The caretakers were enraged because one of the boys had a broken nose and it was an uncommon situation. But for us? We couldn’t help but understand why he was there. 




Norman Porter was a very quiet person who rarely spoke to anyone but more or less himself. 









The confining feeling that each of us felt soon vanished after they left, I would always sigh a relief every morning I woke up. However, if i ever saw myself walking down the hallways where there isn’t a child in sight or lying in bed hoping my eyes would drift off,  I could not shake the feeling like I was being watched all the time. Although the heavy weight lifted itself off me, I always knew that I was not entirely alone.





Months passed by until they returned back.






I remember the look on every child’s face when they stood at the doorway holding their belongings and walking silently to their rooms on our floor. I trembled in anger and most of all fear. Each family privately talked to Mrs Powell before they left.







Then we were brought down into the dining room again, everyone’s focus on the new families that wanted to take onboard the freaks. It had only been three months of hell with them before they got adopted. 







The smaller children became less energetic. Stopped playing with their toys, or chasing each other in the halls, instead there would be nights where I found myself listening to screams of despair and constant cries in their beds, yelling at the caretakers that ‘Jackson keeps on standing over them.’ Another incident, where a boy named Kaiden swore he could hear whispering coming from the bathroom, when he looked he found seven year old Daria facing the mirror, pale faced, repeating words he couldn’t fully understand. 







When Me and Roman questioned him the other day what the first letter of what Daria might of said, he coldly replied.








“It wasn’t English.”







The orphanage became uncomfortable to live in, i’ve never experienced such abnormal behaviour from any child -  but all these circumstances might of proved it wrong.








The younger children slamming their heads on the walls, ten year old boys wetting their beds even after claiming that they haven’t peed their beds since they were five. No one seemed to chat with one another, breakfast, lunch, dinner was silent. Too silent. 









There was one night where I was in the dining room with no memory of walking there, Malinda found me.








“You were chanting some weird things, Val, I have it on record.” She handed me her phone during free time, and she was right - I was just standing in the dark groaning words that I never knew.









“I-i don’t get it..ever since they left, all this creepy shit keeps happening. You-you think this is what happens after we get adop—“








Dysphoria transfixed my body in place, consuming every inch of movement with a sickly, cold grasp. I couldn’t move. The bloodcurtling scream echoed the dead walls of the orphanage - it sounded as if it was multiple children at once but my brain was a blur, desperately wondering if it was even human at all.









I remember feeling my body slip out of the chair, footsteps thundering down as I made my way into the dining room, Malinda and Roman running with me.





Everyone’s focus remained on a little boy that stood in the middle of the hall, his jet black hair and an upright posture, his head drawn right back and his eyes unfocused on the ceiling as he coldly muttered words in a language we couldn’t figure out. 




It all stopped when Mrs Powell gave him the medicine and he slowly fell into her arms as she demanded all of us to ‘stop messing around or we won’t be adopted.’ 








———————————————————————





But that was a long time ago.  








For a while, I always wondered where I belonged in this world, I believe all of us did. I am now in an interrogation room, with many people watching me.







“Did you find the adopted children, Jackson H-hills, Logan Reed, Inessa and Iliana Grove, Norman Porter..” I trailed off.







“I am sorry but there has been a misunderstanding, those children were deceased long before—“








“Ma’am, they were adopted.. with a family..” i pointed out as the lady in uniform shook her head.








“Whatever you experienced were caused by the drugging before bed and anytime after that, which can cause difficulty to sleep or vivid hallucinations..” The woman replied gently.


 





I tried to hold in the tears that streamed down my cheeks.


Now they were asking why I never searched for my family after years of being locked with children that have been missing for a while. The lady explained what the orphanage truly is, what the caretakers did, something that killed the remaining hope I had left. 









“Sie behalten dich für immer hier..” the lady whispered, my ears pricked up, I frowned.








“They keep you here forever.” One of the men with a thick accent translated, his face glimmered with a mixture of sadness








“The absurd and strange behaviour amongst the children were caused by something above our knowledge, I believe all of the children, including you were haunted in the orphanage, whatever caused the unnatural circumstances just saved your lives.” The lady smiled, the weight, the paranoia, everything, lifted off my chest completely.









The adopted children we knew, never returned. 







And everyday I thank them for what they did.
