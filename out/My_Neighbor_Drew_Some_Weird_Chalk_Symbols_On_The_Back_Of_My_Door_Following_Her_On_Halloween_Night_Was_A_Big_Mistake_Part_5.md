The chalk circle that took us out of Matilda’s cottage was the last bit of *“magic”* that I saw Ms. Mortimer perform for a long time. When we stepped through it, I found myself standing in a roman palace. I was  surrounded by statues of emperors, marble columns, and…*slot machines?* I had never been to Las Vegas before; I had no idea such a place even existed. 

“Matilda and I came here for my twenty-first birthday,” Ms. Mortimer explained, a little sheepishly. “It was the only other place I could think of to go.” 

Surrounded by so much light and sound, it was odd how our lives seemed to quiet down–at least for a while. Ms. Mortimer rented a small apartment for us, enrolled me in the local public school system, and got herself a job as a paraeducator in the same elementary school that I attended. She claimed it was just a coincidence, but if so, there were a lot of *“coincidences”* that summer. Like the way the school secretary’s eyes slid out of focus any time he asked Ms. Mortimer for a document she didn’t have, or the way the apartment rental agent spoke only to her, like he didn’t see me at all–*and looking back, maybe he really didn’t.* 

I suspected that Ms. Mortimer got a job in my school to keep an eye on me. After all, Matilda was still out there. Ms. Mortimer and I made a pact not to use the *“W”* word, but the fact was  that Matilda was a far more accomplished *witch* than Ms. Mortimer had ever been. Could she track us somehow, maybe using a stray hair from my head or a few drops of blood from the dart she’d thrown at me? Neither of us had any idea–

But I had a feeling Ms. Mortimer was secretly working to find out. 

She’d had all her books and furniture shipped to our new apartment, and if I ignored the red dirt, cacti, and scorching asphalt outside the window, the living room felt just like her study, back in my old neighborhood. Ms. Mortimer herself seemed happy to be working with kids, just like she’d always wanted, but the light in her room often stayed on until after midnight…and a few of her books never reappeared on their shelf. She was studying something–

*But what?*

Once, I pressed my ear to her door and listened to the words she kept repeating to herself over and over, then crept back to my bedroom and tried to speak them myself. The first few times, nothing happened; on my fourth try, three of my fingers burnt painfully and gave off an awful smell like rotten eggs that lingered even after I plunged them into cold water.

The next morning, Ms. Mortimer raised an eyebrow and my blackened fingers, but said nothing. *What the hell was going on?* 

On one hand, I felt guilty for violating Ms. Mortimer’s privacy; on the other, I felt left out, especially after all we’d been through together. When I snooped around her room while she was at a training, however, I found more than I bargained for.

The wall was covered with *“HAVE YOU SEEN ME?”* flyers for missing children, all linked by red string. I realized with a chill that the disappearances were probably Matilda’s doing, and *my* face could just as easily have been pinned to her board beside the others. 

And that wasn’t all. There was also a foul-smelling book written in what I would later learn was backwards Latin, a post-it note with *“thin times, thin places”* scribbled on it, and a calendar counting down to Halloween…which, by then, was just a few days away.

The Halloweens that I had always known featured chilly nights, swirling autumn leaves, and packs of children on the prowl for candy. 

It turned out that Halloweens in Las Vegas were a lot hotter, a lot brighter–and a lot less kid-friendly. Ms. Mortimer and I spent the evening inside scaring ourselves with old movies, and when I went to bed, I thought that she did, too…

But around midnight, I heard the apartment door creaking open. Ms. Mortimer was trying to go someplace silently, and she wasn't using the chalk: *she didn't want me to be able to follow her!* 

Of course, I wasn’t going to let that stop me. I watched out the window to see which direction she'd turn, then headed down into the street. 

Ms. Mortimer turned right, walking out toward the undeveloped desert lots. I frowned; there was nothing out there, not even light…

Or so I'd thought.

As we left the sidewalk and went deeper into the desert night, a building began to take shape out of the darkness: *a hotel.* I'd never seen one there before…but how could I have missed something so big and gaudy? *"Thin times, thin places,"* Ms. Mortimer's note had said. 

In spite of the heat, I suddenly felt cold. 

No cars were parked in front of the hotel; no people stood on the sidewalk. There was nothing around but the blackness of the desert night, and when I turned around, I realized with horror that the city lights behind me were gone as well.

It was as if, apart from the building in front of me, the rest of the world had ceased to exist.

*"PARADISO"* read the crimson neon lights, and I hurried to keep up as Ms. Mortimer disappeared through the revolving beneath them. 

I had *wanted* to stay far enough away that she wouldn't see me, but the night around me had begun to feel oddly, horribly hungry. Maybe the blacker-than-black shapes in the darkness were just shadows cast by the desert cliffs–*but maybe not. And was that howling sound the wind, or someone wailing?*

I didn't wait to find out. I scampered into the hotel lobby and hid behind an enormous ebony pillar. To my surprise, the marble lobby was empty–and silent. A gaunt, hollow-faced man in a black suit and red tie sat behind a round desk, still as a statue; the air was full of that burning, rotten-egg smell that I'd noticed back in the apartment. 

I tiptoed through the shadows of the lobby, too eager to eavesdrop on Ms. Mortimer's conversation with the thin man to wonder about the odd way my footsteps echoed in the cavernous space. Now that I was closer, I could read the nameplate on the thin man’s desk: *“Charon.”* 

It was hard to hear what they were saying, with all the jibbering and giggling that seemed to come from the shadows around me–but it was something about reservations. 

Ms. Mortimer said she didn’t have one, but wanted to make one. The thin man raised an eyebrow. If she wanted to make herself a reservation *here,* he said, she’d need to speak with his superiors. The thin man gestured to the elevators behind him. A brass plaque above them read:

*“Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Here.”* 

It didn’t seem like a very cheerful message for a hotel.

The elevator doors opened in front of Ms. Mortimer; I had only seconds to follow her.

The thin man at the desk watched with silent curiosity as I skidded into the elevator behind Ms. Mortimer just as the door was closing.

“What on earth are *YOU* doing here?!” she gasped. 

“I followed you,” I shrugged. “I thought you might need help…” 

Ms. Mortimer pinched the bridge of her nose, took a deep breath, and counted to ten. 

“Just stay close to me…and promise me something: *if I squeeze your hand twice, run as fast as you can and don’t look back*.” 

Then, suddenly, we were moving. There were nine floors, I realized, and someone on the second floor had summoned the elevator. To my surprise, we were going *down* instead of up.

Ms. Mortimer grabbed my hand, backed us both against the mirrored walls of the elevator, and pressed a finger to her lips.

*DING.* 

The doors opened. Iron-gray clouds whipped by on the other side, driven by a wind so strong that we had to grab onto the bannister of the elevator to avoid being ripped out into the storm. There was no ceiling, no floor, nothing but an endless gale. 

I thought I saw arms, legs, the bare skin of someone’s back–

But that was impossible. No *people* could survive out there… 

*Could they?* 

“Close your eyes.” Ms. Mortimer whispered. 

Seconds later, I heard it: *CLOMP. CLOMP.* Not footsteps: *hooves.* Something had walked out of the raging winds and into the elevator, and that rotten smell was now stronger than ever…

“Going down?” Ms. Mortimer asked politely. The response was a bullish snort that seemed to mean *“yes,”* and then we were moving again, three floors lower.

Ms. Mortimer scooted me slowly along the wall: partially to avoid the huge, foul-smelling presence, and partly to protect us from whatever we’d find outside the doors when they opened once more.

*DING.* 

Even sheltered by the thick elevator walls, the heat was almost unbearable. Burning. Screams. The clang of metal. With a satisfied snort, whatever was sharing the elevator with us stomped out into the fire, and the doors slid shut again. For a moment, there was no sound but our ragged breaths and the dripping of our sweat.

Ms. Mortimer pressed another button and we went down one more floor to our final destination. 

“You can open your eyes now,” she told me. 

A square stone corridor waited outside. After everything I’d seen and heard so far, its very stillness and quiet were unsettling. Our footsteps echoed eerily as we walked out into it. There were square gaps in the floor and ceiling, and I realized dizzily that they were *more* corridors that extended up and down for what felt like forever…

*And come to think of it, THIS hallway didn’t have an end that I could see, either…and neither did any of the others that we passed.* I looked nervously back at the brass elevator and bit my lip. *What WAS this place? What if we got lost?* 

The corridors were lined with square, metal doors. Some of them seemed to give off heat; others, icy cold. Shrieks, moans, and even insane laughter came from the other side of the blind metal. 

Ms. Mortimer took a few supplies out of her handbag: a silver dish, a stick, clear water, and an earring that I recognized from the cottage. *It must have belonged to Matilda…*

She poured the water into the dish and placed the stick inside, with the earring on its tip. When she held her hand over the strange compass she’d made, it began to spin–

Pointing a path down those endless hallways. 

We walked until my feet felt like lead bricks; we turned more times than I could count. Finally, the *“compass”* stood still…even though the metal door in front of us was no different from the rest. To my surprise, Ms. Mortimer opened it with just a gentle push. 

“These doors only open one way,” she sighed. “The things inside these rooms are locked up and forgotten…unless someone comes to let them out again.” 

I wanted to ask Ms. Mortimer *why* we were about to release something that had been imprisoned in this nightmarish place…but the tomblike room in front of us was empty.

At least, as far as *I* could see. 

Ms. Mortimer splashed some water through the doorway; it burst into flame. 

“It’s probably best if you wait here.”

I held my breath and watched as Ms. Mortimer crossed the threshold, approached a coffin-shaped altar in the center of the room, and picked up a yellowed scroll.

I could see by the look on her face that we needed to get out of there, *fast.* She slipped the paper into the folds of her black dress, grabbed my hand, and took a right down the next hallway. To my surprise, another elevator was waiting for us. 

“What’s going *on?!*” I whispered; Ms. Mortimer shushed me as we went into the elevator and pressed the button for the lobby. As the floors blinked by, I kept my fingers crossed there wouldn’t be any stops, that we wouldn’t encounter any more of the awful things that dwelt in this place, and that whatever Ms. Mortimer had just done, she wouldn’t get caught. 

When the door of the lobby opened, my sigh of relief died in my throat. 

At first I wasn’t sure what I was looking at: *if the three men standing in the lobby had their backs to me, why was I looking at their faces?*

The answer was as sickening as it was obvious: their heads were turned around completely backwards. Black, oily tears had blinded their eyes, but somehow I knew that they were staring at Ms. Mortimer. One of them started to moan, raising a backwards-facing hand toward where the scroll was hidden in Ms. Mortimer’s dress.

That was she squeezed my hand–twice.

We ran for it, although in my mind, it felt more like we flew. As we raced for the door, the facade of the lobby fell away around us, giving way to darkness and the gnashing of teeth. 

With a sinking feeling I realized that this was *NOT* a hotel, it had never been; that was just the form that my mind had given it to make sense of its infinite horror and insanity.

*“Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Here.”* 

Up ahead, an enormous black gate carved with maddening images was closing, cutting off our escape–

But not fast enough. We slipped through the gap and out the revolving door before crashing, exhausted, into the red dirt of the desert. 

When we turned around, “PARADISO” was gone. The light of dawn was just beginning to creep over the desert cliffs. Ms. Mortimer pulled the yellowed scroll from her dress.

“What *IS* that thing?” I asked. 

“Matilda’s contract,” Ms. Mortimer smiled sadly. “*This* is where she signed away her soul to escape that horrible place. *This* is what made her a monster that fuels itself by eating the spirits of the dead. If we destroy this…”

“She’ll go back to how she was before!” I finished excitedly. 

“And the spirits she consumed will be set free.” Ms. Mortimer nodded. She poured more water into the silver dish and spread the scroll across it. As she did, the ancient paper began to smoke and, finally, dissolve. When it was nothing but mush, she poured it out into the sand and stomped on it. We walked back to our apartment on the outskirts of the city, too tired to speak. 

Ms. Mortimer unlocked the door and I stepped through after her…then someone else stepped through after me. I gasped and backed against the wall as a pale woman threw her arms around Ms. Mortimer in a tight, joyful hug. 

I had no idea who she was–at first. Then I recognized her dark blue eyes.
