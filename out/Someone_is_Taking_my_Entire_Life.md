I am Maya Bennett. I know I have that and she can't take that away from me. Well, maybe not for much longer. I also want to say I'm not just jealous or paranoid, "Mia Harper" is not human. People have referred to me as jealous and I really can't see it. Toxic, it doesn't even describe me in the least. How can a person like me be toxic, I have a happy life. I had a happy life before "Mia Harper" took that from me.

I have always been special. I don't have superpowers or supernatural abilities. What I do have, is the ability to always get what I want. Don't have a car? My dad would buy it for me if I put up enough of a fit. Won't give me a good grade on an exam? Have fun with me telling the board of education that you did unsavory things. Mind you, I wasn't opposed to also doing unsavory things to get what I wanted. On multiple occasions I had slept with men to get what I wanted as well. But they were always beneath me.

Now that's not to say I was jealous. How can I be jealous when I always get what I want? I didn't even aspire to high things, I had my wonderful job at the crystals store that I could simply waste the day on my phone at, my excuse for a husband paying for all of my expenses and bills. And that was all I needed. My life was good and I deserved it.

So when I heard about Eve's engagement to Scott I suppose you could say I was a little jealous. Scott was handsome, he was drop dead gorgeous. He had muscle, but wasn't to big in that way, perhaps in other ways he was. Eve on the other hand, was more or less, average. Less average if I were being honest. But she was my sister and I would never say that to her face. We were sisters but that didn't mean we were anything alike. I suppose we both had our love of mysticism to share, working at the witchy shop together whenever our schedules aligned. So when Eve excitedly told me that Scott has proposed to her, I put on a smile and congratulated her.

But really, did she have the right to be happy while my husband stagnated? I suppose, but I also had the right to be happy. So, when I seduced Scott at the Christmas party of that year and he tore things off with Eve, it was only a matter of course. I always got what I wanted. Eve didn't take it nicely, she screamed at me and called me toxic and some other less than wonderful words. But, she had lost and I had won. It's not even like I was going to marry Scott, I still had my piggy bank of a marriage after all. I just wanted to experience the fun of Scott. It's not my fault he abandoned Eve because of it.

And life felt good after that. Eve was fired from the store as I convinced my manager she had been stealing from the cash register. Another win for me. However, it was last month where I was first introduced to "Mia Harper".

She had walked into the store with purpose and didn't really seem to interested in any of the soaps or herbs. "Mia" smiled at me with a slyness that I probably couldn't even project and leant up against the counter, clearly framing a dangling golden necklace on her collarbone. She was beautiful, I had to give them that. She said she was a friend of Eve's but that shouldn't get in the way of us being friends. I also didn't mind this fact, it was only obvious that she should pick me given the choice between Eve and myself. So, that's all it was.

I think I noticed the first time something went missing when I got home from work after that. I couldn't find a piece of my jewelry. Whatever, I would just get my husband or some other man to buy me a new one. I always got what I wanted. Three days later, "Mia" started working at the store, filling the space left behind by Eve. and within the day she was already receiving more compliments and accolades from customers and our manager than I ever had. She could laugh and smile and they would follow along. Her smile was so bright and beautiful that it could simply captivate them.

It was that day I noticed I had a couple cavities. Wasn't great so I decided to go to the dentist. It was a whole week before I began to get suspicious of "Mia". I had gone to a barbeque with my husband and "Mia" had happened to be there. She ran over to me and gave me a tight hug. Then she did the same with my husband, holding on for a little longer. She talked with him for the entire barbeque, and then my ever so loyal husband decided to divorce me there in front of everyone. I remember seeing "Mia" smiling from the edge of the lawn and that made me annoyed. I even went to Scott to try and console myself but he now had eyes on another woman. I didn't want to ask who.

I came home from work the next day. "Mia" had not been in that day. I realized where she was. My husband had decided "Mia" would now live in my house, keeping all of my belongings as well. They had already switched the locks. I called the police but when they arrived they agreed with "Mia". They even laughed at me when I started to scream and cry at them to believe me.

I slept in a motel that night. I tried to go to my job the next day, but my manager told me that I was fired as soon as I walked in. She let me know that "Mia" had exposed all the times I had stolen from the store. She even showed me some camera footage when I insisted I was innocent. It showed me, stealing some jewelry, glancing around to make sure no one was looking. I even looked towards the camera in the video, and smiled.

I went back to the motel, and found that the owner had given my room to someone else. I could hear Scott inside the room. He sounded like he was having fun. Finally, I relented and asked my parents to stay with them. Those next couple days were nice, I had nothing but I at least had them. Eve visited once and we argued but she seemed smug. How was I losing? To Eve? to "Mia"?

Then, it finally broke. I had been woken up by my parent's laughter and saw "Mia" sitting in the living room speaking with my parents. They were eating everything she was saying right up and it enraged me. I screamed at them to make her leave. So, they politely asked her to leave. They asked me what my problem with her was. That she was sweet and couldn't be out to get me.

The next day, the same thing happened. My parent's were laughing it up with "Mia" and when I asked them why they had let her back in, they seemingly didn't remember our previous conversation. They said that she was a sweetheart and like a daughter to them. They kicked me out of their house when I told them to chose between "Mia" and me. I slept that night on the street, in the woods near the neighborhood park.

So when I knocked on my parent's door the next day and begged them to let me back in to their confusion I broke. They said they had no idea who I was. I went to show them my driver's license to prove that I was their daughter but my wallet was gone. They said they only had two daughters, Eve Bennett and "Mia Harper". Why can't they notice that "Mia" has a different last name? I cried and they slammed the door in my face. They threatened to call the police on me, so I ran back into the wooded area where I had stayed.

I've been sleeping in the woods for the last 2 days. I have no money and whenever I go into a store to attempt to steal, I am kicked out immediately for my alleged shoplifting history. I don't understand why this is happening to me, this doesn't happen to me.

I went to see my parent's house and it was surrounded by fire trucks. Seems no one got out. The news said that the two older residents of the house died in their sleep of smoke inhalation. No one even knew people lived there. I went to see Eve but she had apparently disappeared.

I don't know where "Mia Harper" is either. Everything I had is gone and now she is too. I searched up her name on the internet but she does not exist. I looked up my name, and I don't show up either.

I think she has taken myself from me. I don't know how but I wanted to tell my story as a warning and hope that she does not take that as well. I worry that she is not done, I have nothing left but my life to take and I fear she will take even [that](https://www.reddit.com/r/CursesAndBoons/comments/180iwt6/welcome_to_cursesandboons/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).
