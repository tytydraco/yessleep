So this account happened about three months ago when I was living in Brooklyn. I was still working in real estate at that time, and the work was... well... it was a job. I was in the process of transitioning into other work, so I was a little more in contact with my family back home in Virginia to help guide me with my next path in life. I was never very close to my relatives throughout the years. At 19 I left Virginia Beach for the big city, and just never went back. I'm 32 now, so a lot of time has passed. Throughout that period, my contact with my mom and dad was pretty sporadic, but this was never intentional; I was always that busy. My interaction with other relatives was even less... so with this bit of understanding... it really  drives home the surreal element to this story. 

One day out of the blue, I get a phone call from a cousin who I'll call, Terrence. Terrence is about eight years younger than I, and growing up I briefly lived with his family for a year in Georgia. We were never that close, and when I lived with him... well... I was 16... and he was 8. Other than being related, the age gap for that point in our lives made all the difference. It's safe to assume we didn't grow close like relatives would who are more similar in age. After my time in Georgia, I went back north, and I never saw him again after that. My family never had reunions or spontaneous get togethers with extended relatives, so it was extremely easy to lose track of what was happening outside of my immediate household. 

Getting back on topic, Terrence rings me up, and I was genuinely surprised. I didn't even know he had my number, so it took me a second to realize who I was speaking with. We briefly caught up for a couple of minutes, before he asked if he could come out for a week and visit the city. Without hesitation, I welcomed him out. I was actually excited to see my little cousin after all these years. I wondered how he would look, or what he would be like. About two weeks later, I would get my answer. When I picked him at LaGuardia, I'm embarrassed to admit I didn't know what he would look like... but he for sure knew what I looked like. I hear my name get yelled out with this booming bass a ways away from me in the arrival lobby, and when I turned to face who was calling; there he stood. He was quite taller than me, with a muscular frame, and was strikingly good looking. I was a bit intimidated by his presence until he opened his mouth to speak, and it was then I realized I was chatting with Terrence. He had such a nice demeanor about him, the kind one would easily let their guard down around. He made you feel safe...

Once we got to my car, it wouldn't take long for me to realize this kid has a party itch he needed scratched. I obliged him of course. I like a good party, and I occasionally go out and get into some things. However, it would soon become evident that I wasn't on his level. New York is a city where the party won't stop if you're looking for it, and this was exactly what he wanted. This first night, I stuck with him til about 3am, and we talked about a lot of stuff. He seemed like a person that was running from some things, but he would never say what they were. In truth, I wasn't trying to press him for answers. The conversations seemed to have come in 30 minute sessions before women would approach the guy and he'd get distracted. By 3am, he totally engrossed in his interactions with all the female attention he garnered. I took this opportunity to call it a night, but I made sure he was comfortable with my departure first. Even though I already knew the answer to this, I just double checked still. His night was just starting, and so I made sure he knew how to get back to my place before going my separate way. Before heading home, I stopped by a local pizzeria that was still open and sat and ate for an hour. After this, I sobered up enough to journey back to my place. Before calling it a night, I double checked my guest room just to see if perhaps Terrence beat me home, but only his luggage were in there. It was close 5am and I had to be up at 9am to make some calls, so I quickly went to sleep. 

I don't remember passing out, but I do remember how I was awakened a little after 7am. What sounded like a women's muffled screams and a man's grunts -- jolted me from my slumber. It wasn't crazy loud, but my house is really quiet, so you tend to hear everything. The noise will cycle between pleasure sounds and intense action, so in all honesty... I was just annoyed that I couldn't get any rest. I was up clear til 9am, and shortly before that Terrence would finish up his time of fun. I was already moving around before then, so I figured I'd get up with my cousin once he woke up. Probably about an hour later, Terrence would enter the apt, looking a bit disheveled... but smug at the same time. I was quite thrown off, because I was preparing for the day while he was still going at it, and I would have noticed him leave, due to the fact I was sitting in the living room, and that's the only exit out. He informed me that he just got back, and he did in fact get lucky... but he wasn't in the apt when it went down. I was confused because it really sounded as if it was happening in the apt... but then I started to rationalize things. I have heard my neighbors go at it in the past, and they could get pretty loud... but still... their encounters never sounded as if it was coming from inside my place. 

I eventually chucked it up to being really tired, and perhaps my brain was being a little wonky for this reason. My attention to this was also easily derailed by the fact my cousin looked so dirty... little he was playing in dirt. When I asked him about why he looked so grimmy, his simple response was 'It got pretty wild last night.' I chuckled at his response, and let him wander off to the bedroom to rest. I would quickly realize this guy didn't sleep much...

Three hours after Terrence went to bed, I would hear this loud gasp come from his room... the kind one would make from waking up from a horrible nightmare. Maybe five minutes later, I would hear footsteps coming from the room like someone pacing, and talking that was loud enough to be heard... but it wasn't clear. I'd eventually realize Terrence isn't making sense, because he's mumbling to himself in a rather strange and... unnerving fashion. This would last for about thirty minutes before my cousin re-enters the living room, appearing visibly moody. When I asked him if everything was okay, out of nowhere he gets agitated and very defensive for seemingly no reason, and it was to the point that it made me a bit uncomfortable. However, shortly after unleashing his frightening grumpier side, my cousin just as fast wields it back in with an sincere apology.

One would think I would be creeped out by this point, and in hindsight I am... but in the moment, I was just a bit perplexed. I understood at that time I didn't know my cousin, so everything was new. I had nothing to go off on to say this is different from the norm. I just accepted that my cousin had some interesting behaviors, and just left an open mind about the information I'm downloading about him. Eventually, his mood would pep up over my desire to go back out for another night out. The extreme shift from a fairly somber demeanor, to an intensely happy one was pretty jarring for me, and it had me thinking he may be bipolar.

Still, we ended up going out, and as usual the girls would be all over him everywhere we went. I didn't stay out that long this night. I was home by midnight while my cousin kept going, and I went straight to the apt and fell fast asleep. For the second night in a row... I'm awakened by sounds coming from inside my place. It's about 6am, and it sounds like heavy thuds coming from the living room, like someone banging something on the floor. I'm instantly alarmed, for I think I'm being robbed!  I keep a 38 in my night stand... it's New York, you never know! I grabbed my gun a preceded to confront whoever was in my living room, but when I opened my room door to dark hallway... it fell eerily quiet. My heart was pounding out of my chest as I reached for nearby light switched. I could feel the presence of someone nearby within my targeted destination, and when I turned on the lights, and rushed the living room with my gun drawn... I would only find my cousin sitting on the couch... starring at the wall in a dazed manner... completely unphased by the scenario unfolding before him.

Again, he looked a mess... and after a brief moment he noticed me standing there in a state of confusion. His blank expression would quickly turn into one that was troubled, but it was obvious that it wasn't over me. Something was bothering him, but he was in no mood to speak on it, and I was too bewildered to care at the moment. I was more concerned about what was happening a few moments ago with all the loud banging, but Terrence would claim he heard nothing of the sort. He would then say he's been sitting in the dark livingroom for about an hour, and that is all. Nothing was out of place, there was no signs of floor impact... everything seemed to be in order.

Now at this point I'm starting to worry about myself. I was starting to think sleep depravity is creating all of these fictious incidents, and I just need to get some rest. I get my cousin to go to bed, and I decided I'm going to get some quality sleep til noon. I manage to do so, and when I woke up... I find some woman I've never met before sitting at the edge of my bed. She was beautiful, petite, and had a look of concern on her face as she strangely stared at me while I slept. I was immediately startled when I saw her, but my sudden jolt from my restful state didn't seem to bother her one bit. A few seconds later, Terrence burst into my room and yells at the girl to get out. This would be the first time I would see the girl have another expression past concern. A look of absolute fear would come over her like a burst of wind in the Manhattan skyline, and no sooner as her facial demeanor changes, she hurries from room in a submissive manner. 

My cousin will later tell me this girl's name is Denise, and she would be a presence that would stay around for the remainder of Terrence's stay. Once Denise came around, my cousin was too preoccupied with her to really hang with me. I didn't mine, for I was partly relieved that he was enjoying himself during his visit. Another part of me was just getting worn down from the bizarre events that seems to surround him. Having someone else to take up his time was more of a blessing in disguise than I realized at that time... but everything about Denise and Terrence felt off. Like how Denise never spoke for herself, or did what she was told without question, and especially the fact that she seemed quite afraid of my cousin. It didn't help that Terrence's mood would always be irritable whenever she was around. Oh... but It gets worse...

Two days after Denise arrives, and day four of my cousin's seven day stay -- in the middle of the night, I'm awakened to Terrence screaming at someone. I instantly jump out my bed and hurry to the living room to find Terrence standing over Denise in a fetal position. She looks as if she is in pain from my observation, but I don't see any blood anywhere. It's at this moment when my cousin slow turns and faces me, and the look of rage that was on his face scared me so bad... I froze up. In a split second, Terrence turns of the anger, and like that... he's back to his normal self...

He apologizes to me for making noise, and then it's followed up by him gently picking up Denise from the floor. He then tells me that he's going to leave the apt so that I can get rest. After saying this, even though his demeanor seemed fine, the manner of how he escorted out Denise with a firm grip on her said otherwise. At that time, I was hard on myself for not calling  the police regarding this situation... but in hindsight... I'm glad I didn't. Still, I was worried about Denise and my cousin. I wasn't sure what Terrence was capable of, and I also wasn't sure Denise would come out alright from whatever he was capable of doing...

After that incident, I didn't see either one of them for the next two days. Terrence wasn't answering my calls, he was no where to be found; I got really concerned. I finally called the police and filed a missing person report. The cops said they'll do what they can, but because he's an adult... you know the deal.

On the last day of what would have been my cousin's stay, Terrence came back to the apt. It was all weird, because he had nothing to say about disappearing for a few days and not answering my phone calls. He simply grabbed his belongings, gave me a hug, and told me he doesn't need a ride to the airport. I had many questions, but he didn't seem to have many answers. He dodged all but one of them... and for some reason he came alive when I asked him about Denise. Terrence would just say, 'She's better off.' and he left me with that.

One hour after my cousin left, my mom called me tell me something important. However, before she could say what it was, I told her about the bizarre week I just had with Terrence, and I told her everything. Once I finished, I was greeted with what seemed like a minute of silence from my mother. When she finally managed to speak, the only thing she could say was, 'That's impossible!' Regrettably, I got a bit annoyed at my mom, because I thought she was taking up for my cousin, and in a confused manner I asked her, 'Why is that?'

What my mom would say next... It still haunts my thoughts to this day. The next words that would come out of her mouth would be,

 'He's been dead since the day you claimed he visited.'

My mom would later tell me he was in a coma two weeks prior to his arrival, so there was no way he could have called me, and he died on the same day that he arrived to see me. His whole family was there for the entire ordeal of his death. 

What made matters worse -- he was being investigated at that time for the disappearance of multiple women around the Atlanta region. When I got off the phone with my mom, I felt sick to the stomach. I was a mixture of shocked and scared all at once. What just happened! Who did I meet!?! I asked my mom to send the most recent photo of my cousin in a healthy state, and she did... 

The person I interacted with for a week... was the same person in the photo! It was Terrence!

I retraced my steps for that week, every place I went with Terrence. Surely somebody saw me with him. I went to bars and clubs, and I spoke with bartenders that I know or interacted with during that time, and none of them could recount seeing myself or Terrence during that time. I found some of the girls that Terrence engaged during that time, but none of them could remember ever meeting my cousin... or myself. I tried to seek out Denise, for she would for sure make sense of everything. I would find Denise... but not really... and especially not in the way I could have ever imagined.

You see, Denise never lived in New York, although she is very real. Denise was from Atlanta... and she was at that time missing for five months. Terrence was suspected to be connected to her disappearance, as he was the last known person to be seen with her, but there isn't enough evidence to charge him with anything. Til this day, Denise is still missing.

I've since been in therapy to process all of this. I'm not sure if it is helping. My mom thinks that whatever I was seeing during that week, perhaps somehow I channelled a spiritual connection to where I was able to get a glimpse of what my cousin did. I don't know if he truly did it or not... but if what I seen is a true reflection of who he was...
