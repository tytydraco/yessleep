I received a beautiful porcelain doll from my grandmother for my birthday in February. Her name is Camille and she was made around the 1930-40s I set her up in my kids shared room just as a little decoration. Big mistake, that doll has been fucking terrorising my house. My two kids, aged 3 and 7 have been terrified of her. The week I got it multiple times a night they came  into my room saying Camille was moving. I thought they were just scared of her and imaging silly things so I told them stuff like that isn’t real. They were scared to sleep in that room alone so my husband slept in their room and they slept in my bed with me. He told me in the morning that there is something creepy about the doll, and it felt like someone was watching him. 

A week and a half of Camille being in our house, random things in our house have been moving, my car keys would be hidden, and I’d find them behind or right next to Camille. I didn’t want to believe in the paranormal so I ignored it.  But I have to admit I was a little freaked out. Random stuff like paper or my kids crayons would be all over the living room floor when we came home, even though nobody was home all day. After around 3 weeks of having Camille my daughters came into my room crying because apparently a scary little girl came into there room and was shouting at them to get out of her house. I didn’t believe this, so again I left it. 

My last straw was when my oldest daughter had scratch marks up her back. She told me Camille had came into their room at night and scratched and said she would hurt our family. My kids were too scared to even go near their room, let alone the doll. It broke my heart seeing my daughters in physical pain because of this stupid doll. 

I took my daughter to the doctor because the scratches almost looked infected and animal like. The doctor said it was as if a cat had scratched her, we don’t own a cat, and her scratches needed stitches. While my kids were at school I went over to my grandma’s house, I asked her where she got Camille from, she said it was her friend’s doll growing up. I was a bit suspicious because she seemed almost nervous to tell me any other details. She wouldn’t even tell me who her friend was. 

Please somebody help, something is in my home through this doll. I  moved it to my room and in the middle of the night I could literally feel something watching me, my tv turned on at night just showing random static. I threw the doll out last Tuesday but it keeps appearing, in my kids room, in the kitchen, in my room and other places around our house. I don’t know how to get rid of it. This thing is physically hurting my children and it’s broken multiple things in my house. I’m genuinely scared of it and so is my oldest son and my husband, my daughters are absolutely terrified and sometimes even refuse to come inside the house.
