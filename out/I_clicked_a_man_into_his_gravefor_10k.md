It was a normal day in my boring, routine life. I had bills piling up and money running out, as usual. I’d been here before, more times than I wanted to admit. And when things got tight like this, I had one surefire way to make quick cash. Don’t judge me - you do what you’ve got to do to survive. For me, that meant selling myself to men who had needs. It wasn’t the life I dreamt of, but it paid the bills.

That evening, I was browsing through one of those sites where you can find... clients. Not the safest way to make a living, but it was easy and familiar. I'd done it before. Desperation has a way of dulling your pride. Scrolling past the usual types - men looking for a quick, discreet meeting - I stumbled across a message that caught my eye.

“Seeking someone for a private arrangement. Significant compensation. Discretion required.”

I hesitated. The guy didn't have a profile picture or any other details. It was weird, but the promise of significant compensation was enough to pique my interest. I replied, asking what kind of arrangement he was looking for.

His response was immediate. “I need someone who can follow instructions without question. We’ll meet in person. You’ll be well compensated. $10,000 for a single evening.”

That number took me by surprise. I’d never been offered that kind of money before, not even close. My instincts were screaming that something was off, that this was too good to be true, but $10,000 was a lifeline I couldn’t ignore. So, against my better judgment, I agreed.

We arranged to meet at a hotel on the outskirts of town. The place was sketchy—far enough away from everything that nobody would notice us coming or going. I parked my car and headed inside, already feeling the first pangs of unease. The lobby was nearly empty, and the guy behind the counter didn’t even look up when I passed by.

I took the elevator up to the third floor, walked down the dimly lit hallway, and stopped at room 317. I hesitated for a second, but then I knocked. The door opened almost immediately, like he’d been standing right there, waiting for me

The man standing in front of me was wearing jeans with a striped shirt and a yellow jacket, and his face was hidden behind a strange, dark, featureless mask. The sight of it made my stomach twist. It was creepy.

I couldn't help but ask, ''What's with the mask?''

He looked at me, or at least I think he did - those dark eyeholes were impossible to read.

“I prefer to remain anonymous,” he said, his voice low and rough. “Does it bother you?”

It did, but I forced a smile. “No, it’s fine.''

He nodded and stepped aside, letting me into the room. It was small and bare, just a bed, a chair, a TV mounted on the wall, a thermometer, a window with blinds drawn tight and some paintings. The whole place reeked of cheap air freshener, but I'd been in worse. 

He pointed to the bed. “Sit down.''

I did as I was told, perching on the edge of the bed. He took a seat in the chair across from me and reached into his coat, pulling out a small device. It was a clicker, the kind you’d use to keep count of something. He held it out to me.

''Here'', he said, his tone almost eager. “All I need you to do is click it. As many times as you can.”

I stared at the clicker, then back at him. “You’re paying me $10,000 to click this thing?”

“Yes”, he said. “But you must follow my instructions exactly. Understand?”

I nodded. “Sure.”

“Good. Start clicking.”

I pressed the button, ant the counter on the display ticked up by one. He leaned back in his chair,  watching me with those dark, hollow eyes behind the mask while breathing heavy.

''Yes, that's it. Keep going.''

Click. Click. Click.

''Good'', he murmured. ''I like that. Just like that.''

I kept clicking, feeling more uncomfortable with each passing second. When the counter reached 50, he spoke again.

''When the counter hits 10,000, it will reset. That's when you'll get your money.''

This was getting weird - no, it had been weird from the start. But the way he said it, like the clicking itself was giving him pleasure, sent a shiver down my spine. Still, I needed that money, so I forced myself to keep going.

The first few clicks were awkward, but I got into a rhythm.

Click. Click. Click.

''Oh yes'', he whispered. ''Keep going. That's it. Just like that. You're so good.''

Every few seconds, he'd say something else, little murmurs of encouragement that felt wrong, like he was getting off on the sound of clicks instead of anything I could do for him. I thought about how odd this was - how bizarre it was that this man seemed to get off on the sound of a button being pressed. But I reminded myself of the money, and I kept clicking.

''Now'', he said after a while. ''Stand next to the window and continue.''

I stood up, moved to the window, and kept clicking.

''Look away'', he said.

I obeyed. I turn my back on him.

''Good'', he breathed. ''Now go to the thermometer. Turn it down. Keep clicking.''

I did as he asked, setting the temperature lower and lower, the room growing colder with each passing minute.

''Turn around and look at me.''

I turn around. Feeling uneasy.

''Perfect'', he said, almost moaning. ''Now move to the opposite of the bed. Don't stop clicking.''

“Now go to the door. Keep clicking.”

I moved to the door, the clicker still in my hand. My fingers were starting to ache, and the cold air was making my skin prickle, but I didn’t stop. I didn’t dare.

“Yes”, he said, his voice taking on a strange, eager edge. “That’s it. Keep going.”

It went on like that for what felt like hours—him giving me strange, specific instructions, and me following them without question. He made me move from one spot to another, always clicking, always obeying. And with every click, he seemed to grow more and more excited.

''Stop!'' he suddenly screamed, his voice sharp.

I froze, my thumb hovering over the button. The room was freezing now, my breath visible in the cold air. His body tensed, and he made guttural noises - it sounded like he was... finishing. And then he fell silent, slumping in the chair. I was frozen, holding my breath, wondering if this was it, if the ordeal was over. Worried that I won't get the money since the counter didn't hit 10k.

I stared at him, too stunned to move, too scared to speak. But then, in the darkness of that room, with only the clicker still in my hand, he slowly lifted his head.

''Continue clicking'', he said with a flat voice, devoid of the earlier excitement. ''Move to the window. Keep clicking.''

I moved to the window, facing away from him, the cold biting into my skin. I clicked the button, each press sending a sharp echo through the silent room. The counter was nearing 10k, and with each click, my dread grew.

“Now,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper, “turn around. Come sit on the bed. Keep clicking.”

I obeyed. He got up and approached me while pulling out a gun and I could hear my heart start pounding in my ears.

''We're almost done. I need you to keep clicking.''

I did as I was told. I didn't want to take any risks now. It was too late.

''Fast. Slow. Doesn't matter. You can not hurt me. Nothing can hurt me. I am strong and clean.''

With all the confusion, I kept quiet, thumb still clicking. I thought to myself if this is how I die.

''...And we are alone.''

He lifted the gun and pointed at me. This is it. This is how I die. I don't know why but I kept clicking. I had a weird urge to reach the 10k clicks. And I was almost there.

...9,997...9,998...9,999...

The counter hit 10,000, and the device in my hand reset with a loud beep.

He turned the gun and pointed it to his head while his body was vibrating.

''...Thank you.'''

\*\*PANG\*\*

He falls on the ground. Blood covering the floor. I stopped clicking, my thumb aching, my mind racing. Heart in my throat. I stumbled back in shock. My fingers fumbled with the clicker in my hand, and I accidentally pressed it. The counter went up to 1 and the painting above the bed turned slightly.

All confused, the painting distracted me from the horror before me. I clicked the clicker again, and the painting turned more.

Click. Turn. Click. Turn.

I kept clicking, and the painting kept spinning until it made a full 360-degree rotation. I clicked again, and it started glowing faintly. Confused, terrified, I couldn't stop myself. I kept clicking, and the painting grew a stronger glow each time. 

I knew I should leave, run out of that room, but I felt frozen, like I couldn't move. It sounds ridiculous but it's true. The painting was glowing like the sun and stopped turning, no matter how many times I pressed the clicker. 

Something was pulling me closer to the painting that looked like a portal. And I couldn't stop myself from stepping closer.

Next thing I know, I wake up on the hotel bed. Man is gone. No blood. No clicker. But there was a thick envelope laying next to me. I grab it and didn't waste any time. I bolted out of the hotel, not stopping until I was back in the safety of my apartment. My heart still racing as I dumped the envelope of cash onto my bed. But as I did, something tumbled out with the money - a small, silver clicker, identical to the one I used in that room.

And this is where I turn to you guys. I don't know what to do with the clicker. I put it in my closet and never looked at it. Money is getting tight again and I'm getting such low offers that my body is getting really tired. Should I click on the clicker? What will happen? What if I get offered $10k again? Would it be worth it to go through this traumatic event? Or will something else happen? I don't know. Help me.
