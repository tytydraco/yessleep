That was the sales pitch. I had been unloading some boxes when the doorbell rang. When I opened the door there was a 20 something year old standing there with a blue collared shirt that read “Pristine Alarms”. 

  


“Hello Sir, have you upgraded your alarm system recently?”

  


With a friendly smile I said. “We actually don’t currently have one installed, we just moved in.”

  


“Talk about perfect timing! My name is Matt and I work for Pristine Alarms we specialize in home security. We have doorbell cameras, interior cameras, exterior cameras, automatic locks, and alarm systems. Everything to keep you and your family safe!”

  


“I appreciate the offer Matt but we have so much going on right now I don’t have the brain capacity to think about this.”

  


“I completely understand, feel free to think about it and contact me if you have any questions. I will leave you my card with my personal number on it and if you’re interested just give me a call and we can set you up!”

  


And with that he was gone. I wasn’t lying I had been doing a million things since we moved in a few days ago. I had just taken a promotion which unfortunately required a relocation. The kids weren’t too happy but they were still young so had plenty of time to make some new friends and start over. My wife has been great about this whole thing. She supported the move even though we knew it wasn’t going to be easy and was going to be a pain to start over. Later that night during our latest round of fast food I mentioned the alarm system pitch I was offered and asked her thoughts on it. 

  


“I mean, I think this is a pretty safe neighborhood but I wouldn’t mind getting one. It will give us peace of mind for when we aren’t home or when we’re sleeping.”

  


“Yeah, you’re not wrong honey. It would put us at ease. I will call the guy tomorrow and see when we can set it up.”

  


Early the next morning I gave Matt a call. I figured even if he didn’t answer I could leave a message and he would get back to me. To my surprise he answered after the first ring.

  


“Hello, this is Matt with Pristine Alarms. How can I help you.”

  


“Hey Matt, this is Phil. You stopped by yesterday, I’m over on-“

  


“Yes of course I remember, just moved in right? How can I help you Phil?”

  


“Well after talking it over with my other half we decided we need an Alarm system. We feel safe but a little added security won’t hurt.”

  


“Excellent! Because you just moved in, I would love to offer you a discount!” 

  


“Really? That would be amazing. What are we thinking?”

  


“2 interior cameras for main living area and hallway, 2 exterior cameras for front and back sides of the house, 2 automatic locks for the front and back door, doorbell camera and keypad! How does $500 for all that sound?!”

  


“500, oh that’s a little steep. On top of a monthly service that’s a little too much for us.”

  


“I’ll wave the monthly fee! Just the initial cost and no monthly expenses. We want to make sure you choose us!”

  


“Wow, DEAL! I really appreciate this Matt. When can we set up this installation? I just have to make sure someone is-“

  


“How does right now sound?! I just had a cancellation and I’m not too far away. I can come by right now and start the install. I should have all the items I promised in the work Van.”

  


“Uhh yeah that would be amazing, this is my last day off before I start my job so this works out perfect.”

  


“Awesome, I’ll see you soon Phil.”

  


Within 5 minutes I saw a van pull up to my house. I thought to myself “Damn, that was fast.” But didn’t think much of it. I opened the front door and there was Matt in his blue polo. He gave me a wave and continued on to the back of the van. I didn’t notice anyone else in the van. Was another one coming. Is he going to do this entire install by himself? Sure enough Matt exited the back of the van with a ladder, tool belt and camera in hand. 

  


“I’m going to start on the front and back cameras then I can move on to the interior. If you have any errands to run feel free, this is going to take me a while.”

  


While I wasn’t too keen on the idea of leaving the house I did have some things to do. The kids were at school and my wife was at work. She was a manager at a department store and was able to make a lateral transfer to a store near our new home. I had to go to the post office and pick up some paint for my home office. I decided to take care of my plans and figured I’d be back within the hour. 

  


As I pulled back up to the house I saw Matt putting the ladder away. While I closed the car door Matt approached me. 

  


“Alright Phil the exterior is done, I was able to to install the doorbell camera as well. I’m ready to move on to the interior when you are!” He said excitedly

  


“Great, follow me and let me know if you need anything.”

  


I entered the house and Matt quickly followed behind. I headed towards the office while Matt started to set up the cameras and keypad. I wanted to get a head start on painting the office because I knew I started work the next day. 

  


About and hour and a half later, I had just finished applying the first coat when Matt called out to me. 

  


“Hey Phil! All done! Just have to install the app on your phone and you will be able to access the cameras, keypad, and locks directly from your phone.”

  


“Awesome, thanks again! Is there some place I can leave you a review or call your boss or anything? You’ve been great and I’d love to rave about you.” I said as I chuckled.

  


Matt turned to me suddenly. “No. Uh no it’s alright just doing my job.”

  


“Okay? Uhh anyway what’s the app?”

  


“May I?” Matt reached out his open hand.

  


I handed him the phone without thinking. I had a big day ahead and just wanted to be finished. Within 30 seconds Matt had downloaded the app and handed my phone back to me.

  


“All set! I put the app on your Home Screen! Click the big blue “P.A” and it will bring you to your door bell camera. You can cycle through each camera by clicking the camera icon. Your door can be unlocked with a push of the lock icon, and your keypad can be used by, you guessed it, clicking the keypad icon. I set your default code to your house number. To set it just hit “set” and then the code. To turn it off hit “off” and then the code. Pretty simple! Feel free to change it at anytime!”

  


“This is great, thanks again Matt.” I said as we walked towards the door. “ I’ll be sure to spread the word to all the neighbors!”

  


Matt stopped walking.

  


“No no, no need too I already dealt with most of the neighborhood so please don’t mention me.”

  


What a weirdo I thought to myself. “No problem, thanks again!” 

  


As Matt left I walked back to my office to put on the second coat of paint.

  


When my wife and kids got home, I showed them the new cameras and alarm system. The kids couldn’t care less but my wife was impressed with not only the price but the fast installation.

  


“So this guy Matt did all this today by himself? Damn thats pretty impressive.”

  


“That’s exactly what I was thinking. The app is great, I can unlock the door from anywhere and can check on the cameras when we aren’t home. You should download it too babe.” 

  


We looked it up on her phone but for some reason couldn’t find it. We searched up Pristine Alarms, P.A, even searched Alarm apps but couldn’t find anything. I told her I’d give Matt a call in the morning and get it figured out. 

  


I went to bed that night excited to start my new job but surprisingly I was able to fall asleep pretty fast. Unfortunately my rest only lasted for a few hours. We were woken up by the sound of a blaring siren. For a split second I had no idea what was happening. I jumped up from bed and ran straight to the door. “Did someone try to come in?” My wife said as I looked through the window. I saw nothing. I checked the back door and windows. Once again, nothing. Once I got my bearings I headed for the keypad. I hit the “off” button and put our house number in. The words “access denied” popped up on the screen. I tried again, same message. By this point my family was behind me and starting to get annoyed.

  


“Whats going on?” My wife said.

  


“I have no idea, it wont turn off, it keeps saying access denied.” 

  


“Here let me try.” 

  


“Hit the off button and then put our house number in.”

  


She did just that. The sirens stopped. I stood there confused. Did I enter it wrong? I mean I’m out of it, sure but I know I entered it in correctly. 

  


After our hearts stopped racing we all headed back to bed. On the way to work I was going to call Matt and figure out the alarm situation. 

  


I got ready and downed a cup of coffee. I was EXHAUSTED. I called him on the way to the office. One ring and then an answer.

  


“Hey Phil, I recognized your number. What can I do for you?”

  


“Hey Matt. We are having some trouble with the alarm. It went off randomly last night and when I entered the code it didn’t turn off.”

  


“Hmm, thats strange. I can come by and check it out. Maybe run a couple of tests.”

  


“Sure, what is a good time for you?”

  


“I know you said you had work today? Is anyone home right now? I have some time before my first job”

  


“Yeah my wife, I will call her and let her know you will be stopping by to fix the issue, i appreciate it.”

  


I called home and let my wife know Matt will be coming by. She was a little annoyed that she had to put on real clothes instead of pajamas but understood it needed to be done.

  


5 minutes later I got a notification on my phone that someone was at the front door. I opened the alarm app and saw the doorbell camera. It was Matt. That was fast. My wife opened the door and let Matt inside. I closed the app and headed into the office. 

  


On my lunch break I decided to call home. 

  


“Hey honey, hows your first day?” My wife asked.

  


“It is good darling, hows your day off? Did Matt fix the problem?”

  


“He is actually still here he said there was some sort of software issue.”

  


It had already been a few hours. He installed everything in less than 3. How does a software issue take more time. I told my wife I’d call her back. I wanted to know what was taking so long. I called Matt. No answer.

  


I called again. No answer.

  


What the hell is going on. The guy answers on the first ring every time I call. Now no answer at all. I decided to check the cameras. The front camera showed his van was still there. I cycled through the cameras. My wife was sitting on the couch watching t.v. I switch to the hallway camera. No sign of Matt. I was just about to switch to the back camera when I saw him. He was exiting our bedroom. I immediately called my wife.

  


“What the fuck is he doing in our room?!”

  


“What are you talking about he is by the keypad.”

  


“No he is not I just saw him walking out of our room!”

  


Thats when I got another call. It was Matt. I told my wife he was calling and I had to go.

  


“What the fuck do you think you’re doing walking around my house?”

  


“Phil I don’t appreciate you talking to me that way. For your information I was installing window sensors. I felt it was the least I can do for the inconvenience of the alarm going off last night.”

  


“Oh, uhh sorry, it just looked, well it just looked weird. You coming out of the bedroom like that.”

  


“Are you watching me Phil? Haha good to know the cameras work well. Don’t be concerned, the alarm is working perfectly now and your wife was great company. I’ll head out now. Enjoy your day Phil.”

  


“Uhh, thanks Matt sorry for blowing up like that.”

  


He had already hung up. 

  


After work I headed straight home, when the kids went to sleep I spoke to my wife about the window sensors. I told her he installed them free of charge. She was thankful but thought it was strange he didn’t mention it to her.

  


The next few days went smooth. Work was starting great, the family was settling in day by day and there weren’t any more issues with the alarm system. 

  


Until my wife and I decided to have a date night. 

  


We wanted to treat ourselves. The move was overwhelming and it was time for us to enjoy ourselves. We were just going out to dinner. The kids were old enough to be by themselves for a few hours plus we would be able to have eyes on them and the house with the cameras. 

  


We got all fancied up. We headed to a well reviewed steakhouse and were just enjoying each others company. That’s when I got a notification on my phone. “Front door unlocked.”

I looked at my wife puzzled and showed her my phone. She called the kids right away and I checked the doorbell camera. No one there. I was going through the other cameras and saw nothing. Then another notification. “Back door unlocked.” My wife was on the phone.

  


“Did you unlock the door?” She put it on speaker.

  


“No? We are doing homework and watching tv.”

  


“Check the doors make sure they are locked”

  


“Okay. I locked them. Is everything okay?”

  


“Yes everything is fine we just got a notification that the doors had been unlocked.”

  


She looked at me.

  


I said “Maybe the system is messing up again.”

  


“Maybe but I feel weird now, we should go.”

  


Just as I asked for the check. Another notification comes through. “There’s motion at the front door.” I check. No one there. I begin to check the cameras once again. Thats when I see the van. Matt’s van. What the hell?

  


“There’s motion at the back door.”

  


I cycle through. There is Matt standing by my back door.

  


“Back door unlocked.”

  


What the fuck.

  


I tell my wife we need to go now. 

  


“There’s motion at the front door.”

  


“Front door unlocked”

  


I call Matt. 

  


“Hello Phil”

  


“Matt what the fuck are you doing?”

  


“Just checking on you, I saw your car was gone and I just wanted to make sure everything was working as intended.”

  


“What? Why are you at my house? How are you unlocking my doors? Do you have acc-“

  


“Calm down Phil just doing my job. Everything looks great, I’m gonna take off now.”

  


I looked at my wife ”Call the cops, now!”

  


I rushed home, running through red lights and rolling through stop signs. 

  


When we arrived the police were already there. My wife ran to the kids and I stopped to talk to the officer. I explained the situation and what we were dealing with. The officer explained that it looked like we had a stalker on our hands and the best course of action was a restraining order. I only knew his first name and the company he worked for. The officer told me to look up the company number and describe to them the issues we were having. When I searched “Pristine Alarms” nothing came up. Not an app, not a website, not a phone number. I explained this to the officer. He looked confused. He explained without any information there wasn’t much he could do. He advised we stay in a hotel for a few nights until we could figure it out. I took his advice and I packed up the family and headed to a local hotel. 

  


My wife and the kids stayed “home” the next day. They were still shaken up which completely made sense. I on the other hand still had to work. I just started and had not yet built up any paid time off. It wasn’t until leaving the hotel for work that I realized I didn’t have my laptop. I forgot it in my home office. I needed it for work and it was on the way. I pulled into the drive way and ran in the house.

  


I ran to my office when the alarm started going off.

  


I ran to enter the code.

  


“Access denied”

  


I tried again.

  


“Access denied”

  


“There’s motion at the back door”

  


The siren stopped.

  


My phone rang.

  


“Hi there Phil, I see you’re home. Where were you last night? I wanted to come say hi to you and the wife but no one was here after the cops left.”

  


I didn’t say a word.

  


“Phil I can see you on the camera, you look tense. Relax bud I’m just making sure everything is alright. I just want to make sure everything is working as intended.”

  


“Who the fuck are you, “Pristine Alarms” isn’t even a real fucking company.”

  


“C’mon now Philly, I work hard at my job.”

  


“Listen you psycho, leave my family the fuck alone.”

  


“I just wanna make sure you’re safe.”

  


He hung up.

  


“Front door unlocked.”

  


I rushed to the front door ready to strangle this asshole. That’s when the back door swung open. 

  


By the time I turned around it was too late. The bat hit my ribs and I immediately collapsed to the ground. Matt was standing over me with the bat raised. The wind was knocked out of me but I had to do something. I kicked at his knee with enough force to make him drop the bat. I scampered to my feet but before I could do anything else to defend myself I heard the command.

  


“DON’T FUCKING MOVE!” The police must’ve been called by one of the neighbors.

  


My eyes locked on Matt as I saw him reaching for his phone.

  


Then the siren went off. While the officers were flustered Matt rose to his feet and sprinted out the back door. The officers gave chase but returned without Matt. That psychopath got away. I was  questioned by the police and after some slight investigation they began to take my report of what happened. After the information was gathered I planned on calling my wife to inform her of the chaos that just ensued. That’s when I noticed the all too familiar “Pristine Alarms” van parked down the street. I approached it curious to see what was inside. Maybe Matt was hiding out in there, maybe there would be SOMETHING that can show me who he really was. 

  


I opened the back door of the van. There it was. His control room. He had a monitor for every camera installed in my house. Buttons and switches for every time he wanted to unlock the doors, turn off the alarm, or set off a camera.

Why the fuck was he so obsessed with us. 

  


My phone rang.

  


I answered.

  


“Looks like everything is in working order, please call me if you need any more help Phil.”
