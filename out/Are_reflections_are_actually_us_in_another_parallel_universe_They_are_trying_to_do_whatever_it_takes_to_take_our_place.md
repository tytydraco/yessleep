I've always been fascinated by mirrors. The way they reflect our image, capturing every detail, every imperfection. But lately, something's been off. I can't quite put my finger on it, but my reflection seems... different. It's as if it's watching me, studying me, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.

I started keeping a journal, documenting my experiences with my reflection. I needed to know if I was going insane or if there was something more sinister at play.

**Day 1**

I noticed it today. My reflection was smirking at me. I swear it was. I blinked, and it was gone. Just a normal reflection, staring back at me. I must be imagining things.

**Day 3**

It happened again. This time, my reflection was standing a few inches away from where I was. I moved closer, and it moved closer too, but not quite in sync. I felt a chill run down my spine. What the hell is going on?

**Day 7**

I can't shake the feeling that my reflection is watching me. It's like it's waiting for something. I've started avoiding mirrors, but I can't escape them completely. They're everywhere – in the bathroom, the hallway, even my bedroom. I can't sleep. I can't eat. I'm losing my mind.

**Day 12**

I caught my reflection whispering to itself today. I couldn't make out the words, but it sounded like a plan. A plan to replace me. I smashed the mirror in a fit of rage, but the shards just reflected more of that sinister doppelgänger. I can't escape it.

**Day 16**

I've barricaded myself in my room, covering every reflective surface with sheets and blankets. But I can still feel its presence, lurking just beyond my sight. I can hear it whispering, plotting, scheming. I don't know how much longer I can take this.

**Day 21**

I had a dream last night. I was standing in front of a mirror, and my reflection reached out and grabbed me. It pulled me into its world, a twisted, dark version of my own. I was trapped, and it was free to take my place. I woke up screaming, drenched in sweat. It was just a dream, right?

**Day 25**

I can't take it anymore. I need to confront my reflection, to prove to myself that it's all in my head. I've uncovered the mirror in my bedroom, and I'm standing in front of it now. My reflection is staring back at me, its eyes cold and calculating. I can see the malice in its gaze.

I take a deep breath and reach out to touch the mirror. My reflection does the same, our fingertips almost touching. And then, suddenly, it grabs me. Its grip is ice-cold and unyielding, and I can feel myself being pulled into the mirror.

I struggle, but it's no use. My reflection is too strong. It drags me into its world, and I watch in horror as it steps out of the mirror and into my life. I'm trapped, and it's free.

As I stare out from the other side of the mirror, I realize the truth. The reflections we see of ourselves are actually us in a parallel universe, and they are planning to do whatever it takes to take our place in this world. And now, it's too late for me.
