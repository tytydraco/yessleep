Work had been ramping up over that month and though the advent of a couple of new hires did balance out our two no-shows, they just weren’t pulling their weight.



Almost a week by that time with only radio silence on Hon’s end. Unbelievable for a guy who frequently clocked overtime hours and had been here as long as I had.



The new guys tried, I could tell, but it wasn’t like out payloads were heavy, rather the nature of what we stored kinda rubbed people the wrong way. We stored mannequins. The human like plastic ones, wooden torso racks and even the thin colourful sports blocks.



The uncanny valley does get to you early on. Even our long-time staff can occasionally still get jumpy, regardless of how much we think our minds have adjusted. 



I’ll admit, when I first started, I was petrified, almost quitting on two occasions. Most notably when another member of staff pranked me as I tried to pick up, what I thought was a lifeless plastic shell.



Finishing up for the evening, my eyes begged for a momentary rest, though I still needed to crest the hurdle that was an hour’s commute home.



It was winter in the north, and as usual, storms followed the cold weather. Rubbing my gloved hands together as I trudged over to my aged vehicle, it took me a good four or five tugs at the handle before the frost ladened door hinges relented.



Mindlessly charting my way home, I was stopped by a pair of beaming headlights and an approaching officer. Quickly straightening my posture and rubbing my eyes, I wound down the window, putting on a well-rested persona.



“Hi there bud, unfortunately this road is shut off, at least for the night. I’m going to have to ask you to turn around.”



His slightly tired yet authoritative tone kept me upright in my seat.



“Is the road flooded again? I thought that lake was being drained, you know? Because of that missing girl.”



I hesitated after speaking, realising I may have poked at a saw spot for the department.



“Look, we’re doing what we can, but it’s hard to keep up.”



The fatigue in his voice implying something, most in our area, were all too familiar with.



With the biting wind still cutting through us both, we said our goodbyes as I turned to take another route home. Barely minutes into my detour the soft patter of snowflakes began to lull my eyes closed.



Breaking me from my apparent blackout were the skidding sounds of my own tires, spinning as they flicked up spirts of frozen dirt and slurry from the road’s banks. Pushing the line between a careening off spin into the increasingly closing foliage, I opted for a short stop.



Just my luck, a gas station only a mile or so ahead, through the fog. At the time I remember being thankful seeing that frostbitten red sign, a chance to make a stop in a safer location, though the anglers light is often enticing.

Miraculously my aged vehicle managed to fight through the snow-covered icy lane as it rumbled to a stop under the shelter of the fuel canopy.



With my heating knackered and the storm striking ablaze as my vehicle scraped its undulating strip, I was locked in a vessel akin to a refrigerator, crystalising me to the torn leather seat. Scanning the glazed windows of the station, there seemed to be no movement, not assisted by the lack of any internal or external lights.



Hoping and praying the station wasn’t closed, I flung my coat on and made a slippery dash for the front doors, avoiding that darker mound laying parallel to the building. I could have easily mistaken it for the onrush encircling me, but a shrill whisper piggybacked those swirling gusts.



Stopping and scanning my obscured surroundings, the ominous stumps of the encircling tree line didn’t fill me with enough fear to stop my pursuit.  



Locked. Great I thought, as I attempted to see if I could grab the attention of anyone who may have been residing within. Though it was hard to make out, I could see the silhouette of people inside. Oddly my repeated knocks on the front didn’t elicit even a glance as I questioned if they were just constructs of my weary mind.



On the verge of giving up and just fighting through the torrent, I noticed the fire door was ajar. Maybe the power is out so the front isn’t working, that thought gave me a small amount of hope that I could escape the onrushing blizzard.



Pushing the fire door open and stepping inside I was hit by the cool air and smell of burned plastic. Guessing their heaters were as busted as my own, I strode to the counter where I’d seen the two silhouettes.



My pace dropped as I moved closer. The two figures I had mistaken for living, breathing people were in fact mannequins. Two plastic mannequins, one female and one male, both wearing a mixture of blue and white shirts stood motionless, locked in silent conversation.



Scanning their figures, my mind instantly went to Hon and his family man dress sense. The clothes they modelled were right up his alley, even down to the striped pattern.



Initially chuckling to myself at the likelihood these were from our own warehouse, a deep sigh flowed out at the thought of once again being on my own. Part of me was happy that I didn’t have to engage in meaningless polite conversation, due to my restless state, though company might have reduced my hallucinatory fatigue.



Shivering as those rampant chills permeated the carried by that shrill whisper, I had two options, wait out the increasingly violent storm here, or take my chances on the road, with an already tired mind. Deciding against wrapping myself around one of the roadside trees, I searched the dark room for a fuse box.



Though I was no electrician, I needed to at least lighten up my surroundings, maybe even fix their busted heating unit. With the ferocity of that maelstrom not letting up and the paper-thin walls offering little resistance, I need some semblance of warmth.  



Striding away to the back, I thought I was passed that fear, but the smooth, blank, expressionless faces must have still touched a nerve. Every minor sound or addition of movement had me flicking back to the two mannequins, and each time they were stood in their same positions, devoid of movement.



Obviously, that’s what they should be doing, nothing, but every time my eyes rose to meet their glossy finish, I expected them to have inched closer, plastic weeping angels.

Swinging through the already open door, I entered the increasingly tenebrous office, guided by my already wavering phone torch. Finding the fuse box, I reached for the front panel, expecting to see some minor damage that would be quick and easy to fix. To my surprise there was nothing. Swiping for the raised side of the box my hand simply caressed the cold stone wall.



Rubbing my eyes in a foe attempt to refocus, almost as if it was my weary condition distorting my surroundings, again … nothing.



The flat front panel was nothing more than a competently drawn on façade.



Sprouting deep within my chest a seed of fear began to grow, once buried under the layers of ice-cold ignorance, now emboldened by my overloading mind.



Scanning the derelict office, faint strands of light peered in through the buckled back door as they melded with the petite cone of light my phone gleamed. In those evening rays that series of desks, office cabinets and storage racks, were illuminated, bearing their one note grey visage.  



Aimlessly tracing my hands over each piece of furniture, a realisation dawned on me that only sought to feed that growth within. The room was nothing more than a half-baked facsimile, just convincing enough to draw me closer. Each carefully crafted block, nothing more than a protrusion of the aged monolith I resided in.



Breaking me from my slack jawed position were a series of repeated thumps emanating from the main store area. Why that primally morbid curiosity took hold I can’t say, though some part of me wanted answers, and that was the first sign of anything animate.



Bursting back through the doorway, my stupefied gaze beamed across the room, expecting to see those frozen silhouettes cracking as their joins contorted with ill intent, divorced from their manufactured design.



Instead, one of those ductile figures lay, face down at the foot of its compatriot. Actually, analysing it for the first time, its plastic sheen seemed rubbery, more in line with the smooth outer layer of a balloon.



Kneeling to better examine the female mannequin and ascertain the location of its tag, another thud rippled the thin glass ahead. Scanning up to its glazed finish, burst forth a tendril of fear from that internal seed.



A series of frozen, crystallising handprints were plastered across that large translucent wall. Their form initially subhuman, with digits yes, but most elongated, fused at the second joint or split at the tip, slowly retracted.



As I followed their conforming palm across the glass, they finally became human-esque, evolving from a primal appendage to a sophisticated one. However, their trajectory burned away any thought of the structure I resided in.



Their prints arrowed for the fire door. A sharp piercing whisper crackled as it tore into my inner canal. Its disorientating call almost enough to mask its rapid crunching steps in the still twisting torrent outside.



Dragging myself up and over to the heavy-set door, I slammed all my residual weight into its metallic frame. Though its hinges resisted, they quickly fell to the shear panic induced heaving my draining body mustered.



As its locks clicked into place, a cascade of soft thuds ricochet off its frostbitten outer layer. They could have simply been a product of the hailstorm outside or worse a feral entity seeking passage into my newfound sanctuary from the cold.



That seems far too generous of a description, for what constituted a sheet of paper, crudely likened to a building with as much torpor as my mind screamed out for.

 

Stepping backwards, restless and limp, my heel connected with what I would have initially deemed a small shelf, though with my enlightenment, was nothing more than a painted slab, jutting forth from my self-induced prison.



Laying there, staring up at the rough jagged light fixtures, my oscillopsia swayed their petrified form. I was on the brink. Sleep depravity would set in soon and with no safe way out, my only option was to curl up and hibernate the twisting storm.



Clambering over the facedown mannequin and using the only other object not tied down as a crutch, I made my way up to my shaky feet. Peeling away those already crystallising garments, they’d have to do as a makeshift cover.



With my already failing vision, I recall disposing of the all too stretchy epidermic sculptures in one of the far corners of the store area, not comprehending the blind eyes tracking my shambling movements.



Just barely making it back to my chosen bed, though it was cramped, the cashier’s desk would at least cover me from three sides. Slumping under the granitic andesite arch, my vision blacked as I faded.

Dreams are often morsels of deeply ingrained events moulded to present emotions, mine were no different. Waking, I was face down in the snow. Every joint ceased as my rigor mortis ladened extremities were unmoving ridged in their numb statuesque state.

  
Straining to lift my frozen neck, all in my line of sight was white, as the crunch of powdered snow emanated from ahead. Tearing icy blades tore into my half exposed back as the blizzard savaged my lifeless body.



What I perceived as a whisper in that dream world, quickly developed into a burning breath as it stuns against my numb blue ear as it danced across the howling wind.



Jolting up and into the concrete cocoon I had formed form myself, my body quickly caught me up to the situation I was still in. Though I couldn’t remember my dream fully, the feeling of being watched as I traversed that dreamscape was as vivid as the feel that now overtook my shivering body.



Crawling out of my frost blanketed hiding spot, the beating of the external storm still played its ever-present ambient tune. Just moving clued me into how ling I been curled up in that packet, with the tips of each extremity vibrating a numb stinging pain in unison.



Crystalising as it bellowed forth from my agape mouth a fog-like breath clouded my field of view. My breath had always been visible, but to freeze that rapidly the building may as well not even existed, exposing me to the elements without remorse.



As those tiny flecks solidified and fell to the ground in a cascade of patters, my vision locked on the three pairs of eyes, peaking over my makeshift hiding spot.



Scrambling to my feet as I collided with the back wall, all three mannequins stood, shoulder to shoulder as thy faced me. Their glossy finishes coated with an icy layer reflected back my panicked gaze.



How had they got there? Who’d moved them? Were they alive?



Questions floated around my scrambled brain, all without answer, like a test I hadn’t revised. That burning in my chest fuelled the growth as it took hold, ensnaring my limbs and rooting me to my post.



If they were going to attack, when and what for? Why had I been lured into a fake building and frozen half to death?



We stood, locked in our unblinking contest for what felt like an eternity, waiting for that deep routed phobia to spring to life, pouncing on my mirrored figure. However, it didn’t come.



Regaining my nerve and breaking from my mental vines, I took a step to my right and away from the counter. I’d been eyeing up the door to the office in a thinly vailed attempt to flee, though it seemed that my retreat wasn’t necessary.



As tethered to their cracked plastic base as they had been since the moment I entered, they were stationary. Half laughing, half on edge still, I turned towards that adjacent room. Even if I knew they weren’t animate, they’d been moved by someone, and I needed to at least put some distance between us.



Recollecting where and when I’d last seen them, the minuscule advent of movement and my crystal-clear memory collapsed the vessel holding back my fear.



Cindering the inside of my brain with the picture in my periphery, I fed that growth one final time. Scrambling for the office door, its head snapped to attention as it broke free of its mould.



Though the frozen cogs had almost ceased their churning, the burning fear sprouting further rejuvenated my atrophied muscles, if only to flee.



The shattering, cracking of its joints echoed across the shadowed store as it dropped into a scuttle. Nails scraped the ground as it hurtled at a breakneck pace in my pursuit. Though the moonlit night peaked through the translucent windows, its casted silhouette engulfed my childish form.



Running for my life back to my bedroom like a child from the shadow at the foot of the stairs, my only salvation was the meagre safety that office door provided.



Gripping the handle and flinging it back with my entry, I managed to dive into the room, only just unscathed.



Falling as those mechanisms clogged with lactic acid in a sudden all-encompassing wave of pain and returning, ever present, restraining cold. My body jolted back in order to keep the door from caving in with that creature’s pursuit, but again, nothing.



Confined to my shrinking casket, the ambient tap of the ensnaring blizzard returned as I slumped against the monolith, I willing bound myself to.

Getting this down now is about as much as I can handle. Though the back door is exposing me to the elements at a more considerable rate, I barely have the strength to move my finger let alone crawl over to that snow propped opening.



Its whispers have returned, a reminder that it is waiting for my composure to slip. When that happens, I fear that it’ll have a new puppet.



My knuckles aren’t responding anymore, falling to the cold as my fingers and toes did. I can barely tell if I’m even breathing anymore, those once glassy shards cutting my insides now as numb as my expressionless face.



If I’ve got any chance, I’m going to have to make a break for my car. Who knows if it’s as helpless as I am, but I can’t stay frozen to this door indefinitely.



It’s probably just another trap, masterfully crafted by that creature posing as a statuesque phobia, but its not hurt me yet, even with the multitude of chances it’s had.



I don’t know if my body can even stand, but I will. That seed hasn’t stratified from the cold yet, so fuelled by its ember I have to try.



Maybe I won’t even make it out the door, maybe that was my body, simply a bump in the powdered snow, half way to freedom. Who knows, but that storm howls and I am cold.
