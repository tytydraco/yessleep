I have become something I don’t understand. But that which knows me is allowing me to communicate with you:

The first time it happened, I just thought it was overactive imagination. It’s only in hindsight that I know it was the beginning. And that it was straight after I’d read that email. I was sitting at a sports park waiting for the game to kick off. Scanning junk emails to pass the time. One caught my eye with its picture of a woman in her 20s. She had the darkest longest hair I’d ever seen:

“Dear Beloved, I have heard of your great beauty and deep kindness. If you wish me to come to you, read the next paragraph and I will hear you. Don’t read it otherwise, but I hope you do O pretty one::”

“LUNA YARI SUMI KAI”

“If you change your mind about me coming, use read the words again. But please don’t do that darling one.”

“See you soon.”

“Love from”

Cute pic, but the soccer was starting. Within a few minutes, my home team scored! I leapt up elated. The players ran across the field hugging each other. Suddenly, my entire field of vision was replaced. My view of the field disappeared. Instead, I saw… the entire soccer stadium and campus, from the perspective of someone up in the air, and perhaps a mile away. 

The vision lasted a few seconds. During it, I was so disoriented I stumbled into the seats in front of me, bumped into a lady, and spilled her drink all over her. I apologized profusely and pushed a few hundreds into her hand in case I’d ruined her expensive-looking white shorts. As for the vision, I assumed it was some kind of one-off brain fart. Nothing serious. 

Later that day, my Tesla was driving me along the strip. Traffic was super busy. Just as I passed my fave restaurant, I lost all view of the road in front. I could still see the restaurant, but it was from way back down the road. I could also, I realized after a couple of seconds, just make out my own vehicle. The black Tesla “MADE4FIT” plates (I run a luxury gym).

I could still feel my body inside the car, despite seeing the car from outside. I instinctively fumbled with my hands to find the wheel. Big mistake. The car was doing great without me. As soon as I grabbed that wheel (which I couldn’t even see during the vision) the auto-drive switched off and I saw my car (from a distance) swerve violently.

My normal vision returned but it was too late. I’d scraped the door of the car next to me. We pulled into an empty to swap details. I absorbed the barrage of verbal abuse from the besuited guy and gave him my number. “****ing Tesla drivers!”

It was only when I got to my gym and jogged on the treadmill that I had a quiet moment to consider recent events. Was there a link between my experience at the stadium and on the strip? Should I call Dr Frida in case I had some kind of brain issue? But my mind and body soon became lost in my running. I switched the treadmill up to sprint and became elated with endorphins. At which point, it all happened again.

I was watching me from on the street outside my gym whilst simultaneously feeling my legs pounding on the moving treadmill. My gym has a glass front. I seemed to be watching myself from the opposite sidewalk, staring into the gym from across the road. I was a man running like crazy. And I could still FEEL myself running like crazy. The panic was almost immediate. If I lost my balance I could get seriously injured at this speed! I watched myself tentatively reach for the stabilizing bars on either side of the treadmill. I tried to ignore what I could see and focus on what I could feel. My fingers sensed the plastic of the bars. I saw myself jump and land with my feet on either side of the moving belt.

I instinctively turned my head to see who was across the road from me looking at me. And then…and this felt really weird.. the view I was seeing rotated by the same angle. So I was no longer looking at the gym front but at the shops opposite my gym. I rotated my head back, and I could see myself in the gym across the road. With a flash the view changed back to my own, on the treadmill, pouring with sweat and pumping with adrenaline. One of my employees (a fitness trainer) noticed my distressed state and asked if I was ok, if I needed water. I said thank you, and that I was fine.

As I showered, it became clear to me that the three episodes were linked. So I Ubered home – too afraid to drive myself. My apartment complex is pretty new so hardly anyone has moved in yet. I love it there. In particular, each evening I adored a slow swim in the large pool. It wasn’t for exercise – more for meditation. I would dim the main lights so the pool lamps dominated. And I would even switch off half the pool lights. Well, I would normally – but I was a little freaked out that night – for obvious reasons. 

But still, it was nice and dark - God it was lovely, like taking a giant candle-lit bath in an adult pool. The pool had no shallow end, just a deep end, and a deeper end. At weekends it was used for local amateur diving competitions. Under the diving boards, the pool was almost 17 feet deep!  I liked to test my lung capacity by swimming to the pool bottom beneath those diving boards. 

I realized as I swam across the surface of the pool that I was probably over-worrying. My doctor had put me on medication a few weeks before for anxiety. I’d begged her for the strongest possible dose. So it must be the medication triggering hallucinations. Which in a way was great news – because I could simply come off the pills and problem solved! 

I had reached the diving board end of the pool. I smiled, took a deep breath, and went for the depths with an excited push. What a feeling it is to dive down to 17 feet deep! Not easy, but I’m pretty fit with a great lung capacity. When I reached the bottom of the pool I did my favorite trick. I took up a meditation position and push out all of my breath, so I sank peaceably to the floor. I loved the gentle gurgle of the underwater. Down there I felt relaxed for the first time since the treadmill. 

At times like that, I could almost see myself there, sitting in the dimly lit depths. No…wait...I literally could. I saw myself from the surface of the pool. It was happening again. Who was it? I almost breathed in water at the shock of this fourth vision switch. Thank heavens my survival instinct kicked in. 17 feet isn’t super deep, but it’s deep enough to die if you panic. I was watching myself uncurl my limbs carefully (from the point of view of someone 17 feet above). 

I tried to orient my body (which again I could still feel despite the vision switch) so it would swim towards the surface. But I kept doing it the wrong way around like I was looking in the mirror. My lungs spasmed a little for oxygen, but I still managed to not panic. 

I realized I was becoming larger in my altered vision. Oh God, whatever I was seeing myself through, had begun to dive down toward me, that’s why I was getting larger. Now I did panic. I looked up. And of course, all that happened was the thing diving toward me looked up too and I saw the surface of the pool from beneath. Panic really uses up oxygen. I looked down again. 

I was seeing myself from only about 10 feet away now. I swam fast away, and it swam with me Oh god lungs spasmed again, and I – a hand grabbed my ankle and I screamed struggled body jerking in all directions I breathed in oh no
-

I recovered consciousness beside the pool. Vomiting water. Shivering. A fellow resident I recognized – Sahar - knelt beside me. She looked terrified. “Oh thank Heavens!” She was covering me with towels. “I saw you down there and I just knew you were in trouble. You panicked when I grabbed you…” I interrupted, “Did you see anyone else? Near me?” I asked. She shook her head as if - obviously not! Now Maria was holding a cell phone and dialing. I managed to reach her hand and gently pushed it down. “No please…don’t.” 

How could I explain this to the emergency services - what had happened? I needed to get to my apartment, my bed - to rest, recuperate. And PLAN. 

Thankfully Sahar relented and helped me back to my apartment on the top floor. She even helped me into my bed. Then she tried to make that call again and was pretty forceful about trying. So that’s how I ended up having to tell her what had happened. And of course that led me to tell her about the treadmill, the Tesla, and the soccer match. And then she said something utterly terrifying, which I hadn’t thought of up to this point: “So these visions have got closer every time?” 

It was all clear to me now. At the soccer stadium, it was perhaps a mile away. While driving perhaps a quarter of a mile. In the gym, it was on the opposite sidewalk. And in the pool 17 and finally 10 feet from me. 

1 mile, quarter of a mile, 50 feet, 17 feet, 10 feet. How close would it be next time? Close enough to…reach out and touch me. 

In my terror, I unthinkingly asked Sahar if she would stay the night. But she took it entirely the wrong way. I guess it didn’t help that I'd hit on her a couple of times in the past (unsuccessfully) and that my bedroom looked like a player’s abode. On the ceiling, there was a large mirror. Sahar frowned and shook her head. The pity and concern drained out of her face and she left quickly after that.

I lay back on my bed and tried to order my thoughts. My eyes fell on my signed picture of a famous soccer team framed on the wall near my bed – a prized possession. That’s when it came back to me. The email I’d read in the stadium earlier that day. The woman who said she’d come to see me if I read a certain line. But that was just a coincidence surely? I knew I was in danger of tipping into an insane state, but I was so frightened of how close this…thing was getting to me. And if one impossible thing was happening, who decides what's insane? Then another memory…hadn’t the email contained something...a phrase I could say to cancel the meeting?  What WAS it again? LUNY GURU or something? 

Even though it was an insane long shot, I reached for my phone and opened my junk emails. And there was her email! I lay back on my pillow and clicked the email. I scrolled down too quickly and so the first words I saw were:

“If you change your mind about me coming, use read the words again. But please don’t do that darling one.”

My thumb touched the screen to scroll it up and read the words I wanted and…I was seeing my own face from the side. I’d rarely seen my profile and in that unreal moment I was struck by the strangest thought: “I look kind of ugly from the side. My nose is crooked.” The self I was looking at was holding a phone to read it.

The realization that whatever it was must that was stalking me (her?) was right next to me made me freeze with horror. It was so close I could see the individual hairs on my chin. I imagined I could feel a breath on my cheek. I instinctively looked to the side, and of course, it turned as well, and all I saw was my bedroom wall. How could I see if it was about to touch me?! 

I turned “my” head back and because of the angles, I caught a glimpse through of the mirror above my bed. What I saw broke me out in a cold sweat.

A woman whose face I could not see, with the darkest longest hair, wearing black clothes. She was kneeling beside my bed, leaning across the mattress towards my face, hair spread out on my bedclothes in a web of black strands. She was staring straight up at herself in the ceiling mirror. Her face was serene but her eyes were so black I looked away in despair and...

I saw my profile again, eyes wide, sweat. She must have then leaned in so close. Because I heard a whisper right in my ear, “My Beloved”. Her voice was beautiful but too deep. I was trapped. Suddenly I had one moment of clarity. I don’t know how it came. But I used all my strength of will to stop looking at myself and to turn “my” eyes to look at the phone screen. And there were the words, that - perhaps - promised freedom. I screamed them so loud it hurt my throat:

“LUNA! YARI! SUMI! KAI!”

Darkness.

I came to. I could not move. I was…in my ceiling? I could see myself moving around my bedroom, toweling off, making the bed. However, I seemed to have no control over my toweling movements. Also, I could not feel the towel on my skin. This was different. My body looked up at me and smiled…the eyes were dark. I fell into them.

I came to again, some time had passed but I could not tell how much. This time I had a view of my apartment building, from up in the sky. It was still night. I was floating, or maybe looking from the window of a nearby-by apartment block? But it wasn’t from ground level. I looked down…all went dark again.

Coming too after an indecipherable amount of time, I could see stars. No wait, it was the lights of the city. I recognized the city basin spreading all around me. It was as if I were coming into land in a plane at the airport. The cold air up here made me shiver, a hard wind blew. Darkness.

Flash to light. An image I recognized from somewhere. Yes…from an online video. It was like the view from the International Space Station. No, I wasn't quite that high, but the lights on the coasts looked like splashes of luminous milk. Too high for a person. This is wrong. My breaths came in short gasps in the thin air. I trembled in the ice-cold air until, mercifully – oblivion.

The Earth is a pale blue dot I’d heard, and it’s true. But to see that you have to be so so far out in space. And when I next came too, I could see it. It made no sense. How can I describe the vacuum and the cold of space? So so cold, like knives. The beauty of the pale blue dot instantly blurred as ice formed on my eyeballs. My lungs felt crushed from within. My chest… then darkness.

Our sun, a source of life, a yellow ball of nuclear explosions, warmed me for a moment, as I came to again, this time closer to the sun than to the Earth. Thankfully the flash to dark came quicker before I could sense anything but the faintest warmth.

The next time: light. So bright. A galaxy of stars across the blackness. All went dark again almost immediately.

Light. Something…vast… beyond my imagining…nebulae…gas clouds... Agony. Dark.

The strobing of light into dark got faster and faster, and my body began to shut down as I traveled into the infinite distances of space. 

To this day I am still traveling. All that is left is my consciousness, moving beyond the farthest reaches of our universe. Flickering into existence for milliseconds, and then nanoseconds, and then picoseconds, and then...times so short they cannot even be imagined. 

She is not with me, but she is in my heart. She types these words for me to send to you because I am her beloved. But also because she wants you to read them, so we can all be together.
