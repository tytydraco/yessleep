The sun rose blood red this morning. It’s because of the fires; there have been a lot in BC this year, which has made the distant air quiver with fumes. The dry scent drifted in from the window, permeating around the bed where I sat. My eyes stung from it. I don’t remember falling asleep last night. I just stared at the log wall, processing what happened outside our bedroom door.

The thought of calling the police had come several times throughout the night. I had tried calling once before, but it hadn’t gone through. I think that’s what made me hesitant to try again. I knew Edith was gone. There wasn’t any hope for her. *They’ll have to take us seriously,* I told myself. *A little girl is missing… they’ll drive out here for that. To help us.* 

It was already later in the evening when I called the Police department. I was on the edge of the bed, my heels pressed into the hard bed frame. The woman on the other end was kind, though her voice faded out frequently. I wasn’t able to catch her name. I gave our location, then did my best to report what happened last night. I told them that my sister had been attacked by a bear that had broken into the house. That she was now missing. I also mentioned the people watching from outside. My charger forced me to multitask while speaking. It was plugged into the outlet behind my bed—any time I shifted too far to the left it would come loose, then it would take a few tries of fiddling with the cord to get it working again. 

I wonder how much of what I was saying came across. After my recount, the phone line remained silent, without even a buzz. I sat there for another few moments, unsure of what to do. Eventually I decided to hang up, praying they’d be able to send help. 

Joelaine was in a state of lamenting. She didn’t look up at me even when I spoke to her. She lay hunched on the bed, the sheet under her face damp from her sobbing. Her sky blue eyes had become swollen with grey patches surrounding them. Hearing Edith’s final moments took a toll last night. It weighs on me too. 

The ‘cultists’ outside were still on the lawn, watching the cabin. I’ve monitored them throughout the day, trying to work out what they’re doing. All of them are dressed in black, some with white collars popping out around their necks. I noticed all the figures were men, and blonde from what I could make out. *What are they waiting for?* I wondered. It was like they were assembling for some sort of solemn event. The coffin-sized crate in the center of the group was especially strange. The rectangular lid was open, cast in torchlight as it lay face up on the ground.  

At around 6:00 p.m. the crowd’s behavior suddenly changed. I didn’t hear a shout or any communication among them. All at once they fled like birds across the lawn. They left the crate behind, as well as their torches, stabbed like spears in the earth. 

“What’s going on?” Joelaine asked from the bed. She hadn’t seen for herself but flinched at my sudden intake of breath, becoming just as alert. It took a moment before the sound of a police siren began blaring. The car was white with a pair of black stripes along its side. I spotted the word *POLICE* outlined in bright yellow as it pulled into the driveway and halted just ahead of my truck. 

My heart was beating like a drum as I watched the two officers step out of the vehicle. The sound of Joelaine going to open the door behind made me flinch. “Wait,” I said, jumping up and rushing over to clutch her arm, “let them come to us. We don’t know what’s waiting for us behind that door.” 

I held my sister close as we heard them downstairs rapidly knocking on the cabin door. “What if they don’t come up?” Joelaine’s hand was tight against my side. I could feel her fingers squeezing into me. “We need to get out of here.” 

“We will,” I promised. Moving back over to the window, I could see the empty police car. The passenger door was open ajar, where a laptop rested on the grey seat. “I gritted my teeth as I saw the pair of officers return from the front door, heading back towards their parked car. I was at a loss of what to do at that moment. I was terrified of the possibilities of what waited behind our door. 

Joelaine answered that question for me when I heard the door creak open. “Wait!” I heard her voice from the stairwell. “We’re in here!” The room was empty as I turned around. I could already hear her footsteps heading downstairs. I don’t know what I was expecting on the doorstep to our room. There was blood. It covered the floor like a wet mat. I will say, there were no remains of our sister.

The pair of officers met us on the deck outside. “I’m Officer Parks,” he introduced himself with a wave, “and this is my partner Officer Hanks. We saw the men you reported on the phone.” 

“They all ran off when we pulled up,” Hanks said, nodding towards me, “took off like a flock of crows. You mentioned these people tried to break into the house?”

“Yeah, we heard them the night before last,” I said, “they’re from the neighboring house across from us.” I gestured towards it. 

“Right, we were just about to head over there and have a look.” 

“Please no,” Joelaine shook her head, eyes wide. “Please just get us out of here.” 

“Officer Parks is going to stay with you,” Hanks said with a forced smile. “He’ll look after you. I’ll be back soon.” He pulled a black transceiver from his belt and pulled up the antenna. “Testing, testing.” 

We could hear his voice from Parks’ waist as Hanks headed towards the other house. Joelaine was avoiding my gaze. I wasn’t sure if she was upset with me. Still, I put my arm around her stiff shoulders, trying to comfort her. “We’re safe now,” I whispered, “we’re going to be ok.” 

My eyes were fixed on the white building. Hanks, reaching the front door, gave a firm knock. No response. Kneeling, he got out a toolkit from his belt and began working on the door. In less than a minute he had it open. 

I caught only a glimpse of the interior. Even at a distance I could see how open it was. If there were walls they had been knocked out, creating what looked like a massive warehouse-like space.

I answered Parks’ questions absentmindedly. *Did we actually see the bear? How long had we been planning to stay? Who did the cabin belong to? Were we hurt?*

“Dear god.” We all heard Hanks’ voice from Parks’ belt. 

“Hanks?” Parks called stepping forward, “what’s going on in there.” 

“Give me a few more minutes. I need to take some pictures.” He must have left the device on. We all heard his footsteps as he paced around inside, cursing under his breath. The sound of Hanks’ black heels fell short as a gasp escaped his lungs. “Oh, hello,” his voice switched to a lighter tone. “You surprised me. If you follow me I can get you out of here. I think your sisters are looking for you.”  

For the first time, Joeline’s eyes met mine. A sad glimmer of hope. A yell of shock followed from the device, coupled with the distinct blast of gunfire. Hanks screamed. 

“We need backup,” Parks snapped into his device. “How far did you say your group is behind us?” He frowned, tapping the transceiver a few times with his finger. “Do you read me?” 

Parks looked towards me, eyes betraying the panic. “Hold on,” he gestured us to wait, then sprinted towards the house without another word. 

He followed Hanks into the house. 

“Bea… we aren't alone out here.” I could feel it too. The eyes from the outskirts of the property. We weren't safe. I truly hoped Officer Parks made it out somehow, but we weren’t waiting around to find out. 

I have no idea how to drive a police car, or if it’s any different from a regular car. I never got the chance to find out. As a dark figure emerged onto our path, I steered Joelaine in the opposite direction towards the field outside the cabin. I looked back at him over my shoulder as we continued to run. I could see his pink tongue licking his lips. He made no move to follow. More men in black emerged from the cabin doors as we ran past. Joelaine stumbled on an overgrown weed. I grabbed her shoulder, heaving her up as we continued into the tall grass. Despite her injured leg she was doing well keeping pace with me. 

As we got further into the center of the lawn I could see the coffin ahead. My eyes peered at the rim as we approached, my curiosity straining to get a glimpse of what was in the casket. The inside was red velvet. What I hadn’t seen from the window was the body of a little girl. 

“Edith,” Joelaine cried out in a sobbing voice. 

“We can’t stop,” I grabbed her, forcefully dragging her on. It was difficult to not look at the face. We had to go on. There wasn’t any time. We made it to the gravel road and kept running. As I looked over my shoulder, I could see the men far behind. I think they gave up following us. 

I mentioned previously that the closest town is a half hour drive from the cabin. I think I know the way, left at the end of our street, then the road goes on without turning until we reach it. We reached the road and ran, leaving the cabin behind us.

The screen of my phone is too bright now that it’s getting darker. If the men are still following… I’m scared someone will see it. For that reason I won’t be answering any messages until tomorrow. I don’t know when I’ll be online next… probably not until we reach help. Until then, thank you for keeping up with this. We’re going to keep moving. Goodnight everyone,

Beatrice.
