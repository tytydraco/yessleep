Looking back, it must have started about a year ago.   
  
I had gotten in a minor accident while riding my bike and had a good amount of road rash on my arms and legs. I was sitting at the kitchen table picking my scabs and complaining to my wife, Claire, about how badly my wounds were itching as they healed when she did something completely out of character.   
  
She reached across the table and dragged her fingernail across a patch of scabs, ripping them open and drawing blood.   
  
“There, now you won’t think about the itching so much,” she said cheerily as she stood up from the table and cleared our breakfast plates.   
  
Stunned, I pressed a napkin to my now bleeding wound and watched her bring our plates over to the kitchen sink. I was about to say something, when she did something even stranger. She raised her finger to her mouth and licked my blood off of it, then she pulled her finger back for a moment, noticed the clump of scabs she’d accumulated under her fingernail and popped her finger back in her mouth and sucked to wrest them free.   
  
Disgusted, I got ready for work and left without saying goodbye.   
  
From that point on Claire started changing, quickly.   
  
I don’t know what brought it on. We’re a relatively boring couple, but I always assumed she was as happy as I was with the relationship, that is until she started hurting me.   
  
I’d be chopping vegetables for our dinner when mid-chop she’d walk by and ‘accidently’ bump into me causing me to cut my hand.   
  
One night I was walking up the stairs behind her, both of us headed for bed, when her glass of water ‘slipped’ out of her hand, showering the hardwood staircase in water and broken glass. I cut my feet up pretty bad on that one.   
  
Once we came home from a friend’s dinner party and she asked me if I wanted to keep drinking. Hoping to get lucky that night, I said ‘of course’ and she asked me to pull down a bottle wine we kept on top of our refrigerator. Only thing is she didn’t tell me she had put a few mousetraps up there surrounding the wine bottle. She said she’d forgotten. I was lucky I only broke one finger.   
  
Even in the bedroom I wasn’t safe with her. Her playful love bites had turned into fierce puncture wounds that dug deep and brought up rivulets of blood. She would claw at my back with her once gentle fingers, each digit leaving a crimson trail in its wake.   
  
I’d wake up at night to find her gently suckling on one of my cut fingers trying to coax out a fresh stream of hot blood.  
  
Once I woke up to a sharp pain in my back, but pretended to still be asleep. She was carefully, slowly, attempting to peel a scab off of my back from one of her ‘love scratches’ as she called them. When the scab finally gave free and a new stream of red flowed from the wound, she lowered her mouth to my back and quietly lapped it up, then as if to treat herself to a nice dessert, she popped the scab into her mouth and swallowed before turning over to go to sleep.   
  
I brought it up to her the next day. She said I was dreaming. Maybe I was. Maybe I am. I sure hope so.   
It slowed down for a while. I was healing and she wasn’t trying to hurt me anymore. Sometimes I wonder if I’m thinking back with rose colored glasses. Maybe I was just more careful around her by that time. A harder target. We definitely weren’t fucking anymore by then.   
  
Either way, things got better for a while. I still love Claire. It’d take more than a few bumps and bruises to change that.   
  
I wanted to surprise her.   
  
I set up a picnic for us on the overlook near Sunset Rock where we had our first date. We’d ride our bikes up, find the picnic my buddy Bryce had set-up for us, have a nice lunch, then have our usual race down the mountain where I would always let her win.   
  
It was perfect. The weather, the food (shoutout Bryce) and finally having Claire back to her normal self. We hit a rough patch, but together we navigated those rocky waters and would come out the other side stronger. That’s marriage.  
  
About halfway through the lunch Claire got a call and held a finger up to me to let me know she’d only be a minute as she walked back towards our bikes to take the call. I remember that moment so clearly, I laid out on grass, let the sun warm my face and thought how I hadn’t been so happy in such a long time.   
  
After we had eaten and had a little bit of fun out in the woods (no scratches this time) Bryce came, picked up our picnic supplies and wished us a good day.   
  
Back to her playful self, Claire shot me a sideways glance, “Last one to the bottom is a rotten egg,” before darting off towards our bikes.   
  
She was already two pedals in by the time I reached my bike and I quickly hopped on and headed down after her.   
  
I didn’t realize what was wrong until it was too late.   
  
The brakes on my bike had given out.   
  
To spare the details - I’m paralyzed now. From the nipples down.   
  
The first few weeks in the hospital were hell on Earth. Constant tests and needles and beeps and shitty food and the absolute embarrassment of having a stranger wipe your ass for you.   
  
I begged Claire to take me home every day.   
  
A few weeks ago, that day finally arrived. Claire was so good to me. She propped me up in the bed, brought me food, washed me, changed me. She turned away unwanted guests and did her best to make me feel comfortable in my weakened state.   
  
But it was still hard for me. Long days of bed rest and television only punctuated by phone calls from acquaintances who’d only just gotten the news and wanted to feel like patting themselves on the back for doing a good deed.   
  
The nights were worse. It was the dreams. Always the same one. I’m walking through a forest. The sun hasn’t yet burned off the morning fog and the ground is still damp with dew. With each step I can hear the wet crunch of dead leaves and pine straw under my heavy boots and every now and then I hear a loud *POP!* as a twig snaps somewhere behind me. I never turn around in the dream because I already know I’m not alone.  
  
I always wake up from that dream crying. Mourning the loss of my legs, my career, my hobbies, the life I had planned. All stolen in an instant. Within seconds Claire is there, holding me in the darkness, and she comforts me until I’m back asleep.   
  
It was a long time before I even looked at my legs. I despised them. Dead weight. I’d look at the two pathetic lumps under my blanket and feel the anger bubbling up inside of me. I wanted to yell at them, scold them, tell them ‘I never needed you anyway!’.   
  
I pushed myself up and pulled back the blanket to reveal two useless limbs wrapped in thick layers of gauze and bandages. I grabbed at the hunks of dead meat and started to lift my legs at the thigh to try and pull my stupid, broken feet closer to me so I could rip off the gauze and really let them have it, when I heard a ringing.   
  
I stopped for a moment then noticed there was a bell on my wrist attached with a bracelet that said W.W.J.D? Claire must have put it there so I could ring when I need help. She really is good to me.   
I got back to the task at hand – pulling my worthless legs within arm’s reach so I can unmask them and tell them what I really think of them. It sounds dumb but I really needed a catharsis.   
  
After minutes of straining, I’m sweating and nearly out of breath but I manage to pull one of the freeloaders close. I started ripping at its protective bandages when Claire burst into the room.  
  
“What are you doing?” She cries, “We need to keep them wrapped for circulation! The last thing you need is a blood clot!”   
  
I felt bad. What was I doing? Ruining her hard work so I can chastise a few lumps of bone and flesh? I apologized to her and with all the grace in the world she forgave me and handed me a sleeping pill which I took greedily.   
  
Before I knew it, I was back in that forest. Walking around on two feet. Enjoying the fresh morning air and the listening to the triumphant sounds of my own locomotion. I came love this dream and prayed I would have it every night no matter how hard it made the mornings, but just like everything else in my life – it was taken from me.   
  
I woke up in the pitch darkness of my bedroom. I stared dumbly at the ceiling for a moment, then closed my eyes and tried to will myself back into the forest.   
  
*POP!* I hear a twig snap. Followed by the wet crunching of damp plant matter under my feet.   
  
Only I’m not sleeping.   
  
I open my eyes and stare again at the ceiling listening to the wet crunches that periodically fill my ears.   
  
Eventually my eyes adjust to the light.   
  
Claire is kneeling at the foot of my bed. Blood drips from her mouth as she chews on a mouthful of gore. The sound reminds me of walking through a forest after a rain.   
  
She chews carefully and with great thought behind it, like she wants to decode the complex flavor of an expensive wine. Eventually she swallows and turns her attention back to my leg. She lowers her face to it and sniffs before wrapping her mouth around a toe and biting down hard – *POP!* It comes off fully into her mouth.   
  
I twitch at this and the bell on my wrist rings.   
  
Claire’s head jolts lightening quick to my face and despite my fear I don’t move a muscle.   
  
She swallows and takes the next 30 minutes changing my bandages. Before she leaves the room to clean up and brush her teeth, she bends down and kisses me on the forehead before wiping her kiss off gently with a damp dishrag.   
  
She’s asleep next to me now as I type this.   
  
I know some of you are going to tell me to leave. To call the police or maybe even strangle my wife in her sleep, but I’m not going to do that.   
  
I love Claire. I know you’ll think I’m crazy, but I’m not going to leave her. She breaks her back for me every day, she works to make me comfortable, to pay our bills and keep a roof over our head. When we got married, we made a vow to support one another through sickness and in health and to give oneself to each other completely.   
  
If she can make the sacrifices she’s making for me, then I sure as hell can give up a couple of non-functioning appendages.   
  
Although, I do wonder as I sit here watching her sleep, do you think after she’s taken both of my legs, she’ll want more?
