The beams of our flashlights cut through the darkness of the forest, bouncing off trunks that sprouted upwards into crooked limbs - a tangled canopy bracing the starlight.

“Turn them out.”

I spoke out to my partner, Jones, voice dampened in the overwhelming nature. The miasma of pine, the darkness, the biting cold - the forest is an ocean that drowns out all semblance of civilization, makes a human so minute. Invariably it proved itself as to why I’d never gotten used to search and rescue missions, the anxiety never dwindling since my first. We hadn’t found him. We wouldn’t find his remains either. And so many of the missing would be left undiscovered after him - terrified, cold, and desperate in my haunted imagination, not a soul to heed the memory of their last words. Nature might always take us in hand with time but to see it do so in such a meaningless, sweeping fashion - you never get used to it. Not even knowing them aside from campsite scraps and phone calls from family members only accented it. Snapped out of existence.

We shut off our flashlights, the click diminished between the snapping of fallen foliage beneath our feet and insect chatter yet so poignant in its comparative artifice. Unspoken but unanimously supposed, we’d finally approached the surrounding area of where we’d first spotted the waning glow of firelight and the smoke that had trailed above in provocatively rhythmic plumes. A signal. It had been quite far off from the tower and by now wind and time might’ve snuffed it’s flame; the pitch darkness of the night might aid us in our unnerved search for both its embers and maker. Our beams and calls had gone unanswered and with the unrelenting weight of those lost before, we were desperate for any sign of life left to find.

Tirelessly we searched for even a flicker stirred awake by a breeze, my eyes wide and strained as if to overpower the swathing murk and visual snow. Eventually, we came to a clearing, littered with tatters of orange polyester sown about the ruins of two small tents - both empty. The poles were snapped and outstretched from the carnage like briar and the sleeping bags inside each were both swept halfway out as if the owners had leapt out in some frantic escape. Though both were in quite wary states, one tent appeared to be less violently defiled. 

“Must be our guy.”

We chalked up the signal to have come from the less ravaged (or sole survivor) of this apparent animal attack. But as we scoped the rest of the site - which was fairly pristine despite some personal effects such as a cheap acoustic guitar, some sealed packets of food, two pairs of shoes, and backpacks from the tents - we found no sign of a recently lit fire. There was a small circle of stones with a patch of ash at the center, though it was far too cold and devoid of fuel to have been used within the hour.

Something stirred in the brush behind us.

Jones and I turned our flashlights in brisk unison - him brandishing a canister of bear mace in the other hand - to seek out what might’ve made the noise. From behind a tree, a man meekly revealed himself. His back was pressed to the tree as he did so, carefully turning toward us with one hand up and the other gestured into a hushing finger against his lips. He had no coat and no shoes and his wide eyes were darkened with restless, harrowing fear as they probed the tree line behind us. Must be our guy.

He drew closer, wobbling like a fawn, and spoke in a low whisper, grabbing our coats as if we’d slip away and leave him alone again, hiding forever in a dank pocket between the trees. The biting unease that weighted itself in the pit of my stomach was enough to still me.

“Please - I - you have to help me. It took my friend. I-I thought no one would ever find me. I thought it would take me too. I prayed when I saw the light. Thank God. Thank God it was you.”

Jones gently grabbed the man’s wrist and softened his astonished gaze. 

“You’re safe with us. We have to prioritize getting you back to base but I promise you we’ll dispatch another team for your friend.”

The man nodded frantically as he sobbed into his hand - clasped tightly over his mouth as he tried to muffle himself, chest heaving beneath his torn, white undershirt.

“Please, please get me out of h-here. It’s still out there. We need to - to go now.”

The truck was parked a little ways away since we’d gotten out to search on foot but it wouldn’t be too far and he seemed un-injured besides a few scrapes. He was already pulling Jones along with no regard as he urged the man to settle down and at least put his shoes on. As I followed shortly behind, I glanced back and saw the brief flutter of settling embers not far off in the distance, golden and faint.

He cried quietly between us, holding our sleeves with wet hands that he’d use to intermittently stifle himself as we traversed back through the wake of whence we’d came. 

“H-he wanted to s-stay home this weekend. It’s my fault. I was s-so stupid.”

His guilt seemed to physically pain him, making his breaths sharp and his steps clumsily falter as we snaked through moss-slicked roots. I placed a hand on his shoulder to steady him as Jones spoke softly.

“It isn’t your fault. We have to focus on getting you somewhere safe, alright? And when it came down to it, you did what you could. It was a smart move to signal us with that fire.”

The man staggered for a moment and stilled. He stood there, choking up, before he fell to a crouch as he wretched helplessly into his arms, hugging himself tightly as his body convulsed. Though I was equally taken aback, I looked at Jones disapprovingly, brow raised and lips pulled into a tight frown. He shrugged me off. He meant well but emotionally provoking him when we hadn’t even gotten him back to the truck would only lengthen the already arduous situation. He bent down and pulled the man up slowly, murmuring apologies as he tried to placate him. 

“I- dear God. I didn’t- a fire?”

The man continued whispering to himself incoherently as Jones and I exchanged concerned glances, pushing on. This man was confused and afraid - we needed to get him secured and we couldn’t risk him breaking down further. It was a crisp night typical of early Pacific Northwestern autumn and the cold seemed to set in harsher despite the wind having become entirely placid; stagnant air that bore the heaviness of a humid heat but stung with a chill like snow whipping against your skin. The entire forest around us had seemed to freeze over in fact, dead silence stressing the crackle beneath our footfall that made the man twitch and hurriedly peek about us with trembling paranoia.

My skin prickled with beads of cold, feverish sweat as we finally caught sight of the truck from between the thicket. Jones and the man were in no better of a state, their lips pale and their eyes ringed with a sickly blush - I was quite sure I looked just as worn, the waves of chills keeping me lucid between the sudden rush of faintness. My ears rang as we trudged onward toward the truck, every step feeling a mile between and each crackle beneath seeming to reverberate like a record skipping until the sound blended into an uneasy constant. I hadn’t noticed but we’d each put an arm on the shoulder of whoever walked beside us - the man at the very center - and he had started to bear the weight of us, pulling us along as his pace quickened.

“No, PLEASE! Please, please we’re almost there. You have to keep going.”

The crackling swarmed my senses with a heat that began to burn like sun rays soaking into your hair on a bright day and weighed down like a cough syrup delirium: comforting until prolonged, comforting until the unease surfaces. My vision began to darken at the edges, the vignette pulsing with my heart before steadying to a pinpoint as I was suddenly leaned up against the hood of the truck. The man sat Jones in the backseat but he fell over, shivering and glossy with a thick perspiration. As Jones lie there he seemed to try to make himself smaller, dazed and unblinking as he sank himself as deep into the seats as he could manage. I followed his unbroken gaze out to where the tree line began against the dirt road and watched as it emerged.

My vision hadn’t only darkened, the glow of the moonlight itself seemed to be taken away, leaving a paper gibbous strung up in the sky. The trees, the shrubbery, the dirt - everything felt like a prop in that dense air - miniatures scaled to size and appearing sticky to the touch like plastic and cheap acrylic. The thing itself approached and stopped at the edge of the lot about thirty feet away, its gait graceful between awkward swaying. My chest tightened each time it faltered, it looked so deliberate and as it bent as if it would fall, it felt almost as if it were breaking into a stalking position. It wasn’t as you might think, grinning with a mouth “too wide” with teeth “too sharp” or with eyes “too large”. It just watched. Raw, puffy skin around sunken eyes and the shadows of its thin mouth deepened by what seemed to be smile lines, though it was completely expressionless. It was pale and thin and hazy, almost mistakable as a sliver of moonlight between a gap in the trees had it not been swaying. Its torso bent like a starved dog and I noted that if I’d turned my back to enter the truck, its limbs were long enough that it might close the distance between us before I could even shut the door.

Something clicked behind me. Keeping my body completely still, I turned my head slowly to see the man sitting in the driver's seat, tears pouring down his face as his eyes shifted to his left - he had opened the passenger door for me. I turned to look back at the thing and it felt as if my heart might’ve jumped from my chest. It was on all fours. Almost. It had moved so that its bottom half was pointed to the floor while its upper half faced up, watching me with its head cocked and lips parted. Once I had looked at it again, it had stopped its contorting with one arm in the air, perfectly still. Describing it in retrospect it sounds almost comical but in that moment I could barely get myself to move, my central body was immeasurably tensed with agonizing fear while my limbs tingled and numbed, like the blood had gone from them. I took a step back and its mouth slacked wider. I had locked eyes with it but I could see its torso shift a bit, its chest twisting as it lowered its arm to brace the pine litter beneath it. Its bottom half writhed like a cat obscured in underbrush, waiting to pounce. I took another step. It drew closer to me - a large stride in a single sick movement - its mouth widening. 

As its mouth widened I heard a soft crackling. Like a campfire being gently stoked. The inside of its mouth glimmered and for a moment my stomach turned at the thought that the thing might be salivating until something floated from its mouth. An ember. The crackling grew louder though more hollow, resonating in its throat like an insect carapace. I imagined its vocal cords combed and vibrating like the legs of a cricket rubbing against itself. The glow in its mouth brightened with the noise and everything around dimmed in and out like an old incandescent lightbulb until the forest was totally black, only the pallid figure of the creature barely visible. 

Everything had gone blurry again - dizzy and dreamlike. All light and life taken and pouring from its gaping maw, the crackling reached such a harsh cacophony it sounded like that of a wildfire raging as it crawled to wipe out Earth itself. I could hear flames whip against each other as they blended with the polyphony of what seemed to be hundreds of anguished screams and the ringing in my ears. I could hear hides sear to bubbling in blinding conflagration, smell bone blacken to ash. It moved so slowly, twisting against itself in the haze of smoke like a ritual dance as multiple wan, glistening arms swayed rhythmically from its sides. They bore the sight of wet newborn flesh in stark juxtaposition to the rough and ancient skin encasing the rest of it - slick wax against the bark of an old birch. Its face was obscured behind the cerement of light blooming between its unhinged jaws so I could only make out the glint in the dark dilations of its pupils that bore into me with ravenous want. Everything around was pitch black and the vast forest seemed to shrink to nothing but a scalding sepulcher holding only it and I. It was a mere ten feet away when I was pulled into the truck.

The man quickly and awkwardly scooted himself over the center console as he hauled me by the arm into the passenger seat. He hit the gas immediately - the truck had been set to go though I hadn’t noticed both due to my delirious trance and the headlights refusing to turn on. He drove directly into where the thing had been as he circled the lot but it had vanished. He breathed heavily and shuddered out a panicked laugh as we chased the plastic moon over the dirt roadway, speeding down like a bat from jet black Hell. His breathing ceased abruptly into a wincing quaver as something scratched at the roof of the truck, my teeth grinding at the metal screeching. 

From just above the windscreen I saw a brief shock of white skin before something began to bang at the roof with such strength and mania that it dented on impact. Multiple bangs and dents littered the roof before two fists beat against the windscreen and then another pair after, shattering the glass into splitting fragments. The man braked and the truck halted, Jones slamming against the backs of our seats with a gurgled yelp at the rapid stop. The creature flew off the roof and slammed onto the stretch of road before us. It twitched as it rose and steadied itself on its now only two arms - bones clicking in place beneath defined strains of muscle - and turned its head up at us, staring directly into my eyes. Its mouth began to open. Before the dust could even settle beneath it, the man stomped the gas again.

“No. NO! FUCK YOU!”

It scrambled out of the way on its stretched limbs just before we could hit it and again we took off. I looked out of my window and watched in abject terror as it ran on two legs alongside the truck, peering in with pupils that threatened to break the iris, a gleam behind the thin flesh of its lips like sunlight between the edges of fingers. I reached into the backseat and began to roll my window down as I brushed against it clumsily, still dazed in the flushing afterglow of delirium. My fingers finally circled around it.

“WHAT ARE YOU DOING?”

The man yelled as he attempted to roll it back up with the driver's switch. 

“PLEASE TRUST ME. JUST DRIVE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.”

The bewildered look on his face melted into a hard stare, lips pursed as he fixated on the road again. I rolled the window down as embers began to spill from its mouth, sideways with the wind as it ran with no delay in speed. I aimed the canister of bear mace directly into its eyes and held down until I was sure I’d emptied it. It didn’t relent - for a moment long enough that desperate tears came to my eyes and I choked out a despaired cry, it didn’t relent. Aside from a veil of tears, the world became hazy again. Arms tore from its back as it used its front two to wipe at its eyes with pained vigor. Between swiping at its face it shot me a seething glare that smeared in dizzy frames in the haze, animal anger and eldritch hatred settling into my core as it let out aching rasps.

The man whooped incredulously beside me as he heard it and I turned to see him grin. As I did, the creature thumped the ledge of the window with one of its hands and for the final time we locked eyes, its mouth tugged up and open as it tried to smile as well - a mockery and a promise. Its teeth were squared and long like an herbivore’s but marred by a pristineness and density that suggested a sinister bearing. It stumbled then as it sank its crooked fingers into one socket and tore, splattering dark blood against the window as I had frantically gone to roll it back up. It stopped there and I craned my neck to watch as it slammed itself against the ground, limbs both crawling aimlessly and tearing at its face as it wailed ungodly noises into the night. It made me gag. Screams of men and women and children that overlapped. Laughter and agony all at once that provoked such pulsing melancholy and dread in my chest that might have never ceased had the discord not quietened as we distanced further away. I caught only a glimpse of it spasming like a crushed roach before clambering back into the pine. 

Daniel - as I’d find the man’s name to be - got us out that night. The headlights only came on once we exited the park. The sun only rose then as well. From there he drove us straight to a hospital, never stopping or slowing. Jones had bitten through his tongue just before I’d been pulled into the car and in the end, showed symptoms of a severe stroke. I tried to stay in touch with his family (he could no longer speak or effectively communicate in any way aside from moans and pointing) but ultimately they were overtaken by the loss of who he’d once been and became reclusive. I’d only seen his eldest daughter once in town - probably to buy something the family couldn’t have delivered - her sallow face blank and aged beyond her sixteen years. I couldn’t find it in me to approach her. Daniel and I didn’t tell anyone of what we truly saw. A bear attack had taken his friend and on our way back as we recovered him, Jones collapsed. The bear returned and mangled up the truck as we tried to settle Jones inside. That’s what we told everyone. That half-assed story. Jones’ wife could barely hold eye contact through welling tears and the hatred I felt for myself as I lied through my teeth felt like an eternity of penance. 

I returned to the watchtower once in the evening to recover my things. I left immediately when I saw a plume of black smoke rolling over the treetops. Hell incarnate or college kids having a bonfire, I didn’t care - I’d quit and it wasn’t my responsibility anymore. That forest could burn down. I returned in the morning about a week later to see the new ranger painting over deep gashes that had been carved into the outer walls of the utility shed, the same marking the base of the tower all the way up to the door at the top. She spoke to me cheerfully though her words blended into gibberish as I walked away in a dizzy stupor, telling her to be careful. Literally just, “Be careful.” What else could I say? I know it’s ridiculous but I hope she might find this post. That she’ll leave and never return within even a mile radius of that godforsaken forest. It might not even help.

 As I write this, part of it from my home just at the wooded outskirts of town, I warn all of you to be wary of the forest. Whatever it might’ve been, if there’s only one or multiple, just please trust that it or things alike are out there. Before sunrise this morning, I heard something scratching at my fence line. Tonight, I heard it along the downstairs walls. I called the cops and they made it out in just a little less than an hour. They didn’t find anything besides the scratches - deep and jagged from the facade to the back - and apprehensively blamed it on a frenzied deer or some ne’er-do-well vagrant. Eyeing up my disheveled appearance and the muddle of bottles scattered about every room in my home, they also questioned if I’d been drinking that night. The pity didn’t quite mask the undertone of accusation. I wanted to scream, to cry out until my throat bled and let them wheel me into a padded cell. But instead, I left. 

I’m finishing this up from a grocery store parking lot and come morning, I’m getting in contact with a real estate agent and putting that house up for sale - put the money towards some cheap apartment. Any rundown shithole will do, I’ll take anything. I’ll live out of my car until then. Call me a coward. For lying on the plight of one of my best friends, wife and children circling his bed - perpetual tears ever-warm in the cold, astringent hospital air. For getting tongue-tied as the rookie brushed over gashes that wouldn’t fill, bright-eyed and beaming with the excitement of novelty as she tried to make small talk. For holing up just to run - run away from it all. But you’d have done the same had you seen it. An ember floating down the eave of my roof. Peeking down over the ridge as the police halfheartedly searched the yard. A sliver of moonlight with a smile.
