"Oh fuck we're fucked oh fuck we're fucked oh fuck we're fucked," Tony kept rapidly repeating beside me in the backseat. He'd doing it for almost an hour now, a fearful, repetitive chant, and it was getting on all our already-frayed nerves; me especially because I was sitting right next to him.

Brian in the front passenger seat was still desperately trying to find a signal on his phone. "It just doesn't make any sense!" he said in disbelief, not for the first time, although he wasn't nearly as bad off as Tony...not yet anyway. "I'm not getting *shit* on this fucking thing!"

Liam, who was driving, wasn't saying much of anything. In fact, he hadn't said a word since immediately after we encountered that...that *thing* in the road. That had been nearly an hour earlier, and it was long gone, many miles behind us, but our nightmare hadn't ended, its scope had just widened. Liam was just focused on the blackness ahead of us, but I could tell he was just as scared as the rest of us. His face was expressionless, but his lips were clenched in a tight, grim line and his eyes had a glint of fear in them.

Brian finally threw down his useless phone with a disgusted exclamation of "FUCK!" He turned around to face me. "What about your phone?"

I didn't answer him in words, just shook my head. He'd already asked me that too, and it was the same answer I gave before. My phone also didn't have a signal. None of ours did.

Brian turned back around and impulsively turned the radio on. He turned the dial, trying to find a station, *any* station, just the reassuring sound of another human voice...but there was only silence. Not even static, just empty, dead air.

"Oh fuck we're fucked oh fuck we're fucked oh fuck we're fucked..." Tony went on and on, a look of desperate horror - no, it was probably closer to pure terror - on his face. He was rocking back and forth mindlessly, his hands clutching his midsection. He seemed to have reverted in age, reduced from a man in his late twenties to a very young, frightened boy who fully believed that, contrary to his parents' assurances, there really *was* a monster lurking in the shadows of his closet, and a boogeyman hiding beneath his bed, waiting for him to fall asleep.

*"Tony will you SHUT THE FUCK UP!"* Brian shouted at him, finally snapping.

Tony flinched. He stopped babbling, but then started to weep quietly, pathetically. In spite of how scared I was, I couldn't help but feel a flash of sympathy for him. He'd always been the youngest and most immature of the four of us.

I turned and look out my window but could see nothing but blackness beyond the glass...a murky blackness darker than night itself. I strained my eyes but could make out nothing beyond; no sign of the road or the passing countryside, no starry night sky or moon. It is as if the blackness had swallowed the world beyond our car.

I could feel my fear increasing, threatening to overwhelm me and become full-out panic...and then I'd become a blubbering mess like poor Tony. I tried to fight it back and keep calm, stay rational. I told myself there had to be a logical explanation for what was happening to us...but nothing I could come up with made sense. And that woman - no, that *thing* that *looked* like a woman...

My thoughts drifted back to that. That was when it had all begun. As if it had been some kind of terrible milestone, a marker separating our lives as they had been up until then, the normal, uneventful, sane and orderly lives of four old college buddies reunited to attend their former frat brother's wedding, from the hellish nightmare it would soon become.

We should never have taken that fucking detour. We never would have *had* to if Liam, who had a phobia of driving on the interstate, hadn't insisted on taking the highway instead, even though it meant a longer journey. We had tried reasoning with him, but he would not be swayed. We even offered to take turns driving for him, but he was touchy about others driving his car and refused. Besides, he had offered as a counterargument, a longer trip would give us more time to catch up; we hadn't seen each other in years. And he had a point. Besides, it only added a few extra hours each way. It wasn't like we had a choice, anyway. Driving was cheaper than flying, and he had been Eddie's best friend in college - and was also going to be his best man - so he had the final say. We had to trust his judgment. He had promised to make it up to us by throwing the greatest bachelor party we had ever seen.

Everything had been fine until we came upon the large, orange ROAD CLOSED AHEAD, USE DETOUR sign beside the road, and a little further ahead, another sign with an arrow pointing down a somewhat narrower road branching off of the main highway.

We had groaned and bitched, but Liam, had pushed on, telling us there was nothing wrong with taking the scenic route. We still had plenty of time to get there; the wedding was until the day after tomorrow ("There better fuckin be strippers" had been Brian's only grumbled remark).

We had driven on the back road, which had taken us into the woods. The road was poorly maintained and bumpy, littered with potholes, causing Liam's car to shake and jump every few minutes.

A half hour passed uneventfully. There was nothing but dense trees on either side of us. We hadn't seen a single sign of civilization, not a house, not another car, not another person, since we'd gotten off the highway.

"Where the fuck are we anyway?" Brain had asked, more bored than concerned, casually peering out the passenger-side window. "I haven't seen a single fucking sign since we got on this road."

We had tried pinpointing our location using the GPS apps on our phones...and that was when we realized none of us could get a signal.

"What the fuck is this shit?" Brian said in irritation, staring at his useless phone.

"Guess we're in a mobile dead zone," I had said, putting my own phone back in my pocket. "Must be *way* out in the boonies."

"Shit!" Brian had snapped in disgust. He was always the most wired of us.

"There's a roadmap in the glovebox," Liam told him without taking his eyes off the deserted road winding through the forest. "See if you can find a way back to the highway on it."

Brian took out the map and unfolded it. He studied it for about five minutes. "Liam," he said finally, "how old is this map?"

"Just a year or two. Why?"

"Because I'm not seeing this road on it," Brian had told him. And for the first time I had noticed the faintest trace of disquiet in his voice.

"It's gotta be there somewhere. Keep looking," Liam had said.

Brian had looked for another five minutes then thrown down the map. "Nothing! I don't know where the fuck we are!"

"Great," Tony had chimed in at that point, "so you're saying we lost?"

"Tony, shut the fuck up," Brian told him flatly.

"This road's gotta take us back to the highway eventually," Liam had confidently reassured us. No need to freak out."

"I'm bored, can we at least hear some music?" Tony had asked.

Liam had turned on the radio, which had been off up to that point...but there had been nothing but silence emanating from the speakers. He turned the dial all the way to the end but hadn't been able to pick up a station.

"Are you fucking *kidding* me?" Brian had exclaimed beside him in frustration.

"What is it?" I had asked.

"Radio's fucked," Liam answered.

"Maybe there's just not a station close enough to pick up," I said.

"No, we should still be hearing static."

"So what the fuck are we going to do?" Brain said.

"We could play a game to pass the time," Tony suggested. "How about Count the Cars?"

"Do you *see* any other cars to count, Tony?" Brian had asked him with sarcastic brightness and gestured out the window.

"How about I Spy?" Tony offered next.

"I spy with my little eye a dumbass in the back seat who better shut the fuck up if he doesn't want me to climb back there and kick his teeth in," Brain growled at him menacingly.

Tony took the hint and fell silent.

Nothing much happened for the next hour. We continued on the road, and there was still nothing but wilderness all around us. The sun gradually set and darkness fell. Then Liam had spotted the figure walking about ten yards ahead.

"Hey!" Liam said, surprised, and slammed on the brakes. The car jerked to a halt.

"What the fuck is she doing?" I said.

It was a woman. That much was obvious. She was barefoot, wearing only a dirty white nightgown. Long black hair hung down her back. She had her back to us and was staggering with a wobbly, unsteady gait along the shoulder of the road.

"Bitch must be wasted," Brian muttered.

"Maybe she was in an accident," Liam said with a note of concern. "She might need help."

"I'll go see if she's okay," Tony said, taking off his seatbelt. He got out and approached the shuffling figure. We watched as he spoke to her. She didn't respond to his questions. He put his hand on her shoulder to get her attention. She didn't react; just pulled away from him and continued to move forward with her strange, slow shuffle. Finally, he stepped in front in her, facing her. He recoiled from her instantly, as if repelled by an electric shock. He fell backwards on his ass, scrambling away from her on his hands like a crab. His eyes were wide with an almost comical expression of shocked horror. He lunged upright and, skirting the woman, sprinted back to the car. slamming his door shut.

"Drive, drive!" he started shouting, hysterical with panic.

"What the fuck happened?" Brian demanded.

"We need to get out of here now!" Tony screamed.

"Tony, what's wrong with you?" Liam asked, bewildered.

"Just GO!" Tony shouted.

Then Brian was the one to begin shouting.

"OH FUCK WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?" He was looking out the passenger window. Me and Liam turned to follow his gaze.

The dark-haired woman was standing motionless, just a couple feet outside the car. Just a few seconds before she had still been about a hundred feet away. We hadn't seen her move; she was just *there*. She was looking at us.

Well, she *would* have been if she had eyes, or any facial features at all for that matter. Where her face should have been, there was just an oval of perfectly smooth, blank skin. No eyes. No nose. No mouth.

Then we all started freaking out, screaming in unison.

"OH JESUS CHRIST, DRIVE, LIAM! *DRIVE*!" Brian shouted at him.

Liam slammed down on the gas and with a shriek of rubber, the car shot away like a bullet exiting the barrel of a gun.

Our hearts racing, we looked back, watching through the rear window as the woman - no, the *thing* we had thought to be a woman - receded into the night.

I exchanged a scared look with Brian. Tony began rocking back and forth, muttering to himself, completely rattled by what had just happened.

"What the fuck *was* that thing?" Brain demanded, almost accusingly, as if he really expected any of us to have an answer.

"She didn't have a face. Oh, fuck man, she didn't have a fuckin *face*," Tony murmured.

"How could she breathe without a nose or a mouth?" Brian wondered out loud. "How could she even be *alive*?"

Liam said nothing. He just drove, staring straight ahead with a wide-eyed look of horrified disbelief.

"Maybe it was some kind of mask," I said, hopefully. "You know, some kind of stupid prank."

"Yeah," Brain said, latching onto that idea and nodding enthusiastically, desperately wanting to believe it. "That's probably what it was."

Liam said nothing. Tony kept talking to himself.

Some time passed. No one spoke. Then, at some point, we realized something else strange. Brian noticed it first.

"What the fuck happened to the woods?"

"Huh?" I said.

"Look out the windows! The trees are all gone!"

I did. He was right. Before, there had been enough moonlight to see the outline of the darkened trees that lined both sides of the road. Now, there was only solid blackness. And the trees weren't the only thing gone. I glanced up...and could no longer seen the night sky. No clouds, no stars, no moon. Nothing but blackness. As if all the car's windows had been covered by sheets of black felt.

I could feel dread growing like a tumor in my chest. I looked through the windshield. The headlights illuminated the road for only about twenty yards ahead of us. After that, they were swallowed by the darkness.

"What is this shit?" Brian said, and there was no mistaking the fear in his voice. Fear that was nearly panic.

"Oh fuck, we're fucked. Oh fuck, we're fucked," Tony began to repeat beside me.

And so it had gone on for almost an hour. At least that's what the dashboard clock said. I couldn't say if it actually *had* been an hour; it felt much longer. It felt like we'd been driving for days. Or months. Or years. As if the terrible, unnatural blackness outside the car had slowed time down to a crawl.

And then, as if things weren't bad enough, they suddenly got worse.

Liam, who had been silent for over an hour, spoke for the first time since our encounter with the faceless woman by the side of the road.

"Oh, no," he said with a dismayed groan.

"What is it?" Brian asked sharply.

"We're almost out of gas."

I leaned forward and examined the fuel gauge. Sure enough, the needle was hovering just one notch above the E.

"How much do we have left?" I asked.

He shrugged hopelessly. "Maybe enough for a few more miles."

"And then what?" Brian asked.

"We'll have to get out and walk." Liam answered.

I felt cold. Very, very cold. Having to walk meant leaving behind the safety and shelter of the car and setting off on foot through the blackness that enveloped the world outside. Without the car's headlights we would have only the lights of our phones to guide our way, but they wouldn't penetrate very far. We wouldn't be able to see more than a few feet ahead of us. And we wouldn't be able to see anything that was lurking in the darkness until it was almost in reach of us.

A grim silence filled the car as my three friends came to the same realization.

But before it could come to that, something happened.

"Wait!" Liam said abruptly, peering intently through the windshield.

"What, do you see something?" I asked.

"I thought I saw a light in the distance," he said.

"I don't..." Brian began, then jerked forward in his seat, shouting excitedly. "WAIT! I SEE IT TOO!"

And so did I. Materializing out of the inky blackness, was a pinprick of bright white light.

"What is it?" Brian asked.

"I don't know," Liam replied. "A streetlight maybe?"

But it wasn't a streetlight. As we drew nearer to the light, the darkness seemed to thin and recede somewhat. A building emerged, still about a quarter mile in the distance.

"I think it's a gas station," Liam said, and there was no mistaking the relief in his voice.

"Thank God," Brian whispered.

Even Tony, who had fallen into a listless, nearly catatonic state, seemed to perk up. "It's over! We're safe!" He uttered a child-like laugh of delight.

I felt my own optimism rise. Perhaps the nightmare really *was* over.

The gas station was a nondescript cinderblock building sitting in the middle of a parking lot, brightly lit inside by fluorescent fixtures. There were four fuel islands under a canopy that were also illuminated by powerful floodlights. In other words, it looked like any gas station you've ever seen before in your life.

But there were a couple things that, only in hindsight, I found odd.

For one, a tall sign beside the road proclaimed GAS in huge red neon letters. And GAS was all it said. There was no company name, no logo, nothing.

Also, despite a similar red neon sign in the window that assured us the station was OPEN, there wasn't a single car in the parking lot. Not even one belonging to whoever was presumably manning the register.

But I didn't really think about those things at the time.

The darkness dissipated and parted in front of us as we approached the gas station, a beacon of safety and security in this strange, frightening night. The station stood like a clearing in the center of a dense forest, the darkness surrounding it on all four sides.

Liam pulled into the parking lot and turned off the engine.

I could see someone inside, probably a clerk.

Without a word, the four of us got out and headed for the entrance. We entered and made a beeline for the counter.

Inside, everything seemed normal...at first glance, anyway. It looked like your typical gas station/convenience store: several aisles of groceries, coolers stocked with frozen foods and assorted beverages, a fountain drink station, a snack bar, automotive accessories, etc.

A cigarette rack was mounted above the counter. Behind the register, an overweight, balding, mustached man in a flannel shirt was sitting in a chair, casually reading a magazine. He didn't glance up as we approached, just nodded to himself, smirked at whatever he was reading, and turned the page.

"Excuse me, do you have a phone we could use? We're lost and we can't get any service on ours," Liam said to him.

The mustached clerk didn't respond. He just nodded to himself, smirked, and turned a page.

"Uh, sir?" Liam tried again, raising his voice a bit to get the man's attention.

The man behind the register didn't so much as glance up from his magazine. He didn't acknowledge us at all. It was like we weren't even there. He just nodded, smirked, and turned a page.

"Hey!" Brian said loudly, nearly shouting, causing the three of us flinch in surprise. "Are you fucking deaf or what? We have to use your fucking phone! We have an emergency!"

The clerk ignored Brian. He nodded to himself, smirked, turned a page.

We exchanged glances, bewildered.

"What the fuck is this guy's problem?" Brian said as an aside to us. He was becoming belligerent. He waves his hand in the clerk's face. "Hello? Hey, are we fucking invisible, asshole? You work here! How about doing your job and serving the public?!"

The man nodded to himself, smirked, and turned a page.

I was becoming very unsettled, not merely by his lack of response but also by how mechanical his motions were. Nod, smirk, turn a page. It was like watching a robot performing some pre-programmed action. Predictable, uniform, unvarying. Like a piece of looped film playing on constant repeat. It made my skin crawl. I realized with a sinking sensation that he was turning the pages of the magazine too rapidly to actually be reading their contents.

"Uh, guys," Tony called out. I looked over and saw that while we had been dealing with the clerk, Tony had wandered over to the candy aisle. "You better come over here and see this."

The three of us left the front counter and joined Tony. He was holding a bunch of candy bars.

"Goddammit, Tony, for real? Weird shit's going on and you decide now's a great time to grab some snacks?" Brian reprimanded him.

"No, check this out!" Tony insisted, looking seriously freaked out.  He held out the candy bars for our inspection.

It took me a second to see what was wrong. The candy bars were a Mounds, Three Musketeers, Milky Way, Twix and Kit Kat. I recognized their distinctive wrappers. But the words on them were total gibberish. Kuziblaud, Kefkomushbah, Flegnoripley, Hedipluzikax., Mouhkebleyf. 

I picked up a Baby Ruth and examined the packaging closely. It wasn't just the name that was wrong; every bit of printed text was the same garbled, seemingly random string of letters.

Brian went to the snack aisle and scanned the potato chips. "It's not just the candy," he said, "everything in this store's got the same weird shit on it."

"What the fuck does it mean?" Liam asked. "Is it some other language?"

"I don't know," I said, feeling my sense of unease increase. "Doesn't look like any language I ever heard of."

"Oh shit!" Brian said suddenly, and the panic in his voice cause the three of us to snap our heads in his direction. He was facing the windows at the front of the store, looking out into the parking lot with horror. 

"What?" Liam demanded.

"We got company," Brian said in a low, toneless voice. 

We joined him in looking out the windows. I felt my blood run cold.

A line of about thirty people, men and women, were slowly crossing the parking lot in the direction of the gas station. 

None of them had faces.
