I was only 14 years old, my grandpa loved hunting animals, but his favorite animal to hunt was always deer. They were easy to catch and sometimes he makes the best stew out of deer. Well one day, he asked me to go hunting with him. I said yes and we went to go walking on the forest. 

His house was not very far from the forest and it was really easy to go there. We were walking down the forest and grandpa was just asking the usual questions any grandpa would ask. “ how is school?” “ do you have good grade?” “ are you helping you mom  around the house” as he was asking questions, we heard a twig snap. It was a white tailed deer.

My grandpa act serious and kneeled so he can get a better shot, he pointed his rifle and pointed at the deer. I looked at him, exited and eager for him to shoot it. That’s were he was saying something, whispering something “ what the fuck?” I took a look at my rifle and saw what the deer is doing, I just wish I could’ve forget what I saw. As I took a look, the deer was banging its head on a tree, banging violently against the tree, it’s antlers was getting destroyed and we can see it’s brain just dropped to the ground. Then it went to the river trying to take a drink, but his jaw fell and couldn’t. The deer dropped dead and my grandpa told me to go back to the house now. To run he said.

We were running to the house. My grandpa looked back every 5 seconds. We went to the house and my was screaming of horror. Everyone is freaking out of why is my grandpa crying and screaming. I told my parents and my grandma what happened on the trip and they were shocked. My grandma took my grandpa to the hospital and the doctors said he has severe trauma and he could not recover from it. I looked up “ why is a deer banging  its head on a tree” I found nothing but a word saying “ deer zombie” I looked images and it was not close to what I saw.


Sometimes, I catch my grandpa loading his rifle and handgun, and sitting in front of the porch, just waiting for something to happened. My grandma called my dad, she was crying and trying not to vomit at the phone. She was saying that my grandpa had committed suicide in the forest. She called the police and they found him laying on a tree with a rifle on his hand and his head just demolished. They could not see if it was actually him or not cause of the scene. My grandma described him as scared of going outside, yelling “ he’s watching me, waiting for me to go to the woods” my grandma thinks it’s the cause of the deer, since he never seen anything like it. I just felt so bad for my grandma, she doesn’t deserve this kind of pain nor does anybody as well.
