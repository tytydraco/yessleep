I’ve never told anyone this before, but I can’t keep it to myself anymore. Something I saw as a child—a memory I thought I’d buried—has come back to haunt me.

When I was in fourth grade, I watched a man die.

It was a drizzly, overcast morning, the kind that makes the world feel gray and lifeless. I was hurrying to school, umbrella in hand, when I noticed him: a man in a tan jacket and gray slacks walking behind me.

I’d passed him earlier, and I could feel him back there. When I’d veered around him, he had been scowling. His face seemed confused and angry. The way he moved—fast, jerky, stomping steps—made me nervous. He looked like he was looking for a fight.

Suddenly, I heard an explosive, pained grunt, followed by a sickening wet thud.

I turned to see the man lying facedown on the sidewalk. His body twitched, his legs jerking in unnatural spasms.

“Sir?” My voice trembled. “Are you okay?”

He didn’t answer. His hands clawed at the wet pavement, his nails scraping across it with a sound that made my skin crawl. I froze, unsure of what to do, my heart pounding in my ears. Then, instinct took over, and I ran to the nearest house, banging on the door.

A middle-aged woman answered, her bathrobe hanging loosely over her frame. She squinted at me suspiciously through the screen, her hair a tangled mess.

“Call an ambulance! That man fell!” I yelled, pointing to where he lay on the sidewalk.

Her frown deepened, but she nodded and shut the door without a word.

I went back to the man.

The rain was falling harder now, sending rivulets down his tan jacket. Not knowing what else to do, I held my umbrella over him, shielding him from the rain. That’s when I saw it.

At first, I thought it was blood.

Thin, black strands trickled from his nostrils, pooling on the ground beneath him. But it wasn’t blood. It wasn’t red. It was dark, glistening, almost oily.

And it was moving. Squirming.

The strands writhed like worms, twisting and curling over each other. They forked and spread across the pavement in tangled, deliberate lines. One strand touched the toe of my shoe and curled around it, like a probing finger. Others snaked toward the curb, their movements too purposeful to be random.

I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t move.

The strands slithered over the curb and into the gutter, disappearing into the darkness below.

When the ambulance arrived, the rain had stopped. I stood to the side, shivering, as the paramedics lifted the man onto a stretcher and covered him with a sheet.

A police officer approached me. “Did you see what happened?” he asked, his voice calm but firm.

I nodded, swallowing hard. “He just… fell.”

The officer scribbled something in a notebook, took my name, and told me to go on to school.

I didn’t tell him about the black strands. I didn’t even know how to describe what I’d seen.

That was over thirty years ago.

I thought I’d forgotten about it—or pushed it into some dark corner of my mind. But a few weeks ago, I came across a video online. It showed a horsehair parasite emerging from a praying mantis.

At first, I was fascinated. Then horrified.

Thin, black strands spilled out of the insect’s body, writhing and twisting like living thread. The memory came rushing back, sharp and vivid.

What I’d seen that day wasn’t blood. Blood doesn’t move like that. Blood doesn’t slither.

I started researching. Horsehair parasites aren’t supposed to be able to infect humans. Scientists say it’s impossible. But I know what I saw. It wasn’t quite the same as a horsehair parasite. It was bigger.

And it wasn’t just moving randomly—it was escaping into the gutter. Into our water. Breeding.

I think about the way the man scowled, his confused and bewildered anger. It’s a look I’ve been seeing more and more lately, on the faces around me, and on the news.

People snapping in traffic. Screaming at cashiers. Lashing out online. Worse things too. Rage spreading.

I think about how more and more, that rage seems to be flowing out, growing, and infecting others—like a tangle of glistening black threads reaching out—for all of us.
