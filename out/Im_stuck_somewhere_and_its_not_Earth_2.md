I'm updating again. 24% battery left with as many power saving settings I can. If I don't find any power supply i'm f'ed.

Nobody responded, so i'm on my own, gotta figure out what to do. They've probably declared me missing already. I have basically no survival skills.

I first woke up at 4:28 WE. I have no idea what happened to the time, but this was probably still hours before the sun was up.

Because it wasn't.

I'd like to clarify a few things that I learned today in this post.

First, the phone didn't say Syr 3.

Turns out there was still soil on a corner of the phone. I rubbed it off to reveal "Syr 388". It also hadn't changed. Assuming the time letters changed at midnight, this wasn't the day counter.

There was still moonlight illuminating the area, casting shadows on every tree. Deafening silence for miles around. My ankle still can't support me but the swelling stopped and even reversed a bit. From what little I know, ice treats that.

Speaking of, it's cold as hell but there's no snow or ice as far as i'm aware. This thin jacket isn't doing very much but it's easy to travel around.

I had nothing to do so I left the burrow to a chilling wind. I had to get myself up if I wanted to travel anywhere outside this area. I started looking for something that acted like a crutch. I chose this branch half-buried in leaves. It was slightly taller than me and one half was in numerous stages of rot but it would do. I broke off any smaller twigs and retreated to the burrow.

I waited for another few hours. I just sat there, listening to the wind of angry ghosts passing by, thinking about my thoughts. How everything led up to this moment. In some way, it was kind of nice. I did some small changes like cleaning out debris and reinforcing any openings.

At 7:32 WE the sun finally rose. I left the burrow. The wind began to follow another direction and the cold lessened. That's when I began to see what was around me.

The wilderness isn't the same. Several leaf piles were dark shades of purple and blue, adding onto the normal colors like orange and brown. Some trees still beared leaves but no bark. Some formed shapes they shouldn't. There was also a decent amount of shrubs and plants but I had no idea what was safe and what wasn't.

I began walking back to the road with the stick. That was another note.

I am (probably) the only other person here.

The burrow wasn't that far from the road and I haven't seen or heard a single car passing by. There was a lack of road signs as I travelled onwards. The wilderness continued to puzzle me. One tree had roots from the top. One formed a narrow arch. One chunk of the forest only had rock for ground.

It was 2:31 RM by the time something broke the endless stretch of dense trees.

It was a house. Well, it looked pretty crappy, nobody had lived there a while it seems. Vines grew around the log walls, the foundation drooped on one corner, and the wood wasn't very well installed. There was a lack of color, only grey planks and white supports with years of dust.

I stumbled over to the door that had a little porch outside of it. A child's tricycle left to rust. A sheet of plywood blocked the doorframe, although it was warped and was covered in all sorts of scrapes and markings.

I tried kicking it in with the walking stick, but I was wasting time and putting pressure on my ankle. I looked around back.

The side door was empty. It was hard to see inside, but there was a pile up of furniture on the plywood. A table with dishes filled with unrecognizable piles of mold.

I continued to travel along the road. I knew what to expect at this point, and decided I should maybe go back. But that was like seven hours.

*No. I'm doing something wrong.*

I returned to the house. I tried investigating it further. I decided it was fine sacrificing some battery and lighted up the rest of the building.

I found an area with lines of debris and some wood. This was probably the living room. Next I walked into the kitchen. A line of hand-crafted and crude cabinets with little of interest, aside from a plain can.

"FOR BILLY, EVER LOVED"

I threw a rock at it a few times until I could open it. Sliced pears.

After that, I just closed up the back entrance and tried to makeshift some sort of bed.

The next day, my ankle was finally getting better, but realized I left the shoe behind in the dugout. Nothing to care about this way anyway.

11:28 WE. I stood outside the dugout. I could tell something was already wrong.

There was a shred of black and grey fabric where I stood.

The dugout had been covered with new tracks that don't line up, the adjustments I made undone, and the shoe was nowhere to be found. I could feel my heart sink a bit.

My gut told me to move the other way. I couldn't agree more.

Another few hours and I had probably made the same distance as the other direction. Trees arranged to form a triangle in the distance. One tree just lacked branches and was covered top to bottom in leaves.

Out of curiosity I decided to do a little bit of scrolling on the internet. I was actually getting better reception on this side. In the house, signal was basically dead.

I'm getting nothing about Garret Lake Tours or whatever it was called. Every time I try to keep typing it in, it almost seems angrier.

I stopped in some sort of old checkpoint box. The shutters were jammed and the door took a few tries but I was able to stop here. I found some sports backpack. A few hard candies tucked in a corner.

I found an old oil lamp which was also effortless finding the other materials. In five minutes I got it working and decided to go somewhere familiar.

After around half an hour I got back to the shore. Nothing is new, but the thing that was above water is nowhere to be found. I don't like how there's really nothing that makes noise or moves. Just the waves.

It's the fourth day now. Nothing has really changed. I was checking the rest of the little station, hoping for some biscuits or anything to eat, when I heard something slide behind a file cabinet. A water-damaged journal.

"*Early Sol (illegible)*

*(illegible) is out to find more wood.*

*We've yet to rebuild contact. This one is our strangest (illegible) we have discovered yet. We lost Jayden yesterday, he (illegible) investigating some noise in the forest. We said no. he (illegible, the ink is blurred)*

*I knew this was a bad decision from the start. We are going to finish with this place and leave. My goosebumps grow by the hour."*

That's all I've found. If you guys have any advice or questions, please feel free to say anything. I'm probably living on borrowed time, but there has to be electricity somewhere. I'll continue walking in the morning. Maybe i'm in some rundown area and i'll end up at that diner I liked in Rochester years before. Any shits possible now.
