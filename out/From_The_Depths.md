|This tale is based on a real story|

In the year 2008, Rishan’s life was intertwined with the depths, as he toiled as a deep-sea diver upon the OMGC oil rig stationed off the tempestuous shores of Mumbai, India. At a mere twenty-eight years old, he bore the weight of a seven-year immersion in his aqueous vocation. This rig, a formidable structure, stood defiantly isolated, a lone guardian adrift upon the expansive canvas of the Arabian Sea. A hundred nautical miles from the mainland, it embodied humanity’s audacious spirit, venturing into the abyss.  
  
Amidst the mechanical symphony of clanks and whirs, a quieter undercurrent of stories coursed through the rig’s inhabitants. These narratives, spun by those who had plumbed the fathomless depths, whispered of phenomena defying rational understanding. These tales, often consigned to the recesses of salty recollections, found their way to Rishan’s ears. Among them, a tale of terror clung tenaciously an account from a fellow diver, a kindred spirit of the deep, who had witnessed a colossal silhouette lurking beneath the waves. This creature, an abyssal behemoth akin to a shark, manifested an almost mythical aura. It drew near with cryptic curiosity, its obsidian form etching an indelible mark of dread upon the witness’s soul.  
  
On an evening veiled by the shadows of mid-August, Rishan descended into the depths alongside a companion named Arjun. Their objective was routine a mission to mend a subaqueous pipe leak that led them into a murky realm. Beneath the water’s surface, dim luminescence from underwater lights painted a feeble path, guiding them through the obscurity. Yet, amid this muted glow, an eerie discordance broke the aquatic serenity an echoing resonance, a metallic whisper that transcended the realm of the familiar. It was as though a distant vessel’s propeller churned, its ghostly murmur permeating the watery depths.  
  
Rishan, engrossed in his labor upon the rig’s skeletal architecture, followed Arjun’s gaze. The latter’s attention was ensnared by an enigmatic sight beyond a sight that compelled Rishan to pivot and behold the mysteries of the open water. Emerging from the shroud, a colossal form materialized, a titan of the deep, its contours blending with the aqueous shadows. Drawing nearer, it unveiled its enormity a colossal creature, sinuous and potent, gliding through the water like a specter born of the abyss. Its dimensions, surpassing twenty feet, defied convention, an entity that seemed to challenge the laws of nature itself.  
  
With eyes wide as the moon, Rishan bore witness to the inconceivable an aquatic enigma that awoke primal awe within him. This creature, an embodiment of the uncanny, invoked both reverence and fear, a presence that kindled the primal mysteries of the depths. Its fleeting passage etched an indelible impression upon Rishan’s soul, leaving an enduring mark of awe, wonder, and an unquenchable thirst for the enigmas concealed by the deep blue expanse.  
  
His tale brought new found fear to his colleagues and rekindled the curiosity of many to find to what is lurkind in the murky world beneath the waves.
