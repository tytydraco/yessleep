To whoever may be reading this, these are my last words. At 9AM tomorrow, I will be ending my life. This is not where I belong. I can only hope that by doing this, I will return home.

The summer before my sophomore year of high school, I was sick nearly every day. I would have a sore throat for a few weeks, feel better for a day or two, and then wake up sick again. My mom took me to an ENT after about two months of non-stop sickness. The doctor, Dr. Thoth, who had a heavy eastern European accent, stuck a popsicle stick in my mouth and examined it. I still remember the taste of those wooden sticks, like the ones in those ice cream cups they would serve at class parties. It’s one of the last memories of home I have.

"Well, Edward, your tonsils are quite beat up," he chuckled, "I would recommend a tonsillectomy." This was strange for me, since my mom had assured me that doctors stopped performing tonsillectomies in the 80s.

"I'll have Rita at the front desk schedule a follow up. Do you need a note for school?" he asked, taking off his gloves. He looked at me with wide eyes, which looked somewhat uncanny due to his furrowed brow.

"No," I replied, "school starts next week." He nodded, glancing to the side, his light demeanor shifting to dark, and led us to the front desk.

The lobby was dingy with baby blue wallpaper that must have been placed at least 100 years ago. Above a chair in the waiting room, there was a cross and a picture of the Pope. The woman at the front desk was large and had eye bags like she hadn't slept in days. She was chewing gum, and her jaw shifted slightly to the right left with every loud gnaw. My mother and I sat there for about a minute, not knowing whether she was aware of us or not.

"Excuse me?” she finally asked. The woman slowly turned her head slowly while still loudly chewing her gum.

“How can I help you?” She asked in an annoyed manner, and her eyes with heavy, fake eyelashes twitched.

“Hello, I need to schedule a follow up for my son,” my mom replied, trying to keep her calm.

“Will that be with Dr. Thoth?” she asked.

“Yep,” my mother responded. The woman’s eyes widened.

“I’ve always liked Dr. Thoth,” the front desk woman said, “He has his way of making things work.” She smiled- or rather grinned- softly.

My mom, clearly uncomfortable by her strange comment and demeanor said, “Yeah… right, when is his next availability?” The woman spit out her gum into a bag, filled with chewed up wads of white gum. 

“Mm, April 16th, 9:00?” she asked, politely. My mother pulled out her phone to check her calendar.

“April… April… that’s like nearly a year from now, right?” my mother asked. The woman nodded.

“That’s the soonest we have, I’ll let you know if something opens up,” the woman said.

“9:00 is fine,” my mother sighed.

After typing for a few seconds, the woman said, “Alright, that’s all. Have a nice day.” 

We walked to our car, and I could hear the earth crunching under her pounding feet. The mother I knew was hot-headed. She was the shortest-tempered woman I ever knew. 

"A tonsillectomy, huh?" my mom said, in a slightly annoyed tone, "You know, Eddie, surgeons love doing surgery. You probably don't even need it. But hey, no school for a week. And milkshakes" She looked over and smiled, her agitated demeanor softening.

"Yeah," I replied. Her smile dropped as she read my uninterested tone, and she sighed just loud enough for me to hear. The rest of the car ride was silent. 

The Monday after that was the first day of my sophomore year. I woke up about 7AM, and performed the usual routine: shower, brush my teeth, get dressed, and leave. I never ate breakfast, the Ambien (a sleeping pill) I was on made me nauseous. I went into my mom’s room to let her know, and she looked at me, surprised.

“Honey, why are you wearing such big jeans? It’s gonna be 100 degrees today,” she said, concerned. Annoyed, I sighed and slightly rolled my eyes in classic teenager fashion. We got into the car, and started driving to the high school.

“So, Eddie, you excited for your first day?” she asked, starting the car.

“Not especially,” I answered. She nodded her head and had that annoyed expression on her face. I then heard a large tire screech break the deadly silence between my mother and I. A car, trying to escape the police, bolted down the street in the lane next to us, running multiple red lights and nearly causing an accident.

“Jesus Christ!” my mother yelled while exhaling and holding her chest. The car must have been going at least 100 miles per hour. Shortly after he drove past us, he crashed into the brick wall guarding the school. The car was crushed, and the man died on impact instantly.

“What a great omen for your first day, huh Eddie?” She looked at me with her twitching, ‘crazy eyes’ look. I stared at the smashed car with a blank face, until I got out of the car.

We said goodbye, and I walked onto my massive campus of nearly 3000 kids. The same kids I’ve known since kindergarten, but so different.

 I eventually got to my homeroom, english, and sat down in the back of the class, like I always have. I glanced to my right and saw a girl with long,  sandy blonde hair that had purple tips. Her eyes were blue, like the Pacific Ocean, and her eyelashes were long and black. She had strangely round cheeks that did not match the rest of her extremely thin frame; but she was beautiful I stared at her with wide eyes until she looked my way, and I snapped my head back to the board. I completed the class, and then the classes after that, until lunch started. I didn’t get lunch. I just sat by myself in the cafeteria with my headphones in.

I felt a tap on my shoulder, and my entire body jolted as I turned around. It was that girl, and my face felt hot as I looked up at her.

“Hey, Edward, right?” she asked.

“Uh, yeah, that’s me,” I replied, nervously. She smiled at me.

“I just wanted to say that I like your shirt,” she said. I was wearing a shirt that said ‘Pareidolia,’ a somewhat popular alternative band that doesn’t exist where I am now. I loved this band, (hence the username) and had a lot of merchandise from concerts and shows, alongside a fair amount of bootlegs.

“My shirt? Oh, yeah, my shirt, thank you,” I said, not being able to think straight. 

“You’re welcome,” she beamed, “Hey, how about you sit with me and my friends?” I could feel the color draining from my face as I started scrambling for an answer.

“Uh, I have to get some work done, but thanks,” I idiotically replied, my nervous smile fading as I realized there was no homework in any class.

She looked at me with a suspicious, yet playful, manner and said, “Alright, but to make up for it, you have to come to my thing on Saturday?”

“What thing-” I could barely get out the words before I felt her finger on my mouth, shushing me, with an ear-to-ear grin. 

“Don’t worry about it. I’ll text you the details,” she laughed, “here, type in your number.” I shakily took her phone and carefully typed in my number.

“I’m Lydia, by the way,” she said while I gave her phone back to her. Before I could come up with a response, she had already walked away. 

Her smile was contagious. I had a stupid, red grin on my face and my eyebrows were raised softly as I watched her leave.

Later that day, after a very long first day of syllabus after syllabus being thrown at my face, I finally laid in bed. I closed my eyes, and fell into a deep sleep.

You know that feeling when you wake up from a nap, and you’re sweaty, your room is dark, you are insatiably thirsty, and you have no idea what time it is? That is how I woke up. I don’t remember any of the dreams I might have had, but I remember waking up terrified. I stood up to turn on my light, and then went to check my phone. 7:52pm.

*Jesus Christ*. I thought to myself. I rubbed my eyes, and as they adjusted to the light, I saw some texts from an unknown number.

The texts are gone now, but it went something like this:

Lydia (L): Hi

Me (E): hey

*L: Took you long enough*

*E: Sorry*

*L: I’m just messing with you*

*E: Oh my bad*

*L: So that thing on Saturday, wanna come? 3pm It’s like a party but not really. Parents are gone*

*E: Who would be there*

*L: Just a few of my friends and you of course*

*E: What are you guys gonna do*

*L: You’ll see*

*E: Uh okay, what’s the address*

*L: 266 McLinen Ave, will you be there?*

*E: yeah*

*L: okay, see you at school :)*



I put my phone on my bedside table, and laid in my bed, staring at the ceiling. I thought about her, for what must have been 20 minutes. I thought about what she’d look like in a white dress. I thought about what our kids would look like. I always had a habit of jumping to the extremes, with people I liked, hyperfocusing on one person at a time. My hyperfixation was her.

I floated by the next week of school, only dealing with the extreme boredom by looking at her if she was near. If she wasn’t, I would think about her. Finally, the day of the party (or whatever she was calling it) was here. I woke up at 5am, I couldn’t sleep due to pure juvenile excitement. I got dressed in my biggest jeans and one of my pareidolia shirts, layered with a long sleeve underneath- despite it being 100 degrees- with black boots I would wear on every occasion. I rotted in bed until about 2:30.

“Mom, I’m going to a friend’s house,” I said.

“Okay, do you need a ride, Eddie?” she replied.

“No, I’ll just walk,” I said, foolishly. I was unaware that it was about an hour long walk. I went outside, in the blazing hot sun, and began heading north. I was repeating the address in my head over and over again. After about 20 minutes, I realized I was not getting any closer, and I was going to be late. As if God himself heard my groans in the hot sun, a cab appeared. This was very strange, in my 15 years of life at that point I had never seen a cab in my town. I shrugged, and stopped it. Luckily, I had 20 dollars with me.

“266 Mclinen avenue,” I mumbled as I got into the front seat. He was silent. It was a tall, thin man, deep, dark eye bags. Just like a cliche, he had a scarf over his mouth and a hat on. He grunted. In situations like these, my mother always taught me to make conversation so as to not make things awkward.

“So, do you like this job?” I asked. He shrugged in response. “You get to go sight-seeing, though, right?” 

“Not much to see around these parts,” he mumbled, so quietly I could barely hear him. I heard a faint eastern-European accent, just like my ENT. 

“Dr. Thoth?” I asked. And just like that, even though I had only been in the car for about 5 minutes, we were there.

“Here’s your stop. Goodbye,” he almost demanded. I nodded cautiously and got out. It was a suburban house with a run-down yard, definitely has not been mowed in months- if not years. I knocked on the door, no answer. “Hey, over here!” an unfamiliar voice called from the window on the side of the house. I jumped, startled. I walked over there, the dry, dead grass crunching under my boots.

“Can you let me in?” I asked. 

“Come in through the window!” one of the inebriated girls exclaimed. I walked up to the window, and tried to push myself in. While the girls laughed at me, I squeezed in through the small window, and stumbled as I fell inside the room. I looked around and saw a perfectly pink little girls bedroom: Polaroid pictures all over, fairy lights, and innocent, cutsey decor scattered about. I sat in silence, as I listened to the girls talk. Two of the girls were chattering on about their sugar daddies, and another pair was laughing and fidgeting with stuff in their laps. Lydia sat next to me, rather close, I might add, and greeted me. 

“This is Edward, guys,” she said. They all waved, and one of the girls replied, “We’ve heard a lot about you,” and laughed, which made me blush.

“Sorry if that was rude, they have strange ways of having fun sometimes,” she said to me.

“It’s all good,” I responded, embarrassed. I didn’t want to show it, though. We talked for a few minutes, mainly about music, until I heard one of the girls’ shrill voices.

“It’s done,” the girl said. I think her name was Ash- which was rather ironic because of what she was talking about.

“You ever tried one of these before, Edward?” My heart dropped as soon as I saw what she was holding. It was a blunt. I went pale and started sweating, but I tried to hide it as I saw them all staring at me like vultures.

“Oh, yeah, plenty of times,” I said, and I’m sure the lie was obvious, but no one questioned.

“Here, I’ll let you go first,” Ash said. She handed it to me as my heart pounded. With a lump in my throat, I took the rolled up blunt. One of the girls handed me a lighter, and it slipped right out of my sweaty hand. A bright pink lighter, like it was meant for a small girl. I looked at the things in my hands, and saw my father’s disheveled face in the reflection of the shiny, pink lighter. Thin, eyes empty like black holes, lips chapped and teeth rotting. I lit the blunt, and felt a familiar scent, the skunk-like scent of my father coming home late at night to tuck me into bed. I took it up to my face, and took a shallow breath into the blunt. The terrible smell expanded in my mouth and into my lungs, and I felt the disappointment of my mother wash over me. Yet, it felt good, like a weight was lifted off of my shoulders and floated up into the sky.

“Are you just gonna hog it?” Another girl, Mari, said. I jumped and handed it to her. The blunt passed around in a circle a few times, every time I inhaled I felt better and the guilt melted off. At the third or fourth rotation, once it got back to Lydia, we were talking like we had known each other for ages. I had noticed that Lydia had gotten progressively closer to me over time, physically I mean. At this point, her hand was on mine, but I didn’t care. I wasn’t nervous. Lydia took a breath into the blunt, leaned over, and kissed me. She blew the smoke into my mouth and it filled my lungs, but I didn’t choke. Her friends giggled as they watched us kiss. 

Hours passed, but it felt like minutes. Before I knew it, it was 10pm, and I had three missed calls from my mom. My heart dropped to my feet, and I grabbed my stuff and practically ran out the door. I called my mom back and she started yelling at me.

“Where the hell are you? Why haven’t you answered my calls? Come home now,” she demanded. “I’ll call you an uber, what’s the address?” 

I told her the address and then hung up. I started panicking and nearly cried, until about 7 minutes later, I saw headlights. I got into the car and told him my home address, and he was silent. I arrived home 10 minutes later, and as I approached the door, I felt dread like I had never felt before. I begrudgingly opened the door and saw my mom in the living room.

“Come here,” she said, scaringly sullenly. I slowly walked over to her.

“I’m sorry mom, I lost track of time-” 

“I don’t want to hear it,” she interrupted me. “I could smell it from the doorway, Edward. I know what you did.” My heart sank, but I knew this was coming.

“Mom, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to-”

“Didn’t mean to? Seriously? Jesus Christ, I can’t even look at you, go to your room,” she yelled. As I walked up the stairs, on the verge of tears, I heard her say something. So faint, you could have missed it: “You are just like your father, a fucking disappointment.”

I felt hot with anger and sadness as I ran to my bedroom. I sat in my bed with tears streaming down my face. I shoved my face into my pillow and cried until I fell asleep.

The next morning when I woke up, my mother was gone. I was glad. I didn’t want to see her face. I walked into the living room and saw a picture on the coffee table, at a further glance, I saw my father’s face. His face before the drugs, when he was about my age. My parents met in high school, and had me somewhat young. I picked up the picture and brushed my fingers against his face, and I noticed a crack in the glass. It wasn’t there before, so I just assumed my mother dropped it- or more likely, tried to smash it. I felt a buzz in my pocket, and put the picture of my father down. It was Lydia, and suddenly the despair in my chest eased. The conversation went something like this:

L: *Are you okay? I didn’t want to bother you last night, you were in such a rush I didn’t know what to do*

E: *Yeah, I’m okay my mom just needed me home*

L: *Well, how about we see each other one on one today?*

I looked at the picture of my dad, then glanced back at my phone.

E: *Yeah, where should I meet you?*

She told me to meet her at her house. Similar to her friend Ash, Lydia was alone most often. Her aunt raised her after her mom got arrested for dealing, and her dad disappeared long before she was born. She didn’t live far, so I figured I’d walk again, which again was a huge mistake. About 10 minutes into my walk, once again, I was saved by that mysterious cab I would become so familiar with.

“426 Siri Avenue,” I told him. He grunted in response, and the rest of the ride was silent. I arrived at the house, a very small house in a poor neighborhood, and knocked on the door. She opened it with a smile on her face and let me in. We went into her room and she shut the door behind her.

“Edward, I have something but you have to swear you won’t tell the girls,” she said, seriously.

“Yeah, sure, what is it?” I replied, feeling slightly nervous.

“Last night, before I left, I found some H on Ash’s counter. I took it,” she blurted. My heart sank once again, but deeper into my stomach than last time. Heroin is what my dad overdosed on when I was nine. I was scared and I wanted to opt out, and then I remembered what my mother said to me the night before, and my worry crumbled.

“Let’s do it,” I exclaimed, feeling rebellious. She let me go first, since she was more experienced. She took out a purple ribbon from her hair and tied it around my bicep. She got the spoon and heated it with a lighter in her pocket, as she prepared the heroin. Every time I felt nervous, I just pictured my mom’s face. She hurt me, so I hurt her back.

“You ready?” she asked, holding the needle to my arm.

“Yeah. Yeah, I’m ready,” I replied. She stuck the needle into my vein and slowly pushed it in. As she took it out, I genuinely felt as if I was floating into the air, surrounded in a warm blanket of comfort and joy. She did the same to herself, and after that, I don’t really remember what happened. All I know is that I woke up with no pants, and the same went for her. It was night already when the heroin had faded, and we spared no time in lighting a blunt and smoking it together. We talked in her bed, me holding her with her head on my chest, and we fell asleep there. 

At around three in the morning, I got a call from my mother. I looked at the phone, then at the sleeping girl next to me, and then back at my phone. I silenced my phone, and fell back asleep with Lydia. 

This continued practically daily. My mother would ground me, take my phone, but I’d end up with Lydia despite her efforts. Within the next few months, I had tried nearly every substance known to man. I drank, I smoked weed, took pills, snorted coke and meth, and of course, heroin. I would come home to find empty bottles of wine on the kitchen table and my mom passed out on the couch. Except for one night. A Friday, I believe. 

“Edward,” my mother said, with dried tears on her face, “The ENT called. An opening came up, you have your tonsillectomy on Monday at 9:00. You have to be there.” 

I nodded and went upstairs to my room, where I could hear her crying. I loved my mother, but I needed her to hurt like how I hurt. The weekend flew by, and before I knew it, it was Sunday night. I was at Lydia’s, and at around midnight, my mother called me, reminding me of my procedure the next day. 

“I’ll be there,” I told her.

“Please come home, Edward, I love you,” she said to me. I hung up the phone. A few hours later, I gathered my stuff and called myself a ride home. I got into the car and the man started mumbling.

“Isn’t it a school night?” he muttered with a faint Russian accent.

“Yep,” I said bluntly, clearly annoyed.

“Don’t you think you should have already been home?” he said. This made me angry, and I wasn’t shy with my anger.

“Where the hell do you think you get off saying that? Mind your damn business. Jesus Christ,” I yelled. He was silent for the rest of the trip, and I slammed his car door on the way out. When I came home, my mother was already asleep. I went to my bed and stared at the ceiling. My body twitched and my heart pounded as I laid awake for hours upon hours, tweaking on what I assume was meth or crack. I didn’t need an alarm, since I was already awake by the time I needed to go. I showered, and when I saw myself in the mirror, I saw my father. Thin, frail, bruised body, and eyebags as dark as the growing gaps between my teeth. The water hurt my dry skin, and my thin hair piled by the drain as strands came out, one by one. My mother was on the couch, waiting for me, already drinking.

“You ready?” she asked me. I nodded. We got into the car and endured a silent, twenty minute ride to St. Catherine’s hospital, an old hospital downtown- actually, now that I think about it, my father was born there. 

When I walked inside of the hospital lobby, it was dark. There was brown wallpaper, Victorian style, with a portrait of the pope hanging above the reception desk. There were a few crosses scattered about the room in random places. The woman at the front desk called me over to sign some paperwork. She was thin and frail like me, and very Italian. I could barely understand her English. When I sat down, the chair was facing the wall, away from the woman, so she was just looking at the side of my head. It felt as though I was receiving a confession from a priest.

“Sign this,” she told me, coldly, “give me your right wrist.” I put down the pen and gave her my wrist, where she tied the hospital bracelet onto me. ‘Edward Sean Baxter, M, 12/31/07, Allergy: Tramadol,’ it said. I waited in the lobby silently with my mom, feeling as though Pope Francis was staring at me, judging me for my sins. 

“Edward Baxter?” a woman with a clipboard called. I sat up and went to her, and she took me to my pre op room. I wore a pale yellow hospital gown with those socks with grips on the bottom. The nurse took my arm and as she was about to tie the band onto me, she looked closer at the bruises by my vein.

“Got a vein punctured recently?” she asked, her dead, Russian eyes glaring directly into my soul. 

“Something like that,” I replied. My mom just sat in the corner, a shell of her former self. I texted Lydia after my blood was drawn. It was very early, about eight by this point, give or take. 

*‘I love you*’ I texted her. I had never said this to her before, but I knew how I felt about her. I loved her. My heart dropped as I could have sworn I saw a message bubble appear, and then suddenly, I heard someone knock on the door. It was Dr. Thoth.

“Alright, Edward, let’s go over the protocol,” he told me in his thick accent. He leaned over to look down my throat, and I saw his necklace dangling. It was an ankh, an Egyptian symbol of life. I had seen Lydia wear something like that previously. He took a look in my mouth and looked me in the eyes. I felt an intense fear and sense of dread as he stared into my eyes. His eyes were dark and dead, but exhibited this sense of pure anger. He looked at me for about 5 seconds, and then back into my mouth.

“You can close now,” he said, taking the stick out of my mouth, “don’t worry Edward, we will get you all fixed up.” He glared at me and let out a very subtle smirk.

“We’re going to take you to the OR now, okay?” the nurse said. They began to roll me on the bed to the surgical room. The halls were eerily empty, only a few doctors passing through alongside me. As they transferred me to the operating table, I thought about what Lydia’s response was going to be. It must have been obvious what I was thinking, because I was interrupted.

“Thinking about a girl?” Dr. Thoth asked me, staring at my soul with grinning eyes. 

“No- no, just thinking,” I replied, startled.

“It’s okay, Edward,” he said eerily, “she will still be here when you.” The fucker didn’t guess I was thinking about a girl. He *knew* I was thinking about her. 

They put a mask on my face and told me to countdown from 10. I didn’t, I just thought about her, and what we would do when I was out of here. As I faded out of consciousness, I saw my doctor standing over me, still grinning.

I woke up in a different room. Everything was hazy, and I was alone for a few seconds until the nurses came in. They immediately gave me some painkillers through my IV, and I told them I wanted my mother. I had not yet recollected my memory from the past few months, and all I wanted was my mother at that moment. 

“Sure, honey, I’ll go get her for you,” one of the nurses said to me. A minute later, my mom walked in. 

“Hey honey,” she said endearingly, “how are you feeling, Ed?” 

“Fine,” I replied, confused. I looked at her strangely; firstly, where had all of the animosity between us just a few hours before gone? Second, she never called me Ed.

“Well, we’ll start the discharge process, okay?” The nurse told my mother and I. She handed my mother a piece of paper on a clipboard with a pen. As she signed her name, the nurse took out my IV. Hey, my bruise from before was gone. My mom handed me the clipboard, and I was about to sign, but I noticed something. ‘Edward Shawn Baxter.’ 

“Hey mom, they made a typo on my name,” I said.

“Are you sure Ed? I didn’t see anything,” she replied, confused.

“Yeah, they spelt Sean ‘S-H-A-W-N,’” I told her.

“Honey, that’s how you spell Shawn. You’re probably just confused from the meds,” she assured.

“The meds can be disorienting for some,” the nurse said. I nodded and tried to take my mind off of it. As the medications wore off, I started to feel more and more pain in my throat, like the worst sore throat you’ll ever have. I couldn’t wait to get home so I could get into my stash of opiates to ease the pain. They prescribed me ibuprofen, since I’m allergic to tramadol- the usual opiate for small procedures; and god knows ibuprofen won’t do anything. 

“We’re home,” my mom said cheerfully. We got out of the car and went into the house, where my mom walked me to my room.

“Let me know if you need anything, Ed,” she said.

“Mom, why do you keep calling me ‘Ed,’” I asked her.

“What do you mean, hon? I’ve always called you Ed,” she replied.

“Right,” I muttered, and I shut the door. I practically ran to my dresser where my stash was hidden, and started rummaging through the drawers. Underwear, socks, and shirts were inside, but no drugs to be found. I started to call out for my mother, but then I realized it would just be better to drop it. Then, I remembered I had to text Lydia. I was hesitant and nervous to see what she had said, but I think on the inside I knew she loved me too. I picked up my phone and went to the message app. Our conversation wasn’t there. I scrolled up and down and even refreshed the page, but there was nothing. I tried calling her number, but it was out of service. Immediately, I thought about my mother. I knew she hated me and Lydia being together. She must have blocked her number on my phone. I wasn’t supposed to go back to school for a week, and I had no way to reach her. I got increasingly anxious as I realized how alone I was. Everything felt so strange and I didn’t know what to do; should I confront my mother about her behavior or should I leave it? Should I sneak off to Lydia’s house or wait until Monday? I decided it was for the best to just stay home and try to keep my mind off of it, at least for a while. So I laid in my bed, unable to swallow, and waited to fall asleep.

It was easier to fall asleep than usual, since I was on some sort of upper most of the time- usually meth. I dreamt about my father, at least I think. He was different from how I remember him; he wasn’t deathly thin, his eyes had life, and he didn’t have the bruises that I am now so familiar with on his arm. We played with a ball outside, in a park that looks so familiar, but I can’t put my finger on it. I felt joy for the first time in a while, pure, innocent joy- that nostalgic, bittersweet feeling you have when you remember your childhood memories. 

I woke up in pain. My throat was killing me. I stumbled down the stairs to the kitchen, where my mom was standing. 

“What time is it?” I asked with my hoarse voice.

“6pm,” she replied. I didn’t realize how long I had been sleeping.

I nodded. “I had a dream about dad,” I said hesitantly, knowing it’s a sore subject for my mother.

“Really?” she said cheerfully, smiling. This was extremely out of character. She’d usually just brush it off and change the subject. “What about?”

“Well, we were at a park, and throwing a ball back and forth,” I told her.

“Oh, those were such sweet times,” she said while approaching me, “do you remember how we’d have picnics at the park every Sunday?” She hugged me.

I thought about it for a second. “No, I don’t. I don’t ever remember spending time with dad,” I said.

“What are you talking about, Ed? We would go to the park every Sunday at noon,” she looked at me, extremely confused with a mix of concern. 

“How old was I? My only memories of dad is his coming home past midnight high out of his mind,” I asserted. 

“Ed, what are you talking about?” she said, becoming increasingly concerned and agitated.

“Dad was a junkie, wasn’t he?” I started questioning my own memory of my father. Then I remembered, we had a photo of us together, a few weeks before he overdosed. I remember him being pretty fucked up in that photo, he was late and high. “Here,” I said, rushing over to the photo on the coffee table, “look,” I held up the picture to her.

She looked at me angrily, “What the hell are you talking about Edward.” 

I looked at the picture I was showing her, and my face turned white. I saw my family, but it was different. My dad was perfectly healthy and neat, his beard freshly shaven, and his arms around me. It was too much for me to handle, so I just walked off angrily to my room. I couldn’t explain what was happening, and honestly, I still can’t.

The next day, she was normal, like nothing happened. This was fine by me, I didn’t really want to remember what happened. I thought about Lydia as the days passed, growing more and more anxious about my separation from her. I decided, on Thursday, to listen to some music. I searched through my box of records and CDs, looking for my favorite album, Pareidolia’s *God is Dead*. I looked in confusion, as it wasn’t there. Neither were any of my other Pareidolia records. 

“Mom, do you know where my Pareidolia records went?” I asked, walking into the kitchen.

“I don’t know anything about that,” she said, “since when did you have any records for a ‘Pareidolia,’ anyways?” I looked at her in confusion.

“Mom, we’ve seen them in concert multiple times,” I asserted.

“Hm,” she mumbled, “I don’t recall.” This is when I truly started freaking out. I went back to my room, glaring at my mother as I walked. I went onto my laptop, frantically searching for anything having to do with the band; and as you might have guessed from my earlier remark: there was nothing. My heart pounded as I realized there was something very wrong. That woman was not my mother. This is not my house. I am not myself.

I impatiently waited for Monday morning, the day I would return to see Lydia. I only left my room when absolutely necessary, and I was on the brink of dehydration a few times throughout this period of time. I woke up- only running on about three hours of sleep- showered, got dressed, and got in the woman’s car.

“So, Ed, ready to go back to school?” she asked.

“Yep,” I replied. I was inclined to only give her one word answers. The rest of the car ride was silent, and as soon as I arrived at my school, I was out of the car and on my way to my first period. I frantically looked around for Lydia, but her desk was empty. As I looked at the door, the bell rang.

“Hey,” I asked the boy next to me, “do you know where Lydia is?” 

“I don’t know who that is, dude,” he told me.

“You know, the girl that sits right there?” I said as I pointed at her empty desk.

“Uh, that desk has been empty the entire semester, man,” he said, looking away awkwardly. My heart dropped and my breathing was heavy. My head was pounding and my vision was blurry. He took her from me, he took Lydia from me. That fucking doctor took her away from me. I felt an intense wave of fear come over me- as if a tsunami ran right through me- and everything went black.

I woke up in my room, my mother sitting on my bed. She looked at me and played with my hair. I was disoriented and everything was blurry; plus my head pounded like crazy.

“How are you feeling, Ed? You passed out at school,” she said.

“I don’t know what happened,” I replied, trying to reorient myself. Everything slowly came back to me as I sat up, and I remembered the last moments before I passed out. She wasn’t there, she isn’t here- because she is nowhere. 

“Do you need anything, hon?” she asked. I nodded in a no, and she walked out. I grabbed my laptop in search of an answer, frantically searching through reddit and 4chan, hoping that something will help me in my return home. I needed to go back. I made a post on a burner account on a weird subreddit, it said something like this: “I woke up in the wrong universe after my tonsilectomy. Help. I need to go back.” Someone responded in the comments, asking me to check my DMs.

He said that he can help me. When he asked me for his name, he said to just call him ‘T.’ He told me that in order to go back home, I need to end this life. When he told me this, my heart dropped. I was terrified. What if it didn’t work? What if I wake up somewhere else? What if she isn’t there? He reassured me it would all be okay. I will go back if the intention is right. He told me to end my life- the wrong life- at the same time that I lost my reality in the first place. It’s currently 11 P.M., and tomorrow, I will end my life. I will see her again.



I’m writing this the next morning. It’s currently about six, and at nine, I am going to jump in front of a car on the street in front of my school. I don’t know anymore, I don’t know if I should. I’m scared. The woman in my home- my mother- her last words to me shook me to my core.

“I’ll see you later, Eddie,” she said to me. My eyes widened as my heart pounded. Is she my mother? Am I in the right place now? I sent a message to T, and he told me that she is trying to trick me into staying, and that I must go through. I trust him. He doesn’t think I’m crazy, because I’m not. I’m not crazy. Do you think I’m crazy? I will go back. See you soon.
