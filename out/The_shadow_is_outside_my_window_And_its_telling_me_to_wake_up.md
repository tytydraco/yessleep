It didn’t take me long to realise things were off. It was a place I had been so many times before, yet could never put my finger on - far too typical to identify, at least, that’s what I always told myself as I clenched my fists and snapped my eyes shut to drown out the noise. 

Everything seemed warped - so close to reality, yet too sterile. Empty. The walls of the houses which dotted the hilltop of the vibrant green hill were too white, the roofs too cartoonishly unrealistic to be a mirror image of what I knew. Everything was off.

I began my long, slow journey up the hill, only to find that instead of getting closer things seemed to pull back further and further away, until they became a mere blip in the distance. 

Every time I tried to catch up with it it receded more. But I was soon distracted by the ringing; a daily occurrence, now, it hung in the air, like feedback from a microphone, overwhelming my senses and only getting louder once I clasped my hands over my ears and willed it to stop.

  
Things went to black. Seconds later, my eyes opened. I was lying on my back, hands by my side and eyes firmly focused on the too blue sky. A shadow kneeled beside me, asking me if I was alright and telling me of the fall I took, but it wasn’t a normal voice. 

Something distorted, seemingly close and far away at the same time, uttered without lips moving a muscle. I tried to tilt my head and make eye contact with the thing, but there were no eyes to do so with. 

All the figure was made of was darkness. A mere shape, not a being, but yet it continued to speak in a low and practically incomprehensible whisper.

 All I could make out were the words ‘wake up’, repeated again and again at random intervals.

Things began to warp, another trick of the eye, but feeling ever so real as I shook, the sensation of falling engulfing me before my eyes snapped shut a second time. When I opened them, the figure was gone.

I woke up. Properly, now, I woke up in my bed as per usual. It took a moment to process it all, but I somehow mustered the courage to rise to my feet and open the shutters, revealing a rolling landscape crested by the houses which dotted the hilltops for as long as I could remember. 

It didn’t occur to me at the time that I had never seen anyone enter, or leave for that matter.

I made myself a cup of tea, a light blend to avoid being sick. I felt strangely dizzy, in a way I couldn’t exactly describe but made everything around me seem off. Pictures hung differently to how they used to in the hallways which somehow felt longer, unnaturally so. 

At the time, again, I thought nothing of most of it, and resolved to simply enjoy my cup of tea by the windows, watching the houses, as still and empty as ever. 

A chill descended upon the room, but my eyes remained fixated on the house. Watching, now, with a twisted sense of discomfort. This wasn’t my house, this wasn’t my village. 

I couldn’t see it, but I could feel the shadow grow around me and cast the same warped images on the tiled ground. 

That was yesterday.

I’m in a motel now, far away from where I first saw it. I took the first train out of the village and headed to \[REDACTED\], Yorkshire on account of having family nearby. I’ll visit them tomorrow, and they’ve agreed in advance to keep me safe at their house. 

That’s if I make it there. I can hear it again, outside my window, tapping on the glass. The shadow is there, and it’s telling me to wake up.
