Okay so this isn’t the best course of action to take, but I’m kind of a newby to urban exploring and I’m not really sure if it’s legal in my country, so  I thought that asking for suggestion might be the best solution 

So, a friend of mine invited me to try out this new hobby of his with two others of our group.
The place he chose was this old abandoned village a couple of kilometers away from the highway.
He said it was better than risking an encounter with some crackheads in an abandoned building, so I trusted his judgment on this one, beside I had a hell of a week dealing with university and I needed a break.

So we took my friend’s car and drove into this stupid place in the middle of nowhere, and now he’s gone alongside with the fucking car keys, and the rest of us is just here, alone, at the dead of night.

I just really hope this is some sort of stupid prank, because at least I’ll have the pleasure of killing him myself.

Ok, I should probably explain my surroundings first, I’m not sure how much this could help, but it’s worth the shot.

So the place has definitely been here for a long time, we’re talking like WWI or something, I think it used to be some sort of farm once but it slowly expanded into a full fledge town. There are plenty of field around us that extend for miles, which separates us from the highway, and worst of all, guess what, we’re in Northern fucking Italy, Lombardy to be precised, a place known to fill itself during the winter with fog so thick that you could cut it with a knife, which means that without the car headlights we can barely see past our nose like we’re in Silent fucking Hill.

The place is fully furnished at least, with beds and stuff so in the worst case scenario we can sleep here for the night, but how the fuck are we supposed to sleep in a roach infested bed like nothing has happened while our friend has gone missing.

And there’s this wind that keeps howling, it’s almost cartoonish sounding, almost feels like a whistle.

I’ve been hearing it since we came here in the afternoon and it’s driving me insane, I don’t know if I should be annoyed or be creeped out about it, but the weirdest thing is that I don’t feel any movement in the air, just the sound.

I never thought of it before but now that I’m writing this, it’s genuinely scaring the shit out of me.

One of my other friends suffers from anxiety at a pretty highly level to the point that he has to take medication and I really don’t want them to panic and lose control, there are way too many problems to take care of I don’t want to overwhelm them.

I’ll just try to keep everyone updated, but if you’re familiar with these kind of scenarios and urban exploring in general, please help, because we’re freaking out right now!!
