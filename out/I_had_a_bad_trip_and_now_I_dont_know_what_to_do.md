My boyfriend, Johnny, and I are planning on doing shrooms tonight. We stopped by the local gas station and grabbed some candy, off-brand sour rainbow strips, to help the shrooms go down easier. Once we were back at our place, we waited until the sun went down and got ready to have some fun. We didn’t have high hopes, well, not that we were really experienced anyway. But since our usual hookup had moved away, we didn’t know what to expect. Johnny ended up running into a strange guy at the bar while he was outside smoking a cigarette. The stranger bummed one off of him, then just offered them right up. Normally, I would never take drugs from a stranger, but we’ve had a rough time lately, and I’d do anything to catch a break. 

We are off to a good start, as I am not nearly as nauseous as usual after taking them. Johnny and I snuggle up on the couch to watch Trolls. A half hour later or so, he jumps up and says he wants to look at the stars. He swings the door open, right as I start to shout to remember the cat. Lately, our void cat, Freja, has been unusually skittish– spending hours under the bed, twitching at every sound, and trying to escape any chance she gets. I keep reminding Johnny to watch out for her when he opens the door, or go out the back if he can (we have a screen on our patio). And of course, he always forgets. When he opens the door, I spot Freja’s tail peeking out from underneath the coffee table, two feet away from our front door. She darts out. 

“How many times do I have to tell you to watch out for her?!” I rush after her, down our apartment stairs, but she’s nowhere to be seen.

“So what, I can’t open the door to my own place?” he follows behind me a few moments later. “She’s a cat, she’ll find her way back. Calm down.” 

“You don’t know that! All I did was ask you to be more careful,” I cry to him. “Just help me look for her.”

“Are you serious? We just took shrooms. We can look in the morning.”

This is where I might’ve messed up, but really, I didn’t know what else to do. She’s my baby, and I know I couldn’t just sit at home and wait for her. What if something bad happened? I run upstairs, grab a bag of treats, and throw on a jacket. 

“Well, I’m going to look.” I shut the door a little too hard behind me.

I walk around our apartment, looking beneath bushes and calling out her name. After thirty minutes or so, the air begins to grow thick and hot. The edges of my vision start to cave in, the light draining from everything around me. It was like a mask had been pulled over my eyes, with a dark vignette closing in, blurring everything but the center. Shit. The shrooms were starting to kick in. I tell myself that this is my journey. Freja and I are connected, I would find her, and everything would be fine. Just then, a tiny black shadow darted into a nearby hallway.

“Freja! It’s mommy!” I sprint after her. As I turn the corner, I stop abruptly. So abruptly that I nearly tripped onto the concrete. The hallway is pitch black, void of color or shape. I can’t make out a thing. Worse still is the cold dread curling in my gut, my stomach twisting, begging me to turn back.

Just as I am trying to convince myself I’m just tripping, there is nothing to worry about, I’ve been down this hallway plenty of times… I hear her meow. This is my journey, I need to be brave for her, be her protector. I force my feet forward. Another meow comes from down the void of a hall, a bit louder now.

“Come here, sweetie,” I call out with a shaky voice. Two big, unblinking eyes stare at me, not so far away. Not too much longer and we’ll be together again. I can’t believe Johnny wouldn’t help me– you know what, I don’t need him. I fumble in the pitch darkness, feeling around to open the treat bag, slowly approaching her. I look down for a moment, my eyes beginning to adjust, I could just make out the edges of the bag… and then I run into some *thing*. 

I fall hard onto my ass and look up. A figure looms over me, it’s a man, at least, I think it’s a man. I can see the white slits of his eyes, hear his breathing. He’s smiling at me. The whites of his teeth stretch unnaturally wide, twisting his face into something almost inhuman. My vision warps, the world bending with his endless, stretching smile. I sit frozen, shock pinning me in place. Grasping for any rational thought, I try to shake it off, but time warps alongside his grin. My sense of time is completely gone now. I’m just sitting here, looking like an idiot. Maybe he’s trying to help me, or maybe he’s just laughing at the girl tweaking at 2 a.m. Then a different set of rational thoughts sinks in. I don’t know this man’s intentions. Shrooms or not, I don’t need to be alone with a strange man in the middle of the night. I peel my eyes away from his stare to where Freja was sitting a moment before. 

She’s still there, my little angel. As soon as she realizes my attention, she starts meowing again… a long, desperate whine that I’ve never heard before. As she whines, the man begins bending towards me. His face twists and warps, eyes bulging, cheeks sinking in grotesquely. That disgusting smile still stretched across his face. He sinks lower, begins bending over me. I remind myself that I need to protect Freja, and so I push him.

He felt so cold and wet, I felt so hot that I thought I was going to pass out. Forcing everything else out of my mind, I jump to my feet and chase after Freja. Even if I can’t catch her, I can at least get both of us away from this strange man. She scurries around the corner, and I follow after her. As we corner the hallway, I can finally see clearly again. The moon is bright, and several of my neighbors still have their porch lights on. She heads straight for our apartment. As we reach the steps, I take one moment to look behind us. A building over, there’s a man crouched behind the bushes, staring at me. Pale and hollow-eyed, he wore a sinister grin that stretched over half his face. Nausea surges through me. I’m going to puke. As fast as I can, I follow her up to our front door and lock it behind me. 

“Johnny!” No answer. No one in the living room, no one in the kitchen, and no one in the bedroom. He’s gone. I dig my phone from my pocket and scroll through the notifications. 

A text from Johnny, “Meeting up with a friend at the bar. These shrooms are a dud.”

I try calling him, straight to voicemail. Do I call 911? What the fuck do I do? My heart is pounding so hard I can barely breathe.  Freja hisses and runs towards our bedroom. I look up to see the man, face pressed against our patio door, still grinning.
