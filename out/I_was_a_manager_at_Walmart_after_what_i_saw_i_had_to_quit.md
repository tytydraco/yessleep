Hello, I am a male 28.

Ill just get straight to the point. July 12 2022, Night shift, 2:30am. Co-worker stops answering radio and his radio is just static. I send an employee to go check on him. 

When the employee went to check on him they couldn’t find him so they replied on the radio saying “Lennon (co-worker) is unaccounted for”

This was a bit strange knowing that every night i had worked with him he would always keep close to my office and talk on the radio frequently. I decided to check for myself where Lennon was because it was worrying me. Soon enough id be more than worried, id be terrified and scarred for life.

I walk outside my office and all i see is a pool of blood flowing from Lennons neck, he had killed himself and this was the most likely answer as he was holding a knife in his right hand that was up against his cut neck. I let out a blood curdling scream which alarmed the other 4 workers in the building and they sprinted towards my office as fast as possible, only 3 workers arrived though. 

As soon as 3 out of the 4 workers arrived, they all screamed and 2 of them dialled for 911 immediately. Me being curious i went to look for Ellie (the only worker who hadn’t showed up) and yet again i let out another blood curdling scream. Ellie was dead too, knife in breast/heart area while her hand gripped the knife tightly.

This must have been a double homocide, but no.. all the doors were locked and camera footage showed no break ins. This left a big discomforting situation. 

Police arrived, took the bodies. Told us they had no clue how this had happened and it was likely to be suicides. So early in the morning when most workers arrived we had to send them home so police could investigate everything.
5 Minutes later a new male worker, 18, showed up and when he got sent back another shocking thing happened..

A car with nobody inside of it ran him over and crashed straight into the Walmart building. Everyone screamed even police, it was a terror for everyone.

I still remember all this like it was yesterday. After all the events i quit on the spot and i got a therapist and i left after a year on July 3rd 2023.

I thought my life was getting better but 2 weeks ago my mother killed herself in the Walmart i worked at and now it is closed for good, I’m back in therapy now and i need to share this story because it has crossed my mind every day ever since i was back in therapy. I needed to get this off my head and if anyone went through something similar please tell me in the comments and please upvote it so people can see my story and what i have struggled with in the past year. I need people to be aware of things like this so they can save more lives than i saw being lost.

Thank you everyone for reading all this and being supportive.

I really hope no one else has to go through this. I will keep everyone updated. Goodbye for now.
