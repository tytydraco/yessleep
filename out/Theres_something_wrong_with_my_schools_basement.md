Apologies if some words are messed up, It's 1 am and I'm on my phone

Let me introduce you to how it all started. Yesterday, I woke up at 7 am and came to school like always: tired, because I stood up until 1 am and bored as hell.

I was never really involved with school, never tried my best since 4th grade and always got decent, but not good enough grades

Anyways, I was walking down the street to school when I noticed something out of place, 3 teachers close by, whom I knew, were gathered in a group, talking about something. I could see from a distance that they were trying to keep it low, which seemed weird since atleast 2 of them were always energetic. Me being the curious little turd that I am, decided to walk near them to probably take a peek into their conversation

"No, it's still out there." murmured one of them.
"Then what do we do?" whispered another.
They seemed to stop for a bit, "crap!" I thought, "they mightve gotten suspicious".
I kept walking along, and as my suspicions were confirmed, they started quietly talking again.

Before I say anything else, I just want to clarify that my class is in the highest (3rd) floor. I met up with some friends and started chattering about different things, like what we're going to play or do after school.
I think it was 5th period when our teacher rounded up all the boys and told us to go downstairs

Apparently they ordered tons of liters of sanitizer, like half a truck load full of gallons hand sanitizer. We were instructed to bring all of them at the entrance of the basement, so we did without asking any questions. Actually, no. One boy did question why we had so many, but he was quickly shut down by the teachers. "Weird but ok", I thought to myself, I think covidmay be the reason? Still weird, as our cases lowered significantly.

As we finished moving all the gallons from point A to point B the adults started putting them in the basement. 
I went back to class and rested for a while, before 2 of my friends rushed in and jokingly said "(Friend3) is stuck in (Friend4)'s basement!" (We always used to joke about friend 4)
This is when I got curious, so all 3 of us decided to go downstairs, and finally.. in the basement
We then had to, again, transfer gallons to another point, but this time inside the basement.
We had 2 paths: a dark hallway to the left and a lit hallway to the right. Ofcourse, we were told to get the gallons and move them to the right hallway
But you see, we came after all the other kids, so we were the most unsupervised. 

This is screw-up nr. 1: we took the left path out of boredom, and mostly because our help wasn't needed now.

We then had 2 more hallways, both barely being lit up by some weak lightbulbs. This is when my friends advised me to come back.

Screw up nr. 2: I didn't, for a while.
I guess luck was on my side that day because I've heard a metal object drop so hard it hurt my ears.
Needles to say, I shit myself, so I ran back to the group.

I didn't see anything, but of course those 2 hallways led to more, and I wasn't about to get stuck and die here, left alone

I'm now typing this at night, I'll update only in case I get to bring my phone to school and go down there, alone.

EDIT: Oh god I'm alone in my room and heard some keys drop a few minutes after writing this. I pray to god that was an outside noise
