My name is Harper. Yes, *that* Harper. The cop who, five years ago, was abducted by one of the wealthiest, most homicidal men in the world.

Many of you are familiar with my story. From the news. Social media. Millions of you have already watched my meltdown from a couple days ago.

You think you know me. But you don’t know the fucking half of it.

Graham's living room reeked of gasoline. 55-gallon steel drums were scattered around like landmines.

Tara and Emma were on the floor. Seated back-to-back. Chained together. Whimpering through their gags.

Graham lingered by a glass wall in one of his bespoke suits. Like he was dressed for his own funeral. He was eyeing the snow-covered forest. Watching. Waiting. Fiddling with a lighter.

I stood between Graham and the girls. Tears in my eyes. Not chained or gagged.

"Graham, this isn't right." I cried. "You said you'd let them go."

He gave me an icy stare. It was a look I knew all too well. There was no stopping him.

His phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen then moved away from the glass wall.

I begged him to free Tara and Emma from their chains.

He looked me dead in the eye. "You know they aren't special.” He reached under my shirt and pulled out a gold necklace with a "C" charm on it. “They aren't *you*."

A chill ran down my spine.

Graham knocked over one of the steel drums. Gasoline flooded the floor.

I lunged at him, but he shoved me away.

He flicked the lighter and let it fall.

Flames sprinted toward Tara and Emma.

I ripped off their gags then fumbled with the chains around their torsos. They screamed, begging me to do something.

I yelled at Graham to give me the key.

Their ankles were shackled to the floor.

Their screams twisted into rage. They called me a liar. A crooked ass cop.

They had it all wrong. That's what hurts the most.

I took one last look at Graham. He was just standing there. With that blank expression on his face.

The inferno raged. Flames were everywhere.

I fell to my knees, crawling through a curtain of smoke.

Someone grabbed me. Agent Bishop. He pulled me outside. I can still remember the alcohol emanating from his breath.

"C’mon!" Agent Bishop shouted.

"No, not me!" I screamed. "Get them– save them!"

SWAT and FBI swarmed the estate.

Agent Bishop shielded me as the entire mansion buckled and shifted off its foundation, collapsing like a planned detonation.

I gazed at the fiery rubble. Shell-shocked.

The "C" charm necklace dangled on my chest. I looked down and tucked it under my shirt.

For five years I listened to Graham preach about his legacy. How his "spree" had only just begun. A narcissist like that doesn't kill himself.

The FBI disagreed…

While I was in the hospital, two Agents interviewed me. Agent George played the good cop. He thanked me for my courage. But Agent Landry– she had a stick up her ass.

They all but confirmed Graham’s death.

I answered their questions. About Graham. His victims. My abduction. My story never changed…

I was fresh out of the academy. 13 days on the job. I clocked out and headed toward my dad's office. He was on the phone with Mayor Botta arguing about budget cuts.

I asked my dad—like I always did—if he wanted to go for a run.

He said he couldn't. "It's date night with your mom. Might get lucky."

I vomited a little in my mouth.

"You and your sister are here because of date night, you know."

"I'm well aware. Thanks." I couldn't help but smile at his childish humor.

He kissed my forehead and said how proud he was. "One day, this'll be your office and you'll be dealing with a mayor who wants to slash your budget in half."

He always supported me. And I've always been a daddy's girl.

I never thought our tiny little town would be haunted by a serial killer…

I went out for my run. The same five-mile loop we always did.

Halfway through, a cargo van drove toward me. The driver flicked on their high beams, blinding me.

I shielded my eyes as the van drove past.

Less than a minute later, headlights emerged behind me, driving much slower than the 25 mph speed limit.

I called my boyfriend Matt. On edge.

But Matt didn't pick up.

I whipped out my bear spray.

The cargo van pulled up beside me. Passenger window down. Driver shrouded in darkness.

I aimed the bear spray at the open window.

"Stay back!" I yelled.

The driver flicked on the overhead light, revealing Graham, dressed in a button-down and tie.

He flashed a warm smile. "Sorry about that. With the lights. Didn't want to hit ya."

He was too sincere. Too handsome. It made my skin crawl.

We stared at each other for what felt like an eternity.

Who was gonna make the first move?

Then he slipped on a mask. A full-face respirator. There it was– that icy stare.

I ran. But he was faster.

I fought. But he was stronger.

I woke up to the taste of my own blood. Cold stone walls. No windows. I was locked inside his wine cellar.

Agent Landry made me relive my abduction three times. Like I was the suspect.

Bitch.

She flipped through her notes. "You said he liked you– that it felt like he trusted you. Hell of a feeling. For most people trust is earned. Especially for a man who has everything to lose.”

I met her stare.

“Why trust you, Officer?”

She wanted to piss me off. And it worked.

"Why me? Why did the man with the world at his feet trust the girl who had hers chained together? 'Cause I did everything he asked."

"And you told us 'everything'?"

I wanted to punch her.

Thankfully, my fearless attorney Jade stepped in. It was time for me to go home.

Jade escorted me and my sister Sam into a conference room. Cameras flashed. Reporters shouted questions.

I nearly had a panic attack. Bright flashes trigger me. You’ll find out why.

Sam squeezed my hand like it was the only thing keeping me from running away.

Jade stepped up to the podium. "Harper is a survivor. After five years, she escaped every woman’s nightmare– being held prisoner by a serial killer. A deranged man who abducted and murdered at least nineteen women."

Jade stared down the barrel of a single lens. "Graham was a man of obscene power. A man who used his immeasurable wealth to conceal his crimes. While we can’t prosecute a dead man, we will expose those who enabled him and hold them accountable."

Outside the hospital, the press was in a frenzy.

A neckbeard with a phone stormed toward me. I’m sure you’ve seen the video. "Harper! Do you feel guilty?! You were the only survivor! How'd you escape?!”

Sam shoved him to the ground as I hurried into our SUV.

The car ride home wasn’t easy. All I could think about were Tara and Emma. Every girl– they weren’t going home.

I curled up in the back seat like a child. “I left them. I just left them. I’m a coward.”

Sam grabbed my trembling hand. “No, Harp. You’re a hero.”

The last thing I am is a fucking hero.

You know what the worst part about coming home was? My demons came with me.

I stared at my childhood home. A rustic house tucked away from the world. Surrounded by thick woods and a babbling creek.

News crews shouted from the street as Sam and Jade stood by my side.

Jade spoke up. “The man you wanted to thank– Agent Bishop– the agents said he's no longer with the Bureau.”

What the fuck? I needed to talk to Agent Bishop. He’s the one who broke my case.

Chief Tireman, who gave us a police escort from the hospital, rolled up beside us. He took over the post after my dad’s death.

Chief Tireman told me to take my time. That my job wasn’t going anywhere. In other words, I can’t have you back yet. You’re a liability.

That was fine by me. I had some shit to take care of.

Inside, I wandered the living room. It was so strange being inside my parents’ house without them there. Knowing they’d never be there.

I looked at all the family photos on the mantel. It was bittersweet. Sam in cleats. Me in ballet shoes. Mom and Dad on their wedding day.

It felt like déjà vu. Like I already lived this moment. But the next part felt new…

Sam eyed my “C” charm necklace as she poured us some tea. "Where’d you get that?"

I tucked it away. "Jade gave it to me.”

I took a sip of tea, swallowing my paranoia.

Then I heard it. His voice.

"Liar."

Graham clutched a now gasoline-drenched Sam, holding a lighter to her face.

His suit was scorched. Face burned.

"Hurt her and I’ll kill you!" I screamed.

"You can't kill me.” He whispered. “I'm a ghost.”

He set them ablaze like human torches.

That’s when I jolted awake, gasping. Drenched in sweat.

"He's alive! He's still alive!"

Sam burst into the room and rocked me in her arms. "Shhh. I'm here, Harp. It's okay. You're safe now."

**We'll never be safe. Not until he’s dead.**
