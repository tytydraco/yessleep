I heard 2 words on the radio this morning advertising the store's new flavors. The Craze had begun!


I instantly initiated Alpha 1 protocol protection for my family. My daughter especially needed protection. All groceries had to be scanned and approved, all media silenced until commercials could be edited out. Nothing could contain that two word flavoring.


I don't know what it is about those two words, but once they're said, it does something to send society plummeting into collapse. You become a druggie to the stuff, doing and saying anything for that next hit. It tends to hit women harder than men, though men are not immune.


I rushed home to further the protocol at home before it could get worse.


"Honey?" I called into the house. There was no response. 


"Becky?! Where are you?!" I searched frantically for my wife. There was no trace of her there. 


"No, no no no not already!" I thought I had more time! I thought she'd be stronger than this! 


I rushed to get my twins, Lexi and Colton, from school. They had just started, but I'm afraid I'll have to homeschool them for the next couple of months, especially Lexi. This wasn't a problem when they were younger, but now that their palettes have matured, it was best to keep them inside until I could be sure they wouldn't give in.


When we got home, the fear really set in.


Colton was frantic. "Dad, where's Mom?! She...didn't stop anywhere during errands, did she?!" 


It was Lexi who was calm. "She likes her shopping trips, Colt. We need summer clothes for next year, and they go on sale so Target can get rid of inventory. You know how mom gets around post-season deals."


Too calm. Too logical. She's grown into the target audience. 


I steeled myself and instructed my kids to stay in the house, never to unlock it unless they heard me.


I'd find their mother.


I pulled into the main complex where my wife shopped. Hundreds of mindless shambling shells spattered around the parking lot, awaiting somebody-anybody!-to put them out of their misery. 


My wife is found inside the building, shambling with her half full cart. I didnâ€™t know whether it was to late to save her or not, but by God, I had to try!


"Heyyyyy Traaaavissss~!" She slurs in a high pitched tone, some of her hair unkempt over her face, the rest in a clump over her shoulder that once resembled a bun. 


She'd been gone before I even initiated the protocol.


"We shooouuullld go pumpkin carviiiinggg after thiiiiisss! Wonnnn't that be fuuuuunnn?! I saaaawww it on Piiiintreeesssst!"


I gazed into her vapid eyes and showed her my phone. She took one look, gasped, and fainted in my arms. 


I only thank God I arrived before....well, that doesn't matter now. I had my children to protect. 


I rushed back to the fortified house with Becky still breathing. I'd lock her in the basement to ride the seasoning out before she wakes up. Colton met me in the driveway, barely holding it together. I knew it was because of worry for his mother, though there was a slight unease.


"It's just sticker shock, Colton. Mom will be fine--"


"Daditwasn'tthefirsttime-"


"What? Colton, breathe. What wasn't the first time?"


Colt took a deep breath, steeling himself despite the tears running down his face


"Mom forgot something at Target, so she went back. She bought the coffee creamer earlier, Lexi found it--"


Oh no.


I rushed into the house, but that sickly sweet and spice scent filled the house.


Lexi was holding a thermos, metal straw sticking out, a messy bun on her head. She was taking selfies when she saw me through her camera.


"Heeeeeyyyyy daaaaaadddd!" she droned, my little girl now becoming a mindless drone to the taste. I fell to my knees. I failed to protect my little girl.


"Can we go to Staaarrrbucks and get pumpkin spice laaaaaatteeeesss?"
