I just woke up with a balloon animal tied around my neck.

I live alone.

So once again, here we go honk-honkers!

So, things have gone from “mildly haunted clown trauma” to full-blown “someone’s gonna find my body face-down in a cream pie.” (actual cream pie, I know how you dirty minded fuckers are)

After the escape room incident, I started sleeping with the lights on. I also duct-taped every window shut, threw away my microwave (long story) and burned the Chuckles suit for a second time. I even saged my apartment, though I’m 95% sure I just lit cinnamon incense and coughed for forty minutes.

Did it help?

Absolutely fucking not, because last night, my Alexa said:

“Do you want to hear a joke?”

Me (half-asleep): “No.”

Alexa: “Well, he does.”

Then she played clown music. Backwards.
Do you know how much clown music already sounds cursed when played forward?

It was like someone set a carousel on fire and recorded its dying screams.

Now, I thought maybe I was just losing my mind.

Like, okay, maybe I am just a washed up party clown with a guilt complex and a sleep deficit.

However, that's when I got a call from Officer Marquez.

She was the responding officer when I filed a noise complaint a week ago (the complaint was “a demon clown is honking in my walls!” which she did not find particularly credible).

This time though, she sounded scared.

Marquez (quiet, shaky): “are you... are you alone right now?”
Me: “Always. Emotionally and physically. Why?”
Marquez: “Because we just found Greg.”

My stomach dropped like a rollercoaster going straight to hell.

Marquez: “He was in the escape room warehouse. Well, what’s left of it.”

Me: “What do you mean ‘what’s left of it’?”
Marquez: “It’s gone. Caved in. We found him under the rubble. Face painted. Wearing a clown suit. No... no skin on his hands.”

Me: “OH GOOD. A SKINLESS CLOWN GREG. TOTALLY NORMAL TUESDAY.”

Marquez: “That’s not the weird part.”

Me: “I beg to differ.”

Marquez: “The weird part is... he was smiling. Like it was the best day of his life and carved into the floor beneath him were the words:
"THE SHOW MUST GO ON.'”

So now I have a choice. Stay home and slowly unravel while clowns sneak into my dreams and eat my sanity or follow the trail and end this nightmare.

Obviously, I made the rational decision:

ROAD TRIP.

Because if horror movies have taught me anything, it’s that the only thing dumber than being a clown in a horror story... is trying to fight the clown in a horror story.

I drove to the last known address of the first clown who disappeared, the one from the birthday party before me. Travis. Or Trevor. Or maybe Trembly. (Look, I was more focused on not dying at the time.)

His address was listed on one of Meredith’s old emails I’d saved. (Yes, I snoop. I'm haunted, not polite.)

The house was out in the country. One of those roads where the GPS is like “you’re on your own now, champ.”

As I pulled up, I noticed a weird mailbox shaped like a clown’s head.
I didn’t like that it smiled at me.

The house looked abandoned. Windows cracked. 
Paint peeling.
There was this fucking music playing though.

Faint, distant carnival music, drifting out of the basement window like it had been trapped down there for years.

I knocked on the door. It opened by itself because of course it did.

Inside: clown memorabilia everywhere. Vintage posters. Broken marionettes. Dozens of red noses nailed to the walls like trophies.

On the coffee table was a note written in smeared lipstick.

“If you’re reading this, he hasn’t chosen you.. YET”

I turned to leave. My body said RUN but my feet apparently subscribed to the “bad decisions only” plan.

I opened the basement door.

The music got louder.

So did the static.

I stepped down the stairs.

Each step squeaked like a terrified mouse.

At the bottom, the room was filled with clown mannequins.
All facing the same direction toward a single TV on a rusted metal cart.

That's where that static sound had been coming from!

Then it stopped and started playing. 

Part of me was hoping this was about to be some OnlyClowns content. 

There was a clown strapped to a gurney.

Another clown walked into frame and turned to the camera, it was the scream clown with that big crooked smile.

He then turned to the clown strapped to the gurney and grabbed a big ass oversized clown hammer then proceeded to smash the clowns knees and shins, smashing the clowns legs to pieces. I watched as the clown on the gurney screamed in pain and terror. The scream clown then grabbed a blow torch and began taking it to the gurney clowns face. The screams that were coming from him were absolutely terrifying. When the Scream Clown moved, it revealed a burnt melting smile on the gurney clowns face. 

I watched on frozen in fear.

The scream clown then turned to the camera and held up a sign that read "YOU'RE NEXT."

I ran. You bet your rainbow suspenders I ran.

Fell up the stairs. Slammed the door. Tore out of the house like I’d been shot from a confetti cannon.

Then in the rearview mirror...

Standing in the middle of the road...

Was the fucking Scream Clown.

Holding a sign that read:

“COMING TO A PARTY NEAR YOU.”

So here I am.

Posting from a Motel 6 with a bottle of Jack and a baseball bat I wrapped in Christmas lights. (Why? I don’t know. It felt festive, provocative and dangerous.)

If he finds me tonight… I’ll fight. Might scream. 

Probably both.

I'm not going down easy though boys and girls!
