My mind raced as I laid in bed, covers pulled up to my chin.   


  
*Why were the aliens making Darren grow corn? Was their plan for the corn to mix with all the regular corn and be shipped out across America, tainting our food supply? Or perhaps turning us into zombie slaves? Why us- were we chosen because our little farm wasn’t growing corn like everyone else? Is everyone else in on this? Are they growing glowing corn too?*  


  
My mind reeled at the implications. And then, of course, my husband was not himself- may never be himself again. He was working for them now. I had completely lost him.  


  
And then- was he a threat? Would he actually hurt me, his wife? Most importantly, WHERE was he?  


  
I felt guilty for locking him out of the house- but I knew that Darren wasn’t the real Darren. Couldn’t be.  


  
It was hard going to sleep. My world had been turned upside down. And I had no idea what my next steps would be.  


  
Unfortunately for me, I wasn’t aware of my next steps at all.   


  
I was standing outside in the tall grass when I woke up, wearing nothing but a giant t- shirt. It was early morning and the grass was still wet with dew.  


  
I’d sleepwalked. And I’d left the back door wide open, for who knows how long.  


  
“Fuck,” I whispered. I was in trouble. I had no phone, no weapons, no keys.. No shoes.  


  
Just then the door slammed. I looked back. Darren was standing in the doorway of the house, about fifty yards off. He looked awful. If he had been pale yesterday, today he was snow white. Dark rings encircled his eyes, and his hair looked matted.   


  
I ran. He followed.

I fled to the barn, where I had some old rubber boots. I slipped them on. I had a terrible understanding that I had to get away from him.  


  
That I was in danger.  


  
That he was coming to kill me.   


  
I ran to the back of the barn, boots flapping. The door was padlocked.  


  
I heard the tractor engine blast to life. I whirled around. There he was, on the tractor, on the other end of the barn alley. The side pens were shut. I was trapped.  


  
Wildly, I searched for a way out. There was a ladder in the middle of the alley leading to the loft- maybe I could climb up, and then jump down at the entrance behind the tractor.   


  
I bolted towards it, just as the tractor advanced. I prayed, to whoever was listening, that I could make it before he ran over me or crushed me with the bucket.   


  
And I did- with seconds to spare. I leapt onto the ladder, scrambling with a speed I had no clue I possessed. Our eyes locked just as he overshot, and the pure hatred there confirmed I was in danger.   


  
I quickly ran over the rickety planks of the loft, and jumped down at the barn entrance. I was out of there before he could put it in reverse.  


  
I shot out into the open, my boots slipping in the wet grass. I looked around frantically. There was nowhere to hide- just our few buildings surrounded by open land.   


  
I took off running towards the tool shed.  


  
We weren’t people that kept guns around, so I hoped there was something in there- anything- that I could use to protect me from my alien-husband.  


  
I whipped the door open. The air was musty and stale, and the room was cluttered with tools. I frantically searched the shelves, my hands shaking.   


  
Then I saw it. The chainsaw.  


  
I’d never used anything like it before. I actually hate power tools, mostly because I think spinning blades are a bad idea.  


  
“Ok,” I whispered. “Breathe.”   


  
I knew it needed gas- but which one? There were two bottles on the shelf. Didn’t it need some sort of special oil gas? I grabbed one of the canisters, hoping it was the right gas for this thing, and poured it into the tank. I was so nervous I spilled half of it on the ground.  


  
I was interrupted by Darren charging into the shed with the tractor.  


  
The noise of the boards tearing and metal tools crashing was deafening. Something heavy fell and gashed my forehead. I was stunned. I couldn’t believe he was this stupid.   


  
He was trying, unsuccessfully, to back up and ram the building again- but the tractor was hung in the debris.   


  
Which meant he was now getting down and coming towards me.  


  
Frantically I reached for the chainsaw. It had been turned over and gas glugged out onto the floor. I silently prayed it was enough to start the thing.   


  
I screwed the cap on and pumped the primer. I ripped the cord. Nothing happened.  


  
Darren was off the tractor. He looked worse than ever. He was soaked with clammy sweat, and I could see clumps of hair had fallen out. His eyes gleamed silver and I knew there was no trace of him in there, that it wasn’t Darren at all.  


  
I turned my full attention to the chainsaw and began ripping the cord as hard as I could.   


  
“SHIT!” I screamed, shaking the chainsaw. That’s when I saw it. The killswitch.   


  
I flipped it, ripped the cord, and the chainsaw sputtered to life. I stood up and whirled the saw at Darren. It was heavier than I expected and the blade swung low, but I still managed to slice his upper thigh.  


  
Thick, silvery liquid sprayed out of the leg coating us both.   


  
He slumped down to one knee. I swung the saw back at him again.  


  
*It’s not him its not him its not him*, my brain chanted.  


  
The blades connected with his neck, and his head flopped to the side, still connected by a string of flesh. Silvery, mercury- like blood blasted out of the wound and sprayed everything around us.  


  
I screamed at what I had done in this surreal situation.   


  
I dropped the chainsaw and ran out of the ruined tool shed. Blood dripped down my face and mixed with the silver liquid, covering my body in a sticky gray slime.  


  
I ran to our empty house, adrenaline pumping. It was completely silent.  


  
I found my cell phone laying on the table.  


  
I picked it up and dialed my mother.  


  
“Mom,” I said with forced calm, “You were right. Darren does NOT know what he’s doing.”  
I talked to her for a long while. But no matter what she says, I’ve decided to stay. This is my home now.   


  
I’ll start on the cleanup tomorrow.  


  
And as for the corn? I noticed my neighbor has a big sprayer. I’m hoping RoundUp will kill [it…..](https://www.reddit.com/r/SunshineScarystories/comments/x88quz/story_index/)
