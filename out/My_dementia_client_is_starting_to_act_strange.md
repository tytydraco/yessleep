To start this out, I’ve already contacted my agency. I’ve already contacted her family about the things she’s been saying. They all just agree it’s her condition worsening. I don’t think I agree. I’m scared and I need help. 

I’ve been working with her for several months now. She’s elderly but not so elderly you’d say “wow she’s ancient.” She’s rich. Richer than I thought people could be in middle of nowhere America. I can’t say her name due to confidentiality nor even my state. I’ve lovingly started calling her “rich client” to my friends and loved ones when they ask about my work. 

I do love being a caregiver. I’ve sat through it all. The sun-downing episodes, the hallucinations of spouses long dead, mistaking me for their son or daughter, I’ve seen it all. I’ve even seen a client who told me in different words that he would die the next day. And he did. 

This client is different. She stares into me. She’s not looking past me or ascribing past events to me. It’s not like she’s “recognizing” me. It’s like she’s reading me. Her cold blue eyes beam straight into my soul and I’m terrified of what she sees. 

Frequently during these… I’ll call them episodes for lack of better terms, she rasps out in a voice that has a different canter to her own. It doesn’t match her cadence nor her dialect nor her inflections. It’s subtle enough that someone else likely wouldn’t notice. I just happen to have studied psychoanalysis within school and part of that included vocality. Believe me when I tell you that this is not her normal voice. It’s harsher, darker, and contains a lilt that isn’t from this time. Sure it might be her childhood accent but I’m not so sure. That was what I had told myself at first. 

It started with innocent things. Her rattling off that voice and facts she knew about me from me sharing. I do tend to share the surface level details about my life with clients. I think it’s important for them to be able to build that trust with me. I was okay when she did this. It was off-putting but no different than any other dementia symptom is. After all, this was the same client that once looked me dead in the eyes and said “I bet your puppy is crying without you.” Weird but not scary. 

I wish I could say it stayed that way. I would sleep better at night if it had. I believe I was three months into caring for her when it got scary. 

It was dark out. Prime sundowning hours. I was prepared, as I always am, and was continuing her bedtime routine as she went through the motions of agitation and pacing. Then as I was fixing her bed up and getting her pajamas out of the cabinet, she stopped still and stared at me. I didn’t realize what was happening at first since a lot of times she’ll pause her pacing to watch what I’m doing and chide me on it not being correct. That silence and stillness hovered for maybe a minute before my senses caught up to me. I looked up at her and she was just standing there so still. Her shakes were gone, she didn’t blink, she didn’t sway, all things outside of her normal behavior. I launched up thinking she might be having a seizure or stroke of some kind. It would’ve been easier if she was. 

She opened her mouth. She opened it wide. I would’ve said a stroke for another client but this? I could hear the hinge joint in her jaw grinding as it dislocated downwards. I almost screamed. Not from terror, more from the fact that I’m a caregiver and when medical episodes arise your brain switches into that instant response mode. I’ve had it before with client heart attacks. I probably would’ve screamed had there been anyone else in the house. Getting others there quickly is important. 

Instead I just started doing what I do. “Hunny can you hear me? What’s going on? I need you to talk to me baby. I can’t help if I don’t know what’s wrong.” I tried to sit her down but it was like every muscle in her body had locked. I was genuinely thinking seizure activity at that point. I was partially kneeling and guiding her step by step backwards to a chair when it happened. 

She grabbed the back of my neck. I know, I know, all you other caregivers are groaning. Never put your back to a sun-downing client. In my defense she’d never been violent before. She wasn’t even truly violent this time. She gripped the pressure point on the back of my neck. It triggered me more than it actually hurt. I don’t want to get into it but I was abused my some bad people when I was a kid and they’d hold me there. I thought her grabbing that was a coincidence. A very unfortunate one but something I’ve handled in the past. It wasn’t. 

She forced my head back to look at her. I hadn’t even noticed that her jaw was reset from me trying desperately to get her sitting. She spoke. She spoke in that voice that wasn’t hers. That wasn’t… human. If you could imagine what the Oracle of Delphi sounded like as she delivered prophecies, this was the same. Some ancient being using a human voice as its microphone. 

What she said was just… deeply personal. Something I’ve never told anyone. And then she said something else. “It knows what you’ve done.” What the hell is It? No idea your guess is as good as mine. I admit I shrieked when she said all that. Shoved her hand off and scrambled away on all fours like some kind of animal. 

By the time I was across the room she was her normal self. Not even her sun-downing self, just her normal self on especially good days. She smiled kindly at me and thanked me for the pajamas then laid in bed. I’d forgotten about them by that point but she wasn’t a dressing client so I just stared at her for a moment and said “You’re welcome Ms Client” and left the room to compose myself. When I checked on her ten minutes later she was asleep. 

I called my office immediately. Told them about what just happened and asked when my replacement was coming in. Told them about the change in condition and the possible medical episode I couldn’t explain. I left out what she had said to me, just told them she was able to talk after maybe four minutes. They told me my replacement was scheduled to be there in 30 and recommended I call emergency services to have her vitals checked and potential transport. They told me they’d inform the family. So that’s what I did. EMS arrived and could tell I was rattled but I think they ascribed it to my age. I am a young carer. People my age don’t tend to react well to things like this. I was okay with them thinking that. My replacement arrived at about the same time as EMS so I did handover with both of them simultaneously and gave my number if they had further questions. Called the office again to ask if I could leave. They said yes. So I did. I drove home in silence. My partner asked what had happened and all I could say was that a client had accidentally triggered me during an episode. He understood. 

It’s happened three times since then. Every single time it gets worse. She tells me their names. The dates. Their appearances. The things I did to survive. The exact shade of my clothes. The crinkles in my young facial expressions. And always finishes it with some iteration of “It knows what you did. He was there.” 

I feel like I should report this beyond what I have. Maybe go to the cops or something. The details she knows about me… she would’ve had to have been there or seen videos. Maybe her husband did? I don’t know. Can you even prosecute an old lady with dementia? Is there even a point in trying to do anything legally? My office offered to reassign me but I know what that means. They’ll drop my hours until I can’t afford rent anymore in hopes I’ll quit. I’m barely paid enough to get by in the first place. 

I don’t know. I would feel more comfortable reporting it to police if it wasn’t for the things that happen when I’m home. I wake up in the middle of the night to eyes. They’re not human eyes. Sometimes when the heater kicks on I get the faintest hint of that voice too. It common in ptsd to hallucinate but this feels different. It’s wrong. Every night it happens, the next shift I go in, my client looks at me like she knows. She goes still like she’s listening to someone then nods. I’m scared to know who she hears. I’m scared to know who’s holding the microphone.
