This is a stupid story, but I want to know what happened here. 


This happened almost a year ago now, but since I've found this reddit page, I've decided to share it here. 


I usually wasn't allowed out of the house by myself without asking/announcing first, but that day my parents were out somewhere for a little while, must've been to buy groceries or something I can't remember exactly. I don't usually get outside much, so I wanted to go for a walk and get a Monster from a local convenience store. I left the house while it was pretty cloudy outside, making it appear darker during the day, but I didn't really mind, it was only a fifteen minute walk away at most. 



I began walking, headphones on and listening to some music full blast, which I suppose wasn't a good idea, but oh well. The route I usually took went through a small field with a few houses lining the outside of it. It was slightly windy, so I had my coat on (I usually don't wear it, this isn't a particularly important detail but I'm adding it anyway). As I walked through the field, my usually paranoid self kept looking behind me as I felt like I kept hearing sounds, simultaneously telling myself it's just the wind and I'm out in nature, of course there would be noises. 



Though as I walked, the song I was listening to ended, and while I paused it to stop it from replaying, trying to find another song, I heard what sounded like feet on concrete. Of course, it easily could've been mine, but as I stopped walking, the footsteps stopped just after mine. I looked behind me and around me, but there was nothing. I know there usually is animals in the long grass, so I chalked it up to that. I found another song to play and kept walking. 



I soon got to the store, pausing my music and taking me headphones off, and because of how dark it had gotten, the small lamppost outside it had turned on (it was triggered to turn on when the sun wasn't shining on it) which made it feel like night-time. This kind of freaked me out, as I am still anxious of the dark, but I shook it off. The doorbell shook as I opened the door, and the fluorescent lights were slightly buzzing, flicking slightly, but that was normal, as I'd been here a few times. 


But this time it seemed different, maybe it was the weather or how there was no one around, but it felt off. The cashier didn't look at me when I walked in, looking down at his phone, and I felt a little uneasy, as he seemed to be a little annoyed I had interrupted him watching whatever he was watching on his phone, and I also hadn't seen him working here before, but I continued to find the Monster I was looking for. 



I grabbed a white Monster from the fridge and grabbed a chocolate bar too, as I had some extra money, and walked around, looking to see if I could get anything else. While I was looking, I saw out of the corner of my eye that the cashier went through those black door flaps people put on door frames, so I was alone in the front of the store. That also made me feel a little uneasy, but kept looking for something to buy, partly because I wanted something else but also because I wanted to make myself look busy, as there was now no one at the counter. 



I wait a bit for someone to come back, but after a minute or so of browsing, no one had come back yet. You'd assume you'd want someone there, as you could easily get robbed, but I just kept waiting. As I was waiting, I was startled by the doorbell dinging, showing another person had entered. I sighed, shaking of the shivers it gave me as I kept looking around. I could hear the footsteps walking around of the other person, and it both gave me comfort that I wasn't alone, and freaked me out being alone in this store with a stranger. 



I finally hear the black flaps on the door hit the sides of the doorframe, and I look over, seeing a different person there. I assumed they switched shifts, so it put me more at ease. I walk over, paying for my snacks and drink, and as I'm paying, I look toward the small screen that showed the security cameras around the store. I didn't think it was weird that the screen was there, as most stores have them in the back rooms, but this was normal for a lot of stores where I live (not sure if it's normal elsewhere but I've seen it a few times out of my town). 



But I felt like I couldn't move as I looked at the empty aisles and remembered the other person that had entered the store. I hadn't heard the bell again, maybe there was a blind spot? Though I looked around me, not hearing the footsteps anymore or seeing anybody. I thanked the cashier and grabbed my things, before heading out of the store. I stood just outside of the store, as I was putting my change in my wallet (I find it awkward to do so at the counter) though as I do so, I hear the bell of the store door again. 



I freeze, but after a few moments, manage to turn around. It was the cashier. She looked tired, bags under her eyes, as she had at the counter, but her eyes were wider now. I couldn't reallt tell if it was in fear, shock, or whatever. I asked her if she was okay, figuring maybe I hadn't paid enough or something. She looked at me, looking me up and down, before saying "did you see the first guy?". I assume she means the cashier that was on his phone, so I nodded, "yeh, why?". She looked back into the store, and spoke to someone behind her, maybe that same guy? 


I stood there awkwardly, just wanting to leave, before she turned to me again. "He wanted to say something to you" she says, and though I am way out of my comfort zone due to social anxiety, I agreed. She moved out of the way, and the same annoyed employee looked at me. He looked behind me, and I looked too, being paranoid as ever now, and i looked back to him. "She said you wanted to say something?" I said, and he cleared his throat, scratching the back of his neck. "Don't ring the bell" he said, sounding slightly irritated, and I was confused for a moment, before remembering the bell earlier. 



Though I know I didn't touch the door, I assumed it was the wind, as it was still windy now, and i nodded, apologising, and after a moment, he headed back into the store. The girl nodded at me, and headed back inside. I was confused and slightly freaked out, so I walked quickly back home. 



As I was heading back, I walked through the field, the long grass blowing in the wind that had picked up since earlier, and I walked past one of the old trees that lined the path of the field. I physically froze as the wind slightly died down for a moment, and I looked at one of the branches. A bell. 

I wasn't sure what to think, or do. I know it couldve been some kid or someone putting it there while I was at the store, but the sentence the cashier had told me ran through my head, and made my heart beat quicker. "don't ring the bell". It was even creepier that the wind had slightly slowed down, so the bell wouldn't shake and ring. I looked around quickly, feeling like someone was around me now, but no one was there. After the confusion and fear passed, I was intrigued almost. What would happen if I did ring it? It could be some stupid prank. But as an avid true crime and horror fan, I've heard enough stories to know that is the LAST thing you'd want to do in this situation. I didn't fancy having an old curse bought upon me. 



I stared at it for a few moments, before walking right past it, walking quicker now. Though I wanted to blast music in my ears to distract myself, I still felt off. I quickly got home, though it felt like forever. I didnt tell anyone about it, as it could've been some weird prank as I mentioned before, but either way, I still think to this day what would've happened if I didn't adhere the cashiers warning, and would've rung the bell. 



I went back the next day, but the bell wasn't there, just the string laid on the ground. Did someone else get the same warning and ring it? I dont know, and I'm sure I won't get any answers. All I know is that was the weirdest and creepiest thing I'd ever experienced.
