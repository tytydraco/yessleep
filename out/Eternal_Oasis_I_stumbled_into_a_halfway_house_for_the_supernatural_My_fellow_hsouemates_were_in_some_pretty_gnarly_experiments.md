"Breakfast?"

"Uh, sure."

I've never been served pancakes and eggs sunny side up by a ghost before, but there's a first for everything. The guy was a teenager, a preppy high school kid bleeding bright colors, a black and gold letterman jacket clashing with dark red hair. He didn't look happy to see me, fingers clenched a little too tight around a jug of maple syrup. 

"For the record, I don't want you here," he said in a low grumble. And before I could offer a reply, "tell me when to stop." He tipped the jug and started pouring, and I found myself mesmerized by the sight of gold pooling on my stacked pancakes. I didn't know what to say, so I waited in painful silence, save from Conrad humming in the kitchen, making himself breakfast. *What did artificially created vampires even eat?* I wondered to myself, my gaze trained on my pancakes slowly being suffocated in a waterfall of syrup. 

It was too late to say stop, and something told me this ghost boy was hell bent on ruining my breakfast. 

I opened my mouth to say stop when Conrad slumped down next to me, delicately stopping the jug from drowning my eggs. "If you reject a ghost's offer, you're pretty much asking to be haunted." He shot me a smirk, and I noticed he looked better this morning. But I could still see him in my mind. I could hear his screams at the mercy of Dr. Carlisle. Conrad cleared his throat. "Okay, I made that up. But don't hurt Matt's feelings, he's already dead." 

"I heard that," the ghost —Matt— grumbled, navigating to the sink to clean the dishes. 

"You were supposed to," Conrad chuckled, his Aussie accent coming out in full swing. It was hard to accept him as both the street kid turned into a monster, and the brooding vampire with a sardonic bite. "When will you stop terrorizing our human guests?" 

"When they leave." The ghost boy wasted no time, sitting down opposite me and pulling out his phone. I found myself staring at him in a kind of awe mixed with confusion. Could ghosts use their phones? How did ghost physics work? It's always been my understanding that they can't touch real life objects. Though I did get most of my paranormal knowledge from movies and TV. 

Matt didn't look up from his phone, and looking closer, I caught the slightest smear of red tainting his left temple. I wondered if the afterlife, whatever it was in this world, was intentionally photoshopping his wounds, because just by looking at him for a fraction of a second, I could tell he had been a victim of murder. 

His jersey was the prime evidence, scuffed sleeves and reddish stains highlighted in the gold, while hidden in the black. Before I could question why a high school kid had ended up at a hotel for the dead, a hotel for supernatural creatures, the door flew open, and I caught Matt jump slightly, his gaze briefly leaving his phone, lips curving into a scowl at the newcomer. 

Unluckily for me, Noah was nowhere to be seen. I had a feeling he was staying away, probably in his room, or maybe he had gone exploring. It was a pretty big building, after all, and I was quickly realizing that it was the basis for some fucked up human experiments. Still though, I had told myself not to think about any of it. Not about the genetically engineered vampire, or the ghost serving me breakfast. I was focusing on the here and the now, not the hotel's grisly past. 

"Good morning!" A familiar voice sliced through the awkward silence, which was Matt tapping his phone screen a little too hard (again, ghost physics), and Conrad pulling out a plastic tupperware dish filled with a mushy red substance I didn't want to know the context of. He was spooning it into his mouth, lazily, when a hurricane slammed into the dining room, also known as Cass, freshly showered and dressed in a baby pink bathrobe, her red hair hanging in damp rat tails in her face. 

"Con, what did I say?" she spoke in a melody, which, from the look of Matt's face, was already making him consider relocating to someplace quieter. "No eating at the table." 

Conrad ducked his head, fingers tightening around his fork. My stomach churned, watching a slither of red ooze from each prong. "Tables were made to be eaten at," he said matter-of-factly, risking another forkful. I could already tell with the way the guy had visibly stiffened in his chair, the two of them did not get along. Matt was clearly used to their arguments, already distracted from his phone. I saw the ghost of a smile tug at his lips, and once again my gaze went to smeared red painting his hairline. The more I noticed it, the clearer it was, like I could peel away this facade and see who, or what he really was. 

"Indeed they were, my dearest Conrad." 

Speaking fluent sarcasm, this girl was the female version of him. She leaned over the boy, lips stretched into a fake smile. Her eyes flicked to his breakfast. "However, cafe-de-milkman, who I know you killed yesterday and turned into one of your famous 'brekkie' broth's– is not welcome at the table." 

Swiftly, she swiped the tupperware away from the vampire, and shoved it back into the refrigerator, replacing it with a silver flask. "Rai saw you charming the poor guy on your break yesterday," she murmured, lips practically kissing the back of his neck. Cass's expression was fierce– and before Conrad could reply in what I could only describe as a whine, she straightened up and poured herself a fresh cup of coffee. 

Matt was smiling to himself, which was rare. "That is the last time I'm tolerating your draconian killing sprees, when we have a perfectly good supply of A positive," she said, with the tone of a mother. Cass seemed remarkably different from the first time I'd met her. "Next time, young Dracula?" She spoke through a sip of coffee. "I will not be so nice."

"You're not nice, anyway."

Her head snapped up like a snake, eyes flicking to him. "What was that?" 

Conrad sipped the flask with an eye roll, though he didn't respond, only offering a scoff. Cass joined us, slipping into a chair next to Matt. She poured herself a helping of cereal, before flashing me a smile. "So, Winnie, how are you guys settling in?" she spoke through a mouthful of Reeses Puffs, and I found myself wondering what exactly this girl was. She definitely was not human. 

Her face was pinched, pretty features and razor sharp eyes, like she was staring directly into my soul. She acted human, though, spilling her cereal (and coffee) all over herself, enough for Conrad to make a point of skating his chair away from her. I thought his eyes were going to get stuck in the back of his head from all the incessant rolling. 

"Good," I lied, spooning up soggy eggs and forcing them into my mouth. They tasted more syrup than eggs. It's not like I could tell her I had been plagued by nightmares and visions of the hotel inhabitants' untimely deaths and transformations by a psycho scientist's hand. I found my gaze trained to his first creation, a disgruntled vampire, who was leaning his chin on his hand, a thoughtful and yet incredibly lost look in his eyes. "I'm okay." I told Cass. 

The girl raised her eyebrow. "Oh, so there's been no—" 

"Cut it out," a familiar grumble came from the door. Rai, in checkered sweats, a towel clumsily thrown over his head. He cleared his throat, gesturing behind him. "Your human friend-boy-thing is in his room."

*Human, friend, boy, thing.*

What a nickname! 

His gaze shot to Cass, and I caught warmth, a blush creeping into his cheeks. "Easy on the stray, Cass," his voice was softer around the edges, especially with her name. From the look on Conrad's face, the way his finger was slowly slipping between his lips and pretending to force it down his throat in a barfing motion, the two were closer than I'd initially thought. "She's new to all of this." His gaze flicked to Conrad. "Bro, do you need some Pepto Bismol or something?" 

"When you're in the room." The vampire muttered, and Cass audibly laughed. 

This was exactly the kind of morning I wasn’t expecting. It was peaceful, almost homely. The dining room seemed to be their place of solace, where banter was exchanged whether they were vampire, werewolf, or dead in general (I still didn't know what Matt was). I liked it. In a way, I could almost see myself fitting in one day, if this place ever opened up to humans, and if I wasn't being plagued by these kids' haunting pasts. 

I felt comfortable until Cass reached across the table to grab my hand. She was gentle, her fingers ice cold, wrapping around mine. The girl's eyes were soft and sincere, and I could tell she was going to welcome me properly. 

That was until something inside me seemed to snap, to come apart, and I was unraveling with it. Reality seemed to contort around me, blurring into one confusing haze, like I was being dragged down into the depths of the ocean. When I tried to tug away, the sensation grew worse until I was stuck, my body detached from me, my mind shattered into fragments I couldn't reach. I've been woven inside two minds already, both of which have plunged me into someone else's nightmare, someone else's agony. 

But this time it was different. 

Because there was no heavy breathing, no gasping, no sex, no screaming. In fact, it was mind numbingly quiet. Goosebumps crawled along my arms like vines of ivy. For some reason I wanted to scream. It was too quiet. Too calm. Too… Devoid of everything. It felt like I was suffocating on my own breaths. And it was cold. A chill that I couldn’t quite shake worked its way down my fingertips, weaving its way into my hands and freezing me in place. It felt like I was trapped. 

And that’s when I heard it. A trickle of water. Just a few drops. I almost thought my mind was playing tricks on me. It was like a continuous drip in the back of my head. And when I finally peeled open my eyes, I gasped. A strangled scream left my lips as I thrashed around. Water surrounded me from every direction, my hair fanning out around me. Glass encased me in this watery prison. It was almost like I was on display. Like a fish stuck in a bowl. My fists beat against the glass furiously, shrieks escaping my mouth. Bubbles rose to the surface in a flurry. It was suffocating, a weight on our chest, a dull pain causing back spots to blur her vision. *Drowning*. Her thoughts whispered. 


*I'm drowning.*

There was a strange cracking noise as the glass encasing her slowly gave way, her battered fists bloody, penetrating sharp splinters. She breathed in, and then out. In, and out. In, and… I waited for her exhale of breath and the rush of bubbles flying up around her. Instead, there was a surge of air blowing my hair back.  

I was perched on a bridge. The same one Noah and I crashed through. And standing dangerously close to the edge was Cass, enveloped in a blur of fiery red hair whipping around her in a halo. I could hear her sobbing from where I was, sharp inhales and shaky breaths. Real breaths. Human breaths. They burned like fire, sharp strikes climbing up and down her throat and writhing in the root of her lungs. Her legs shook like leaves as she peered down at the water below her, inky black; welcoming.

"Cassandra, it's okay," The voice was a low murmur, one that Cass's mind automatically reached out for. But there was nothing, only oblivion stretched out in front of her. "We'll find another doner, don't you worry." The woman's voice was her mother, because she cried out to her. 

I could see glimpses of a bedroom, pastel pink walls covered in flowers, definitely ones that had been drawn by a child. There were twinkling lights strewn across the walls and the bed frame. It was comforting and pretty. 

Yet nothing, not even the glow in the dark stars on the walls, could mask the machine at the side of her bed which helped her breathe. The plastic tubes stuck inside her nose were uncomfortable, and sometimes it was exhausting to just fucking breathe, and even that was like sucking in tiny shards of glass. Cass knew the only way she was going to live, was if her parents provided her with that lifesaving piece of her that was useless— because hers was royally fucked. Her lungs had malfunctioned, betrayed her body and refused to work properly. But deep down, I could feel something that was more painful than breathing writhing all inside her. 

Guilt. How could she take away one of her parents' lives for her own? Dr. Carston had told her to think about it, and she had. Cass had thought about it until she couldn't think any more, until the idea of thinking made her brain hurt. But that night, she didn't want to think anymore. Cass didn't want to think full-stop. Which had brought her to the old bridge she used to sit on as a teenager, when her parents would haul her (and her stupid breathing machine) all the way from her dad's car, where she'd have to stop and sit for a while and take rest stops because breathing hurt her. That was why Cass had found herself at that bridge, standing on the edge, her toes curled over the side, hands squeezed around the metal railing. It made sense in her head. She could go to sleep, and the physical pain, as well as mental turmoil would disappear. She wasn't in her right mind, and Cass knew that.

She knew stepping into the dark would kill her mother and father mentally, but it would save them physically. And that was enough for her. 

But still, there was that voice in her head, a voice she had tried to shove down and swallow, but it was all encompassing, drowning her, as cold and unforgiving as the stream of water down below. 

*Jump*. Her mind whispered. It will feel so good to just… Jump. Just Let go.

Whitened knuckles gripped the railing and then slowly relaxed. In that fraction of a second, I felt this strange sense of relief. An overwhelming amount of bliss. That was the exact moment she decided to let go. It wasn't like flying, just as she had imagined. Cass didn't think she would be conscious, and the darkness would swallow her up once she let her fingers slip from the bars. It was falling. Plummeting. 

And despite the fall, despite the fear, despite the cold, I couldn’t help but cling to the overwhelming amount of peace that I felt when she finally sank below the surface, that water washing away all her problems. Her lungs - our lungs- burned, our vision blurred and our will to fight dissolved.

And at last… She was free.

Until narrow fingers were wrapped around her arm… Dragging her across spiky rocks, and this time she could not breathe. She couldn't breathe, and it wasn't like the other times, the other times she had gotten used to, when Cass had sucked in oxygen through the plastic stuck between her nose. No. 

This was agony. This was pain strong enough to wish she had not been saved. The world swam in and out, and so did her mind. So did I. I saw it in flashes. The freezing cold water, and then the warm cloth of a car seat. There was a shadow in the front. But he didn't turn around. Cass was too breathless to speak, to think, to suck oxygen into her lungs. 

Another flash, and she was inside a prison of glass. This time though… She could breathe. But her breaths were caught in bubbles around her, stealing away her screams. The sharp edge of a blade slicing into her abdomen, and the dizzying light above her, blinding her, a surgical mask, and cold, cruel eyes. Cass was told to scream, and she did, but it was never good enough. And so began an endless monotonous hell. 

She was plunged into ice cold water, where she found her lungs could work again, and breathe again—and Cass was told to break the glass. She tried, but her wail, whatever this thing was that had been put inside her, wasn't working. So, it was back to the drawing board. Literally. 

Cass was shoved onto a surgical table, a mask was planted over her mouth, and in went the blade. Sometimes she distracted herself by counting the ceiling tiles, or the amount of time it took for the man's pristine white gloves to be slick in the most brilliant, horrifying shade of red. It didn't hit her until she saw it for herself, that it was her blood that stained everything. It was her blood that spattered the floor, and blankets she was lying on. 

She saw her blood running in sharp rivulets, intense red dripping from her skin, seeping onto stainless steel pressed to her naked back and dribbling from her chin. It was so… cold. Her wrists wouldn't move, and her body did not look like her own, her torso twisted and wrangled out of shape, while her legs were gone, replaced by a horrific, bulging mound of flesh twitching underneath a pale blue blanket. 

The feeling in her body, in her mind, started to fade with every cruel stab into her, the blade cutting through and severing her voice from her throat, and then all sensation below her torso. After a while of screaming, or trying to scream, her thoughts started to fade away, drifting into an eternal slumber that she was thankful for. There was a point when she did scream, and that scream managed to break the glass. But it also shattered her throat, and didn't stop. It carried in a wail which burned her lungs and paralyzed her body. 

At least she couldn't feel it. 

Her mind went silent, eerily silent, and yet she was still there, still floating around in a void of her making, while her body became this man's canvas to create banshee wail's that sent shadowy figures flying back, and glass splintering, exploding around her. She witnessed her own body coming apart and back together, being hacked into and sewn up, like she was Elizabeth Frankenstein. Soon after, sensations stopped completely. Pain no longer felt like pain, reduced to nothing, while anger and frustration and fear blossomed into one singular feeling which was just… numb.

Her eyes were open, unblinking, and dazed, staring at the light above her. 

Cass was half aware that she was not alone. There was a guy several feet away, and he was screaming. Which she could hear. While she drowned in her own numbness, this boy writhed on the bed he was strapped to, his mouth opening and closing, revealing incisors that did not make sense, and yet this man's body wasn't one of a man at all.

He was a monster. His bare back moved like it was alive, flesh writhing and wriggling up and down his bones–something spiking through his veins. She saw it when his body thrust into an arch, inky black tendrils clawing up his face and bleeding into his eyes. His mouth was smeared red, chunks of flesh clinging to his teeth. But his eyes were terrified. His expression was still… 

Still human. 

*Kill me.*

His voice came out in a vicious snarl that only elevated his screams. They didn't hurt her. Cass had blocked everything out. But I couldn’t. His cries bled into me, strangled and feral. When Cass didn't answer, the man let out a shriek, his wrists rattling in the restraints. She could see where flesh had built up between his nails, bulging pieces of fat clinging to him. "Kill me." The boy said again, this time in a whine. "Please." 

No, he wasn't a boy, Cass thought dizzily. 

He was a vampire. Genetically engineered, just like her. Needles stuck into him filled with poisonous oblivion. Just like her. 

Just like the pretty sandy haired witch, who was a success. 

And the high school boy… who wasn't.

She could still see his body, dumped with the other rejects. 

There was no doubt in her mind that she wouldn't be able to kill the vampire, and yet, Cass found herself feeling for the first time in a while. Sympathy. 

It bubbled behind her tongue and wrenched her chest. No more words were exchanged. Cass made a promise to herself, then. She would kill this beast, like putting down an animal, and then she would kill herself. She would scream until her own brains leaked from her ears, rusty coins bubbling between her lips. And she wouldn't stop until this thing, this tumor inside of her, finally let go. 

"Good morning," the all too familiar grumble stirred her thoughts, and Cass craned her neck. The vampire called him Dr. Freak-en-stein in his thoughts, and she had to agree. Tall, dark hair slicked back and a cartoonish smile. The man pushed his way through a large metal door into his laboratory of sorts. Where he kept his rats. 

Following him were his twins. College aged kids. *These particular rats were allowed out of their cages.* Cass didn't know their names, but she did know that the boy was a failure, while the girl was a success. 

"I thought you should know that I am in touch with a buyer, and will be selling you tonight." His smile was triumphant, and Cass realized she was feeling something else. Hate. Passionate, burning hatred running through her like the poison that bastard had plunged into her veins. The vampire didn't speak, but he did twist around and glare at her. Do it. His lips moved, pleading with her. Fucking do it! 

It only took her a moment to decide, her eyes watching as Dr Freak-en-stein's son strode over to where the vampire was strapped down. With a wicked smirk, he leaned over the boy and spit directly in his face. That was the catalyst that made Cass change her mind about having mercy. When had she been given mercy? 

When had she been given the opportunity to run? To live?

Screaming had become part of her, even if it had ravaged Cass's insides and hollowed her out completely. It swelled inside her, inside us both; a tumor creeping up her throat and gritted between her teeth. It rattled her body, locking itself at the back of her tongue, ready to tear her– and me– apart. 

"Wait." *The vampire was called Connor, or Conrad, or something like that.*

Conrad. 

I knew it was him. The whirlwind in my mind confirmed that, seeing this broken and monstrous side of him. But for Cass to confirm it was in fact him, and those nightmares were in fact real, it was enough to allow me to retract from Cass's mind for a moment, my phantom fingers slipping from her contorted thoughts. 

His voice was a sharp breath, pulling me back in. "Wait, what?" Conrad writhed on the table he was strapped toa, managing to lift himself onto his elbows. "You're doing what with us?" 

"Wasn't it obvious?" The twin boy spoke up with a triumphant smile. His sister did not share his grin. Instead, her eyes were trained on the ground. Cass could still see uneven stitches hiding the filthy secret that had sliced off the top of Dr. Carlisle's precious daughter. The girl cowered behind a halo of sandy colored curls sticking to tear stained cheeks. Glazed over eyes occasionally found her father, before she ducked her head lower. The twin boy, on the other hand, had his father's smile and the same cruel eyes. 

"I'm sorry, did you actually think my dad was going to keep you?" The boy spoke through a mouthful of saliva, spitting hatred with each word, but Cass knew that look in his eyes. Envy. He hated looking at his sister, the success, and this stray cat dragged off of the street that had quickly turned into his father's most prized fucking possession. 

"You're a rat." The boy hissed through his teeth. "And dad is getting rid of his rats." 

"Rowan." Dr. Carlisle's voice was hard, razor sharp around the edges. "Do not talk to my subjects like that. Apologize to him."

"But–" 

"Apologize." 

"But that's what you said! You said they were rats."

"Indeed," he said. "But they are still my children."

"*Children*," Conrad spoke through a sharp breath, almost a laugh. 

Dr. Carlisle nodded. "I took you from the streets and made you better. What else would you call me?" 

"A fucking psychopath." 

Cass had never seen the doctor lose his cool. He usually saved his pent up aggression for the surgical table. But when he struck like a snake, wrapping his fingers around the vampire's chin, and forcing him to look him in the eye, forcing him to drink in this hopeless reality of what he truly was, she felt fear for the very first time.

"We don't say psychopath, my dear Conrad." He said sternly. "I am a doctor." 

Fuck this.

Counting the seconds it took for Rowan Carlisle to spit out sorry under his breath, Cass heaved in a breath which was painful, and then another that was relieving. Her first scream was too weak, more of a whimper escaping her throat. When the floor rumbled, she let the thing carry through her, a wail she couldn't control shredding her apart from the inside. And she was happy. Cass was happy to release this cry to kill the monsters looming over her. Time seemed to slow down, and Cass's mouth was stretching wider and wider, her lips cracking apart, eyes watering, blood vessels exploding. 

It wasn't noticeable to her, the sudden force slamming into the room, plucking the twins off of their feet, and bringing Conrad's surgical table, with him still tied to it, crashing down on the floor. 

However, Cass was aware of her own bed toppling on its side, and her mutated body hitting the floor with a sickening smack. Pain. It felt good. The raw, razor sharp spikes slicing through her head felt good. The blood running down her temples… felt so fucking good. 

Screaming. I heard it before Cass; a cacophony of shrieks which weren't hers, and yet somehow they joined hers perfectly. Rowan, rolling around in shattered glass, his face pressed into the ground, blood slicked hands clamped over his mouth, lips forming an agonizing ‘O’. 

He hadn't even noticed what was left of his father, who had bared the brunt of her wail, which had been genetically designed to rip its way through a human's eardrums, seeping into the human body like a virus, just to tear it apart from the inside out. Poor Dr. Carlisle. She had a moment of clarity, blinking rapidly at the scene in front of her. 

There was a huge, stinking piece of glass sticking out of her head, but she couldn't move her hands to pull the bastard out. 

Blood spatters painted the wall in front of her, chunks of brain, and a hefty piece of skull. 

The rest of the doctor's body was gone, nothing but a mist of red clinging to the air. 

Conrad was laughing maniacally, bloody hands wrenching from his restraints and planting over his ears, lips moving in words she strangely understood. He didn't try and struggle from the restraints, awkwardly hanging from them, resembling an overturned turtle.

*Keep going, you're almost there*. Cass could sense his pleasure overlapping every word. *Almost there, almost there, almost… There.*

His smile was wide and delirious, and Cass could almost mistake his expression for happiness. 

The twins were alive, though, not in great shape. The man-made witch's screech was raw in Cass's ears, while her failure of a brother's body rattled like the banshee wail was already deep inside him, squeezing his brain into a pulp. I liked the sound of that. Maybe this girl's thoughts were influencing me. But I wanted him dead. His father, Dr Freak-en-stein, was gone. All Cass had to do now was finish it, and send them all to hell. 

I know why she hesitated though. I could feel it deep within my bones. Cass thought herself as nothing but a mound of flesh, devoid of her humanity. She wanted to die. 

But him…

Was it really mercy, and did he really want to die? The vampire was genetically made, which made him still human, still able to feel, and breathe, and think without a bloodlust. And just like the humans she had killed, this odd combination of both, monster and mouth breather, did not have long left until his brains were painting the walls.

But he was still laughing, giggling, his fangs out, baby incisors stained from his latest meal. All indicators that she should just kill him, and get it over with.

Cass wondered if he could read her mind, because despite her wail still carrying in the air and bringing everything around them crashing to the floor, glass shattering, bodies exploding, somehow he knew exactly what she was going to do. She could hear his giggles turning into strained breaths, and then sobs, his fingers creeping down his face. 

"No." His lips formed the word, and then he screamed it, screamed at her, wide, flickering eyes on the ceiling tiles. The vampire refused to look at her, because he knew. Even when the mad scientist's laboratory was collapsing around them, he knew she wouldn't let it bury them.

"Don't you fucking dare," his strangled cry caught her off guard, and she tried to speak, tried to explain herself. But he kept talking, screaming at her, lips curling into a snarl. "I'll never forgive you," he said, when Cass's lungs started to deflate, and her ears popped. 

The invisible force rocking the room finally stopped, and she could finally hear his sobs. "Please. Don't do this. I know you think you're showing mercy, but you're…" He gritted out a snarl.

"You're making it…" The vampire paused, shaking his head, like he couldn't believe she was even considering this. "I-I'm begging you, because if you do this, if you fucking force me to live in this shit, I will never fucking forgive you." He drew in a very human breath, and the way he curled into himself, legs tucked beneath him, his head sandwiched into the floor, Cass's chest swelled, tears filling her eyes. 

Conrad was still sobbing into the floor, mumbling to himself, when I finally let go, bleeding back to reality–where present Cass was three inches from my face, with wide eyes and a furrowed brow. This Cass had color in her cheeks, and the warm smile of a "mother," whose maternal instincts couldn’t help but care for the three fellow supernatural strays. *Are you okay?* Her lips were moving, but I couldn't hear her, the world swimming around me, my thoughts dancing. Cass's screech was still lodged in the back of my throat. My lips suddenly tasted like her blood, and the filth of the laboratory, the dust glued to the air. It wasn't until a box of cereal crashed down in front of me, that I found myself eye to eye with Conrad. Cass, who had let go of my hand with a sharp breath, almost like she felt suffocated of air once again, quietly excused herself. 

"Sup with you?" Conrad broke the silenece, frowning, as I swallowed Cass's scream, her blood coating the back of my throat. "You were having, like, a vision, or something like that, anyway." He pulled a face, dramatizing what I could only guess was a demon possession. "Your eyes rolled back to pearly whites, and I thought you were having a stroke." He gestured to Matt. "Jeez, and here I was thinking you had a delayed reaction to Matt being a member of the Dead Breakfast Club."

I think that was the point I decided that maybe, instead of hiding these visions from Oasis's houseguests, maybe I should start by asking what the fuck was going on with them. 

The laboratory housing all of those experiments, where was it? 

The twins, who had survived Cass's banshee wail, where were they?

And most importantly… I turned my focus to Conrad, who suddenly couldn't look me in the eye.
