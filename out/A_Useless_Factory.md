The cold metal ground hurt my back to lay on. God, I hate back pain. Wait. Why was I sleeping on the ground? In fact, I don’t actually know where I am or how I got here. Have I always been here? I have no memories before this exact moment, yet I felt my developed brain’s instincts. I felt my consciousness. I feel my fear. I felt my loneliness even though the sounds of functioning machinery suggested I was surrounded by people. Do they know how we got here? I stood up to see a small, unimpressive room filled with all kinds of equipment. None of the equipment appeared to have a point, yet several people worked mindlessly with no clear goal. The sound was unbearably loud and unendingly obnoxious. It’s a wonder how I slept at all with the deafening industrial racket. I took in my surroundings the best I could, but the lighting was dull, and there were no windows. It was neither hot nor cold. There were no clocks or ways to track time at all. I found myself at the back of the factory.

“Dude. DUDE.” A woman with grime coating her pale skin head to toe was shifting levers back and forth while dripping sweat. “Start working. He’s watching.” She kept her voice lowered, but she raised a boney finger towards the cameras in the corner of the room. An unconvincing and cartoonish camera swiveled back and forth. I simply looked at the dirty worker, and I continued looking around without acknowledging the warning. I felt her scowl intensify as I walked away from her, but I couldn’t find myself to care. As I wandered through the narrow paths, each person looked at me with different expressions, all of which were in different levels of anguish and frustration. It also seemed to be confusing to everyone I passed to see me not working alongside them. Without breaking the monotony of useless work, they watched me walk past them towards what I deemed to be the “front” of the factory. 

As I approached the wall opposite of the one I woke up near, I noticed a roped off section that divided the room. Beyond the rope, a small group of men sat on the only chairs I’ve seen in the entire building. They looked content, and very relaxed. That was until they saw my confused face. Upon seeing me, expressions twisted into anger.

A fat little man squinted his eyes and turned a deep crimson as he spit, “What the hell are you doing? Don’t you know you’re supposed to be working.”

“No, not really.” I answered honestly. The worker closest to me shot her head up to see who dared to speak back to the clique behind the rope. 

“This fuckin guy.” Another ghostly white man groaned. “He’s lucky we’re not ripping hearts out anymore.”

“Ripping out hearts?” As the question escaped my lips, they chuckled at my ignorance. 

“Yeah, kid. Get back to work.” Another man hissed.

“So you aren’t ripping out hearts now. Why should I work?” I asked. 

“Oh my god, you’re still here?” The fat man wailed in rage. “If you don’t do as we say, the Boss will send you to the basement.” Gasps from behind me suggested this isn’t the first time they’ve threatened people with the supposed horrors of the basement. It, however, did not impress me. 

“Who’s the Boss, and what happens in the basement?” Simply asking the questions seemed to make everyone in the room uncomfortable in different ways. The men behind the rope only got angry. My lack of blind allegiance baffled my peers as much as it did the men. 

“The Boss created all of this. Just like what you see here, there is also an upstairs and a downstairs.” A voice explained just out of sight. The man speaking was so far behind the rope, he was covered in shadows. Everyone shut up to listen to him, so I concluded he was likely the highest authority in the room. “If you don’t work, the Boss will send you to the basement to have your legs broken.”

“Oh wow. What a dick.” I responded.

“No, no! He’s the most loving guy in the entire factory. He made everything you see around you!” The shadowy man corrected me. 

“But you guys were ripping out hearts for him?” I asked. 

“Well yeah, but his son used to work here. He let us rip his heart out after a few years so that we never have to do it again.” He said, completely serious. “We used this knife, and that’s why we all hang a tiny golden knife around all of our necks.” He said, pulling the symbol out of his shirt. 

“Wait. So the Boss required you to rip out hearts, then you worked with his son, and he allowed you to rip his out, and now you don’t do it? Why the hell did you have to rip out hearts to begin with? And you think he’s a cool guy?”

“HE IS LOVE.” A demonic growl shook in his throat.

“And have any of you met this Boss?” I asked. 

“He works upstairs, and you can only meet him once you’re promoted.”

“So you work for someone who you’ve never met? Then how do you know the factory worker was his son when you ripped out his heart?”

“He was really nice. And he told me how awesome his dad was.” The fat man chimed in. 

“But none of you have been promoted, so how do you even know if he’s even up there to begin with?” I kept grilling because nothing made sense to me. The entire factory chose to follow a man they’ve never seen, and this group of men are acting as an authority for nothing more than a hypothesis. I saw the stairs that led up to a closed door, and I saw a set of stairs leading down to a destination unknown. All I saw was it descending into a dark nothingness. 

The shadow man pointed to the stairs, “All people denying his authority go to the basement. No one has ever gone down there to find out how serious the Boss can be.”

“Okay fine. Let's see the basement.” Even louder gasps had the entire factory in shock. The men behind the rope froze. Never before has a person challenged the authenticity of their claims to this extent, for not even they have challenged them. 

Amongst the shock, smirks slowly replaced their faces. A cocky, cheek to cheek grin adorned the shadowy man's face as he approached the rope, yet his eyes remained in darkness. “Right this way.”

Down to the basement I descended out of sight as laughter harmonized with the sound of my feet on each step. There was a complete absence of light, and it was very cold. After what seemed like ages, I made it to the landing. Without light, I had to feel the walls to make my way down the corridor. It was just a few feet in when I reached a dead end. There was nothing. No people. No equipment. Nothing. 

My lungs were burning by the time I made it back up the stairs. As the factory came back in sight, no one seemed to notice I had re-entered until I was midway up the stairs leading to the Boss's office. 

“Wait! No one is allowed to see the Boss!” Shadows no longer hid his face. He was nothing but a petrified child. 

“Then break my legs.” I said, and I twisted the knob and pushed. The door swung open easily, revealing the serene and peaceful nature of the outside world. 

Such awe inspiring beauty and freedom was laying behind the doors the entire time. A world away from a factory that produced nothing led by people exploiting baseless beliefs, and it was so much more impressive than any Boss. It was especially more majestic than a system where the guy who required hearts to be ripped out was threatening to break your legs if you didn't adopt his law. Even with the knowledge they had, and the obvious moral corruption of their Boss, they still choose to waste their time working for him without investigating his validity. 

I stepped out of the pit of useless despair and looked down at the men who should know better and the poor people they led to believe they should never question the Boss. 

“Hey. See? You're all wrong and wasting your time.” I yelled down to them. Silently, they watched me stand above them. And the useless factory continued to roar.
