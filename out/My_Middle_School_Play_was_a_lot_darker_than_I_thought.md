It was nothing much, we just talked about life and dumb things we used to do. Becca brought up a story when we were in middle school. One I wished everyone forgot about, or maybe I would never have to hear again. 

“No, no, no. Remember that play?” Becca started, putting her drink down on the concrete and sitting crisscross in her chair. “And how Lucas busted his ass on the stage.” Becca continues, barely managing to form the sentence without laughing through it. 

Lucas shot up to his defense, “The rope was loose! Besides what about you and Mr. popular? How that go?” 

“How long did you and Jenna last again?” Becca fired back, Lucas just brushed it off though I could see a tint of red on his cheeks.

“Jenna was a ho-“ Lucas muttered but Katherine cut him off.

“Wasn’t her and Jayden partners in the play?” Katherine said, in that so ever soft voice. It felt as if I could be put to sleep, made me forget what they were actually talking about for a second.

“Yeah, she liked him too. I for so ever resent him for that.” Lucas said, shooting glares at Jayden. Though I think Jayden was too drunk out his mind to even really care about the conversation.

“You know what’s funny, he would complain to me about her. He would go ranting on about how she annoyed him.” Katherine said, before Becca could respond she continued. 

“He never even liked her. He rolled his eyes when he saw he’d be paired up with her.”  She chuckled lightly. 

This made Lucas frustration admittedly high with that stupid face he does, making the whole group laugh. I was glad they didn’t bring up more of it. As we were leaving I looked around one last time. “Resent? Big word for you.” Becca said quietly to Lucas, earning a soft jab from him. Katherine picked up her belongings just tidying up the space. Her soft dark brown hair falling off her shoulders, her loose button on her dark magenta cardigan. The way the light shined through her dark brown eyes.

We all and said our goodbye and left from Lucas house. Unfortunately, I got stuck with bringing Jayden back to his house. The drive back was quiet with the exception of music playing faintly from the radio. I knew Jayden for a while, he was always this chill guy even when drunk. Though he was more incoherent and clumsy.

We were almost at his house, it was going smoothly; as I was driving something caught my eye. It was a red rocky path through a forest near the road. Maybe I was seeing things or maybe I too was drunk enough. But that path gave me certain… feelings about that play.

Something tells me to to find my scripts. Maybe just some unfinished business, I’ll try to find it I think my mom has it. I would ask Jayden for his, but he has a bad hangover and I wouldn’t want to bother his girlfriend about it.

Hey. It’s been a while like a month. I got my script from my mom a week ago. I’m just getting Jayden’s. He seemed to understand why I asked him for it. To better understand this I’ll take you back.

It was a cold a night, and I just turned 13. I walked around backstage getting ready quickly. The curtains draw and the play started. For reference I played Carolina and Jayden played a boy named Everett.

———————————————————

Act 1
Scene 1: Ms. Myrtle and her lake
[Enter CAROLINA and EVERETT .]

 CAROLINA
Everett we been walking for sooo long. How far is it?

EVERETT
It’s not that far, oh look! 

[Both look ahead. ]

EVERETT
Down by the willow, Oh down by the willow, there’s a mother by the lake. What could she be looking for? 

CAROLINA
Probably your intelligence.

EVERETT
Very funny Carolina, now come on.

[ . . . Ed: END. . . ]

He grabbed my hand a little too quick, I almost tripped over the floor. I hate how low budget this school was, the floor board was sticking out for god’s sake! I regained my balance and Jayden looked a little guilty for it.

“You okay?” He muttered 

“Yeah, Dingus.” I whispered back. He rolled his eyes. 

(One thing I thought was strange was how teachers were in the play too. I didn’t pay any attention to it then, I wished I did now. For a low budget school it was sorta big.)

We walked up to “Ms. Myrtle” in reality it was just one of the teachers…

[ . . . Ed: START . . . ]

MS. MYRTLE
[Low humming. ]

EVERETT
What exactly are you looking for ma’am?

[MS. MYRTLE smiles gently]
MS. MYRTLE
I seemed to have lost my daughter. We were playing a so nice game of hide and seek. [Clasp Hands Together] Her names Sophie, have you seen her Deary?

(I’m sorry, but that smile was something I couldn’t get over. Her white stained teeth slightly crooked. It was barely noticeable, but I noticed. I noticed everything.)

EVERETT
Well no ma’am. But we can help, our moms said we have to be back before sun set.

CAROLINA
Do you know where we should look at first? 

MS. MYRTLE
Thank you Dearest! Oh yes, you should look just right out back of my house. I hope she didn’t wonder off far.

———————————————————

(Now that was the sheet I was given. A few lines I know. Though I still liked my character, I felt like she was very much like me in a way. I’m now going to put Jayden’s up here… Now for whatever reason he had the original copy, the one without cuts or fixes, and I’m starting to wonder what else happened to my friends.)

———————————————————

Act 1
Scene 2: The long red old path
[Enter CAROLINA and EVERETT, forest setting. ]

CAROLINA
Why you’d have to say yes?
[Mumble]  

EVERETT
Because. . . Didn’t your mom tell you to be nice to people?

CAROLINA
Yeah be nice not caring. I don’t care about this Sophie.
[Throw hands up]

EVERETT
Don’t talk like that. Ms. Myrtle is a nice lady. And my mom did say to respect our elders. 

CAROLINA
Not help them. Like we’re not even getting anything out from this! I would love to just be home with my mom. //Not an old bitch!//> (Put this out when finalized) 

[Distant giggles. ]

EVERETT
Over there, that’s where she is!

[Both walks to brushes. ]

EVERETT
Ms. Sophie? Your mom’s looking for you. 

SOPHIE 
Hm? That’s the point you’re going to get me spotted! [Harsh whisper]

CAROLINA
She’s not playing //dumbass. She lost you now get your ass and go back home hoe// >(Don’t like this part, redo it later)

(Mind you I just stared at this. Why would the Director want me, a 13 year old, to curse in a school play? What I said if I remember correctly, “She’s not playing, She asked us to help look for you. She thinks you’re lost, so get home.” That was the line I was given.)

SOPHIE
This is why I don’t play games with her. She always loses me. 

[EVERETT helps SOPHIE up. ]

SOPHIE
Thanks, you are? 

CAROLINA
He’s Everett

SOPHIE
[Rolls eyes] Come on, my mom always makes cookies when we play.

[Drags EVERETT away. ]

CAROLINA
Wait! What am I supposed to tell your mother?

EVERETT
At an Chuckaboo! I’ll be back before sunset it’s alright! 

[EVERETT and SOPHIE leaves. ]

CAROLINA
Great. Now who’s supposed to walk me down the path? //That fucking bitch.// >(Take out later)

———————————————————

(In hindsight it was a rusty red color carpet that looked like it’s been left in the Arizona sun for too long. Now I found this part dumb. My character just goes on murmuring about whatever. I’m just wondering why my line was the only line changed, unless I’m missing something?)

(When I did finish my part I saw Jayden and the teacher who played Ms. Myrtle. I wonder why her name didn’t display when it showed actors. Yet most of the names were blotched and scratched away I mean this is pretty old paper.

The teacher had her hand on Jayden’s shoulder with that same smile. Jayden shot me looks, like he’s telling me not to come over. Wished I listened.)

“Oh! Sweetie didn’t see you there, you did great. I have some candy in back room.” The teacher said. Jayden was silent, but I could see the slight panic that rose in his eyes. I could already tell his inner thoughts, and while he didn't speak, it was as clear as if he had shouted it. He was begging me, pleading with me.

I thought of two things one say yes to spite him, or two say no and listen to both him and my mom. Which she didn’t like me having candy. 

“No thank you, my mom doesn’t want me to eat all that sugar.” I said finally. Jayden was still creeped out. When the teacher did go away I tried to ask him what happened. He brushed it off saying, “The candies she has sucks ass.” Though I could tell it was more than that. Just had that look in his eyes, I couldn’t get it out. I pushed him more about it he just said to leave him alone so he can ‘get in part’.

I then noticed he didn’t have his jacket for his character. I pointed this out to him. 

“No! It fine.” He squeaked, I could see the anxiety and apprehension on his face again. He was trying to reassure me, but I could see that he was not doing well.

I looked at him worriedly, struck by the change in his demeanor. I had never heard him like this before, this anxiety and nervousness. I saw the strain on his face the uneasiness in his eyes. Something was wrong, and that teacher must of done something.

“I can go get it or look around it’s not that big of a dea-“ He then cut me off.

“No. It’s fine. Everett doesn’t always need to wear that damn jacket. Like is he always cold or something?” He said in a slight tone. He tried to joke about it, actually he tried to joke about a lot of things during this night. Which just felt weird and force. Like why else would we have Lucas for?

That look and his squeak. I haven’t asked. And the more I get closer to uncovering this play. I can get answers. Now I tired to google it or look for it, but it’s no where to be found. Which maybe I’m spelling it wrong or something. I even went to that schools page yet nothing. Like every page. Also it’s not like 

Sorry I’ll pick up when I get Lucas and Becca’s papers. I think I just saw something pass by my window and now my dogs are barking nonstop.
