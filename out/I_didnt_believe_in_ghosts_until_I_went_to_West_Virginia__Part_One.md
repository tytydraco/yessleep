I wake up in the middle of the night often. Always the same way. One full body spasm that leaves me aching, my entire person wet and cold with old sweat. I’ve been to the hospital, dabbled with the psych ward too. I’ve tried therapy and meditation, breathing exercises and whatever new trend some con artist screams at me through my distorted phone speaker. Still, I wake up in the middle of the night. Once I’m up - raw paranoia. Every night after that painful convulsion, I lay awake and feel thousands of eyes on me, unable to return to sleep until the sky starts to brighten.

This nightly curse began a long time ago. As far back as the 90s if you can believe it. But before you go and offer up your armchair expertise on combatting “trauma” and all your new age bullshit, let me tell you all that I know about where my “trauma” came from. 

I’m not a crazy person. I’m not interested in your internet points. I want to tell you my story and then you can leave me the fuck alone. Of all the things I’ve tried, I’ve never really tried just sharing the truth. So this is for me and me alone, but I suppose it’s important to tell this to someone else. I think that’s sort of the point. So here you go.



I worked in construction for a long time - many years. All those years and I never climbed the ranks. I never got promoted to project manager or a supervisor or even a damn foreman. I just dug the trench or hauled material or directed traffic. No one ever saw anything in me I guess. That’s alright, I never gave them much to see. I was a cynical bastard, still am to some degree as I’m sure you can tell. Back then though, there was a glisten of hope for me and it came in the form of a woman. She was my first love and maybe my only love since. She was the real deal, you know the kind. Dawn was her name.

The short and sweet version - Dawn and me met at the worst house party I’d ever attended. A buddy of a pal of a friend had this cool house with a cool pool, but this buddy exclusively played either Poison or Milli Vanilli, a disgusting clash of the era's worst music. He was obnoxious and I was about to leave when I saw a girl belly flop into the pool so hard it could’ve loosened a filling. That was Dawn and I had to meet her. We hit it off good enough to share a roof only five months later, but there was no worry with her. It didn’t feel rushed at all.

My job had us moving around, usually hopping from trailer park to trailer park. She didn’t mind though and I greatly appreciated that. I told her she was my guardian angel. I was an idiot at the time - too young and dumb to truly grasp someone so loving like her. I was busy watching football and working on my beer chugging skills. We had a nice life, though. We were young and carefree.

Somewhere in that daze of neon lights and summer sweat, I got an offer for a job. It was the same company I had been working for but it paid a good deal more and that was because we’d be working in an unordinary region. The project was expected to take two years and it was basically a makeover for some desolate country roads. It was for a little town, if one could call it that, in West Virginia.

Me and Dawn were more city slickers, I was mainly working in Atlanta, Chattanooga, Charlotte, or even Jacksonville - but we figured the extra pay and some fresh air would do us good. We packed our bags.

I was no stranger to back roads but the West Virginian switchbacks that serpentined you through Appalachia were nausea inducing. It felt like driving on the back of a massive ancient snake which slithered deeper and deeper into the old world. We separated from all modern highways at least a hundred miles back and then the rest of the way only got more remote. Painted roads turned to bare concrete passages which contorted into bumpy gravel trails. My truck wasn’t four wheel drive and I felt a little sick knowing if any weather came we’d be effectively trapped within multiple horizons of dark mountains where no human light ventured.

Finally, we rode along a mountain ridge where we could see a few roofs down in a valley. That was our destination. How the hell my company scored or even caught wind of the bid which brought us there was beyond me.

I remember we passed an abandoned gas station at some point with a rusty old sign. *22 cents per gallon* it read, the numbers struggled to fight through years of corrosion. More trees still. I thought soon after the station that the town would follow but it was another few dozen bends before we hit more structures.

I suppose it was a quaint little place. It was simpler. The town square was brief. A few  unlabeled and unbranded buildings built with logs primarily. The tiny police station was more modern looking, tan brick with a dusty narrow stile door. Most of the townsfolk seemed to traverse by bicycle or foot, but when there was a vehicle it was a 70s or 80s midsized truck blasted by generations of mud.

Dawn liked the place. I was used to more options, myself. The only store which the locals referred to as “the mart” was not even labeled so and had to be ascertained by spotting a building with an ice chest out front and a hint of aisles through hazy windows.

Everyone in the town was either adolescent or elderly by my perception. The sheriff seemed to be fairly middle aged but beyond that was an ocean of lost years in the town’s empty dirt roads.

“I think it’s charming,” Dawn would say while I dodged potholes large enough to earn us a permanent address in the place.

We found ourselves shacked up way out of town. Some twisting road with no name which led to a hollow that had remained a secret to the sun all this time. It was some kind of failed attempt at a campground with multiple lodges. Yet another winding trail which took us by several old and wilted cabins until we met our match at the end of the plot.

When we opened the door to our cabin, we alerted several unseen crawling things which scuttled off. Everything was ancient inside. It felt like stepping back centuries. The bed could’ve last been used by a union soldier. In places, there were strips of daylight leaking in through the wooden slats. I soon came to realize there was no cable and no phone and no radio, but not just in this disintegrating cabin - in the whole region.

We were going to be working within a giant area that was referred to as a “quiet zone”. I didn’t care for this quiet zone or the side effects of being within its parameters.

“A lot of it goes above my head,” the sheriff said while digging his finished cigarette into the roadside muck. “Basically a bunch of astronomers have constructed these giant satellite dishes and they use them to listen to deep space.”

Me and my buddy Clark stared back at the sheriff with shovels in our hands. We had been on the job just a few days by that point as we began work on Farm Road 128 or 132 - I can’t remember the damn numbers. 

“So that’s why I can’t watch the Braves game?” Clark asked, spitting dip into the dirt beneath.

“That’s why you can’t watch the Braves game,” the sheriff nodded.

“Man to man,” I said as I leaned in, “you gotta secret TV anywhere?”

“Man to man?” the sheriff played along and whispered, “I’ve got a Mitsubishi 80 incher in the jail’s basement.”

Me and Clark shared a quick glance, unsure of the sheriff’s sincerity. 

“I got Michelle Pfeiffer down there too in some fishnets,” the sheriff laughed as he knocked both of us on the shoulder. “In all seriousness, there’s uh - no. There’s no way we can have any of that here. They got some cutting edge gadgets too that can triangulate exactly where any radio signals are coming from.”

“Why the hell do you stick around?” Clark asked.

“Well, I don’t know. It’s all I’ve ever known, really. It’s peaceful here and it’s simple. Can’t get much better than that.”

I personally wouldn’t have taken the job had I known we’d be without any modern technology beyond the cars we drove there in. Even the car’s radio had to be off at all times. Everyone that lived there seemed at peace with the whole thing though, and I guess I can understand the simpler lifestyles and all that but, I don’t know. I guess I had become accustomed to the spoils of the modern age.

Beyond the lack of technology, I was also bothered by the decrepit state of everything. This place to me was clearly somewhere that should’ve been left behind. There was no good reason to have a town out in those dark mountains. There was no established mine in the town, absolutely no opportunity, and not even the nearby astronomers settled in the place. It was like the little holler was just an island in nowhere, existing for no reason. It reminds me of those uncontacted tribes, but these were regular-degular-god-fearing christians with plenty of knowledge of the outside world and roads to get out should they choose to. But they didn’t. And for some reason, we were making those roads bigger and better for the few who lived there.

Our construction crew would work ten hour days in the blistering heat. It was tropically humid with the sun being unbearable but the shade being worse due to clouds of mosquitoes. The terrain was unwelcoming and stubborn to allow human designs on it. Our tools warped and snapped from the cruel rock. It was hell.

Night time was worse, but being with Dawn made it palatable. She was enjoying her time in our rustic cottage. She became a voracious reader and would tell me everything she experienced during the day while I was gone and, sadly, I would tune her out for the most part. My brain would feel so dried out it couldn’t even absorb a single word and my body would be broken and aching, throbbing from battling machinery and the elements. Her beautiful voice was just noise, but it was the greatest noise and I looked forward to hearing it after each abysmal day. 

Then there was bedtime - the actual worst part. Aching, throbbing, auditory hallucinations. I’d hear the relentless firing of a jackhammer or the moaning of hydraulics and, if I did dream, it would be endless looping of the jobsite. A sun-blasted roadside. Scorching hot. Helping my crew lower something deep into the earth or building a road in some alien way with alien tools.

Then I would wake up and feel crawling all over me. Those hideous bugs. The cabin we were in offered no protection from them. Spiders crawling into my ears, juicy cockroaches up my shirt, centipedes skittering across my feet. Then there were flies buzzing and the high pitched frequencies of mosquitoes coming in for a feeding. It was absolute misery and I’d always become aware of them in the night. Never in the morning. Always deep in the night, with several hours to go before sunup. Dawn would somehow sleep through the onslaught and never suffer a bite from the mosquitoes. They must’ve favored my blood.

My trips to the mart every morning before work were my best moments in the town. If Dawn woke up with me, I’d be able to actually converse with her and maybe share a laugh or two. If I was alone, I could enjoy the solitude enough. My aches would be reduced to a subtler hum in the morning time. 

The mart offered little. Provisions and necessities, no peaches or mosquito netting sadly. A gaunt old lady had a small stand within the mart and she made biscuits and sold jam. That was breakfast every morning and the two together were absolutely toothsome. That was about it for my “social” life in the town. The old lady and the high school kid running the register. 

The sheriff would always pester us on the jobsite, too. He’d just sit there and chat, saying he was doing “traffic control.” Traffic for the ghosts? Even then, he’d be doing a dreadful job of it.

“What all is on that TV, anyway?” The sheriff asked.

“Just about anything you can think of,” I replied.

“Plus you can get a VCR and record stuff to tape,” Clark added. 

The sheriff struggled to understand.

“It means you can watch Michelle Pfeiffer on repeat if you so choose,” I chimed in.

“Oh! Now we’re talkin’,” the sheriff said.

“In motion, baby,” Clark said while thrusting his hips.

The sheriff chuckled at that more than we were planning on. He calmed down eventually.

“Ah, well. It’s pretty much a bunch of garbage, though. The commercials are getting longer and longer these days,” I said.

The sheriff paused and looked up at the mountains beyond, muttering, “‘do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for.’” He looked down and I saw genuine sadness on his face.

Me and Clark shared another glance. A common occurrence when talking with the sheriff.

“It’s just an old quote I like,” the sheriff said like an embarrassed child. 

It was interesting to see the culture shift in that place. A place where most people were well read due to circumstance and could rattle off quotes from Greek philosophers all while not feeling embarrassed to do so. The sheriff probably thought us modern folk thought lower of him - maybe some did. I hated that place, but I can acknowledge the people were leaps and bounds wiser than me. At that time, all I could rattle off was what happened on the latest Jerry Springer episode.



It was late. A symphony of jackhammers. I couldn’t tell if I had gotten sleep or if I’d just been tossing about while vivid projections of the jobsite filled the blank canvas within my eyelids. I rolled over and my bare arm landed on something with a hard exoskeleton and many legs which pricked into my skin. I jumped up and my blurred vision tracked some huge and vague bug slip off the bed. The full body chills woke me up and I stumbled out into the cabin’s den. I sat in a loud leather chair, sipping on a beer and staring out of a dark window. I could hear Dawn’s occasional snores reverberating through the lodge and I envied her more than she would ever know. 

The sound of crickets and cicadas was all encompassing, and it wasn’t muffled either. Plenty were inside and chirping all the same. I just zoned out, my mind drifting into places it shouldn’t. I wanted to get out of that place. Maybe try and get reassigned or just up and leave - find a new company to work for. 

That’s when the bugs stopped.

The silence was threatening. The neverending chorus of insects was a constant in that place, and now they had all agreed to stop. Why?

Something was outside. Something was out there and it was moving slowly, methodically. There was zero moonlight to aid my useless vision in the unbelievable dark. I became conscious of any and all noises I may have been producing, including breathing. I stopped it all entirely for a moment. I heard the crinkling of leaves under foot of something unknown out there. It was getting very close. Way too close. As it approached the cabin, the footsteps sounded very human to me. Then they stopped. I slouched in my chair as if to become one with it. I couldn’t see anything but the faintest little figments of shadows that even still may have been my eyes filling in the blank. 

There was no way to be sure, but I was quickly convincing myself whatever it was out there had stopped to look inside the cabin. 

*There’s no way it can see me in here, right?*

It was so dark. So helplessly dark and remote out there. But I saw something. I swear I saw something at one point. On the window across the room from where I sat, some dim pulsating splotch of a brighter, gray color. Some kind of moisture. It was condensation from whatever was out there breathing right on the window. I’m not sure if it could see me, but its nose or mouth was nearly pressed against the glass as it peered in. And it stayed there for a while. It feels like a piece of me is still there now, trapped with it. 

I was frozen with fear. I had always thought that if anything challenged me and Dawn that I would stand up to it, but there I was, sat there scared shitless at something I couldn’t even see. And so it stood there and it took its time. It must’ve been fifteen or twenty minutes before I no longer saw the condensation pulsing on the glass. I heard the light footsteps again and it slowly disappeared into the thick syrup of night.

The crickets and the cicadas and even an owl somewhere out there resumed their singing.

Day broke at some point. I was still sitting in the leather chair. I had hardly moved all night. I was trapped in my thoughts, trying to repeatedly tell myself either nothing happened or it wasn’t an odd occurrence.

Outside, I looked all over the forest floor for any signs of tracks. Now I’m no hunter - I’m really not even much of an outdoorsy type to begin with. There could’ve been a set of tracks clear as day to someone with the proper eye - but not to me. I tried to manipulate my eyes into seeing deer tracks or bear tracks or something normal like that, but I wasn’t successful. I didn’t even know what to look for. I thought maybe some leaves looked a little pressed down here and there, but I couldn’t be sure. 

I inspected the outside of the window where I had seen the thing breathing. Nothing to hint at my amateur eyes as to what was standing there, but there was a foul smell of urine.

Whatever it might’ve been, it had a clear and unobstructed view of me sitting in that chair the night prior. My hair still stands up thinking about it looking right at me for so long.

It’s getting dark out now and I’ve been at this much longer than anticipated. I feel crazy and deranged. I’m admittedly starting to experience some of my many tremors and spasms perhaps from writing all this and remembering it. 

Soon, I’ll go to bed. Then the full body jolt will rouse me back into my paranoid state. Once it’s all subsided and the sun is out, I’ll keep writing my story.
