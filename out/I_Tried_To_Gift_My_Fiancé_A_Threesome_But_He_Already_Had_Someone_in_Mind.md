This all started a few months ago, I was going through a pretty big shift in my career. I’ve worked in the music industry for the better part of a decade. I happened to be the youngest female executive they’ve ever had at my label.   
  
Recently, I was presented with an opportunity to move to an up-and-coming label. They needed someone to help steer the ship and grow it, and I’d established a pretty good reputation at that point regarding my work. I was invited to a nice personal dinner at a really fancy restaurant. It was the label founder and a former colleague of mine who had kind of arranged the whole meet. They’d told me I was their first choice to take over and I’d be lying if I said I didn't get swept up by the whole thing.   
  
The biggest issue was always going to be the pay cut. They couldn’t afford to hire me at what I was making, at least not for the first few years. I’ll admit it was pretty selfish of me to make that decision without discussing it with my fiancé, which for the sake of this story let’s call Mark.   
  
Mark’s birthday was coming up and I thought that I could surprise him with a gift I knew that he had been looking forward to for some time. This way, when I had to give him the details he’d be a little more receptive to the whole thing. In hindsight this was probably not the best way to go about delivering this kind of news.  
  
 I sat him down after a nice dinner at our place and I told him that for his birthday we could finally have a threesome. When I tell you that he was over the moon happy, I mean he practically sprung up out of his chair. He wanted to know all the details and we talked for about an hour or so about what my conditions were. I always knew there were going to be some expectations when it came to this.  
  
 I’m a lot more sexually experienced than Mark. It’s never been an issue, he’s never judged me about it. But ever since I told him about the threesomes I’ve been in, I knew that somewhere in his mind he thought it’d only be a matter of time. What I didn't expect was that he already had someone in mind. I tried to put on a good face about it. I just think something about that really bothered me. Her name was Eve, she was a temp working at his company. He had mentioned her in passing before. They had gotten real close at work, spent their lunches talking through a lot of her relationships woes and what not.   
  
So, Mark and I grew up in foster homes. I think there's something about that kind of common ground that helped us early on in our relationship. I don’t want to speak for Mark, but I think there’s a very unique pain that comes from being put into the system. Even more so if you feel like your parents may have resigned. We both struggled pretty heavily as a result.  
  
 So when he found out that Eve also had a similar background he took a liking to her pretty quickly. I always thought it was a kind of mentorship between the two of them. That Mark helped guide her through a lot of the things we had to sort out on our own. She was a bit younger than us and didn’t really have much of a support system. She’d only recently moved to the city. At the time it seemed harmless.  
  
So when he brought her up and started showing me pictures of her, I had a hard time staying composed. Mostly because it felt a little one-sided. I had a list worked up in my mind of some friends I’ve known for quite some time, that wouldn’t blush if I approached them about this. Especially since most of them were around when I was going through my partying phase. Some have even been in a threesome with me. I think the issue is that all of the people I had on my list were people we both knew. I was apprehensive about the whole thing and I think he could tell so we decided we would table the whole discussion.  
  
A few days later Mark scooched up beside me while I was reading something and he had outlined an entire proposal for me. He said that he felt strongly that Eve was the one for this and he said that before we make any definitive decisions we should all get together. We’d invite Eve along with some of our friends out for drinks. He thought that if we met, all of my worries would kind of melt away. I didn’t want to tell him that I wouldn’t change my mind about it, but I agreed that I would at least meet her. I still felt very strongly that we were crossing some kind of line.  
  
So the coming friday we had all decided to hit up a new bar that had opened up a few months ago. She was there and I’d be lying if I said she wasn’t beautiful. She had very short hair, and she was tiny but so pretty. At first she was really shy. As we all kind of got to know each other, it just felt really natural. I’m pretty sure drinking helped a lot in that department. It was a great night with a lot of laughs and she even got to hear about some of my partying days from friends who talk way too much when inebriated.   
  
In the cab home Mark kept nudging me for my take on her. He was all smiles and I could tell he knew I liked her. He was practically gloating. We went out a few more times and I feel as though I really got to understand her as a person and her relationship with Mark. They never flirted with each other, They bantered a bit here and there but it never felt closed off in the way things like that do. Where they have all these inside jokes and you’re on the outs. I think I understood now that it was less like a mentorship and it felt more like Mark saw Eve as a confidant. I guess I never really appreciated how much he needed one that wasn’t me.  
  
I know this has been incredibly long-winded so I apologize, cause you’re probably thinking, well great, problem solved. I thought so too. I was so confident that Mark and I sat down, we talked about it and this time I agreed. Eve could be our third. We decided we’d host a dinner between the three of us at our house and after dessert, with maybe a bit of wine, we’d ask her.  
  
I cooked a nice steak dinner, we had some wine and the whole night just fit together perfectly. During the dinner Mark was fine. By dessert he started looking a little loopy. Mark has to travel a lot. There’s an office out of state he flies to at least once a month to check in on. Unfortunately, he has a bit of anxiety about landings. I don’t understand it much either but for him it's about the most stressful thing. These things can kind of be second nature to him, so he probably took a valium and let the anxiety roll off of him. He would have been fine had he avoided the wine. So as I’m bringing a new bottle into the living room I see Mark sleeping on the couch holding his empty glass. I took it from his hand and I tried moving him into the bedroom but he's a big man. It didn’t feel like it was something I was going to accomplish at that moment. Eve and I had a laugh about it.  
  
“He’s probably exhausted from his trip,” she says as she moves next to me.   
  
“It’s been so great getting to know you in person.”  
  
“Cause of Mark?”  
  
“Yeah, and also I’ve been following your life for some time. Youngest female executive at your label. You have so many impressive accomplishments. Especially coming from where we started, you are so inspiring.”  
  
“Thank you so much.” I felt the energy shift in the room. Eve leaned in closer to me.   
  
“I don’t know if Mark ever mentioned it to you, but my mom was sick growing up. I think some doctor’s thought that it might have been early onset dementia. It was small things at first, that she had to kind of snap herself out of. She had started to develop these delusions about me. That I was an imposter, that I took her daughter away from her. She really started to hate me towards the end. I didn’t think I had any other choice but to run away.”  
  
“I’m so sorry.”  
  
“I think that's kind of the struggle we go through isn’t it? We never really feel like we belong. Like we’re imposters in our own life. Which is why it’s been so amazing to see what you’ve done for yourself. It must be a lot of pressure, to live up to all these expectations. Successful businesswoman, great partner, amazing friend. Doesn’t it ever get tiring?”  
  
“It’s not so bad.” I chuckled nervously.  
  
Her voice got softer. “Of course, you have to succeed. Otherwise, what was it all for? Right? I’ve thought about leaving Eve behind, becoming someone new. Have you ever had that feeling?”  
  
“I’ve definitely wanted to disappear before.”  
  
“What if you could?”   
  
“Disappear?”  
  
“Yeah. With the guarantee that someone will take over for you. A whole new you running your life in your absence. Your friendships secure, your relationships thriving.”  
  
“Haha, Hypothetically right?” I laughed a bit through the strange atmosphere in the room.   
  
“No, what if I told you I could do that for you.”  
  
“How? Why?”  
  
“How isn’t important. I just want what you have. I want your life, your career. I could be the best you. The version of you, you’ve only dreamed of.”  
  
“You’re starting to freak me out, Eve.”  
  
“Think about it, I’ll only make this offer once.” She downed the rest of her wine and left.  
  
I really didn’t understand what that conversation had turned into.  
  
The following week was kind of quiet. I think I really suppressed a lot of that conversation after. Considering how insane it was, I tried writing it off like Eve maybe had a bit too much to drink. I’ve rambled before when I was drunk, like I was the queen of something, giving orders. She just let her imagination run wild during a peak and for her it almost seemed real.  
  
Mark approached me about a week later. He seemed pretty upset. He was convinced I had said something inappropriate to Eve that night after he’d fallen asleep. I tried to kind of shrug it off, but he was persistent. He was convinced I had made her uncomfortable somehow. I started to get irritated at this point, because if anyone made anything weird, it was Eve. So I told him what she said to me. He laughed. It was almost like he was laughing at me.  
  
“Do you hear yourself? Do you even hear how you sound right now?”  
  
I let myself get swept up in my anger and I felt like it was unfair. He was basically taunting me for something I didn’t do.  
  
“I’m telling you the truth.”  
  
“So you’re convinced she wants to be you? I knew that a threesome would be too weird for you. I’m sorry okay, I’m sorry I suggested Eve. She doesn’t want to replace you, okay? This is fucked up. You need to apologize, especially since she told you about what happened with her mom. Jesus, I can't believe you did this.”  
  
I felt like I walked into a trap. Maybe I should have kept it to myself. Avoiding it would have been worse, made me look like I was hiding something. Looking back on it now, I feel so stupid.  
  
Mark said he needed some space. That he didn’t recognize this side of me. One that would play mind games with people and at that point there was no convincing him of anything else.  
  
Someone had mentioned something to my boss about me taking meetings with other labels. They couldn’t fire me outright for it, but over the course of the next few weeks they made my work life miserable. Constant second guessing of choices and unnecessary micromanagement. I was under scrutiny for every professional decision I was making. They were practically forcing me out. I hadn’t heard back from my former colleague about the job offer. The calls I did make went unanswered. I was screwed.  
  
I started working later and later trying to gain some goodwill with my bosses and ended up leaving closer to midnight some nights. The carpark at my job barely had any of the lights on by the time I was leaving. I heard rustling one night as I scrambled through my purse for my keys. I felt something push me up against my car. There was a struggle for my purse. I tried pulling as hard as I could, but their strength was overwhelming. They snatched my purse and the force of it all knocked me to the ground. I could only make out a bit of the figure, they were clearly wearing a hoodie of some kind. I did hear their whisper to me as they finally secured a hold of my purse.   
  
In a low gruff voice they said, “Your life’s not going so great, is it?”  
  
They then vanished into the dark interior of the parking garage.  
  
I called the police, once I managed to stop crying. The officers instructed me to call AAA for assistance with my car. They were pretty honest about the likelihood of them catching whoever did this. They did ask, considering how enclosed the car park was to outsiders, if maybe I felt like I may have been targeted. I shouldn’t have said anything, but in the state of panic I let slip how Eve’s behavior bordered on stalking. I even mentioned what the thief said as they made off with my purse.  
  
I had to wait about a week before a new set of keys were sent to me via mail. So in the meantime I had to start taking the bus to work. My normally very friendly neighbor refused to make any sort of eye contact with me. They barely even acknowledged me as I left the house. Instead he pretended to trim his hedges as I walked down my driveway and down the block toward the bus. He wasn’t the only one. The few stray glances I caught all had this emptiness to them. I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, cause for a second their eyes looked black. Weirder still is how I felt their eyes follow me as I walked past them.  
  
The bus ride was very much the same. Menacing faces, avoiding glances. I could feel a sweat build up around my chest. As I went to exit the bus, an older man spit in the path in front of me. His eyes like black as night and he sneered at me, with his lifeless eyes. I blinked and a rather harmless old man replaced him.  
  
I had a hard time replacing my cell phone. The phone company kept putting blocks on my replacement phone orders. When I finally reached someone three hours into a game of phone tag, a representative finally told me what was going on. Apparently due to some suspicious activity on my account, they believe my sim card may have been cloned, or there may be two different phones attached to my number.  
  
They’d have to close my account, open a new one and then assign me a new number. Great.  
  
My house phone had a string of angry voicemails from Mark. Apparently they had come to see Eve at their work regarding the incident at my job. She stopped showing up to work after that. The way Mark sounded as he yelled into my voicemail told me that there was little room for reconciliation. He said he’d come by some time that week to pick up his stuff. He said he had lost faith in my judgment and my obsession with Eve had gone too far. Most of what he said was vile. I stopped recognizing him too.  
  
Sometimes during the day, I’d get random strangers knocking on my door. I’d look through the peephole and I’d see them standing there aimlessly. Sometimes men, sometimes women. Something about it all just terrified me. I’d even see some of them try looking through my window to see if I was home. I’d hide in the closet or out of view. I didn’t know who I could trust.  
  
I’d started receiving strange packages at my door. Little boxes. I’d received about ten of them in three weeks. I didn’t have it in me to open them. After the first week the house had developed an awful stench. Like something was dying. By the third week I had no choice but to verify what was inside. I pierced the tape with my knife and inside was a smaller styrofoam container. I gagged from the stench and the sight. It was a decaying corpse of a rat. I opened all of them and each box was a rat decaying at different speeds.  
  
I decided to use some vacation days. I had about a month's worth saved up, but I only needed a week or two to get myself in order. I stopped sleeping properly by this point. The slightest sound from outside startled me. I’d have the strangest and most vivid dreams during these naps. One in particular still terrifies me to think of. I was placed on my kitchen table, my wrists and ankles bound by twine. Wrapped around the kitchen table legs. There were about six or seven masked figures. Tribal looking masks. One of the figures held a book that looked almost like it was wrapped in flesh. They pulled in a pig from outside and set it in the kitchen. The pig squealed as they started performing some kind of chant, in a language I didn't recognize. The largest of the group, who tended to the pig, grabbed a kitchen knife and swiped it across the animal's throat. They each took what looked like a paint brush and dipped into the pig's gaping wound. They soaked it in blood and then sprayed its blood on my seemingly naked body.  
  
My chest started to burn. I’m not sure what propelled me to turn my head, but I might have choked on my own puke if I hadn’t. I felt pain in my arms and legs when I woke up. When I went to confirm, I saw that my wrists had bruises. There was also this tender layer, it was almost like burns.  
  
A week or two had gone by, Mark had come by to collect his things. We didn’t speak much to each other. He made some passing comment about my appearance, I didn’t care much of his opinion at that point. I tried reaching out to some friends, to let them know I had a new number. I didn’t receive a response. I tried calling, but most went straight to voicemail after the second attempt. Had they blocked me?  
  
I put my kettle on the stove to make some tea before I went through my social media pages. I thought maybe if I reached out through there, I might hear back. I have to admit I barely go on my Instagram or Facebook. What I noticed when I went on was strange. I didn’t really care about the number of friends I had or followers on those sites, but most of mine were gone. These were friends, acquaintances, old coworkers and colleagues. I had maybe twenty or thirty left. The messages I did send got left on read. I started to stress out, why was everyone I cared about isolating me? My closest friend, Kara, didn't even bother to look at my messages. Days went by where I just kept refreshing the messenger hoping for a change. I finally went through her profile. I saw these pictures of me and her at this barbeque, except it was dated a few days ago. I was never there. I don’t remember any of this happening. Was this an old photo she was posting? There was someone tagged. I pressed it. It was me, a profile, a completely new one for me. It was littered with new photos. Photos with my friends on trips, dinners and outings that I had never been to. A new one posted as I started lurking. It was a photo of this person, captioning a photo of them with their coffee outside some kind of market.  
  
I felt my insides scream with the sound of the kettle going off.  
  
My boss had called me into a meeting. He wanted to discuss the amount of absences I’ve had lately. Not that I did anything shady, but he clearly got off on knowing I worked without ever using my vacation time. Like I had robbed him of some joy. I never really knew how annoying his voice was before this. I started having these violent thoughts. I imagined slamming his teeth on to the corner of his desk and then shoving him out the window. Something about imagining the crunch of his body hitting the pavement made me feel weak in the best way.  
  
I finally got a response from Kara. She said I needed to stop messaging my friends. That I had told her that this account has been hacked by a stalker trying to take my identity. That I needed to let the person posing as me alone. That I had taken it too far when I stole my own phone. Kara didn't bother to let me answer. She blocked me.  
  
I was furious, I knew somehow this had to be her. This had to be Eve. I messaged the fake account. She read it, then started typing. Then they stopped typing. There was about a five minute pause. They started typing again.  
  
“I tried to give you a way out.”  
  
She added me as a friend, but muted me. I couldn’t write or message, but I got access to her entire feed. She wanted me to see it. To see her enjoying my life without me.  
  
I slept even less at this point. I found myself in some pretty sketchy corners of the internet. Looking up strange phenomena, supernatural beings, anything that could explain what the fuck was going on with me, with everyone around me.  
  
I came across some videos of a self described shaman. He specialized in old curses and cryptids. He described something pretty similar to what I was dealing with. I called him up and I begged him to make a house visit. I did my best to describe the severity of the situation I was in and he got quiet for a moment and finally responded that he understood. He’d be there in about 3 days. That I should prepare myself for the worst.  
  
He kept his word. In about three days he showed up at my front door. He had a large duffel bag and about four other men with him. We all sat around my kitchen table and he asked me questions about the amount of contact I’ve had with this creature. He asked if it had been in my home. Could it have had access to my hair, to my nails or teeth without me knowing. I said, it was plausible.  
  
He said that the process this creature goes through is like a ritual and that there are stages to it. That I’m in the final stages now. If I had realized sooner what was happening that I might have more choices at my disposal.   
  
“I’m sorry.”  
  
I didn’t need him to be sorry. I needed him to help me fix this. She ruined my life, she ruined everything I had that was good about being me. She took it all. I begged him. I crawled up to his legs and I begged. He lifted me up and his associate sat me back down on the chair. He said there was a way, but that the cost of it might be too high. I told him that I didn’t care, I’d do anything at this point. He reached back into his bag and he pulled what looked like a dagger fashioned out of a large tusk. He said it was a walruses. There were engraving and runes along the sides of the blade. He handed me the dagger and he said that I needed to do it where there would be the most witnesses.  
  
“But first, we must prepare the ritual so the blade may complete its function.”  
  
 A large drum was brought in from outside. One of them banged in a rhythmic sound as the rest danced around me and the table. When it was over, the shaman apologized once more before he left.  
  
She posted an invite to some party she was having at her place. All of my friends RSVP’d. She even put up her address on the post. It was like she was taunting me, like she didn’t think I would have it in me to show up. This was the perfect place, there'd be plenty of witnesses to see what she is.  
  
My plan was to rush over there after work. I had the dagger stashed in my purse. I was ready. My boss caught me as I was about to make my exit. He asked me if I could join him for dinner, he had a reservation at a nice place in about thirty minutes. I tried to get myself out of it, but it didn’t seem like it was a suggestion. It seemed like my job depended on it  
  
He asked me to drive us there in his car. He sat in the back seat like I was his chauffeur. We spent most of the dinner eating in silence. He was a loud chewer; it really started to grate on me. He took his sweet time stuffing the meat into his mouth. Mouthful after mouthful, he barely took the time to wipe his fucking mess. He smiled as he finally wiped his face. We got back in the car, and he returned to the back seat. The drive was mostly silent again, but I felt a stillness in me. An energy building in still waters. We came to a red light.  
  
“I don’t know how long you were hoping to keep it from us, but we’ve known for some time.”  
   
I kept my eyes peeled on the road.  
  
“I’m not sure how you’re doing it, or even how you found the time. We know you’ve been working at both labels for months now. Did you think we would never find this out?’  
  
The wait for green felt like hours.  
  
“Consider this your chance to make amends. I won’t be bringing this up again. You know if you spent less time playing games you might have been made a senior executive this year. You’ve been such a disappointment.”  
  
Then it broke. The stillness gave way to turmoil in the sea. I felt my foot act on its own. I only heard the blaring sound approach before it all went black.  
  
When I came to I looked back and noticed that the back half of the car had been mostly crushed. I could only see chunks of flesh and blood. I could feel my shoulder had been knocked out of its socket and my searing headache. I was cut up all over. At least that's what I think I saw from what was left of the car mirror. I managed to squeeze my way out of the driver seat and out of the car. There was a whole group circling around the scene. No cops had arrived yet. I got lucky. I left as fast as I could.   
  
I limped my way towards Eve’s.  
  
She lived in a beautiful and stately townhouse, because of course she did. The door was open, I could hear the music before I’d even approached the house. The crowd split down the middle, letting me pass by without conflict. I could hear the gasps and shocked reactions.  
  
“-is that you?”  
  
“What happened to you?”  
  
I ignore their pestering questions. I need them all to see me. I need her to see me too. The path clears enough for me to see the kitchen, and then the living room. Must have been at least 60 people in this house. I recognize maybe half. Clearly, Eve-Me, is the more popular me. I finally see her, she’s holding some kind of dish, she places it down on the counter and she smiles. It’s me. I’d never thought about cutting my hair in that way. I’d never considered dying my hair either, I guess I wasn’t nearly as creative as I thought. She smiled and then she opened her arms like she was welcoming me with a hug. I couldn’t help but want to feel her skin on my face. To smell what perfume she had used, what scent her shampoo carried. Then she whispered softly in my ears.  
  
“Welcome home.”  
  
The crowd began to scream as we both dropped to the floor. She never stopped smiling even as I pulled the dagger from her stomach and began sticking it into her chest. Then her neck and arms and face. I wanted to strip her of her smile, but it was almost painted on. Then I looked as the shape of it shifted and the eyes went black and the creature behind the skin shifted. The blade absorbed it, the shadow creature behind the puppet. I stood up and the screams kept coming. Rapid footsteps and desperate phone calls, all of it drowned out by the sound of rhythmic drumming. I felt like I was still in my kitchen. I went into the bathroom and leaned my face into the sink to wash all of the blood off of me. When I went to see what I had cleaned of her blood, I saw in the reflection that I was [Eve](https://www.instagram.com/bearsythebear/).
