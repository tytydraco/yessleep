I've got an old buddy who I've known since the 4th grade. For the sake of anonymity, I'll call him Doug. He and I were once best friends. We hung out every weekend, playing video games late into the night and snacking on junk food. Whenever there was a party or social event in our town, Doug and I would always go together, getting ourselves into trouble and sticking up for each other against bullies or assholes.

Sadly, as is the case with many childhood friends, Doug and I would eventually go along separate paths in life. He joined the army and went off to Iraq while I remained in our quiet hometown, pursuing a more peaceful life. He would still reach out to me every so often, updating me about his life and how things were going for him in the military. For a time, things seemed to be going well for him. He got promoted to Sergeant, told me about his plan to save the money he earned on deployment to buy a house and seemed overall confident with his future plans. Then one day, I stopped hearing from Doug.

I tried to reach out and get in contact with him, but the only thing I could find out was that he received an honorable discharge after being wounded in combat. Nobody in our town heard from Doug or knew where he went. Not even his mother, the one person who Doug seemed to care about the most in his life. That poor woman was completely destroyed at the sudden disappearance of her son.

Despite being registered as a missing person, years would pass before anyone would hear from my old childhood friend. It was around late Autumn when Doug returned. Turns out that he decided to travel across the country as a drifter since his career in the army didn't pan out. He called the whole thing a "soul searching" journey and had endless stories to tell about his travels and military service to those who listened.

A couple of days ago, Doug and I spent some quality time together for the first time in over a decade. He told me all of his stories and I listened with intrigue. We were drinking a bit, not to get drunk but just ease the mood. Towards the end of the night, Doug's expression hardened, and he asked me if I could trust him.

"Of course, why would you ask?"

"I just don't want you to think I'm bullshitting you, man. There's something I've gotta tell you, I haven't told anyone yet because..." he paused.

"Because?" I inquired, placing my hand on his shoulder for reassurance.

"Well, I don't even want to believe it. Let me tell you one more story, one that's been bothering me since I got back. Promise you won't think I'm bullshitting?"

I nodded my head and gave him my word that I'd trust whatever it was he had to say. Doug eased up a little and let out a long sigh before recounting one final story.

During his time drifting across the states, Doug found himself in a small coastal town down south, somewhere near Florida. He called the place "Twilight falls" but admits that probably isn't the correct name since he blew through thousands of towns during his time drifting and never bothered to keep track of names. Doug's routine was the same for any town he drifted into: Stay a few nights bumming money off locals or working odd jobs to make a little cash so he could stock up for the road and move on.

Doug described Twilight falls as a fisherman's town. Old brick buildings overlooking a jagged and rocky coastline. Rustic boats bobbing on the oceanic waves, working around the clock to bring back hauls of fish to the eroding old docks that were covered in barnacle and smelled of low tide. The locals raised an eyebrow at Doug's presence and gave him a wide berth when he arrived. It was immediately clear to him that he'd have to work odd jobs to get some money, since there weren't many homeless in this town and nobody seemed too generous.

Thinking that the old sailors and fishermen might offer some prospect, Doug headed to the docks and poked around. He popped in and out of shops, hitting up fish stands or parked fishing boats and gave people there his usual speach:

"Hey, I'm a veteran drifting through town. Got any jobs you're willing to pay under the table for? I just need a little money to get home."

Of course, this didn't work a majority of the time. However, Doug is a rather charismatic guy and is smooth with his words, so he'd get someone to agree eventually, even if he had to settle for more questionable and possibly illegal jobs. However, Twilight falls proved to be tough on prospects and Doug had to go hungry that night, sleeping on a bench at the docks.

That night, Doug was awoken by a local from the town. He recognized the lady as a shopkeeper from a place he inquired about earlier in the day. She gave him some food that the shop didn't sell and asked why he needed money. When Doug explained his situation, the kind woman sat on the bench with him and began to explain some of the town's history.

"Our town has legends of a treasure buried somewhere. An old tale says that a Spanish ship chartered the waters around here back in the 1700's. As the story goes, they had stolen gold and were looking to hide it. Of course, they never returned for the treasure and legends say it's hidden somewhere around here to this very day."

Doug nodded, curious about the legend, but mostly just thankful to get something in his belly.

"Why tell me, ma'am?"

"Well, there's a man in this town dedicated to looking for the treasure. Nobody ever wants to help the ol' lunatic, but I've heard him offer some money to those who'd help him. Maybe you could get some funds that way? And who knows, if you find the treasure, you'll walk away rich!"

The lady softly laughed before getting up and patting Doug on the leg.

"You can find him in the old church by the lighthouse. His name is Mr. Pemberton."

Doug thanked the lady as she walked away. With heavy eyes and food in his system, Doug fell back asleep on the bench until the early morning sounds of dock work awoke him the next day. The sailors and fishermen were already out at sea, leaving busy dock workers to occupy the harbor. The horizon was just beginning to glow from the impending sunrise. Locals walked by the bench as Doug stretched and cleared the sand from his eyes. That's when he noticed something strange...

The locals were smiling and waving at him. Someone even said good morning as they passed. A complete 180 from the cold and anti-social behavior from the previous day. Doug chalked it up to people being more friendly and energetic earlier in the day and set out to find the church and Mr. Pemberton.

Sitting at the top of a hill overlooking the rocky coastline was the church mentioned by the kind lady. Doug knew it was the right place because an old, seemingly abandoned lighthouse sat about a hundred yards away from the church. The parking lot for the church was empty, but he figured that they probably didn't have any sermons going on since the first rays of light were shining on a Wednesday morning. When he got closer, he could make out the old, faded letters being displayed above the double wooden doors: \*Divine Waters Church\*.

He tried knocking at first, but nobody answered. When he pushed on the weathered old wood, it slowly creaked opened and revealed a large chamber beyond that echoed the sound of his entry. Taking a few steps inside caused dust to kick up from the old cracking bricks at his feet. When his eyes adjusted to the low light, he could make out a mostly empty room overlooked by a raised platform and an old wooden podium near the back of the chamber. Taking a few more steps inside, it became clear that this church was not in service and hadn't been for some time.

"Hello? Is anyone here?"

His voice echoed off the old brick walls and garnered no response. He looked around the chamber, taking in the sheer size of the interior and the grandeur of its design. Resigning to the fact he wouldn't find anyone, Doug spun around and prepared to leave, but halted when a distinct sound caught his ear.

A very faint and distant scream echoed off the church's walls. It sounded like a young child, crying out in fear or desperately seeking help. Spinning back around, he began to walk further into room. The distant cries were faint but constant, seeming to echo from somewhere ever deeper in the building. With his head on a swivel, Doug searched for the source of the cries and found himself standing in front of the raised podium overlooking the room. That's when he noticed the cries were coming from \*underneath\* the podium.

With one swift motion, he moved the podium aside, revealing a narrow passageway down into the floor. An old rope ladder hung from giant rusted nails, offering access into the depths below. The screaming was much louder now that the podium had been moved, and there was no doubt about it: a child was screaming in absolute terror somewhere down there.

Military training kicked in and Doug rappelled down the rope ladder as fast as humanly possible. Old flickering lights were hung along the musty brick passageway that winded down into the Earth and curved into further darkness below. Urged on by the screams of an unknown child, Doug pressed on into the depths. During the breaks in the child's frantic pleas, however, he soon heard new voices. Adult voices. Aggressive voices.

"Shut up, you shouldn't even be awake right now!"

A second adult voice chimed in, responding to the first:

"Crappy sedatives, tell Mick we aren't trusting that new doc anymore. Idiot will lose his job for this."

Realizing the gravity of the situation, Doug slowed his pace and began to advance much more quietly. Whoever abducted that poor child was only a dozen feet ahead of him, still dragging the kid down the spiraling passageway. The entire time, the kid screamed and thrashed, crying to be let go. After what must have been a few hundred feet of descending down into the Earth, Doug finally heard a door open and shut. When he arrived at the door himself, he put his head against the frame and listened. All he could hear was more screaming and crying from that poor child.

In that moment, he weighed his options. He was outnumbered, only had his switchblade knife, and had no way of knowing if those men were armed. He could leave and get the authorities attention, but by the time they got there, the poor kid could be dead. In the end, he decided to continue spying on them, to further build a testimony against the kidnappers if nothing else. When the kid stopped making any noise, Doug made the very bold decision to quietly open the door just a hair and look through the crack.

At first, he saw the figure of the two men moving around. The room seemed well lit and rather clean, with polished tile flooring and bright lights embedded into the wall. Then he spotted the child: A small boy who was now laid out on a hospital gurney, seemingly unconscious. When the adults came back into view, he saw one was dressed as an officer or security guard and the other wore a white doctors coat. They stood over the unconscious child and what they did next made his stomach drop.

They cut the poor boy open and began to harvest his organs, placing them into some kind of container just out of view. He backed away from the door, his head spinning with sudden nausea and fear at the situation unfolding in the next room. In the silence, he could hear the disgusting sound of flesh being cut.

\*How the fuck did looking for lost treasure turn into this,\* he thought, holding back the urge to vomit last night's meal. Then, the cutting sounds stopped.

"There, that should be a good half a mil on the black market."

The other person laughed in response to the demented statement.

"Yeah, and one less Orphan this town needs to deal with. We're really rolling into some business lately, I've got another target coming later today."

"Oh yeah? Is it that fuckin' homeless guy who blew into town yesterday?"

"Yep. Mrs. Leina gave the fool the ol' town treasure gimmick and he should be here sometime today."

Doug's blood ran cold as the two of them laughed in the other room.

"Well, tell ya what Pemberton, that town treasure gimmick sure do wonders for keeping this town free of homeless and lining our pockets with cash. Let's pack up and get outta here."

Realizing they'd soon be upon him, Doug finally found the strength to move his legs and began running back up the winding passage. He bolted back out into the church parking lot and didn't stop until he was on the edge of town. Despite having no supplies on him, he made the decision to rough it in the wilderness and tough it out until he got to the next town over.

So that's my friend's story. When I asked him why he never brought it to the authorities, he looked me straight in the eyes and said:

"Mike, that whole fuckin' town was in on that shit. Ain't no way they woulda believed some homeless vet."
