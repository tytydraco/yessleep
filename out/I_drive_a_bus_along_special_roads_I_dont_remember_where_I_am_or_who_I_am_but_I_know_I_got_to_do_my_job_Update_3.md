It didn’t take as long to find my trainee as I expected. I think, today really was a good day. I hope you don’t mind, but I’m going to let them do part of the recording today. I want them to get used to remembering, too.

**New Voice:** Hello, I am the Droved.

**Driver:** Do you mean Driven?

**New Voice:** Oh. Yes.

**Driver:** Well, you won’t just be ‘driven’ forever. Eventually, you’ll be drivin’. We’ll call you Trainee for now, okay?

**Trainee:** That works. **Audible rabbit noises.**

They’ve got me smiling. You can’t see it, but I’ve got a big ol’ grin. Hm. Not sure how to show who… I guess you can tell by voice, huh? Well, anyway, I’ll start to recount. Record. Just keep in mind, this isn’t a fun story, still, not entirely. But I’ll take my wins where I can get em’. I’d go stir crazy if I didn’t focus on the good sometimes.

So the pay boxes had gotten full up. I can’t always keep every single one down with me. If I did, you’d not just hear my bus rattling down the road a mile out. An exaggeration, mind. Well, no, maybe not, I’ve got so much ju- So much stuff. I don’t like to change em’ out often. It hurts my back moving all that stuff around, and I usually need help to do it.

**Trainee:** I can help now?

**Driver:** Yeah, course. I’ll need to show you, anyhow.

So, I bring the excess knicknacks to the storage space I got at the Office. Now, the Office, that’s where the Mailman lives, see. He keeps aside a small space for me, since I help with the mail sometimes. I roll on up to the post office, look up at the big building. It looks like a castle to me. It’s got a fancy clocktower on it. All blue and white. Has a few rows of trees out front, surrounding it on all sides like cops at a crime scene. Oh, wait. No, bad metaphor. Like trees in a-

**Trainee:** Garden? Park? Hedge?

**Driver:** That works.

So, like hedges of trees. It’s in one of the city places. A Community. Like that town I went to the other day. If folk get organized enough, pick enough pieces back up, they get to have their own rules sometimes. The regular rules are often in place too, still, but sometimes they get overridden by town rules if the town gets big enough. There’s other exceptions, but not sure what makes em’ exceptional. Maybe the… What’s it. Maybe the mayors? Is that still the word folk use?

**Trainee:** Mayor. Count. Baron. King? I’ve heard king. Too many words.

So the Office. Nobody bothers the Mailman in a bad way. Nobody messes with the guy who handles the mail. It’s hard to get places sometimes around here, and I can’t be everywhere at once. Not the other transport types neither. So we all respect the Mailman, and he keeps the mail in order. Gets it going from inside the wall to outside, other way around. Gets it all across the between. I’m pretty sure it goes to the bright place too.

**Notable silence.**

**Trainee:** Are you okay? **Thump.**

Sorry. I had a… Had a flashback, I suppose. So I go to greet the door man. He tips his dark blue hat, with the little red line and gold badge, my way, and searches me with his eyes.

“Do you observe the Formality, sir?”

“Yes I do, kindly.” I smile and tip my hat back. I don’t never try to throw my weight around, like just cause the Mailman is a friend it means I get to do whatever I want. I wouldn’t want nobody trouncing on my bus like they’re the king just cause I’m familiar with em’ myself, so I return the courtesy.

He asks me a handful of quick questions, calls me friend so I can go in. I’m not pals with him, though. He’s new. Mailman rotates folk a lot. When I step on past the door, I give him a tip. Most of the money I use goes towards small things like this, really. Inside, it’s real nice. Got a high ceiling and wide halls, so even the tallest folk can move about easy like. All white and gold, with big windows. Good lights, working elevators. Floor is this checker brown and tan, with some symbols on the floor here and there where you’ll sometimes see a symbol.

It feels… Familiar, when I go to the Office. Comforting. Like nobody can ever hurt me there, like some sense of. Belonging. Reason. It kind of washes over you. If I stare at the old markings, though, like the symbols, the signs, that sort of thing, I start feeling hollow and twisted in my gut.

**Driver:** Oh, thanks dear. They’re holding my hand. I think my hand was shaking.

I put the new boxes with the old ones, exchange em’ for fresh cardboard in my special little space. I’ve been offered to hunker down there, before, but I’ll tell you honest. I think if I stayed in here, off the road too long, I’d get soft. Uncomfortable. I tried, once, but it felt like eyes were drillin’ into me from every nook and cranny. And I started to forget important things. I stopped feeling the road.

God, there was so much stuff. How long’ve I been at it? It’s been… It’s been a while, definitely. You could fill a couple ball pits with all that stuff. Deep ones.

So, the Mailman comes in. He’s a friend, and I call him that to his face all the time, so he’s got the special permissions. I don’t mind neither if he even looks through the stuff, takes what needs taking. He never touches the stuff on the shelf, though. Or the rack. I don’t quite get why. Just a little bronze bus on some mahogany brick with a plaque on it. Some old photos and clothes. All the faces are scratched out on the pictures, you can’t even read the name and date on the plaque no more.

I think maybe someone gave that stuff to me. Maybe old passengers, way back when. Some of the other old hats have rooms here, too. Though they aren’t all used anymore.

Oh, right. So the Mailman comes in. He kinda looked at me when I went in, but he’s polite. Kept his distance for a bit and waited till I was done fussin’ with the boxes. He’d asked me if I needed help, but I’d said no. I’d felt like I needed to stretch. Make sure everything was working fine.

Some of his eyes and hands dangle on into the doorway. I hear his voice over the intercom. There’s one in every room. Used to be phones, but I think those got put out of date and moved somewhere else. He doesn’t need cameras, but you can’t really talk to him unless you’re in the central processing area.

“You don’t need any help?” His voice crackles over the comm while he peers at me.

“Nope. Done already.” I knew he was just being polite. If I’d needed help, even if I didn’t want it, he wouldn’t ask. He just does it, if you don’t shoo him away. I respect him quite a bit. He reminds me who I drive for.

“The… Tape recorder. Do you need a fresh batch?”

“I might need a few extras. Oh, I’d meant to ask about that. I’ve been wanting to know…” I kind of fiddle for a moment with my tie, adjust my glasses. I even tug at my coat collar, and I realize I’m stalling, so I stop. “You gave it to me as a gift. And I appreciate that.” Having friends is nice, by the way. I can give and get gifts without there being any squares about it. If I could just use the word with everyone who got on my bus, maybe things would be easier. “But… What’s the purpose, exactly? And why the slips?”

There was a thoughtful kind of silence. “I wanted you to keep your head on. And to… Get help, possibly. Have you received many letters?”

“A decent few. Some of them don’t make much sense, though.”

“I’m not sure I’ll be able to… Process those forever.”

“How you mean?” I kind of purse my lips, not sure if this was a social complication or something else. I feel some tension weave itself into my shoulders.

“Impostor messages. They are increasing lately. I think some of the sour souls out there are trying to dig for information they’re not supposed to, trick people.”

“I haven’t gotten anything like that, yet.”

“They’re imitating packages, too. Greater numbers, lately. Possibly a Community operation. If you receive anything strange… Let me know. I am considering redirecting all packages and mail to the center. Hand deliveries only, and pickups, not just the excess.”

“Hrm. Might be necessary, sounds like.” I give him a grave nod, then sort of rub my hands together like it’s cold. “So… I hope I’m not being rude, but… That’s all there is to it? With the tapes?”

There’s a brief pause before the intercom crackles again. I’m not looking at it while the Mailman speaks, though. Other people have a hard time with it, but I look him in the eye - and hands - while he does it. I need to get me nice gloves like his. I used to have a pair. “I’m worried about you. You have not… Changed, extensively. So you… If I myself may be a tad crass… I worry you won’t be able to keep up forever. So the tapes. To remember. The slips, so you can reach out and be reached out to. The letters… They’re the thing that keeps me going. Seeing things in order. People kept out of the dark. I thought it would help you, too.”

I thought about some of the slips. Doing the recordings. Some part of me was on edge, like a rabbit ready to spring-

**Thump.**

Sorry. Like a wolf ready to leap. Wait, that doesn’t- You know what I mean. But I know he means well, and it is helping, I think. For a while, things were calm, but also lonely. I’d been left to my own thoughts, let myself get cooped up. I hadn’t realized how frequent my stretches of just road, road, and more road had been getting till I’d visited the Office again.

“Thank you.” I dropped all that chipper bravado and polite-as-you-please from my voice. Hadn’t realized I’d been hanging onto it, even. I think my throat croaked. “You know, you… The Milkman. All the other old hats. The folk I drive. It does mean a lot to me.” It was a tad awkward, but I shook one of his hands. I think he appreciated it. I heard a frog noise from the intercom, too.

“Be careful out there, J-” There’s a gap. “-Driver.”

I turn to go, then I pause myself. “Oh, wait. One more thing. The… The recordings. The copies. Where does the… Other one go? The slips, too, some of them don’t feel… Local.”

There was a smile to his voice. Somehow, it was a sad smile. I don’t know what it was about what I said, but my heart winced. “It… I’m not fully sure. But I reached out. Someone will remember you. No matter what, I won’t let what you’ve done be forgotten.” His voice almost shakes. I can hear paper rustling over the com.

“Call me if you need anything. I’ll let you know if I see or hear anything strange.” I tip my hat and go. Was a bit clipped there, but I was uneasy now. I’m not going anywhere just yet. Not for a few years, at least. And there’s… Ways around things, if I still need to drive the bus.

**Trainee:** You’re shaking again. Do you need me to-

**Driver:** No, not right now, thank you.

**Silence.**

**Trainee:** Is it my turn, now?

**Driver:** Not yet. I’ve got to… Frame this right, so it sounds good.

The day after, I’m driving through some open space. There’s a forest in the distance, both in front and behind. There’s an old, curving, snaking road made of dirt. I don’t know if this path was ever used by cars back in the day, but it was wide now, and tires, hooves, whatnot printed their paths through it like postal stamps. There were these patches of wildflowers, tree groves, and some weirdly big bushes here and there.

I blink, once or twice, and I swear I see woods where there aren’t. I end up thinking I’m going cooky for a moment. That maybe the roads are blurring. I don’t have any passengers yet, bus is empty as a ghost, and I’d only made a handful of dropoffs. Boxes at my feet weren’t even half-full. I don’t exactly need constant work, since my work and my life are the same thing, but sometimes not seeing people for a while can make me nervous. The nerves set in faster after I have a social encounter, or otherwise, that gets me thinkin’.

I see the bus stop. I pull up, and part of me is expecting to see the other driver, who I’m calling Copyhat - not super creative, I know, but I’ve never been great with names - coming down the road behind me, dust on his wheels. I’ve heard he’s making more mistakes. Getting a little more obvious before correcting. People who get on his bus, they… They don’t usually get to where they need to go anymore.

Sorry, getting off-track. Lot on my mind these days.

So I sit there, waiting for a bit. Gathering my thoughts. Usually, if someone needs picked up somewhere, and they end up lingering long enough, I just sort of… Know, almost. I think it might be driver’s intuition. Something you need when you’ve got such a wide space to cover. Sometimes, I’ll also get calls from people on the radio. My radio number is public, of course. It’s on the posts.

I felt like someone was waiting for me, to be picked up, but I didn’t see anyone. I kind of drummed the wheel with my fingers after a few minutes. Zoned out. When I was about to give up and leave, a man walked out of one of the treelines. He took his sweet time walking up to me, like he could walk the whole road himself anyways. He had a cap, a plaid coat. Big old rifle slung over his back. Lots of red. It felt familiar, homey. Like I was back in time to better days.

I smiled at him. Tipped my hat. He returned the smile, made eye contact, and everything seemed in order. He got onto the bus, and promptly put what was obviously a deer liver into my pay box. It was fresh.

I noticed some of that red wasn’t just his coat pattern. He’d already paid, though. And odd wasn’t a crime.

“Where you headed today?” I asked, smooth as butter.

He gave me coordinates. Full ones.

I looked over my shoulder at him. I might’ve frowned, but he was smiling, so he must not’ve noticed. Or didn’t care. I adjusted my glasses, pulled out a map. I’d gotten an up to date one while I was in the particular Community the Office is in. Well, a box of maps. Just in case. I didn’t quite know how to read them - something that made me feel odd, made me wonder if I used to before but I’d just forgot - so I sort of. Followed the roads, so to speak. Somehow, I found the coordinates, like I was stretching a limb.

**Driver:** Do you think… The one where the name is just pictures is a real town? It doesn’t sound real.

**Trainee:** I’ve been there before. The shadow puppets are bad at names, even fake ones.

**Driver:** Well alright then.

So I double check with the passenger this is where he needs getting. As I talk, I adjust my mirror to keep an eye on him. Was getting an off feeling, and whether it was false alarm or not, I always need to pay attention to it. Don’t think ill - I learned that lesson again too recently - but don’t act stupid.

As I adjusted the mirror, I paused. Kept it where it was a sec as I got a certain angle.

On the tallest hill in the open space, on what I guessed must’ve been the best vantage point for surveying the land, was an old hunting lodge. It looked well-maintained, with lots of windows. Big ones. Good, sturdy timber. Wide porch, strong-looking supports. Big balcony that circled it like a skirt rim. At a guess, if you went past those well-worn oak doors, which looked freshly polished despite their age, you could bring in a dozen or more people.

It hadn’t been there before. I know it hadn’t. I’m old, but I’m not dumb.

There was a flash of something coming from one of the windows, something that glinted off my mirror. I checked the weather vane, the one I used to figure out my relation to the walls and the bright spot at the end of the road. I was fairly firmly headed away from the bright. I checked on my passenger.

“You know much about that building? That’s safe to say, that is.” I started driving. Wanted to get away from it, something felt familiar and wrong about it. I also got the feeling, at those particular coordinates, there was someone waiting to be picked up.

I entered the woods. It was quiet. The rustle of branches and leaves, things moving in the underbrush, other familiar sounds surrounded me. The peace and quiet of a safe road, where the animals had gone elsewhere to play. Sunlight dappled in from between the leaves as the canopy grew thicker, then turned into full blow bathing sunlight when it grew thin. It was bright out. Bright, but quiet.

“Oh that? That’s the-” He gave me something that sounded a hell of a lot like an old address. One that tingled at the back of my mind.

I almost stopped there. But I kept going. All sorts of bells were going off in my head.

“You know you’re not supposed to drop names like that, right? You new?” I’d seen hunters come in from beyond the walls - from the bright, too, from Communities - that don’t quite know what’s going on. I’ve seen plenty of good people go missing that way. Many of them made it extra hard on themselves by doing it illegally. The ones who were supposed to be there, usually the wall folk wanted them there. Needed help with something, or needed an expert.

There was blood on my passenger’s hands, and his shirt. “Oops. Sorry, fella. Might be too excited, got some good kills recently.”

“Like… Good deer, maybe?” I noticed, at this point, the Deer weren’t about today. They’d been coming out in bigger herds, larger numbers, like someone was cranking them out in a factory. They’d mostly been unusual, curious still. Liked to keep their noses in other people’s business.

I didn’t see a single one today. Not a regular one, either. Not even a bird. We passed a thick patch of wood, and I saw worked, structured timber, a boxy sort of outline, in the distance. Sheltered like camouflage by the leaves and trunks. “Deer, yeah. Other things, too.”

My passenger’s reply set some firm tension into my back that crawled up my shoulders. I felt like a puppet on strings. “Well, I’d advise some caution about these woods. There’s some strange things out there. Things you don’t want to run into. Did anyone give you, like, pamphlets? Or-”

He smiled at me through the rear view. Something about it was too imperfect. His posture was a little slouched. He watched the windows, mostly the opposite side from where I’d seen the outline.

“Can I ask you something blunt?”

“Go ahead.”

“You a… Shifter? Blender?”

“Huh? Oh, yeah, caught me.” He kind of frowned, looked disappointed. Leaned forward a little. “I didn’t pass, did I?”

Needless to say, I didn’t like that response. It was tailored. Well-tailored. If I hadn’t been around the block so long, I feel like you’d want to play down your awareness, not play it up. But I’d done my rounds.

It knew that. “Not… Quite, sorry.” I kept myself from gripping my wheel. Tried to play the game. I think that’s what set it off. Made it realize I was onto it. Maybe I smiled too hard. Maybe it wanted to string me along longer, make it a maybe, not a definitely.

With his little lean he’d got a handle on a skinning knife. All of a sudden he was grinning real wild. He bolted up, started running down the bus aisle. He swung at me.

I caught it with my hand. It went almost clean through, like an arrow through a thin target. It was at that same moment I heard something crack. My bus had crunched over something. I was being attacked, but I adjusted my rear view anyway, checked my side, and I saw a small wooden horse, carefully painted, cracked in two on the road behind me.

It looked like it meant something to someone.

There was a gunshot. The man attacking me fell to the ground. The few birds left in the forest fluttered out in a panic. They’d gotten my attacker clean in the neck. But he still managed to burble something. “...Eave. …O.”

I didn’t watch him die. I kept driving. Hit the gas a little. Didn’t look to my sides, but kept my head down a bit. Sped up when the trees got thin, slowed down slightly when they got thick. The building was following me. The one from the hill. I saw it in flashes, and its windows watched me like eyes. My hand was bleeding, but I wasn’t going to survive for long if I let that be my concern. It hurt to keep my hand on the wheel, but I couldn’t bandage my own headshot wound.

I ended up reaching my destination. When I got there, I saw someone. Under one of the benches, one of the taller ones, there was a woman. Had a rabbit’s head, proportioned to fit on a human body.

**Trainee:** Is it my turn?

**Driver:** Yeah, it is.

I’d been hunted for a while. I’d not been doing anything wrong. I’d just been making my way through the woods, when I heard a snap. I saw a fragile piece of pottery drop from a tree, shattering onto the ground. It’d been quiet. Very serene and warm. I know to watch for traps, but this one was well-hidden. Tiny, thin string of some kind, maybe, so thin you couldn’t see it.

**Driver:** Tripwire.

I stopped to pick up the pieces. Panicked a bit. My heart was thumping. There was a name of a place on it. I think I was supposed to read it. But I didn’t. Something came after me. I heard timber cracking. There were strange shapes in the woods. A gunshot rang out. Hit the tree right next to me, bullet embedded into the trunk. I didn’t know if it was a warning shot, or if it was supposed to hit me, so I ran.

Voices called after me. “The deer have been gettin’ spooked lately. I wanted to get some venison for the fridge this season.” I heard one say. I was dashing through the trees, trying not to step on anything else. To not break any more rules. I didn’t know if I was being hunted by an animal, or a person. Didn’t know what was what. “Do you believe in the bog hag? No, it’s not nonsense. My grandfather saw it himself, my dad too.” Another voice whispered, but it was loud.

I could hear every word coming from all around me, confusing me. Sending my head spinning, my eyes every which way. I think they didn’t want me to know where they were coming from, second guess where I was going. No matter what they said, no matter what voice, what tone, even their whispers were loud as birdsong.

“Leave it. You’re not gonna get a clean shot. Trophy? Yeah, sure, but humane kills, man. You won’t just ruin the trophy. Bad luck. There’s a story that my…” The voices trailed off, went an obvious direction. Away. I didn’t think they receded fully. I think they thought I wasn’t smart, that I’d just get up and move on like they’d never showed up. So I hid under a bench. I’d heard there was a bus driver who’d show up when you were in trouble.

**Trainee:** That’s a very big smile.

**Driver:** Sorry. Don’t mean to show teeth.

**Trainee:** I’m not scared of your teeth, you’re not a monkey. Stop laughing.

The Driver pulls up after a while. Maybe fifteen minutes? Thirty? I see the post, the one with his face on it - the one that still looks right - has the green circle. I don’t think he was sure he wanted to stop for me. He looked wild-eyed, like he was being run down. I’d heard a gunshot. But he stopped. He pulled the lever, the door whooshed open. So I got on.

He was bleeding. There was a body on the bus. I wanted to get off, but I didn’t, because I felt I was safer on the bus still than out there with the Lodge. He really quickly looked me over, frowned, then looked me in the eye before waving his good hand. He had his head down, so I crouched. “Tell me where you’re headed. And I give you permission to go into the hatch. In the back. I’m gonna need my med kit.”

I do what he says. Tell him “anywhere but here”. He asks me if there’s a town nearby, a proper one, and I give him some quick directions. I go into the back. I hear gunshots coming from above. I don’t touch any of his things. I wasn’t allowed to, except the med kit. I hesitated for a moment, since him asking me to retrieve it was only implied. Wondered if there was a trick. Then I realized, I think, that he was just trying to get me to hide.

**Silence.**

He’s looking real thoughtful right now. I think he-

**Driver:** Need to remember to be careful with my words…

He’s mumbling now. So I bring the medkit out anyways. He looks hurt, and we were already in danger. It was a small thing, so I risked it. He looks at me like he’s shocked. His driving is getting a bit swervy. He tells me it’s okay, but I need to keep my head down. So I start disinfecting, bandaging his hand while he works the bus with his free hand. He does his best to keep on the road.

The radio crackles to life. I think I hear something snap, something whips past the window. There’s another snap, and something sharp shatters the glass near my head and goes clean through the other side. The glass falls like cutting snow. “The world’s changing. We need to eat. I can’t tell anymore. What’s okay to shoot at. But we need to figure it out.” The voice on the radio sounds half-dazed.

“I’ll do my best to get you through this. Promise. I always try my best.” I noticed the Driver, when he spoke, did not tell me he’d get me where I needed to go. I don’t think he wanted to lie. He sounded half-awake, too.

We rattle down the road while the world is half silence, half frantic danger. Everything’s alive but the things we want to be. No one comes to help. Neither of us bother trying to get it. It was hard to tell if the radio could be used, still. And it wasn’t clear if anyone was nearby who could, or would, help.

The world flashes around us. The landscape zips and changes. I don’t know where we’re going anymore. I’m scared.

**Driver:** It’s okay. It’s over now.

**Strangled breathing.**

The radio speaks. “You let it suffer. You took a trophy that was not yours.” The voice was older, somehow clearer.

I got an idea. I asked the bus driver if I could borrow something from his underspace. He paused, then said yes. I took a moment to make sure he was aware of what he was saying, that he wasn’t half-passed out. I finished bandaging his hand. Winced as I watched him set it on the wheel, grip it firmly enough it bled again anyways.

I crawled on my belly towards the hatch. Went inside. I’d noticed some of the things he kept down there were odd. He had boxes that didn’t have much in them, where I figured he stored personal belongings. There was a box of tapes. A recorder. So I shouted up if I could use his things, and he shouted back with a strained tone.

I recorded myself saying something. “I’m gonna look. I need to see where it is.” I went back up, and I played the tape. I’d noticed something else, while I was on the floor.

The man in the plaid was still breathing. Just slightly. A faint rise and fall of his chest. His eyes were glazed over, but I’d heard his heartbeat. He wasn’t looking my way. He was looking out the windows opposite from the side of the road the Lodge was treading. I’d grabbed a pair of binoculars, too, from the boxes. I’d let him see it in my right hand, faced my right side towards him, but angled my left side the other way.

When I peeked my head out, there was a sharp pain as one of my ears took a bullet. But so had the recorder.

The Lodge had broken the rules, too. And so it could be hunted.

I saw the bus driver smile. He called for security. Someone said something about a nearby unit. After a few minutes of further driving, the voices taking the channel back and calling out borrowed words, I saw a great, lupine figure with a very distorted outline emerge into the treeline. Like it had always been there.

I think I heard someone scream. Maybe several someones. I couldn’t hear out of my left ear anymore, so I turned my head a little to hear it. My heart pounded so fast it hurt.

The last sounds I heard from the hunting lodge, besides the screams and the creaking of timber, came from the voice it was ghosting into the driver’s radio. “I didn’t mean to. I didn’t know it was… That it was a person. Folk. Please. I’ll do whatever you want. Just, don’t hurt-”

It cut out. And we drove.

We went into one of the safe - organized, proper rather - towns. Got the driver patched up. They took care of my cuts. I look like… I look like…

**Driver:** A mummy.

**Trainee:** I’m not a mother.

He’s looking at me oddly. But, yes, like a mummy. Whatever that means. He kind of does, too. I think he’s anxious to get back on the road, but I don’t think we should leave yet. Not until he’s doing better. And not until we know for sure the hunt is over.

**Driver:** I remember now. I drove him. No, not him. His… I drove the family. I think he was a friend. I think it was a favor. Did I… I did, I got them where they… Where they needed…

They gave him something to keep him calm, help him sleep. I think it’s working.

**Driver:** I won’t forget you. I won’t forget. I promise. I couldn’t if I wanted to. I don’t think anyone could. Watching you stand there, at the door. Smiling. Tears down your face, that you only let me see. Through the rear view. I see you’ve got new clothes. Your old friends are still around. I drove them out, too, didn’t I? Not them, but…

**Audible quiet.**

**Driver:** That hand. That gnarled hand. You told me she was your grandmother. But I was there when you buried her.

I can still hear his heartbeat as he drifts off. So I know he’s alive. When everything was over, we gave the hunter on the bus mercy. But I don’t think he got it. I watched the lodge leave, when it was safe again. And I saw a lot of people in the windows. I saw a lot of trophies.

**Recording ends. New one begins.**

I’ll tell you a secret, now. This copy, this tape. This one’s just for you. I shouldn’t have, but he said I could use the tapes. The recorder. So I listened to the others.

I’m in the bus right now, down in the hatch. I’m watching the slips write themselves. I did a test, sent one back. Got a reply. I know you’re there. I know you must know things, that he doesn’t. That I don’t.

I want the job. I really do. But I need to learn certain things, and I don’t know how long he’ll have left to tell me everything I need to know. I need to keep him safe. I have a family I want to get back to. And I don’t think he knows how to drive to the moon. What do you know about the stars? 

And why don’t the tapes just belong to him?
