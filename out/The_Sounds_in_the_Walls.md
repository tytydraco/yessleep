The Sounds in the Walls

I’ve always been a light sleeper, but after moving into this house, my nights have become unbearable. It started small—a few knocks, creaks, and taps in the walls at night. I brushed it off as the house settling or just old pipes. You hear stories like that all the time, right? But it didn't stop there.

One night, around 3 a.m., I woke up to a strange sound coming from behind the wall in my bedroom. It wasn’t the usual creaking or tapping. This was different—more like a low, steady scraping, like something was inside the wall trying to get out. I told myself it was probably a rodent, but deep down, I knew that wasn’t it.

I started recording the sounds. The next day, I played the audio back to my friend Tom. He’s a contractor, so I figured he’d know what could be causing it. He listened, frowning the entire time.

"That doesn’t sound like anything I’ve ever heard," he said after a while. He offered to come over the next day to inspect the walls.

That night, the sounds got worse. Louder, more frequent, and accompanied by an odd rustling sound, almost like whispering. I couldn’t sleep, so I sat up in bed, staring at the wall, trying to make sense of it. That’s when I saw something that I still can't explain.

There was a faint outline of a hand pressing against the wall from the inside. Not an animal's, not a shadow—an actual human handprint. I froze, my heart pounding so hard I thought it would explode. I wanted to scream, but fear gripped me so tightly I couldn’t move.

Then, the whispers got louder. I couldn’t make out what they were saying, but they were definitely voices—many of them—murmuring things I couldn’t understand. And then, just like that, everything went silent. The handprint disappeared. 

I spent the rest of the night in my car, too terrified to go back inside.

The next morning, Tom showed up with tools to check the walls. I told him what had happened, and he just shook his head like he didn’t believe me. But when he started tearing into the drywall, he went pale.

Behind the wall, there were remnants of a hidden room—a small space, barely big enough for a person to stand. And inside, buried in the insulation, was a collection of old photographs. Black and white, faded with age, showing a family I didn’t recognize. But there was something off about the people in the pictures. Their eyes looked too big, their expressions too stiff, as if they were being forced to pose.

And then, there was the smell—an awful, rotting stench that made us both gag. That’s when we found the bones. Small, fragile bones wrapped in old cloth, almost like a mummified infant.

I moved out the next day.

The police were called, and they’re still investigating the origins of the bones, but nothing’s come of it so far. No one can explain the noises, the whispers, or the handprint I saw in the wall. I’ve tried to convince myself it was all just a bad dream, but every time I close my eyes, I hear the whispers. 

And sometimes, late at night, when I’m lying in bed, I swear I can feel something brushing against the inside of the walls.

I don’t know what it was, but I hope to God it never follows me.
