I didn’t think I would be making an update, but I figured it was the right thing to do since all of you were so supportive when I posted a few days ago. It all came to a head, I guess, and my family and I are currently living in the worst case scenario.[Here’s my original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/WaLLmBPsHY)

My parents and the cops were still organizing search parties in the woods surrounding our house. Their working theory was that Kevin had some sort of underlying mental health issue that was made worse by the weeks of isolation on the trail. They also think that maybe he could have been given something or taken something while out there and the chemical reaction of whatever drug caused some sort of psychosis.

I couldn’t bring myself to tell them that that thing wasn’t my brother. All the comments on my last post made that pretty clear. I don’t think I can say that I had accepted the fact he was gone at that point, but I knew whatever we found of him, if we found anything at all would not be my brother.

Well, we did find him. It happened last night, it was late but my parents were still out with the police and sniffer dogs in the woods. I was told to stay home in case he came back while they were gone. I was sitting in the living room, keeping an eye on the side yard where the woods start to get thicker, when I heard this weird “thunking” sound. It was slow, and paced evenly, like a metronome. Thunk, pause, thunk, pause, thunk. From my viewpoint in the living room, I could see a shadow cast across the dining room table, backlit from the streetlights outside.

My parents’ house is sort of a U shape, you can walk a circle around the first floor, going from kitchen to dining room, to living room, and back again. I slipped off the couch and sort of crouch-walked my way into the kitchen. From there I had enough of a cover from the wall dividing the living room and dining room, so that I could see the bay window that looked out across the front yard. There was my brother, or rather the thing pretending to be my brother. He was standing in front of the window, rocking back and forth on his heels. He walked to close, and his forehead would clunk against the window, thunk, then he would step back almost like it had surprised him, pause, and then rock forward again, thunk.

He looked awful. His skin was sallow, and slick with sweat, which made no sense since it’s November in New England, it hasn’t been above 50 degrees in weeks. His lips were crusted over with blood, and I knew enough at that point to know it wasn’t his. The worst thing though, were his eyes. They were this sickly pale blue, the lenses looked cataract, and his pupils were dilated, unfocused points. My breath hitched in the back of my throat and my heart felt like it was going to fall out of my stomach. I kept my eyes trained on him as I reached for my cell phone and tried to dial 911.

The phone trilled and I waited for the operator to pick up. There was soft click and then:

“Middleton County 911, do you need fire, police, or ambulance?”

I started to speak and then suddenly Kevin seemed to focus on me. Maybe he had heard my voice? His clouded eyes seemed to laser focus for a moment, training on me crouched behind the wall. I wasn’t sure if he could see me, he shouldn’t have been able to from his position, but the thunking became louder and more urgent. I gave the operator my name and address, Kevin began to bang into the window faster and faster. I tried to explain that my missing brother was back, but that something was wrong, that he was trying to…to do something. The crack of the windowpane was the loudest sound I had ever heard. I watched as my brother slammed his head again, and again into the glass.

Blood smeared across his forehead and then the cracking turned to a smash, as my brother crashed through the pane. I screamed, I dropped my phone and I ran. The only room in my parents’ house with a lock is the bathroom so I scrambled to get there and lock the door.

Once I was there, I could hear Kevin falling through the broken window and lumbering around the house. His feet sounded unnaturally heavy, like they were waterlogged. I could hear the crunching sound of broken glass under feet and I looked around for something, anything, I could use as a weapon. I just kept telling myself I would not go down without a fight. As quietly as I could I took the cover off the back of the toilet tank. It was heavy and made of porcelain and I figured that even if it didn’t kill that thing hopefully it would at least stun it enough to give me time to make a break for it. 

I could hear him outside the door, sniffing the air like a dog. I held my breath and readied myself. There was nothing for a few moments. No sounds of walking or sniffing. I waited a few more seconds before I knelt to the ground and peered under the gap in the door. My brother’s dead eye stared back at me. I screamed as the door began to bulge as that thing shoved its shoulder into the frame. I grabbed the tank cover again, readied myself. That’s when I heard the sirens.

I could hear shouting from outside, and the stomping of boots across the smashed glass. The thing wouldn’t stop, it keep throwing itself against the door. I heard one of the cops yell “Taser!” and then a rapid clicking noise. There was more shouting,  more clicking and then one of them said “Stop, or we will shoot.” The thing outside the door paused for a moment and then it charged at the officers, I could hear it heavy feet lurch across the floor. That’s when I heard the gun shots. This is where I sort of black out.

 

From what the cops tell me, they were able to get me out of the bathroom, my parents were called back in from the woods and were told their son had been found trying to attack their daughter. They were told that he had been killed after he attempted to attack an officer. We’re staying in a hotel now, close to the station. They are going to interview us all again in the morning, they plan on doing an autopsy on my brother. My parents haven’t said a word to me since we got here. I think they blame me. I wasn’t the one to shoot my brother, but I was the person who called the man who did.

I don’t know if you all were hoping for some kind of miracle where we get a happy ending, but this is it. Maybe I’ll update you all again after the autopsy report is finalized, but honestly, I think its best to just let it go.

 

My brother Kevin was kind, funny, smart, and most of all adventurous. He wasn’t that thing that came home to us. My brother died out on the trail, not bleeding out on the floor in the house we grew up in. I don’t think we’ll ever have answers, unless maybe some of you have them? Hold your loved one’s tight tonight. Rest in peace, big brother.
