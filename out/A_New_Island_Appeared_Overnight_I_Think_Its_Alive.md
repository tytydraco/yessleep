Hello, this is Dr. Howard. I’m part of an expedition sent to investigate the newly formed caverns and tunnels that appeared after a world-shaking event. I’m also the team psychologist, tasked with monitoring both the mission and the psychological well-being of the crew. I'm logging on via satellite to keep records for work and myself, Speech to text for when I need to be hands-on.



The world changed on the day it all shook. We thought it was the end, but in 30 minutes, a new landmass appeared between North America and Europe. Some of us thought the Earth had simply been rattled—like a great hand had given us one last shake.



The United Nations, in their wisdom, decided to send multiple teams to explore. Each team is composed of a psychologist, a biologist, an engineer, a geologist, a medical specialist, and two armed guards (the U.S. insisted on this, as always). We should arrive soon. I’ll keep updating this journal as we settle in.



3:00 PM



It took longer than expected to reach the island. The higher-ups gave us their word they knew the distance. But I'm sure it's just a miscalculation. The guards are very quiet, perked up like rottweilers, it's strange every team is sent to different parts of the island and we are first contact.  



As we approached the island I couldn't help but feel something… It's probably nothing but as we were pulling into the coast I..I swear it almost felt like something was hovering above the Island. I couldn't see anything and Steven our Engineer said the equipment wasn't picking up anything. The skies above the Island are guttural purples and dark blues. Like someone threw up colors. I can't focus on it, it's almost offensive to my eyes. 



Now that we are on the Island I still have the feeling from time to time but I'm starting to think it's just strong winds just above the tree line. The wind almost sounds like a train. Not the metal parts just the sound of the wind from a full speed Train or a truck even. All I know is the wind sounds heavy. It's even taken out some trees, uprooting them, and the like. Tantya Says the winds are off too whatever that means I'll have to inquire about that later.



Regardless it's not my area of expertise I'll have to ask Tanya about it later. Our Bioligist/Meteroligist. I thought I was smart but 2 doctorates are impressive. Though it obviously hurt her social skills. She is the most Awkward of us for sure. Not to mention she's dressed like a merchant from that one game. Her pockets are lined with tools for collecting maximum samples. Collecting samples I notice the plants dripping a gooey mess similar to the sky. 



The leaves are almost trembling. I'm sure it's the wind but.. Their movement is definitely a pattern. I'm sure Tanya notices it too. The weather and plants are her field. Though she seems erratic I'm not sure. I'll keep notes about my observations on the planet and cross notes with her later.



7:00 PM

“Gotta make sure I get the whole day down, with notes in person. I feel it's the most effective way we can experience this expedition together. I was actually encouraged by my boss to keep a blog going. Keeping it as a record but also helping the world understand what we are doing. 



He knows I can write up adequate notes but rewording events as I go over everything is what he really values. He says “Gotta make the men in charge really experience our journey. It's none of my business who reads this I'm just glad to be doing something. Oh, Shit I'll call you back I think the computer is on... Is there a way to delete it? .. nope great”



Sorry “great job” on my part i was rambling to myself and the speech-to-text must have heard me. I guess now is a good time as any to start taking notes.



Currently, the guards have stopped us quite a distance from our destination. “Great spot for camp,” the older one said. I'm sure our destination would have been good. Steven is currently flying a drone over the area. Bragging that his drone was the one that mapped the island the first time. I'll reserve my belief for now.



Peeking over his shoulder I notice the drone is hitting something upon elevation. I wonder if it's a wind current? Whatever it is we can't see it from our spots. I notice the headphones around his neck.

“Mind if I listen?”



“Go ahead but there is some sort of interference, it's loud whatever it is.”

 

With the headphones in my ear, It sounds like running water but thicker. Must be the strange wind Tanya mentioned. “Defiantly gross.” After some masterful maneuvering (Ramming it into whatever was in its way) The drone is finally on the move. 



“The foliage is almost prehistoric “ says Tanya who has joined in on the peeping. “I'll have to uh.. Continue to collect but it seems to me older vegetation the closer to the center.” 

,

At this point, she's practically pushed me out of the way. Fixated on the screen. Defiantly rambling to herself now. If she did something with her hair I could probably still see but again this isn't my field. 



“If we have such rich Plants… where are the animals? I mean not even a wandering bird. Now that I think about it I don't think we saw marine life period since we've been in view of the island have we?”



Stevens's observation froze the entire camp, except the guards of course. That was a good question and he was right no sea life. If the land rose from the waters like we think I can understand no land animals but there are no washed-up carcasses of sea life, not even a single stray bird. 



Steven returned his drone and we will finish setting up camp. I need time to sleep and process today's events. I'll be sure to log in tomorrow to keep you all updated on the events going on.



LOGGING OFF…
