I’m a coroner. I've only had one strange encounter in my career, but it still keeps me up at night. 
 
I don't get freaked out by much. I'm not a squeamish person, nor a superstitious one. You can’t be in my line of work. But I can't explain John Doe.

We don't get any murders in my city. Overall we're a pretty quiet and safe community. It's rare that a full autopsy is required. And it's more likely to be requested for unexpected deaths, medical malpractice, that kind of thing than it is for a suspected murder. We don't have a separate medical examiner's office, I'm just in the basement of the hospital. Which frankly isn't much of a hospital. It's better equipped than a typical doctor's office but there are outpatient centers that are bigger than us if you go to a big city. If you have a complicated illness you drive a few hours to Cleveland. However -- I'm our coroner. I certify all deaths in the city and perform all our autopsies.

When an unknown body turned up in the woods, you better believe the cops were all over it. It was the only exciting thing to happen to them that week. Hell, maybe ever. Several more officers than were necessary came in with the paramedics looking for some answers on how he'd gotten there. 

I didn’t know. He didn't have any defensive wounds. There was nothing in the initial exterior examination. Liver mortis and rigor mortis were present. I estimated the death at around tweleve hours prior. The x rays came back normal. There were no obvious signs of poisoning upon interior examination. Stomach contents were a half digested tuna sandwich and I think a coke. His heart was enlarged, but not abnormally so. It was indicative of cardiomyopathy, but this is the United States of America. We're all fat and have heart disease. The one weird thing was that we had trouble getting prints. No matter how we took them they just looked… blurred. The police couldn’t run them. But his fingertips didn’t appear to be damaged in any way. To visual inspection they appeared normal.

Due to the lack of any other evidence, I would have guessed heart attack, if I hadn’t known the circumstances. But he was found a mile into the woods, stark naked, a few feet off the trail. The most likely cause, I felt, was poison. There weren't obvious signs, but sometimes there aren't, depending on what was used. He didn't have dirty feet, which meant he probably didn't strip naked and go for a run. He was likely placed there after death. 

I told the police as much. I packed his organs back into his chest cavity, his brain back in his skull, and put him away. I sent the samples to the lab for testing, but it takes a while and the really comprehensive panels are expensive enough that the department didn’t want to pay for them. I mean, you don't show up in the woods, naked, by yourself, in the middle of the night, and then die of natural causes, typically. He didn't show any obvious signs of a drug overdose. The police believed it was a homicide, but without any evidence I ruled cause of death undetermined. We left it there.   
 
And that was the last I thought of it, until the lab called me to ask what the hell I had sent them. The lab results were inconclusive. They couldn’t get any DNA from the samples at all.

I went to get the body back out and take some more samples, maybe look at some new tissue slides under the microscope again. But he wasn't where I left him.

I looked high and low - meaning in each cold locker, thinking I had mislabeled or misremembered where I put him, but he wasn't in any of them. It's not a large morgue. It's not like misplacing your keys. If I couldn't find the body it was gone.

I didn't like that at all. To be honest with you, I panicked. How do you lose a body? In all my years in the field I had never heard of such a thing happening. I called up the chief of police and explained the situation.

He asked some questions I wasn't sure of the answers to. Yes, I'd left my office unattended on occasion. No, I hadn't been paying close attention to whether I locked it at the end of every day. I was pretty sure I did, I do so out of habit, but I wasn't completely sure. We're a small city. Safe. Stealing human remains is outside the common way. It’s not something I had considered a possibility.

So the police added a report about the theft of human remains from government custody, which I'm sure if they ever caught the perpetrator would be a list of charges longer than my leg. The running theory was that someone stole the remains to cover up the murder. That didn't go over well, since it implied a member of the hospital staff was likely involved, but what can you do. The police weren't too serious about pursuing it. I dont think they seriously suspected anyone at the hospital. Without an ID it was hard to investigate.

It was a decent "scary story" to talk about at parties, especially since the death had been well covered by the local papers. Everyone around here had heard about it.

A few months went by and honestly I hardly thought about it anymore, though I was careful to lock the morgue when I left for the day. We were busy. We were having an unfortunate uptick in deaths so I had gotten the okay to hire on an assistant. He was a sharp kid, he learned quickly. 

He had a few autopsies under his belt, when another body turned up. John Doe, clothed this time, Hanes (not so) white T shirt and Levi's, well worn tennis shoes. Called in by a scared teen who found him in the dumpster behind the fast food joint where she worked.

It was a different pair of cops who responded at the scene. Whole different team of people, EMTs, everybody. Which is why I guess I was the first to notice.

"What the fuck?" I said, when I saw his face.

"What?" asked my assistant. 

"This is the same guy," I said. "This is the same guy that went missing before."

"A missing persons case? You recognize him?"

"No I mean the same guy... the remains that went missing. A few months ago. How is this possible?"

My assistant didn't have any idea, but I was highly agitated and probably not making a lot of sense. I called the police department. The two cops who brought him in this time weren't particularly helpful. They started speculating that it was a serial killer with a specific type. I called back and insisted they send some more senior guys down, the ones who picked up John Doe before.

So Laurent and Bill came down to take a look. 

"Well I'll be goddamned," Laurent said.

"Its the same fucking guy."

"Couldn't be," Bill said. "A twin maybe?"

"...Maybe," I agreed grudgingly. "It must be. What are the odds?"

"Well, could it be the same guy?" Laurent asked. "Hear me out, what if they took the remains and froze them?"

I shook my head. "I performed an autopsy last time. This guy hasn't been cut open."

"You'd think if there was a pair of identical twins missing someone would have reported it," Bill said. "I can make a few calls. Let me know if anything comes back."

The weird thing -- well one of the weird things -- about that body, was that it was... fresh. The police believed he had been in the dumpster a few hours at most, but he could have died elsewhere and been moved, and in fact that seemed likely based on the activity at the restaurant. However, he had no signs of livor mortis, which if you don't know, is discoloration of the skin due to blood pooling. It's obvious to visual inspection. The ambient temperature was quite warm, and counterintuitively this typically accelerates the onset of rigor mortis, which you probably do know of. It begins in fine muscles of the face before affecting the hands, and then the rest of the larger muscles, making them stiff. It usually sets in about 2 hours to 8 hours post mortem, and lasts for about a day altogether. You can estimate the time since death based on how it's affecting the muscles. John Doe had no signs of rigor mortis whatsoever, nor any of the markers that come after that. In short, he was dead, but didn’t display some of the typical signs of being dead, and none of the ones that would help estimate time since death. He presented, honestly, like someone who had just died on the examination table moments before.

We have a set of steps we take to verify a person is actually dead. It includes an EKG. There's no way to make a mistake. The EMTs on the scene had also pronounced him dead, for what that’s worth. He was dead. I felt a bit superstitious but even so, I couldn’t help but check for a pulse a few times before making an incision, just in case. I had a weird feeling like the subject wasn't dead. Or, and I feel weird even saying this, but just barely dead. "Only mostly dead" as they said in The Princess Bride, but I mean it in a much less charming way. Something about this body felt off. However, I’m not sure if I was just jittery due to the circumstances, and hindsight does not improve my recollection of him at all.

If you're a decent coroner, you’re the methodical type. I'm at least halfway decent, and wouldn’t say I half assed it the first time, but I was extremely meticulous this time. By the book. We opened him up. We examined every organ. We even cut into his limbs, which we don't normally do without specific reason. We took a lot more samples than we had the first time. 

His heart was strange. I weighed it and it was enlarged. I was planning to do a couple of cross sections to see if it was healthy. But when I pressed into it with the scalpel, a viscous white fluid oozed out. It had a smell that seeped through my mask. My assistant had to run and wretch. I don't know if you've ever vomited into a face mask and shield, but it's messy. He was effectively down for the count.

The smell was like walking into a Yankee candle store, sort of: not a bad smell per se, not like a severely decomposing body, but still strong enough to make you lightheaded. I've never seen or heard (or smelled) of anything like it. It was like the fluid had completely filled the atrial and ventral cavities. I would have said it was like his blood had been replaced, but when we vacuumed out his chest cavity the blood had been normal. His arteries and veins were normal. It was only the heart. I guessed that whatever happened must have been post-mortem or else it would have been pumped through his arteries. But that didn't explain *what* had happened.

I briefly debated the merits of dumping the fluid down the sink, and therefore eventually into the municipal water supply, but decided against it. I put on fresh gloves and took a careful sample, being sure to seal it. I then put the whole metal tray full of the substance into one of the triple bagged five gallon buckets we had handy. I tied the bags off, closed the lid, and then bagged the bucket for good measure. We left the room. I locked the door behind me and we went upstairs to give my assistant a chance to recuperate. The ventilation down there is very good so we hoped it would dissipate the smell in the meantime.

When we finally went back into the room the smell had mostly disappeared. Along with the body.

So had the samples, the bucket with the substance in it, and even the camera we had been photographing him with.

We called in the police again, they added a note to their report. If you’re wondering about security footage, we had very few cameras. They were limited to the public entrances at the front and back of the building, and in the emergency room and main corridors on the first floor. There weren’t any in the stairwells, which were on either side of the building had emergency exit doors to the outside. Nor were there any cameras in the basement, which only held the morgue, some storage rooms, and some admin offices. I know it probably seems strange to some of you, but we’re a drive by town with no real crime, and this was years ago. Cameras weren’t as ubiquitous as they are today. I heard the police complained to the mayor, but the state was also in the middle of a budget crisis at that time, so I assume they didn’t have the money to add more.

So, when the body showed up the third time, about six months later, I was beside myself. An distressed citizen called in a report of a “creepy man” parked in a car just outside her family’s home. When dispatch sent some police to investigate, it became obvious he was dead. After they shot him. After a couple verbal warnings the rookie officer panicked and fired. The bullet passed through his left shoulder.

Word got around, the rookie was swearing up and down the he saw movement, which is clearly impossible because the man was dead. But... in fairness, most of what had occurred with this guy seemed impossible.

His partner said there wasn't any movement, it was just a rookie who was trigger happy. That was the official report. But interestingly enough, off duty and after a few beers, he confessed to Laurent, who passed it on to me, that something was “not quite right” about the body. He wouldn't say what. I am not sure if that's how he really felt or if he was drunk and trying to placate Laurent, who was pissed that some white kid with a badge fired a shot at an unmoving, unresponsive person and got off with a slap on the wrist.

The police didn't want word getting out about this disappearing, reappearing body. Neither did the mayor, as it wasn't good press for him. So he and the police department let our local reporters have a field day with the rookie, who ended up quitting the force and leaving town. He couldn't take the notoriety so he left. I heard he started a landscaping business with his brother in Indiana. 

The third autopsy itself was mostly normal. Aside from the absence of the typical stages of death (liver, and/or rigor mortis; putrefaction), which I dont mean to gloss over because it is very strange. Incredibly stange. It's impossible. But so is doing an autopsy on the same person three times. 

Honestly, in that situation, it was almost weirder that it was "normal." When you're expecting something to jump out at you, every minute it doesn't is agonizing. He still didn’t seem right to me, but we didn’t find any other abnormalities. I kept slicing into him and expecting something mind numbingly weird to happen. But there were no mysterious fluids. Nothing mysterious at all. There was the obvious entry and exit wound of the bullet, but nothing else of note. Which was both not strange enough and also still strange. There still weren't any obvious causes of death. He was by every measure a perfectly healthy human male.

I wondered if I had entered some sort of purgatory for mediocre medical examiners. Maybe this body was punishment for missing something, and I was doomed to repeat it until I found the cause of death. I really was questioning my career and my life choices by this point. When I went home I started talking with my wife about moving closer to her family like she’s always wanted. I don’t like her family. But a fresh start in a new town seemed like a good idea.

We were careful that time about chain of custody. The police department sent us a detail to guard the body, which mainly consisted of a guy in the basement of the hospital to watch the lockers after we left for the night. We did our thing and put the guy into cold storage. We shipped the samples to the big lab upstate. 

But of course, it did have to get weird. Like with the previous bodies, no matter how carefully we took prints, the images always looked blurred when we tried to match them in the database. Same with his dental records. The DNA samples came back inconclusive. We sent them another sample. Same results. The police don’t formally close investigations for at least a year, but we only have to hold unclaimed remains for 30 days. We kept some samples assuming there was going to be a protracted back and forth with the lab, but we sent him for cremation as soon as it was allowed. I wanted him out of my morgue. 

But you know the story by this point. A couple guys came to transport him first thing, I opened the locker to pull him out, and the body was missing. So we opened every cold locker in the storage room to make sure I hadn’t misplaced him. This time we found him. 

I wish we hadn't. 

He was... on top of someone else. They were lying together, like someone had placed them there in the mockery of a marriage bed. I cannot stress this enough, it was deeply disturbing, and I say this as someone who has seen some pretty gruesome deaths. First of all, the girl was underage. I mean if you're going to pull a prank like this I *guess* you could argue age doesn't really matter when you're talking about lifeless bodies. I dont know that that was the intent. But the image alone was… bad. I can't forget how it looked, this middle aged man with his arms wrapped around a blonde teenage girl. She looked like a child. She had overdosed. Not disfigured by an accident or anything like that. I don't think you could mistake her for a sleeping girl, but she looked peaceful enough. 

And this guy… honestly did look like he was sleeping. He just didn't look dead to me, I don't know how to describe it. I've been in this line of work a long time and I've never seen a body look like that. It looked like this grown man had crawled into bed to sleep with a dead little girl.

Aside from the grotesqueness of the scene, it was a complicated pose. His arms were wrapped around her. So parts of him were under her and parts of her were under him, if that makes sense. It would have taken significant manipulation of both bodies to get them into that position. It took me and my assistant both to get them separated.

We didn't take pictures. It was probably protocol, it being a crime scene and all, but it didn't feel right. I didn't want evidence that her parents might see in some court case someday. I didn't pick up the camera and no one asked me to.

Everyone was pretty rattled. The techs didn't like it. The on duty cop didn't like it. He liked it even less when his shift commander personally drove down to the hospital to grill him and hospital security. Had he fallen asleep? Had he been skipping out? Had he left the body alone for any length of time? He swore up and down the only times he left were to take a leak, two minutes tops. He locked the door behind him. There was no one in the basement of the building when he usually took his bathroom break around 4am.

There was, of course, nothing on the cameras overnight, but as I mentioned, the emergency exit doors in the stairwells were not monitored, as they only open from the inside. So we supposed it was in the barest realm of possibility that someone walked in the main entrance and hid out, or snuck in the side entrance one night, came downstairs to do their deed at 4am, only to escape out a side door. It seemed improbable someone could move those bodies alone, and that quickly. Maybe the police officer was lying, and in on it, and even helped the perp. But that of course begs the question: *To what end?* For the cop, or this unknown person or people. What possible motive could there be for that? They didn't steal or destroy evidence this time. It was simply bizarre. 

The shift commander was frustrated but the details didn't point to anything plausible.

The police did a very thorough investigation. They swept the whole lab for prints; there was nothing unusual. All people who had been there and were supposed to have been there, and not that many prints besides, as most of the time people wear gloves. They didn't find anything on the CCTV tapes. None of the hospital staff remembered anything unusual in the past month. 

Anyway, the techs carted the guy off and they cremated him. There was some dithering about whether to continue to hold him in light of these new events, but I think everyone was just as eager to get rid of him as I was. So he left that morning to get cremated. I followed up with one of the guys who took him, and he swore he saw John Doe go into the chamber with his own eyes. I felt relieved. He hadn't disappeared this time. Whatever this bizarre tableau was, it was over.

And yet, imagine my surprise when he showed up again. Turned up like a bad penny. 

I didn't even ask the circumstances. I was afraid to. I'll spare you the details of the autopsy, there was nothing noteworthy. Again. No cause of death could be determined. He went into a locker. I sent the samples to the lab even though I knew it was futile. Can you guess what happened after? 

Yeah. 

We lost the body again. 

Only took a couple days. This time there were eyewitnesses, though what they saw frankly raises more questions than it answers. 

An admin saw a guy in misfitting clothes and a lab coat limping barefoot out of the lobby. She said she called out to him a few times, but he ignored her. She knew he didn't work in the building, and of course the bare feet were suspicious. She was worried he was having some kind of psychiatric episode so she called security and the police. He went right out the back door.

You can see him on the security footage of the rear parking lot, just the grainy, monochrome back of his head. John Doe shuffling away from the building. The worst part for me is the clothes he's wearing. They're mine. I kept a spare set downstairs. He went through my things and he took them before he walked off.

The admin is in frame for a few seconds. She comes and stands outside, watching the man go. If you watch the tape all the way through, the cops get there, and she comes back out with security. They confer for a minute. She points them in the direction John Doe went, and they go after him. If you keep watching, a second set of cops pull up and go after the first two.

And what wasn't caught on camera was the manhunt when the first two cops didn't come back. They stopped responding to their radios shortly after entering the woods near the property line, past the parking lot. The second set of officers couldn't find them. The next day they brought in some local huntsman who are good trackers. Then they brought in dogs from a K-9 unit in another town. When both of those failed, the police enlisted able bodied volunteers, to completely scrub the whole area, square foot by square foot. The manhunt lasted about a week before they gave up hope. It was a major scandal. People were speculating all sorts of crazy things, an escaped asylum patient gone on a murderous rampage in the woods, what have you. The fact that he was a dead John Doe actually managed to get swept by the wayside. He was clearly alive in the security footage. Everyone wanted to know who he was. We never figured it out. 

The car he was found in the previous time was registered to an elderly man a few towns over, who had died of natural causes, and the car had been reported stolen by his son, who was the executor of his estate. They denied knowing John Doe, and neither of them could be proven to have any association with him. Nor did they resemble him, so the car theft didn’t seem like a personal or familial dispute. The trail was cold.

I'm ashamed to say I didn't join the search to find the missing officers. To be honest with you, and I feel guilty about this, I hoped they didn't find John Doe, missing men be damned. I couldn't bear to do another autopsy on him, and resolved to quit on the spot if they found him. And lucky or unlucky, they didn't. They never found a trace of him, nor the police officers who followed him. No blood, no sign of a struggle, not even a footstep.

It’s been many years since then. I think he's gone for good. I don't know what John Doe wanted but I guess he must have gotten it somehow. Or maybe he’s haunting some other benighted ME’s office somewhere. I'll tell you, while I like my job and I always have, I’ve hated unzipping body bags since then. I'm always half afraid it will be John Doe in there, laughing at me. My retirement is coming up soon and I’m looking forward to never having to wonder if I’ll see him again.
