When my friend Mark had invited me to go visit his family in their cabin for a weekend, I didn't hesitate. We had been close friends since college, and I'd always hear stories of his old fashioned family but I had never meet them in person. He always would mention that they lived "off-grid" and were a little "weird" but i figured those were quirks of living in a small tight-knit town. I mean he seemed pretty normal so I assumed the same of his family.

After he invited me I went and packed and we were off the next day. We had to drive almost 5 hours into the mountains near the town that we resided in. The landscape slowly became desolate -- no cell service, no other car just trees, trees and more trees. I would glance over at Mark every now and then and I could notice his getting more tense as we were nearing the cabin. "It's been awhile since I've seen them" he said, eyes  glued to the road. 

--We had made it--

The cabin wasn't what I was expecting. It was more like an old estate, a relatively big wooden house built in the middle of nowhere. I mean alarms should've definitely been ringing in my head but, I decided to give them The benefit of the doubt. Outside were a group of people, standing, waiting. All dressed in a pale shade of grey, standing in a perfect line. No smiles, No waves. 

I felt a knot start to form in my stomach.

Mark introduced me to them as his *family,* but there was something off. They didn't look alike-- I mean at ALL-- different races, skin tones, ages and features. It was more like a group of random people got together and claimed they were related. No one really spoke much just nodded and forced smiles.

One older woman --whose name I soon learned to be Ruth-- seemed to be in charge. She had cold blue eyes that never seemed to blink enough. She grabbed my should, a little to tight, when greeting me and said "We are so glad that you could join us." I got chills. Join them?

That night dinner was unsettling. No one spoke but Ruth-- who asked Mark a string of personal reasons- his health, his relationships, whether he has stayed *pure.* Mark, while staring at his plate, answered with one worded answers. Then she turned to me " Do you believe in salvation through *pain*?" I chuckled thinking it was a strange joke but the room stayed dead silent. Mark mumbled an excuse and left me alone with these people.

"You'll understand tomorrow" Ruth said.

**3:37 AM**

I woke up in the middle of the night to the faint sound of - chanting? Rhythmic chanting coming from beneath the house. Mark was no longer in the room we shared. I grabbed my oil lamp and walked out of the room. The house was pitch black, and the air felt thick, suffocating.

I followed the sound down to the basement. The door was locked, but I could hear them clearly now—voices chanting in unison, something low and guttural. My heart was pounding so loud it was echoing in my ears. What the hell was this?

I tried knocking, but no one answered. Instead, the chanting grew louder, more frantic. Suddenly, I heard a scream—a single, blood-curdling scream that echoed through the floor. I stumbled back, my heart pounding in my chest.

I ran upstairs and out the front door, but something stopped me from leaving. I don’t know why. Maybe it was Mark. Maybe I needed answers. Instead of getting in my car, I circled back, trying to find a way into the basement from the outside.

Behind the house, hidden beneath layers of vines, I found a cellar door. It creaked open easily. The air inside was damp and smelled like mildew and something metallic—blood. I stepped inside.

The basement was enormous, much bigger than I’d imagined. The chanting was louder now, echoing through the walls. I crept toward the sound, moving slowly through the dimly lit corridors. As I rounded a corner, I saw them.

Mark was there, standing in the centre of a group of people, all dressed in pale grey robes. They were positioned in a circle around him. In the middle of the circle was a symbol scratched into the ground—a large, intricate pattern of lines and symbols I couldn’t understand. The chanting stopped as soon as I stepped into the room.

Ruth turned to face me unfazed. “You weren’t supposed to see this,” she said softly,almost in a soothing way, but there was no surprise in her voice. It was like she had expected me all along.

I couldn’t move. My legs felt like they were cemented to the floor. Mark stared at me, his face blank, like he was in a trance. I tried to speak, but no words came out.

“That symbol,” Ruth continued, pointing to the pattern on the floor, “it is the key to salvation. We believe that through suffering, we cleanse our souls. Mark has come home to be purified. And now, you will join him.”

The group began chanting again, low and menacing. I tried to run, but Ruth grabbed my arm, her fingers digging into my skin with unnatural strength. “We all have our roles in the cleansing,” she hissed. “Yours is to witness.”

I don’t remember how I got out. *It was a blur.* All I know is that I ran. I ran through the woods, through the night, until I reached the road and flagged down a passing trucker. The police didn’t believe me—there was no sign of anything in the house when they went back the next morning. No basement. No chanting. No symbols. And no Mark.

I’ve spent months trying to find him, but it’s like he never existed. His phone’s disconnected, his social media accounts are gone, and his apartment is empty. I even went back to the cabin, but it’s abandoned now, decaying and overgrown, as if no one had lived there for years.

The police told me it was a hallucination, that I must have imagined it all. But I know what I saw. I know what I heard.
