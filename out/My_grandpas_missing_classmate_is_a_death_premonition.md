Brace yourselves, folks. This is a long and a weird one.

When I was 8 years old I was at my grandparents house for a sleepover. I got dropped off, went to the park with them, came home, ate dinner and went to bed. Just like any kid would.

My grandpa woke me up in the middle of the night, frantically and sounding like he was tearing up, and told me to hide under the bed. I tried but I couldn’t fit, which made him panic more. He made me hide in the bathroom with the door locked.

The way he was talking made me nervous and I did so, but first I asked why. He told me it was too complicated, made sure I went under the bed, and left.

I’d never seen him like that, it scared me. And I’ve not heard him talk the way he did then since, nearly a decade later. Still, I’d mostly forgotten about it up until last week, when I visited my grandpa and he told me this story.

Now, this was Hungary in 1959. 4 years after the revolution, and the Warsaw Pact was well and truly in effect. As I’m sure you can guess, the soviets were pretty damn relevant. And for where my grandpa lived - pretty close to what is now the Ukrainian border - the soviets were even more prolific.

Well. This kid in my grandpa’s class - Bálász. I’m not sure how much I should say his name, in case it’s a Bloody Mary type of thing. Anyway, he was as introverted as they come. 

In the time my grandpa had known him, he’d only heard him talk to someone who wasn’t the teacher a couple of times. He just sat in the corner and read, kept to himself and didn’t join in with any of the games the other kids were playing. 

He personally had no problems with the kid, but a lot of his friends did. They picked on him a lot cos he was an easy target. 

My grandpa told me that somewhere between September and December 1959 the kid just.. disappeared. Vanished completely. But the weird thing was, he was the only one who noticed. Nobody else seemed to care, not his friends, not even his teachers.

For a 9 year old kid to just disappear like that.. for sure it was weird. He told me it felt like he’d never existed in the first place. My grandpa presumed it was something related to the soviets, and you didn’t fuck with those guys.

Fast forward 10 years. My grandpa is now 20 years old, and he’s out in town with some of his friends. While in a bar together, completely smashed, he saw someone across the street waiting for a bus. And it looked identical to the kid who went missing, just a grown up version. 

He pointed it out to his friends, but even if they could see that far in their state, they wouldn’t have seen him before he got on the bus and left. When they eventually got kicked out of the bar, one of his friends got that same bus back home. Grandpa was going to take the bus with him, but his then girlfriend came to pick him up instead.

My grandpa woke up the next morning and heard the news. The bus had careened over a bridge, killing everyone on board, a few minutes after his friend had got on. Everyone mourned his death, including grandpa obviously, but nobody even mentioned foul play, and the crash was deemed an accident.

In 1983, my grandpa was living in Budapest working his last few days as a train conductor. He was preparing to set off to Debrecen, when he looks out of the train window and sees someone waiting at the station. It’s the same kid, now a grown man, sat on a bench reading. 

My grandpa keeps his eyes on him and thinks back to what happened nearly 15 years before. He leaves the train and starts to walk in his direction. Before he can get there, he hears a woman scream and loads of people start to gather round.

One of his coworkers had fallen off of the station and onto the tracks, right in front of a moving train. He wasn’t pushed, wasn’t forced off. He just tripped, lost his footing and fell. And with the train coming, he didn’t have a chance.

My grandpa was good friends with the guy, and still speaks fondly of him even now. He looked over to his station, and the guy was gone. His book was still on the bench.

My grandpa was freaked out about it. That was two times where he’s seen someone who looks identical to his old missing classmate, and both times have resulted in one of his friends’ untimely death. Luckily for him, he wasn’t staying in Hungary for long.

He’d met someone in Wales, and was setting off to live with her in a few weeks. Before he left the country, he asked some of his friends if they remembered the kid. And none of them, not a single one, remembered.

1997. My grandpa was living in Wales with my grandma and mum, who was 12. The three of them were ready to fly to Spain during school holidays. When they woke up the morning of the flight, grandma was struggling to breathe. They had to miss the flight to take her to hospital. In the hospital, there were two other people in the waiting room. An older woman, and a homeless looking man. 

He was laying across 3 chairs asleep, and grandpa paid him no mind until he sat up, then he realised. He resembled the same guy, except he had long messy hair and was covered in dirt. He was also really pale, and the bottom of his face covered by a scarf.

While mum and grandpa were in the hospital with grandma, they saw on the news that the plane they were set to fly to Spain - Preussag AG Flight 53 - had gone down near Cádiz, hundreds of miles off course. They learned days later that nobody survived. 

3 situations where grandpa could have died easily, each taking place not long after seeing someone that resembled the kid, Bálász. 

And by this point, poor grandpa felt like he was teetering on the edge of insanity. For years, he scanned everyone as they walked down the street, and even now he keeps his eyes peeled in large crowds of people in fear of that guy, the premonition of someone’s death. 

You might ask me: why do I believe him? Well, not only do I fully believe him, I’m fucking terrified by it. Why is that?

On the day I went to that sleepover, and I went to the park. I played there for a little while before it started to rain and we went back home. Before we left, my grandpa looked back to where he was sat to see if we left anything.

When he turned he saw him, sat on the same bench he was sat on, reading. I kept walking but my grandpa stayed, and kept his eyes on him. Even as the rain got heavier, the guy just stayed there without a coat or an umbrella or anything.

My grandpa didn’t leave my side for the rest of that day. At the time I paid no mind to it, but now looking back I realise why: he was doing it to make sure nothing happened to me. 

That night when he came in my room, he had heard a knock at the door. He checked the peephole, and saw him across the street. He didn’t answer the door, instead he hurried upstairs to me and told me to hide.

The next day there was a knock at the door. It was my grandparents’ neighbour. She was looking for her son, whom I’d been playing with at the park the day before. 

He still hasn’t turned up. And just last night I saw someone who looked a lot like him in the supermarket.

So I guess surviving a national revolution is generational, but getting haunted by missing people? Must be a hereditary thing.
