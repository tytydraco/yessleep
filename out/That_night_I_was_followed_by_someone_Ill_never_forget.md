When I was 15, tired of staying at home, I decided to go for a walk. At that moment, I had no idea it would turn out to be the most creepy and terrifying day of my life. All my friends were busy, so I went alone. I didn’t usually walk alone, but that day something seemed to push me to do it.

I immediately decided on the route I would take. I often do this because I don’t like wandering without a purpose. That day, my goal was just to walk around. It’s important to mention that it was evening, approaching night.

As I walked, the streets gradually emptied. About 20 minutes later, I reached a familiar part of the neighborhood. After walking around there, it was already dark, and there was not a single person on the streets.

While returning home, I unexpectedly ran into my teacher’s mother. We talked for about five minutes. She warned me that the area was not safe at night and insisted I wait for her son, who would soon go out and take the same route. I politely declined and continued on my way. I wasn’t afraid of the dark or unsafe neighborhoods.

After walking a short distance, I turned a corner, and suddenly an older woman, quite short, appeared. She started following my exact path. When I slowed down, she slowed down. When I sped up, she sped up.

I finally dared to look at her face. She was dressed completely in black, and her wrinkled face filled me with an intense, paralyzing fear. My heart raced, and I immediately increased my pace.

It’s important to clarify that, as I mentioned, there were no people on the street. But the road nearby had a main highway with quite a lot of cars. I had to go to a pedestrian path and descend a slope to cross the highway.

As we approached the path, I decided not to look back and just run through the underpass, climb up, and get home. I ran down the slope, and glancing back one last time, I saw her standing still, just staring at me. After passing through the underpass and climbing back up, I froze. She was right there in front of me, wearing the same black clothes, with the same terrifying face.

I sprinted the rest of the way home without looking back. On the way, I met a classmate, told him everything that had just happened, and we ran home.

I saw her a few more times after that, but I cannot say for sure it was the same woman. That day, however, I can guarantee that I saw that face.

I’ve experienced many scary situations in my life, but nothing compared to that night. Logically, she couldn’t have passed through the underpass faster than me — I’m physically faster. I also saw and heard that the underpass was not large. You might think maybe she ran across the highway, but that seems unlikely since I was faster and there were many speeding cars. Maybe it was her twin sister, but it seems strange to wear the same clothes. I’m even more certain because both had a gold tooth in the same place. I really don’t know what it could have been.

My friends said maybe I imagined it, or that it was just something that happened. But even two years later, I still cannot forget that day and her face.
