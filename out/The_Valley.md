I lean against the unfinished wood railing of the balcony, blowing out cigarette smoke and observing the forest below. As I roll them back and forth, my elbows can feel the hills and valleys of the wood through my flannel sleeves. The lights fixed around the perimeter of the tower shine down below, mixing with the moonlight beaming down from the cloudy night sky. I can feel some of my hair brush along my forehead as it’s being gently flurried by the late September breeze, which I can feel getting crisper by the day.   

I begin to make my way back around the balcony to go inside and do my nightly report before heading to bed. I gather the necessary information and log it into the computer.  

Date: **9-27-23**  
Time: **11:37 P.M.**  
Temperature: **55.2℉**  
Wind Speed: **18 Knots**  
Weather: **Cloudy**  
Hikers Assisted: **7** (\*Note: There was one lone hiker that seemed off to me. I know this sounds weird, but it was something about the way they walked. They didn’t have any gear or water or anything either. Just themself. Remind me to fill out a report next time I’m at the office.)   
Name: **Lee**  
Tower #: **5**  

I start to drift off to sleep quickly as I had been woken up early this morning by the static and beeping of my radio. It was another lookout from the next tower over asking if I could bring some of my wood since they were running low. We both thought this was odd since they had just had a sufficient amount, and campers aren’t allowed at this time so the chances of someone stealing it was very low. My bed feels extra comfortable and warm tonight, probably due to the extent of my tiredness. I’m usually a pretty heavy sleeper, save when someone tries to call over the radio, but something else wakes me up tonight. It’s the sound of someone talking loudly. My eyes burn as I fight unconsciousness to open them and look at the time.   

**3:34 A.M.**  

Who could possibly be walking through a forest at three in the morning? Hikers shouldn’t have been able to get in, and another lookout wouldn’t be making this much noise unless they were in trouble. As I wake up more and my mind becomes more clear, I can tell that it isn’t a voice I recognize, but they do sound… scared? They still sound a small distance away. Maybe like 50 yards? I think I can make out what they’re saying.  

**HELP**  
**HELLO**  

I would say a chill goes through my whole body, but it’s more like an electric shock that makes me jolt up. As I sit up, the feeling of the rug under my feet exposes my vulnerability and I quickly slip on my shoes, not even bothering to lace them. I stand up and look out my one unshuttered window to try and see where it’s coming from. Is it another lookout? Why would they be wandering around this late? Why didn’t they radio to let someone know what they were doing? Why are they yelling for help? Did a hiker somehow get lost deep enough that no one found them until now? How far would they have had to have gone for that to even happen?   

It sounds like they’re getting closer to my tower. They’re still yelling, but I can tell now that something sounds weird about it. Are they smiling? I can still hear the urgency of their words, but it almost feels fake now as it sounds like they aren’t able to properly enunciate. Like when someone is smiling so hard that their mouth isn’t able to form the correct shape to say certain words. I’m shivering from a combination of fear and the cold as I see a figure pass through the border of darkness and into the light about a dozen feet from the bottom of my tower. My instinct to stay is anchoring my feet to the floor, but I can’t just leave someone wandering around if they really do need help.  

I grab bear spray, a pocket knife, and my flashlight and slowly open my door, begging it not to creak. I take a deep, shaky breath as I step out onto the balcony. The calm I felt earlier as I stood out here with my cigarette feels like a dream in contrast to the terror I’m feeling in this moment. I creep closer to the railing at the top of the stairs. I can see them begin to move in front of the tower, but I can’t see their face from this high up. Something is weird about the way they’re walking. Their legs are moving like they’re speed walking, but their body isn’t moving up and down like it usually does when someone walks. It’s smooth, like they’re gliding. I’ve seen this before. The suspicious hiker I saw the day before. Could it be the same person? Why are they still here?  

Why aren’t they stopping to get help? There’s absolutely no way they don’t see a giant tower surrounded by lights right next to them. I take another step closer to kneel down and look through the railing while hiding behind it. I grab onto a post and adjust my foot as I’m crouching down, but it slips over the top platform onto the first step. Just as they pass back into the darkness, they hear me and stop walking mid yell.  

**HE-**  

I can see their body turn around to face the tower. I feel all the blood and color drain from my face. A wave of warmth and sweat washes over me counteracting the chill from before. I feel caught, like I’m the one under the spotlights they just passed through. I don’t know what to do, so I stand up.  

“Hello?” I try to sound assertive, but the fear strips the power from my voice. They give no answer. My feet feel like anvils as I force my way down the first few steps.  

“Are you okay? How did you get here?” Still no answer.  

I debate if I should keep going down the stairs or go back up and radio another lookout. What if they’re gone by the time I’m able to contact someone? They don’t seem fully coherent, so I wouldn’t be surprised if they kept moving. They have the same opportunity with the amount of stairs I have left to go down, but I decide to take my chances.   

“Stay where you are.” I turn my flashlight on and descend the stairs as quickly as I can while trying to keep an eye on the person’s silhouette.   

I reach the ground, wishing I was still asleep in my bed. As I round the corner I point the flashlight on the ground in front of me to see where I’m going and try not to trip on my shoelaces. With the bear spray in my other hand, my chin trembles as I take another deep breath. I get closer and the light from my flashlight reaches their feet.   

“Hello?”   

I finally get close enough that I no longer have to use my flashlight to see where I’m going. I lift it to point the light at them. As the light begins to pass over them I hear shuffling and see them quickly turning around. They move with such urgency that I still can’t see their face. With their back facing me, I’m hoping they aren’t hiding any weapons. I have my finger ready on the bear spray.   

“Hello?” I say again, but this time with more frustration, like when you get no answer on the other side of the phone and have to say “hello” for a third time.  

**Hi! :)**  

I jump a little bit and take a step back, the electric shock feeling striking my body once again. There was an absolute enthusiasm in their voice that felt entirely out of place and inappropriate given the situation. I’m sure now that they’re definitely smiling. The kind of smile where it’s so big it makes your cheeks sore. No longer shouting, their voice was deep and airy, almost like it was being forced. The lack of distress in their voice furthered my suspicion that they aren’t fully coherent, but it also made me feel sick. Did they actually need help? Were they just trying to get me out here to kill me? My heart felt like it was about to explode and the cold air couldn’t break through the barrier of fear around me as sweat dripped down my forehead.  

“Who are you?” I ask, keeping my distance.  

**Just heading home :)**  

I can feel the smile in my ears. They aren’t talking normally either. They speak in a cadence as if to the tune of a song, putting emphasis on all the wrong parts of the words.  

“Why are you still here?”  

**I got lost just heading home :)**   

“Are you still lost?” They’re still turned away.  

**No, I know this place :)**  

“You mean you know where you are now? Are you sure? I just heard you yelling not far back.”  

**I know  I can make it now :)**  

I can’t tell if that was one sentence or two.   

“You know where you are or you know I heard you?”  

**:)**  

“...Do you still need help?”   

**I can make it now :)**  

“I know there’s a parking lot nearby, but are you sure you don’t need like a flashlight or anything?”  

**:)**  

“If you need anything along the way, just stop at one of the towers. I’ll stay awake for a little while just in case and try to radio another lookout.”  

**No. I can make it now :)**  

“Um…okay…good luck.”  

**:)**  

I begin to back away in the direction of my tower, keeping the flashlight pointed at them. They still haven’t moved and I’m keeping focused on them, but I almost fall backwards after one of my shoelaces gets caught under my foot. Of course. I instinctively look down and hold my arms out to catch my balance, moving the flashlight away from them. As soon as I look away I hear shuffling and them breathing quickly and grunting. Panting?   

I point the flashlight back to see them crawling on all fours in the other direction. Electric shock. Every part of me is screaming to turn around and run, but I’m frozen in place for what feels like an hour. I break out of the trance and start moving towards the tower stairs, but it feels like I’m moving through quicksand. As I make my way up the stairs the anvils that are my feet seem to double in weight. The combination of the blood having drained from my face, the cold, the sweat, and the newfound pounding in my head makes me feel like I may pass out. I’m determined to get inside and lock the door. I think they’re coming back, as I begin to hear them again, but I don’t dare turn around.   

I make it inside and slam the door, locking both the doorknob and the deadbolt. Luckily, I closed all the shutters before going to bed so there’s no windows for them to look in… except the one behind the radio. I can hear them clobbering their way up the stairs so I don’t take my chances with the radio. I grab the walkie talkie from the table and hide under the bed. I grab whatever I can from the floor and move it in front of me to try and hide myself. I turn the volume down on the radio as I try to call to another tower without being too loud. I can hear banging at the door and no one’s answering the radio. The wave of feelings becomes too much and my body succumbs to its urge to pass out.  

I don’t know how long it’s been, but I’m woken up by yelling. Deja vu.  

**HELLO :)**  

It’s coming from outside the door, but it sounds like it’s at the same level as me. Are they still on all fours? I slowly make my way out from underneath the bed as quietly as possible. I slink over to the door and lift the lowest blind as little as possible while still being able to see through. I should see their torso from where the window is, but instead I see… legs? Are they doing a handstand? I look through the side of the blinds to see the ground beneath them. They’re not doing a handstand. They’re standing on their head. Their hands at their sides, pointed up. I back away completely consumed with fear and unsure of what to do next. The door jumps from being hit. They’re kicking it.  

**HELP :)**
