I'm writing this here because I don't know what else to do.

Let me start from the start. I lived with my two roommates, Carmen and James, in a typical millennial grey apartment off-campus. The three of us shared a fridge, and space was pretty tight, but we'd worked out as good system to avoid disagreements—ensuring that each of us had our own shelf, and anything in other areas of the fridge was labelled.

Carmen and James had been living in the apartment for a semester prior to me moving in, and while I was worried initially that the two of them might be cliquey, they were very welcoming. Both of them were straight-talking and adult without being rude or blunt, which was so refreshing after my experiences with some terrible roommates in places I'd lived before.

Everything was going smoothly—no moldy food, leftovers kept on our personal shelves, and boundaries respected. That was until the morning I opened the fridge, bleary-eyed and looking for coffee creamer, and found a weird jar on my shelf. 

What looked like gnarled roots were suspended in cloudy liquid that swirled as I examined the jar in my hand. The jar was old-fashioned, sealed with a two-part canning lid that seemed stuck tight. I'd never seen Carmen or James have anything like in the fridge this before, and in my mind I groped around for rationale as to how this could have showed up. As I struggled to open the lid, it finally loosened, not with the fresh *pop* of a sterile jar, but with the gritty sensation of corroded metal loosening its grip on rust. This jar looked like it had been here for years. I quickly screwed it shut again, not wanting to experience the smell of what was inside.

My fingers ran over something that felt like paper on the bottom of the jar. I checked that the lid was on tight before turning over the jar. There, on the base, was a dog-eared label with words written in old-fashioned cursive: *"To bind".*

“Did either of you buy this?” I asked Carmen and James, but they both said no, barely paying attention. “If someone’s messing with me, just stop. It’s not funny,” I told them both, but neither of them took responsibility. It was too early to argue, so I shrugged and threw the whole jar in the trash. 

The next week or so, nothing else weird happened, and I started to forget about the jar that had shown up in the fridge. That was until the morning that James yelled my name from across the house.

*"EMMA!"* he shouted, and I immediately jumped up and headed downstairs to see what the matter was. It wasn't like him to randomly yell for me, and I could tell by his tone that something was wrong.

James was stood by the fridge, his face twisted into an expression of disgust. "Emma, what the fuck is this?", he shouted, as he opened the door.

I jumped back as he revealed the fridge was crawling with maggots. Their pale, segmented bodies were pulsing in sick rhythm as they wriggled up the inside walls of the fridge, each one swollen with a glistening sheen. In the center of the fridge was a mass of maggots in writhing clusters, and I realized with horror that they were concentrated around my box of leftover pizza—the pizza I'd ordered just the night before. 

"Emma, answer me! What the fuck is this?"

I was frozen with disgust, and my voice sounded stuttery and weak. "I don't know, James... this has nothing to do with me, I swear!"

"Then why the fuck are they coming from your pizza box?"

I recoiled as James grabbed my box of pizza, seemingly so full of anger and adrenaline that he didn't care about the maggots crawling all over it, which scattered to the floor around our feet. The air puffed with spores that made me cough as he opened the lid, the once-cheesy slices nearly unrecognizable—swollen with mold, shades of green, black, and white spreading across the surface in fuzzy patches. Some spots seemed slick and slimy, others looked almost bubbly. Amid the rotting mess, maggots swarmed over each slice, their pale bodies weaving in and out of the gooey, decomposing crust. The air was filled with the dense, sour stench of decay and whispery, wet squelching of their bodies sliding against each other.

The sight of the decay inside the box was so shocking that I almost didn't notice the message on the inside of the lid, scrawled in harsh, capital letters: *"ENJOY WHILE IT LASTS".*

James tilted the box to look at the message. "What does this mean, Emma?"

"I don't know! The pizza was fresh, that message wasn't there last night..."

"So you're saying that me or Carmen must have done this? Why the fuck would we want to nuke our own fridge with maggots?"

"No, that's not what I'm saying! This is so fucked up..."

James' eyes were full of a hard rage that I hadn't seen before, and I was almost as scared of him as I was of the maggots. "I don't even want to *hear* how this happened. It's your mess, clean it up, and you need to replace all of our food that's been ruined by this. This is unbelievable Emma, I really thought we could trust you." He threw the pizza box on the counter and stormed from the room.

I cleaned it all up, filling up trash bags while crying with frustration and fear. I was so confused—there had been no hint of any decay when I'd eaten the pizza last night, and I'd simply thrown the leftovers in the fridge thinking I'd eat them later today. I didn't have the money to buy an entire fridge's worth of food for three people, and I was sick with worry that my living situation was descending into the same mess of hostility that I'd experienced before.

I spent about an hour on my knees in my rubber gloves, scooping up handfuls of maggots and dumping them in boiling water to kill them, then scrubbing the fridge with bleach. Neither James nor Carmen mentioned the incident to me again, although both of them had noticeably cooled towards me, and I spent as much time in my room as I could to avoid any awkward confrontations. Each time I opened the fridge, I braced myself, terrified that something else would appear. 

And I was right to be afraid, because a few nights later, it happened again.

I opened the fridge to grab a snack, only to find a plate on my shelf, front and center. On it was a slice of cake sat upright with a candle on the top, as if ready to present to a birthday girl. But the cake was old-looking, sagging and sunken. It looked kind of familiar—frosting a sickly shade of green, surrounded by hardened crumbs, and speckled with confetti-like sprinkles. My stomach dropped as I noticed the letters scrawled across the top in smeared icing. The first few letters of my name. *EMM…* 

It was unmistakably the same cake from my tenth birthday. I remembered that the frosting was a hideous shade of green because my mom had added too much food coloring. How could a slice of it be here, now, almost a decade later?

“Emma?” Carmen’s voice cut sharply through my thoughts, and I jumped. She was standing in the doorway, arms crossed. I felt like I'd been caught red-handed, guilty of some crime I had no part in, and I tried to use my body to block the cake. But the look in my eyes must have told her that there was something wrong. 

“What now?” she asked, walking over to the fridge and peering over my shoulder. Her eyes widened as she spotted the plate, and her mouth curled in disdain. “You can’t seriously expect us to believe this isn’t yours.”

“What? No, I—” I stammered, trying to find the right words, but she cut me off.

“James told me about the maggots, and now this? A slice of rotten cake with *your* name on it?” Her eyes were cold and sharp with accusation. “I don’t know what kind of game you’re playing, Emma, but it’s sick.”

“I swear, Carmen, I didn’t put this here!” I said, my voice filled with desperation. “I have no idea how any of this is happening!”

She snorted, folding her arms tighter. “You’re telling me that a weird cake with your name on it just magically appeared in our fridge? Do you even hear how insane that sounds?”

“I know how it sounds,” I whispered. My voice was brittle with shame. “But I’m not doing this. I haven’t done any of it.”

Carmen shook her head. Her face with was filled with disappointment, her eyes wrinkled with disgust, like she was contemplating a stranger doing something unsanitary. I'd hoped that some fragile trust was still there, but each syllable she spoke tore it down. “We were actually happy when you moved in. We thought you’d be different. But you’ve brought nothing but weirdness into our home. First the maggots, and now this? James and shouldn't have to live with constant gross surprises in the fridge.”

“Carmen, please. You have to believe me.”

“I don’t have to do anything,” she snapped. “We’re going to have to reconsider this whole living arrangement.”

Later that night I lay in bed, unable to sleep, replaying the argument with Carmen over and over in my head. I felt like I was going crazy, but I knew I wasn't responsible for this. Every other area of my life was healthy and happy. All I could think, unlikely as it seemed, was that James or Carmen were playing a trick on me. I didn't feel safe, I couldn't face a confrontation with them, and even if I could, our relationship would be forever tainted by what had happened.

I needed to talk to someone who might have an outside perspective on all this. I picked up my phone and called my mom.

“Hi, sweetheart!” She sounded cheerful at first, but her tone shifted when she heard the strain in my voice. “Emma? Is everything okay?”

I hesitated, unsure how to even begin, but eventually, the whole story spilled out. I told her about the maggots, the old cake with my name on it, and the jar of roots with the faded label.

She was silent for a moment. “A jar of roots? Are you sure that’s what it was?”

“Yes,” I replied. “It looked ancient, like it had been in the fridge for decades. And on the bottom, there was a label. It said, 'To bind.' Do you know what that could mean?”

There was a long pause before my mom spoke again, and when she did, her voice was hushed, threaded with a fear I’d never heard before. “Emma… there’s something I haven’t told you about our family. I thought… well, I hoped it would never be necessary. But hearing this, it sounds like…” She trailed off, and I felt her weighing the words she spoke next. “It sounds like an old ritual your great-grandmother once used. She was known to keep jars of herbs and roots, things meant to ‘bind’ or protect the family from harm.”

A chill ran through me. “Bind us from what, exactly?”

“I don’t know all the details,” she admitted, a soft tremble in her voice. “But I do know that these ‘bindings’ were meant to keep something at bay, to trap it or hold it back from affecting us. Emma, you didn't open the jar, did you?"

I felt my skin prickle, goosebumps raising as a wave of cold washed over me. "Not completely, Mom... what if I did?"

A shaky breath escaped her, like she was trying to steady herself. “Honestly, I don’t know. I never believed much in the family stories, thought they were just superstitions. But I remember the jars and how your great-grandmother would never let anyone open them. She told me, ‘Never break the seal on a binding jar; otherwise, what’s inside might come for us.’”

Fuck. A thick silence settled between us as I processed her words, feeling like I'd unearthed a family secret that should have stayed buried. This couldn't be real... surely there was no such thing as witchcraft, or spirits? But as I cast my mind back to the stale cake and the writhing maggots, it all seemed way too weird to have any type of a rational explanation.

"Mom," I finally whispered, "what if I come stay with you for a while? I need to get away from all of this."

"Of course, sweetheart. Come home. We'll sort this out together." She had the practiced steadiness in her voice of every parent that talks of Santa, tells you that pets go to a "farm", or assures you that everything will be alright.

I packed my things the next day, shoving everything into my bags hurriedly without any type of organization. I explained to Carmen and James that I'd pay the rent until my notice period was up, but I'd be leaving that day. They barely looked at me as I left, and I didn’t say goodbye. I couldn’t blame them after everything that had happened, but it still hurt. A strange loneliness crept over me as I left the apartment and headed back to my childhood home.

When my mom greeted me at the door, I melted into her warm hug, feeling the weight of the past few days begin to ease, just slightly. That night we spent the evening watching crappy romance shows on Netflix, talking about anything but what had happened.

It was early the next morning when I went to the kitchen, still groggy with sleep. My mom was already up, sitting at the kitchen table with a cup of black coffee. "Morning," she said with a tentative smile.

There was some kind of current in the air, a chill that seemed like more than a draught. I think, deep down, I knew then that something was wrong. But I tried to pretend it was another normal morning, that I'd open the fridge door, grab some orange juice, and everything would be fine.

But pretending was useless.

It took me a moment to process what was inside the fridge. In front of me sprawled a massive, raw organ, fleshy and grotesque, throbbing and twitching with life. Its surface was a tangled mess of bulging veins and thick, sinewy fibers, each strand shining with wetness. The swollen blood vessels twisted over it like bloated worms, their contents sloshing with each faint throb. It sat in a thick pool of viscous, nearly black blood that dripped lazily off the shelf and splattered onto the floor with wet, sticky slaps. The coppery, metallic stench coated the insides of my nostrils, so thick and rancid it felt like it was crawling down my throat, filling me with a nausea that clawed its way up from my gut.

I stumbled back, gagging and clamping my hand over my mouth. This thing—it looked like a nightmare pulled from the depths of some twisted horror, something so wrong and obscene it felt like the air itself recoiled around it. This was something that had no place in any fridge, let alone my mom's.

On the shelf below, obscured by the shadow cast by the huge organ, another jar caught the faint glint of the fridge light. It was nearly identical to the one I’d found in the apartment—a murky jar filled with dark, viscous liquid and tangled, gnarled roots. 

But there was something different about this jar. A faded label clung to the side, the same spidery cursive as before spelling out the words: *“To Unbind.”*

I only realized my mom was by me when her shaking hands clasped my arm. Her face was completely pale. “Emma… this jar… this shouldn’t be here.”

I didn't want to believe this was happening, and it took so much effort to face the situation, not to run, screaming. But I wanted to be strong for my mom. “What do you mean? ‘To Unbind’? Is this… the thing I let out?”

Before she could answer, a strange, low noise filled the kitchen, like something huge exhaling. The air filled with a whispering, crackling sound, like the rustling of dry leaves, and underneath, a cracking noise like something brittle breaking. It was suddenly so cold, so damp even inside the room, like the air in the middle of a forest in a rainstorm.

I couldn't move. My eyes were fixed on the jar as the roots inside it started to twitch. At first I thought it was a trick of my eyes, a glimpse of a reflection moving. But then, unmistakably, they started to coil around each other, gripping and undulating like a nest of snakes.

My mom’s hand gripping my arm tighter seemed so small and fragile. “Emma… shut the fridge. Don’t touch it. We need to—”

But it was too late. The jar's lid spun round, loosening with a grinding *crick*, then a loud *hiss* as the lid popped off, filling the kitchen with the sour, sharp smell of decay. The dark liquid in the jar overflowed as the roots began to uncoil, slowly creeping out of the jar like blackened fingers reaching out for us...

My mom backed away. Her voice was filled with terror and urgency. “Emma, get away from it!”

I staggered back, so scared but unable to look away, as the roots began to slither out of the jar, squirming and stretching like the probing limbs of a hungry parasite. They crept out of the fridge with a slow, sickening purpose, inching toward us, each twisted tendril writhing and extending like the grasping arms of something pulled from a nightmare.

Then, with a stabbing jerk, the roots shot forward, wrapping themselves around my mom’s ankle. She let out a primal cry of shock and surprise that twisted the deepest parts of me as the roots tightened and pulled her back, and she fell to the ground with a sickening, dense crack as her head hit the tile floor. Blood ran down from her hairline, her eyes glassed over in shock as she whimpered with pain. I realized then what the roots were trying to do... they were trying to pull her towards the fridge.

“Mom!” I shrieked, grabbing her arms and pulling with all my strength, but the roots were relentless, tightening their hold the more that I pulled her away. The roots were throbbing as if something dark and alive coursed through them, and I could feel their strength, unnatural and monstrous. They were tied around her ankle like a ligature, and the skin underneath was raw and red, bruises blooming purple beneath their grip.

“Emma… it’s… feeding…” she gasped, her voice rasping and breathy with pain. I clung to her, pulling desperately, my hands gripping so tightly I no longer cared if it hurt her. My vision blurred with tears, panic filling every part of me as I choked on my own sobs. The roots felt stronger with every second, as if they were draining her life, and I knew I couldn’t hold out much longer…

There, at the edge of the kitchen table, I spotted a butter knife. It wasn’t much, but it would have to do. Keeping one arm wrapped around her, I reached out with shaking fingers, grabbing the knife and gripping it hard, my fingernails cutting into my palm. With all the strength I had left, I brought it down on the roots, slashing wildly and screaming like I was possessed.

The dull blade barely pierced the thick, fibrous surface of the roots, but still I hacked and sawed. My teeth were gritted tight as the knife slipped and skidded against the sinewy mass, tearing jagged gouges in the roots. 

But despite my ineffective weapon, it seemed like it was working—every wound gushed with black fluid, and the roots shuddered under the assault. They started twisting violently as if in pain, splattering my face with sticky black droplets, tasting like tar and decay. The roots recoiled from every jagged hack I laid into them, writhing and convulsing, the dark liquid making a mess of glossy smears across the tiles.

As they started to loosen I felt a wave of giddy disbelief wash over me, the same way that prey must feel escaping a predator. And suddenly, they retreated, and I pulled my mom free, dragging her back from the fridge as we collapsed together onto the floor. We were both covered in the smeared black liquid, but I couldn't feel anything but relief as we held each other, gasping, watching as the roots inched back into the jar. Meters of roots compressed themselves into a small, tight mass as they slithered back inside. The last root, in a way that was weirdly human, retrieved the lid and placed it back on top of the jar, which sealed back up with a soft *pop*.

The room was still and silent as if they had never moved at all, while my world had changed so completely.

My mom was so pale, and she could barely speak through her own sobs. “Emma… we need to bury it. Far away. Where it can’t find us again.”

"But what if it just comes back, Mom? What if what's in there doesn't let go that easily?"

My mom didn't answer.

I'm sitting at the kitchen table now, writing this up. I cleaned up the mess in the kitchen, cleaned the tarry fluid from off my skin. My mom's ankle is hurt, but okay.

But I don't know what to do with the jar in the fridge. Will it come back if we bury it? Will it burn if we set fire to it? Do we need a priest? What if whatever we do to make it go away makes it come back stronger, and angrier?

I know this isn't the end of this story. This is only a pause. The thing that's bound me isn't done—it's just biding its time.
