Have you noticed things lately—like people surviving stuff they absolutely shouldn’t, or how hospitals are full but the morgues are empty—I think you deserve to know the truth.



It started with my sister. She wasn’t the first person to die in my life, but it was the first time I didn’t want to let go.



Eve.

That was her name. Eleven years old. Hair like corn silk and a laugh that made everything feel less like a cage. She was hit by a car. Not just hit—run down. The guy behind the wheel? Local real estate developer. Rich. Connected. His bumper streaked in blood, her little bike stuck in the grille like some twisted hood ornament.



He got six months house arrest.



They said it was an accident.



After the funeral, something hollow opened up in me. You know that feeling when you fall in a dream and your stomach drops, but it never ends? That was me. Every minute. Every hour. Every sunrise was a fresh cut, a reminder that the world kept turning while I was stuck in that freefall.



I couldn’t sleep. Couldn’t cry. I just... searched. I started looking for ways to keep her. The internet, mostly. Looking for anything that might tell me what happens after you die. At first, it was grief forums. Then weird subreddits. Then deeper. Occult archives, scanned pages from books long out of print. The further I delved, the colder my apartment felt, like the pages themselves sucked the warmth out of the air. But I couldn't stop. I had to find a way. I started seeing the same phrase pop up over and over:



“Death is not a force. Death is a being.”

Some called it the Pale Man. Others, the Quiet Guest. One page called it Kalmoste, which loosely translated to “the One Who Waits at the Threshold.” Most sources said summoning it was impossible. A few said it was dangerous.



I went to the basement. It starts with a circle - I had wanted to be fancy and use that himalayan pink salt, but settled for a box of table salt. The coarse granules grated on the concrete floor as they poured from the box, a whisper of grit that sounded deafening in the silent house. Then I propped a mirror on the wall. The cheap, wavy glass of the basement mirror seemed to warp, pulling the dim light into its depths, until it was nothing but an infinite, swirling void. I stood in the center of the circle and cut my palm. The sting on my palm was sharp, but the metallic tang of my own blood in the air was sharper, a primal invitation I hadn't realized I was making.Then said the name. I had one moment—one unblinking moment—where I could look into the dark of the mirror, and see something looking back. It wasn’t cloaked like in movies. It was just a figure. Human-shaped, but like it was made of smoke almost. Tall. Skin the color of an overcast sky. No eyes—just pits. And the smell that came with it? Like dried flowers and rotting fruit.



It stepped out, then looked at me … maybe in consideration? But probably more in contempt. A ripple, like heat rising from asphalt, passed through its form as it regarded me, a silent, ancient judgment that promised no mercy. And then it turned away. I asked it to wait. I asked it to take me instead. “I want a trade,” I said.



Still silent. Death does not barter.



It smiled. Not with its mouth—with its whole face. That’s when I threw the chain.



It was iron, inscribed with the words from the site. Dipped in her blood (don’t ask). The chain hit its arm and it recoiled—like it hurt. It moved with a terrifying grace, a wisp of shadow trying to retreat into the glass, but the chain, impossibly, bit into its arm, and a soundless tremor ran through its form. It tried to step back through the mirror but the circle held it in place. I latched the chain to the concrete wall.



I added the second chain. Then the third.



And then, it just... sat. Cross-legged. Watching me.



“You can’t leave,” I demanded. “You can’t take anyone until I say.”



And it nodded. Just once.



Things changed after that.



At first, it was small. Local headlines. “Woman survives freak lightning strike.” “Man walks away from 12-car pileup.” That kind of thing.



People got lucky.



Too lucky.



No one died in our town for twelve straight days.



A man fell off a construction site in town—five stories. Shattered his body like glass. But he’s still alive, moaning in some ICU bed. A woman OD’d behind the gas station. No pulse for 45 minutes. She woke up screaming.



I watched the news, just to see it.



The world hasn’t caught on yet. But it will.



Soon, I’ll walk back down to the basement. I’ll stand in front of the figure. And I’ll point to the first name.
