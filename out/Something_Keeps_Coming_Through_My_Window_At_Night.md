Does anybody know of some *really* good locks for windows?  Because I've got a...problem, to say the least.

Moving out into this complete and utter devoidness of civilization might end up being my biggest mistake ever, and that's saying a lot.  I've made a mess out of a lot of things in my life, but I didn't think I could fuck up simply finding a new place to live, at least not this badly.

Hell, I think sleeping in my car under an overpass next to sewage and bums would've been preferable to this absolute violation of both my privacy and my sanity.

Alright, I'll quit being vague and get right to the point, as much as it disgusts me to even think about: something keeps coming through my window at night, and I don't know how to stop it.

I first started noticing about a month after moving here, though looking back now there were signs I should've caught onto since day one.  "Here" being a small, secluded cabin halfway up a mountain with the nearest town 50 miles away, and the word "town" is doing a lot of heavy lifting.

It was cheap, remote location which is exactly what I needed after what happened near my last home.  I don't want to get into it right now, but let's just say it was...messy.

Look, I know how it sounds, but I'm not trying to run away from anything.  I just wasn't exactly eager to stick around and needed a place to clear my head.  We all need that once in a while, right?

Well, I didn't find that here.  In fact, my thoughts are cloudier than ever, and I have a terrible feeling that a hurricane is coming.

That's why I need your help.  See, what I started noticing after living here for a month is that for some reason, the bedroom window right above my bed just would *not* stay shut while I slept.  The first few weeks I had been keeping it open anyway, as this place has no central air and it gets extremely humid, very quickly in this wooden hotbox.  Then I would wake up almost entirely drenched most mornings, and figured it was just raining throughout the night and getting all over me in the process.

Now I'm not so sure that was rain.

So I resigned myself to being *slightly* less soaked when I woke up, closing the window at night and deigning to drown in sweat instead of polluted rainwater.

However, that didn't seem to change anything.  The first few mornings afterwards I would awaken to that damnable dampness yet again, and curse myself for apparently forgetting to close the window before falling asleep.  After all, it was still open every time I looked back up to check.

I soon realized it wasn't as basic as a bad memory.  Setting an alarm right before bed to remind me, I made sure I was shutting the window every night, right before crashing facefirst into my pillow and giving myself over to the sweet embrace of unconsciousness.
But without fail, I would wake up wet, angry, and increasingly worried about the still wide open window above my resting place.  Was I sleepwalking, and determined to let my house flood eventually?  That made at least some sense to me at first, especially because it only ever seemed to be *me* that was saturated, not my bed, my blanket, the floor nor the walls.

Did I have some hidden anxiety welling up from deep inside, causing me to get up and open the window while sleeping, standing directly in front of it while the elements pelted me with droplets?  That had to be it.  It was the only logical thing I could think of at that point.

But was it really raining *every* night?  

I brushed that thought aside, as I had never lived in this type of area before.  Maybe "mountain weather" just involved a hell of a lot more precipitation than lower elevations.

Regardless, I had to know what was going on with me.  I looked for a cheap night-vision camera and ordered it, with it arriving to my post office box in town within a week.  Another week of enduring post-nocturnal moisture and an open window glaring down at me.  I made the long drive down and back, taking note of a bunch of new, deep potholes along my path that I should probably fill in later

This was going to be the end of it, I kept telling myself as I set it up pointed directly at my bed, far enough away to catch the window in frame as well.

Oh how I wanted that to be true.  I even would've settled for someone breaking in and dumping a bucket of piss on me every night, instead of what I actually discovered.

That night, I followed my usual routine of closing the window as tightly as possible, triple checking it before settling down into bed and soon drifting off.  Without fail, the next morning I awoke feeling as though somehow an entire puddle had been dropped on top of me, and this only strengthened my resolve to watch what was happening every single night for the last few months.

Hooking up the camera to my computer was easy enough.  Accessing the file for last night's recording couldn't have been simpler.  Actually watching the entire video from beginning to end, though?  I found that nearly impossible.

For the first hour or so, nothing was happening.  Tossing and turning a bit, but staying in bed right where I should be.  A bit after the 2 hour mark, however, there was a curious sound: like glass tinking against itself.  Three times, right in a row.

And slowly, my window began opening, seemingly on its own.

It would've been better if it actually *was* on its own.

Because not even 30 seconds later, something came through the now open space.  At first I couldn't even recognize what it was, but as it wound its way down over the windowsill, I could make it out piece by piece.

First fingers, long and slender, tipped with pointed obsidian claws.

Followed by a limb of pale, smooth skin leading up into not one, but *two* separate elbows, one further up along the appendage than the other.

Finally ending with what I can only assume was a prodigious scaled shoulder, unable to fully squeeze through the gap its spindly protuberance had entered, though not for lack of trying; I could hear the wood creak and groan as it pressed against the window frame with clear desperation.

It was an arm.  A fucking *arm*, massive and grotesquely inhuman, was reaching through my window and grasping for my still slumbering shape.  The entire length of it seemed to be dripping as it searched.

It didn't take long to find me.  After all, it had months of practice behind it now.  As soon as it laid those clawed fingers on me, I couldn't help it - I looked away.  I didn't want to see what it had been doing to my helpless form.  I knew enough now, enough that every recess of my being wailed at me to leave, leave now, and never look back.

But I didn't leave.  And I did look back.

It was...petting me.  Caressing me, more accurately.  Dragging those horrible pallid digits from the top of my head all the way down to the bottom of my feet.  Long, slow strokes like one would give to a beloved pet that obviously craved attention.

Somehow, this was worse to witness than simply doing harm to me.  I'd rather it had thrashed me around, or picked me up and yanked me right through the window.  

Instead I sat there looking on in awful wonder as it lovingly touched every single inch of me, the wetness sloughing off its fingertips onto my clothes and skin.  Just as I was about to fast forward through and force myself to watch just how *long* it stayed there doing that, I caught a sound that still sends a shiver of despair shooting through my entire body even as I sit here writing this.  

It was a gurgling purr, a longing and mournful cooing emanating from just beyond the shoulder.  

The worst part is...I recognized it.

That terrible night, the one that sent me on this journey into madness, I heard it too.

I haven't been entirely forthcoming with you all.  I mentioned this briefly before, hoping I wouldn't have to bring it back to the forefront of my mind by recounting all the gory details.  I'll still spare you the worst of it, but for full context now I think you should all know.

Driving back to my previous house one night, the coastline on one side and a thick forest on the other, I hit...something.  It was about the size of a golden retriever, so I immediately assumed it was in fact a dog and got out to see just how bad the situation was.

What laid in front of my now heavily dented fender, heaving and sputtering with that same purring gurgle, was no dog.  God, I wish it had been a dog.

It was scaly and pale, much like the arm that had come to haunt me nightly.  Its own arms were a fraction of the length of this one, and they sprouted from a thick stocky body not unlike a cross between an alligator and a frog.

Just looking at the beastly figure immediately made me want to jump back in my car and speed off, running it completely over in doing so to put it (and me) out of our misery.  But I didn't, and now I seriously think I should've.

What I did instead was pick it up, carry it into the woods, and lay it down there to suffer and die alone.  I don't know why I did that.  I guess I thought I was giving it a chance?  Or more realistically, I was just shoving it out of the way, out of sight out of mind, like I do everything else in my life that I just desperately want to ignore.

The greenish ichor spewing from its mouth and various wounds that got all over me should've told me it didn't have any sort of "chance," anyway.  And let me tell you, the stench of that stuff didn't come out for *weeks*. Sometimes I think I still catch a whiff of it every now and then.

That's why I had to leave.  I couldn't stand being in that area, knowing what I had done.  And to be honest, it just straight up fucking *scared* me too.  The mere existence of that thing obviously implied more like it.  I didn't want to be anywhere near there to find out for sure.

I think I found out now, anyway.

So here I am.  Sitting alone in my cabin, typing out this plea for help.  Not for anyone to come save me, no, I don't want another living soul involved in this mess.

I just want a damn good lock for my window.
