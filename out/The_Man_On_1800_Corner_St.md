 There have been rumors of young girls that have gone missing in our neighborhood. Scary to think about but I’m sure they’re not true. “Jessica come grab a box!”, my dad yelled. My name is Jessica, we just moved here on Corner St. My mom and dad just recently got a divorce, my brother went with my mom and I, my dad.  


We just moved from Washington; my dad thought it would be great to have a fresh start in Texas. “So great!” I thought. Being uprooted from my home, leaving behind my friends, family, and my boyfriend, “Couldn’t be better!” I scoffed. Best part was he thought it was a great idea to do it on my 17th birthday no less.  


Fast forward a couple of weeks, I’ve been forcing myself to adjust. The heat here is unbearable! I came across some other kids my age. One of them called out, “Hey new girl!”. I kicked up my skateboard, pulling out an air pod while walking towards them. “You’re the new girl, right?” the boy asked. “Yeah, I just move in down the street.” “My names’ Ben, he replied”, “Jessica”. “Nice to meet you Jessica, this is Emily and Javi.” “Hey.” They replied in unison.  


“Ben, he’s coming we should go!” Emily and Javi whispered. I looked over to see an older man walking by, “quick look away!” Ben whispered. “Who is that?” “That’s Mr. Schroder”, he responded. “He lives at the end of street, comes off really nice and is very active in the community, but something about him isn’t right, he gives me the creeps!” Also, the way he looks at the girls and women in the neighborhood is creepy…” I stared at Ben, with unease.”  


Over the next few months, Ben and I became close, best friends that were practically inseparable. Today he called and said we needed to talk, it sounded urgent. It was Wednesday afternoon, cold, wet, and rainy out, I wondered what was so important that we had to meet out in this.  


I could see Ben running in the distance soaking wet, he caught up to me and stopped to catch his breath. “Hey what’s going on?! What was so urgent that we had to meet up?” “Emily is missing!”, he gasped.  “I saw her parents talking with the police and they filed a missing person report!” “The police have also questioned me and my parents!” “She is just gone, no one knows what happened to her.”  


A few days later, I was walking down our street when I heard faint screams coming from one of the houses. I stopped in front of the house only to be met by Mr. Schroder. “Hey there Jessica!”, he smiled. I was just chatting with your dad; I told I was free to help him paint y’alls deck this week.  


”I’m sorry to hear about your friend, what was her name? Emily?”, he replied. “A real shame she was such a pretty young girl, I hope y’all find her.” “I am always here if you need to talk about it or just need someone to listen.”  


“I thought I heard screams coming from inside your house.”, I replied. His eyes narrowed as his smile faded. “You might be hearing my dog, Macy.” He stated. “She sometimes gets antsy when I am gone too long.” “Right… Macy…” I said staring wearily at him.  


Later that night I snuck out and quietly made my way to Mr. Schroders house. I peered through the window and didn’t see anything until he popped up in front of me. I quickly ducked, quietly holding my breath, trying to avoid being heard or seen.  


He stepped away holding a chain with a young girl attached, “Emily!”, I gasped. I watched him lead her to a mirror where he started brushing her hair. She was wearing a night gown, her skin covered in bites and bruises… I could see tears streaming down her face. “It’s okay, don’t cry, everything is going to be alright.”, he said brushing her hair into pig tales.  


 He took her by the chain towards a door. “NO, NO, NO, NO NOOO!!!” She cried screaming, “PLEASSEEE NOOO” she whimpered. She fought hard trying to pull away from him and the chain, until the door closed behind them. I could still hear her screams and cries. I stared in horror, tears streaming down my face. I sunk down to the dirt sobbing into my hands.  


Hours went by and I found the strength to pull myself together. “I have to get Emily out of there.” I said fighting every urge to run. I snuck into the house, stumbling around in the dark. I listened quietly, hearing faint cries. I followed the cries and found Emily in a room alone, holding herself.  


 I whispered “Emily, it’s me Jessica, we need to get out of here”. Hope glimmered in her eyes as she lunged to hug me, quietly sobbing. “What happened to you? How did you end up here?” I asked. “I was walking home one day, and he asked for help carrying groceries, I tried to say no but he reminded me that my parents said I should always help when I can.” She said crying.  


“I grabbed a bag; he then covered my face, and I woke up here.” “He tells me that I am his ‘DOLL’…. HEE DIDD THINGSS TOO MEEE!!!”, she sobbed, uncontrollably as I held her.  


I helped her up, holding her I whispered, “Emily, I need you to hold it together, can you do that for me.” She nodded as she wiped her tears. We quickly moved through the house.  


We made it to the living room when we heard a voice call out, “Oh dolly dearest, where do you think you’re going? Who’s your friend?” “NOOONOOONOOOO!!!”, Emily sobbed slowly becoming hysterical.   


“HURRY RUNNN!!!” I yelled at Emily. I grabbed and threw everything I could get my hands on, but he just kept coming. I desperately searched the room for some kind of weapon and eyed a fire poker but it was too late.  


I darted to the back door passing Emily as she tripped over her feet. I made it to the door and turned back to see Emily crawling and crying hysterically. The figure walked up revealing Mr. Schroder’s face.  


Grabbing Emily by her hair, he lifted her off the ground with inhuman strength. I watched helplessly as Emily flailed about, trying to break free. He looked at me with disapproval, “Look what you made me do… I broke my dolly because of you”.  


Pulling out a large hunting knife, he viciously sawed into Emily’s neck. I listened as her screams became whimpers, gasping for air. I watch her body go still, her blood, pouring into a pool at his feet.  


My legs buckled in fear as I watched him drop her lifeless body. I managed to open the door and fumbled out the back. Just when I thought I was free, I tripped over mounds of dirt, falling face first.  


Stunned, I tried to regain my balance when I noticed I was laying on shallow graves, the dirt, exposing young skulls. I tried to scream only to have face slammed into the dirt. Barely conscious, I looked up seeing Mr. Schroder’s face.  


“Hi Jessica!” he said in his friendly voice. “I see you found my little collection; Emily will fit right in.” “As for you, I have always loved new dolls, you’ll feel right at home here.” He whispered, grabbing me by my hair, dragging me back inside. I screamed out “HEEELLPPP!!!”  


“You’re wasting your breath sweetie, ain’t no body ca…” he paused. I looked up to find blood dripping onto my face. I managed to get free as his grip loosened. I stood up to see Ben holding the fire poker shoved in the back of Mr. Schroder’s head.  


“JESSICA!!! ARE YOU OKAY?!!”, he yelled. “I’M OKAYYY!”, I responded catching my breath. One of the neighbors busted through the door, with a bat. Seeing both of us he asked “are you kids okay?!” We nodded. “I’ve called police, I ran over because I heard screaming!”  


He glanced at the bodies, “Dear God! What the hell happened?!” We looked at him in fear unable to speak. Shortly after, the police arrived and began investigating the scene.  


We were given blankets and checked by the paramedics. We sat and stared blankly as the the paramedics wheeled away the bodies in black bags.  


The following week our neighbors, friends, and family held a memorial service for Emily. Police discovered the buried bodies a found they were the remains of  the missing girls in our neighborhood and other surrounding towns.  


Emily was one of 10 victims. Ben and his family ended up moving after the murders. He went through counseling and therapy but it only helped so much. Ben and I are still friends but our friendship hasn’t quite been the same since.  


I have begun experiencing night terrors since the incident. Every night when I close my eyes I still see Emily.  


I hear her screams, see the blood pouring and the terror in her eyes. The words “My Doll” echoing as I see the evil behind his eyes. Reminding me that I am still his doll, reliving the horrors I experienced on 1800 Corner St.
