August 23rd

I watched her again today. Kate. Her hair falls with the same symmetry I remember from before, each strand unbroken, each curl falling exactly where it should. Her nails are precise, unsharpened. Her ears, perfectly formed. Nothing seems out of place, not even the way she tilts her head when she thinks no one is watching. I observed, quietly, and she moved through the room, unaware.

I do not tire of watching. She asks questions sometimes—about my hands, about my eyes—but I do not answer. Her voice is curious, almost warm, but beneath it I know what she wants. I let her speak. I let her watch. Every movement is perfect. Every glance she casts is noted, catalogued, preserved in memory like fragile glass.

The diary lies somewhere. I can feel its presence. Not mine, yet mine. I need it, though I cannot name why. Memory flits through my mind like a candle in the wind—unsteady, on the edge of being extinguished. Something important lingers there, something that cannot be lost. If I lose it, I lose myself.

August 28th

The house is prepared. Every corner, every surface, each shadow arranged for her arrival. The air feels heavier now, like the walls themselves are leaning inward, pressing closer. The dog moved the others today, dragging one across the floor with ease, claws scraping against wood, and I observed without interference. It is necessary.

My finger touched the TV. Black veins spread from my skin, pulsing, flowing into the screen until it glowed faintly. And then the man appeared. His smile was crooked, almost knowing. “Hi, Luke.” The sound echoed in the silence, unsteady, like it came from somewhere too far away to be trusted.

Everything proceeds as intended. Kate sleeps unaware, her breaths slow, even, perfect. I admire her quietly, noting the way her chest rises and falls, the stillness of her hands against the blanket. The diary calls to me faintly. I understand only its purpose, not its reason. Memory is fading; my thoughts slip like sand through my grasp. But I cling to the thread.

August 30th

I moved through the house. Quiet. Too quiet. Footsteps muffled by carpet, the air dense enough to feel alive. Floorboards creaked under my weight. Shadows twisted along the walls, stretching unnaturally as I passed, as though they were reaching out for me. Every sense screamed, but still I kept moving.

The diary flickered in my mind, a faint memory like a dream slipping away at dawn. Why am I here? What is it I’m looking for? A thought came, then vanished. A whisper of urgency. The diary… yes, the diary. I clung to it as I crept, each step measured, careful, a rhythm against the dark.

Doors loomed ahead. I froze. A hinge groaned, low and sharp. Nothing moved. My hands trembled. My heart hammered. Another step. Another shadow. My mind stumbled—fragments of memory breaking apart, slipping like sand between my fingers. But I forced the thought back, anchored it: the diary. This is why I am here.

The entity shifted in the room above. A low creak, a breath, a movement just enough to remind me I was not alone. One step, two, three. The diary was close. I could feel it. Almost there. Static whispered from the TV, faint but insistent: Luke…

I grabbed the diary. Cold, heavy, real. My hands shook violently. Every nerve screamed to run. I backed away. Shadows chased me down the hallway, walls bending inward with every step. The dog’s gaze fixed on me from the corner, unblinking, patient. I ignored it. I ran. Out the door. Into the night. Suitcase in hand. Keys in pocket. My car waiting.

August 31st

The diary is silent now. It’s just me.

I sit in the car, chest tight, breath shallow. The diary rests on my lap, trembling faintly as if alive. Outside, the street is quiet. Too quiet. My mind reels, clawing at fragments of memory that refuse to come.

Somewhere in the house, I know it waits. Patient. Observing. It will not leave. It never does. The threads it has woven, the stories it has begun—they are not done. And neither am I.

I clutch the diary tighter. I do not know what tomorrow will bring. Only that everything has begun to move, and once it has, there is no returning to stillness.
