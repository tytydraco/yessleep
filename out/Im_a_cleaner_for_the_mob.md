I started as an actual cleaner. Doing janitorial work as a floater saw me at a new building every night. Working alone was always my preference, so the position was ideal aside from the piss-poor pay. Two months ago, I found myself in the wrong place at the right time.

We stared at each other, both of us holding our respective trash bags. Mine was swinging in the breeze as I held it over the dumpster, plastic crinkling in the wind. His was being dragged on the ground, it was so heavy. Despite the dark I knew we would have made eye contact. I wanted to run or scream, yet I couldn't bring myself to do it. My legs felt like they were sinking into the asphalt. His words surprised the fear out of me.

I expected threats, or to just be killed on the spot. Instead he asked, "Gimme a hand?"

My bag fell from my grip, and my feet moved of their own accord. There was no way I could say no. Walking over, I gripped the large trash bag alongside him. The man wore black, head to toe. His feet shined with polished black loafers, and his head was topped with a black fedora. His button-up suit was slick and clean, aside from a dark splotch on the shirt under his jacket. The flat rim of his hat had a tendency to cover his face.

"The name's Johnny. And to whom do I owe the pleasure to for this assistance?" He spoke in the faintest hint of a stereotypical north-eastern gangster accent. For the look and the voice I could have laughed at the absurdity. For my life, I did not.

"Oh, uh, I'm Thomas." We pulled, plastic scraping as we went. A bridge was behind us, and I found it fair to assume that was our destination.

"Don't think I won't make this worth your while, Timmy." The bag ripped, and something fell out. I tried to not focus on it; better I didn't know what it was. It dragged and bounced with the rest of the load.

Loafers and sneakers clacking on the pavement, we finally made it to the bridge. With a heavy breath, we heaved the bag over the rail. I saw the hand coming out of the hole as it fell. The splash was so loud that I looked all around, worried that someone might see. Johnny didn't seem to care. Weight must have already been added to the bag; it sank like a sack of bricks. I tried to imagine that's all it was.

Johnny pulled a wad of cash out from his inner jacket pocket, its size surprising. More surprising still was the fact that he gave me the whole thing. He pulled a slip of paper from the same pocket, and handed it to me.

"You get a call from that number, you better fucking answer. We need more people who don't ask questions." With that, he walked out of sight. Just disappeared, like he returned to the dark from which he spawned. Whether I wanted it or not, I was in. I flipped the money in my fingers. I never went back to work that night.

A week went by with no call. I thought Johnny had forgotten about me. I was thankful. Then came the eighth night. Whilst contemplating why I had a video of chimps playing with a children's drum set on my social media feed, a call interrupted the thought. The number matched with the paper, and so I answered. "Time to clock in," Johnny said.

It was easy at first. Going from point A to point B with envelopes big enough to fit in a hoodie pocket. Whether it was drugs or money, it didn't matter. All I had to do was move it. After a couple weeks of that, they upped the ante.

The first package I was given had a corner so bloody, I had to scrub my Mazda's backseat for over three hours. There's still a pink stain. Disposals saw me go to bogs, rivers, or landfills to dump. At times, I had to go to the woods and dig holes deep. I threw the stuff in, and never thought about it again. More, and more money made me think less, and less.

Financially, I've been in the dumps too many times. It got to a point where I told myself I would be willing to do anything for the right price. That's how I made it this far. Then Johnny invited me to the park. He sat on a red bench with stains of dirt. He was immaculate in comparison. The fedora and suit seemed to never leave his body, like it was another layer of skin. I called out to him, and he stood up to give me a welcoming hug. His arm around my shoulders, we walked down the park's trail.

"I want to tell you a story, Timmy." He demeanor was warm, but I knew there was a brutality behind his words. "We had a guy who did runs for us. Carl, let's call him. Well, Carl got tired, see? Told us he couldn't do it anymore. Fair enough, I says, the door's there, ain't no one stopping you. He walked home, back to his wife. Lovely story, right?" I just nodded.

"Bad news was that Carl was in too deep. Maybe got too big for his britches, bit off more than he could chew. This ain't the business for that. You're in, or you're out. So we had to take Carl, wrap little chains around each of his toes. Strung him up like that. He was a big boy, we'd joke how he could be a roast dinner. He was a little surprised when each of us went up, and cut us a slice. Piece by piece. Sent some of the roast to that family he loved so much. Do you have family you care about, Timmy?" I shook my head. It wasn't a lie, but I wouldn't have said otherwise.

He smiled wide, keeping lips closed. It was eerie how ear-to-ear his mouth reached. He patted my shoulder. "Attaboy, Timmy. I knew I liked you. You'll be happy to hear that you earned a promotion!"

Johnny would be the only one celebrating. He told me I would be a "cleaner", then I was set to arrive at an abandoned factory that night. In that silly accent, he told me I'd enjoy the stability. It seemed I wouldn't be moving locations for a while.

The body was already on the table when I walked in. Any machinery that used to be present was gone. It was just an empty space of concrete, with a stainless steel table in the middle. Exam lights on wheels surrounded the table, as though to spotlight a theatre of death. Large chemical barrels sat next to an instrument table that was packed to the brim. I was already briefed. It was time to "clean" the body.

First, I grabbed the bone saw to work through the limbs. My gut wrenched at the softness of the tissue, despite rigor mortis. I thought it must have been a relatively fresh corpse, but I was still shocked at how smooth the cuts were. Blood didn't so much as gush out as it did ooze. It had already congealed within. A bucket was nearby in case I needed it, but I held back. I just thought of the amount of zeros that came after this.

I placed the limbs in the barrels. They were full of sulfuric acid, and the flesh dissolved quickly. My breath managed to be held for what I thought long enough, but I breathed in just as the lid closed. Smells of human meat in acid made me need the bucket. The real trouble began when I went to the head.

Their face still held the look of terror before death. A bullet wound was solidified in the middle of the forehead. Don't look, don't think. I wasn't the one to kill them, but taking that saw to their still throat stopped me. I had to close my eyes. I sawed, and sawed. Tendons and meat didn't pull away as easily. My stomach heaved. I reached the spine. The bucket was used. I opened my eyes for a split second before shutting them again. I could see the insides of the useless trachea. The saw had to be used. And I used it.

A dull blade makes getting through a spinal bone very difficult. I gripped the saw's handle with both hands, and tried to pull back and forth as hard and fast as I could. It got stuck. Trying to pull it free was near useless. I panicked. Scrambling for the instrument table, I grabbed the mallet. With a yell, I brought the mallet down on top of the stuck saw. I smacked again, and again. Cracks hit my ears, splashes of gore flew. Tears ran down my cheeks. With a final voice-cracked scream, I brought the mallet down one last time. The head flew away, bouncing on the cement. It left splotches of dead blood as it went.

I fell to the floor, and leaned against the table. Wrapping my arms around my legs, I sobbed. I didn't want to do this anymore. I told myself it might get easier. I knew it was a lie. Metal echoed as I banged my head against the table. And then the factory door opened.

Almost shitting myself, I stood to flee thinking it was the police. Instead, it was two men in suits I had never seen before... and they carried a body. They tossed it in, rolling on the floor as it impacted. They went out, and grabbed another to toss in. Then another. And another. Four bodies were now scattered on the concrete. Without a word or a look, they shut the heavy doors with a crash.

Four more times. I had to do this four more times. And that was just tonight. Who knew if crime organizations allowed time off? I should file a complaint with corporate, I thought. That made me laugh. Then I ran.

Sprinting past my limits made drool spill out of my mouth. I wouldn't have been surprised if I left a slug trail of tears, spit, and shit as I ran. I didn't know where to go. I don't know where to go. I'm just laying on my stomach in between houses. It's even stupid I'm using my phone, they might see the light. I can't go to the police, not after what I've done. I wouldn't be surprised if they had the cops in their pockets.

I don't think I can be saved. I know I have to die. In a way, this is a plea to Johnny. Please, Johnny. I know you need to kill me, man. But just do it quick, yeah? Come on, man. I'm begging you. Please? Johnny?
