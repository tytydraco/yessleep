When I was little, my parents would sometimes take me to visit my grandmother. I would complain there and back as her house was deep in the sticks with no television or much of anything to do. My grandmother herself would spend most of our visits sleeping, and my parents informed me that she wasn’t all right in the head nowadays. I tried to spend most of our visits exploring the woods surrounding the house, and I was allowed to as long as I agreed to not wonder further than where I could see the house.

One day, my parents had to run some errands in town so left me at my grandmother’s house, despite my protests. I was given my grandmother’s permission to wonder the woods as I usually did, and I took to gathering pieces of wood. What I was planning to do with them I can’t tell you, it was easily the least impactful part of what ended up occurring that day. I ran out of pieces of wood to collect within the area I’d been permitted. I looked behind me and could see the house disappearing over the horizon. I figured going a bit further couldn’t hurt. I found my way to a large oak, easily the largest on the property. It was surrounded by sticks that would have been perfect for what I needed, so I began to collect, the sticks starting to fall out of my arms. When I got up from retrieving one of the fallen sticks, I noticed a deep carving in the tree, one that looked to have been there for decades. In neat and precise handwriting, it read ‘Olive and Ivy’.

Ivy was my grandmother’s name, and Olive, whilst I didn’t know anyone of that name, was familiar to me, as my grandmother would often mutter what I thought to be nonsense words to herself, and Olive would be one of the words that usually came up. I reached out to touch the carving, and I could feel how old it was. I felt a light tug on my hair and spun around only to find no one behind me. Despite my curiosity, I was still an easily frightened child, so I began to run back to the house, yelling for my grandmother.

But something tripped me, sending me face planting into the fallen leaves on the ground. I screamed and scrambled to get up and look around - but again there was nothing. I started to cry, even though I wasn’t physically hurt, but I quickly stopped when I was yanked up to my feet by my arm, 

But it was still by nothing.

I looked at the ground in front of me. Small dents in the leaves began to appear, looking as if they were left by human feet, heading towards the oak tree I had just run from. When I stood watching frozen, they stopped and only continued towards the tree when I gave a cautious step forward. Even though I couldn’t stop crying, I followed the ghost footsteps, as anytime I’d stop, they would also stop and I felt the presence of something watching me until I kept walking. I just silently wiped my tears and followed obediently.

When the footsteps finally stopped on their own, I was in front of the oak tree again. Before I had the chance to think about what was happening, the leaves at the base of the tree started being tossed aside until the bare ground could be seen. Immediately I was pushed by this invisible force to the ground again, though this time I was able to catch myself with my hands before my face hit the ground.

I felt someone watching me again, and it would intensify any time I looked away from the ground for even a second. I tried to push some of the dirt aside to see what would happen, and was surprised to find that the intense feeling that I’d been feeling had temporarily stopped. I tried to appear calm as I kept digging but inside I was racing to try and figure out an escape. If I ran, it would just grab me again. If I yelled for my grandmother, would she hear me? I was running through my options until I felt metal.

I pulled out a small metal box, so rusted that pieces of the paint chipped off as I held it. It was cold to the touch, and as I held it, I heard a noise coming from deep in the woods. At first I thought it was a fox, but as I listened more, it started to sound more and more like another child crying.

I tried to get up to call out and ask if they were okay but I was yanked down again, my hands containing the box slamming into the ground, the force of the fall opening the lid of the box with a loud clang.

Looking back at me was a little girl, trapped in a photograph that lay worn and ripped at the top of the contents of the box. I initially thought it was a picture of me, since the hair and eyes were almost identical, but the writing I found on the back of the photo identified her as ‘Olive, 1945’. She was smiling with her eyes in the photo, but not with her mouth. I’d always been able to tell the difference between when people are only smiling with their mouths and when they were really smiling with their eyes.

Under the photo were some squares of thick paper with these watercolour paintings on them, of flowers, trees and birds. They were all signed in pencil on the back with the same name, Olive. I also found a crumpled up piece of paper, and as I picked it up, the distant crying sound started again from the forest. I opened up the ball of paper to find a kid’s drawing, of a girl with pointy teeth, fingers and hair, cackling on top of a hill, a bright fire scribbled behind her. I found other similar drawings, all crumpled up in a similar way. Others had a woman scaring some children off a hill, or a girl drawn screaming into the night’s sky. The crying from the forest only grew louder, and it sounded like it was almost next to me. I crumpled the drawings back up and threw them on the ground beside the box, crushing them even further with the palm of my hand.

The crying stopped instantly.

I explored the box further. There was an old letter written on a typewriter, and with my limited reading ability I was able to make it out.

‘Dear Mrs Ainesworth,

Following Olive’s visit to Dr Harper’s practice it has been determined that the girl appears to be of an unsound mind. Despite her obvious failings in language ability, nervousness and hyperactivity were observed, and Dr Harper has diagnosed her with lunacy. We recommend that Olive undergo immediate intervention to keep her calm.’

The crying returned but this time it was a heavy sobbing.

I then noticed the cuddly toy stuffed into the corner of the box. It was a grey rabbit, the fur matted and stuck down, likely from a lifetime of hugs. It seemed normal at first, but when I looked closer, I could have sworn I saw blood on one of the ears.

I reached to grab the rabbit but was stopped by a shrill scream echoing through the woods. It made me jump and dumbly look around, even though I knew at this point that I wouldn’t see anyone.

At the bottom of the box was another photograph. This time it was of two girls. One was happily smiling with her mouth but her eyes stayed completely still. Her hair was done all pretty and she was sat perfectly on the arm of a chair, looking at the camera. It wasn’t Olive.

Olive was the one in the chair. She was now in a nightgown instead of her school uniform, and her hair was knotted and all over, as if no one had brushed it in days. She still had no smile on her face but the smile had gone from her eyes. There was nothing behind them now. I looked a bit closer into her eyes, trying to find life behind them. What I found instead was a line of stitches above one of her eyes. Even through the sepia I could see the blood on the stitches.

The sobbing had stopped, and I again felt the sensation of being watched again, this time more intense than ever. I turned over the photograph, and found two names written on the back:

‘Olive and Ivy’
