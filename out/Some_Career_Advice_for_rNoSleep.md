Dear Fine People of Reddit,                   

I’m at my wits end, and I’m quite scared.  This afternoon, I was at the final interview for a job that I was really excited about. This was the third interview, and the first two had gone exceptionally well.                    

So imagine my surprise when literally sixty seconds before the scheduled time, not only does the company cancel, but they send an email stating that the position was closed due to budget cuts. Not more than a minute before the thing was supposed to start.                  

I’m sitting here, having done my hair, put on a suit, and re-arranged my apartment into a professional looking space for the remote-interview. I’m sitting in front of my personal laptop, and I’m looking directly into a webcam that will have no need to be turned on. There is no meeting, and the impersonal camera lens doesn’t want to see me. The job doesn’t want me. No job does. No job in the last nine months has wanted me. I don’t want me.  I’m scared.              

I’ve been sitting here in a suit in front of this laptop for four hours.

It’s August. It’s sunny outside. Yet all I can see is a pitch black void of my own career.  There is sun. There is no light.

The last time I remember this feeling was about ten years ago. I was unemployed and homeless. I had a degree from a top tier school, but having graduated in the middle of the recession without a CompSci degree, the entirety of my work experience was bag-boy and temp positions. In my first five years working full time, I maybe made $60,000 USD, cumulatively.

My parents had kicked me out of the house, because they demanded respect for their contributions to my job search. Said contributions had consisted of the typical advice. “Forget the online stuff, walk in, ask to speak to the manager, give a firm handshake.” They also tried referring me to their friends who were “always hiring”. Which, in fairness, the friends were always hiring, but by the time I would get to them either their pyramid scheme of choice had already collapsed, or they were simply in jail for other reasons.

The help didn’t work, because of course it didn’t, but my parents were personally offended that not only was the job search not going well, but if their advice didn’t work, well then, clearly, I wasn’t trying. After all, they had experience, and I didn’t. My father was especially bothered.

My dad never really worked, which is quite an achievement considering he was employed at the family business for almost forty years. He had no degree, no real job responsibilities, and was often mistaken for an executive, despite rarely going into the office. It probably helped this misunderstanding that the man owned many, many cars. He just kept buying them. We lived in a reasonably sized, three bedroom house, yet sometimes he would have five or six supercars clogging up the driveway and the local road. Shiny things. Fast things. The light bounced off of them, as he’d pay to get them washed every week.

At the time I was struggling to even enter the job market, so I think he was especially upset. He had just been laid off. “What kind of a man would lay off his own brother? After forty years?”. My Uncle, the actual owner of the family business, must have been “the most heartless man” to have done such a thing. To have laid off my father, and ONLY my father for that matter. What kind of a lay-off was that?

Coincidentally, when my father was laid off, suddenly the wildly frequent car purchases stopped. Also coincidentally, when my father was laid off, the company started doing really, REALLY well. Go figure. I wonder where they suddenly found all the money.

So they (parents) started interrupting me and pressuring me when I was doing anything but driving around and looking for jobs. I wasn’t allowed to apply online. I wasn’t allowed to sleep. I wasn’t allowed to see what few friends I had, or talk back. So I left.

Homeless, living out of a motel when I could afford it, and my car most of the time. My parents told me that this was what would happen if I didn’t work hard. If I didn’t excel. One time I got a B+ in English, and my mother woke me at 4:00 in the morning. Clad in her robe, hair disheveled.

“YOU COULD HAVE HAD AN A IF YOU WORKED HARDER! DO YOU WANT TO BE A BUM!?!?!?”

And then she left the room, and I didn’t sleep.

Mommy, I got the A. I got the degree. Now I’m homeless and living in a Toyota, and I’m still not sleeping.

Right around that time, I hated my job. For two years I had somehow gotten a job at a shady Government Contractor as a “Generalist”, which meant that it was my job to do the jobs that no-one else at the company wanted to do. This job paid $12 an hour, with no benefits. It required a drive into the office that was roughly two hours, one-way.  Eventually my responsibilities narrowed, which should have been good, except they narrowed to the one thing that absolutely no-one wanted to do, myself included.

Proposals.

Do you know what a Proposal is? I’ll explain it briefly, because it’s boring as sin. So, you want a new job, like I desperately wanted a new job, typically what do you need to do? You fill out an application, right?

Now, when a company wants a job with the US Government, they have to do a similar thing. Except it’s not an “Application”, it’s a “Proposal”. These are documents that you have to file, that are mind-numbingly complex, where you have to meet a bunch of quantified minimum offerings, and make your case that the Government should hire your company, and overpay said company lots, and lots, and lots of money. The people who do this are “Proposal Managers”, “Proposal Writers”, and “Proposal Coordinators”.

So my job, which I’m holding while homeless, is to write and file almost 200-page long job applications for my company, which is paying me $12 an hour. And this is so miserable, that at the same time, in my off hours, I’m filing job applications and going to interviews, for myself, to do literally any other work I can find. So my entire life is a cycle of begging for work, except when I beg for work for me, I get nothing, but when I beg for my shady employer, they get about $17 million USD a year.

Which is wild, because come bonus time, the company has “had a difficult year”, and can’t afford raises.

Coincidentally, at this time, my boss met my father, and they bonded over their love of cars and the buying thereof. Weird how that works out. My boss told me that my Dad was good people, and I’d have a job there for as long as I wanted, and he’d treat me right.

He gave me a raise of $0.50 an hour.

Side note- I’m sorry, I know this is a lot of side notes, but we’re coming on hour five of me not being able to fully accept that the interview isn’t happening, so I’m throwing diversions in here so I don’t reach the end of the story too soon- my immediate supervisor is the Boss’s wife. She seems to like me, and her daughter seems to like me, and she tells me I should hang out with her daughter more.

“Hey, my daughter has taken up this ‘Cosplay’ hobby. Take a look!”. Shows her daughter wearing an outfit from “Kill la Kill”.

“Hey, my daughter is looking for plans this weekend, do you have plans?”

“Hey, are you going to that anime convention? You and my daughter could share a room!”

Her daughter was underage at the time.

Anyway, something had to change. I had to figure out how to do something that wasn’t begging for work, so I started saving. I cut down on food (not the quality, but on eating in general) under the guise of “Intermittent Fasting”. I cut down on what little recreation I had, and put the money towards therapy.

That may seem like an odd choice, but at the time I had actually had a nasty mental breakdown in-between shifts. Similar to the one I’m in now, really. So I knew I needed help, because I figured that not seeing any purpose in living wouldn’t be productive to my career. And honestly my career seemed to be the main problem in my life.

So I stuck it out at this job for two years, and got pretty extensive therapy, and we found quite a bit. The main crux of the matter was that I was under a Persistent Delusion of extremely low, and sometimes negative, self worth. That my entire thought and behavioral system was fixated on finding ways to create my own failure, and justify my own delusions.

The therapist worked really hard to help me learn how to honestly justify my inherent value as a human being. I had a right to be happy, and to pursue that happiness. Failure was not an inevitability in my life, because I was not the “black hole of value” that I perceived myself as. I could fail, but I could get up again. There would be light in the dark, and chasing that light didn’t make me foolish, or stupid. It was the simple ambition to live, and it was healthy.

After two years of this, I was still stuck in my career, but I was ready to take the next step. My therapist let me go, as she said I was in a much healthier place. I could seriously, really try to get out there. Build a social life. Try dating. Find work that could sustain me.

Anyway, the next day the COVID pandemic started.

Went back to therapy for a year. Stuck at the same job. No going out, and exploring, and building a life, because everywhere was closed, and due to a birth defect in my respiratory system, COVID would literally kill me.

I swallowed my pride, and asked my boss for a promotion. He agreed, with the tentative understanding that in exchange for being made a full time employee (with benefits), he’d slash my yearly salary in half for “budgetary reasons”. I thought I had misheard him, because reception was spotty in his vacation home in Aspen, CO, where he was staying at the moment. Budgetary reasons, yeah.

I applied for a job at a different company, and I got it. Turns out that when work is as miserable as Proposal Management, it’s in demand everywhere. I get a new job, with what amounts to a 200% raise. It’s not close to six figures, but it’s a dramatic improvement.

My parents let me move back in to save money. They agree to show me some respect, given that I’ve now landed “responsible work”. And things go relatively well for a while. After another few years I’m able to move out, and afford my own one bedroom apartment.

It’s now ten years since I’ve graduated college. I’m thriving in remote work. I make a friend. I live alone in a small apartment, but there’s space for my stuffed animals, and sometimes in the evenings I can cuddle up and watch YouTube and Anime on my computer. Things are decent.

I job hop. My salary rapidly escalates. For the first time in a very long while, not only can I pay all the bills that an adult should reasonably pay, I’m able to save money. I invest money in the market. I donate to my 401k, with a salary match.

I don’t have anything close to a work-life balance, but that’s okay. In the busy season, Proposals becomes a death march, due to both the US Government releasing all their work at once, and also last minute changes and chaos. I don’t have a single day off from May to August, including weekends, holidays, and my own birthday. But that’s okay. I have a salary. I have a career. I have worth.

My therapist told me that I should be valuing myself more than these material things, but honestly no-one else does. Not my parents. Not my bosses. So why should I? I’ve earned my meagre happiness, and it’s good.

December 20^(th), 2023, I decide to give back. I feel blessed. I’m working hard, and when you work hard, good things happen to you. That’s what I was always taught by my parents, my schools, my bosses, my therapist. And though other stuff they’ve said is questionable, this one is true.

I write a big check and send it into the “Toys for Tots” charity. Those kids should be happy now. Growing up will probably suck for them as much as it did for me, but I think if more people chipped in, they could have the fun, happiness, and self worth that it took me so long to realize. I send them a check for about three months’ worth of my salary. It’s a lot, but I’m genuinely so, so thankful for how far I’ve come. My apartment is so much nicer than my car. My job is actually important to other people. It feels good to give back.

The next day I get laid off, along with most of the Business Development team, and about a third of the company. It’s a few days until Christmas. The same week, my little sister, who lives several states away, is also laid off. The same week, my father tells us he’s hit hard times, for reasons that are most likely entirely unrelated to supercars, golfing, and his fully-stocked temperature regulated cigar humidor, and he would have to look for work too.

I’m devastated, but this isn’t insurmountable. I polish my resume, and get out there to sell myself. By this time I’ve got about 7-8 years of experience, and career Proposal winnings that outpace most company’s yearly revenue by about 100x. I help my sister, who is relatively new to the white-collar world, write her resume, and I help her look for work. I help my dad, who has never written or read a resume in his entire life, write his resume, learn how to apply for jobs, and interview prep.

I shouldn’t help him, I know, but he’s my Dad. The guilt is real.

And I get interviews, but they’re never for the job that’s advertised. It’s always different responsibilities, or three jobs in one, or the pay was “mysteriously” mis-stated, or (and this one is my favorite) “Ah, everything about this listing is just wrong as a technical glitch. But could we offer you an unpaid internship until we sort it out?”.

My sister lands on her feet, and she gets another sales job. I’m proud of her. She’s got a real Type-A Personality, and she’s meant for success. Some people are meant for success, and some people are meant for failure, and I genuinely believe she’s the former.

My father applies for one job, decides jobs are for poor people, and then launches an ambitious PR initiative to seize corporate control of 30 Golf Courses across the tri-state area because he has “the best resume for it”. He’s also bought a new luxury car, somehow. I’ve helped enough to assuage my guilt, and he’s started getting money again….. somehow.

But as time goes on, I’m getting less and less interviews. And the interviews I do get go on for quite a while- I always get to the last round, but it’s always “You’re great, but someone else was 5% more of a match for the job”. Which initially sounds like nonsense, but honestly, I believe it. In most of my Proposal jobs I’ve had to hire people, and the decisions are rough.

Plus, so much of the process can be done by Generative AI these days. A lot of companies have replaced their entire Proposal departments with AI recently, and they’re getting the same number of Proposals submitted. Now, they don’t go through, and most of these companies are going out of business, but I don’t blame that on the AI. See, with all the Government shutdowns happening, all the companies with actual Proposal Managers and Proposal Writers are ALSO going out of business, so the industry is shrinking horrifically.

I’m seeing the industry where I have almost a decade of experience evaporate overnight. I used to find dozens of Proposal jobs every week to apply to, now it’s a good week if I can scrounge up eight.  And even after reducing my salary ask by 40%, opening myself up to in-person work, and applying to entry level and temp jobs, I’m still getting nothing.

Which is where we get back to right now. It’s been nine months. Between unforeseen emergencies and raising costs, my meager savings are almost gone. Rent is rising.  My industry is dead, and the skills I’ve honed are so niche that I can’t make a career change without starting over. Theoretically I could try to shift and market myself as a Program or Project Manager, but that requires training and re-certification. And, for that matter, why would someone hire me when they could hire an ACTUAL Program or Project Manager, who are also all looking for work right now?

So, it’s time for a career change. I can’t simply do nothing, and go back to living in my dusty car. Of enduring the shame of being a homeless or near-homeless bag-boy, again. Of driving two hours one way to a temp job being paid $13.50 an hour, when parking is $45 a day.

So here’s my idea: I’m going to pursue a career as a Corpse. And I think a lot of you on reddit- specifically in r/RecruitingHell, r/LinkedInLunatics, and procrastination subreddits like r/NoSleep,  should consider this option as well.

I got the idea from my insurance company. See, after I got laid off, but after Christmas (because the phone centers were closed), I had to get a new Health Insurance plan. And doing this through my state took about two months, but at the end of that I had a plan with one of the nation’s largest health providers.

And when you go to this provider for the first time, they have you do a bunch of intake tests- physicals, psychological tests, etc. And about a week after my first visit, I get a curious letter from my healthcare provider. And in this letter, they say that their tests showed that I was “Moderately Suicidal”, which was news to me, because I had never considered the idea before that point.

And as the letter went on, it detailed what Suicidality is, and all the reasons that people would kill themselves, and how suicide is a “Permanent Solution to a Temporary Problem”. But the letter listed out problems that I found extremely relatable, to the point that I was like, “Huh, maybe suicide is the answer”.

“No”, the letter would go on to say. “Suicide is never the answer”.

“You know, the letter seems to be very convinced of this point. I’ll hear it out.”

The letter went on. “We strongly advise you that life is worth living, and that seeking professional Psychological help would help your particular case”.

“Oh, ok.” I think. “Can you please tell me how to do that, letter?”

“We advise you to seek this help, but also be aware that your plan does not cover Psychological or Psychiatric services”.

“Oh.”

“But please don’t kill yourself”.

I threw the letter away and went back to filing job applications.

The sun has gone down. My suit is starting to stiffen up. I’ve still uncovered the laptop camera, but the interview (and job) were cancelled 10 hours ago. Yes, I really took my time refining this writing. Professional pride, given my career is about polishing written documents.

I think the letter was right. Suicide is a permanent solution- and my problems are permanent. Inherent to my being. I’m begging and scrounging for work, and it feels like I always have been, even when I was successful. And from the way a lot of you post, this is a common problem. 

And this is the delusion that my therapist all these years ago told me I suffered from. That it wasn’t always ‘me’ that was the problem. That sometimes life could just be hard. 

But, my friends at r/RecruitingHell, my associates at r/LinkedInLunatics, and you procrastinators at r/NoSleep,  I was paying this therapist $237 an hour to tell me this at the time. And I think she was wrong, and I think that she knew it, because now that I can’t afford that, no-one is telling me that life is worth living. To the contrary, my own insurance company is telling me that, logically, I SHOULD want to kill myself.

And I feel great. Because I’ve realized that some people, like my sister, work hard and are destined for success. And some people, like my father, don’t work hard, but are destined for success anyway. And people like me are inherently destined for failure, no matter how hard we work.

And from reading the posts on here, I feel like so many of you are like me. We can do this. We can persevere past the dystopia of the modern job-hunt environment, and find a position where we have career stability, and security. And that position is in the ground.  Once we kill ourselves, we’ll never have to fill out another WorkDay application again. We’ll never have to deal with another bait-and-switch job advertisement, or the nonsense at LinkedIn.

We will have tried something- and gosh darn it, for the first time in our lives, we will truly be successes at it.

I’ve finally gotten up from my computer. I’ve loaded the gun. I’ve set this post to auto-publish in about two hours from now. I’m ready to make something of my life. I’m ready to seize control of my career.

I’m filled with regrets, of course. I think my mom was right, and maybe if I had tried harder, I could have gotten the A in English. I wonder if I had hustled a little harder, if I could have avoided the layoff axe. I wonder if my charitable donation was hubris that brought about my downfall. I wonder how successful my sister would be without me. I’m bothered that she might be inconvenienced, but she’s a born winner, she’ll do fine. Not like me. I wonder if I maybe overpaid for my insurance plan, given that they sort of accidentally advised me to commit suicide.

I mean, any career change comes with regrets and questions. But I prefer to look at the positives. No more rise and grind. No more commute,  because once I get to the job site I never have to leave. I’ve finally found my happiness. You can too!

I believe in myself, and the success I’m about to achieve. I believe all you can reach it too. And remember: Actual Hell is nowhere near as bad as Recruiting Hell.

We can do it! Good luck!
