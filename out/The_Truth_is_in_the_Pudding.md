They say the proof is in the pudding; they don't know how right they are. It's been almost 60 years since that fateful day. I was a lad of 6 years old, and I had received my first ever pudding cup. I remember the delicate, creamy texture, and the rich chocolate flavor coating my tongue. Above all I remember the voice: sweet as nectar and soft as silk. It called out to me from the chasm carved by my plastic spoon, so deep and dark, seemingly stretching beyond the bottom of the cup itself. "Truth...is in...the pudding". And in that moment, it burned upon my mind a purpose. One that I could recall perfectly at every waking hour of every day, yet one I could not share, for it was my task alone. The key to my salvation.

In the coming decades I devoted myself to the study of the confectionary arts. I knew I had to perfect my craft, to hone my skills to the level that I could complete my task. I sacrificed my worldly ties, rejected love and the company of family in favor of pursuing my ultimate goal. I traveled the world, seeking knowledge of every pudding I could; studied under the Pudding Masters, never letting anyone know of my true intentions. After a lifetime of study and search, just when I had begun to believe that all my labors would be for not, I finally found it: the key to my lifelong obsession.

On the night of my final victory, I sat before my prize. The complete confectionary works of Pudzuzu, Greatest of all Custardmancers, bound and penned on the finest pudding skin, written in the darkest fudge. I threw the book open and flipped to the page number etched into my psyche. There upon the tapioca parchment was the recipe that I knew would be there. A pudding to tear open reality and deliver me unto the Brûlée Plains, where Great Pudzuzu resides. My rightful home in existence.

With fervor I rolled up the sleeves of my robes and began my craft. I started by adding the typical milk, sugar, cornstarch and butter to create the base of the Urpudding. Next, I threw into the pot the myriads of exotic specimens that I cultivated throughout my years of travel. Yorkshire eyes, diabetic essence, three coconut souls, and the heart of one of the elusive Banana-Men, to name a few. Finally, I added the last piece of the recipe to the pot, two cups of my own blood. "Hmm-hmm...blood pudding," I mused to myself, overflowing with anticipation as I set the pudding over the fire. As it reached a boil, I threw back my head and shouted the words inscribed in Pudzuzu's book, "AKVAR GERN PU'DING!" and threw myself headfirst into the pot. I felt my whole body sink into the bottomless Urpudding, and as my skin burned in the molten sugar, darkness took me.

I awoke on my back naked and covered in burns; staring up at a clear, ochre sky. As I righted myself, I heard the distinctive sound of cracking, like that of glass. Looking down, I saw I sat upon a glossy, dark-brown layer of burnt sugar, sticky to the touch. It cracked gently under my weight, revealing a light-yellow custard below the surface, yet it held true and allowed my feet to find purchase upon it. Taking in my surrounding, I found myself near the base of a large flan plateau, perhaps 500 feet tall, with several others dotting the distant horizon, silhouetted by a setting chocolate sun. A cry of pure ecstasy escaped my lips. I had done it. I had finally made it to the Brûlée Plains, my life's work had finally paid off.

The sound of squelching caught my attention, and I turned back to the flan plateau behind me. A vertical split was forming along the side of it, reaching about halfway up the plateau. From the split a form emerged: large, smooth and caramel in composition, with two long eyestalks protruding from its front and a pair of shorter tentacles beneath. My breath caught in my throat and I dropped to my knees in reverence, the ground sinking a few inches from the sudden drop. What I had thought was a plateau was in fact a Flan Snail, one of the great creatures spoken of in the texts of the earliest Custardmancers; thought to be but legend. Its eyestalks gazed down at me for what felt like eons, until it finally opened its mouth. From the yonic opening, a tongue of the darkest molten fudge descended towards me, stopping but a few inches away. Slowly it took on the vague shape of an upper body and I could make out a lattice work of pulsating red and blue veins within its ever-changing folds. From the head, a pair of glassy eyeballs bubbled to the surface, along with a set of several large, misshapen teeth.

The eyes of the creature fixed on me, and its teeth began to move in a facsimile of speech, but no sound was produced. Instead, I heard its words echo within my mind. "I...am...Pudzuzu. Greatest...of...All," the voice said, and I realized its sweet whisper was not unfamiliar to me. "Great Pudzuzu," I said, tears of joy welling in my eyes "I heard your instructions, I have made it here, to you. I have completed my task." Pudzuzu regarded me for a moment, their unblinking eyes staring into my soul. "No," they said, "Not...yet." Without another word they reached out and grabbed me by my arms, their fudgy flesh flowing over and searing my own. Slowly the Flan Snail began to retract its tongue back into its mouth and I was lifted into the air. As we approached the entrance to the great beast's maw, Pudzuzu's head stretched and swayed for a moment before it latched itself onto my open eyes. I screamed as pain overtook me, a feeling as though my nerves had been set aflame; then all sensation ceased.

I awoke with a start on my kitchen floor, and was overcome with a wave of anger and sadness. What of my place among the Brûlée Plains? What of my decades of work? Had I not sacrificed everything to complete my task!? It was then that I began to notice the change. My body felt supple and smooth, too much so for one of my age. I sat up and looked towards my cooking pot. In its reflection I saw the gelatinous mass of pale-yellow I had become, a singular eye protruding from the custard. Pulsating veins peaked out from the ever-shifting surface of my new body. I had achieved my salvation! I felt purpose once again flood my mind. A new task. No, my true task. To create an even greater pudding. One to rival the work of even Great Pudzuzu. I rose from the ground, extending my glorious new form upwards. Soon, all shall be saved. Soon all will know, that the truth is in the pudding.
