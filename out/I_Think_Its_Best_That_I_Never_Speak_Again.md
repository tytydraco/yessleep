I need you all to listen, I have a strange story to tell, the story of the past few weeks, and how it all went to hell.

My life was superb, I'll say it, amazing, I was granted a simple wish you see, and I used 'perfect' phrasing. 

So you're wondering how I got it? Well I'll get to that later, But first I'll explain the rhyming, and why I mustn't waver.

My wish was lots of sex, I had money but no luck, Can you really blame me here, who wouldn't want just to fuck?

My wish was granted and rewarded a silver tongue, Metaphorically of course and it seemed I couldn't go wrong.

At first I loved it, sexy, bright and fearless, Until my rhyming wouldn't stop, and I began to get suspicious.

Every sentence I then said, no matter what the end, All my words began to rhyme and I could not comprehend.

At first I just accepted it, I was having such great sex, The time that I chose not to, the situation turned more complex.

I had just picked up a girl and we were in my hotel room, I finally made the rhyming stop, and here I sealed my doom.

I forget now what I said, but I know she was amused, My words were far from rhyming though, then my mouth began to ooze.

I felt the liquid fill my mouth, my first thought of course was blood, I opened up and spat it out, now Imagine if you would.

Deep red chunks of muscle spewed, dripping from my lips, soft and slippery as they fell, like uncooked chicken strips.

I couldn't believe what was happening, I just stood there in awe, As right there in front of me, lay my whole tongue on the floor.

The screaming finally stopped, the room hit its quietest, I looked around, the girl was gone, probably ran to some psychiatrist.

I scooped up all my tongue, and put it in the freezer, I wasn't really thinking as I picked up the phone receiver.

A woman's voice answered and I groaned at her in pain, I think it was the receptionist, either Susan or Elaine?

I groaned and groaned, and then I groaned some more, "I don't know what you're saying, sir, but I'll send someone to your door."

It seemed to take forever, then finally came a knock, the sound at first gave sweet relief, until my key turned in the lock.

The door slowly opened, to my room 306, non of this was worth it just to score with some hot chicks.

There in the threshold, stood a man I'd not long seen, Tall and dark and scary, like some demonic horror scene.

His arm outstretched in front, and his finger now did point, to the freezer in the kitchen, which had my own muscle joint.

I did as I was told, and followed his command, I walked towards the door and thought, this is not what I had planned.

I handed him my tongue, shredded but in one piece, He squeezed so hard and I screamed so loud, my pain ten-fold increased.

"Break the rules, and you'll only lose" He stated in one deep note, "Break the rules, and you'll only lose" as he rammed it back down my throat.

How did I get here?!! I wanted sex as a hobby! That's when I realised, he was from the hotel lobby!

It was quite simple really, a man with a "magic" dish, Offer up your money, and tell him your life long wish.

I thought it was all bullshit, a gimmick or a scam, Now my only wish, is to never have met that man.

After my tongue, and before he left , He handed me a card, on the front it pictured death.

I flipped it over and read the few short lines, "Break the rules, you'll always lose, and your soul is forever mine."

This card was my last warning, I can never say what i want, He may have returned my tongue to me, but I think it's safer to speak in font.
