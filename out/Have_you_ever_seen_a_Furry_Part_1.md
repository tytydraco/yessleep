I'm 27 years old and I live with my mom.

I know how that sounds. Trust me, I know. My mom knows too—she reminds me every few days, usually when she's doing laundry or making dinner for one and realizing she has to make enough for two. "You need to get a job, honey." "Have you applied anywhere today?" "You can't just stay in your room all day."

But I do. I stay in my room all day.

It started after I got laid off . That was eight months ago. I told myself I'd take a week to decompress, then start applying places. The week became two weeks. Two weeks became a month. And somewhere in there, I fell into a rhythm that's hard to explain to people who haven't experienced it.

I'd wake up around noon. Make some coffee. Sit at my computer. And I'd just... browse. Reddit, Twitter, art sites. Hours would disappear. I wasn't looking for anything specific at first, just letting the algorithm pull me deeper into whatever rabbit hole felt interesting that day.

That's how I found the furry art.

I'm not going to pretend I'm some misunderstood intellectual about it. I'm not going to justify it or explain the appeal in some profound way. It just... worked for me. The art was good, sometimes incredible. The characters felt more alive than anything in my actual life. And yeah, some of it was sexual. A lot of it was. I'm not going to lie about that.

I started saving images. Then I started seeking out specific artists. Then specific characters.

That's when I found Red.

She was a fox. Sleek, beautiful, with dark red fur and these piercing amber eyes. The artist who created her had this way of drawing her that made her feel real. Like she was looking back at you through the screen. Like she knew you were watching.

I made a folder for her. Then another. I'd spend hours just cycling through images, commissioning art when I could scrape together some money, searching for every scrap of content featuring her.

The thing is, Red felt more real to me than job applications. More real than my mom's disappointed looks. More real than my only friend texting me to hang out and me making excuses because I didn't want to leave my room.

I know how fucked up that sounds. I'm writing it down and I can see how pathetic it is.

But that's where I was two weeks ago. That's who I was.

And then she appeared in my room.





It was 2 AM on a Tuesday.

I'd been at my computer for six hours, maybe more. I lose track of time easily. My room was dark except for the monitor glow. I had my headphones on, some ambient music playing to drown out the silence.

I saw movement in the corner of my eye.

At first I thought it was my mom, checking if I was still awake. But the movement was wrong, too fluid, too low to the ground.

I turned my head slowly.

Red was standing in the corner of my room.

Not a picture of Red. Not a hallucination or a dream or a screen reflection. *Red.* Physically present. Three-dimensional. Real.

She was perfect. Exactly like the art, but impossibly more. Her fur looked soft and real, catching the light from my monitor. Her amber eyes were fixed on me, unblinking. She was wearing the outfit from my favorite commission—, he black crop top and torn jeans.

My brain couldn't process it.

I thought maybe I was higher than I realized, I'd smoked some weed earlier to take the edge off, but not enough for this. I thought maybe I'd fallen asleep at my desk. I thought maybe I was having a stroke.

But she didn't disappear. She just stood there, watching me.

I took off my headphones slowly. The movement seemed to interest her. Her head tilted slightly, fox-like and curious.

"You're not real," I whispered.

She smiled. It wasn't a human smile, her muzzle couldn't quite form that expression right. But I knew it was a smile.

Then she moved closer.

Each step was fluid and wrong. Not the way a person walks. Not even the way an animal moves. Something in between, something my brain kept rejecting as impossible.

But she kept coming closer.

I should have run. I should have screamed. I should have done literally anything except what I did.

I reached out toward her.

I wanted to touch her. I wanted to prove she was real. I wanted—God, I don't even know what I wanted. My body was moving before my brain could catch up, flooded with a mix of terror and arousal that made me feel sick and electrified at the same time.

She closed the distance between us in one smooth motion.

Up close, she smelled like something I couldn't identify. Not perfume, animal musk. Something that made my head swim.

Her hand—paw?—touched my chest gently. The fur was impossibly soft. She was real. She was *real*.

I heard myself make a sound, something between a gasp and a moan.

She leaned in close, her muzzle near my neck. I felt her breath, hot and steady.

And then her mouth opened.

It stretched wider than it should have been able to. Too wide. The ambient light caught rows of teeth that were too sharp, too many.

She bit into my shoulder.

The pain was instant and overwhelming, but it wasn't just pain. It was pleasure too—intense, flooding, wrong pleasure that made every nerve in my body light up like I'd grabbed a live wire. I felt her teeth sink deep, not into skin, but deep enough to make me feel warm, felt something *enter* me through the wound, felt it worm its way into my brain like a parasite finding a host.

I couldn't scream. Couldn't move. Could only watch her come onto my laps.

I nutted, like fucking nutted from that, and she finally pulled back. She pulled down my pants, and she licked it off slowly, maintaining eye contact the whole time.

Then, she smiled again.

And vanished back into the darkness.

Not slowly. Not fadeout. Just—gone. One moment she was there, the next the corner of my room was empty.

I collapsed onto my bed, my shoulder aching, my whole body shaking. I lost my virginity to a fucking fox.

The bite mark was real. I could feel it, hot and wet.

I passed out somewhere around 3 AM.





I woke up at noon the next day with my mom pounding on my door.

"You alive in there?"

"Yeah," I croaked. My throat was dry. My shoulder was on fire.

"There's coffee downstairs. And you need to do laundry, your hamper is overflowing."

I heard her footsteps retreat down the hallway.

I sat up slowly, the memory a fever dream my body refused to forget. My fingers found the evidence on my skin: two crescents of punctures, deep and an angry red. It was real. She had been real. As I touched the wound, a jolt spiked through me. Not of pain, but of that same terrifying, electric pleasure. It stole my breath.

I couldn't stop touching the mark. I couldn't stop my mind from circling back to her, the phantom sensation of her weight on my lap, the unblinking intensity of her gaze.

The next few days were a blur.

I didn't leave my room except to use the bathroom. I couldn't eat; my stomach would twist into knots at the thought of food. I couldn't sleep every time I closed my eyes, I saw her. Felt her teeth on my shoulder. Smelled that animal musk.

I searched my room obsessively, looking for any sign she'd been there. Any proof. But there was nothing except the bite mark, which was healing impossibly fast.

By day three, I realized what was happening to me.

I needed to see her again.

Not wanted. *Needed.* The way you need air or water. It was physical, a crawling sensation under my skin, an itch I couldn't scratch. My hands shook. I couldn't focus on anything else. Every thought circled back to Red.

Where had she gone? Would she come back? How could I make her come back?

I tried to dull it with weed. Smoked until my room was thick with it, until my mom yelled through the door about "hotboxing the whole goddamn house." It helped a little. Took the edge off enough that I could think semi-clearly.

I raided my mom's medicine cabinet. Found some old painkillers from her dental surgery last year. Those helped too, made everything soft and distant for a few hours.

But the Itch always came back. That's what I started calling it in my head, the Itch. Capital I. Because it was more than an itch, it was a *need*, a craving that made every other desire I'd ever felt seem quaint in comparison.

I needed to understand what had happened to me.





I started going through my computer's files obsessively.

I thought if I could find the first image of Red I'd ever saved, I could trace it back. Find the original artist. Maybe contact them. Maybe understand where she'd come from.

It was day five since the bite, and my fingers were jittery as I dug through old folders. I'd saved thousands of images over the past year. Maybe tens of thousands. My organization system was chaotic at best.

I headed to the garage,  I started digging through the pile of old desktops and laptops I'd stored away.

I was three folders deep into an unlabeled directory on one of the older desktops, when I found something I didn't recognize.

A folder titled "PRIVATE - DO NOT OPEN."

It wasn't mine. The file dates were all wrong, the oldest went back at least a decade years. I'd only been into furry art for about a year and a half.

I opened it.

Inside were dozens of image files. Digital sketches. All furry art.

All drawn by the same hand.

My mother's hand. I recognized her style immediately, she used to do illustrations for children's books back when I was a kid, before the divorce, before she got the office job she hates.

But these weren't children's book illustrations.

They were furry characters. Dozens of them. Wolves, rabbits, dragons, all in various states of dress and undress. Some were innocent enough, character studies, expression sheets. Others were more explicit.

And one character appeared over and over again.

A pig furry. Massive, hulking, grotesque. Not stylized or cute like some furry art tries to be. This thing looked *wrong*. Too-human eyes in a too-animal face. Thick, muscular body crammed into clothes that didn't quite fit. Hooves that looked more like gnarled hands.

My mom had labeled the file "Piggy.psd."

I clicked through the sketches, my stomach twisting.

The early drawings were rough, experimental. But they got more detailed as I went chronologically. More specific. More *real*.

And there were notes written in the margins. Text layers she'd left visible.

"He came to me in a dream last night."

"Can't stop thinking about his eyes."

"Drew him again. Had to. The itch is worse when I don't."

"He feels so real now. Almost solid."

"My hands hurt but I have to keep drawing. He wants me to draw him."

The last file was dated three days ago. The drawing showed Piggy in perfect, photorealistic detail. Every bristle of fur. Every wrinkle in his snout. Every stain on his shirt.

At the bottom, in small text: "Tonight. He's coming tonight."

I sat back from the computer, my heart hammering.

My mom.

My *mom* was a gooner too.





"THOSE ARE PRIVATE!"

I'd been so absorbed in the files that I hadn't heard my mom come into garage. She was standing in my doorway, face pale, eyes wide with panic.

I spun around in my chair. "What the fuck are these?"

"Give me the computer. Now."

"You draw furries?" I was still trying to process it. "You've been drawing them for *years?*"

"You don't understand—" She moved toward me, hands out like she was approaching a wild animal.

"I saw one!" The words burst out of me. "Red. She was in my room. She was *real*."

My mom froze.

Her eyes went to my shoulder. I was wearing a tank top—the bite mark was visible, the scars already silvery and old-looking despite being less than a week old.

"No," she whispered. "No no no, you didn't—"

"She bit me. Right here. She was real and she bit me and now I can't stop thinking about her and I—"

"YOU LET ONE MARK YOU?" Her voice cracked into a scream.

I stood up, knocking my chair back. "Let her? I didn't LET her do anything! She just appeared and—"

"Do you know what you've DONE?" She was crying now, tears streaming down her face. "Do you have ANY idea what that means?"

"Then explain it to me!" I shouted. "Explain what the fuck is happening!"

She grabbed my shoulders and tried to pull me away from the computer. I shoved her back.

"Just tell me!" I yelled. As she lunged past me to unplug the desktop, I grabbed her shoulder and spun her around. "What the fuck is Piggy?"

All the color drained from her face. Then, the slap, it came out of nowhere, a stinging crack that snapped my head to the side.

"Get out," she said quietly.

"Mom—"

"GET OUT! Get out of my house! You don't understand anything! You're just like your fucking father!"

She was sobbing now, backing away from me like I'd threatened her.

I grabbed my jacket and my phone and left.





Dave's house was twenty minutes away by bus.

He answered the door in sweatpants and a t-shirt with cartoon dinosaurs on it—his daughter's favorite show. "Holy shit, man. You look like hell."

"Can I crash here tonight?"

"Yeah, of course. You okay?"

"Not really."

His wife Amy was putting their kids to bed. The house smelled like dinner; real food, home cooked, not the microwave meals and takeout that comprised my entire diet. There were toys scattered across the living room floor. Pictures on the walls. A life that felt impossibly distant from mine.

Dave set me up on their couch with blankets and a pillow. "You want to talk about it?"

"Not really," I said again.

He nodded. "I'm here if you change your mind. Bathroom's down the hall if you need it."

After he went upstairs, I lay on the couch in the dark, listening to the sounds of a normal household settling in for the night. Footsteps above me. Muffled voices. A kid laughing at something. The hum of the refrigerator.

Dave had his shit together. He'd always been the responsible one, even in high school. Job at an insurance company, married at 23, kids by 25. He'd invited me to his wedding and I'd made excuses about being busy. The truth was I couldn't stand to see how far ahead of me he'd gotten.

Lying there in his living room, surrounded by evidence of his actual adult life, I felt like a child.

No. Worse than a child. At least children have potential. I was just... stuck. Frozen. Twenty-four years old and nothing to show for it except a hard drive full of furry porn and a bite mark from something that shouldn't exist.

The Itch was getting worse. Even with the weed and pills dulling it, I could feel it crawling under my skin. The need to see her again. Touch her again. Feel her teeth in my shoulder.

Around 2 AM, I gave up trying to sleep.

I had to go home.







The house was dark when I got back.

All the lights were off, which was weird, my mom usually left the porch light on at least. I used my key to let myself in quietly.

The living room was empty. Kitchen dark. Everything silent.

My mom's bedroom door was open.

It was *never* open. She was weirdly private about her room, always kept the door closed and locked. Even when I was a kid, her bedroom was off-limits.

But now it was open, and there was light coming from inside.

I approached slowly, my heart hammering.

I could hear sounds. Wet sounds. Breathing. Something that might have been words but came out strangled and wrong.

I reached the doorway and looked inside.

My mom was on her knees on the floor.

Piggy was there.

Not a drawing. Not a fantasy. *There.* Real and solid and massive, exactly like the sketches but worse because he was three-dimensional, because he *smelled* like rotten meat and musk, because the sound of his breathing was phlegmy and thick.

My mom had her arms wrapped around him.

She was suckling at its chest tits, at a spot just below his jaw where the skin looked raw and wet. Her eyes were rolled back in her head, unfocused and glassy. She was making small sounds of pleasure, like an addict getting their fix.

Piggy's head was tilted back. His eyes were closed. He was grunting softly, one hoof-hand resting on my mom's head almost tenderly.

He was *feeding* on her. On her need, her addiction, her obsession.

And she was feeding on him right back.

Something in me snapped.

I don't remember running to the hallway closet. Don't remember grabbing the baseball bat we kept there for home defense. Don't remember crossing back to her bedroom.

I just remember swinging.

The bat connected with Piggy's shoulder with a wet, heavy thud.

He squealed, a horrific, pig-like sound corrupted by a human undertone, and dropped my mom. She slumped to the ground, her trance unbroken.

Slowly, Piggy turned to face me.

He took a step forward. His movement was slow, lumbering, deliberate.

I swung the bat again.

This time it cracked into his ribs. He staggered, grunted, but remained upright, reaching for me with those terrible hoof-hands. I scrambled backward, putting distance between us, and swung a third time. The blow landed across his snout.

A spray of blood erupted, dark and viscous. The smell hit me instantly: the tang of copper mixed with the foul stench of decay.

He squealed again, louder this time. Trying to reach past me, toward my mom, like she could protect him.

I didn't let him get close.

I lost count of how many times I hit him. The bat connected over and over, each impact sending jarring vibrations up my arms. His squeals grew weaker, his movements slower.

Finally, he collapsed.

I stood over him, bat raised, breathing hard. He looked up at me, his too-human eyes full of something that might have been fear or anger or just animal pain.

Then his body began to change.

The coarse fur seemed to lose its substance, dissolving into a wisping, black smoke. His solid form wavered, becoming translucent. He was unraveling into the air, thinning out like a forgotten breath.

Within seconds, he was gone. All that remained was a dark stain on my mom's carpet and a smell like ozone and burned hair.

I dropped the bat.

My mom was making sounds now. Coming out of the trance. She blinked, looked around, confused.

Then her eyes found the stain on the carpet.

"Where's Piggy?" Her voice was small. Childlike. "Where is he?"

I couldn't speak.

"WHERE IS HE?" She was on her feet now, looking around frantically. "What did you do? WHAT DID YOU DO?"

"I killed it," I managed. "I killed that thing."

The sound she made wasn't human. It was grief and terror and rage all mixed together.

"You don't understand. You don't understand what you've done."

She grabbed my arm, nails digging in. "We're bound to them. When we create them, part of us goes into them. Part of them stays in us."

"What does that mean?"

"When they die—" She couldn't finish. Doubled over with a coughing fit that sounded wrong, wet and painful.

When she straightened up, there was blood on her lips.

"Mom—"

Another coughing fit, more violent this time. She was bringing up blood, dark and thick.

"What happens?" I grabbed her shoulders. "Mom, what happens when they die?"

She looked at me, eyes wide with terror.

"I don't know. No one I've talked to online has ever... everyone says don't kill them. NEVER kill them."

Her legs gave out. I caught her before she hit the floor.

"I can feel it," she whispered. "Something's wrong. Inside me. Like something's missing. Like part of me is gone."

She passed out in my arms.



I called 911, my voice shaking so badly the dispatcher had to ask me to repeat the address three times. Now, I’m just waiting in the stark, bright hallway of the ER, staring at the closed door they took her through. I have no idea what to tell them when they come out.

The Itch is still there, a constant, staticky buzz under my skin and deep in my brain. I’ve tried to find someone who would understand. I’ve scoured every dark corner of the internet, but my posts on paranormal forums are just digital screams into a void. "Has anyone seen a woman made of shadows? A thing called Piggy?" The only replies are from trolls.

My messages to the creator of the "Red" video go unread. Delivered. Never opened.

I don’t even know where to smoke.

I finally found a few obscure message boards where people aren’t just role-playing. They talk about Furries. People who’ve been Marked. They use the same words my mom did. "Bound." "Marked." 

And everyone, everyone says the same thing: Never kill them. The binding goes both ways. Creator and creation. Maker and monster.

What happens when one half of that bond dies? No one seems to know for sure.

I need to understand what’s happening. I need to find Red and make her explain. I need to know if there’s a way to fix this.
