[\[Part 1\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1afswv7/the_children_of_the_oak_walker_part_1/)

Basking in long rays of an orange, red, and golden sunrise, the palisade walls of New Wilderness glittered like jewels with a sheer coat of moisture. Rust spotted on the rolls of razor wire that curled along the crenelations, and a faded, patched flag snapped in the breeze high over the fort, bearing the green-and-white rhino logo of the former wildlife reserve. The rains were coming more frequently now that summer had drawn to an end, and our tires kicked up spatters of grayish mud from the worn-down gravel as we sped toward the gates. From atop my perch in the armored gunner’s turret, I could taste the faint aroma of numerous cookfires on the air, and it eased some of the anxiety in my brain.  
*Never been so happy to see barbed wire and woodsmoke.*  
Tall fences began to flash by, chain link and woven wire that made up our perimeter line for the livestock paddocks. Inside them, various herds of animals shuffled across vast stretches of rolling grassland, trailed by a few battered jeeps full of researchers. I’d already grown used to seeing many of the strange creatures that now populated our enclosures; shaggy mammoths that had once been Asian elephants, wooly rhinoceros that had been southern whites only a month prior, and enormous bison that had put on nearly twice their usual body mass since February. Every animal had been affected by the Breach in some way, or “adapted” as our researchers liked to call it. Some, like our cattle, sheep, and pigs, merely grew furrier, resprouted tusks and horns that had to be trimmed down again, and bulked slightly in size. Others, like our exotics, seemed to backwards-evolve into primal reproductions of their ancestors, as if tailor-made to survive this bizarre new world. Even some of the mutants had been domesticated, with plodding herds of the brown-coated Bone Faced Whitetail grazing beside our horses in perfect harmony. Their huge antlers shone white in the sunrise, but there still remained enough shadows that I could catch the greenish bioluminescent glow off some of the tines.  
“Hey there handsome!” Down below, I heard Jamie call through her open window as we rumbled past a broken-down red tractor, where a lanky man with curly red hair waved from amongst the team of attending mechanics. “You know the oil is supposed to go *in* the engine, right?”  
“Nice truck, pretty lady!” Andrew Hoppman shouted back with an ornery grin that stood comically white against the black automotive grease smeared on his overhauls. “Stop by sometime, I’ll lube your chassis.”  
I laughed, as did the other fighters in the truck, and breathed a deep sigh of relief as we passed through the first line of gates separating our enclosed lane from the outside. After a long night in the haunting fields and forests of the old world, it was nice to have something between us and the mutants, even if it wasn’t our strongest defense. Once we were safe within the sturdier ring of wooden logs atop the hill, then I could truly relax. I had a feeling that Jamie would be finding her way to a rendezvous with Andrew after our meeting with Dr. O’Brian was finished, and I would spend that time readying for my dinner with Chris.  
*Assuming none of this blows up in my face.*  
With a sigh, I tried to push the dismal thoughts from my head, and began working to unload the captured M249 machine gun that sat mounted in the turret with me.  
Shielded by the outer wire fences, the cropland portion of the reserve hummed with energetic movement, long columns of workers cutting their way through the fields, most of them women and children. The men sweated in crews of four or five, each team hacking away at seven bison carcasses strung from various butcher poles near the main entrance road. With almost 400 people encased in our tiny fortress, everyone looked nervously toward the north as the temperatures began to drop, eyeing clouds that would dump snow on us come December. Food was a top priority, and what didn’t go to the communal kitchens sold for outrageous prices at the reserve’s tiny market. Inside our defensive wall, however, new construction went up every day, ornate little cabins hammered together by what was probably the strangest sight at New Wilderness.  
“Help, I’ve fallen into Renafair and cannot get up.” Jamie slid out her truck door as our convoy ground to a halt in the main parking lot, the gates swinging shut behind us.  
Climbing down from the gun-turret, I grabbed my backpack from the armored rear compartment, and threw a glance at the almost medieval styled houses of the Ark River folk. “Be nice. I think it looks cool.”  
We had run across the denizens of the Ark River Church of Redemption on our desperate trek through the southlands. Led by the soft-spoken preacher, Adam Stirling, the congregation were kind, hardworking people, with exceptional skills at crafting. Adam being the only exception, they were all blonde, with strange golden irises to match, and had a knack for survival in our strange new environment. Unlike our plain modern buildings, theirs could have been refugees from a Tolkien novel, with sweeping lines and delicate carvings that belonged to another time, an era before electric lights, cars, or cell phones. It had been their knowledge of various mutated plants which helped protect our crops from pests, and their herbal medicines worked wonders for all kinds of injuries, but this remained overshadowed by a simple, startling fact.  
None of them used to be human.  
With a snort, Jamie pulled her patrol bag from the back of the up-armored pickup and slung it onto one narrow shoulder. “I guess. But if they keep this up, we’re going to need skyscrapers, not cabins. And they always eat so much the first three days after—”  
*Wham.*  
From the old flatbed one-ton truck, the Puppets we’d captured howled and screamed beneath the tarp that covered their cage. The iron square rocked under the force of their angry fists, and shouts of alarm went up from the nearby rangers. A gaggle of nearby workers scattered, and several of the Ark River people running.  
Adrenaline coursed through my veins, and I unslung my Type 9 on reflex, Jamei already flexing her grip on the AK in her hands.  
*“Tace! Est satis!”* Booming from the crowd that had gathered, the flowery Latin words seemed to crush all noise into submission.   
From the circle, Adam’s second in command stepped forward, wearing the camouflage-painted armor the Ark River folk were known for. A long cruciform sword hung by his side, a weapon they all carried without fail, hammered from old automobile springs they’d scavenged from dead cars around the southlands. No one could have known though, not for the elegant workmanship that went into the blade, its grip wrapped in black dyed leather, a metal cross making up the pommel. The armor bore the same disciplined craftsmanship, overlapping plates of steel that harkened back to an era of columns and chariots, painted like leaves, grass, and tree bark. Still, a modern M4 carbine lay across his back, and ammunition pouches lined the man’s leather belt. His clothes were handmade, as were the boots on his feet, which bore rub marks from the stirrups that helped his kind ride the Bone Faced Whitetail like horses.  
“Sounds like a good haul.” In a slightly accented English, Aleph scrutinized the covered truck bed with a patient scratch of his braided beard, which reminded me of a Viking show I’d seen once. “How many?”  
“Four females, and three males.” One of the rangers from our group eyed the cages warily, his Armalite rifle clutched tight in both palms. “That big one is real mean though. Might not want to mess with him.”  
I scuffed my soles on the wet asphalt and avoided looking at the cage. Despite their horrifying features, it still felt odd describing the creatures like this, when they were a mirror-flip away from being just like us. Considering what was about to be done to them, I wondered if the others didn’t share that sentiment.  
When the mutations had first started, or at least, so I’d been told, all the monsters had appeared at night. Abnormal electrical storms preceded many of their appearances, and soon, the beasts owned the night around New Wilderness. None of us had ever asked, or considered what would happen if they came out during the day; we just accepted that they didn’t, or perhaps couldn’t, and were glad for it. Stripped of our modern technology by the invisible power of the Breach, we were completely outclassed, most of our electronics destroyed, and cell-towers rendered inoperable. Reduced to glorified peasants with guns, we were on the brink of extinction, so any advantage was a welcome one. It had been Adam, cooped up in his empty church on the other side of the southern ridgeline, that had first discovered our enemies’ mortal weakness.  
“They won’t get far, strong or no.” Aleph stalked over to the edge of the tarpaulin, and as he reached up to grasp it, I could see his mouth moving, uttering a low whisper full of foreign words I couldn’t make out.  
More golden-haired warriors surrounded the truck, and the rest of us backed away, gawking at the shiny spears in their hands. While our blacksmiths had struggled to re-learn decades of lost knowledge, the Ark River folk seemed born to be master craftsmen, their blades light and sharp, every fitting a work of art. They were as deadly with them as they were with any rifle, and it only added to their mythical aesthetic.  
Whispers rose on the wind, and my gut twisted as it hit me that they were coming from inside the cage, unintelligible human voices strained with swollen vocal cords and untended infection. I’d only seen Puppets do this a few times, and it always happened in the presence of Ark River people. I was almost as if they could sense who or what they were, like a delayed form of recognition, which only served to make the sounds that much more eerie.  
*Are they actually saying anything? Is it all just gibberish? Is there such thing as Puppet-speech?*  
Drowning in similar levels of morose thought, everyone waited in tense silence, and beside me, Jamie thumbed the safety down on her AK.  
Off flew the tarp in Aleph’s grip, and the air burst into a cacophony of horrible shrieks.  
Most of the others backed further from the truck, and some covered their ears, the screams as shrill as metal being dragged over concrete.  
*Clank.*  
One of the warriors unlocked the cage door, and another hit the hydraulic switch on the dump bed to send the Puppets tumbling to the ground.  
In a mass of filthy arms and legs, the monsters scattered, only to be met on all sides by the lowered spears of the Ark River guardsmen. Hemmed in, they began to twitch in seizure-like contortions, as their gray skin tinged charcoal black. Smoke wafted off the spreading burns, the greasy hair turning to ashes, and they each let out pitiful wails that made my teeth grind for the flicker of humanity in them. I’d never heard such cries before in my life, a heartrending blend of fear and agony that held nothing back, as if the very life-force was being ripped out of the poor beings.  
“Mother of God.” Jamie muttered under her breath, her own jaw working in disgust, and she brought a hand up to cover her nose. “That reeks.”  
It curdled on the wind, a stench of fried skin and boiled rot, sickly sweet, with a salty, sulphury accent. Like molasses, the scent clung to the back of my tongue, and I fought the urge to gag.  
*Just imagine how that must feel.*  
Crumpling to the ground, one of the females curled into a ball not yards away from where I stood and shook as if she were freezing to death, even while her skin crusted over like an obsidian shell. With her ragged clothes burned away, she was no bigger than me, and I felt a small twinge of pity at how her gray face swam with milky tears that evaporated as though they were on a hot skillet.  
A roar erupted from the pile, and the big male charged forward on two unsteady legs, upright in a semi-human gait that wobbled for how the sun attacked him.  
Panic rose in my throat, and Jamie’s gun flashed to her shoulder.  
The rest of the warriors hefted their spears, ready to bring him down.  
Aleph didn’t move, even as the male came face to face with him, their eyes locked.  
Just before it reached him, the big male stiffened, and slowed, his legs locked up, the burns creeping too far up his body to permit movement. He bellowed into Aleph’s stoic face with abyssal hatred, the two less than an arm’s length from each other, but neither moved further.  
Arms at his sides, Aleph watched him without the slightest ripple of fear on his bushy face. He never so much as reached for his sword, didn’t flinch, his boots not moving one inch backward. *“Improba est ira tua, frater. Vade in pace.”*  
The words held no hint of animosity, and the instant Aleph spoke, the big male’s gray skin charred black, and he went rigid.  
Each of the figures lay froze in various positions, now closer to ebony statues than nightmarish mutants. Warm rays of sunlight streamed down over the walls of New Wilderness, a gentle start for a mid-October day in southeastern Ohio. I could feel the damp chill in the air, and I tugged at the sleeves of my buckskin-colored jacket, aware that it wouldn’t be enough in two months’ time. How strange, to feel cold while these things burned, to seek the sun while they hid from it.  
*“In patris arma committimus te, sanguinis nostri sanguinis.”* Still facing the inanimate statue of his opponent, Aleph calmly spoke the words aloud in the same ritualistic prayer their kind always made over the bodies, and bowed his head for a brief moment.  
Lowering their spears, his companions joined with their own mutterings in Latin, a language they all spoke with the fluency of ancient Romans. One by one, they picked up the crusty statues, and carried them off toward their section of the fort, where they would keep them until the evening. When that time came, the sooty black coverings would break, and from inside the macabre husk would crawl pale, trembling people, with golden eyes, blonde hair, and cream-colored skin. It was a miracle seemingly reserved only for these people, as none of our attempts to convert Puppets had been successful. Only Adam and his followers could ‘redeem’ them from their lowly state, through the painful fire of the sun.   
“They will thank us.” Aleph seemed to note my squeamishness, and gestured to his former opponent, which was being carried off by four other warriors. “They always do.”  
I nodded, not wishing to be impolite, and watched as Aleph left with his kin for their sector of our camp. It might have been horrifying to watch, but I knew that once they awoke as humans, they would be far better off than before. Lots of other mutants hunted Puppets in the wild, and though we had yet to find any dead from natural causes, we had yet to find any that looked ‘healthy’ for their species. Besides, the more we converted to humans, the less we had to fight in the bush.  
Still, there was no getting used to that horrid smell.  
“Well, that’s ruined breakfast for me.” Jamie switched her rifle back to safe with a heavy sigh, as the rest of the crowd dispersed. “Come on, let’s get to O’Brian’s office before we get roped into washing down the trucks. God only knows how they mucked up that cage on the way in.”  
We ducked out of the crowd of onlookers that had formed and moved down the left-side gravel lane between the corrals, barns, and pens of the wildlife reserve. Many of the paddocks inside the main wall were occupied by our domestic cows, sheep, pigs, or goats. Since we’d been forced to release all the carnivores that the reserve had on hand due to their ‘adaptations’ from the Breach, we had plenty of space to house the sturdy livestock. It hadn’t come without its price though; the predators had taken to the wild sections of Barron County like fish to water, and the former cheetahs, timber wolves, and Bengal tigers now had the fangs, claws, and fur of their prehistoric forerunners. Thus, our world had become that much more dangerous, and we couldn’t leave our lesser-adapted species out for too long, or risk finding a pile of bones in their stead.  
“Meat’s gonna get short, come winter.” Jamie trudged alongside me and sized up the shaggy cows that munched on their grass on the other side of the encloser fence. “We’re going to have to cut back on what we butcher, if we’re going to have enough breeding stock for next year. Bison herd can only take so many losses too. We’ve already got 100 more people than before, and at this rate, we’ll go into December with 500 inside the gates.”  
I chewed the inside of my cheek, and thought about the sirloins Chris had bought for our date, wondering if this would be the last time we could enjoy such a luxury. “You think we can make it?”  
She shrugged, and I could see tired bags under Jamie’s eyes. As the new combat training coordinator for non-ranger personnel, Jamie took her promotion very seriously, to the point that she ran herself just as ragged as Chris did. They were a lot alike in that aspect, stubborn and ambitious, a fact not lost on my inner musings over the unfortunate spy problem.  
“I figure most of the Ark River folk will go back to their citadel in the south before the heavy snows set in, so we shouldn’t starve. But even with trade caravans coming from their camp, it’s still going to be lean around here.” Jamie threw a glance over her shoulder, something that had become second nature to everyone in the tiny fort. “People are going to get weird when that happens.”  
*And weird hungry people do desperate things.*  
Keeping pace with her, I nudged my submachine gun behind my back, and scratched at a fleck of dried mud on my cheek. “Maybe Sean’s offensive will work? I mean, the war could be over by December.”  
In front of us, the clinic appeared from the maze of fences and gravel paths, a square two-story building with white plaster walls, a green sheet metal roof, and glass double doors. Since it had been a conservation facility at one point, New Wilderness had spared no expense in the construction of its Fur and Fang Veterinary clinic. It had its own small radio repeater, an independent generator that ran off a gas well, and operating rooms that could rival some of the B grade hospitals in the surrounding states. This had been a blessing in disguise for the little reserve; the same advanced equipment and training used to keep endangered animals alive proved useful in putting chewed-up humans back together once the mutants began to attack in full force. It had become the de facto headquarters for the Researcher faction, and no doubt the lives of many had been saved by their scalpels.  
Jamie gave a rueful chuckle as we approached the shiny glass doors and scraped her muddy boots across a welded horseshoe that had been stuck into the yard for just such purposes. “Oh, to have faith like yours. They said the same thing about World War One when it first kicked off. No, I don’t think it’ll be over by Christmas, and if it is . . . well, I doubt we’ll live long enough to worry about what comes after.”  
A hollow feeling sunk into my guts, and I paused by the double glass doors of the clinic to let her go ahead.  
Thunder rumbled somewhere in the distance, a deep, rippling boom that made my heart skip an anxious beat. Rainstorms weren’t uncommon for Appalachia this time of year, but thunderstorms were supposed to get rarer as the snow came on. However, like many of the unseen forces that had shaped Barron County into its nightmarish condition, even the clouds here weren’t what they seemed. Just from where I stood, I caught the flickers of lightning in the far off strip of dark clouds, surreal flashes of green, yellow, and orange bolts that defied the laws of common weather. New Wilderness had barely lasted this long, and no one truly could predict what winter would look like under such an atmosphere. One thing was for certain; without modern supply chains to feed us, and with the days growing shorter, our war with ELSAR could cost us everything we needed to survive. Sean wanted to launch a military offensive to push them out once and for all, but if it failed, we would be left completely exposed here. My mission to uncover the traitor couldn’t be more important . . . and if I was honest, I didn’t have much of a plan at all.  
*Let’s hope I come up with one before the spy figure’s out I’m hunting him.*  
Stuffing both hands into my jacket pockets, I kept my head down against the chilly northern wind and dragged my muck-covered boots over the iron horseshoe. With most of the dirt shucked from my weathered footwear, I jogged after Jamie into the cozy interior of the medical center.
