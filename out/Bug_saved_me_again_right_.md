Hi everyone. A couple of you no sleepers probably heard my last story. It was removed for not being quite scary enough, but that was fine by me. At least I got it out to a few people. 

However, I am back once more, all though I really wished that I wouldn't have to post on this sub Reddit again. No offense. But something truly terrifying happened last night

We were back in the apartment, all ten of us newbies who had rented it out first. Including Mike, although he was still a little traumatized. 

I was reading, with my black reading glasses resting on my head, looking like a nerd- when there was a faint rustling. It was coming from the living room. 

I found Bug scratching one claw on my wooden floor. Then he scooched back a little, only to repeat again. All the while he was quietly making muttering noises. 

"Bug? What are you doing?" 

I had forgotten that Bug could no longer talk. For those of you who do not know, Bug is a cat that could talk for a couple of hours last night. 

He jumped, seemingly surprised that I was there, then looked up at me with those big, innocent kitty eyes. My heart softened, as his stare seemed to melt my soul. For a split second I could have sworn that he smirked at me, but he quickly turned around and did his weird little new hobby again: scratch, scoot, scratch,scratch, scoot. 

He was making tiny tally marks in the floor. 

There was one, two, three, four, five, six, new row, one, two, three, four, five, six, new row, one, two, three, four, five, six. Then he abruptly stopped, smirked, and left the room with his tail held high. 

Wait. 

Did Bug just make that on purpose? 

I scowled and covered up the marks with my bathroom mat. I pushed it behind me, making myself believe that it was just weird cat behavior. 

But no longer than had I gotten back into bed, there were scratching sounds at the door. I looked down at Bug at my feet, curled into a tight little ball. I smiled, assuming that it was safe to say that there wasn't a monster at the door. 

How could I have been wronger?

There was a man at the door, kind of short with a trench coat and a beanie. He had a friendly face, but I still talked at the peep hole. 

"Sir? Can I help you?" 

"Ma'am, please do. My son is stuck." 

"Can't you call the police?" 

"I tried. They won't send anyone over." 

I sat for a moment, thinking. Bug sat behind me, looking emo in his black cat sweater, plus his dark gray and black features. 

Still, his piercing eyes shone, and seemed to say, "Open the door." 

I obeyed, opening the door a little. The man made a pleading face and I gave in. "Follow me," he ordered. Bug trailed the man and I all the way to the back of the apartment building. 

"Here," he said, gesturing to his room. The number was too damaged to read, even though the apartments were new. 

Well, as any stupid person does his the horror movies, I followed the man in. He locked the door behind us, which made me feel a little uneasy. 

"Won't you help me, now?" He asked. 

"Sure." 

"You know what, before we go and help my son, I need something else from you." 

"... what?"

Suddenly, the man smirked, just as Bug had smirked at me earlier. Then he opened his mouth wider than any human ever could, to the point that his jaw seemed to break and his mouth spewed blood at the corners. 

I screamed in terror as two dark, goopy hands emerged from his mouth, pushing out the rest of the creature that emerged. It was tall and thin, with a tiny head and a smile with rows of sharp, blood stained teeth. 

It had no eyes. Oh my gosh, it had no freaking eyes, guys. It didn't even have eye sockets, heck, it didn't have a nose, just a mouth. 

A huge mouth that almost wrapped all around the creature's face. Yet it could see me. 

As for the rest of the body, it was kind of fleshy, with goopy stuff dripping down its sides. Long fingers joined tiny palms, and its toes were claws. 


"Son!" It called in a mecacing tone. "You can come out now." 

I saw my cat- my Bug, my charming, precious baby - open his mouth so wide that he screamed. He legit screamed. His jaw broke and blood spewed from the corners, just like what happened to the man. Out crawled a miniature version of the bigger thing that was standing in front of me. 

"Daddy. I'm hungry. The cat did not eat food." 

"Don't worry... dinners right here." 

I trembled for what seemed like for forever with those things with no eyes just staring... watching their prey. Waiting for my first move so that they could watch me suffer as I waited for it to end. 

Bug was still deflated on the ground, as was the man. 

I wanted to move. Yet my legs were concrete. I wanted to run, but what would they do to me if I did? I wanted to stay still, but what would they do when they got bored? 

So I did the only thing that came to me. 

"In the name of Jesus Christ... leave me alone," I said, my voice weak and trembling.

The creatures stumbled back, as if hit by something unseen, and looked at each other surprised. I took my chance to get out of there. 

But before I could scramble to the door, the smaller creature pinned me down. It laughed maniacally as its "dad" pinned me to the wall, drawing one of its claws out and pressed it to my neck. 

"Dinner is being difficult," he said, his smile growing bigger and stretching as he talked. I sobbed, unable to speak. 

"Dad, I want food NOW." 

"Now it is, son..."

He drew back his claw, ready to slice me to bits. I stiffened and squeezed my eyes shut, unable to breathe. Unable to think. 

Suddenly, out of nowhere, he was knocked to the floor. 

"YOOOOWL!"

Bug furiously slashed the creature, despite his limp jaw. I gained the courage to grab on of the kitchen knives and stab the creature. It screeched.

I then turned to the younger, which was still smiling. I don't think these creatures couldn't smile. I slashed it, then kicked it to the floor where it thrashed around, green liquid spilling from the places I had cut it. 

We kept working until they stopped moving. Their smiles stayed frozen on their faces. Bug collapsed from exhaustion and probably pain. 

I scooped up Bug, but before I left, I turned back to the creatures. "And in the name of Jesus, stay down," I said. 

They did. 

.............................

I took Bug to the emergency vet that evening. "Oh my gosh, what happened to this baby?" Asked the vet, as she grabbed him and took him for surgery immediately. 

I quickly made up a believable story. 

"Don't know. He got out of the apartment somehow, and I found him like this." 

"We'll fix him up." 

Bug came back to me with a stitched up face. Apparently it will take a few months to fully heal, but luckily the jaw damage wasn't bad enough to amputate it or worse, euthanize my Bug. 

I'm really glad we made it. But from now on, I'm keeping up with Bug's behavior. Stay safe.
