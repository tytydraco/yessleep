So which one of you is it? I know you're reading this, since you're so clearly obsessed with everything I do. I'll give you one last chance to fess up before this gets ugly. My dad's a lawyer, you know. You figure that out in your research? Did all your stalking tell you how I'm gonna utterly annihilate you in court and sue you for every cent you're worth? 



I guess the uninvolved parties reading this might be lost, so allow me to provide some context. I'm something of a horror connoisseur; I'm a content creator who collects art that resonates with me and shares it with the world. Basically I'm a curator for internet stories, and I've amassed over a million followers across TikTok, YouTube and Instagram. Thanks to the amount of content I produce, I'm able to make a decent sum of money from this hobby, and it's the easiest money I've ever made in my life. All I do is scrape some text, run it through a text-to-speech generator, generate a creepy AI image for the thumbnail, throw the audio over some video game recording, and then click upload. Most of the process is automated, so all I've gotta do is sit back and watch the money roll in. 



I know some of you bemoan the lost art of narration or authors not getting the compensation they deserve or blah blah blah. Look I'm just giving the people what they want, and the people want Subway Surfers and a robot narrator. If you're pissed at me for what I do, at least be honest with yourself—you're really just jealous that you didn't think of it first. 



So anyway, a few days ago I'm on Reddit, browsing around for my next project, when I get a private message. Already, this is pretty unusual; I deleted my old Reddit account cause this author kept bitching at me about his stories being copyright protected or whatever, so I'm under the radar these days. I don't get many messages. The name of the account that sent me a DM was "dolor\_40" and the message read: 



**dolor\_40**: *Hey there, thank you so much for your interest in my story. I noticed that you uploaded a narration of my latest post to YouTube without my permission, and—*



I stopped reading at that point. Cry me a river. I didn't remember an account by that name, so I checked on their profile to see what story they were talking about. Their most recent post was some weird-as-fuck, "artsy" piece about a man who cannibalizes his wife as the ultimate expression of his love. Whatever. Edgelord horror authors bore me. Bro probably kisses a framed photo of Bret Easton Ellis before they go to sleep at night.  As I was scrolling through the author's other posts, I got another message. 



**dolor\_40**: *I see that you're online. It would mean a lot to me if you could take the story off of YouTube.*



I didn't have the online status indicator turned on for Reddit, so I assumed they were bullshitting and couldn't actually see I was online. Anyway, I blocked the account after that and went about my night. I went to sleep not too long afterwards, and when I woke up, I saw yet another message request on Reddit. 



**dolor\_41**: *You're making me sad :( I worked really hard on that piece and you stole it like it was nothing. Why can't you just take it down?*



Persistent bastard. I couldn't believe they'd made a whole new account for this. I blocked dolor\_41 too, and not even five minutes after doing so, I got a new message from, you guessed it, dolor\_42. At that point I just nuked my own Reddit since it was a throw-away made solely for browsing. I had no idea how the author had found me in the first place, though.



The following evening, I returned home late at night. I was surprised to see a box awaiting me on the porch. It was light and around 16" x 6" x 3"—too small to be anything I'd ordered recently. My name and address were printed correctly, there were no strange odors or stains or protruding wires, but there was also no return address on the box. I gave it a small, experimental shake. Something solid rattled around inside. I brought it inside, grabbed a box cutter, and sliced through the tape. 



Inside the box, I found a hammer. No packing paper, no note, just a hammer. I grabbed a glove to be safe and took it out of the box, inspecting it. Standard, 16-oz claw hammer with a fiberglass handle and rubber grip. It looked like it had only been used a few times. Figuring it had been sent to me by mistake, I shoved it into the entryway closet and forgot about it. 



You know … I don't even know if this part is worth mentioning. It's stupid, I'm sure. Just something I imagined. And yet, that same night, I could've sworn I heard a tapping at my front door. Not even knocking, exactly; just gentle thumps against the wood. If there was someone at my door though, they were gone by the time I got out of bed and looked through the peephole. 



Over the next few days, I received a flood of comments on my narrations, all from users with some variation of "dolor" in the name: more\_dolor, dolor-S, dolor-X, dolor100, etc. They started off in that same pleading, pathetic tone they'd first reached out to me in, but every comment got increasingly hostile. It got to the point where I had to turn on spam filtering for certain words, which made me feel like a total pussy. I wasn't scared or anything—it was just annoying. 



I headed on over to Discord to let my friends know what was going on. I don't advertise my server much; although it's public and has a few hundred members, my IRL friends are pretty much the only active members. I posted a screenshot of some of dolor's most recent spam comments on my new video. 



*Dealing with this shit for a while.* I posted. *Next upload might take a few days*. 



The response was a few sympathetic comments and jokes, and well as some advice on how to deal with spam bots. My buddy Aaron, one of my IRLs, sent a text in our group chat. 



*Drinks tmrw?* His text read, then: *Jay i'll get ur first round since your getting cyberstalked. compensation lol*



I liked his second message and started to coordinate the time and location. Before I closed Discord, I remember looking at my green status bubble. "I see that you're online" … Was that loser in my server? DMs were one thing—asynchronous and detached—but the thought of dolor\_40 watching my messages in real time was an unpleasant one. 



I logged off with a pit in my stomach, hoping some exercise would help me clear my head. Deciding on a run as opposed to weight training at my home gym, I stepped outside and damn near ran into the mailwoman, who was holding a box for me. I thanked her and brought it in. 



Once again, the box had no return address. This one was smaller than the previous box, and lighter too. I sliced the thing open, and waiting for me inside the box was a plastic, long-stem funnel. I had no clue what was going on. Of course, part of me wanted to jump to conclusions, wanted to assume that the packages were somehow associated with the creep who'd been cyber-stalking me. But why the hell would they send me a hammer and a funnel? It was more likely that it was a prank being played on me by one of my friends, who'd done similar things in the past. I think Aaron still gets the occasional letter from the gay porn magazine me and Dan signed him up for during sophomore year. It wasn't unlikely that one of them was doing it as a joke, but none of them fessed up when asked about it.  



A few days passed. Activity from this "dolor" person slowed down significantly and then stopped altogether, and at first I was relieved, figuring that they'd finally lost interest. I was curious as to what made them give up, so I started scrolling through the comments on my last YouTube video.  The last comment from "dolor" was from a few days prior. It read:



**pulchra\_dolor**: what's the use of a pretty voice if not to speak?



Before I had time to decipher what the hell that was all about, I heard a knock at my front door. It was late at night, and I certainly wasn't expecting company, so I looked through the peephole first. When I saw it was just a mailwoman, I opened the door. 



"Jay?" She asked, and when I nodded, she held up a large box. Annoyed, I grabbed it out of her hands and set it on the ground. I didn't feel like bringing whatever it was inside my house, so I ripped the box open right there on my porch. The mailwoman stuffed her gloved hands inside her pockets and watched me, probably thinking I was crazy (or just … really weirdly excited to be receiving a package.) Inside the box was a whole gallon of Clorox bleach. 



"Are you fucking serious?" I said, holding up the plastic container and turning it around in my hands. Brand new from what I could see. "Can you even mail this? How'd this shit get shipped to me?" 



"It didn't." The woman said. I looked at her. 



"So someone just like … dropped this at the post office where you work, or …?" 



The woman in front of me gave me an odd smile. Had she always been my mail-carrier? For some reason I didn't remember her being quite so tall or having a smile quite so lupine. 



"You don't read them." 



"Huh?" 



"The stories. You don't even read them, do you?" 



I dropped the bottle of bleach, took a step backwards, and shut and locked the door. I stood there for a second in disbelief, and then I grabbed my phone to call the police. I had no idea how to succinctly convery the situation without minimizing it. I wasn't sure she'd even done anything illegal at that point. Was she impersonating a mail carrier or was that actually her job? Was that the same person who was cyber-stalking me? Was this all some kind of sick prank? I did my best to explain what happened to the police, all while peeking through my window shutters to see where the woman had gone. I didn't see any trace of her—if it weren't for the gallon of Clorox on my porch, I might've thought I hallucinated the whole thing. The police were wildly unhelpful, but they promised to open a report. I'm supposed to go down to the station tomorrow to talk to a detective. We'll see how it goes I guess. 



As of right now, it seems like every profile associated with "dolor" across all social media has been deleted. Maybe she's trying to wipe away the evidence now that I've seen her face? She better fucking run is all I'm saying. 



I did finally get around to reading the stupid story that got me into this mess though. There might not be a copy on any of her profiles anymore, but I do have the transcript saved on my computer, buried in a log folder for my text-to-speech pipeline. It's a kind of horror-fairytale thing: a story about a hermit woman who aspires to be a songwriter. One day, she meets a man who promises to make her famous, but instead, he steals her songs and sells them as his own. He's catapulted into fame and glory while the woman, poor and lonely, spirals into insanity until years later, she kidnaps the man and murders him as penance for his crimes. I'm bringing the following snippet to my meeting with the police tomorrow.

*"… The woman looked at the thief she'd caught. She looked at his hands, at his idle hands that had never known the joy of writing. That had only ever known how to take from others. She thought to herself, 'what's the point of hands that cannot create?' And when she could not think of a suitable answer, she procured a hammer and smashed the thief's hands to pieces. She smashed and smashed and she hummed as she worked, her gentle voice harmonizing with the crisp cracking of idle bones as they splintered into little pieces.* 



*Once the hands resembled slabs of raw meat, the woman looked at the thief she'd caught. She looked at his mouth, at his thieving lips that had never known the joy of singing truth. That had never spoken aloud the meditations of his own soul. She thought to herself, 'what's the point of a voice that can only speak others' words?' And when she could not think of a suitable answer, she procured a funnel and jammed it down the thief's throat. She took a little bottle of cleaning liquid and tipped it towards the mouth of the funnel. She hummed to herself as the bottle drained, her sweet voice rising to drown out the thick sounds of desperate chokes from beneath her, the unpleasant noise of bile bubbling up the funnel stem only to be swallowed back down.* 



*Once the bottle in her hand was empty, the woman looked down at the thief she'd caught. She looked at his head, thinking of a brain that had never known the joy of creation. That had never been used to make something for itself.* 



*She gripped the hammer in her hands. She lined it up with the center of his forehead.* 



*With a few good swings, for the first time in her life, the woman stole something back."*
