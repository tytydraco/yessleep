This is Donovan Jess; it is November 18th, 9 pm. As of now, and moving into the foreseeable future, we cannot allow Victoria onto Socials or online forums. We are not worried about her hurting people, but people hurting her. Having her be of sound mind and body is best when considering our studies. So we have notified everyone close to her, friends and family alike,  she will be away for the time being. There will be no visits, limited mobility, and limited physical contact with her from staff and security. I hope you, the reader, understand why we have implemented these harsher restrictions. It is for the safety of everyone here and the rest of the populace.

With these limitations implemented and acted out, we have also given her a few more freedoms. We are allowing her to work on her commissions to fill up the time. We sent someone to her flat to pick up her drawing tablet, and as I write this, she is making a logo for an oil company in the south. She seems more relaxed and less anxious as well. 

Victoria has been doing well for these past couple of days. We had to move her to a new, smaller room since the "incident" messed up the previous one, but we are working tirelessly to make it livable and better for Victoria once again. With her time being spent drawing or talking to the intercom, she seems to be getting lonely. It is apparent that she is a free spirit and is used to talking with people about her art and hobbies (like most people.) With this observation in mind, we have been considering bringing in a possible therapy pet for her, but that is still a long time from happening. 

She has also requested crayons and soft writing tools for her to use, and we can allow them. So, along with a drawing tablet, she is also occupied by crayon-drawn trees and shrubs on the walls. She expands more on them every few hours, and the walls are honestly looking very pretty right now.

Lily has not shown themselves for the past few days, and I cannot say whether this is good news. The staff and I have discussed possible safety measures to put into place, and we all agreed to put Lily into a smaller, reinforced room whenever they plan to show themselves again. However, there are no absolutes regarding safety when working with Lily, so we are doing our best with the hand we have been given.

We do believe that Lily will show themselves sooner rather than later. We plan to ask her a few argumentative questions once she is secured. Once she does show signs of showing up, I will write more. Until then, we will continue to focus on Victoria's safety and happiness.

One more thing to note. Victoria is still unaware of Lily. We are trying to figure out the best way of telling her while not making anything problematic. She needs to know what is going on; she deserves to know. Once again, I will update you once something worth noting happens.

**November 19th - 12 am**

A few minutes ago, Victoria's phone rang, and she answered it, beginning to talk to her "father." I was planning on telling her about Lily, but that will have to wait. Some security went inside and escorted her to a smaller interrogation room so that we could chat with Lily. We fastened her arms to the desk with a chain, reinforcing them and putting them in a titanium chamber to eliminate arm movement, leaving the phone on speaker for Victoria to keep chatting. 

I just remembered that when we attempted to listen to the call, there appeared to be no audio. Even when the phone is on speaker, there is no noise. It seems Victoria begins to hallucinate the call with her father from the moment she answers the phone. In better words, everything Victoria is experiencing is in her head, slowly spreading through her mind until whatever it is takes over her body.

What I say next is my honest opinion, but I believe Lily is clever. The fact that it can take control of the poor girl shows power. I have a horrible feeling about this up-and-coming interaction. I will be treading carefully with whatever I say to it, aiming to not piss it off. We are not in the presence of anything good, and I plan on learning about what it wants once it takes control.

The phone turned off, and Victoria stopped talking, going into a catatonic state. I am not looking forward to this interaction, but I hope it goes well. In the worst-case scenario, the other specialists said they would lock the door with me inside if she escalated. Hopefully, it does not come to that, but only time will tell.

**November 19th - 1 am**

I had my meeting with Lily. We saved the transcript, so I will put it right below this. The recording takes place right after the moment I sit down:

**Donovan:**   Good Morning, Lily. If you don't mind me asking, how was your sleep?

**Lily:**   Oh, shut up.

**Donovan:**   Why the hostility? I want to have a friendly conversation with you. Do you mind if we talk a tiny bit?

**Lily:**   Sure the fuck doesn't seem like I have a choice, now does it?

**Donovan:**   Sadly, no. My apologies. I simply want to ask you a few questions, and then I'll let you be.

**Lily:**   Fine, whatever. I still have yet to kill you, so by all means, ask away!

**Donovan:**   Thank you. Now, what are your plans here?

**Lily:**   What do you think?

**Donovan:**   Please answer the question.

**Lily:**   Fine, fine. I simply want to watch the world burn.

**Donovan:**   Is that it?

**Lily:**   And cause as much pain as physically possible.

**Donovan:**   Alright...If I may ask, why Victoria?

**Lily:**   Why do you think?

**Donovan:**   Answer the question.

**Lily:**   How is Delilah?

**Donovan:**   What?

**Lily:**   You heard me bitch; how is Delilah?

**Donovan:**   How the fuck-

**Lily:**   Now stop playing this tough boy act with me and be serious. I'm impressed you haven't killed yourself yet\~

\~End Transcript\~

I will be blunt and honest here, no matter the circumstances. There is no feasible way that Lily would be able to know about Delilah. There is no fucking way. But fuck me, apparently. I was wrong.

Some backstory I didn't think I would need to tell. Delilah was my daughter. It was so fucking stupid. We were driving home after a trip to the city. She got a new pair of shoes for school and was wearing them home, happy. I took my eye off the road for one second to look at the radio or a text; something completely fucking stupid. When I looked back up, we were in the other lane. There was a semi in front of us, parked on the side of the road. I don't know why it was there; popped a tire, maybe. But we hit it going sixty miles per hour. 

I was sent to the hospital in critical condition, knocking on death's door. She wasn't so lucky. They had to scrape her off the road since she didn't have her seatbelt. They said she didn't feel anything at all. The impact most likely killed her. But now I have to live while knowing I killed my daughter.

I started drinking every night. I became a mess. My wife left me shortly after. I spiralled so much farther than I have ever spiralled before. I somehow pulled myself out of that slum and managed to stop drinking. I knew I had to keep living, no matter how bad it hurt. So here I am. Judge me all you want; you're not the first to do so. Now you know.

It may be obvious now, but Lily knew. It may be unprofessional to go into details about my life, but not many knew that this happened. I have been a closed-off person even when I had a kid. Even my coworkers didn't know that this happened, so I find it funny that this complete stranger knows. I will express further observations in the future. 

**November 19th - 5am**

Lily has been talking to herself for quite some time. Her words are very cryptic and seem more like a prophetic speech. I am still looking for a source from which her words come from, but they sound almost recited. She has been at it for an hour. I will write down some of the things she says directly below this:

Hold the hand of your dearly beloved, for the end, is neigh. The four will appear before you and lay waste to the puny thing you call a world. Pay homage and repent, for the graciously giving may not be so kind. You are the sin and the disease of a once-perfect world. A cesspool of unfortunates that have been, are, and could be for all of eternity brought to a halt. There is no salvation, no love, only false spoken words and ill intent brought on by the many who believe in hopeful words. Faith is believing in something that isn't visible. That is also called hopeful ignorance. But you are all going towards damnation. A pool of fire and blood that will throw you out before you even make a sound. I am your prophet. Lay down your hands and weep, for there will be Nothing.

**November 19th - 9 am**

We have a huge issue. There is no way to view the room asides from the cameras that line the room's corners. All at once, they turned off for a second before rebooting. When they returned, Victoria was no longer there, and Lily was not there. The room was completely empty. We have kept the door sealed, but I have a horrible feeling about this. 

This may be an unpopular opinion, but at this time, I believe we should neutralize the threat. Once Victoria comes back, destroying her phone may be the best idea. I will update you once she returns to us, but I am uncertain how to feel now.

**November 20th - 12 am**

I am writing this as of November 19th at exactly midnight. I believe the world's end is here, and we have been ignorant. When doing my night watch on Lily, the power went out, and I heard glass shattering everywhere around me. When the power came back on, everything surrounding me was broken. All test tubes, coffee cups, and plates were destroyed. I can no longer hear. 

When referencing the camera feed, the door was open with a pile of bodies in the back corner of the room. When referencing the hallway and faculty cameras, there was blood everywhere. It was horrifying. 

We vastly underestimated Lily's strength. She was choosing to remain here, basically toying with us. In the facility's proximity, I watched as an object launched away at blinding speeds. I believe the thing was Lily. We have failed. 

This will be my final entry. I do not believe that I need to update the world from here on out. The world will see Lily's power. We have lost this battle, and we will suffer tremendous casualties because of it.

She is a devil. I believe that now. We are entirely powerless; even if we tried to kill her, we would have failed. 

I am sorry. I suggest you hide. I suggest you do anything other than scroll through this outlet. We have limited time, so talk to your family, friends, and lovers, and tell them you love them. I am sorry that things went this way. 

Goodbye.
