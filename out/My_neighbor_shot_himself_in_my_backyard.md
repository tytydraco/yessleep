Content Warning: Self-Harm


It was more so the woods behind my house than my backyard I guess. It happened when I was 10. None of us were home when it happened, so it was not traumatic for me or anything like that. I remember looking out my bedroom window at all the policemen walking in and out of the woods for a few days. They would park their cars in our driveway and walk along our fence line. I would watch them walk farther and farther away as their silhouettes lost structure among the leaves.  
 
We weren’t allowed to play back there for a few weeks after. Mom told us the police said it was against the law now, but I overheard her talking to her friend Jan on the phone. The police said that Mr. Roberts was murdered, and they never found the person who did it. They said he was shot a few hundred yards from where they found him. He had left a large trail of blood the entire distance that he walked. They thought he was coming to our house for help. That was the real reason we couldn’t go back. She was afraid that someone would shoot us like they did Mr. Roberts. Turns out she had nothing to worry about. I know Mr. Roberts shot himself.  
 
When our ban on the woods was finally lifted, my brother and I tried our best to hide our excitement. We were young. It was not morbid curiosity but an idyllic view of police and detective work (no doubt driven by an unhealthy obsession with true crime TV) that fueled our desire to return to the woods. It was innocent. We just wanted to play pretend. Aaron wanted to be a cop. I wanted to be a detective. Detective. I fucking hate that word now.
 
We spent the rest of that summer pouring ourselves into our “investigation”. Every day it seemed we were there, notepads in hand, happily spinning our wildest tales about this man’s untimely death. It feels disrespectful now, but we were just kids then. It was all good fun until I found it. Partially protruding from the silty sand of the creek bank, a wooden handle with a polished finish. Aaron was further off in the woods, ranting on about some theory that I admittedly was not listening to. I darted for the handle quickly, not intending to let my fellow officer take any credit for my discovery. I pulled the handle from the mud and with it came the rest of a dark revolver. I stared at it for a minute, feeling nothing, not registering the seriousness of the item I had just found. Like clockwork, my mother’s familiar call rang through the woods. Though this time it seemed… strained? Then the gravity of the situation came upon me like a truck. I threw the gun onto the bank and began sprinting back home. Aaron must’ve heard the difference in her voice as well, as he started his dash as soon as he saw me.
 
We arrived home to Jan in our living room talking with our mother. We were saved. There was no way mom would serve us a lashing with Jan there. We didn’t say a word, just darted to our rooms. I wanted to tell Aaron about what I had found but I knew he wouldn’t believe me unless I showed him. Luckily for me, I would not have to wait long. My room was next to Aarons. On warm summer nights we would whisper to each other from our windows as they were only a few feet apart.
 
“Mike. Mike.”
 
I stuck my head out of my window and looked over, expecting to see Aaron, but he was still inside his room.
 
“What?” I whispered back.
 
“Let’s go back to the woods.” He sounded sheepishly excited.
 
“What? Tonight?” I replied.
 
“Yes. Don’t be chicken. Let’s go right now.”
 
I thought about it for a second. We would get into a ton of trouble if we were caught. However, Aaron was 2 years my senior and I was not going to be the chicken baby brother. So, I responded.
 
“Fine. Let’s go.”
 
“YES.”
 
Aaron’s whisper had almost broken into a full-bodied exclamation of excitement. I wanted to tell him to be quiet, but I didn’t want to ruin the feeling. At that moment I felt really accepted by my big brother. He wanted me to go play with him. It felt good. So, I put on my shoes and slipped downstairs.
 
As I slowly drew the basement door closed, I looked around for Aaron. I didn’t see him anywhere. Had he not made it down yet? I could’ve sworn his bedroom light was off.
 
“Mike!” An excited whisper came from the wood line.
 
I see. Aaron had gone over the fence already. We couldn’t use the gate, we had to climb over next to the house or the flood light would turn on.
 
“Coming!” I called back.
 
As I fumbled over the fence I realized I had not brought my flashlight. It didn’t matter I guess. We couldn’t turn on the lights until we were far enough away from the house that no none could see them, and surely Aaron had brought his. I made my way towards Aaron as my eyes adjusted to the night sky. I could barely even make out his figure in the wood line. As I approached, I realized I wasn’t even walking towards Aaron at all.
 
“Where are you going? This way.” Aaron’s voice called from further into the trees.
 
What I thought was my brother was actually just a bush. This is a normal occurrence in the low light of the woods at night. It’s difficult to see anything really. It’s better to try and rely on your other senses, which I was.
 
“Ok, I’m coming, but would you please slow down?” I pleaded with my brother.
 
A stifled laugh was all the response I would receive, a clear indicator that my brother had picked up on the slight unease I felt about being in the woods at night. I continued to follow his voice through the woods for what felt like ages.
 
“Aaron, please stop or tell me where we are going!” My whisper was gone. We were far enough from the house that I did not need to anymore.
 
“You know where we are going!” His excitement was palpable.
 
My confusion faded as the ground began to slope beneath my feet. I knew where we were now, we were on the bank! We were heading to the creek. Aaron must’ve found the revolver before me and buried it in the sand. That must be why he sounded so excited. That’s why he insisted we come out tonight! He was excited to show me! I still couldn’t see him, but he had to be down near the water.
 
“Aaron I found it too, but I moved it! It should be up on the bank now!”
 
I was met with nothing but the sound of running water. I knew what he would say. Detectives shouldn’t touch evidence, let alone move it.
 
“Please don’t be mad. I’m sorry I moved it, but it’s ok, I know you found it first!”
 
“Mike.”
 
His voice was distant but clear, maybe 20 yards away. He tried to hide it, but I could tell by his voice that he was upset. I turned to my left and started walking towards my brother. I only took a few steps before I started to speak.
 
“Really Aaron I’m so-”
 
“Mike.” Aaron’s voice came from behind this time.
 
My heart sank. I stopped dead in my tracks. The stream muffled some sounds, sure, but there was no way I would not have heard Aaron walk around me like that. Nor could he move that fast.
 
“You passed it Mike.”
 
His words began to echo around me. I couldn’t even tell where his voice was coming from at this point. I spun violently, looking for any visual sign of my brother. I was starting to panic. I was hyperventilating but walked toward his voice. I could feel the pressure of tears building in my throat. I tried my best to sound angry as opposed to scared.
 
Through gritted teeth I responded, “This isn’t funny Aaron, WHERE ARE YOU?”
 
The tears began to fall before my sentence was finished. They rolled down my flushed face, leaving icy lines down my cheeks in the night air. I stood defiantly with clenched fists, not daring to show my fear.
 
“Pick it up, Mike.” Aaron’s voice bounced around the wood line. I was terrified but he sounded lighthearted. Teasing almost.  
 
“Pick what up?!” I snapped back into the darkness.
 
“Don’t you get an attitude with me, mister! Now pick. It. Up.”
 
All of my faux confidence fell in an instant. That wasn’t my brother’s voice. It was my mother’s.
 
“Mom?”
 
Her response never came. Instead, another voice.
 
“Listen to your mother, son. Go on. Pick it up.”
 
“Dad? What is everyone doing out here? Why isn’t th-”
 
“Pick it up, pick it up, PICK IT UP!”
 
A cacophony of a thousand voices screamed into my ears as I dropped to my knees. They came from every direction. They pierced the palms I used to shield my ears. I contorted my face and held my eyes shut as I rocked on the ground, waiting for it to end. The voices that had just spoken as one were now rambling separately. They all blended together like a crowd at an event but yet were also so distinct that any single one of them could have been right next to me. I rocked and I waited.
 
Except it was not ending.
 
“Eyes are shut. Open eyes. Eyes OPEN. EYES OPEN!” One voice turned to many as they all slowly joined in on barking their command in unison. I couldn’t take it. I opened my eyes and the crowd cheered.
 
There before me on the ground between my knees was the revolver.
 
“PICK IT UP!” they cried.
 
They screamed and wailed in agony and excitement as I brought my trembling hand to the cold steel. As my finger brushed the barrel, in what would turn out to be an incredibly cruel twist of fate, everything went silent.
 
I didn’t understand at the time, but I do now. I know that Mr. Roberts was not murdered in the woods behind my house. I know that he killed himself, and I understand why. I understand why he shot himself out here, and why he threw the gun in the creek. I understand why he fled as far away from that thing as possible before he finally succumbed to his injuries. I know he wanted to be found, and I understand why he didn’t want anyone to find the weapon. I understand that like Mr. Roberts, I will have to touch this weapon at all times for the rest of my life.
 
But unlike Mr. Roberts, I understand that it is not picky. A spring, a pin, a chip of wood from the old, polished handle, it makes no difference. As long as I hold a piece of that vile earplug it will hold them at bay. It will silence the crowd. I do not know if it will last forever. I am 26 now. I have told no one except you all, with nothing but a hope for a similar experience. Someone to share in my existence. I will be honest; I have lost hope that someone can free me from this thing, but if you have any ideas, I’d love to hear them.
 
Before you say it, no, I will not listen to the voices. I will not end up like Mr. Roberts.
