I still cannot believe that Lena is gone. Her passion for antique shopping was unparalleled; she had an eye for uncovering treasures forgotten by time. It was last month when she stumbled upon an ornate, full-length mirror in the attic of her mother's house. Its frame, meticulously crafted, bore faces that seemed to shift and change with the light, a mesmerising and eerie feature that fascinated Lena to no end. She insisted on bringing it home to showcase its unique beauty, and I, too, was captivated by its allure.

The first inkling that something was amiss came when Lena began mentioning an unsettling sensation. She confided in me, expressing how the reflection sometimes appeared distorted—the angles skewed, the lighting unnaturally dim or bright. I chuckled at first, attributing it to her vivid imagination running wild amidst her newfound excitement. Yet, her unease persisted, culminating in a late-night call filled with tremors in her voice. Lena confessed that she had witnessed her reflection blink when she had not, sending shivers down her spine.

The next morning, I hurried over to her flat, determined to calm her fears and unravel the mystery surrounding the mirror. Upon entering her bedroom, I, too, felt an oppressive chill emanating from the mirror's presence. It stood there, uncovered, a silent sentinel casting an eerie ambience over the room. Despite my attempts to reassure her, I could not shake the feeling that something unnatural lurked within its glassy depths. Reluctantly, Lena agreed to cover it, seeking respite from its unsettling influence. However, the fear etched in her eyes remained, a haunting testament to the mirror's ominous allure.

Days passed, and then a week later, Lena vanished without a trace. Her flat remained locked from within, the only lingering clue—a mirror standing ominously uncovered in her deserted room. The authorities found no signs of struggle, no evidence of foul play, leading them to speculate that Lena had chosen to disappear voluntarily. But I knew better. The mirror held secrets beyond our comprehension, secrets that had ensnared Lena in its sinister grip.

Driven by an insatiable need for answers, I returned to Lena's flat, drawn inexplicably to the mirror that had claimed her. Standing before it once more, a chill crept down my spine as I beheld my reflection. For an unsettling moment, I swore I glimpsed Lena's terrified visage staring back at me, trapped within the mirror's otherworldly realm.

Suddenly, the lights flickered and died, plunging the room into an inky blackness that seemed to pulse with malevolent intent. Panic seized me as I fumbled for my phone, desperate for a source of light in the consuming darkness. When I finally managed to illuminate the room, the mirror's reflection had changed. No longer did I see my own face staring back at me; instead, a grotesque caricature grinned unnervingly, its eyes glinting with malice.

Fear-stricken, I staggered backwards, tripping over an unseen obstacle and crashing to the floor. In that moment of terror, I saw it—Lena's hand emerging from the mirror, fingers outstretched as if beckoning me into its sinister depths.

The last remnants of consciousness faded as I heard Lena's voice, a chilling whisper echoing in the recesses of my mind: "You brought it here. Now it's your turn to stay."

When morning dawned, they found me unconscious amidst the shattered remnants of the mirror. Lena, however, remained missing, her fate intertwined with the mirror's insidious influence. Now, haunted by guilt and terror, I know that Lena's reflection endures within the mirror's frame, trapped in eternal torment, a grim reminder of the darkness that lurks beyond our reality. And each time I gaze into a mirror, I see her pleading eyes watching, waiting—a silent testament to the price of curiosity and the allure of forgotten treasures.
