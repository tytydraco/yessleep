One day. i heared a knock on my door, i look out of the window expecting to see a delivery man as i ordered a T-shirt 3 days ago, it should have arrived that day, but i instead see a 6 foot tall duck holding a package, i was very confused about why is there a duck here instead of a delivery man, but i decided to take the package anyway, i opened the door, and took the package, expecting my T-shirt that i ordered to be in it, but as i opened it, i saw a potato instead of a T-shirt, i was very confused and decided to return the package, but it was too late and the duck left already. i thought to myself: "This is probably a prank or something." i grabbed the potato and stored it, but as i tried to grab it, it somehow, turned into a paper note, i was extremely confused and shocked, i went to read the note, it said:

"Attention! Your area in reality is very unstable, it is highly recommended to leave this area otherwise you might get teleported to another dimension." i was even more confused when i read the note, "How did the potato turn into this note?? and what did it mean by "Your area in reality is unstable"? And who wrote this message?"

i decided to pack my stuff and move out, but during that, a sinkhole suddenly formed below me, it formed too fast for me to react, and i fell, while in panic, i was falling for about 15 minutes until i hit the ground, somehow with no injuries, and it seemed to be that i was in a huge, neverending forest, i panicked, while searching for my phone, but i couldn't find it at all, i screamed "HELP!"

but no one answered. i walked around for a bit, still in panic, until i decided to make a tent with the leaves and sticks, i took some leaves from a tree and a few sticks, and built a tent, i went inside it to relax, i stayed there for what seemed to be 30 minutes, but i had no sense of time there. i left the tent and explored for a bit, then suddenly, the sky turned orange, huge spinning cog wheels in the sky emerged out of nowhere, and the whole world turned foggy, i got scared, but also confused, i walked a bit more until a 7 foot tall zombie duck spawned out of nowhere.

then it started chasing me, i ran with all my power, but it didn't seem to lose sight of me. i saw a small cave in the distant, i ran towards it and hid in it, but suddenly, i got teleported out of it.

i saw the zombie duck behind me, then ran again, i ran for what seems to be a mile until it lost sight of me, i stopped, while heavily panting, then the sky returned normal, i was relived, i sat on the ground and relaxed for some time, then i just realized how thirsty i was.

i looked around for a pond, i saw one, but it seemed to be glowing orange, and also purple at the same time, i was confused about why is that pond glowing. i looked around for another pond, but suddenly, the first pond i saw turned normal.

i got even more confused, but decided to go to it. i walked to it and grabbed a small stone mug and scooped the water and drank some, it felt oddly refreshing, and cold, it tasted like normal filtered water. i was also hungry, though there wasn't a single edible thing in sight.
 
i walked for some time, and while i was walking, a strange, black creature that looks like a fox, suddenly spawned out of nowhere, it seemed to be standing on 2 legs, i got jumpscared by it, but then i realized it was offering me a strange looking knock-off of a can of Pepsi that seemed to be named "Pepis", it looked pretty interesting, so i took it, then the fox creature vanished, and i opened the soda can, i drank it, and it tasted very weird, kinda like chicken with a bit of apple. i drank it all.

then threw the can away. i kept walking for a bit, until i saw a small dining table with a single chair, it seemed to have a whole dish with uneaten food that seems fresh.

i looked around for anybody, confused. i decided to eat the food, it tasted normal. after some time, i finished it, i left and kept exploring the area. 

until i found a strange sock that looked familiar, as if it was from my childhood, i was confused, but i investigated it, and remembered that it was my sock that i lost back in the normal reality about 9 years ago. i was very confused about how it even got here, the sock also didn't smell bad at all,.i decided to take it and put it in my pocket, i kept exploring until i got teleported to a strange looking lab, i looked around and saw a man, i was in shock, i asked the man:

"Who are you? and why am i here??", he responded with "Hello, im James, this is a lab where i try experiments. I bringed you here because you were the only human i could detect here." i was in confusion.

i said to him "Experiments for what?" he responded with "That's none of your business." he seemed to be typing in a weird keyboard while looking at a large screen, he said "Would you like to help me Un-corrupt this world?" i decided to say Yes. 

He said "Come here." i came to him, confused about all this weird tech he uses. i said "So what do i do exactly?" before he is able to respond to me, i suddenly get grabbed by a huge wolf looking creature, then it brings me to a strange neverending grass field with a few wood towers, and there were 3 huge zombie ducks, all of them had 6 heads, 4 legs, 4 wings, and each wing was a chainsaw, their teeth were a meat grinder, i was in heavy panic, the zombie ducks seemed to talk to each other in a strange language that i couldn't understand.

then suddenly, i get teleported back to Jame's lab, he said to me: "Where were you?" i responded, "i got grabbed by a huge wolf looking creature, then it took me to a grass field where there were 3 huge zombie ducks each having 6 heads, 4 legs and 4 wings, each wing had a chainsaw, and their teeth were a meat grinder" he said, while in shock "I think those are the reality 
warpers." i responded to him: "Reality Warpers?? Who are they??" he responded to me "The creatures that corrupted this world." i responded to him "Well i guess seeing them is not good.." i also asked him:

"Also how did you get here? and who made this lab?" he tried to respond, but before he was able to, the world crumbles, and it becomes a huge void that never ends. i was in extreme panic, but i couldn't do anything about it, and i was there for years and years, until i suddenly got teleported back to the normal reality, and continued my normal life....
