I never thought I would set foot in a place like this. After ten countries, hundreds of cities, and countless villages, I thought I had seen everything strange. But no, this village... was different.

The road to the village was bumpy, and full of potholes and rocks. I had to hire an old pickup truck with a local driver to get here. The driver, an old local man, only smiled mysteriously when I asked about the village. I tried to get more information from him, but all I got was a smirk and a few sentences in the local language that I could not understand.

When I arrived, it was already dusk. This small village was located close to the border of a neighboring country, on a high hill, surrounded by dense forest. The cold crept into every corner, even though it was only the beginning of autumn. The first feeling when entering the village was a strange silence. No children's laughter, no old people's murmurings sitting around the fire. There was only the sound of the wind whistling through the trees and my footsteps on the narrow path.

There was something... unusual about this village. I wasn't sure what it was, but that feeling haunted me from the moment I stepped in. The houses in the village were built of wood, most of them were old, with roofs thatched with dry leaves. The surrounding space was gloomy, the flickering lights from a few scattered houses were not enough to dispel the thick darkness that was enveloping.

I came here at the invitation of Lee, an old friend I met at university. Lee was an international student in the Archaeology department at my school, we became friends by chance in the Culture & Religion Club and quickly became close. After graduation, although we had to part ways to return to our hometowns, Lee and I still kept in touch via WhatsApp. Lee had told me about this village, about the spiritual culture that I had never heard of. He said that if I wanted to understand the local culture, I needed to come here, to experience everything that this village had to offer. And as usual, I could not refuse the invitation to a new adventure.

Lee had prepared a place for me to stay in a local family's house. The host was a thin old lady with a gentle smile but her eyes contained something that I could not guess. She did not say much, just led me into the room, put down my luggage, and left an oil lamp with the instruction not to leave the house after dark.

The first night, I lay on the rickety bamboo bed, the sound of insects chirping outside the window. I could not sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the darkness outside the window moving, as if something was watching me from afar.

With each passing minute, the feeling of unease in my heart grew. I had been to many strange places, and faced challenges that ordinary people would not dare to think of. But something here... It made me feel uneasy.

Maybe it was just that I was tired after a long day of traveling. But what if it wasn't?

I decided to stand up and look out the window. The scenery was dim in the moonlight. Suddenly, I noticed a shadow passing by. I quickly opened my eyes, but all I could see were trees swaying in the wind. Nothing.

But I knew I wasn't wrong. Something was out there, in the darkness. And it was waiting.
