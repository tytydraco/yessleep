“Look, Jen, all I’m saying is that you’re a great girl. Kenny was an idiot. You don’t need that cheating slimeball. The world is your oyster.”  
  
“I know, I know. I just can’t believe he’d do something like that. I mean, we’d been dating for three years. We were living together for, fuck’s sake,” I seethed, pounding my glass onto the counter.  
  
The bartender glared at me. I mouthed an unapologetic “sorry.”  
  
“I think you should get back at him. Find a hot guy and post him on your Snapchat story. That’ll really get him fired up.”  
  
“Karah, it’s been a week. It’s still raw I- hey! Can I get another whiskey sour?”  
  
The bartender begrudgingly poured my drink as I slapped a ten onto the weathered hardwood.   
  
“As I was saying, revenge isn’t really my top priority at the moment.”  
  
“That’s a real shame because leather jacket over there can’t seem to take his eyes off you.”  
  
I glanced to the opposite side of the room. She was right. A tall blonde man with round-rimmed glasses was staring at me from across the bar. His chiseled jawline was sharp enough to slice the thick smoke-riddled air as he quickly averted his gaze.  
  
“I’ll give it to him. He’s cute. But there’s a lot of emotions that I still have to work through. I’m not ready to start anything with someone new just yet.”  
  
Karah pursed her lips.  
  
“I understand. Healing takes time. But you’d better think quickly because that guy is heading over here.”  
  
I glanced up. The man was swimming through the sea of patrons like a shark circling its prey.   
  
“No, no, no. Karah, you have to help me get out of this.”  
  
“Sure thing, bestie,” she smirked, flashing me a wink.   
  
“This seat taken?”  
  
“Um, actually-”  
  
“No, it’s all yours,” Karah interjected, cutting me off completely.  
  
I scowled at her.   
  
“So, what are your names?”  
  
“I’m Jen and this is Karah. What’s yours?”  
  
“Wayne.”  
  
“Nice to make your acquaintance, but we-”  
  
“Really cool to meet you, Wayne! Tell us about yourself.”  
  
I leaned directly into Karah’s ear.  
  
“You seriously need to quit doing that. You’re really starting to piss me off,” I hissed, growing more irritated by the second.  
  
“Before I go into that, can I interest either of you in a drink?”  
  
“No, I’ve got one right here. And I don’t accept drinks from strangers.”  
  
He turned to Karah.  
  
“No, I’m good. I’m actually about to take a smoke break. I’ll be right back.”  
  
My eyes tracked Karah across the room until she disappeared outdoors, leaving me alone with Wayne.  
  
“Damnit, Karah. I swear, I’m going to kill you when we get out of here,” I thought, vowing to keep my promise on that.  
  
“So, tell me. How did a pretty little thing like yourself end up at a grungy dive bar on a Thursday night?”  
  
I shifted my gaze to my glass, watching as the light brown liquid swirled around like a miniature whirlpool.   
  
“My boyfriend and I broke up about a week ago,” I muttered despondently before downing half my drink.   
  
I grimaced as the liquor burned my insides like a wildfire.   
  
“I’m sorry to hear that. I’ve had my fair share of breakups. They’re not fun.”  
  
“That’s the understatement of the century,” I scoffed as I polished off the remainder of the whiskey.  
  
“You know, I bet I could take your mind off it. At least for the night.”  
  
I furrowed my brow apprehensively. A nauseating sense of unease washed over me like a tidal wave. I suddenly didn’t feel comfortable around this man anymore.  
  
“What do you mean by that?”  
  
He held two fingers up to his lips in a V shape and wiggled his tongue between them in a lewd gesture. I wanted to throw up.   
  
“That’s really gross, you sick bast- oh.”  
  
My head spun violently as I tried to stand, the room before me blending into an indistinguishable amalgamation of colors and shapes. I crumpled into the waiting arms of Wayne.   
  
“Don’t worry, I’ve got you. Everything will be alright.”  
  
I glanced up at him, my face contorted in a cocktail of confusion and terror. His features were a blur, melting into the world around me. I swear for a second, I could see red flash across his pupils. Then everything went dark.  
  
  
\*\*\*  
  
I awoke in a strangely familiar room. A raging thunderstorm in my head sent shockwaves of pain rippling through me. As I gradually regained my clarity and my mental fog began to dissipate, I drank in my surroundings. I was lying in a bed. A man was rolled onto his side facing the wall. My heart dropped into my stomach. I’d recognize those broad shoulders anywhere. Sleeping soundly next to me was Kenny.   
  
That was impossible. I’d broken up with him last week. Maybe Karah had something to do with this? She did always say that Kenny and I were made for each other. I had no earthly idea what was going on, but I needed answers.  
  
“Kenny. Kenny, wake up!” I hissed, jabbing him in the back.   
  
He groggily stretched his arms over his head and turned to me with that same sleepy look that I’d always adored.   
  
“Morning, babe. How’d you sleep?” he croaked as he leaned in to plant a kiss on my cheek.  
  
I quickly whipped my head away. He scrunched up his face.  
  
“What’s wrong? Morning breath?” he chuckled, settling into a resting position against the headboard.   
  
What was going on? He had to be screwing with me, right?  
  
“Kenny, you cheated on me. I dumped you last week. You know that. Why are you acting like we’re still together? And how did I get here?”  
  
“You’re joking, right? Jen, I would never do that. I don’t know what you’re talking about. We had a movie marathon last night, remember? I can’t believe you’d accuse me of something so… so disgusting.”  
  
I stared into his deep blue eyes. He looked hurt. Like a child who’d dropped his ice cream cone. I could read that man like a book, and to my utter shock, he seemed genuine. No. I wasn’t crazy. I had proof.   
  
“Oh, yeah? Well, how do you explain this?” I said, scrolling through my phone.   
  
I couldn’t find them. The screenshots. They were gone. I searched everywhere: my photo gallery, my texts to Karah, my deleted pictures. There was no evidence.   
  
“Give me your phone.”  
  
“What? Why?”  
  
“Kenny, if you really trust me, give me your phone.”  
  
“Okay. You’re not going to find anything, though,” he huffed, handing it over.  
  
I typed in his passcode and read through his texts, his DM’s, everything. Not a single message out of line. Then, I stopped on my own name. I read through a conversation that I’d definitely never had.   
  
Hey babe, still on for 7 tonight?  
  
Yep. I can’t wait (;  
  
Me neither. See ya then. I love you, Jen Jen.  
  
I love you too, Ken Ken!  
  
I wanted to vomit. Not at the admittedly cringey texts themselves, but at the notion that maybe he was right. Maybe I did send those messages. But the previous week. I didn’t just make that up. I couldn’t have. The breakup, the bar, Wayne. That wasn’t all in my head. Was it? I was seriously beginning to doubt myself. I tossed Kenny’s phone back to him.   
  
“I know who can clear this up,” I said, dialing Karah’s number.  
  
“Suit yourself if you don’t believe me. She’s just going to tell you the same things I am.”  
  
Karah picked up on the third ring.  
  
“What’s the deal, Jen? It’s eight in the morning.”  
  
“Look, Karah, I’m going to ask you something, and I need you to be completely honest with me.”  
  
“Always. Shoot.”  
  
“I broke up with Kenny last week. Do you remember that?”   
  
“I don’t think so. Why’d you do that?”  
  
Kenny pursed his lips and crossed his arms. My heart began palpitating wildly.  
  
“Never mind. Forget I asked. One more thing. Was I with you last night?”  
  
“Yeah, you were with me.”  
  
Aha! There it was. I wasn’t losing my mind.  
  
“You were with me until you left for Kenny’s around seven.”  
  
Or maybe I was.   
  
“Thanks, Karah. I’ll let you get back to sleep now. See ya.”  
  
Kenny glowered at me disapprovingly.  
  
“I told you nothing was going on,” he said as he stormed to the bathroom.  
  
I tried to stop him. To apologize. To grovel for his forgiveness. But the words died on my lips. That was an hour ago. Kenny still hasn’t come out of the bathroom. Am I having some sort of psychotic break? How could I fabricate an entire week’s worth of memories? If it really was in my head and Kenny stayed faithful, I don’t want to throw away a three year relationship over some false accusations.  
  
I’m still confused as all get out. I was truly starting to believe that I was in the wrong. But now I’m not so sure. My frantic search for answers brought me to the waste bin beside Kenny’s nightstand. Inside lay a single crumpled piece of paper that simply read:  
  
*You owe me - Wayne.*
