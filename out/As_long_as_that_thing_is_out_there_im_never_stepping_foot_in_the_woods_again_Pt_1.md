So I want to start off by saying, I am…
Or... I was the outdoorsman of our friend group.  
I made it a point to bring up some fact or piece of information
 pertaining to hiking or camping in every conversation. Looking back it…
 was probably annoying but that’s beside the point. 
The main thing is I used to love the woods, hiking, and I was very informed. But after last year I don’t think I’ll ever go back into the woods again. 

It was the last month of summer and already the cool chill of the midwest was closing in. The rare triple digit days of heat had finally given in to the nice cool mid to low 80’s. This was usually my favorite time to make one last hike or camping trip before returning to college. 
I was sitting in my ford escape, an old tan SUV that got me anywhere I needed it to, and listening to my pandora playlist. A notification popped onto my phone and read. 

“Sorry Matt, I wont be able to make it, my girlfriend is really on my back about spending time before I go.” 

JEEZ! Of the time to flake out, you choose the last minute? Literally the day of? Good job David.

“Yeah thats cool. Peace.” I sent back quickly, throwing my phone into the centre console. I’d been waiting for 10 minutes already and could have already been on the road north. 
I gripped my steering wheel tightly and turned up my music as I began the 124 mile drive north to where I would be doing my hike. 
Sure I was upset, but I had camped alone before and this would be fine. I wasn't too worried about going alone because I am a 22 years old male and in pretty good shape, plus I had just gotten my carry permit so I wouldn't be going completely defenceless. You know Perhaps this was even better, I wouldn't have to wait or slow my pace for someone unused to walking in the woods. 
I just wished David had told me sooner, so I could have maybe talked another reluctant friend into joining me. 

My thoughts turned towards the day ahead of me as I eased into my drive, It was an easy drive to put lightly. Besides one or two towns it was a straight shot nothing but farmland and lakes that eventually gave way to the forest. 
I arrived at my destination 3 hours later, a small Trailhead that besides a few sedans and a small white minivan was empty. I smiled as I pulled in and parked, I had been coming here the past few years for this reason alone. Nearly empty was the best news I could have gotten, it meant Less competition for good spots to camp later on and fewer odds of awkward small talk with a weirdo on the trails.

I began unpacking my car with the necessary equipment, stopping on a few items like the radio and beer. No real use hauling the radio if it was just me going alone. The beer though, It wouldn't hurt to bring a few cans for the night. I checked the Garmin Etrex and spare battery, and they were both full. With this GPS I could find my way anywhere in the woods, which made going alone all the more safer. I popped my handgun from its concealed case under my driver's seat and after securing it to my waist I felt ready to go.

I turned towards where the common trail started and took a step. Wait a minute. who was that? About 40 feet off to the right of the trail I thought I saw someone standing in the woods, just standing there looking at me. I waved and squinted my eyes, trying to get a better idea of what they were doing just standing there. 
 “Yo, uh how are the trails today?” I called toward the person, a little weirded out.

The figure in the woods jumped, obviously startled, and turned. 
“Dude you scared the rest of my piss out of me!” came the voice of a guy who sounded to be in his mid-twenties. The person shook up and down once and adjusted something near their waistband and began walking towards me. 
I sighed a deep sigh of relief as they got closer, it was a young man probably only a year or two older than me who had his hat on backwards, he had not been staring at me, but obviously had been using the bathroom way to close to the main trail.  

“Sorry about that, I thought I walked far enough in.” Said the guy now 10 feet away from me now smiling sheepishly. 

“No problem.” I said making note of the guys casual attire, He was wearing jeans and running shoes with a graphic tee under a flannel shirt. Obviously a new hiker but he had the right idea. 

“You out here alone?” I asked putting my hand out for a fist bump.

“Yeah, kinda, my boys got here last night and are somewhere off the trail up ahead. I literally just got here man, the drive almost put me to sleep.” Said the guy returning the fist bump.
“Im Jasen.” 

“My name is Matt.”  “We can do the first leg of the hike together if you want.” I offered with a smile. This guys seemed cool enough and was definitely not a weirdo, just a bro.

“Dude, that would be great. Honestly the woods alone freak me out.” replied Jasen now his turn to give a sigh of relief. 

“Do you know where they are?” I asked as we began walking towards the trailhead across the lot.
 “Kinda, they said near the steps like 7 hours in.” the guy said looking up as he thought.

I knew instantly what Jasen meant, about 18 miles into the trail there were a set of stairs that no one really knows how they got there. It is the only reason anyone ever comes to this trail, to begin with. Most people think a rare tornado blew them in from someone's house, but they always seemed too intact for me to believe that.
Either way we had a good distance hike ahead of us, and with it nearing noon we wouldnt get there till near dusk so we headed out. 

Me and Jasen talked a bit as we walked, he showed me his can of bear spray and seemed very proud of it. Like a kid with a toy. I remember my first few hikes and camping trips and honestly I get it. Every piece of equipment is a new memory to bond with out in the woods. It’s hard to explain but there is something really comforting about having literally everything on your back.
I finally get it Dora. 
 

On this bathroom break Jasen came back eyes wide though. 
“Oh man you are gonna want to see this dude. Its mad gross though.” He made a face of both disgust and intrigue. 
Call me curious I followed him off the trail and into the woods. We walked only about 30 seconds before the smell hit me. Like a mix of bad cheese and sewer gas the smells of decay hit me harder than a punch from a professional boxer. I instantly started to gag. 
“I know dude, this stuff is rancid smelling, I thought it was my pee at first.” Said Jasen pulling his shirt over his nose.
I did the same and it helped a little bit but the smell was still horrid, the worst thing I ever smelled, even to this day. 
“Right over here dude.” Led Jasen as he walked behind a tree. 
I followed unsure of what could be causing such a horrible crime against my senses. I soon had my answer. 

A pit 20 feet wide and at least 7 feet deep was in front of us. The sheer size of the pit made me gasp, inviting in more of the putrid smell. What was inside the pit was even worse. Dozens, and I mean dozens of dead animals littered the pit, some missing heads, limbs or just torn to bits lined the floor of the pit. The smell was bad but seeing this was worse. I instantly turned away fighting my urge to yell and scream I could hear Jasen following me as I walked away. 

“What- What is that Jasen?” I half gagged half yelled. Putting my hand on the rough bark of a tree to support my shaking legs. 

“I dunno dude, stuff is wild tho man.” Jasen said like an excited child who found a lost puppy. “You think it could be illegal hunters?”  His voice getting hushed as he put a comforting hand on my shoulder. 
“I- I dont know man, Let’s get away from here before I hurl.” I spoke threateningly. Because at this point I was liable to give my breakfast to the ground.

Jasen nodded and we quickly made our way back to the trail. We were quiet until we reached the familiar dirt pathway and Jasen broke the silence.
“Sorry Matt, I didnt mean to upset you. Honest it grossed me out to but I think my adrenaline kicked in. And dont worry I wont tell the guys.” Jasen smiled at me.

“It’s alright, and what do you mean tell the guys?” I questioned turning towards Jasen now. He was standing looking down the trail as I caught up. 

“I mean what, you arnt seriously gonna stay out here alone are you?” Jasen asked looking surprised now. 

“No, I mean, thanks man. You don’t even know me though. What if I was a serial killer or something?” I spoke giving him a crazy grin. To be honest I was glad Jasen had offered, after seeing that pit spending a night alone was the last thing I wanted to do. Who knew if those crazy Poachers were still out here. 

“If you were a serial killer, I’d just hit you with the limited edition Axe body spray here and give you a new glasses prescription.” Teased Jasen tossing his bear spray into the air and catching it like a cowboy with a six shooter. He winked at me and started walking again.

As we began the hike again I pulled out my Garmin and made a note of the location, as soon as I got home I would make a report to United States Forest Service. 

The rest of the hike was thankfully uneventful, Jasen needing to stop only once more and apologizing when he did.
