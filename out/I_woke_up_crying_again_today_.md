I’ve been nocturnal my entire life, like my dad before me, I sleep better when the sun is up. I lost my father last March and my sister in November. I’m used to dreaming about them. It’s a normal way to process grief. 

My uncle moved my grandma in with him, liquidated her life and shut off communication between her and I. She practically raised me. I love her like a mother. My dad took care of my grandma because she had dementia, and he never did much with his life beside staying with her. When he passed away, my uncle swept in and I was grieving too much to see what was happening. The next thing I know, I’m being accused of spending my grandmas savings, and I’m cut out of her life while he sells her house and moved her away. 

I think she’s trying to reach me though. 

I used to dream that I would go back to my grandmas house, and my dad would be there. He would try to convince me that he wasn’t dead. He’d always look disheveled, practically homeless. He’d explain that there was no cremation, it was a mistake. That when he woke up, everyone was gone and he had no way of finding us. It would start to make sense to me (maybe he didn’t have my cellphone number memorized, maybe he had to money and no way to reach me because I had sold his car? Etc) then the dream would end. 

I dream rarely of my sister, who often spent time in cemeteries cleaning graves, when she wasn’t using drugs. The meth use kept her on the streets and she loved it. When my dad passed, I let her take whatever she wanted. She saw value in everything, I just wanted it to be over with. We ended up throwing a lot away and she resented me for it. Like I said though, she was homeless with no way to store someone’s entire life. It had to go. When she was passing, I held her hand and she apologized through whatever dream was carrying her over. I miss her and I hope she found her peace. 

I don’t think my grandma is at peace because I woke up crying today, snot bubbling from my nose. I dreamt that I was on a work trip. I was in a rental truck somewhere in the mountains. They kept sending my $50 gas cards. Ya know, dream nonsense. But my grandma was there. 

Some unseen power was presenting her with truths and lies about her life. These were visually represented by symbols on a tablet. One of the symbols was two parallel lines. When a truth was asked about me, she’d choose the lines and it would hurt her. I was watching her being punished for remembering me. “They punish her when she picks the lines. The lines are the truth”, kept repeating in my head to the point that it became a mantra. I woke up and said it out loud and realized that the tears and snot from my dreams had followed me into the waking world. It took an hour to calm myself down. 

I have no way of knowing if she’s alright, or if she even remembers me, but I hope she knows that the lines are the truth. 




I love you, grandma.
