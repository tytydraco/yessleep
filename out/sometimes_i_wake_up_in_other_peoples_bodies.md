i remember the first time it happened. its odd coming out of the swirl of sleep and feeling so completely not yourself. i think for a few minutes i just laid there with my eyes closed. i felt heavy, and my gut was all blocked up in a way it never had been before. *this isnt my ceiling*, had i been picked up and moved somewhere else? even the sun felt wrong. glaring at me from the east facing window, out of which i could see the cookie cutter suburbia. not too different from my own home, at least superficially, but everything was rearranged, the grass seemed a different shade. and the road curved all wrong. it was all wrong all of it. 

it wasnt that i didnt fit my surroundings. i did, it was clearly my home. the bed i lay in had been slept in so much it had taken in my shape. or at least whoever i was shape. i looked down. i had breasts, which i had never had before. heavy breasts that sagged and were spotted with age. i was wearing very little. she was wearing very little, just a bra and panties. it didnt turn me on or anything. i dont think it would have had i been beautiful and young and curvy. i felt so female all of a sudden, so old, so revolted by my own body. *am i dreaming?* no. never in any dream had i wondered if i were dreaming. and everything was too tangible, too solid. 

i got up and made my way to the master bathroom. i stared horrified into that mirror, seeing the ghastly black raisin eyes looking despondently back, my flesh was crawling like a thousand millipedes were having an orgy under my liver spots and wrinkles. i think in the moment, i understood the plight of those who were born with the wrong gender configuration. those who had definite male souls under the weight of a female body. or vice versa. for me there was a sense of deep wrongness, a dissonance between the reality of being in this old gray meatsack i so clearly was in, and yet being aware of the distinct, and different outline of my soul. 

i had quite gotten used to being young and believe me, quite good looking. *oh god i hope im not stuck like this forever.* i pulled at my thin lips, i dug my fingernails into my cheek. i could definitely feel that, though in a very detached way. the white imprints of my fingernails remained on my cheek as i pulled away from the mirror. 

maybe if i went back to sleep i would wake up and i would have my penis back and everything would be ok. i sat down heavily on the side of the bed. under the impulse of wanting to return to sleep and out of sheer muscle memory i felt the body i inhabited open a drawer on the pale blue nightstand next to me and grasp a bottle. as i removed it it rattled, full of chalky orange pentagons. i took two, dry swallowing them. that was a mistake. they stuck in my old throat and i nearly hacked up blood. 

i lay there with my eyes closed and let a heavy, chemical drowsiness pull me back into dreamland. seemingly instantly i awoke and i was back in my own body. my girlfriend hovering over me, her face taut with worry. apparently i had been sporadically twitching in my sleep, and had been completely unresponsive for like, fifteen minutes she said. my heart barely even beating. she had been about to call 911 she said. 

at the time i just shrugged it off as an odd dream, even though my memory of the few minutes i spend as a fat old woman was more vivid than any dream id ever had. i think i had no other way to rationalize the experience.

the second time, several weeks later, it was worse. i opened my eyes to a prison cell on a cot next to a piss filled toilet with a guard screaming at me to get the fuck out of bed and put on my fucking pants. i spend the morning and subsequent day just following the habits of the body i was in. i found out my name was hector. apparently he had done something particularly nasty, as hector did not seem to have any friends. no one sat with him at any meals. i became conscious of the looks of disgust that would flit across other guys faces when i met eyes. 

later, in a bathroom, still in a daze, i felt someone grab my hair and slam my head against the nearest urinal. pain was an odd sensation, the tickle of blood trickling down my cheek and the hot, throbbing agony of a forehead wound seemed distant. not really mine to experience. i turned around and stared straight at the chest hair of some obscenely tall skinhead. *hey asshole*. he said, and punched me in the stomach. *you think you can just fuck a little kid like that, huh asshole, i heard you cooked and ate him after it. he mustve been pretty fucking young if you could fit him in a pot and boil him like that, hey you fucking cunt, you pig.* he grabbed my head. a handful of hector's stringy black hair, and bashed it on the cold porcelain several more times. *even in here we have standards. asshole. you think you can mingle with us all huh, like we're equals huh? puta. bitch. i want to kill you but i wont yet, i think ill just scramble your brains a little.* i was losing consciousness, an angry face swam formless and abstract in my vision. my head hid the urinal again, extra hard this time. everything went dark.

i woke in my bed, alone, with my head throbbing. it was around four oclock or so. later that night, under the haze of painkillers, i tried to look up any hectors that may have been arrested for heinous, hideous things. i found several, and one looked just like me. just like me in the dream, or whatever it was id gone through. hector de la cruz. the news report said he had been brutally assaulted in a prison bathroom, hospitalized, and had ultimately passed away. it seemed like the angry skinhead had not kept his word. a chill ran down my spine as i read the article. that had been me for a few hours, or at least i think it had been.

i remembered being an old woman, no longer thinking it was a dream.  i wondered if it would happen again to me. i desperately hoped it wouldnt. i wondered if i should see a doctor. ultimately i didn't. what would i have even said. 

i spend a whole day as an assembly line worker in asia. at the break of dawn i was shunted out of bed by my irritating and anxious wife. i did not understand the language. i was poked and prodded into getting on a train and following a horde of people to a gray factory. there were nets all along its perimeter about three quarters of the way up the walls. i wondered if they were there to stop people form jumping off the roof. 

i tried to hide and curl into a ball, because i didnt know where to go, or what to do. i was quickly found out, and dragged to my feet by a man with a white collared shirt and a greasy combover. i was told quite a few things in what could have been mandarin, or taiwanese, or vietnamese, or korean. i wondered if i had hurt the social standing of the man whos body i was inhabiting. eventually i was made to understood that all i had to do was put this metal cylinder into this tube, and press this rubber ring into it to make a seal. which is what i did until long past nightfall. until an electronic bell rang out and everyone cleared out and swept me out in a matter of minutes. 

i ended up collapsing on the side of the road, and what happened to the poor factory worker i dont know. 

that was when it began in earnest, my little adventures. or excursions. i went so many odd and mundane places. taking over so many peoples lives for a day. it often ended so poorly too. i got hit by a man on a red motorcycle once, while i was crossing the road. at the time i was inhabiting a little third grader. i survived the initial impact, mostly because the man had tried to swerve. though i lay bleeding from a deep stomach wound. i remember looking up at the grisly trail of gore that led up to the man intimately meshed and mangled together with the remains of his red motorcycle. the handlebars had peirced his chest and poked out the back of his bloody shirt and his legs were all twisted up in the wheels. its not something one forgets so easily. 

in my body, in my little life, i was not doing so well. i was miserable being myself, my grades were slipping and my girlfriend had refused to sleep in the same bed as me after the first time. apparently i had traumatized her, it was too creepy she said how i'd lay with my eyes rolling around and around in their sockets, convulsing slightly. unresponsive. nearly comatose she said. we broke up pretty soon after as i was becoming increasingly erratic, prone to sleeping all day and never calling or texting her.

thats the worst part. my memories. forgetting who even was me. being taken over by so many different strangers, taking over so many bodies. i lose track of who i had been when and what i had been doing in what body. they all jumble together now in my head, as i pass from person to person, i wish i could forget, but that seems to be all i am now. memories, even as i forget the details of my childhood. the face of my mother and father. i think i inhabit my original body less and less, and when i do i dont remember it as me. im just another face in the blur of faces. i dont mind it so much i suppose. i never was anyone in the first place. just another person in a sea of people. 

these lives i take over. often ruin. i know theyre real now. or at least as real as a thing can be. as real as the words im writing on an old typewriter i found in my dusty basement. im old now, and have breasts again. though not nearly so large as the first time around. its not so bad being a woman, i even experienced a period once. it wasnt so bad. 

i find myself nodding off slightly, i think ill fall asleep soon.
