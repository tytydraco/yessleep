**Everyone knows me or atleast has heard of me at some point or another, and the few that don't know me, I know them because I know all of you. I’ve bumped shoulders with you, shared rides with you, sat under the still night sky those nights when you cried and cried with you. See, everyone in this world knows me even without knowing me by name or by face, they know me by feel.**



**I’m called many different names; Lucifer, Belezebub, Lilith, Asteroth, Belphigor, Lamia and many more but you most likely know me as Satan. Lord of hell, Demon king and many more ludicrous names. Here’s the truth, I’m completely misunderstood. But of course, I totally understand the misconception considering that my trade consists of lies, manipulation, murder, and everything evil. There’s no denying the nature of my work, but the roots of the misunderstanding lay beneath my motives. Many of you claim to know my motives. You call me sadistic, an evil demon who takes pleasure in my evil acts, but all of you are lightyears away from the truth.** 



**Since the time of Adam I’ve toyed with humans to evaluate who was righteous and who was not, for the lord doesn’t look at your actions, he looks at what’s in your heart, be there good, or evil. And so, I became his janitor. I was sent down as your examiner to evaluate what was in your heart. ‘Heard up the filth and sever them from the diamonds’, that is my mission.**



**My heart is broken everyday each time a child falls into drugs because he was told it was ‘cool’, each time a young man or woman proceeds to drink themself blind when the unfaithfulness of their partner of six months or less is revealed to them, when a middleaged man who had showed promise and walked the path of righteousness well proceeds to throw it all away because his secretary revealed a little too much skin. I’m shattered into a thousand pieces to help people throw themselves away because they weren’t accepted or given love by someone that they wanted love from. You all are loved enough by the creator of this universe and given dominion over this world and yet I’ve been able to make people so miserable and tortured by microscopic problems that they’d quickly throw themself away rather than suffering the climb of growing.** 



**It couldn’t be further from the truth to say that I took any sort of pleasure from this job, but I am a good servant of the lord and I bear this responsibility on my shoulders because only I can.  My job is to put obstacles in your way and watch you either grow or fold by them. You all are given so much potential and yet you neglect yourself, you self impose limits on yourself and never reach even an inch beyond these limits. God had said to give thanks and practice gratitude, however gratitude is understood as howling out ‘Thank you!’ to the lord, however, that’s not correct. Gratitude is using the abilities that the lord has blessed you with, to achieve your fullest potential with them rather than letting them go to waste. That is true gratitude.** 



**During my time of service, I’ve excelled at my job, maybe a little too well… See, since the time I tempted the lord Jesus and he went on to be the greatest sacrifice so that you all can be allowed into heaven. No one has entered the pearly gates. And since that time, it’s only gotten easier and easier to corrupt souls and tear those few walking the path of righteousness from the path and onto the highway to Hell. I’ve helped build a world where iniquity is rewarded, the word of God is fading behind the noise of social media and the ones with the filthiest hearts are the ones in charge. It was all so easy. I’m soo disappointed in you all.**
