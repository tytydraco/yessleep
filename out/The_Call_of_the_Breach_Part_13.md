[\[Part 12\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1hharfm/the_call_of_the_breach_part_12/)

Chris stood with his back to me, one hand on his radio mic. “Copy that, Hilltop. Will do.”

Leaning against the scuffed armor plating of my armored pickup truck, I watched his broad shoulders slacken, and I bit my lip in disappointment. Chris had come the instant he’d been able this morning, and it had been all I could do the night prior to talk him down over a private radio channel so that he didn’t attempt to reach me in the dark. Vecitorak hadn’t gotten so close to me since the night I was stabbed, and for Chris it was a personal grudge borne with hatred that the freak had managed it once more.

With a parting kick at a clump of mud, Chris trudged over to rest his forearms on the truck next to me.

“We’re still going forward?” I tossed a few spent rifle casings into the nearby tree line, where a pair of squabbling Firedrakes snatched them up with glee. With arrowhead shaped skulls and serpentine bodies, the winged creatures hissed and snapped at each other over their shiny treasures like crows. Like so many other creatures who had taken to the sun’s rays, their scaly hides were now a dark navy blue instead of the customary midnight black of their Breach-born forms. In either phase they were harmless, mainly annoying for their habit of stealing anything that glinted right out from under your nose, and for starting small brush fires due to their propensity to shoot little jets of spark or flame from their reptilian snouts.

He frowned, and Chris scratched at his fledgling beard, which had grown from stubble into something more substantial the longer we spent in the field. “Sean wants us driving through the southern gates of Black Oak by tonight. He said to keep the incident with Vecitorak quiet, and that we’ll deal with it once we’re inside the walls. Gave me the order to keep pushing through.”

Doing my best not to grimace at being right, I scratched at my right arm, the tattoos there still itchy from the night’s dreadful memories. “We can’t just keep ignoring this.”

“I know.” Chris shut his eyes to rest his forehead against the metal hide of the truck.

My platoon lounged not far off, enjoying the momentary down time by napping on the still-hot engine grates above the engines of an ASV column. Clustered in huddles like homeless children with their weapons cradled in their arms, they were a comical sight, and I took an extra second to pick Lucille out from among them, just to reassure myself she was safe. She’s been humiliated when the aid station finally released her, especially since it had all happened on her watch as sentry, but I knew it wasn’t her fault. Vecitorak had powers beyond human comprehension, and she’d merely been a pawn in his game, though Lucille was luckier than most. Trevor had been shipped back to Ark River in an ambulance convoy, only for word to come an hour ago that he died of a heart attack on the way. They said he’d been manic, screaming about a door in the sky, and a long, dark road, until his heart gave out under the strain. None of the medics knew what to make of it, but I did.

I lowered my voice to lean toward Chris. “He’s getting stronger. He’s going to resurrect the Oak Walker, and that book was important enough for him to come looking for it. Chris, if he succeeds . . .”

“I *know*, Hannah.” He turned to me with a haunted desperation on his face, and I noted how Chris’s cheeks had thinned out more, and the presence of a few gray hairs along the side of his head. “But I honestly have no idea what to do at this point. We’re within a day’s fighting of driving down the main street of Black Oak, and the only thing the Assembly cares about is winning the war. Besides, without a clear plan on how to kill him, we can’t convince Sean to let us go after Vecitorak, not after what happened last time.”

Glancing down at my palm, I nudged the crinkled parchment bundle nestled in it and watched the sunlight gleam off the silver necklace. I’d kept it by my side since the incident, staring at the rumpled page and its words, hoping it would somehow reveal some new secret. Vecitorak didn’t seem to notice it was gone, as his forces never returned, which only cemented my belief that he hadn’t been the one to put the necklace there. The more I read and re-read that single line, written in its ethereal lettering, the more I became convinced of its origin.

“The stranger.” I turned the teal-colored stone over in my palm with the tip of my thumb. “In the yellow chemical suit. He might know.”

Chris eyed the necklace with a thinly veiled unease and folded both arms across his chest. “We don’t even know who he is, Hannah. He could be dangerous, he could be crazy, he could be an ELSAR spy. Besides, how would we know where to find him?”

Closing my fingers over the necklace, I looked out over the landscape beyond our little hillock, where the sun danced across overgrown fields and green meadows. Each was speckled with roving brown dots of wildlife, Bone Faced Whitetail, shaggy long-horned cattle that had broken free of the abandoned farms around us, furry tusk-heavy pigs, and even a few wooly rhinos from our old New Wilderness stock. They grazed beside an old, broken-down combine that rusted away in the absence of its human makers, while the nearby road lay crowded with weeds seeking to swallow the old gravel. I had left Louisville as someone who didn’t believe in anything other than what I could see, what I could touch, whatever I might capture on my trusty camera. I’d thought I knew it all, but the longer I stayed here, the more I found that my ideas on existence were little more than ignorant speculation. Like the mutants feeding lazily on the sunlight grass, or the golden-haired Ark River people with whom I now shared a certain amount of kinship, the stranger in the yellow chemical suit stood in contrast to everything I thought I knew about the world. He appeared and vanished seemingly on a whim, either in my dreams or in real life, usually whenever I was in the direst need of help. Part of me wondered if he was a figment of my imagination, but after all I’d seen of him, after the things he’d showed me in my darkest moments when Vecitorak’s infection threatened to devour my mind, he had to be real. What he wanted, why he helped me time after time, I couldn’t say, but I had no doubt the strange man with silver eyes was out there, somewhere.

“Maybe he’ll come to us.” I shoved the necklace into my uniform pocket and faced Chris. “Either way, Vecitorak was right; I have to be there when the time comes. Something about all this is tied to me, otherwise the book wouldn’t have ended up in my hands in the first place, or the necklace for that matter. He’s got Tarren, which means Peter and his crew won’t rest until we get her back, and if the book is anything to go by, she’s not the only hostage. I have to stop him, Chris, even if Sean won’t give permission.”

His sky-blue eyes searched mine. “And if *I* gave the order for you to stay?”

Worry knotted in my brain, and I dropped my guilty expression to my boots.

*Don’t make me do this. Don’t make me look you in the eye and lie. I can’t bear keeping secrets from you.*

A calloused hand gripped my forearm through the jacket with a gentle tug, and Chris tilted my chin up to look me in the eye. “Vecitorak wants us divided, so that we’re easier to defeat. When the time comes to face him, I’ll be with you, no matter what Sean or anyone else says. Just promise me you won’t go by yourself, alright?”

Instead of resentment that I might have expected from my challenge to his rank, concern laced his hushed words, and I couldn’t do anything other than nod in the light of his worried frown. “Okay.”

In an instant, Chris pulled me to his chest, and his lips were on mine.

Surprised, but overwhelmed with a sense of need that I’d been suppressing for days, I leaned into him, felt his satin lips on mine, let his strong arms hold me, and forgot for a moment that we were at war. I didn’t care that there were others nearby, that the rumble of artillery echoed on the distant horizon, that I stank of diesel exhaust and gunpowder. To experience something other than fear, stress, or fatigue brought tears to my eyes, and when his lips parted from mine, I almost pulled him back for more.

Chris’s forehead pressed to mine, and he brushed a stray bit of hair from my face, the brown locks interwoven with the golden streaks brought on by the Breach’s touch. “I love you.”

“I love you too.” I fought the urge to sob, to crumple like a paper bag under the immense weight of our circumstances. All I wanted was to have a normal life with him, to go on dates, watch movies at home, introduce him to my parents and kiss goodnight on my porch. It occurred to me that we would never have that; even if somehow this didn’t end in our deaths, I doubted we would ever see the outside world again. ELSAR was everywhere, and as long as they existed, we wouldn’t be safe.

The arms around me relaxed, and it took every ounce of willpower I had to let go of him. I watched him walk back to his ASV with a sharp ache in my chest, and hated myself for wondering in that moment if it would have been better for us never to meet, so that I wouldn’t have to know such pain.

*Loving you will kill me, Christopher Dekker.*

Climbing into the cab of my armored pickup, I waited as the rest of my platoon hopped off the departing ASV’s and called out to them from between the strips of window-armor. “Fourth, we’re moving out.”

The diesel engine rumbled to life, and the other trucks gunned their engines to follow. We rolled out of the clearing we’d been parked in, the golden mid-morning sun high overhead, and our tires ground down the road as we made decent speed. Long white streaks in the blue sky were interspersed with black trails of smoke, as our MANPAD squads fought a constant battle against enemy aircraft. This close to the county line, the effects of the Breach weren’t as strong, allowing ELSAR to take to wing, but we’d captured several crates of shoulder-mounted anti-air rockets from the depot. These proved invaluable at shooting down the drones, helicopters, and jets of the enemy, each fallen plane increasing our chances of survival. Our foe was in full retreat, the panic almost contagious on the few captured enemy radios we’d been able to listen in on before they switched frequencies, and spirits were high amongst our forces. Green flags fluttered from our vehicles, decorated with the rhino emblem of New Wilderness and the golden cross of Ark River, symbolizing our coalition. Different crews cheered as we passed each other on the road, and the troops in the back of our armored truck sang to pass the time. It was a beautiful day, with the last leaves of autumn raining from the trees like a cloud of orange, red, and gold on the road, enough to make me nostalgic for the time mom and dad had taken me to a pumpkin patch when I was ten.

*Oh to be able to call them again, just to hear their voices . . . what I wouldn’t give.*

At last, the road curved round a bend, and the trees opened up to reveal the signs of mankind ahead. Tall buildings pierced the horizon, the *crack-crack* of gunfire echoed in the air, artillery shells whistled forth, and aircraft swarmed to their doom amongst the clouds in a vain attempt to regain the initiative. These fell in flaming wrecks to the earth outside of town, missiles arching up from the ground to intercept the ones that barely had a chance to take off from the small airstrip inside Black Oak. Entire rows of old houses burned outside the walls, and multiple pillars of black smoke rose as more went up. Sunlight-adapted mutants scurried away at our advance, mostly Bone-Faced Whitetail that had been grazing in the overgrown yards, along with a few hefty Auto Stalkers that galloped off with shrieking clanks of metal.

Flashes along the broad stretch of gray concrete perimeter wall showed that fighting was already underway, and as we rumbled closer, I clicked my mic to peer through the armored strips over our window glass in the cab. “All Sparrow One Units, this is Sparrow One Actual. We’re getting close to the city limits, so keep your eyes and scan your sectors. Be ready to dismount.”

More built-up suburbs began to pass by, ruined like so many in Barron County were, but the roads became paved, the buildings closer together, and street signs were more common. Smoke hung in the air, likely from enemy return shelling hitting the various abandoned houses, and there were more dilapidated vehicles along the roadside. Our ASV’s were well ahead, along with the howitzer and mortar crews, the other mobile camps having gotten a head start on us this morning. Judging by the heavy volume of rifle fire, and the *thud-thud* of mortar rounds, they were already in the thick of it.

*“Rhino One Actual, this is Rhino Two Actual, we’re taking sniper fire from the department store roughly 300 meters west of the MSR, permission to deviate from our current route to engage?”* One of the armored units called over the radio to Chris, and I sat up a little straighter in my seat.

*“Negative Rhino Two, we need all heavy units pushing the front. Maintain your current course to the gate. I’ll send a light unit to take care of it.”* I could hear more rifle shots in the background of Chris’s reply, and my blood surged in dread.

Craning my neck to peer outside, I spotted the sloped roof of a two-story department store not a quarter mile to our left and clicked my radio mic. “Rhino Two Actual, this is Sparrow One Actual, I have eyes on a two-story building with a green roof, is that the one you’re taking fire from?”

*“Confirmed, at least three rifle shots from the second story, somewhere near the left side windows.”*

With both hands scrambling for my map, I gestured for Charlie to take a left as I keyed my mic once more. “Copy that, Sparrow One Actual is enroute to the combat zone now, we’ll move through that area and clear it out.”

Chris’s voice crackled over the speakers on the heels of my traffic. *“Sparrow One Actual, be advised, we don’t have any units in that sector; we have no idea how strong the enemy presence is. Proceed with caution, and withdraw if contact gets heavy, how copy, over?”*

“Solid copy on all.” I checked my Type 9 to be sure the safety was on, and drew a deep, nervous breath. “We’ll park a few blocks out and send a squad in on foot. I’ll report back anything I find. Sparrow One out.”

Our speed increased, and we wound through narrow side alleys, garbage strewn roads, and down a broad central street that was barren of any activity. Black Oak had once been the largest town in Barron County, home to a least a few thousand people, but most of them had fled the outskirts when the Breach first unleashed its wrath. ELSAR’s wall cut the urban areas off from the forest, though in the south there had been sections of houses left out of the encirclement. Evidence of mutants showed everywhere, from claws marks on the edges of smashed-in windows, to rotting corpses left where they’d fallen in the side gardens, to the occasional gleaming reflection of an eye within a hollow doorframe as we thundered past. This place belonged to them now, a haven for the unnatural, the wild, the post-human. It hurt to see the remains of our civilization rotting into the ground, but this was overpowered by the knowledge that any one of the ruins could be hiding an enemy rocket team, a thought that made the hairs on my neck stand on end.

*If that sniper’s smart, he’ll be gone by the time we get there.*

A spattering of rifle fire cut through the smoky haze not far off, and Charlie flexed his fingers on the truck’s steering wheel. “Sounds close. That’s at least four, maybe five different shooters. We could be walking into a whole platoon of them.”

I noticed a small asphalt parking lot next to a nearby brick apartment building and jabbed a finger at it. “Let’s stage there, and we’ll try to get a vantage point to see what’s going on.”

We circled the trucks in the lot, and those who weren’t drivers or gunners moved into the dilapidated apartments to sweep them out. Aside from several flea-bitten rats and a lone Speaker Crab that scuttled off into a drainage ditch, these were empty, and I quickly climbed to the second floor to search for a balcony.

As it was, these apartments must have been of the cheaper variety, since the best I could do was a large window that looked out over the next two blocks with reasonable distance. Charlie lent me his binoculars, and I squinted through the lenses over the jumble of rooftops to try and spot any scope glare in the nearby department store.

Nothing greeted my eye, but a flash of movement in the street adjacent to the building did, and I watched with rapt attention as three armed figures dashed across the roadway, accompanied by an uptick in the rifle fire. They didn’t seem to have any uniforms, and no helmets or body armor of any kind. In fact, they looked like regular civilians, save for the weapons they carried.

*Wait a minute . . .*

“Come on.” Heart pounding in excitement, I raced down the stairs of the apartment building to jog out the back door, picking my way down the street with careful steps.

It was surreal after so long in the wilderness, walking down what could have been any other street in America with a submachine gun, steel helmet, and combat boots on. The sheer amount of small arms fire that ripped through the air ahead of us made it less idyllic, and my skin crawled at how heavy the fighting sounded, the *crack-crack* of rifles, deeper *bangs* of a machine gun, and the chest-rattling *booms* of a grenade. There were a *lot* of people less than a few blocks from us, but I concentrated on keeping on foot in front of the other, let my breathing ease, and *the focus* slid into place.

From this range, it didn’t get me much, but my ears sharpened, my lungs felt the reverberations in the air of the gunshots, and I sensed the vibration of distant vehicles in the ground under my feet. I tasted salty gunpowder on the breeze, caught the faint footfalls on concrete, and paused at the last corner before the department store.

*Six of them down the street from here . . . five more on the opposite corner . . . they were all shooting at the store, not away from it . . .*

Hunched low against the cold cement of the sidewalk, I poked my head around the corner and squinted into the distance.

Two gray ELSAR Humvees sat parked behind the department store, neither of them occupied. I could see pockmarks in the brickwork around the store’s windows where it had taken rounds, and broken glass on the sidewalk outside, but nowhere did I see any movement, or the reflection of light on a bit of gear. Had the enemy vanished into thin air?

*Thud.*

A metal man door on the back of the building swung open, and a single, gray-uniformed figure dashed out.

The man ran headlong toward the Humvees, his rifle gone, the plate carrier on his torso awash with blood. He had one hand clapped to his neck where rivers of crimson trickled down, his helmet gone. A pistol was clutched in his opposite hand, though I could see it was empty for how the slide was locked back, and the deflated pouches on his vest spoke to a lack of ammunition.

Confused, I held up a hand for my platoon mates behind me not to fire and furrowed my brow at the soldier.

*Where’s the rest of your—*

*Bang.*

A single bullet caught the soldier between his shoulder blades, ramming into the protective armor plates of his vest. He went down with a yelp, and groaned on the cement, still trying to get up.

Two more people emerged from the store, dressed in civilian clothes, with rifles in hand. Like circling coyotes on a wounded rabbit, their jog after the soldier slowed to a cautious walk, and the second one let out a short, triumphant laugh. His compatriot in the front, a younger man with short brown hair, kicked the discarded pistol away from the soldier, and raised the muzzle of his own M4.

*Bang.*

The soldier’s head shattered under the bullet, and red blood mixed with sandy gray matter across the asphalt parking lot as the soldier’s boots twitched in a death spasm.

“Clear.” Giving the body a final parting kick of disgust, the one who’d executed the fleeing mercenary let out a small sigh.

More faces emerged in the windows of the department store above, and whistles echoed through the neighborhood around me like birds calling to one another. My blood cooled as I realized there were even some in the building right beside me who would spot us at any second. I had no idea if these people knew who we were, but I didn’t want to end up in a needless firefight over a mistake uniform.

As they turned to go back to the store, the first man’s eyes rose from the dead soldier, and landed squarely on me.

He froze, and both hands tightened on the rifle he carried.

*I know your face.*

Like a bolt of lightning, I saw through the scruff and exhaustion to recognize the thin countenance of someone I would never forget as long as I lived.

“Josh?” I lowered my Type 9, hardly believing my eyes.

A grin split his expression from ear to ear, and he blinked with a surprised chuckle. “No way. Hannah? Is that you?”

Relief flooded my body, the dismal thoughts vanishing, and I rose to meet him halfway across the street with an enthusiastic hug. Josh had been one of the first resistance members I’d met in my brief stay in Black Oak some weeks prior. Along with a few others, he risked his life to save me from the clutches of the Organs, ELSAR Auxiliary troops hired from the local population as a form of secret police. While he bore an undying hatred for the provisional government due to what they’d done to his family, Josh had showed nothing but kindness to me, and seeing his face again made some of the day’s stresses ease.

“So, you made it after all. I just won a lot of bets with some Smuggler boys.” Josh swiveled his head back to call out to his companion. “Hey, get word to the others, we found the rebels!”

“It’s good to see you too.” I slung my Type 9 over one shoulder and watched over a dozen fighters emerge from the buildings around us. “We were moving in on the southern gate and got sent this way. Thought you guys were ELSAR.”

“We heard you were coming.” Josh beckoned the rest of my platoon mates forward, and we strode toward the department store as casually as if we’d been out for a walk in normal times. “Of course we couldn’t know exactly when, but with how many ambulance trucks were streaming back through the gates, we figured it had to be soon. So, we decided to strike first, and cause chaos, as we do.”

“Like you do.” Nodding back the way we’d come, I eyed the nearby sky skyline. “I’ve got the rest of my men holding near the trucks. We’re only a recon platoon, the main force is on the primary road heading for the wall. Don’t suppose you have a way inside?”

Josh checked his watch as though waiting on a train. “Should be something right about . . .”

*Ka-boom.*

The explosion shook the ground, a rising cloud of smoke mushroomed into the air from the north, and the shockwave blew whatever glass was left out of the surrounding houses. Shouts of alarm were quickly replaced by whoops and cheers from the resistance members, some even clapping like they were at a concert.

“ . . . now.” He winked at me and Josh pointed to the smoke plume with pride. “Managed to get our hands on some C4 earlier this week and stole a bus from the elementary school. Rigged it up with a hand switch from the driver’s seat, so there’s no way it could fail.”

Somewhat confused, I raised an eyebrow. “How would your man inside get clear?”

His face took on a more somber, serious expression. “Tom had cancer. He didn’t need to get clear. That’s why he volunteered.”

*Oh.*

Nausea threatened to surge in my intestines, and I couldn’t help but glance at the dead soldier not fifteen yards away. True, he was the enemy, but something about it still felt wrong. Shooting downed soldiers, sending dying men into suicidal missions, it felt more like a crime than anything else I’d ever participated in. However, I knew I couldn’t get sentimental, not now, when victory was close. This was war after all.

*“All units, this is Hilltop; the southern gate is down, I say again, the southern gate is down. Move in and secure the checkpoints. Push them hard.”* Sean’s jubilant voice echoed through my radio headset, and dragged me back into the present.

“So, you guys need a ride?” I dug my map out of my pocket, and checked our location, tracing the path back to the main supply route with my finger. “We could use the extra muscle. Sean wants us to be inside the walls by nightfall.”

Josh’s grass-green irises flicked to the abandoned Humvees. “I think we’ll manage. But if we could tag along for the drive in, that’d be great. You guys have any food?”

Handing him an MRE from my knapsack, I arched my neck to watch another helicopter tumble from the sky somewhere over the town, its rotors snapped like toothpicks from one of our STINGER missiles. “We’ve got everything.”
