The snow fell hard, thick curtains of white swallowing the world in silence. My cabin, nestled on a low ridge, creaked softly in the cold. The hearth cracked behind me, but I didn’t turn. I heard the crunch of paws before I saw it — a bear, mid-sized but lean with the season, standing on hind legs, trying to climb the lip of the platform. It sniffed, pawed, its breath a hot fog against the air. But the slope was too sheer, and the bear—graceful despite its weight—couldn’t pull itself up.

We stared at each other.

Not fear. Not hunger. Just presence. Its eyes were dark and old, flecked with snow. I sat down slowly on the wooden threshold, feeling the chill rise through the boards. The bear huffed, lowered to all fours, and stayed there.

Minutes passed.

I didn’t speak, didn’t move. Just let something between us hum and settle—like tuning forks aligning in some quiet, ancient frequency. Man and beast, separated by planks and inches and an unspeakable pact: *I see you. I don’t need to tame you.*

It blinked. So did I.

And for a moment, the storm paused, as if the mountain held its breath.

The wind shrieked outside, but inside the world was still — carved wood, firelight, smoke curling toward the rafters. I took the slab of meat from the cold-box, still red, still bleeding a little. Elk, maybe. Caught in one of the snares it led me to. It didn’t fight the trap — just circled from a distance until I arrived, then vanished into the trees.

I carried it to the bench outside.

The bear had climbed the ridge by now, seated heavy and calm beside the pinewood table I’d built last winter. Snow flecked its back like ash. Its eyes followed me without blinking. I placed the bowl down — thick, carved, smoothed from a tree I felled when I first moved here. I slid the raw meat into the bowl. Steam hissed where it touched the cold wood.

The bear bent its head and ate. Not like an animal — not frenzied. More like... reverence.

Inside, I skinned another cut by the fire. My knife was dull. Hands stiff from the cold, fingers not what they used to be. I tied the meat to a split pine spit over the pyre outside the cabin. Let the fat sizzle.

Later, I sat across from it, bowl between us, the silence broken only by the chewing, the fire, and the moan of wind dragging snow across the slope. We didn’t speak, but something older than words passed between us — a trade, a bond, not of domination or fear, but necessity. Mutual survival. A knowing.

It hunted for me. I fed it what it helped me kill. It took what it needed. I took what I could. And in between, we sat — two beasts in the wilderness, warmed by fire, meat, and the understanding that in this place, nothing lived alone.   

  


It didn't happen in a single night.

First, it lingered longer after feeding. Then it came closer to the threshold — pawing at the step, resting its great head on the boards, as if listening to the heartbeat of the cabin. I left the door unlatched one evening. Just enough. A test, perhaps.

Snow blew in. The wind whistled through the crack.

Then — the creak of the hinge, the hush of heavy breath, claws careful against wood. It stepped inside.

The cabin was not large. My bed was a cot beside the fire. The bear lowered itself near the hearth, spine rising and falling like a sleeping hill. I sat back, knife in hand out of habit, but I didn’t need it. There was no threat in it. Just weight. Just presence.

That first night, we slept under the same roof.

By the end of the week, it slept beside me.

Its warmth was enormous, a living wall against the dark. The fire flickered, casting shadows that danced over its fur and the logs. I could hear the slow thunder of its breath, and when the wind screamed outside, I didn’t feel it.

Not in my bones.

Not anymore.

I didn’t name it. It didn’t need one. Whatever it was — companion, guardian, reflection — it came in silence and stayed in silence. And in that silence, I found something I hadn’t known I missed:

Company that asked for nothing but trust.

Winter had deepened. The sky was a constant low ceiling of grey, the snow endless, the sun a memory. Nights came early, thick and long. Inside, the fire was steady, casting a gentle glow on fur and flesh alike. The bear snored softly. I had grown used to it — the rise and fall, the warmth it shared like a second fire. We had become wordless kin.   

  


Then came the night of the sound.

It began low, like wind through bone. But it wasn’t wind.

It wasn’t anything I could name.

The howl came from no direction. Not outside. Not above. Not below. Just — *around*. Inside the walls, the trees, the stone. It wasn’t loud at first, but it grew, like a pressure behind the ears. A sound that bypassed hearing and pressed into the chest.

I sat up.

The bear was already awake, sitting upright beside me, rigid. Its ears didn’t twitch. It didn’t sniff the air.

It just turned and looked at me.

And in its eyes… it *knew*.

Knew what the sound was. Knew what it meant. Knew it had come for one of us — or both.

It didn’t growl. Didn’t run.

Just watched me with that terrible, ancient calm. Like it had waited for this. Like this moment had always been a part of the pact.

Outside, the snow had stopped falling.

The sound didn’t fade. It *stayed*. Like the sky had opened and something vast and not of this world had exhaled, and its breath remained, echoing inside everything I’d ever been.

I found myself whispering without meaning to — words I didn’t understand, in a tongue I had never learned. The bear turned to the door.

It was time.

The howls went on for what felt like hours. They rose and fell like waves, not from any single throat but from the very shape of the world. Not wolves — *something older*, something that remembered being a wolf before wolves had names.

They swirled in the dark, in the rafters, in the wind threading through the cracks of the cabin.

And then, just as suddenly, they stopped.

The fire burned low. The bear lay beside me, eyes open, staring at the door for a long time. Eventually, it curled in again. I rested my head back and slept, not because the fear was gone, but because something deeper — older — had settled in its place.

Resolve.   

  


By morning the light was thin, grey. I stepped outside. The snow had frozen into a crust overnight, crunching under my boots. No tracks. No broken branches. No sign that the night had ever happened.

I returned to the cabin and took down the rifle from above the mantle. The bear watched from the corner, head tilted. Curious.

I sat on the step and beckoned.

It approached, slowly, ears low but eyes alert.

I held the rifle out. Showed it the stock, the cold length of the barrel. Let it sniff the oiled metal.

“This,” I said quietly, “is not teeth. But it bites.”

I placed my finger to the trigger, slow and deliberate. The bear’s eyes tracked every movement.

I turned, aimed toward a dead pine log half-buried in the snow.

Then — I fired.

The crack split the cold, echoing down the trees like a god’s knuckle cracking. The log jumped. Birds scattered somewhere in the far canopy.

The bear flinched — not from fear, but instinct.

I looked at it. It looked back.

My voice was low, but firm. Not a threat. A vow.

“Next time,” I said, “we’ll be ready.”   

  


The stew had simmered through the afternoon — thick with root vegetables, bone marrow, and chunks of elk meat we’d carved from the last hunt. I ate with quiet focus, seated on the bench, rifle resting beside me on the wall. The bear lapped from its bowl across the table, slow and methodical. Outside, the sun had long vanished, leaving only a dull steel-grey behind the trees. The kind of darkness where time forgets to move.

We finished eating. I stirred the fire, adding a few thick logs. Not because of the cold — the cabin was warm — but because something in me wanted the flames tall. Alive.

Then, just like before, it began.

The howls.

Not one. Not a pack. But *a presence*.

They rose like fog. Swelling in the ears, in the walls, in the spine. That same bone-deep resonance. But this time, something was different. Closer. More *focused.*

I stood.

The bear was already at the window.

I walked over, lifted the edge of the wool curtain I’d rigged together from old flannel and deer hide. Peered out.

At first: nothing.

Just black trees swaying in the wind.

Then — a glint.

No… *two*.

Eyes. Reflecting the firelight somehow, even from this distance. Far off, just at the edge of where the trees met the slope. Fixed. Unblinking.

And too high. Too far apart. No wolf stood that tall. No animal I knew held itself like that — *upright*, still as a statue. Waiting.

The bear pressed its head beside mine, peering through the same gap in the cloth. It didn’t growl. Didn’t shift. Just watched.

Together.

The creature out there didn’t move. But we knew.

It was watching too.

And it *knew* we saw it.

I slid the curtain back down.

The rifle rested across my lap now. The bear returned to its place beside the hearth — not to lie down, but to *wait*.

Its eyes never left the door.

Nor did mine.

I sat still for a long time, eyes on the door, the rifle across my knees. The bear hadn’t moved from the hearth, but its body was taut — muscles coiled under fur, every breath slow and deliberate.

I didn’t speak aloud. I didn’t need to.

I turned my head slightly toward it. Let the weight of the question hang in the air like smoke.

*Should we go out?*

I didn’t gesture, didn’t point — just let the thought fill the space between us like a low fire warming cold stone.

The bear looked at me.

And I knew its answer before it moved.

It blinked once. A slow, deliberate blink. Then it turned its eyes back toward the door. The cabin creaked softly in the wind. Outside, the howling had stopped again — but something else had settled in its place. A pressure. As though the air itself had become *aware* of us.

And then I *heard* the answer.

Not in sound. Not in voice.

But in the way the fire cracked just slightly, and the way the bear exhaled through its nose — steady, quiet, resigned.

*No.*  
*It is not what you think it is.*  
*And if we step outside, it will no longer need to wait.*

I didn’t argue. I didn’t pretend to understand what *it* was — only that the bear did. And that its knowing was enough for now.

So I leaned back slowly, rifle still close.

And we waited.

Not in fear.  
Not in defiance.

In acknowledgment.

That tonight, the thing in the dark was not something we could kill.  
And maybe — not something that came to kill us.

But to *watch.*  
To *measure.*  
To *remember.*

We sat like that for what felt like hours.

The glow from the fire flickered, casting slow-moving shadows across the cabin walls. The eyes outside never moved. They were still there — patient, unblinking, eternal.

I turned slightly, not to speak, but to listen. Not with my ears, but with something deeper — a thread that had grown between us, me and the bear, wordless and old.

And something passed from it into me.

Not sound.  
Not image.  
Just *knowing.*

A pressure behind the eyes. A chill not of cold, but of impossible *scale.*

And in that moment, I understood:

This thing — the one watching from the woods, wrapped in silence and snow — did not come from the wilderness.

It came *before* it.

It was not ancient in the way glaciers or stone are ancient. No. The bear showed me this — not in words, but in the way its gaze softened, heavy with a kind of sorrow I’d never seen in an animal before.

This presence had *always* been.

Before light.  
Before dark.  
Before the ticking order of time tried to make meaning of chaos.

It was not evil.  
It was not good.  
It simply *was.*

And the bear — it had known this thing. Not in this life, not even in memory. But in the *deepness*, where instinct is written in the marrow.

I felt my throat tighten. Not in fear. Not even in awe.

But in the recognition of something I was never meant to *perceive.*

A truth too big for thought.

The bear did not tremble. Did not blink.

It had accepted this long ago.

And now, sitting beside it, I began to understand why *we* were the ones left alive.

Not because we were strong. Not because we were lucky.

But because we were *quiet.*

And because we *listened.*

The understanding the bear passed into me lingered like a fever behind my ribs. It wasn’t just knowledge. It *unseated* something in me — a loosening, like the ground beneath memory cracking open.

I shuddered. The kind of shiver that isn’t from cold, but from a soul being touched by something *older than language*.

I turned back toward the window. Slowly.

The curtain hung still. No wind. No noise.

But the eyes were still there — twin glimmers in the dark, fixed, patient.

And then the darkness around them shifted.

It didn’t move, not like a body would. It *formed* — as though suggestion became shape. The snow seemed to bow around it, the trees pulling back slightly in dread or reverence. And in that space, a *face* emerged.

Human.

Impossibly, undeniably *human.*

And familiar.

It was *his* face. My friend. The one who died that night on the ice-slick road. The one who trusted me to steer us through the storm, and who never got the chance to open his door.

His name caught in my throat. But I didn’t say it.

Because it wasn’t him.

The shape of the face was right — the cheeks, the jaw, even the dimple in the chin. But the *smile*…

That was wrong.

Too wide. Too knowing. Curved with mockery, not warmth. Not the soft, bashful grin I remembered — but a mask stretched taut over something *smarter* and more *ancient* than grief.

My chest tightened. Not with sorrow. Not with recognition.

With *exposure.*

That thing… it had reached into me.

Past memory. Past language. Past guilt.

And it had *chosen* that face.

Because it knew.

Not just about the accident.

But about the *silence* that came after.

The things I never said.  
The things I never let myself *feel.*  
The parts of myself I sealed off like rooms in a burned house.

The bear let out a low breath behind me. Not a growl — a mournful, resigned sound. Like a bell rung for something that had always been inevitable.

I didn’t know if I was being confronted or claimed.

Only that the face out there, smiling with something older than cruelty, was not here to ask forgiveness.

It was here to *witness.*

The face held a moment longer — grinning with that wrong, stretched smile — then it *unraveled*.

Not vanished. Not withdrawn.

It *unmade itself*, the way frost melts under flame, or smoke disperses when it realizes it’s been seen. The eyes lingered last, like dying coals. Then they too were gone.

Just darkness.

Just snow drifting lazily in the pines, as though nothing had ever stood there.

I pulled the curtain shut. Slowly. There was nothing more to see.

No answers. No signs. Just the awful weight of *being known.*

I turned back inside.

The bear had returned to its place near the hearth. It did not watch the door. It watched *me*.

And something in that gaze — deep, wordless, worn — said: *It’s done.*

Not over.  
Not gone.  
Just… *done for now.*

It pressed its body to the floorboards again, exhaled long and low, and settled in. As though rest could be reclaimed. As though sleep was still an option.

It wanted me to do the same.

But I couldn’t.

Not after *that.*

I sat near the fire, rifle across my lap, fingers still cold despite the flames. My eyes didn’t close. They *refused.*

Because every time I blinked, I saw that face behind my lids.

Not just the one in the snow — but the real one, too.

The *true* one.

My friend.

His last look before the impact.  
The way his fingers had reached for something.  
The words I might have said — but didn’t.

And the thing in the dark had known all of it.

Not as memory.  
But as *substance.*

I stayed awake as the fire burned down to embers. The bear didn't move again.

And somewhere out in the night, beyond the cabin and the trees and the limits of time, *it* waited. Not because it needed to come back.

But because it *could*.   

  


Morning came grey and golden, the first light slicing through the trees like truth through fog. For the first time in days, the sky was clear — the storm had passed.

I stepped outside, my breath curling in the cold like smoke from a dying wick. The axe was in my hand, calloused fingers gripping it by instinct more than need. The bear padded beside me, as it always did. The morning ritual — cut wood, pull stumps, gather what the snow had buried.

Normal.

But nothing felt normal anymore.

We moved toward a line of smaller pines we’d marked weeks ago. That’s when I saw it.

On the nearest tree — something carved.

No… *not carved*. Not by hand, not by blade. The bark had been *peeled* with precision, layers stripped back in such a way that the raw wood was exposed in delicate patterns.

Lines. Thin, deliberate. Almost etched.  
A circle, low and overlapping the lines — as though the symbol were *sinking* into the tree itself. Or rising *out* of it.

It wasn’t language.  
But it *spoke*.

I stepped closer, fingers brushing the surface.

It didn’t feel like bark. It felt… cooler. As though the tree wasn’t part of this place anymore. As though it was *incomplete* — not rotting, not growing, just *waiting.*

Then I looked up.

And there — halfway up the trunk — the bark was torn outward. Not like from claws or weather. It had been *opened*.

And beyond it—

Nothing.

Not rot. Not shadow.

Just void.

A black so absolute it didn’t reflect the sunlight. It wasn’t shadow. It wasn’t depth.

It was *absence.*

Like something had pulled a piece of the world loose — and nothing had rushed in to fill the space.

My mouth was dry. My thoughts scattered.

And then I looked at the bear.

It was already staring at the mark. Its posture had changed. Not fear — not exactly. But something close to *recognition.*

It looked at me.

And I knew what it meant, though no word was exchanged:

*This was not a message.*  
*This was a door.*  
*And it was opened for you.*

I returned to the cabin, quietly, like I might wake something I hadn’t noticed yet. My rifle still rested near the door, and I picked it up without ceremony. It didn’t feel like a weapon now — just something *known*. A relic of control in a world that no longer obeyed the rules I’d grown up with.

Outside, I dragged the wood stool through the snow, its legs scraping grooves behind me. The bear followed, silent and attentive. When we reached the marked tree, it examined the torn bark again — not sniffing, not pawing — just *feeling* it, in its own way. The morning sun etched long shadows over the ground, but the void in the tree cast none.

I placed the stool beneath the aperture.

It wasn’t high — just out of my reach. Almost as if it had been *designed* that way.

I hesitated.

Then the bear moved, circling behind me. With a grunt, it stepped up onto the stool, sturdy despite its size, its balance precise.

It *offered itself.*

Without words. Without need.

Just the same way it had accepted the meat. The fire. The silence.

I stepped onto its back, my boots pressing down — and it didn’t flinch. I placed a hand on its shoulder for balance, feeling the thick muscle shift beneath the fur, steady and calm. We stayed like that for a breath. Maybe two.

Then I looked down — not to speak, but to *see* it.

Its eyes met mine.

A silent, sturdy *friendship* radiated there. No fear. No warning.

Just trust.

I nodded — more to myself than to it — and turned toward the opening.

The blackness yawned before me.

At first, it was just that — black. Silent. Like the world had forgotten to paint this part in. But as I leaned forward, rifle slung behind me, something within the void *changed.*

It deepened.

Or perhaps *unfolded.*

The silence began to shimmer. Not with sound, but with a strange, subtle shift — like a pressure on the inside of the skull. And within the dark, points of color emerged. Slowly, then all at once.

Stars. Not scattered — *arranged.*

Galaxies curved in spirals, distant and bright, locked in a dance I could *feel* in my chest. Colors I couldn’t name bled into each other. And behind it all: motion without direction, light without source, a *structure* that hinted at meaning but denied interpretation.

A kaleidoscope of everything that had ever *been* — and maybe everything that *couldn’t be.*

The world behind the tree had *no sound.*

But I *felt* it speaking.

Not to me.

*About* me.

I felt shaken at the center of my being as I stood there, watching — at *nothing,* and yet everything. Balanced atop the bear, the rifle slung like an artifact on my back, I stared into the aperture in the tree. My breath clouded faintly in the cold air, but the space beyond the bark didn’t accept it — as though even vapor had no right to cross that threshold.

The galaxies within it shifted, but not with the urgency of movement. They *drifted*, like memories from a time before mine. And watching them — knowing they were not illusion, not madness, but *real* — I felt something inside me unmoor. A quiet tilting.

Like gravity had changed its mind about me.

The bear’s body held firm beneath me — massive, unshaking, warm. I was not alone. I *knew* that. But still I felt like a strand of thread suspended in a storm. Something small that had been plucked from its world and shown another.

No sound. No wind. Just that impossible sky folded inside a tree, and the sense that it had *waited* for someone.

Maybe not me.

But someone *like* me.

And now that I had seen it — now that I had *been seen* — something had shifted.

Inside the bark, a single speck flared brighter than the others — gold at first, then blue, then red. It pulsed once.

Like a signal.

Like a heartbeat.

Or a warning.

That single speck flared again.

It wasn’t beautiful. It wasn’t majestic. It pulsed like something alive and unwell — red, then white, then nothing. And again. Not inviting… but *calling*. Not gentle… but *insistent*. I felt it in the meat behind my eyes, in my molars, in the base of my spine.

It yearned for me.

Not for humanity, not for discovery, not for salvation. *Me*. As if it *knew* what I'd done. Who I was. The choices that brought me here, the ones I tried to bury with solitude and frozen ground.

It wanted me to step through.

Not out of love. Not for purpose. But because it had *waited*. Because it had *seen* me long before I saw it.

My hand hovered near the edge of the hollow. Not touching. Not daring. Just trembling in the cold — or maybe from something deeper.

Below me, the bear growled low. Not fear, not aggression. A warning.

I blinked. The galaxies inside flickered.

And that speck… blinked back.

I slumped down and slid off the bear's back, boots thudding softly into the snow-patched ground. My gloved fingers sank into its thick fur — not just for warmth, but for understanding.

I didn’t speak. I didn’t need to.

My hand trembled as I moved it along the beast’s shoulder, not in fear, but in search — for reassurance, for connection, for that silent language we’d been building since it first curled beside the fire.

It knew.

Of course it knew.

What I saw in that hollow wasn’t madness. It wasn’t illusion. It was *real* — a passage, a membrane between this world and something else. Something *older*. A boreal dimension, hidden deep beneath the skin of this forest, coiled like a sleeping god.

Not even the wildest predators dared imagine such a place. But the bear… it had *felt* it. Maybe long before it found me. Maybe that’s why it had come in the first place.

It made a soft, guttural sound — almost a purr, almost a warning — and pressed its broad head gently against my chest.

In that quiet, I knew: this thing wasn’t just a hole in a tree.

It was *waiting*.

And next time, it might not wait.

I did what any man, dumbed down by the forest and the cold silence it breeds — frozen in a desperation manufactured by nature itself — would do.

I raised the rifle.

The bear shifted slightly beneath me, not in protest, not in fear. Just... resignation.

I aimed the barrel at the void.

And fired.

The crack of the shot shattered the stillness like glass. A bloom of bark exploded outward, but the hole — the thing inside it — didn't flinch. Didn’t change. If anything, it *opened* wider, not in shape, but in feeling.

It was as if I’d fired into a dream and only made it more real.

There was no echo.

Only silence.

Then the void — that swirling lattice of distant galaxies and impossible geometry — *shuddered*, not physically, but across my vision, across my thoughts. I felt something reach back through it. Not a claw, not a tendril — a *knowing*. It pulsed once, and I staggered back off the bear, hitting the snow hard.

The bear did not move. It only looked at me, eyes old as the moon, heavy with something I now understood was grief.

Because I hadn’t closed the door.

I had knocked.

And it had *heard me*.

As my face lay buried in the snow, numbness crawling up my cheeks, the cold became the least of what I felt.   

  


I remembered that night.

The bottle was old — some rare, aged whiskey from a cask he’d been saving since college. We drank it in a rust-bucket sedan with the heater on full blast, the music barely audible over the roar of the wind outside. We were parked for a long time, watching the moon glint off a frozen beach shoreline, a place far from the forest, far from all this.

We spoke like ghosts recounting lives we’d already lived. He asked about Mira — about the fights. I told him how it ended, how much I didn’t care anymore. Then he brought up the company, how I sold it for far less than it was worth. How I gave up.

"You could’ve done more," he’d said. "You had one thing going and just let it burn."

I laughed, but inside, I hated him for it.

And maybe that hate — just for that moment — was why I didn’t slow down.

Why I didn’t pull the wheel when the cargo van swerved across the divider like a bullet shot sideways through the dark.

The headlights flared white.

The crash was a sound that never really left my ears.

And he died.

I lived.

No court. No charges. Just... aftermath.

They called it an accident.

I never did.   

  


I stood up again, brushing off the snow. The ache in my knees returned with the blood. I looked at the tree, half-expecting the impossible to still be there — that hole, that wound in the world.

But it was gone.

The bark was still torn, fibrous and raw, like something had once pulled itself out. The symbol remained, dark lines gouged with unnatural precision. But the void? The swirling mouth of galaxies?

No trace.

Just a broken tree waiting to be felled.

I didn’t move. Not because I didn’t want to, but because something in me felt altered. Like my mind had briefly leaned over a cliff too wide to perceive, and now it refused to step forward.

The bear walked ahead and looked back. It nudged me once with its snout — not impatient, not commanding. Just a gesture. *Time to go.*

We returned to the cabin without a single log.

That night, I had to dig into the reserve meat — a few salted strips from the cellar, stiff and leathery from the cold. I boiled it slow. Outside, the sky folded into a deeper kind of black. The kind that doesn't end at the treetops.

Night came early.

And the silence didn’t feel like rest.

It felt like... waiting.   

  


That night, the howls came again.

But not like before.

They were no longer singular, no longer lonely. They rose in waves, a choir of throats opened wide across the forest, each voice melding into another until it was one sound — layered, guttural, harmonic in the worst way. Deep enough to vibrate the glass. Purposeful. Intentional.

It wasn’t a warning.

It was a call.

I stood by the window for too long, the firelight casting my silhouette against the glass. The rifle weighed differently in my hands — heavier, as if it too understood what might come. My fingers cramped around the grip, and I drew the curtains shut, the wool dragging slowly as if reluctant to block out what waited beyond.

I didn’t look at the bear.

I didn’t need to.

It had already turned to face the door.

Back to the fire, eyes locked on the threshold like it expected something — not something wild, but something… returning.

I pulled the curtain open.

The glass was fogged — breath or frost, I didn’t know. I wiped it with the back of my hand, the warmth of skin smearing the cold.

And then I saw him.

Not *it*, not a creature. Him.

He stood just beyond the porch, half-obscured by drifting snow, but close enough for no mistake. His face was pale, more so than any corpse should have been. His eyes were pupil-less, blank as dead moons, wide open and fixed on me. A thin, ragged gash marked the center of his forehead — not a wound from claws or blade, but a perfect, clinical hole. Round. Deliberate.

As if a bullet had tunneled straight through.

Blood — dark, almost black — matted his wisps of hair, the strands barely clinging to his spotted scalp, swaying with the wind like rot on a branch.

He didn’t move.

Didn’t flinch.

Just *watched*.

The bear was growling now — low, not the kind that warns. The kind that waits.

And I remembered something I shouldn’t have.

It was as though he wasn’t standing of his own will.

His limbs hung strangely—slack, yet precise, as if each motion, each tilt of the head or shuffle in the snow, was decided elsewhere. By something behind the veil of the real. Something *stringing him up*, like meat on hooks.

A puppet.

But not of flesh and wood.

Of *will*.

Of something colder than this frost-bitten forest. Something deeper than the roots of these ancient trees. The same force that had crafted the void, that had opened it to me like a wound in the world. The same force that now *wore* him, like a mask of meat.

The hole in his forehead seemed less like an injury and more like a *keyhole*. And something had turned it.

The bear stepped in front of me. Not protectively — not quite. More like... acknowledging what stood outside. As if it had known this moment would come.

My hands tightened around the rifle. But the barrel dipped slightly.

Because in that moment, I didn’t know who—or *what*—I’d be firing at.

And I wasn’t sure it would care.

The snow whirled gently between us like dust in an hourglass—each flake a fraction of a second stretched unbearably long. He stood beyond the window, half-formed in the blur of mist and shadow, that wound in his forehead—a black, smoldering mark—still seeping slowly, as though reality itself bled from the opening.

And I *knew*.

That bullet hadn’t vanished into the void. It had *landed*. It had marked something. Branded it. *Summoned* it.

The man before me… the friend I once laughed with on coastal roads, who once said I feared too much and did too little, who accused me of dying *before* I was ever buried—he was now some *echo*, some ragged imitation sent back through the rent I made.

His hand lifted—jerky, stuttering like a film reel skipping frames—and gave the most human gesture left in him:

A wave.

Not a hello. Not quite a farewell either.

The bear pressed closer to the window, breath misting the glass, the growl still held in its throat like an old warning passed down through generations of instinct.

The man outside tried to speak, jaw twitching, jaw locking. No sound. Only a tremble.

Then slowly… his body began to *unravel*—not flesh, not blood—but something like *static* stitched with whispers. As if the void was reclaiming what I had dared touch.

And then—he was gone.

The snow kept falling.

The silence after was *worse*.

And then it came—the howl—as though something older than time, collective as the stars, bellowed through the void, its voice aimed straight at me. It shook the cabin, the bear, the marrow of my bones.   

  


The next day, I woke with my eyelids heavy, as though sealed shut by frost. The bear stirred beside me, rising without sound. We stepped out into the pale morning and walked—no destination, only instinct—until we reached a clearing.

The trees were gone. Not cut. Not fallen. Simply... absent. As if they had shifted elsewhere or been removed by some unseen hand.

In their place, etched cleanly into the snow, were markings—familiar, yet sharper this time. A circle, lines intersecting at angles. Not random. They hinted at something. A design. A direction. A path.

Then it struck me. It was a map. A path through the woods. And the clearing—this empty, silent ring—was the origin point. The beginning.

I looked at the bear. It looked directly back at me—unblinking, steady. And though no words were spoken, I heard it clearly.

It would accompany me. I wasn’t alone.
