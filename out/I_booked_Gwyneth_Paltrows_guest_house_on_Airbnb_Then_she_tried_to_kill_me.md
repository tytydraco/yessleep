You probably saw online recently that Gwyneth Paltrow [put her guest house up on Airbnb](https://www.thecut.com/2023/08/gwyneth-paltrow-goop-airbnb.html). The article even said that she'd have dinner with her guests.

Honestly, when I first saw it, I thought it was a joke. But after I did a little digging, the opportunity appeared to be very real.

As a guy, I'm somewhat familiar with Goop and Gwyneth's general weirdness, but my girlfriend, Allyson, is *obsessed* with the woman. She even forced me to watch Shallow Hal with her on our very first date.

With our one-year anniversary coming up, I knew that I had to at least try to book the house. I also knew that if I pulled it off, my girlfriend would absolutely freak out and love me forever.

So when I sent in the request through Airbnb, I decided to include a note along with it.  I wrote about how Allyson and I bonded over her films and also how her husband had produced some of my favorite shows of all time (okay, that wasn't true but I thought that it wouldn't hurt to try and butter her up).

I guess kissing ass actually works, because much to my shock, Gwyneth's assistant, Molly, reached out to me a few days later. The girl sounded like she was maybe in her early 20s. Probably fresh out of some prestigious college. She spoke so frantically and quickly that I could barely even understand her.

"Congratulations!" squeaked Molly. "We're so excited for your visit!"

"I'm sorry, but I have to ask..." I paused. "Is this legit?"

"Of course it's legit!" said Molly. "Gwyneth is *amazing*. You'll find out soon enough. I'll circle back soon with more details, k?"

I was a real idiot for not realizing it sooner, but there was something about her tone on that initial call. She wasn't just some energetic Hollywood assistant with way too much love for her boss.

No, she almost sounded... *scared*.

\*\*\*

Molly sent me all the nitty gritty details through the Airbnb app so I could pay for the night's stay. I realized I was blowing nearly all my savings on this, but then again, when would I ever get the opportunity to do something like this for my girlfriend ever again?

When I finally told Allyson, she thought I was playing a prank on her. I had to show her all the confirmation emails to get her to believe it was real.

"No. Fucking. WAY!!!" she screamed before hugging me and asking me a million more questions. The girl was so happy. Truly. She immediately started planning out her outfit for the dinner, her hairstyle, etc.

"Dinner with Gwyneth is going to be *incredible*," I heard her say from the other room.

It's sad. At the time, I believed it, too.

\*\*\*

We drove out to Montecito that Friday afternoon and could barely contain our excitement on the way. I mean, Allyson was excited because she loved Gwyneth, but I was just kinda stoked to meet a celebrity if I'm being honest.

When we arrived to the grandiose property, Molly met us outside and gave us each big hugs.

"Welcome!" she yipped. "This is so exciting! *Yay*!"

She said she needed to take our phones so that we didn't record Gwyneth or take any unsolicited photos of her that we could sell to TMZ or something. That seemed reasonable enough. For all she knew, we were crazy superfans or something. I mean, Allyson *kind of* was, but it's not like she was a psycho.

Anyway, Molly let us into the main house and gave us a little tour. The place was... just mind-blowingly awesome. Like, I've seen celebrity homes in those YouTube tours or whatever, but being there in person was a whole other level.

"This is the first time Gwyneth has rented the guest house out," said Molly. "She's just SO happy you're here."

"We're pretty thrilled as well," added Allyson.

"So, uh, why *is* she doing this?" I asked. I didn't want the question to come off as ungrateful, but I was really curious.

"It's a brand partnership with Airbnb," Molly told us. "But also... my boss is like, genuinely the nicest human being on the planet. You'll see."

If she was *that* nice, she wouldn't be charging us an arm and a leg to stay here, I thought to myself.

Just then, Molly's phone *buzzed*. Her fingers started texting quickly before she said, "She needs me. Why don't you wait right here in the living room? She'll be down in a bit."

She scurried off before adding: "And help yourself to anything in the fridge!"

Allyson and I headed over to the fridge, which looked big enough to fit food for a family of twelve.

"This is unreal," I said.

"You're the best," she smiled.

I opened up the fridge to grab a drink, but what I saw was... pretty weird. There must have been at least a hundred of them. Murky liquid, capped in mason jars.

"What the..." I was beyond confused.

"It's just bone broth, dummy," Allyson said, grabbing one. "It's Gwyneth's favorite."

At the time, I chalked the whole thing up to just some weird health food craze, but looking back, I don't even want to begin to think about where she got the bones to make such massive quantities of that stuff.

\*\*\*

Gwyneth was literally glowing.

There were tears in my girlfriend's eyes as she hugged her idol. The woman barely seemed human. She was perfect in every way.

Her skin was perfect.

Her hair was perfect.

Her teeth were perfect.

To be honest with you, she didn't look a day over 38. The fact that the woman was 50 was simply astounding.

"And who's this handsome man?" Gwyneth finally said, poking at my shirt.

"This is my boyfriend, Tyler," Allyson announced proudly. "He's the one who booked the place."

"Well, you're certainly getting the award for best boyfriend ever," she grinned.

Call me crazy, but at the time, I thought Gwyneth Paltrow was flirting with me.

What I know is that she was probably thinking of all the ways she was going to torture me that night.

\*\*\*

We got ourselves situated in the guest house, which was, barely even a guest house. It was practically almost as massive as the main. Allyson and I had some champagne (courtesy of our host) while we got ready for our big dinner, which would be in the elegant dining room of Gwyneth's place.

"This is the best night of my life," Allyson said, curling iron in her hand.

"Me too."

"I love you," she said.

"I love you more," I responded.

That was the last time we ever said that to each other.

\*\*\*

Dinner was literally incredible.

I stayed quiet while stuffing my face, while Gwyneth and Molly started talking about Goop, which I knew was worth a quarter of a billion dollars. I'd googled it before coming. Fucking insanity.

"You seem to know a lot about our products," Gwyneth told Allyson.

"Obviously!" Allyson exclaimed. "It's like, genius! The marketing, the humor, the passion you have to make women feel powerful and capable, I adore it. Truly."

Gwyneth smiled, then said, casually: "Maybe someday soon, you can come work for us."

"I mean... I'd love to." Allyson's jaw was on the table. She turned to me, so happy. I was thrilled for her, really, but I was also hesitant. Something didn't seem right.

"I'm so proud of you, babe," I told her.

But something was off. I could feel it.

If only I'd listened to my gut.

\*\*\*

By the time we finished dessert, Allyson and I must've gone through at least two or three bottles of (very expensive) red wine. Between the food and the alcohol, I could barely walk.

"We should probably head back to the guest house," I yawned. "We don't wanna take up your whole night."

"Nonsense!" said Gwyneth. "This is the most fun I've had in forever! My husband's shooting a show in Atlanta and the kids are with my mom tonight. I've got nowhere else to be."

Allyson shot me a look that read: "Let's hang with for as long as humanly possible." I shrugged, as if I was sorry for even suggesting we spend some alone time in the guest house.

"You know what? I just thought of something we could all do together," said Gwyneth. "It's a game. The best game! Would you like to play?"

"I LOVE games!" shouted Allyson.

\*\*\*

The next thing I knew, we were standing out in the backyard, which isn't so much a "yard" as it is, in Gwyneth's words, an "eco-compound."

There was green for miles. It occurred to me in that moment that this property provided an absurd level of privacy.

In other words, there were no neighbors for miles.

"So how do we play?" asked Allyson, swaying a bit, back and forth from all the wine.

"I'll show you," said Gwyneth. Then, she shouted: "Molly?"

Molly came running up, seemingly out of nowhere, lugging a large, wooden chest that she could barely carry. She set it down on the ground with a booming thud.

"Ooohhhh, mysterious!" giggled Allyson.

But I wasn't laughing.

I knew something was wrong.

And I was right.

Gwyneth popped the chest open to reveal an ancient-looking crossbow, almost like something that would've been used for hunting hundreds of years ago.

"This was my great, great, grandfather's crossbow," she said, picking it up. "He would hunt all kinds of animals with it."

My heart started beating out of my chest.

"Actually, we're not really the hunting types," I told Gwyneth. "But we're happy to watch if you'd to play this game with, uh, yourself...."

I looked to Allyson. It seemed like for the first time, she was starting to get that same weird feeling that I had.

"Don't worry," said Gwyneth. "You won't be doing any of the hunting. That's *my* job. And also the fun part of the game."

Allyson looked confused.

But I knew what was coming.

"You two... get to be the animals."

The way she said that, so casually and calm, it was terrifying. A shiver ran down my spine.

"That isn't funny," Allyson started. "You're... making us uncomfortable."

"Animals *should* feel uncomfortable while being hunted," said Gwyneth, now loading the crossbow.

"What the fuck..." Allyson looked to me. She was starting to get really freaked out.

"Tyler, I'm scaredâ€“"

"You have thirty seconds," said Gwyneth.

I grabbed Allyson's arm.

There was no time to even process what was happening. I knew we had to move. Fast.

"Come on," I told her. "We have to run!"

Allyson looked like she was going to cry. Her perfect night with her perfect new boss had gone terribly awry.

"Please don't do this..." she begged.

"Fifteen seconds," Gwyneth smiled.

"Allyson! COME ON!"

Finally, we both started to run.

\*\*\*

The alcohol and extravagant meal really slowed us down.

I knew no one would be able to hear us, but I shouted anyway: "HELP! SOMEONE HELP US! CALL THE POLICE!"

"What the fuck is happening?!" cried Allyson.

"Clearly, Gwyneth Paltrow is trying to kill us!" I screamed back.

"But why?! Why would she do this?!"

I considered the question while we looked for a place to hide. Truthfully, I had no idea why she was doing this. Perhaps it was simply because she had grown bored of life. Or perhaps she was just rich and famous and knew she could get away with killing two random people that rented out her guest house on Airbnb.

Allyson and I eventually took cover behind some shrubbery while we tried to plan our escape.

"My keys are in the guest house. That's all the way on the other side of the property," I realized.

"Forget the keys. We can leave on foot."

I remembered first driving up to the house. There was a pretty hefty security gate we'd had to enter through. I knew there was probably some sort of barrier surrounding the compound.

I looked into the distance and saw that the property did seem to have an end in sight - in the form of a massive wall. I didn't even know if it was scalable, to be honest, but we had to try.

Before we started to run, Allyson tugged my shirt and put a finger to her lips. *Shh*.

That's when I heard Gwyneth's footsteps, getting closer to us.

"I guess I should've warned you that I'm very good at this game," she shouted from the darkness. "In fact, I've never lost..."

We stayed hidden, in the green.

My heart was pounding so fast I was afraid she'd hear it.

As soon as there was enough distance between us, I whispered to Allyson: "3, 2, 1. Now!"

We ran in the opposite direction, towards the exterior wall of the compound.

"Is she behind us?!" Allyson asked. She didn't want to look back.

"Just keep running!" I told her.

About a second later, I looked back.

Gwyneth was hot on our trail and looked like a crazed woman, smiling in the night, hunting us humans for sport.

Once we finally got to the wall, there was a *thwip* sound and a crossbow bolt stuck itself in the grass right near our feet.

A warning shot.

"Turn around," Gwyneth demanded.

I grabbed Allyson's hand and held it tight. "Don't be scared," I told her. "Everything's going to be fine..."

Obviously, I was lying.

At that moment, there was no doubt in my mind that were both going to die that night.

"Allyson," said Gwyneth. "Come over here."

"Please stop... please..." Allyson mumbled, crying softly.

"*I said come here*," Gwyneth demanded.

She didn't have a choice.

Allyson walked over to her.

I held my breath.

But then, something unexpected happened. Instead of shooting her with the crossbow, she handed the weapon to my girlfriend.

"What... what are you doing?" Allyson asked, a fearful shakiness in her voice.

"I'm going to give you a choice," Gwyneth told her. "If you choose *me*, then you can start working at Goop as early as tomorrow. You'll meet the whole team. You'll love them and they'll love you."

I was so confused. What the fuck was happening?

"My company will change your life as you know it," Gwyneth continued. "You'll be part of a movement. One that cares about empowering women - and making more money than you could ever dream of."

Allyson looked back to me. "And if I choose *him*?"

"Well, then... I'm afraid I'll have to kill you both."

Allyson looked like she had no idea what to do.

"Go on, Allyson. Shoot him."

Allyson looked to me, then back to Gwyneth. I couldn't fucking believe that she was even considering doing what she was about to do.

"Allyson... PLEASE..." I begged. "I'M YOUR FUCKING BOYFRIEND!"

A tear ran down her face.

"I'm sorry, Tyler..." Allyson said softly. "But it's Gwyneth Fucking Paltrow."

She'd made up her mind.

I was terrified while I waited for the end.

Here I was, thinking I'd be killed by a celebrity.

But instead, it would be my own girlfriend who chose to end my life.

She *shot* the crossbow and the bolt pierced my skin instantaneously. I screamed as I saw the thing sticking out of my arm. Blood seeping out of the wound.

Everything was going hazy with the pain, but I could hear Gwyneth cackling, as if someone had just her the funniest joke ever written.

"Again!" Gwyneth screamed. "Shoot him again!"

I turned and saw the wall. *Fuck this,* I thought. *I might as well die climbing.*

I was halfway up before they knew what hit them.

"Shoooot him!"

Allyson let off a few more shots, but missed me each time.

I still don't know if that was on purpose or not.

After I scaled the wall, I fell down a dirt hill and didn't stop rolling for what felt like a hundred yards.

Eventually, I landed harshly on a private road.

I had no idea where I was.

I could hear Gwyneth still screaming from above.

I got up and ran and didn't stop.

\*\*\*

After a few minutes, I saw headlights and flagged down a car. The man driving saw the bolt in my arm and agreed to drive me to the nearest hospital, which was about fifteen minutes away.

During the drive, I was still in shock.

He asked me what'd happened.

"Gwyneth Paltrow tried to kill me," I said.

It was silent for a moment, then the guy started laughing.

"The lady from *Shallow Hal?* Are you on drugs?"

That's around the time I realized no one would ever believe me.

I was a guy with a crossbow bolt in my arm.

And she was Gwyneth Paltrow.

\*\*\*

At the hospital, the doctors patched up my arm.

When they asked what happened to me, I lied and said some friends and I were fucking around with a crossbow and it was just some silly accident.

What was the point in even telling the truth? No one would ever buy it.

A few nights later,  I got a notification on my phone. Allyson's LinkedIn account, which I don't even remember following, had posted an update.

She was now listed as a **Goop** employee.

My heart sank.

And that's when I realized I'd never see my girlfriend again.

I don't know what I'm going to do now - or if Gwyneth will ever try and finish the job - but here's my advice to you: if some celebrity ever puts their guest house up on Airbnb, do NOT rent it out.
