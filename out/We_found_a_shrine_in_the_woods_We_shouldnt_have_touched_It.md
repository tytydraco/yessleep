The first time I saw her, she was standing in front of a wall of overpriced coffee beans, looking like she was about three minutes away from committing a felony.

It was a Tuesday. One of those brittle city mornings where the sky feels too heavy and every car horn sounds like a threat. I was just there for beans — the good stuff — because I’m too stubborn to drink whatever watered down nonsense the corner bodega tries to pass off as coffee. She looked like she might’ve been there for the same reason. Or maybe just to start a fight.

Dark curls shoved into a messy knot, olive-green eyes sharp and restless, black boots scuffed from something that wasn’t fashion. Pretty in the way a locked door is pretty — you know you shouldn’t want to open it, but you do anyway. Maybe especially because you shouldn’t.

We reached for the same coffee bag at the same time. She laughed, low and a little startled.

"You can have it," she said, voice dry as a drought. "I’m probably just gonna let it sit on my counter until I forget it exists."

I shrugged. "You'll be the tragic hero Starbucks writes sonnets about."

Somehow — and don’t ask me how, because I honestly don’t remember taking the first step — we ended up at the little coffee bar shoved in the corner of the shop. Talking. About nothing and everything. The way you do when the air shifts in your chest and you know this moment’s about to lodge itself into your ribs forever.

Her name was Claire. She had a husband. Apartment in the city. Marble countertops. Lighting fixtures that probably cost more than my entire plumbing system. She said the place felt like a museum — white walls, gold edges, cold air that never quite let her breathe right.

She talked about it casually, like it didn’t matter. But there was something brittle in her voice. Something worn and tired.

"I keep waiting to feel like I belong there," she told me. "But all I ever feel is... displaced."

I told her I lived an hour north in a house with crooked floors and foxes as quiet neighbors. I also told her about the house for sale near me — out in the sticks, barely clinging to the edges of civilization. "Old bones," I said. "Woods thick enough to swallow you whole if you’re not careful."

Claire’s eyes lit up. A week later, she came to see it.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

And she kept coming back. Not for the house. Not really.

Somehow, we got... close. Not quite the kind of close you put a label on. Friends. Almost more. Circling something neither of us said out loud because we weren’t stupid — just stupid enough.

Two months after that first visit, she knocked on my door with mud on her boots, hair frizzed from the drive, and a small box of strawberries cradled under her arm like a peace offering for a battle we never really led.

I opened the door before she could knock again. Jinx, my smoky-gray cat with an ego the size of the Appalachians, wound between my legs, immediately glaring up at Claire like she was a burglar with bad taste.

"Back again," I said. "Starting to think you like it out here."

"Starting to think you’re allergic to doorbells," she shot back, stepping inside without waiting for permission, brushing damp curls off her forehead. "City was eating me alive today. Thought I’d get a head start on surviving."

Jinx, being Jinx, immediately tried to trip Claire as she crossed the kitchen, weaving between her legs with calculated chaos.

"Jinx missed you," I said, settling back against the counter.

"Jinx wants me dead so she can inherit the property," Claire muttered, bending down to scratch behind Jinx’s ears anyway. The cat purred like a broken engine, smug.

Claire dropped her bag with a thud by the door and beelined for the coffee.

"Where’s the sugar?" she called over her shoulder.

I pointed. "The red tin next to the coffee. Top shelf. Behind the emergency whiskey."

Claire squinted up at it. "I can't *reach* the top shelf, genius," she said. "Also, there is also some sugar spilled on your counter. You know ants in the house are a real problem, right? 'Cause that's what you’ll be getting if you continue living like an unsupervised raccoon."

I blinked at her. Low, slow, the way a cat blinks when it's deciding whether to purr or bite.

"First of all," I said, pushing off the counter with a lazy stretch that somehow managed to be a threat, "you act like you’re not three steps away from being crowned Queen of the Tiny People. If you can conquer a forest with your bare hands, you can sure as hell climb a chair for some sugar." Then I spotted the tiny smudge of white dust she pointed out — catching the light, mocking me.

"Second of all," I muttered, grabbing a rag and wiping it up in two quick, vicious sweeps, "this is not a problem. This is an *opportunity* to crush the enemy before they even know they're at war."

I tossed the rag into the sink, turned, and gestured grandly at the now-pristine counter like a magician revealing an empty hat. "There. No ants. No uprising. No siege. Just my kitchen."

Claire grabbed the now-accessible sugar tin and dumped a questionable amount into her coffee without breaking eye contact. The clouds rumbled low overhead. Outside, the woods leaned a little closer to the windows, just enough to make the light inside feel bruised.

"*Uh... anyway.*" she said, tone shifting just slightly. "Found any more of those weird symbols etched into the trees behind your house?"

I stiffened just a hair, enough that she caught it.

"Yeah," I said, reaching for a chipped mug, holding it up to the light like maybe it had answers hidden in the cracks. "Found another one yesterday. North side, just past the garden fence."

Claire frowned, setting her mug down with a soft clink.

"Could be runes," she said. "Could be witches. Could be kids trespassing. Don't know what's worse."

"It's not kids," I said. "Not unless they're carrying knives and an uncomfortable amount of free time."

Claire leaned back against the counter, sipping her coffee, watching me with that tilted-head, considering look she did when she was filing things away for later.

"Maybe you can teach me some vegetation names in Latin along the way," she said dryly. "You know. For all the information I’m gonna immediately forget."

I grinned, sharp and lazy. 

"Gladly. You'll be a walking encyclopedia of irrelevant facts in no time."

We spent the next hour half-pretending we weren’t stalling — picking over an old stack of records in the living room, eating strawberries straight from the box, trading insults too quick to really sting. By the time we pulled our boots on and stepped outside, the world had gone too still. The usual bird chatter was gone, swallowed whole by a silence so thick it stuck to your teeth when you breathed.

Claire hesitated on the porch, looking out over the garden where wild mint clawed up between the boards and the peppers sagged heavy with rain.

"You sure about this?" she asked, voice low.

"Absolutely not," I said.

"I mean, I’m not scared or anything but… Why are you so weird all of a sudden?” she replied.

"I’m always weird," I shot back, grinning too sharp. "You're just paying attention now."

She laughed — that wild, sudden bark of real joy that made my ribs ache — and headed down the steps without waiting. “*God help me”,* I thought, trailing after her, “*I’d follow her anywhere.”*

She led away from the house and out from the garden, because of course she did — stubborn, fearless, too alive to be careful. And I let her, because part of me wanted to see what would happen if we stopped pretending the woods didn’t want something from us. Jinx, trailing us at a distance like she had somewhere better to be, paused once — ears flicking back, tail low — before slinking after us anyway. 

"You’re walking like you’ve got a vendetta against dirt," I said, keeping a few steps behind, half to tease her, half to keep an eye on the woods closing around us.

Claire tossed a look over her shoulder, curls bouncing.

"Maybe I do," she said. "Maybe dirt deserves it."

We pushed deeper. Past the sagging fence that marked the end of my property. Past the half-collapsed stone wall that once meant something to someone. Past the safe places I usually kept her.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The first mark appeared about ten minutes in.

Claire froze. I nearly crashed into her.

It was the one I already saw. Carved low into the bark of an old oak, almost hidden by the sagging ferns: a rough circle, lines inside it like a compass snapping under pressure.

"Harper. What the hell is that?" she whispered, reaching out without touching. “That doesn't look like a rune. It looks like one of those.. Apot o.. Atropo..”

“Apotropaic," I drawled out, tasting the word slow and deliberate. "You're thinking of apotropaic symbols. Protective marks. Meant to ward off evil, not invite it in for coffee and a chat."

I stepped a little closer to the tree, brushing my fingertips just above the carving — not touching it, just *feeling* the space around it. “You’re right. This isn't a rune. It's a warning. Or maybe a *barrier.*" I glanced sideways at her, one eyebrow cocked. "Which raises the real question… What the hell is somebody trying to *keep out?* Or worse. What were they trying to *keep in?*"

The cuts were deep. Not old graffiti, not bored kids. This was *deliberate.* We stood there, shoulder to shoulder, pretending we didn’t feel the weight of the woods settling heavier on our skin. I wanted to say something cocky. Something stupid. Break the tension before it snapped. But the words stuck.

"We should keep moving," I said.

"*Toward* the evil witch trees?" Claire asked, eyebrow arching.

"Through it," I corrected, smirking just enough to make her snort under her breath.

We pushed forward as the woods thickened fast — the air got cooler, heavier, like someone's pressed a hand right against the pulse of the world. Around us, every bird and branch and breath felt like it was listening. Like it *wants* to hear what we’ll say next. It got wetter underfoot — the ground giving way to a slow, sucking bog that clung to our boots. 

Claire walked just ahead of me, boots dragging a little in the moss. Every now and then she’d glance over her shoulder — checking, measuring, maybe just making sure I was still there. We hadn’t hit the creek yet but the smell was starting to change. Water and rot and something older curling under it all.

That’s when I spotted it.

"Hold up," I said, voice low enough that it barely scraped the air.

Claire froze instantly, like a hunted thing, and turned back toward me.

There, about ten feet off the path, was another tree. Older. Gnarled. Its bark was split open in a jagged wound. And burned into the surface — the same circle as before. But inside the circle this time: a triangle, sharp and crooked, like it had been carved with something dull and angry.

The marks looked wrong. Too deep. Too frantic. The kind of desperate carving that meant whoever did it wasn’t thinking about art. They were thinking about survival.

Claire drifted toward it first, almost like she couldn’t help herself.

I didn’t call her back. Maybe because I was just as bad. Maybe because part of me needed to see what the hell this meant too. We stood there, side by side, staring up at it.

The wind picked up — low and mean — dragging the smell of wet earth and old, rusted iron around us in heavy, greasy ribbons. Somewhere deep in the woods, a branch cracked — not like it broke naturally, but like it was twisted too hard.

Claire shivered. Not from the cold. She turned to me, voice tight, almost rasping.

"Same symbol," she said. "But different. The triangle… it’s new."

I nodded, throat tight. The back of my neck prickled, not with fear exactly, something worse. Recognition. Like we weren’t finding these marks. Like they were finding *us.* Then she looked back at the path ahead. The land dipped down there, shallow and muddy — the shimmer of the creek barely visible through the tangle of trees.

"We're close," she said and stepped back first. I stayed one second longer, staring at that raw, angry triangle like maybe it was trying to tell me something. But now all we could hear was the creek. Thin, reedy water slicing through the woods — not the babbling, cheerful sound you'd want. More like breathing. Shallow and wet.

The wind picked up and she turned around, one hand rising instinctively like she was feeling for something in the air. It hit me too, seconds later. The *smell.* Thick. Sweet at first, almost floral — but underneath, rotten. Like meat left too long in the sun, wrapped in wet earth and sickly sap.

"Christ," she muttered. "That’s not just 'something died' bad. That’s 'something died, got buried, changed its mind, and died again' bad."

I huffed a rough laugh, mostly to remind myself how to breathe.

"You’re poetic when you're grossed out," I said.

"Flattering," she said, voice muffled. "Add it to my resume."

We kept moving, slower now. Boots sinking into mud, slipping on wet stones. The woods weren't just heavy anymore. They were *watching.* Finally we reached the creek we heard.

"There’s something on the other side," she said.

I peered through the tangled branches. There was something. Another mark, maybe. A shape against the trees that didn’t quite belong. But between us and it, the creek stretched wide and slow. 

Claire turned to me, mouth tight.

"Maybe we should come back another day," she said. "Get real gear. Flashlights. Maybe a priest." 

I hesitated. Because she wasn’t wrong. Every cell in my body was screaming to listen to her. Get out. Go back. Lock the door and forget. But Claire was standing there, stubborn and brilliant and just a little too alive for her own good. And something in the woods… *something wanted us to keep going.*

I stepped forward, splashing into the shallows without looking back.

"Come on," I said, voice low. "You said you weren’t scared."

She cursed under her breath but followed — because she’s the kind of woman who doesn't leave someone behind, even when she knows better. The creek pulled at our boots. Sucked at our ankles. Cold enough to bite, warm enough to warn. Halfway across, she stumbled, grabbing for me. My hand shot out instinctively, catching her wrist, hauling her upright. She was soaked, shivering, breathing hard — and for a second, it would’ve been so easy to lean in, to press my forehead against hers, to forget the woods, the stink, the everything except the heat of her hand in mine.

But I didn’t.

Women like Claire weren’t meant to be caught. Especially not by women like me.

We reached the other side, dripping and breathing hard. Ahead of us, the woods slowly opened into a clearing — and at its center, something worse than carvings or rotting smells. Something man-made. Something *waiting.*

We were looking at a mound of disturbed earth. A shrine of bones and string and blackened stones.

Jinx didn’t follow us across the creek.

Smart cat.

Smarter than us.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

"We shouldn’t be here," Claire said, voice wrecked to almost nothing.

She wasn’t wrong. But it was already too late. We had seen the marks. We had crossed the water. We had let the woods close around us like a mouth.

Turning back wasn’t an option anymore. It hadn’t been since the first time she stepped into my kitchen and smiled like she didn’t know she was carrying a match into a room soaked in gasoline. We’re here now. And the clearing yawned open like a wound in front of us.

No birds. No insects. Just the wet slap of water dripping off the trees and the brittle crackle of our own breathing. The mound at the center was a mess of churned-up earth, sagging like a shallow grave someone lost interest in digging. The shrine beside it — if you could call it that — looked like it had been pieced together by blind, furious hands.

Bones lashed together with rotted twine. Stones stacked into a crooked spire, black at the tips like they’d been charred. Scraps of cloth knotted and left to rot in the rain, reds and yellows faded into sick grays. And wedged into the dirt at the base of it all — a mirror. Or what was left of one.

The glass cracked and filmy, half-buried like someone tried to shove it into the earth and gave up halfway through. The air was wrong here. Not just humid — thick, clinging, *wet in a way that felt alive.* Like something was trying to slip under your skin when you weren’t looking.

Claire’s voice broke the silence, too soft.

"Harper, what the hell is this?"

I crouched by the edge of the mound, not touching, just... looking.

The bones weren’t animal. Or if they were, they weren’t *normal.* Long and fine and splintered in ways that didn’t make sense. Like they’d been twisted before they broke.

Claire drifted closer, footsteps squelching in the mud.

"You ever seen anything like this?" she asked, voice raw.

I shook my head once.

"No," I said. "But it’s not new. It’s been built up — over and over. Like someone keeps coming back."

Claire crouched beside me, close enough I could smell the rain and strawberries still clinging to her jacket.

"Those symbols," she said, nodding toward a nearby tree." There's more of them. Different shapes this time."

I followed her gaze. Another carving, fresh and angry — not a protective circle this time, but a rectangle slashed through with jagged lines. A door, maybe. Or a prison.

Claire swallowed hard. "Whatever they were trying to keep out..." Her voice trailed off.

Or in.

Neither of us said it out loud, but it hung there anyway.

The smell shifted — sour and sharp — and something moved.

Not the trees. Not the wind. Something heavier. Something wrong.

I snapped upright, scanning the clearing — but there was nothing. Just the stones. The bones. The rotting strings.

"Harper," Claire said, voice low and urgent. "We should go."

I opened my mouth to agree — to grab her hand, to pull her back toward the safety of garden fences and coffee-stained kitchens — when I saw it.

Another mirror. Not buried. Hung.

High up in the trees, just above our heads. Tied with string so rotted it should've snapped by now. The mirror swayed in the sluggish breeze, catching just enough light to flicker something awful across the clearing. Like a gasping mouth.

Without thinking, I grabbed Claire’s wrist — too tight — because if we didn’t move now, we wouldn’t move at all.

"We’re leaving," I said. No more questions. No more bravado.

I stumbled back from the shrine, boots slipping in the mud; when my heel caught on something.

It wasn’t a stone. It *gave* under me — soft and brittle — with a sound that vibrated through my teeth.

*Crack.* 

Ugly. Wet.

I looked down. Half-buried in the muck, hidden by dead leaves and the stink of rot — a bundle. Twine twisted tight around tiny bones. Wilting flower stems knotted so hard they snapped like old tendons.

An offering. A warning. And I had crushed it. Split it wide open like an egg underfoot.

The bones spilled out into the mud, clicking as they entered the ground. The air changed. Thicker. Lower. Like something vast and heavy had just opened its eyes underground.

"Harper?" Claire’s voice, sharp with something I hadn’t heard before — real fear — but she was too close, too fast—

She stepped forward, foot driving straight into the scattered mess.

The twine snapped under her boot. The last of the bones pushed deeper into the dirt.

And just like that — whatever thin line had been holding this place together — snapped with it.

The clearing tightened around us, sudden and suffocating, like the trees were breathing in. The stink of rot bloomed, sick and sweet and wrong, thick enough to choke. And somewhere in the mud, under the ruined bundle, under the crushed flowers and broken bones — something shifted. Something *breathed.*

Claire yanked her foot back, stumbling into me. Her hand caught my jacket, fingers clenching like a drowning swimmer reaching for a rope. But it was too late. We broke something we weren’t supposed to break.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

We didn’t stop running until we hit the garden fence.

Claire vaulted it first, landing in a crouch that sent mud splattering across the rain-bloated mint. I scrambled after her, boots slipping on the wet boards. Only when we were both on the other side — gasping, shaking, filthy — did we finally slow down enough to realize how quiet it had gotten.

Not just the woods. The house. The sky.

The world was holding its breath, and we were the reason why.

Jinx was waiting for us on the porch, tail twitching like a metronome wound too tight. She didn’t meow. She didn’t move. Just stared at us with slitted, furious eyes like we did something unimaginable. Maybe we had.

Claire dropped into the nearest chair on the porch, elbows braced on her knees, staring at the churned-up ground like it was going to start whispering any second.

"We’re fine," I said. It was automatic. Reflex. A lie.

She barked a hollow laugh, scrubbing a hand over her face.

"Yeah," she said. "Totally. Just found a human-sized shrine rotting in your backyard. Definitely fine."

I didn’t answer. Didn’t trust what would come out if I tried.

Instead, I dragged the garden hose over, started washing the creek muck off our boots and hands like that would be enough — like it could scrub away what we saw.

It didn’t.

Water ran red and brown across the porch. Claire watched it trickle between the boards like blood seeping through bandages. Jinx made a low, unhappy noise and slunk inside.

Claire finally looked up at me — and there it was.

The question she wasn’t asking. The one hanging in the wet air between us.

*What did we wake up?*

I shoved the thought down hard and forced a smile that tasted like copper.

"You staying the night?" I asked.

Claire hesitated. Long enough that it hurt.

Then she shook her head, standing stiffly, brushing off her jeans.

"I should get back," she said. "If I’m gone too long..."

She trailed off, but I knew. The marble walls. The life she wasn’t living.

I didn’t argue. Didn’t ask her to stay. Didn’t tell her I was scared in a way I hadn’t been since I was ten years old, huddled under a tree line while my father hunted something we couldn’t name.

Because if she stayed… If she stayed, maybe it would stay too. And if she left… What if it follows her?

I watched her gather her things — the half-empty box of strawberries, the mud-streaked jacket — and walk to her car.

She didn’t look back.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Claire got home just before dusk.

Let herself into the sterile marble box she lived in.

Dropped her keys on the table.

Kicked off her boots. 

Texted me not to worry.

Probably told herself it was fine. Probably made coffee she didn’t drink. Probably stared out at the lights of the city, too bright, too far away.

I didn’t hear from her for a week after that, and for better or worse, *I am* starting to get worried.
