I’ve been working as a line cook for the past 19 years. I'm pushing 40 at this point but could easily pass for someone close to sixty.



I live in a shitty apartment and I haven’t had a real relationship since I was like 25.Does any of that matter really? I think so, I think it matters where I am in life to emphasize how strange all of this feels to me.



I was taking a smoke break last night, dinner rush had concluded a bit ago and the last couple of tables were practically just waiting on deserts as I stood out back of the restaurant.



The rain was pouring down something fierce and I could hear the subdued laughter of a couple running to their car as I fished out the blue camel from the practically crushed pack. I stood there for a moment with the bud in my mouth flicking at the lighter for a few moments but it was to no avail, the thing had been on fumes for a while now and it really was just a matter of time.



“That’s why I use matches, you always know when you are close to running out”



The voice that spoke was on the older side, had a soft gruff to it as it handed me a box of matches.



My eyes looked over at the figure, I would say around mid fifties or so with hair that should have gone bald years ago and an unkempt beard. Technically no one was allowed back here but I wasn’t about to turn down my chance to light a smoke, I reached out for the packet, took it, struck a match and lit my cigarette, taking a slow drag from it.“Thanks man” was all I said before moving over to a nearby milk create and sitting down with a soul crushing sigh.“Got one to spare?” The man asked and while normally I ain’t the kind to just hand out cigs to whoever asks, it was only fair as I used his light so I tossed the pack in his direction and he lit it as I had. With smoke flowing from between yellow stained teeth he chuckled lightly. “My son has been trying to make me quit for a lifetime at this point, but sometimes you just have one of those days.”



I didn’t answer, simply nodded in confirmation as I caught the pack when he threw it back to me, putting the thing in my pocket and leaning back against the wall with my legs outstretched.

Then there was silence, I sat there for a good 5 minutes practically forgetting that the man was even there before he spoke once again.



“Do you believe the world to be cruel Kenny? ”It took me at least 10 seconds to register what he had said, sitting up more fully now with furrowed brow I stared at him, “what?”“Do you believe the world to be cruel?”I blinked a few times, I must have misheard him, only made sense, I was hour 14 into my shift, 5 beers in and half asleep already, so instead of worrying about it I simply shrugged, taking a slow inhale from the cigarette as I stared out into the rain filled night I ran a tongue over my upper teeth and finally answered.



“Nah, cruelty is a product, has to be created to be cruel”



A light chuckle came from the man now, “I guess that means you aren’t the religious type huh.”



Once more I shrugged, it never really was a thing I had thought about, my mom used to take me to church but as soon as I was old enough to choose I would rather spend my Sundays drinking and sitting at home.



The man crouched down now so we were about the same height, I didn’t even look at him as he continued to speak.



“I think you are rotting from the inside Kenny” This time I knew I heard it, so I sat up fully, turned to the guy to verbally cuss him out but I only got to the point where I stared into his eyes. And as I did I saw everything about myself, every part of my life ripped up and displayed deep within this man's eyes, things seen from people around me and seen by me all displayed at the same time within my brain.



I don’t know how long had passed when my eyes refocused, it felt like eternity yet the eyes were normal again when I blinked, my mouth was dry and my cheeks were wet from my own tears.



The man smiled, he knew that I knew who he was and he spoke to me once again.



“You are a rotting corpse of a man Kenny, and I am tired of people like you”



"W-what?" It was all I could stammer forward, my brain feeling fuzzy and yet hyper focused on this person before me, all at the same time, as if nothing else existed in this very moment, all I could do was stare and listen to him speak.



“You aren’t the first and you won’t be the last Kevin, you barely live for 50 fucking years, walking around only smiling when you get to lie in bed and then you keel over from a heart attack alone in an unvacuumed apartment where the only reason someone finds you is cause the neighbor complains about a weird smell”



I stared as he took another slow drag from his cigarette, I had dropped my own long ago.



The man let out a sigh and shook his head, then a smile spread over it, and for the first time I could fully see those yellow teeth, despite the discoloring they sat perfectly in his mouth, each one the same length and size like a doll.



“I am sick and tired of it, so I think I am done… at least that was my initial plan, but that would be cruel, a created cruelty, ridding the world of people that didn’t know they did anything wrong for choosing to barely exist at all” He sighed loudly and stood up fully now, letting the cigarette fall to the ground where he stomped it out.



“So instead I'm giving you all 5 years, that should be enough time to do something about it, see if you really wanna do this whole being alive thing, to be fucking human, if you can’t do that, I'm getting rid of you, and everyone else just like you, and the world will be better for it”



I had no idea what to say, all I could do was nod, literally, my head agreed to this notion automatically and the being nodded back to me with a smile.



“Good, Here is to hoping you’ll be one of those that makes it, if not, see ya in five” and once more he smiled at me, yellow doll like teeth only there till i had blinked and he was gone.



I went home after that, I haven’t slept since then, I haven’t eaten, I don’t know what to do, I have a 5 year deadline to be something, be human? I AM HUMAN, please, if anyone knows what it means to be alive, to be human, I need to know… please?
