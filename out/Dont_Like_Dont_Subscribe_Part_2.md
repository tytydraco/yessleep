Thank you for supporting me; it has kind of worked!

I don’t know when you will read this. I have gone through your comments, but I cannot see the timestamps as they are glitchy, so who knows when you wrote me back. I also cannot answer your comments, as whatever this is does not let me. Still, some of your words and support have given me comfort. Please stay with me!

When I had posted before, I had not tagged the post as a series. I had hoped it would end with telling you about what happened. But now, I see that it is marked as one. That terrifies me more than the room I am in right now, more than the window that is not a window. I now fear that more will happen, but perhaps posting will help me get out of here…

Almost immediately after I had posted about what happened, a message appeared on my phone. It was from the same weird number that had sent me the link to the YouTube channel.

***They SUPPORTED you. You are allowed to keep them ENTERTAINED. A VIDEO was posted. There will be MORE if you get more support.***

Again, I was not able to answer the message; it still would not let me. My phone was probably hacked, and all I can access is that one single chat. I am able to post on r/nosleep—at least I can do that—but I hate that I cannot comment. Some of you told me to send you the link for the YouTube Channel, SocietyofEB, but I cannot do that. I am unable to copy the link and type down the symbols it contains. But... perhaps that is for the best? Just don't look for the channel on your own. I still wonder why I was singled out by whatever is going on. Why did Aubrey contact me and not someone else?

Aubrey... are you real? Or were you just a lure to get me into this hell?

I can still read other stories from r/nosleep, but they terrify me, and I was becoming even more afraid, so I stopped reading them. I now know that at least some weird messed up stuff can happen in real life, and stories like this are not just fun and games anymore. But at least I seem to be able to post more information about my situation, and perhaps you will have ideas that I don't have. Perhaps that will help me get out. At least I hope so.

As I said before, you are giving me comfort. Thank you all. Then again, perhaps all of you and your kind answers are not real and just a sick game being played, giving me false hope. But I will not assume that. I need something to hold on to.

The message on my phone had said that there was a new video on the channel. So, hoping for some change in this weird situation, I went there. Indeed, I could now see one new video, but I wish I had not. The thumbnail was weird and showed a foggy forest, but the colors were all wrong and distorted. It was titled "Forest #1 – Ruins.mov." The title reminded me a lot of the video I had seen before, the one I had sent to my friends earlier today.

My friends... I wonder if they are okay. I wonder if my friends read the post as well and know who I am. Somehow. At least they can tell my parents about what happened.

Nonetheless, I felt compelled to watch the video. What else was I supposed to do? Just sit here, doing nothing? So I clicked on the thumbnail and put on my headphones. It immediately went into fullscreen mode, and an eerie static noise filled my ears. I already despised it.

The screen remained dark, a black void, for a long time, and the noise intensified, making me anxious. I couldn't look away from the screen, even though there was nothing to see.

Suddenly, a dark black and white video appeared, depicting someone cautiously walking through a forest. The sound of rustling leaves and whistling wind accompanied the footage. The person seemed hesitant, moving slowly. There were occasional scene changes, but the person mostly continued forward. Whoever it was, they appeared terrified.

As creepy as this was, one of the clips included a strange noise in the distance. It was deep, distorted, and almost animalistic, reminiscent of a predator's cry. The next scene after that showed the person running, followed by a quick cut to a peculiar tree with a makeshift structure built from branches and wood. It resembled something children might construct, like a wooden teepee, but there was an unsettling aura about it.

The person behind the camera approached the structure, but suddenly, the strange sound echoed once more, this time farther away, startling the person filming. The camera began to shake and abruptly cut away.

Another scene unfolded—a single image scrolled across the screen. There was no doubt it still portrayed the same forest, but a haunting archway dominated the center of the picture, standing in a clearing. It appeared broken and weathered, perhaps having decayed over the years or even millennia. Moreover, the image seemed artificial, lacking realism, almost as if it had been painted. The noise grew louder until the screen went black again. I hoped it was over. I hoped that was all I had to endure, that I would now be released from this dreadfully familiar yet hellish place. But then, words appeared on the screen, accompanied by a creepy robotic voice.

***I am your FRIEND. I need the CUBE. Bring me the CUBE. It is in the RUINS. Do. not. FAIL. me.***

What the hell did that mean? What was happening? My Friend? What Friend? What cube? This was utter madness. I felt like I was trapped in a nightmarish realm - and that was probably the truth. The video finally stopped.

Shit. What was I supposed to do now? I stood up and walked to the window, my heart pounding in my chest. The scenery outside hadn't changed; I still gazed at the bizarrely illuminated, painted replica of my neighborhood.

Maybe the door?

I hesitated, overwhelmed by a sickening feeling that nearly made me vomit as I glanced at it. The door had been locked until now, and behind it, a disturbing terror lurked. I didn't dare get closer and retreated back to my chair.

FUCK!

I refused to open that damn door. I wouldn't play by its rules. Or their rules? Whatever had dragged me into this twisted nightmare.

The video remained accessible and had already amassed 22 views. Who else was entangled in this with me? Aubrey? Assuming Aubrey even existed. Assuming I wasn't trapped in a fever dream, hallucinating all of this. A part of me hoped that was the case. I couldn't leave a comment on the video either, so communicating with others seemed impossible. If there were indeed other people in a similar situation, like me.

Suddenly, the video began playing again. To my horror, it started glitching out and only repeated the final part with the strange metallic voice.

***I am your FRIEND. I need the CUBE. Bring me the CUBE. It is in the RUINS. Do. not. FAIL. me.***

Those words echoed relentlessly from the speakers and through my headset, piercing my mind like needles. I attempted to shut it off, disconnect the headset, and mute the speakers, but nothing worked. I collapsed to the floor, pressing my hands against my ears, yet unable to drown out the message.

Then, it ceased.

For a moment, relief washed over me. Finally, it had stopped! Finally, I could regain my composure!

As I sat there, attempting to process everything, a coldness began to seep into my head. Shivers ran down my spine, and the presence of the door loomed ominously behind me. My stomach churned, and I felt as if I were about to faint.

I was certain that something was approaching. Something was coming from beyond the door.

I didn't dare look around, but vivid images of the door swinging open and an unspeakable horror invading the room flashed through my mind. My heart pounded so forcefully that its beats reverberated in my ears.

And in the silence, a knock.

BAM.

The door shook audibly as someone or something struck against it.

I jerked, my heart aching, and turned around, my gaze fixed on the door handle. Was it still locked?

Oh shit.

I prayed that it was still locked.

Another round of knocking, followed by a distant, hoarse, distorted voice.

*"David... David... You need to give me the cube... You can't just sit here... I need my cube..."*

Fucking FUCK! What the... I couldn't believe any of this. None of it.

"Who are you? What the FUCK are you? Why are you doing this? Leave me alone!"

The knocking ceased, but scratching commenced, akin to a desperate cat clawing at the door, attempting to gain entry.

*"David... David... I am your Friend... Everyone needs a Friend... You have to get the cube, or I will have to hurt you... I need my cube... I want my cube..."*

Hurt me? What? Wait... Did Aubrey mention this entity when she spoke of a "Friend"? Had this creature been sending the messages? Shit.

*"You have seven hours... I want my cube... Or I will come in... And I will hurt you... I don't want to hurt you, so bring me the cube... I am your Friend, don't forget..."*

To my horror, the door handle moved downward, and in terror, I heard a squeaking sound as the door opened—just a crack, barely noticeable. I couldn't see the other side yet, but the faint ray of light entering my room confirmed that it was indeed no longer shut.

The mere thought of that thing... my Friend... still lurking outside, waiting for me to step into the hallway and tear me apart, or worse, made me freeze. I sat there for a moment, attempting to breathe in and out, to calm down, to find solace in the godforsaken hell I found myself in.

My phone suddenly vibrated, causing me to jump. Shit. I retrieved it from my pocket, and to my horror, I saw that the timer app had opened and started counting down.

6:57:34 remaining.

FUCK!

I needed to escape. I had to somehow locate the cube and bring it to this Friend-thing, whatever the fuck it was. I stood up, eyeing the ray of light that streamed into the room, but hesitated as I heard the distant rustling of trees.

Trees?

The presence I had sensed earlier had vanished. At least the icy feeling in my stomach had subsided. I still felt sick, but it was a slight improvement. With trembling hands, I approached the door. The scent of fresh leaves filled my nostrils. I grabbed the door handle and pulled it open, cautiously.

Beyond the door, there was no hallway. Instead, I found myself in a forest—a lush, green forest that stretched as far as my eyes could see. The wind whistled through the trees, causing the leaves to rustle. It was either dawn or dusk; I couldn't quite discern, but the scenery was undeniably beautiful. I stepped outside, feeling the breeze caress my cheeks, and closed my eyes.

I was in a forest.

Just moments ago, I had been in a strange room that resembled my own, and now I found myself in this forest. The whole situation felt incredibly surreal.

Oh no!

The video.

The images from that cursed channel flooded my mind. Had they been filmed in this very forest? If so... Whatever had pursued the person in the video might still roam among these trees, searching for its next victim. But there could also be another person nearby, someone who might be able to help me. Perhaps whoever filmed the video was still here?

I turned around, hesitating. The doorway leading back to my room just stood in the midst of the forest. I walked around it, but on the other side, where my room should have been, there was only a small brick wall. How was any of this even possible?

I glanced at the countdown.

6:46:24 remaining.

Damn. I could go looking for the cube and risk encountering the monster. Or whatever the fuck was running around in this forest. But I might also find the person that had made the videos.

I glanced back at my room. I still had over six hours remaining. Six hours should be enough.

That's why I've decided to document everything, to let you know in case I don't return.

I'm going to venture out now, in search of the cube and the other person. Perhaps they hold some answers. If you don't hear from me again, it means I've failed. I'll give it my all. It took me more than forty minutes to type this, so I hope it was worth it. Please, don't search for the channel, don’t search for the video. Just don't. I'm heading out now.

6:02:12 remaining.

I truly hope I'll be back to update you. Thank you for your support…
