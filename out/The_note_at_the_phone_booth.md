[The unusual things at the hotel](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/hLLd40YtMF)

I drove as quickly as I could to the phone booth, after 15 minutes of driving I drove past a hitchhiker. 5 minutes passed and I drove past the same hitchhiker again. In 10 minutes I passed by the same hitchhiker 2 times.

After another 5 minutes passed I saw the phone booth and the hitchhiker near the phone booth. I kept on driving and when I saw the same hitchhiker again i turned my truck around and drove to the phone booth.

This time when I arrived there was no hitchhiker near the phone booth.

I quickly got out of my car and entered the phone booth, on the telephone there was a note. I grabbed the note and started reading 

"Have you seen the hitchhiker? If you saw him near the phone booth and kept on driving until you saw him again much further from the phone booth you did good. You are safe. 

You need to do this task, in Carson city there is a brown house surrounded by white Houses,you need to buy a shotgun and 12 bullets and place the weapon and ammunition on the door rug. 

Do the task as quickly as you can. Another note will be waiting for you in the phone booth when you complete the task" 

I quickly got into my truck and started driving to Carson city.

When I arrived to Carson city I went into a weapon store and bought a shotgun and 12 bullets. I then travelled in the Carson city until I found the brown house surrounded by white Houses. I placed the shotgun and ammunition on the door rug and I calmly walked to my car and started driving to the phone booth.

I spent 4 days on the road before I got near the  phone booth, I mostly spent my time being around various gas stations and stores, and  when i started driving towards the phone booth and when i was close to the phone booth, i saw The hitchhiker was near the booth again, so I drove past the booth and when 5 minutes passed and I saw the hitchhiker, I turned my truck around and drove to the phone booth.

I parked my truck near the phone booth and when I entered I saw another note on the telephone,I took the note and started reading.

"Go to the destroyed building infront of the hotel which you stayed at and buy a pistol and 2 magazines. Then place the pistol and the ammunition on  the counter and go to your house"

I took the note and placed the note in my backpack, then when I entered my truck I started go drive towards the hotel. 

When I arrived infront of the hotel I parked my truck and entered the old building.

I found the man who sold guns and he didn't say anything, I bought a pistol and 2 magazines filled with bullets. I paid for the pistol and ammunition with 40 dollars. 


I then walked into the hotel and placed the pistol and ammunition on the counter,I then went inside my truck and drove to my home.

I arrived near my home and when I walked over I saw from the outside that many windows were broken, when I entered my house I saw many things were broken,I turned the radio station 101 on and I heard static again, then I heard coordinates. 

Then I turned off the radio and entered my truck and drove towards the coordinates,  when I was exactly at the coordinates I dug and found a box,I opened the box and saw a note,4,000 dollars and 1 grenade. 

I started reading the note.

"Use the 4,000 dollars to buy the necessary things so that you may barricade your house, Bury the box. Tonight a group of monsters will assault your home, the grenade will help you" 

I buried the books and as quickly as I could bought various nails,wood,and some other things necessary for barricades.

I spent most of the day setting up the barricaded on all of my windows and doors.

At night I heard many sounds of howling and when I looked out of my front window I saw about 60 monsters outside. 


I was scared,sweat poured down on me, I was shaking. But I had my pistol ready and i started shooting at the monsters. I managed to kill several before one got infront of my front door and started breaking the barricade down. I threw my grenade outside and I ran away to the opposite wall in my hallway,I heard the explosion and screams. When the monster tore about half of the barricade I heard gunshots and I saw the monster fall on the barricade.
