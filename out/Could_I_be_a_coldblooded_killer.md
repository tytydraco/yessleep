I recently found out that my father and two best friends were the living embodiment of my psychological fears - fear of Failure, Criticism, and Love. I recognize these individuals in the past tense because, as I’ve grown as a man and overcome those psychological fears in my mind, the personification of my fears (my father and two best friends) have died gruesome deaths in my physical world. They’ve been extinguished from my life forever. 

And to be completely honest with you, I wouldn’t blame anyone for believing that I’m the killer. Not only were the victims’ bodies found in places that I’m associated with, but I was also the one who found them. Suspicious? I agree. It means nothing, though, because I am not a killer! 

Now I have this creepy homicide detective on my heels, pretending that he cares. Pretending that he really wants to find who committed those heinous acts. I mean, he seems genuine on one hand but, my gut is warning me that there’s something off with him. 

Anyway, this bum must think he’s Mike Lowry from the Bad Boys movies or something because he’s a real flashy dresser. Really arrogant. He also drives the car of my dreams, a Mercedes S580…. or at least I think he does. Can’t see who the inhabitant is with its dark tint. That mystery vehicle has been ‘on my 6’ for the last week. In fact, as I’ve arrived before each of the three crime scenes, this mystery vehicle has been just creeping away. Crazy stuff, man! 

What makes this detective even more suspicious is that he’s been secretly dating a female friend of mine. A friend that’s genuinely kind, smart, funny, and beautiful. A friend that I’ve shared my life story with. A friend that I’m secretly in love with. I think he’s been manipulating her, keeping her away from me, in the shadows and away from the truth. 

He’s up to no good y’all! I can just feel it in my bones! But he’s also the only one who can help prove my innocence! Prove that I’m not responsible for killing my father and two best friends.  

I had a chance to sit and talk with the detective at police headquarters. He wanted to share video footage of one of the crime scenes. Fine by me. I welcomed the opportunity, in fact. This was the moment that I would be exonerated. The moment would prove that I saw what I said I saw. This would prove that the mystery vehicle was at each crime scene before I arrived. 

The detective presses ‘Play’. The video shows me approaching the store front at my art store and my surroundings, but it does not show the mystery vehicle. How could this be? I mean, I was right there. That freakin’ car was right there. Less than 20 yards away from me. I could see it, hear it, I swear I could. So, why am I showing on the surveillance footage, but that mystery vehicle is not? 

I know what I saw, right? I know I’m not responsible for killing my father and two best friends. Right? I mean, I had nothing but genuine, unconditional loyalty and respect for them. I would never do them any harm, under any circumstances. 

Then why is it that, I, in fact, killed my father and two best friends?

Please help me to make it make sense…..
