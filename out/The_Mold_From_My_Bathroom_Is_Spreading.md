It started about a month ago. Google told me it was normal. That all I had to do was wash it away with some bleach and that would be that. Either it was lying to me, or I'm doing it wrong.

Back then, it started off as something that I'm assuming at least some of you may be familiar with. One morning, I found a single black speck on my shower curtain. I wasn't sure what it was at first- a bit of dust or grime maybe. I rubbed at it with my thumb, hoping to wipe it away. No such luck, I'm afraid. 

I did happen to be late for work that morning, and so I figured it would need to wait. And wait it did. In fact, scatterbrained as I am, I forgot about entirely as I went through my day. I got home from the gym after dark, made dinner, and once again got in the shower.

Black colonies speckled my shower curtain to the point where the original cloth was almost not visible. Disgusted and over it, I decided to Hell with it and threw the entire thing away. I have a plastic lining on the inside and I live alone, so I didn't think it mattered. I looked it up online and came across a wikipedia page for black mold. Apparently it’s fairly common. It’s a type of mold that lives in damp environments which makes a shower curtain perfect for it. It didn’t seem to be particularly dangerous, other than potentially causing allergies. I let it slip out of my thoughts, confident that I had solved my mold problem. 

And that was the end of. All was well again. For about 2 days. It was the weekend by then, and my plan was to stay in bed until noon and eat junk food. But you know that grimy, greasy feeling you get when you just woke up? I hate that feeling. So I wanted to clean myself first. I opened the door to my bathroom and immediately turned away, covering my nose. The walls, floors, and ceiling were covered in black spots. It looked like the entire room was rotten. Utterly decrepit and disgusting. Not to mention the smell. It was a strange sickly sweet smell that overwhelmed my nostrils. 

This was a problem that I couldn’t solve alone. Annoyed that my weekend was being wasted, I called a professional mold remediation service. The man on the other end sounded bored and annoyed with me. Nevertheless, There was a van outside my house by 2pm, ready to cleanse my bathroom of this blight.

I sat in the living room doing my best to ignore the man. I was reading my book with my dog, a jack russell named Max, comfortably in my lap, when I noticed it. The corners of the pages of my book had begun to turn a darker shade. I flipped through the pages back to the cover and found that the earlier pages were almost completely covered. I dropped the book to the floor.

That's when I found the source of the mold that had consumed my book. My thumb. I had tried to scrub it off with my thumb. And now the tip and nail of my left hand thumb were covered in colonies of black mold. I ran to the sink to wash it off. I used soap at first, but that did nothing. Desperate, I poured bleach on my thumb. It stung a bit but it seemed to work well enough. Soon, my thumb was well again. 

At that moment, the man came out of the bathroom and declared the job was done. My bathroom was clean. It had taken him all day, it was nearly 9 by now. I paid him and he left. Relieved that my germaphobic nightmare was over, I took a long shower and went to sleep.

I woke the next morning to a tingling sensation. I’ve fallen asleep on top of my arms before and woken up to dead limbs. It felt just like that- the same static-y, prickly sensation. But when I opened my eyes I nearly screamed. The mold was not only back, but it had now engulfed the entirety of my arm. The veins on my arm were purple and black, and my skin was cracked and peeling. Despite the horror I felt at this, it didn’t hold a candle to the terror of the sight at the foot of my bed. 

Max stood facing the window, mouth hanging open and with glossy, unblinking eyes. He stood on a pile of his own hair, which apparently had fallen out over night. Like my arm, his veins were visible on his skin, dark purple and black like ink. His skin was worse than that of my arm. I could see strips of muscle and sinew, as if something had been ripping off parts of his skin. But I almost didn’t notice any of these things. Because all of them were overshadowed by Max’s second head. Another face, just like Max’s, but made up entirely of compiled colonies of black mold. It drooled and frothed, making sounds that I can only describe as something attempting to imitate my dog. 

I shifted, trying to leave bed without him noticing, and the mold head snapped its black eyes to me. With a strange delay, the rest of Max followed suit, now staring me down. Normally, I’d try to calm him. To avoid any type of confrontation with him. He was the only companionship I’d had for a long time, after all. But, looking into those 4 eyes, I knew Max was gone. The tiny hellhound jumped for my throat, but I was quicker. I dashed out of the bedroom and locked him in behind me. The door rattled as Max threw himself at it repeatedly. 

I took my phone from my pocket to call for help. But the police station was completely silent. How could no one answer my call? This was an emergency! I got my answer when a news article popped up as a notification. The police were busy.

I could see it on my screen. A van was crashed into the entrance of the local supermarket. Even in the low quality of the footage, I could see dark spots inside and outside of the van. Terrified customers fled into the parking lot from an unseen attacker. The police had formed a sort of barricade with their cruisers, and all of them were pointing their firearms at something inside the store. 

I recognized it vaguely. Or, him, rather. It was the man from yesterday, the one who had cleaned my bathroom. His once pale skin had turned a mottled, inky black, like burnt paper curling at the edges. His veins bulged, thick and pulsating, a network of dark tendrils twisting beneath his flesh. His work uniform hung in tatters, barely clinging to his body, soaked in a strange, dark fluid that oozed from open cracks in his skin. The skin of his head cracked open and bloomed like some sort of nightmarish flower. His jaw was broken at the side, hanging loosely like a hinge. The police opened fire on him, and he went down, releasing clouds of thick mist into the air.

I looked down at my arm. It looked a lot like his. I know what's coming. And I won't let it. I’ve taken every flammable thing I have and spread it throughout my house. Hopefully, it dies with me. But when I think back to that cloud of mist from the service man, I doubt it. Clean your bathrooms, everyone. It feels like a strange final message, but it’s all I can say now. And if it so happens that those people from the grocery store got latched onto by the mold like I have, then I can only pray for you.
