I'm not crazy.
It might appear that way, but really.
I AM NOT crazy.

You know that feeling when you look back at an event and have to curb a tremble.

That no matter what you do, you can feel the memory evade you before you can grip onto it.
The harder you try, the quicker it appeared to be gone, fleeing from you.

Leaving only a trace.
That time proceeding after made the memory feel further away, or like a dream.

What about when no one around you can recall it?
Yet you know they were there, they had to be.
What do you do then?


I am experiencing great difficulty in that regard.

No individual can relate, when I have tried to explain the overwhelming doom I felt; doom I could not even fully comprehend, let alone explain, no matter how much I wanted, nay, needed to.

I endured concerned muttering andÂ  uncomfortable inching away.
The quick unnatural turning away when I look in their direction.
The pity in their voice, or the pained look that flickered onto their face when forced to interact with me.
Treating me like a young child, to be placated until I forgot what had agitated me.

They don't think I notice but, I do.
I notice every time
I'm not crazy.

I tried to tell them, tried to tell anybody. 

The people around me don't even appear to care.
I could yell until I had no voice left and all I'd be greeted with would be a murmur, and being turned away from.

No one will heed my warning.
We are facing a dilemma. 

A dilemma of an unknown origin. 

I'm not crazy.


It will gradually happen to you too, you won't even notice it.
Only looking back will you notice it.

If you remember. 

I hope you remember. 

I tried to note everything down in my journal, what I knew to be vital information; the emotion I felt.
The growing horror that knowing no matter what I did the outcome would not change.


I finally managed to grip onto a piece of the puzzle.

I know half the problem.

I don't know how to fix it.

You ever have a letter you couldn't find? I don't mean ink on paper, but a letter from the alphabet?

Not in written media, not in vocal day to day.
A letter you could vaguely remember but only the idea of it? 


Help

Are there more we have all forgotten?
Would that explain why we flounder for a word, we can feel we knew it before but it now we're only left with the feeling of what the word meant?
A word that can no longer be?


Maybe I come from another place and I'm gradually, unwillingly conforming to the normal here.
But if I'm not, if indeed I have caught a bug of an unknown origin, maybe you have too.

I'm not crazy.
I can't be, I know you feel it too, that prickle of uncertainty.
