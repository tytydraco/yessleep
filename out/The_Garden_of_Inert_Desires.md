Title: The Garden of Inert Desires

Author: Simulacrum (my pseudonym)

PS: I'm sorry for my bad english. The story below.

It's been a year since I witnessed the horror and, since then, fortunately I've continued to see everyday things, without supernatural events generating a madness that I never want to experience again. Last year, I moved to Kingston Upon Thames, one of the districts of Greater London, to live in the house that belonged to Charlotte Wilkins, an elderly sick woman. She was apparently very nice and loved to talk. She rejected the formality when I initially called her “Mrs. Wilkins”, and asked me to just call her Charlotte. On my first day living in the house, Charlotte and I talked for about 15 minutes. She told me that she had come to terms with her imminent death and that she would like to live out the short time she had left in her best friend's house.

Charlotte didn't have any children, so it wasn't a difficult decision to sell the house that had just been renovated, and as I was looking for a place to live, I didn't hesitate when I saw the “for sale” sign on the property and immediately acted to buy it. As she has no descendants and doesn't have close contact with her family, Charlotte wanted to leave some of her personal belongings with me, and told me she would be very grateful if I would take them. Considering that Charlotte was in very poor health and was getting closer and closer to death, I had a certain compassion and didn't refuse her request. So I got some paintings and other objects that were on the front of the house. Charlotte told me that she liked to travel and that Scotland was her favorite destination.

— It was in Scotland that I found a relatively rare and very special book — she said —, but I don't remember where I put it. If you find it, you don't have to come to me to give it to me, you know I won't live long, so keep it.

I just nodded. Outside, a woman was waiting in a car: she was, according to Charlotte, her best friend. The elderly woman thanked me for agreeing to take her personal belongings, got into the car where her friend was waiting in the driver's seat, and the two drove off. During our conversation, Charlotte sometimes let slip, in a subtle way, that she didn't like her family, so I got the impression that she had sold the house not because she wanted to live out her last days with her friend, but because she would

rather the house remained with a stranger than belong to relatives when the time came for her to pass away. I suspected that this was the main reason why the house was sold to me for so much less than it was actually worth. She was in a hurry to sell the house before death came for her and allowed relatives to enjoy her estate. I remember it was Saturday when I woke up in my new home, had coffee and then took the opportunity to do some cleaning and found a pair of pink shoes under the bed. I looked closely at the two objects, which, being so simple and delicate, led me to the conclusion that they weren't exactly ordinary shoes: they were ballerina shoes. I deduced that the shoes might be Charlotte's, and that they were part of the objects she had given me, but as I had no interest in them, I put them away in a corner of one of the cupboards in the house. As for the house, it's a simple but beautiful place: it has a hedge, a gable roof that makes up the attic and rustic walls with a slightly yellowish white color reminiscent of a sunny day.

I was also enchanted by the garden on the front. It wasn't a large garden, but there was plenty of space for me to spend time. The flowers in the garden varied in color, fragrance, size, texture and shape. The garden also had an elongated oak bench. What I'm about to say may seem exaggerated, but such was my fascination with the garden that I acquired a kind of addiction to it: the flowers and the birds that landed there intoxicated me. Some of the works of art scattered around the garden expressed a touching beauty, others caused discomfort: there were several small gray statues 40 centimeters high. The statues depicted everything from a mother holding a baby to a woman dressed as a ballerina, and behind this woman was another statue: that of a hideous figure that looked more like a cosmic entity.

The neighbors greeted me, welcomed me and didn't mind the hideous statues in the garden, which seemed invisible to them. During the first six days in the house, I spent time in the garden, on the oak bench, drinking tea, reading a book, or just observing everything in it, but on the seventh day things happened that I'll never forget. On the same Saturday that I found the ballerina shoes, exactly a week after moving into the property, Charlotte came to visit me almost in the evening. She had said that she was feeling her life slipping away sooner than she had imagined, and that she would like to contemplate the garden she loved so much alone for the last time. I was moved by her request and left her there, alone, just as she wanted. About five minutes passed and she went back into the house. To give her a little comfort, I told her that I would

take good care of the garden. She smiled, thanked me and drove off with her friend who, once again, hadn't got out of the car. A few minutes later, I was alone in the garden.

What was supposed to be a moment of ecstasy became a mishmash of bad and sad feelings strangely followed by uplifting ones. My body and mind felt as light as a feather, and slowly my body began to move away from the grass. I realized that I was levitating, and looking down, I saw that my feet were about 30 centimetres above the grass. The flora and birds that landed there began to liquefy and blend together like a watercolor of various colors, and I was confused by this madness because I had a mixed feeling of agony and delight. In the middle of this mix, a child appeared in the watercolor garden, running and smiling with radiant happiness. To my surprise, that child was me... I mean, in that beautifully hideous garden I saw myself as a child, showing a naive, childlike happiness. All this psychedelic madness was frightening and beautiful.

Gradually, the situation normalized, the watercolor crumbled, and what had previously liquefied became solid again, and as if coming out of a trance, I felt more awake and the garden became what it was again. When the terrifying psychedelia ended, I realized that I was exactly in the center of the garden, and my body was facing the house. Little by little, the house was surrounded by a dense white mist, but a little yellowish, like the color of the walls. A sweet, feminine voice from inside the house told me not to be afraid. Whoever was inside, observing the fairytale madness I was going through, concluded the obvious: I was afraid. And although I still couldn't see clearly because of the fog, I saw that there was a woman at the living room window, whose door led out onto the garden. It was still a sunny afternoon, but twilight was gradually approaching, and a black cloud appeared near the roof of the house. The mysterious cloud soon dissipated, revealing what looked like a piece of outer space in a large dark circle that I later guessed was a portal. A strong wind hit the living room door, blowing it open.

I thought the situation couldn't get any weirder, as I thought the madness of the place had reached its peak, but I was wrong. The sneakers I'd kept in a cupboard came

moving out, side by side. Soon the shoes arrived in the garden and positioned themselves so that only their tips touched the ground, they moved harmoniously in all directions, and I understood that these simple objects were performing a dance. The impression I got was that an invisible body was dancing ballet and that only the sneakers could be seen moving in that dance, again causing me a mixed feeling, this time of unease and admiration. Yes, I was admiring that moment, even though the darkness of fear arose in my core, because that's what the unknown causes: a disquieting fear, because I didn't know who was wearing the sneakers.

I had my back to the fence and tried to turn around to run and escape, but some invisible force made my body immobile - I could only speak and move my eyes. A crystal-clear horror flashed before my eyes as the sneakers stopped performing dance moves and started taking steps, walking normally, and they came towards me. The sneakers came closer and touched my bare feet. I felt like I was being hugged and heard the sweet, feminine voice again:

— It's me, Albert, it's me... You knew me, but my voice was different, it was weaker, because I didn't have the strength to go on living.

Astonished, I said:

— I don't know who you are. In fact, there's no way of knowing who you are because I can't see you, you're invisible to me. And how do you know my name?

— I'm Charlotte, Albert.

— Charlotte? The woman who sold me the house? - I asked suspiciously. - Well, your voice is different from Charlotte's, your voice is youthful and with a certain vigor, and not a senile and debilitated voice like hers.

The woman moved away at a distance of about two meters from me and suddenly became visible, and I could finally see her: she was a young woman who appeared to be about 25 years old, with black hair, blue eyes and a slender body. She was wearing a set of items that are part of a ballerina's wardrobe: a hairnet, tights, a skirt with a waistband, stockings and, of course, her sneakers. She said:

— When I was young, I had the desire to be a ballerina. In fact, I almost succeeded in fulfilling my wish, but life takes different turns from what people plan.

— I'm sorry, Charlotte, but why are you telling me this?

— For a long time, I've been spreading my anger in this garden, brooding over having my wish destroyed when I gave up ballet because of an accident, anger also caused by other unfulfilled wishes. This is the garden of inert desires, you see.

At that moment, I assumed that there might be an explanation for the child self appearing in the garden. I had several wishes as a child, but of those wishes, there was a special one, which unfortunately I couldn't fulfill.

— That smiling child you saw running around this garden was your wish — Charlotte explained. — As a child, you wanted to have a happy childhood, to be a happy child, but that wasn't possible because of your narcissistic mother.

She was right. I didn't know how Charlotte found out that I had a difficult childhood and, in truth, it didn't matter how this grim fragment of my life had come to her attention. I could understand, however, that the garden seemed to concentrate some of my unfulfilled desires, because while Charlotte... I mean, while the young version of Charlotte was talking, images of my desires that, for various reasons, never came to fruition were appearing all around me, like projects that I had envisioned and never got off the ground.

— A strong unfulfilled desire doesn't die, it becomes a dying psychic energy full of anger and anguish — explained Charlotte. — I'm dying, Albert, you know... You saw me weak when you bought the house. I, young Charlotte, am the version who had wishes for the future, but when you bought the house, you met the Charlotte who abandoned her own wishes and dumped them in this garden.

\- I'm really sorry, Charlotte, I hope you find peace when...

\- When I die? — she interrupted me.

— When I leave — I replied.

For a moment, there was silence between us. We looked at each other like two miserable people who shared the same misfortune: our destinies built on the frustration of desires that didn't develop, that only inhabited the mind.

— Why do some statues depict such beautiful things and others cause disquiet and chills? - I asked.

— These little statues, Albert, are my most intense desires, which, as you already know, have not come true. Wishes that cause restlessness and chills are also part of peaceful people, but there's a difference between just wishing for something bad and putting it into practice. In this garden, unfulfilled wishes become figurines that will soon adorn the house of the Goddess. I don't know if you've noticed, but since you moved here, a statuette of a smiling little boy has appeared in that corner — she said, pointing his finger to where the statuette he described was. — Remember when I told you that this is the garden of inert desires?

— Of course, now it makes sense, inert desires like statues.

— Exactly.

— Looking at the statues, I assume that you have a mind that's split into two sides: a beautiful side, and a dark side, very dark.

— That statuette of a mother holding a baby... - she sighed, looking sad. - I would have liked to have had children, but I'm sterile.

— Again, I'm sorry — I sympathized. — But among all the gloomy statues, I'd like you to explain that one... That monstrous figure behind the ballerina.

Charlotte looked at the abomination, smiled mischievously, and gave me an answer that would reverberate for the rest of my existence, for I would never forget that statuette and the dark meaning that Charlotte was about to reveal to me.

— She is the Goddess. She is Anguish. She is the Mother of Desires, those desires that cannot fight back. The inert desires like statuettes are still furious because they haven't accessed reality, and the Goddess is the one who brings the wind of encouragement, that same wind you feel when you levitate, and she also brings that wind to the desires that, by inertia, can be nothing more than desires unfulfilled by their wishers.

— And what will happen now? — I asked, apprehensive and afraid of what she would say.

— I'm going to die soon, Albert, and in order to leave in peace, I need the Goddess to do something for me. My pleas have already been made, the words have already been spoken.

The door to the room opened, and out of the room came an old and man with a furrowed brow whom I had never seen before. He came into the garden, confused and wondering how he had ended up there. He was startled to see the black portal and tried to run away from the house, but the same invisible force that had left me immobile also acted on him. Unable to move, he shouted for help, hoping that the neighbors would hear him, but no one did: everything that was happening around the house and garden was imperceptible from the outside. I could hear the noise of cars and people walking and talking near the house, but they went about their business as usual. In a flash, the man's voice disappeared, he was struck by a sudden dumbness. I asked Charlotte who he was. The young woman, with a wicked smile on her lips once again, told me that the man had prevented her from fulfilling a great desire. With an expression of distress in his eyes, the old man listened to Charlotte like someone carrying the guilt of a reckless past.

— See that gentleman over there, Albert? A drunk who ran me over, driving completely drunk, crushing my left leg and preventing me from becoming a dancer, rendering inert such a deep desire that I possessed. As you always saw me in a long dress, you didn't see my prosthesis and you didn't realize that I have an amputated leg. But the Goddess will help me leave in peace. She is ready to grace us with her presence.

The hideous figure that Charlotte called the Goddess came flying out of the portal and landed in the garden. It was a creature about three and a half meters tall, with large butterfly wings, but armored, and these wings were black with metallic blue edges. Its body was elongated and, in a way, looked like a slug - more precisely, it was a pink, gelatinous mass that was quite flexible, wet and disgusting looking. Its huge mouth stretched vertically from just below its eyes to the beginning of its posterior extension, which appeared like a tail. On either side of the mouth were two long appendages, which looked more like thin pink tentacles that moved in a snakelike fashion - the tips of the appendages were rounded and flattened. Its sharp teeth lined up horizontally, and its equally pink tongue oozed a thick, yellowish goo. At the top, there were two short curved filaments above its two slightly protruding globular eyes. The eyes were filled with red and in each of them there was a large black dot in the center

that moved according to the direction in which the creature looked. At the bottom of the monster was a tail with five segments. From the fifth segment, the tail tapered until it split into two filaments, and at the tip of each filament was a black claw slightly less curved than a hawk's claws.

The old man who had run over Charlotte was attacked by the two claws, which pierced both sides of his chest, in the rib area. The two filaments lifted the old man by means of the claws embedded in his ribs and carried him into the mouth of the Goddess. He was chewed up and I realized that his broken body had simply disappeared from the creature's mouth, leaving only traces of the man's blood in it. At that moment, I didn't know what to do when I saw that scene which, I'll tell you in the strongest terms, was the most terrifying thing I'd ever seen. Charlotte spoke again and I tried to ignore her, but I couldn't.

— I could have called the Goddess first, Albert, but I waited for you to buy the house and unconsciously pour your desires into the garden so that I could understand the Goddess' beautiful justice. I touched the statuette of the happy little boy, and I saw how your mother made you suffer. Wait for the right moment, and when you've spent enough time in the garden, say the right words. You'll finally be able to give your mother the end she deserves, she has to be torn apart. Just look behind one of the pictures I gave you. Eight months ago, I bought the house, but the disease came on aggressively, and I had to rush to sell the house, wait for you to settle in and then give you true justice. Between eight and nine months of attending the garden, that's enough for the Goddess to attend to you, and then you'll finally be able to invoke her. You only have a few figurines, you need more, and your wishes must be sincere.

I was getting weak and tired. Once again, my body became light, but the wind carried me towards the Goddess, and she, leaning down her gelatinous body, stared at me with her fearful eyes. Leaning closer and closer, the Goddess approached me, and I, levitating but still motionless, shifted my gaze to her open mouth and caught a glimpse of what seemed to be a portal inside that mouth. Through the portal I saw a mountainous region where there was a place with a large number of bones made up of shattered bones and also a broken body that was so unrecognizable that I could only conjecture that it was the old man who had been chewed up. At that point, there was nothing I could do but wait to see what the creature would do to me. To my relief, it suddenly moved away. The figurines began to rise from the grass and move through the air towards the circular, starry portal, where they entered to be taken to the abode of the butterfly-winged demon.

— The powerful Goddess is finally getting her due. The statuettes will adorn her ineffable home — explained Charlotte, with an expression of admiration for the monstrosity.

I was surprised by something rather symbolic and dark going into the circular portal through which the Goddess had emerged: the statuette of Charlotte, once represented as a young ballerina, now in its elderly version, completely naked, with a monstrous mouth on its belly and large butterfly wings on its back, which led me to assume that the statuettes of old Charlotte and the Goddess had merged. When all the figurines were no longer in the garden, the Goddess flew out and entered the circular, starry portal. The portal closed in a few seconds. Young Charlotte waved her right hand in a gesture of farewell and disappeared into the mist. “Now I can die in peace,” said a voice in my head. It was Charlotte's tired and senile voice. The wind that had been lifting me ceased and I fell to the grass. Dazed and tired, I focused my gaze for a few seconds on the reddish orange sky of the coming twilight. My body felt heavy, so I went straight to the living room and collapsed on the sofa, where I immediately closed my eyes to go to sleep. I woke up around 7:15 the next morning.

I know that if other people had experienced that horror, they would have left the house out of trauma and fear, but I decided to stay out of stubbornness, despite the fear of staying. Later that morning, I thought about removing all the objects Charlotte had given me from the house, and I began by taking a picture of a painting depicting three women, all wearing white dresses, standing in a vast area of vegetation where there was a mansion in the background. Above their heads was a blackened circle filled with stars. Behind the painting, I found a hole in the wall, where there was a book, most likely kept, or rather hidden, by Charlotte. It was a black-covered book with the title “Cosmic Magic”, and I noticed that there was a chapter in it called “The Invocation of the Mother of Desires”.

Out of curiosity, I read the chapter in the book with guidelines for invoking the Goddess, stating that she is asked to chew up and destroy those who have prevented the fulfillment of other people's wishes. The book explained that it is very different to fulfill one's desires in the right and just way and to fulfill them by deliberately harming

people. Those who intentionally or recklessly ruin wishes that can be fulfilled in the most peaceful way possible are targets for the Goddess — although each wish has a context for the Goddess to evaluate. Also according to the book, in 1591, three young witches from North Berwick, a town in Scotland, possessed manuscripts that not only revealed the existence of entities unknown to most of those involved in magic, but also instructions on how to invoke them. The manuscripts belonged to an Irish magician who lived in the far north of Ireland.

The three women sowed the desire to live peacefully, did not want to cause harm to others and did not want to be harassed; however, a group of ten men, who were not exactly sent by King James VI of Scotland; but, influenced by the monarch's attitude of having promoted fierce hunts for various witches, tried to capture them to be executed by them. These men slyly discovered that the witches resorted to harmless spells in order to have a successful crop and a bountiful harvest at any time of the year in the region where they lived. Even though these spells did no harm, the men considered them threats.

Confronting the men, the witches, using aggressive spells, managed to kill two of them. They didn't want to hurt or kill any more of the men, and warned them to leave, but they continued to attack them. Realizing that they needed much more than aggressive spells to defeat that hostile group, the women had no choice and, at the same time, with their voices in unison, they began to pronounce words from a strange language of alien origin spoken by a society of Celtic mystics whose members began meeting together from 1600 BC. The witches spoke the words of invocation like music: first in two-by-four time, then they spoke more quickly, in four-by-four time, with all the words being pronounced with their voices reaching a single musical note: B flat. Then the Mother of Desires emerged from the circular portal and chewed up all the men who had assaulted those women.

The book mentioned that the broken bodies of those men were taken to a place in Europe through a portal that appeared inside the creature's own mouth while it was chewing on them. This probably explains why the old man who ran over Charlotte wasn't exactly swallowed by the Goddess: considering the bones and the shattered body that I saw through the portal inside the creature's mouth when it had approached me, I assumed that the chewed-up old man was thrown into a kind of macabre open-air dump where the monster's victims are kept - the book didn't mention very specifically where this place is, it just pointed out that the chewed-up bodies were left in a mountainous region of Ireland because they didn't serve as food for the Goddess, as she didn't need to eat to survive. During that reading, I concluded that, logically, the painting Charlotte had left in the house was based on the three witches.

For the invocation of the Goddess to be successful, the book that had belonged to Charlotte recommended saying the words exactly as the witches did. The words, spoken in two different measures and on a single note, must be pronounced in an overgrown area, and this same place must be where the person who needs the Goddess has lived for at least eight to nine months, imbuing the place with memories and desires — just as Charlotte spent a lot of time in the garden, and just as the witches lived in the countryside. When I reached the lines in the book where the words to invoke the Goddess were, I immediately closed it and, a few hours later, burned it.

As I watched the book being consumed by the fire, I began to think back to when Charlotte had visited me on that dark Saturday, telling me that, to say goodbye to the garden she loved so much, she would like to see it for the last time - again, her friend was waiting for her in the car. I also remembered that, while she was alone in the garden, I was in the living room and could hear her uttering incomprehensible words. Nine months after the supernatural events, a woman, who appeared to be around 30 years old, came to my house and called me. I looked out of the window and recognized her: it was the woman who always stayed in the car, waiting for Charlotte when I talked to the elderly woman. It was early evening and this woman was wearing a black overcoat and had a string around her neck with a pendant, which I assumed was silver, in the shape of a pentagram. I opened the door to the living room and went towards her to ask why she was visiting, but when I got to the center of the garden, the woman, who was standing next to the hedge of my house, was in a hurry and said to me:

— You haven't invoked the Goddess to give your mother a proper end. You're weak, you're a disappointment.

And as soon as she had insulted me, she got into her car, drove off and I never saw her again.
