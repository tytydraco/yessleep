I couldn’t tell you how long I sat there, staring blankly at the screen, my mind twisting itself into knots as I tried to piece together what I’d just witnessed. The image of the woman running through the forest played over and over in my head, her heavy breathing, the sound of branches snapping underfoot. And then there was her voice—fragile, desperate. The one thing I was sure of, the only thing clear in the chaos, was that she had said my name.



Why? Why *me*? I couldn’t answer that. I didn’t know who she was, what had been chasing her, or what horror had driven her to the edge of panic. All I knew was the weight of that whisper, the way it lingered, haunting me like the echo of a memory I couldn’t quite place.



The only thing that pulled me out of my spiraling thoughts was the sound of the front door creaking open. It startled me, made me jump, my heart pounding as if the woman’s terror had seeped into me. I turned quickly, half-expecting—what, I wasn’t sure—but instead, it was my husband, stepping inside with a puzzled look on his face. He froze in the doorway, startled by my reaction, and raised both hands as if to calm me.



“Are you alright?” he asked, his voice soft with concern as he set his keys on the table by the door. His eyes scanned my face, searching for an answer I couldn’t yet give.



After a few seconds, I managed a nod. “Yes, yes… I’m fine.” My voice felt steadier than I expected, but his worried expression lingered. He stepped closer and wrapped me in one of his tight, reassuring hugs, the kind that always seemed to melt away the edges of my anxiety.



“Sorry for scaring you,” I murmured as we pulled apart. I leaned in and kissed his cheek, a gesture of normalcy I desperately needed. “How was work?”



He sighed heavily, loosening his tie before tugging his shirt out of his pants. As he began undoing the buttons, his frustration was written all over his face. “It was alright, I guess. Meetings all day. Felt like a complete waste of time.”



I couldn’t help but smile. There was something endearing about the way he got annoyed at little things like this, his brows furrowed, his tone just slightly exasperated.



“So,” he said, glancing at me as he shrugged off his shirt, “how was your mother’s?”



And just like that, any semblance of normalcy vanished from my face. I could feel it slip away, and judging by the way my husband started laughing, he noticed it too.



“That bad, huh?” he teased, his grin widening.



The truth is, my mom and I have always had a strange relationship. She’s a good mother—better than most, I’d say—but she’s not without her moments. Every so often, she’d have these bursts of anger, sharp and unexpected, aimed at me or my sister. It wasn’t uncommon for us to go months without speaking, both of us too stubborn to make the first move until someone—usually me—gave in and decided to make peace. My husband knew all of this. He always poked fun at the idea, joking that one day I’d end up as bitter and dramatic as she could sometimes be.



“No, it was mostly fine,” I said, brushing off his laughter. “She didn’t do anything bad.”



He raised an eyebrow, that playful look of his daring me to admit the truth.



“Neither did I!” I added quickly, cutting him off before he could suggest otherwise. “She just… wanted to watch some old tapes with me. Most of them were fine, but, uh… there were two that…”



I trailed off, unsure how to explain. My voice faltered, and I could see his curiosity shift into concern.



"Here, let me show you," I said, pulling out a chair and gesturing for him to sit in front of the computer.



He settled down, and I queued up the videos. We watched both clips back to back, the eerie darkness of the forest filling the room again. I studied his face as he watched, his expression shifting only slightly. When the second video ended, he leaned back in the chair, puzzled.



“What’s wrong with them?” he finally asked, turning to look at me. His tone was calm, almost dismissive, as if he couldn’t quite grasp why I was so rattled.



“What’s wrong?” I repeated, my voice rising as a wave of exasperation hit me. How could he not understand? I felt my hands clench involuntarily. “Lucas, the woman was *running for her life*! Something was chasing her. She was terrified, sobbing like she knew she was about to—” I swallowed hard, the words catching in my throat. “—to die.”



And he laughed. He actually laughed.



“Babe,” he said, standing up and placing his hands on my shoulders. His touch was warm, reassuring, but it only made me feel more disconnected. He started rubbing my shoulders gently, as if that could smooth away the tension in my body. “That’s just a movie,” he said. “People used to tape their shows or movies back then if they couldn’t watch them live. Your dad probably recorded something random and used the first cassette he found.”



“But she *said my name* at the end,” I insisted, my voice trembling.



“Clara’s a pretty common name,” he replied, his tone light. “Especially back in those days. It’s probably just a coincidence.”



I stared at him, his words brushing past me like a breeze that failed to reach my core. Coincidence. That word felt so thin, so flimsy against the weight in my chest.



“Come on, babe. It’s fine—it’s just a movie,” Lucas said, leaning down to kiss my forehead. His thumb brushed against my cheek in that tender way of his, the one that always seemed to smooth over my rough edges. He really was a wonderful man, always trying to shield me from my own spiraling thoughts. “Why don’t I order some pizza, and we can watch something together? It’s been a long day for both of us.”



I nodded and hugged him again, letting the warmth of his embrace momentarily ground me. But as I buried my face in his chest, I couldn’t stop the small voice in the back of my mind. *Why can’t you just believe it’s a coincidence?* I hated that voice, hated myself for not being able to let it go as easily as he did.



A few days later, I called my sister.



“Do you want to see the videos from the tapes Mom found?” I asked, keeping my tone casual.



“Tapes?” she echoed, her surprise evident. “She didn’t tell me anything about tapes.”



I could hear the offense in her voice, a familiar tone that surfaced anytime Mom left her out of something. “Of course, she’d tell you first,” she muttered, half to herself. But after a moment, her curiosity won out. “Yeah, sure. Bring them over. Let’s watch them.”



When I arrived at her flat, it was her daughter—the whirlwind of energy that was my niece—who greeted me at the door. She wrapped me in a quick, enthusiastic hug before bouncing back, eyes alight with excitement.



“Aunt Clara, you brought the videos, right? I’ve been dying to see them!”



I hesitated, holding the pendrive tightly in my palm. “We’ll see,” I said, forcing a smile. She was in film school, and I knew her curiosity was partly academic, but the thought of her watching the first and last videos made my stomach twist.



Before I could figure out what to say, my sister appeared at the door. She greeted me with a kiss on the cheek, ushering me inside. “Come on in. I’ve already got the TV set up,” she said, her voice warm but with the clipped efficiency she always carried.



I followed her into the living room, clutching the pendrive like it held a secret too heavy to share.



Deciding to skip the first video felt like the easiest way to avoid any awkward questions. "It’s not that interesting," I told them, brushing it off as unimportant. We dove into the others instead—the normal ones, the ones filled with holidays, birthdays, and snapshots of simpler times.



As the footage played, nostalgia wrapped itself around me like an old blanket. There were the trips to Villa Gesell, the days spent in that modest cabin owned by my dad’s family. Normally, watching my younger self would have been a cringeworthy experience, but today was different. I felt a strange ache in my chest, something bittersweet, as I saw the kid I used to be, glowing with joy, surrounded by the kind of love you only appreciate in hindsight.



Midway through one of the clips, my niece suddenly paused the video.



“Wait,” she said, standing up and walking closer to the screen. She pointed at a man standing on the edge of the frame, barely noticeable unless you were looking for him. He wore a fishing hat and dark sunglasses, his face partially obscured, but his profile—his nose, specifically—was unmistakable. It bent downward, sharp and pronounced, almost like a vulture’s beak.



“He’s in all of the videos,” said my niece, her voice tinged with curiosity. “Always at the side, or far in the background, just out of focus.”



I blinked, her words catching me off guard. My eyes flicked back to the screen, and the realization hit me like a sudden chill. She was right. I had never noticed him before.



“Oh,” I said, offering a weak laugh. “That’s our grandfather.” I smiled at the memory of him, though faint and distant now.



The moment I turned to my sister, the smile faded. She wasn’t looking at the screen. She was looking at me, and her face had gone ashen, her eyes wide and filled with something I couldn’t quite place.



Fear.



“Is something wrong?” I asked, my voice wavering slightly.



My sister blinked, snapping herself out of whatever had gripped her. She cleared her throat but couldn’t hide the tremor in her voice. “Camila, sweetie,” she said, forcing a calmness she didn’t feel, “can you go to your room for a minute?”



Camila’s expression shifted, her usual playful demeanor giving way to quiet obedience. She nodded and slipped away without another word, leaving us alone in the room.



I turned back to my sister, confusion knotting in my stomach. “What’s going on?”



She didn’t answer right away. Instead, she reached out, clutching my hand with both of hers. Her grip was firm, but her fingers trembled slightly. When she spoke, her voice was barely above a whisper.



“That man,” she said, her lip quivering, “isn’t our grandfather.”



“What do you mean?” I asked, my heart beginning to race.



She swallowed hard, her throat working as if she were forcing down something bitter. When she finally spoke, the words hit me like a punch to the gut.



“That’s the man who kidnapped you when we were kids.”
