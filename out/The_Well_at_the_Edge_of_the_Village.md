I’m writing this because I don’t know how much time I have left. My name’s Arjun, and I live in a small village in Rajasthan, India, about an hour’s drive from Jodhpur. It’s the kind of place where everyone knows everyone, where the desert stretches endlessly beyond our mud houses, and where old stories about spirits and curses are told over chai. I never believed those stories. Not until last week. Now, I wish I’d listened.

Our village is old, older than anyone can remember. There’s a well at the edge of it, half-crumbled, surrounded by thorny shrubs and cracked earth. No one uses it anymore—hasn’t for generations. The elders say it’s cursed, that something lives down there, something that listens. They call it the *Kali Maa ka Kuan*—the Well of the Dark Mother. As kids, we’d dare each other to throw stones into it, but no one ever got too close. Even the goats avoided it. I always thought it was just superstition, a way to keep us from falling in.

Last week, my cousin Vikram came to stay with us. He’s from the city, all swagger and skepticism, always laughing at our “village nonsense.” One night, after dinner, we were sitting outside under the stars, the air thick with the scent of dust and jasmine. Vikram was bored, scrolling on his phone, when he started asking about the well. My mother, who was washing dishes nearby, overheard and snapped at him to drop it. “Don’t talk about that place,” she said, her voice sharp. “It hears you.”

Vikram laughed it off, but I could tell it got under his skin. Later, when my parents were asleep, he nudged me and said, “Come on, Arjun. Let’s go check out this haunted well of yours. Prove it’s just a hole in the ground.” I told him it was a bad idea, but he kept pushing, calling me a coward. I was 19, he was 22—I didn’t want to look like a kid in front of him. So, against every instinct screaming at me to stay put, I agreed.

We grabbed a torch and crept out, the village silent except for the distant howl of a jackal. The moon was full, casting long shadows that made the desert look alive, like it was watching us. The well wasn’t far, maybe a ten-minute walk, but it felt like hours. The closer we got, the heavier the air felt, like it was pressing down on my chest. The usual night sounds—crickets, wind—faded, leaving only our footsteps crunching on the sand.

When we reached the well, it looked exactly as I remembered: a low, crumbling wall of sandstone, overgrown with thorns, the black mouth of it yawning in the center. Vikram shone the torch down, but the beam didn’t reach the bottom—just endless dark. “See? Nothing,” he said, but his voice was quieter than usual. He picked up a stone and tossed it in. We waited for the splash, the clatter of rock on rock. Nothing. Just silence, like the well had swallowed the sound.

Then we heard it—a low, rhythmic thumping, like a heartbeat, coming from deep inside. Vikram froze, the torch shaking in his hand. “What the hell is that?” he whispered. I didn’t know, but my skin was crawling. I grabbed his arm to pull him back, but before I could, the thumping stopped, and a voice whispered from the well. Not loud, but clear, like it was right in my ear. “Arjun,” it said. My name. Soft, almost sweet, but wrong, like it was tasting the word.

Vikram heard it too—his own name, he told me later. His eyes went wide, and he dropped the torch. It hit the ground and flickered out, plunging us into darkness. The moonlight was enough to see by, but it made everything worse—the shadows seemed to twist, like something was climbing up the well’s walls. I grabbed Vikram and ran, our feet pounding the sand, not stopping until we were back at the house, panting and shaking.

We didn’t talk about it that night. Vikram tried to laugh it off the next morning, saying we’d spooked ourselves, but he looked pale, and his hands kept twitching. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something had followed us back. That day, strange things started happening. The water in our clay pots tasted bitter, like ash. My mother’s bangles, which she kept in a tin by her bed, were arranged in a perfect circle on the floor. And at night, I heard it again—that thumping, like a heartbeat, coming from under the house.

The next night, Vikram woke me up, his face slick with sweat. “It’s calling me,” he whispered. “The well. It’s saying my name.” I told him he was dreaming, but then I heard it too—my name, his name, whispered over and over, not from the well but from everywhere, like the air itself was speaking. We locked the door and stayed up, clutching knives we’d grabbed from the kitchen, but it didn’t stop. The whispering grew louder, angrier, until it felt like it was inside my skull.

The next morning, Vikram was gone. His bag was still there, his phone on the bed, but he was nowhere in the house. I knew where he’d gone. I don’t know why I went after him—maybe I thought I could save him—but I ran to the well. The air was thick, like breathing through a wet cloth, and the closer I got, the louder the thumping grew. When I reached the well, I saw him. Vikram was standing at the edge, staring down, his body swaying like he was in a trance.

“Vikram!” I shouted, but he didn’t turn. I grabbed his shoulder, and he spun around, his eyes empty, like black holes. His mouth opened, and that voice—the one from the well—came out, low and guttural. “You heard me,” it said. “You belong to me.” I stumbled back, and he lunged, his hands clawing at me. I don’t know how I got away, but I ran, my lungs burning, until I collapsed in the village square.

The elders found me, and when I told them what happened, they didn’t look surprised. They said the well takes someone every few years, that it’s been that way since the village was built. They burned offerings—sandalwood and ghee—at the well’s edge and told me not to go near it again. They said Vikram was gone, that the *Kali Maa* had claimed him. I wanted to argue, to demand they search for him, but deep down, I knew they were right.

I haven’t seen Vikram since. His phone doesn’t work, and his parents think he ran off to the city. But I know he’s in that well—or whatever’s down there. Last night, I heard the thumping again, louder, closer, coming from the walls of my room. And just now, as I’m typing this on my phone, hiding in a neighbor’s house, I heard my name, whispered soft and sweet, from the shadows in the corner.

I don’t know what’s in that well, but it knows me. It knows my name, and it’s calling. If you’re ever in a village in Rajasthan and see an old well at the edge of town, don’t go near it. Don’t listen. Because once it hears you, it won’t let you go.
I'll probably try to pass tonight safely if I can. I'll inform you if something happens.
