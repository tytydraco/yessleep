*Part 2 - Current*

I stared at my computer screen, going over photos of the Minnesota Void. Looking at the impossible phenomenon was enough to elicit powerful emotions of déjà vu, but alongside it, I realized that I couldn’t picture the sight in my head once I had taken my eyes off the hole, as if my brain refused to save it. I knew it existed, I knew that it had killed everyone living within the town but asking me to describe it after the fact would be a near futile task.

But the little town in Minnesota had only been the first of many things that would be erased off the face of the Earth. As the month of March came around, the island of Svalbard was swallowed by a similar void, vanishing within the blink of an eye, taking with it its almost three thousand inhabitants. Unlike the town in Minnesota, there were no close-up pictures of the void to be found online, because the area had been sealed off by the military in a joint operation between Norway, Iceland, England, and America. Satellite photos were published but showed little more than open ocean and ships circling the area.

It was around that time that the accusations emerged of a hereby unknown superweapon first appeared in the media. Though there were no prime subjects, several countries had begun to accuse each other of experimenting with weapons of mass destruction. But with no single country standing unscathed by the void events, it was hard to choose a viable culprit. To any outside observer, there seemed to be no logic behind the order of vanishing objects around the world. By all appearances, the events seemed random

An attempt at making a system to categorize the events was made. A scale to measure the severity of void events was suggested by the United Nations, named by its initial creator: Desmond Holloway. It could be briefly explained as follows:

*Category 5 – Erasure on a scale limited to singular objects such as furniture, personal effects, documents, digital media.*

*Category 4 – Erasure of compound objects including businesses, homes, vehicles, constructions.*

*Category 3 – Erasure of multiple compound objects and its subjects, including living beings. Limited to the area of a town, nature reservation.*

*Category 2 – Large scale erasure with mass casualties, including erase of cities, country regions, national parks.*

*Category 1 – Extreme erase with catastrophic casualties and the disappearance of entire countries or continents.*

Putting a grade of severity to the events did little to calm people, but it made it easier to follow the news as more and more of the world fell to the void.

My mind, however, still lingered on the disappearance of Olivia. For each day that my phone still had the ability to connect to the remaining cell towers, I made attempts at contacting her. She, and everyone else gone with the Minnesota Void had long since been declared dead by the state, but without bodies, I still found myself unable to believe that she was truly gone.

“This is Olivia. I’m not around, too busy, or electing to ignore your call. Please leave a message,” the memory of her voice said as the call timed out.

But as I mourned her absence, the world continued to move towards total annihilation. What little resources we had to share diminished day by day. A system to divide rations had been initiated in February, but the size of our daily packages grew smaller over time. To keep people in check, our town was divided into districts, each with a non-elected leader responsible for the well-being, and more importantly the cooperation of its inhabitants. Our district was put under the leadership of the town’s Police Chief, Manuel Welsh. He was a soft-spoken man, but one terminally bound to an outdated set of rules. He meant well, but his efforts weren’t particularly effective. Not to mention that he was prone to acts of desperation.   

During our daily ration handouts, I’d come to know a man by the name of Daniel Larsen. He spent most of each day hanging around the district’s meeting point getting the latest news from around the world. His home had vanished to a void event almost a month prior, leaving him stuck in one of the many refugee centers, a fate he described as worse than death.

“Why would they bring hundreds of people together in a confined space, knowing that it’s just a matter of time before one of them get erased, killing everyone inside,” he explained, “not that I’d mind, these places are real fucking hellholes.”

I didn’t have much of a response, but I got the feeling he needed someone to vent to, so I listened patiently. He, and the rest of the victims knew that there were no viable solutions. Letting off steam was all they had left to do to cope with their loss.

“I heard they found an anomaly on the far side of the Moon. It looks like it’s not just Earth being destroyed. Makes you wonder, doesn’t it?” he said.

I’d heard the chatter about the extraterrestrial changes, specifically those on the Moon: vanishing craters, landscape malformations that were barely visible through a telescope. Though it did nothing to change the continuous destruction of our surroundings, it provided enough information to stop countries from pointing fingers at each other. For once, humanity didn’t appear to be the villain.

\*\*\*

March neared its end. With it, the first category one event on the Holloway Scale occurred on the thirtieth as the country of Hungary ceased to exist alongside sections of Austria, Romania, and Serbia. In its wake, another memory void had been formed. The neighboring countries scrambled to evacuate any town sitting on the edge of the void as anything near it started to collapse into nothingness.

That was the last piece of news to be shared through the public internet as our daily access was reduced to a meager hour a day. They claimed this change was a measure to ensure the continuous functionality of the local emergency services, but these had never relied directly on the internet. From that point onward, curated news would be available at our district’s ration point. Chief Welsh decided what was shared and when, but even through filtered messages, we knew it would only be a matter of time before our town too, would fall.  

With that, also the curfew would tighten, no longer allowing people to leave the town limits. Though the warnings hardly proved effective as people attempted to leave in droves without serious repercussions. After all, since no one could say which regions would fall victim to the next void event, there weren’t really any safe places to flee to. We were just left to survive, helpless and unable to take control of our fates.

\*\*\*

Tragically, on the second of April, as I returned home after collecting my daily ration, I was met with little more than a barren lot laid out where my apartment block had once stood. As with so many other things, it too had been taken by the erasure. Of those living there, an estimated twenty-four had perished, but those left alive were not necessarily better off.

Standing there, knowing what awaited, I began to understand Daniel’s wish for death as the void took from me the last bit of safety I had left. I had been spared, but it would change nothing about what was inevitably to come.

Left with nothing, I returned to the ration point to be placed into one of our town’s five refugee centers. For a moment, I contemplated living on the street, but in the month of April the nights provided little warmth to keep me alive. Unless I wanted to freeze to death, I needed somewhere to live, at least temporarily.

“It happened to you too, didn’t it?” Daniel asked as I returned wearing an expression of absolute hopelessness.

I nodded.

“I’ll talk to the Chief about getting you a half-decent shelter. The one I’m at isn’t too horrible if you’re comparing shit to vomit,” he said in stark contrast to what he had previously described as a fate worse than death. I could tell he pitied me.

Still, it was a minor comfort to have someone provide the little aid they could. Daniel had nothing to gain from helping me, and though it didn’t change much, at least I wouldn’t be alone.

“There’s been another category 1 event,” Daniel mentioned as we headed for the shelter.

“Which country did we lose?” I asked.

“State,” he corrected, “Alaska.”

It was odd, something so close had been erased from existence, but had Daniel not told me about it, I wouldn’t even have noticed. Thousands of people had died, but they had turned to little more than names on a list being removed in an arbitrary order.

“What do you think happens to the people who vanish?” I asked.

“What are you asking?”

“Do you think they go somewhere, are they just not there anymore.”

“Where would they go?”

“I don’t know, anywhere.”

“I think they went to the same place they were before they were born,” Daniel said, ending the discussion.

The shelter that would serve as my future home had once been a warehouse, but with shipments no longer arriving, it stood empty without a purpose. When it still held products, it had been a part of a car manufacturing company, receiving parts from a factory in China that had also ceased to exist. Now, the warehouse served as shelter for almost two hundred souls scattered around the floor in sleeping bags. Most of the victims displaced had lost everything as their homes fell to the void, leaving them in a sort of purgatory. Now I had become one of them.  

“It’s the best we’ll get,” Daniel explained, “at least we’re not alone.”

With the move to the shelter, days started to blend into each other. I spent most of the daylight hours either at the ration point, or just walking the streets, looking at neighborhoods I had once known, now turned to barren landscape. It appeared that voids in the ground formed proportional to the area that was taken. Small houses barely left a dent in the ground, while cities caused endless holes in the ground that broke through reality itself.

I walked past the lot where Quake’s Burgers had once stood, now marking the final memory of my past life erased from existence. Hours spent flipping patties, earning just above minimum wage, time that in the grand scheme of things had changed nothing about the final outcome of my life.

\*\*\*

Already at the end of April did we finally lose almost all forms of communication with the outside world. With the voids creating literal holes in reality, the infrastructure we had once taken for granted no longer functioned. Any limited contact would now come in via satellite phone, but it provided us with more than the rapidly increasing numbers of those deceased in the hourly void events. City by city, country by country, the world fell apart, and by the end of the month, half the world’s population had perished. We were just part of the half that still lingered, but our expiration date approached quickly as well.

Once May rolled around, the supplies had reached a historic, critical low. Even though our population had diminished, it wouldn’t keep us fed for more than two weeks at most. Civil unrest arose, and Chief Welch tried to quell it by initiating martial law, a fatal mistake. With nothing left to fight for, his own men immediately turned on him, and as a result he was executed in the town square on the fifteenth of May, alongside three other district leaders who had attempted to keep control by force. It was a hollow victory for those who sought to unseat them, we had bought ourselves days, if not weeks at most. Either we were swallowed by the void, or we starved to death.

Then, on the seventeenth of May, our time had finally come. For a long time, I had obsessed about the questions of how it would feel, and where we would go. I wondered how the world would look during its last few seconds of existence, and whether or not we would feel our own demise.

But our death would turn out to be a profoundly anticlimactic experience as the event lasted for all of one second before we disappeared. There was moment of intense fear, then a brief sensation of falling, followed by nothing, as if my body refused to register its last moment clinging to life. There were no final thoughts, no fear, no pain. There was just… nothing.

\*\*\*

I shot up in bed, gasping for air as if awakening from a horrific nightmare. The first rays of sunlight peered in through the window, a comforting sight that I shouldn’t have been around to witness. Moments ago, I had died, fallen into an endless void alongside thousands of our town’s inhabitants. Yet, I was alive, back in my apartment that had vanished over a month ago.

My head pounded from a headache that felt like it had come from an overindulgence in alcohol. Before I could get a grasp on my bearings, a loud knock on the door caught my attention, alongside a familiar voice that couldn’t possibly exist.

“Marcus, open the door!” the voice demanded, “I know you’re in there.”

Olivia was calling my name from outside, clear as day, alive and well. I jumped out of bed, wearing nothing but my underwear as I rushed downstairs to make sure I hadn’t lost my mind. Upon opening the door, as if the last five months had never happened, stood Olivia, wearing an angry expression on her face.

“What the hell, dude?” she asked before

She then froze for a moment, realizing that I wasn’t wearing more than a pair of boxer shorts that had seen better days.

“Uh, why are you naked-ish,” she asked.

“Olvia?” I half asked half stated, “you’re alive?”

“No shit I’m alive. What’s wrong with you? Are you still drunk?”

“I—I—I don’t understand. You were d—” the word got stuck in my throat.

“I was what?” she asked, “pissed off? Damn right I was. Still am, for your information. You bailed on me last night!”

“Last night?” I asked.

“The party? You got wasted and left before the countdown.”

“Last night?” I repeated.

The flurry of emotions piling up within me was hard to endure. I was ecstatic to see Olivia again, confused as to how I had survived, and unsure what day it even was.

“Alright, you’re clearly not sober yet, so there’s no point talking to you, yet. Go back to bed and call me when you’re yourself again,” Olivia said, turning around to leave.

I took a few steps outside, wanting to ask her to stay and explain to me what was going on, but I was speechless. I looked around the neighborhood, a light layer of snow covering the street, houses and apartment buildings lining each side of the street. It was all there, as if the void events had never occurred.

Though I was too deep in shock to understand what had just happened, I would quickly realize that I had been sent back in time to wake up on the first of January 2026 for the second iteration, and with thirty-five more to go, things were just [getting started.](https://www.facebook.com/richard.saxon.author)
