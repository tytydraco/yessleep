I had until midnight, she had said. 



Now it was 3:27 in the afternoon, and I was sitting in my apartment on Western Avenue, staring at a cheap black-and-white photo of a man named Rodney Dirkowitz. I turned the photograph over in my fingers. It was the sort of cheap gloss they send to extras, an instant from a brief smile with a cropped wall of cheap stucco behind him. I could feel my organs writhing and bulging within my stomach like a blender changing modes. I had until midnight to kill Rodney Dirkowitz.



Outside the window my face smiled from a billboard, larger than life and insolent as a god. I had filmed that grin into permanence, the same fake smile from *Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye*. The movie posters had been plastered everywhere that week; “Martin Vale in *The Saint of Sunset Boulevard!*” My expression couldn’t be more different now. Photos are a kindness; they let people love an idea and not the clay that houses it.  
  
I glanced back down at the grainy photograph in my hand. Rodney had a face that belonged in the background of a film, one of those extras that walked behind the star to make the world feel real. Maybe that’s why it was so hard to look at him. I’d made a living off faces like his.



The photograph began to shake violently in my hands. I willed myself to calm down, but I realized that my skin was moving. The top of my hand rippled like a pool of water as something pressed from underneath. My veins stood up against the skin, blue and tight as they writhed like snakes. My stomach clenched and contorted hard enough to make me gag. I could feel the buildup of gas bubbles churning within me as I stumbled from my chair and threw open the bathroom door. I leaned over the sink as a viscous mass erupted from my throat, followed by a steady stream of blood. I caught my breath for a moment, gazing down at the crimson deluge that filled my formerly pristine sink. It was a quivering, pulsating mass of pus and bloody gelatin, littered with a few chunks of ruptured flesh, like flattened meatballs within a murky jell-o. 



Blinking away the pain, I looked up at my reflection in the bathroom mirror. The light overhead buzzed and blinked as I ran a hand down my face, trying to collect my thoughts. I froze, my hand halfway down my face. My skin felt soft and sticky, like clay left out in the sun. I carefully lifted my hand from my face, stringy bits of flesh falling away like cheese from a fresh slice of pizza. Two red handprints were etched onto my skin, the lower levels of skin exposed to the harsh light. I carefully walked out of the bathroom, grabbing my coat from the sofa and opened the door to my apartment. 



Outside, Los Angeles looked like it always did, too bright and cheery for the things that happened in it. Taxis trundled their way down the crowded streets, passing men in gray suits walking quickly along the sidewalks, clutching their briefcases close. A kid licked a popsicle while a woman in a red dress stepped out of a florist’s with a handful of lilies. I glanced back up at the billboard, my chest twisting in pain. I looked back down to see a phone booth beside the drugstore. The door creaked shut behind me as the smell of old cigarettes and glass cleaner filled my nose. My reflection stared back at me in the dirty glass, blurred around the edges. I pulled the folded phone book from the rack and flipped through the D’s until I found him. Dirkowitz, Rodney. 3811 Union Avenue. Westlake.



I wrote it down on a spare diner napkin with some effort, the pen pressing into my soft flesh like a stylus in clay. When I pushed open the booth door, a man was standing on the sidewalk staring at me. He squinted and tilted his head.



“Hey… say, aren’t you—”



I forced a smile. “Nope.”



He frowned, trying to place me.



“I get that a lot,” I said. “People think I’m that actor. What’s-his-name.”



“Martin Vale?”



“That’s the one,” I said, flashing him a smile as I moved past him. “You have a good night, pal.”



I turned the corner fast, my heart hammering in my chest like a war drum. I couldn’t let anyone see me. If the studio got wind I was walking around like this, I’d be finished.



The smile had set off another cascade. My left eyelid thickened and sagged like a waterlogged curtain. The corner of my mouth quivered as if snakes had nested under the skin. 



I ducked into a store across the street, scanning the aisles until I found what I needed; a long tan trench coat, a fedora, and a pair of dark sunglasses. I threw a couple bills on the counter and staggered towards the door. Thankfully, the clerk didn’t even look up from his magazine.



As the door swung shut behind me, the ache in my gut spread to my ribs. My stomach bulged and shifted as if it was filled with a wet load of cement struggling to set. I leaned against the storefront and steadied myself until my head stopped spinning, then I buttoned the coat up past my neck, shoved the sunglasses on, and kept walking.



The trench coat hid the first small depressions that formed along my forearms, little indentations that made my veins stand out like cords. It masked the soft give under my ribcage where the tissue seemed to be unspooling from the bone. Under the hat, the band of hair along my temple pulled away from my skull with sloppy wet sound. I kept touching it instinctively, and each time my fingers came away with a smear, a fine dusting that collected on the napkin where Rodney’s address lay.



Rodney’s place was a squat little building with a cracked sign that read *Magnolia Terrace Apartments*. I stood in the phone book on the corner of the block, across the street from the apartment steps, just close enough that I could see the numbers on the mailboxes. I picked up the phone, keeping the receiver off the hook to make it look like I had a reason to stand there. Strands of flesh stuck to the plastic surface, strewn across it like melted cheese.



Ten minutes later, Rodney stepped out of the front door, wearing a plain white shirt and slacks, his hair neatly combed back. He stopped halfway down the steps to light a cigarette, then walked down the block toward the streetcar stop.



I watched him buy a paper from a dirt-stained kid. He leaned against a side-post and flipped him an extra quarter, a shadow of a half-smile flitting across his face as the kid beamed up at him gratefully. Rodney boarded the streetcar and laughed with the driver, who slapped him on the back, a smile spreading across his tired face. 



In the reflection of the glass, I saw myself. My jaw had sagged, the bone slightly detached from the drooping flesh. The flesh under my chin hung like melted candlewax.



Rodney got off three stops later on a cleaner street lined with diners and mom-and-pop stores. He stopped just before a corner deli and took a deep breath, adjusting his hair and popping a breath mint. He turned the corner and smiled when he spotted someone inside. A woman in a blue dress was wiping down the counter. He waved at her and she beamed back at him.



Through the glass, I watched them talk for a few minutes. I couldn’t hear a thing, but I could see enough. She laughed at something he said. I got the impression he was asking her out to dinner.



My stomach twisted again, hunching me forward as I pressed my hand to it. I felt skin along my ribs bubbled beneath my hand like frothing milk. When I pulled my hand away, it came back slick with a viscous slime. I leaned against the glass wall of the phone booth and tried to breathe.



She had said midnight.



I checked my watch. 6:43.



Five hours left.



I needed a plan. I couldn’t just shoot him on the street, not unless I wanted to film my next role from a prison cell. I had to find a place where I could make it look like an accident… maybe his apartment. I could follow him home and wait for the right moment.



I stayed in the booth, watching them through the glass as they talked. She poured him coffee while he grinned at her like she was the last source of light in the world.



When the sun dipped, the light thinned, and a cold came in with it, a pre-midnight that stung my exposed skin. When he reached across the counter to touch her hand, something in my chest snapped.



I wasn’t jealous or angry, I was scared. Because while he smiled, I felt my own lips beginning to tear. I lifted a trembling hand and touched my face. The side of my face had completely split open. When I pulled my fingers away, they ran with blood.



They stayed in the diner until her shift ended and taking her hand in his, he led her out the door. The second he started off down Church Street, I knew where he was going. I’d dined a fair share of women there myself, at the Club Ambassador. Surprise washed over me as they turned into a small corner deli with scuffed linoleum and sat at a booth. I stood in a phone booth three blocks away and watched.



I felt the transformation tear away at me like a heavy rain, rivulets of liquid running down my body as my skin stiffened and tore like a thin sheets of paper.



I pressed a handkerchief against the corner of my mouth and the blood soaked through it almost instantly. My jaw throbbed in time with my heartbeat and I realized with a sinking feeling that I couldn’t feel my nose anymore.



Across the street, Rodney was paying the bill. She ran a hand along his arm as he scribbled his signature.



When they stepped out onto the sidewalk, I kept behind the glow of a streetlamp. My coat collar was pulled up to my ears and my hat tiled low in an attempt to hide my ruination.



Rodney was talking about something animatedly, waving his hands and laughing. The girl, Mary, I’d heard him call her that—walked close beside him. She had a yellow scarf tied in her hair, and she gazed up at him as if she was looking upon the face of God.



They didn’t have any right to look so happy.



I stayed far enough back to not raise suspicion. The air had filled with frigidity and the breeze off the boulevard carried the smell of frying oil, perfume, and car exhaust as my stomach made a noise like wet paper tearing.



I followed behind them as they crossed the street, staying a few cars behind. I clutched my side as the pain in my stomach had grown sharper. My coat felt tight around my shoulders, like the fabric was shrinking. Every few blocks, I reached under the lapel to feel my chest. Each time, it was softer and more pliable, like a wet dough.



At the next light, a couple walked past me and the woman frowned. She was staring at my jaw. I looked down quickly, but not before she gasped and clutched her boyfriend’s arm.



I turned down the next alley, my heart racing. The pain behind my eyes was blinding now, the world shimmering around the edges as my head swam. I could smell myself, a sweet rotten scent like meat left out in the sun.



There was a gas station at the end of the street, a faded open sign buzzing in the window. The man inside was reading a magazine and didn’t look up as I walked in the door. I grabbed a roll of bandages and a bottle of aspirin from the nearest shelf, my hand slick against the plastic surface.



“Bathroom?” I rasped.



He pointed to the far wall without looking.



Inside, the mirror over the sink was cracked, and the tile floor was yellowed with age. I locked the door behind me and turned to the mirror.



My skin had completely sagged from my face, peeling away in loose folds of fat. Streaks of the blood-red flesh that lay beneath the surface had been laid bare and I gingerly touched the exposed bone where my nose used to be. As I stared into the mirror, the last few strands of skin still attached tore away and my face fell to the floor. I stooped down and picked up the fleshy mass, examining it with a perverse curiosity as I distorted the skin into that million dollar smile.



I flung the flesh into the bathroom trash can and downed the bottle of aspirin before reaching for the roll of bandages and unbuttoning the coat from my neck. I wound the bandages around my malformed torso and head, the squelching sound of settling organs sending another wave of nausea washing over me. It was like binding undercooked meatloaf, my blood already soaking through the white cloth. I’d have puked, if it hadn’t meant my intestines would erupt from my throat. I pulled the hat back on, tucked the sunglasses into the weave of bandages and buttoned my coat to the neck. 



The man behind the counter didn’t say a word when I set down a few bills for the bandages and the aspirin.



Stepping outside, the cold air burned as it entered my lungs. I could hear it sizzling like acid within my chest.



Rodney and Mary were sitting on a bench outside an ice cream parlor, sharing a vanilla ice cream cone. The streetlight above them lit everything in a dreamy haze.

I stood behind a row of newspaper boxes across the street and watched them closely.



He was talking about something funny and she doubled over laughing, the ice cream nearly falling from her cone. He caught it with his hand and laughed with her. He had that same open, easy grin that had always felt fake for me, stretching my skin for years and years.



They walked slowly down the sidewalk as I followed closely behind, my shoes squelching faintly with each step, like walking through mud. I stayed on the opposite side of the street, trying to match their pace. My legs didn’t move correctly anymore, the joints too loose in some places and too tight in others, forcing me into an awkward shuffling gait.



They reached her apartment building, a standard brick building with a little white fence, and flowers growing through the cracks. Mary stopped at the gate and turned towards him.



“I had a lovely time,” she said. I could read her lips even from across the street.



He said something back, smiling nervously. She leaned in and kissed him quick on the cheek, then turned away and skittishly traipsed inside. Rodney stood there for a second like he couldn’t believe it had happened. He looked up at the sky and pumped his fist like a kid who’d won a prize at the fair. 



I felt the skin on my neck slip peel away from my collar. I reached up to pull it back and felt a warm slickness between my fingers. When I looked down, the front of my trench coat was wet with blood. I stumbled, my shoes clapping loudly against the pavement. Rodney’s head turned suddenly, searching in my direction. I ducked below a low hedge, my heart pounding and my hands trembling as a thick liquid began to steadily stream from beneath my coat.



Mary’s voice called from her window, drawing his attention. She said something about forgetting his hat. He laughed and waved to her as she tossed it down to him. He caught in with an exaggerated gesture and blew her a kiss goodnight.



He turned and walked down the street, whistling under his breath and spinning his hat around in his hands. 



I waited a full minute before standing up again, the night quiet except for the hum of the streetlights. I could tell that bandages around my head were damp now. The fabric clung to me, dark and sticky beneath the brim of my hat.



I stepped out from behind the hedge, still quivering uncontrollably, and followed him at a distance. The trench coat hung strangely off my distorted form and I felt pieces of myself shifting inside it with every step.



He crossed the street and reached for the door to his apartment building. My time was now. I stumbled across the street, moving haphazardly towards him. He walked into the lobby, the door swinging shut behind him. I pulled it open with some effort, stepping into the lobby, overwhelmed by the smell of cigarettes and old rainwater. 



Rodney’s name was on a brass plate next to door 2B. I pressed my ear against the wood and I heard running water. He was in the shower. I reached for the door handle and it turned smoothly beneath my hand. I stepped over the threshold and into his small one-room apartment with a bed, a tiny table, and lit only by a single lamp.



I glanced up at the clock on the wall.



11:51.



Steam curled out from the doorway of the bathroom. I could see his shadow moving behind the shower curtain. I reached into the pocket of my trench coat and tried to grab my revolver, but I couldn’t feel the handle.



I stared down at my arm in horror. The flesh had completely melted away, leaving only a few strands of tendons and the exposed bone. I turned back to the doorway and saw the remains of my hand still wrapped around the door handle. 



A raw sound erupted from my throat, somewhere between a growl and a sob. I braced myself against the wall, leaving a dark smear. 



I staggered toward the bathroom, my flesh pulsing beneath the bandages. The pain was like a burning fire now, searing through every exposed nerve. The heat hit me as I stumbled into the room, sizzling against me. The bright lights burned my dry eyes and I hissed, the protective layers of my eyelids long since melted away.



Something inside me gave way as my chest swelled, then sank, then swelled again, contracting like a mother giving birth. I could hear the bones grinding within me as my hat fell from my undulating head. The sunglasses clattered to the tile as the bandages loosened and fell to the floor like snakeskin.



Rodney pulled the curtain aside and his face went white. I don’t know what he saw. I couldn’t see clearly anymore. My eyes spun askew within my bulbous flesh as everything ran together. He screamed and tripped backward into the tub, the water splashing against the wall. I lunged at him and he fought me, wrapping his hands around my skeletal frame, but I was barely more than a pile of wet meat pressing him down. I pooled around him, holding him in place as I reached with what was left of my arm and drove it down into his chest.



I pushed down with all of my might, once, twice, three times. I heard the sound of cracking bone as I bludgeoned away repeatedly and I wasn’t sure if it was his bones or mine. The water turned red in the tub, mixing with his pooling blood and the pieces of me that the boiling water stripped away, chunks of cooking flesh swirling in the viscous crimson tide.



His screaming stopped and I felt his body go still under mine. The light above the mirror flickered as I struggled to my feet, my bones screaming at me in pain. I stared down at the corpse and the holes that lined its chest, wide and dark. For a moment, I couldn’t move as my flesh dripped onto the tiles.



I felt a warmth blossom in my stomach as the pain began to fade and the noise in my head went silent. I stumbled backwards, my body feeling impossibly light. My arm trembled when I lifted it. My hand was whole again, the skin clean and smooth. I gingerly touched my face, the flesh firm and my jaw solid.



I let out a peal of relieved laughter, joyously running my hands across my whole body, feeling every inch of my form, thankful for every stretch of skin.



I heard the clock in the other room strike twelve, the chime echoing through the apartment. I leaned on the sink, breathing hard. I wanted to cry. I wanted to sleep. I looked at my hands again, just to be sure. They were as smooth as ever, healthier, even.



I turned my head, wiping the sweat from my forehead as I looked into the mirror.

A pulsating, wet mound of flesh stared back at me, half-sunken eyes spinning across its surface, writhing and distorting with every haggard breath. My hands flew to my face and the mound mirrored my movements, stretching its skin as its mouth spread wider.



I recognized the smile in the mirror.
