I came back to Coal Creek, West Virginia because no one else would.

My aunt’s in Florida. My cousins stopped answering the group chat after Grandma asked where their mother was… for the third time that week. My dad’s dead. That left me.

She didn’t need a phone call.
Not a ride to the doctor.
She needed someone in the house.

Someone to make sure the stove got turned off.
Someone to stop her from wandering barefoot into the woods at night.

I wasn’t the best person for it. Just the last one still breathing who hadn’t blocked her number.

So I packed a duffel, left a note for my boss, and drove east through the hills until the cell signal dropped and the trees got tall enough to blot out the sky.

The house hadn’t changed.

Same sagging porch. Same flickering bug light. Same cracked window above the sink where Grandpa put his fist through it in ‘92.

But Grandma had.

Inside smelled like burnt coffee and old lemon cleaner…
Not the bright kind. The kind that burns behind your nose.
Bitter and chemical.
Like something sour trying to cover something worse.

The floor creaked more than I remembered.
The hallway near the bathroom dipped a little… like the boards were soft underneath.
Wallpaper bubbled and peeled near the seams.
The living room window had duct tape over one pane, yellowed and curling at the corners… like nobody had touched it since the Clinton years.

She was in the recliner.
Same one Grandpa used to fall asleep in with a beer on his chest.
Blanket over her lap.
Ashtray full of loose screws beside her.
TV off, just reflecting the window behind me in that grey, dead glass.

“Hey, Grandma… it’s me.”

No answer.

She blinked slow… eyes cloudy like wet marble.

“You probably don’t remember I was coming. That’s okay. I brought your pills and some groceries… figured I’d stay a few days.”

Still nothing.
Just that soft scratch-scratch of her nails picking at the blanket.

Then, without turning:

“You smell like your daddy.”

Her voice was thin… brittle, like wind through dry grass.
Not warm. Not angry. Just… factual.

I gave a tired smile. “That a good thing or a bad thing?”

She didn’t answer.

Her gaze stayed locked on the dark TV… like it was showing her something I couldn’t see.

I moved toward the kitchen to put the groceries away… left her sitting there in the chair.

I was halfway through putting cans in the cupboard when I heard her voice again… low and quiet:

“He came back… I told you he would…
no, don’t start crying now… I told you, didn’t I?”

I peeked around the corner.

She was still facing the blank TV.
Still alone.
Still whispering.

I slept in the back room.
Used to be my dad’s when he was a kid.
Twin mattress on a metal frame.
Same thin yellow sheets with faded cowboy prints.
Same dresser with the broken top drawer that always slid open a few inches on its own.

The air back there felt… wrong.

Heavy.
Like it didn’t want to move unless you gave it permission.

I cracked the window and laid down with my hoodie as a pillow.
No fan.
Just that old stillness you only get in houses where people die slow.

I could hear her down the hall for a while… mumbling.
Not loud enough to make out the words.
Just a steady drone. Like someone praying underwater.

At one point she laughed.
Sharp. Sudden.
Like someone had whispered a joke in her ear.

It stopped after a while. I guess she fell asleep.
I tried to do the same.

The dreams were strange.

Pressure and heat… like something heavy was sitting on my chest.
The sound of water running behind the walls.
A breath that wasn’t mine… brushing close to my ear.

It didn’t feel like sleep.
It felt like being held under.

I woke up with my heart hammering.

The room was dark… still.
But the door was cracked open now.

I know I closed it.

For a second, I thought I saw something… a shape in the hallway.
Short. Slouched. Leaning forward like it was listening.

I sat up.

“Grandma…?”

The shape shifted… stepped into the low light spilling in through the living room window.

It was her.

Thin housecoat. Eyes wide and glassy. Arms limp at her sides.
Just standing there, staring in at me like she didn’t know who I was.

I got up slow… eased toward her.

“You okay…? You need something?”

She flinched when I got close. Didn’t speak.
Just turned and shuffled back down the hall barefoot, muttering something too low to catch.

I watched her bedroom door close behind her.

Didn’t sleep much after that.

She was quiet most of the afternoon.
Sat in the recliner watching static again… TV off, remote untouched.
Just staring at the glass.

I cleaned a little. Hauled some junk mail to the burn barrel out back.
Tried not to look at the woods too long.
They weren’t scary. Just… dense.
Claustrophobic in the daytime. Black by five.

I passed the bathroom on the way back to the guest room.

Door cracked.
Light on.

I heard snipping.
Quick. Rhythmic.
Sharp little metallic bites.

Snip… snip… snip.

“Grandma…?”

No answer.

I pushed the door open slow.

She was sitting on the toilet lid, hunched over her lap.
One hand holding a tissue.
The other… nail clippers.

Her foot was up on a stool.
Bare. Shaking.
She wasn’t trimming.
She was cutting.

All the way down.
Past the white.
Past the pink.
Into the bed.

The big toe was already bleeding.
The nail split and pulped… jagged like cracked tile.

She didn’t flinch.
Just kept snipping.
Eyes unfocused.
Mouth moving with a little tune I couldn’t place.

Snip… snip… snip.

“Grandma, stop… you’re gonna hurt yourself.”

She didn’t look up.

“It grows back if you let it…
just keeps coming back…”

Then she looked at me.
Real sudden.

Eyes wide. Red-rimmed. Wet like she’d just been crying… except there were no tears.
Just that shaky smile people make when they’ve been alone too long.

“You’ve got your daddy’s feet…
I always hated that about him.”

She was different the next day.
Quieter. But twitchy.
Kept folding and unfolding a dishrag with her thumbs like she didn’t know where she was.
Her teeth clicked. She wouldn’t eat.

I offered soup. Crackers. A protein shake.
She wouldn’t touch any of it.

Just stared at the window over the sink and said…

“It’s too cold for him out there…
don’t want him stiff before we get the nails in.”

I stopped moving.
She didn’t even look at me.

“Grandma, what…?”

She blinked. Looked confused. Looked at me, but through me.

“Why’d you put your hair up like that for? You know how he gets.”

Then she started crying.
Real tears this time.
Covered her face and whispered I’m sorry, I’m sorry, over and over like she didn’t know why.

I helped her back to bed.
She went easy.
Didn’t fight or mutter.
Just let me tuck her in and stared at the ceiling like it was showing her something I couldn’t see.

She was out cold by ten.

I couldn’t sleep.

The house was too quiet.
That kind of quiet where you can hear it… like pressure behind your ears.

I left the door cracked. Just a little. In case she called for me.

Around 1:30, I heard movement.
A soft creak.
Another.

I thought she was up again.
Maybe headed to the bathroom.
Maybe just wandering.

I stepped into the hall.

Her door was still shut.
The light was off.

But the living room…

The recliner was rocking.

Just slowly.
A soft, steady creeeee—creeeee—creeeee.
Like a kid pushing themselves in time with a lullaby.

Nobody was in it.

I stared too long.
Didn’t move.

I walked up close. Real slow.
Every board creaking like it didn’t want me near.

There was something on the cushion.

Not a coin.
Not a crumb.

A fingernail.

Fresh. Pale.
Split down the middle.
The kind of rip that doesn’t happen by accident.

The rocking stopped the second I picked it up.

No wind.
No movement.

Just the TV flickering blue in the corner.
Still unplugged.




The next morning she was already awake.
Sitting stiff in her rocker like she’d never gone to bed at all.

No TV. No radio.
Just the low scrape of her nails against the armrest.

She was humming again.

Same tune as before.
Something slow. Maybe a church thing.
Or maybe just something she made up.

I brought her oatmeal.
Hoped the warmth might pull her back into herself.

She didn’t look up.

“They always name ‘em,” she said.

Voice flat.
Not talking to me. Just… out loud.

“That’s where it goes wrong.
You give it a name, you start thinking it means something.
Don’t give animals names.
Makes it harder to bury ’em.”

She scooped a spoonful of oatmeal and brought it to her lips like nothing was wrong.
Chewed. Swallowed. Looked at me, finally.

“Did you check the lock on the shed?
The wind was up last night.”

I hadn’t.
Didn’t even know it had a lock.

I just nodded and said yeah, I would.

She smiled. Real soft.
Almost proud.

Then went back to humming.

It was just after midnight when I heard the screen door creak.
I hadn’t been sleeping well.
Dad’s old mattress was rather thin.
And the smell of that house—mothballs and old piss and something worse underneath—clung to the roof of my mouth no matter how many times I brushed my teeth.

I sat up.
Wiped the sweat from my chest.
Listened.

No wind. No bugs.
Just the hum of the fridge and the slow groan of something settling on the back deck.

I cracked the curtain open.

Grandma was out there.
Barefoot.
Nightgown hanging loose off one shoulder.
Standing still in the dark like she’d been poured into it.

In her hands were the shears.
Not kitchen scissors. Not hedge trimmers.
The old iron kind. The farm kind.
Rust like dried blood flaked down the handles.
Blades long enough to snip a chicken’s head off clean.

She wasn’t cutting anything.
Just holding them.
Arms low and relaxed.
Like someone waiting their turn.

She was humming again.

I didn’t go out.
Didn’t call her name.
Just stood there… curtain pinched between my fingers… watching the soft sway of her shoulders as she turned and walked back inside.

She never looked at me.
But she set the shears on the kitchen counter before going back to bed.

I didn’t touch them.
I couldn’t.



She died on a Thursday.

No screams. No fall. Just… gone.

I found her in bed, curled into the blanket like a child.
One hand tucked under her chin. Mouth slack. Eyes open.

The hospice nurse said it was peaceful.
I believed her.

There wasn’t a service.
The county buried her next to Grandpa at the edge of Coal Creek Cemetery—no headstone, just a brass tag and a mound of disturbed dirt.
No one else came.

I stayed behind to pack the house.

Three days of dust, mildew, and silence thick enough to chew.
Moth-eaten dresses. Expired pills. Jars of paperclips sorted by size.
Granny’s mind had left long before her body did.

Then I found the box.
Wrapped in butcher paper. Duct tape peeling.
Tucked deep under her bed like a secret that didn’t want to be remembered.

Inside were photos.

Stacks of them.

Not Polaroids. Not prints.
These were darkroom-developed, edge-curled, yellowed at the corners—decades old.

They weren’t family photos.

No birthdays. No cookouts.
Just bodies.

Kneeling. Bound.
Dressed in clothes that looked local… Coal Creek diner uniforms, Sunday dresses, feedstore overalls.

Some of them were gagged.
All of them were hurt.

Eyes swollen. Teeth missing. Arms bruised from restraint.

And in every third or fourth picture…
Grandma.

Grinning.
Hair done. Makeup heavy.
Holding a leather belt in both hands like she was about to teach a lesson.

Then came the final photo.
I swear I can still see it when I blink.

She posed in the rocker like she wanted the photo to seduce someone—legs open, lace clinging to her hips, a severed head nestled where a lover’s face might go.
One stocking was rolled down.
Her panties were bunched around one ankle like she’d peeled them off slow.
If the head wasn’t there, I swear to God…

That’s when I noticed the background.

Behind the chair… the shape of a window.
A wooden wall.
A hanging tool.

The shed.

Not just any shed.
Her shed.
The one behind the house.
The one with a padlock so rusted it looked fossilized.

I didn’t think.
I just grabbed a flashlight and headed for the door.




The padlock came off with one tug.
I don’t think she even locked it.

The door groaned on the hinge like something breathing shallow.

I stood there for a second, flashlight trembling in my grip, breathing in mold and cold dirt.

The shed wasn’t big—maybe ten by ten—but it felt deeper than it should’ve been.
Like there was weight in the air.
Something that wanted to be left alone.

I stepped inside.

The light swept across stacked crates, rusted tools, a workbench stained the color of old liver.
There were flies… slow, drunken ones… buzzing in lazy loops.

And then the jars.

Four of them.

Mason jars.
Dust-caked. Unlabeled.
Sealed with wax.

One held a shriveled tongue… gray and curled like something chewed and spat out.
Another was full of teeth, floating like pearls in a yellow brine.
The third had what looked like three fingers, swollen and pickled, the nails blackened and split.

The last jar was worse.

Not for what was in it…
but what wasn’t.

Just murk.
A fog of rot.

I turned to the workbench.

There was a wooden box with an old 8mm film reel inside… labeled in pen: For Later.

Beside it:
A roll of leather straps, stained dark.
A pair of rusted shears.
A folded apron, stiff with dried blood.

Not splatter. Not a stain.
Soaked.
Front to back.
Like someone wore it while butchering something that screamed.

I couldn’t breathe.

The shed smelled like pennies and vinegar and meat left in the sun.

My knees buckled.
I dropped to one hand, coughing into the dirt.

There were scratch marks on the inside of the door.
Fingernail-deep.
Like someone tried to claw their way out.

And then I heard it.

A creak.

Slow. Rhythmic.

From the house.

From the rocking chair.

The house was still dark when I stepped back inside.
I didn’t turn on any lights.
There was no point.
I already knew where the sound was coming from.

The hallway stretched long and still…
smelling like dust and boiled potatoes and the faint copper whiff that clings to old women’s hair.

The closer I got to the living room, the more I could feel it.
That wrong pressure.
Like the air was watching me.

I turned the corner.

The rocking chair was moving.

Back and forth.
Back and forth.
Slow and even.
No wind. No draft.
Just motion.

There was no one in it.

Just that old, worn afghan folded across the back…
The one she always used to cover her knees.
The one that still smelled like her.

I didn’t move.
Didn’t breathe.

And then…

Her voice.

From the chair.
Low. Close.
Warm like it used to be.

“You found my things, didn’t you?”

I couldn’t speak.

“S’pose you know now.”

The chair kept rocking.
One… two… three…

Then it stopped.

Just like that.

The house went still.

The chair’s empty.

But when I pass that room…
it feels like she’s grinning at me.

Like she’s not done.
