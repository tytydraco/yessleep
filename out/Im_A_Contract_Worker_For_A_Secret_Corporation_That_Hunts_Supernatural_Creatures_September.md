A smaller creature jumped attempting to rip away flesh. A well-placed punch smashed it to pieces only to have to reform again. The stranger took the bow from his hip to fire a few shots. His arrows were simply sharpened sticks he embedded with magic. He did not have enough premade arrows ready. We were simply outnumbered. In the middle of fighting for my life, I noticed something. Whatever he hit did not get back up.   

“Parasitic cores!” he shouted then gracefully rolled away to avoid being cut in half.  

He didn’t need to explain further. I understood how these ice creatures worked with the brief exchange. The body parts were infected with a small insect that was connected to the magic source of the mountain. Destroying the flesh or ice would do nothing. We needed to kill the core.  

My right eye was still blinded. It caused a strain on my left when I focused hard to see small flickering spots inside the flesh and ice. Unlike the stranger, I didn’t have a weapon I could use to attack deep inside the targets.  

At the moment I was using all my strength to dodge the attacks. I was too slow a handful of times letting the sharp ice cut the side of my arms and legs. I couldn’t move fast enough and I had nothing nearby to use to fight back. Pain came from my chest as my lungs struggled to work in the cold air.  

A set of teeth were suddenly next to my face. On reflex, I shoved the palm of my right hand against the cold surface to protect my good eye. Gathering up some power from the air I shot it outwards. To my shock, it exploded the creature, ice and flesh spraying everywhere. I must have hit the core with that burst of magic.  

The palm stung for a second then recovered. Since it wasn’t a human hand, it could handle the backlash from magic and heal faster. Suddenly I had some way to stay alive.  

With my feet planted firmly on the ground I let the creatures come to me. The next few minutes were a flurry of motions as I quickly pulled magic and then forced it into anything that got too close. My jacket was shredded from the explosions. Every cell in my body screamed in pain. If I stopped for even a second it would be my death.   

August was still out there somewhere. As well as April. I needed to live and find them. The larger beast finally came down, the massive mouth opened large enough to swallow me whole.  

Something I never expected to happen. My arm no longer felt like my own. White hot pain ripped through my body from it as the black casing started to crack. It was too late to stop the motion. I landed a hard punch to the creature's head, and a burst of magic that I shouldn’t have been able to control shot through my right arm obliterating everything in front of it.   

Once the smoke cleared, I wanted to keep moving looking for my two lost friends. My body had other ideas. My back found a tree as I gulped down air, coughing up specks of blood. A ringing sound came for a few minutes blocking out any other noise. When I recovered, I saw the stranger standing in front of me. Even with the fabric covering his face he didn’t look very pleased.   

“What is wrong with you! You nearly killed yourself! You didn’t let me help at all Have some respect for the body your parents gave you!” He yelled a hand on his hip and then started to call me some very harsh names in a language I didn’t understand.  

I took the abuse simply because I couldn’t move. He shoved a wooden flask in my good hand and a small bundle of wrapped dried meat in the other. I protested but he was having none of it. My stomach rolled at the thought of eating something and yet being yelled at was worst. The liquid was warm and sweet and oddly enough paired well with the meat. I was surprised at how much better I felt.   

“We need to get you out of the cold. I can-” He started but was interrupted when a shard of ice shot up aiming for his head.  

It was a last-ditch effort to try and take one of us down. He stepped back, the ice ripped the fabric from his face. It turned in midair ready to attack again. He didn’t let it. His bow raised and with one well-placed shot a sharpened twig blew away the last threat.  

“That startled me.” He admitted and turned my direction showing off a dimpled smile.  

At first, he didn’t realize his face was exposed. My heart skipped a beat or two as my face flushed. Saying he was handsome was an understatement. Some creatures would kill for looks like his. My brain was having issues. Yes, he was extremely good-looking looking but he shared facial features with August. I wasn’t attracted to him so seeing a better version of his face threw me off for a second.   

When he realized what I’d seen, an expression of dread overtook him. He let out a scream, covered his face with his hands then fled behind a tree.  

I was in too much shock to say anything right away.  

“Richie!”   

My heart skipped again, this time because of who called. August was a few feet above us. He easily jumped down the slope, dodging trees in his way, his long black coat moving in the breeze like a cape. When he landed, he instantly started to fuss over the poor injured human. He placed his coat around my shoulders and looked over the cut on my forehead.  

“Did you hear a girl scream just now or was that you?” He asked.  

I nodded toward the tree the other person hid behind. The stranger peeked his now-covered face around the trunk. August froze when his eyes landed on the figure.  He stared with a mixture of disbelief and hesitation on his face.  

“Tem...” His voice cracked so he cleared his throat to try saying the word again. “September?”   

The air was still between them for a minute. Then in a blur of motion, August raced over knocking the man to the ground in a tight hug. He rubbed his face against the fabric speaking in their language with an odd buzzing sound coming from them. When August finally pulled away September had a few questions.  

“I went by the village and it was gone. What happened to everyone? Why was there a destroyed ski resort on our mountain?” September said in a trembling voice. “Why did you never try to find me?”  

August pulled away with a clear kind expression. He didn’t want to bring down the moment by explaining what happened while September was gone. Instead, he truthfully answered the last question.  

“I forgot.” August nodded without a hint of shame.  

His words didn’t make any sense. How could he forget about a person he clearly cared so much about?  

“Did you find-” I started to ask but was cut off by another voice.  

“Dad?! What the fuck!” April shouted from behind me.  

She spat out a half-frozen leg she had gnawed on. I looked between the three of them, shocked at how similar they all were. September got up and rushed over to her, only to be flipped off his feet and shoved into the snow. She was not happy he had been gone for so long without trying to contact her. While April harassed her father, August moved over to me to inspect the damage.  

“The mountain isn’t happy with us. We can’t make a doorway out. We’ll need to walk down. Tell me when you get tired, I’ll carry you.” He offered.  

I shivered wondering if I would even live long enough in the elements to get off the mountainside. We kept moving and having a conversation would distract me from the cold.   

“How did you forget about a family member? Was he really gone for that long?” I pestered August.  

He carefully walked around trees and guided the way down the slope. I needed to take his hand a few times to avoid slipping because of my twisted ankle.  

“Our village was remote. We were aware our bloodlines were at risk of over-mixing. As a tradition, we sent out the most attractive member of our village into the world to bring back new creatures to mate with since our species can produce offspring with almost anything.” He explained. “It was never a guarantee that the person would return. It was easier on our hearts to assume they were dead until proven otherwise.”  

I understood his reasoning. From the sounds of it, September had been gone for a long time. Most likely since April was a child. Something else was bothering me. August wasn’t a half-breed so he didn’t share the same mother as April. But he did say they didn’t have the same father.  

“How is she your sister if you have different parents?” I asked looking over my shoulder at the pair following behind us.  

Without any doubt, all three of them were related by blood. Was September and uncle?   

“It’s... complicated.” August started.  

“We had the time.” I replied.  

Aside from the risk of being attacked again at any moment, we had nothing else to do but walk and talk.  

“My father was elderly when I was born. By the time I was an adult, he was at the end of his life span. My species can return to a larva state when they are close to death. However, most do not. Even though they appear similar, and the blood is the same they’re born again as a different person.” He paused for a moment to carefully pick out his next words. “My father never cried.”  

September was an emotional person. He wasn’t the stoic man August had for a father. They were related by blood and he still loved him like a family member. But he couldn’t see him as the man who raised him.  

“June sounded like he was blaming your father for your village being destroyed. From what I hear he was a different person when that happened.” I pointed out.  

August nodded. This all was a bit complicated.  

“The access to the grave isn’t passed down through blood. It needs to be given. While my father was alive, he refused. Our home had been threatened many times before. Even after his death, the ones against his wishes blamed him for not letting certain families have access to our full power.”  

If his father had permitted the wrong person, then this world would have been taken over a long time ago. He sacrificed the lives of the ones he loved the most for so many others. I wished they never needed to make such a choice.  

I stopped walking to rest against a tree for a second. My hands hurt like hell from the freezing air and my movements started to get slower. August took my left hand between his but it didn’t help. His body temperature wasn’t overly warm.  

“We need to get you out of the cold.” September said and started to pull off one of his fabric layers to offer to me.  

A crashing sound came from deep within the woods. We all tensed up ready for a fight. I wasn’t in any condition to help. August stuck nearby to defend the weakest member of the group. He was strong however he couldn’t reach his full potential unless he was on his home turf.   

A large shape rose out of the snow spraying it everywhere. The large body uprooted trees with glowing blue eyes landing on our small group. It almost appeared like a large bear with countless bones and body parts frozen between the ice. This thing was directly connected to the flow of the mountain. It was similar to a Will Of a Forest. The magic of the area had gained some sentience and created a body to act on it. One wrong step and we would be dead.  

I tried collecting power finding it impossible. My brain couldn't’ focus causing everything I reached out for to slip through my hands. I was simply too weak to put up a proper fight.  

The beast swiped the ground with a large powerful paw. It knocked us all back without even touching us. I slammed against a tree and August was pushed a few feet away stuck inside a pile of snow. April clings to a tree, a sharp rock slicing open her cheek. Bright blood dropped down then the cut healed. September got to his feet the fastest.   

Even with the fabric covering his face, I could feel the expression he was making. He grabbed the bow at his hip. The monster in front of us made his weapon look even smaller.  To my shock, it burst into a bright white light transforming into a bow taller than himself made of a sparkling material.   

He didn’t pull power from the mountain around us. As an arrow, he used a sharpened piece of bone from some sort of ancient creature. He drew back sending the odd arrow directly into the personification of the mountain. August knew of the danger we were in before I did.  

He used his body as a shield just before the moment a magical bomb went off. September’s single attack blew away the threat along with leaving a wide trail of fiery destruction. The heat was intense and I needed to be dragged away from the aftermath or else I would get cooked alive.  

“He’s very protective of April.” August explained when we were a safe distance away.  

I could see that. I reminded myself to never upset her now that her father was around.  

“Anyway, what happened to taking the day off?” My friend asked with his arms crossed.  

I wondered when he would bring this up. I did promise I wouldn’t take any jobs today and focus on Lucas’ play.  

“If I didn’t accept this request then you might not have found September again.” I defended myself.  

He punched my arm so hard I saw stars. Then my vision swam and I turned around to throw up what was left in my stomach.   

The adrenaline was slowly leaving my system from almost getting killed so many times today. I was crashing. Hard. I heard a new voice when everything around me started to go dark.  

My eyes opened to a dim room. Someone had put me in a bed in a spare room inside the office. These rooms were for when the clinic was full or if an Agent needed some rest between jobs.  

Since I was still wearing my ruined clothing I assumed I hadn’t been out for too long. A person was carefully cleaning the cut on my forehead and a small patch had been placed over my right eye.  

“Hey, handsome.” My words slipped out.   

I mentally kicked myself for saying that. Ito stopped when he saw I was awake. I reached out for his hand a bit surprised he took it.   

“Sorry, my hands aren’t very warm.” He admitted.  

I shook my head. My left hand was already starting to feel better.  

“Can we talk?” I asked him my stomach rolling from stress.  

“Do you feel good enough?” He pointed out.  

I bet I looked downright terrible. But I’ve had worse days.  

“Are you going to say I need a haircut and a good meal too?” I joked trying to smile.  

He reached out to brush some hair out of my face shaking his head.  

“No, you look fine with longer hair. You just need to style it.”  

Oh, that was nice to hear. Finally, someone wasn’t insulting my new lazy fashion choices. I let myself carefully pick out the words I wanted to say next.  

“I’m not saying this to pressure you into anything. But I think I would be able to handle it if anything happened to you.” I told him.  

Now might not be the right time to talk about any of this. Based on how things were going I might not get another chance though.  

“What was your last partner’s name?” He asked in an even voice.  

My throat became dry. No matter how hard I tried, that one word refused to come out of my mouth. Ito had just proven my last statement wrong with a single question. My old partner wasn’t even romantic. We trusted each other with our lives. When she died, I started into a downward spiral I’d yet to recover from.  

“I know you’re strong. Stronger than myself. I’m still trying to figure out if I could go on after losing you. Can you wait for me?”   

I nodded chest fluttering realizing I still had a slight chance with him. I would never force Ito into something he didn’t want. But I would wait for him for the rest of my life if it came to that. He promised we would talk about this again. Right now I needed to get some rest.   

Ito finished cleaning my wounds. I could barely stay awake. While half asleep I asked him to stay with me. Before I passed out again he climbed into the bed so we could both get a short rest before our hectic jobs came calling again.
