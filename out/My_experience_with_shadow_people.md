The First time I found something like a shadow person was when I was little and I was home alone. For context, I lived in a house with a closed yard. Because I guess I got bored of playing on my Wii, I decided to go outside for a while to get some fresh air I guess. Now, at this time, we had a cat that was a little hyperactive so there would be times he would knock some stuff off. Now when I was in my yard I saw a person, like an actual person running away from the garage, looking back, maybe it was a real person or maybe the way I turned my head but, still, I got scared but thought it could have been the cat doing some chicanery, however, as I started walking again I saw the cat in the grass looking in the same direction from where I saw the person. This creeped me out so I immediately went straight to the house and into my bedroom. The rest of the day until my family arrived I was scared in my room.  
  
That wasn't the only time though, If anything it was the first time it happened.  
  
  
When I was in 5th grade, an even creepier thing happened, I was playing with my DS late in the night, tomorrow I had school so I saw from the corner of my eye in figure of a man on the edge of my bed, I immediately thought that my dad had somehow sneaked into my bedroom and now he was going to now going to punish me for being playing so late. I accepted my fate, and I decided to give my DS to my dad, however, when I looked up, I realized that for at least 3 minutes I thought and somewhat saw a person on the edge of my bed only to realize that, there was no one there.  
  
After that, I don't remember having any similar experiences like that. Until now.  
  
The reason I decided to start writing this post, is that today, when I was doing some exercise I was something, I swear I saw a thing looking at me.  
  
Maybe it was how I dark it was or the reflection, but I saw something I swear and now, it was not from the corner of my eye. It was direct eye contact.  
  
This sounds like a horror story I know, You may think that Im writing a little horror story for a little karma but Im not.  
  
I was thinking of writing all of this to 4chan, but then changed my mind.  
  
But when I started writing this post, I been hearing this from my door and I know that it may have like an explanation or something but idk what to think at this point, perhaps Im just sleepy or maybe not.

Im sorry if some of the stuff Im writing may not be the best grammatically but I'm on edge right now.

I really should get some sleep, especially because Im starting to see things like eyes outside my window. yet again, my eyesight is not the best.  and there goes again, a sound in the door. Maybe it's the cat after all his food is in my bedroom. Im going to publish this and Im going to open the door, the poor thing probably is hungry, 

I think I should let it in.
