So much for the Hippocratic oath. If you don’t like needles, skip this one.

I stumbled out of the hospital an hour ago. The blood on my car seat is just drying now. I have to stay awake.

I went to the ER, and they immediately admitted me. After a CT scan, they didn’t find anything wrong other than some swelling around my brain like a concussion, but I knew something was up because they told me I should stick around. I told them about what was going on, and that they should check my lungs, but they wouldn’t listen. The emotions started hitting me at that point, and the look on the doctor’s face said I was being hysterical. I insisted more emphatically that something was wrong with me. I could feel it in my brain. I could feel it in my lungs. And I was so tired, because sleep paralysis was not sleep.

They gave me a sedative. They didn’t even tell me when they hooked up the IV. As I was pinching myself to stay awake, the room got darker. Before I knew it, the demon was in the corner of the room. Then she was on top of me. My chest almost caved in, so weak at this point. My lungs burned, and my breath sputtered. The world faded to blackness as I looked in her eyes. The only remotely comforting feeling was the cool tears sliding down my cheeks. Eventually they were erased by her rough tongue lapping them up, leaving patches of inflamed skin around my eyes. Even as they swelled, all I could see was her deep, endless eyes.

She drew both hands back, and each fingertip morphed into a long, sharp point. I watched as she removed the IV from my arm. Five sharp impacts hit each forearm. Strange flesh crept through my veins and wove its way up my arms. The veins in my biceps bulged, then my pecs and back, then my scalp, my brain, my eyes, my legs, my groin. Every one swelled, on the verge of popping like a balloon. The pain was unimaginable, and yet I experienced it over my whole body. Finally, the flesh entered my heart. A second heart formed inside mine and started beating.

With each pulse, I felt everything inside me, every muscle fiber, every nerve, my skin straining against the force. Each part of me was being pulled apart fiber by fiber. Every pulse. Beat after beat.

The sedative kept me asleep for eighteen hours. Upon waking, I laid in a state of near unconsciousness for what must have been another four hours. Eventually lucidity returned, and with it, adrenaline. I couldn’t let them sedate me again. I just had this feeling that the next time, I wouldn’t wake up.

As I ran out of the hospital, Isaac and Harris shared some brief thoughts.

Isaac was first. “I think this my be one of my new favorite stories we’ve read on the podcast.”

“Yeah man, I’m really digging this new body horror. This author has been so great at that.” Harris sounded on edge.

“And it’s amazing how consistently he has come up with so many creative ideas. Like, just keeps escalating it to new heights.”

“I’m so bought in at this point.  I’m just excited to see how he’s gonna kill this guy at the end.”

“Yeah, man, I have a feeling this final kill is gonna be awesome.”

“Ready to keep reading?”

“Oh yeah.”

“Alright, here we go. Last part.”

I’m trying to find somewhere I can stay awake that has access to a computer. I gotta watch this final episode.
