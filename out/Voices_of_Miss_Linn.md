Several years before I started [elementary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRsmlmHD0-A) school, I attended a daycare where one of the teachers was admitted to a mental hospital. She had likely disappeared from work earlier if we children had told other adults about what she was doing in the afternoons. But while all this was going on, of course, we children didn't understand how to interpret her behavior, much less about mental illness. Instead, we kept it as a secret between us and the teacher. Since I became mature enough and until recently, I mostly thought of what happened at daycare as tragic – in hindsight, the story seemed quite absurd, sad, and maybe a bit funny. But a few weeks ago, I met Jenny, who was one of my friends at daycare and unlike me, was there the afternoon the teacher was taken away by authorities. Jenny's story left me with a twisting uncertainty in my stomach.



Teacher Linn didn't have many years left until retirement when I attended daycare in the mid-80s. I remember very clearly her chalk-white, long hair, which she often let hang freely down her back. It was precisely that long, white hair that set her apart from the other adults I usually met, and she seemed different to us children from the start. But children don't necessarily think different is bad – different makes people strange and fascinating, something children must puzzle out and understand, like a riddle to ponder. Teacher Linn probably got many personal questions from us, especially about her long white hair, but I think she took it all in stride. I remember her as a gentle and caring teacher. She wasn't like Teacher Karen, who often directed things and whom it was best to either be friends with or steer clear of if you had done something wrong.



In the final year of daycare, Teacher Linn started taking an hour's nap after lunch. We children also had nap time in the afternoon, so the other teachers probably didn't need to explain this new arrangement in detail to us. Linn had worked in childcare for several decades, and the other teachers cared about her and allowed her this nap time now that she was getting older. We children were strictly told not to disturb Teacher between one and two o'clock, when she lay down on the couch in the staff room. Initially, one of the other teachers hovered nearby the room during Linn's nap time to check that no children ran around and disturbed her. But after a month without incidents, the guard duties were thinned out, and three of us older kids were quick to take advantage of the situation.



It started, as it usually does, with an unspoken challenge. It was me and Simon – we still hang out, now thirty years later – and Jenny. First, we dared each other to get closer to the door of the staff room. When Jenny had dared to go all the way up and peeked through the door, we started testing who dared to go further into the room instead. One of us always kept watch towards the corridor, in case any of the teachers showed up. We were, or thought we were, quiet as mice, whispering and sneaking likely with theatrically lifted legs, as we had seen animated characters do on TV.



This went on for a few days. In hindsight, I'm fairly certain the other teachers must have suspected something, but they obviously didn't catch us in the act.



There was one time when Jenny was keeping watch towards the corridor, and Simon and I were sneaking around and fooling around silently in the staff room, when a voice was heard from the couch where Teacher Linn was lying:



"Hello."



Simon and I froze and stared over at the teacher. Of course, we assumed we had been caught, that Linn had woken up, and that our whole little gang would get a telling-off. Not from the mild and kind Teacher Linn herself, perhaps, but certainly from strict Teacher Karen, who would soon find out what had happened.



But there was also something in the voice that made us hesitate. Our first reaction wasn't to look down in shame and say hello back, nor was it to rush out of the room. Instead, we stood still and stared over at the couch where Linn lay stretched out with her back towards us, completely motionless.



"I am the voice speaking from the teacher's throat when she sleeps," we heard from the couch.



The voice speaking now was quite different from how Linn usually sounded. Even though there was something vaguely familiar about it, the voice was deeper and gurgling. It was easy to believe it was coming from the throat and not the mouth, especially since we couldn't see Linn's mouth.



"Did you know John poops blood?"



The words came suddenly and unexpectedly. Simon and I exchanged glances, unable to hold back our laughter. We rushed out giggling from the staff room and pulled Jenny away from the room and away from the voice.



When it was time for snacks that afternoon, the three of us sat staring at Teacher Linn. She looked thoughtfully at us. If she had known that some kids had been in with her during nap time, but not who, our staring would have given us away several times over. But she gave no indication of understanding what had happened or what was going on in our little heads.



Only after snacks, later in the afternoon, Simon and I told Jenny what had happened – that we had heard a voice and that it might not have been Linn's own. And we told her what the voice had said about John pooping blood.



There was of course a John in the group of children. Even though our town was quite small, his family lived so far from mine that we had never met outside daycare. There was nothing remarkable about John, and no one had previously connected him with poop. But it didn't take long before one of us three who had been in the staff room – I no longer remember who – asked John if he pooped blood. The question wasn't mean-spirited; it might have been motivated by concern. But John reacted in a way that everyone should avoid – he started crying and ran off to hide. Among some of the children nearby, his reaction sparked exactly the feelings that are irresistible to potential bullies. It didn't take long before the words "poop" and "blood" started flying around whenever John was near. And it certainly didn't help when one of the more well-meaning teachers took the worst bullies aside and calmly explained that John really had been bleeding from his bottom and was feeling very upset about it. Children are fully capable of empathy. But most are also fully capable of following the group, especially when exclusion seems to be on the cards.



I never found out if John had a temporary problem with his intestines or if it was more serious. About a month after our first encounter with the voice in Teacher Linn's throat, he suddenly disappeared from daycare and never returned. Presumably, both the staff and his parents decided that the bullying had gone too far and couldn't be stopped without John changing daycare centers.



In the daycare entrance, the outer door was made of dark wood and was large. Beside it was an equally large frosted window facing the parking lot. For some reason, I remember when John and his father were last seen through that window one dark winter afternoon, like two distorted shadows in the light from the parking lot lamp. Just before that, John had stared at me with a strange mix of relief and hatred while he put on his overall for the last time. The two of us were alone with our respective parents in the entrance; it was the silence and the glance that suddenly brought on feelings of guilt. It was the first time I vaguely understood that even when you behave like everyone else, you can still be cruel.



Before John's departure from daycare, Simon, Jenny, and I had, of course, had several conversations with Linn in the staff room. Or with the voice that claimed to be someone other than Linn, even though it spoke from her throat.



The voice had rules. We were not allowed to tell anyone about it. If Linn was awake, we absolutely must not speak to it. Only two people at a time were allowed to visit the staff room. And it would tell us secrets, just as it had about John that first time.



The voice called itself Peter.



Don't ask me what we children thought about all this. I don't think children reflect much on how things really are. They tend to accept things as they are, not dig for explanations that aren't immediately presented to them. If there's a voice in the teacher's throat calling itself Peter and if it tells secrets, there are few children who would refrain from listening. Apart from the voice's dull rasping, there was nothing particularly frightening about it for the three of us who listened to it. Even though others sometimes suffered from the secrets, just as John had, we probably never saw the throat voice as particularly dangerous. I remember being worried sometimes when we went in to Linn and Peter, but that was also because we could always be caught by the other teachers. Mostly, we thought Peter was an exciting and fun secret, and it bound our gang closely together during the months we listened to it.



Peter told secrets about people we could come into contact with. Other children listened too, but so did the other teachers. Sometimes it told us things about other parents, and then we really felt like we were participating in something forbidden.



"When Teacher Karen was born, her mom died," the voice explained once. "That's why she's so bitter."

Peter often had to explain certain words and phenomena to us, like the word 'bitter' and what it means when women die in childbirth.



"Ulla's mom thinks their house is haunted. Ulla is very scared of the ghost and stays awake at night."



"Viktor's older brother is always sad and doesn't want to live."



The latter revelation caused another bullying campaign, this time against Viktor, but it stopped after a few days.





I have never learned if there was any truth behind all of Peter's claims. For instance, I know that Viktor's older brother still lives a seemingly normal life to this day. Perhaps the voice only told things that Linn herself knew or guessed. In some sense, it was probably Linn herself speaking with us. But I was and still am convinced that when awake and not speaking with Peter's voice, Miss Linn did not remember what happened in the staff room. She didn't confirm with the slightest movement that she knew anything. And the three of us who talked with Peter were strictly instructed not to mention the voice to Linn or anyone else in the whole world. It was a principle we respected, even into adulthood.



One Monday in early spring, Miss Linn did not come to daycare. Neither did Jenny. It wasn't until the afternoon that the staff gathered us children and gave us a sanitized version of what had happened. Miss Linn had become very ill on the Friday before the weekend, so a couple of doctors had come to take her away. Now they were going to help her get better, but because Linn was so old, she would probably retire and not have to work anymore. Now she would get to rest properly. But surely she would come and visit us in the future.



Regarding Jenny, she had happened to be the last one with Linn when she had gotten so sick that Friday. Jenny had been a little scared when Miss felt bad. Therefore, Jenny also needed to rest for a few days.



The truth was that we didn't see either Miss Linn or Jenny at daycare again. No one talked about where Linn was or how she was doing. It was said that Jenny had changed daycare, and then that her family had moved away.



My impression is that neither the parents nor the staff at the time wanted to make a big deal out of it. Today, maybe they would have set up a crisis group and had conversations with us. Moreover, our parents and teachers couldn't have known that there were two more of us involved in the months before Linn broke down. They simply assumed that Linn had had a breakdown limited to that Friday and that Jenny was its only witness. Perhaps they thought that taking action in the current situation would only cause unnecessary worry among the children.



Therefore, neither Simon nor I talked about Linn and the throat voice as long as we were children. The silence surrounding the events suited us quite well, because both of us were a little worried that we were somehow complicit. We exchanged glances, but we never really talked about it. In Jenny's absence and with Peter behind us, the two of us stopped playing during recess. I didn't hang out with Simon for many years and probably wouldn't have resumed contact if we hadn't ended up in the same high school class by chance.





It was through Simon and during high school that I finally learned that Miss Linn had ended up in a mental hospital. Or in psychiatric care, to use more contemporary terms. There she spent her final years, passing away at the age of 64 in the early 1990s. Simon was already an avid history buff and devoted his early steps into the archives to unraveling what had happened to Linn. Parts of the story naturally emerged when we separately talked with our parents in our teens, who knew more than they had conveyed to us when we were children. They knew that Linn had ended up in a mental hospital, and they knew she had suffered some kind of mental breakdown. But it wasn't until Simon delved into the archives, claiming he was conducting research and falsely promising not to disclose information about private individuals, that he learned more about Linn's fate. She had been involuntarily admitted after a deep and violent psychosis on that Friday in the mid-80s. Simon couldn't uncover many details about her treatment; those documents were still under strict confidentiality. But he could see that she never truly returned to any semblance of normalcy. At best, she remained passive and calm. Simon also found the information about her death.



A few weeks ago, Jenny contacted me via Facebook. She now lives in another part of the country and hadn't planned to reconnect with childhood acquaintances. However, after years of therapy, a new psychologist encouraged her to investigate what had actually happened at her daycare long ago and establish contact with someone she remembered.



The events of Jenny's last afternoon at daycare can be summarized quickly. She and Miss Linn were the only ones left. As Jenny waited for her father to pick her up, she made pearler bead designs at the table while Miss Linn worked in the kitchen. It took a while before Jenny noticed that the sound from the kitchen had ceased. She looked up and saw that Linn had become motionless with her back turned towards her. Jenny observed the teacher at first in confusion, then with growing interest. Finally, she asked:



Peter?

Miss Linn slowly turned around and stared at Jenny with wide-open eyes. It was now that Jenny would hear the throat voice for the first time while seeing Linn's mouth. Her mouth was closed. With undulating movements over her throat, a wheezing and guttural sound emerged:



You were not supposed to speak to me when she is awake!

Before Jenny could even blink, Linn desperately attacked her own throat with the knife she had been holding. Fortunately, it was a wooden butter knife, which meant the cut didn't harm her throat as severely as a sharp knife could have. But there was still bloodshed, and it frightened Jenny so deeply that she still experiences anxiety about what happened after thirty years. She remembers moving as if on autopilot, rushing towards the hallway and outerwear, ignoring her overall, and darting out through the large brown front door. Her father arrived with his car just minutes later, but until then, she hid in a snow cave in the courtyard. Linn did not come out. She was found by her father sitting at the table with blood dripping into a deep plate in front of her. She stared out the window with wide-open eyes, towards the snow hut. She was unresponsive and, according to information from the psychiatric ward, would not be communicative for several years.



Simon and I have often discussed who or what Peter was. Most likely, he was something akin to an alter personality that Miss Linn adopted, perhaps a shadow figure in her psyche capable of doing things she had forbidden herself. I'm not well-versed enough in psychology to describe in greater detail what I can only speculate.



Simon has continued to dig and found another relevant piece of information. Linn had a son named Peter. He died in the mid-sixties at roughly the same age we were when we encountered the throat voice. He had choked on a game ball that got stuck in his throat. I can't help but think about how the ball in his throat would have distorted his voice. How it would have made his voice hoarse and gurgling, a boy's voice almost unrecognizable.
