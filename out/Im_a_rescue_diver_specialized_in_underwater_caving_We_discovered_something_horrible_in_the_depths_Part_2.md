Part 2 - Current

“Do you actually think David’s still alive?” Maya asked as I strapped on a fresh tank of trimix gas. Though slightly heavier, it would allow us to reach far greater depths within the caves without running the risk of nitrogen narcosis. Not a lot of time had passed since our quick ascent back to the surface, and though it hardly sufficed for a second dive, we didn’t have time to waste. 

“I’m sorry, Maya, but I don’t think so,” I said. “I saw him get taken.” 

“By what?” 

“There was something else down there in the water. I couldn’t tell you what it was, and I’m not sure I even want the answer to that question.”

Maya turned to Andrew for confirmation. He strapped some tape around his knee, which ached after the rapid ascent. He’d wounded it years prior due to an air embolism caused by a rapid ascent. He was eavesdropping on our conversation. He noticed Maya’s trepidation in returning to the depths, worried more of us might perish in the effort. 

“It’ll be fine,” he said with an odd sense of confidence. “I wouldn’t ask you to do this unless I truly believed David was alive. Just let me go first. If something goes wrong down there, just turn back and leave. Don’t risk your life on my count.” 

Though the words felt genuine, they weren’t directed at me. There was still a prominent sense of resentment hanging in the air between the two of us. But, having no choice but to work with me, Andrew attached himself to the cable without further quarrel, and initiated a second descent into the depths below. 

Once he was out of sight, Maya got ready to follow, purposefully placing herself between Andrew and I in a futile attempt at preventing further conflict. I pulled her aside, not ready to let her descend unless she knew the exact risks involved in the mission. 

“You don’t have to do this, Maya,” I said. “I can do this alone with Andrew.” 

She shook her head. “David was my friend too. If he’s alive, I have to try.” 

“I understand, but this is going to be dangerous. I just need you to know that,” I explained, noting her use of past-tense in describing our lost crewman. 

“Of course I know. David wouldn’t have gotten lost if it wasn’t dangerous. I’m aware of the risks, Rick. Just let me go.” 

“I couldn’t stop you even if I tried,” I chuckled, trying to brighten the mood. “But Andrew is going first on this one, I just need you to watch out around him. If he tries going too deep again, don’t follow, it’s not worth the risk.” 

She gave me a gentle nod, before attaching herself to the cable. A second descent had started, and she kept eye contact with me up until the very moment she got enveloped in the darkness. I was the last in line, being spared the struggle of leadership following my nitrogen injury. Still, I followed the two of them down into the caves, not sure if any of us would ever return. 

Hit by the freezing temperature of the water once again, I let out a few gasps in shock as I prepared to submerge. I quickly inserted my mouthpiece, letting the trimix gas fill my lungs as I dove under. Attached to my belt, hung the end of the safety line we’d attached during our prior trip. Through it, we’d be able to send our video and audio feed in leu of wireless connections. Though direct contact remained impossible, at least the surface crew would know what happened to us should we fail to resurface. 

We followed the north-western passage again, quickly descending with the aid of the safety line, not needing to think twice about the paths we could take. But even though we’d been down there only an hour or so prior, the atmosphere within the tunnels had noticeably changed. The same, fleshy growths we’d encountered last time had reached much shallower parts of the cave. Worried, I pointed them out to Maya and Andrew, signaling as best I could not to touch them under any circumstances. They both nodded in agreement, and we carefully proceeded downwards into the pit. 

The narrow corridors preceding the open chamber were completely entangled in the growths, narrowing the lumen even further, as if the walls were progressively closing in on each other. It made it almost impossible to traverse without disturbing the vines, causing us to graze them on many occasions. Luckily, the smaller ones just retracted into the wall without prompting an attack. It appeared that only the thick, well-developed growths maintained the ability to harm. Even so, total avoidance remained our chosen strategy. 

Next, we delved into the open chamber. As before, the vast emptiness hung below us, a harrowing sight without a visible end. Transfixed, I felt shivers crawling down my spine, wondering what kind of nightmares existed in the depths. 

Checking my dive computer, I noted that we’d returned to two hundred feet below the surface. Had we still carried nitrox tanks, we’d have started to experience the advanced stages of nitrogen narcosis, but with trimix we still had quite a distance to go. For now, we remained safe. 

At the front of our pack floated Andrew, unimpressed and unbothered by the abyss below. His mind was fixated only on the strange light emerging from the hole in the wall. But at least this time, he waited for the rest of us to follow him deeper into the caves. He would frequently turn around and wave for us to hurry up and join him, never straying out of sight. Though I appreciated the sentiment, I wasn’t sure if it was a strategy of self-preservation or teamwork. 

But as I made my way towards the opening, something down in the depths caught my attention, just barely visible from the absolute deepest part of the chamber. There, several hundred feet below, I noticed several cold blue lights dangling in the water, almost dancing around each other in a captivating symphony. A loud rumble emerged from their origin like an ancient voice crying out into the void. I glanced at my team, wanting to wildly gesture and announce my discovery, but my body refused to cooperate, paralyzed by the distressing sight below. 

The more I stared, the more I felt my body succumb to an unknown force. I tensed up, frozen from a sense of dread that only increased the further I descended. While Maya and Andrew had headed straight for the cave, I fell behind, unable to drag my gaze away from the depths. I started to sink, so desperately trying to fight back. But instead of fearing my incoming demise, I felt oddly relaxed, almost welcoming death as a dear old friend. 

My depth gauge counted up, quickly reaching three-hundred feet. Three-hundred and ten… three-hundred and twenty. In mere minutes I’d be overcome with narcosis, leaving my body forever in the depths. But before reaching the point of no return, both Maya and Adnrew rushed over to pull me back to shallower parts. Breaking the line of sight with the lights, I finally snapped back to attention, trying to convey what I’d just seen with body language alone, but it was no use, and once I glanced back down, the lights quickly faded away. I had been lured in by their glow and would have diligently sunk to my death if not for the quick intervention from my team. 

Confused, I tried to refocus on the mission. I followed Andrew back towards the opening in the cave wall, ready to figure out if the place truly held an oxygen bubble that could have kept David and the young boy alive. Gone were the claustrophobic halls of the north-western passage. Instead, we followed the current into a large tunnel filled with beautiful, warm light. It emerged from plant like structures on the wall, stems extending with yellow bulbs at the end, each bulb covered in villi wriggling around the water, snatching up small particles. Like the vines on the wall, their touch resembled that of exposed muscle, clearly a part of the same eco-system as the flesh-vines. 

We hovered in the light, all in awe of its beauty. Though seemingly harmless, we tried our best to refrain from touching them, though an occasional graze still occurred without consequence. For a moment, we just existed in their world, experiencing a delightful sense of peace, as if the dangers of the depth no longer posed a threat. But with our residual pressure gauge slowly ticking down, we decided to keep moving, floating through the brightly lit hallway. 

The malignant vines still existed among the lights but appeared to be held back by the glowing bulbs. Only a few dared to stretch out into the tunnel’s lumen, looking for anything that might float by. 

In the distance, an odd reflection appeared on the cave ceiling, one we immediately recognized as the water’s surface. Against all odds, an air pocket had formed in the waterlogged caves, existing in almost impossible conditions. But whether the gases within were breathable was a question left unanswered. All we could do was pray as we proceeded with haste, clinging onto the slim possibility of David still being alive. 

But something happened as we neared the surface, a change almost imperceivable at first, as if the lights were starting to dim. Maya was the first to take note, turning around to assess the situation. Sure enough, the bulbs that had basked us in warmth only moments before, were starting to retract into the wall, causing the cave to progressively darken. And as they pulled back, the vines started to emerge en masse.

Within mere seconds, the cave opening had completely closed up by the sheer number of vines, blocking our only escape route. With each passing second, more of the bulbs folded in on themselves, allowing more vines to fill the lumen. Only then did we realize that the entire passage was about to close up. Either we breached the surface immediately, or we’d get entangled in the fleshbound organism. 

Panic rising within us, we quickly swam for the surface, which was still some distance away. All the while, the vines grew thicker and more numerous, moving towards us at impressive speeds. Andrew led the rush, glancing back at us to make sure we hadn’t fallen behind, but in doing so, he hadn’t noticed vines appearing directly in front of him. Too slow to react, he was grabbed by the appendage, which subsequently started wrapping itself around his shoulder. He pulled his knife out and swiftly slashed through the vine, to which the rest of them responded by sending dozens, all of which wrapped around Andrew.

I rushed over to him, pulling out my own knife, slashing at the flesh. But there were just too many of them, and before long, I too was trapped in the entanglement, immediately immobilized by the vines surprising strength. Maya remained as the sole free diver, but the vines were quickly reaching for her too. One of them managed to get ahold of her head, ripping out her mouthpiece in the process, which vanished in the chaos. Running out of air, Maya panicked as she desperately searched for it on the floor, but it was no use. Using the last of my mobility, I pointed to the surface, signaling for her to leave us behind and save herself. She locked eyes with me, shaking her head, and started pulling on the vines with her bare hands as they slowly tried to squeeze the life from us. It was futile. 

Sorrow filling her eyes, Maya was left with no choice but to rush for the surface, not knowing if the air above could even sustain human life. The tendrils wrapped tighter around us, some starting to stab through the suit, digging into my flesh. I wanted to scream, but I fought to keep my mouthpiece in place, lest I drown in the hellscape I’d voluntarily entered. 

But with the pressure building up around me, and the pain growing in intensity, I felt myself fading away. The last thing I saw before finally losing consciousness was Maya escaping up into the air pocket, the only one not ensnared. All which would follow, was eternal darkness.

\*\*\*

*It’s an odd sensation to feel your life slipping away. I had expected flashes to appear before my eyes, filled with highlights and mistakes from a life gone by. But instead, I was left with only a single thought occupying my fading mind: had I chosen the right way to die, or should I have spit out my mouthpiece and let the cold water take over my body?* 

*As a diver I was well acquainted with the concept of drowning, and as horrific as the idea might be, it’s a risk you take each and every time you dive beneath the ocean’s surface.* 

*You’re trapped underwater, knowing that the miniscule amount of air left in your lungs amounts to the very last breath you’ll ever take. Even should you welcome your premature death, your body fights with all of its instincts, down to the very last second. It refuses to let you inhale, tensing up to prevent water from entering your lungs. You start to notice the oxygen in your blood diminishing, replaced by an unrelenting feeling of sheer panic, as your muscles start to burn, and your mind turns hazy. Little by little, you fade into the darkness, left with only the knowledge that you’re about to die.* 

*Then, as you finally fade into an unconscious haven, the true nightmare begins. Your body falls back in pure instinct, making one last attempt at gasping for air, except there is none to be found. You open your mouth, pulling in the icy water encasing your body, knowing fully well that it’ll only hurt you more.* 

*This is the point where your experience might differ, as one in ten people react violently to the water entering their bodies. As soon as it hits your larynx, it closes up, refusing to let neither air nor water inside. Those are the people that suffocate, drowning without a single drop of water touching their lungs. The remaining nine in ten people suffer a different fate, allowing water to wash inside, causing an immense feeling of burning on every surface the water touches. A jolt of adrenaline is released, your body’s way of begging for you to keep fighting the inevitable death, and only then, are you finally allowed to slip away, sinking into unknown deaths as your body ceases to function.* 

*Burdened with this intimate knowledge of drowning. I had chosen to keep my mouthpiece, allowing my death to come from ensnarement. Had I made the right choice?* 

Death should have already taken hold of my, but yet my spirit remained firmly locked within my body. I opened my eyes, not sure how much time had passed, wondering how I hadn’t yet succumbed to my captor. The passage had long since fallen dark in leu of the glowing bulbs, leaving only the beam from my flashlight to light up the wall before me, where a dozen vines floated in the water, content to have caught its pray. 

A shadow appeared before the beam, one not recognizable by my tired eyes. It was only when it came right up against my face, before I realized it was Maya. At first, I thought I was dreaming, my dying mind hallucinating an impossible rescue. But there she hung, wearing a mouthpiece, cutting me free from the entanglement. Several of the vines had already dug themselves into my body, and though Maya tried to pull them out, they refused to budge. She could only cut them away, leaving their stems still engrained in my body. How she managed to extract me without waking up more of the appendages, I didn’t know, but she had managed to free both me and Andrew, getting both of us up into the air pocket above. 

“It’s safe, you can breathe here,” she said as she pulled out her mouthpiece. 

We had been pulled up into an air-filled chamber, covered in a much denser set of the same, fleshy growths. Maya stepped between them, making sure not to touch their hostile appendages. But without water surrounding them, they appeared more docile, making few attempts at latching onto us. 

“How did you?” I began to ask, not needing to finish the question before Maya gestured to an air-filled passage extending deeper into the air pocket. Before it lay pieces of diving equipment, identical to ours. It was David’s, but the man himself was nowhere to be seen. 

“It was fused with the vines, I had to cut it all out. I just took his mouthpiece and came back for you,” she explained. 

“What about David?” Andrew asked. 

Maya shook her head. “I don’t know. But it doesn’t matter anymore,” she said somberly. 

“What do you mean?” I asked. 

“It took me over an hour to get you loose. Even if we find David, we won’t have enough air to get back to the surface. We’re trapped,” she responded, her voice breaking towards the end of the sentence. 

I glanced at my residual pressure gauge, and sure enough, only a fourth of the gas remained. Andrew confirmed. None of us had the faintest chance of getting back to the surface. We were starting to realize, that though we’d survived the attack, we’d been tossed into a different kind of tomb altogether. 

“What about the cave?” Andrew asked. “David clearly made it up here, he might have followed the path to another exit.” 

Though hopeful, it wouldn’t be a likely solution. Seeing as we hadn’t died immediately from decompression, the air held the same atmospheric pressure as the water, which meant the air inside the cave had no connection to the air on the surface. The question was: where did the oxygen come from, and how long would it last? 

“I don’t know where it leads,” Maya said. “I was busy saving your sorry asses.” 

“An act I greatly appreciate, but-“ Andrew started, only to be cut off by a pained groan. 

“What’s wrong?” I asked. 

“The vines,” he said, inspecting his wounds. “Huh, that’s…” 

There were large holes covering his suit where the vines had penetrated. But despite the many wounds, there was a surprising lack of blood. Upon closer inspection, we realized that each hole still had pieces of the organism stuck inside, seeming to have fused with the surrounding skin. Checking my own body, I realized that I too, had patches of flesh that didn’t belong to me, fused to my skin. 

“What the hell is this shit?” I asked. 

Andrew didn’t respond, seemingly intrigued by thew injuries we’d sustained. 

“So, that’s how it is,” he muttered to himself. 

“What was that?” I asked but got no response. “We’re alive, let’s focus on that,” I said. 

Andrew just nodded, unbothered by the strange growths attached to his body. 

“So, do we have a plan?” he asked. 

“Not really,” Maya said. “But we also don’t have any options.”

“Except for following the cave,” I let out. 

We glanced at David’s abandoned diving equipment, wondering why he’d left it all behind. If the man had attempted to traverse the cave, the question remained how far it extended. Whatever the case, it was our best and only possibility, and though our chances of survival remained slim, we clung onto that hope for dear life. 

I detached the safety line from my suit, letting my camera transmit the last bit of footage before going dark. Though not improving our chances, I felt slightly better knowing the surface crew knew what had happened to us. At least our story would exist to be told, and it might prevent others from meeting the same tragic fate as us.
