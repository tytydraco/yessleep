On June 9, 1995, an anonymous caller reported a corpse in the basement of an abandoned apartment in Detroit, Michigan.

When officers responded to collect the remains, they immediately realized the body was profoundly deformed. Fearing radiation poisoning or a similarly dangerous cause, officials cordoned off the area and placed the body in special quarantine in the city morgue.

Despite the organization’s best efforts, word of the bizarre discovery spread through the department and beyond, alerting undercover Agency personnel who quickly took possession of the entity.

The inmate was dormant at the time of incarceration, which allowed for extensive study.

Unfortunately, studies were inconclusive. 

The inmate typically takes the form of a very large, misshapen head with twelve faces. For this reason, the Agency named the inmate the Dodecahedron.

It should be noted that eleven faces are in various stages of decay. Simply put, they appear dead. Only one face appears to be alive.

The inmate’s decomposed faces are of immense concern to Agency command. 

After nearly a decade of dormancy, the inmate awoke abruptly on June 8, 2004 and began to weep hysterically.

The mechanism through which it wept remains unknown. At the time, it was simply a large, malformed head with no other body structures designed for vocalization such as throat or lungs.

This did not stop it from crying or from speaking.

It ignored questions and prompts from personnel and proceeded to describe a primordial jungle in which it witnessed dinosaur eggs hatching and a cataclysm that destroyed this jungle. It described how sad it was, thinking of all the eggs that never hatched, all the “babies that never were,” and all the animals that died in a horrific torment they were incapable of understanding. It also grieved the fates of “bear cubs and wolf pups who died without ever knowing what it meant to be warm.” It lambasted itself for being unable to protect them.

After this conversation, the Dodecahedron became dormant again and did not reawaken until October 13, 2023 when it began exhibiting signs of immense distress. As personnel watched, the inmate’s form collapsed, then swelled. The mouth of its single living face opened so widely it split its head open, and a woman crawled out.

It should be noted that this woman is identical to the inmate’s only living face.

As she crawled out, the damaged head inverted in on itself and retracted, appearing to absorb into her.

When personnel asked the woman who she was, she answered, “I guess I’m God now, which means we’re all probably fucked.”

The woman refused to elaborate.

In fact, she did not speak again until December 13, 2024, when she participated in a meeting with the Agency’s specialized interviewer.

Based on the information gathered during the interview, the Agency believes this inmate suffers from religious delusions and schizoaffective disorder. She exhibits difficulty discerning the past from the present, and frequently describes prior events as if they are currently happening to her.

While she has clearly attached herself — or perhaps even melded herself — to an entity of extraordinary power, neither she nor the Dodecahedron are what one would consider a god. At this time, the Agency believes that the woman and her memories, illnesses, and delusions have “infected” the entity. Whether this infection is reversible is not known at this time. 

Based on past research as well as the information provided by the inmate, the threat posed by her existence is extremely high. As such, Administration has recommended her for destruction at the earliest opportunity. Termination is currently pending discovery of an appropriate method.

The interviewer would like to note her strong disagreement with Administration’s opinion.

Ever since I was a child, I have heard the voice of God. 

It isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Really, it’s not. It actually sucks. There’s no awe, no joy, no religious ecstasy. There is only terror tempered by pity and disgust because God is hideous, horrifying, and pathetic all at once.

God has twelve faces. *Its sides are many, Its angles aren’t few, God’s a dodecahedron, and what are you?* Twelve faces. Eleven are dead and rotting. The twelfth does nothing but cry. The only way to make it stop crying is to sing. So that’s what I did: I sang lullabies to God.

But not just any lullabies. *Hush Little Baby* and *Twinkle Twinkle Little Star* weren’t good enough for God. No, God required bespoke lullabies. So I wrote lullabies, then sang them. I’m a good songwriter, but a terrible singer. When averaged out, I suppose this means my lullabies are average. Adequate. They must have been, because whenever God heard one of my lullabies, It stopped crying for a little while.

I hear God all the time, but I only see It when I sleep. In these dreams God hovers, each of its twelve faces looking down on me while enormous tears drip down its twenty-four cheeks. Grief emanates from it—a crushing, suffocating, hysterical grief that makes me want to die. 

I have my own grief to deal with. At best, God’s grief is an unwelcome burden. At the worst, it’s a typhoon threatening to blast me off the broken bridge of my existence into the oblivion beneath. The burden of its grief feels heavier than death. Than life itself.

And I’m the only one who carries it.

My reward for bearing God’s grief is writing lullabies to shut it up.

That’s it.

God doesn’t help me in return. All God ever does is cry and expect me to soothe it like the infantile knot of cosmic heartbreak it is.

Not to say I don’t ask for help anyway. I do. God’s one functional face cries constantly. I pray to it almost as often. 

*Please help me find a better job, or at least be good enough to get a raise at the one I’ve got.*

*Please let there be overtime so I can catch up just a little on medical bills, or at least pay the rent on time.*

*Please keep me from getting too sick to work tomorrow*

*Please help me look strong so Mia doesn’t get scared*

*Please make Mia better. Heal her, cure her, sustain her, kill me if you have to and siphon my life force to her or whatever it is your twelve useless brains do, just please dear God will you do just this one thing and save her*

But God answers none of my prayers. God only cries. Meanwhile, my daughter dies.

She is only eight years old, but she is already at the end of her life.

I don’t know if my daughter understands that she’s dying, or if she understands what dying means. I hope not. But she cries a lot, almost as much as God.

That makes me think she knows. 

But the things she cries about are…odd. 

Last week, I caught her weeping into her frog blanket. “What’s wrong?” I asked. I made my voice calm even though my heart quivered like the gelatinous, oily tears that run down God’s faces in my dreams. 

“The dinosaurs,” Mia answered. Her face was wet, her hollow eyes swollen. “I was reading about them. When the comet came, the impact tore them apart.” Being torn apart is a potent fear of Mia’s; every time she comes out of anesthesia from her endless stream of surgeries, she cries that the doctors tore her apart and forgot to put her back together. Sometimes she says she can still feel the knives. That they’re still cutting, always cutting. “It happened really fast so some of the dinosaurs didn’t feel it, but some did. They would have been so scared. No one was there to help them. No one was there to tell them what was happening.” Her face, pale pointed sick thing that it was, crumpled as she buried it in her blanket. A cartoon frog smiled blandly from the fabric cascading out of her hands.

I didn’t know what to do. The only words I could think of were, *At least you know what’s happening to you*. But that was no consolation at all.

That night, I dreamed of primordial swamps and enormous trees that belonged to an earth so old they, and it, looked alien. God was there, hovering over the treetops like a hideous, Giger-esque spacecraft. And crying, of course. God is always crying. “I couldn’t save the cubs,” God wept. “I couldn’t help the dinosaurs. I sang the song that killed them all. I can’t save the wolves, and I can’t help your daughter. We will sing the song that kills them all.” 

“Then I hate you,” I screamed. Birds with leathery wings and great bony crests took off overhead. Startled bugs the size of my hand exploded around me in a droning tornado.

“I know.” God’s tears fell, fat and cold and hard as bullets. I ran around underneath God, trying to make one of the monstrous tears hit my head so I could die. But God was faster than me. Its tears hit the bugs and the trees, the ancient birds and the dinosaurs that watched me suspiciously from between the trees, but they did not hit me.

That just made me hate God more.

A few days after that dream, Mia wept about the Ice Age. “So many baby animals died in the Ice Age,” she cried, face as pale as the ancient tundra twelve thousand years past. “The moms couldn’t save them, no matter what they did. It was too cold.” Mia was always cold. No amount of blankets or bundling or roaring heaters could restore warmth to her hands. “They’re still buried in the ice, some of them. Baby bears and wolves. They never ever got to be warm. They died of cold, and now they’re so cold they can’t even rot. So they have to stay cold, forever and ever and ever.” 

*What are you trying to tell me?* I wanted to ask, but I knew she didn’t know. So I held her and told her the bears and wolves were in heaven with their moms and dads, warm and dry forever. 

That soothed Mia, but it just made me mad. Some heaven we’re headed for, dodging God’s skull-crushing tears for all eternity. I didn’t want Mia to suffer a heaven like that. I didn’t want dire wolf puppies and cave bear cubs to suffer a heaven like that, either.

I sang Mia one of the lullabies I wrote for God. I did that often. Maybe it was my imagination, but the melodies seemed to make her better for a little while.

The week after that was Thanksgiving. It was also the week that the doctors told me they could do nothing more for Mia. My daughter was going to die, and soon. They wanted her to stay in the hospital until she passed. It was the only way to keep her comfortable and free of pain.

And with her body withering and her circulatory system breaking down, it was the only way to keep her warm.

I don’t remember crying when they told me. I know I did, I just don’t remember. The only thing I remember is a sense of bitter, icy comfort because unlike the wolves, my daughter would be warm until the very end. The nurses promised me that:

My daughter would die warm.

You know, I still went Christmas shopping.

I dreaded the morning that I would wake up and know that Mia would never open the presents I bought her. I knew I wouldn’t be able to even touch them, let alone open them or donate them or throw them away. The sight would be paralyzing. Destructive, exquisitely painful, impossible. Looking at the gifts the morning after my daughter died would be the most devastating thing in the world.

Only that isn’t true. Buying Christmas presents that will never be opened isn’t the worst thing in the world. The worst thing in the world is not buying Christmas presents at all, because not buying them is the same as saying that my daughter is already dead. 

So I bought Mia presents she asked for and presents she didn’t, more than she’d ever play with and certainly more than I could afford. I wrapped each one and stacked them under the Christmas tree, and took pictures to show her every night when I came to visit her at the hospital. It always made her smile. For those smiles alone, the presents – the buying, the wrapping, the pain that would come when the child they belonged to was no longer in the world — were worth it. 

For three weeks I wrapped presents every morning, went to work every day, bought new presents every afternoon, spoke with my daughter every evening, and dreamed of God every night. I screamed, *Save my daughter. Save my baby. You stupid useless omnipotent bastard, stop crying and save my baby!*

God did not save my baby. God cried and crushed me with Its own sorrow until I couldn’t stand it anymore, until I finally gave in and sang lullabies to make it stop for just a little while. 

On December 17th, I visited Mia like always. She lay motionless in her hospital bed, skin grey as rotten snow with a hideous, bloodless yellow undertone. Her sunken eyes weren’t even halfway open. She still smiled when she saw me. The smile was small and ghastly, much too big for her papery face. She looked like a monster. A withered, long-dead thing excavated from a mile-deep sheet of primordial ice. 

Looking at her, I knew in the bottom of my heart and the marrow of my bones that this was the last time I would ever see her. 

“Mom,” she whispered. Her eyelids fluttered. The irises beneath looked dead and flat, sunken grey mirrors. “Where are you?”

“Right here.”

“I want to go home.”

“You’ll be home soon,” I lied.

Her eyelids fluttered again. “Mom.”

I leaned in, caressing her forehead. “I’m here.”

“Mommy.”

“Yes, baby, I’m here with you.”

“Mom, I’m so cold.”

A shrill choking sound startled me. Not until tears were streaming down my face heavy and cold as the tears of God, not until I was shaking like leaves in a tornado, not until Mia started to cry, not until the nurses escorted me away because I was distressing her, did I realize it was me.

“I have to stay,” I screamed. “I can’t leave her! She can’t die cold, *I can’t let her die cold*!”

They wrestled me out of the hospital and into the parking lot. I immediately marched back toward the doors, but they held me back and they threatened to call the police. So I stumbled to my car, crying so hard I couldn’t see. The streetlights morphed into trembling supernovas. The glitter of frost and night-muted car paint rolled across my vision like a shining tsunami. It took so long to find my car that I wondered if Mia had gone. If she’d died the moment I stumbled into the winter-dead tree or clipped the deathly-cold bed of a white truck. 

I finally saw my car and staggered over, only to trip over an icy curb. Frozen bark chips scraped my palms. Sharp stiff stems of dead flowers stabbed my knees. Tears fell, briefly warm and then exquisitely cold. I curled up and sobbed.

So did God. 

Its sobs began as a whistling moan from far away, the wordless cry of something insane, growing closer and closer.

But there was something different about it.

It wasn’t wailing in sorrow.

It was screaming in fear.

As the scream swelled, I felt a bone-deep horror, terror beyond comprehension, horror that eclipsed everything except the loss of my daughter.

When I thought my ears would burst, God sobbed and said, “Please help me. Sing for me. Singing keeps them out.”

From sheer force of habit I began to sing, sobbing through the syllables, keening and breaking on the notes. 

It whimpered, then quieted.

Then it screamed again. 

I screamed back at it, which made it shriek so loudly that my windshield shattered and car alarms went off.

Suddenly, the screaming cut off.

There was silence.

And then, for the first time, God began to laugh.

My skin erupted into gooseflesh. The primal part of my brain screamed at me to run but also to hide, inciting an impulse to drop and burrow desperately through the floor of the car into the asphalt beneath, clawing my way to safety even though I was frozen in terror, bones and muscle fighting paralysis like a deer in headlights. 

Then God said, “God can’t save your daughter, but I can.” 

He recited an address, and vanished.

I didn’t even think. What was there to think about? Frozen cubs and dying wolves? Dinosaurs and my daughter’s sunken eyes?

The address was a brownstone in the kind of neighborhood that people like me are forcefully removed from. I knocked on the door anyway, expecting to get shot or set on by Dobermans.

Instead the door opened by a man with the saddest eyes I have ever seen. “Can I help you?” he said quietly.

I said the first thing that sprang to mind: “God told me to come here.”

“How many faces does God have?”

“Twelve,” I said. “But eleven are dead.”

He let me in.

The living room was narrow but deep, dominated by a roaring fireplace and decorated in all dark red and darker wood.

“Wait here.” The sad-eyed man indicated an overstuffed chaise lounge. “I’ll be back shortly.”

I fidgeted, heart pounding as I tried and failed to take in the sheer grandeur of the place.

A few minutes later, the sad-eyed man returned with another man in a crisp suit. “We can save your daughter,” the sad-eyed man told me. “But you must do exactly as you are told.”

“What am I being told?”

He pushed the young man forward. “Take him to the hospital, directly to your daughter’s room.” 

I was angry — why send me out here only to send me back out again? — but what the hell. Not like I had anything better to do.

As we drove off to the hospital, shivering as the wind cut through my broken windshield, I asked him, “What’s your name?”

“Aurelien.”

It took a little bit of work and a lot of dodging nurses, but I got us both into Mia’s room. 

Without a word, Aurelien took a seat at her bedside, took her hands, and began to sing.

I recognized the melody as one of the lullabies I’d written just for God. 

By the end of it, Mia was wide awake.

And for the first time in weeks, there was color in her face.

That’s when the nurses finally discovered our intrusion and chased us out. I didn’t want to go, but Aurelien insisted we return. When I argued, he said, “I’ve done my part. Now it’s time for you to learn yours.”

I drove us back to the brownstone. The sad-eyed man let us in.

The living room was no longer empty. An older man perched smartly on the chaise lounge, waiting. He was the embodiment of elegance. Tall and almost (but not quite) cadaverously lean and impeccably dressed. He smiled when he saw me.

That smile made me think of dinosaurs in unimaginable pain and terror, of wolves dying without ever knowing warmth.

“My name is Mr. Mellow,” he told me. “I am going to share a great deal of information with you in a very short amount of time. You will have questions. Wait until I am finished before you ask.”

The sad-eyed man gave me a cup of tea as Mr. Mellow began:

“Creation began with a song, and it will end with one. The songs between the beginning and the end shape the future and the past, our world and our reality. There are twelve song-makers altogether. One for each face of the Dodecahedron — what you call God. Each face corresponds to a hierophant — a song-maker. The hierophant bears the responsibility and the destiny to create a new song. Only one hierophant is alive at a time, but a hierophant is not alive all of the time. It’s an inexpressibly rare privilege to live alongside a Hierophant. In all of history, there have been only eleven. You are the twelfth and the last. I have been waiting for you an extraordinarily long time.”

Mr. Mellow was right about one thing: I had about a billion questions, not least of which was *What does this have to do with my kid?*

“A hierophant cannot work alone. They must always have a partner. Think of the hierophant as a songwriter, and think of the partner as a singer. Together, your responsibility is to create a new song. To foster creation, build the world, and when necessary, to change its course. All except the very last hierophant.”

I waited, even though it was physically painful.

“The last hierophant is destined to write the song that will end creation. You are the last. But here’s the thing.” That smile again, wide and shining. “We don’t want creation to end just yet.”

“Who’s we?”

“As far as you’re concerned, we are everyone. Even you. We need you. You need you.”

“For what?”

While the sad-eyed man looked on, Mr. Mellow explained that a hierophant can twist a song, change it, even corrupt it to their own ends — or any ends at all. “You can turn the tides of war and finance, allow powers to rise and fall. You control the columns that hold up the world and everything underneath it because everything is made music, and you control the music. Anything you could ever dream of is in your power.”

“If that’s true, what’s stopping me from walking out of here and talking God into taking over the world all by myself?”

“Because you can’t do it alone. You need a singer. All the singers are mine.”

This sounded far more ominous than it had any right to.

“And even if you found your own singer, you will not create. You will only destroy, because that is why you were born. In the absence of instruction, we are all slaves to instincts. You are certainly no exception, and your instinct is destruction. But I can provide the instruction. I can teach you to create. Together, we will make sure you never write the song that ends creation.” 

I wondered if this is why God always cried. Why It always said It can’t save us or even help us. Because of me. I’m Its twelfth face. Together, we’re destruction. Together, we end everything.

“Sir, how do I know this isn’t a dream?”

“It isn’t a dream for me,” he answered. “Or for Aurelien, or for Landry.” He indicated the sad-eyed man. “But with the right training, it’s a dream for you. One that you control. We are all at your mercy.”

“This sounds a lot like the psychotic break I had in high school.”

“You didn’t break. You simply saw the columns tremble.”

“How would you know?”

“Because you are a hierophant, and I know hierophants.” 

I had so many questions, and no idea where to begin.

“I will give you two weeks with your daughter. Make sure Aurelien is on her list of approved visitors. Without proximity, he will not be able to help her. If after two weeks you have any doubts, we can discuss them and come to new terms. Otherwise, that is when your work begins. And do understand — what I am doing for you can be undone.”

To cut to the chase, Mia got better.

Aurelien visited her every day. She improved at a phenomenal rate, and was home in time for Christmas. She opened all her presents. It was literally a miracle.

Two weeks later, I returned to the brownstone. Mr. Mellow was waiting for me. Landry stood at his right, Aurelien at his left.

He smiled his smile of death and ice. “Are you ready to learn?”

“Of course.” This was a lie. I had no idea what I was learning, let alone how to be ready for it.

But my daughter was alive, and that was all that mattered.

Mr. Mellow smiled. “Aurelien will be your first teacher.”

And just like that, we began.

I guess we started small, although it is difficult to describe what we did as *small*.

Aurelien would say, *Think about a flower sprouting from the concrete* or *Imagine a storm gathering on a clear day*. *What does it look like? How does it taste? How does it feel?*

Once I had distilled these images to perfect clarity in my mind’s eye, he told me to write a song. No words, just a melody. Something that sounded how my thoughts felt.

I would write the song, and he would sing it.

It always worked.

When he sang what I wrote, the thoughts — the emotions, the impressions, the intention behind those melodies — became reality. 

It was beautiful and terrifying, glorious yet profoundly sickening. Ultimate power, expressed in the smallest of ways but all the lovelier for it.

It was beyond my widest dreams. My daughter was better, we were together in a mansion, I was living an admittedly bizarre but highly gratifying power fantasy, and for the first time in my life everything felt perfect.

Everything except Aurelien.

I noticed from the beginning that he was doing everything he could to get closer to me. It frightened me. But I didn’t do anything. What could I have done? He was keeping Mia alive.

But after one practice — one where we grew a fruit tree from a battered tray in the kitchen — the lingering look he gave me was too much, so I went to Mr. Mellow.

He only smiled. “Imagine a billionaire walks into a party. Other than the fact that he is powerful, no one at this party knows anything about him. Not the host, not the guests, not the entertainment, not the serving staff. But they know he can give them anything, so of course they all want everything. They will do and give anything to make that happen. You are the billionaire in this equation. Aurelien is an indentured idiot smitten by the presence of, and proximity to, the person who can make or break him. Do you expect someone like him to behave otherwise?”

I couldn’t answer.

“He won’t be the only one. He will be far from the worst. Knowing him, he will probably be the best. Learn from him. Idiot or not, he’s good for learning. Once you’ve learned, cast him aside. I expect you to do so. I require you to do so. But in the meantime, use him. Learn.”

I learned.

And before long, those little melodies began to grow.

That’s when darkness crept in. Threads of destruction struggling to weave themselves together.

Aurelien always caught it immediately, and stopped me gently. “Think of happiness,” he always said. “Of joy. Never sadness, and never devastation. When you feel those things, focus elsewhere. No matter what it takes.”

It was easy to focus elsewhere with him. 

Whenever destruction sent a darting tendril through my song, we cut it off by creating other things. Fresh sunshine and cold starlight, veils of night clouds lit to brilliant silver, soft rainfall and new growth. It was so beautiful that even Landry smiled while he watched us.

One day I realized that for the first time in my life, the Dodecahedron hadn’t wept in weeks.

That terrified me, but Aurelien said I had no need to worry. “You can summon It to see. Pretend you’re praying to God with all your might, then write a song that feels like prayer.”

I wrote the prayer-song, and he sang it for me.

The Dodecahedron shimmered gently into being, silent and still and perfectly serene. Eleven dead faces and one living face that looked just like mine.

When he stopped singing, It shimmered away like stars fading at dawn.

“Why is it like that?” I asked. “Why is it calm?”

“I don’t know,” he answered. “But I think it’s a good thing.”

I was still afraid. How could I not be? For all of my life, the Dodecahedron was only fear and grief and pain. This wasn’t just a change; it was a reversal of everything I had ever known.

But when I remembered its silence and the way it exuded peace, I found that I couldn’t disagree with Aurelien. 

We continued to work together. I learned from him, and eventually he began to learn from me. Through it all, he continued to sing to my daughter. Soon it was as though she’d never even been sick.

One evening, as he and I were experimenting with the structure needed to manipulate and layer light, Mr. Mellow came and sent him away. 

“It’s time you chose your partner,” he told me. “Come.”

He led me upstairs to his study, although the word didn’t really do it justice. It was beautiful and grand and larger than even the living room.

Arranged along the tapestried wall was a line of prospects.

What followed can only be described as an audition.

I tried to pay attention. But no matter who stood in front of me, there was only face I could see. No matter who sang for me, there was only one voice I wanted to hear.

When they were done, Mr. Mellow sent them away. Then he sat me down. “Which one?”

“None of them,” I said. “I want Aurelien.” 

He smiled, all ice and death. “No.”

“Why not?”

“He will continue to keep your daughter healthy. I will make sure of it.”

“Why can’t I have him?”

“Because I need him.”

“For what?”

“Each singer has a different speciality. Aurelien in particular is one of a kind. His speciality — as you know — is life. He keeps me alive, just as he does your daughter. I am rather more difficult to maintain than your daughter. Without him, I would no longer be. So he’s mine.” He leaned back. “Choose any of the others. You have until tomorrow to make your decision. Good night.”

I couldn’t sleep. I kept thinking of Mia’s dinosaurs and wolf puppies. Things that died in terror. Things that died without ever knowing warmth.

For reasons I couldn’t quite identify, I wasn’t surprised when Aurelien knocked on my door several hours later.

He was drunk. I could smell it on him. “I can make you happy,” he said. “Just write a song. You’ll never know the difference. You won’t even have to remember you wrote it if you don’t want to.”

“I don’t need to write one,” I said, gently.

“Then why not me?”

I explained what Mr. Mellow told me, which made Aurelien laugh until he threw up. After that, he cried. “He’ll never let me go,” he told me. “I’d rather die. Help me die.” 

I didn’t help him die. I helped him into bed, then went back to Mr. Mellow.

He was awake. I wasn’t surprised about that, either. I don’t think Mr. Mellow ever sleeps.

He denied me immediately. “Without Aurelien, I will become less than I am. With Aurelien, you will become more than you are. Neither is acceptable. Even if that were not the case, I need him. My need supersedes any desire of yours, and certainly of his. Leave.”

I turned to go.

“And if you ever feel the urge to ask this again, remember: Anything I give you can be taken away.”

“I understand,” I said.

“For your daughter’s sake, I hope you do.”

I went back to my room, trying to figure out what to say and how to say it.

But when I got to my room, the bed was empty and my window was open.

When I looked out, I saw Aurelien down below, broken and bleeding, golden hair shining under the street light.

As though carried on a wind from far away, I heard the familiar sound of the Dodecahedron screaming.

When he found out, Mr. Mellow raged. More than raged. Under any other circumstances, I would have cowered or even run. But I didn’t have room to fear him.

Aurelien was one of a kind. He’d told me so. And if that was true, there was no one to sing my daughter’s song.

During a break in Mr. Mellow’s tantrum, I asked, “What will happen to my daughter?”

“If you do as your told,” he growled, “I will do everything in my power to find someone like him.”

I did what I was told.

But Mr. Mellow didn’t find anyone else. 

He aged rapidly. In a month he aged twenty years.

And Mia withered too.

Through it all, the Dodecahedron wept. Nothing I sang soothed it now.

But my songs did other things.

Even in Aurelien’s absence, the music we made created change. As Mellow had promised, the tides of war, politics, finance, even art began to turn in ways Mr. Mellow wanted.

But then they began to turn in ways he did not because as my daughter faded, threads of destruction crept into my music. Soon, the partner Mr. Mellow assigned to me refused to sing anything I wrote for fear. 

When that partner left, God whispered to me, “The end is meant to be. The columns are trembling. Let them fall.”

When Mia died, I gave in and wrote the song that ends everything.

Then I marched in to Mr. Mellow’s study and sang it.

The walls cracked, and Mr. Mellow screamed in pain. Landry ran, crying.

But nothing ended, not even of Mr. Mellow. This is because I’m only half of a whole. Because I’m a hierophant, and a hierophant needs a partner.

As Mr. Mellow climbed to his feet, snarling, I had an idea.

I remembered the prayer song, the one that summoned the Dodecahedron on the day it emanated peace.

Then I sang that prayer.

The Dodecahedron erupted into being. Its dead faces sang the prayer, too.

The voices were hideous and maddeningly beautiful. I was splitting apart along seams I didn’t know I had. Like the voices of the dead faces had created seams specifically to rip them open seconds later.

Mr. Mellow fell to his knees. His eyes and ears began to bleed.

Then he laughed.

He clambered to his feet, laughing fit to burst, and began to dance.

Landry bolted. I was glad to see him escape. I hope his eyes aren’t sad anymore.

As the dead voices tore my seams open, I fell to my knees, too. But my ears didn’t bleed, or my eyes.

God opened his mouths and swallowed me into a soft night. I was free of pain and awareness. Free of heart and mind. Free of self. Freed into the gentle dark.

I don’t know how long I was there. I want to go back.

When I finally woke up, God was crying.

God always cries.

It begged me to let go, to understand that some things cannot be saved, that sometimes nothing can be saved. That the ending is the goal, because that which does not end becomes corruption.

It told me to sing my song.

But when I thought of the song, I thought of Aurelien. I thought of bear cubs and old pups and their parents starving on the ice. Of things that lived and died without ever knowing what it means to be warm. I thought of Aurelien. Above all, I thought of my daughter.

And I thought of all the other daughters who will die if I sing.

And as I thought of them, someone came to me. Someone here. I think you probably know who.

He told me Aurelien is alive, and my daughter too. He said they live in a bright city where everyone sings.

He said if I promise to forget my song, he’ll let me join them.

I don’t know if he’s telling the truth any more than I knew whether Mr. Mellow was telling the truth.

But I’m going to find out.

Creation began with a song, and it will still end with one.

Just not with mine.
