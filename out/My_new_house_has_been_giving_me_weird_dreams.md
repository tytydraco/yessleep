before we start, I wanted to mention that I am still sure that this is a dream. But a dream I actually had. 

 

I always knew there was something weird about my new house. It had been on the market for months, with no one seeming to want to buy it, despite its prime location and cheap price. But I figured that was just because of the bad paint job and overgrown garden. I'm handy with a paintbrush and a lawnmower, so I took the plunge and bought the place.

The house was great, but there was one thing that really weirded me out: the basement. It was a typical basement, with old boxes of junk and cobwebs everywhere, but there was one door that stood out. It was old and made of thick, dark wood, with a rusted lock that looked like it hadn't been opened in years.

I asked the previous owner about it, but they just shrugged and said they had never been down there. I was too curious to leave it alone, so I grabbed a crowbar and forced the lock open.

Inside, I found a room unlike anything I had ever seen before. It was small and dimly lit, with strange symbols etched into the walls and floor. There was a feeling of coldness and dread that permeated the air, and I could hear a faint humming sound coming from somewhere deep within the room.

I tried to leave, but the door had somehow locked itself behind me. I was trapped.

As I looked around the room, I noticed that the symbols on the walls were starting to glow, and the humming sound was getting louder. Suddenly, the ground beneath me shook, and I felt like I was falling through a hole in reality.

When I opened my eyes, I was in a different place altogether. The air was thick and heavy, and the ground was slick with an unknown substance. I could see strange shapes moving in the darkness around me, but I couldn't make out what they were.

I stumbled through the darkness, calling out for help, but my voice only echoed back at me. The shapes began to get closer, and I could hear their whispered voices, speaking in a language I couldn't understand.

That's when I woke up. I was back in my own basement, lying on the floor. The door was still locked, and the symbols had faded away. It felt like a dream, but the fear and unease lingered long after I had woken up.

I haven't been back to the basement since, but the experience still haunts me. I've tried to do some research on the symbols and the strange place I found myself in, but I can't find anything that matches my experience. It's like I stumbled into some other dimension, or a place that shouldn't exist.

The worst part is that sometimes, when I'm alone at night, I swear I can hear the faint humming sound in the back of my mind. And sometimes, I'll see strange shadows moving in the corners of my vision, like the shapes from the otherworldly place I stumbled into.

I don't know what's happening to me, but I can't shake the feeling that something terrible is coming. I've started sleeping with a knife under my pillow, just in case I have to defend myself from whatever may come through that mysterious door in my basement.
