But something killed that future, and I’m next.

Dozen Minus is the convergence point for every elite physicist and computer scientist on the planet. It is advantageous to be qualified in both disciplines, given that the agency prides excellence above all things. As a result, I flourished. After years of studying, I became a qualified physicist and a qualified computer scientist. And yet, during my studies, I scarcely learnt anything.

At Dozen Minus, on the other hand, I unearthed complex truths beyond even the most involuted university course. Truths better left buried.

Things we aren’t meant to know about reality.

This unofficial organisation accepts nothing less than perfection. We must exceed physically, mentally, and even spiritually. Long ago, I doubted the existence of a plane beyond the tactile realm. Today, however, I saw something which left me without a shred of scepticism.

I should’ve feared the brutality of Dozen Minus. Our monstrous overlords value mankind’s progression above mankind *itself*. They don’t care about you. They don’t even care about the geniuses who make their dreams happen. We are expendable. Commodities measured by profitability. Nothing more, and nothing less.

Over the years, I turned a blind eye to this organisation’s transgressions. *How does one demand accountability of the most powerful agency on Earth?* That thought always quelled the nightmares. I thought of space missions gone awry. Whistleblowers smothered in the night. Inventions that killed their creators.

I fall into the final category. The latest casualty that this company has left in its wake. I should’ve resisted this oppressive organisation sooner. Karma has come for me.

Before its connection to a strange sitcom, the Big Bang referred solely to reality's conception – the universe’s birth from a springboard of *astronomical* energy density. In the public sphere of science, there is so little that humans know about the universe. In the hidden laboratories of Dozen Minus, however, there is very little that we *don’t* know about the universe.

Alongside many employees of this sprawling company, I studied the science of the universe's formation – I studied so fastidiously, in fact, that I felt confident of my ability to build the impossible.

A replica of our universe.

Marrying programming fluency with my knowledge of the universe’s physical properties, I successfully recreated our universe in a digital simulation. It took ten painful years. And it wasn’t about building every last atom. I only needed to spark an identical Big Bang. Cause and effect did the rest.

The implications of this simulation should not be understated. Think about what I just claimed. I have proven the philosophical doctrine of Determinism – all events have an external cause, and there is no free will. Not for *us*, at least.

Yesterday morning, after a decade of laborious coding, I finished the programme. I struggled to convince myself of that truth, but the numbers didn’t lie. All I had to do was start the simulation.

Hunched over my desk in crippling anticipation, I moved the cursor over the ‘Run’ button. My twitching right hand hovered over the mouse as I nervously eyed the screen.

Part of me knew that I shouldn’t click. It was a metaphysical taboo. It felt like playing God. But adrenaline surged through my finger, and I selected ‘Run’.

My monitor revealed a blinding burst of light. Every pixel on my screen caught fire, and the rate of growth, even at a slow simulation speed, was unfathomably fast. I watched my simulation – my *creation* – construct matter that identically matched our own reality. As the programme ran at an incredible pace, countless known galaxies grew.

It was our universe. There was no denying it. And there were untold oceans of space to explore, but I couldn’t help coming back to our own. I'm human. We are, even at our strongest, such weak-willed things. I know it not to be so, but I view our luscious home planet as the centre of everything. And, on that exhilarating morning, I couldn’t help but eagerly focus on the formation of the Milky Way.

I sped through the simulation, and exuberant tears collected in my eyes. The Solar System emerged in a display of indescribable splendour. Board members had been *insistent* on the inclusion of a visual component to my simulation. I’d been neutral to the idea. However, as I watched Earth morph from an inhospitable rock into the home of a thriving ecosystem, I realised that management finally got something right.

*No.* ***You*** *got something right, Cooper,* I reminded myself.

“It is time,” Stefan Blom announced.

The Swedish-born director of Dozen Minus is a figure that few ever see – or ever meet, for that matter. He is an abrasive man. A stoic statue who might've been respected if it weren’t for his lack of empathy. In the name of advancement, he would scorch every man, woman, and child on Earth.

And if nobody stops him, that might well be your fate.

Yesterday morning, on the day of my simulation’s completion, the menacing director entered my office with every member of the board. He loomed behind my desk chair, casting a fearsome shadow over my desk.

“Show me,” He whispered.

The man watched the conception of the universe over my shoulder. Twelve people were crammed into my box-shaped workspace. I have never felt so observed. I tried to conceal the free-willed bead of sweat trickling down my temple – or causally-determined bead of sweat, should I say?

“Very good. But I need to see *Earth*, Mr Adler,” The director coldly instructed.

I nervously nodded, guiding the view away from galaxy formations. I typed nervously, and the simulation shifted its attention to our blue and green speck in the centre of the Solar System.

“Good. What is this point on the timeline?” Director Blom asked.

“13.7 billion years from the Big Bang,” I answered. “We’re seeing the present day. We’re seeing–”

“– *mankind*,” The director finished my sentence.

Viewing the planet from an aerial perspective of fifty feet, we witnessed the beginnings of humanity. Of course, at the simulation speed I’d chosen, history passed in a flicker. Neanderthals quickly turned to ash, and Homo Sapiens seized the world’s reigns.

My office was filled with twelve bulging sets of dilated pupils – a gaggle of fidgety, intoxicated onlookers, and I was one of them.

“Oh my word…” The co-director whispered.

“It’s beautiful!” A woman shrieked, laughing victoriously.

We witnessed historical figures follow the formula of history that we had come to know. Every event in human history was the same. It’s beautiful, but it’s also a slightly sickening truth to swallow. We truly are pre-determined creatures. Everything that you say, do, or think has been enacted by the very creation of the universe itself. I’m not sure what to make of that horror. The notion of being a puppet.

“Leave the room,” Director Blom suddenly ordered.

The members of the board sulked as they waddled out of my office, realising they were about to miss the thing that had really drawn them there. I stood, preparing to follow them.

“Not you, Collin,” He said.

“Cooper...” I quietly corrected.

The director leaned over and whispered. “Show me events beyond the present.”

The screen was the only light source in the room, and its vibrant, ever-changing imagery reflected in the man’s eyes – eyes which were distended by some ravenous urge within his blackened brain. Director Blom was a cruel man. And he was hungering for the future in a way that frightened me.

What would he do if he could wield such power?

I wouldn't hand him the keys to the kingdom.

“Well, the programme needs time to…  process new data,” I lied, whilst craftily pausing the simulation. “The universe’s future expansion has not been… erm… rendered.”

The director’s mood lowered in a way that weighted the entire room.

“How long?” The man growled.

“It’ll be an overnight process,” I said.

Director Blom knew nothing about science or technology. He was a sociopath appointed as Dozen Minus’ director by government officials – the type of man that played by their rules. A brute who could keep us in line. But I was counting on his primitive brain to sell my tall tale. Blom had the power to end me without anybody noticing, but he wasn’t as wise as he believed himself to be.

“Tomorrow morning. 9am,” He whispered hauntingly. “I’ll be ready for the future, Mr Allen. And it’ll be ready for me.”

After storming out of the room, the director slammed the door. I thanked my blessings that he hadn’t snapped my neck like an obstructive twig. Sitting in my empty office, I gladly returned to the welcoming blanket of solitude.

*Great. But you lied. What’s your plan for tomorrow?* My inner voice asked.

I didn’t have a plan. My mind was focused only on one thing. *The future*. Like the director, I’m only human. Not quite as malicious, but still flawed. *Deeply* flawed. And though I did not share Stefan Blom’s awful aspiration of grandeur, I still craved knowledge. I wanted to see what awaited humanity.

I pressed ‘Run’. And I’ll tell you what I saw, but it doesn’t matter now.

Wars ravaged our world. Scraps for dwindling resources. The near-annihilation of our species lessened Earth’s burden, however – and, given time, that breathing room paved the way for mankind’s resurgence. It allowed the cycle to repeat itself. As we always do, humans started afresh. We blossomed. We developed. Our ambition exceeded our limits. The cycle of self-destruction repeated tirelessly. Civilisation collapsed, and a new one rose in its place. With each new boom, slight advancements were made. New technological marvels. New astounding discoveries. Of course, many old discoveries were forgotten.

As I mentioned, none of this matters. Well, I know it matters to you – it certainly left me teary-eyed.

But then came the Ripple.

Midway through the thousandth simulated future war, the imagery on my monitor corrugated. A transparent wave of motion creased the colours on the screen – as if a heatwave of immeasurable enormity were sweeping across the simulation of Earth. However, none of the programme’s data indicated any *simulated* events. And mankind remained oblivious to the rippling anomaly which spanned my screen.

It wasn't part of the simulation. It was detached from my digital universe.

“What *are* you?” I muttered in fascination.

As if responding, *the ripple slowed*.

I gawped at the wrinkling pixels which gradually formed an all-consuming sea of darkness. I tried to interact with the simulation, but I found that I could no longer control it. Without any input from me, it rewound to the present day.

And then the newly-opaque waves began to slice through the pixelated matter of my simulation. Horrifyingly, my simulated humans remained nonchalant as the megatsunami of biblical reckoning approached. *They don’t see it*, I realised. Their tiny bodies were unceremoniously shredded by the tidal wave. The black rippling began to appear more like *fingers* – a hand laboriously tearing stubbornly-elasticated strips of human meat to shreds.

In the midst of the darkness, I managed to locate my simulated self. He was standing on the street before Dozen Minus’ headquarters. Eyeing the approaching storm. He hopped into his car and drove away, but he could not outrun the blackness.

My simulated universe eventually became an endless void. Not a speck of light remained in sight. It  ended at four in the morning on the second of March.

I looked at my real-life watch. It was already two in the morning. With fingers clutching the sides of my head, I watched the wave continue to dance with a dreadfully serene rhythm. Even after the destruction of everything, it lived. Something lived in that nothingness. And it seemed to be relishing in the prospect of my torture.

“What… are you…?” I finally repeated in a trembling whisper.

This time, upon hearing my question, the ripple did not slow – it started to quicken. Waves of absence created a shape of substance. A definable object. Something the unknown entity deemed more comprehensible to a puny primate.

A mouth. And the lips parted to reveal only *deeper* darkness.

“I am your future,” An unfeeling voice explained. “But not theirs.”

My mind unravelled at the horror of meeting a force beyond belief. The Ripple was an impossibility. A question, for once in my life, that I could not answer.

“What do you mean…?” I breathlessly asked.

The speaking lips, like a parting ocean, sent ripples of blackness across the screen.

“You have seen what should not be seen,” The voice replied.

“I…” I gasped, voice fearfully cracking. “I didn’t change– I won’t change anything. I just wanted to… see.”

“You *could* not change anything,” The voice whispered. “All things have been written… and re-written.”

“Please...” I begged.

“There is no pleading,” The voice stated. “There is only the natural course. The one that shall continue without you.”

Before I could utter another word, the Ripple vanished. And when I tried to engage with the simulation, I was left with nothing but an error code. There was no time to contemplate what that meant.

A thunderous clap sounded outside – the roar of reality’s fabric tearing. I knew that to be so before I even left my desk. To be sure, nonetheless, I rose from my chair and eyed the office window.

Through the glass pane, I saw the dizzying lights of the city. But beyond that final vestige of life, a growing groove crumpled the night sky. On the horizon, skyscrapers plunged into a gluttonous abyss. It was not the death of artificial light – it was the death of matter. The buildings were being torn apart by the Ripple. No, not torn apart. Sent somewhere new.

You’re all being sent somewhere new.

Not me. My fate is to die with this abandoned strand of reality. Left to be slaughtered in a branch of reality that has been sullied by my prophetic insight. After watching my simulated self die, I fear that the shredding might not be painless for me.

I only wish I’d been given the opportunity to undo my mistake. That’s what I do best. I fix things. But I am nothing in the face of such petrifying power.

An hour ago, I raced out of the Dozen Minus headquarters. I expected to see empty streets. A post-apocalyptic wasteland. Instead, more terrifyingly than that, the world was continuing as normal. Cars filled the streets. People stumbled out of nightclubs. And, when I checked my phone, I saw no reports of the world’s demise. Yet, with my own eyes, I could see the end approaching – and it craved *my* end.

I still hope so, anyway. The alternative to death might be even more dreadful.

“Excuse me!” I yelled, running towards a crowded street corner. “Do you see that?”

A group of drunken ravers turned to face me – a distressed middle-aged man pointing at the sky. One of them cast his eyes towards the black wall that was swallowing our city. An unmissable terror that was painstakingly dissembling reality, only to reassemble it elsewhere.

“See what?” He asked.

Though he couldn’t see what I saw, he could still see me. I was still a part of your world. I am a part of your world. It’s a steady transition – a steady erasure.

“The shadow that’s consuming everything!” I screamed in terror.

The man paused, before raising an eyebrow and laughing.

“I want what *you’re* drinking,” He slurred.

His tipsy cronies laughed along, and I ran back to the Dozen Minus car park in despair. I hopped into my vehicle and drove away. I realised that I was copying the simulated version of myself, but I didn’t care – I was merely happy to put the Ripple in the rear-view mirror.

As I hurtled down the main road, I watched the blackness envelop the drunkards on the street corner. The merry group of people joined the shadowy wall – their bodies ripped from limb to limb in what appeared to be excruciating torture. And yet, not one of them cried in agony. They continued to drunkenly chuckle in a manner that almost felt sinister. Uncanny. Their elongating bodies became shredded strands of pulled meat. There was something terrifying about seeing their stretching smiles seep into the endless oblivion.

I thought of what the voice told me.

“I am your future. But not theirs.”

It changed the future for all of you. Much like those drunken fools, you will soon enter a new timeline. One with a different ending. You might as well forget my predictions.

After leaving the city, I followed the motorway for half an hour. I drove until the creeping Ripple was nothing but a slight blemish on the horizon. I’m watching it approach from a grassy bank by a service station.

This post is my last interaction with your reality. It may seem strange that I used my final hour in this way, but my cautionary story must be told. When we exceed nature’s limits, it only seems logical that something unnatural should notice.

You’ll be fine. You’ll continue to exist. Who knows what your timeline holds?

Just don’t try to answer that question.

The Ripple is travelling at the glacial pace of, by my calculation, thirty miles an hour. I may have ten minutes before it catches me. I could run, but why? Why delay the inevitable pain?

Though, I wonder whether I *should* keep moving – I could buy time and search for an answer. You see, I keep focusing on the same niggling thought. I’ve done what *shouldn’t* have been done, and that means I’ve exhibited free will. Reality is not fixed.

The Ripple is lying.
