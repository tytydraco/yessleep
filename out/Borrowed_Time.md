Hey, everyone. I don’t even know where to start with this. I woke up yesterday morning—what I thought was April 4th—feeling totally normal. It was around 8 AM, and I did my usual thing: washed my face, brushed my teeth, brewed my coffee. I don’t check my phone until the caffeine kicks in, so it wasn’t until I sat down with my mug that I noticed something… wrong.

My phone said January 4th. Not April. January. My heart skipped a beat. I thought my phone had glitched or something, but then I looked at my whiteboard calendar in my room. It was filled in up to January, and four days were already crossed out.

At first, I thought maybe I’d gotten the dates mixed up somehow, or I’d been sleep-deprived for a few days. But NINE months? That’s impossible, right? I started panicking. Did I black out the last nine months of my life?

I grabbed my phone and checked my group chats, servers, DMs—anything to piece things together. According to my messages, I’d been living my life like normal this entire time. But here’s the thing: some of the replies didn’t sound like me. It wasn’t glaringly obvious, just little things. Phrases I wouldn’t use. Jokes that didn’t feel like mine. I wrote it off at first—thought maybe I’d been having a rough patch mentally.

Then I started noticing things in my room. My space looked like mine, but it didn’t feel like it. My bed was made, but the sheets smelled like they’d been recently used, not fresh. My clothes—ones I hadn’t worn in months—were missing from their usual spots in my closet. The drawers looked rummaged through, and some of my favorite outfits were lying in the laundry basket like they’d just been worn.

Even my makeup bag had been disturbed. The products I rarely use were out of place, and my foundation bottle was nearly empty, even though I distinctly remember it being almost full the last time I used it. It felt like someone had been living in my room—using my things—but everything was just familiar enough to make me question my sanity.

I checked my phone again, this time scrolling through my camera roll. I don’t usually take many pictures or videos, so the sheer number of them was shocking. Hundreds. Maybe thousands. Photos of me, drunk selfies with friends, videos of me with my family and baby siblings, random stuff from college classes.

Except… it wasn’t me.

The girl in the photos looked similar to me—same hair color, same eye color—but there was something wrong with her. She smiled in most of the pictures, but the smile didn’t feel real. Her eyes were too sharp, almost predatory. In some of the photos, she leaned in too close to my friends, her grin stretched wide like she was in on a joke no one else knew.

The videos were worse. In one, she looked directly at the camera for several seconds before laughing and turning away, as though she’d noticed someone—or something—just out of frame. Her voice was lighter, almost playful, but it had an edge to it, like she was mocking whoever was recording.

I started freaking out, like, full-blown panic attack. I ran to my flatmate’s room and begged them to help me. I explained everything, showed them the photos and videos of this random girl on my phone. But they just looked at me like I was losing it. They said the girl in the photos was me. That I’ve been here, living with them, acting completely normal for the past nine months.

I couldn’t believe them. I still don’t. I called my mom, thinking maybe she’d back me up—she’d know, right? But no. Same thing. She said it’s been me all along. That I’ve been coming over, talking to her, playing with my siblings. She didn’t even sound worried. She thought I was just tired or stressed.

But how can my own mom not recognize that this isn’t me? How can my flatmate, my friends, my professors—everyone—be convinced this random girl is me? Where did she come from? Where did I go for nine months?

And here’s the worst part: I don’t know where she is now. She’s gone. Disappeared, just like that. Is she watching me? Am I going to wake up tomorrow and have actually lost years to this random girl?

I don’t know what to do. I don’t even know if I’m safe in my own skin anymore.

If anyone has any ideas—or if you’ve heard of anything like this—please, I need help.
