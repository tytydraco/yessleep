So before I start,I will inform you that this isn't something you would ever expect to hear when it comes to strange and scary things people come across in the woods.


Usually it's people talking about having encounters with ghost,skinwalkers,werewolves,bigfoot etc.

But what I  went through today was something I am not sure anyone has ever had happen to them

And I am going crazy trying to make sense of it

So I generally take strolls around the wooded area by my home in the early hours of the weekend mornings.

I've lived in this same town for my whole life and there isn't all that much to do, but it sure is beautiful which I've always been thankful for.

So earlier on this beautiful Sunday morning,I headed out to the woods for my walk after showering and eating breakfast.

There are usually not many others that I see during these days out here on the trails this early,but when there are others they are usually joggers who I will share a quick wave with and be on my way.


But this morning towards the end of my walk,I came across a man...or rather what appeared to be a man walking towards my direction in front of me.

At first he appeared to be a normal looking guy.He was on the shorter side,short,brown nicely styled hair,a well groomed short beard,appeared to be caucasian ,and had a slender build but athletic looking at the same time.

But as I got closer I noticed his outfit seemed a little ...old fashioned looking but futuristic at the same time.

His shirt was a dark purple color that almost looked like it was made from an animal skin in a way. And his pants were a solid gold color ,with very shiny black loafers on his feet




I thought it was a very strange stule,especially for walking out here in the forest .When we were about 10 feet from each other,he suddenly stopped walking and stared at me as if he just noticed me.



I was about to say hello to break any awkwardness that might have been trying to creep in,but before I could even say anything,I took another  good look at him 

His face formed into a welcoming yet sinister smile and his eyes were...the same color as his clothes


One eye was a solid gold color and the other was a dark purple with black irisis.They looked predator-like in a way


I sensed a sensation I had never felt before in my life and I realized I was frozen in place,like I was in a trance in a way.


The man walked right up to me until his strange eyes were an inch in front of mine.I felt myself somehow floating towards them into inky blackness


I don't know how long I was in the dark as I lost all conciseness .No thoughts,no emotions.But I remember it.

All of the sudden the darkness faded away and I found myself soaring through a cloudless blood red sky while being held by something hanging on to my shoulders.

I still couldn't talk but I could move my head around at this point.I looked down to see that I was high above a world I did not reconigize .


All I saw below was what appeared to be a strangd landscape destroyed by flooding with sounds of screams and crashing waves 


Suddenly,I felt myself being dropped towards the water thousands of feet below, as I tried to scream but I couldn't, as all I saw above me was that red sky...

Along with a giant golden eagle in front of a white sun ....with one gold eye and the other a purple, staring down from above me, as if it was perched on a tree branch ,watching me fall to my watery grave .


But as I fell in a silent and endless scream ,I heard a otherworldly voice coming from above,below...every direction


*I have a message to deliever.You humans have forgotten what created you and what purpose you were always meant to serve.The future for humanity will receive no mercy unless the race returns to the truth.The blood will be  on every one of your kinds hands if you refuse.*


I soon felt myself crashing down into the icy water and knew I was going to drown in this strange realm.


Suddenly I found myself standing back in the woods again with that strange man nowhere in sight  .

Like any normal person who just experienced who the fuck knows what,I ran my ass home and locked every door and cried in my room for hours.





   


I know my friends and family will think I am nuts if I tell them this.So please redditers....what the hell was this being ,and what did it truly want?


And who or what told it to deliver that message?
