I love my girlfriend so much. I adore her style and I nearly faint every time she enters the room. Her beauty slices through me like a knife. Wherever she walks, I follow closely behind. 

Why do I love her so much? Well, the answer is quite simple. It's because I love everything about her. I love how her dark hair always covers her face (I find shy girls very attractive) and I love how her eyes gleam a bright red in the night. She only comes out at night, but I don't find that strange--I'm a night owl too, after all. 

I love how she frantically crawls on the ground, her nails ripping into the earth. She's so athletic. My favorite part is when she scales an entire building or fence. 

I love how sweet bile drips from her mouth. Even though I’m aware the average layman doesn’t find it appealing, I do love how it smells. Like fresh withering flowers. I love when she jumps onto the ceiling and curses at me--it's the cutest thing. I think she knows at least 20 different languages. She's so smart. 

The way she screeches always makes my heart flutter with joy. I can tell that she puts her heart into every word. I love her, I truly do. I love when she draws on the walls and tries to hide from me in my attic. She's such a good artist; I think what she's drawing is some kind of star, but I don't quite understand what it is (I'm pretty sure it's abstract). Her hands are always covered in red paint, so she’s always prepared. 

I love the way her neck twists and her body cracks. She's so flexible. I love the way her twisted and crooked smile radiates heat across my body (I personally like things spicy). I love all her friends that she invites over--they're all so nice and act just like her. But, of course, she's the most special one of all.

I can see her now. It's so cute when I can see her twitching in the corner. She's absolutely beautiful, and she has to know it. I need to tell her. I need to tell her how truly amazing she is, but I'm nervous because she might not feel the same way. I can see her peeking at me right now. IT'S JUST SO CUTE. 

The truth is, reddit, she’s not really my girlfriend yet. We hug each other from time to time and I appreciate their back-breaking level of love, but it’s just never enough. 

At the very least, I can tell that she likes me a lot. I think I'm just going to tell her after I post this. I’m going to tell her that I want to be more than just besties. I can feel my burning compassion rising for her as I type these very words.

Reddit, please give me advice for my romantic troubles. I need all the help I can get to secure a girl like her in my life. However, in the meantime, my love awaits.
