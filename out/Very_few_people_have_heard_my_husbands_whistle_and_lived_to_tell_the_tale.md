They say nobody's a saint. Most people I knew, beg to differ. My late husband was as close as it would get. And everyone else in our town thought the same. Nobody would dare say a bad word about Edward. He was dignified, kind, patient beyond words. 

Ofcourse I knew better. My husband was a complicated man. And I loved him regardless. 

A few days after his disappearance, he'd been left on my front door. The neighbors found him before I, and his skin had long started to rot. Already dried by the sun, stripped by the rain. Marked by the mud, with the odd maggot burrowing it's way from under his pores.

It was a sight I grieved. But I still breathed a quivering sigh of relief.

I'm writing this for three reasons. 

*1 Because one conscience can only carry so much. I need to share what I know to be true*

*2 He wouldn't want people to remember him this way, and so I must do it*

*3 I need advice*

I'll walk you through the situation I found myself in.

We fell behind in a lot of modern developments. My town stayed trapped in the early 1900s. To this day, what most of the world would call *'vintage'*, we still consider the newest thing. By choice. Anyone who appreciates the old ways, tends to grow old here. 

I'm sure my neighbors would frown apon me having this phone. But... this is the quickest way to get the word out there. 

This place...

It's beautiful. And Edward melted right in, like the muffled sky in a romanticized portrait. He just belonged. 

I remember the day he decided to court me. A perfect gentleman. How we went dancing in the town square, and took carriage rides in the park. We'd sit on his front porch for hours on end, discussing our future- I was 17 at the time. And it was perfect. 

He had a restrained drawl when he spoke. Deep laugh lines that made him look a few years older than he was. And he did look older- despite his otherwise smooth skin and jet black, thick head of hair. 

A lovely smile that made most women swoon- along with some men I suspect. 

*Then, there was also the few that saw that smile in their nightmares.*

He never told me, not directly. But he never... hid it either. 

There's no way to sugar coat this.

My husband was this town's most prolific serial killer. For years...and *years* on end. 

*The Whistling Walker*, they called him. Why? Well, the few victims that did escape his grasp, reported being stalked by a whistle. Usually while walking home from who knows where, at late hours of the night.

Or maybe your partner was gone for the night? And you heard that very whistle in the other room. Outside your bedroom door, in your closet. 

That was Edward.

Very, *very* few people lived to tell their tales, those that did, had common details. It was no coincidence. 

Now, how do I know? Well, my husband kept journals. The stuff of nightmares, I'd never wish reading them on the worst human being. 

But Edward never hid them, why would he? I'm sure a part of him wanted at least one person to know. 

And when he realized I was never going to ask him what he'd do on his late nights out- this was the next best thing, I suppose. 

I won't scar you with the diary entries. It's truly just all the ramblings of a madman. Trying to understand the human psyche. Wondering why he had no empathy. Wondering if he loved me. Or *anyone* for that matter. If he even *could.*

There's a passage or two, that I find must be shared. And so I will, because I will not allow it to go unheard. 

*She's breathtaking. A woman of many interests. Has been to all walks of life, and carries all that knowledge in her small stature. She's tidy. I noticed a single wrinkle on her shoulder. She moved as if she was self conscious about it. She danced, as rigid as it was. Which was endearing*

*There's plenty of reason why she'll be different. Why she'll get me to feel. To understand the beat of a heart, infatuated by another. She'll capture mine, and she'll keep it for the long haul.*

*For her sake*

He wasn't a man of many words. But that was much needed context. This is the interesting part, months later- I believe a month or so after our anniversary.

*It's faint but it's there. The bitter whistle of time running dry. Alexandria did all she could do. But I fear there's nothing that can be done at this point. I hear it, in every syllable she says, even in her whispers to me while we're intimate. It's there*

*I feel it scratching at my throat, climbing its way up and out. Forcing me to swallow as hard as I can in my moments of solitude. Buying her the time she needs to eventually decide she prefers to live.*

*I suppose I could tell her. That I'm battling the urge to slit her throat and do unspeakable things to her. But what would that accomplish? I'm quite sure it's not egocentric to assume she'll still love me for a bit too long after leaving me*

*This being inside of me. It can feel when my victims still have their attachments. And will not leave them until they eventually let me go. That same entity puts it's hand on my shoulder, it tells me what to say to win those hearts. And reminds me of how little control I actually have over it*

I knew my husband was no normal man. He seemed too... perfect. Not to me, to everyone else. Nobody could find a single fault. And let me explain what I mean by that. 

Little things, such as Edward telling a lie. A blatant one, as if claiming he attended an event that I knew for a fact he wasn't there for. Such as a town hall meeting, or a neighbors engagement party. As long as he showed that lovely smile, and claimed he was there? Nobody could say otherwise. 

Everyone would have memories of him there. And they would somewhat be coherent with what others remember. I never knew how he'd do it- but it never worked on me. 

He tried. *Believe me*. But I could always see passed it. And I assumed that's why he loved me. Now I realize it's what kept me alive in the absence of his love for me. That, and nobody suspects a married man. 

I'd accepted that all this dies with him. The heartache, the murder, all of it. But... then the murders continued. 

In the same fashion. Grotesque acts, preluded by a Whistle. 

My husband passed. I know that for certain. I watched his body get lowered. He's gone. So how have his actions lingered on our town? 

I had a conversation with Marilyn the other day. She clutched her scarf close to her gown. We were the last two to stroll out of the Sunday service. It was lovely, as always...but had a... tension. As if everyone was waiting for a whistle beneath the band's rising strings. Or interrupting the pastor's words. Turning the silence to absolute chaos. 

But, nothing happened. All the anxious interactions did, was spark my discussion with Marilyn.

"...it's truely bone chilling", she'd mutter, her soft voice echoing through the pews. 

"I'm sure it'll pass", I respond, our steps were small and slow, in no rush to leave the church empty. 

"My dear, are you certain you wouldn't prefer to live with my husband and I? It's simply not safe for you to be living alone. Especially since the whole town *knows* that you're unprotected.", she mean't well, her tone conveyed a genuine worry that stopped me from getting offended. 

"...what would that town say, knowing that I'm currently living with a married couple?", I reasoned, "lest I temp him into sin- that holy man of yours"

We chuckled. 

"I'm sure Gregory wouldn't mind the excitement", she joked back. 

Our giggles dying out as we stepped foot on the churches porch. The wood seemed to rasp in the breeze, groaning under the weight of it's own age. The courtyard was littered with people in their Sunday best, disheveled from a well-spent service, and engrossed in pleasant conversations under the evening sun, and bitting breeze. 

"He *has* been more juvenile", Marilyn commented, a lot more like a thought said outloud, than something meant for my insight. 

But I asked anyway, "In what way?"

"Late nights.", Marilyn sighed to herself, "I'd wrongly assumed his post would shame him from this behavior. No such luck."

"He's a priest. Unfortunately they have their reputations", I said. 

"You always assume you've found the good one. As is our burden as women.", she muttered with a faint smile. Before adding, "I suppose we aren't wrong *all* of the time. Edward was certainly one of a kind"

She rarely commented on him. I knew she had a great deal of respect for my late husband. I knew if Edward was alive, and had courted her in secret, she would've forsaken Gregory, as well as her friendship with me. Thrown it all to the wolves and ran off.

She unfortunately, wouldn't have lasted too long, I suspected.

"Yes...", I said, "I was lucky."

I waited for a few small breaths before asking, "How are the wedding preparations going?"

She grins at me, her bright red lipstick, perfectly applied- was now showing signs of a whole day spent wearing it. 

"It's... splendid. Really, it is. Marcus is a true gentleman and his family is a delight-"

"*And Alexandria?*", I interrupted. I'm sure it was jarring for her but she responded anyways. 

"It isn't easy, losing a daughter. I'll see her a lot less now. She'll belong to her husband's family.", Marilyn muttered, "She does seem excited. She's eager to get to the ceremony. She'd have it tonight if she could"

I'm not sure how Alexandria survived. But I have my suspicions. 

A few days passed. And I had gone over one of the last passages left by Edward. Carelessly scribbled on ripped paper. Torn by the force of his pen alone. 

*I did it. I did all that it's asked of me. And now, it's promised me peace. Now, it's promised me a life, with my lovely Sylvia. A life with a heart that beats, a soul that can cling to another. Please... Let it be true*

A few days later, he'd arrive dead. His already decomposing body, cradled in my arms. His lovely Sylvia.

And the last person to see him was the bride-to-be. One does not just escape the jaws of death unscathed. She knew something. 

She wasn't particularly frightened either. Not at the sight of me at her front door, just days before her wedding.

"Goodevening dear, is your mother-"

"She's not here. She's returning soon.", Alexandria interrupted, "...but I'm certain she's not the reason you're here?"

Alexandria had pitch black, shoulder length curls. Dark green eyes, with eyelashes that curl and flutter as if ensured of her innocence. Untouched, pale skin. She looked as young as she was, about 21. 

I knew immediately why she'd survived. 

She made me a cup of tea, she spoke clearly- not a single mumble or stutter. She would ask me to repeat myself blatantly when she misheard. 

I'd had my suspicions of her character. But I'd never spoken to her without Marilyn present. Now, I knew for sure- she was certain. Not at all like Edward interpreted her. And I had a feeling that was on purpose.

I also noticed something- she's pregnant. Just barely noticeable to the trained eye.

Which would explain why her engagement with the gentleman Marcus is progressing so fast

She decided to break the silence herself, "Are you going to ask me about your late husband?"

She didn't sound proud. Just, not ashamed of her deeds. And I couldn't find it in me to care eitherway, "I just need to know what happened".

"Would you believe me if I told you?", she asked.

"You'd be surprised, dear", I promised.

She recounted her last night with him with no hesitation. As if the tale was clawing at her tongue, begging to be spoken. 

Like every other time they'd meet. They'd discuss their future. Their life. They did not have the luxury of strolls in the park, fearing the townsfolk might see. And so, they'd leave town all together. 

Not many vehicles are made available to the public. Those that were, were intrusted to valuable members of the community. And Edward had such privilege. 

They'd leave town. Forsake everything from our clothes and manner of speak. She said they'd visit music festivals and crude bars. They'd savor everything life had to offer. Outside the confines of the town Edward insisted was the *only* pure place remaining in our broken world.

My bitterness was swallowed. And I listened on in silence. 

"...he had never attempted anything untoward before. Never suggested much besides the occasional stolen kiss. That night ...was different. He'd never made arrangements for us to sleep there- in the city. This was special", she said, stirring her own tea with a vacant stare aimed at the fireplace. 

She recalled how the music still echoed in her skull. How the substances they'd no doubt indulged in, finally took hold over her. Just enough to smother the last of her inhibitions. 

She made sure to emphasize how patient we was. Despite his clear need. And I suppose that was in an effort to make me feel better? Still, she detailed every action they did that night. And for a moment, I wondered if they'd be a point to her reminiscing. 

"...It was constant", she muttered, her tone steadying to a monotonous retelling of events, "it woke me. I remember the sun was flickering through the curtains, the beds in those cities were made with such care, forcing myself up was harder than usual. But I did."

She takes a small breath, "It sounded like a train. Wailing in the distance but never growing closer. And I called to him. He didn't respond. And the sound persisted."

I watched as she clutched her teacup with a force that might just shatter it. 

"He was knelt in our kitchen. I remember marveling at the beautifully carved countertop. A stove, compact and probably quite efficient. I was excited to make him a meal in that very space.", she claimed. 

She looked me in the eye, "he unraveled it. Like a ball of threat. The modernity of it all. The mundane... crept away from the pitch of his whistle. Bare knees on the wooden floors. Hands at his side, as if shackled to the ground. His eyes raised to the ceiling"

She chocked it out. But I eventually got the image she was painting me.

His whistle was as stubborn as he was. Climbing to the pitch of a boiling kettle, bubbling on the stove. His body trembled with the force of his breath. Breath he never dragged back into his poor lungs. 

His lips puckered in a perpetuity. Turing red from the effort, and quivering- straining every muscle on his face.

Alexandria tried to pull him out of this trance like state. She failed. He simply grew louder. Veins protruding on his neck, then his shoulders. His wrists and so on. Every last bit of air being drained. 

She gave up when his lips parted. And the whistle got louder. 

He looked as if he was letting out a gut wrenching scream. But no such sound came out. Just the whistle. Getting louder and louder. Higher and higher.

Should be impossible to make such a sound for this long. And Alexandria wasn't stupid. Her first instinct was to run. She scrambled to her feet. And his head turned just as fast towards her

She took a step back. Whimpering at the sight of his shrunken eyes. His skin tightening on his skull. His jaw still dropped and his agony seeing no end in sight. 

He crawled. 

She ran. Down the hall, and just before she shut the bedroom door. She caught a glimpse of his sickening form, crawing and reaching it's way over to her. 

"The whistle distorted", she whispered, wiping away a tear, "his lips never moved. I'm not sure they *could*. But in the same cadence and tone of the screech. I heard it. A high and frantic mantra, ringing from his throat"

*I will never die- I will never die- I will never die- I will never die*

"He curled himself onto the floor. The whistle died and so did he. But his mouth never closed", she placed her teacup on the table, sniffling softly. 

"And so...when he arrived at my door?"

"I fled as soon as I though he was dead... there's nothing I can tell you after that.", she muttered.

...

"...do you know what my husband was? Who he was?", I asked, dreading the answer and ready to leave. 

"I can still hear it. Your husband...", she takes a breath, "I am sorry...for... everything"

I gave her a nod. And I left. 

Sympathy was a scarce resource- especially from my hardened heart- *especially* towards her. 

But I do. Sympathize with her. If I had known, perhaps I might have warned her sooner.

...

And so the murders continued. 

And I found out a lot more from my husband's journals. Giving myself time to actually look through every page. 

About a month before his death

*I'm writing later than usual. And I have a feeling this might be a more common occurrence. My lovely Sylvia is asleep by my side. She seems restless. I know she can probably feel what I am. What's inside of me, and can't put her finger on it*

*I wish I could tell her. If only I knew myself. All I know is, I've become the very nightmares I'd feared as a child. I hated my uncles whistle. Whistler, is what my town called him. The Whistling Walker has a better ring to it. The title is not mine. I'm but a vessel. And I'm scared.*

*Sylvia? My lovely. If you're reading this. I've rotted away. Or, I've vanished. These journals are for your eyes and your eyes only. Because to understand this curse is to invite it. So ensure it dies with me.*

Don't worry. I haven't cursed you. I don't believe it works that way. I do believe I have my suspicions as to who this entity has latched on to. And who it's going to afterwards. 

It seems to attach itself to men. To urge them to act on their worst impulses. To earn love from strangers then rip their flesh. For sport? For sustenance? I'm unsure. But it announces it's presence with a whistle. It feeds and feeds, then drains the host of it's last breath once satisfied. It leaves them contorted into a soundless scream. 

It seems to keep to one family at a time. Leaping hosts only once the body can be used to kill. 

I'm safe. I don't have relatives. 

Alexandria... that poor soul. With... whatever she has in her womb. Just waiting to grow into a killer. Let's hope it's a girl. 

Until then, I paid Marilyn a visit. I helped them prepare for the ceremony. 

I met Marcus. His prominent dimples and calm disposition. He was a gentleman. Dancing with her, and absolutely smitten all the while.

Deciding to leave early, I took one last look at Marilyn's family... I wondered if Marcus being welcomed in, changes the curses target. Maybe the dimpled gentleman would whistle next. 

But as I greeted the father of the home, I knew that wasn't the case. 

*Gregory*...

What a charming smile. 

He graced me with it, joining the festivities. 

I wandered my way from the home. Opening my umbrella and strolling in the evening sun. 

This curse is not my burden. And it gave me the mercy of my life once. It had no affect on me- it's lies and trickery, and I'm not interested in uncovering why. I simply wish to grieve the life that was taken from me. 

But I suppose if I was so resolute, I wouldn't be writing this. 

Please consider, if I interfere with this... I will just as easily lose my life. Saving people who wouldn't dare do the same for me. 

Should I intervene? Or, should I leave, and hope I'll never hear another whistle for as long as I live?

-Sylvia
