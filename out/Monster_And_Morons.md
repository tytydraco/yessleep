"In local news, a meteorite was sighted here in Summer Berry Falls."


I was mostly listening to the TV. My focus was on getting through Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance on critical. The anchor went on.


"It was spotted by several farmers, but one's home was apparently struck by it. We go now, to our interview with him."


I got up to grab a Capri Sun and make myself a sandwich. The TV now showed a pudgy older man in overalls standing on his front porch.


"I was just having a smoke with my dog, Maxine, here."


The camera moved to show a panting bloodhound which he petted. 


"And I was giving her some belly rubs when that thing came whizzing by. Damn thing nearly made me jump out of my skin and it destroyed my satellite dish."


The camera zoomed in on the spot where it had been as the man talked about how grateful he was there hadn't been more damage.


"Now, did you think about maybe going to investigate it?"

"No, ma'am. I've seen some of them horror movies and that never goes well."


The screen cut back to the anchors back at the station.


"Well, he might have a point. It is almost Halloween after all."


"Maybe we might get some…Aliens!"


The two anchors laughed in that stereotypical newscaster way. I was about to sit back down when I heard my brother, Adrian,  yell for me upstairs.


"Yo, Wade."

"What?"

"I need to talk to you about something."


I went to his room with my food. He was in front of his computer on Facebook. 


"Hey, can I have one of those?"  he asked, pointing to one of my diagonal sandwich halves.


I obliged. He thanked me and took a large bite.


"So what did you want to talk about?"


Adrian washed down his food with some Code Red Mountain Dew.


"There's going to be a party tomorrow night."

"So what? It's Halloween. There'll be lots of them."

"No, you don't understand. This one is going to be at Loren Heath's house."


Loren Heath was the most popular student in our school and his parties were always all out ragers.


"I was talking to him on here and he wants us to come."

"Holy shit."

"See for yourself."



He showed me his chat with him. 


"Okay, what about Mom and Dad? They'd kill us if they found out we went."

"Don't be a pussy. They won't even be home until Sunday night. Look, I already told him we'd be there. If I back out, he'll think I'm an asshole."

"But if we get caught we might be sent to Great Aunt Clara's house."


She was a nice woman. The issue was she was the kind of person you just couldn't say no to. Our big brother, Casey was sent there as punishment. After enduring several days of vacation slides he came back with a thousand-yard stare and not quite the same. We shuddered at the thought.


"Maybe we'll get lucky and she'll die so we don't have to worry about that."

"God damn, Adrian."

"Okay, that was shitty of me, but I think  going to Loren's party is worth the risk."


Adrian stared at me in a pleading manner and I caved in.


"Fine, I guess I can go."

"Awesome, it's a costume party so wear something cool."


We chose to go as Mario and Luigi with me as the latter. We pulled up to Loren's place which was practically a mansion. It was decked out "in Halloween decor with fake dead bodies all over his yard. Music was blasting from inside.


"Adrian, I'm glad you could make it," Loren greeted in a Freddy costume.

"We wouldn't miss this for the world.

"Hey, I'm Wade."

"Yeah, I know you. I've seen you around school. Adrian here told me you're shy around girls."


I blushed a little and shot my brother a glare.


"I mean I can talk with them. I just have a hard time asking them out."


Loren nodded in understanding.


"I think that'll change tonight. For now, it's time to turn shit up."


The party was even crazier than we expected with most of the games involving booze. Other drugs were passed back and forth. I even managed to chat it up with a few girls. Unfortunately, too much social interaction can be a bit overwhelming to me. I decided to step out for some fresh air.



I glanced around, noting the other houses and their decorations. I was about to head back inside when I noticed something off.  I was looking at the fake bodies on the lawn except there were two I didn't remember being there before. Curious, I examined them closer.  It was a murdered couple dressed as ketchup and mustard bottles.


The detail was spot on. They'd been horribly maimed with gaping holes in their chests larger than a grizzly's arm. I was stunned by it, then I got a strong whiff of something metallic. I thought fake blood wasn't supposed to have a smell.  


"Oh shit," I whispered when the reality of the situation finally clicked in my head.


I sprinted back inside and tried to warn everyone that there was a killer nearby. As it turned out, though, drunk teenagers aren't great listeners. They either didn't pay me any attention or thought I was messing with them. I found Adrian laughing with some people on the couch. I called him over.


"What's up?"

"Okay, first, are you still sober?"

"Yeah, I haven't drunk anything yet."

"Good, come with me."


He gave the people he was talking to a shrug and then I took him outside. 


"See?" I said, pointing to the corpses.


 Adrian didn't understand at first, then he too realized the truth.


"Dude, are you telling me there's a fucking killer here?"

"It seems that way."

"Nah, fuck this. We need to call the cops."


Loren was flirting with some girls who were drunkenly laughing at something he said. 


"What's the matter?" he asked Adrian. "You look like you've seen a ghost."

"Dude, there are two people outside dead in your yard."


Loren's smile dropped and he stared wide-eyed at us. Then he burst out laughing.


"Bro, they're just decorations."

"No, these aren't. Two people have actually been murdered."

"Sure there are. I think you've been hitting the weed too hard. That stuff's pretty strong."

"No, we're not kidding."


Adrian saw that his words weren't registering.


"Look, we're going to call someone for help."


Loren scoffed.


"You're going to nark on us? I thought you were cool!"

"No, we just-"


Loren repeated the word nark. Then the other partygoers joined him in chanting it. Adrian tightly pursed his lips.


"I don't think we're going to get anywhere like this," I said.

"No shit."


Adrian's anger reached a fever pitched and he snapped.


"Man, fuck, y'all. I hope that pyscho gets you next!"


Adrian left and I followed, hearing Loren ask what his problem was.


"So what now?" I asked.

"Now, we're getting the fuck out of here. They can deal with this shit on their own."


Part of me didn't want to leave the others in danger. The other didn't want to get murdered. Our costumes didn't have pockets so Adrian had left his keys on a wall hook. When we went to get them, however, they were gone.


"Where are the keys?" I asked.

"They were right here," Adrian replied.

"Well, they aren't anymore."

"I can see that."


We checked the other hooks to no avail.


"Did you go out to the car at any point?"

"No, I've been here the whole time."

"Maybe they fell on the floor."

"Oh yeah, good thinking."


Searching it also turned up nothing.


"Seriously, where  are they?" Adrian asked


We were frantically crawling on our hands and knees in hopes of coming across the keys.


"That means we're stuck here," I said, mortified. "We're stuck with a killer nearby."


Even though Adrian was scared too, he attempted to calm me down.


"Look, just relax. We'll be safer inside."

"What if someone here is the killer?"

"Wade, these morons are too drunk to know their mouths from their assholes, let alone murder anyone. Besides, it's not like we have much of a choice. Let's just look for our keys, then get the hell out of here."


I managed to control my breathing.


"You're right."

"Good, come on."


We eventually found the keys being used in a drinking game. It was similar to beer pong only pairs of car keys were being thrown.


“God damn it, those are electric,” Adrian shouted.


We went to get them back only for Loren and some of his friends to step in front of us.


“Wow, can’t you see the game’s starting to get good?” he asked.

“I don’t care. We need to go.”

“That’s too bad and after I convinced everyone to let you stay. I was even going to invite you and your brother to my next party.”


People began booing Adrain whose face went red.


“Fine,”

“See? I told y’all he was alright.”


Loren heartily slapped Adrian on the back, then joined the others in the game as the DJ was going through different Halloween-fitting songs.


“I think this might take a while,” Adrian told me.

“Okay, get the keys when you get the chance. I gotta take a leak.”


Getting to a bathroom should never be this difficult. I had to step over people who were either passed out drunk or too high to move.  When I was finished, I was going to head back downstairs when I heard something strange coming from one of the other rooms. It sounded like growling and chewing. My first thought was that it was a dog.



I checked and what I found made me glad I took a piss first. Three things stood out in that bedroom, the broken window,  the guy on the floor, and the thing chewing his face off which looked exactly like him down to his costume which was of  Dracula. I let out a gasp, causing it to notice me. I slammed the door shut and darted down the hall. Behind me, the creature was already ripping the door off its hinges.
I nearly slipped while running back downstairs, then screamed my head off for help. Adrian was still waiting to get his keys back.  His face turned pale when he saw the thing chasing me. Loren grinned.


“Bill, we’ve been wondering where you’ve been.’

“That’s clearly not him,” I said. “Can’t you see the blood still on him?”

“Duh. he’s a vampire.”


One of Loren’s friends went over to the monster posing as Bill despite my warnings.  It all happened so fast.  It grew abnormally long nails and in one swipe, decapitated him. Blood squirted from his neck as his lifeless body collapsed. The room fell silent and we thought the others might believe us. Then they all cheered.


“Dude, how did y’all set this up?” Loren asked,  “It even smells real.”

“It’s not a prank you fucking dipshit,” I snapped. “Everyone, run!”

“Committing to the role,  I like that.”

“Your friend’s head is in the punch bow.”

“Yeah, I’m looking to get head tonight.”




Loren then grabbed his friend’s severed head and began suggestively thrusting at it. While this was wrong in ways I don’t even want to think about, we had bigger problems, The main one being the creature which was now drinking the blood of its latest kill. I jumped when I felt Adrian grab my shoulder and turned to see him with the keys. Unfortunately, before we could leave,  it attacked again, this time growing its mouth to a massive size and biting chunks out of people.



“Hey, wait, a minute, something doesn’t feel right here,” Loren said as it sank its teeth into him.


With one sickening crunch, it feasted and tossed him aside. We ducked his flying body and he hit the wall, sliding to the floor. We knelt beside him, seeing that his life was rapidly draining.


"It even feels like my ribs are broken and I hear people screaming. I can't believe you all took the time to set this up," he whispered between gasps.

"No, you really have been injured. You're going to die if you don't get help," Adrian said.

"Oh, right."


With the last of his strength, Loren smiled and winked at us, then fell still.


"He died pretending to die," I said.

"He died as he lived, a dumbass,"  Adrian replied.


We were lucky the creature hadn't gotten to us yet. With the keys, we finally had a means of escape. Too bad for us, me in particular, the monster wasn’t too keen on letting its prey escape. When it spotted us going out the front door, it gave chase. It gunned for me and chased me in circles around our car.


“Do something,” I screamed at Adroam as he was unlocking the door.


He got inside and started the car. At first, I was afraid he was going to leave me. Then when I passed by his side, he shoved open the driver's door, knocking the monster over and giving me time to hop inside. We peeled away as it was gathering itself and it let out an enraged bellow when it saw us getting away.



On the road, we were able to finally calm down.


“What the fuck was that thing?” I asked.

“Someone else’s problem. Let’s just go home and forget any of this ever happened.”


I was about to agree when I glanced in the rearview mirror. What I was seeing made my heart stop.


“Adrian,” I whispered hoarsely and pointed.


He looked too and his jaw dropped. The monster was running at us on foot.


“Why are we going so slow?”

“We’re not. I’ve been pushing seventy!”

“How is it keeping up then?”

“How the hell should I know?”


Adrian was practically hammering the gas pedal as I gave this some thought. I came to a harrowing conclusion.


“What if it’s getting stronger with each kill?”

“What is it, racking up exp?”


That meant if it got enough victims, it might become unstoppable.  Despite our speed, it caught up and leaped at our car, grabbing hold of a door handle. Adrian desperately tried shaking it off, but it held on like a stubborn hangnail. 

“Do we have anything we can use as a weapon?” I asked.

“There’s a tire iron in the back.”


I grabbed it and put the window down. The creature tried attacking me. I hit it across the jaw, forcing it to let go and tumble to the road. We knew that would only slow it down and that we needed a way to shake it off for good.


“We need somewhere to hide,”  Adrian said.

“What about there?”


Our headlights illuminated an unattended construction site.  From what we gathered, a big project was underway to create some kind of business. As a result, the road was being expanded. The equipment there gave us a lot of options for cover.  Adrian parked between some and cut off the engine.


“Would you quit breathing so loudly?” he asked.

“Sorry.”


We waited and for a while nothing happened.


“Do you see anything?” Adrian asked.


I was about to say no when the monster popped up in front of my window and grabbed me by the neck. The next thing I knew I was yanked out and held up by the neck. It wasn’t only strength it had developed. I could now see a sadistic glee in its eyes as it grinned at me with teeth too big for its mouth. It changed again, this time taking on my appearance.


I screamed, trying to get myself free. Luckily, Adrian thought fast and hit it with the car, causing it to drop me. It flew back and into some large barrels. They fell, rolling on top of it. He got out and helped me up.


“Is it dead?” I asked.


My question was answered when it emerged from the wreckage extremely pissed off. 


“Oh, come on,” Adrain groaned.


We glanced around, desperate for anything that might help us/ A bit of moonlight illuminated a road roller, and inside was something I thought might just save us.


“Adrian?”

“What?”

“I have an idea. Can you keep this thing busy?”

“I can try.”


We split with him going to the car and me heading for the road roller. It seemed the creature’s target was always the last person it encountered. That was lucky for me. The keys were still inside and I turned it on. I should mention, I wasn’t the best driver.


I turned the road roller, cursing loudly as I slammed into several other construction vehicles. Meanwhile, Adrian was being pursued throughout the site. I didn’t know how he was managing to keep from crashing into anything. Finally, I was able to straighten it out. Seeing what I was trying to do, Adrian maneuvered to go in front of me, slowing down a little.


I drove the roller forward, catching the creature by surprise. It attempted in vain to wiggle away and let out a pained shriek as it was crushed. Then there was a loud pop and it became silent. I turned off the machine and got out. 


"Is it actually dead this time?" Adrian asked from the car.


A pool of blood was forming near my feet.


"Looks like it."


Approaching sirens sounded in the distance.


"Of course, the cops show up now. Wade, come on."


We drove in silence for a while, trying to process the craziness of everything when Adrian's phone rang.


"Who is it?" I asked.

"It's mom."


It turned out she and Dad had gotten home early and were wondering where we were. Adrian covered the phone.


"Where the hell are we anyway?" he asked, looking around.


I tapped him on the shoulder and cocked my thumb to the side. There was a theater and Adrian told our mom we were catching a movie. She wasn't happy about us staying out late, but with it being Halloween she made an exception. 


"Hey, The Thing is playing here. I've been meaning to see that one," I said.

"Oh yeah, I've heard good things about it."


The theater was doing a showing of it for the holiday. After everything we'd been through, it was a nice way to wrap up the night. We didn't know what that thing was and we didn't care. All we knew is that it wouldn't be bothering us anymore. In case anyone was wondering, we thought the movie lived up to the hype.


The deaths at Loren's party were chalked up to a freak animal attack. In a way, I guess that's not entirely inaccurate. Attending it taught us a valuable lesson that some people's approval isn't worth seeking. The last thing I'll share is what we saw on the news the next day. We were sharing a bag of discounted Halloween candy and flipping through the channels.


The construction site we were at the previous night appeared on the TV with the news mentioning a construction delay. There was also a cop on screen. He was asking anyone to come forward with any tips that might lead to the arrest of those responsible for the damages.


"We better stay away from that area for a while," I said.

"Agreed."

"In some spooky post-Halloween news, 
 an unidentified animal was found crushed by some of the construction equipment. We must warn those with children or who are squeamish may want to change the channel," one of the newscasters said.


 In the daylight, we got a better view of what was left of the monster. It was only a red paste. Adrian whistled.
