Part 1 [A Bitter Taste](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/d5Tosd6r9K)

“W-what’s happened? Why am I older?” I ask, gazing at my reflection. I’m at least a decade older, more if the years have been good to me. I turn back to face her, curiosity overshadowing embarrassment. “How old am I?”

The woman looks at me, face sullen with concern. “How old do you think you are, my love?”

“Nineteen?” I say, not even knowing if I thought it was that. I could barely remember anything that’s happened recently up until now. It’s all just vague recollections.

“Oh,” she says, hanging her head. “Eleven years lost then. You don’t even know who I am then, do you? Not even my name?”

“Um, sorry. Not a clue. Are we… married?”

“Yes, dear, I’m Marie, your wife. We’ve been married for nearly seven years,” she says, her face growing more dour.  

“Wait. So, did I hit my head or something? What’s going on? Do I have amnesia or something?”

“Yes, dear. I’m afraid you’ve suffered these bouts our entire marriage. It’s a result of your work, you see?” she asks, her face tightening with worry as she looks into my eyes.

“My… work?”

“Yes, you’re a chemist, my love. A brilliant one, but unfortunately the subject of your work has such an ill effect on the mind. Time has slipped from you in the past, but not so much as this I’m afraid. And without so much as a warning…” she explains, her eyes drifting off.

“A warning?” I ask, her focus snapping back to me, as if I’ve interrupted a train of thought.

“Yes, there will typically be signs before, but I must have been distracted as of late. Either way, that matters little now. Come, let us get something to eat first before we discuss further. Perhaps dining in your own hall will jog memories?”

“Um. I need to use the bathroom first.” 

She points to a small wooden door across the room.

I enter it and let out a sigh of relief, the plumbing is modern at least. A shower, a sink, a toilet—hell—even a bidet.

No electricity though it seems. I’ll have to make do with the sunlight coming through the small stained glass window.

As nature calls, I take the time to look over myself more. I’m definitely older, and hairier. I never had this much chest hair, and it feels like stubble on my back. 

Do I shave my back? Do I have to start doing that? I’m eleven years older, what else will I need to do now, that I didn’t before?

At least I’m in good shape. I’m not winning any gunshows, but I’m obviously no slouch. Oh god, will I need to start working out?

“Dear, are you alright in there?” she called.

“Y-yeah, just a minute!” I call back, snapping back to the more pressing matter, the fact that I have a wife now.

When I come out, Marie’s dressed in a modest crimson gown, with a brown corset. She looks…beautiful.

Her auburn hair coming down over her shoulders in gorgeous curls. Her hazel eyes shining brown with specks of blue. Her face, strong, confident, but holding a soft expression, one full of concern.

Is that me being older? Is that the faint memories of her being my wife of seven years?

“Are you ready, honey?” she asks, her face expectant.

“Err—yes!” I say, straightening up and composing myself.

She leads me out of the bedroom, and into a large hall. A downward stairwell to our left, and a balcony that wrapped around to the other side of the stairwell to our right. Doors to other rooms and elsewhere lined the hall.

“Wow, this is ours?” I ask, gazing around in wonder.

“Yours, Alan. You worked very hard, and so yes, all of this became yours,” she answers, almost like she was scolding me.

“I’m sorry. I know that you’re probably not happy, having lost your husband, but—“

“HUAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!” A scream. A bloodcurdling scream. A yell of sheer agony, almost like that of a beast, but oh so clearly human. 

It echoes up from deep beneath the castle, ringing out through the halls, and my bones.
