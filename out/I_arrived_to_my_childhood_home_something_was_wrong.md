My father had died. I don't remember the last time I talked to him. When I was younger we had a healthy relationship. I don't know why my mother cut ties with him. But she did. And ever since she did I only talked to my father over the phone. Reason being my mother moved county's and took me with her.                     

When I heard the news he died. I didn't cry. I didn't feel anything. I just accepted it for what it was.               His house, my childhood home was given to me in his will. My mother wasn't here to tell me what to do. I was going to fly back to Ireland and visit it.

I didn't remember the twisting roads of the country side that well. I remember the greenery. That's about it. I had the adress, it took a while but I found it.

My home.

The house was quite isolated. Huge gates guarding the property. I typed in the code for the gates that was also given to me. I drove in. It was a long drive way. To the left was a fountain, I remembered playing in it. And to the right was a big shed. Where my father kept his cars. The grass and hedges weren't cut in a while. 

I approached the house and parked my car on the rough gravel. It was so much bigger than I last remembered. My father was a construction worker. I assumed he had extensions done to the house. A lot of extensions. I walked up to the door. Using the key given to me I unlocked the door. 

The house looked completely different. I wandered around a bit. Looking at the furniture and pictures. I noticed a lot of dead flies. Like they were trapped. The house was so huge I must've been walking around for an hour or two. I noticed there was no clocks. I sat down in the marble kitchen. Looking out the window in front of me. Over looking the large garden that looped around to the front of the house. The kitchen and living room were connected. Well there was about 3 living rooms. But on the other side of the house. I just then noticed in the living room connected to the kitchen were stained glassed double doors that led to a long hallway. Mostly bedrooms within that hallway. 4 bedrooms down stairs, two upstairs. Why was there so many I thought to myself. Arriving to the last room was a storage room. Bunch of rubbish within it. I looked out the window and somehow saw the exact same view I did from the kitchen. I froze in confusion. I was no where near the kitchen.

I walked around outside. Trying to understand how what I seen made sense. It didn't. I walked backwards up a slight hill. One big tree on top of said hill. I looked at the house. It was completely unrecognisable, I couldn't see over the top of the house from the hill. It was too big. 

I continued to walk around the house still trying to figure out what I saw. I came across a very dirty window. On the right side of the house. Opposite from the hill and the connected living room and kitchen. I looked through the window and saw a bed, the window was too dirty to see anything else. And by this point I must've been in all the rooms and none had such a dirty window. I went back inside trying to locate the room with the dirty window. I couldn't find. Looked from top to bottom. It was driving me mad. I haven't even gotten my stuff into the house yet. I always got frustrated easily. And always determined aswell. I wanted to know what the fuck was going on. It was confusing me.                    After searching the house multiple times I looked at the dirty window. I grabbed a nearby brick that was leaning against the shed and threw it at the window.            The window broke. It was a very dark room. And by this point the sky was also getting dark. I peeked my head inside. Still couldn't see shit. I said to myself fuck it and climbed in. Walked across the room and turned on the lights.

I was in of the bedrooms upstairs. 

I looked around. I was scared for some reason. The window was broken still and I looked out of it. I was indeed on the second floor. I ran down the wooden steps of the house back outside towards where I broke the window. There was no window now. I ran to where the bedroom window should usually be and it wasn't broken.

I thought that I was fucking insane and tried to ignore it. I spent a week living there and everything wasn't too bad. There was a small town nearby I did my shopping in. It was good enough. I sat down at the kitchen. Putting food in the fridge. I then heard a clock. I thought there wasn't any but oh well. But I heard the ticking of the clock no matter where I was in the house. I knew this house made no fucking sense and looking for this clock will drive me mad but it was pissing me off. I tore apart every room and no clock was found. 

The clock was always ticking. Eating my mind there was days I wouldn't leave my house desperately looking for it. Soon enough I heard the buzzing of the fridge extremely loudly as well. I threw the fridge out. That seemed to work. Knowing the noises can be stopped I kept the hunt for clock going. I was getting used to it though. 

I went an other week living in the house normally. Sometimes some other object would make loud noises, competing with the clock. I would find the objects making the noises and throw them out. 

One day I got lost in my house randomly. Any room i entered was the wrong one. Any window I looked out of was an upstairs window, I wasn't going to jump. To stop this problem with not knowing what room leads where I decided to remove all the doors except the one leading outside. The rooms didn't change anymore. What a relief. The house was a lot colder now but it was fine. I liked this house. 

One day I was looking out my kitchen window. It wasn't confused anymore. Nothing about this was confusing. Just took time to get used to a new house. I did Think about leaving when I first arrived, but I'm home now. I went to bed for the night. I fell asleep thinking why did my mother leave here? Just then I woke up. The ticking was gone? Why was it gone? What happened? I looked around. I wasn't even sleeping on a bed, I was sleeping on the floor. I looked around the room I was in. Everything was gone. I get up, my heart sank as I walked around my house. There was no windows, no furniture, no doors. Only light I had were the bright yellow light bulbs. I couldn't even turn them off. I ran to the front door and nothing was there. The house was completely empty. There was no sunlight and my eyes began to hurt. Only thing left in the house was a picture of a tree on a hill. The only proof I had that the outside world existed at some point. I sat down in the corner of a room, and I cried. I was like a fly. Stuck in a web.

I'm writing this as I desperately need help. My phone could die any minute now and i feel myself going fucking crazy. I don't know where I am. But this is not my home. For the love of god help me.
