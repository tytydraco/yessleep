My name is Henry Johnstone, and I have a confession to make. By the time you are reading this, I will be dead at the age of 98. My grandson, Jules, is helping me write this out as I am on my deathbed. I do not have a lot of time left, so I figured before I leave this world today, I will come out with the truth. 

You may have seen the title of this post and wonder who this is "Bella" I speak of. I am sure there will be some folks who recognise the phrase, "Who put Bella in the Wych Elm?" But for those who don't know, it was part of a series of graffiti about an unidentified murder victim that was forcefully ensconced in a wych elm around Hagley, Worcestershire. Some say she was a prostitute from Birmingham who disappeared three years prior the discovery. Others say she was connected to a German spy is WW2. It was a mysterious and haunting case that had plagued our community since 1943, and to this day, many don't know what really happened, who the culprit was or who this "Bella" was. Well, no one but me. I know the truth, and the truth is that there lies a darker story behind a woman in the tree. And although I do not think it is exclusive to the town of Hagley, I am positive that anyone who has experienced what I have will understand the mutual fear and dread. Perhaps this confession is a cautionary tale of sorts. Perhaps I'm speaking to an empty crowd. Here is the truth.

There was never a "Bella" at all, not that I knew of. The mysterious woman's name was Kornelia. Her last name though? No one ever knew. She was may be enigmatic when she was alive. But as far as I know, she was a Polish woman who fled her homeland by herself during the occupation of Nazi Germany during 1939. Kornelia was... an odd woman to say the least. She was never sociable, and whenever she was, she spoke with a quiet, shy tone. You could distinguish her from the crowd; she was very short (I believe she was around 5'0), had these crooked teeth when she smiled, and wore a golden wedding ring. She was never seen with someone. Kornelia was not an outdoors person, but when she would leave home, it was mostly at nighttime. It was peculiar by that time. 

I did not speak to her as much when I was a young lad. There was not much to speak to her about, and to be honest, I found her a little strange. That was until I started to notice her nightly routine. Some nights, I would look through the window and see Kornelia walk out her front door. I remember she had a candle lantern and she would first look up at the sky. Depending on whatever she saw, she would either stay home or go for a short walk. It had not been too long before a few folks noticed this behaviour, and one day, I volunteered to go confront her. It was the last time I spoke to her.

It was the Autumn of 1941; I was 15 that time. I had visited Kornelia when day broke, and as I arrived at her doorsteps, she looked delighted to see me. She and I were the same height.

"Oh hiya, Henry," she greeted in fluent English. 

"Good morning, ma'am," I replied. "I was wondering if I could talk to you perhaps." When hearing the request, Kornelia seemed a little hesitant. I notice she was caressing her tummy in an anticlockwise motion.

"Is there something wrong I did?" 

"No. Well, not that I say is wrong. I just wanted to talk."

She nodded slowly as if she was thinking. "OK. Come in. Do you want tea of coffee?"

"I'm fine thank you."

The interior of her house was just like any other in Hagley. Nothing out of the blue. That day; it was a bit messier, but who knows. It might have always been that way. I saw photos of her with her family, her as a little girl, and her holding hands with a man. We had never seen her with anyone when she moved here; perhaps she wanted to keep those aspects to herself. I didn't bother asking her that. We both sat on two birch chairs facing each other, and Kornelia grabbed her cup of tea and stirred and drank. 

"So, what is it you wanted to talk about?", she asked as she smiled. She had a tooth missing at the bottom of her mouth. 

"Well, I don't want to come off as rude, but I have been noticing your habit," I said calmly. 

"My 'habit?'"

"Yes ma'am, your habit. You tend to go for a walk at night to do ‘something.’" Her smile faltered a bit. "Is everything alright? Some of the folks have noticed this too."

She stirred the tea again. "Yes dear, everything is fine. I was hoping to keep this a secret." Kornelia looked at me as if she was worried about me. Before I got to ask another question, she stood and went somewhere. "Stay here," she told. "I need to give something to you." I complied and sat, and I waited for her until she came back with a flat box. She sat again and opened the box, and she got out a wooden crucifix. 

"I want you to have this," she said. 

I looked at her, confused. "Why?"

"For protection."

"Protection from what?"

"Henry, do you ever notice how strange the moon is?", she questioned. 

I shook my head. "I don't know what you're talking about."

"The moon. Do you feel as though it's 'watching' you? Like it's some predator hunting you down. Do you ever notice something on the moon?” Her question confused me to the point that I felt uneasy with her. I shrugged. 

"I don't know; not really I guess."

"Good," Kornelia said, as she edged the crucifix to me. "Still, I want you to have this." I glanced at the item, and then the woman. I reluctantly took it.

"I still don't know why I should have this." Then she came out with an odd explanation.

"Look; I'm sure you're not allowed to go out at night, and that may be the best thing your parents did. But if for some reason you find yourself outside, make sure you have the cross. If you see a ring around the moon, run as fast as you can back home. Run home and do not go out!"

I squinted at her. "But why? None of what you said makes any sense."

"It's better not to talk about it further. It knows we're speaking. But this is between you and me. No matter what, do not go outside, Henry," Kornelia told me with this urgency in her voice.
 
“Who’s ‘It?’”, I questioned. She did not answer. “Who’s “It,’ Kornelia.”

“I think I have said enough.” That is all I can remember of the conversation. But needless to say, I left with more questions and a slight apprehension. The conversation was too weird to brush aside. What she was talking about and why she was being so... vague. What was this 'It' she referred to. It was downright peculiar. 

So, I decided to keep an eye on her the more, and that resulted to me following her one night. It was, without a doubt, the greatest mistake I've ever done. Because while I still live to tell the tale, my involvement came at the cost of Kornelia's life. 

One night, I was fully dressed when I saw her coming out her home. She wore a dress with old-timey shoes, and she cradled her belly from the bottom. She held out that familiar lantern, looking up at the sky. Hagley back then was a little more rural, so there weren't many lampposts where I lived, making it too dark to travel. What Kornelia was doing was essentially asking for a death wish. I waited for her to make a move, and once she did, I carefully exited through my window. 

I was outside and was far enough that she wouldn’t spot me. It was cold outside, I remember that. It's strange how fear can make you remember everything vividly. Even to the most minute aspects taken place. I can remember hearing the subtle crunch of the dried leaves, the sound her shoes made when smacking the gravel, and the sound of the wind blowing against me. 

We were walking on the road for 3 minutes until I saw Kornelia hold up the crucifix in the air. It was then I realised I stupidly forgot mine at home. I should have gone home at that instant, but I was too invested in this. I thought there was no turning back from here. I was young and stupid, and I should've known better. So, as she walked, I followed on. A moment later, I realised we arrived at the woods.

As she entered the woods, I started to question what on earth she really was doing. Why is she going in Hagley Wood at night? 'There can't be a good reason,' I thought, while following her. Slowly, I came close to not lose her. 'Is she really being serious? What is the meaning of this?'

Then I remembered the conversation we had. I looked up and saw the full moon. Just like she said, around it was a 'ring.' Nowadays, folks call this phenomenon a 22° halo. But back then, I thought it was some once-in-a-lifetime supernatural occurrence. There was a sense of trepidation that crawled up my spine when I saw it. Without hesitation, I went up to Kornelia. We were about knee deep into the forest.

"Kornelia," I called out, and she immediately turned. Her brows were crossed and her eyes were wide.

"What are you doing here," she hissed. "Why did you follow me?!" I couldn't answer. There was an awkward silence between us. Kornelia quickly looked up and saw the moon and looked at me again. "Do you have your cross?", she questioned.

I shook my head, feeling a little guilty. Kornelia looked around her like she felt she was being watched. She lent her own crucifix to me, forced it in my hand. "You should not be here, you know. We need to go! Now!"

"Why are you going to the woods at night?", I asked. 

But before she could answer, suddenly her mouth was covered with a long silk cloth. Kornelia instinctively dropped her things and did her best to remove the cloth to no avail. The sudden attack made me fall on my ass, and that was where I saw her being lifted by something. Then I saw it. Something hovered behind her with a pair of blinding lights like headlights. Only they were not just lights, they were eyes. White, menacing eyes that pierced right through me. I froze right there, like I was entranced by it.


Then I saw the hulking figure, and I felt all types of fear at that moment. I knew instinctively it was some kind of demon. They say that demons are just little red men with horns and a tail, but I beg to differ. It was white, all white. Its ‘body’ was a huge, draping blanket being blown in the wind. The demon’s head was a skull of some animal; I assume it’s from a cow. Its horns were long and curved.

It towered over me as it choked Kornelia with its solitary tentacle-like strand. While being suffocated, Kornelia pointed at the cross. Noticing this, there was another strand that appeared and wrapped around her arm and snapped it in half. And as painful as it sounded, she couldn't scream. Seeing that, I let out a high-pitched cry as I scurried away from it. That was when the demon flung the unconscious Kornelia to the side like some ragdoll. Its next target was me. 

With haste, I grabbed the crucifix and booked it out of the woods. I felt my heart race, maybe even skip a beat. I ran away from that place like the wind. Whatever that thing was, it would kill me if I didn't reach home. It was not long until I saw the demon chase me with multiple white strands from its bottom outstretched. I raised the crucifix up high, and it stopped at once. 

It hovered there about a few meters from me. I noticed there was this ring around its horns. That was when it all made sense. I looked up at the moon, then at the demon. This was what she meant. The ring. 'It must be some warning,' I thought. But the thing? While yes, it looked otherworldly and frightened, it had this sort of holiness to it. Like a bastardised version of holiness. No, I don't think I can even consider it an angel. I wouldn't even dare.

The thing stared at me for what seemed like a long time. It had no visible mouth, and even then, it never said anything. No noise, no nothing. As I inched backwards, it went back to the woods. It was gone as soon as it came, just like that. I sprinted back home, and everything was a blur after that. 

All I can remember was that, after that point, everyone in Hagley seemed to forget there even was a Kornelia. Like her very existence was just erased from our memories. Her photos were never there. The house she lived in was vacant. I admit I also forgot her, until two years later when the four boys found a skeleton in the wych elm in Hagley Wood. News broke out in the community, and the memory of the night came rushing back to me. Her warning, the moon, that thing. It hit me like a lorry. I never told anyone this, because they would think I am some lunatic.

Then came the graffiti, and the infamous pseudonym that was the talk of the town. At first, it was ‘Luebella,’ then it was the aforementioned ‘Bella.’ There were talks about the victim being a sex worker or a lover of a German spy. How the body being stuffed in the wych elm was a work of witchcraft. Eventually, the case was dropped and the victim was still unidentified. No one even knew who the one doing the graffiti was, but I have no doubt it was it. This was its own twisted way of mocking the victim. 

To this day, I have been haunted with the memory of this forgotten woman. If there was a way I could go back, I would change everything with no second to spare. But if there's one thing I should say, it is that if you see a ring around a full moon, stay inside. Don't go out, no matter what. If it is for a juvenile party or a late-night job, forget it. Nothing is worth the risk. And if it happens that you find yourself outside, just know it will come for you as it came for me.

So, as I lay on my deathbed, I have given you the truth. I know who put 'Bella' in the Wych Elm, and some folks call it the '22° Angel.'
