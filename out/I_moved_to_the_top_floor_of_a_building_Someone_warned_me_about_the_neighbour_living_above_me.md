I had just finished the purchase process of a new apartment on the top floor of a small building after gathering the money for a downpayment for half my life. The first day I was in, I was told to not pay any attention to the neighbour above me.  
  
This was the first red flag I got after the impression I got that the real estate agent was trying to sell the house a little too fast. I was moving in on the first day right after finishing the purchase, when I introduced myself to the bottom floor neighbour, a small elderly lady with glasses as thick as double glazed windows and a dress so long, half of the squirt part was dragging around the floor.  
  
“Don’t make a noise at night” - she said - “You’ll upset the man on the floor upstairs”. Then she scurried away with her sliders scratching on the floor, and told me exactly the same thing when she crossed my path again to get back home. This was probably why I didn’t find it weird - I guess I just thought she was slightly senile or just remembering the last person who lived there.  
  
I was on the third floor, the last one, and it seemed like the apartment on the second floor was empty, so I didn’t have anyone else to ask about the old lady.   
  
The apartment itself was really modern, so when I finally settled in for the first night, I was happy enough to pass out with a smile on my face without being drunk! I’m a very independent female, 30, so you can imagine how having my own place like that could leave me in such a state of peace of mind.  
  
The peace of mind went away a little, when during the night I woke up to strange noises coming from the second floor. There was something like a tap, tap, tap coming from the floor inside my bedroom. I checked the time and it was way too late to be calling anyone about a tapping sound, so I thought I’d call the agent during the next day to find out about any new, unpredicted buyers that might be making a little too much noise.  
  
I had two more days off that I justified at work as what was needed to fully move in, since I was alone, but really, I just wanted to relax a little in my new place and enjoy the freedom. The next day I called the agent, but, you guessed it! He said there was no one living there and there hadn’t for a while and what I heard might just be the pipes for the apartment below settling in due to lack of running water.  
  
With that explanation, I shrugged it off and went about my day. The house was quiet throughout the day, and I spent most of the day putting things away and getting everything ready for some visitors. When I checked my mail for the first official address change letter from the bank, I found the lady downstairs. This time, she stopped me and looked me in the eye with a suspicious look and told me I better not be planning anything, because the man from upstairs would not like it and I didn’t want him to come tell me himself.  
  
I shrugged it off again, feeling a slight chill running up down my spine, but too worried about having everything ready. If I was careful enough, we wouldn’t disturb the lady too much, and I wasn’t planning on going past 3AM anyway. We’d be fine.  
  
That night, I had about 6 people in. It’s a studio, so even with 6 people it felt super cramped and uncomfortable. What saved it was that I met Lewis. He was a good looking, polite guy, my friend’s colleague, and she had insisted he was perfect for me, so we invited him along. I must say, I was agreeing with her. He had a charm about him that, about 1 hour into the conversation, got me thinking about logistics if he were to move in. I had to push the thought away to preserve the independent part in me as much as I could, but at least I got his number.  
  
It was about 1AM, when the woman from downstairs came to knock at my door and asked me once more about the man upstairs who would be very upset if I kept the party going. At this point, I was slightly altered by the drinks we had, and I just told her sure, I would be careful, and slammed the door in her face to go back and keep my conversation with Lewis going.  
  
I’m sure you won’t believe me, but eventually I just had the urge to kiss him before the night was over, and as everyone was leaving and he stayed behind, lingering in our chat, I landed one on him. He seemed surprised, but happy enough to smile and make me feel comfortable about my risk taking.  
  
I spent the days after that between texting with Lewis, doing some shopping for the house, reading by the window while taking in the sunset and exercising in the middle of the room between my bed and my kitchen.  
  
The nights were quiet for a while, not much to worry about.  
  
On the fifth day, I had to go back to work. When I got home, at around 6:30PM and completely shattered, I got a text from Lewis asking if I wanted to go out for dinner. I told him I couldn’t because I was too tired and needed to get ready for the next day. I did not understand his answer.  
  
In one text, the full conversation seemed to screech to a halt.   
  
“But you had your party.” - was what the text said.  
  
My face must have turned into a gigantic question mark, as I stared at the text without knowing its meaning or what I was supposed to say.  
  
I decided to go the safe way.  
  
“I know, it was even better with you there!” - I even added a smiley face. I never use smiley faces!  
  
“I didn’t even say anything, you bitch” - he replied.  
  
What the hell was happening?  
  
I know this was the second, maybe even third red flag and that everyone here is thinking how stupid I must be, but when you’re in the situation yourself you never process things the same way as if you’re a spectator to whatever is happening.  
  
I didn’t know what else to say. Just asked him what he meant, to which he sent a massive laugh and said it was just a joke. It freaked me out enough to turn slightly cold on him for half of the next day.  
  
The worst part was that I was willing to talk to him as normal again and tell him he just freaked me out a little too much with those texts, but everything was ok. I got home, put all my stuff down and texted him, planning to go freshen up right after to get ready for the night in. Some Netflix and chill or a book was sounding pretty good then.  
  
As my text was going out, I thought I heard the same knocking again coming from… somewhere. I perked my ears up to listen for it, but no other sound came, so I went into the bathroom, prepared my toothbrush and started brushing, tilting my head to the side because of the usual weird reflection pattern that mirror had.  
  
My breath stopped, froze in my throat, as for a second, the pattern in the mirror looked like a human face.  
  
As I took one step back to look at it again in a better light, a hand broke through the mirror and shot straight towards my neck. I spit out the foam in my mouth to give space for coughing, as I panicked and went into shock.  
  
Out of the mirror, now with a completely dirty and disgusting look to him, Lewis had just broken into my house through the mirror and I had no idea of what was next.  
  
I fell to the floor, his hand squeezing tighter as he dropped on top of me with a manic smile slashing through his face. He squeezed so hard that as he brought his face closer to mine, full of glass cuts, I thought my neck was about to break.  
  
“No noise in the building, bitch!” -  he hissed next to my ear. - “ You were told not to make noise late at night. I don’t like noise!”  
  
As I suffocated, Lewis’s gaze seemed more and more demented. I managed to hold long enough for him to loosen up the grip, and when he did, I kneed him between his legs, giving me enough time to slide out from under him. My shock was even bigger when I looked at him and he had a knife clutched in his fist while he tried to massage his privates.  
  
The only next thing that occurred to me was to run as far as I could and call the police. I sprinted towards the door, phone in hand and frantically trying to press 911, when the door in front of me shut in my face and I slammed face first into it. I felt my front teeth getting knocked loose and my nose crack across the front, blood invading my mouth so fast that I almost choked on it.  
  
I started coughing, feeling my side bruise when he threw me to the floor into the middle of the apartment and locked my door from the inside behind him.  
  
When I finally got some clarity in my head again, just before he grabbed me by the hair, all I thought was this was not the way I was going. He lifted me up and punched me in the face hard enough to completely knock my loose teeth off, but when he did, I punched back. Accidentally, I hit his chin, which broke my middle finger, but dazed him enough for me to slip away and launch myself out of the window into the fire stairs.  
  
I took the first steps down until I heard him screaming my name from the apartment. I could feel myself losing control of my voice due to the amount of adrenaline and panic surging through me, and all I could do was scream uncontrollably almost to the point of ripping my vocal chords as I stumbled down the metal stairs. I ran to the nearest coffee shop, listening to his footsteps running after me and catching up, and only stopped once I was inside and huddled behind the counter with all the staff and customers asking me what was going on and if I was ok.  
  
Through my blood and pain, I could see he wasn’t among the people approaching me, and when I realised that and my system recognized I was safe, I passed out.  
  
I woke up some days later, in the hospital with bruises all over me and I was told how and why all that happened.  
  
The reason why the real estate agent was trying to sell the house so quickly, was because the building was built to save up on materials, so the walls were made hollow and the mirror in the bathrooms was being used to cover that up. There was a man-sized space behind the walls and between apartments, that would allow random people to crawl through and access other houses.  
  
I think the lady from the ground floor could see Lewis through her mirror as a threat whenever she made any noise at night, and she wanted to warn me about him but couldn’t because of her frail brain. He was upstairs from her and me at the same time, being able to crawl in between all the apartments.   
  
I’m not sure how he managed to convince my friend to invite him to the party, but he also convinced me he was a great guy, husband material, so who am I to question that. All I know now, is that I need to move somewhere else because he was never caught and I’m afraid he might come back to break more than my teeth and my nose. I just hope the next victim isn’t you instead of me.
