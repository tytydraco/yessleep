“Ding dong. Ding dong. Ding dong.” Three disturbing rings. Unsettling pauses in-between each one, about 5 seconds each. This was the first time all of this creepy shit happened and at the time, was what I had prayed would be the one and only time. But, of course… of course… I was WRONG!

Living alone by myself at the age of 18 has always been creepy yet very nice at the same time. The pleasure of not having to worry so much in life and having the freedom to do whatever you really want at home has always been an ultimate bliss to me. On the other hand, it can get a bit freaky at night time, especially at night time. But me being a man, I had grown past that little fear, until the knocking began. 

The weird thing however, was that I live in the middle of nowhere. Legitimately the middle of nowhere. The epitome of being in literally nowhere. So for someone to be ringing my doorbell at the middle of the night, is very rare and has never happened before, so it gave me the chills when it first happened.

Obviously my first instinct was to look out the window that is on the top of the door to see who it is and I did that. But… no one was there. Weirded out, I just dismissed it as a punk teenager or group of teenagers doing the good old classic ding-dong ditch prank. I also did this when I was younger so I understood the joke and left it as it was. I wasn’t in any danger or anything, just some kids pulling harmless jokes to try and scare someone for their YouTube channel to get views on. And that was it for the rest of the night and I went to bed without hearing any more. 

But when this happened, I was very weirded out and had a strange feeling in my stomach. Knowing it was probably just the ding-dong ditch stunt, I still had this unexplained sensation in my stomach. A feeling in which I felt fear but also anger, a feeling like I was gonna throw up. Like one million maggots had been eating away at my guts type of sensation. What if it wasn’t just a joke, what if it was something else, something unknown,  something completely SINISTER!!!

The next morning it was the same old getting up, eating breakfast, and scrolling on my phone texting with my old friends. Completely forgetting about what happened the night before until it just hit me all of a sudden in my memory. I was thinking about it all day even after breakfast that morning. When I would take a shower, when I cleaned the house, when I was driving around town, even when I was on the toilet. It was just lingering in my mind somehow even though I knew it was nothing to worry about. I can’t even tell you how many times I tried to get rid of the thought of it, but every time I did, it enhanced and worsened somehow.

“What the hell Jaron, it was just some silly kids pranking you last night. Nothing more than that. You are a grown man being scared of some punks.” I said to myself in my head. “Get over it and just go and take a walk for a little bit to clear your mind.” 

Listening to myself I follow my own commands and take a quick walk around where I live, complete solitude, peace, and nature as well as the feeling of someone watching me or better… SOMETHING… watching me.

When this weird sensation and feeling that we all have kicked in, I told myself, “nah, fuck that shit, hell no” and I started to speed walk back to my house. When I was doing this however, the thought of the night before was very vivid and kicked in my head randomly. The noise of the doorbell going “ding dong” and the feeling of that feeling in my stomach in which maggots were eating away at my insides, grew back and came back to my harmless, innocent, soul.

Quickly rushing into the door of my house, I slam it shut, and deadlock the fuck out of that shit. This was a rare moment in which I have been very scared to the point in locking everything in my house up. The last time I did this was when I was sure I was being followed by this crazy homeless man that came out from the trees nearby. But it turned out that the poor man just wanted money and was just trying to get money from me. Feeling bad about this interaction but also listening to my guts, I went back out and gave the man 5 bucks. He said, “bless your soul” and smiled as he turned around and walked away. Knowing that he was just asking for money and wasn’t trying to do anything harmful to me was when he walked past my house down the desolate street, looking for someone else to bargain from. 

Feeling silly about that whole thing really made me change a lot and that moment was 2 years ago. I moved out from living with my mom, when I was 16 because of some family issues. I sometimes miss that warm home but also at the same time don’t, a feeling that is hard to explain really.

Anyways, the second time I heard the knocking was during the night again after the night the first knocking was heard. I had just gotten ready to go to bed after pulling an all nighter playing video games. It was 2 AM, so very late at night, or technically the morning for all those dorks out there that wanna correct me, (don’t take it seriously or be offended, I’m just kidding and I love you). 

Getting my bed set up and turning off my light, I hear a faint pounding noise. “thud… thud… thud… Thud… Thud… THUD!!!” 
The last one was extremely loud and startled me I gotta admit.

5 knocks, the first 4 starting off quite than progressively turning loud. I noticed that this time instantly though that it wasn’t any ringing from the doorbell, it was just plain old knocking.

I just waited in my bed silently, acting like a coward with the blanket covering my face, hiding underneath it. In genuine fear, I heard my heart pounding and could feel it. 

“THUD THUD THUD THUD!!!” This time the knocking but very very loud. Extremely loud.

Again… “THUD THUD THUD!”

Then: “THUD, THUD!”

 “THUD!”

*And than complete silence*

“What the actual fucking shit was that!?” I said to myself screaming in my own head. And then I went to bed without even knowing it, drifting off. 

Then I woke up suddenly. Looking at my phones time it showed 2:35 AM. “I had only been asleep for 20+ minutes! Come on, what fucking now?” I said in annoyance and rage. 

“Ding dong ding dong! Thud, thud thud! Hehehehehehhahahhaahhah. Buzz buzz buzzzz! Hahhahahahah! Hahahah! IM GOING TO FUCKING KILL YOU JARON! Hahahahahahah!!! YOU LITTLE SHIT!!! Hahahaha! Time to get murdered! Heheheh! Ding dong ding dong ding dong!!! LET ME INNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!!”

I suddenly woke up again sweating.

*it was only a horrible nightmare!*

Getting out of my bed to get a glass or water to calm myself down from the nightmare, I walk out my room and head downstairs to the kitchen. But than… 

“Ding dong ding dong gggggggg ongggg ongggg!” The last note was long and echoey sounding and it looped around in my head for a long time till it faded away into fucking nothingness!

“I AM GOING FUCKING CRAZY AREN’T I?” I whispered to myself. 

“Ofc you are, aren’t we all?” A voice muttered down the hall. It was coming behind the door. Gently stepping over to the voice to avoid creaking from the wooden floor panels even though whoever was outside heard me, I make my way over to it after grabbing a knife from the kitchen I was in before.

I creep my head up to the window of the door and I first see nothing.

Than…

*a white thing in the corner of my eye, in my peripherals vision.*

Focusing more on it since it is dark I flip on the outdoor light and notice that it is a piece of a paper and it has… writing on it?!. It is a note?! I open the door and swiftly grab it running into the house faster than the speed of light it felt like, and close the door locking it instantly.

“The one who knocks at night, shall never be let in!” The note read. “The one who knocks at night, shall never be let in!” Again same sentence. The one who knocks at night, shall never be let in! The one who knocks at night, shall never be let in!” Over and over again, on every single space on the paper, even on the… EVEN ON THE FUCKING BACK!!!!!!

“What the fuck!” 

Than, 

“THUMP!!! THUMP!!! THUMP!!!

“THUMP!!! THUMP!!!”

“THUMP!!!”

3, 2, 1! It was in order like it was counting down something.

Taking this as some sort of a message I peek over the door to the window and I see a black figure in the distance. A shadow of a human. It looked like a male, about 6 feet tall.

It got closer and I made out a face that looked very familiar. 

MY OWN FACE! 

They were wearing a mask maybe of my face? How did they get that and make it? Have they been stalking me? Who are they? 

All these questions flowing through my puny little mind that had no answer. 

“Leave please or I will call the cops and I have a knife!” I yell out from inside my house. No response just the same knocking again and again.

This time very very very close to my door, I could make out more of the face and…

IT WAS NO MASK THAT HE WAS WEARING.

It was me. It was fucking me!

“Thump, thump, thump.”

“Thump, thump.”

“thump.”

This time the knocks being softer, especially the last one, being barely audible even by being so close to the fucking door! 

I took these knocks as another some sort of message and looked at the note again and notice something.

A doodle of an arrow pointing to the top of the page signaling that I need to look up. On the roof read…

“PS: If it reminds you of someone you know but have never known at the same time, especially don’t let them in, since they shall not be let in, the one who knocks at night!”
