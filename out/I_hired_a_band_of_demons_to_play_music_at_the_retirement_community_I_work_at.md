I'm almost positive that I'm going to get fired. Like, I'm so confident it's happening I've been updating my resume all day. I don't know if it's going to help because what I did was pretty damning...in more ways than one. Ugh, I'm loathed to admit it, but what the hell, it's so weird I might as well come clean. Maybe someone else has gone through this and can help.

I think I hired a band of demons to play for the old folks at our retirement community.

I know it seems insane—and trust me, I'm trying to work my way through it—but after sitting with this, I'm pretty sure that's what happened. I need to say at the outset that this was not my intention. It never crossed my mind that I could ever find a band of demons, let alone hire them to work in an old folks' home. But I'm pretty sure that's what happened.

Let's back up a bit.

I had been hired by "Sunset Estates" about two months ago to be their new "Activities Supervisor." Based on the rather (cruel, I think) name, you can gather that Sunset Estates is a retirement community that caters to 55+ individuals. In reality, though, we are the last stop on the train before graveyard station. Most of our clients are way beyond 55 (truthfully, the younger ones live in more "lively" retirement communities) and require medical care, support, and a sense of community. That's where I come in.

I was not eager to schedule events that people 70 to 90 years old could enjoy. Previously, I worked at a small concert venue in Los Angeles, booking new, emerging talent. Often, our venue was the place that gave these groups their first big break. If I didn't have to sign so many NDAs, I'd have a roster of people we helped shepherd to superstardom—people you know.

But then my mom got sick, and I had to move home. A year later, Mom went peacefully in her sleep, and I was stuck in a town I did my best to run away from. I had run through my savings and couldn't afford to head back to LA. I needed work and needed it soon. Finding a venue for my specific skills wasn't easy. Out of desperation, I answered an ad for this posting and got it.

My plan was to work here six months, save money, get my mom's house sold, and move back to my life in LA. I'm about a month into this plan and have already hit two significant snags. One, I hired demons to play music for old people (which, how many times has that sentence been uttered out loud before?), and two, there was black mold in my mom's house. They've needed to rip up some of the walls, so I've been crashing in a spare room at the Estates. At least until I get fired. Then, well, I guess it's time for the time-honored American tradition of living out of my car for a bit.

Booking for this venue isn't exactly an easy task. Old people are fickle, and trying to gauge what they'll like is as hard as snatching a fly out of the air with chopsticks. It CAN be done, but boy howdy, is it difficult. When I first got there, I had many plans to shake things up and get these old folks moving and grooving. They responded with silence and complaints to management about noise.

It turns out that what old people like is entertainment, which is hardly entertaining. Girl and Boy Scout troops coming in to perform are big hits. A pianist playing standards is a big hit. A bingo caller that enunciates their calls is as good as gold. A local theater production of a jukebox musical? The happiest group of geezers you'd ever see.

This is not the most adventurous group of people known to man.

But they can be critical of everything. Those Scout Troops? Do you know how often I hear the residents call kids ugly or untalented? Whatever you're thinking, double the number. The pianist is classically trained, but god forbid he doesn't know some ancient jitterbug tunes from the 40s. Then he's a hack. Don't even get me started with their comments on the local theater company. On the whole, this job is a lot harder than anyone lets on.

Which brings me to the other day. I had lined up a pretty decent show for my people. First was a well-reviewed ventriloquist named Davis and Woody, his incredible talking doll. He agreed to do the show six times over the next six months if I could get his mom in at a reduced rate (done and done). Next was The Amazing Gilbert – a local magician who had performed for a host of other elder communities and knew the ins and outs of the gig well. He came cheap, too. Finally, I hired Saint Anthony University's acapella group "The Lost Notes" to sing a collection of oldies (and some new songs). They'd been on a local version of America's Got Talent and done pretty well.

While not the most impressive lineup of talent, they'd play well for my assembled crowd. I braced for some incoming complaints - "Magic is a tool of the devil," and "Talking dolls freak me out," and I hate Catholics" (That came from Karl, a curmudgeon to end all curmudgeons), to name a few - but knew that a majority of the people would enjoy the distraction. Or, at the very least, do not complain to me. Both were easy wins in my book.

I had put fliers up all over the Estates. I talked to everyone and told them what was planned. There was a buzz building I'd never heard before. Most of the time, old people will be blunt with you when you ask them questions. They're like kids that way. They've lived their lives and don't care how they come across anymore. It's a wild thing to get used to, and it took me about a week to learn not to take anything personally. It's still a struggle, if I'm being honest.

But I was not getting any pushback for these upcoming evening shows. In fact, the demand was so significant that I asked Julio to put out some extra chairs in anticipation of the big event. Julio was one of the assistants at the Estates and was a great guy. He helped me find my footing when I was hired, especially with our boss, Mary.

Mary was nearing the age where she could conceivably move into the Estates and not be out of place. She was fine, if a little dull, during my interview, and I didn't expect that to change once I got hired. I was wrong. Mary was a grade-A hard ass with a stick so firmly up her backside I think it replaced her spine. She didn't love some of my ideas and was unafraid to tell me. She also balked at my blue-tinted hair and asked that I change it to "A color God would recognize in his creation" when I came in that morning. So, yeah, she sucks.

I felt the pressure to deliver decent entertainment for the masses. Mary's riding me wasn't making it any less stressful. I was already an Emeril's gumbo of raw emotions, and work stress was not the ingredient I needed to add at that moment. So, these bookings and the positive buzz did wonders for my standing at the Estates.

Then, it all started to unravel.

Davis and Woody broke apart. The act was still together, but Woody's mouth snapped off at a kid's birthday and wouldn't be repaired in time for opening night. The image of a dummy with no bottom jaw gave me the shivers, so I said it was fine. I still had other acts.

Famous last words.

The Amazing Gilbert's magic did not keep him from contracting Covid. If he came while recovering, he'd be likely to spread the disease like the Outbreak money, so I told him to stay away until he was all clear. I was internally panicking but was holding on. I still had my ace in the hole waiting. The Lost Notes would blow the doors off the room.

That's when I got the call. The Lost Notes had booked an opening gig for a major touring act and had to cancel their dates with me. I was annoyed but kept my calm. I knew they'd be in more demand when they got off the road and knew it would still be a coup if I could book them later.

But, inside, I was freaking out. I had built up a buzz for a show that was no longer happening. Worse, I didn't know who else I could grab on such short notice that would be as entertaining. I wanted to dig a hole and lay in it. Mary was going to be so far up my ass she's tell me if I had polyps.

I went outside to have a smoke. It was a habit I had re-picked up when my mom got sick. I hated it, but I didn't know what else to do. When you're up against it mentally, you easily slide back into bad habits. I knew I wanted to quit again, but that wouldn't happen any time soon. Once the Lost Notes fuck you over, you can only turn to the Marlboro man.

As I was sucking down the Carolina gold, a beat-up white van came puttering into the driveway. Along the side was an airbrushed picture of a lounge singer with a full brass accompaniment behind him. Above the picture was the name "Del Prado and the Horns-a-Plenty." The driver leaned over and rolled down the passenger window.

"Excuse me," he said, "do you know where the Rumpus Room is located? It's a club."

"Umm, you're like an hour away," I said.

"Rats," the driver said. "We have a gig in fifteen minutes but got turned around."

"Oh, you probably won't make it in time," I said. Then, an idea hit me. "Are you looking for a gig to replace it?"

"Here?" he asked.

"Do you know standards by chance?"

"Hey, Del Prado and the Horns-a-Plenty know everything under the sun and even some things hidden away from its glowing, golden rays."

"Ugh, okay. Look, I know this is an old folk's home, and you guys probably don't play a lot of those, but I need an act in fifteen minutes, and you need a gig. Can we make that work?"

The driver, who I assumed was Del Prado, looked back into the van and spoke with a few of the horns in the back. After a few seconds, he turned to me and nodded. "Where can we park the 'Sin-mobile'?"

I bit my tongue to keep any comments from rushing out. After a beat, I pointed to a loading spot I knew would be empty for the day. "Just right over there."

Del nodded, and I finally got a good look at the man. He wasn't what I would call attractive in any traditional sense. He might be someone's cup of tea, but he wasn't my Earl Gray. He was balding, but instead of just admitting defeat and shaving the stragglers away, he combed over a few sad-looking strands in a vain attempt to cover the bald spot up. His eyebrows were arched in a way that made him look surprised all the time. Which was odd, as his eyes had a sleepy, half-closed look of someone either high as hell or about to crash.

Regardless, if he could sing a little, I was fine.

The band lugged in all of their gear. As they were passing through the lobby, Karl saw them and shook his head. "Who are these guys?"

"Change of lineup," I said, as cheery as possible. "The rest of the gang will be here next week."

"So you sold us a bill of goods?"

"No, Karl, you're still getting top-flight entertainment at rock-bottom prices."

"Rock bottom, pff," he said. "Is he a Croat? I don't trust Croats."

"I think you're fine," I said, dismissing his casual racism. "See you inside?"

"I suppose," he said, pointing his walker towards the entertainment space.

I was about to run to help Del Prado set up when I saw Mary coming down the hallway. I tried to hustle away from her, but she Terminator-walked until she caught up with me. As much as I wanted to, I couldn't pretend she wasn't there.

"Hi, Mary," I said. "What's up?"

"I heard that all of our booked acts dropped out. Did you see the crowds in there? It's bedlam!"

"Yes, the acts did drop out," I said. She started to blanch and was about to launch into a berating, but I cut her off at the pass. "But I found an amazing replacement. They are going to love it. It's a big band that plays standards. It's going to be amazing."

"We'll see," she said, walking off to probably go hex an Eastern European village during her lunch break.

I caught the driver as he was walking back out to the van to grab some of their gear. "I just realized," I said, speaking in low tones, "I don't know your name. I need to know who to pay out."

"You know my name," he said with a smile.

"Is it Del Prado?" I guessed.

He touched his finger to his nose. I nodded. "But, if it's all the same, can we talk about all the money stuff after the show? I need to get into the right head space before I play, and stressing about Earthly shit like cash money just taints the magic recipe, ya know what I mean?"

"Yeah, totally. Artists gotta artist," I joked. "But I've never dealt with one that didn't want to discuss money before their gig."

"Del Prado and the Horns-a-Plenty are a different breed of cat," he said as he reached the back of the van.

"Yeah, well, just so you know, the payout here isn't going to be huge. I know it's not ideal, but," I said, but Del raised a hand and shut me down mid-sentence.

"The payout will be acceptable," he said.

If he was okay with whatever and didn't want to be pushed, I wasn't about to start shoving. If he was mad after, I could always say I tried to tell him ahead of time. But if they did freak out about their payday and spoke to Mary, I'd be screwed.

Before I could respond, he pulled out a massive horn at least seven feet long. It looked like a pipe. It was ornately decorated with carvings of winged figures fighting all down the stem of the horn. There were words carved into it, but they were in some foreign language I didn't recognize. I thought maybe Swiss or something because I thought this was an alpine horn. It seemed a bit much for a traveling lounge act.

"You recreating the Ricola commercials?" I asked.

"What?" Del Prado asked.

"The horn," I said, pointing, "do you use that often?"

"As often as we can, baby-doll. It's really old and makes a crazy sound. It gets people moving."

"If you get these people moving, I'll give you a bonus out of my own pocket."

"Outta sight," Del said, giving me finger guns.

I gunned him back and headed back for the entertaining space. I was stunned at the number of people there. We had a full house. The first I'd ever seen in my time here and maybe the first time ever at the Estates. Hell, even Karl was sitting in the front row. Yes, he looked like he was being forced to push a turnip out of his dick hole, but he was there. That was a win in my book. I allowed myself to think that maybe I had turned this lemon into lemonade.

Fifteen minutes later, Del came to me and told me they were ready. He had three requests for me. The first was to turn off the overhead lights until he said the phrase, "Here we go, baby!". The second was to turn the lights back off for thirty seconds after he said the phrase, "Let's go dark, cats and kittens!" Lastly, he said to make sure that no one left or entered after the show got going. He was weirdly adamant about that fact. Considering his Horns-a-Plenty were bailing me out, I said no problem.

After everyone was all set in the audience, I pulled Julio aside and told him about the doors. "I can't lock them. That's against the fire code."

"Don't get weird with people about it, but suggest they wait until the show ends."

"What if Mary wants in?"

I paused and pursed my lips. "Now that I think about it, maybe we can lock these doors."

Julio laughed and left to go man the doors. After I was sure everyone was here and seated, I took to the stage to introduce everything. I'd taken to doing this for two big reasons. One, it was a visual reminder for our more "Chatty Cathtys" to shush for the show. Two, it was fun and I got a little rush out of it. I always wanted to be a star but lacked the, ya know, talent to do so. This was as close as it got, and I relished it.

And yes, I know how sad that sounds.

"Hey, everyone. How are you all feeling out there?" I said to the crowd.

"These chairs are so harsh on my lower back," Karl said from the darkness.

"I'll ask for some pillows, Karl," I said. "Alright, there has been a change in the lineup tonight, but I think you're gonna love it."

"Of course there was! This country is failing," Karl said, spitting his curmudgeon musk into the air.

It seemed to infect everyone. There were some audible boos and bitching from the crowd, but no one tried to leave. I let the murmurs silence and then continued. "The country might be failing, but you know what never has? A crooner and his big band."

Some of those boos morphed into cheers, and I knew I'd won them back. I glanced to the side of the stage and saw Del standing there, with his back to me, and mumbling to himself. The Horns-a-plenty were standing stock still, instruments at the ready.

"Ladies and gentlemen of Sunset Estates. I present to you…Del Prado and the Horns-a-plenty!"

I scampered off stage and passed by Del. I patted him on the back and was disgusted that he felt damp. Like he was sweating through his suit jacket. I know that sounds impossible, but I once watched Bob Dylan play at an outside venue during the height of summer, and that man turned a blue suit all gray. Still, didn't make it any less gross. Worse, he was muttering with his hands held up to his chest and palms facing the ground.

I left him and heard the first blasting notes of the Horns-a-Plenty. A steady, rising beat bleats out of the trumpets, trombones, and saxophones. Finally, Del Prado turned and slowly strutted to the microphone like a peacock on the march. You could feel the sleaze coming off his herky-jerky strut, but there was nothing I could do now. My job was in the hands of a man I met in our parking lot. 

What the hell was I thinking?

"How are we feeling out there tonight, Shady Acres?" Del asked in a drippy, sappy tone.

"It's Sunset Estates," Karl heckled.

"Even better. The band and I are as cool as a shady spot, but we love the light, baby!"

Nobody really responded. I dropped my head into my hands and took in a deep breath. I was so screwed. I could feel Mary watching from the security cameras, cackling, and setting up a new job posting for my position. I thought, This had to be rock-bottom. I was wrong. So, so, so wrong.


"You all hear those horns? Oh, baby, they are humming! Nah, nah, nah. Those horns are blowing! What are they blowing, baby? Does anyone have a guess?"

I prayed this wasn't going where I feared it was. Del Prado was licking his lips and running his hand through his stringy hair. These aren't the most liberated people on the planet, and if he suggested any kind of sex act, there was a good chance someone in the audience would faint. The thought of having to explain to the family that their grandparent died because someone described a sex act made me feel nauseous.

"They're blowing MINDS! Woo! Ha, ha, all right, all right, all right. Can you feel the beat moving you? Your little piggies in your shoes are tapping. They're making your foot bounce. You know that ankle wants in on the action. Oh baby, now that leg is going, and it's inviting your behind to get going. You feel that in your booty, baby? All right! I think it's time. Horns-a-Plenty, you boys ready?"

The horns stopped. It was quiet, save for a few of the old folks coughing. The horns started up again. Quiet at first but slowly building to a crescendo. I was deafening. I heard Del count off to four and then scream, "Here we go, baby!"

That was the phrase I was waiting for. I assumed the light could only make this whole spectacle worse, but I had promised to help. I sighed and flipped on the switch. I closed my eyes, not wanting to see my mistakes in person, but was surprised when I heard clapping.

I opened my eyes and saw Del grab the mic and shimmy around on stage, singing Irving Berlin's classic "Blue Skies." His moves didn't match the song's melody, and I felt embarrassed for him, but the crowd was eating it up. Even Karl was clapping and singing along. I saw him actually smile.

I allowed myself to smile, too. Had I pulled this off? Was I not only going to avoid being fired but, perhaps, earn a raise? Had I just discovered the next old folk home superstars? I was already booking Del Prado and the Horns-a-Plenty for another gig in my brain when I watched Del reach into his pocket and grab something that I hoped wasn't attached to his body.

Again, I was worried about where this was going, but then he threw his hand up, sending what looked like baby powder into the air. It rained down on the people in the front row, and none seemed too pleased at first. I braced for Karl to break into a swearing rabbit hole and ruin everything. But that didn't happen.

Instead, they all stood up and started clapping and dancing.

Del started scatting along to the song, and the people dancing got more animated. Karl was doing a jitterbug like his bones weren't made of graham crackers and looked like he was having a blast. Next to him, ancient Ester Buchanan started swinging her hips like a twenty-year-old at a South Beach club. Opal O'Mara, Dennis Planchette, and Jimmy "Devil Dog" Oscar followed suit. Each step was a bit more provocative than the last. Soon, the old people were grinding on each other and dancing. Del was screaming nonsense scat words into the mic, and the room was rapt at attention.

I glanced back over at Julio and he was doubled over in laughter. We locked eyes and I raised my hands like, "Should I stop this?" He just shrugged and kept laughing. I couldn't help it – I started laughing too. I didn't know Irving Berlin hit this generation that hard, but here was proof.

A voice from the back yelled, "What's gotten into you fools? This is very inappropriate!" It was one Ollie Jacobs, one of our more conservative residents. He shuffled toward the stage (his left leg was about an inch shorter than his right, thanks to an old motorcycle accident) and grabbed Karl by the shoulders. "Snap out of it, man! You hate dancing! When they hired that Zumba instructor, you said her gyrating hips were a tool of the devil!"

"Feel the groove, Ollie, baby!" Karl said, taking off his shirt and twirling it around his head. Soon, the other dancing people in the front row were stripping off clothes. I hadn't anticipated seeing skin when this show started and felt panic race through my body. I had to try to stop this, or I would lose my job.

I looked over at Julio for help, but he had collapsed to the ground, his body racked with laughter. I knew this was funny, but not that funny. Julio needed this job as bad as I did and wouldn't jeopardize it for a joke.

The Saxophone player put down his horn and walked back into the darkness of the stage. He re-emerged, wheeling in the alpine horn and setting it up on stage. Del pulled out more baby powder and stuffed it into the pipe end of the horn. I started making my way to the stage when Del ran to the mouthpiece, took a huge breath, and blew into the alpine horn.

A cloud of baby powder blew high into the air. The ceiling fans helped spread the dust, sending it falling down on everyone in the crowd, myself included. I watched it shimmer in the lights and remembered that baby powder doesn't shimmer. What the hell was this stuff?

As it touched my skin, my desire to stop the illicit (but hilarious) dancing seeped out of me. Why did I care if some old folks got freaky in the common room? What's the worst that could happen? They'd feel joy for a minute or two? I stopped my movement forward and headed back toward the light switch.

"I can feel the love out there. How about you boys?" Del asked his horn section. They didn't respond; they just kept playing.

I slumped back against the wall and felt dizzy. My head was swimming. I kept feeling like I should stop this. I knew I would lose my job if I didn't, and oh my gosh, I did not need to see dozens of gray geezers strip down to their skivvies and dance. But then, those feelings would disappear and be replaced with an apathetic malaise.

"I know the first row knows how to get funky, but what about the room? Can you scream for me, Shady Acres!"

"It's Sunset Estates," Karl yelled but laughed while doing so. But who cares?" Everyone else in the room (save for Julio and me) let out a scream and rose to their feet. Canes and walkers were thrown to the ground, and people moved like they hadn't in thirty years.

"What's happening?" I mumbled to myself. Del Prado was lapping this all up. As I stared at him, he locked eyes at me and gave me a wink.

Soon, shawls, shirts, and pants joined the canes and walkers on the floor. Not long after, underwear, support hose, and bras joined the pile. In the blink of an eye, the room had gone from an audience of distressed people waiting to speak at a city council meeting to the playroom at a swinger's club.

In front of me, dozens of naked old people danced with reckless abandon. It was eye-bleaching material, but my brain couldn't get my face to turn away. The sheer amount of shaking skin flaps made it seem like dozens of elephant ears were waving in the breeze. Gravity-beaten appendages of both sexes twirled and shimmied all around the room. The noise of the flapping and slapping skin cut through the music.

"I have to do something," I said, finally able to turn my head away. But that was all I could muster. My brain was losing a battle with itself, and I didn't understand. I glanced over at Julio, who was now lying stock still on the ground near the door. He looked like he was sleeping….or at least I hoped that's what had happened.

"I love the energy in here. Dance like it's an affront to your creator!" Del yelled. The crowd yelled back and shook their dangling parts at the sky. Del laughed. "Yeah, babies. Now shake those bits for your Dark Lord! He loves the sound of sin!" The old folks did as they were asked and cranked their bodies toward the ground. They laughed and smiled and crashed into each other.

Karl helicoptered his junk around and screamed, "I needed this!" Before long, Opal, Ethel, and Ollie had their hands all over him.

"Let's go dark cats and kittens!" Del yelled.

That was the second phrase I'd been waiting for. I didn't want to, but I felt my hand reach up and shut the lights off. The room was pitch black, but you could still hear the noise of sloppy kissing and skin flapping. While that was disturbing in its own right, what happened next was a million times worse.

"It's time to go home, baby! Time to go where you belong! You ready?" Del screamed into the mic. The crowd cheered and begged like they were at a religious revival. The horns started playing again, just one long note that grew in intensity. The music sent the crowd into a frenzy.

"Take me home, Dark Lord!"

Del blew into the alpine horn again. This time, a blinding white light shot out of the horn and started circling around the room. As it moved, it created a strong breeze, and before long, it felt like we were standing in the middle of a tornado. The laughs and joyful jubilee screams morphed into screams of agonizing pain. I watched as white human shapes were wrenched away from the naked, writhing bodies of the elderly and joined the whirling white mass on the ceiling.

As soon as the spirit (maybe?) separated from their flesh, you could hear the old person hit the floor with a sickening thump. I slumped to the ground, closed my eyes tight, and put my hands to my ears. I needed to block out whatever the hell was happening all around me.

"Thank you all, and goodnight!" Del screamed as the horns quickly cut off. The lights turned themselves on. I opened my eyes. The stage was empty. It was like Del Prado and the Horns-a-Plenty had never been in the room.

Then I saw the pile of naked old people on the floor.

"Oh shit," I said. I rushed over to the nearest old lady and touched her shoulder. She was alive and slowly stirred awake. She looked at me and blinked. Her eyes looked dulled, but she was alive.

"Joanie, are you okay?"

"Yes," she said. I helped her up, and she looked for her clothes to get dressed. She didn't comment on anything or ask why she was naked or why everyone was lying on the ground.

Everyone started to stir and go about finding their clothes. As I watched them, I noticed how all of their eyes looked lifeless and dull—like doll eyes. No one asked any questions, no one complained, no one did anything. It was like the intervening twenty minutes hadn't happened at all. Karl didn't even say a word as he finally—mercifully—put his underwear back on.

I ran over to Julio, who had sat up and helped him stand. He looked at me and shook his head. We saw that, right? The, the," he leaned close and whispered, "the nakedness?"

"Yeah," I said. "What the fuck was that?"

"I dunno," Julio said, "but I have a powerful need to go to church."

Just then, the door to the room opened. Mary was standing there. I felt my body run cold. She took in the scene and nodded. "We need to talk later," she said to me. She wasn't mad or happy or anything. She seemed...reserved.

Her eyes looked dull, too.

"About the show?" I asked.

"About the show," she confirmed before turning away and leaving.

I ran to the parking lot and didn't see Del Prado or his van. In fact, there was no evidence that anyone had been there at all. When I asked some other employees about it, they all had no idea what I was talking about. It was like their minds had been wiped.

But something that probably isn't wiped away is the security camera footage. I knew it was just a matter of time before Mary checked those, and then things would get real. Not to mention how the old folks who had been there suddenly moved and acted like they were just waiting for the clock to run out. It was as if whatever had infected them had sapped their life force.

They were mere husks of what they had been...and what they had been were already husks of their former selves. 

Julio and I feel physically fine, but this whole thing has taken a toll on us mentally. We're helping each other try to piece together what happened, but we're coming up empty so far. I searched for Del Prado and the Horns-a-Plenty online, but no such band exists. It was like they were sent here by someone.

In my gut, I know who, but to say it out loud might shatter my brain completely. I was holding onto my sanity by a thread and didn't think bringing out a pair of sheers was wise. Regardless, I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop. Please let me know if you've ever heard of Del Prado and his band.

And, hey, if you know of a good job opportunity, I could use that information too.
