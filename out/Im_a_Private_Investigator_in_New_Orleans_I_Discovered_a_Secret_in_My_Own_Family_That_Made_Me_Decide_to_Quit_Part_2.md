The morning sun filters through the shutters of our office in the French Quarter, casting long, dappled shadows on the worn wooden floor. The faint hum of jazz from a nearby club and the distant chatter of tourists lend a semblance of normalcy to the room.

Yet, that normalcy is tainted with tension. Reine and I had another spat this morning over how she rearranged the office supplies. Something about her needing the space on the desk for "personal matters" which she didn't clarify. But these days, it feels like those little annoyances are the only constants in our relationship. The lighthearted teasing and warmth we shared last night at the Tet dinner feels like a distant dream. The return to our day-to-day life brings the same petty, inconsequential bullshit arguments back on the menu. A heavy sigh escapes my lips. Is this the new norm?

The desktop pings, bringing me back to the present. The background report I requested on Xuan is in. A quick skim reveals no major red flags. Mostly details about his life I know already. He's an accomplished quantum physicist, respected in his field, and a prominent lecturer at Tulane. No arrest record.

Another detail surfaces that tugs at a personal chord within me; Xuan came to America as a refugee at the tender age of six. His family were boat people, escaping the aftermath of the Vietnam War. My own parents were boat people. I've grown up listening to their stories, feeling their silent pain. The horrors Xuan must have witnessed, I can't even begin to imagine. What that does to a person's soul...

One random detail does catches my eye though: he’s a member of some sort of academic organization, full of leading scientists and engineers. 'Nexus Consortium.’ The name sounds innocuous enough, but my gut tells me it's worth digging deeper.

I shut down the computer. And just as I'm getting up, Reine looks over, her eyebrow raised in that inquisitive manner I've grown fond of. "Where are you off to in such a hurry?"

Clearing my throat, I craft a believable excuse on the spot, "Got a lead on the Landry case. I need to head over to Algiers. Might take me most of the day."

She narrows her eyes. "Want some company? The more the merrier."

"Don't you need to go over the forensics for the Thibodeaux break-in? The evidence bag with the lock?" I remind her, hoping she won't push it further.

A thoughtful expression crosses her face. "Oh, right," she murmurs, her gaze drifting towards the large file on her desk.

Guilt gnaws at me. I hate lying to her, especially when it feels like the walls between us are growing taller every day. "Hey," I begin, my voice softer, "sorry about earlier. About the whole desk thing."

She offers me a small smile, her gray eyes locking onto mine, "It's okay. I overreacted. I just...I've been needing space lately."

I chuckle, "You always have your quirks."

She smirks, the hint of mischief back in her eyes. "Speaking of which, can you get me a bánh mì with extra pickled daikon and jalapeños while you’re out?”

I raise an eyebrow at the oddly specific request but agree with a light laugh. "Craving the heat, huh?" I tease, not suspecting the deeper undercurrents of her desires.

“Yes, and make it snappy, Detective Tran,” she says with a playful wink, the momentary thaw in our [chilly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baUKK0y48QE&t=2990s) morning interaction bringing a fleeting comfort.

Her eyes searched mine, but I held her gaze steadily. "Oh, and one last thing..."

"What is it?" I ask, already heading to the door.

"Just... be careful, okay?" she says with a touch of sadness in her voice.

"I always am," I replied, leaning over to press a quick kiss to her cheek.

Before leaving the office, I take a few extra precautions. I put my phone on airplane mode to prevent any location tracking and use a burner phone. I also decide to take the back roads, avoiding the main streets where I may run into someone we know.

The drive is nerve-wracking, my mind oscillating between worries about Xuan and guilt about deceiving Reine. I try to focus on the investigation at hand. My first stop is Xuan’s apartment.

As I park my car a block away from Xuan’s Uptown apartment complex, my burner phone buzzes with a new text message. It’s from Kira. I gave her this number just in case we need to keep in contact.

"Stay safe, anh."

My fingers hesitate over the keys, searching for the right words. Finally, I type back: "I will, I promise." Simple but to the point.

As the late morning sun casts its glint over the picturesque Uptown apartments, I spot Xuan stepping out of the complex. He's dressed casually, his attire suggesting nothing out of the ordinary. Still, the unease from last night’s video hasn’t left me.

I give him a head start before starting my car, making sure I don’t draw any attention. He makes his way to a nearby coffee shop, and I park a little further down, choosing to watch from a distance. After ordering what seems to be his regular morning caffeine fix, he leaves, seemingly lost in his thoughts.

Throughout the day, I shadow Xuan from one location to another, always maintaining a discreet distance. There’s a predictability to his movements — a local market, the university, a gym, and then a bookstore. On the surface, everything appears perfectly normal. But with every passing hour, I can’t shake the feeling that something's off, almost as if he's masking something beneath the mundane.

While Xuan is in a diner grabbing lunch, I take the opportunity to make some notes on the day’s observations. Distracted, I barely register the soft knocking on my car window until it becomes more insistent. Startled, I look up, my heart sinking when I see Reine's face, her eyes flashing with a mix of confusion and anger.

"Espèce d'enculé!" (You fucking asshole!) she spits, her voice is sharp, unyielding. She only brings out the R-rated French when she's really mad.

My mind races, scrambling to assemble a plausible excuse. “I, uh...” I stutter, failing to form a coherent sentence.

She opens the car door, her eyes scanning the dashboard cluttered with notes and the map highlighting Xuan’s routes. “Why are surveilling your ex-brother-in-law? Are you out of your fucking mind?”

“How did you—” I begin to ask.

“The burner phone, Ash,” she interrupts, exasperation tinting her voice. “You left the box in your trash bin. I checked with Abby. You’re not working on the Landry case. Also you left your email logged in. I saw the background check you requested on Xuan. ”

My face flushes with a mix of embarrassment and frustration. I was careless, made rookie mistakes. The first was believing that I could outwit a former NOPD detective who knows me better than anyone.

She slides into the passenger seat, her presence filling the confined space, making it feel even smaller. The weight of her disappointment anchors me to the seat, a visceral reminder of the rift between us. My initial instinct is to salvage the situation with more lies, but the look in her eyes stops me. She deserves the truth.

I try to lighten the blow, a weak attempt to assuage the growing tempest in the car. "Look, Reine," I mutter, reaching into the backseat and holding up a paper bag, "I got your bánh mì. Just the way you like it." The gesture is pathetic and insufficient for the weight of the situation, but it’s all I have.

She stares at the bag, her features hardened but flickers of [hunger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLE0P3hr8ZY&t=8484s) pass in her eyes. “Did you get it the way I wanted?” she asks in a controlled voice, maintaining the storm within.

I nod. “Extra pickled daikon and jalapeños.”

She still looks beyond pissed but snatches the bag from my hand with a resigned sigh. “You have until I finish this sandwich to explain yourself.”

I nod, watching as she unwraps the sandwich. She takes a bite, never taking her eyes off me. I feel like I’m under a microscope, about to be dissected. “Kira asked me to check on Xuan,” I admit.

"So, you're spying for your sister now?" She shoots back. "Let me guess, she thinks he's seeing another woman?"

I can’t help but let out a soft chuckle, even in the seriousness of the moment. We had both jumped to the same initial conclusion. Great minds.

“No, nothing like that. She’s genuinely worried about him,” I insist.

I reach over and grab the tablet from the glove compartment, hitting play on the hidden phone video Kira captured of Xuan.

Reine’s eyes widen as the video plays, the sandwich in her hand momentarily forgotten. As the screen is filled with the pulsating and shimmering form of the eldritch horror, the bánh mì slips from her grasp, splattering condiments on the dashboard and floor.

"Sainte mère de Dieu…" (Holy Mother of God…) she whispers, her voice trembling. The stern, controlled demeanor she held just moments ago shatters.

She turns to me, her face pale, her voice trembling. “What the hell is that, Ash? How can something like that even exist?”

I look down, the weight of my decisions weighing heavy on my shoulders. “I don’t know, but that’s why Kira is worried about Xuan. She thinks he’s gotten himself involved in something... otherworldly.”

“You think?!” Reine’s voice rises in disbelief and fear. “And you thought you’d face this alone? Without telling me?"

My mouth goes dry. I'd anticipated the backlash from my earlier lie, but facing her raw emotions now, it felt different. "Kira made me promise not to tell you," I mutter, ashamed of my excuse.

Reine's eyes darken. "She did what?"

"Kira didn't want to involve you," I explain, my voice barely audible as the guilt churns within me. "She wanted to keep it between me and her.”

The reality of my choices is like salt in an open wound. I can see the hurt in Reine's eyes, layered with fear and anger. This isn’t the kind of relationship we’ve built. We are partners, in every sense of the word. We’re supposed to carry burdens together, yet here I am, dropping the weight of the universe onto her, unprepared and unannounced.

Just as Reine is about to respond, her eyes flicker to something outside. The words freeze on her lips, and her gaze hardens as she intently looks out of the window. I follow her gaze, my heart immediately lurching into my throat.

Through the diner window, we see someone slide into the booth next to Xuan, a woman with striking platinum blonde hair, dressed in a crisp, tailored suit. The intensity of her pale blue eyes even visible from this distance. There’s an elegance about her, but it’s [cold](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/14c93t1/im_an_arctic_researcher_we_accidentally_released/), calculated, and she holds herself with an authority that seems almost uncanny.

My hand darts to the glove compartment, pulling out the laser microphone we'd used in countless past investigations. The contraption looks like a binocular, but it's specifically designed to pick up vibrations from glass panes, allowing eavesdropping from a distance. Pointing the device towards the diner window, I adjust the frequency, trying to tune in to the conversation inside.

Reine looks at me with wide eyes, aware of the gravity of the situation. "What are they saying?" she whispers.

I hand one of the earbuds to Reine, and she hastily inserts it into her ear. We can just make out snippets of the conversation inside the diner. The audio is not perfect, the ambient noise from the street making it harder to discern the words, but we hold our breath, straining to listen.

A crystal-clear voice breaks through the ambient noise. “... Ms. Lockhart, I trust the preparations for the Void Whisperer are on schedule?” Xuan's muffled voice comes through.

The woman’s tone is refined, with a clipped British accent, a stark contrast to the rustic diner setting. “Yes, Dr. Xuan. Everything is prepared. In two days, the world will know of Lửa Đen.”

My mind races at the mention of the ominous name, Lửa Đen, the Black Fire. What is Xuan getting himself into? What is the Void Whisperer?

Both Reine and I lean in, as if physically getting closer would somehow make the fractured conversation clearer through the earpiece. The woman's voice is calm, but there's a steely undertone that sends shivers down my spine.

"... His flames will bathe the world in darkness and from the ashes, a new era will rise…" Xuan's words come through the earpiece, a mix of fervor and devotion in her voice.

Reine and I exchange worried glances. "Is this some kind of a cult?" she whispers, her voice quivering. The concern in her eyes mirrors my own.

The conversation continues, fragments of words and phrases filtering through the static interference of the earpiece. Xuan's voice comes through again, sounding almost distorted and unsettlingly distant.

“...I-I’m not sure,” Lockhart's voice trembles through the earpiece, the uncertainty clear. “Is there no other way?”

“There is no room for doubt, sister. We are the harbingers of a new eon. Each one of us must be willing to sacrifice everything on the altar of the Dark Flame.” Xuan urges, his tone chillingly gentle.

"Sacrifice?" Reine mouths silently to me, a line of worry etching her features. The questions multiply in my mind, each one more disturbing than the last.

There's a pause, and the muffled sound of Xuan's deep, shuddering breath filters through the ambient noise. “I understand, Dr. le,” she concedes, a hint of despair in her voice. “Nothing can stand in our way. I apologize for my moment of doubt.”

The conversation between Xuan and Lockhart continues, but their words become harder to discern. They talk in hushed tones, whispering about arrangements, people in place, and a device capable of breaching barriers beyond human comprehension. It’s a puzzle, each piece more intricate and confusing than the last.

We see the pair lock hands across the diner table. Their grip on each [other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGd1F6Ay8ho) is firm, their fingers intertwining, as though they were a couple in an intimate embrace. They shut their eyes in unison, their brows furrowing in intense concentration.

Just then, the scene inside the diner blurs for a split second as if distorted by a sudden heatwave. In that fleeting moment, a terrifying vision replaces the mundane backdrop. Lockhart transforms, her human visage giving way to a skeletal figure shrouded in ethereal darkness, whispers of shadows swirling around her. Xuan's face is now marked with strange, arcane symbols, glowing a harsh, luminescent blue against his skin. The once buzzing diner is filled with spectral figures, their twisted forms locked in eternal agony.

The world snaps back to normal as swiftly as it changed, leaving me gasping for breath, gripping the car's interior for support.

Reine’s face is white as a sheet. “Did you see that?” I feel her hand clutch mine, her grip tight with fear and anticipation.

“You saw that too?” I reply, my heart pounding against my chest like a frantic drum.

The silence in the car is heavy as we watch Xuan and Lockhart leave the diner. They go their separate ways, a casual observer would think nothing of the meeting.

But we know differently. We stumbled into a web far more intricate and dangerous than we could ever imagined. There's no turning back now.
