I awoke with my tongue stuck the roof of my mouth, so I went to my basement to get a drink. Some of you may be confused as to why my kitchen is in my basement, so here's a quick layout. At the front door area is my living space, to the right is my room with a bathroom inside and to the left is my laundry room and garage door. Down In the basement to the right of the stairs is the kitchen, and to the left is the dining area/game room

Back to the story, I was filling up a glass when I saw a spider next to the fridge, so of course I crush it. As I was going upstairs to flush it, I saw two more spiders in the bathroom. After getting rid of those I went back to my morning business. As I hastily made my morning coffee before going to work, I saw yet another spider, this time crawling up one of the cabinets. Finally I decided that if is saw any more spiders after work, I would consider hiring an exterminator. Since I work as a psychologist, I wasn't home till about 10:30 pm.

As I opened the front door, I hear audible scuttling from the downstairs kitchen. This immediately caught my attention since even if there were a dozen spiders, I wouldn't hear them. Descending down the steep stairs into the now cold kitchen, I flicked the light on and it illuminated a horrid sight. I reeled in disgust and utter horror. At least 3 dozen or so spiders where crawling in and out of my vent, making that horrid cacophonous sound of writhing limbs. I was upstairs within seconds, not wanting to see those horrific beings any longer. I Immediately called to set up an extermination appointment, but it was to late to set one up. I fell into my bed like a felled tree, stomach growling like a wild tiger.

The next morning I called to set an appointment for an exterminator to come deal with the spider infestation, which was set to 8 am the following morning. I dragged my tired body to work, running of nothing but my will to make money. I got home and immediately went to bed, not even fathoming venturing down into the infested basement. 

That morning, I awoke to rhythmic knocking, letting me know the exterminator was here. "Mornin' sir!!" Greeted the exterminator as I opened the door. "Where's the critter problem?" She inquired "the basement." I mumbled, barely able to stand due to exhaustion and running off of McDonald's. "I'll get right to it!!" The exterminator gleefully exclaimed, practically trotting down the steps. About 5 minutes later, the exterminator hollered," seems the problem here is inside your air conditioning system, you mind of I take a look??" " Go ahead." I weakly hollered.

I awoke several hours later, scolding myself for falling asleep while I had company. I went down to the basement to check if the exterminator was still there, but she was gone. I was about to go back up, with a smug grin knowing those horrid arachnids got what was coming for them, when I noticed her backpack was still upstairs, now missing the long hose and some spray. I began frantically hollering for the exterminator, worried that perhaps she got stuck, when she responded from the laundry room," don't get worked up lil' guy, I'm just decontaminating the garage!" "Lil guy!" I thought to myself angrily, as I precariously walked down the the kitchen to grab a drink and a snack. "By the way, instead of calling me "exterminator" you can call me Lucy" startled, I turned to see the exterminator, now dubbed as Lucy, grinning. "I took care of the garage first since that's where the origin of the infestation was, so now I'm gonna go into the crawl space to get rid of the real problem. So give me a holler if ya need me anywhere else!" Exclaimed Lucy, way more excited about the job than I expected most exterminators to be.

After finish the 9th episode of house MD on prime video several hours later, I decided it was time to check on Lucy. I went downstairs, and saw that the crawlspace was still open. I hollered her name, but it didn't elicit a response. I tried a few more times, before deciding to take matters into my own hands.

I grabbed a flashlight from the counter and climbed into the dank space. The roof of the crawlspace was about 4 feet from the ground, giving me a decent amount of wiggle room. As I ventured through the space, I kept calling for Lucy, sucking musty air into my lungs each time. About 10 feet in, I found the center area, where I was greeted with a horrid stench and a visceral sight. I gawked at the mountain of webs, covered in thousands of spiders, making audible clicking noises. I recoiled in pure shock, regaining my composure seconds later. I then moved my flashlight across the mound, eventually finding the source of the vile stench. I Immediately noticed the telltale blue collar on the neighbor's missing cat, though the rest of the body looked like a mummified corpse covered in webbing.

After turning and fleeing the crawlspace and entering the basement, I began to think of a plan of action, but my thoughts were slowed by the horrid images of that mound and that poor cat. I decided the best plan of action was to call the police, and soon after they arrived I explained the situation in more detail. After gathering basic information from me, they went down to the crawlspace to begin a search for Lucy. About 15 minutes after they began searching, I stopped hearing their voices. Now, at first I thought they had found Lucy, but after not appearing for a while, I got worried. I ventured back into the crawlspace, searching every spider infested corner, but I found nothing. Just as I was turning back, I saw a hole about the size of a person burrowed into the wall. After some consideration, I went in thinking that's where Lucy and the two officers went.  Saying the tunnels where dank, moist and suffocating is a massive understatement. Roots where poking out of every wall of the tunnel, and the rough ground tore hungrily at my shirt. 

After what felt like half an hour of navigating this maze-like structure, I found a massive open area. The walls were supported by what looked like pillars of web, and the roof had a strange pattern of web covered lumps. In the corners of the room where piles of bones, weathered and yellow from years of decay. Finally, at the center of it all, was an absolutely Titanic pile of webbing, dwarfing any small home. There where holes scattered across the mound, where hundreds of spiders where entering and exiting. Some holes where the size of a doorway, while others where the size of a rat.

To top it all off, at the base of this were the "remains", if you could even call them that, of the two officers and what looked like Lucy. I held back a gutteral scream, mortified by the scene before me. I practically zipped back through the tunnels, looking for any exit I could possibly find.

After what felt like hours of searching, I finally found an exit. Dirtied and frazzled, I scrambled out on to the surface, thanking God that I found an exit out of that hell hole. I am now in my house sitting on my couch typing this out, I still don't know what to do about this. Could any of you in the comments possibly tell me what I can do about this? I will keep you updated but for now, I will try to sleep tonight and hopefully wake up.
