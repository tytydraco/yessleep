Heya folks, just wanted to say I’m probably going to jail.

Not really my fault, but heck, shit happens.

Pretty sure I did everything just right, everything that I could. Oh well.

So, uh, to begin, I’m from a small town in Montana. Like, real small, right up by Canada, lots of mountains, a national park, you know the kinda place.

Now, my best bud is (or was, I guess) Billy. Now, Billy’s Dad and my Dad were friends when they was kids, so me and Billy have (had) grown up together. Closer than brothers, thick as thieves.

Man, I wish he hadn’t had his head blown off.

Anyways, my Dad and Billy’s Dad used to have this tradition for a couple years when they was young. In the winter, during deer season, they’d take a bunch of guns, deer tags, booze, fireworks, and food up to this cabin in the mountains, get wasted, and spend a few days hunting and blowing off steam.

Now, me and Billy had been planning to re-enact the trip since we were about fifteen. Only complication is that I went and got myself a girlfriend. Now, I love Jenny, but this was supposed to be a boys only trip. She put her foot down, though, said someone needed to keep an eye on us.

She also may have questioned the nature of mine and Billy’s relationship, and implied we were going to the cabin to explore each other’s bodies more than the mountains.

Now we're pretty open-minded folks, but reverse psychology like that is extremely effective on a pair of young men who live in a rural, god-fearing community, so we agreed to let Jenny come along.

So, near Christmas, I snuck out of the house into the bracing snow, got in my car, (which I had already filled with supplies when Dad was at work) and made my way to the gas station, where Jenny and Billy would be waiting.

Billy was there first, a towering gorilla-like figure with a few long bags, a big smile beaming at me from beneath his beard.

“Heya bud,” he said, slinging the bags in as he clambered into the car. It was already a tight squeeze just with my stuff.

“Hey hey.” I said. “You brought the good stuff?”

“Hell yeah, I—“

“What the hell is this?” A new voice called.

I leaned out, and there was Jenny. She looked beautiful, even with her big snow jacket and ski pants on.

“Hey hey, gurl. What’s the problem?” I called, a bit unsettled by the edge in her voice.

“You said a truck. I thought you were gonna borrow your Dad’s.”

I looked at the steering wheel.

“What’s wrong with the Neon?”

They weren’t bad little cars. A bit under-powered, especially the 1.6. And I guess they are front wheel drive. And then there’s the 3-speed, which does slip a lot, and sometimes the electrics short out the engine. But other than that, it’s a pretty good car.

“You really want to drive up to a cabin you’ve never been to, in the dark, in the snow and ice, in a fucking Dodge Neon?” Jenny asked, sounding not quite happy with me.

“It’ll be fine. It gets us to and from school, don’t it?” Billy added.

Jenny swung open the rear door, chucking in her backpack and sitting on top of it. “School ain’t up a damn mountain.”

I shrugged, yanking the stick into drive, and we set off with a lurch up the dark and snowy road to the mountains.

“Didn’t bring your phone did you?” Billy said, craning round to grin at Jenny.

“No, you said not to.” She said. “And what’s the deal with that? No reception up there?”

“Probably is.” I said, keeping my eyes on the road as it snaked ever upwards. “But back when our Dad’s was young, they didn’t have phones. Just did it all with paper maps.”

Billy chuckled. “That’s right, proper men, back then, just a couple of dudes living wild.”

Jenny kicked the back of my seat real hard, and she glared at me in the mirror from behind her black curls.

“You seriously mean we haven’t got one cell phone between us?”

I smiled at her vicious expression in the mirror.

“That’s right,” I say, “we’re gonna do it just like they did back in the day.”

Me and Billy exchanged a triumphant grin.

“So how the hell are we getting there without Google maps? You have a paper map, then?”

Mine and Billy’s expression fell instantly.

“I can’t read a map.” Billy said.

“I can but I didn’t have one. I’m sure it’ll be fine. After all, how hard can it be to find a cabin on the mountain?”

 

………

 

So, turned out finding a cabin on a mountain after dark when the snow started coming down hard was actually pretty tough.

Got even tougher further up, cause the Neon kept sliding and slipping. It was getting real hard to make headway. Luckily, we had the heaters on full blast, so it was plenty warm inside.

I just wish I’d remembered to fill it up when we met at the gas station. That had been the whole point.

We were probably a good twenty or thirty miles up into the mountain when the car slid on ice and the engine died, all at once. Thankfully it was on a blind corner, so I wasn’t going fast enough to flip it.

It did get stuck deep in a snow drift, though. We could open the driver’s side doors, but everything in the trunk was stuck there. Once Jenny had finished berating me and Billy stopped laughing, I yanked open the door, telling everyone to get out.

“What? What the hell are you on about?” Jenny started, not looking like she wanted to go anywhere.

I gestured widely. “We’re here for the cabin, right?”

Billy was already unloading guns and the booze cooler from the back seat, pulling it past Jenny while she stared at me.

“Gotta be round here somewhere.” I continued.

She just stared as Billy started on the duffels with the food and fireworks.

“I know you ain’t the smartest guy,” she started, “but this is, like, a life or death survival situation, okay? The car’s totaled; we’re stranded, and have no way of calling for help.”

I just stood in the snow, shrugging my shoulders.

 “Nah, Jenny. We came out for an adventure. I’m sure we’ll be fine. Climbers use these cabins all the time. I’d bet there’s a whole lot of them around here.”

Billy grinned up from his pile of supplies. “Yeah, I vote we go for the cabin.”

Faced with staying alone in the car waiting for the battery to die, or following the guys with the supplies, Jenny tagged along too. Billy was able to carry all the rifle bags and the cooler by himself, great bear of a man that he is (was). I had three of the duffels, one on the back and one in each arm, and Jenny only had her backpack, but hey, we’re gentlemen.

Was fine for her too, she had her ski pants and jacket. Me and Billy were in jeans and flannel shirts. We had thermals and a few layers, but it was getting pretty cold and trudging through knee-deep snow was wet and nasty. Luckily my feet were numb after about half an hour, so it felt less painful.

Now, the question of where we was headed had come up, but I’d led us downhill, towards dense tree cover and the dark valleys that were all around here. They say follow water downstream to civilization, but in the snow the water’s kind of everywhere, so just heading randomly downhill into uninhabited woodlands seemed a sensible move.

It was quite pretty beneath the pines. The snow lay nestled in their branches, and the layer on the ground was thin, letting us walk as normally as possible with numb legs like Billy and I.

After a few more minutes, Billy stopped abruptly, and I walked straight into his back. Then Jenny clattered into me, and the two of us fell in a heap.

But the smile on his face and his big shining eyes made us leap right back up.

“What is it? A road? Rescue?” Jenny asked.

“Better.” He replied. “Look.” He pointed ahead, and there, in a clearing, was a cabin.

It wasn’t the little, one-room affair of my Dad’s stories. This was actually a rather sprawling, decrepit single-story house of wood so old it had turned gray, and where the windows were thick with an unclean layer of gunk.

“Good find, Billy. Let’s get inside.”

The front door was the same sickly looking old wood, and it was locked up tight. I tried the windows, even walked all the way round and tried the back door. Nothing budged. There was an outhouse though, real cowboy type shit.

Well, nothing stops Billy and I when we put our brain cells to something. Even as we stood shivering, I knew we had another solution.

“Give it a kick, Billy.”

His massive foot smashed through the door, sending splintered planks and wood chips everywhere. The cold followed us in, snaking into the untouched interior with a flurry of snow.

“That was dumb.” Jenny said, throwing her bag on the floor. “Now we can’t even close the door.”

“It is pretty cold, I guess.” But then I looked and took in the place. Similar doors led to several rooms, and there were old chairs, tables, not to mention the roof and walls. Everything was made of wood. Even the big trapdoor in the corner. I smiled. “But we can build a fire.”

 

………

 

A few minutes later, and the little stone hearth on the left had a merry little fire going, started with Billy’s zippo, some lighter fuel, and most of the destroyed door. We might be dumb, but growing up out here you learn the basics of fire safety. I did move the fireworks bag a bit further away, though.

A cold breeze was still coming in through the door, but none of us were shivering any more. I was even started to get some feeling back in my feet.

Jenny, though, had decided to take the zippo as a makeshift torch and search the dark house. It was just as I was starting to relax and feel good about this trip that she called me from the other room. I told Billy to get some food going, and made my way as quietly as possible through the house.

In the back room, I found her stood over a desk, reading some old papers in the light of the zippo. Trying not to disturb her concentration, I moved up behind her in silence, and placed a reassuring hand on the back of her neck.

Her scream was loud enough to wake the dead, and she jumped so high I could swear she almost concussed herself on a roof beam.

“What the fuck? Why the hell are you sneaking up on me?” she groaned, getting up from the floor, retrieving the fallen lighter.

“Didn’t want to disturb. You looked real fascinated by that there paper.”

“Read it.” She thrust the zippo into my hands, and I tilted it to shine over the page.

*October 3****^(rd)****, 1911*

*The creature we found in the Arctic, is — I believe — a parasite of some form, wholly ungodly in its ability to quickly corrupt and twist the living. It is nearly immortal, only fire forces it to dormancy, in which case it can be handled. The hosts, of course, can be killed by common means, but the voracity of its reproduction and its infectiousness make it too dangerous to ever again see the light of day.*

*I have sealed it in a jar of spirits, chained and boxed in the basement. If any should ever find this house, then please, by god, do NOT ENTER the basement.*

“Huh, groovy.”

“What the hell are you talking about?” Jenny asked, looking at me with a smoldering frustration.

“Dude who lived here must be like, a writer. Uh, maybe that H.P. Minecraft guy?”

“Lovecraft was from Rhode Island, dipshit. Besides, no-one famous has ever come from Montana. I think this might be real. At the very least, we should avoid the basement until we get rescued.”

“Hey guys,” Billy’s voice came from the other room, “come see this weird shit I found in the basement.”

 

………

 

 

We sat around the big 10-gallon jar. Floating in booze (Jenny says spirits are alcoholic) was a horrifying… thing.

It was a long, vaguely pickle-shaped mass the color of flesh, and covered with sprawling, bloody tendrils.

“Twenty bucks and I’ll chug it.” Billy offered.

“Ten.” Came my counter.

“What the fuck is wrong with you two? The letter says it’s some kind of fucked up John Carpenter thing. You’d die!”

“Fine, Kurt Russell. Fifty, then.” Billy said, crushing his can of Natty Light and reaching into the cooler for another.

Jenny rolled her eyes.

“Well,” I offered, “ain’t really anything else to do ‘round here.”

“You two idiots are the ones who wanted to do this.”

Billy looked at me. “Guess we can go hunting in the morning.”

But I wasn’t buying it. “What do we do till then?”

He sat in silence, reflecting on the problems offered by a night without Xbox, football, or YouTube.

He nodded. “Let’s get drunk, light a load of fireworks, and shoot at stuff.”

Despite Jenny’s numerous objections, we at least had a solid plan, and began polishing off as many beers as we could. Drinking keeps you warm, anyway.

Actually, Jenny said that weren’t true, but we were still feeling warm when we grabbed bunch of fireworks and tried to load up our shotguns with our sloppy motor functions. We had brought our deer rifles for real hunting, our pair of Remington 870s were really just for giggles.

My Uncle James always said the first rule of gun safety was: have fun.

Shame about that negligent discharge. We still leave a few rounds of .38 special at his grave every year.

Jenny decided to stay inside and keep the fire going, which suited us just fine as she was in a shitty mood. So me and Billy dragged our sack of fireworks out, plus another couple of six-packs, and started having fun.

The weather was clear at last, the stars bright. If the moon works anything like the sun, which I assume it does, it was real low, so it must’ve been pretty early. None of us had watches.

We were just blasting off shells at random sticks and branches, shooting some skeet with empty cans, when we started letting off some of the fireworks. Mostly just firecrackers and the odd screaming rocket at first, as me and Billy shot the shit.

“So anyways,” he went, “what’s the deal with this creepy cabin in the woods?”

“Dunno.” I unloaded a few shells at a pine tree, blasting off bark. “Some real Evil Dead type shit.”

“Groovy.”

“Nah, probably just some mad old-timey dude with a jar full ‘o crap. You worried?”

“Nope.” He grinned. “Everything’s going near-perfect, I reckon. But I got a little something to make it better.”

He dug in his gun bag, and pulled out a pair of handsome little plastic pots.

“Behold, our salvation.”

I looked close, and in the moonlight I could read: Tannerite.

Now if you don’t know what Tannerite is, it’s just about the most fun you can have with your pants up.

I don’t know the science, but it’s a powder that explodes when you shoot it. Probably some sorta aluminum powder mixed with a nitrate-based reactant to make a pressure-sensitive explosive, but I don’t know the science.

Gleefully, we mixed it up, and then Billy had the best idea of the night yet.

“Why don’t we just shove it in the middle of all the fireworks? We could light this place up like the Fourth of July.”

I patted the genius man on the back. “Billy, my sweetheart, that’s the greatest plan I’ve ever heard.”

Unfortunately, the shotguns weren’t gonna cut it, so I headed back in to fetch my rifle.

“What are you two idiots up to now?” Jenny asked, looking real tired and eating a can of beans.

“Nothing, love, just practicing basic fireworks safety.” I said, as I pulled my deer rifle, a Sako in 6.5 Creedmoor, out of its bag.

“And you need a rifle for that?”

“Yup.” I said, a bit too drunk to load the thing, but luckily I’d left it loaded with the safety off, just in case of such a drunken shooting session. “Gonna blow up the whole pile with some Tannerite.”

Jenny groaned, kinda folding in on herself as put her head in her hands. “We’re gonna die out here, ain’t we?”

I was utterly dumbfounded. “What are you talking about? This is all going great, we’re having the time of our lives. I don’t get why you’re being so damned cranky. You on your period or something?”

For some reason she didn’t like that and turned away, stonewalling me. Well, it was normally best to leave her to sulk, so I staggered back out.

A hundred feet or so from the cabin, Billy had set up a pile of all the biggest, most illegal, most deadly fireworks we had, and he promised me that two pounds of Tannerite sat at its heart.

I gave him a big hug, thanking him for the best night of my life so far, then we laid behind a fallen tree and I took aim.

The explosion ripped across the forest, shaking snow from the closest trees. It wasn’t the biggest boom, but big enough, and all the fireworks starting blasting off. Colors whizzed and screamed through the trees, rockets wheeled crazily in the sky. It was like some Star Wars shit.

For nearly a minute, explosions clapped off all around us, sparks sparkling in every color of the rainbow.

I was grinning at Billy in the afterglow.

“Merry Christmas, bud.”

“Merry Christmas, bro.”

Then we heard Jenny screaming.

We rushed back through the charred snow and shot-up trees, to see flames burning through the open door to the cabin. Leaping in, I saw Jenny scrabbling to collect what supplies weren’t on fire, but it was spreading fast, dry and old as the wood was.

Without thinking, eyes stinging from the smoke, I picked up Jenny and dragged her outside.

“The jar!” She screamed, “Don’t let the jar break!”

Valiantly, Billy leapt into the now-properly-on-fire building, grabbing the jar from the last bit of floor that wasn’t on fire, as the ammunition I’d left in my gun bags started blasting from the heat.

Surrounded by fire and gunshots, Billy leapt out the door into the snow besides us.

Landing heavily on the jar with a loud shattering sound.

Now, y’all probably didn’t know this, but Billy is (was) a pretty clumsy guy. So it wasn’t too surprising he’d managed to break the jar.

I wasn’t really focused on that, though. I was staring incredulously at Jenny, silhouetted against the burning building.

“What the hell did you do?” I managed to get out.

“Me?!” she shrieked. “What the fuck is wrong with you? Your stupid fucking firework flew in through the door and exploded in the fire! The place went up in seconds! This is all your fault!”

“Hey!” I said, backing up from her fury. “This ain’t our fault! What’re the chances of a firework making that shot? It’s a straight up act of god!”

“Guys, I don’t feel too good.” Billy’s voice came from his prone form.

Jenny rushed to him, rolling him onto his back. He didn’t look so good either. His shirt and layers were all torn up on his front, and the thing from the broken jar was fused to his chest, pulsating and writhing as his veins and arteries darkened to a bloody color.

“You think I can walk it off?” He whispered, as he started to shake and his ribs cracked and bones groaned.

“Sure, buddy.”

“What the fuck?” Jenny muttered. “Please, one of you must’ve bought a phone, we-we need to call an ambulance or something, oh god oh god oh god…”

“Nah.” I said as Billy started convulsing, flesh on his arms tearing as they grew long and thin. “Billy’ll be just fine, he’s strong as an oak. Ain’t that right Billy?”

His arms were now five feet long, tipped with deadly looking claws, whilst his chest had spread even broader, flesh bubbling until he was built like a linebacker.

“See? Strong as ever.”

But Jenny was backing up, tears streaming down her face.

I leaned real close to Billy’s bloated, rippling head as he stopped shaking.

“Uh, right buddy?”

In that instant his head split vertically, from his hairline down his neck to the top of his chest, and opened with an unearthly shriek to reveal a line of serrated teeth and a maw that reminded me of my ex.

I leapt away, grabbing Jenny’s hand and dashing through the forest, back towards where we’d left our firework supplies.

“Damn.” I was overcome with surprise, revulsion, and horror. Billy really had gone full Resident Evil on us.

“Oh god.” Jenny said quietly, pointing back the way we came.

Billy was heading over, shambling and shrieking in the night, steam rising from his vertical mouth, pulling himself forward, long clawed arms digging into the trees as he used them for support.

“We’re gonna die, we’re gonna die, we’re—” She kept repeating, shaking like a leaf.

I wasn’t worried as much as kinda sad. The shambling, monstrous Billy saw us, eyes bulging, and then they distended from his head on phallic stalks, looking right at me. Poor Billy looked in pain.

I looked at my feet, and there was his trusty boomstick. I grabbed it, heaving it up. Good old Billy had left it loaded, chambered, and with the safety off. Just like Uncle James taught us.

My throat caught as I looked for some final words for my best buddy.

“In another life,” I said, as he clawed through the woods, just a few feet from me now, “I would have loved to explore each other’s bodies.”

The buckshot blasted apart his already bisected head, and with a groan like a falling tree, he slammed to the ground, steaming in the snow. His body sagged, reverting back to a more human-like form.

Jenny and I went up to him, looking at the mess of gore that had been Billy.

In the firelight, something was writhing in his ruined face. Jenny leapt into action.

“Quick!” She grabbed his ankles. “We gotta throw him in the fire; it’s the only way to stop the parasite!”

Well, the note had said that, so I grabbed him under the shoulders, and together we hefted the six-foot-five body back to the raging inferno that had been our cabin. His blood and brains were running warm down my front, but I took no notice.

I was focused on the writhing mass of tentacles trying to wriggle out of my buddy’s skull cavity.

Just as the thing was about the get free, we chucked him in the blaze.

Instantly, the thing started squealing like a pig with its nuts stuck in a gate. There was a rancid smell of burning hair, which soon gave way to a scent just like the summer hog roast.

Jenny cried and cried, wrapped in my arms, as the sun started to rise.

A few hours later, we were back at my house.

Y’see, we’d descended the mountain on the wrong side. Turns out we were only a couple hours from town after all. Oh well, that’s how things go sometimes.

Luckily my Dad was at work, so we cleaned up and I made breakfast. Jenny wasn’t eating any bacon or sausage. More for me I guessed. After that Jenny insisted on calling the police.

That’s when things got bad.

Turns out, Jenny’s family had filed a missing person’s report last night, so as the officers arrived, they explained I was facing kidnapping charges. Everyone had been called in to help search for her. They really weren’t happy to be working on Christmas.

She was practically catatonic at this point, just kinda shaking and staring at her plate.

Then the question came up about what happened, and I knew the cops wouldn’t buy the whole evil-ancient-arctic-parasite-jar story, so I said we went on a hunting trip with Billy and had a little accident.

They took Jenny to the station, and now they’ve gone to look for the remains of the cabin now, and I’m just sitting here waiting for them to find all the horrors we left there.

So yeah, probably going down for kidnapping.

Definitely for murder.

And they may or may not bring that parasite back with them.

All in all, I think everything went about as well as it could have, but this is probably still the worst Christmas ever.

Not sure what the take away is from all this.

It ain’t like a story with a message; me and Billy did everything right, made all the right choices, and now he’s dead and I’m gonna be arrested.

I’m sure Jenny would disagree, but what does she know?

It’s like that bald guy from Star Trek says: You can do everything right, and still lose. That ain’t weakness, it’s just life.

See you round, and merry Christmas.
