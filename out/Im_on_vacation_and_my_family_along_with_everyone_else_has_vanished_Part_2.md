I walked down the stone pathway past the empty tennis courts and over to the next hotel. There were waterslides there and the water was running down them, but no one was there either. I tried taking videos of it but my camera would crash or the video would glitch. I'll post the best one I was able to get at the end of this update.

It was surreal walking through the huge pool area, which also had a lazy river, with no one else around. The current was flowing and there were some empty tubes going around it. Most of the chairs were empty, but there were some with the hotel towels laid out nicely on them.

I looked across the bridge that went across the lake to the golf course and, of course, that was empty too. There were a couple golf carts out on the grass and I think I saw a few golf bags lying in the grass but they were far away so it was hard to tell for sure. I didn't feel like going there yet. I wanted to check out the hotels first.

This hotel had a huge lobby, a couple restaurants and shopping. There was some luggage sitting  by the front desk and there was food on some of the tables at the restaurant. The rest of the hotel was pretty much the same.

There were no windows in this area so I didn't realize it was getting late until I looked at my watch and saw that it was almost 6:00 at night. I had wanted to be back in my room before dark but that wasn't going to happen now.

I went back through the hotel and outside to the pool area. Luckily, the lights along the pathway were on to illuminate my way back. It sounded like something was moving across the small lake but it was too dark to tell what it was. I picked up my pace and moved ahead.

As I got closer to the entrance to the townhouse area I heard footsteps ahead of me on the path. [I took a picture](https://www.reddit.com/user/tropical_rabbit/comments/1855g8c/nighttime/) and then a video and saw something this time. It ran into the bushes and disappeared from my sight while making disturbing sounds.

After waiting a bit, I went ahead and took the path to my room. I heard something coming from the parking lot way ahead of me. It sounded like it was moving fast.

I took off running and scanned my bracelet to the door. It seemed to take forever for the green lights to show and it sounded like something was scraping along the stone path behind me. 

Finally, the door opened and I slammed it shut behind me. The automatic lock engaged and I pushed the manual lock for added security. Then I backed away from the door as something slammed against it. 

I thought about how someone had commented that maybe I went to a different reality or dimension or something and ran to the elevator. The pounding against the door continued. I pushed the elevator call button and heard the gears start moving. It sounded like the door and wall were breaking with each additional crash against it.

The loud ding of the elevator finally sounded and the door slid open. I ran inside and pressed the number 2 button over and over. Then I heard the door slam against the wall and something run across the floor with thundering footsteps. As the doors slid closed, I caught a glimpse of a jagged human-like shape covered in what looked like thick black fog. It crashed into the door and the elevator shook, making me stumble into the wall.

The elevator started moving as the crashing continued. I held onto the bar on the side and hoped the elevator would make it up. Although, I wasn't sure what I would do when I got to the second floor. My only hope would be to run down the stairs and outside before that thing got up here.

There was a huge crash below me and my head slammed into the wall, making me dizzy. I closed my eyes and steadied myself before the loud ding sounded again and the doors slid open. 

I heard footsteps running towards me and I opened my eyes to see my daughter standing there.

“Come on Dad, let's go down to the pool!” she shouted before running down the stairs.

I slowly got out of the elevator and looked around. My wife and other daughter were in one of the bedrooms packing things into a bag for the pool. 

My wife saw me and said, “Hurry up and get changed. We're wasting valuable pool time.”

I went down the stairs and saw that the door was closed and there was no damage to it or the wall around it.

I looked at my watch and it was 9:30 in the morning. I was exhausted and very confused but I got changed and went with my family to the pool. We passed by a few people on the way and there were some people sitting on the chairs drinking coffee.

When we got to a cabana, I sat down and checked my phone. The pictures and videos I had taken were still there. 

I fell asleep in the chair for a while when my family went into the lazy river. My dreams were filled with the thing I saw by the elevator and the things from my pictures. When I woke up, I didn't see anyone at first and was afraid everyone disappeared again. Then a couple of kids ran past me towards the waterslides and I felt relieved.

I took some good pictures around the pool and was able to relax and enjoy the nice sunny day. However, my enjoyment didn't last when I reviewed the pictures after I climbed into bed for the night. I think I brought something back with me from wherever I went.
