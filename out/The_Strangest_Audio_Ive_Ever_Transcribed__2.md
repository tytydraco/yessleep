So, hey again...okay yeah, that's a fucking stupid way to start off, but I'm pretty sure I explained to ya'll before that I'm not any kinda writer. I'm just a woman with a tedious job that's slowly becoming more interesting. So, by now all ya'll reading - if you read my previous post anyway - should know that I do online transcriptions. The pay is absolute shit, but I don't know anyone that would turn their nose up at a little extra money.



Anyway, so I got another weird ass transcription for ya'll. Not one I personally worked on, but someone in our group discord heard about what I'd done, decided 'fuck it', and messaged me with a transcription they'd done. No, saving these transcriptions is very much not allowed, yes we've both ignored that rule in favor of sharing this shit. Well, I'm sharing it at any rate, he just sent it to me to be shared. Yes, this is \*extremely\* illegal, but we're both invested. Hell, it's not just the two of us, more than a few people in our server have mentioned listening to some truly fucked up audio.



We're posting this shit cause, yeah, we could get into some big fucking trouble, but we all want to know just what in the absolute fuck we've been having to listen to? Hell, a few people have mentioned listening to audio a hell of a lot more fucked up than what I'm about to share. That's a though that kinda freaks me out a little, not gonna lie. 





Transcription Begins:







Ethan: "I don't know what else to tell you, I mean we've already went over this three times now, a fourth isn't going to change a thing about what I saw. I'm \*not\* lying, if that's what you're thinking."



Interviewer One: "We don't think you're lying, Ethan. I apologize if we gave you that impression, but it is important to ascertain that you've shared with us everything you remember about the incident. I know repetitively telling us your story seems pointless, but we want to make sure you haven't forgotten anything important."



Ethan: "Honestly, you not thinking I'm lying is freaking me the fuck out a bit. Like, what the fuck else have you seen that this is just...business as usual? But, yeah, that, uh, that makes sense, I suppose. I'm not going to apologize for getting frustrated though, you've had me in here...I'm not sure actually since you took my phone, but I know it's been a while."



Interviewer Two: "You've been in here approximately five hours. Does knowing that help?"



Ethan: "No, no it does not. How could that \*possibly\* help? I mean, really? Are you fucking with me right now?"



Interviewer Two: "My apologies, Ethan. I assumed this information might help you relax."



Ethan: "Help me...how in the \*hell\* would that help me relax, dude? Like, seriously? What did you think was going to happen here? I get told I've been stuck in this fucking room for five hours, and, what? I suddenly change my story, or fall all over you in gratitude? You aiming to get your cock sucked? I mean, you're not bad looking but - "



Interviewer One: "Ethan, that's enough. We understand you're upset, but that's no reason to act like this. Now, if you're quite done, could you go over what you witnessed once more?"



Ethan: "...Yeah, sure, sorry. So, uh, like I said before, I was camping near the lake...it's been a little warm, and I thought it'd be a nice time to go swimming. That sweet spot where it's still hella cold, like near freezing, but not actually freezing, you know?"



Interviewer Two: "Of course. Please, continue."



Ethan" "Right, so I'd gotten my tent set up earlier and had a nice little fire going. The hike to my spot was a long one and I was hungry, and thirsty. So I figured I'd roast some hotdogs, maybe make some s'mores and get some sleep, cause it was a little too late to go swimming. I mean, like, there's no posted times or whatever, it's just a random fucking lake in the woods, but it was getting dark, right?"



Interviewer Two: "Safety first, as they say."



Ethan: "Yeah...uh, sure. Anyway, like I said I had nice little fire going and I was in the middle of skewering a hotdog when I heard something moving behind me. I wasn't, like, worried or anything. I don't think there's bears or cougars or anything around here so I -"



Interviewer One: "Actually, there's a fairly large brown bear population."



Ethan: "Oh. Holy shit."



Interviewer One: "Perhaps you should do more research before camping, yes?"



Ethan: "Uh, yeah. Yeah, for sure. So, um, like I was saying, I heard movement right? So I look behind me and at first I don't see anything. I just hear, like, shuffling and rustling in the brush so I grab my flash light and aim it at the woods and....uh, that's....that's when I first saw them..."



Interviewer Two: 'Them?"



Ethan: "Sorry, uh, yeah. It wasn't just one person, it was, um, a group of people all, um, in a line. Like, just walking in a line, right? But, like, the way they walked was just...fucked up. Like, their bodies were stiff, rigid, you know? And each step was almost like, uh...it honestly looked like something was grabbing their legs, like, one at a time and forcing them to move. Was freaky as fuck."



Interviewer One: "Did you see any signs of them being forced?"



Ethan: "No, no, nothing like that. Like, um, the way they moved was forced looking, but no one was there \*actually\* forcing them."



Interviewer One: "Thank you for clarifying that, Ethan. Please, continue."



Ethan: "Right, um, so I get up to say hey, be friendly, or maybe run? I don't know, I just, um, didn't want to be sitting down when they got closer. Anyway, when I stand up I get a better look at them, and...and, uh, that's when I notice the woman in front is...um, she's bleeding. Like, bad. On the side of her face, there's just this whole patch of skin missing....like, not cut but, um, it looked like it had just peeled away, maybe? Fuck that makes no sense, but yeah man, it was freaky. So I start to panic a little, cause maybe they're walking so weird cause they're all injured? So I call out, asking if, like, they need help."



Interviewer Two: "What happened when you called out to them?"



Ethan: "Fuck, give me a second man, I just...you've had me telling this story over and over, and this shit isn't getting easier to talk about!"



Interviewer One: "We understand that this is an upsetting thing for you to talk about, Ethan, but please, continue."



Ethan: "Jesus Christ, yeah, alright. So, uh, when I called out to them the woman, the uh, bleeding one, turned her head to me, but it was like, really fucking slow. And, uh, I swear to fucking god I could hear her neck, like \*creaking\* with effort, it looked like it was, uh, difficult...to put it mildly. She was looking at me, and her face was like...it was totally blank man, like, no expression. No emotion. Her eyes though..."



Interviewer Two: "What about her eyes?"



Ethan: "Shit, sorry, yeah. Her eyes, uh, she looked so fucking scared, her eyes. There weren't any tears, but fuck, man, like eyes are the window to the soul right? Whoever she fucking was, she was scared shitless of something. And, like, I remember her lips trembled a little, like maybe she was going to say something, right? But then, like, she just snapped her head forward, and, um, they all kept walking."



Interviewer One: "Were you able to see where they were headed, Ethan?"



Ethan: "Uh, yeah, yeah I fucking saw. They were all heading to that lake, the one I wanted to go swimming in? Yeah, that one. Every single person in that line, and there was like, I think ten? Maybe eleven? I'm not sure, I wasn't, um, counting. But, uh, yeah, they were walking to the lake, and, um, I decided it'd be a good idea to follow them. Maybe, uh, maybe they were on something? I don't know, I just, uh, wanted to make sure they'd be alright..."



Interviewer One: "It was kind of you to try to help them, Ethan."



Ethan: "...I guess. I couldn't do a thing for them, though."



Interviewer Two: "Why was that?"



Ethan: "Dude, you know why! You both know damned good and well why! I've told you over, and fucking over - "



Interviewer One "Ethan, please try to remain calm. We understand this is trying for you, but you're almost done. Would you like some water when we're finished?"



Ethan: "Fuck, I'd rather have an entire bottle of whiskey, but, uh, sure. Water would be good too."



Interviewer One: "Of course, once we're done we'll get you a glass."



Ethan: "Um, thanks. So...so yeah. I...uh, yeah, I followed behind them, and...uh, I watched them. They started walking into the lake. Um, I mean the first few walked, but the rest kind of crawled? Like, they were on their hands and knees, and it, uh, it looked like they were trying to not move forward...one man, uh, he must have been trying too hard because...uh...because his arm, it, it snapped. Like, jesus fuck...it just, snapped in half, right? And he kept right on crawling into the lake."



Interviewer Two: "Did anything happen once they were in the lake?"



Ethan: "Yeah. Yeah, something fucking happened. They'd been quiet the entire time, you know. But once they were all in the water they just, um, started screaming. Like...fuck...it was bad, it was so fucking bad. Like, it was like they'd all been holding these screams, and now they could let out and...yeah."



Interviewer Two: "They screamed? Is that all that happened?"



Ethan: "Isn't that fucking enough? Jesus fucking Christ dude 'is that all', these people were -"



Interviewer One: "I apologize if my partner came across as callous, Ethan, but we need to know everything."



Ethan: "...Right. Everything. Okay. No, uh, that wasn't 'all that happened'. At first it was just like, all of them screaming. And I was getting ready to go in after them, but, uh, the one nearest the shore, easiest to see...he, um, his skin..."



Interviewer One: "What about his skin, Ethan?"



Ethan: "It, uh, the skin on his back, it...it split open? Like, um, it started cracking and, um, splitting open, and, um, it started bleeding...and...um...where it split the skin was, like, bulging, like something from the inside was...was..."



Interviewer One: "Take a breath Ethan, we can pause if you need."



Ethan: "No, no, I want to get this over with. I want to go home. Fuck."



Interviewer One: "Of course, continue whenever you're ready."



Ethan: "Thanks, uh, yeah. Their skin, on the back, it was splitting open and, uh, bleeding, and something was like, \*pushing\* out of the skin between his shoulder blades. I...I looked away from him, cause, fuck, and I realized it was happening to all over. Different places, some of them...their stomachs....uh, yeah. They...they, burst open, and everything inside...but there were these like, these strands? Black strands. And they were, like, squirming...they were squirming and like, dragging their way out of these people, and um, into the lake. I...uh, I ran, when I saw that. Yeah, I don't know of anyone who'd want to stick around to, um, watch whatever the fuck was happening. I couldn't help them, and I sure as fuck wasn't going into that lake, you know?



Interviewer One: "Of course, no one here is judging what you did, or didn't do, Ethan. Thank you for going over this again with us. If you'll just wait a moment, my partner can get you that water while we go over some forms you need to sign."



Ethan: "Uh, sure, yeah. Thanks."



Interviewer Two: "Here you are, make sure to drink it all."



Ethan: "Uh...sure. Thanks, man."



Interviewer One: "Alright Ethan. This is a basic nondisclosure agreement, we just -"



Ethan: "What...what the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck did I drink? What -"



Interviewer Two: "Oh, my. That worked much faster than I expected."



Interviewer One: "Yes, the speed varies from subject to subject, I've noticed."



Ethan: "What the fuck did you do to me?"



Interviewer One: "Please, Ethan, try to remain calm. Stop trying to tear them out, you'll only hurt yourself."
