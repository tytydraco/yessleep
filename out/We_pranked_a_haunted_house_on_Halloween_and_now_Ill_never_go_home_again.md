“Last one there’s a rotten egg!” Kyle bellowed as he sped off on his bike. 

It was a childish threat, one that really didn’t mean much of anything. But it didn’t stop me from pedaling my bike faster and faster. My calves burned and sweat poured down my brow as the bike chain churned round and round. 

Our blue and silver bicycles tore around the bend in a flash as the sun set over the field of soybeans. 

We peeled off Elm Street and took a right on Walnut Grove. I kept a tight grip on my Halloween basket, looping it over the handlebar. The candy threatened to spill over at each curve in the road, but I was ever so careful. I couldn’t let my bounty go to waste, and Kyle would certainly win if I stopped to collect it. 

We were neck and neck when we reached the old farm on Rustwire Road. Kyle grinned at me through his ghostly face paint as he pulled out a roll of toilet paper from his bag. 

“I don’t know… do you really think we should do it?” I asked reluctantly. 

“Oh, come on, don’t be such a wimp. We will be *legends* if we toilet paper the haunted farmhouse.” He cackled with delight. 

The plan had been set at school earlier in the week. Kyle was dared by Tommy Thompson, and Kyle never backed down from a dare. Even now I could see that steely look of determination on his face, his eyes glowed with resolve under that mop of blonde hair.

I was hesitant and didn’t share the same enthusiasm of vandalizing the most haunted place in the whole county. An entire family had died here for God’s sake…

But I rested my bike on its kickstand and followed after him anyway. He was my big brother after all, and I’d been in his shadow my entire life. 

We circled the farmhouse, sticking to the sides of the shrubbery to stay out of view. It had sat empty since the family had died about fourteen years ago, but we had to be sure before we started. Not a sound or silhouette stirred in sight, other than thistles swaying in the breeze throughout the unkempt yard.

Once it was clear that we were the only people around for miles, Kyle shoved an armful of toilet paper rolls into my arms. 

“You get those trees and I’ll get these.” He chuckled, pointing to a row of pines to my right. 

I loosened the edges of the rolls and pitched them in a stream over the tree limbs. It felt wrong, but I did as I was told. I could hear my brother whistling a tune from the other side of the yard, he seemed to enjoy the prank entirely too much. 

I thought about the family as we worked. I didn’t know all the details, but I knew there had been suspicions of foul play. Some even claimed that they had been murdered in their sleep, but others had said it was natural causes, a gas leak. Who knew what the truth was, but the eeriest thing were the rumors that they had been buried on the property and that their ghosts still lingered around the farm. 

Tommy Thompson said his cousin had seen them once, floating between the pines. But Tommy was also full of shit more often than not. That didn’t stop a shiver from going down my spine though.

We finally came to meet in the middle of the yard. The trees were thoroughly covered in flowing tissue paper. By the time we were almost done it was dark. Stars twinkled above as a few clouds lazily drifted by.

“If Tommy could only see us now.” My brother beamed. 

“Yeah, we sure did it, didn’t we?” I shuffled my feet anxiously.

“We sure did kid.” Kyle patted my shoulder after tossing the last roll of toilet paper.

We strolled through the yard for a while, admiring our work and talking about anything and everything. I chewed on some tootsie rolls from my pocket and fussed at the dirt on my costume as Kyle went on and on about girls, guts and glory.

Then for a while we just fell quiet. Kyle played with an old Zippo he’d found on the bus, while I tossed some loose stones into a creek that flowed on the edge of the property. I wondered why we hadn’t started on our way back home yet, but was enjoying the peace and quiet. The guilt from the prank was even starting to wash away. 

“Where do you think the family is buried?” I asked, abruptly ending the silence.

“Oh, right next to the barn.” He replied.

“How do you know?” I furrowed my brow.

“Come on, I’ll show you.” 

He gestured for me to follow him as he crossed the lawn towards the decrepit red barn. I strolled closely behind him, my heart thundering in my chest. I immediately regretted asking the question. I didn’t *want* to see where they were buried, but I also didn’t want to disappoint him. 

The barn creaked in the breeze. The paint peeled in multiple places and the wood looked consumed with rot. Planks hung haphazardly where bolts had rusted out in the framing. One big storm would be all it would take to bring this thing down. 

Kyle came to stop next to a patch of earth that had some semblance of being disturbed perhaps a long time ago. The grass wasn’t as thick and there were some large stones tangled in the weeds. 

“They’re buried right here.” He tapped his foot on the ground. 

“Wow…” I hugged my body with my arms. I didn’t know what to say. 

We stared at the grave for a while before I started getting curious again. 

“But… how did you know?”

“Because that’s where dad buried them.” Kyle replied, while stepping down to pick up a large stone. 

“Wait… what?” My mouth went dry. 

“He told me.” He shrugged, turning the stone over in his hands. 

“I don’t understand…”

“You know what else he told me?”

“What?”

“That I should bury you right next to them.”

Before I could react, a large stone came careening towards my head. It was too late to stop it. 

Everything went black. 

—  


I awoke to whistling. That same joyous whistling. 

Then something soft and heavy splashed against my torso. 

I struggled to see. I opened my eyes just in time for a huge heap of dirt to pour into them. I struggled to move but couldn’t. My hands were bound. 

I tried to scream. But my lungs filled with earth. 

*He said I should bury you right next to them.*

The words echoed in my mind as the darkness overtook me [once more.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TerrorTherapy/)
