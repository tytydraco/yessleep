I've always been a painter. Since I could hold a paintbrush, I was making art. I was always alone as a child, some would call me strange, weird, eccentric, the words people use when someone is just strange. I was alright with the thought of being strange. Now, as an adult, I’m still strange. I paint the things I hear in my head. Voices that speak to me in the background of my head. I use the medium of acrylics, pastels, and canvas to show what they say, what they see, what they look like. People tend to call my art “contemporary” or “unusual” when I show it. It’s true, to the normal person it does look a bit intriguing, but to a true artist, it tells a story.  

I sit in my art studio working on a new piece, I call it “Ghostly beauty” a bit on the nose, but it’s a work in progress. The painting depicts a frail, pale woman, sitting on a bench in a field of daisies. I’m halfway done with the painting, but I’m stuck on her face. I haven’t heard a description of her face yet. I don’t want to paint a face they won’t like. So, I work on making the daisies as detailed as possible. I hear a knock on my door. I set my things neatly onto my counter. I can’t stand things being out of order. I hear another knock as I’m walking down the stairs. 

“Coming!” I yelled. As I check the peep hole, I notice a chipper young woman standing outside my door.  

“Who is that?” a voice whispered in a low growl. 

“I don’t know, let’s find out together.” 

I opened the door and saw who was there. A woman, probably a year or two younger than me stands in front of me, holding a small, yellow purse in the shape of a daisy. She wore a long denim dress and had her brown hair in a messy bun. A wide, chipper smile was along her round face, her round red glasses complemented her hazel eyes.  

“Pretty...” a shy womans voice said. 

“I know” I mumbled. 

“Hi! I’m Dahlia! The Abraham Cohen Foundation sent me to come and view some of the pieces from your portfolio before the showing next week. Do you mind if I come in?”  

“Too loud...” 

“So beautiful...” 

“DON’T LET HER IN” 

I shook her hand. My head pounds with an uproar of voices. Majority of them didn’t like visitors, but the ones that did like them didn’t want to let them go. 

“Welcome in. I can show you the studio. Sorry if it’s a bit messy.” She came in, her boots making echoing click sounds in my home.  

“Wow, your home is so clean! I wish I could be this tidy” 

“She talks to much...” 	 

“I wish I had her eyes...” 

“GET HER OUT!” 

I itched my head as the pounding hurt even more. 

“I try to keep it clean. My passion is messy so I might as well keep my life as tidy as I can”. We walked into my studio, and she began looking at all my work. The walls of my studio are lined with finished paintings, sketches, half done paintings, and she closely viewed all of them.  

“She’s too close...” a man’s voice whispered.  

“She’s fine” I mumbled. She was very close to my paintings. A lot closer than most people. She walked to another painting across the room to a stack of canvases leaning against the wall; she sifted through some and pointed out a larger piece. 

“Can I pull this one out?” 

“Sure, let me help” 

As I held back the canvases, she revealed a painting I wish she had never noticed. She pulled it out and put it onto an easel.  

“What’s this one called? It’s incredible! I don’t know why you didn’t submit this one.” she asked as her eyes darted across the painting, studying every inch of it. The painting showed a man in the lower center of the canvas, kneeling towards a throne. The throne was raised on a pile of rotting corpses, each in a different state of decay. Floating above the throne is a humanlike figure, but with wings stretched wide, showing the bat-like skin and large demonic size. His limbs are long and are held high above his head, wielding a scepter. His legs are slender and look like birds' legs. His face...His face is that of a fly, eyes large, red, and bulging from his head, long tendrils coming from his mouth, as if he is about to consume the man kneeling before him. Whether in praise or in fear. A wave of dread, disgust and nausea come over me in waves. A high pitch ringing in my ears becomes shattered by the sound of all the voices yelling at me in unison.  

“NO! She can’t know!” 

“That’s private!” 

“LIE!” 

“Make her leave!” 

“She’s so pretty...” 

I paused and stared at the painting. The voices haven't been this loud since the making of it. They wouldn’t let me destroy it. I must tell her. She asked.  

“Ba’al Zabub” 

“It’s such a detailed piece, the way the different red tones really complement the dark blues of the bodies. And the way you painted this demon figure is just. Wow. I’m at a loss for words.” 

She looks at me, smiling, as if she's waiting for me to agree or go on a tangent about the different meanings of everything in the piece.  

“I agree. It took me a long time to get this done.” 

“I would love to have this show cased. I feel like this would really shine in the gallery. Would you be okay with that?” 

“NO!” 		 “Please don't hurt her...” 

“No!”       “No!”     	   “SHOW THEM!” 

“Show the world our Master....”          

“YES, SHOW THEM” 			“No! 

All yelling at once. The spot behind my eyes searing in pain, like a million needles are stabbing into my brain from the inside.  

“Yes! Yes...sorry for yelling yes. We can add it.” 

Complete silence. Not from Dahlia, but from the voices. They weren't mumbling, they weren't growling, nothing. They all just shut up.  

“Wonderful! Just bring it to the gallery on Thursday evening so you can show the boss man and his partners this new addition.” 

“Got it.” 

We walked back to the front door. As she was about to leave, she turned to me and said, “You know, a lot of the stuff you showed me could’ve been entered, you’re a really good artist.” I smiled “Thank you. I tend to stay private with my art but I had a good feeling about this foundation so, I don’t know, guess I had a change of heart.” 

“CRINGE” 

“Don’t lie to her”			“WE told you to enter” 

“LIAR”		“NO” 

I shook my head and my eye started twitching. As Dahlia left, I thought about what the voices said. They weren’t wrong, they did tell me to enter my art here. After I got that strange email invitation they basically were screaming and begging me to email back. I did think it was weird that a Church also had an art gallery and contacted me specifically. Why were the voices so compelled to enter here, any other time I tried showing off my art they always and a million reasons why I shouldn’t enter. These thoughts rack my brain. I go back to the painting of the woman. I began to repaint her hair a shining brown, with a round face, and a pair of round red glasses.  

I follow the directions on my GPS leading me to Abraham Fellowship Church, either the Abraham stands for the one in the bible or this guy had a huge ego problem. I pulled down the street to see a huge compound, smaller white brick buildings surrounding a huge white church, like something you’d see in Rome. The front had a giant stain glass window of Jesus floating above his disciples, underneath that was a large wooden door. I was told the gallery was to be held in one of the smaller buildings, still huge but relatively small compared to the monolith of a church. As I begin to unload my portfolio from my trunk, the voices seem to stop chattering, they’ve been unusually quite all day, besides the occasional yell to hit someone with my car, one talking about Dalia, and another telling me not to go altogether. It was strange how silent they were when I pulled in, as if they didn’t want someone else to hear them. Maybe it’s cause I’m at a church. I haven’t been to one in years, a decade maybe. And whenever I would go as a child, or what I could remember from then, is them being silent. I haven’t exactly figured out what their boundaries are, and I don't really care, because they never cared about mine.  

“Hello, are you Samael?” A man’s voice said behind me. I jumped back and dropped my bag. 

“Shit! Hey, yeah that’s me. Sorry about that, you scared me” 

“Oh, my bad about that. My names David McCormick, I’m head of our arts department here at the Church, Abraham sent me to guide you to the building, won’t want you to get lost.” He said with a chuckle. His voice had an old timey southern twang to it. He was pudgier, taller man, with a mid-length graying beard with matching greying black hair. He wore a black button-up shirt with a clerical collar, dark blue jeans, timberlands, and had skinny wire framed glasses on. He looked very jolly, if that's the right word to use, like unsettlingly happy.  

“Thank you, I’ve never been here before.” 

“Well welcome! This here church has grown into what it is now over many, many years. Generations and generations of the same four families built this place to what it is today. A place of community, love and worship. That’s why we decided to open but the gallery, hoping to bring in more people to talk about their love of art and hopefully soon, their love of the Lord.” 

“What families brought this place up? I’ve lived her my whole life and I’ve never noticed this.” 

“Well, my own of course, the Cohens, the Simons, and the Soloman's. Ever since the Pilgrams came here, they settled and brought the Lord with them.” 

“Oh, that’s interesting.” 

“Yes, our history is very interesting. But don’t worry, there won’t be a quiz later” Again he chuckled.  

We came up to the gallery building. Another big white brick building, but above the door was a sign reading the name “David McCormick Art Gallery”. We entered the building, and a gust of cold air came over me. I shivered enough for David to speak. 

“We keep it cold, so the humidity doesn’t damage any of the paintings, we have a lot of different mediums in here, so I thought this was best.” 

“Makes sense.” 

The room had a huge floor plan, with walls spaced out in the center of it to add more space for art. Some walls were already decorated with paintings, charcoal sketches, photographs, all with religious depictions and animals. We walk to a side door labeled “Staff only” and walk inside. A whole group of people were making small talk, some with their portfolio bags still, some with coffee, and some just sitting at the giant table in the middle of the room. I see Dahlia standing in the corner talking to someone who is probably another artist, wearing a black blouse with a large sparkly broach in the shape of a cardinal, with a mid-length blue skirt. Hair still in a bun, glasses still round and red.  

“Pretty...”  

I hear a voice whisper in the back of my head, and I swear after the voice said that one of the men in a typical priest outfit looked at me, with his eyebrows furrowing after making eye contact with me. Maybe he was trying to figure out who I was, or something like that. An older man at the end of the table rises from his chair and gestures towards me.  

“Ah, our final guest has arrived. Everyone welcome Samael LeFlore, one of our highlighted artists of the event” 

Jeez this guy looked creepy. He was tall and thin. He had greasy black hair that went past his ears, he wore a black cassock with a rosary around his neck. One of his eyes was severally glazed over, almost grey, while the other was a bright blue. He smiled with crooked grey teeth. Some scattered whispers arose from the crowd around me. I hated it. I hated all the eyes on me.  

“Now that we’re all acquainting with each other, I would love to take a moment and acknowledge the two people who made this all possible, David McCormick and his niece Dahlia Bennett” 

Applause erupted in the small room, over the noise, the voices rose 

“NIECE? WHAT THE SHIT!” 

“I don’t like it here” 													“LEAVE LEAVE LEAVE ” 

“Dahlia...” 		                      “TOO LOUD” 

My head pounded, my eyes hurt like someone was stabbing them from the inside. I closed my eyes as tight as I could and also screamed for them to shut up. As the clapping stopped, so did the voices, they quieted down and I stood awkwardly and slowly opened my eyes. Dahlia was standing next to me.  

“Hey, are you alright?” 

“Yeah, I just get headaches sometimes.” 

“Alright, just making sure. Wouldn’t want you feeling bad on the first day.” 

“First day?” 

“Yeah, did no one tell you? This is not only an art show, but a artist retreat! Isn’t that fun?” 

What. A retreat? With art nerds and Jesus freaks? For a whole week?  

“No, no one told me this was a multi-day experience.” 

“Oh shoot. That should've been in the email. Well its only three days, then on the third its the art show.” 

“I didn’t pack clothes or anything.” 

“That’s fine, you can always borrow some from the chapel, they have a donation bin.” 

She placed her hand on my shoulder, she knew I wasn’t all that excited to stay here for multiple days. Her hand was warm and made me feel this strange fuzzy feeling. 

“EW HER HAND” 	 

“Warm...” 

“GET HER AWAY” 

I took her hand off my shoulder, it was soft. She looked pretty today. No, no I shouldn't be thinking these things. Her uncle was one of the people who ran this place, who knows what could happen to me if I started pursuing that. 

“Oh, that’s nice. I guess I could stay for the retreat.” 

“Wonderful! Oh, that makes me so happy” She smiled at me and walked around to some of the other artists in the room. Everyone in the room began to sit down at the table in the center of the room. I sat in-between a women older than me, possibly in her early 40s. She looked like she was a funeral director. Then on the other side of me was a man around the same age as me, in full scene attire. Spikey hair and all. The woman scowled toward me when I sat down, and the man offered a sleeveless gloved hand to me. 

“Hey, my names Zeke, you’re pretty popular tonight.” 

“Yeah, I wasn’t expecting that kind of welcome.” 

“Well, from what I’ve heard, you have one of the main art pieces of the gallery. I’m not gonna lie, I am a little jealous they picked you over mine.” 

“Mine? Huh, didn’t know that. But what was your piece?”  

“It was my spin on the famous painting ‘The Creation of Adam’, where instead of it being realistic and two men, it’s two women and it's made up of a bunch of different mediums. I can show you after the presentation if you want.” 

“That sounds cool.” Zeke seemed like a cool guy, who knows, maybe I can make some friends out of this experience. Looking around the table there are about seven other people who are artists. Dahlia was there sitting next to her uncle at the front of the table. Another, younger man, was sitting across from her, he was the priest guy who stared at me earlier, and at the end of the table closest to the screen was Abraham. He clapped his hands together to get our attention before speaking again.  

“I know you are all very excited about this opportunity to be here with many talented artists and clergymen to become closer to faith, and better your skills. Now as some of you know this is a four-day retreat ending in the opening of the gallery. We all just want you to bond and grow with each other, and the spirit of the Lord. So, we will have rooms for everyone, the women in one wing and the men in the other. Some of our staff will escort you and give you the itinerary for the following days. Now, you are free to explore after that but be sure to be in the dining hall for dinner and our nightly sermon. Thank you all, Amen” 

Mumbled ‘Amens’ came from the group, some saying it more confidently than others. As we all rose from the table, more clergymen and women entered the room. I guess they have housing on property.  

“Hello, I’m Douglas, I’ll take you to your housing quarters and help you get settled in. These people will take your portfolios if you haven’t given them already. Follow me.” 

Another man came up to me to take my paintings, including the newest addition, as he grabbed the bag he looked at me with this look in his eyes of fear, like I did something wrong. 

“Be careful with them please, I had to repack them in a hurry.”   
“I will, sir.” As he scurried away, out of the corner of my eye I saw Abraham twirling his rosary, staring at me with his cold, blind eyes.
