"Another dog went missing last night; I want you to take a taser with you the next time you take Perry out for a walk." My mom commanded me. She sat at the kitchen counter overlooking the living room, her phone hanging dryly off her hand.  Perry, our light blue terrier was resting his greying chin on my lap. His ears twitched slightly at his name, but his eyes did not open.

 I had been watching the new "*The Penguin*" show on MAX and had barely been listening. 

"What." I mumbled under my breathe. I could hear ma roll her eyes. 

"The Stevensons' dog went missing last night, they posted about it in the Hoodwatch page. Third one this week." she exposited ominously. 

"I wish you would stay off that page ma, it's nothing but bored housewives tattling on each other." I complained back.  

"You're just mad Mrs. Ray caught you smoking that "jay." out in the yard." She protested back. She had whispered the word "jay" like it was a secret curse word, like she'd get in trouble for even thinking about pot. "I still want you to take the taser with you're walking around at night."

 She was referring to the little pocket taser she had gotten me for my 13^(th) birthday.  I would barely call it a taser, more like a mini cattle prod that gave you a little jolt when jammed into some weirdo's thigh. In high school I would sometimes creep behind my guy friends and jab them with it while yelling " I DO NOT CONSENT." They did not find it nearly as funny as I did. 

"Perry is practically glued to me while I walk him, I don't think I'll need it." I shrugged off her concern and went back to watching the great Oz Cobb conquer all crime in Gotham. 

"Well, what if it's some coyote or rabid animal going after these poor creatures, if they get hungry enough, they'll go after anything." She warned, my mother the oracle. "What if it's not an animal, what if it's some sex pest kidnapping these poor creatures for nefarious purposes." She was clutching those pearls so hard they might turn into diamonds. 

"Sex pest." I repeated to the air.

"That's right, I read an article once, where they kidnapped a dolphin and feed him LSD and did all sorts of things to that poor animal." She whispered "LSD" like she would get into trouble if someone heard. She then went on to explain in graphic detail about what happened to the dolphin as I tuned her out, petting Perry and trying to watch TV. Just another average day on my summer break.

I go to college in some mountain town up in Maine, but for the summer of my senior year I decided to stay with my mom. She had moved to some dead-end town in the boonies of New Hampshire to "Stay closer" to me. She had always been like this, ever since dad passed. I was only seven when he did, but I still vividly remember his hazel blue eyes and the smile that would be bright enough to power the eastern seaboard. Mom rarely smiled. Still doesn't she just borrows her head in that stupid phone. Every day its some new conspiracy or horror with her. 

"California is going to collapse into the sea in the next two years Abbey, just you wait." 

"The Chinese are going to EMP us any day now."

"We never landed on the moon; Spielberg shot it in a day." 

I never have the heart to tell her she's double wrong on that one. But it's always something with her. The other day she was telling me a circus train derailed 15 miles out of town. Bunch of animals got lose, lions and tigers and bears oh my. I don't even know what crackpot site she found that one on, couldn't find it on the news anywhere. When I told her that she just sort of chuckled in a "Well why would you." sort of knowing way. I swear, she thinks she's crackpot columbo. It had been about three weeks of staying at her nice little suburban home, and two weeks since the animals started vanishing. There hadn't been any bodies found, but sometimes there would be little specks of blood and fur next to a broken chain. Sometimes you could hear barking, quickly followed by a sharp yelp. I'll be the first to admit it was kind of spooky, but I was a big girl, I could handle any sort of coyote. Espeacly with Perry on my side. Ausie cattle dogs are tougher than they look, even if they are sort of chunky looking. Almost like more muscular corgis. But they are gritty and grumpy all the same. While I did believe ma to be a nut, I had been walking Perry as close to dusk as possible. Maybe that was overly cautious of me, maybe it wasn't. Of course, tonight would be the night Perry woke me up at 2am. Tonight, would be the night the stalking began. 

Colin Farrell was whisking me away in a purple Lambo in the heart of Gotham City, his disgusting yet charming Penguin make up in full effect. I was dressed in a classic mid 20's gala outfit, looking like Bonnie on her deathbed. I could hear colin mumbling in his powerful accent, how this city was ours and nothing could change that. I rubbed his burly shoulders, and expected him to turn to me with that wonderful smoldering look. Instead, when he turned his head, all I saw was my dog's giant furry face, panting and whining at me. 

I awoke to the sound of his eager whines and his ice-cold nose bopping my forehead. It was dimly lit in my room, a red mood light buzzed in an outlet in the far wall. I could see his beautiful crystal blue eyes both begging and apologizing at the same time. I turned over on my back and sighed. Perry continued his little back leg dance that singled his victory over me. I sat up and noticed myself in the mirror facing my bed. It was one of those big wall mirrors that basic bitch girls had, it was one of the few basic bitch commodities that I allowed myself. My curly red hair was matted and all over the place, my pale skin had somehow become paler. The black pentagram shirt I was wearing was about three sizes too big, and my stereotypical cookie monster PJ pants had, ironically, some cookie crumbs on them. 

*When had I even eaten cookies in bed*, I found myself wondering. I wasn't that big of a slob. I brushed that thought off and took one last glance at myself and decided with confidence: I can go out looking like this. For a late July night, I remember it being sort of chilly out. Lucky for Perry he had always been fairly shaggy for his breed. I on the other hand, was pretty stupid and decided I didn't need a jacket. So, while Perry strolled merrily own our street, I was one step below freezing to death.  Our long street was, well long. It was a side street off route five, and even at this late hour I could hear rumbling down the way. Perry was unbothered, however. We lived in a semi wooded area, like someone placed suburbia smackdown in the middle of Bambi's birthplace. Occasionally I would almost splatter a squirrel or a deer running across the street. Route five was constantly littered with the squashed dead. One time I even saw a family of raccoons laid out, even the little babies.  Rules of nature, I suppose.  

I always walked Perry to the end of our street and back, takes about twenty minutes all together. Perry was all business, such a good dog. We had gotten him when I was 14, to help protect myself when I was out late at night on my runs. One of ma's better paranoid ideas. How old was he now? Seven, maybe eight? How long did cattle dogs- I quickly brushed THAT thought off and refocused myself on freezing to death. I was so focused on that I didn't notice the leash had gone limp. I felt a rough tug and looked behind me. Perry was sitting calmly on the barely paved walkway. He had this look on his face, almost quizzical. 

"Pear bear. Wassa matter buddy." I quietly knelt down and scratched his chin. I noticed he was shaking a Little in his front legs. Thats when I heard a rustle in the bushes behind me. 

*"Err, it's right behind me, isn't it?"* Flash banged in my rotted brain. My heart spun in my chest as I looked at the bushes. There was nothing now but something had scuttered by. I was sure of it. In the distance I heard something small and furry screech out. It was a high-pitched whine, like a hamster being stepped on. For all I knew, maybe that was what's was happening. The screech cut out as quickly as it began, and my blood ran cold. 

"Come on Perry, psst-psst come on buddy" I calmly commanded to him. He was slow to budge at first, his glare still steadily trained on the tree line. I was about to pick him up when I heard a low growl. It was vicious and angry, and it was coming from Perry. The bushes rustled once more, more aggressive this time. Like something was contemplating jumping out. I stood there frozen and watched them, ready to scoop up Perry and book its back to the perceived safety of my mom's house. That's when I heard it.

 *Hehheh, heheh, heheheh*

A sinister giggle, mixed in with some sort of sharp barking. Thats the best way I can describe what I heard. It was like something was trying to mimic a human, but not really. It was an unnatural-natural imitation. If that makes any sense. Whatever it was sounded ghoulish, that's for sure. The bushes rustled again and Perry stood up, his hair standing up as well. That growl became a snarl, deeper and more determined. This is the same dog who used to let rabbits chase HIM for fun.

 "P-perry COME." I commanded more harshly. I jerked his leash, and he snapped back to reality long enough to look back and cough at me, like I was strangling him to death. "Perry come." I tried to keep my voice even and authoritative, but he could sense the tension in my voice.  He was always good at that. He abruptly stopped his growl and retreated to my legs, a small whine. He started bopping my knees, trying to herd me along home. I could feel his sloppy Tounge grace my palm and felt his eyes look up at me for approval. "Good boy." I muttered as I started backwards towards home. Couldn't take my eyes off the bushes. I heard that low cackle again and me and Perry won a gold medal sprinting back home. I slammed the door shut behind us and triple locked it. 

"Whatta ya slamming doors for Abbey Mae Lee." I heard ma call out. I Ignored her and collapsed onto the nearest kitchen chair. Perry jumped into my lap and settled in almost immediately. He wiggled his rear end into my hand and demanded pats. I obliged; it comforted us both. 

Two days later they found the first body. 

I had kept what I heard to myself; ma already had sort of a reputation with the neighbors. Didn't need no whispered looks aimed at me. I was out for my morning jog when I saw a small crowd gathered on the front lawn of a house three doors from me. It belonged to the Raymonds. They were always nice to me. Nice enough to ma. I could hear Norma Raymond wailing while Pat held her close. Neither of them could bear to look at what the crowd was gawking at. I could hear uncomfortable murmurs as I approached. The group silently opened up to let me in as well. It was their Chocolate Lab. Iggy. He had been split open down the middle, and what was left of his organs had been chewed up, one might say ravenously. Something had torn away at his back; deep claw marks crowded it. It looked like they had used his spine for a scratching post. Iggy's once green eyes were now glassy, and he reeked of rot and manure. I saw someone point to the house and noticed a giant bloody splotch, like something had thrown Iggy against the house. I squinted my eyes and saw a dent where the blood was most thick. Finally, I saw the bloody trail that led to poor Iggy's final resting place. 

I couldn't believe my eyes, and part of me felt like throwing up then and there. The other part of me was beyond curious about what could have done this. I quietly listened to the panicked populace.

"Kinda sick freak--a wolf or something-

Gottta call AC, they'll get down here-

It was clearly a Hyena you dolt."

That last voice struck me in the ear like a hammer to the head. I turned to see my mother in her pink bathrobe arguing with a splinter group of neighbors They were Cleary trying to usher her away from the scene. I snuck over there, trying to eavesdrop. 

"Miss Lee please. You're upsetting Norma even more." I heard one guy say. He was a bald man with a giant red bush growing on his face. Ma just wagged her finger at him.

"Look at the way he's cut. Down the middle, like an incision. It was precise, it was deliberate, no other animal hunt like that." Ma was determined I give her that. The small crowd shifted uncomfortably, as you would do when talking to an insane person. Another voice protested, in a hush whisper.

"Tracey that's nuts. How would an animal like that even come around here-" The voice of reason began but was quickly cut off by the rambling of a mad woman. 

"It came off that circus train that derailed few weeks back. They never found all of them animals. I read about these creatures; opportunistic carnivores that feed off the dead mostly but hunt when they can. They are also territorial to boot." She jerked her thumb over to the bloody side of the house. More groans and curses followed. I held my breathe as I walked over to my mom, gently taking her hand. 

"Ma why don't we go home." I said gently. "We can watch some Kolchaks or something." I started to guide her out as the crowd parted ways. Ma mumbled about how she knew she was right, but she'd humor me because she knew how much I liked that show. I tried to ignore the murmurs as we walked away. I tried. Redbeard said "Crazy old bitch." and a few others agreed. The voice of reason tried to calm them, saying it wasn't ma's fault, she was cooped up all day with her batty dau-

hmmm Maybe he wasn't the voice of reason Afterall. 

As crazy as it sounded however, that was the start of the Hyena rumors. It was also the start of when I would hear rustling around the yard at night and dawn. When Perry would spend hours at a time just staring out the window. I could often her him growling late into the evening. Even when I walked him in the afternoon, he wasn't the same. He was slow, almost too cautious. The wind would move through the tree branches and he would dead stop. After a few days he even had me doing it. If you listened closely at night, you could even hear that ghoulish heckle. It would go off and on in the night, sometimes devolve into howls, like a mad man ranting at the moon. It wasn't long after Iggy that more bodies turned up. Some fresh kills, others discovered just outside the trails to the woods. All were found in various states of mangle and decay. What was left of the pet population went into hiding. Once friendly cats and pups would bark and snap at the slightest provocation. Others on our street started to report the heckling in the night. 

Redbeard, who it turns out lived across the street from us, claimed he saw something one night. It was leering over a deer, loudly gulping down its meal. All he saw was a massive four-legged figure with a hunched back. He must have gasped loudly or something because the creature had heard him. He said it turned towards him, meat and viscera spilling out of its maw. He said it had pure white eyes, glowing in the evening sky. It began to heckle at him, and Redbeard ran inside like the coward he was. 

That didn't help the hyena rumors I tell ya Hwhat. 

There were two really bizarre things about all this. I had looked into the train derailment, just to ease my own piece of mind. It had not been a circus train; it had actually been a train bound for Cavier Park Zoo in Maine.  Supposedly some animals had gotten loose, but there was no mention of any sort of dangerous animal or something like that. I had tried to find the zoo so I could contact them, again jus for my own peace of mind.

 I could find no such place and the train derailment story itself was buried in the headlines. No clue what that could have meant. Ma would scream coverup so I kept that from her. The second fucked up thing is it seemed the authorities had abandoned us. Animal control came out once, picked up some bodies and never came back. Deputy Soso had come by one night after Someone called about heckling and scratching at the door. He had gone around back and found scratch marks on the door but no animal. He also never came back. Maybe I've been around my mother too much, but something stunk around here.

This went on for a few more nights, until August 28th. I'll never forget that night. On the 27th, I had heard a massive crashing sound like glass breaking. Then I heard Redbeard screaming. In the morning, there was a group outside his house. His front door had been busted open; trails of blood littered the yard. Like he had been dragged away into the woods. We never did find the body, even after the fact. There was an uproar of course, and the cops finally came back. They issued a strict curfew for that night and posted two cars down the road. Tomorrow morning, animal control would be coming, and they would not leave until they caught the heckling beast. 

Ma locked herself in her room that night, refused to even talk to me. I on the other hand posted up in the living room with Perry. He had been on high alert all week. He snuggled next to me on the couch while I nervously fiddled with the taser pen. I had no idea if it even still worked. The only light was the dim hue of Dexter, filling my mind with ease. That easiness did not last of course. The heckling began around 11pm. It was distant at first. Then it got closer, closer and closer until I swear, I could hear it ringing in my head like a godforsaken bell. Then the scratching began. It was piercing, like nine-inch nails on a chalkboard. I shot straight up, as did Perry. It was coming from our back door. It wasn't aggressive, at first. It pawed on the glass like a friendly neighbor asking for some sugar.

 I tiptoed to the back and saw the outside tracking light had been turned on. I Could barely make out the creature behind the glass. It was silhouetted. But it was huge. It had two massive front paws, and a massive hunched back, it sat like a gargoyle perched on its step. I could make out a long, flowing black mane, like a horse. God help me, I could see those glowing white eyes looking right at me. It spotted me gawking and opened its jaw, letting out a massive heckle. Perry stood beside me, standing his ground like the brave little solider he was. The creature was absolutely giggling to itself now, like it had its own private joke.  The stench of the thing was overwhelming, even from inside. It smelled like death, to put it lightly. The giggles subsided and gave way to a low snarl as it pursed its lips. I could see flashes of massive canines on a crimson stained maw. 

 I backed up slightly as Perry barked. With a single shove of its arm, it tore through our glass door like paper. I let out a yelp and aimed the taser pen at it, backing away. The Hyena, yes, I could see it more clearly now, was massive. As it began to further tear its way into our house, I could make out its Burgandy fur, covered in black spots. It was built like a lion, those paws. It had two long pointed ears; one was torn and ragged. Strangely the most unbelievable part was the worn leather collar around its neck. It was decayed slightly, and I could see bit of metal ticking out of it. There was also a nametag that clearly read: 

"Spot"

Spot the hyena lurched into the house, mouth agape drooling all over the floor. Its big yet narrow gaze never left me, and I swear it was smiling at me. It slowly walked over, glass crunching under its paws. The stench was horrid at this point, like sulfur and rancid meat had a baby and named it Spot The hyena.  Perry was beside me the whole time, barring his teeth and snarling right back at Spot. Spot looked like it was about to pounce, but then Perry leapt into action. He was in the air trying to tackle the beast in a blink of an eye. Spot simply swatted my 75-pound dog away, backhanding him into a wall. Perry slammed into it with a thud and instantly yelped. He collapsed to the ground and struggled to get back up, whining in pain and fear. Tears welled up in my own eyes but I didn't back down from Spot. I held out the taser like a cross against Dracula.

"Come on then." I heard myself mutter. Spot pounced, I fell back and hit the ground, shattering my spine. Spot pinned me down and instantly went for my throat. Lucky for me my arm got in the way. His teeth cut into me like butter, gnawing at my forearm. A surge of pain and adrenaline hit me at once and instead of screaming I Jammed the taser pen in Spots's ear with all my might. It still worked. Spot yelped and laughed in pain. He jumped off me, sipping at my chest with his claws. He barely touched me, but my shirt was torn and I could see three red drips start to form on my stomach. I got up as quickly as I could, and almost passed out immediately. Spots mouth foamed with what I hope was just fury, and I readied myself for another strike. Thats when I heard Perry bark with the force of a billion wolves. It caught Spot's attention just long enough for me to strike first, jabbing him in the neck this time . Spot lurched back and Perry attacked from Spot's blindside.

 It was a flurry of furry action then, both Spot and Perry locked in mortal combat. They rolled around on the ground, Perry latched onto the beast's neck and Spot sinking his claws into Perry's back. Despite all that Perry never yelped once. He stood his ground ripping at the thick neck of the hyena. I tried, I tried so hard to break them up, to save Perry. But I was knocked back onto the floor by their struggle. Blood covered our once gray tiles floor. I remember hoping most of it was from Spot. The two gladiators let go of each other for only a moment, and with a roar Perry pounced on the Hyena and tackled him through the broken door and onto the lawn. I lost track of them then as Spot started to limp away but Perry gave chase. I must have blacked out for only a moment. I came to and slowly collected myself. My back was killing me, a massive bite wound as already swelling on my arm. I couldn't bear to look t my stomach. Only one thing concerned me at the moment. I made my way outside and called for Perry.

 I could hear commotion outside and people were rushing over to our house. Couple of them even had guns. I followed some spackles of blood loosely into my backyard and under the old oak wood giant laid both Spot and Perry. Spot laid silent under the giant, a vacant look in its eyes. His throat had been torn out, a feat only a good boy like Perry could do. Perry himself was only a couple feet away. Hi chest was moving erratic and he as panting nonstop, but he was alive. I limped over as fast as I could over to him, my voice hoarse with grief. 

"Perry-Perry-Perry its ok boy good boy you're such a good boy." I knelt down beside him and inspected the damage. He was drenched in blood, several deep claw marks on his back and head. His eyes looked up at me and he pawed at me. I shushed him and held him close and patted his little head. It was all I could do to repay him. Tears hit Perry's snout, and he licked them off my face as best he could. He was always thinking of me, even then. 

A crowd started to gather in my backyard, a siren wailed in the distance. People were pointing in awe of the massive creature Perry had vanquished. Inside my mother was yelling, complaining about what that racket was. I didn't care about any of that. I just wanted Perry to be ok.

 No one ever did get a clear answer on what the hyena was, or where it even came from. Animal control took the body, took some statements and we never heard back. Never even made the news, far as I can tell. Of course, conspiracy reigns on my street, with ma at the top of that shit heap. Most popular theory is that it escaped from a train bound for a government lab, some kind of super hyena. 

Second most was it was the pet of some rich asshole up in the mountains, got lose and escaped. Ma claimed that we should be on the lookout for hybrids now. 

"It was out in the woods for god knows how long Abbey Mae. Probably slipped it into all sorts of creatures." My mother, the poet. Of course, I knew that was a ridiculous thought. What, in a couple years there would be were-hyenas roaming the forest? It was laughable, I don't even think they can crossbreed with anything out here. But then again, no one expected a hyena to be in New Hampshire. That last thought was always in the back of my mind. I came out of it ok, just some scars on my body and mind, what's a few more. I became sort of a local hero in the neighborhood, both me and Perry. 

Perry. It was touch and go for a little while, but I finally got some news. Its why I'm posting this today. 

Today is the day I can finally bring him home and give him all the treats he deserves.
