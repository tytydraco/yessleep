 hi. i dont really know how to start this because i could write pages among pages among pages of things that have happened in this house. and before anyone asks, some beliefs/entities/experiences i talk about may slightly contradict each other and i dont really have an explanation as to why, im just stating what has happened to my family and what i believe is causing it.

side note ANY and all advice from believers/nonbelievers/any religious standpoint is very welcome because at this point its getting worse pretty much constantly.

*the backstory of my house*\- so my house is in a rural area. it was built in the 70's and we moved in about 7 years ago from a neighboring state. when the realtor sold this house to us, he told us that a family of five had been killed in this house in a robbery gone sideways in the early 2000s. which is kinda terrifying looking back but whatever. we also came to learn that this area is an old Native American burial ground. which is extremely ironic and kinda effed up considering our neighborhood is named the lost colony and street names are based off of things to do with it.

now to get into some experiences i feel the need for categories because again i believe there are several types of entities/things here. first ill start with the Mimics. (sk\*\* wa\*\*\*\*\*, i dont feel comfortable even typing that name) my neighbors, family, and i have seen things in and around our neighborhood, that can only be described as such. ive seen deer on their hind legs, walking in our backyard for an OBSCENE ammount of time, another time my dog wouldnt go near any of us for around 3 days and was growling and had an extremely unsettling look in his eyes, and was foaming at the mouth. (we got him checked for rabies and it wasnt that) my neighbor, who has lived here since he was born, claims to have seen mountain lions, bears, and deformed creatures his entire life. (neither of those are common here) and i think the scariest, my mom seeing a wild boar in our front yard, while she was out there grabbing groceries. and it wasnt normal. it wasnt walking right. not in a hurt type of way but in a way that seemed it had never walked before in its life.

the next thing is the sleep paralysis. all four people in my family experience it on at least a once every month basis. and we all see the same thing. a shadow, with orange waxy and melting eyes, somewhere in our room. even people who have come to spend the night, who have never experienced it before our house, have had it and experienced the same thing.

misc things- doors being locked from the inside randomly (we have turn locks, not push locks), hearing what sounds like women/kids/babies crying and screaming at night, constant shadows, and the feeling of being watched. always. i dont think ive ever spent a second inside this house without feeling like something is watching me.

again, i am open to all theroies and suggestions. i just need to get this off of my chest because nobody except for the people who have spent time in this neighborhood believe me.
