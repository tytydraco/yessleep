I once worked as a direct care aid for a 65-year-old woman with a developmental disability. Her daughter, who was in her 40s, worked overnights and needed a caretaker with medical experience to watch her overnight. When I say I once worked for them, I mean I literally worked just one night, and you're about to hear why I never went back.  
  
The 65-year-old woman's name was Martha, and her daughter's name, who contacted me, was Colleen. It's possible Colleen didn't have any other family to watch her mother and didn't want to or couldn't afford to put Martha in a nursing home. Or perhaps she felt more comfortable hiring somebody with some form of experience to watch over her. At the time, I was already a direct care worker for two other women who suffered from some forms of developmental disabilities, so I had experience. But nothing prepared me for that night.  
  
Colleen left for work earlier that day; I had worked my first job, so I was really pushing my body to exhaustion, trying to make as much money as possible. Colleen had introduced Martha and me. Martha had given me a smile before Colleen brought her upstairs to her bedroom for the night. It was around 9 PM when Colleen told me that Martha would sometimes walk around the house at night, acting confused, and I'd need to calm her down and bring her back to her room. She specifically addressed this as not being a form of sleepwalking. When I asked, she said it's one of the symptoms of her mother's dementia. I told her to rest assured that I'd know how to handle it.  
  
I spent my time initially in the living room, catching up on my show. These jobs aren't super glamorous, and for the most part, it's a lot of sitting around. I heard footsteps from upstairs. I went to the stairway and looked up the stairs, then called Martha's name, asking if she needed anything. She didn't answer. I heard her footsteps go back to her room, and then the door closed. Maybe she went to the bathroom. I went back to the living room and watched some more TV.  
  
It was maybe an hour later that I got up to grab my sandwich that I brought from the fridge. As I left the kitchen with a plate and my sandwich to go back to the couch, I nearly had a heart attack and dropped the plate when I saw Martha standing at the doorway, glass shattered everywhere. I apologized to her and asked if she was okay. She started yelling at me, "Who are you?" I reminded her who I am, "I'm her direct care worker here to make sure she's okay." Everything she said at this point was in a loud scream, "Why are you here?" I don't know you," and things of that nature. I reminded her that we had just met and that her mother Colleen hired me to watch her in the house. This seemed to work for long enough for me to get her to come back upstairs with me and to her room. I brought her a glass of water and some melatonin and ensured she took both before going back downstairs.  
  
After a few hours, I was absolutely exhausted. I had to get a couple of hours of shut-eye. There was a spare bedroom upstairs with a twin-sized bed where Colleen said I could rest if needed. I felt like at this point, Martha was asleep for the night from the melatonin. I fell asleep within minutes, but I was asleep for only maybe an hour.  
  
I woke up to a sound from downstairs. It was this repeated slamming every one to two seconds. Something from downstairs was being slammed. I jumped out of the bed; I had left the bedroom door open so that I'd hear anything if Martha got up. Case in point right here. When I got to the stairs, I realized the slamming was coming from the kitchen. I walked down the stairs in as quick of a speed as I could while still remaining quiet.

 Getting to the bottom, I peered around the opening to the kitchen, and what I saw was like a scene from a scary movie I'd seen before. I saw Martha in the darkness standing in front of the oven, repeatedly opening it and slamming it shut. It was horrifying. When I say I saw Martha, I really only saw her silhouette. It was that dark in the kitchen. I said, "Martha," really loudly, and she stopped, turned to her left at me, shut the oven door one final time, and started walking towards me, toward the stairs. I said in a now softer, kind of scared-sounding voice, "Are you okay?" 

She got close enough to me where I could now see her facial features, and she looked at me with this blank expression, then walked right past me and started walking up the stairs. I followed her upstairs, but as soon as she got to her room, she slammed her door shut. I knocked on the door, saying, "Martha, are you all right?" She didn't respond. I quietly opened the door just to peek inside, and I saw Martha at the side of her bed, just standing facing the wall. I've seen a lot, but this was some pretty unsettling behavior that I feel like is the exact kind of stuff you'd see in some scary movies, like I mentioned before. 

I walked over to her and gently eased her into the bed. When she was laying down, I covered her, and for what I was hoping would be the final time, I said, "Good night, Martha," and shut her door. I went across the upstairs to the spare room and went back to bed. I purposely tried not to fall asleep for at least half an hour, just in case she'd wake up again, but I don't even know if I made it that long. All I know is I fell asleep pretty freaking quickly.  
  
I woke up once again, however much later. The room was still pitch black, and the one-hour alarm I set had not yet gone off. I looked around the room, wondering what woke me up. I didn't see what it was until I heard a sound from inside the closet. I then noticed the cracked-open closet door and the black shadow of a head peeking out of the closet. Again, I almost had a heart attack. I said, "Martha." She didn't answer. 

I kept saying, "Martha," a bunch of times until she pushed the door open, and I saw her approaching the bed slowly. She started saying what she was saying hours ago again, "Who are you? I don't know you." As she got closer, I tried calming her down, reminding her who I am. I reached for the lamp next to the bed and fumbled with it until it turned on. Martha was holding a huge kitchen knife in her hand. At this moment, everything changed. Martha was now a threat to my life, and I had to worry about myself, not her. I screamed at this point, "Martha, put the knife down!" I guess my scream stressed her out because she got closer and started screaming back at me, still repeating, "I don't know you." I wasn't going to attempt to calm down a knife-wielding dementia patient. 

That was not in any job description. I mapped out a way to run around her in the bedroom, and I went for it. I jumped off the bed on the side further from her, and she screamed again, "Who are you?" She swung the knife at the air as I ran past her. It was a slow and weak swipe from what I saw, but nonetheless, it showed that she had intentions of actually using it. I got downstairs, grabbed my shoes, and went outside. Instead of calling 911, I called Colleen, as she requested I do if there's an issue. I was courteous in doing this because getting law enforcement involved is never doing anyone any favors. Colleen was yelling into the phone at me not to leave her, and honestly, I yelled back that she attempted to kill me and that I didn't call the police. She had to leave work.

 Of course, I stayed outside of the house, making sure Martha didn't go anywhere until Colleen returned. When Colleen went inside, Martha was back in her bed asleep. Colleen went as far as accusing me of exaggerating the whole thing until she found the knife next to Martha's bed. To not give her any more fuel to blame me for any of this, I left out the fact that I ever went to sleep. But that doesn't mean that I felt in any way I did anything wrong. Colleen even offered me that room to sleep. I never worked in that house again. Martha was a scarier patient than I'd ever dealt with in any of my jobs in my 9 years of being a direct care aid.
