Yeah, you read the title. It’s been a rough couple of days, and I know it’s going to keep getting worse until I’m dead and gone along with the woman I married. I’m sorry, God. I apologize to mine and my wife’s family. I’m just an overall pathetic piece of shit it seems. I was ridiculed throughout our entire marriage. She’d laugh and bicker about my incompetence in bed, and my entry-level job; she’d even pop off about my mother just to get under my skin. She was mean even when she didn’t mean to be but I loved her with all my heart. I loved her cute little smile, the way her eyes glistened in the sun, I was just absolutely stupidly in love with her. Her beauty was unmatched and thus made her insults meaningless to me. All I could see through her malice and hatred was my stunning bride; my perfect angel and reason for being. For 10 years I loved her, even with her flaws. That is until last week. All day she was going on about every problem she’d ever had with me. “You know your hair looks really fucking stupid today. I can’t believe I’m still being seen in public with you because you look actually disgusting.” She knew how to snicker in just the right tone to make me grind my teeth. I tried, I really tried to bite my tongue and let it go. I even remained silent when she pulled out the classic, “I should’ve married someone who could actually give me children.” Apparently my silence hadn’t been what she was looking for in our relationship though because in response to this she started saying things that I’d never heard before. “You’re really not gonna fight back at all?” she asked. I looked at her, confused. “How do you mean, darling” I replied.

“Uhp see there you go again. You really don’t even have the fucking balls to defend yourself when your own wife is degrading you? You’re a sad, pathetic little man, bro. What’d you think that I’d want some pussy who just lets me say what I want when I want? You’re a fucking loser Steven, and I want a divorce. I’ve wasted too many years waiting for you to man up and treat me how I want to be treated.” How she wants to be treated? I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I mean after 10 years of stomaching every hateful comment, every ear piercing scream; here she was, telling me she wants to leave me. “Is that how you really feel?” is all I could think to ask. She scoffed and started rapping again. “Is that how I feel? Ha..How do you fucking feel Steven? How do you feel knowing that I’m the one thing you’ve ever done right your entire loser fucking life? And how do you feel knowing that now you don’t even have that? Better yet, how do you feel knowing that I’m going to take half of the nothing that you own you fucking bum?” What I felt was cold and numb. I couldn’t even feel anger all I felt was a tugging in my gut telling me to do something I should’ve done a long time ago. Without thinking I grabbed a tire iron from my backseat, and smashed my wife’s face in with it. I heard the sickening cracks of her skull splintering open as blood and bone pelted my passenger window. I wasn’t even shocked at what I had done but what I was shocked about was the fact that my wife…was laughing.

———————————

A golfball sized hole was oozing thick red blood out of her forehead and she still just would not stop fucking laughing. I hit her again, this time right above her right ear. When I swung the tire iron lodged a good 6 inches directly into my bride’s brain; and I sat with my jaw dropped as the laughter amplified. “Hahahaha you can’t even kill me right you stupid son of a bitch. Hahahaha.” she cackled. I was horrified. I ran around to her side of the car and dragged her out. Though there were still words and laughter coming from her mouth, no life remained in her body and dragging her up our porch into our house was incredibly tiresome. “Uh oh! Somebody should’ve worked all that lard off when I told them to, hahahaha. Maybe we wouldn’t even be in this position if I actually had a strong hot husband, hahahaha.” “Please be quiet.” I pleaded. “I’m so sorry this happened.” “Hahahaha I’m dead and gone because of you and you still can’t be a man you pathetic fucking bastard, hahahaha.” I dragged her to the garage and sprawled her out on the floor. “This is the most you’ve touched me in years big boy.” she moaned. “What’s got you so riled up, hahahaha? It take killing me for that dick to finally work? Hahahaha.” I went to my workbench to get a hacksaw and then I got to work. With each limb I removed a new deafening wave of horrendous laughter would fill the garage.

I even tried sawing open her throat to destroy her vocal cords but somehow she still continued with her obscenities. “New slit for you to not touch, huh Steven?” “This is the hardest I’ve ever seen you work for me, isn’t that right Steven?” I’d gotten down to nothing but a head and torso before the wild laughter finally subsided. However, it was soon replaced with the sounds of light snickering and giggling. I looked up and met eyes with my wife. “It’s till death do us part, Steven, and I don’t think I’m ready to die just yet.” Her words stung me and my eyes began to tear up a bit. “I’m not dying before you, honey. I’m not letting you have the satisfaction of knowing that you won something for once in your miserable life.” We’ve been sitting here for the past 4 days. The insults and laughs have fully subsided now and what has replaced them is the rhythmic, sing-song sound of my wife’s voice repeating “do it” over and over again and you know what? I’m going to. I figured I’d write this as closure for those close to us so you guys know the reasoning behind the state of me and my wife. I love you all, and I really am… truly sorry.
