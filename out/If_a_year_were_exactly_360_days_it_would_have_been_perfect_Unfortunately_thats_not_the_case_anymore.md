I'm not saying it's all a simulation or there's a creator or anything like that. It doesn't really matter to me. I'm not looking for a cause. I'm not even looking for logic. All I know is that it would have been very satisfying. For all of us, really. Imagine the calendars, schedules, and lots of other things I'm not smart enough to think of.

I'm a conspiracy theory addict, but I'm not interested in other people's theories, only my own. When I think of something, I do everything in my power to back that theory up. I'll research the possibility of it, even on the most shady websites. I'll watch the most notorious YouTubers, as long as they agree with me. And as long as it's not definitively wrong and there is some uncertainty, I am ready to fill that gap with any kind of nonsense. I mean, come on. 360 degrees, 360 days. It was literally invented for this. You know, the orbit and the stars and stuff. It has to be, right?

This was a juicy one. Most people thought the same as me. Lots of articles and questions on the web. Some say it's unrelated that the numbers are so close to each other, but no one says it's impossible. And that's good enough for me to dig more.

After a few days, I found a guy on a random forum. He was using the same nickname on a few different websites and spamming the same story on every one of them. I'm saying 'him,' even though I don't know their gender. Maybe it's because I saw some part of myself in their madness.

It was something about Leap Day, February 29. All of his posts had headlines like it was a YouTube clickbait.

'DON'T GET LOST ON LEAP DAY. YOU'LL LOSE YOUR MIND!'

'GOVERNMENT DOESN'T TELL YOU THE TRUTH ABOUT LEAP DAY, IT'S A TRAP!'

'DON'T LEAVE YOUR HOME ON FEBRUARY 29, IF YOU WANT TO LIVE!'

&#x200B;

Listen, I always like some mind-blowing action and I've found what I've been looking for. But this is beyond me. This guy is tripping. At least that's what I thought at first. Then I started reading.

Format-wise, these posts were a nightmare. It was readable enough, but very hard to keep track of. Probably the reason his 'warnings' never got enough attention. But man...

Anyway, I tried my best to reorganize all the information he gave into a more understandable form. This is not his first post, but in my opinion, it is the most important one to understand the whole picture.

\######### Reason: Incident Report 14####-B

Officer: Dr. #####

\###### #### ######## : ####

Personnel Codename: Brady, Wayne

**LOG 1 of 4**

\#####: Captain Brady? Are you ready for our interview?

Brady: No need for that, I'm retired for good.

\#####: Alright, Mr. Brady then.

Brady: Listen, man. I filled so much reports, you can make a whole library just for me. Why don't you just read them? I'm tired. I don't want to be rude but I usually end up explaining the same things to different people.

\#####: I'm not here to talk about the incidents.

Brady: What then? 'Cause even I'm not sure what's really going on.

\#####: I'm confident that the necessary conclusions will be drawn from the reports you wrote. What I'm curious about, however, is YOUR interpretation of all this information. What do you think is going on?

Brady: Oh... Nobody asked that before.

Brady: ...

Brady: You are asking for my personal opinion? My non-military perspective?

\#####: ...

Brady: Alright. But first of all, listen Doctor. It's not my job to warn you, but still... You know you have to be very careful for the rest of your life, after listening to me, right?

\#####: I'm aware of the risks, yes. You know very well that someone has to do this. And I volunteered to be here.

Brady: I respect that. Then my last question is, are you going to record this?

\#####: Only on text, and for my eyes only. It needs to be recorded somehow. In case of...

Brady: Yeah, I get it. Well, let's see... You want the short one? Or the long one?

\#####: How about somewhere in the middle? We have time but I don't want you to feel forced.

Brady: Okay, what I think is going on is that something latched onto earth very long time ago. I don't know what it is. And I'm definitely not going to read my own reports. I am almost an old man. I don't want to risk losing any more of my life. But what I know is: this thing came here to prey on earth. It crashed onto earth so hard, the earth got a little bit slower.

\#####: By slower you mean the rotation?

Brady: No, the orbit. Earth was faster before. Doctor Carlson told me that it would not impact the life on earth catastrophically, and it was possible. "Only some minor climate-related changes" he said.

\#####: I see, I'm informed that I can't ask you anything about this entity that...

Brady: ...Hit the earth, yes.

\#####: Because you don't remember?

Brady: I have some idea. After a while it gets a little... complicated is the right word I guess. I still remember some of it.

\#####: Enlighten me as much as you can, please.

Brady: I think it is a place more than it is a being. It's both, maybe. I don't know. Entity is a good word. I also don't know if it can think, has a mind of it's own. It's behavior could be solely instinctual. Like an animal.

\#####: And what is this behavior?

Brady: Like any other animal, I think. It eats. I'm not sure what it eats exactly. From my experience, it eats everything. And by everything, I mean anything. Not just, humans, animals, oxygen or water. You know, physical things. But also, concepts. Abstract stuff like ideas, beliefs, perception... Everything.

\#####: What happens to the things it ate?

Brady: I don't really know, since I can't perceieve those stuff neither here or there. But I saw some of the physical ones, even met some of them. They had changed. Like... corrupted. Some of them were really evil. But others, just dormant. Doing whatever they do, doesnt even pay attention to you. I tried not to provoke them. And you're gonna ask, what do they do exactly, right?

\#####: Well?

Brady: I don't remember that much, just weird stuff. I bet it's somewhere in my files.

\#####: Understood.  My current theory is that It might be attracted to us because of our minds. consciousness means an infinite potential for ideas. "A concept-farm" if you will. If it consumes both physical and non-physical things, It must have found Earth a lot more tempting than Mars or any other planets. Because while others have only one, we have both.

Brady: Exactly. That's... Yeah.

\-------------------------------------------------

Cool story right? Or should I say, concept. There's a lot more. If this is true, I don't know how this guy got his hands on these files. But they seem to be somewhat legit. They all have a seal on them. It says:

"The Imp"

Later I learned that it's short for "The Improvisers" . I'll share those files too, don't worry. I would have post everything chronologically. But that way it get's a lot more complicated trust me.

This next one is a section from the "Reports" of this Brady person. It's written more like a diary than a report. It's not even a diary, to be honest. My guess is that it's the written version of some voice recordings. But it's not in a transcript format.

I don't know the time-gap between these two files, but I'm sharing them in this order because they seem to be a continuation of the same topic. Since I haven't fully grasped the whole story, I thought it would be more logical to reinforce the information at hand.

The title of this file is "Curator." I've cut out some parts because most of it was random words and phrases. I think the audio recording was corrupted at certain intervals. However, they still documented the moments when it was working properly. In those moments, they discussed which direction to go, how to go, or what was there. There is no clear information about who the speakers were. But almost everyone he was speaking with was warning Brady about the "Curator".

There is no information about whether the Curator is a human or what they look like.

\-------------------------------------------------

...

*"I reckon you've met the doctor. Don't worry he can't come here. He knows this is my territory. "*

"Who are you?"

*"I'm kinda like him. We all are. He's a creepy fella, no doubt on that. But he's trying to help. You see, almost everything here tries to eat something. All they want... All WE want is to consume, add another thing to the endless void. You might think It's because of the hunger. That's not the case. It's more like a reflex. A second nature. We eat things just like how you breath air. "*

(A brief pause)

*"And the doctor. He eats stress... or was it anxiety? I don't remember. Maybe bad emotions in general. That guy is the embodiment of bed-side manner. Of course he's not really trying to help, that was a figure of speech. He's trying to purge the bad feelings... By eating them of course. Is he really a doctor? Can he actually heal any wounds? That's another question.*

*You asked who I was. Well, I'm more like the opposite of that. Like an anti-doctor."*

"So you make people sick? Give them disease."

*"No no, god no. I don't give anybody anything. None of us do. We only take. Only eat."*

"Then what? You eat health, wellness?"

*"Wrong again. But close."*

"Do you eat excitement, because I'm starting to get bored."

*"Hahahaha. Man... How long has it been? A week? You internalized everything very quickly, I'm telling you something supernatural and you make jokes about it the next second. You are a natural. I wonder what you'll choose to eat when you get digested."*

"Are you saying you're going to eat me?"

*"Oh but, you are already engulfed my friend. You are just waiting your turn to get digested. This place, this... world, ate us all. That's why we are all here. When I eat something, I keep it with me forever. But this place... It also changes it. Turns us into devourers, just like itself. Like a god creating his children in his own image."*

"Where did it... this place, come from?'

*"I don't know man. Do your last sandwich know where did you come from? I am just lunch, and you are dinner."*

"Then, what do you eat?"

*"Oh, so you give up. Dissapointing. Okay then. I'll tell you. Do you know what cancer feels like Brady? Dementia? Or my favourite, depression.*

*Some say, it's a curse. Or fate, yeah... That's a good one. You'll hear that a lot. The ill themselves can't explain it. At least properly...*

*But the healthy, they think it's something like a "Sadness Flu". You sneeze some cries for a few days. Get yourself warm inside a locked room for about a week. And then you're good to go. Don't forget to drink some comedy movies for your immune system. And if you are really sick, maybe you should listen to your doctor and take some summer vacations on a full stomach three times a day. Hah.*

*But if you ask me, I would say, it's more like the ocean. The one you are in the middle of it. Struggling every second to stay on the surface. Of course the people on land will shout advice at you from the comfortable, hot beach. "Hey, my guy. Don't panic, I've been in a pool before. Just lay on your back, the water will lift you up."*

*Well, there are no waves in the pools, smart-ass. Matter in fact, no fish, no seagrass, no day/night cycle, no salt, no sharks and no other depressed people. Also, it doesn't change with the weather everyday.*

*But nobody dropped you here from a helicopter. You got here yourself from the shore. Swam through every mile of it until you eventually got lost.*

*Well the good news is, you are a very good swimmer now. Since you got here all by yourself. And the bad news... it's obvious of course.*

*You can keep pushing yourself to stay on top. But it's starting get hurt. You can try to find the land by pushing yourself a little more than usual, and also getting hurt a little more. But you don't know which way is the right one at this point, and if you choose the wrong one, all you're going to do is growing the distance between you and the land.*

*So it makes the most sense to stay where you are, try to save your energy, save time, wait for help.*

*But you know it very well that at some point you're gonna get exhausted. Even lifting a finger will hurt so much. Hell, maybe you deserve it. Maybe you are a coward. Because you didn't even roll the dice and try to swim towards some random direction. Or maybe you are very brave because you did SOMETHING. You didn't give up. You stayed on the surface as long as you could. Surely someone will notice your absence on the beach. You spent your whole life there. They're surely searching for you right now. The help will arrive.*

*Your nose and mouth always filled with salt-water. It's been too long since you drank some real water. You miss it. You are so tired but also very afraid. Only thing keeping you alive is the adrenaline of constant stress. And at that point, if you stop trying.... If you let go... is it really giving up? Or is it fate? What options do you have left? Which one was the right choice? What is the correct answer? ...Well, I'm afraid there was only one cure. And you chose wrong."*

"What was it then, the cure?"

*"Now to think of it, I don't actually remember. But it was very tasty."*

...

\-----------------------------------------------

After that section, it becomes unreadable again. There are no numbers or dates on the files. But there are other files mentioning the Curator encounter in past tense. It's definitely not the last one. Curator says it's been a week so my guess is it's one of the earlier ones. Probably 7th or 8th file.

I don't if the guy who posted these things is still active. His last post was almost 3 years ago. I haven't read all off of it and I will try to edit these mumbo-jumbos as much as I can. But it's going to take a long time to finish all of it.

I'm not a good "writer", so I'm not sure which file I should share next time for the story progression.

From what I read, I can give more information about:

\-the Entity/Place (I think I'm gonna call it The Devourer because none of the files have a name for it and it's gonna become confusing real fast.)

\-"The Improvisers"

\-Who the Captain Brady is.

Or I can post one of the other files called "The Doctor."

And I think I know which "report" is the first one. But after that it get's hard to order them.

You guys can choose.
