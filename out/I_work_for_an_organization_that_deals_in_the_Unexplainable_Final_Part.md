Hello, I'll keep this part swift, Unfortunately, I am not the man you know as Pepper. If you have read the previous parts you have at least heard of me. People call me Mouse. But I’m not here to tell you my story  I won’t keep you in the dark. Pepper is dead. I wish I could say he got out, that he went on to have a normal life and he was no longer haunted by his work. But no he died how he lived buried in his work. I'm loyal to the organization I work for and I will be to the end. So loyal that I thought about not putting this out, and even after deciding I would not use my code name. But I guess in the end I was more loyal to my friend.

Pepper kept notes of all his cases. Some of the stories you read were straight out of his journal and I’m almost surprised that he didn’t make the stories as long as they are in his journal. But I understand why he didn’t this one gonna be longer than the rest. This one coming straight outta his journal. It’s his final case the one that got him to the end it was an honor to be part of it.

Pepper’s Journal.

Only a couple of days have passed since the last case. The organization already called me in for another one. This one was different I walked into the same meeting I’d been in so many times before ready to be sent on another near-death experience. Before getting my case report I was handed something else. The director slid me a little gift box. I was confused was it my birthday or anniversary, I don’t keep track of that stuff anymore. I opened it and was shocked.

“Congratulations Pepper,” The director said.

“I never thought I'd live to see this day,” I said.

It was a badge similar to the one I always kept on me but with one key difference. This one said level one field agent. That made me one of 4 agents in the organization with that rank. With that, I was given a case file. It was another unusual one I was leading, not the first one I’ve led but this one allowed me to choose two agents of any rank to come join me. Of course, I chose Trojan he was the number one agent in the organization and one of the few I knew I could trust. For the other one, I wanted Mouse with me. Even with his lack of arm and eye, he was still one of the smartest guys I knew.

Through experience I've noticed something, it doesn’t matter if you are Christian, or if you are Buddhist, or if you follow Norse mythology in some capacity they are all right. That even includes the demonic. You may think that’s a little silly. But I’ve seen demons and I’ve killed them. But the problem with fighting them is if you do not believe that a cross will kill them then it won’t. That's the struggle of making yourself believe. You might think that after doing it once you will be fine to do it again. But it is not that simple.

Demons are the easiest thing to identify for organizations. Unlike everything else, we deal with the purely in it for the sport to make you feel pain. So when the case file said most likely a demonic force I got ready to fight a demon. Guns, knives, and explosives are all useless. Just like that, I stood in front of the site with both Mouse and Trojan. We all had nothing but a cross in our hands.

“I never believed in religion, until I got this job,” Mouse said.

“I don’t think there are biblical demons more like a monster that was born from the idea we have of demons” Trojan replied.

Looking at him you’d think he was nothing but a meathead but he was often very insightful.

“So you don't believe in an afterlife,” Mouse asked

“I’d rather there not be one,” Trojan said.

The site was a mansion, a modern one. Some rich oil tycoon lived there at some point but he’s been missing for some time. His disappearance was investigated by local authorities who were attacked. There was only one survivor; he described what they were fighting as a humanoid constantly shifting his form. Bullets didn’t do anything to it, they could move the room around them. It constantly changed the layout of the mansion like it was trying to keep them stuck there.

We opened the door and the mansion was beautiful. Marbled floors, several large glass windows couldn’t be seen through, and a large gorgeous chandelier.

“We keep together, we split, it kills us all,” I say.

“You act like we ain’t ever killed a demon,” Trojan replies.

“Doesn’t matter, this one feels different.”

“Lead the way,” Mouse says.

I take a marker and begin marking the rooms we go through as we wander the mansion. This paid off. I saw one of the many marks I put on the next rose we went in. We were traveling in a straight line through the room although we’d come back to the room we’d been in. I then traveled backward into the room we had just come from. It was different. It was already shifting rooms and we hadn’t even seen it yet. But this proved it had limits; it couldn't add new rooms, just rearranged what was already there.

I didn’t understand at the time what that meant. It was only after the case was over that I was able to look into Trojan’s file. It made sense where his unnatural abilities came from. He was born into a cult that worshiped a large fly-like being they called the One. When he turned 18 he was given as sacrifice to this creature. But instead of willingly dying to it he chooses to fight. During the fight, he managed to kill it and the creature's blood mutated his DNA. Giving him his intense strength and durability, and his blood. That anytime an unexplainable creature took from his blood they were severely weakened. Pepper never told me this but it’s clear to me now he knew. Just in case you're wondering after Trojan left the cave of the creatures he turned on the cult and killed them all. Sometime later he was found by the organization.

Journal end.

At this point, Pepper stopped writing. He was always putting down notes in his journal. He wrote everything down. I asked him once why he did it. Why did he have to document everything? He said someday someone’s gonna read it and maybe my experience can save them. That’s the man he was always thinking of others. It was unusual that he stopped writing. I guess he knew what was coming.

From this point on the events of the day are from my point of view. I had come to the same conclusion that it was in the room with us and before we could figure out what it could be I watched as Trojan. No, his real name was Micheal Avernatch. I watched as the strongest man I had ever met, the man that seemed unkillable was punctured through the chest right through his heart and if there was god he blessed that man cause not even that could bring him down.

He swiped around pulling the cross from his belt; the end of it was pointed; he shoved it down at the demon. It dodged back, placing itself into the next room. Demons aren’t what you think they are. The red humanoid isn’t accurate, their more of a shifting mass of grey goo that can change its shape. This one hid in the shadows of the curtain. Perfectly forming in the shape of the shadow

“You alright,” Pepper asked Trojan.

“I’ve had worse,” he replied.

At first, I thought the wound had hit his heart but it narrowly missed. It didn’t seem to affect even as blood poured down his chest he stood there as if nothing had happened. We went in the direction after it.

“I’ve never seen that before,” Pepper said.

“Seen what?” I asked.

“A demon like that, they're smart but not so smart as to shape themselves into a shadow. This one is far beyond anything I’ve dealt.” Pepper said.

“On top of that they're not ambush predators, those things feed on fear,” Trojan replied.

I’ll admit it in my career I’ve never met or dealt with a demon. So I’m not very knowledgeable of what they're like. But I got what they were saying.

“It’s not a demon is it,” I said.

They didn’t answer but the silence was enough for me. It meant we were even more underpowered than we thought the one weapon we thought we had the cross was useless and was just a knife. It can shift form, it can control the area around us, and its look can be mistaken for what we know as a demon. That left me with one out there theory.

“It’s a copy,” I said.

Copies are monsters that are ambush predators and they are devilishly smart. They have a unique trait in that they can take the form of any nonliving thing but can take the forms of living things if one condition is met. They have to eat whatever creature they are mimicking. But from there they can make the noise, they have the looks, and can even take on the memories of the creature they ate.

“If it ate a demon it would solve every question but one, how is it shifting the building?” Pepper said.

My theory didn’t account for that, but at the same time copies aren't necessarily strong creatures especially compared to demons, a few bullets should take them down, but the police officer said guns were useless.

“Demons are otherworldly, you think a copy eating one could change its biology,” Trojan said.

“We have no way of killing it we need to attempt to leave,” Pepper said.

“No, I got a way to kill it,” Trojan responded.

Pepper looked down like he knew exactly what he meant, but despite my prodding, neither would tell me. We came across it again in the same room where the mansion began with the beautiful chandelier. It was in its normal form now what you’d expect a copy to look like. A skinless man running on all fours. When they were in this form they were much stronger and faster. Trojan squared it up but instead of fighting he stood there and let it take him. Giving both of us a smile as he did so. The way I wish I could explain how it unhinged its jaws and swallowed him whole. I’d worked with him a few times, and Trojan was always one to fight. He was unnaturally strong and durable he could take a hit no man could.

“He gave up,” I stood there terrified.

“No, he gave us a fighting chance,” Pepper said.

I didn’t understand a the time what that meant. It was only after the case was over that I was able to look into Trojan’s file. It made sense where his unnatural abilities came from. He was born into a cult that worshiped a large fly-like being they called the One. When he turned 18 he was given as sacrifice to this creature. But instead of willingly dying to it he chooses to fight. During the fight, he managed to kill it and the creature's blood mutated his DNA. Giving him his intense strength and durability, and his blood. That anytime an unexplainable creature took from his blood they were severely weakened. Pepper never told me this but it’s clear to me now he knew. Just in case you're wondering after Trojan left the cave of the creatures he turned on the cult and killed them all. Sometime later he was found by the organization.

His blood was potent, shortly after he was gone the creature began to writhe in pain. Pepper took no time to let it recover charging at it with his crucifix blade. Before he reached it The creature shifted the room. Suddenly we were falling toward the ceiling I landed inches from the chandelier glass shattered and I fell among it. It cut into my good arm making my body even more useless than it already was. At that moment I thought why, I don’t know why Pepper brought me, there were better options than me.

I tried pressing my feet but the damage to my body was too much. I was losing a lot of blood, focused on attempting to stop the more dangerous holes. I looked over to see Pepper. More cut than I but he wasn’t deterred. He held a piece of the shattered chandelier. The copy was much more weakened than I previously thought. He fell to the ceiling with us and was cut by the shattered glass of the chandelier. But it wasn't moving.

Pepper took the glass standing over it. He stabbed the glass straight into the creature's head. Just at the moment, the glass met with the head of the copy. It turned its hand into the same blade that stabbed Trojan. But unlike Trojan, it didn’t miss the heart. It all happened in a second as both of them stabbed each other. Unable to move my legs I crawled to him desperately clinging to the hope I could save my friend. He fell to his back. I made it to him.

I took my phone calling for backup telling him it all be okay someone was gonna save him. He grabbed my hand and stared at me and at that moment I knew he didn’t want to be saved. I tried to hold back tears as he told me.

“Don’t worry, I got some people waiting for me.”

At that moment Ken Dean Olson otherwise none as Pepper was dead. I wouldn’t bother trying to figure out anything about him, as far as I could tell the organization already scrubbed him from all records. A ceremony was held for him and Trojan and it was a lot for everyone who knew them.

Demons are the easiest thing to identify for organizations. Unlike everything else, we deal with the purely in it for the sport to make you feel pain. So when the case file said it was most likely a demonic force I got ready to fight a demon. Guns, knives, and explosives are all useless. Just like that, I stood in front of the site with both Mouse and Trojan. We all had nothing but a cross in our hands. and his friend once again.
