I could still feel the pain in my groin from where something sharp had been held almost to the point of piercing the skin. There had been blood, which I had cleaned up with a flannel and several sheets of toilet roll tissue. The pain in my groin served as a constant reminder that morning that I wasn't safe, and wouldn't be until I could figure out what Toby had done to my family. 

I hadn't touched any of the breakfast Mum had made beyond nibbling the crust off a slice of toast. Dad had excused himself and had gone upstairs; he said he was going to leave shortly to run errands. Leigh was sitting at the dinner table looking down at her phone, seemingly not paying me any attention. 

Mum had picked up the fork she had set down beside me before and had taken it back to the kitchen; I already had a fork set for me, and I had realised after the fact that she likely would have held the fork to my throat, and worse, had I not agreed to hang out with Toby when Dad had brought up the idea.  

I wanted nothing more than to go back to bed, but the memory of my family surrounding my bed, pinning me down, and threatening my life was a worse lingering pain than the one in my groin. 

Whilst I sat at the dinner table Leigh's phone pinged numerous times. I had been so lost in my own reverie I hadn't heard the first half dozen pings, but there were enough to bring me out of my thoughts. 

"What is it?" I said. 

Leigh groaned, "Nothing," she said, "Drop it." 

Before I could say anything more the doorbell rang. 

Leigh lifted her gaze from her phone to me. 

"It's probably Toby," she said. 

For a moment I wondered if I was really going to get up and go answer the door. The idea of seeing Toby after last night made me want to vomit. There was still a part of me that was willing to put up a fight with Leigh, Mum, and Dad, even after how they had threatened me. But it was a mad, insignificant, defiant part of me that was all idea and no action. I was afraid, confused, and sleep-deprived; there was simply too much bearing down on me to even consider going against my family's demands. 

Toby's arrival was uneventful and passed by like a half-remembered dream. I was so delirious with everything I had numbly greeted Toby at the door, spoke with him briefly about the weather (it was an unusually hot day), and then we ventured upstairs to my bedroom. I felt as if I were a video game character being viewed from the third person, able to move my body but not really experiencing everything first hand. 

There were brief instances where I had to make certain choices that couldn't be done on the delirious, dissociative autopilot mode I was stuck in and didn't want to leave. 

About ten minutes after I met Toby at the front door and welcomed him inside, I found myself sitting in my computer chair watching *War of Chaos's* menu emerge on the screen. 

"Do you want to play?" I said, gesturing to the keyboard and mouse. 

"No thanks," said Toby, sitting slightly behind me on my right on a chair taken from Leigh's room. 

He then added, "I prefer to watch." 

*I bet you do,* I thought. 

I played the game for an hour, continuing the campaign I had started but hadn't played for over a year. 

I sighed and stretched, having found momentary bliss in forgetting the world and concentrating as best I could on the needs of my cosmic marines. Toby hadn't said a word the entire game. I looked over my left shoulder to the doorway. 

I flinched. 

Leigh was standing at the doorway watching me with unblinking eyes. For a half second she remained motionless before she sprang to life, as if remembering to play the part of my sister. 

"Having fun?" she said, smiling, entering into my room and standing behind Toby's chair. 

"Y-yes," Toby mumbled, "Mike's playing as the Cosmic Marines. He's really good at the game." 

"Oh cool," said Leigh, "Can I watch too? Mike?" 

I realised I was clenching my fists hard enough to make my hands tremble. I opened my hands and groped for the right words to say. 

"Sure," I said, wishing the opposite but not daring to refuse what Leigh asked. 

Leigh's phone pinged again. She stuffed it into her jean pocket and left the room. I thought she might leave us be only for her to return with a chair that she placed beside Toby. She sat on it and looked beyond me to the computer screen, seemingly just as ready as Toby to watch me play the game. 

It was getting hotter in my bedroom and the slight smell of urine was present in the room coming from my bed. 

Toby began to take off his hoodie but Leigh put her hand on his wrist. 

"What are you doing?" she said. 

Toby looked at her sheepishly. 

"T-taking off my hoodie," he mumbled. 

Leigh just shook her head slightly in a 'no' gesture. 

"But it's hot," said Toby. 

Leigh shot a look my way and I felt fear stab in my chest. I did my best to casually look away from her and to fix my attention back to the game, starting the next mission, pretending not to take much notice of Leigh and Toby's disagreement. 

I heard the rustle of Toby's hoodie fabric and the creak of the plastic chair he was sitting in and then a sudden hard slap. 

"I said no," said Leigh, "Now stop it." 

There was silence between them after that.

Twenty minutes passed of me playing the game and Toby and Leigh watching. The next mission had only just gotten under way, I was fortifying my base well enough but imagined the Insectyds were going to spring an attack soon enough (they were a parasitic race which was best to avoid all possible confrontation with, since to confront them meant risk of the parasite spreading through your troops; destroying them all at once was really the only viable option to make it to the end game; they were more likely to attack first since they had a constant need to feed.) 

The clinking of glasses and the rattle of plates brought me out of the game. Mum was at the bedroom door with a tray loaded with food and drinks for us; orange juice, biscuits, and tuna sandwiches. 

Toby and Leigh accepted the drinks, both giving polite 'thank yous'. 

I hesitated to take mine, but did so, setting my share next to my keyboard. 

"Watch'a playing?" Mum asked. 

"War of Chaos," said Leigh, "Mike's really good at it." 

"Really?" said Mum, "It looks fun. Mind if I watch?" 

There was a long moment of silence. Because nobody objected, Mum went away and returned with a chair from her bedroom and sat down beside Leigh. 

I continued playing the game and noticed sweat dripping down my temple. The day had gotten much hotter, with bright beams of daylight streaming into the room. 

I wiped my brow and as I did so I looked behind me. Toby was red-faced, sweating profusely in his hoodie.

Leigh was wearing a simple top, so was handling the heat fine, and Mum had taken her cardigan off, so she wasn't too bothered by the heat either. 

They all drank their glasses of orange juice and, almost identically, dipped a biscuit into their glass, soaked it into the orange juice and ate it.

Soon after there was a sudden rustling of clothing. Toby had taken his hoodie off. Leigh and Mum's eyes stared at him unblinkingly after he did this. Then, after a moment, Mum forced a smile and mumbled something about 'getting the clothes out of the wash', and left the room. 

Leigh looked away from Toby as she thought about what he had just done. It became immediately clear to me as soon as Toby had taken off his hoodie why Leigh might have been so against it. 

Toby had at least a dozen criss-cross scars across both forearms.

I pretended not to notice and went back to my game. Shortly after Toby broke the silence. 

"I think I'm going to go home now," he said. 

"No, you're staying," said Leigh. 

Toby stood up suddenly. 

"I can't do this," he said, "This isn't what I wanted." 

"I know it isn't," said Leigh, "But now you have to live with what you've done. You don't have a choice." 

I wondered if throughout all this I was supposed to even be aware this conversation was happening. What scared me most was how they were now having this kind of conversation with me in the room, as if what I thought about any of it no longer mattered. 

"I'm going," said Toby, and he started off towards the bedroom doorway. 

"No!" said Leigh. 

And then I felt sharp edges against the topmost part of my left ear. 

"No-don't-please-no-stop!" said Toby. 

I dare not look behind me but I could just make out in the thin black plastic of my PC monitor the sight of Leigh holding a steak knife to my left ear. 

"If you don't sit down *right now* I swear I'll do it," said Leigh. 

Toby started to whimper. I remained as still as I could manage, silently wishing for Toby to listen to Leigh. 

"*Please*," said Toby, beginning to sob, "Please, I just want to go home." 

I felt the teeth of the knife dig into my ear, drawing blood. Tears streamed down my cheeks as I trembled, doing everything in my power not to move should Leigh decide to carve into my ear with as much force as she could muster. 

Toby hurried over to the chair and sat down. 

"I don't want to do this," said Leigh, "But you're making me do this. Behave. Are you going to *behave?"* 

"Y-yes," said Toby, pitifully. 

"Good," said Leigh. 

"P-please," I said, choking the word out, "Why are you doing this?" 

Leigh sighed but made no effort to remove the knife from my ear. 

"This is all Toby's fault," said Leigh, "Because of something he did to your sister, now I'm stuck in this body; in this life that isn't mine." 

"W-who are you?" I said. 

"Oh come on," said Leigh, "You've already figured it out. You tell me." 

"Toby," I said, "You're Toby." 

"That's right," said Leigh, "And I'm stuck in your sister's body because Toby found a way to copy his mind over into someone else. He thought by taking over my body he could get what he always wanted." 

"Y-you?" I said. 

Leigh stifled a mirthless laugh, "No," she said, "*You."*

Leigh sat herself forward more, leaning against me because, I could only imagine, the arm holding the knife was starting to get tired. 

"Toby has been obsessed with you for years. Even before you invited him to your birthday. He worships the ground you walk on." 

"It's not like that," said Toby, "I just wanted–just wanted a–*friend."* 

Leigh kissed her teeth and ushered for me to turn around. She moved the knife from my ear to my neck. I watched her do it thinking at any moment I might try and tear the knife from her grip; but the consequences of failing to take the knife from her was too much for me to risk; not only hurting myself, but her too. What if my sister was inside there somewhere? What if she could still be saved? 

"First he took over your sister," said Leigh, "And then when you wouldn't leave things be I took it upon myself to take over your Mum and Dad too; and I'll take over more until you both learn to do as you're told." 

"What do you want from me?" I said. 

Leigh pushed the knife into my throat enough to make me tense up all over my body. I could see the madness in her eyes. 

"All you need to do is behave," she said, "Let me figure out the rest. If you tell anyone about this, if you try to reveal what's going on to anyone; we'll just take them over too." 

Leigh turned to Toby. 

"And you," she said, "If you don't start listening to every word I say I promise you Mike will be the one who suffers the consequences. Do you understand?" 

Toby stared at Leigh with wide eyes. 

"*Toby,*" said Leigh, "I said *do you understand?"* 

Leigh dug the knife harder against my throat. I convulsed from the pain, making the cut even deeper. Warm blood leaked down my neck. 

"I understand," said Toby, nodding profusely. 

"Please-please-please, I understand," he said. 

"Good," said Leigh. 

She pulled the knife back from my neck. 

"You boys keep enjoying yourselves. I'm going to have a little word with Mum." 

And with that Leigh walked out of the room, leaving Toby and I alone. 

I grabbed a nearby sock from the floor and pressed it to the cut on my neck. 

"I'm sorry," said Toby, his face a wet shiny mess, his eyes puffy as if he were stung by a bee near each eye. 

"How did you do it?" I said. 

I didn't care to give him any sympathy. I just needed to know. 

Toby sniffled and wiped the tears from his eyes as he gathered his thoughts. He glanced to the empty doorway and then said in a whisper. He spoke incredibly slowly, choking out each word.

"H-have you ever heard of *Astral Projection?"* 

"It's like your spirit leaving your body?" I said. 

"It's consciousness leaving the body," said Toby, "I did it by accident. I tried to--I tried to take my own life. I just wanted to end it. But I didn't take enough pills. I just fell into a deep sleep and...the next thing I knew I was standing outside of my body. I thought maybe I had died but I could see my body was still breathing in bed.  I moved around my room, floating...it was cool..."

Toby looked away from me, his puffy eyes searching the carpet stained with droplets of my blood. 

"...it was late at night and my consciousness – I don't know if you could call it a spirit, or ghost, I don't know – I left my house – floated right through the wall, and then I…" 

He started to sob into his hands some more. 

"Just spit it out," I said. 

"I knew the way to your house," said Toby, "I went through the front door and I was just…looking around. I didn't intend to do anything to anyone. I didn't even know that I could. The whole thing didn't even feel real at the time. I went up to your room and you weren't there. I was going to go home, because I didn't think it would be a good idea to be away from my body for so long. And then…you know the rest." 

"Tell me," I said, "I want to hear you say it." 

"I went into your sister's room," said Toby, "I saw her sleeping and then I got closer, and closer, and then the next thing I know I'm awake in my bed. I felt horrible but I was okay. Besides, you know, being too stupid to know how to kill myself properly...everything was normal. It was as if it was all a dream, or something. I even made myself think that none of it had been real. But then, two days later, I got a call from your sister. She told me she wanted to meet up. I probably would have thought it was some prank but it seemed like too much of a coincidence for her to call me out of the blue right after I astral projected. So I met up with her." 

"And what?" I said, "You decided to start *dating?"* 

"No," said Toby, "I mean, that's what we told people. We thought it was kind of fun at first. But…" 

Toby leaned closer to me. "She's crazy. They're unstable." 

I drove a punch so hard into Toby's face it was a wonder I didn't break my wrist. Toby hit the ground, blood gushing from his nose. I threw myself on top of Toby and started to strangle him. I wasn't thinking clearly but I didn't care. I just needed all of it to stop. Maybe killing Toby was the way to make it stop. Toby thrashed in my grip but I held his throat as tight as I could. 

Mum and Leigh raced up the stairs, having heard the commotion, and charged into me to get me off of Toby. 

Toby breathed in a lungful of air as Leigh and Mum wrestled me to the ground. For several seconds I fought against them before I felt the now familiar sensation of a knife at my throat. 

"Stop!" Mum screamed into my face, "Stop it!" 

I stopped thrashing, going still. 

"Get him out of here," said Mum. 

Leigh took hold of Toby and got him to his feet. She said something into his ear that I couldn't make out. They left the room. 

"What did he tell you?" said Mum. 

"Everything," I said, trying to catch my breath, "I know you're not my Mum." 

"Good," said Mum, "I was getting sick of pretending anyway. If I take this knife from your throat are you going to stay calm?" 

I considered the question, then nodded. Mum drew the knife away from my neck. There was blood on her hand and more blood on my shirt. 

"Stay here," said Mum, "I'll get you something for that cut." 

"Wait," I said. 

Mum, standing, waited for me to speak. 

"Why not just take me over too?" I said. 

"Because," said Mum, "Then we wouldn't have anything to stop Toby from trying to kill himself. He doesn't care about his own life, but he does care about you. We don't know what will happen to us if he dies. Maybe you'll get your family back, or maybe we'll still be stuck in these bodies. Who knows. All I know is I don't want to die, even if I am just a copy." 

I didn't know what to say. Mum, or *Toby* in mum's body, wiped a tear from her eye.

"I'm sorry," she said, and walked out of my bedroom.

In the wake of Toby, Leigh, and Mum having left my room I at last felt a reprieve, at the very least, from the *confusion* of what was happening to my family.

Mum and Leigh talked with Toby downstairs for ten minutes before Leigh left with Toby, to where I don't know. It's been eight hours since they left the house.

I've hidden myself away in my room trying to think about what my next move should be. I have to do something. But what?
