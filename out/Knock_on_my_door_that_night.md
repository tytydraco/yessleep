It was a normal day  for me that  night.  Done with my daily chores as a wife. Had cleaned the house, did our laundry, dry and fold them. I also redecorate our room to which it will suit for our incoming baby.

Yes, I'm pregnant and is about to deliver for 2 more weeks. I keep my self busy every day and do all chores so I could sleep well at night.

It's been months since I began having trouble sleeping. I kept waking up at 3:00am, seeing a man standing in the dark in the corner of our room. I'm always sleeping alone at night as my husband's work is a lead guitarist and they have a gig every night. But we're living in his parents house. So I live with his mother and a sister. We have different rooms. His Dad is working abroad. But whenever 3:00am struck, I would wake up seeing this strange man in his black polo shirt and pants staring at me. I wanted to scream as loud as I could but I just couldn't. It felt so real that in my dreams it's really 3:00am and when I was finally able to turn on the lights on, the man will disappear and the time was right. And after that  happens , I couldn't go back to sleep anymore. 

It keeps happening everyday. The man was the same, in his black attire. I tried to tell my mother in law but she just said that maybe I was just imagining things. But I know that something wasn't right.

I decided to redesign our room that night, hoping that it will give a new ambiance. Maybe that thing would stop visiting me and also to give our incoming baby a light and fresh looking room .

After finishing the last thing of my renovation project, I decided to sleep in the living room. My thought was, at least If I'm having a night mare or what, my inlaw could hear me because the couch in the living room was placed just behind her room. So I slept there.
 And here struck 3:00am again...
This time, I  heard some knocking on our wooden door in front. It was the door in our living room. It was dark but the knocks keeps going. So I decided to stand and walk slowly. As I was about to open the door, I asked. Who's there?? Then I repeat my question before opening it . But no one answered.

I turned on the lights in the porch to see who it was outside knocking at this hour. I don't see anyone. So I decided to open our wooden door to check. And after doing that, I realized something. The knocks I heard was at the wooden door. I'm sure of the sound. And our wooden door was backed up by another door. A screen door. So if the knocking  comes from the wooden door, the knocking was coming from the inside. With that thought, I made the fastest run that I could to my mother in- law's room. I knocked hard until she opened it. She ask why and told her what happened. She just shrugged her shoulder and told me I must be really tired. And asked me to sleep with her that night.

Then I decided to stay with my parents instead after that,  til I gave birth..That still puzzled me up to now.
