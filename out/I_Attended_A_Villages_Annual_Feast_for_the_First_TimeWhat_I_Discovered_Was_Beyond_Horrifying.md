I had never planned on settling in a remote village, but life had a way of taking unexpected turns. After losing my job in New York and finding myself with no clear direction and no place to live in next month, I accepted an offer to manage a small inn in the picturesque village of **Thornwood**. It was a tempting offer I must say, three times I tried negotiating for a higher rate than offered AND three times it got approved with no hesitation. Odd, *it's like they really wanted me there*, like they really needed my expertise that's not entirely unique to be perfectly honest. The owner seemed eager for me to work there asap and even offered to pay for my flight. How can a **small inn** afford to pay me this much and even pay for my flight going there? "*They must have really good food and always out of rooms for the night*" I thought to myself.



Thornwood is a place nestled deep in the mountains, it was the kind of place that seemed to be trapped in time—beautiful, serene, and isolated. The villagers were warm and welcoming (People there are a bit chatty though), working the inn was fun as well, but I couldn’t help but notice one peculiar tradition they had: the Silent Feast. It was an annual event held in the village square, and it intrigued me from the moment I arrived. The feast was a grand affair, with tables overflowing with extravagant dishes that would put any five-star restaurant to shame. But there was one strange rule: no one was allowed to speak or leave until the final dish was served. I asked the villagers about this unusual practice, but they always offered vague answers or changed the subject.



Curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to attend the feast that year, see if it was as interesting as the villagers hype it to be. The event was held on the first full moon of autumn, and the entire village gathered for it. The air was crisp and filled with the aroma of roasted meats and freshly baked bread. Lanterns illuminated the square, casting an otherworldly glow over the scene. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off, but the sheer spectacle of the feast was mesmerizing.



As the guests took their seats, the atmosphere was oddly hushed. The villagers communicated with nods and gestures, never uttering a word. I tried to engage in conversation with a few of them, but they simply smiled and pointed to their lips, indicating that speaking was not permitted.



The meal began, and the dishes were as incredible as they were diverse. The food was rich and flavorful, and I found myself indulging in the feast more than I had anticipated. Despite the silence, there was a palpable sense of excitement among the diners. I assumed it was due to the anticipation of the final dish.



Hours passed, and the feast continued. As the night wore on, I noticed something unsettling: the villagers were not eating like usual. Their movements were slow, almost ritualistic. Their eyes flickered nervously toward the village clocktower, which seemed to be ticking louder with each passing minute.



I couldn't ignore a growing sense of dread. My curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to investigate why the feast was so deafeningly silent, I could hear all the chewing and food going through their throats. Disgusting. I slipped away from the table and ventured toward the back of the square, where I saw a few villagers sneaking glances around a large, ornate door hidden behind a curtain.



My heart raced as I approached the door and pushed it open slightly. What I saw inside made my blood run cold. The room beyond was filled with eerie, flickering candlelight and strange symbols painted on the walls. In the center of the room was an altar covered with an intricate cloth. A large, covered dish sat upon it, and as I peered closer, I saw that the villagers were converging on this altar, their expressions a mix of fear and reverence.



Just then, a high-pitched, agonized wail echoed through the room, making me jump. The villagers fell silent, their faces frozen in terror. I realized then that the final dish wasn’t just a meal; it was part of a macabre ritual. The wail came from beneath the altar, and I could see the dish trembling as if something was trying to escape from it.



Panicked, I stumbled back toward the feast, but as I turned around, I noticed something horrifying: the door to the village square was shut tight, and a crowd of villagers stood in front of it, blocking the exit. I tried to call out, but the rules of the feast held me in place. I could only watch in horror as the villagers' expressions turned to glee, as if the wail had confirmed their darkest fears.



Suddenly, a loud crash echoed through the square, and the ground began to tremble. The villagers remained seated, unmoving, their eyes fixed on the final dish. The wail grew louder, more desperate, until it became an unbearable shriek. And then, as if by some dark magic, the final dish was revealed.



Inside the dish was a horrifying sight—a grotesque, living creature writhing and convulsing, its eyes filled with a mixture of terror and pain. The creature looked human but not exactly. Like it USED to be human, the way it curled up into the fetal position while unnaturally shaking it's head in pain and wailing creeped me the f\*ck out. The villagers began chanting in unison, their voices rising in a crescendo of eerie harmony. The creature’s wails grew weaker until, finally, it fell silent.



I was paralyzed with fear, unable to move or speak. The villagers began to eat the final dish, their faces reflecting a twisted satisfaction, face messy with blood like eating a very saucy spaghetti. It was then that I realized the true purpose of the Silent Feast: it was a sacrificial ritual, designed to appease an ancient and malevolent entity that demanded a horrifying tribute.



As the feast came to an end, the villagers finally acknowledged me, their eyes gleaming with something sinister. I knew I had to escape, but the villagers were closing in, their intentions clear. I bolted toward the door, fighting through the crowd. My heart pounded as I broke free and ran into the night, the wails of the creature still echoing in my ears.



I escaped Thornwood that night, booked a flight without even going back to retrieve my stuff. The airport was a bit far from Thornwood (1-2 hours on car) so I had to walk and run and then walk again just to get the f\*ck out of there. I never looked back, I knew some villagers were still chasing me though, I could hear the footsteps in the same rhythm as mine. I can never forget what I witnessed. The village has since disappeared from maps and records, it's like they were afraid of me reporting them to the police or something. But every year, on the night of the Silent Feast, I can still hear the wails and see the flickering lights in my nightmares.



Last night, I saw someone standing outside my window, peering in. When I stared back, they continued walking on the sidewalk as if nothing had happened. It was especially unsettling since my apartment is on the ground floor. When I woke up this morning, I noticed that my back door had been forcefully opened, but nothing was stolen. My shiny new Macbook (the only expensive thing I own) was still on the dinner table, and other valuables were on display in my living room, ready to be taken. I briefly wondered if they wanted to kill me for no reason, like serial killers do. Luckily, I always double-lock my bedroom door, thanks to... Thornwood. Damn, just saying that name still gives me chills. After some reflection, I came to a conclusion that sent shivers down my spine, scarier than the thought of a potential serial killer sneaking into my home while I slept peacefully—**I was marked as a sacrifice, and they NEED me to fulfill their ritual.**



Note: Before I meet my inevitable end, I got obsessed with details of the weird ritual they call "Silent Feast" which **I realized is drawing near**. It's odd though why it took 2 years for them to come after me, did they run out of sacrifices for this year's feast? Do they stock their sacrifices like livestock? I feel like I have an invisible tag around my neck like how a cow has, waiting for it's own slaughter. Never in my life I got this obsessed with something. It’s as if I’m compelled to unravel every sinister detail, as though knowing more will somehow change my fate. I guess this is how people are who are **marked for death**. I'll write another post soon and will link it to this one. I just gotta piece the details together. See you when I see you
