If you haven't read the [first part](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/rcomzwcLyg) I recommend it.

I got some comments about my jars and what happened next so I decided why not explain myself.

It might not surprise anyone but I continued moving into my new place. I had to put my food away before it expired and that was definitely not happening under my watch.

Though I hadn't seen the ghost boy since yesterday which is probably how I had somehow made myself believe he wasn't real. It was a weird amalgamation my mind had conjured up. Probably had something to do with the trauma from being robbed, or something he definitely wasn't real.

 It couldn't be.

I mean what a soap tossing laughing sarcastic and kind of rude ghost kid. How would he even make sense in the scheme of life.

Maybe I needed a therapist or a shrink.

Someone to tell me what I was starting to believe might be true since last year.

I walked over to my fridge and right as I turned to open it, I seen giant spiders run out and jump onto my face and around my hands and my everywhere else.

Suddenly I'm swarmed with them.

I scream as I feel there little wriggling bodies in my ears and eyes and mouth. I swat wildly at my face but I wasn't getting any relief. After shamefully knocking over a bag near me, I feel them running all around the masses they felt like how I thought being in fear factor probably felt.

Disgusting. This was my worst nightmare realized.

I felt a tear come from my eye.

One went in my nose and I started slapping it with my hand appendage be damned I tried to blow it out, as if it was snot.

That was until I heard laughter from the corner, and the feeling of the little spiders and my clogged nose all went away.

I let out the biggest sigh of relief and fell to my knees from the shock of the experience.

"Wow, dude how many jars do you have, I mean seriously this is an insane amount of jars.

 Are you nuts? I think you might be nuts?"

It was the little menace of a ghost, to be honest a part of me was wishing that the whole ghostly intruder thing had been a dream. It seems like my reality is still stuck in crazy land.

I can only hope it wasn't permanent.

Though he was asking a question it felt more insulting than questioning. My rebuttal of course was very well centered.

 "Shut up." 

Of course he didn't do as asked of him.

 "How about you snort more of my spiders." 

I feel a chill go up my spine at the threat. Just then I seen a giant one staring at me on top of the roof. I shiver.

He continues looking at my jar, holding it somehow in ghostly hands.
"Will you, please, put that down." 

I say looking at the teen holiding my jar and looking it over like a foreign object. 

Great! He's going to break it. I felt my panic set in again. My fight or flight had been in affect for a few minutes so it probably wasn't to hard to get back into that mode.

"No, I mean seriously who even carries this much jars, every corner and shelf, even the fridge both the freezer and deep freezer." He looked around at the objects like I was the madman.

"I even saw jars in the bathroom." 

I looked back over to him annoyed, little did he know there's more where that came from. 

"Just drop it, ok?" I say feeling cornered. 

"Ok" he says looking at me, smiling wickedly and then he proceeds to drop my jar onto the hardwood ground. I hear the crash before my brain registers what made the sound. 

I look down at the now pile of glass on the ground in horror. "Oops" he says starting to laugh. 

"You must be a demon, not a ghost." I say, anger taking over me.

He stops his annoying laughter at the statement. 

"Oh, trust me I'm no demon you'd better be happy about that fact." 

I wrinkled an eyebrow. He smiles mischievously, what was so funny. 

"I'm more of a poltergeist, if you will." He says, sounding happy at the idea. 

"What's that?" Hopefully I didn't sound like an idiot.

Though judging from his smile I'd say I probably did. 

"It's what I am, a giant amount of amalgamated energy, that's of a prior living being, I can touch things, make noises, and break as much as I'd like." He says all cheery like it was fun to be dead. 

I let my chin drop forming a frown. "you can disturb the physical world? Yeah I already knew that much from when you threw that complimentary soap at my head when I first met you."

He laughed at the memory. I rolled my eyes. 

I didn't have time for this I had to continue moving all of my stuff into jars and then moving those jars into their rightful places, in the house. 

I walked over to my soaps, and bath bombs. 

Before I could of course continue I heard a ring at my door followed by some loud, knocks. 

Well I guess she was already here, I thought she'd take a bit more time. 

I walked over and opened the door to see the same built for business woman I had seen last night that had robbed me. She handed over the jars she had stolen. 

I took them carefully placing them back on my shelf behind us. Then I turned back to her and disapprovingly clasped my arms together. 

"Well?" I said. 

She frowned "I'm sorry for robbing you last time." She said, I nodded. She turned behind her and waved at her probation officer. He smiled back and gave me a thumbs up before driving off. 

"Come in." 

She walked in seeming annoyed, just like I knew I was sure to be. 

"Amber" I said looking down at the note she had given me. 

"You are my community service, I have to help you, clean and move in, for a 6 week period." She said annoyed. 

I smiled at her, "nice to officially meet you Amber." She didn't look very happy to meet me. Which is fine by me.

I had obviously gotten her taken in last night and then police had come to me asking if I wanted to press charges this morning.

I wasn't heartless, I knew she probably was stealing for a reason.
She probably didn't have food, the economy is hard right now. What can I say.

So no I didn't press charges instead I made a deal. She helps me move in and that would be her duty being served. 

Also fine by me, my house work got done sooner than later and I was happy for it.

"I'm Kai" I say, as she shakes my hand. 

"Sounds like a girl's name." 

"Oh" I frown at the insult. Well that was rude and it hurt my feelings. 

"Ok" I watch as she walks in taking off her bag and tossing it on my floor nodding at the teen as an acknowledgement. 

"HA! KAI!" said the annoying teen laughing at my name too. 

I sigh, great now I had two insulting people in my home. 

"You wouldn't mind if I asked a few of my friends to stop by to help move this party along would you?" 

Said Amber, "Yes, I would mind." I'm exasperated. How can someone be so unruly. Why would I ever allow for her friends to come over to my place, first of all two people in here felt like a crowd already.

I walked back over to my soaps and continued placing them into jars separated by color. I must've gotten lost in time doing so because, though I ignored the constant bickering and laughter from the other two behind me. 

The doorbell rang soon enough, followed by heavy knocking. 

I looked back over to Amber who was snickering at something the teen had said. "Who's that?" I say frantic. 

"A few friends to make this a real party." 

I shook my head franticly again, "I thought I told you not to invite anyone." I say shocked at this woman's inability to hear. 

"Oh, I heard you, I just didn't care." 

WHAT!

She walked over to 'MY' door and opened it. "Hey! Billy, Lena, and Casey." 

The three walked in two girls and one boy. I was even more exasperated. "What am I? A babysitter?" I mumble. Though I was pretty sure this woman and her friends were around the same age as me, I could care less. 

I didn't want them here, the whole reason I had moved into this place was because I had wanted to be alone. Now, not only did I live with a scary ghost teen, I lived with a daily visiting built assassin woman with one to many friends. 

What had my life came to. 
How'd I let it get this far.

A few days ago I didn't even believe ghosts existed. 

Wait.. 

I just realized something. 

Amber didn't know the kid was a ghost, she probably still thought he was my son. 

I smirk all villainous like. 

"What's wrong with him?" Said a woman with long black hair. 

"I have no idea." Said Amber. Then I realized everyone was staring at me like I was crazy. Then I also realized I was smiling like I was crazy. I slowly dropped my villainous smirk, like it was a loaded weapon, and I had to be cautious of such things.

"Stay away from the crazy, stay away from the crazy." I say gently to myself.

"You ok there?" Said the guy seeming confused by something.

He was still staring "Yes, I'm sorry, guys." 

They all nodded at me, even the little tyke of a teen in the back.

"Uhm, let's get into the heavy lifting, how about one of you guys sort my soaps to match each other in those jars." I pointed to my discontinued work.

"Any takers?" I ask, and the girl with the long black hair raises her hand cautiously.

"YOU!" I say probably too enthusiastic. 

Hopefully I can actually be moved in here by next week with the help of this group. Let's turn a wrong into a right.

"Ok, well I also need someone to sort and squirt all of my tubes of lotion into those jars over there."

I say pointing to a wider set of jars in the corner. Now the group all looked kind of confused. Staring at each other than back at me.

 The teen starts to laugh in the background.

"I guess I could do that?" Said Amber.

I shook my head.

"Ok, then how about the dirts?" 
I pointed to the back of the house. I heard one of them mutter a quiet "huh" I smile back at them, but they just continued to look painfully confused.

"What does that even mean, man?" Said the guy. "Billy, play nice." I heard one of the girls whisper back at him.

So this Billy guy didn't understand the Jar system, huh. "I want to load that dirt for plants up, into Jars." 

"HUH?" I heard someone else say sounding distressed. "Jars" said someone else. "Why are you putting dirt into jars?" Said Billy. 

"So I can tag the name to it properly and seal it off from any possible infiltration." I say like it was obvious. I mean it should be it's obvious to me.

"Oh" said the longer haired girl.

"I'll do that," Billy stated. I nodded, then pointed at some more jars next to my bedroom.

"Anyone feel like going through every needle, thread, pin, pencil, eraser, sharpener, charcoal, marker, and watercolor set for me?" The last girl raised her hand, she looked confused but like she was going to do it anyways.

I nodded again smiling, "Don't forget to tag the names of each thing in the jars, write as neat as possible. Over there is my tag paper and markers." I pointed as they all nodded. 

"Right" I said as they all stared at me.

"Chop, chop get to work."

They all nodded then simultaneously, went to their area's getting started on their tasks. I walked over to the teen. 

"Wow,  surprised they didn't just walk out and leave immediately after you told them to literally go through needles in a art stack." 

He laughed as I rolled my eyes.

Ghost kids are a scary bit, but once Amber got to talking to him, she'd look like the crazy one not me.

It had been a few hours by this point when something random happened.

 I heard someone scream, I got up and ran to the back of the house into my bedroom only to see the girl with long black hair staring at the teen as he moved my pencils around drawing a pentagram on my wall. 

This scene would've made no sense if I didn't know he was a ghost.

She had her mouth covered in horror her face looked paler than it should have. I walked over, "are you kidding me?" I say to the teen clearly messing with the woman. 

She looked on the verge of passing out. 

The others soon arrived in my bedroom. "What happened?" Questioned Amber "What did you do to her?" Questioned Billy jumping straight to a conclusion.

"WOAH, woah, now!" I say frantic that the situation was about to probably spiral out of control if I didn't stop it. 

"I didn't do anything to her, she screamed and I was just the first to arrive." I say feeling defensive.

We looked back to her and then she shakily brought her hand up and pointed at the pentagram, and the teen that was sat beside it. 

I saw Amber raise an eyebrow "The kid did that?" She said without missing a beat. 

Now I finally got to feel the slight enjoyment of not being the only 'crazy' one in the building. Everyone looked at her spooked. 

"The boy?" She said like it was obvious. "He's sitting right there." She pointed at him like she thought they were messing with her. 

I started laughing, and stopped quickly as she gave me a warning with her eyes. 

"What are you laughing at?" 

"They can't see him." I stated, I saw a moment of confusion pass over her face before she nodded. 

"Nevermind, guys continue what you are doing and ignore the floating tools." She said like this wasn't weird.

They all looked at each other clearly still freaked out. She walked out waving for the kid to follow her. He got up smirked at me and ran out to follow her. 

The group looked at me. "Y'know I never got everyones names." I started trying to calm down the energy in the room. 

"Uum.." said the woman with long black hair "I'm Lena" she said then the other red head next to her said "I'm Casey." The guy nodded "Billy" I nodded back at them. 

"Cool." Everyone seemed a little uncomfortable so I tried to move things along again. 

"Y'all can take a break if you'd like?" 

They all started walking to the front of the house and sat around on the floor I heard the two girls whispering franticly to each other. Billy just kept staring around at the walls, like something was going to jump out at him and he'd have to punch it back down once it tried to. 

I walked over "Does anyone want shakes?" I say trying to make everyone feel less on edge. 

Then I heard a shout from the back "YOU'RE LYING!" I'm guessing Amber and the ghost teen were talking about his deadness. 

The group looked behind me, which I guess was because of the abrupt shouting. Then I saw Billy and Lena start to get scared and pale again. 

"WHAT THE HELL IS THAT!?" Questioned Billy now frantic.

I shook my head, it sure was easy to get these people worked up. "It was probably just Amber talking on the phone with someone." 
I say ... Trying to dust off that wrinkle from my pants. 

"NOT AMES! WHATS THAT!" I spin around and see a giant black and purple spiraling hole opening in my roof. 
 What the FU-
I scream a quick pathetic "EHH!" I hear a slight laugh from someone behind me. How could they find anything funny at a time like this. 

"KID! GET IN HERE RIGHT NOW!" 
I say with the sound of an all authoritive dad.

The kid screamed back, "WHY!" Like the true teen he was.

I shook my head and waved my hands around frantically gesturing to the giant black hole looking thing opening in my living room roof. 

"WHY'S A GIANT BLACK HOLE OPENING IN MY ROOF!" 
This weird pitched noise starts to form from it, almost like a balloon popping in slow motion I grab my ears. 

The sound continued not deterred by my hands over my ears, I can hear growls and screams this weird beeping noise what sounds like my own voice screaming "WHYS A GIANT BLACK HOLE OPENING IN MY ROOF!" But it sounded like it was being replayed through an old recorder.

A random bout of manic laughter rang through the hole next , followed by another old conversation that sounds like it was being replayed through a old recorder "Who can even tell the difference?" I didn't recognize the voice.

Then I heard someone singing "Jimmy Johns... I got a locket in my POCKET! JIMMY JOHNS!" The voice was deep and gutteral almost gut wrenching, it made my head hurt and ears pop.

Then I heard this sound, like a fully grown whale falling through my floor and BOOM! out came something weird, from the black hole.

I stared confused as the group behind me gasped in unison. 

"What the hell.." I whispered out of breath, I didn't even realize I hadn't been breathing that whole time.

The portal, black hole looking thing zipped up shut making a loud 'ZZZZPp' noise as it did so.

I paid it no mind, the thing before me confused me a lot more than that.

A man, I think, with two heads and two hands, and little horns on each head. I could see through him and from the heaving breaths behind me I'm guessing they could see the corporal being too.

He had blonde hair on both heads and a pair of dark rimmed glasses covering each eye. He wore very baggy clothe, he looked like an outside street dealer stuck in the 90s.

At least he probably fit in more than me around here.

"Woah, Jett was right, you are a loser." Said the deep voiced creature in front of me. I could now see the creature has a suit case with it.

"OH, NO, NO." I said exasperated, 
out came the teen as he jumped up and hugged the creature and the thing took him in with welcoming arms.

The group behind me got up from the ground slowly, I didn't hear anymore heaving so something was better about the situation at least.

Then came Amber walking out from the back slowly staring up at the now very weird unfolding situation.

"This is my bud, Johnny John" said the teen all light hearted like he didn't just give someone a panic attack and put a black hole in my living room and then close it, probably taking a years worth of my hearing along with it.

"Great" I say annoyed and kind of tired.
