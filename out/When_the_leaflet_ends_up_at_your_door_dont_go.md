I found the leaflet in my postbox one day. The white text on a stark black background jumped out to me more than the generic graphics of the other spam.

*Darkness*

*An exploration of the soul*

Underneath the text was the address to a local gallery. At first the strange nature of the writing jumped out to me. Little detail, very brief. Not even a call-to-action like every other piece of advertisement. I found myself a little drawn to the mystery but I eventually rationalized that it was no different to any other spam that finds it’s way into the letterbox and set it aside.

The next day the office erupted in gossip over the strange leaflet. Each coworker had received their own mysterious advertisement in the mail and its unique qualities left an impression. Margaret, of course, started it by mentioning her own. Strangely enough, every single person attested to a different tag-line on their printout. Ellen stated that hers read, “*Discover your true potential”.* Margaret’s said, “*Embrace the other side of humanity”.* Despite living in the same apartment complex as Margaret, Tyler said his message differed as well: “*The truth you cannot avoid”.*

Richard told me of his leaflet in a call that night.

“It’s so fucking weird,” he said. “Everyone’s got one of these?”

“Everyone I know,” I said.

“What does yours say?”

“An exploration of the soul.”

“Why does it have to be so cryptic?”

“Probably to get you to go.”

“Good marketing then.”

“Because you’re going to go?”

“Janey and I are taking the kids to the gallery on the weekend. Gives us something to do. And you know what I’m like, I need to find out what’s going on. I can’t find anything on the internet.”

“Nothing?”

“Nope. Not even in the local groups.”

“Huh. Maybe I’ll have to try and find out myself.”

Later that night, after Richard had logged off, I searched the internet myself. First with simple Google searches, then looking at particular sites and forums, before image searching a picture of the leaflet itself. Nothing came up. I kept trying increasingly specific keywords about the leaflet or the various different taglines I had noted down for hours, and still found naught.

Around 15 pages into a search, I found a deleted forum post with a promising headline.

*If you get this leaflet, don’t go*

Luckily someone saved a snapshot on an archive. The text of the post had no images unfortunately, but the body text described the leaflet perfectly. Except the address listed was for a University a couple hundred miles away and the poster’s tagline read, “*See something you will never forget”.*

The post had only two replies. The first from an anonymous user:

“Why? What happens if you go?”

The second from the original poster:

“*Trust me. Don’t.”*

Sunday rolled around. I decided to get my affairs in order for once. Having run down to the post office to drop off a birthday card for my brother overseas and sorting out the weekly grocery shop, I relegated the rest of the day to playing games and relaxing. Until Richard messaged me.

“Can you come over?” he wrote.

“Why? What happened.”

“I just need you to come over.”

“Now?”

“Yes.”

He kept insisting it was urgent no matter what I replied. Seeing as I wasn’t up to much, I indulged him.

As I walked up the path, Richard had opened up the door. He stared at me for a moment with a blank stare.

“Are you okay?” I asked.

He jumped as if shocked, “Come in.”

Richard walked into the house. I followed and shut the door behind me. For the first time in a long while, his house sounded quiet enough that I could hear the clocks ticking. Judging by the lack of car on the drive, Janey had taken the kids out. He led me into the living room. We stood above the sofa’s awkwardly for a few moments.

“Should we sit?” I asked.

Richard jumped again, “Sorry, yes, by all means. Do you want something to drink?”

“Sure,” I said, taking a seat. “Just water, please.”

Richard disappeared into the kitchen.

The house felt warm. It always had that effect on me. With the pictures of the family on their annual holiday hanging from the walls to the toys scattered on the floor. A stark contrast to my relatively empty studio apartment. Richard had done well for himself. Everyone knew he would.

He reappeared and handed me a filled cup through shaking hands. Yet he refused to sit down.

“Everything okay?” I asked.

“Yeah.”

He compulsively scratched the back of his neck. Sweat dripped from his brow.

“Where are Janey and the kids?”

“Oh they’re just out. They’ll be back soon.”

“Okay.”

I took a sip from my cup. Richard couldn’t seem to stop his leg from bouncing. A crack in the door to the dining room caught my attention. I could see a few cardboard boxes scattered around the place.

“So, what’s going on?” I asked.

“Nothing.”

“Why did you call me over then?”

He stood up and walked over to the window. He closed the curtains a bit. Opened them again. I put down my mug and stood back up.

“Richard,” I said, “what’s going on.”

“I...she’s back,” he said.

I could see his car pull into their drive through the window. Janey got out. I didn’t see the kids follow her.

“Where’s the kids?” I asked.

“The leaflet,” Richard said. “Don’t go to it. Please.”

“Where are the kids, Richard?”

He looked back to me. His eyes looked sunken. His voice raspy.

“It took them,” he said. “It took them all.”

I stormed out of there. Whatever was in that gallery, I had to see. Janey didn’t say a thing to me as I passed her by the door. She didn’t seem to notice me at all. My car sped off into the direction of the city center.

Traffic was heavy but I reached the gallery an hour later. A massive queue lined up outside. It seemed the leaflet, and the lack of answers, had drawn everyone into the place. When finally admitted, I rushed through the other exhibits until I found what I needed at the very end.

*Darkness*, the sign read. No subtitle. It stood outside two big open double doors.

Peeking in I could see people gathering around something in the middle of the room. Most stood there and looked up into the center. It took a while for me to notice the giant all-black painting in the middle suspended atop a natural formation of rock. The canvas contained within an ordinary wooden frame. My eyes had been glued to the painting. I could only focus on the lack of detail within. It leered back at me. No matter where I stood in the room, it leered. The sounds too. Oh god the sounds! The indistinct noises of people talking. All so loud and so clear yet so together that it lacked clarity. The void. It called to me. The closer I got the more I saw it. No detail. No paint marks. Not even the slightest hint of a gradient. No light at all. A void in its totality. The voices got louder while the darkness closer and closer. It called to me and I obeyed. The darkness grew until it consumed everything in sight.

The light pulled me back. I lost my footing on the rock beneath me. The room swirled until it eventually came back into focus. Up on top of the pile of rocks stood groups of people. One man reached his hand out. Another woman held her baby up. Every one of them yearned for the void. It had escaped its wooden barrier and reached out back to them. It consumed them. The voices got louder. I could hear them. Make out their words.

“Help!”

“Let us out!”

“Please god no!”

The void expanded outward one last time before falling back into itself. I heard a crunch and then it disappeared. The voices remained for a while, playing in my head, but I knew they were gone. All of them, gone. And I did nothing.

Only half of my coworkers returned to the office the next week. Every one of them had changed. No one wanted to stand by the cooler to chat anymore. Nobody spent their lunchtime in the break room talking about their weekend. Not even Margaret wanted to address it. We all did our jobs and went home.

Richard and Janey split a couple days afterwards. She moved back in with her parents. He disappeared to somewhere a couple hundred miles away. I never talked to either of them again.

I hope by describing the experience I can stop you. Even if only a couple. Just please promise me something: when the leaflet ends up at your door, don’t go. Please don’t go.
