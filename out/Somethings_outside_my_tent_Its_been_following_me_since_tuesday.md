I’m in my tent. It’s 3:04 AM. I haven’t moved in an hour.

There’s *something* crouched right behind me, on the other side of the fabric. I can hear it breathing. Slow. Wet. Too slow to be human.

And a few minutes ago, it whispered my name.

Not shouted. Not mumbled. Whispered. *Exactly* how I say it when I introduce myself. Same tone. Same timing. Like it’s been *rehearsing*.

I have one bar of reception. I tried calling emergency—call dropped. I’m typing this as fast as I can. If it uploads, please, *please*, don’t let them say I got lost. I didn’t. I was followed.

I came out here five days ago for a solo hike. Digital detox. Air. Trees. Dumb ideas.

It was fine at first. The forest was dead quiet, like it had been sedated. I thought that was peaceful. Now I think that was a warning.

The first weird thing happened on the second day. I saw a shadow near the tree line. It was tall. *Too* tall. And narrow, like someone had stretched a person out vertically and shaved off the face.

I only saw it for a second, but it *stopped* when I saw it. That’s what messed me up most. It froze, like we were both caught. Then it tilted sideways, like it was thinking, and vanished behind the trees.

That night, something paced around my tent. I figured it was an animal until I heard it laugh.

It wasn’t a full laugh. Just the *start* of one. A quiet little “heh” like it was trying the sound out. Like it had heard people do it and was practicing.

I didn’t sleep.

Day three I tried to hike back. The trail was gone. I checked my GPS—full spin. Compass: useless. Even the sun felt like it was in the wrong place. I kept walking straight and ended up back at the same broken tree with the red moss growing on it. I know it was the same one. It had my boot print in the mud. *My* boot print.

I camped again because I didn’t have a choice. That night, something unzipped my tent.

Not a rip. Not a tear. ***Unzipped***\*\*.\*\*

I woke up to the sound—*ziiiip*—and saw the flap slowly pulling open. Just a hand came in. If you can call it that. It had fingers, sure, but they were long and splintered, like someone had carved them out of driftwood and glued knuckles on as an afterthought.

It reached in, touched the floor, then touched *me*—barely. Just a graze on my boot.

Then it said one word:  
*“Left.”*

What does that mean? Left what? Or… turn left?

I didn’t move. I didn’t scream. I think I stopped existing for a full sixty seconds.

It pulled its hand back. **Zipped the tent closed.** And walked away. I could hear it moving through the leaves for *hours*. Just circling. Testing.

The next day—I think it was Thursday—I climbed a ridge trying to get reception. Got one bar. Called emergency. Told them I was being stalked in the woods. They said they’d send someone. The call dropped right as I heard her ask my location. Never got it back.

I tried again later. Straight to “call failed.”

I slept in shifts after that. Twenty minutes at a time, blade in my hand, flashlight clutched to my chest. The forest got quieter each night. Even the bugs shut up. No wind. No movement. Just this awful awareness that something was *listening*.

Then last night… I heard it again.

Only this time it was talking. In my voice.

It was outside the tent whispering things I’d said that day. Like a little showreel.  
“Where the hell am I?”  
“Just breathe, don’t freak out.”  
And, worst of all: “You’re okay.”

It said that one over and over. Like it was comforting me.

I bit through my own lip trying not to scream.

Tonight is worse. It’s not pretending to be far away anymore. It’s pressed up right behind me. I can hear it exhale when I exhale. Like it’s syncing up. Getting ready.

I swear I felt a fingertip drag across the back of the tent five minutes ago. Just once. Just enough to say: *Still here.*

And then…  
*“Danny.”*

That’s me.  
It said it like a friend would. Like someone who’s known me a long time.

I don’t know how long I’ve got. My phone’s hot. Battery draining fast. I can’t move. I think it wants me to move. Wants to see if I’ll unzip the tent. Maybe that’s the game. Maybe it only kills you if you look at it. Or maybe I’m just telling myself that because I’m out of ideas.

There’s something else.

Just now, it whispered something new. Not mimicking me. Not repeating.

It said:  
*“Come out, Danny. You’re ready.”*

Ready for what?

I don’t want to know.  
I want out of here.  
I want to see the sun again.  
I want to hear cars, and sirens, and people yelling dumb stuff into phones. I want someone to tell me this was a hallucination, and I’ll believe them, even if they’re lying.

I don’t think I’ll make it to morning. But if I do—if by some miracle I walk out of here—I’m never going near a tree again. I’ll pave my goddamn backyard.

If you’re reading this, don’t come looking for me. Burn this forest. Salt the dirt. Forget the trail. Forget the photos. If something whispers your name from outside a tent in the middle of the night—

**Don’t unzip anything.**
