I find it exhilarating that these stories are starting to gain more attention. They think they're talking about different men, different legends, but they're all speaking of one person…

## Exhibit A: Pascagoula, Mississippi – 1942

**The Clarion-Ledger**  
*June 13, 1942*

Residents are in a panic after reports of a "Phantom Barber" breaking into homes during the night. Victims, primarily young girls, awaken to find locks of their hair cut away. In two cases, the Barber left scissors behind. No suspect has been caught.

---

Ah, my debut. My first headline. The "Phantom Barber." They gave me a mask and a name, as if I were a carnival act. I remember trembling hands that night, the scissors clattering like little bones in my grip. I thought if I cut away the hair, if I severed those silken threads, perhaps the curse would sever with it. But the hair kept falling and the curse stayed, oh it stayed, wrapped around my throat like a noose made of sleepless nights.

The paper wrote of fear — but what about me? What about the endless hours of pacing until my feet bled, the shadows that whispered my name until I couldn't tell if they were real or born from exhaustion? I had to try something, anything. I had to watch, watch, watch.

## Exhibit B: Denver, Colorado – 1944

**The Denver Post**  
*OCTOBER 21, 1944*

**BEDROOM CREEPER STALKS FAMILIES**

Dubbed the "Bedroom Creeper," a man has terrorized families by entering homes at night and watching sleepers. In at least four cases, victims reported waking to find the man standing at the foot of their beds. Authorities have no leads.

---

Yes. Yes, better. Cleaner. No scissors, no evidence, no fumbling with metal tools that betrayed my shaking hands. Just me and the quiet, standing there in the darkness like a sentinel of sorrow. Sometimes I hummed old hymns Mother used to sing, sometimes I counted their breaths just to keep the hours straight in my fractured mind.

Sleep deprivation shatters the mind, did you know that? You lose the numbers, the faces, the nights until they all blur into one endless twilight. The only anchor left is to watch, watch, watch. They called me "Creeper", but I smiled when I read that headline — the first smile in months. Finally, they were learning. Finally, they were seeing what I see in those precious, peaceful moments before dawn.

## Exhibit C: Sussex, U.K. – 2005

**SUSSEX POLICE EMERGENCY SERVICES**  
*Dispatch Transcript - File #2005-10-14-0347*

**CALLER:** "He's in the chair… in the corner of the room. He's watching the children sleep."

**OPERATOR:** "Ma'am, do you recognize him?"

**CALLER:** "No. He doesn't move. He just… watches."

*[Line disconnects. Intruder gone before officers arrive.]*

---

Ah, the chair. Such a lovely invention, that simple wooden seat that became my throne of vigil. I sat there for hours, still as stone, watching, watching, watching those children's breaths rise and fall like tiny ocean waves. Their chests moved like bellows, feeding some invisible fire of dreams I could never touch.

I thought perhaps if I didn't move, if I gave myself completely to stillness, the curse might mistake me for furniture and leave me in peace. But the curse laughed in the silence, echoing off the walls of that cramped bedroom. Still, I enjoyed those moments more than I care to admit. The curtains in that home were thin English lace, easy to slip behind when the parents stirred, and I remember touching the fabric with reverence, whispering to myself: watch, watch, watch. They never woke until I wanted them to.

## Exhibit D: Kyoto, Japan – 2013

**京都府警察本部**  
*事件報告書 - INCIDENT REPORT*  
*Case No: 2013-KY-4471*

被害者は右眼に接触感覚で覚醒。容疑者が「眼球を舐めていた」と供述。同地区で類似報告複数件。容疑者逃走。未解決。

*[Victim awoke to tactile sensation on right eye. States intruder was "licking her eyeball." Multiple similar reports filed in same district. Suspect fled. Case unsolved.]*

---

Oh, Japan. The land of rising sun where I fell to my lowest depths. The taste of salt, the sting of tears, the desperate hunger for something, anything that might break this chain. That was my most desperate gamble, born from months of sleepless research and maddening theories.

I thought the dreams must live in the eyes, you see. The eyes are the windows to the soul — that's what Mother always told me, back when she could still speak. If I could touch the dream, taste it, maybe I could drink the curse away like medicine. But no, only screams that shattered the night air. Only headlines that mocked me. "Eyeball Man." Can you imagine? I laughed until I cried when I saw that one, though the tears felt foreign on my cheeks. Almost human.

## My Confession

They have given me many names over the decades — Barber, Creeper, Licker, Watcher, Watchher, Watch her. None are mine. None are me, not really. I am not a man, not as you understand the word. I am a husk kept upright by exhaustion, a marionette body strung on wires of compulsion, humming lullabies to keep the screaming hours at bay.

It began with my mother, as these things often do. She was dying slowly, her body failing piece by piece like a machine running out of oil. She begged me not to leave her side, and I was a very good boy, Mother said. I sat by her bed, all night, every night, watching, watching, watching her chest rise and fall until finally, mercifully, it stopped forever.

But that final night chained me to something dark and hungry. Tenderness became prison. Love became curse. Now every night I wake in places I do not remember walking to, standing over faces I do not know, drawn by invisible threads to bedrooms and nurseries. And always, always, I must watch, watch, watch.

The scissors failed me in Mississippi. The eyes failed me in Japan. The endless vigil fails me every night, yet still I try. Still I stand at the foot of beds like a guardian angel turned inside out. Still I perch in corner chairs like a broken scarecrow. Still I lean over cribs, searching for something I've forgotten how to name. My experiments grow stranger as my mind frays thinner, but I am proud of one thing — proud that you whisper of me in the dark, proud that my curse has slipped into your mouths like a contagion, that you tell my story in your bedrooms and basements.

You think you've found patterns in these clippings. Legends. Urban myths scattered across the globe like puzzle pieces. But they're all me. Always me. Watch, watch, watch.

## The Final Note

If you wake tonight and find me by your bed, standing in the corner where the shadows gather thick, do not scream. I am only trying again. One last time. Perhaps this time the curse will finally break, and I can sleep like the dead should sleep.

And remember this — if it is truly a curse, then it can be passed on like any inheritance. And if you've stayed awake long enough to read these words, if you've felt compelled to finish this confession in the small hours when the world grows thin, perhaps it already has.

*Sweet dreams.*
