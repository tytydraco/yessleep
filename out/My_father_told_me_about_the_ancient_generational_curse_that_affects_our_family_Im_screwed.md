Let me start by saying that I never believed in curses, or the paranormal in general. To me, my families’ tall tales were simply bullshit, and I’d make a point to roll my eyes every time they’d bring them up. They never really elaborated on what exactly these curses are, but would often speak about the fact that they exist. 

Even being six foot, five inches tall, my dad has always been a strange, secluded, quiet person. He kept to himself and would often leave for days, even weeks, at a time for “work-related business”. 

I called bullshit. He was a park ranger at a nearby national park, what would he need to be going “out of town” for in a position like that?

No, I didn’t think that my dad was cheating on my mom. That seemed highly unlikely, because every time he would leave on his “trips”, they’d always go down and have some kind of intense conversation alone in the basement. 

Many times I had tried to sneak in to hear even a whisper of what they spoke about, but I could never get close enough. 

By the time I was 19 and about to turn 20, I started noticing small differences. It was the little things, like the strange and worried looks that my mother would give me with when she thought I was not looking. 

Then things got REAL weird when my father started constantly asking me to spend more time with him. The first few times he asked, I was so stunned that I stammered and didn’t know exactly what to say. 

I told myself that he was trying to make up for lost time, and since I was his only child, he decided to up the intensity with each week that got closer to my 20th birthday. 

Was it a coincidence? Was he trying to give me “the talk” and just didn’t know how to do it? 

That thought gave me gross chills. The man who’d been entirely too secretive about his life, suddenly wanted to just open up and shoot the shit with me?

I don’t think so. 

I could see in his eyes that he had a yearning to tell me something. Maybe he wanted to explain what he was REALLY doing all those times he would go “out of town”. 

Out of intense curiosity and a growing demand for answers, I quickly accepted when he asked me to come to his region of the park for a a few days with him. Some “guy time”, as he called it. 

The second day at the park would be my 20th birthday, and I did not have many friends (like father, like son) so I decided to jump on the opportunity. Maybe being out in the great outdoors is exactly what I needed. Hell, maybe it’d even be good for me. 

As I packed my things and my camping equipment in my room, I turned and almost jumped out of my skin when I saw my mother literally standing inches away from my face. 

“Mom!” I exclaimed, a heavy breath rushing out of my throat. “You scared the SHIT out of me.”

She tilted her head to the side. “I’m sorry, Ryan, I didn’t mean to. I just wanted to see if you needed any help packing.”

Oh yeah, I needed to get out of here for a while. Things were getting next-level weird.

“Uh,” I looked around and then back at her, “I think I’ve got it covered, mom. Thanks anyway.”

She backed up a bit, but still stared at me with that weird, almost questioning look on her face. I was beginning to get creeped out.

“Is there….anything else?” I asked, trying to be polite despite the deep uncomfortable feeling I had in the pit of my stomach. 

Her posture returned to normal and she straightened her back, and smiled sweetly at me; not once taking her eyes off of mine.

“I just wanted you to know that I love you honey. That’s all. I love you, no matter what, and I want you to always remember that.”

Now we were not a constant “I love you” or “be safe” kind of family. We weren’t touchy-feely either, so when she embraced me in a big hug and rubbed my back, I felt entirely too awkward. 

I patted her back gently, and attempted to offer a little bit of a hug back. “I love you too, mom.”

We sat like that for what seemed like an eternity, until she finally released me and held me by my shoulders, looking deep into my eyes like the most proud parent on Earth. 

She patted my shoulders once and then turned around and left the room. 

At this point, the thoughts that were going through my head were these: either my parents were getting divorced and my parents didn’t know how to tell me directly, or my dad was going to sacrifice me to some wood-God when we got to the park. 

Oh I’m DEFINITELY getting sacrificed, I thought. 

Did I really think that my own father was going to take me into the forest, extract my beating heart from my chest, and lie it before some old God from ages ago?

No. 

But the way my parents were acting mere days away from my twentieth birthday had me feeling all sorts of weird. 



The day that we were to leave for the trip was the day before my birthday. I woke up feeling great, and admittedly, a little excited for our trip. I’ve always loved camping and even aspired to be a park ranger like my dad one day. 

I got up and showered, put on my best hiking clothes, and walked out into the kitchen where my dad was already waiting. His eyes got wide and a big smile spread across his face.

“You about ready Ryan? You look just like a professional hiker today.” 

I cracked a small smile. “Yeah dad, just need to get my things in the truck. I’m actually pretty excited.” 

He smiled back at me, nodding, and then looked back at his newspaper. 

As we loaded into my dad’s ranger truck, my mom accompanied us outside to see us off. She hugged us both goodbye and told us she loved us. I watched her in the rear view mirror as we drove off, and I swear I saw her smiling and a tear roll down her cheek. 

Damn, I really am about to get sacrificed.

A ways down the road, I turned my dad’s music down and looked at him. He took quick glances between me and the road. 

“Everything okay, Ryan?” He asked with a questionable tone in his voice. 

“Dad,” I began, “what the hell is going on. Why are we going on this trip? Why is mom acting so weird? Why’re you so suddenly interested in hanging out with me?” The words all jumbled together, and my dad turned his eyes back to the road. He sighed deeply.

“Son, I know you feel like your mom and I are keeping some big secret from you. But it’s not quite that simple.” He shook his head, as if trying to find the words to say. 

I went to speak again, but he held up his hand as if he intended on finishing his sentence.

“We have always told you about curses and how deeply we believe in them. Especially those that are generational- inherited by the children of those cursed.”

I sighed and put my head against the headrest. Oh here we go, I thought. I said nothing and let him continue. 

“We’ve talked about it so much for a reason, Ryan. Our family is a bit…different.”

Oh, you got that right, dad.

He continued. “Years and years ago, an ancestor of ours made a pact with a woman with unbelievable powers, son. These days, you’d call her a witch.” 

I was already getting a headache, and I rubbed my temples at the word “witch”. 

“The pact was that the woman would provide crops, prosperity, and fertility to the man’s family, and in return, he owed her his life. After all the good deeds were done by the witch, our ancestor decided that he wanted to live and thrive off of what the woman had done for him. That was not the deal though, and when the woman came to collect her dues, he refused to give himself up to her.”

“She was an angry, spiteful witch. More powerful than any who are around today. She told the man that he would pay, in blood, for generations to come.”

He stopped and looked at me, to see if I was still listening. I motioned for him to continue. 

“She told the man that every first born child in the generations to come, would be cursed. With what, the man didn’t know. He spat at the witch and returned home to his wife.”

“They did prosper, and eventually his wife bore a son. The years went by, and before the man knew it, his son was about to turn twenty years old. He was so proud of his son.”

I have to admit, my interest had peaked. I listened intently as he finished the story. 

“The night before the man’s son officially turned twenty years old, a tragedy occurred. The townspeople began to worry about the family after not having seen them in town for a few days. Some elders of the town decided to visit the home of the family, as they were concerned about their well-being. 

They came to the home and to their horror, also came across a gory, disgusting, horrifying scene. The family had all been brutally slaughtered, except for the son, who was nowhere to be found. It was said that the bodies were mutilated so badly that they were unrecognizable.”

My head was spinning at this point. What. The. Hell. Was. Going. On. 

“After that night, people would go missing near the family’s now abandoned home. Brutal murder scenes and fear plagued the small town, but the son was never seen again.”

I couldn’t catch the words before they came out of my mouth. 

“So, what happened dad?”

He got quiet for a moment. 

“It was the son of the man who had made the pact with the witch who had cursed the family. He brutally murdered and unknown number of people- but not in his right state of mind.”

“At night, he would…change. He took the partial look of a wolf mixed with a man, and had no control over his actions. Instinct took over each and every time, and his instinct was simply to kill. A hunter who had set up near the abandoned home is the only one to have ever seen the boy and lived to tell the tale.

The hunter claimed he saw a giant, muscular wolf that stood like a man. He spoke of eyes that glowed a bright orange, and teeth as sharp as knives. To this day, the hunter’s legend still stands, although the townspeople have turned away from believing such unbelievable tales.”

Is my dad seriously talking about werewolves right now? 

I shook my head in disbelief. He stopped me before I had the chance to express my negative thoughts on this wild tale.

“I am one as well. That’s where I go when I leave for days at the time. But son, over the years, our family has learned how to control the beast inside us. Think of it as a deer hunting trip, without the guns. We no longer go insane and murder people…after the first shift.”

I turned and looked at him with a surprised look. 

“After the first shift? What the hell, dad?” At this point, I was almost sure that I was having some kind of fever dream. 

He had a solemn look on his face. “The first transformation occurs on the night you turn twenty. During that first…time…you aren’t in control of yourself. Instinct takes over. And son…” he got serious and quieted his voice. 

“Tonight, you will have your first transformation.”

————————————————-————


Before I realized it, we had reached the park where my father worked. We drove up to the ranger station and my dad prepared to get out of the truck. He gave me a sad look. 

“I’m gonna go sign us in and speak to my rangers. Think of any questions you have and I can answer them for you. I’ll be right back.”

He slammed the door and headed into the station. Meanwhile, my head was absolutely spinning. 

Was my father on some kind of hallucinogen? Some other kind of drug? I thought of trying to convince him to voluntarily check himself into a rehabilitation center, or even the crazy house. 

Knowing my father, however, I quickly abandoned that thought. He was stubborn as a mule, and I suppose that’s where I got my hard-headedness from. 

As I sat in the truck in deep thought, my dad sauntered out of the the front door on his way back to the truck. He gave me a strained smile as he opened the door and got into the drivers seat. 

“Well, looks like we’ve got the place to ourselves the next few nights. Incredible luck on our part, I’d say.” He again gave me a halfhearted smile as he started the truck. 

I couldn’t find my words. Instead, I sat in silence as we began to drive down a well-worn path next to the entrance to the park. 

My dad noticed my silence after a few minutes of driving. 

“Son, look. I know it’s a lot to handle and a lot of information to take in. But I need you to trust me, just this one time.” 

I shook myself out of my thoughts and looked at him. 

“So you’re telling me,” I began, “that tonight I am going to grow fur and claws and become a bloodthirsty beast because of some witch’s spell cast a long time ago? Dad. You realize how insane that sounds. Please tell me you do.” 

I watched my dad’s demeanor drop completely. He took a deep breath. 

“I wouldn’t believe it either, son. I certainly wouldn’t. But I only ask that you stay with me this one night. If nothing happens, you can go home and we will never bring this up again.”

He paused, a concerned look growing on his face. 

“But, if I AM right, there is a lot you need to know and understand. There is much more to this than you would ever imagine.”

I couldn’t help but stifle a laugh. 

“Dad. This is insane and you know it. I’m sorry but I don’t believe any of this nonsense, and if you’re on drugs, please tell me, because you’re beginning to scare me.”

All of a sudden, my dad slammed on the brakes. 

He flung his door open and came around to the passenger’s side of the truck. He then grabbed the handle and flung my door open as well, with his face less than a foot from mine.

“You want to say I’m crazy?” His voice began to deepen. 

“You think I’m on drugs?!” There was an intense snarl behind his words.

“Here. Is. Your. Truth.”

I can’t recount the fear that overtook my body as I watched my own father sprout dark brown fur and as his face elongate. His blue eyes turned a bright orange as he continued to snarl at me. I pushed myself as far into the car as I could, as my father continued to get closer to my face. His snarl deepened.

And then he snapped his jaws at me. 

“Here is your truth,” he growled, “and tonight, you’ll see for yourself that you are exactly like me.”
