 

Back when I was a stupid teenager my friends and I would go into the woods behind this old guy’s house and do some stupid shit. Sometimes we would play games or tell scary stories until we got too tired or until the old guy chased us off with his shotgun. 

One night me and my friends Nate, James, Henry, and Steve were out in the woods behind the old guy’s house again and decided we would play hide and seek so James counted and Nate and I decided to stick together and we went a little further into the woods this time (the old guy was rich for making some sort of big company) when we came across this old shed that was still in pretty good condition. (you could tell because of the condition the outside of it was in) Naturally Nate and I thought that we could hide in there so we opened the door only to see a man not the old man and you can’t even really call it a man I mean yeah it stood on 2 legs and had 2 arms but it’s legs were absurdly long and the arms were so long they almost dragged as it walked toward us. Nate and I took a step back when we saw this thing’s face. It had at least a dozen eyes and razor sharp teeth stained with blood.  

The thing looked at us and let out an ear piercing roar. That’s when we ran. We didn’t run anywhere in particular, just somewhere that the creature wasn’t. Eventually we saw the old man’s house and we turned around to see if we could avoid it only to see nothing until we looked up and saw the creature up in the trees staring at us. Then it jumped down and began to run toward us faster than any human could ever be. That's when we heard a loud noise behind us and a lot of something hit the creature. The old man had come out and started shooting the creature. But the creature didn’t seem to be in pain as it seemed more annoyed than anything. The old man shouted at us to run so we did and as we were running toward our friends we heard another shot get fired and then the old man’s scream. When we got to our friends they asked where we were because they were looking for us and found nothing. So Nate and I had said we would explain later and that we needed to get out. 

As we were running James tripped and started screaming Nate and I already knew what happened but Henry and Steve turned around and stopped. A few seconds later I heard Steve scream and Henry start shouting. When Nate and I arrived to the car we instantly got in and waited to see if anyone else made it back and when we see Henry we were extremely excited so I opened the door and Nate got the car started but then I heard something behind Henry and saw the creature jump and grab him sinking its teeth into his stomach and biting a chunk of his torso off. Seeing his intestines spill everywhere creeped the hell out of me. I quickly closed the car door and told Nate to drive as fast as he could. 

A few days passed and my friends’ parents kept coming by to see if I saw them or knew where they were. More people eventually went missing and they were all last seen either in the woods or near them. The rest of the town believes that bears are getting more aggressive or that there is some kind of serial killer on the loose but I know the truth. Anyway a few years later the police finally decided to check the woods a little more than they did the first time. They got a warrant to search all of the old man’s property and when they went deep into the middle of the woods they found almost all of the victims. Apparently they had all been strung up in the trees with their intestines being used to hang them. This finally convinced people that didn’t already believe it that there was a serial killer with the occasional person saying that it was bigfoot or a wendigo etc. Now at least my friends' parents know where their kids are but it brings them more questions than it did answers. 

I feel like this was all somehow caused because Nate and I decided to open the shed because there hadn’t been any murders before this. I mean yeah we had the occasional missing person but they all got solved within a week or two. Now the police are trying to figure out who did it and now I’m in and out of the police station because they somehow think Nate and I killed our friends and are now killing other people. All that Nate and I say is that one moment our friends were there and the next they were gone. But the police know we aren’t telling the truth. Everyday I consider going there and telling them but when Nate did that he ended up in the local psychiatric facility. 

Someone was killed inside of their own home. Some people believe that the “serial killer” realized that no one was going to the woods anymore so now they are breaking into people’s houses. But it's so obvious I have no idea how nobody has caught on at this point. There was a huge hole in the wall that no man could make and it wasn’t an explosive because nobody heard it and there wasn’t any black char around the hole. The police found the man dangling from the opening in the attic hung up by, you guessed it, his intestines. 

Missing persons numbers are skyrocketing and our town has now been deemed the most dangerous in the state. James’ parents have hired a private investigator to try to finally catch whoever killed their son. I was interviewed by the private investigator and he said that he knows I didn’t do it. I wonder if he really thinks that or if he just wants me to give some information up. 

The private investigator stopped by and told me that he has evidence that I committed the murders and when I asked him to show me he showed a clearly faked video of me killing the victims he said that in a couple days he would have it perfected and he would get credit for solving the case. I did the only thing I could think of which was grab the gun I purchased and then I heard a gunshot and saw him on the ground. I used the very little chemistry I knew from school to destroy his body.

I don’t know why he would fake that footage maybe for publicity? I guess, but now I am the very thing he accused me of being, a murderer. 

Apparently no one knew where he was and just assumed that the killer was silencing those looking into the case which has now scared the police working on the case into working sloppily. They are afraid that the so-called killer is going to go after them. I never realized that the police in this town were such cowards.

As I’m typing this the creature is creeping around my house. It has somehow learned how to open doors and fit through them. I’m currently hiding in my attic and I have called the police telling them that the killer is in my home but knowing them they could take a half hour to show up. I can hear it moving right below me and I know that it will find me because my attic doesn’t have a door in the floor, just a ladder and even though it is pulled up I know that it can crawl through. I have my pistol on my desk and a rifle next to me. The only thing illuminating the room is a lamp. The orange glow of the candle inside is making me feel even more alone than I am. I am grabbing the rifle and aiming it at the hole. This is most likely a goodbye as I don’t think I can kill it.

I did it. The creature is dead. I shot it straight in the head with my rifle and it fell, it’s bleeding on the ground right now. 

Another person just went missing.
