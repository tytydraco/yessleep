There was a strand of flesh hanging from my bedroom door.

It was lit by the moonlight, streaming in through my window. Pale and ghastly with a slight sheen to it. Dangling from the brass keyhole. It wasn’t uniform, but lumpy in spots; thicker at the bottom, where it met the floor.

And it was *growing*.

I lay there in bed, terrified. My brain screaming to move, but all I could do was watch. Watch the flesh accrete on the floor. Slowly pooling out, forming a shape.

The shape of two knobby, twisted feet.

\*\*\*

Some of my friends joked that such an old farmhouse might come with some unwanted guests, back when I bought it. I scoffed. “I don’t believe in ghosts. All that supernatural stuff is for idiots.”

Now I realize, no one believes in ghosts, until they see one.

I replayed the images in my head, of that fleshy strand coming down from the keyhole. *A nightmare. It had to be a nightmare, right?* It didn’t even sound like a ghost. It was just… weird. Like all dreams are. Like a Salvador Dali painting on steroids. *And I couldn’t move. It was like textbook sleep paralysis.*

As a precaution, I duct-taped shut every single keyhole in the house. Then, after I’d retired to my bedroom for the night, I taped every single crack and cranny in that room. So that it was airtight. The gap under the door. Even the crack between the floorboards.

*Just in case.*

*Of course it wasn’t real. But just in case. For peace of mind.*

But I forgot the vent.

\*\*\*

I woke up with a start.

At first, I thought nothing was wrong. My room was dark and quiet. The keyhole was taped. I was safe.

Then I saw the flesh coming out of the floor.

It had been cut into thick ribbons, like a hock of ham on a deli slicer. Growing upwards from the vent, undulating in the draft. The pieces coalesced mid-air, and as they did, a naked, dirty bellybutton appeared.

Underneath it, a tangle of gray pubic hair.

*No. No. This can’t be happening.*

*This can’t be real.*

I tried to move—but I was paralyzed.

I watched in horror as the ribbons coalesced further. Into a naked, pale woman standing over my bed.

I couldn’t turn my head. But out of the corner of my eye, I could see her face. Gaunt and long. Tangled gray hair. Yellowed, crooked teeth.

Her eyes empty, endless voids.

And then I heard something that turned my blood to ice—the sheets rustling.

Without moving my head, I glanced down—to see her hand sliding over my bedsheets. Pointed fingernails, filthy, coming right for me. Emaciated fingers almost bluish in the darkness.

I opened my mouth to scream, but I couldn’t. It was like those nightmares I’d had, even as a kid. Where I open my mouth to scream for help, but only a suffocated squeak comes out.

The hand slid closer.

And then her skin contacted mine.

Something like a *zap,* a tingle of electricity, coursed through my skin. It radiated up my arm, stinging and cold. I think the woman was smiling wider, now, but I couldn’t turn my head enough to see her clearly. 

And then everything went back.

\*\*\*

In the morning I was tired. So incredibly tired. *That must have been a dream,* I kept telling myself. But I knew it wasn’t. I could barely walk downstairs to eat breakfast. It was like I was controlling a body double my weight.

I left the house that morning.

Later in the evening, from the comfort of a friend’s house, I did some research. I didn’t tell Kate what happened; it was too unbelievable. I’d sound crazy. I told her there was a problem with the house (true), and I might be at risk for carbon monoxide poisoning (false.)

But in all my Google searches, something popped up: *zmory.* Polish for ‘nightmare.’ The name of a creature from old Polish folklore, that steals one’s life force. A ghost, sort of, but one that can’t pass through walls…

But changes shape, instead.

Like turning into a thin strand, to fit through a keyhole.

*I’m never going back there.*

I’d sell the house, even though it’d be at a loss. I’d move into an apartment, whatever, any place else. Hell, I’d even take on a roommate. And I *hated* roommates. Even the spouse kind—hence being single at 42.

Kate reassured me I could stay as long as I needed to. That night, I snuggled into bed and pulled the comforter up to my neck, comforted by the warm glow of the nightlight in the hall. It shone through the crack under the door, dimly lighting the entire room.

I closed my eyes and began to sleep—

*Smack.*

A wet, horrible sound.

When my eyes flew open, I could no longer see the night light’s glow.

As my eyes adjusted to the darkness, I saw the pancake of flattened flesh, pulling itself into the room.

*No. No—this is a nightmare.*

*I left!*

The woman at my side. Black pits staring down at me. A jolt of electricity through my arm.

When I woke up the next day, I could barely get out of bed. I scrambled for my phone and frantically pulled up more pages on the *zmory.* That’s when I realized I missed a bit of text in one of the articles I’d read—

*When a zmory finds its host, it latches on.*

*It follows.*

*And it doesn’t leave until you [die.](http://www.reddit.com/r/blairdaniels)*
