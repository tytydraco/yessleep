 Everything is more sinister once you turn off the lights, especially if you just watched a scary movie.   That jacket you hung on the door seems a little too lifelike…. that noise in the living room had to be your cats running around… you definitely locked the doors.. right?

 All these thoughts and more were going through my mind as I laid in bed.  Tony, my best friend, was passed out on the floor next to me on a pallet we had made up after the movie.   “It’s all in your head, you can’t let these stupid movies get to you!”  I thought to myself.  Something about the demon movies always seem to stick with me longer.

I tried to push the movie from my mind as I got up to pee, carefully stepping around Tony’s body strewn across the makeshift bed.  I opened the door slowly to lessen the creaking and slipped into the hallway silently, the stretch of hallway that I had walked so many times before looked almost foreign in the dark.  Steeling my nerves I began the race to the bathroom door, feeling as if the boogeyman was on my heels the whole way.  As I entered the bathroom I quickly closed the door and turned the lock.   Safe.  

 Easing my back off the door and realizing how silly that would’ve looked if anyone had seen me, I turned the switch to a warm glow and walked to the toilet as I lifted the seat up the shower curtain rustled slightly.  “Must’ve brushed against it” I thought shrugging, even so I yanked the curtain to the side.   

 What would you do if you found somebody in the shower when you pulled the curtain back, I don’t mean you open and catch a friend with their pants down.  I mean when it’s late at night and you have to use the bathroom and you pull the curtain to the side almost subconsciously to make sure you’re alone, what would you do if at that moment you found what you were looking for?

 I stared.

The creature must’ve been 8 foot tall when it was standing straight, but when I opened the curtain it was stooped down to eye level with me.  An unnatural hump protruded from its back as it bent over to stare at me.  Its face long and narrow, looked me over hungrily.  I sprinted backwards and slammed into the door forgetting I had locked it, I fumbled with the lock and made my way into the hallway.  This time the race was real and the boogeyman was actually breathing down my neck, I ran into my room, jumping over Tony and into my bed pulling the covers over my head as I did.

After what felt like an eternity I chanced a peek out from the covers, my eyes took a second to adjust and as I scanned the room everything seemed to be a monster ready to pounce on me.  I quickly put the blanket back over my head, it seems like I’m safe as long as I’m hidden.


I don’t know what to do now I can hear noises all around me.  Please help me I feel something pulling at my blanket..
