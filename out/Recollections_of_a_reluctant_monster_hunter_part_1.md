Never made one of these before, so I'm not quite sure how to start things off.

I guess an introduction is a good enough place to start as any.

My name's Barry, and I've been hunting monsters for as long as I can remember. While I take a small amount of pride in being good at what I do, I didn't choose this life, and would happily trade it for another if given the chance.

See, when I was younger, young enough that I hadn't even figured out the whole 'walking' thing yet, my parents signed my future away to some otherworldly kingpin of the criminal underworld. This *creature* calls himself the 'Boogeyman.'

I was brought to this Boogeyman, where a contract was made, and signed in blood. I would receive abilities of sorts, to aid me in my monster hunting endeavors. And, In exchange, I was bound to a lifetime of service, eliminating those who would break the rules, so to speak.

To summarize, any time a paranormal entity goes around willy-nilly killing people for whatever reason, or really just doing anything that threatens the secrecy of the paranormal underworld, I get sent to, well, *deal* with them.

In this aspect though, I'm not unique. There are many of us monster hunters out there, all agreeing to similar contracts. Though I doubt most of them had a family as... fanatical for the cause as mine are, or, were...

So what happens if I decide I don't want to partake in this contractual obligation anymore? What happens if I just decide *not* to do my job?

Well, I get given a nice, shiny collar and turned into a lap-dog for the rest of eternity, bound by powers beyond my understanding, to execute any command given to me. Fun, I know.

I had the displeasure of witnessing this process first hand to someone I used to work with.

We were on a job- A young man, suffering form Lycanthropy had lost control of his condition while he was having a drink at one of the local bars and, well, when we arrived... He was the only one left. There he sat, in the midst of all the carnage, sobbing profusely into his knees.

I felt sorry for him, I truly did. But rules are rules. On the bright side, this would be over quickly.

As I raised my weapon and prepared to take my shot, my partner, Jonah spoke.

"Wait..."

I hesitated. And before I could say anything, that stupid bastard just started walking up to him, weapon holstered, and with no intent to finish the job.

He sat down next to the sobbing mess and put an arm around his shoulder.

Without looking up from his knees, the man sputtered through his tears:

"I'm... So sorry... I-I didn't-"

Jonah cut him off

"It's alright... It's alright."

*"Jonah..."* I said somewhat impatiently as I lowered my weapon.

We had worked together long enough that I didn't need to say anything else. He knew what awaited us if we failed this mission. He knew that I just wanted to get this over with and drown any regrets I had in booze.

But Jonah just sat there, comforting the man. He sat there for the next few minutes before pulling out his wallet and forcing a fist full of cash into the mans hand.

"Get out of here. Go and get yourself a bus ticket, and *get out of here,* as far away as you can."

The man looked up at us for the first time since we arrived. Then he looked down at the fist full of crumpled bills he now held.

"Why... Are you helping me?..."

Jonah smiled weakly and shrugged.

"No reason."

I just shook my head as Jonah helped him to his feet.

"Get out of here." He repeated and gave the man a firm pat on the back.

He stumbled forward, then paused briefly to glance at both of us, before making a hasty exit and disappearing into the night.

"We are so royally fucked." I said, more to myself than anyone else.

"Maybe he won't find out?" Jonah chuckled quietly.

"He already knows, man..."

"Yeah, I know..." He sighed. "Should we go see him?"

"Better we find him than he finds us." I reply.

So there we stood, staring up at the towering mass of... Whatever he's made out of, known as *the Boogeyman.*

His mouth was filled with numerous sharp, narrow teeth, stretched into an unnatural grin, and his eyes... *God* his eyes... When he looked at you, it was enough to trigger a legitimate fight-or-flight response. Generally the latter.

"A... Pleasure... to see you two boys again..." The Boogeyman rasped.

"I trust... Your most recent... expedition was a... success?"

He had a way of emphasizing syllables that just made my skin crawl, and I hated the way he would dramatically pause throughout his sentences.

I looked over at Jonah who didn't exactly seem happy to be here, before replying.

"Yes...?"

His grin somehow stretched even wider and his eyes appeared to bulge out of his head at us as he leaned across his desk.

"Is that so?" he bellowed, before throwing his head back and descending into a roaring fit of laughter.

***"Is that so!"*** he shouted again, even louder.

Both Jonah and I exchanged worried glances.

"Then please... Do explain *how* I came across the fine gentleman you were supposed to *eliminate*... About to skip town?..." He said, waving a small slip of paper which appeared to be partially stained red, back and forth.

The laughter had completely stopped now, leaving an unnerving silence in the air, and his grin had turned to a scowl.

"Making me do your work for you..." He leaned back in his chair.

"That's a... Punishable offense, you know?"

At this point, Jonah's concern had visibly shifted to horror as the realisation dawned on him.

"No..." He whimpered

"Oh, yes!" The Boogeyman's grin returned once more

"Not only has your laughable attempt at compassion been for absolutely nothing... But as a... Result of your actions, you've brought upon this... Poor man... Needless suffering."

"What do you-"

Jonah was cut off as the Boogeyman snapped his fingers, causing a speaker somewhere in the room to crackle to life. It was silent for a moment, save for a bit of static, until the screaming started.

Both Jonah and I were stuck frozen in place, horrified at the ungodly sounds coming through the speaker. The guttural screams of agony, the whirring and grinding, and the sound of something falling to the ground with a wet slap.

"People pay handsomely... For live subjects..."

I was left completely speechless. I didn't know what to say, I didn't know what to do but just, stand there. Jonah, however, did not suffer from the same speechlessness as I did.

"Fuck... You." Jonah hissed, reaching for his weapon.

All I could do was silently mouth "Don't do it."

Alas, he either did not see me, or did not care. He drew his weapon and unloaded. I knew it wouldn't do anything. He probably knew it too, but he did it anyway. Each bullet landed on target. Punching holes in various parts of our employer, Holes which immediately began to fill back up, spitting bullet fragments back out in the process, and leaving holes only in the suit he wore.

The Boogeyman adjusted his tie before standing up, making his already towering figure seem that much larger.

"And this was my favourite suit... Such a shame."

Without prompt, Jonah also began screaming.

I looked back over to him, to see flames burst from his back, incinerating a large part of his clothing in the process. Strange, glowing markings and symbols began etching themself into his skin.

As Jonah crumpled to his hands and knees, his howls of pain only growing in intensity, the Boogeyman slowly began to walk around his desk, trailing his fingers along it's surface as he went.

"My dear boy, Jonah... You have broken the terms of our contract, and thus... You forfeit your free will... *To me*..."

The markings now covered most of Jonah's back, and the fire that moments ago, nearly reached the ceiling, had almost completely died out.

The Boogeyman approached Jonah.

"Another, for my personal... Collection."

As he spoke those words, the ground beneath Jonah began to deform and warp, and he began to sink.

I quietly took one step back, then another.

"And... Where, might I inquire... Do you think *you're* going?"

Safe to say I was shitting my pants by now. I couldn't speak, and now it felt like my feet were glued to the ground, unwilling to move no matter how hard I commanded them to.

"Fear not, my boy... For it is not your time, yet... It was not you who spared this... Pest..."

He snapped his fingers again, cutting the screams being broadcast through the speaker short, and once again plunging the room into a daunting silence. Then he turned his gaze to me.

"Though... If I were you... I would be taking a very valuable lesson away from this..."

His stare was nauseating, it made me feel sick to my core.

"But I'm not you... And I would very much like to add you to my collection as well... Don't slip up, now."

He wagged his finger at me as he said this, before going back to his chair and sitting down.

I turned back to where Jonah had been just moments ago, to see absolutely nothing. Not a single thing to ever suggest that he had been there. Not so much as a burnt scrap of clothing.

"I'll be watching you, Barry... You were always among the more... Capable, of your kind."

I took that as my queue to leave. I left that building feeling pretty shell-shocked about everything that had just transpired.

When I got back to my dinky little apartment, I locked the door behind me, and cracked open an expensive bottle of whisky that I had intended to share with Jonah on a special occasion. More for me I guess. I polished it off in just a few minutes, before passing out on my couch.

That was 8 years ago, to the day. I haven't seen him since. He was the closest thing to a friend that I've ever had, and probably will ever have.

I learnt two lessons that day. Don't get emotionally invested in people, and just follow the fucking rules. It's easier that way.

I've plenty more tales to tell, but it's getting late, so I'll save that for another night.

Tonight, I drink to you, Jonah. Wherever you might be.
