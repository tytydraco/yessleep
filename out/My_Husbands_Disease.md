My husband has always been deeply religious. He had an unwavering stillness in him—almost as if he had all the answers to life. We were opposites because I was an atheist. I didn't need answers. But that was until he got sick. That was when I started believing.

It all started when he got back from his retreat. Back in the summer, he stayed at a monastery somewhere in northern Belarus. Its location was hidden from the rest of the world, but it gave him space to pray, meditate, and study.

He told me how he would wake up at 4 a.m. every day to read the Dead Sea Scrolls and some ancient Hebrew scriptures. He even studied the Tibetan Book of the Dead—which I found surprising considering it was a Catholic retreat. He said it didn't matter, that all religions were pointing to a single truth. Looking back, I did not realize how terrifying some of these ideas were.

One morning, I woke up to my husband talking to himself in the bathroom. When I opened the door, I found him standing in front of the mirror, whispering to himself. I was going to ask who he was talking to, but upon closer inspection, I noticed his face was covered in tiny red dots—about ten to twenty markings scattered across his face, some of which were breaking the skin. I thought he had chickenpox. Regardless, his health became a priority, which made me forget about the whispering. After that, he grew quieter.

I wasn’t taking his sickness seriously. One night, I went out drinking with my friends, and when I got back home, I heard a noise coming from under the bed. As I looked down to check it out, I found him again. He was crying. The infection on his skin had gotten much, much worse. They were no longer marks but holes. It looked like something was eating his skin. Parts of his skull and teeth were beginning to show. Almost crying in disbelief, I started pleading with him, asking him questions:

“What is happening to you? Are you hurt? Are you going to die? How can we stop this?”

He just looked at me with that same stillness he always had. He wiped his tears and told me to follow him into the bathroom. He said he had all the answers I was looking for. My heart was broken for him, so I just followed him into the bathroom, hanging on to that false hope that if I took care of him, then he would get better.

Inside our bathroom, above the sink hung a large mirror. He told me to stand in front of it, so I did. I could see his reflection standing behind mine. Then all of a sudden I saw it. Like a flash of lightning. Suddenly, I knew.

Apparently, whatever this disease was that my husband had been carrying is creation itself. I thought that reality was neutral and that good and bad were mere human creations. I was wrong. Reality leans toward evil, and horror is the true nature of our existence. Life is slowly destroying souls so that we can be part of its hellscape. I didn’t think I needed answers in my life. Looking back, I just realize I never thought to ask.
