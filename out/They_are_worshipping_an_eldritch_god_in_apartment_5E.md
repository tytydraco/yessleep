Something is happening in Apartment 5E.

About a month ago, I got a noise complaint from Apartment 4E. I didn’t take it too seriously. 4E was a known over-exaggerator. They had lodged their first grievance (of several) a week after moving in. Who was getting on their nerves? A paraplegic 80-year-old woman who, they claimed, was stomping around at all hours.

So when I got their email informing me that 5E was making noise and flashing lights in their apartment windows at 2am in the morning, I took my time responding.

I checked the lease for 5E. It was a roommate situation, three kids splitting rent and probably attending the community college just down the way. To be fair, a noise violation from them seemed a lot more plausible than the old lady who spent all day in bed either sleeping or reading her smutty gas station novels (Ms. Johnson was a known lech).

After some thought (and maybe one or two more complaints from 4E) I told them I would look into it. The next day, I parked my car outside the building for an impromptu stakeout.

It wasn’t a hassle to sleep in my car most of the night. I was used to it. My divorce papers had been finalized a week before. They were buried at the bottom of my desk drawer, waiting for my signature. I was desperate for any excuse to get out of the house. If I wasn’t staking out 5E, I would be sitting around in my boxers watching Netflix while a humming microwave circled my $4.99 dinner and reminded me of how shit my life was.

An easy choice.

I say stakeout, but I wasn’t trying to be sneaky. Everyone who lives in my building knows what car I drive, god knows I visit often enough. But sitting in the parking lot, I couldn’t shake the strange feeling that I *should* be hiding. At first, I thought it was the scenery. The place I managed was not built in some ritzy high rise neighborhood. It was out in the sticks, with only trees for neighbors. The night was black as ink. No stars or moon out there that evening. The dark was like a literal wall circling my car and my building the only source of light for miles. The car’s exterior blocked out all the night noise from animals and bugs in the forest, leaving only the dull ringing you get in your ears after you shut off the motor and are left in complete silence.

It was like being blind and deaf. Anything could have been out there, and I wouldn’t know until whatever it was pressed its face against the driver’s side window six inches away.

The thought of that was enough to prime up the rest of my imagination. I started to feel like things were watching me. Out of the corner of my eye, I’d see strange shapes in the darkness just outside the car. But every time I would jerk my head around to see what was peeking in on me, all there would be was shadow. Jumping at every movement in the corner of my eye, I was giving myself whiplash.

I don’t know how it happened with me being so wired, but I nodded off.

A few hours later, I sat bolt upright in my seat. I wasn’t sure why for a moment, then I heard it again.

The sound.

You ever heard those deep sea noises that scientists can’t explain? The ones that you need to listen to at 20x speed just to get a clear picture? The sound that woke me was kin to those. Not a brother or sister to it, but that loner cousin at the family reunion who’s been to prison twice.

It started out as a moaning.

It wasn’t the hanky panky kind of moaning. It was keening that happens only at an open grave. The sound soldiers hear escaping their own lips when they look down and see their guts splattered like a fucking Jackson Pollock all over themselves. It’s the heart hijacking the vocal chords and telling them what the brain cannot understand even with a million electrical impulses at the ready.

They’re gonna die. Right there, right then. Alone.

The moan continued so long, I wondered if *I* was dying. Then it shifted to a groan. 

It was deep and guttural. The source seemed to be the earth itself. It reminded me of the noise a woman makes as they strain their entire being to expel the blood and vernix soaked bundle of flesh that’s been feeding off them for the better part of a year. A suffering only calmed by the reception of the resulting creature flailing, screaming, and leaking meconium in a demonstration of its primality.

I had heard its like only once before: when my wife gave birth to our stillborn child. Her pain had not stopped them, but continued on for the next ten years.

The groan built until I felt my bones tremble within my flesh. Then, without me noticing, it tapered off until it became the silence at the end of existence. 

In that quiet, there was a coldness in my heart that froze over into my lungs.

Then the moans would start again, growing from its own termination.

For fifteen minutes, I listened, my entire body seized up with a never-ending tension.

Where was it coming from? It was so loud, so close, I believed whatever was making the noise was directly against the car. I was convinced that if I turned my head, I would see the source of the sound, pressing their face (whatever it might look like) right up against the glass, rubbing blood and snot all over the window as they expressed a misery too vast to comprehend. I closed my eyes, and I could imagine that same creature inside the car with me, their torn lips brushing up against my ears as they groaned their way into silence.

The panic in my chest became too much, and I turned to look. Every movement of my neck was a struggle against my own primal instinct for ignorance. I could be safe if I didn’t know what was making the noise. But I had to know, because I had to see it. I had to believe it was mortal, something I could understand better than just unfettered agony.

I kept on until I faced the passenger window.

There was nothing. Nothing but night for filling the forest.

Then my eyes caught something. I turned to the building and saw the glow.

It was coming from the windows of 5E. The sound started up again, and from behind the curtains, I saw the birth of an illumination. It was the color of a flashlight shown through viscera spread thin, giving the curtains the horrible illusion of shifting skin. The light glowed with the intensity of a fire, then grew and grew until I had to squint my eyes against it. It reached the brightness of the sun, and I raised my hands as if the brilliance itself were some physical attack on my person.

Then the noise died, and the light faded.

When it stopped completely, the silence was worse than the sound. In that stillness, the moan and groan lived on in my mind and grew beyond what I had heard, feeding on the darker corners of my consciousness. It expanded to fill the space entire.

I stared at apartment 5E. The curtains shifted, like someone was peeking through them.

My hand jerked into my pocket, and fumbled with a mess of keys. I got the right one, started the car and got the hell out of there.

It took me about a week to build enough courage to write the email. Going in person to tell 5E to keep it down was not an option, but a letter was a satisfactory middle ground. I had calmed down enough to second guess what I had seen that night in my car. Strange how that works. I told myself it was some college kids shenanigans, weird music and light ambience for a sex party.

I was lying to myself. But how could I have lived otherwise? That light and that sound…they would accompany me to bed at night and force themselves upon me. I was alone, my ex-wife off in the Bahamas somewhere celebrating her impending separation from me. Lies were my freedom, my Bahamas. It was the only peace I could afford.

I cc’d all of the tenants of 5E, and let them know that a noise complaint had been filed. I told them they needed to stop whatever shit they were pulling after midnight because there were people in that building who needed to sleep. I told them that if I got any more complaints, we would have to “re-discuss the terms of their lease” which is a ball-less way to say “you’ll be evicted.”

When I pressed send, I could feel my hand shake. 

For the rest of that day, I compulsively checked my email for their response. That night, around 9pm, I got it.

Only one of the tenants had responded, but they signed all their names together at the bottom. They stated very formally they were sorry about the noise, and promised to be quieter. They also informed me they had certain “educational obligations” to fulfill at those hours of the night, so they couldn’t promise that the noise would stop entirely. But they did promise to keep it to a minimum.

They signed off their email with a small phrase: *mungam etadaul*.

I passed along the message to 4E, and hoped that would be the end of it.

About a week later, I got another complaint from (surprise) 4E.

It wasn’t a noise complaint this time (thank jesus) but it was something that I needed to look into. 4E accused 5E of having secret pets. They said that in the night, they could hear snuffling, scratching, and low growling on the other side of their shared wall. They thought it was a dog. A really big dog.

I was nervous to go back. I still heard echoes of the sound when I went to sleep, but my building was a strict no-pet zone. If they did have a pet, the whole cleaning process would cost me a fortune. When the divorce proceedings had first started, my lawyer had been straight up. This divorce was not going to be pretty for me financially. He told me I should prepare myself for some lean times.

He was right. Times were already bone thin before the divorce. Now, even the bones were gone. I was in a lot of credit card debt, and any extra expense would mean potential bankruptcy for me. 

I decided the best way to do this was a surprise inspection. The night I got the pet complaint, I went out to my car again. Everything I saw–the car, the sky, my keys–were drenched in a thick layer of deja vu. Slipping into my car, I heard the sound and saw the light again in my mind, and it felt like I was somehow getting a glimpse of the inside of my skull.

I ignored all premonitions, and drove out.

Pulling into the parking lot, I got that weird feeling of being watched again. I looked in between the trees, trying to pull out the shape of a person, or even an animal. The sun was going down, and shadows were already splattered black across the far side of the apartment.

By the time I got out of the car, 5E’s door was in a gloom darker than asphalt.

Every step creaked on my way up. I felt naked without my car. I kept glancing back at it, reassuring myself it was still there. 

I got to the doorstep, and took a breath. Through the window and the curtains there were no lights that I could see. Not even a faint glow. The only sounds in the air were those of the night bugs. I waited, raised my fist, then slammed it against the door, hoping the loud noise would either give me confidence or the illusion of it. My knees quaked beneath me like I was suffering from Parkinson's.

I waited for the residents to answer. The sun fell off the end of the earth, and the world lost all definition outside the circle of automatic lights on my building. I shivered, and wrapped my arms around myself. I waited, hoping that I wouldn’t hear that sound again, or see that light.

After a while, I considered slamming my fist down again, when I heard the *snick* of the lock and the creak of the door swinging open.

A pair of eyes looked out at me. The voice that accompanied them was unusually high and wavery, like a violin string. “Yes?”

“Sorry to bother you. Someone said you have pets in there.” I lowered the timber of my voice, but the dryness of my throat broke the last few words like I was some goddamn teenager. I coughed and swallowed. “That true?”

The eyes stared at me for a moment. They weren’t furious, or angry. They seemed curious. From the small opening of the door, an array of smells leaked through. The smell of rotting chicken, fetid vegetables, and…sea salt?

“You gonna make me check?” I rose up and squared my shoulders. I couldn’t do anything about the gut that spilled over my jeans though. The eyes flicked back into the apartment.

“We have…recently acquired a…pet.”

“You can’t do that. It’s in your lease, ‘no-pets.’ You’ll have to pay a fine.”

“How much?”

I was surprised. I thought it would be like pulling teeth to get them to pay. I sat there working my jaw while I tried to remember what the fee was. “...$200. Per week.”

The eyes disappeared for a moment. I heard the noises of shelves and drawers being opened. There was a beat of silence, a shuffling noise, and a hand came through the gap in the doorway. It held a thick wad of glistening cash. “Will this do?”

I reached out and took the money. It was damp, smelled like mildew. It was covered in a jelly-like substance that slid into all the gaps in my fingers and made everything feel as oily and dirty as the bottom of a fridge. I grimaced, and checked the amount. It was the full month paid in advance.

The door began to close, but it stopped. I heard furious whispers come from the crack. There came a hissing sound in retort, but it was silenced by more whispers. The eyes appeared, glowing as the porch lights of the other units began to flick on. 4E’s light, I noticed, remained dark.

“There is a…get together. Tomorrow. Same time as now. We are inviting you.”

Hell no. I knew that much right away. But as I tried to hold the damp money away from my clothes, I had a thought. A dangerous one. This could be the perfect opportunity to judge the damage to the unit. Judging by the state of the money, there was a chance that the entire place was destroyed. 

That could give me due cause to evict them. It was too good an opportunity to pass up.

“I’ll be there.” I stared into the eyes in the doorway. They watched me for a moment longer, and then the door slowly shut on them.

I couldn’t sleep that night. This would end tomorrow. I was excited, and terrified. I needed to be prepared, I couldn’t fuck around on this. What I had seen on my visit played over and over in my head. What had happened inside that apartment? The images of the eyes beyond the door blurred into the light I had seen weeks ago, and I heard the sound so clearly it shook me awake. In my half-asleep state, I reached over for my wife and only found empty space.

In that moment, my heart felt like it had been dead for centuries.

The next day, I got to work. With the money I had gotten the night before, I went out and bought a cheap pistol and a few boxes of bullets. I had never owned a gun before, but I was not stepping foot in that apartment unless I had one.

I let 4E know about the 5E pet situation, and told them in confidence that they might not be neighbors for that much longer. I never got a response. Every other time we had emailed, they had replied to me within the hour. I tried not to think about what that might mean.

My gut was telling me to stay home. That or call the police. But my gut had also told me that my marriage would last forever, that nothing could destroy the love we had for each other. Not a reliable advisor to say the least. You’d be surprised at how many relationships break under the weight of a dead child.

Evening came, and I slid my gun into the waistband of my pants. I got in my car and drove to my apartment building.

I ended up pulling into the parking lot at the same time I had the night before. The air was bloody with the sunsets glow. Again, there was that feeling, like there were eyes everywhere, all pointed towards me. My skin shivered and protested against my muscles. But I couldn’t hesitate. I needed to get this done before it got dark.

I opened the car door and stepped outside.

Making my way to the apartment, I could smell that same stench as before. Rotten things mixed together until I couldn’t define any one source of stink. It filled the space around me, and I tried to breathe through my mouth. I tasted decay. The smell was better. I ascended the steps, trying my best to swallow down vomit.

I reached the door. Already the dark was creeping up like an evil mold. I raised my fist, and felt that pulling in my chest. Get out of there it said. Get out now.

I knocked on the door.

Almost immediately, there was the lock’s *snick* and the door opened wide. The eyes from yesterday were back, peering out at me from the inside of a hoody. “Welcome.” The figure attached to the eyes stood aside, granting me entrance.

I put one hand on my gun and stepped in. The figure closed the door behind me.

The first thing I saw in the apartment were the candles. They covered every surface, melted onto the floor, the couch, the side tables. Each was more of a melted pile than a pillar. On the floor was a circle of them, forming a pool of melted wax that had somehow remained fluid, sprinkled with sea salt around the edges like some perverted margarita. 

In the candle's illumination, I saw what I had hoped to see. Great gaping wounds were gashed into the drywall. The electric cables in the wall had been pulled from their housings and cut. The cables themselves drooped like dead snakes, pooling on the floor in crooked spools.

In all, it was probably thousands of dollars in damages.

Jackpot.

“What the hell is this?” I had to pretend to be angry. Or, I at least had to turn the burning in my chest and ears a notch higher. I was royally pissed, but on the inside, I was also jumping up and down with my fist in the air. “Who the fuck said you could dig in the walls?”.

The eyes in the hood looked blankly at me. They looked around to the walls, almost like they were also seeing them for the first time. “...The murmur.”

“What?”

“They hated it. It was always whispering”

“Whispering? The fuck you talking about?”

“They couldn’t think their thoughts. They needed clarity.”

If I wasn’t already uncomfortable, what this guy was saying was doing the trick. I put my hands behind my back, slowly closing my fingers on the pistol grip. “We need to have a goddamn talk. Where’s the others?”

The eyes stared at me, still confused, then they slowly swung around. They made their way to the bedroom door. They knocked twice, soft. I stood ready, thinking of how cathartic it was going to be chewing the fuck out of them. They were out of here, that’s for goddamn sure.

Then the bedroom door opened, and my teeth clenched.

Two creatures entered the room. Something about them still felt anthropomorphic, but they had long ago shed the label of human. They walked on bowed legs, pants ripped, and dripped with some thick and congealing substance that excreted from their sweat glands. Their arms were twisted in angles, giving the illusion that their creator had graced them with more than many elbows. Their skin was peeling away in large sheets, draping around them like togas and revealing their dark red muscle tissue. Their veins pulsed in the open air like cloth firehoses. 

I could see their organs rippling and trembling through tears in the meat. Pus-dripping cysts bulged from every part of their bodies, some already burst, and others bursting. Everything about them screamed “infection”.

I threw up straight into the pool of wax.

It took a moment for me to see their faces. But when I did…oh god, their faces.

It was like looking at a textbook full of plastic surgery mishaps. Brows were distended in a simian fashion. Lips were of mismatched size and had the consistency of balloons. Eyes were bloodshot and bulging. One of them only had the exploded remains of an orb in their left socket. They each had been retroactively given a cleft pallet, and their teeth emerged in strange angles that seemed to defy nature. One had his bottom jaw severed in two straight down to the neck. I could tell by the way their heads sloshed around that their skulls were soft.

“N- none of you fucking move.” I drew my gun. I tried to keep my shaking knees still.

The eyes and his roommates stood their ground, blinking at the sight of the barrel in their face. I backed away. The gun felt like a cheap toy in my hand. They didn’t even seem frightened of it. A quiet part of my mind told me that if I shot them, it would be like shooting a bag of sand.

I had my hand on the doorknob. It was covered in that jelly substance. I tried to turn it, but my hand kept slipping. The tenants had made no movement towards me. They were still standing stupid and confused, watching me.

I heard something, and I whipped around to point the gun at it. 

The sound, that ancient sound, hit me like a subwoofer.

It was like before, that groaning coming from the depths of somewhere deeper than hell. Except this time it wasn’t filtered through an apartment window and my car door. The minute it touched my ears, I felt something inside twist and expand, and my hands went limp and slid off the slime covered doorknob.

I couldn’t think, I couldn’t move. I had been wiped clean of all but my emotions.

Something emerged from the kitchen.

It did something to my eyes. Made them burn. It was like the cones and rods within them had become white hot, boiling the fluid inside. I wanted to tear the two spheres out of my face. From what I could see of the creature, it was hulking, and had many limbs twisting around it like a living liquid. Its face was concealed in the blind spot that was steadily growing in my vision. It approached me, until I could see nothing but its hulking form and shivering appendages. I felt wet tentacles almost consolingly push down on my shoulders. I went to my knees. I felt those same sopping things begin to sweep across my face, my torso, my legs. I remembered those stupid Halloween games I played as a kid where you’d reach your hand into a box and try to guess what was in the bowl. 

Except this time I wasn’t reaching in. I was being reached.

It felt all of me, lingering on my eyes and just over my heart. It searched my skin, and I remembered my ex-wife. Not the bad times, but the good. Back when she had just been my wife and she had touched me in the same way. Tenderly and with affection.

A jagged needle jabbed my neck, bringing me back to the present. 

More sharp jabs came in the crooks of my arms, and the backs of my knees. Bone-like protrusions that went straight into my veins. Whatever it was before me found blood pathways all over my body, even in my eyelids, and crotch. They put hundreds of sharp things into me, tapping every inner passage that they could find. I probably looked like an acupuncturist's training dummy.

It was still for a moment. Then it began to inject me.

It was like straight lava was being shot into my organs. I felt my body tear with the force of it all. My veins and arteries shredded and my lungs burst as I was filled with that same gelatin-like substance I had seen all over the apartment . The holes in my internal organs gave way for more of the slime, and I felt my intestines inflate. I felt my dick erect, expand, then explode all in three seconds. I wanted to scream, but I felt my larynx tear and rip as my throat filled with whatever it was shooting into me. It reached my tongue. It tasted like bile and feces as it leaked out of my mouth.

I felt my muscles rip apart at the fibers and my skin bulge as it filled between the layers like a water balloon. How was I still alive? The pain was so great, I wanted to die. I waited for my entire body to explode into a pile of jello and bones.

Then it stopped.

I felt the creature release me, and I collapsed.

I couldn’t move. I could only feel. I had gone blind. I writhed on the floor, vomiting up that jelly and felt the wax from the candle pool coagulating on my skin like dried blood. It burned on my raw flesh like acid.

I didn’t die, not for about an hour.

Then something changed.

That crushing loneliness, that feeling of failure I had been carrying ever since my ex-wife had looked me in the eye and said our marriage was over…was gone. I was alone, but I was not alone. In my own body I could feel the presence of the others in the room. I couldn’t see the candles, but I could see the people that had felt like monsters only hours ago. As I looked at them, I saw they were not monsters, they were those misunderstood. Like me. I felt a love I had never felt in my entire life and I wanted nothing more than to embrace them, to call them my own.

Then, as I contemplated this, my mind opened.

I had never truly thought before this moment. It was as if my brain had grown from just the confines of my head and into a structure that reached the far sides of the universe. It swallowed the last of me with its vastness and I was smothered by the weight of all the knowledge that now resided inside of me. I began to weep. Not because of the pain, or the freedom from isolation. 

I wept because of all I now understood.

I felt the hands of the eyes and the roommates. My roommates. They pulled me to my feet.

It’s been a month. 4E would not be joined, so they were consumed. Already we have burrowed our way into apartment 6E. It was a family with three children. Two of them we joined with us, the rest we fed to the beast. Next we’ll burrow into 3E.

For those of you who want to understand…or who have felt the loneliness like I have, I’ll send you an application. Remember to sign the form when you’re finished.

Don’t worry about apartments not being available. We have plenty of vacancies to [make.](https://www.reddit.com/r/agoraphobic_archives/)
