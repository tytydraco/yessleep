In some ways, even after everything that has happened to me so far, the thing that is still the hardest to believe is that I am going to end up going down into that fucking mine after all.  

My mother was not a very patient woman under any circumstance, least of all when it came to religion. She viewed going to church as “pure foolishness,” and she did not mince words when I first asked her why on Sundays we did not, like all my friends, make our way down the winding roads to the river valley where the town’s three churches were clustered. Even so, despite her disdain for dogma in general, and religion in particular, I suppose there was one article of faith that she tried to drill into me, a singular commandment if you will: “Thou Shalt Not End Up in That Mine.”

Back then, in the early 90s when I was growing up, the mine was still in operation. Its hulking plant works loomed over the town like a perched bird of prey and the dark smoke from its operations cast a pall even on bright days. The smoke settled in the seams and folds of our town and kids would walk into class shaking black dust from their hair and onto the floors that were never truly clean of it. You learned not to hang your laundry out on days when the wind wasn’t blowing right unless you wanted to wash it again. 

Even then, as early as I can remember really, the mine was in financial troubles. It had been sold and resold a couple of times, there were layoffs, shift cutbacks. People were worried. I remember a constant sense of fear and unease running through the place, like we were standing on a sheet of ice and hearing loud cracks echo up from below. The people of the town would buy financial trade magazines along with the local weekly to keep track of the likelihood of closures, reading the tea leaves of its fate through hedge fund investment accounts and corporate chicanery.  

The thing was, everyone hated the mine, really. The fathers of my friends dreaded going to work. They would wake up at the crack of dawn-or, if they had the night shift, sleep in the day and eat breakfast when we were getting home from school- and shoulder on their heavy work clothes, slide their thick gloves over their hands, and kick their feet into frayed work boots with a resigned sense of dread in their eyes. Wherever you were in the town you could look up and see the mine hulking over you, and I never once saw anyone turn to look at it with anything but distaste.  But, no matter how much they hated it, everyone seemed to live their lives in perpetual fear that it would close. It made no sense to me as a kid, still doesn’t really. 

Of course, the rumors about the old mine tunnels being haunted were passed around even back then. We would retell them in whispers on sleepovers and camping trips, working ourselves into a state of delicious fear over passed down stories about miners thought long dead returning on dark nights (maybe, we would say, face eerily illuminated by a flashlight, on a night just like this one) to stand just outside of the light and beckon their family to follow them up the mountain and into the mine. Those that did were, of course, never seen again. 

Unless, it was said, when driving on the mountain roads late at night you saw a lost hitchhiker walking on the side of the road. If you were foolish enough to stop on such an occasion, you might see a face half-recognized from yellowed and torn missing person posters, you might marvel at the strange old-fashioned clothing your prospective passenger is swathed in, you might wonder at the strange unearthly glow the stranger emits, at the dank smell of the grave that follows them into your car, and then, if you didn’t have the sense to flee down the mountain in fear before this point, you too would join the ranks of the solitary walkers who were bound to the mountain as if by some dark gravity, trying always to escape its pull. 

Every town probably has a similar local haunted spot that produces ghost stories. But not every town has semi-regular OSHA investigations due to the unusually high death rate among mine workers, not every town gets billing in science journals due to its status as a statistical outlier in missing persons cases and so-called “deaths of despair.” It’s not in every town that adults grab their kids by the arm and tell them angrily to keep quiet, to shut up and go play outside, when they catch them trading horror stories about the mine. It never felt like playing in Tusk when (though they rarely did) the adults talked about the mine being haunted, it never felt like a joke, and I’m starting to think there is a reason for that.   

Anyway, when I was a sophomore in high school, the unthinkable finally happened. Whatever corporate overlord who at that point held title through whatever Byzantine system of corporate LLCs and holding companies decided to cut the losses and pull the plug on the whole sorry operation. 

By this time, the workforce was reduced to a fraction of what it had been in its heyday, and the writing hadn’t just been written on the walls, it had been projected onto them in 4k high-fucking definition, but people still reacted with surprise, with outrage. I think probably because those are easier emotions to express than fear, or guilt. It’s easier to shake your fist and angrily ask “whose fault is this, who are we going to make pay?” than it is to ask the questions that are really gnawing at you: “how are we going to keep up with the mortgage; how are we going to pay for heating oil this winter; what are we going to do now?”  

I didn’t care at the time, I was more concerned with maintaining my position near the upper echelon of Tusk Highschool’s social hierarchy, a position that, given my previous status as a shy kid who liked reading, I felt was perpetually insecure and liable to sudden upheaval. To give credit where it is due, my mother did her best to set me up for success, to instill in me an appreciation of learning and knowledge and to impress upon me the importance of seizing onto the fraying uncertain lifeline leading out of Tusk that doing well in school represented. 

The problem is that teens don’t always listen to their mothers. The problem is that as a parent you can do everything right, you can read to your kid, you can bring him to the library every Saturday, and you can help him with his homework and offer encouragement until you are blue in the face, but there comes a time in most kids’ lives when what their friends think about them starts to matter more than what their mom does. And in Tusk, Montana there was not much of a social premium put on being well-read and getting As in school. 

I’m not sure exactly when she did it, but at some point after my grades started to slip, when I first started getting detentions for acting up in class and suspensions for sneaking alcohol into school events, I think my mom placed the little dream she had of me getting a scholarship to some Ivy league school into a small box and put it away on a high shelf out of sight. I went to a satellite of the University of Montana in a small town about an hour away and struggled through a couple semesters before returning home. 

It was a couple months after I returned home that TJ first suggested we check out the mine, and all this trouble started. 

I was sitting in a faded lawn chair at the end of the driveway smoking a spliff and nursing my third Coors of the evening while watching the sunlight fade behind the mountains. As the darkness came on the tips of the leafless trees surrounding the small clearing around the trailer began to stand out stark and black against the fading sun, like skeletal hands clutching at the sky. I saw TJ’s battered Jeep Cherokee round the corner and accelerate down the rutted dirt road in a spray of dust. The car wheezed to a stop with a crunch of gravel at the end of the driveway, and TJ flung himself from the driver’s seat, leaving the door askew, to sprint toward where I was sitting.

When he reached me, TJ paused, hands on his knees, to catch his breath before speaking. The only sounds for a moment were his ragged breaths, the low rumble of the engine, the faint, rhythmic reproach of the door alert chime, and the whistle of the wind whipping down from the peaks above. 

  “M-mark, dude, you gotta come with me. Ty and me were just up at the mine messing around, and we found something. Something big.” 

I took a slow drag on my spliff, the clumsily rolled paper sending a shower of loose tobacco onto my lap. TJ and Ty were probably up to something stupid. Like most of the friends I had reconnected with who had either never left town, or had returned after an aborted attempt to leave, I knew they were fuck-ups. But, then, what was I? 

If I said no, I knew how the rest of the night would go. I’d sit in this cheap lawn chair slowly getting drunk on a weekday night, telling myself that tomorrow I’d get my shit together and start looking at college applications or looking for jobs out-of-state, but knowing I’d end up in the same place at the end of the night, telling myself the same story about the next day. 

When people ask, I tell them I came home because mom got sick. Because someone needed to take care of her and the property and she could barely get out of bed most days, that her insurance wouldn’t pay for a home health-care aid and we couldn’t afford one. This is all true, but since this is maybe the last thing I will write, I might as well try to tell the whole truth. 

The truth is, I wanted to go home. College felt unfamiliar and scary, and I was out of my depth. My teachers in highschool might have thought I was a major pain in the neck, but they all knew me, we shopped at the same grocery store, went to the same town festivals, and they had watched me grow up. My professors in college were strangers to me and I was intimidated by them. I didn’t know how to ask for help when I got behind and I felt stupid. It was a relief to return home, to where things were familiar and where most of my friends still lived. 

My mother passed away almost two months ago, and I’m still here. I told her I would leave, that I would get out of here and do something that mattered when she was gone. I hope she believed me. 

I think it might be hard to explain to someone who didn’t grow up in a small town, but you have to leave with conviction, with a sense of where you are going and what you want to do that will give you enough terminal force to escape the gravity of the familiar. 

I flicked the spliff away in a shower of sparks and stood up. 

“Okay,” I said, “show me.”

It was nearly fully dark by the time we turned on to the weathered asphalt road that led up to the mine. The dark peaks that stretched out in all directions stood out in stark relief against the fading line of blue that ringed the horizon, and above them the stars were beginning to appear in the darkening sky. TJ was fidgety and anxious in the seat next to me, his hands beating a constant nervous tempo on the wheel as we traversed the steep switchbacks up the mountain. TJ was driving fast and the road pressed in close on the sides, the headlights revealing staccato glimpse of jagged rock formations that were quickly subsumed by the darkness as we passed. The towering formations harbored pockets of deep darkness, and in the reflection of our passing lights it almost appeared as if countless glowing eyes were tracking our progress. They looked hungry. And eager.  

I shuddered and tried to focus my attention on TJ. He was trying to explain to me the discovery they’d made, and its significance for some type of money-making scheme he and Tyler had cooked up, but I was only half-paying attention. I’d grown up with Tyler and TJ, and I knew that most of the ideas they came up with were half-baked to begin with and usually abandoned the instant they stopped being fun, and started requiring actual work. 

I was already mostly regretting my decision to come with him when the car came to a stop in front of the gated entrance to the mine. Arc sodium lights ringed an imposing looking chain-link fence that surrounded the mineworks. Their harsh glare revealed glimpses of giant industrial buildings and heavy machinery, the features appearing alien and threatening amid the surrounding darkness. 

TJ turned the car off and we were immediately enveloped by silence, broken only by the clicking sounds of the engine winding down. TJ got out and I followed him to a section of the chain-link that had been cut with boltcutters, the ends of the twisted metal already browning with rust. We slipped through and headed toward the center of the mine, past empty buildings and towers standing silent and dark like watchful sentinels. 

This place had once been a blaze of light and activity, the 24-hour shifts keeping the noise and darkness at bay at all hours as people rushed between buildings, roaring machines transported raw materials to processing facilities, and below the great noises of heavy machinery churning up earth never ceased. Now it stood silent and empty, the only things left behind,the pollution dredged up and left to fester, and whatever couldn’t be stripped for its value and sold. 

 We picked our way toward the sprawling office complex at the center of the plant, TJ talking rapidly the whole time.

“So, when they left they shut down the power except for the lights, right? That’s what everyone thought. Well, Ty and I were in the office building and we-”

‘Why were you in there?” I interjected. 

“Just bored,” he shrugged, “fucking around.” 

I understood. It was starting to feel like we were getting a bit old to still be going on adolescent capers like we did in highschool, but, well, there wasn’t much else to do. And getting high and going places you weren’t supposed to be was at least a reliable thrill.

“Anyway, we were just messing around in there, when Tyler, he hits a light, like as a joke, and-get this- it turns on.” 

TJ turned to me as if to see my reaction to what was clearly expected to be treated as a shocking reveal. 

“Okayy,” I said hesitantly, “And?” 

“You don’t get it? They didn’t shut off the power, see? They just turned everything off.”

I still didn’t get it. 

TJ sighed. “That’s why I was talking about Bitcoin mining on the way up? We can steal their power and mine for free. We just gotta get ahold of some computers, get them up here, and it’s like printing money.”

I shrugged. It sounded stupid to me. But, then so did crypto on the whole, and plenty of people seemed to have made money off that. 

We were in front of the office buildings now. Their windows stood dark, and reflected the hulking machines and industrial infrastructure that crowded around us. TJ led me to a side door propped open by a stray metal pipe and we went inside. He turned on his flashlight and we followed its beam of light down the hallway, passing the dark holes of empty offices and skirting around abandoned equipment and filing cabinets like survivors returning to explore the ruins and detritus of a society destroyed by apocalypse. 

TJ’s phone lit up as a flurry of texts came in. Service was spotty this high up on the mountain, and he must have just caught a faint signal from the towers below. His face lit up as he stared at the phone, blinking owlishly against the light. 

“Huh, that’s strange,” he said, “just got a text from Tyler. Said he heard some noises and went to check it out while we were gone. He says- he says, it sounded like Aiden.”

Aiden had been in our crew through highschool until, our junior year, he had disappeared without a trace. His father had taken off too- when Aiden was in middle school. Just left in the middle of the night, leaving behind his wallet, car, and his lunch box packed for the next day’s shift at the mine. 

Everyone had assumed Aiden had done the same, like his old man. The search, and you would be generous to call it that, was remarkably perfunctory. The town had a way of forgetting very quickly about the people who went missing. To continue to bring it up for long, or ask questions about what happened, was treated as unseemly. Like you were  trying to stir up trouble. Usually, after someone’s family member went missing it wouldn’t be long before they packed up and were gone without a warning too. It was like they weren’t welcome anymore. Like their presence was a reminder of something we all were in a hurry to forget. 

“Jesus,” I said, “what were you guys smoking up here? You didn’t think to invite me?”

TJ didn’t respond, just bit his lip and looked at his phone again. He looked nervous. 

“Well- should we, go look for him? Or should we just head out, maybe this was a bad idea..” 

“What, and just leave Tyler? Weren’t you his ride? Seems like kind of a dick move.”

I was acting unconcerned, but, secretly, the thought of just getting out of here and leaving Tyler to investigate these imaginary voices on his own sounded pretty appealing. 

TJ’s phone lit up and the sound of his ringtone filled the narrow hallway making us both jump. His face looking pale in the faint glow of his flashlight, TJ slowly raised the phone to his ear, swallowed once and answered it.

“H-hello,” he said in a quiet voice, almost a whisper. 

I could hear Tyler from across the hallway, his voice sounding tinny and out of focus, almost drowned out by static. 

“Jesus, TJ, jesus, come quick please! There’s something down here, down here with me!”

TJ’s eyes were wide. His face so panic-stricken it almost looked humorous. His mouth was moving but nothing was coming out. Tyler continued. 

“I got all turned around. I’m down here and there’s noises. I don’t know how to get back. I-I want to go home.” 

The last was delivered in a sob, it sounded like Tyler was 10 years younger. Like when we were kids crawling through some old tunnels we found in the mountain and he got stuck trying to turn around. 

The phone disconnected with a click and we were in silence again. TJ’s Adam’s apple bobbed up and down violently as he struggled to say something. 

The phone rang again. 

TJ stared down at it held at a distance as if it had turned into a scorpion struggling to deliver a sting. He didn’t answer. 

Trying to act with a nonchalance I was miles away from feeling, I strode over as if frustrated. 

“Oh hell, give it to me you baby. Christ, it’s like babysitting two kids.” I snatched the phone from his hand and answered it. 

“Hello? You done messing with us, Ty? I have to be at work early tomorrow, cut it out and come on up.” 

“Hi, Mark, how are you?”

He sounded utterly at ease, unconcerned like the previous call hadn’t happened. 

“Oh, okay, real funny,” I began, “you almost gave TJ a heart attack’-“

Yes, sorry about that,” he interjected, his voice was smooth and controlled. It was Mark’s voice, but it sounded different. The harsh Montana accent he’d been developing was sanded down. His voice sounded… silky, like a satin hankerchief wrapped around smooth pebbles. 

“Didn’t mean to alarm you two. I found something interesting down here though. I think you ought to come check it out.” 

I held the phone away from me and stared at it. I realized my face was drawn in a grimace of dismay as if reacting viscerally to something rotten. 

I looked up at TJ. He was shaking his head silently, his mouth drawn into a small O of dismay. 

“Should we-“ I started to say when interrupted by the rumbling sound of machinery springing to life. I glanced down the hallway and say the lights on a service elevator go off. The office works were connected directly to the mine, and an elevator was on its way up.

I watched the lights on the side tick steadily up, showing its progress. The hallway was shaking as it sped up, the heavy rusted bulk of the elevator’s passage vibrating in my teeth.

TJ turned without a word and began walking briskly back the way we came. 

I was trying to get a grip, frustrated at us both for acting like scared schoolchildren believing ghost stories, but it felt like I was trying to think through a fog. Fear seized my entire body like I’d just woken from a nightmare and was still struggling to reorient myself to reality. 

“Okay,” I said, turning to follow TJ, “yeah, okay, let’s go wait for him in the car. He can come meet us when he’s done being a dipshit.” 

I started walking quickly. I could hear the service elevator picking up speed behind me. The hallway seemed impossibly long. 

We broke into a run. 

TJ reached the door first, hitting it at full tilt with both hands held out in front of him. The door swung open and hit the wall with a crack. TJ tripped over the pipe that had been propping the door open and went sprawling onto the pavement. I glanced back and saw the elevator door at the end of the hallway slide open with a grinding mechanical groan. 

The blinking red lights of the elevator revealed Tyler standing in the entryway, back straight and arms at his side. Aiden was with him. 

He was wearing the Tusk Highschool track team hoodie I’d last seen him in the day he disappeared and looked like he hadn’t aged a day. They lowered their heads and began to run down the hall. 

My stomach felt like it had turned into lead and I staggered, feeling like my legs didn’t belong to me. I heard a noise and released I was chanting  a monotone “no no no no no” as if a penitent performing some bizarre ritual of atonement. 

I willed my legs to start moving and felt myself regain control of my body. I was beyond thought, beyond reason. My brain felt like a blaring red alert klaxon, the only emotion panic and the only thought “Run.” 

I leaped over TJ, still struggling to pick himself up, his mouth open and frozen in fear as he stared back behind me. I hit the pavement and picked up speed, my knees reaching almost to my chest and arms pumping. The empty plant echoed with the sound of my footsteps, throwing them back at me like I was being hunted by a pack. I thought I heard screams behind me but couldn’t be sure over the ragged sound of my breathing. 

I opened the door to TJ’s jeep, feeling as if any second a hand would descend to clasp my neck and fumbled for the spare keys. I don’t remember the drive back, except for in flashes like a poorly remembered nightmare, but I made it home somehow and collapsed on the floor of my trailer sobbing. 

So, here I am. 

I’m trying to think this through. Trying to reason out what to do. I thought writing it down might help me make sense of it, thought maybe someone on this forum could offer advice. But now I just feel lost. I must have had some type of breakdown. I can’t know what really happened, but, TJ’s jeep is here. So at least some of it must have been real. Did I really leave him there? 

I can’t call the police, what would I even say? I think I have to go back there, back to the mine. Whatever, happened, I left TJ behind. I’m ashamed of that. 

The truth is, though, I’m terrified. I’m a coward. I think some part of me knows that it really happened. Some part of me knew that the stories about the mine were true the whole time. 

But, I came back. I didn’t leave-most of us didn’t. It’s like there’s some sickness deep in the heart of this town. Some weakness that works its way into you, makes you feel like you can never leave. Like you’re not worth anything else and giving in to the darkness that’s calling you will be a relief. If I listen, I can hear it calling me even now. 

....

TJ is at the window. 

.....

I need to leave now. If you read this, thank you for listening to my story. Part of me feels like if things were different, if I’d been stronger, or lived in a different place, I might have done something that mattered, that this wouldn't have been my story. But I need to go now.

My mother is with him.
