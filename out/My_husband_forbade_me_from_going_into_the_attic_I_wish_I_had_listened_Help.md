I didn't have any reason to think there was something being hidden from me in the attic until my husband had his accident.

I had said to him that we might have crutches tucked away somewhere in the attic because my grandfather had used them before he passed and I couldn't remember giving them away.

"No," my husband said from where he was sat upright in pain in the hospital bed.

It wasn't being told 'no' that was the problem. It was how my husband said it. He's always been a soft touch, always pleasant to be around, and more often than not I'm used to getting my way. But not this time. Never had I heard my husband talk to me with such barely concealed panic.

"You have to swear to me you'll not go into the attic," he said, "It's not safe."

Now the thing is I decided not to question my husband on this in the moment. I was too shocked by the way he was talking to me and I could just tell by his tone trying to argue or question him about it wasn't going to get me anywhere. Besides, for a long time, I've considered him to be the love of my life, someone who I trusted more than anyone else.

"I promise I won't," I said to him.

At the time I meant it. I really did. But once I was home alone laying in bed staring off into the dark I just couldn't bare not to find out what it was he didn't want me to find in the attic. I lost my internal battle not to go looking into the attic bit by bit.

First I got myself out of bed to use the toilet, then I told myself I wouldn't be able to go back to sleep without drinking a cup of tea. By the time the kettle finished boiling I had already lost my internal battle to listen to my husband and had gone into the hallway and yanked down the steps from the ceiling.

I started to climb the steps (I was in my PJs with my fluffy slippers) and I pushed open the attic door. A musty smell of old and slightly damp wood greeted me as I climbed all the way up inside. I groped for the light cord which I knew was somewhere nearby and after a few moments managed to find it.

The bare lightbulb in the middle of the attic came on, illuminating the numerous things we had put away over the last few years. It had never occurred to me until that evening how insistent my husband had been that he be the one to go up into the attic and not me. I had always taken it as him doing the manly role of making sure the heavy items were lugged up and down the attic steps; it wasn't like I wanted to argue to do those things myself. At best I had only ever seen my husband standing on the top ladder step whilst I handed him things, or asked for certain items (like our plastic Christmas tree and the other Christmas ornaments) to be brought down.

The first thing I felt upon seeing the attic lit was relief. There wasn't a dead body hidden away as far as I could tell. Then I felt a touch of joy at spotting the crutches in the corner. I felt conflicted because now I knew they were there but I also knew I wouldn't be able to tell my husband since he had forbade me from going into the attic in the first place.

Maybe he had warned me against going into the attic simply because he didn't want to risk me hurting myself by falling down the ladder, or something like that?

I groped for the cord already deciding that must have been what my husband was concerned about when I spotted an item I hadn't seen before.

It was a tall wooden cabinet. The wood it was made of was that cheap Ikea type, certainly note something expensive. Despite this I just felt like something was off about the cabinet. I ventured across the attic being careful not to trip up on all the junk by my feet. I managed to make it over to the cabinet without knocking anything over or injuring myself. I was starting to feel the chill and wanted to get out of the attic as soon as possible, so my only goal was to take a quick look inside the cabinet just to know there was nothing of importance in there.

I noticed my fingers were a little numb from the cold of the attic as I reached for the little round cabinet handle and opened it.

Something red and round sprung out at me and I let out a scream, throwing an arm up and striking the thing before it could hurt me.

After a moment my panic subsided and I had to laugh. It was a balloon. A simple red balloon with a length of string attached to it. At the end of the string was a small plastic weight to prevent the balloon from floating away. I took a few moments to inspect the balloon; it had my name written on it in capitals: B E T H.

For a moment I felt sort of touched as if the balloon were part of some surprise which had been set for me. But that didn't make sense because my birthday was two weeks prior to me going up into the attic and there hadn't been any red balloon with my name written on it with a black sharpie pen.

I checked the rest of the cabinet only to find there was nothing else in there. I decided then that the whole idea of me being worried in the first place had been silly and that, as usual, I should have put my trust in my husband. I considered putting the balloon back into the cabinet but it was getting colder in the attic and I just wanted to get back to bed, so I headed back down, closing the attic door shut behind me then setting the ladder steps up again.

I went to bed and forgot about the cabinet and the red balloon with my name on it. The following morning I went back to the hospital to visit my husband.

I could tell there was something off about him the moment I entered the ward he was in. He was sat upright in bed, his right leg covered in a cast; he had been in the midst of getting out of his car when another driver who had lost control of their vehicle rammed into him, pinning him, and his right leg in particular against an adjacent vehicle. His leg had been broken but would ultimately be fine once given time to heal with the cast on.

We talked about different things, nothing of any importance, but the whole time I could tell my husband wanted to ask me if I had gone into the attic. He was dead serious but trying not to be, watching me with a strange kind of suspicion.

I'd had enough.

"Oh what?" I said, rolling my eyes and sighing exasperatedly, "I went into the attic and there's nothing up there, seriously what's the big deal?"

"You what?" he said, his eyes widening and his face reddening; he wasn't just angry, he was panicking. He was afraid.

I started to doubt myself.

"Dean?" I said, "Please, you're scaring me-"

"-it's okay," he said, "What did you do whilst you were up there?"

"I-I-" I stuttered, feeling the urge to cry, "--I found those crutches I mentioned before-"

"-is that it?" he said, "Did you do anything whilst you were up there?"

I considered lying but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. Besides I had seen what was in the cabinet so the worse that could happen was Dean would be a little bit mad at me for not listening to him. Or so I thought.

"I found a cabinet," I said.

Dean flinched as if I were stabbing a knife between his ribs and into his heart.

"Please tell me you didn't open it," he said.

"I opened it," I said, trying to sound angry as if that might somehow make Dean rethink how he was talking to me and behaving, "There's just a red balloon in there with my name on it. I seriously don't-"

"-what did you do with it?!" Dean shouted.

He grabbed me and yelled at me again, "WHAT DID YOU DO WITH IT?!"

This was so sudden from Dean I didn't know whether to laugh, scream, or break into tears. If it wasn't that I was so confused about what I might have even done wrong I might have done any one of those things; instead I just froze, staring back into his panic stricken face.

"Nothing!" I said in a pitiful voice, "You're hurting me."

He pried his hands off me and stared into his lap.

"Did you put it back?" he said, lifting his gaze back to me, asking urgently.

"N-no," I said, "I just left it out."

Dean cursed so loud I screamed and shied away from him.

"Beth listen to me," he said, "You have to go back to the house right now, go back to the attic, and put the balloon carefully back into the cabinet, do you understand?"

"Why?" I said, "Please this doesn't make any sense."

"I know," he said, "Please Beth you have to trust me, it's extremely important that you go home right now and do as I've asked. Go now. I'll explain everything later. Please, Beth, *please."*

He wasn't demanding this of me like he had done before. It was like he was pleading for his life. I felt sick, and still so helplessly confused. What the heck was so important about a stupid red balloon?

"Okay, fine," I said, "But you better explain this crap when I get back."

"I will," said Dean, "Just go do it, please."

I walked briskly out of the ward and exited the hospital and got back in my car. I replayed everything that had been said between Dean and I at the hospital and with every passing moment I found myself wondering why I was doing what he asked; was he losing his mind? Was I? I just didn't understand what was so important about putting the balloon back into the cabinet.

The only question that stuck in my mind on the ten minute drive home was how the balloon had been so full of air when I had found it. Had Dean recently bought the balloon and put it into the cabinet? Or was he somehow making sure the balloon was being continually filled with helium or something like it to make sure it always remained afloat? But then why would he do any of those things in the first place? What was the significance of any of it?

My initial fear and concern I felt for Dean was only tempered by the fact that I was on a mission. I reached the front door, entered inside our home, walked up the stairs to the upstairs hallway. I reached up, doing a little jump to grip the pull down ladder, then pulled it all the way down. Finally I started to climb the ladder and after pushing open the attic door I made my way inside.

I spotted the red balloon with my name on it floating up against the attic ceiling. Looking at it I tried to figure out what it was that was so important about it but it was just. A. Balloon.

It felt underwhelming to take hold of the string and to guide the balloon back to the cabinet. I was about to put the balloon back inside before I stopped myself. Since I had it right in front of me I decided I would look it over one more time just to make sure there was nothing obviously strange about it.

The thing is I have long, manicured nails. Always have. I love them that way and Dean does too. Without meaning to I gripped the balloon a little too hard whilst looking it over and it popped. I gave a little scream as the string, now no longer being held up by the balloon, hung like a limp flower in my grip.

For a horrible moment I wondered if there was something to the gas inside the balloon which was poisonous, but the air I was breathing seemed fine.

In fact, nothing seemed amiss. The balloon had popped and...that was it. No big deal. The world hadn't ended. No demon had been freed from the confines of the balloon. If anything had been let loose from the balloon now it had burst was a renewed sense of annoyance at Dean for making me worry about what was in the attic.

I put the string and the pieces of the balloon into the cabinet and closed the cabinet after. And after I did this a horrible notion occurred to me. What if, by some strange unknowable reason, Dean's life-force was connected to the balloon? This was by far the strangest idea that had ever came into my mind but somehow it made an odd kind of sense. I had never seen anything supernatural in my life, and had no reason to believe in such things, but even so the notion that the balloon by its existence was keeping something at bay (like preventing my husband's death somehow) stuck in my mind.

I called him, only to notice several failed calls from him because my phone had been on silent.

"Beth?" he said.

There was something off about his voice but I couldn't tell what it was. It wasn't that he was panicked, more panicked than I had ever heard him in my life; it wasn't that he sounded particularly different; but there was something off that I just couldn't place.

"I'm here," I said.

"Did you put it back?" he said.

"Yes," I lied, "It's back in the cabinet."

I could hear the relieved sigh from him on the other end of the phone.

"Okay," he said, "Just get out of there."

"Dean, what the heck is going on?" I said. 

What Dean told me next was a blatant lie. I could tell right away and I think he knew how obvious the lie was even as he told it.

"I made a bet with Pete that I could keep a balloon from popping for a whole year," said Dean, "He said he'll pay me five grand if I can manage it."

This sounded like something Dean and Pete would do, but it was so clearly a lie.

"Oh, okay," I said, "That's so silly, you had me worried."

"Y-yeah," said Dean, "S-sorry, it's so stupid, I know, but I didn't want to lose the bet."

After a brief back and forth asking me if I was okay and me telling him I was fine I hung up the phone. I headed back down from the attic and closed it all up behind me.

After I popped the balloon something massive had changed. But it wasn't something I could put into words right away. It was something nearly indescribable at first. Ever since I popped the balloon by accident a feeling of having lost something had stuck with me. It was a feeling I had known before back when my parents had died a decade before in a freak accident. A nasty, hollowed-out kind of feeling.

I tried to keep myself busy around the house for the remainder of the day but I found the feeling of loss was getting worse, not better. Bit by bit I noticed I was pretending to be okay when I really wasn't. I tried watching one of my favourite reality TV shows and found I couldn't concentrate on what was happening on the show at all; I was lost in my own thoughts questioning the worsening sense of dread taking hold of me with every passing moment. 

It was as if someone had put a bear trap around my heart and was squeezing it tight to make sure each sharp edge were puncturing deeper, carving up the muscle and drawing ever more blood from the tender flesh trying to beat despite the fatal wounds inflicted on it. 

I slipped off the couch and found myself gasping for air. I could hardly breathe and I was panicking so bad I was sure I was going to have a heart attack. The living room and the entire world around me seemed to fade into an obscure mist as I struggled to keep air moving in and out of my lungs. 

A guttural kind of whine choked out of my throat as if I had forgotten how to breathe entirely. Strange spots like static from an old TV showered around my field of vision before everything went dark. When I woke, the daylight outside had been replaced by a black veil and I could hear my mobile phone buzzing on the carpet. Drools had pooled from my mouth onto the carpet and I could feel dampness around my crotch from where I must have wet myself during my panic before. I breathed in a hard lungful of air, my eyes frantically searching around me. 

After a few minutes I managed to have the sense of self to sit upright, the living room swaying some as I situated my back against the sofa. 

I spotted my phone. There were thirty missed calls from Dean. Just reading his name on the screen elicited a fresh wave of panic in me and I found myself retching until a string of bile dribbled from my mouth onto the carpet. 

Each time I looked at Dean's name on the phone a fresh bout of retching took hold of me. *What was wrong with me?* What was happening? Please, I thought, please whatever is causing this make it stop. 

My phone vibrated again from a new call from Dean. I wanted to answer it but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. 

He keeps ringing. I know I should answer it but something inside me would rather die than hear his voice. 

What's wrong with me? I don't know what to do. Help.
