Let me start by saying this: I'm dying. This morning was one of the most bizarre and fucked up nights anyone could ever experience. I doubt anyone will take this seriously, but I don't care. I'm posting this while I still have a chance because my time here is extremely limited. Some would call me a crazy alcoholic, but I’d bet you’ll never find me online after this. This is what happened in my house last night.

 I work as a roadkill handler, I’m hired by the city to remove wildlife and other road obstructions. I’ve picked up tires, furniture, and even a refrigerator once. Most of the job, though, involves scraping, peeling, or popping the corpses of long-dead animals stuck to the asphalt like melted cheese on a hot grill. The smell of decay and hot tar lingers in the air, a constant reminder of the work that needs to be done.

Being on call means I always have to be ready for my phone to ring at the most inconvenient times. Immediately after arriving home, having a few drinks, and taking a shower, I received a call back. During family dinner, I received a call. It even happened to me in the middle of a date. 

I have one guaranteed day off with no work interruptions and another day off where I can be called if needed. Usually, Wednesday is my flexible day, while Sunday is my guaranteed day off. There are two other people in my area who do the same job, and we cover for each other if someone is sick or unavailable. This often leads to overtime and a bigger paycheck. The money is decent, and since I live alone, I don’t have many expenses.

One of those other guys is Kevin. He’s the guy they usually call for the main city area, while I deal with the countryside. After a night of too many White Russians, my boss called me at three in the morning, startling me from my heavy, drunken sleep. I ended up lying to him.

“Hello?” I rubbed my eyes.

“Hey, Partner, I’d hate to do this, but I’m getting multiple reports of something large on the side of the highway past the Chevron just outside Wraithwood.” 

I knew he would call me on a night like this. It feels almost like a sixth sense for him.  

“I’m sorry, sir, but I’ve felt like absolute dog shit all day today. I haven’t been able to get out of bed.” 

He cut me off. His words sliced through mine like a hot knife. “Well, why didn’t you call ahead to let me know?” 

“I’ve literally been asleep all day, sir. I’ll call Kevin to see if he’ll do it for me.” 

“Don’t do this again. We’re short staffed, and the longer something is on the road, the more of a hazard it is. If someone gets hurt, it’s MY ass. Let me know if Kevin will do it. Thanks.” 

He then hung up abruptly, and I could feel his irritation through the phone. It was clear he wasn’t happy with me. I was going to hear about this at the next monthly staff meeting.

I rolled onto my back, groaning in frustration. It was impossible for me to go back to sleep for at least a couple more hours. I grabbed my phone and called Kevin. His phone rang twice before he answered. He must’ve already been on the clock. 

“Hey, Ben. What’s up?” He asked. 

“I got called in to pick something up. I'm stuck sick in bed and I was wondering if you wanted to make a little extra?”  

There was a moment of silence before he responded. The sound of the eerie dead air was thick and suffocating. “Yea, I can do that. Where?” 

“It’s just down the road past the Chevron outside of Wraithwood.” 

“Did he say what it is?” 

“No sir,” I said. “He just told me it was big.” 

“Alright. Well, I hope you get to feeling better. Have any idea what’s wrong?” 

“I think I just have a cold or some sort of virus. Just been in bed all night,” I lied to him too. “And hey, Kev, can you let him know that you’ll do it? I kinda told him at short notice and, well..you know how that goes.” 

“Yea, I can do that. I’ll text him for ya. Goodnight.” 

I hung up and felt relieved that the situation was over. My shift was covered at least for now. I’d deal with the Boss later. Since I was awake and rarely had free time, I decided to make the most of it. I showered, made some coffee, and played some Playstation. 

Something wasn’t right.

After about twenty minutes of playing, an uneasiness overcame me. A chill ran over me like whispering secrets I wasn’t supposed to hear. With a sinking sensation, I realized something was very wrong. Dread pooled in the pit of my stomach, and an inexplicable sense of foreboding washed over me, as if some malevolent force had taken an interest in my little corner of the world. Then the phone rang.

The shrill ring shattered the eerie silence, echoing through the room like a warning bell tolling in the dead of night. My heart skipped a beat as I stared at the innocuous device, its screen illuminating the darkened room with an ominous glow. As I picked it up, to my absolute confusion, it was Kevin. I dreaded the thought that he had changed his mind and left whatever it was there. What he would proceed to tell me would change the course for the rest of my short life. 

“Hey, what's up?” I asked nervously. 

“Hey, I need you to look at this.” His voice was shaky, sounding terrified. 

Within seconds, a picture was sent to my phone. I put him on speaker and opened up the text. I had no clue what I was looking at. I couldn't tell if the thing had been disfigured from the impact, or if the image was just bad quality.  

It had gray skin, like a pig’s, with blue veins and bruises covering most of its body. Its head had a beak-like structure and large, dark eyes. Pointy ears with tufts of hair protruding out. Its feet were clawed, therapod-like, curled up as it lay there. The sight was truly disturbing. Kevin had to say my name multiple times to snap me out of my confused stupor. Nothing in the picture made sense and my mind couldn’t fathom it at all. 

“What the fuck?” I mouthed to myself. 

“I’m still going to grab it. How do I even report this? Do I check off deer?” 

He genuinely sounded frightened, and I didn’t blame him, considering he was actually there looking at the damned thing. 

“It could be a partially decomposed deer.” I said to him, trying to calm him down. But I knew that wasn’t the case. I had no idea what it was. 

“I don’t feel good at all, man.” He said in a croaky, hoarse voice.

“What do you mean?” 

“I’m nauseous. I..need..to sit down in my truck.”

I sat up and started making my way to the front door. Placing the phone between my ear and my shoulder, I put my boots on. “Hold on,” I stood up grabbing my keys. “I’m on the way.”

In hindsight, it might have been a stupid idea. I couldn’t leave him out there alone feeling the way he did. He really sounded ill, and I felt compelled to help him out. I hung up, and stepped outside. It was still dark and I could see my neighbor Bob Reynolds watering his flowers. He's always up this early in the morning messing with his lawn. The flowers were not happy. They were slouching and losing color. I waved at him as I got to my truck.

“How are you doing this morning Ben?” He yelled from across the way waving back.

“Gotta go to work. The usual. Can’t get those flowers to stand up?”

“I swear these fuckin' things make me want to shoot myself.” He replied, putting a finger gun to his temple. 

I laughed, “Well you have a wonderful morning, Bob!” I started my truck, reversed out and headed in Kevin’s direction. 

After fifteen minutes of driving through the pitch black night, the Chevron emerged in the distance. Its neon lights flickering erratically and casting shadows with an eerie, pulsating glow. Further down the road, Kevin’s red hazards blinked ominously in the darkness. As I slowed my truck to a crawl, I could see the creature lying there. It was even uglier in person; I was shaken, barely able to make out most of its features. I pulled up behind his truck, flipped on my hazards, stepped out and approached his driver side window. 

He was sitting there asleep, resting his forehead on the steering wheel and was breathing heavily. I tapped the glass a couple of times with no success and shouted his name, but he didn’t respond. Eventually, I decided to open the door and shake him awake. He lifted his head, barely able to pry open his eyes, which seemed to be glued shut. Sweat poured down his brow, and he was as white as a ghost. 

“Kev,” I said, trying to bring him back to the present. 

He started to open his eyes, their gleam reflected the moonlight through the slits. With a hoarse whisper he uttered, “Mom?” 

I shook him a little more, “No it's Ben.”

His eyes finally opened completely and he acknowledged me.

“Oh..yeah..that's right. I thought you were sick.”

“I lied. I have to help you get this off the road. It can’t stay here.” 

He stepped out of his truck and tossed his coat into the passenger seat. Opening up his backseat door and grabbed a bottle of water from a large pack he keeps back there. He chugged the whole thing down within ten seconds. “I was starting to think I caught something from you. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me.” He said, leaning against his truck. “I was feeling fine all day until I got here, in the middle of our phone call. I think I need a doctor.” 

I retrieved my flashlight and gloves from my center console. I put them on and clicked the light. “I don’t know what's wrong either, but we’ll get you to a hospital as soon as we figure out what to do with this. It could be an endangered species, a new one, or foreign. Let's throw it in my truck, go to my house, and I’ll make some calls. We can’t let anyone see this thing. After that we’ll get you to a doctor.” 

He nodded with whatever energy he had. I knew lifting this thing was going to wear him out completely, so we waited a few minutes for him to gather up his strength. Eventually the time had come. 

I hadn't been anywhere near the thing since I showed up, and now it was time to get up close and personal. With my flashlight, I headed towards the carcass. Kevin followed behind me, albeit slowly, his footsteps dragging. My flashlight illuminated the fog line to my left as we approached the abomination. 

A few steps forward and there it was. My god, it was horrid, heinous, vile, and despicable. This was not a deer. It had feet with claws, similar to a raptors. Its face was detestable. Its gray skin glistened in the moonlight, tufts of hair danced in the wind. It was about the size of a Great Dane, and its head was..unusual? Its skull appeared exposed, with what seemed like eye sockets on top. Two black orbs lay in those holes catching the beam of my flashlight as if it were looking right at me. Rows upon rows of jagged teeth lined its mouth, resembling those of a Mako Shark. It lacked lips, with the teeth protruding prominently. 

“You okay, Kev?” I asked him. 

“I don’t know,” he replied, making his way to the other side of the creature. “Let's get this done with.” 

I opened up the bed of my truck, opened up the toolbox and pulled out the blue tarp. I hopped back down and spread it across the bed like a blanket. Placing the handle of the flashlight in my mouth, I leant over and grabbed the thing by its back legs while Kevin took the front. On the count of three, we hoisted it into the bed of my truck. It landed with a thump, the tarp crinkling and shifting. I proceeded to fold the tarp over the corpse and shut the bed. When I turned around Kevin was gone. Mildly confused, I soon heard gagging sounds. He had wandered about ten feet into the grass and was violently throwing up. 

When he finished, he stood up, his knees wobbling, and then he collapsed. He passed out. Dropping like a sack of potatoes. Thankfully, he landed in the grass and didn’t hit his head. 

I rushed my way over to him and noticed he was still somewhat conscious. 

“My god!” I exclaimed. 

I grabbed his hand helping him up. He leaned on my shoulder as we made our way to the truck, dragging his feet behind and mumbling things I couldn’t understand. I could’ve sworn I heard him say, “Mom” a few times. 

We reached the passenger door of my truck, I opened the door, and leaned the seat back so he could lie down. He moaned and groaned, holding his stomach as I clicked the seat belt on. I shut the door and walked around to the driver's side. On my way, I started to feel nauseous. I placed my hand on the back of the truck and leaned over to take a moment. This was utterly intense. I’ve never felt anything like it before. Not even after my worst nights after heavy drinking. I shook it off and continued on my way. Once I got to the seat, I started the truck and put it in drive. I drove away, and since the road was empty, I made a U-turn. I needed gas, so I planned to stop by the Chevron for a quick fill-up. Kevin's red hazard lights flashed in the rear view mirror, their eerie glow pulsing like a heartbeat in the dark, deserted night. 

When we got there, I pulled up to pump three and turned the truck off. Kev was asleep and hadn't moved or said anything for a while. As I opened the door to get out, I heard a crackling sound coming from the bed. There was no wind. The noise grew louder, sending chills down my spine as I glanced back, feeling a cold dread creep over me.

I paused for a moment thinking my mind was playing tricks on me, but I swear I saw it move in my peripheral. Lifting up a corner of the tarp, I took a peek at it. 

It was still dead. 

I shrugged it off. I wasn’t feeling great, and maybe I just wasn’t paying attention to the weather. However, I noticed the gas station lights strobing riotously, as if they were about to burst. I walked to the front entrance of the store. 

I opened the door, and an electronic bell rang, but it sounded broken. It was like a toy with low batteries, starting with a high-pitched ding that quickly depreciated before cutting off abruptly, leaving an eerie silence in its wake. 

The clerk was behind the counter, leaning over with his head in his hands, looking pale. I walked over to the medicine aisle and grabbed some Dramamine. When I returned to the counter, the clerk was now looking up at me, his eyes glassy and unfocused, as if he were staring right through me.

“That be it?” He asked faintly. 

“No,” I slid him a twenty on the counter, “Need fifteen on three.” 

He struggled to grab the money, but he was able to make the transaction. Out of vertiginous curiosity, I asked him, “You okay?” 

“I don’t know,” he replied softly. “I don’t know what’s wrong. Everyone that’s come in the past few hours have been sick too. Maybe there’s an epidemic? Maybe I caught something from someone?” 

He handed me my change, “I tried to call for a paramedic, but the phones aren’t working. Not even my cell.” 

I pulled my phone out of my pocket, but the screen wouldn't stay still. Anytime I tried to click on something, it would jumble and flash like technical diarrhea. It didn’t make sense; I’d never seen it act like that before. The clerk's phone was doing the same. He looked up from his device, his voice shaky. “Maybe I’ll shut the store down and drive myself to the hospital. I suggest you get a move on, sir. Whatever is causing this interference hasn’t affected the pumps.” 

The fluorescent lights above flickered as if echoing his words, casting unsettling shadows on his face. He seemed to grow paler by the second, his eyes darting nervously to the darkened corners of the store. I snatched my medicine off the counter and offered him a pill, which he gladly took. I told him to get better and hurried to the pump. Quickly, I pumped the gas and started the truck. I took off back towards my house, the engine's growl the only sound in the eerie stillness of the night. As I drove, the shadows on the empty road seemed to dance and stretch unnaturally, as if alive. 

After about fifteen minutes, I started to feel dizzy. As I pulled into my driveway, I opened the door and threw up on the concrete. The acid taste lingered, and the night air did little to clear my head. I shut the door and glanced over at Kevin. He was still asleep next to me, looking as pale as a sheet. His breathing was shallow, and every exhale seemed to be an effort. He wasn’t doing well, and neither was I. Anxiety filled my chest, making me feel worse. The oppressive silence around the house was almost palpable, the shadows cast by the porch light seemed to crawl and twist on their own. I tightened my grip on the steering wheel and took some breaths to get my bearings. The air was thick, almost stifling, with a sense of foreboding that gnawed at the edges of my mind.

I shook Kevin, but he didn’t wake, just kept breathing heavily. I pushed him again, and he started to shuffle around, sweat dripping from his brow. His shirt was soaked, and he was as hot as a skillet. He then startled me so much that I almost punched him in the face out of a knee-jerk reaction.

When he finally opened his eyes and looked at me, they bulged out of his head, and he let out a shrill scream. He started to look behind me, grabbing at me as if I was a human shield. He wouldn’t stop. 

“Kev!” I shouted. “It’s Ben! Calm down!” 

There was a moment of struggle, but after around thirty seconds of him panicking, I managed to grab onto his wrists and make him relax. He started to cry. I got out, opened up the garage door, and pulled in. Once the truck was parked, I closed the door and secured the electronic lock. The carcass and the blue tarp still lay in the bed of the vehicle. Walking over to Kevin’s side, I opened the door for him. He just sat there, looking off absentmindedly. 

“C’mon, man,” I said weakly. “We gotta go in and figure out what we’re gonna do.” 

He still sat there. Looking like a frightened toddler too scared to walk into the funhouse. He dreaded any movement in his vision. “I saw her, Ben.” 

“Who?” I asked.

“My mother.” 

“What do you mean?” I asked, reaching my hand out to help him. He obliged and managed to stand, though he nearly fell over from weakness. With my support, he was able to walk with me. 

“She died when I was a kid,” he said softly as we made our way to the door leading into my house. “I was eight, and we got into a car accident.” Someone t-boned the car on her side. I passed out when it happened. I remember waking up on a paramedic gurney.” He paused again as we walked into the house. He started to sniffle, tears welling up. I shut the door behind us and led him to the couch. 

“All I could do was ask for my mom. ‘Where is my mom? Give me my mom!’ But everyone ignored me. They just told me to calm down and put an oxygen mask on my face,” his voice trembling, “I sat up and saw her black Dodge Stratus completely totaled.” Tears streamed down his face as he sat on the couch. “I saw her body still in the driver's seat. Her skull was split in half vertically, and her left eye was dangling out by the nerve. She was looking right at me. I swear her other eye blinked! The paramedics just pushed me back down, and I couldn’t react. I didn’t even remember it happened until therapy when I turned sixteen after misbehaving at school. I saw her just now, Ben.” 

I was shocked. I only knew Kevin as a coworker and I didn’t really know anything personal about him until now. We never hung out or spent time together outside of work; we just helped each other out on the job occasionally. But hearing all this, things started to make sense. He was always quiet and reserved, always lost in his thoughts. It seemed like he worked all the time to keep his mind occupied. 

He continued. “I loved her. I never had anybody else since then. I’ve been fucked up ever since that day. I should’ve never looked up.” He lay his head in his hands and he sobbed. 

I sympathized with him. I’ve never been through anything like that, but I understood his pain. Suddenly he shouted.

“She was just behind you in the garage! Just crouched in the corner smiling! It wasn’t her! I look at pictures of her every night before I go to bed, and that was not her face! It looked like someone else was wearing her face! Split fucking skull and everything! The voices too. Oh my god, Ben. The voices don’t fucking stop!” His voice cracked with fear and desperation. 

I was confused. Was he having fever dreams? It made sense since his temperature was super hot. But the way he freaked out in the garage, he was awake. Fully lucid. I know he was because he acknowledged me and looked at me right in the eyes when he was done. Sleep paralysis? Couldn’t be, because he was moving and grabbing at me manically. Hallucinations with a fever dream are common, but why did his visions seem so vivid? 

“Voices?” I asked. “I don't hear anything.” I tried to keep him calm, but he was genuinely freaking me out. Was this going to happen to me? I was slowly but progressively feeling worse every minute. The Dramamine I picked up helped with my nausea, so I gave him a pill and some extra strength Tylenol with a glass of water. 

He chugged the water, his eyes half closed as he looked at me and said, “They’re just speaking gibberish. I don’t know what they’re saying. It sounds like English, but they have an effect on them, like sound mixing in music panning from ear to ear. It’s super freaky.” He placed his glass on my coffee table with a loud clunk that echoed through the house. He didn’t mean to make it so loud; he just doesn’t have much control over his body. “Well, let's get this shit done so I can get to a doctor.” 

Just then, the TV flipped on with an EAS message. The AI voice trailing behind.

“Warning: Nuclear plant leak detected in your area. Please remain calm and stay indoors. DO NOT use the telephone unless absolutely necessary to help keep cell and landlines open for emergencies.” 

Kevin and I looked at each other wide-eyed and confused. How could that be possible? The plant had never had a leak before in my lifetime. It’s heavily monitored and consistent. Have we been poisoned? The clerk at the gas station too? Everyone else? He guessed an illness had been going around, so does that mean it was going on all night without being announced until now, at almost six a.m? 

“Ben, what the fuck is going on?” 

“I don’t know.” I stepped aside and walked into the kitchen. “I’m going to try and call for help.” 

I pulled my phone out of my pocket, but nothing had changed. Even my house phone was useless. Calling for help was impossible. The screen flashed and jumbled so much that I thanked God I wasn't epileptic. It was a nightmare to look at. 

Kevin started to slouch further into the couch, holding his head and groaning. My head started to pound as well, a million knives lodging into my temples. My temperature was up too; my skin was on fire. My mouth was as dry as bone. I got myself a glass of water, and as a result of drinking it too fast I choked. Covering my mouth, I noticed red droplets. 

Blood.

I rushed into the bathroom next to the garage entrance and looked in the mirror. I looked terrible. White as a marshmallow, eyes sunken in, and sweat dripping down my temples. I opened my mouth to take a look and saw my gums bleeding. Not a lot, but enough to spray droplets out of my mouth. Then I heard Kevin in the living room shout, “Oh my god!” Peeking around the corridor, I saw him with wads of his hair in his hands, pulling it out. It didn’t look painful, it was just falling out every time he grabbed it. 

In these moments, a loud crash came from the inside of the garage. 

It sounded like metal objects clattering to the floor, startling us both. We looked at each other, and surprisingly, Kev stood up. He looked like he was about to faint, so I motioned for him to sit back down. I reached under the couch and pulled out my shotgun. A Stoeger Double Defense twelve gauge, already loaded. I slid two more shells into my coat pocket, and headed toward the door. 

I slowly opened it, lifting my gun as I did so. It squeaked loudly, echoing my own sense of unease. Flipping on the light, I watched it flicker with uncertainty before finally illuminating the garage. My toolbox lay on the floor, tools scattered about, and a slimy fluid coated the ground, glistening like oil and leaving a trail. It led from the back of my truck, the blue tarp draped over the tailgate logo. As I took in the sight I started to hear a squishy sound. It was unlike anything I’d ever heard before, seemingly all around the two car garage. 

My gaze followed the slime trail, leading me to dread the implications. No. No, it can’t be. It was dead. I cautiously approached the bed of the truck and peered inside. 

The carcass was not there. 

The squishing grew louder, more prevalent, accompanied by a low-pitched gurgle emanating from beneath. The next thing I did, still haunts me. 

I crouched and took a peek. 

The stench was unbearable, forcing me to breathe through my mouth as I gripped the shotgun tightly. I saw it. There, floundering like a fish out of water. It’s face…oh god. Its face was just as horrifying as before, and as it noticed me, it looked directly at me. I swear there was recognition behind its dark, spheroid eyes, and for a moment, it smiled at me. 

Its jagged, nasty teeth made unsettling sounds as they curled around its mouth. Then it began convulsing, a sickening mix of bones breaking and mending. I panicked and ran. In hindsight, I should’ve taken the chance to shoot it, but fear overwhelmed me. My instinct to flee was quicker than my instinct to fight. It made rippling, gasping noises as I sprinted up the small steps, slamming the door and locking it. 

I walked further into the kitchen, turned to face the door with my gun ready, and collapsed onto the floor. I couldn’t hold it any longer. I vomited violently, blood streaking through the mess like a disturbed watercolor painting. Kevin stumbled into the kitchen, leaning against the wall for support. His hair was now patchy, about forty percent of his hair was gone. “What the fuck was that?” he asked, his voice trembling with confusion. 

I wiped my mouth and held the shotgun up facing the door. “That goddamned thing is alive!” 

“What?” 

“It’s fucking alive! It’s in there!” 

His eyes widened in shock and turned his head towards the garage. The silence was deafening, each moment stretching out painfully. He slid down the wall, sinking to the floor in shock and exhaustion. Minutes dragged by as we waited anxiously, expecting the creature to slam into the door or attempt to break through in some way. But nothing happened. The first light of dawn began to filter through the windows, casting long shadows across the kitchen. Exhaustion weighed heavily on us both. My eyelids drooped, and I found myself slowly lowering my gun, dozing off.
