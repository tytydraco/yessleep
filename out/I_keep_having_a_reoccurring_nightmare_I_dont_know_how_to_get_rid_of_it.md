I've been having nightmares for weeks now. Every time I close my eyes, I see a monster with piercing red eyes and long, gnarled claws. It chases me through dark, twisting corridors, always just out of reach. I wake up in a cold sweat, heart racing, and try to shake off the feeling of fear that lingers.  
  
I've tried everything to get rid of the nightmares. I've meditated, taken sleeping pills, and even sought therapy. But nothing seems to work. The monster still haunts my dreams, and I'm starting to become afraid to go to sleep at night.  
  
During the day, I am exhausted from lack of sleep, and my productivity at work is suffering. I can't concentrate on anything, and I find myself jumping at every little sound. My colleagues have noticed the bags under my eyes and ask if everything is okay, but I can't bring myself to tell them about my nightmares. I'm afraid they'll think I'm crazy.  
  
As the days pass, my fear grows. I find myself constantly looking over my shoulder, half-expecting to see the monster lurking in the shadows. Even when I'm not asleep, I can feel its presence all around me. It's like a dark cloud that follows me wherever I go, always threatening to envelop me in its grasp.  
  
I become paranoid and start to lock all the doors and windows in my apartment, convinced that the monster is trying to get in. But then, I realize how foolish I'm being. How could a figment of my imagination harm me in the real world?  
  
One day, something strange happens. I'm at work, and I see something out of the corner of my eye. When I turn to look, there it is - the monster from my nightmares. It's standing just outside the window, staring at me with those same piercing red eyes.  
  
My heart stops, and I feel like I'm going to faint. I blink, and it's gone. I assume it was just a hallucination, a product of my sleep deprivation. But the experience leaves me shaken, and I can't concentrate on anything for the rest of the day.  
  
That night, I stay up as long as I can, hoping to avoid the monster's grasp. I watch TV, play video games, anything to keep my mind off the nightmare. But as the night wears on, I can feel myself getting more and more tired.  
  
Finally, I can't keep my eyes open any longer. I crawl into bed, pulling the covers up over my head. I try to tell myself that the monster isn't real, that it's all just in my head. But as soon as I close my eyes, I'm back in the nightmare.  
  
This time, the monster is closer than ever, its claws inches from my face. I try to scream, but no sound comes out. I can feel its breath on my face, and the smell of its rotting flesh makes me want to vomit.  
  
The only thing I can do is watch. I can't move, I can't run. But I notice something different about the environment I'm in. The nightmare always takes place in these winding corridors, completely unfamiliar and new to me. But this environment seems familiar... and I realize with a horrifying sense of dread, it's my bedroom. I'm awake, and the monster is here.  
  
The monster begins to move, slowly but surely, closer and closer to me. I can feel its breath on my face, and the smell of its rotting flesh makes me want to vomit. Just as the monster is about to grab me, I sit up in my bed.  
  
The monster is gone. I'm awake again. But I know it's only a matter of time before it comes back. I never want to sleep again, always watching over my shoulder for the monster that haunts my nightmares. And one day, I know it will catch me, and I won't wake up again.
