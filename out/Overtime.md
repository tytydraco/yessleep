It was almost midnight when I finally looked up from my spreadsheet. The office was silent except for the low hum of the ventilation system. Most of the lights had shut off hours ago, leaving only the pale pool of my desk lamp over the keyboard. I’d stayed late plenty of times before, but tonight… something felt different. The air felt heavier, as if the room was holding its breath. My ears rang faintly in the quiet.

I saved my work, stretched, and decided to grab a drink from the break room before finishing the last report. The hallways were dark, the motion sensors kicking on only when I was halfway through each corridor. That’s when I heard it — footsteps. Slow. Steady. Behind me.

I told myself it had to be Janet from accounting — she sometimes worked late too — but when I turned around, the hallway was empty. No footsteps. No movement. Just shadows. I held my breath, straining to hear. The sound didn’t come again until I started walking.

I quickened my pace, my shoes clicking louder than I wanted them to. The footsteps followed. I reached the break room and flicked the light switch. Nothing. The bulb hummed faintly, but the room stayed dark.

That’s when the sound changed. The footsteps stopped, replaced by a faint *scraping* — slow, deliberate, like fingernails trailing along the wall just outside the doorway. My stomach tightened.

I backed out, heart thudding, and headed to my desk. My monitor was still on, but my spreadsheet was gone. In its place was a new file, filling the screen with a single sentence, typed over and over in neat black letters:

**DON’T TURN AROUND.**

I just stood there. The air behind me shifted — warm, damp, as though someone was leaning in close.

And then I heard it. Breathing. Wet. Slow. Too close to be real.

My fingers trembled over the keyboard, but before I could move, the desk lamp flickered once… twice… and went out.

The darkness wasn’t empty.

I woke up in my bed the next morning, drenched in sweat. My alarm clock was blinking 12:00 — the power must have gone out in the night. My head throbbed, but the sunlight spilling through the blinds was almost enough to make me laugh. Just a nightmare. A bad one, but still a dream.

I shuffled to the bathroom, still groggy. The cold tile woke me up as I turned on the faucet and splashed water on my face. My reflection looked pale, eyes sunken — like I hadn’t slept in days. As I brushed my teeth, the lingering unease from the dream started creeping back in.

Something about the way the air felt… wrong. The quiet in my apartment wasn’t peaceful. It was the kind of silence that felt *occupied*.

I caught myself glancing over my shoulder more than once. Just a habit, I told myself. Dream residue. Still, my chest felt tight.

By the time I went to the kitchen to pour coffee, the knot in my stomach was impossible to ignore. My hands were shaking when I reached for the mug, though I couldn’t say why.

That’s when I saw it.

On my desk, across the room, sat my work laptop. The lid was open, the screen glowing faintly.

A single document was open. One sentence filled the page, repeated in neat black letters.

**DON’T TURN AROUND.**
