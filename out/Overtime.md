The building where I worked is very unusual.  When I went in for my first in-person interview, entering the front doorway felt akin to stepping into the mouth of a lion.  The lobby was immense and decorated with geometric patterns, bizarre depictions of man/animal hybrids, large mirrors reaching the ceiling, and a five-pointed star at the center point.  Even more bizarre was the two large lion statues with eagles’ wings, one on each side of the stairway entrance.  Both sitting upright- one holding a spear, the other a short staff with a small pyramid on the end.  Beneath the statues were engraved, 'Hermes' and 'Charon', respectively.  These names I have heard before in a Greek Mythology class I attended at university.  

But there were other words I’ve never seen before- engraved above the main entrance read ‘Phulax-[Sōtērios](https://www.google.com/search?q=s%C5%8Dt%C4%93rios&oq=greek+word+for+keeper+of+souls&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRigATIHCAIQIRigATIHCAMQIRigATIHCAQQIRirAjIHCAUQIRirAjIHCAYQIRiPAtIBCDYzNTJqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&mstk=AUtExfAzn0vFaRzZd09WqFYdEThf5eB8zC2RlSQMQ0p3XKoUgYh0sIay0d-TP7gHt-pApvc2qFxq-XVJf3jid4p1ERdNxM4zVtMn9yPtPtTbgrN3L_LMKOxkMvvGx0K81FznjsIeBu6eMub6RhXbo08Bd8S2G6pX01hYPTUHSh9Ev3B4Wgo&csui=3&ved=2ahUKEwiFg5Pk8ZeRAxW_1fACHdAmNuIQgK4QegQIAhAF)*’**.*  One of my coworkers told me it meant ‘collective’ in Latin or something.  Phulax is the name of the company, so I didn’t pay it much mind then, I thought the building was an old Masonic temple, with its checkerboard floors and weird geometry on the walls. 

*--*  

*I attended a couple mandatory workshops at a local high school auditorium before my first day. The founder and president- an interesting ‘Wizard of Oz’ type of individual- hosted the workshop and spoke at length about God knows what, I kept falling asleep it was so boring.  I recall other attendees leaving the workshops looking perplexed, like they were swindled, their time wasted; they exited and never returned.  I did wonder if I missed something crucial during those long lectures, or if this was just a scam job, but I stayed, despite the weirdness of it all.  Besides, once I was assigned a cubicle and began doing my thing, it was just like any other job.  Clock in, clock out, sleep, repeat…* 

*--*

There were “gatherings” held every 4 months at a different location, far from the High School, next to a temple at the edge of town that contained a large, sprawling lawn; it was magnificent. I attended each one, although these were not mandatory for the whole staff. 

They were enjoyable when the nobody was speaking on the small stage, giving the staff time to mingle in an environment away from the tomb (as I called the building, I’ll explain later why).  It was at one of these gatherings that I met Sandy, my future office crush.  Even though there was an air of mystery about this company, I embraced it.  After meeting Sandy, I coveted it. 

I felt a sense of belonging I haven’t felt ever at a job before this.  The first few months were challenging, but I received an excellent review at the end of the trial period.

*I was never one to eat in the break room, I preferred to go into town for lunch if I wasn’t eating at my desk.* 

*One autumn afternoon I overheard two women talking about the building during lunch at the local diner, conveniently located across the street with a front row view of the tomb…* 

*“I heard it used to be a mental asylum, and it’s haunted...  It’s a tomb!” one woman said aloud.  That last word caught my attention.*

*Her friend interjected, “No, no, no, it was never an asylum.  That building existed here before the town did, that is what my grandmother told me; it was abandoned.  But she warned me to never, ever step inside.”* 

*We all stared at the mysterious building, the concrete and stone exterior blended seamlessly with the overcast, grey sky, very ominous and foreboding.  Gargoyles appeared to dance along the top ledge of the building, a large owl in the center.  A bolt of lightning revealed a structure on top of the building I didn’t notice before, a glass pyramid.*

*--*

At those early workshops I may have missed something I could have shared with the two women; the bizarre statues, symbols and mythological names, I really wasn’t sure what this place was.  Especially the hallway on the north wing with the copper plated door- we were told only the ‘Illuminated Ones’ could enter, that piqued my curiosity.  What is in there?  I had to find out, so I waited until most of the staff left early on a Friday. 

A small copper plate read, 'DO NOT ENTER', but of course I peeked when nobody was around.  Surprisingly, it opened, not locked, revealing a long, dimly lit hallway with portraits of former heads of the company adorning the walls.  At the end of this hallway was another door, this one labeled BASEMENT, but with another five-pointed star above the word in a circle, like the one on the lobby ceiling.  I opened the door, but it didn’t lead to any basement, it was another half floor of private offices and meeting rooms.

In the center of the floor was a tall gold statue of what appeared to be an eyeball with birds wings coming out from the center in a strange pattern.  I felt compelled to touch it, it was so beautiful.  The center of the eye looked like polished obsidian.  And to the right of the statue was a door *with* *my name on it*.

I opened the door, the room was empty save a small leather couch, a desk chair & desk, and a coat hanger; but very polished and clean.  On the walls were four large mirrors facing each other, one on each wall.  For a moment I was transfixed by the mirror effect, viewing myself frame by frame, growing smaller into the infinite, until one of the reflections stepped to the side, out of the trail- it resembled me, but covered in gore and maggots, rotting.  I appeared dead…  

The figure opened its mouth agape and shouted “Gooooooooo! Now!!!!” in a booming, reverberated voice, then the jaw fell off, the right side released itself from the skull first before the left, then the figure crumbled into dust and bones. 

I tailed it out of there; my heart racing.  I was exploring an area I should not be in. 

I paused outside in the hallway to catch my breath when Fred, our building custodian, came walking down the hall.  

“Hey James, whatchoo doin’ here man.” he asked, looking at me sideways. 

“Oh, thank God it’s you. I’m lost, trying to find the president’s office” I lied.

“Oh, he never even comes here. You should know that. Besides, that door goes to the basement.” 

That was a lie too (either that or Fred has never been down to the basement) which would be odd since he’s the building custodian.  To change the subject, I asked him if he could get me some party favors, Halloween was coming up and I wanted to *party*.  I should mention Fred was my office connect for that kinda stuff, not yet a real friend, but I was relieved it was him and not somebody else catching me in that hallway.

“Let’s take a walk man, I need something for this Halloween party in town, you should come.” I told him. 

And he did come to the party- his costume was ‘custodian coke/molly dealer,’ he left the party as ‘custodian with pockets full of cash’*.*

*--*

*I recalled something the president said at the final workshop lecture…* 

*Before exiting the stage, he said, “Employees who work for Phulax, stay with Phulax.  Think about it, the future is in your hands, my friends, consider becoming an ambassador to the sacred mysteries of time, and beyond. Good luck, everyone, but pray you never enter The Duat!” then he stepped away from the lectern and into the darkness behind a large curtain.  Wizard of Oz indeed.* 

*A collective sigh was heard as everyone filed out of the auditorium; well nearly everyone, me and some others just sat there confused; what the hell is “The Duat”, and sacred mysteries of time?  I had my doubts until the first day I started working, and I liked it, despite the witchy-poo stuff this guy was spouting.*

I worked there as a content editor and creator, mainly creating pamphlets for vacation packages to exotic lands (that’s the best I can describe it, “Illumination Retreat - Syria” was the name of one, weird stuff, but I think it was my vivid illustrations that landed me the job so that’s what I do). And I did good work without complaining (or asking what the hell these vacation packages really were about).  I was a model employee, and I could sense something was brewing among the management team- a promotion. 

Relayed to me one afternoon in early November- my secret office crush, Sandy, whispered there was an open position on the table, and she thinks it’ll be offered to me.  A wave of excitement washed over me, I’ve wanted this, and a higher salary was very appealing. 

But something about this made me uneasy.  Here, my office crush and co-worker, who has worked for the company a good five years longer, is telling me I’m getting promoted, which I imagined would hurt her feelings.  She works in the same department, and I cruised right on in and was taking that promotion away from her.  She is an older, but still very attractive woman, tall, and does excellent work.  But like everything else that happens here, I don’t believe anything until I see it.  Like the one woman at the diner who said this building was haunted- in four years I never heard one employee say anything related to ghosts or paranormal activity. *Well except that one time I wandered where I shouldn’t…*

\--

My promotion was announced the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, the staff even threw a surprise party for me, concluding with a toast from the management team.  Most people went home after that, some stayed and continued partying. 

It all made sense now.  That was my new office I discovered, I just didn’t know it. 

“Congratulations, my brother.” Fred said before giving me a brotherly hug.  “Now don’t go and fuck it up.” He said looking me dead in the eyes. 

“I can’t believe I made it this far.” I joked.  We clinked glasses, then Fred walked away.  I took this opportunity to explore my new “office” again. 

With most of the staff gone, there was nobody around to see me enter the DO NOT ENTER doorway.  

Inside my office there was now a framed portrait of me on the wall across from the desk.  “Employee of the Month – James George Bundy - November 2025”.  The mirror effect in the room was still present, but I was not scared this time.

I took the frame off the wall carefully and placed it on the desk.  I don’t know, something about the photo seemed off- *I am not this good looking*.  The image was smooth as the mirrored surface it was adhered too.  The frame was made of polished granite and gold; it was extraordinary and unusual.  There were markings engraved on the back of the frame in a language I was not at all familiar with.  If I were to guess it would be a form of Hieroglyphics. 

I closed the door, pulled out a small bag and short straw from my upper pocket, then cut a large line of Fred’s high-quality coke using my Phulax company Discover card.  I placed the straw on the frame and leaned back in my new office chair.  I liked this. 

Then Sandy opened the door, unannounced, causing me to jump up. 

“Congratulations on being E-O-T-M, Jim.” she said, then paused, “Oh, what’s that you got there?” looking down at the straw.  Shit, I should have put it back in my pocket with the baggie. 

She picked it up and motioned with her eyebrows a ‘do you have any more?’ glance.  Relieved and somewhat excited, I cut out two more large lines.  My heart rate skyrocketing: I longed for a moment like this.  

Sandy did her line then went to the break room to mix a couple drinks for us.  Upon returning, she handed me a large pressed pill with ‘Tesla’ imprinted on it. I swallowed it down with a glass of whiskey, then Sandy and I made out leaning on the desk, then onto the couch. 

I have *never* felt this good; the whole experience was surreal.  Eventually we finished the blow, and I fell asleep in in Sandy’s arms.  We didn’t have sex, but I was in heaven.  She placed another pill into my mouth, I’m not sure what it was but the relaxation that followed was extreme; I fell blissfully asleep shortly after, having the most vivid dream… 

\--

*I was following two paramedics wheeling out a gurney with a white sheet covering a body down a long hallway.*

*I shouted to them, “What happened??”* 

*My legs felt like lead beams trying to keep up with them.* 

*One paused for a moment, turned back, then continued pushing the gurney, shaking his head.  When I followed them outside, I was not outside, but back in my office again.  I turn to the doorway and see a light illuminating the hallway, growing brighter, revealing someone I haven’t seen in a very long time, my grandmother.  My grandmother is dead.* 

*She said, “Come with me, James, come with me right now, James, please!  You must come right now!!” reaching out her hand.*

*Seeing the image of my grandmother was terrifying, even though in life she was the most generous, loving grandmother anyone could wish for.  I truly wondered when I’d wake up, which was frightening in itself- being aware of your predicament and unable to do anything about it.  I glanced again at the EOTM frame- it compelled me to gaze at it- which I did not want to.* 

*Again, one of the mirrored images of myself waved to me in a frightening display, my/his arms motioning me quickly to go, go, go, now!  I turned away towards the door, my grandmother is no longer there, but instead a tall figure wearing a wide brimmed, ornate hat, holding a staff.  The being opened its mouth, but no words were spoken.  Oh, how I wanted so badly for this dream to end and hold Sandy again.  Then finally, the dream ended.*

*--*

I’m sitting in my office chair.  Sandy enters the room.

“Sandy!” I shouted, “Oh my god, you are not going to believe the dream I just had!”

She didn’t seem to hear me or notice me.

“Take it and put it in the basement with the others.” Sandy instructed two men who followed her into the office.  One of them was Fred.

“Fred!  It’s me, man.  Help me!” I shouted.

“Yes, High Priestess Hathor.” he replied to Sandy without noticing my cry for help.  They carried my portrait out to a cart in the hallway.  I followed them into the freight elevator, then down to the basement.  I’ve never been down here before.

The men placed my frame alongside a stack of similar ones leaning against a wall.  One of them I recognized was a former employee and EOTM in April who resigned suddenly, Bob.  I liked Bob and never understood why he resigned shortly after his promotion.  

We were in what appeared to be a shrine, with a large sarcophagus-looking box in the center, black candles in ornate candlesticks were scattered about, burning brightly, some were red.  Inside the sarcophagus were dozens of dead roses and stems.

Sandy proclaimed, “You will spend an eternity down here, you stupid fucker!!  You failed!!  And you placed your hands on the Angel of Fire! *You will encounter psychopomp!!*” 

Then she spit on the floor three times. 

The dim light from the freight elevator revealed Sandy in full robe and headdress with gold lattice covering the brim.  She chanted a couple sentences with her eyes closed.

“In sacrata penetrālia ausus es intrāre; ob hoc nefandum scelus poenam sempiternam damnāris!!” 

She motioned to Fred and the other man it was time to go.  They turned off the lights, then stepped onto the freight elevator.

As the elevator door shut, a cacophony of chattering voices filled the void.  Like an AM Radio station broadcast from the bowels of Hades, a choir of madness escalated into a chorus of agonizing, pleading voices, begging to be released.  The grinding sound of the freight elevator diminished, leaving me alone in my new, un-quiet surroundings. 

*One by one,*

*The candles burned brightly like the sun,*

*They dimmed until there remained only one,*

*Then, there were none.*
