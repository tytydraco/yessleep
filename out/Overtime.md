This is a story of a time when I was almost killed at my work. A horrifying experience that caused me to leave the apartment I used to live in. The apartment that I lived in for several years. In the city of crime, terror, and territorial wars between different streets. This story is one I rarely tell because I have gained PTSD from it and don’t like remembering it. But I am a survivor and I will tell people to warn them about this place. A terrible place that has ruined many people over the years. I woke up. It’s dark outside and I remember why I even set my alarm for such an early hour. I set my alarm because I have to work overtime. I have to work overtime to pay my bills. To live and to make sure life runs smoothly. I get up and get dressed for work. I eat breakfast. Microwave bacon and toast. My favorite breakfast in the world. My cat walks up to me, therefore I must feed it a treat. I hand it the treat and it eats it out of my hand. I fill his food bowl and give him water as well so that he doesn’t starve or become dehydrated while I am away. I pack my bag and walk out into the nearly pitch black darkness of the stairwell to the main door. There’s a small dim light at the end of each hall and the rest is dark all the way down the stairwell to my apartment. 



I walk down each step with the pounding of my shoes echoing through the entirety of the stairwell. I finally made it down all five floors of stairs. The echoes and sound of pounding stops. The door closes behind me as I walk to the store. I don’t have a car or bike. I don’t even take transportation. I just walk. It’s only about 15 minutes. Therefore, I feel there’s no need for transportation. I walk for 7 minutes before stopping to find that a fire has started in an apartment that’s had a bad history of tragedy. 26 people have died there from several different causes. It’s now basically run by a group of terrible people who sell illegal things and make illegal things. They are known for robbing people on the streets in order to buy things that…well you know. They are terrible and do terrible things. I walk the other 8 minutes and arrive at the store. There was a homeless man sleeping outside. He was covered by nothing but a coat and the rest of his clothing. He had a small hat sitting out in front of himself and beneath the brim of the hat was a sign that said “Even the smallest cent is a chance for a new life”. What a poor man. I donated 20 dollars to him and went on my way. 



I walked into the automatic sliding door that opened to my delight. It gets stuck on occasion and we have to go through the back entrance. It’s a nightmare to go through the backdoor because it’s a short walk but there is a massive, rusty, chainmail fence to the back because of people sneaking in and out committing theft and robbery without people noticing that it happened. Climbing that fence was dreadful. At the top were several sharp points of the fence that sometimes caught your uniform and tore it. It also ended up tearing through clothes and into your skin. That meant you had to go through the whole process of getting a tetanus shot which sucks. It only happened once. One poor employee climbed the fence and accidentally fell. The fence cut deep into his skin and all the way down his arm This was luckily something that could be healed and he is still alive today.



I walked into the store and told the first night shift worker that his shift is over. With no response he walks away and out the door. I hate people and society on occasion. People are truly terrible and they do terrible things. With his exit from the store I walked behind the counter and was ready to start work. I stand there and wait for a little while before I decide that I’m bored and can start to stack boxes and fill the shelves with things from boxes in the back. So I unload 1 box and put the things in the box on the shelves of the store. I do another, and another, and another, and another before someone finally comes in. 



An hour and a half of pure boredom and nothingness. A man walks into the store. I ask how I can help him. He asks where the ramen is. I point him to the shelf where the ramen would usually sit. He walks over and tells me there’s no ramen. I walk over there and find that there really isn’t ramen. I thought that I put ramen from boxes to shelves. I guess not. I ask how many cups of ramen this man would like. He says 4 cups of it. So I go to the back and grab 4 cups. I leave the back and walk back out and the man is gone. 



“Hello?” I say. 



I have the ramen in hand and look through the small isles that are impossible to hide in. The freezers don’t move back. The bell would’ve rang if he’d left. I didn’t think anything of it since it’s definitely possible for the bell not to ring. Thinking about it he could’ve actually had ramen but he could’ve gotten away with robbery by sneaking into the back behind me. If he did I would just go to the camera footage and see what happened. Thinking that this is possible I go to check the camera’s. 



I go back to where he asked for ramen on the footage and to my surprise there’s nobody there. Nobody is talking to me. I’m standing alone in the place talking to nobody. I then hear a bell coming from the front. It’s not the bell from the door but the bell for service. I check the camera in its current state. There’s nobody at the counter. I hear the bell ding again. There still isn’t anyone there. I run out to the main part of the store and there is someone standing at the bell.



 “Well can I get some service around here?!” he asks. 



“Yes, sorry, I’m having a weird night.” 



“I honestly don’t care, where is the dog food at?”



“aisle 2 sir.” 



“There isn’t any dog food in aisle 2?” 



“No, I’m pretty sure that I restocked that earlier.” 



“Well I guess you didn’t because there’s none there” 

“Let me check the back, just stay there.” 



“Okay, be quick.” 



I run to the back and find dog food. I sprint back out to the main part of the store. The man is gone. 



“What?” 



I go to the cameras and run it back to right before I leave the counter. There’s nobody standing there. I am talking to the air again. 



“Why is this happening?” 



I run back out to the lobby and see someone standing outside the door. It’s a figure barely taller than me but it’s wearing a black sweatshirt, back pants, black socks, and slick black shoes. I opened the door for him. He walks past me like I’m not even there. He walks up to the counter and rings the bell. I begin to walk to the place behind the counter. He rings it again. I stand behind the counter. He rings the bell again. 



“Can I help you sir?” 



He rings the bell again. 



“Yes sir, I hear you, how can I help you?” 



He rings the bell and keeps his finger on it. He rings again, taking his finger off instantly. He rings it two more times after that, keeping his finger on it both times, then takes his finger off it. He rings the bell 1 time. He then rings the bell 4 times with a constant pace. The man is using morse code. I luckily know some morse code. The man has just spelled out “Yes” in morse code. 



“How can I help you?” 



He spells the question “Do you know death?” 



“What is happening?” 



He spells  “You just have to wait” He then leaves. I am confused and scared. I go back and check the cameras. In the footage, the man is actually standing there. The person isn’t invisible. He is actually standing there. I’m actually talking to someone this time. This was a real person. I walk into the main part of the store. The light is off. I turn the lights back on. I walk away. The lights then turn back off. I flick the light switch, and the lights stay off. 



“What is happening?!”

 

The person walks back up the door and slams his head against it. He continues to smack it over and over. Another person walks up and does the same thing. Another person walks up and does the same thing. The glass cracks. I back up and walk into the back. I ran to a hiding spot in the back. It’s a small space where there is a hole in the wall in case there was ever a tornado. It leads to the basement and can easily be hidden with boxes. The glass break goes off upstairs and this rings in the basement. I walk to the system and turn off the glass break alarm. I begin to cry. I turn around after disarming the alarm and find that there is a crowd of people in cloaks. They’re not doing anything. They’re just standing there. 



“What do you want from me?!” I scream with fury. 



“You drag the blade upon yourself. You drag the blade upon yourself. You drag the blade upon yourself. You drag the blade upon yourself. You drag the blade upon yourself. You drag the blade upon yourself. You drag the blade upon yourself. You drag the blade upon yourself. You drag the blade upon yourself. ” 



With each muttering of the phrase the air seems to become thinner. The voices are getting louder. Louder. Louder. I stand there fearful. I don’t know what’s happening. The lights turn off and a small light from the hole in the wall beams into the basement where one of the men is visible. The chanting stops.  A man with a dark cloak stands in the light. A single beam as if Jesus Christ himself stood before me. 



“Oh god!” I scream at the top of my lungs.



The lights turn on and the crowd of people disappear. I look around the room in complete disbelief. I ran up the stairs. It’s perfectly fine. It’s peaceful. There’s someone shopping. Just looking around. There’s someone at the counter. It’s one of the guys in a black hooded jacket, a black shirt, black dress pants, black socks, black shoes. I walked up to the counter. I looked the man directly in the eye and said, 



“Why are you doing this to me?” 



He doesn’t respond to me. He puts a post-it note down on the counter in front of me. The note says, “You are wasting away. Slowly but surely. You are wasting away. You have stepped through the gates of hell but you can return back to the way it was before this. Before you did what you did. Go away and never return. Why do you do such terrible things to yourself? I see your scars. How dare you drag the blade upon yourself.” A penny sat atop the post-it note.  I look up and the hooded figure has disappeared. I begin panicking. I grab my things and I leave this place. This terrible place. I go home. I get my cat and pack my bags and I leave the town. Never to return. 



This happened to me a year ago and I felt as though those of you should know. I thought about it for a while after. My ultimate belief in what it all meant was that I was wasting my life. I’m afraid of many things. Being alone is the scariest thing in the world. I sit there and think about why this happened. The depression and anxiety increases along with my hallucinations. They get worse, and my life grows scarier. We know not who we are until we’ve been alone and been with our thoughts. The annoying and rude parts of our thoughts. The ones questioning where things are. The one questioning where thoughts go when they mysteriously disappear. The thoughts that tell us things that scare us. The parts that want us to secretly be alone. A mind full of fear about what could happen next. A fear of what being alone is.
