The MIRV missile, traveling at approximately 18,000 miles per hour, split into 24 thermonuclear warheads 500 miles above the earth.

Air defenses were taken by surprise and could only intercept 10.

The rest continued through the atmosphere until they were 3000 feet from the ground.

Directly above a large metropolitan area.

Time stretched out into infinity.

Four billion years of life on Earth had led to this moment.

Silence.

Detonation.

Blinding light.

The moment was over.

On the screen, I watched in utter terror as waves of nuclear hellfire annihilated millions of people in the blink of an eye.

They were turned to ash.

Erased from existence.

Gone.

No one could speak as we watched the news on the television hanging over the bar. Pint glasses slipped from numb fingers and shattered on the floor. Anyone who had been standing lost control of their legs, falling to their knees.

I was paralyzed. My heart had stopped. I couldn't think. I couldn't breathe.

I could only watch.

I could only watch, as a city was wiped off the face of the Earth.

*This isn't real,* I thought.

Mushroom clouds were forming on the screen.

*This isn't happening.*

I was in denial. I was in a living nightmare.

The silence in the bar was broken when someone next to me started screaming.

Chaos.

Shouting. Wails of despair. Frantic voices yelling into phones. Shell-shocked, empty stares. Vague shapes running out the door.

It was all a blur to me.

I was still trying to accept what was happening when the next city was hit.

And the next city.

And the next.

Nuclear warheads fell from the sky like rain. They outnumbered my tears.

It was the end of the world.

The news cut out.

The bar exploded around me and everything went black.

---

When I climbed out of the rubble, all that met me was devastation. Obliteration.

Collapsed buildings, tossed cars, broken fire hydrants spraying water, trees stripped of branches, dead bodies. I numbly catalogued what I was seeing as I took it all in.

It seemed that World War Three ended shortly after it began. There probably wasn't much of a world left to war over.

Our small rural town had only caught the edge of one of the bombs, which is why I didn't instantly die. The town, however, did not share my luck. It was now a wasteland.

I was in a trance. It was a nightmare. A nightmare that wouldn't end. I had to wake up.

I didn't react as I watched two people fighting near a car. The car door was open and both of them wanted it. I calmly observed as one of them pulled out a gun. I wondered what they were saying. The unarmed one was holding up his hands.

A gunshot snapped me out of it, and I ran.

---

A dead man, impaled by splintered wood, was on the ground next to his mostly intact truck. He had filled the bed with gas cans, water, and food. He could have survived for a long time if he had been five seconds faster.

Trying not to think about it, I pried open his fingers to take the keys, then drove his truck out of town.

My family lived in a major city, a hundred miles away. They were the only thing on my mind. I knew what had probably happened to them, but I clung to a desperate hope that they had made it out.

---

I had always loved nature. The trees, the plants, the animals, all of it. That feeling you get when you're alone in the woods and you just stop for a moment, close your eyes, breathe in, listen, and feel the *life* all around you. Like you're an honored witness to the ancient glory of the living world.

So as I drove through the barren, lifeless landscape of what used to be a lush forest, something died in me.

Pitiful, shredded twigs were all that remained of the trees. I could no longer enjoy the songs of the birds, because there were no birds left to sing. There was no greenery anywhere. There was no life anywhere.

Everything was dead.

---

*Please let them be alive,* I thought. *Please let them be alive.*

Once I passed the next curve in the road, I would see the city.

I was not doing well—mentally—after driving through the dead forest. I needed something good to happen. Just a bit of luck.

Maybe the city didn't get hit? Maybe only a part of it was hit, and my family had survived?

I was hoping to see survivors. Some kind of camp, with people cooking food, playing music, or telling stories.

My family would be waiting for me there. I would be able to join them and share what I had in the truck. We could mourn our doomed planet together. Share the burden of grief.

I was praying as I passed the curve.

My knuckles were white on the wheel.

The city was revealed to me.

---

I stood next to my family's house. Or roughly in that area.

It was hard to tell, because everything was ash.

No people, anywhere. No signs of them. No fires, no camps. No survivors.

There was nothing but ash, as far as the eye could see.

It got all over me, but I didn't care.

Isn't ash to be expected in the apocalypse?

Isn't ash to be expected in Hell?

---

I drove to an outer part of the city where things that resembled buildings still existed.

I wasn't sure what I was doing there. It didn't matter. I just got out of the truck and walked around.

Every building was a breath away from collapsing. Objects that may have been cars littered what was left of the streets. It was impossible to tell that people had lived there at all.

There was no noise. Dead silence, as I walked through a dead world.

What was I going to do now? Keep looking for survivors? For my family?

They might have escaped before the city was destroyed. It was possible.

Where would they have gone? In what direction?

---

I was so lost in my thoughts that I almost missed the door.

I had been wandering around, trying to build up the motivation to get back in the truck and drive somewhere else, when a metallic glint caught the corner of my eye.

I turned to look.

There was a featureless black door set into a crumbling wall. It was metal and had a bone-white handle.

What was immediately interesting about the door was that it looked completely undamaged. It should have been a lump of scrap on the ground from the nuclear blast. It was impossible for it to look like that. Unless...

*Are there survivors in there?* I thought as I walked up to it. The only explanation I could think of was that someone had recently set it up.

I ran my hands across its smooth, metal surface. Hardly any ash was sticking to it.

I knocked on the door and waited. No answer.

I grabbed the handle and turned it. "HELLO?" I shouted through the dark opening. "IS ANYONE IN THERE?" No answer.

Something felt off about the other side of the door, but it couldn't have been worse than the wasteland surrounding me.

After a moment's hesitation, I stepped in.

---

I closed the door behind me to keep the ash out and started to take in my surroundings.

I was in an abandoned building, but it looked like it was in much better-

Adrenaline suddenly raced through me.

*When I closed the door.*

*It disappeared.*

As my brain finally processed what had happened, I whirled around.

The door was gone.

All that remained was an old brick wall. I ran my hands over the bricks to make sure I wasn't seeing things.

I wasn't. It was *gone*.

*What just happened?* I thought, bewildered.

I took a moment to calm down. It wasn't too big of a deal. I wasn't trapped. I would just leave the building and circle around to see if the door was gone on that side, too.

I started walking through the building, looking for a way out.

As I peeked into rooms, I noticed how preserved everything was. It was incredible. Stuff was still destroyed, but it was more of a "forgotten for a hundred years" destroyed than a "hit by a nuclear blast" destroyed. I could touch things and they wouldn't disintegrate into a cloud of ash.

I saw light from a doorless exit and I made my way there.

As I approached, I saw that the sun was shining a bit brighter than it had before.

It was almost as if-

---

I dropped to my knees after I stepped outside.

I dropped to my knees on *grass*.

*What?* I thought, stupidly. *What?*

The city stretched out in front of me. Trees. Grass. Buildings. Cars. People.

Life.

The silence was gone. Sounds of the city filled my ears. I could hear birds singing in the trees.

It was like the desolation of ash I had just walked through was an illusion.

Was I dead? Was I dreaming a cruel dream?

I slapped myself. Hard. A puff of white dust drifted off into the fresh air.

I wasn't dead. I wasn't dreaming.

It was real.

Tears mixed with ash as they rolled down my face. I sat there for twenty minutes, just taking it all in.

*Where did that door take me?* I wondered, confused. *Where is this? Is my family here?*

Another question occurred to me.

I frowned. My happiness was turning into dread.

A terrible suspicion had crept into my mind.

I got up and started walking toward a public park nearby.

---

I approached a stranger in the park.

I must have looked like a psycho—wild-eyed and covered in ash—because he seemed about to run when he noticed me.

Before he could flee, I asked him a question.

He answered, then quickly went on his way.

*He's lying,* I instantly thought. *He lied to me.*

Fear flickered in my mind.

I walked up to another person and asked the same question.

I got the same answer.

Fear turned to horror. I started shaking.

*No,* I thought, begging it not to be true. *Please, no.*

After I had asked a third person and received the same answer, I went further into the park and laid down in the grass. My legs were no longer working.

Horror had become terror. A familiar terror, that I had never wished to experience again. It seized me.

My heart was ripping out of my chest. My vision was blurry as I wept tears of despair.

I curled up into a pathetic ball. My breath caught in my throat. I felt like I was going to throw up. Like the first bomb had dropped again.

I was back in the nightmare.

The question I had asked was:

*"What is today's date?"*

---

I'm in the past.

I don't know who launched the first missile. I don't know why it was launched. It came suddenly, with no warning.

World War Three is going to happen again. Life on Earth will become ash and memory.

No one will believe me. I have no proof.

I can't stop it.

Soon, all of us will be there.
