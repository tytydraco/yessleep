I am writing this as a way to vent about my situation.  My name is Micheal, about a month ago I decided to start living in my car as a means of saving money.  My car was a decent size, and me and my dog Cicero could fit in there comfortably.  Cicero is a medium size, and intimidating at first sight.  I was so hopeful until it all went downhill.

I should probably start this off by giving you all the run-down on why I'm doing this.  My lease had just ended at the apartment I was in and the manager, who all of sudden thinks he's some French Aristocrat, decided to up my rent to almost $2000 a month.  Needless to say, minus some unsavory dialogue, I rejected the lease and moved into my car.  I decided to throw out all the non essentials and bring my dog with me.  Once everything was out I left my keys at his desk, flipped him the bird, and went off to start a new life.

My first week was great, I got everything set up.  I bought some battery powered clip-on fans, some privacy shades, rain guards, and a small solar charged generator.  I found some neat rest stops in my town and hunkered down.  After I settled in I started doing food delivery to pad my income.  This was going great, and I was excited to be independent.

Week two is when things got bad.  I had no idea that the town I was in had ordinances against a nomad like me.  The rest stops I was staying at noticed my frequency and have started telling me to leave.  I looked online and found that if Im particularly stealthy I could hide in a neighborhood, sadly this resulted in a visit from the cops.  After this I had taken to store parking lots, this was the final straw.  The police, knowing now who I am and what I drive told me I need to leave town.  I told them my situation and they said they would cite me for vagrancy if I didn't leave.  So that night I left town and went towards the city. 

Before I continue, the town I was in was small.  Not like, everyone knows each other small but small enough that people who don't “belong” stand out.  Unfortunately that meant me.  It was a safe place, and I felt uneasy having to venture into the unknown.  I've been to the city a few times and frankly, it's density lends to a dubious reputation.

My third week in and I was ejected from the town I lived in for 2 years.  This was looking worse by the day.  I entered the city on Sunday afternoon.  I took my dog for a walk at a park and noticed that the air was thick.  You could almost feel it on your skin.  I noticed all the cars and people rushing by.   I supposed it wouldn't be too bad and that barely anyone would notice me. My first few nights were noisy, I found a rest stop that assured me they have 24hr parking.  Sadly this was next to a highway in a mid-town area.  All I could hear all night were cars and trucks coming and going.  I eventually slept, waking up to the sound of patrons entering the place. 

I decided to take down my shades and get some breakfast. The rest stop had a diner that had an almost 50s esthetic.  As I was ordering I asked the waitress if there were any place in the city I should avoid. “The West-Side” she told me, “That part of town is thick with crazies.” “Duly noted, thank you.”  After eating I went back to my car and decided to go to the park again.

As I was walking Cicero I scrolled on my phone and looked at job ads in the city. Nothing really popped out at me until I looked at my delivery app.  The city was lit up with orders.  I hopped in the car and went to it, I delivered all throughout the day, driving for hours and hours well into the night.  My last delivery was at 4 in the morning and the address was taking me deep into this wooded area.  I looked at my GPS on my phone and saw that I had driven pretty far into the “West-Side” of town.  

When I got to the house I made my way to the door.  I knocked and waited and waited but no one answered.  I tried calling and waited and waited but no one answered.  I sat at this dude's house for at least an hour trying to get him his food.  After sticking around I decided to go back to the car.  What I saw scared the hell out of me.  My rear driver side was opened and Cicero was nowhere to be found.  I look around but it's too dark to see.  I close the door and get in my car.  I am scared shitless, I love Cicero and not having my companion there made things all the worse.

Suddenly I felt a small pinch in my neck, my hairs stood up and I felt a wave of paranoia wash over me.  Someone was watching me.  I couldn't see anything but I could feel them.  I started my car and made it down the road, where I saw Cicero limping down the street.  I got him in the car and looked at him, someone hurt his leg. I began to flee the area and as soon as I started to feel safe I came across a gut wrenching scene.  In the road were cement barriers, it was not a dead end street I could see the road ahead.

I was shaking as I tried turning around and as soon as my lights hit the street someone was standing there blocking me.  He was big, masked up, and carrying a giant knife.  Out of the corner of my eye I see a black figure swoop up to the car, I lock it on instinct.  The man at my door was wearing a similar outfit and dragged a massive blade across my window.  I am now frozen with fear and hyperventilating.

“I would open this door if I were you.” The man said.  “If I have to break this window it'll be so much worse for you.”

I didn't know what to do, “I-Im not opening my door.” My reply was shaky.

The man cocked his head “Suit yourself, we were gonna let the dog live, too.”

He began swinging at my window and the guy who was standing in the street began running towards me.  I floored the gas and sped off as quickly as I could.  I eventually found my way back to the main city.  I went to a police station and reported what had happened.  The officers there told me it was common occurrence and that I was lucky to be alive.  I swore not to go near that area again. Part of me wanted to leave the city and move on to another.

I couldn't sleep at all that morning and when day came I headed to the diner and filled up on coffee.  The day brought an uneasy peace, and I could start feeling the experience from last night washing away, until I heard a familiar voice.

“You got lucky last night, kid.”

Petrified, I slowly turned around to see a tall man, thinning brown hair and tattoos on his neck and face. He looked at my car outside, and told me to keep my mouth shut or he'd find me and hack me to pieces. The man left the diner, I saw him stop at my car and write my plate number down. He looked back and, seeing me watching him, slapped his notepad against the hood of the car and shot at me with a finger gun.


I decided that night I was leaving town.  Most of the day I spent in public until about 8pm where I stopped at a convenience store, filled up on gas and got some snacks for the road.  I got to my car and when I got in I noticed the man from the diner standing by the gas pumps.  I floored it out of there.

As I was driving I saw behind me a car.  No lights on except for the dim running lights and some interior lights. This psycho-fucker was following me and the further away from the city I got things would get darker and more remote.  At this point I had a decision to make.  Do I try running or should I fight?

I made the decision in a split second as I floored the brakes and spun around, I collided with his driver side fender and sent him flying off the road, I went into a nearby ditch.  I opened my door to make it look like I ran, grabbed Cicero and hid in the floor behind my driver's seat. It was pitch black down there and I could barely see the windows above me.

I sat for what felt like hours, and could hear the man walking around my car.  I heard his footsteps stop outside the rear driver side door and when I looked up I could see him glaring inside, blood from the crash on his teeth as his mouth contorted into a grimace.  He looked around, tapping on the window with his knife.

After an eternity of sitting I heard him run into the woods.  I gave it a second before bolting back to the front seat, closing my door and trying to drive off.  Out of the corner of my eye he was running at the car as I put her in drive and floored it, leaving the ditch and flying down the road. I looked in the rear view and saw him standing there, he threw down his knife and starting pacing.

The rest of the week I drove as far as I could, stopping in several towns for sleep.  I made a plan to go somewhere south.  I'm still in my car but I'm in a much safer area.  I'm planning on getting an apartment again soon, because fuck being vulnerable to the world like that.  My first and last month living in the car ended in a hellish experience I'll never forget.
