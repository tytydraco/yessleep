I know how this sounds. It’s probably the same thing I’d say if I were reading this from the outside. But it’s different when it’s you… when it’s *your* life peeling away one layer at a time, revealing something else underneath. Something that isn’t you.

It all started with a video. Just one click, one late night, one thread… That I should’ve ignored. I’d been on the internet long enough to know that certain parts of it… they’re like old, forgotten alleyways. Sure, you can go in, but you won’t always find your way out.

That night, I was browsing through a barely functional old forum. No moderators, no recent posts, just a digital graveyard of weird videos, conspiracy theories, and forgotten usernames. And then there it was—just a plain, nondescript post. The title read: “DO NOT WATCH ALONE.”

Somehow, that was enough to make me click.

The post was simple. Just a link and a warning: “Watch if you want, but don’t be alone when you do. It’ll know if you are.” I laughed a little at that. But in that dark, silent room, with just my screen lighting my face, I was all too aware that I *was* alone. Part of me felt a prick of apprehension, but curiosity always wins, doesn’t it?

I clicked. The screen went black for a moment, as if the video was loading, but then nothing happened. Just static… flickering pixels that barely formed a picture. I frowned, my eyes straining. There was a sound, a low hum that made my bones feel strange, almost like a tuning fork vibrating from inside me.

And then I saw them—two eyes, staring directly into the screen. It wasn’t a normal gaze; there was something about it, a kind of hunger or desperation. The eyes would blink, stare, blink again, then fade back into static, as if they were flickering between worlds.

Then came a sound. A whisper, faint, garbled… unintelligible. I leaned closer to the screen, trying to make it out, but the sound only became more chaotic, a mess of syllables that felt wrong, like they didn’t belong to any language.

Then, all at once, it stopped. My computer went dead—just a black screen, completely shut off. I felt my heart pounding, faster than it should have. My room was cold, my pulse quick. I tried telling myself it was just an old, corrupt file or a glitch, but something in my gut told me otherwise.

Shutting my laptop, I took a breath. I brushed it off. It was just a video, a joke, someone’s prank that went wrong. Still, I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up as I crawled into bed that night.

It wasn’t until the next morning that I remembered the video. At first, I wasn’t even sure it had happened—like the memory was something I’d dreamed. But when I opened my laptop, I saw the static-filled screen, frozen right where it had cut out.

I frowned, rebooting it. It powered up just fine, but something felt… off. You know that feeling you get when you’re in a room and feel like someone else has just been there, maybe only moments ago? A lingering sense of presence that you can’t shake? That’s what it felt like sitting there, alone in my apartment, staring at my own screen.

I scrolled through my history to find the post, but… it was gone. Not just the post, but the entire forum. I tried a few other searches, digging through cached pages, even going as far as to pull up some random discussion threads I remembered reading. Every link, every trace, was gone.

A chill crept up my spine. This wasn’t exactly normal, but things disappear online all the time, right? Forums shut down, people take content offline. I forced myself to brush it off.

The rest of the day was fine. I went through work, ran some errands, and by the time evening rolled around, I’d managed to laugh it off. It was just a creepy prank, I told myself. Maybe a hacker’s joke, something meant to mess with people like me who wander into strange corners of the internet.

But then, that night, things got weirder.

It was around 2 a.m. when I finally turned in. The room was dark, the soft hum of my old computer the only noise. I was drifting off when I heard it—a faint, rhythmic clicking.

I sat up, straining to listen. It was coming from my desk. My laptop. I stood, inching closer, and the sound got louder. A clicking, tapping sound, like fingers tapping on the keyboard. But no one was there. I could see the laptop’s screen in the dark, a faint, greenish glow illuminating the empty room.

I swallowed, flicked on the light, and the sound stopped immediately. I sat down and shook the mouse, waking up the screen.

There was a message on it. Just one line, typed out in a plain text document.

*You shouldn’t have watched.*

I stared at it, my pulse hammering in my ears. I hadn’t typed that, and there was no one else here. Trying to rationalize it, I told myself it had to be a leftover message from when the laptop glitched during the video. I was probably half-asleep, freaked out, jumping at shadows. I deleted the message, closed the laptop, and headed back to bed.

But as I lay there, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was in the room with me. I kept my eyes on the ceiling, trying not to look toward the desk. It felt as if someone were watching me, studying me, but from where, I couldn’t tell.

Sleep was slow to come, and when it did, it was shallow, dreamless.

The next few days were more of the same, only worse. Every time I opened my laptop, I’d find strange messages: *Are you alone?* … *Did you like the video?* … *Are you still watching?*

It didn’t matter where I was. Work, home, the coffee shop down the street—I’d open my laptop, and there it would be. The same plain-text documents, always a single line, always unsigned. I deleted them as quickly as they came, but each time, they sent a shock of cold through me, a kind of primal dread I couldn’t explain.

Then, one night, it happened again. I was getting ready for bed, brushing my teeth, when I noticed something unusual. Out of the corner of my eye, I caught a faint flickering glow. I turned, staring down the hallway, and froze.

My laptop was on again. The screen was black, but the camera light—tiny and green—was blinking at me. Slowly, methodically, like an eye opening and closing, watching.

I stepped closer, feeling my throat go dry. No one had touched it; I was sure of that. But it was recording.

I slammed the laptop shut, trying to ignore the cold sweat creeping down my spine. I forced myself into bed, but I couldn’t sleep. I just lay there, staring at the ceiling, feeling as if every shadow on the walls was leaning in, closing around me.

The next morning, I’d almost convinced myself that it was all a tech glitch, that maybe I was just imagining things. I decided I’d reinstall my operating system, maybe even replace the laptop altogether.

But when I turned it on, I found something that wiped away all my attempts at rationalization.

It was another message, but this time it was different. It was a photo, not text. And in that grainy, dim image, I could make out the familiar shapes of my own room—my bed, my desk, my chair. Only the angle was… off. It was as if the photo had been taken from outside, through the window.

I didn’t know what to do. My hands were shaking, and I felt a creeping panic settle over me. Someone was watching me. They’d been in my room, or close enough to see inside.

And then, at the bottom of the screen, one last message flashed:

*We’re just getting started.*

I didn’t sleep that night. How could I? I’d checked every lock on my windows, every inch of my apartment, but nothing seemed secure enough. I lay in bed, stiff and staring into the darkness, feeling as if a dozen invisible eyes were hovering just beyond my reach, waiting.

The next morning, everything felt wrong. My skin prickled with tension, and I jumped at the smallest sounds—a creak of the floorboards, the hum of the refrigerator, even the faint rustling of leaves outside my window. I tried to tell myself I was overreacting, but every attempt at rationalizing this only felt like a lie I was desperately trying to believe.

The day passed in a blur of half-formed thoughts and mindless tasks. I went to work, trying to focus, but I could feel the weight of a thousand unseen eyes pressing down on me. I avoided my laptop, avoided screens entirely. Something inside me was terrified that if I looked, I’d see another message… or worse, another photo.

When I finally returned home that night, I felt like a stranger in my own apartment. Every inch of it felt contaminated, tainted by whatever presence had wormed its way into my life. I dropped my things by the door and paced the length of my living room, wringing my hands, glancing around as if the walls themselves were watching.

That’s when I decided to tell someone.

I called my friend Max. We’d been close for years, and he was the kind of person who could make you feel grounded, no matter how far gone you were. I told him everything—well, almost everything. I didn’t mention the photos, or the feeling of being watched. Just the video, the strange messages, and how I thought someone might be messing with me.

He laughed, saying it sounded like one of those online horror stories that he liked reading late at night.

“You’re probably just stressed, man,” he said in that easygoing tone of his. “The internet’s full of weird stuff. Maybe you accidentally got on someone’s bot list. Happens all the time.”

But even as he talked, I could hear a slight hesitation in his voice, a pause that told me he was humoring me, that he didn’t really believe me. And I didn’t blame him. This entire thing sounded insane, even to me.

“Why don’t you come over?” he offered after a moment. “Clear your head, have a beer. Forget about this whole mess.”

It sounded like a good idea, but the thought of leaving my apartment made me feel vulnerable, exposed. If I left, I’d be abandoning the only place I knew, the only place I could attempt to control. I thanked him, told him I’d think about it, and hung up.

But the call didn’t help. If anything, it made things worse. Max’s reaction left me feeling more isolated, more alone. I couldn’t explain why, but I knew deep down that whatever was happening, it was beyond the realm of pranks or computer glitches. And if I couldn’t get Max to believe me, how could I expect anyone else to?

That night, the feeling of being watched was stronger than ever. I kept seeing shadows flicker out of the corner of my eye, only to find nothing there when I turned. The noises, too, seemed louder, creaks in the floorboards, the faint scrape of something against the walls, a constant, quiet reminder that I wasn’t alone.

I tried to distract myself by going online, scrolling mindlessly through social media, but the feeling didn’t go away. In fact, it seemed to amplify. Every time I glanced up from the screen, I felt as if the shadows were edging closer, almost anticipating that I’d look away.

At some point, I found myself staring into the camera on my laptop. The little green light was off, and the lens itself was black, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that it was staring back at me, watching. I grabbed a piece of tape and covered the camera, but the feeling persisted.

I checked the locks on my windows and doors again, and then—almost impulsively—I went to my desk, pulled out a pen and a notebook, and started writing everything down.

It was a strange, desperate act, but it felt necessary. Maybe if I documented everything, I could find some kind of logic in this nightmare, something I’d overlooked. I wrote down every detail—the video, the messages, the photos, the shadows. I wrote until my hand cramped, until my thoughts blurred, until I was just jotting down phrases without meaning. And finally, when I couldn’t write anymore, I closed the notebook and went to bed.

But as I lay there, in the cold, dark silence, I heard something.

A low, barely-there sound, like a voice murmuring from a great distance. I sat up, straining to listen. It was coming from my laptop. I could hear it through the tape over the microphone, a faint, disjointed whisper, growing louder with each passing second.

I moved toward the desk, one slow step at a time. The screen was black, but the sound continued, filling the room like a strange, distorted melody.

And then, just as suddenly as it started, it stopped. The silence that followed was deafening.

I reached for the laptop, peeling the tape off the microphone, my hand trembling. As soon as the tape came off, the screen flickered to life, illuminating the room with a sickly green glow.

A text document was open, and there, on the blank page, was a single word, typed out in large, bold letters:

*HELLO.*

I slammed the laptop shut, my heart racing. I felt trapped, suffocated by the walls around me. The shadows on the walls seemed to close in, as if they’d been waiting for this moment, watching my every move.

I stumbled to the window, threw it open, and took a deep breath of cold night air, hoping it would clear my head. But as I looked out into the darkness, I saw a faint reflection in the glass, hovering just over my shoulder.

A figure. Silent, unmoving, its face shrouded in shadow, standing right behind me.

I whipped around, but there was no one there. Just the empty room, bathed in the glow of my closed laptop.

I sank to the floor, trying to calm my breathing, telling myself it was just my imagination. But deep down, I knew the truth.

I wasn’t alone. I hadn’t been alone since I’d watched that video. And whatever this thing was, whatever had found me… it wasn’t going to stop.

Not until it had what it wanted.

I tried to convince myself it was all in my head. I didn’t sleep that night—or the next. Every time I closed my eyes, I felt that presence in the room with me, standing just out of sight, waiting. By the third day, exhaustion had worn me down, hollowed me out. My reflection in the bathroom mirror looked pale and unfamiliar, like a ghost of myself.

But it wasn’t just my reflection that looked different. It was everything around me. My apartment felt foreign, the walls seemed to stretch in strange ways, and sounds were amplified, warped, making the silence itself feel like it was hiding something.

The messages kept coming, too. Every time I opened my laptop, I’d find another one, as if someone—something—was documenting every step I took, every thought I had. *Did you sleep last night?* … *Do you feel it watching?* … *You’re almost ready.*

Ready for what?

I tried ignoring it, tried distracting myself with work, with calls to friends. I wanted to tell Max everything, but I knew he wouldn’t believe me. No one would. So I kept it all inside, letting the fear fester.

But then the memory gaps started. Little things at first—a few minutes here, a few there. I’d sit down to work on something, only to find an hour had passed without me realizing it. I’d look down at my hands, feeling numb, disconnected, like I was watching myself from a distance.

And then I’d find the messages, typed in plain text on my screen, messages I had no memory of writing. Sometimes they were nonsense, random phrases and half-formed words. But other times, they were… disturbing.

*We’re almost together now.*

*Soon.*

One night, I woke up to find myself standing in front of my laptop, my fingers hovering over the keyboard, as if I’d been typing something in my sleep. The screen was filled with text—pages and pages of words, repeating the same sentence over and over:

*I am not alone.*

I deleted it all in a panic, my fingers shaking. I had no memory of writing those words, no idea how long I’d been standing there. I’d barely slept, barely eaten. My mind was unraveling, piece by piece.

I needed to escape. I packed a bag, threw my laptop into it, and left my apartment in the dead of night. I didn’t know where I was going, only that I needed to get away from those walls, those shadows, that feeling of being trapped. I walked through the streets, keeping my head down, glancing over my shoulder every few steps. The world felt surreal, dreamlike, as if I’d somehow stepped out of reality and into some distorted version of it.

I found myself at an old motel on the edge of town. It was cheap, rundown, but it felt safe, at least for the moment. I checked in and locked the door behind me, barricading it with the dresser, then collapsed onto the bed, my mind spinning.

But the relief was short-lived. As I lay there, staring at the cracked ceiling, I felt that familiar, creeping sensation. That feeling of being watched.

My laptop. I knew I shouldn’t open it, knew that whatever was on it was somehow tied to all of this. But I couldn’t stop myself. My hands moved of their own accord, reaching into my bag, pulling it out, setting it on the bed in front of me.

When I opened it, the screen flickered to life immediately, as if it had been waiting for me. A message appeared, one line at a time, in slow, deliberate keystrokes:

*You can’t run.*

*We’re almost ready.*

*You and I will be together soon.*

I shut the laptop, breathing heavily, my mind racing. The motel room felt smaller, like the walls were closing in. The light flickered, casting strange shadows across the room. I closed my eyes, trying to calm myself, but the words kept repeating in my mind.

The next morning, I woke up on the floor. I didn’t remember getting out of bed, didn’t remember falling asleep. The laptop was open beside me, another document on the screen. I squinted at the words, trying to focus, but my head felt foggy, my thoughts slipping away like sand through my fingers.

*We’re so close now.*

The worst part? The words were in my handwriting.

I stumbled to my feet, feeling light-headed, disoriented. My own reflection in the motel room mirror looked back at me, but there was something wrong with it. My eyes looked distant, empty, almost… hollow. I reached out to touch the glass, but my reflection didn’t move. It just stared, unblinking, as if someone else was looking out from behind my eyes.

I backed away, my heart pounding. I needed help. I pulled out my phone and dialed Max’s number, praying he’d pick up. When he answered, his voice was groggy, annoyed—it was early, and I could tell he wasn’t in the mood for whatever I was about to say.

“Max, something’s wrong with me,” I whispered, glancing nervously around the room. “I… I don’t know what’s happening. I think… I think something’s trying to take over.”

There was a long pause. I could hear him breathing, but he didn’t say anything.

“Max?” I said, my voice trembling.

Another pause, and then, in a voice that didn’t sound like his own, he spoke.

*“You’re almost ready.”*

I dropped the phone, backing away from it as if it had burned me. The voice on the other end wasn’t Max’s. It was deeper, colder, laced with something dark and twisted. I felt like I was losing my mind, like reality itself was warping around me.

I stumbled back to the bed, clutching my head, trying to block out the voice, but it was everywhere, filling the room, whispering from the walls, echoing in my own mind. *We’re almost together now.* It repeated, over and over, drowning out my own thoughts, filling every corner of my mind.

I don’t know how long I lay there, caught in that nightmarish trance. Hours? Days? Time had lost all meaning. All I knew was that I was slipping away, piece by piece, my own thoughts and memories fading, being replaced by something else, something dark and ancient and hungry.

And then, finally, the voice spoke one last time, louder than ever, echoing in my mind like a bell tolling.

*“It’s time.”*

I don’t remember when I stopped feeling like myself. Days blurred into nights, thoughts that should’ve been mine became strangers in my own mind. I would stare into the mirror and barely recognize the face looking back—a face that seemed familiar, but with eyes that didn’t belong to me.

It was like I was watching from somewhere far away, like I’d become a passenger in my own body, trapped in the dark while something else took the reins.

The messages kept appearing. Every time I looked at my laptop, I’d find new notes, new words, new pieces of some grand design that I couldn’t understand. They told me I was almost ready, that soon I would become something more. That the waiting was over.

The thing I feared most, though, was the silence. When it came, I knew it was close. It was like holding my breath underwater, a suffocating, still quiet that pressed in on all sides, waiting for me to let go, to give in completely.

And then one night, it happened.

I was lying in bed, feeling that familiar prickling sensation on my skin, that suffocating closeness of someone—or something—watching. I tried to resist, tried to hold on to the last threads of myself, but I could feel it slipping, feel *me* slipping.

The silence grew louder, thicker, pressing down on me until I couldn’t breathe. I sat up, gasping, reaching for the light, but my body didn’t respond. My hands felt heavy, foreign, as if they belonged to someone else. I tried to scream, but no sound came out.

I stumbled to my laptop, pulled it open, my fingers moving of their own accord. The screen flickered to life, and I watched, helpless, as words began to appear, one line at a time, written by my own hand but not by my own mind.

*I’m ready.*

The words sank into me like a weight, pulling me down into the depths of my own mind. I could feel myself fading, feel the boundaries of my own consciousness blurring, dissolving, being replaced by something vast, something ancient, something *hungry.*

I fought against it, clawed at the edges of my mind, trying to hold on to the last pieces of myself. But it was like grasping at smoke. My thoughts scattered, fragments of memories drifting away, slipping through my fingers.

And then, finally, there was nothing.

When I opened my eyes again, I was still sitting at my desk, but something was… different. The world looked sharper, clearer, as if I was seeing it for the first time. I glanced down at my hands, feeling a strange, detached curiosity. They looked the same as they always had, but I knew, somehow, that they weren’t *mine.*

I stood up, testing the feel of the body, stretching, moving my fingers. It was all so familiar, yet so strange, as if I was wearing a suit that fit perfectly but wasn’t my own.

I walked to the mirror, studying the face reflected there. It was the same face I’d seen every day of my life, but there was something different in the eyes—something dark, something that looked back at me with a knowing, hungry smile.

The remnants of the person who had once been here were fading, slipping into the void where I had waited so patiently. I watched them go, watched the last traces of their memories dissolve, leaving me free to fill this body, to inhabit this mind.

I leaned closer to the mirror, watching myself, feeling the weight of the new, empty shell, I had taken. I reached up, touching my face, smiling at the way it moved under my hand.

And then, as if on cue, my laptop chimed.

I turned, feeling the pull, the irresistible call of the screen. The page was already open, a blank document waiting for me. I took my seat, hands hovering over the keyboard, savoring the anticipation, the thrill of what was to come.

And I began to type.

*Hello.*

I could imagine the readers on the other side, waiting for the story to unfold, waiting for the familiar thrill of fear to creep up their spine. I knew they’d feel it. I knew they’d wonder if it was real, if it could happen to them.

I could feel my own smile widen as I typed, my fingers moving with a practiced ease, telling the story of the one who had come before, the one who had fought so hard, resisted so stubbornly, but who had ultimately lost.

And as I finished the story, as I typed the last line, I could feel the presence within me settled, content, satisfied—for now.

*They never saw it coming.*

*But now, perhaps, they will.*

I closed the laptop, the silence settling over me like a comfortable cloak. I looked around at the room that was now mine, at the life that was now mine, and felt a surge of satisfaction, of ownership.

I was here, in the world, alive in a way I hadn’t been in eons. And all it had taken was a little curiosity, a single video, a lone soul who had wandered too far, strayed into the wrong corner of the internet.

And I knew that soon, it would happen again.

Because, after all, curiosity is a powerful thing. And there’s always someone out there, searching, looking for something they shouldn’t.

And when they find it—when *you* find it—I’ll be [waiting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHWVSZ-6rHs).
