I used to have night terrors as a child. Not often, but often enough to have a lasting mark on my developing psyche. I don’t really recall all that much of what happened in them. Like a dream so bad your memory rejects outright to recall it, just leaving you with a deep churning dread, like it might have followed you into the waking world.

What I do remember is scarce. I was in the dark, an endless, hollow dark. Not quite pitch black, more like the inverse of one of those white void rooms they use to film music videos in. It felt like it went on forever in every direction. I vaguely remember blurs scuttling across my vision, shapes that seemed to de-coalesce the second I tried to focus on them, but it’s all vague now.

The thing I do recall, and what stayed with and cemented whatever memory I have, carved into my reminiscence like a scar, was the feeling as the pit in my stomach dropped, and the sensation of being shot forward. The world if you can call it that, dissolving around me as I felt myself being dragged forward, then up at an impossible speed. Everything in my vision stretching into smears of grey and black.

I would snap awake, tears pouring down my face, that violent propulsion still rushing through my body, following me into awareness. And for a few awful seconds, I could feel the room around me warp. Objects around me stretching or shrinking, walls breathing in and out, as if I was perceiving everything around me with a pair of binoculars that wouldn’t stop refocusing. Even to the point where I would zoom in to see the whites of my parent’s eyes as they came rushing in to begrudgingly comfort me.

I was a nervous kid, even without the night terrors, and my family life was never particularly stable. We moved around a lot what with my Dad working for the military, and just as we had started settling or I’d started making a rare friend, his work would uproot us and our lives to the next military contract. I’d barely have time to learn the layout of one school before being thrown into another. Speaking of, it felt like he was absent pretty much the entirety of my childhood. He would work until late, and the rare occasions we would go for a family dinner or outing, he would be bombarded with “important” phone calls and have to rush off to wherever to do whatever. I never knew what my Dad even did, and even as I got older and I would enquire all I was told was that he worked for the “research” division, whatever that meant.

My Mum didn’t make matters much better either, I always felt like more of a burden, dead weight. She always seemed to answer me with a sigh before I’d even finished a sentence, responding like she was already tired of me. I was an only child, so I didn’t have anyone to share those feelings with, so of course I grew up thinking those recurring night terrors were just another symptom of a childhood lived on ever shifting ground, like trying to scramble up a gravel slope. It all seemed explainable enough.

The last straw came on my 18^(th) birthday. Obviously, my parents hadn’t planned anything, as much as I was holding out hope for a card, a cake, anything. But I had booked a table for the three of us at a pizzeria not far from us and let them know. My hope being that, as it was a milestone in my life, they would finally make some kind of effort, some sort of concession to celebrate their only child. I went to the restaurant straight after the day shift at a local bar I’d found some work at and waited for them. And waited. 45 minutes passed and, realising they wouldn’t show, I left. Returning home, my Dad’s car was, predictably, not in the drive, and as I passed the living room I saw my Mum, asleep on the sofa, her and the empty wine bottle and half empty pill one on the coffee table illuminated by the glow of the television.

2 weeks later, after ruminating on my current sorry state, and in a state of impulsive self-destruction and teenage angst, I snuck out with a bottle of my Dad’s whisky from his cabinet, the hum of the fridge in the next room the only sound in an otherwise ever silent house. I say snuck out. Dad was at work and was rarely ever present, and my Mum wasn’t exactly checking up on me. I made it to the train tracks close to where we were living that month.

I arrived at the bridge above the train tracks and swung my legs over the edge, screwing open the bottle and started downing the vile brown liquid, gagging as it burned my throat, building up the liquid courage to…you know, waiting for a train to come. I had no friends, or girl in my life. I felt like an unwanted guest in my own home, and no prospects. Inevitably our nomadic lifestyle had an adverse effect on my schooling, and I was bottom of my grade for as long as I can remember and working a dead-end job I hated.

As I felt the tell-tale rumbling of my impending release from a train coming down the tracks, and as I lifted the bottle to my lips for one last gulp, I felt my collar being tugged back. My first thought in that split second before I hit the cold metal of the walkway was that, someone cared. Someone had come to stop me from doing something stupid. But no. It turned out to be a group of other teens my age who I had seen around town, snickering at me as I walked around alone. And they proceeded to kick the shit out of me, leaving me a bloody, crumpled unconscious mess on that bridge.

I woke up the next day in a hospital bed, in the sterile unfamiliar surroundings, the only company an empty chair by the side of the bed. Needless to say, neither of my parents were there waiting for me when I arose. The doctor told me I suffered a mild concussion and three broken ribs. He said I was lucky I didn’t die of hypothermia, as it turned out, some homeless guy saw this happening and chased the hoodlums off, contacting the local police. In that moment I couldn’t help but feel a glum fondness for him, thinking of my ghostly savior as the one person who may actually give a shit about me. I certainly didn’t feel lucky.

I was in the hospital for observation for another 3 days, with the only contact from either parent being a text from my Mum who asked when I would be released and when she should bring me home. She never said a word on the car ride home and, wordlessly, as soon as we arrived, I went to my room, packed a bag of clothes and left. Feeling strangely calm and resolute as I did so. It was inevitable, really. She just stood at the door watching me walk down the road, she didn’t say anything, and I didn’t look back.

I had a little money saved from my bar gig, and they agreed to keep on me on full-time. From there I slept rough for a few weeks before I found a house share down the road from my work. The house was a state, mismatched people, mismatched furniture and awkward first impressions. My room barely had space for a single bed and a wardrobe, with peeling wallpaper and the tell-tale sign of mold in the ceiling of the corner opposite the bed. But as time passed, I felt something I never felt I had before, a kinship. These people who I had never met became the most important people in my life, my first real connection. It grounded me and made me realise how stupid I had been. I allowed myself to forget, or begin forgetting at least, that part of me that felt un-moored, and let myself just belong.

For a while, things felt normal, I had my routine. I would usually work till close, picking up as many shifts as I could. I’d bring home food from work the kitchen would have leftover, and me and my motley crew would sit on the floor or patchwork sofa watching whatever new show was on the subscription service we all shared a login for. It wasn’t much. It wasn’t anything, but it was, normal. It was perfect.

One day though, I found myself in that empty space again. I had been off sick with a nasty flu the last few days which had left me delirious, and also in that dark expanse as I closed my eyes. I hadn’t been here for years, and only ever remembered being here the moment I arrived. This time felt different though. Where before, the shapes I saw moved to and fro outside the confines of my vision, now they were still. These impossible shapes which seemed to warp as I looked at them, all of varying sizes were just standing there. As I took in more of my surroundings, I realised there were a lot of them all of them turned to face me, tantalisingly just out of my vision to make it any details, cloaked in the gloom. But one thing I could tell though, where before they didn’t seem to notice me, they certainly did now. They were watching me.

I felt my entire body tighten up. A blood curdling chill shot down from the tip of my head and zapped it’s way to my feet and as it did, I felt, not saw the figures launch themselves at me. Instinctively I put my arms up to protect myself, for what little good it would do, when I felt that other old familiar feeling. That one of being shot forward and up at impossible speeds. That one that haunted me so much as a child now apparently coming to my aid.

I jolted awake in bed, my first instinct being grateful that it was all over. My second as I caught my breath, being looking around the room as I watched the walls breathing in and out and items in my room bring themselves to the forefront of my vision. After a few seconds as I gained control of my vision and my breathing, I heard the tell tale sign of my door creaking open. Holding my breath I’d worked so hard to get control of, I felt a bead of salty sweat drip it’s way way slowly down my cheek, keeping pace with the opening of the door. In it stood Tina, one of my housemates leaning against the door-frame. With eyebrows raised she said “Bad dream?”. Nodding, I swung my legs over the side of the bed and rubbed my face in my hands and looked back up at her. “Smoke?” she said, as she motioned to her outstretched hand with a spliff in it, the sickly sweet smell filling the room.

We spent the rest of the night getting high and I regaled her of my dream, or rather terror. I explained I hadn’t had them since I was a kid, but something about being sick had triggered something in my psyche. I explained about the zooming in and out of my vision, and the walls breathing in and out, and we did some stoned research online.

“This sound familiar? Scale distortion, visual hallucinations, that kinda stuff?” Tina said, pointing to an article on her phone as she passed me the joint. Taking a drag, I read the headline. Alice in Wonderland syndrome. Reading on, it described a rare neurological condition, most commonly seen in children. Distorted perceptions of size. Objects appearing larger or smaller than they should be. Macropsia. Micropsia. Clinical words for something that had never felt clinical to me.

“Sounds like the kind of thing an edgy kid who hates their parents and spends too much time on Tumblr would make up,” Tina teased, jabbing me in the ribs with her elbow. We laughed, and I felt more relieved than I cared to admit. There was a name for it. Other people had experienced it. The article described it as benign. I scrolled through a few first-hand accounts, half-expecting to see my own words staring back at me. Most of them were short. Vague. Complaints about headaches. About rooms feeling wrong for a few minutes at a time. None of them mentioned figures lurking at the edges of vision. None of them talked about the sensation of being dragged, hurled forward, like the ground had dropped out from under reality itself.

I told myself that didn’t matter.

I was just glad I wasn’t crazy. Just glad this wasn’t some kind of psychosis.

“Put it this way,” Tina said, pausing to take a long drag, “a lot of people would pay good money for a trip like that. Minus the demon spawn or whatever.” She laughed. “You should do what I do,” she added. “Keep a dream journal by your bed. If it happens again, write it down while it’s still fresh. It can help make sense of it, plus it’s funny reading it back sometimes.”

I nodded, already thinking about how some things, once written down, stop being funny at all.

A couple of weeks passed, and I kept up the journal. There were no more night terrors. No instances of macropsia or micropsia, or whatever the article had called it. Just fragmented dreams about nothing in particular. Mundane impressions of the previous day, or scenes obviously borrowed from a show or movie I’d watched before bed.

Tina and I would sometimes compare notes in the mornings, reading each other’s entries and poking fun at how boring they were. I’d read somewhere that smoking weed dulled REM sleep, the stage where most dreaming happened, so we made a half-serious pact to quit for a while, if only to see what would happen.

John, another one of our roommates, suggested we try lucid dreaming. He said if I ever slipped back into one of those night terrors, it might help if I could take control instead of just riding it out. We tried for a while with no success, until one night, on a whim, I decided to try a technique I’d read about online. It said to lie flat on your back, hands at your sides, and stare at the ceiling. That was it.

It sounded easy enough. I wanted to see if I could get back to that place that had frightened me for as long as I could remember. I told myself that, if I could get there on purpose it would be different. I could be the one in control, for once.

So I gave it a go. I lay flat on my back, hands by my side and stared at the ceiling. I focused on the patterns in the plaster above my bed. Tracing the bulges and cracks with my eyes over and over. After a while I focused on my breathing to try and distract myself from my cement heavy eyelids, now counting each time I made a circuit with my eyes of the patterns above that had formed.

I was alone that night with everyone else having headed to the bar. And the house was heavy with silence, the kind of quiet that only happens when it gets late at night. It hung heavy and thick over everything, the only sound other than my deep breaths being the low hum of the radiator the room over, steady and distant.

There was no particular moment I was able to point to. No clear boundary I felt like I had crossed. At some point I felt the distance between me and the cracked plaster on the ceiling grow further and further. Not higher as such just… further away than it had any right to be. The patterns in the plaster softened at the edges and curled and stretched towards me when I tried to focus on them. I felt the heaviness and darkness behind my eyes grow heavier and denser, until I had to blink.

I didn’t even realise where I was at first, all I could feel was the absence of the bed beneath me. That was until I tried taking in my surroundings and realised I had arrived. I was in that dark place again.

I could perceive more now that I was here. Not everything but more than I ever had before. Ahead of me was a crowd of those figures that had haunted me for as long as I could remember, their backs turned as they shuffled toward some kind of structure on the horizon. It was impossibly far away, its shape indistinct against the gloom.

The figures moved together with quiet purpose. I couldn’t tell how far away they were, only that the distance between us felt deliberate. As if they had just missed me. For the first time, I could make out details. They came in all shapes and sizes, each vaguely humanoid, their forms cloaked in drifting wisps of smoke or fog. When they moved, the vapor thinned and parted, briefly revealing bone-white bodies beneath, misshapen, unfinished, before the smoke closed around them again.

They hadn’t seen me. I intended to keep it that way.

I followed them as they made their way toward whatever had drawn them all here. It felt like hours passed, though I never tired. Time didn’t appear to behave the way it should in that place.

As I walked, their numbers began to grow. Though I never saw any new member of the procession arrive. Figures would simply be there, as if they’d always been part of the crowd and I’d only just noticed them. Some of the figures dragged others behind them. These were wrapped in a different kind of smoke, grey rather than black, thicker, heavier. The shapes within it didn’t move on their own.

I kept following. I wanted to learn the rules of this place. It was clear by now that I couldn’t change anything here, even knowing I was dreaming. The space resisted that kind of influence. So I decided to observe instead, to understand it as best I could.

Time continue to pass, though it was impossible to tell how much. More and more figures joined, slipping into place without ceremony, and the only real change was the structure on the horizon drawing closer. As we neared it, its shape resolved into something flatter. Longer. A wall.

It stretched as far as I could see in either direction, its surface emitting a faint, pallid glow that seemed to come from nowhere and everywhere at once. I heard it first before I understood what I was looking at.

The sound reached me, inhuman moans and cries that made my teeth ache, a chorus of voices layered so thickly together that I couldn’t tell where one ended and another began. I stopped walking.

The wall was made of flesh. Faces were pressed into its surface at irregular intervals, mouths opening and closing in silent screams, the source of the noise buried somewhere beneath layers upon layers of living matter.

When the procession reached the edge of the wall, those figures dragging others began to work together. They lifted and pushed their burdens forward, pressing them up against the living surface. Arms erupted from the wall to meet them. The figures disappeared beneath a tide of grasping limbs, their outlines dissolving as they were pulled in and absorbed, their bodies added to the vast, screaming mass. None of the faces I could make out in the wall looked unfamiliar. I just couldn’t remember where I’d seen them before.

I staggered back and turned to run, but my feet tangled beneath me and I went down hard, landing arse over tit on the ground. From where I lay, I looked back at the wall. Every single one of them was watching me now.

The figures had stopped. The faces embedded in the wall had stopped. The moaning had ceased entirely, replaced by a silence so complete it rang in my ears, loud enough to deafen. Then the figures began to move. Slowly at first. Cautiously. As they did, sound returned, not from them, but from the wall itself. Hushed whispers bled out from the flesh on either side of me.

“Geeeet outttt.”

The words overlapped, scattered, coming from dozens, hundreds of mouths at once. As the figures drew closer, the whispers grew louder, rising into shouts, then screams, a frantic, desperate chorus warning me away. The figures were almost on me now. “GEEEET OOOOOOUTTTT”.

I tried to will myself to launch. To do what I had always done before without thinking, to let that familiar force tear me upward and out. Nothing happened.

Whatever I’d relied on all those years ago, I couldn’t reach it consciously. Panic took over. I scrambled to my feet and ran. I ran until the wall’s screams faded into the distance, replaced by the wet, uneven panting of the figures pursuing me.

My chest burned as I ran. Even in a dream. In this place. Each breath felt too shallow and too fast. I kept running until the space around me began to stretch again, and the ground pulled like a rug beneath my feet, and my legs felt suddenly too small for the distance I needed to cover. I was making it worse, I suddenly realised.

It hit me with a sudden clarity, I had managed to escape those times before because I was never trying to. As a child, I hadn’t DONE anything to leave here. I’d cried. I’d panicked. And then exhausted, I’d simply stopped.

The ejection, launch, whatever you wanted to call it, had always come after that.

I stumbled and, rather than trying to catch myself, I let myself fall. Before I’d even hit the floor those figures closed in. Their shapes crowding my vision, their breath hot, close and desperate. As I felt them grab and pull at me, I saw grey wisps rise from my skin, burning wherever they touched. I shut my eyes and stopped trying to run away.

I tried focusing on my breathing. Tried remembering the curls and patterns of the plaster on the ceiling above my body, no matter how far away and long ago it felt. After what felt like too long, too late, that familiar sensation returned. That welcome violent pull, but this time it came not from above or below, but from somewhere inside of me. I didn’t resist it, and let myself be torn upwards and away from this place.

I woke up gasping. Woke feels like the wrong term, as I never felt asleep. That sensation of being thrust upward lingered in my chest as I sat up panting, my breath not having caught up with myself yet. For a few seconds I couldn’t feel myself, anything, my body. Just a weight pressing down into the mattress.

Then, my vision snapped back into place. The room stretched and contorted. Walls bowed inwards, then out again. Far away objects lurched forward into impossible clarity, the sweat soaked duvet swelling into vision until I could make out frayed threads along the seam.

That’s when I saw the eyes.

They were level with the end of the bed. Too low to belong to anyone, anything standing. Yellow and unblinking. Observing me with rapt attention. I squeezed my own eyes shut as tears poured out of them.

When I opened them again, those eyes had gone, but replaced with something else. Movement. The wallpaper at the far end of the room split with a sickening, wet, tearing sound. Wisp cloaked fingering forcing their way through the plaster beneath. Stretching out to try and gain purchase.

I couldn’t scream even if I had wanted to.

Then as abruptly as it started, it stopped.

The room snapped back into shape. The walls stilled. And that familiar comforting silence returned, ordinary and empty. My heart beat hammered in my ears, and, after a few minutes I managed to corral my rapid breathing.

After a little bit of time, I reached for the notebook by that bed, I wanted to note all of what happened down whilst I could remember the details, although something told me I wouldn’t be forgetting any time soon.

I flicked it over to, what should have been an empty page. But there were none. In every page, scrawled over and over, in desperate, hungry handwriting was written the same 3 words again, and again.

“WE SEE YOU”.
