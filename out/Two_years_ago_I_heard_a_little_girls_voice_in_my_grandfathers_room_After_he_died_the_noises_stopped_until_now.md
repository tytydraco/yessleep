My Pop passed away not long after I wrote my original post.
Sorry it’s taken me two years to post an update! 

He passed away shortly after a pretty bad stroke. The old man had been having mini strokes off and on for about a year. Which would make his dementia worse. By the end, he couldn’t speak. Our last real talk was about the house falling into a sinkhole. He feared he’d be swallowed up. Maybe it was guilt — he lived a life full of regrets. I spent that last year as his confessor, hearing things I wish I hadn’t. Despite it all, I respected and loved him. But this story isn’t about that.

When he died, the noises stopped. No more footsteps. No more dragging. No more tapping. No more voices. The house fell quiet. Too quiet. 

But when I’m here, in the house, alone, I still catch things—
whispers in empty rooms,
that off-putting “someone’s watching me” feeling,
and sometimes a sweet, hazy smell that reminds me of his last days.

For a long time, I told myself I was imagining it.

Then yesterday happened.

My mom just had a big surgery, so I’ve been staying home more often. Yesterday afternoon I laid down for a nap. I keep my bedroom door open in case she needs me. Somewhere in that strange in-between place of sleeping and waking, I started to hear my pop’s laughter.

It was a deep chuckle. The kind of rich belly laugh that he used to give when he'd watch cartoons with me when I was a kid. Not the sad, raspy cackle of his later years.

Every time it started, my dog would charge into my room and leap onto the bed. It was as if he heard it too, and wanted to be near me — like I could protect him from whatever was going on. When the laughter stopped, he’d jump down and leave again. It happened more than once.

Later that night, I pulled out my PSB-11 spirit box that I used back when I ghost hunted in college, and sat in Pop’s old room. The second I turned it on—before I even asked anything—I heard a voice through the static:

“Hi—Hello!”

The voice wasn’t faint. It was loud, cheerful, and unmistakable. It sounded exactly like him.

I froze. I’ve never gotten such a clear EVP before, not in any haunted place I’ve been. But this… this was different. I shut it off, walked outside, and lit a cigarette. I haven’t touched it since.

Is this in my head? Or am I just being superstitious? I get it—grief can mess with your head. But it’s been two years!

One last detail. My dog usually sleeps with my grandmother. For a while, he’d bark around 1 a.m. every night. It only stopped after I turned my grandfather’s old chair away from the bed. But even now, he still gets uneasy late at night—ears perked, pacing, growling at nothing.

That was last night. This is today.
I’m still shaken. And I don’t think the house is quiet anymore.

Why now after all this time? It's been 2 years of nothing. Caretakers; has anyone else experienced this?
