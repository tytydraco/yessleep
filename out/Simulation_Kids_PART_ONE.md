They kept sending us money, that was the problem.

Even after the drugs which made your mind spiral into rainbow hell, and the noxious smelling salts, and the obscure rituals, they never cut funding.

Even when we got desperate, they still kept pumping in the surplus of our good taxpayers. It wasn’t just money either, they kept us in good stock of all sorts. This included the drugs, obviously, alongside the sleek and sinister machines, chrome-plated man-made horrors.

They kept us in good stock of all sorts of horrible things, yes, but arguably the worst things they kept sending us were the kids. More hypersensitive and/or strange children from all over the country than you can shake a menacing middle-school bully at.

During my career, we’ve only actively lost four of them due to our experiments. We were never told what happened after they were released from captivity, back into the wild. I sometimes think about how many killed themselves, how many became vegetables from our psychological meddling, how many died from something we’d given them, the effect delayed or slowly accumulating. I even wonder how many died from something unrelated, a car crash or something. I think, even if that were the case, it would still be our fault somehow. When I ponder this at night, I am reminded why I must not have children. I could never deserve such a thing after everything I’ve aided in doing.

One of the ones who died, Thomas Landitt, did so in my arms. It wasn’t even anything to do with our studies, really, nothing unusual. He had very extreme asthma, along with a knack for talking to ‘devils’ in his sleep, and the smoke we made him inhale had triggered it. I tried to help him, I prayed for him there in that blank-walled, nameless room, but when I recognised that there was likely little hope for him, I simply resolved to embrace him, telling him how sorry I was, praying to him instead, for forgiveness. The medics came just as Thomas Landitt had finally given up on taking his last breath.

They never stopped sending us money, no. But eventually, after one too many Thomas Landitts, they stopped sending us kids.

One of the guys we had working with us, a veiny-headed science freak who was deemed too smart to live among normal people, had come up with a theory doubtless born of sleepless nights and morbid over-thinking.

It was based around the concept of a controlled reality, an artificial life under the control of an overseer, a simulation. His theory went that if a person was raised from birth in an environment where he came to know everything as completely predictable, that he would become so used to understanding what was next that even if everything no longer controlled, he would still be able to do so. So apt and guessing what was supposed to come next that he could do it even when his life was not under complete control. 

A home-grown clairvoyant. If they would not give us unusual children, we would grow our own.

It was an idea so utterly stupid and outlandish that it obviously had to work. Anyway, What else were we going to spend all that shiny new government cash on?

Over the course of the next two years, we got to work building a small town.  As our ‘Simulation Kids’ would come to know it, the town was in the heart of Illinois, and had been there for around 150 years. In reality, however the town was brand-spanking new, with the buildings all touched up to look old and wizened, located in rural Montana.

We had drafted in around 500 people to act as townsfolk, some of our own agents as well as unsuspecting US citizens and their families who had been lured in by the promise of a lifetime of free healthcare. There were a few large families fresh from over the border, who would have been willing to sacrifice their firstborn son to the one eyed pyramid if they never had to go back to Mexico.

One of the guys who worked in the IT Department, Ron, a surly little bug-eyed introvert who as far as anyone knew spent months down in the tech office, practically fell onto his face and broke his spectacles trying to get put in the program. Ron had suffered from what had been diagnosed as pretty severe autism all his life, and the chance to do what he had struggled repressing for a living sounded like a godsend to him.

All were briefed that they were to follow a strict routine every day, and also trained them in what to do if anything ever went wrong. Everyone had a method of contacting security, government agents temporarily demoted to small-town cops, and knew what they were to do if the system ever cracked at all. Cover it up and smile.

The routines tightly constricted every single moment of their day, every day of the week, apart from in the evening, when they could do whatever they wanted in their houses. The centrepiece of our performance was ‘the morning scene’, where each person would leave their homes at the same time and go the exact same direction. It was decided that they must follow their routine every moment of the day, so that the lives of the Simulation Kids could be completely reliable.

Ron used to damn near explode whenever he thought that the other residents weren’t doing ‘well enough’. Once, when his neighbour hadn’t woken up early enough for a dress rehearsal, he berated him thoroughly across his front lawn fence. Another time, after requests from the exhausted populace for at least a week off early in the process, Ron, who had vehemently protested against this, was found weeping to himself under his bed. There were a lot of complaints, indeed. Some of the residents compared it to torture, and many of the less thick-skinned had begged to be excused.

The whining wasn’t only due to the gruelling nature of their job, however. Many complained about the location of the town itself. Some heard strange noises in the night, spotted the animals acting unusually, and even said they thought that the trees were somehow menacing. The other thing was the dreams. Women would hear children crying or have gutting dreams about their own children which they couldn’t bear to describe, while men had dreams of burning towns and cities. Two different men told us about essentially the same dream, where a naked woman was impaled from a meat hook in a dark room, not a scar or any sign of injury on her. However, she held a small, baby-like form against her chest, which was dripping with blood. The children, meanwhile, had pleasant dreams of talking animals and flying.

For us, and for what we planned to do in this area, this seemed like just about the perfect working environment.

After about three years of this rehearsal phase, the complaints almost ceased to exist. They became like a real community, the residents claiming they were starting to actually enjoy their routines, along with the promise that it would likely only be a few more years before they were allowed to go back. Personally, I only ever visited, and stayed in the obscure headquarters ten minutes from the town over the course of those twelve years, but whenever I visited in that third year of the residents settlement period, the environment of the town usually struck me as unnerving.

It was like a cult commune, everyone strolling around with the over-exaggerated zeal of Disneyland employees, all swapping positive sentiments with each other on the street. The way they said these things was prayer-like, a rictus repeated so regularly that it had lost most of its actual meaning to them, but at the same time something that they had been so thoroughly ensured to believe with all of their being that they dare not forget it.

And they were all so tired. They hid it best they could, of course, but you saw that it was starting to wear on them properly, even early on. When they’d finally adapted to it, it was even worse. It was sad, watching all of them groggily doing their best to look like they were well-functioning people.

I told the director, Josh Bleeker, about how strange I felt whenever I went into the town. He agreed, but he said, in a firmer voice than usual “we’ve got one foot in this mess already Kate, three years worth of foot, in fact. All we can do now is shove the other one in and pray.”

Josh was the third director of our organisation that I’d served under during my time, and not the last, but he was, at the time, my favorite. Josh was a relatively normal man. Obviously probably not by a lot of other people’s standards due to the nature of our job, but he was never weird or creepy when he came in. He had a very encouraging nature, a sort of warm presence which almost gave you the will to keep going. 

He had a catchphrase that he’d usually crack out at team meetings, and occasionally in conversation. “The show must go on!” He’d say, grinning. It was also a bit of an inside joke too, about how the State were practically shoving us along with all the resources we were given. It worked quite effectively in a variety of contexts. He said it with his full chest, bellowing out to everyone to get us riled up. He’d say it in private, encouraging one of his workers if they expressed concerns. He’d say it grimly, seemingly half to himself, when something awful happened. And while this last example didn’t directly support us that much, it showed us, in my mind, that he wanted to let us know that even he was tired of this stuff.

I was in love with him to quite an unhealthy extent. Either because he was actually just very charismatic, or because I lived with him for more than a decade, like Stockholm Syndrome, but between prisoners. The fact that he was also one of the only among my male co-workers who I was confident wouldn’t be a serial killer if things had turned out differently for them probably also helped.

Admittedly, the other women weren’t much better, myself included. The fact that he had to deal with all of our imperfections and lapses in sanity, and still treated us like people was one of the things I used to justify my infatuation for him the most.

During our rehearsals, he was like a movie director, rushing around and giving everyone in the town notes. He even got them saying his catchphrase. While I had to have every trace of it scoured from the internet, I had a video on my phone of all the kids in the town, all lined up, smiling, with Josh at the front. All of them say “The show must go on!” And laugh.

After that, Josh came up to me to look at the video. When I remember the way he looked at me then, I wonder if he really did like me back, and I curse myself for not doing anything about it.

He’d play the role of the unseen mayor of the town, appearing only at festivals, and, after some discussion, the town was named after him, Bleekerville.

So, after roughly 5 years of building, training and putting our little, fake town together, we finally decided it was just about good enough. It was finally time to shove the other foot in.

We’d decided that three children, each raised in different households, would be the optimum for this first test of the process. Three families were randomly selected to bear and raise the kids, none having a say in the matter.

One woman, Abigail Meline, was distraught at the news. Her and her husband had never wanted children, and admitted that she personally hated them. She still had no choice. It was barbaric, doing that to her, I knew that at the time, but I also knew, or I thought, that it was fair. It served a purpose, one that this time, was going to work for us.

A sign of things to come, all three children were conceived on the same day and were also born on the same day. This was not our doing. To us, this unexplainable event served as some kind of proof that we were heading in the right direction. Despite this, I could not shake off the feeling that this coincidence was not a miracle or a success, but a warning.

They were creepy little shits, that was clear as soon as they came out. Gangly with knobbly bones visible from their stretched-out looking skin, and sunken eyes. Each, despite one being from a Mexican family, one from a Polish Jewish couple, and the last a white-as-wool ginger, had similar hair, lanky and straw-like. Lifeless. Initially, we thought they’d somehow all be born with the same genetic deformity, however the results of the tests we took on them suggested we simply had three healthy baby boys.

Dennis was the Melines’ boy, from Abigail and her husband James. His head looked like it was squashed out backwards, a sort of bulbous feature at the end. His voice was an excruciatingly high pitch, even for a child, and when he laughed spit flew from his mouth like an unavoidable torrent of bullets. A very sensitive boy, he used to start screaming and covering his ears whenever he heard a somewhat loud noise, like a car going by too fast or something being dropped. Abigail tried her best with him, she really did, she always had to reassure him whenever anything happened, which ultimately exhausted her.

Louis was the biggest of the three, raised in a Mexican family who already had three other children. He ate a lot, more than you’d expect any child who was as bony-looking as him to eat. Instead of growing outward, he continually grew upward at a rate too fast for even a young child, getting pains from this which left him occasionally bed ridden, as well as gangly and 5’’1 at five years old. He rarely went to sleep as well, Mr and Mrs Cabral would sometimes wake up in the middle of the night and hear his bunny-rabbit teeth clacking and his pale lips smacking as he demolished the consumable contents of their shelves.

Finally, there was Eric. A scrawny ginger kid, smallest of all three, Eric was, without a doubt, the most evil-looking child you’d ever see. His cheeks and eye sockets were even more sunken than that of his ‘brothers’, and while the Trio’s similar ugliness made the other two look like gormless zombies, it made Eric look like a cunning, bloodthirsty vampire. His behaviour made this even more believable, he would sneak out of bed and sit up on some ledge somewhere all night, jumping out at his groggy family members, scaring them shitless. He used to take small bugs and slowly dissect them with hairpins, then throw the remains in the toilet, say a prayer and flush them down, thanking them for their contribution to ‘science’, even occasionally weeping for them. He was a nuisance in general, always going around Bleekerville and knocking over post-boxes, or throwing leaves over driveways. Once while someone was up a ladder as part of their weekend routine, Eric tipped the poor man back down onto the floor then ran off.

His dad, in particular, hated him. Mr O’Leary had been raised in a very strict household, and his new son enraged him with his insolence. He would berate him to the point that we were worried he would resort to physical punishment for his son.

At school, the trio immediately flocked together on their first day, not a single word between them. That’s how most of their ‘friendship’, or more companionship, seemed to operate, in complete silence. The only one who usually spoke was Eric, and that was to give orders. They became like his henchmen, Louis seeming happy to do whatever Eric wanted for the fun of it, while Dennis occasionally complained, but was swiftly intimidated into shutting up and getting on with it. They rarely interacted with any of the other kids at school, only getting into fights with them. They weren’t bullied, that had been trained out of the normal kids, who had been moulded into model schoolchildren, eager to learn and follow rules. If anything, the trio were bullies, harassing other children and stealing their belongings. One little boy said that he didn’t like them, saying that the way they moved reminded him of spiders. 

They grew up like this, abnormal children who took a sadistic pleasure in causing disruption, living in a reality that was trying its hardest to be as flawless as possible. On the experiment itself, sacrifices of those who lived in the monotonous purgatory of Bleekerville were not in vain, as we had seen quite a fair amount of success from our test on the three. We’d had weekly “doctor’s appointments” with the kids where they were tested. It was all pretty old-school stuff (‘Artichoke Tests’ as we sometimes called them), but it had worked. All had been able to seemingly see things beyond curtains and even walls once we had them on drugs.

One day, we were attempting to see if any were capable of something we’d rarely been brave enough to test. There were a bunch of us, Josh included, packed into a dark little room and watching Louis through a one-sided tinted glass window. The giant of a boy was sitting at a table, a small glass of water sitting before him. He was clenching his teeth, hard as he could, with the veins standing out on his forehead and neck. From between his teeth, saliva dripped rapidly, and he was starting to twitch a bit.

In front of him the glass of water was sitting definitely, only a few inches from his head, which was nearly resting on the table as he keeled over from effort.

For a moment, he was sent back to his seat, panting and sweating. Then, regaining his second wind suddenly, Louis sat bolt upright, his eyes steely, and the glass toppled over.

The grim viewing chamber turned into a bellowing football stadium for a while after that, our cheers were so loud that Louis heard them from behind the reinforced walls and we had to be silent while he was herded off, back to the town. We had a sort of party at the small headquarters outside of town that night, pretty tame by most people’s standards, I’d expect, but we had to celebrate somehow. We’d had much greater results in the past, but never had we spent so long working towards them. The little science freak who thought of the whole simulation kid idea was getting pats on the back all round, and he looked like he hadn’t gotten this level of praise since his last spelling bee.

It was a good night, for everyone else at least. Especially this snake from another department, Lisa, who managed to slither her way to Josh’s ear. He was hanging around her all night, smiling at her while she talked, slowly hypnotising him. I only spoke to people so as to not look like I was just glowering at her the whole time. I don’t like to be jealous, but still to this day I cannot understand what part of him was at all entranced by her.

After he had finished his obligatory rousing speech, Josh, ever ending interactions with his team with a little bit of lightness or relatability, motioned over to Lisa.

“Now, I’ve got something else planned for this evening, folks, if you’ll be so kind as to excuse me?” He winked, turning away for a moment then quickly turning back again, slightly tipsy. He raised his arms, hands curled up into victorious fists above him, belting out; “THE SHOW MUST GO ON!”

Everyone laughed, everyone clapped. *What a guy. What a guy.* Trevor, one of our security guards who was by my analysis likely a psychopath whooped and called; “Go get ‘er J!” after him. Lisa smiled at everyone, her red lips pursing into a smug expression. Her eyes lingered on me. *She knows, the fucking cow!* I thought, biting down on my lip to keep in the tears.

I went to my room not too long after that. There were no other reasons to stay at the party, especially when Trevor started desperately and somewhat half-heartedly hitting on me. All I wanted to do was cry all night. It had become too much for me. I hated those children, and despite our recent victory, I had no enthusiasm nor hope for continuing our project. I couldn’t stop thinking about all those people in Bleekerville, living like pieces of code, only able to perform one function, while we basked in hedonism in our little alcove, getting irritated that the little disabled children we were experimenting on weren’t exploding heads with their brains or stealing the thoughts of world leaders. But when I tried to cry, it was like I’d sucked them all back up at the party, trying to hold them in.

Instead, I just decided to go to sleep, hoping to see Josh. If I couldn’t have him in the waking world, maybe I would be allowed to see him in my sleep.

I did not have pleasant dreams that night. Nobody in the whole of Bleekerville did, for that matter. And when they awoke, life became its own slow nightmare.

Everyone had horrible dreams that night, myself included. While I slept I was given a vision of some kind of mass grave, dozens of foetuses, swamped in blood and gore, all lying at the bottom of some great pit, while a woman quietly wept in the background, a cry of regret and sadness.

In addition, when we awoke, each of the Trio’s parents called us up, all at roughly the same time, telling us of the swelled, red marks they had found on their children. Upon inspection, each had the exact same wound, which looked as if it had been wrought with a cracking belt, in the exact same place.

We made the connection, after a few hours of dumbfoundedness, that this was proof of some kind of deeper connection between the boys, deeper than their strange bond, or even their synchronised births. It was a connection of flesh and mind, one which bound the lives of these three terrible creatures together. One of them had been beaten, which had somehow had the effect of wounding all three.

Our problem now was finding and sorting out which of the parents had done such a thing. Of course, we were immediately suspicious of Mr O’Leary. The fits of rage he burst into, especially towards his son, did not indicate a man who practiced control. Even the way which he treated others was akin to the behaviour of an abuser, if a restrained one, due to his current environment.

“Just because I have a good, disciplined way of dealing with my son after he misbehaves doesn’t mean I’m beating him!” He said when me and another of our organization came round to his house. “Who raised you people? That’s what I’d like to know. No, you folks really need to get your values in check!”

We were in the living room, identical to every other living room in Bleekerville, a calming and idyllic room with a somewhat retro decor. Identical apart from the shoddily plastered-over crack in the wall near the television, which O’Leary had struck after the New England Patriots lost a match.

I hesitantly attempted to calm him, which was like approaching a raging bull. “We’ve inquired about all the parents of the subjects so far, sir, this is simply-”

I was suddenly cut off as O’Leary bolted out of the room, chasing after Eric, who had been peeking around the doorway, silently observing us with massive eyes.

“Come back here boy, dammit! I want to speak with you!”

After another half an hour of O’Leary coaxing his son into claiming that his father would never lay a finger on him, we left the house. The little runt had a small smirk on his face as he spoke. It was sort of smug, as if he’d gotten away with something really bad.

The other two homes didn’t lead us anywhere new in our investigation. The Cabrals had made their case quite convincingly, and we didn’t really suspect the small, tired little man and woman of doing anything to their son, who despite everything they clearly showed affection for. I only got a small glimpse of Louis while we were in the house, but the way he looked at his siblings, who were all a bit shorter than him, resembled the way the average child might look at sugary treats in the window of a candy store. Out of reach for now, but still extremely tempting.

Abigail was breaking down when we spoke to her. She too, apparently, had been struck with the horrific dreams, so bad that she could not even speak about them. I felt so bad for her that I comforted her for a long while, almost forgetting to question her.

When we got back to the headquarters, we received even more awful news. There had been a suicide, someone from Bleekerville, finally cracking under the pressure, had jumped out in front of a car. The man who drove the car, having gone at the exact same speed in the exact same direction every day for the past decade, simply continued, running the guy down, and then driving off.

As it turned out, it had been Ron from the IT department. The same once-troubled man who had jumped at the opportunity to be involved in what he saw as a rigidly controlled paradise. His neighbors had heard him screaming from next door in the early hours of the morning, after awakening from horrors of their own, and he had stumbled out onto his lawn at around 6 AM, ranting about how he’d made a terrible mistake.

His neighbor, trying to calm him down, had asked what the mistake he’d made was. In response, Ron had apparently scrambled over to him, upper body leaning almost horizontally over the white fence with his nose almost pressed against the neighbor’s face. He had then said “we’ve all made a mistake man, all of us. It’s my fault more than yours, I know, but you’re all still going to get punished for it. Everyone is. Except for the children, that’s what it wants to protect. The real children, I mean. We’ve gone against what’s right. And you’re all gonna get punished for it.” Seeing the car moving down the road at that point, Ron had turned back to his neighbor, grinning. 

“But not me.” And then he ran off, standing in the road with his eyes closed for five whole seconds before the car hit him.

There had never been any real injuries in Bleekerville, so the skills of the doctors at the mostly calm town hospital had slowly deteriorated. Ron was dead two hours later.

“We’ve lost an integral part of the project today.” Josh said at the following meeting. “While he wasn’t a social animal, Josh was a shining example of…of perseverance, and I’m sure that he’d want us to keep going.”

But what Ron had said before taking his own life could be simply dismissed. It was obvious what he had meant when he said that we were going against nature, but who was punishing us, and why were the townsfolk not exempt to this punishment?

Before we could investigate any of this further, more disasters struck. It was like something had been lying in wake that whole time, up until Louis had finally tipped the cup over. The tipping point. Then, when it sensed we finally felt genuine hope for our little blasphemous project, it had decided to finally emerge, watching as everything leisurely rolled downhill for us.
