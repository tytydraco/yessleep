You don't realise the fragility of reality until you watch it begin to crack.

I'm typing this now, hands shaking, because I've just understood something horrifying, and there won’t be much time to keep this coherent. I can't tell you exactly where I am—the truth is I'm not sure anymore—but what I can say is we are contracted by top-tier government research agencies. That is how I got here. It was here that Microsoft's Majorana 1 quantum chip was first tested and deployed, long before the public announcement.

Using Majorana fermions—particles that are their own antiparticles—this chip delivered computational power beyond our wildest imagination. Little does the world know, we've been using this technology covertly for years, enabling breakthroughs so profound they border on science fiction. We've accurately predicted geopolitical upheavals, controlled complex biological systems, and even manipulated climate patterns at a global scale. It's how Bill Gates got the idea to fund The Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment—beginning the controversial sun-dimming project to combat climate change.

But ambition, unchecked, can be catastrophic.

Hours ago, we reached an unprecedented milestone: simulating the quantum vacuum itself, the underlying quantum foam from which universes bubble into existence. For one fleeting moment, we glimpsed something extraordinary—but then something went horribly wrong.

Immediately, subtle anomalies began to emerge in our instrumentation, rapidly escalating. Logs fractured, commands initiated but never concluded, calculations partially completed then abruptly reversed, and bizarrely, instruments spontaneously activated entirely unrelated simulations we never configured or even conceived of running. Each of us rushed to debug and investigate at our respective stations.

Then I started noticing things personally. Looking at the clocks around me, one reads 2:03, another 1:58, and a third 2:01, which should be impossible since all are synchronized precisely with our atomic clock. My typing stutters inexplicably—letters appear, vanish, and then reappear completed without my conscious input. Soon, the entire team experiences surreal anomalies: receiving answers to questions we never asked, conversation amnesia, and the disorienting sensation of hearing the conclusion of a sentence before its beginning—all accompanied by an overwhelming and persistent sense of déjà vu.

Investigation became impossible as our calibration references began exhibiting quantum instability, shifting unpredictably between subtly different states. Even the clothes on my back feel inexplicably lighter, almost unreal, as if they lack the fundamental properties of solid matter. Doubting my perception, I witness my colleague’s jumper shift colour from red to blue between glances, though my memory insists it was originally red. Familiar items, like my notebook, feel profoundly alien, as if the emotional attachment and familiarity I once had have been erased.

Panicking, I moved to leave the lab and raise the alarm. Our lab was meticulously designed, situated deep underground in a vibration-dampened, climate-controlled bunker. The Majorana 1 quantum chip itself is housed within a triple-shielded dilution refrigerator operating at temperatures colder than deep space, enclosed in a superconducting, electromagnetically shielded Faraday cage. Yet, as I opened the secure containment door, the auditory chaos engulfed me first. Background sounds fractured into nauseatingly dissonant layers, as i gazed out, voices echoed slightly ahead of mouths moving, and phantom whispers and footsteps emanated from empty spaces.

Reading became nearly impossible; labels shifted meanings without visual change—"Cryogenic Tank 03" became "Emergency Vent 03" upon a second glance, my mind reinterpreting the text entirely. Perception itself seemed layered. Briefly, I observed transparent echoes of alternate realities superimposed over my surroundings—two slightly different wall tiles at conflicting angles, a colleague flickering rapidly between locations.

I quickly sealed the door, activating the Faraday cage’s electromagnetic shielding automatically behind me, isolating our lab in an attempt to slow the collapse, but it was futile. My mind races, comprehending this terrible truth: Our universe isn't stable; it's merely a fragile quantum probability among infinite possibilities. The Majorana 1 didn’t merely simulate—it observed, collapsing our delicate bubble universe into a catastrophic state.

Now reality itself is beginning to unravel…and it will not be pleasant.

Even here in this sealed room, emotionally everything feels profoundly wrong. An ordinary mug evokes dread, a chair sparks inexplicable grief. Familiar faces become momentarily strange or overwhelmingly familiar, evoking memories of lifetimes never lived. We are losing ourselves, and soon we will never again comprehend who, what, where, or even when we are—if we continue to exist at all.

These effects will escalate rapidly. Soon, you too will notice small shifts—forgotten conversations resurfacing with unfamiliar details, memories you trust suddenly seeming uncertain, moments repeating subtly differently, objects feeling unfamiliar in your hand. Your perception will split, witnessing ghostly layers of alternate possibilities, shadows whispering truths you never knew.

Soon, our universe will fragment entirely, dissolving into raw quantum chaos. Seconds, minutes, days, weeks? Only time will tell. Hell maybe you're not out there anymore. Maybe I'm not actually here anymore either.

I'm not writing this to stop it—we can't. It's far too late. I'm writing because, as the world flickers around me, I see something even more terrifying. I opened the logs from a spontaneous simulation—one that appeared unprompted after the observation.

This isn’t the first bubble universe to collapse—and it won’t be the last. Since the observation, the system has generated over 2¹⁶ logs. Each one shows signs of a universe-scale simulation attempt—spontaneous, unprompted, and beyond anything the test team configured.

If each log marks a reality, then we’ve unknowingly created 65,536 universes. Or perhaps... uncovered them. At least, among the ones I’ve been able to decode.

But the thought that lingers—the one that bends reason—isn’t just that this is happening.

It’s that every simulation might be another ‘us’ reaching the same conclusion.

The real question isn’t whether we’re the first to realise it.

It’s whether we’re just another entry in the next log.
