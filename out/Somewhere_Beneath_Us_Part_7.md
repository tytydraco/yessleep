&#x200B;

By the time we left the room, we had been there nearly two weeks. Ethan's arm wasn't remotely close to fully healed. Still, it had changed from extreme pain to tolerable stinging, and he insisted that we move on. The rest of us didn't argue; we were all ready to push forward as well. Primarily since we had heard the Curator crawling around our floor a few days prior. We exited the room and headed deeper down into the house. Or perhaps the basement? It was harder to tell the longer we traveled what to refer to the place as. It was too strange and disorganized to be a compound, yet too in decay to be referred to as a bunker. We simply tried not to think about it. It wasn't necessary. We had been walking for a few days, and as we had, the floors seemed to get bigger and bigger. Each floor seemed to be more vast than the last, with larger rooms and deeper staircases.

We made sure to scavenge along the way and stop in any safe rooms we found. However, the strange thing was that some of them hadn't been marked with a smiley face like the group we had been retracing had designated. They were marked with other symbols; A checkmark, a star, a circle, things like that. A lot weren't marked at all. Even though we took direct paths through the basement where the last group would have walked, there were so many mismarked rooms. No logs either. The ones we did find didn't offer any new information anyways. Just a slowly declining count from 10 to 6, all people lost from the Curator (Who still followed us as well). By the time we had gone down twenty floors, it had been about a month, and the map in my notebook had become quite complex. Still, I was able to decipher it relatively easily and trace it back up. All in all, things were going well despite minor close calls here and there. That was until we stepped into floor twenty-one.

"Yeah, right," Bea whispered.

"I'm serious," Daniel told her.

"You did not own a Ferrari."

"That hard to believe?"

"No. You just don't strike me as the kind of guy."

"What's that supposed to mean?"

"That you're a stiff old man." Bea jabbed with a smirk.

"Hey now." Dan laughed silently.

We had learned that it was okay to talk in the halls as long as we kept quiet and stayed on alert. If we heard any noise at all, it was back to mute.

As I walked next to Ethan, I saw him fidgeting with the scar on his arm. It was gnarly and dark still. I swatted his hand, and he turned to me in surprise.

"Sorry." He sighed.

"How is it?"

"Good. Still sore, and it itches. Hard to close my hand too. But nothing has fallen off yet, so it's still a win."

I smirked, "Hey, maybe if it does, by the time we get back to Earth, they might have developed a cool cyborg prosthetic for you."

"Heck yeah. Built-in speakers and everything."

Suddenly up ahead, I saw Dan and Bea stop at the next doorway. Bea raised her hand and turned back to us.

"What is it?" I muttered.

They stepped through and gestured, and we followed, realizing the hesitation. The doorway stepped out onto a metal catwalk, high above a stage below. The walk stretched far across the way to another door. Looking down, we could see a bunch of props and set pieces, as well as a red curtain with light shining through a gap underneath. The set pieces looked like they were made for some kind of children's show, depicting trees with smiling faces and perfect rolling hill backdrops. I shuttered, as they looked so similar to the hills above. Behind the curtain, a muffled melody could be heard playing; a distorted and crackling recording of 'Mary had a little lamb.' This was all a weird sight, not because of the setting; no, that was all par for the course down here. It was strange since this was the first room we had seen so far with two stories. Most rooms, though some of them vast, expanded only upward. Never down

Dan nodded to the doorway across the catwalk, wanting to move on. We were all with him. Finding a way down might have been a shortcut; however, that wasn't guaranteed. Besides, usually, music was a bad omen down here. We all marched along the catwalk, single file and stepping quietly as not to rattle the rickety thing. If only we had noticed just how unstable it was before all stepping onto it at once.

We reached the middle when we heard a long and exaggerated *creaaaaak* from below. We all stopped, took one look at one another, then went to run the rest of the way. We were too late. With a sharp pop, we heard the bars holding our part of the catwalk snap. The thing's weight no longer being supported caused a chain reaction that slowly brought down the rest of it. It fell into a slope, and the four of us slid and tumbled down to the stage like children on a playground slide. The metal catwalk then loudly clattered to the floor with us across the set, causing a jumbled mess of pipes and platforms. The music behind the curtain suddenly stopped.

I quickly looked to Ethan, who had tumbled down first, to make sure he was alright. He held his arm tightly, but it appeared to be more internal pain. Luckily the wound hadn't split. Bea and Daniel sat up, shaking themselves off as well. That was the only analysis I had time for. Someone had intentionally stopped the music.

"Hide!" I sharply whispered before scrambling to my feet.

I helped Ethan up, and Daniel and Bea joined us. We all dashed toward the back of the stage as we heard footsteps approaching. Each of us dove into the set pieces that had been stacked to the side. Bea and Daniel dove into a structure that looked like a colorful playhouse, and Ethan and I ducked into the back of a hollow smiling tree. Then we waited.

I heard the footsteps grow louder, then noticed another set alongside them. And another. And another... dozens of steps approached, as well as the sound of tiny little patters across the floor. My heart immediately started playing its familiar song. At least the things weren't like the ballerinas, I thought. At least I knew where they were. There were a lot of footsteps as whatever came to investigate moved about the stage. There was rattling as well as they picked up the loose pipes and then dropped them with little regard. I hoped to God that they wouldn't investigate the set itself. As we waited, we began to hear other sounds as well, small little giggle-like noises, like someone was trying to hold back a laugh. There was also the noise of clothes brushing past itself or against skin. A lot of it. Then as soon as they came, they went. A hundred footsteps left the stage and headed back to whatever lay beyond. The music clicked back on, and everything resumed as it was.

Cautiously, I peeked my head out. I was surprised to see that the catwalk had been neatly picked up and stored off in the wings of the stage. Ethan and I emerged, and Bea and Daniel followed close behind. We didn't dare speak, as we knew that whatever was behind the curtains would undoubtedly hear us. Dan looked up and investigated the doorway. We had taken quite a fall, nearly fifty feet. If it hadn't been for the catwalk, we would have been severely injured. I didn't want to imagine how that would have gone when whatever creatures past the curtain came to investigate. We looked around for a way up, but all we could find was a ladder, and it was only twenty feet. There was no chance of us climbing our way out of here. We were trapped. Unless there was a door on the other side of the curtains, we were out of options. Any other ideas we had involved noise, and that clearly wasn't an option.

We all jumped as the music clicked off again. We ran to our hiding spots, but when I heard the footsteps traveling away from us, I glanced around the corner. I saw the light click off under the curtain, immediately followed by the sound of a door shutting. We all stepped out from hiding and crossed the stage. Dan peered first through the curtain, and we all held our breath.

He pulled back, "It's all clear. There's nothing." He whispered.

We stepped past the red barrier and took in the room.

We stood on a stage that sat above a large party room. It was colorful, like the kind you would see at a pizza arcade. Bright colors and swirls adorned the walls, as well as illustrations of smiling animals and inanimate objects. The floor was comprised of glittery and colorful tiles, and the paneled ceiling helped dimly light the room with fluorescent bulbs. They appeared to be the safety kind that only faded to a low glow when turned off. Colorful tables lined the room, and playmats and other toys covered the floor. Coloring books had been left strewn about with crayons to accompany them. In a stool in the center of the room sat a red radio.

"What the..." Ethan muttered.

We had walked through rooms that looked to be designed for children before, but they were never this bad. Never this detailed. It was genuinely unsettling.

"I do not like this..." Bea whispered.

"Yeah, cause the rest of this house is so enjoyable," Ethan joked

"Reminds me of that pizza place you take your kids to," Dan grunted.

"Chuck-e-cheese?" I asked.

"Yeah."

"You have kids, Dan?" Ethan questioned.

"No." the man quickly shot back. "Is this really important right now?"

Two double doors lay in the far corner of the room. They were red, with two big round windows at the top where a light shone in from a hall. We slowly made our way over, and as we did, I glanced down at one of the open coloring books. I wished that I hadn't. It was open to a page of a princess picking an apple from a tree. Nothing was colored, however, except for the apple and a pink scribble by her head. The scribble seemed to barely cover her scalp and wrapped around the bend of it. The unsettling part was the red lines that poured out from where the scribble touched, and the frown that had been harshly drawn over the princess's mouth.

We reached the door, and Bea and Ethan looked out first. They turned to us and shook their heads, then gently pulled the handle. The doors opened into a hallway that buzzed with more lights, these ones fully lit. A hallway with multiple colorful closed doors headed down in two directions, ending in yet, more doors.

"Which way?" Ethan asked.

Music emanated from the left side, and all was silent from the right where a sign above a door read Nursery. All the rooms had a sign. Bathroom, kitchen, nap nook, library, playroom. We had just exited the "activity room." Unfortunately, none of the locations sounded like they held a way out.

"Maybe the playroom?" Bea suggested. "Seems like the only way that might have some sort of exit."

We all agreed and slipped into the hall. We were all on edge as we inched our way over to the playroom. Somehow being caught in the light when we knew danger was about was more terrifying than the dark. At least then, we felt somewhat hidden. Not exposed in an open hall. I reached the door first and slowly stood, peaking in. The room was dark, but I could see a play place waiting on the other side, its plastic tubing and slides running wildly about the room. An ocean of colorful plastic balls filled a large pit in the middle, and there were various swings and seesaws speckled around as well. However, except for a child's dream, the room appeared empty.

I gave the door a light push, and it swung open effortlessly. Stepping inside, I immediately felt a sense of relief upon seeing the ceiling. There was none. It opened up into a space where black metal tubing held lights that illuminated below. It was at the same level that the catwalk had been, and it appeared to run past the back wall and out of the area entirely. A way out. We could easily climb the play structure and scale the tubing from there.

I heard something wet beneath my feet as I entered the door, squishing into the foam mat ground. I looked down to see thick, dark puddles of crimson below me. I checked the room again, and what hadn't been clear to me from the window now was. There was blood everywhere. Dripping from the play structure, soaking the ball pit, and pooling on nearly every horizontal surface.

"My word..." muttered Bea.

"We need to get out of here. Now." Daniel said.

"Let's go. Up the play structure. Ethan, can you climb?" I asked.

"Yeah, I- I think so."

We all ran forward to where a slide spiraled to the floor. I placed my hands on top of the thing to pull myself up. I had just begun climbing when we all heard it. Giggling from near the door. We froze, and our heads spun around to look. There was nobody there, but it was clearly coming from that direction. I fumbled for the flashlight and turned it on, shining it toward the darkness that surrounded the doorway. The beam rested on something hanging on the wall. It was a clock with a big jolly face on it, its mouth wrinkled and stretched from its overextended smile. Its eyes were cartoony Pac-man-shaped pupils on white balls that darted rhythmically side to side. It took me a moment to realize it wasn't just made to look alive. It was actually moving....

The laughter was real.

"Joel, hurry," Bea commanded nervously.

I obeyed, attempting to scale the slide as fast as I could. The other three followed closely, but the slope was so slick with blood that it made the round surface hard to scale. Suddenly, the doors flew open, and what entered was not what I was expecting.

It was a large person dressed as a bird, the kind of costume you would see on Sesame Street or the Muppets. Its feathers were a variety of colors, forming a vibrant rainbow across its pear-shaped body. Its perfect white eyes and black pupils peered at us, and its felt beak hung open as if it was surprised to see us. It suddenly raised its hands to its cheeks, then began violently clapping. The four of us just sat staring, mortified, but quickly snapped out of it when the bird started to run toward us, its costume bouncing with each hop. I reached the top of the slide and began to climb up further, but below, the person had already reached the decline. It reached out, grappling for Daniels's leg, but when it missed, it instead grabbed the edges of the tunnel and began to shake.

Whoever was in the suit was incredibly strong; It felt like an earthquake was shaking the structure. Ethan, Bea, and Daniel couldn't keep their balance on the slick plastic and tumbled over the edge, falling to the mats below.

Bea lay face up, staring at me. She sucked the wind that had been knocked out of her lungs back in and yelled, "Joel... Go..."

Two more birds threw open the door and saw the scene unfolding. The first creature turned around and clapped at them, then pointed at my friends. They skipped over, and one bent down, scooping up both Bea and Ethan with ease. Dan stood and tried to throw a punch at the remaining one, but his fist simply connected with its massive gut, and it just looked down at him, cocking its head in confusion. It wagged its finger, then lunged forward, wrapping him too in a vice grip.

My brain kicked into overdrive. I didn't know what to do. Could I help them? The things were too strong; I wouldn't stand a chance. But there was no way I could leave my friends behind like that. I watched as the birds began hauling them back to the door to an unknown fate. The original bird looked up at me, and I just waited for its next move. It opened its beak and tilted its massive head. My heart pounded. Suddenly, in one quick moment, it shuffled its feet in place and wound its arms up, then scurried into the slide below me. I didn't waste a second; I scaled higher, the play place beneath me shaking as the bird forced its massive form through the tight tubes. Ahead of me across the top of a red tunnel, I could see a clear plastic dome that bubbled upward toward the pipes overhead. They hadn't killed the others yet. If I could survive this, maybe I could find a way to save them.

I began to carefully move across the tunnel, making sure not to fall. Below me, the bird reached my layer of the structure. The person in the suit slammed against the roof, causing me to fall from a crouch into a crawl. I was halfway across the tunnel, reaching out for the lip of the other side when from a small window in the side of the tube, I felt an arm grab my dangling leg. In one motion, it jerked its hand downward, forcing me sideways. I quickly latched onto the edge of the play structure ahead of me, adrenaline injecting straight into my muscles. The bird from the tunnel desperately stretched its arm forward, trying to grab the back of my jacket, but I swung my body sideways as hard as I could, using the momentum to link my legs back to the tunnel, then hoist myself up. Running to the dome, I stood at the top and leaped upward, grabbing the bars overhead. As I vaulted myself, I happened to look down.

Below me, the bird stared up through the bubbled window. It pounded on the plastic with both hands and violently flailed its head in anger. It was a crazed, erratic shake that chilled me to my bone.

I didn't look back after that. Instead, I began balancing across the bars until I reached the part of the support that hung over the ceiling of the rest of the room. I dropped down and drew the flashlight from my pocket, then clicked it on. The ground below me was simple drywall and wood, and for a moment, that made me jump until I remembered that I was safe. The house was indestructible; I wouldn't fall through. However, that thought left a sour taste in my mouth as my brain linked it to something else. If the house was unbreakable, why did the catwalk collapse on us? Surely it was considered part of the structure....

Later, I told myself. Figure it out later. Right now, my friends needed me.

I began moving across the top of the strange children's playhouse until I came to another opening in the ceiling. Peering over the edge, I shone the flashlight down to find an overly cartoonish kitchen. The floor was black and white checkered tiles with a big green table stretching the entire length of the room. Dozens of matching chairs were lined up with it, and along the walls, pristine white cabinets were affixed. A big red fridge rested next to an orange oven and a blue sink to top it off. I could see one of the smiling clocks high above the wall on the opposing side of the room and decided to move on before it noticed me. The place was too high up anyways. Dropping down would only leave trapped in there. I needed to find a safe way in and out first.

I continued on until I came to the edge of the structure. Around the edges, It looked like another catwalk had been built. I climbed over the railing and began to follow it. Eventually, it came to a fork; a bridge that crossed to an open doorway, and stairs that led down. I made a note of the opening, then took the stairs. I would come back for it once I found the others. My feet stepped off the metal and onto the flat concrete below. Turning back to the playhouse, the whole thing was made up of the same drywall and wood supports as the ceiling. It was a strange sight, considering how detailed the inside was. I began to move around the perimeter, looking for a door.

It seemed that the entire playhouse had been built inside one massive room, with the large metal crossbars hanging over the whole thing. The corpses of spotlights hung loosely from them. In the empty space around me, there was a myriad of set pieces and wooden structures like the ones we had seen when we had fallen into the theater. I had no luck finding a door until I had gone in a nearly complete circle around the building. A grey box structure had been built out from one of the walls. A glowing red sign above the door read '*ON AIR*.' I approached and pushed on the handle. Thankfully, it was unlocked.

Stepping inside, the room was only as big as an apartment bedroom. There was a door immediately to the wall on my left, and next to it, an incredibly large machine. It had several screens on it and a control panel below full of glowing buttons. A dusty old computer chair waited to once again be used. I fulfilled its wish and looked at the screens.

It was easy to realize what they showed. This was because I had just been there. Each monitor displayed a different room of the faux house. I saw the kitchen I had seen moments ago, as well as the playroom and the activity room. The monitor that read nursery was pitch black showing only the light through the doors below the camera. However, there were three other places I hadn't seen yet. One was a library as exaggerated as the rest of the house, with books far too big for an average person. Another was a bathroom with a bathtub the size of a swimming pool and a single toilet in the corner.

The last room made my heart sink.

The monitor read "Nap Nook," and within, I could see the birds roaming about; at least eight of them. There were also creatures we hadn't seen yet. Small puppets laying on mats, not moving, presumably asleep. They looked just like little furry Muppets, and each one was a different color. A few would occasionally lift their heads and peak off to the corner of the room, but one of the birds would step over to them, and they would quickly lay back down. I looked off to where they had been staring, and a wave of relief flushed the anxiety from my body. In the corner, behind a white picket fence, were Bea, Ethan, and Daniel. A sign above them read '*Timeout Corner*'. Each of them lay there like the puppets, but I could tell they were awake. I watched Bea as she lay curled on the floor and felt my heart sink. I had to get them out before something terrible happened. I was lucky they were even still alive.

I looked around the screen and saw a door at the back of the room, opposite them. Sneaking in wouldn't be an option right now. As my eyes scanned the screen, they suddenly caught a color that stuck out from the rest of the small puppets on the mats. The tone of skin.

The person lay there, staring over at the cage intently. From the angle of the camera, I could see his face. His hair was long, and he looked skinny and sick, but I immediately knew who it was. I had to see his face every day for nearly 3 years.

Larry.

I couldn't believe it. I was almost sure he had died. Had he been down here the whole time? Living with these things? I felt sick inside. Somehow him being dead would have been better. Seeing him now, though, that made it a lot harder. Especially after what we did... It was clear from the way he looked at Daniel and the others that he remembered as well. How could he forget?

"Uh-oh." He suddenly said behind me. "That looks like a problem, Brother."

I didn't respond. Just stared.

"Hey, don't feel too bad about it. He brought this on himself, after all."

He paced around the room and looked at a sign on the wall that I hadn't noticed. It showed one of the birds with its arms outstretched and read, 'Mama Bird's Family Funhouse!'

"Hmm. What an awful show idea. I'll bet the guy who came up with that was really proud too." He looked back at me and laughed, "What's wrong? You should be happy. Your friends are safe."

"No, they aren't. They're trapped in there with those things."

"Oh, calm down. You don't even know their intentions. Looks like ol' Larry there has lived fine alongside them. Maybe now is your chance to leave the kids at daycare and go find that exit yourself."

"Shut up."

"Oh, that's right. You've got a princess to save."

"I'm going to save all of them."

"But only one of them really matters to you."

"You're wrong."

"Am I? I can't tell for sure. Your past actions haven't exactly made it crystal clear."

"What are you even talking about? I love Ethan; he's like a brother to me. Daniel too."

"You know exactly what I'm talking about. Before this place? What's funny is you said that same 'like a brother' shit to me too and yet still..."

I felt a jolt of pain and shame through my body and looked to the floor.

"Eh, don't beat yourself up over it. Just ignore it as you do with everything else. Convince yourself that you're the hero in all of this."

"I'm sorry..."

He laughed, "Ha. Don't tell *me* that. You should have told him that. Maybe then you wouldn't have ended up here.

"What's that supposed to mean?"

"Don't worry about it. You had a lot more baggage to worry about even before you did what you did. I'm sure you would have ended up on that bus all the same."

"What... What are you?"

"Does it matter? Maybe I'm a ghost. Maybe I'm just a mental manifestation of guilt. I'd still haunt you either way."

"Yeah..."

"Well, good luck with your Alcatraz mission, brother. I'm sure you'll need it."

He swung open the door and stepped outside, letting the darkness engulf Him. I just sat there for a while, staring at the screen and thinking. I watched my friends as they lay helplessly in their cage. I stared at Ethan, who clutched his arm tightly. The arm he had injured trying to save me. I looked at Daniel, who had followed me down here even though he didn't have to. While he would have either way, I knew it was because he wanted to keep me safe. I looked at Bea, who cared about me so much that she was willing to jump onto a monster's back to save me. To tell me to leave when she thought for sure they were going to die. Was she just another one that I...?

I pushed the thoughts deep down. No time to think about that right now, I told myself. My lifelong mantra.

"Keep moving," I muttered. I stood from the chair and crossed toward the other door. Unlike the first one, it was polished wood. A sign had been hung that warned against entering during recordings. I placed my hand on the knob anyways. "You gotta keep moving..."
