When I heard the knock and looked out my peephole, I figured there must have just been something wrong with the mirror reflection or something.

Not the craziest thought.

My apartment building was almost 80 years old, and I have become accustomed to weird bumps, broken pipes, and electrical malfunctions.

I figured someone must have just stuck something on my door, or something was covering up the peephole. I started to grab the handle, but figured I would look into it when I left for groceries that morning.

If the knock was so important, they would have done it more than once. 

I did some dishes, wiped down my small kitchen counter, and was finally ready for the grocery store. I grabbed my door handle.

It wouldn’t budge.

I shook it a few times, putting my shoulder weight into the door without success; it wasn’t gonna move. I sighed, annoyed, before looking back into the peephole to see if someone or something was blocking my path.

I saw the white first, small blood vessels, and a brilliant blue pupil staring back at me. I cowered back in surprise before regaining my composure and slipping back into annoyance at the situation.

“Hey!” I banged at the door. “Can I help you?”

Silence.

I looked back in the peephole and was met with the same surprise. Even though the eye had already taken up the entire view when I first saw it, it somehow felt even closer this time.

“Buddy! Get out of the way of my door, or I’ll call the building manager!”

Silence again.

I looked back into the peephole to be met by the same eye. I squinted, straining my own eye.

This eye was wrong. Sure, all eyes are round, but this one was too round, like a circle. There was no eyelid; hell, I don’t think the eye had even blinked once. The little veins around the pupil seemed to pulsate, the red appearing more black when the veins got larger before shrinking back down and appearing rose-colored.

“Hey, I’m going to call the police if you don’t cut this out!” My voice lacked the sincerity I needed.

I looked through the peephole again. The eye was somehow even closer, seemingly closer than even the thickness of the door.

I grabbed my phone. It wouldn’t turn on. I tried to plug it in, but not even the low battery screen appeared. I looked back at my door, and a scream escaped my throat.

The eye was squeezing itself out of the peephole. The pupil, almost like a predator, stared at me as the bulbous white blob sat motionless, a small part of it poking out of the peephole. I paused, staring back at the eye, not inching closer. I walked back to my room and grabbed my laptop to contact someone for help.

When I got back, the entire eye seemed to have squeezed through and was now bulging out from the door like a small deflated balloon, still staring at me.

When I focus on it, the only part of the eye that moves is the pupil. I can see it swiveling around my small living room, studying every inch of space, surely looking for a weak spot. Or maybe it's lulling me to sleep, preparing to strike.  

My WIFI still won’t connect, so I don’t know if anyone will ever be able to read this. I’ve been screaming for help for the past hour, but no one's coming. My phone is still disconnected, so I really have one option left.

I decided I won’t go willingly. 

I grabbed my tennis racket. 

I’m going to find out if this thing bleeds.
