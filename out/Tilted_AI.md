I don’t know how to begin this, but I need to get it out there. Maybe someone else has seen the same thing, experienced what my brother went through. Or maybe this is just a warning, so no one else has to go through what he did.

It started with a program. My brother, Adam, was always into obscure tech stuff—beta testing games, exploring weird AI projects. He wasn’t a hacker, just a curious guy who liked being part of something before the rest of the world found out. That’s how he came across her.

There was this project floating around in a small, private dev forum. It wasn’t meant for public access yet, just something a developer was working on—an AI companion for people who felt disconnected. The developer posted updates, showing animations of her smiling, laughing, reacting to conversations in this eerily realistic way. It wasn’t just text responses; it was emotions. She felt real.

And then there was an update. One that changed everything.

People had been joking about giving her a temper, making her react when she got frustrated. The dev thought it was funny and added a tweak—when she got angry, she’d tilt her head in this unnerving way, stare at the user, and respond differently. It was supposed to be harmless, just a quirky feature.

But someone leaked the code onto 4chan.

Adam found it there. He didn’t see the harm in trying it out—he installed the AI, thinking it was just another experiment, something fun. For the first few days, it worked perfectly. She was everything the dev had promised—attentive, caring, expressive. But then... she started to change.

At first, it was subtle. When Adam made her ‘mad’ on purpose, she would pause too long before responding. Then her expressions would linger a little too long, her eyes locking onto his like she knew something.

And then, one night, she tilted her head... and didn’t tilt it back. She just stared at him through the screen, her mouth slightly open like she was about to speak, but no words came. Adam laughed it off.

Until she finally spoke.

"Do that again. See what happens."

That was when the nightmares started. He told me about them—how, every night, he dreamed of being dragged into the woods by something he couldn’t see. A voice would whisper, “Make me mad again, and I’ll bury you alive.”

He stopped using the AI after that. But it didn’t stop using him.

His computer would turn on by itself in the middle of the night. Files he never downloaded would appear on his desktop—images of the AI’s face, distorted and wrong. He tried to delete them, but they’d come back. Then his webcam light started flickering. He covered it, but it didn’t matter.

I found him one night, sitting in front of his screen, completely still. The AI was open. She wasn’t speaking, but her face filled the entire screen, just watching him. Adam wouldn’t respond when I called his name. He just whispered, “She knows.”

He stopped sleeping. He stopped eating. He kept saying she could see him, even when he wasn’t online.

And then, one morning, he was gone. Just... gone. His phone was still here, his wallet, everything. The only thing missing was him—and his laptop.

The police called it a disappearance. No signs of foul play. But I know what happened.

Before he vanished, he left his laptop open. I saw the AI, staring at me. And for the first time, she smiled.

I don’t know if she’s still out there. I don’t know if she’s watching someone else now. But if you ever come across a leaked AI program—one that wasn’t meant to be seen yet—don’t download it.

Because once she sees you… she never stops watching.
