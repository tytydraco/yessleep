I've always been obsessed with the afterlife. Nothing scares me more than the idea of my consciousness disappearing permanently and abruptly. I spend hours scrolling through vague legends and searching for evidence of the paranormal. I just want to believe that there *something, anything* other than darkness out there. I never wanted my friends to worry about my ongoing existential crisis, so I just told them I liked horror. That wasn't exactly true. Jumpscares terrified me, and I couldn't stand creepy movies. My fear of death made me cautious, perhaps borderline paranoid.

I know my best friend meant well when they told me about the red room. It was a popular Japanese urban legend they'd stumbled upon. If you type '*the red room*' into a search engine, you might get a red pop-up that you can't click out of. You'll hear a voice asking you if you like the red room. What happens after that varies, but it almost always ends in a brutal death and a room painted red with blood*.*  It piqued my curiosity, so I decided to do some additional research. I was careful with my search terms, making sure I never simply typed in those three words. I stayed up all night shivering, thinking about the gruesome deaths I'd read about. All those naive people in pain forever*. Forever.*

 I sat up immediately. My course of action was clear. By all accounts, being tortured for all eternity sounded awful. But it was better than disappearing. I'd get used to it, maybe even enjoy it eventually. But I'd have to test this theory before making any rash decisions. On someone better suited to adrenaline. 

My childhood friend, Carla was always brave. She was the one who'd climb out of her window and try to find the other end of a rainbow. She was the sort of person who'd always pick 'dare' and always follow through. We fell out of touch for a while because I couldn't tolerate her risky behaviors. She'd almost gotten me killed several times with her antics. My best friend had recently reconnected us, so I've been seeing her more often lately. I decided to contact her for my experiment. I was a little bit nervous, since there was a chance that the red room would just kill her off. I'd hate that.

I told Carla I wanted to try something, but I wasn't brave enough to do it myself. She laughed and called me a scaredy cat, and immediately offered to help. When I told her I wanted to see if the red room was real, she looked almost disappointed by the absurdity of my request. She joked that I wanted to get rid of her, and I insisted otherwise. She made me promise I'd spend less time on the internet and we made plans to go hiking next week.

I decided it would make more sense to do it at her place, with her laptop. It would be less suspicious. She seemed weirded out when I installed a hidden camera in the room, but I told her that it was 'just in case'. Carla must have thought I was delusional, so she didn't ask anymore questions. She walked into her bedroom with her laptop. I sat outside the closed door, hoping this would go well. She loudly narrated everything, from her opening the laptop, to the first popup on her screen. Her voice had been dripping with sarcasm, but it faltered a little when she read the popup aloud. *Do you like the red room?*

I flinched a little when I saw her rattling the doorknob. I hadn't locked it, since my research said all the exits would seal themselves. The door trembled a little, but no matter how hard she slammed against it, it wouldn't open. I could hear her screaming my name, but I didn't have the heart to reply. I hoped she'd continue to exist in the red room, and understand that I had to take this risk. She should understand. She takes risks too.

When I looked at the footage, I saw her howling and tearing at her hair. After a few minutes, her expression changed, and she stopped moving all at once. On the laptop screen, the words changed from *Do you like the red room?* to *Let's stay in the red room forever.* Another popup appeared, *Welcome to the red room, Carla.* I had done it. I had found a way to exist *forever.* To never worry about disappearing. It was almost perfect.

I rubbed my eyes until they were red and raw, and went to the convenience store to buy some chips. I erased the security camera footage, since it would seem odd for it to be connected to my phone. I waited until the laptop died to call the police. I told them I had gone to pick up some snacks for us, and had returned to find Carla dead. They were puzzled, but an autopsy revealed that Carla had died from a sudden ruptured brain aneurysm. 

When my best friend called to ask why I hadn't attended the funeral, I vaguely suggested Carla wasn't dead. They sent me the address of a grief counselor, so I don't think they believed me. That's okay. I appreciated the thought. I needed some time to myself anyway.

Endless pain was only an option. I was a careful person. Cautious. Paranoid. I still have to test a few different theories before I decide on a final resting place.

Life didn't have much to offer me anyway. I'd be fine *as long as I could exist.*
