The first demon came in the middle of our living room while I was sleeping with a knife to kill us, but then he saw his reflection on one side of the mirror so now he's trapped behind it forever."

"Oh no!" said Sam. "I've heard about those kind of things from other people too; they're called evil mirrors or devil doors. They can be very dangerous if you don't know how to use them properly. But what does this have anything to do with your dad?"

The little girl shrugged her shoulders. Her mother put an arm around her shoulder as she continued telling their story: "When my husband got home after work tonight, there were these two men standing outside waiting for him who told him not to go back inside because something terrible had happened—they could see it through the windows. He went into the house anyway just like any normal person would do when confronted by such strange circumstances…and then…" She paused again before continuing: "Then suddenly he disappeared! We thought maybe someone kidnapped him out front, but once we realized that wasn't true, my daughter and I ran upstairs and found this mirror hidden under some old clothes in the closet. It must have been here since Dad bought this place years ago."

Sam nodded along as though she understood exactly what this woman meant, which was mostly accurate except for one small detail. A mirror is nothing more than glass with reflective properties. There isn't anything magical about them unless it happens to contain a supernatural creature. And even then, the creatures themselves aren't usually aware of being seen until provoked. Demons don't need mirrors to find prey. In fact, many demonic entities prefer to manifest directly onto human bodies instead of using reflections.

This makes sense given that most humans possess only limited abilities to detect or perceive them otherwise.
But the way this child talked made Sam think she knew better. So did the look in her eyes as well. Whatever the case, the image painted by the mother was enough to convince Sam. These weren't ordinary demons. If the woman wanted to believe they were simply a result of an overactive imagination, fine. But Sam didn't buy it. Not for one second.

She took another sip of water and set down the cup on top of her notes. "Okay," she began carefully. "Let me ask you both a few questions. First off, where is your father right now? Did either of you ever actually see him leave the house?"
Both parents looked at each other uncomfortably before answering. Then the mom answered: "No, honey. No, we haven't. We assumed he left earlier today to run errands or meet up with friends, but then we couldn't contact him later in the day so we started looking everywhere—"
"—like you should have done long before now," interrupted Sam. "You might want to check the basement. That's always the best bet when trying to track someone down.

 You never know what kinds of places they may hide."
"We checked downstairs already," said the wife. "He hasn't gone anywhere else besides work lately. What are we supposed to do next?"
As much as Sam hated to admit it, this couple really seemed clueless. Maybe it was unfair of her to judge them based upon the information provided, but sometimes that's how life works. People make assumptions without knowing all the facts, especially when it comes to matters concerning magic. Or perhaps she was being too harsh. After all, ignorance is rarely bliss when dealing with the unknown.

That reminded her of something she'd read recently about a young man who died horribly because he tried to fight fire with gasoline. His name was Michael Jackson. Even though he hadn't known anything about witchcraft, he still paid dearly for believing everything he saw in movies. As far as she knew, there was no such thing as fighting evil with evil, although it sounded like this woman and her daughter believed differently. Either way, she needed to get out of here soon before something bad happened. Time was running short.

While she waited for the door to open, Sam pulled her cell phone out and dialed 911. Once the call connected, she explained what she witnessed and requested immediate assistance. Fortunately, dispatch agreed and promised to send help immediately. Sam hung up and turned to the family. "Listen, I'm going to take care of this situation myself. You'll probably hear sirens coming within minutes. Don't worry; they won't bother you anymore. Just stay calm and wait for police to arrive. Everything will be okay."

They stared at her blankly. The little girl asked, "Are you sure everything will be okay?"
"Yes. Absolutely. Now please excuse me while I deal with this matter personally. Oh, and if you happen to wake up during the night, try to remember whatever you saw in the mirror. Write it down quickly before you forget it. Okay? Good luck. Have a nice evening." With that, Sam walked away and headed toward the stairs leading to the cellar.
Down below, Sam entered the large, dusty room filled with cobwebs, spiders, and dust bunnies. At least she hoped they were merely imaginary. Otherwise, she wouldn't survive the experience. When she reached the center of the floor, she stopped and faced the wall opposite the staircase.

Slowly, she closed her eyes and focused. Within seconds, she felt herself drifting forward. Like a ghost moving across the earth. One moment she was solid, the next she became insubstantial. Floating.
A cold wind blew against her face as she floated upward. Clouds swirled above her head as though she were walking beneath a tornado. Lightning flashed overhead. Thunder crashed nearby. From somewhere deep inside her mind came the faintest whisper of sound: 'Darkness falls.'

And then the clouds parted. Out beyond them stretched the familiar landscape she had grown accustomed to seeing every time she used her gift. Trees, hillsides covered in wildflowers and grasses, rivers winding between rocks and cliffs, mountains towering high above her. All of it bathed in the golden glow of late afternoon sunlight. Except for one small detail. Something was missing.

It was a simple thing. Almost unnoticeable. But it was also wrong. Very, very wrong. Without warning, the ground gave way underneath her feet. She fell downward. Downward into darkness. Into hell itself.

The smell of rotting flesh assaulted her nose as she plummeted down the steps. On the bottom step lay a dead body wearing a dirty white shirt stained red with blood. Next to him stood another corpse holding a bloody knife. Both corpses were naked. Their faces frozen in horror as death claimed their lives.

Behind them, Sam glimpsed several others lying motionless on the dirt floor. Some appeared to be asleep. Others were clearly unconscious. Each one possessed a different expression. Fear. Confusion. Horror. Despair.
Some were children.

In the distance, Sam caught sight of movement. Two figures dressed in black robes emerged from the shadows and moved closer to her position on the stairway landing. They were tall, thin beings with pale skin. Black hair flowed freely over their heads, concealing the lower portion of their faces entirely. Dark hoods hid their features completely, leaving only mouths visible as they spoke words of pure evil: "Why have you disturbed our rest? Who are you that dares disturb us?"

Their voices echoed throughout the entire underground chamber. Sam recognized their speech patterns as belonging to necromancers—those who practice the art of raising the dead. Necromancer rituals often involve summoning spirits, binding them to physical vessels, and feeding them human souls. Although it was rare, certain practitioners occasionally ventured further into darker territory. Possession was common among those who sought power over the forces of darkness.

For example, this particular pair of necromancers might be able to raise a spirit capable of possessing a human body. Such a possession could prove useful considering that demons tend to manifest physically rather than mentally. By entering a victim's mind and taking control of their actions, a demon could easily assume a form that allowed it to pass undetected by the average person.
With her heart pounding in her chest, Sam stepped backward towards the stairs leading to freedom. The last thing she wanted was for these creatures to catch her unaware while she slept in bed, safe and sound at home. She'd learned firsthand that dreams can be quite deceptive. Sometim, s nightmares lurk just around the corner of reality waiting patiently to pounce on unsuspecting victims.

Without thinking, she cast a glance behind her toward the dead bodies lying prone upon the floor. Most likely, they had been tortured beforehand, killed with blades, and drained of blood. This suggested that they belonged to people whose families lived near here, possibly close to town. Whoever they were, they deserved justice. Someone should pay for this atrocity committed against innocent citizens.

Her gaze returned to the necromancers. They approached slowly with arms held outstretched as though ready to grab hold of her. She kept retreating until she reached the top step and then turned back toward the main entrance. Ahead of her, a wooden door led into the hallway outside. She hesitated briefly before deciding to proceed.

At first glance, the room looked like any other basement storage area. Shelves lined the walls containing various tools of varying sizes. Heavy chains hanging from hooks were suspended from the ceiling. Wood tables, chairs, and benches sat neatly arranged along the perimeter. Racks full of rusted weapons were stacked haphazardly against the rear wall, creating a makeshift arsenal.

There was nothing particularly unusual about this scene until Sam noticed the piles of bones scattered throughout the room. Bones of all shapes and colors littered the floor like broken toys left behind by careless children playing in a sand box. Many bore holes through their skulls or ribs, indicating the presence of sharp objects driven straight into the bone tissue. Several of the larger skeletons were piled together in a pile resembling a pyramid, suggesting they might have once formed part of a ritual sacrifice. Other smaller ones remained undisturbed. Perhaps they had fallen to the floor after being dropped accidentally during some kind of ceremony performed elsewhere in the building.

Most disturbing, however, was the odor wafting from the air. It was strong yet somehow familiar. Bitter. Sour. Unpleasant. And it lingered despite having dissipated somewhat since its initial arrival. While it wasn't nearly as overpowering as it had originally been, it still managed to reach Sam's nostrils and fill her lungs.

This must be where they stored human remains, she thought. Human sacrifices, to be exact. And judging from the state of decay evident on many of these bones, they had lain here for months, maybe years. Yet none of them showed signs of decomposition, which would suggest they were fresh. More importantly, whoever owned this place obviously didn't understand the importance of proper burial practices for the deceased. Which begged the question, why not? Why allow these poor souls to rot instead of burying them properly? Wasn't that more disrespectful than simply throwing them into a mass grave where they could become food for worms and maggots?

Sam continued backing away until she finally found the courage to turn and run for the front door. Her foot slipped slightly on the wet stone floor, sending her tumbling onto her butt. Cursing under breath, she got up and hurried toward the exit. A loud crash erupted from behind as something heavy slammed down hard atop an old wooden table. The noise drew everyone's attention as five figures suddenly appeared in the doorway. Four men wearing black robes and masks, plus one woman in a flowing gown sporting shoulder-length blonde hair. She wore a necklace made of gold rings, bracelets, and earrings dangling from both ears. In addition, she carried two daggers strapped to either side of her waist.
She glanced at Sam and smiled. "Well met, my dear child. Welcome to your new home."

The sun rose bright and early the following morning. and sam begins her new journey of finding out how this woman was her mother and what caused her to do what she did.
