A dark place. That's where I loved to be. It made me feel safe and helped hide my secret.

But it wasn't a normal secret like kissing a girlfriend in a closet or trying to take sexy pictures of myself.

No, I didn't care for that. What I cared about was smoking a cigarette, which was actually what I was doing.

The closet where I was hiding smelled like cigarette smoke, and I coughed hard because of that smoke.

I then sighed softly, thinking about how I got to this point. I never wanted to smoke.

But everywhere I had been or gone, I saw people smoking, and one day I figured out I should try it for myself.

And that's where the problems began. Instead of buying groceries or important stuff, I would buy cigarettes of any kind I could lay my hands on.

Just then, the closet door swung open, and my mother, a nice blonde-haired lady, stood there with a dark glare on her face and her arms crossed.

"Jackson, what on earth are you doing?" My mother snapped at me.

I looked away from my mother. I didn't want to tell her, and I knew she already knew.

Mom then grabbed me from under the arm before taking me out of the closet and marching me into the living room.

Then mom threw me onto the couch, and she ripped the cigarette out of my hand and blew it out.

"I thought we agreed you wouldn't do this anymore," Mom said, holding up the cigarette.

But I knew I couldn't stop because I had been smoking ever since my dad died.

When I was eighteen, my dad had died in a car crash, and I felt horrible seeing my mother upset and knowing that my dad wouldn't see me grow up anymore.

"Jackson, you're twenty-one years old and you're still freaking smoking. You know, I hate the house smelling like smoke," Mom snapped at me.

"Well, you shouldn't have let dad drive the car when he was drunk!" I shouted at her.

Mom gasped at what I had said, and she even seemed shocked.

I then got up from the couch and headed out of the room. Mom followed behind me, explaining that she was sorry for what she said.

But I didn't care. All I did was just shrug her off, saying I would be home later, and then I walked out the front door, slamming the door behind myself.

"It's not your fault, Jackson, none of it is," I mumbled under my breath as I walked down the street.

I then headed to the park. It had a place in my heart, a dark place because it's where I had my first cigarette.

The day seemed clear in my mind. Me and a couple of friends were hanging out in the park when one of them broke out a pack of cigarettes.

When they asked if I wanted one, I said no at first, but then, after some peer pressure, I took one and started smoking it.

The first time I sucked in the smoke, it made me cough, and my friends laughed at me.

But after that first one, I got used to it, and then all the rest was history.

When I sat down on a bench, I pulled out my pack of cigarettes from my jacket pocket.

"Shit," I hissed when I realized the cigarette pack was empty.

I then remembered I had used that last one when I was sitting in the closet, so instead I just decided to sit on the bench and let the outdoor noises fill my ears.

Maybe my life would be better if I wasn't alive.

Maybe my mom would be happier if I had died along with Dad.

A few hours later, I stood up and decided to head home, but first I wanted to stop by the store and grab another pack.

As I was walking, I suddenly stopped and looked up. I noticed I was standing in front of a small grocery store.

Without another word, I walked into the store and looked around. It was dusty and old-looking inside.

I noticed there were spider webs in the corners, and then I thought I saw a rat run past my feet.

When I got to the front counter, I noticed no one was there, but I noticed there was a silver bell sitting there.

"Hello?!" I shouted out loud.

No one answered, so I hit the bell, ringing it. Then I waited. Suddenly, an older man appeared from nowhere.

"Welcome to supernatural stuff. I'm your wonderful shopkeeper, Mr. Knight. How may I help you, young man?" The man grinned and asked.

I didn't say anything; I was just looking at the man. He had black and gray hair, and one eye was completely white, and he was wearing all black.

"Um, do you have any cigarettes?" I asked nervously.

"Yes, I do," Mr. Knight replied with a smile.

A few seconds later, Mr. Knight placed a pack of cigarettes in front of me, which I picked up.

The box was white and gold, and then I noticed in bold black letters the word "pleasure" on the front of the box, right in the middle.

"Do you like them?" Mr. Knight asked in a mysterious voice.

I just nodded, then reached into my pocket and pulled out my wallet, ready to pay the man.

"Oh no, young man, they are free of charge. "Just think of it as a gift from me to you," Mr. Knight said, holding up his hands.

"I don't have to pay you." I asked him, confused.

"No, you don't, young man, but I would wait until you get home to use them," Mr. Knight said.

I nodded before looking down to put the cigarettes in my pocket, and when I looked up, Mr. Knight was gone.

"Huh, where did he go?" I mumbled under his breath.

But I didn't think about it, and then I headed home thinking about what had happened in that store.

When I got home, I heard people talking and laughing, and I growled under my breath.

My mom's friends were over, and they were probably chatting and drinking tea like they always did.

So I headed to my room, where I shut the door behind myself and sat on the edge of my bed.

I pulled out the strange cigarettes, looking at them, wondering what Mr. Knight meant by what he said.

I opened the pack and pulled out a cigarette. And I noticed it looked like a normal one, which confused me.

I then lit the cigarette and started smoking with it. When I blew the smoke out of my mouth, I noticed it was black.

"Huh?" I mumbled under my breath.

I then coughed hard and rolled my eyes, and then I started smoking it, and a minute later, I was done.

I sighed softly, thinking about going downstairs to see my mom's friends, but I didn't want them to smell smoke on me.

Suddenly, I felt tired. I looked up. My brain felt like it was going numb, and I looked at the pack that was sitting next to me on the bed.

"I need another one," I said without emotion in my voice.

When I blinked, I jumped off the bed, breathing heavily. The box of cigarettes was lying all over the ground.

I then placed a hand on my chest and noticed that I felt like a zombie for a short time, which made me feel worried.

Just then there was a knock on my bedroom door, and I gasped before I started picking up the cigarettes.

"Honey, are you doing ok?" I heard Mom ask me.

I didn't say anything after I picked the box and all the cigarettes up. I hid them in my sock drawer before my mom could come in.

Then I opened his bedroom door and smiled weakly at Mom, who stood there looking worried.

"H-hi Mom, "Are you ok?"Are you ok?" I asked, smiling again at her.

"I came to ask you if you were OK. "Did you calm down?" Mom asked me.

I nodded and yawned. I felt tired and then rubbed my eyes, wanting to fall asleep.

"Honey, are you sure you're doing well?" "You look really tired," Mom asked, sounding concerned.

"Mom, chill. I'm fine. "Maybe I just need to get some shut-eye and I'll feel better in the morning," I explained to mom.

Without another word, I closed my bedroom door and kicked my shoes off, then fell asleep in my bed with my clothes still on.

A few hours later, I bolted upright and looked around, confused at first, and then I rubbed my eyes.

It was dark inside my room and dark outside. I grabbed my phone, which was on my nightstand, and looked at the time.

It was three in the morning, which made me confused and made the phone fall out of my hand.

"I slept for that long." I mumbled under my breath.

Then I thought about going downstairs to eat something or getting a glass of water to wash it down my throat.

I then got out of bed and headed downstairs, noticing that Mom was sleeping in her room too.

I then got into the kitchen, turned the small overhead light on, and turned on the sink faucet, getting myself a glass of water.

"Jackson," a voice behind me said.

I turned around with the glass in my hand. I was expecting to see Mom standing there, but no one was there.

Suddenly, I heard something breathing heavily behind me, and I felt confused.

"Don't you want another one?" A voice whispered in his ear.

I jumped out of fear and dropped the glass on the ground, which caused it to shatter.

A few seconds later, I heard footsteps, and Mom ran into the room and stopped when she saw the glass all over the floor.

"Jackson McCormick, what on earth did you do?" mom shouted.

"I don't know; I was just getting a glass of water, and then something whispered into my ear, and then I dropped the glass," I explained, looking around.

The next morning, I was sitting on the couch. I had an argument with mom about the glass, and when I told her what happened, she didn't believe me.

"What happened last night?" I mumbled under my breath while rubbing the back of my neck.

I heard mom talking on the phone, probably with one of her friends, and I sighed quietly.

Then, without another word, I stood up and headed out of the house and headed to my spot in the park.

I took out one of the pleasure cigarettes and examined it, attempting to figure out how it worked.

I started trying to break it or unroll it, but I stopped. I had the same feeling wash over me the first time I smoked one of those cigarettes.

"I can't hurt the product," I said in a dazed voice.

I looked at my hands, and then I stopped messing with the cigarette. I lit the cigarette, sticking it in my mouth like I always did.

I was smoking, looking at the ground, wondering what had happened to me last night, and I coughed hard again.

I stopped when I heard laughter. I looked up and noticed there was a little girl standing in front of me wearing all black.

"Hello Jackie, do you want to play with me?" She asked, grinning at me.

"I just-" I cut myself off and started staring at the girl.

Suddenly, the little girl started laughing. At first, it was cute. Then it started getting darker and more evil.

Then the girl coughed, and she threw up black goo, which was coming out of her mouth and nose.

She then lunged at me, which caused me to scream in fear, and I fell off the bench and landed on the ground.

The girl was on top of me. Her eyes were completely black now, and the black liquid was running down her face and out of the corners of her mouth.

The black liquid was dripping onto me, and some landed on my cheek, which caused me to scream in pain because it was hot.

"Only one a day, remember that!" the girl hissed at me.

More black liquid landed on my face, and I cried out in fear, telling the girl to stop and to leave me alone, but she just kept laughing darkly.

More black liquid hit my face, and I cried out in pain; then the little girl giggled, and when I opened my eyes, the girl was gone.

I immediately jumped up, dusted myself off, and rubbed my cheek. It hurt, and I knew it hurt.

I then ran home, and when I got into my house, I leaned against the wall, breathing heavily.

I hoped mom was still at work, but she walked into the front hall, and she was wearing an apron, which confused me.

"Jackson, where did you go?" Mom asked and looked confused.

I didn't say anything. I noticed there was flour on mom's apron, and I tried to cover the burnt part of my cheek.

"Oh my God, what happened to your cheek?" Mom cried out, running over to me.

My mother grabbed me by the face and gently touched the burned area. I groaned under my breath, and Mom looked worried.

"Mom," I said, looking at her.

But mom wasn't listening; she was trying to fix the accident that had happened on my cheek.

I tried to get Mom's attention, but it didn't worry her. She was complaining to me about my accident.

"Mom, leave me alone!" I shouted, shoving Mom away from me.

"Jackson, what on earth are you doing?" Mom asked.

"What are you doing?" I'm not a baby anymore. Stop treating me like one. "I'm fine, and I've already told you I'm fine!" I shouted at her.

I headed for the stairs, and Mom followed behind me, talking without stopping.

"Mom, shut up!" I yelled at her so loudly that it hurt my throat.

I then headed to my room and slammed the door before sitting on my bed, and I growled under my breath.

Just then, the door was thrown open, and Mom was standing there with a glare on her face.

Before I could say anything, Mom walked over to me and grabbed me by the ear, which caused me to cry out in shock.

"We are going to the doctor, you man, and you aren't going to argue with me or I'm grounding you until you're sixty!" Mom shouted.

Then she took me outside and shoved me into the car, and I noticed mom somehow didn't have her apron on.

"Please, Mom—" I was cut off when Mom glared at me.

And I looked away as we were driving. I looked out the window, rubbing my burned cheek. I was trying to think of who that little girl was.

Both of us were in the main doctor's office area a few minutes later, and I rubbed my aching ear.

Then I was called back into the checkup area, and mom told me she would stay back here and listen to the doctor.

When I got there, the assistant told me to wait in the room until the doctor came, and I nodded.

But right when the lady left, I got up and then ran out of the room and silently walked down the hall, hoping no one would see me.

I ran down the hall until I found a door open, and I ran into the room. I went into the empty checkup room, and then I shut the door and sat on the checkup bed.

"I can't take this anymore; I just can't," I said, breathing heavily.

I then stuck my hands in my jacket pocket, stopped, and then pulled something out of my pocket.

I opened his hand, and sitting in my palm was a pleasure cigarette.

"How the heck—I didn't have one in my pocket," I said in a shocked tone.

I reached into my other pocket and pulled out a hidden lighter. I knew it was mine because it had a basketball picture on the front.

"Do it," a voice hissed into my ear.

I then remembered what that little girl had said: only one a day.

I figured out that it must have meant only one of these strange cigarettes a day.

But I felt weary as I looked at the cigarette. My head started hurting, and I felt like passing out.

Suddenly, the door opened, and I looked up and saw a doctor standing there looking at a clipboard, and when she looked up, she saw me standing there.

"Who are you?" The lady asked me.

I jumped, and the cigarette flew out of my hand, and then I looked at the lady and didn't know what to say.

"Get her," a voice hissed into my ear.

Suddenly, I jumped at the doctor, and she screamed out in fear and shock.

But I covered her mouth and grinned at her. A dark grin crossed over my face.

"Be quiet; they won't care if you die," I said in a dazed voice.

I took my hand off the lady's mouth and then headed for her neck, starting to choke her.

"Please let me go, young man," the lady said, sounding worried.

Just then, the door burst open, and a few security guards and a different doctor were in the room.

I looked up at them, and everyone gasped in shock and surprise because they could see my eyes were completely black.

"Young man, stop this nonsense right now!" The other doctor shouted.

A few hours later, I was back home, lying in bed. I felt sick, and that's what the doctors told me, mom.

I had actually thrown up twice, and mom had made me hot tea to calm down my throat, but it only made me feel worse.

Mom came into my room to check my temperature, and she was shocked.

"You are burning up. I have no clue what is happening with you. Maybe you are getting a virus, and that's why you are acting so strange." Mom explained.

"Mom, there's something I need to tell you," I said, sounding weak.

"What is it, honey? Do you feel better?" Mom asked me.

"I actually--" I stopped and grabbed my head in pain.

I screamed in pain too, and Mom gasped and ran over to the side of the bed, telling me to calm down.

Then I calmed down, and I actually fell asleep, and my mother kissed me on the forehead and walked out of the room.

Then I suddenly woke up and jumped up, heading into the bathroom. I felt like I needed to throw up.

I got to my toilet, and then I let it out. When I was done, I wiped my mouth, and when I looked down, I gasped.

My mess was pure black, like the goo that had come out of the girl's mouth, and then I let it out again.

And then something else came out of my mouth, and I looked down into the toilet, and my eyes went wide in shock.

I pulled a tooth out of the toilet bowl, and I stood up. I felt inside my mouth and felt the missing spot where the tooth had come from.

"What the hell?" I said, sounding completely terrified.

I ran into my room and then noticed my drawer, and then I opened the sock drawer, and the cigarette box was gone.

I looked around and then noticed the cigarette box was on my bed, and I ran over to it, grabbing the box off the bed.

When I looked inside of it, I noticed there was only one left. I was shocked.

I then grabbed my lighter, and I had an idea. I headed downstairs and out of the house.

I didn't hear Mom shout my name, and then I stopped at the corner, and then I grabbed the cigarette.

"One more," I said, grinning darkly.

I then lit it and sucked the good stuff from the cigarette, and when I took it out of my mouth, I laughed loudly.

But it was a dark laugh coming from my mouth, and I didn't care. It felt too good to stop anything.

Then I threw down the cigarette and then stomped it out with my bare foot. I didn't care that it burned his foot.

I just stood there thinking about something, and I shoved the empty pack into my pocket.

"It's time," I mumbled under my breath.

I then noticed a big 18-wheeler was heading down the road near where I was.

And then, without thinking about it, I walked into the middle of the road and stood there with my back to the truck.

"Everyone will be happy," I said, feeling better about my life and everything else.

I heard the horn from the truck but didn't turn around or do anything else; I just stood there, ready to die.

Then I blacked out, and then I felt my mind and feelings slip away from me. I felt the ground beneath me, and I was probably dead or bleeding.

I groaned under my breath, and when I opened my eyes, I was staring at the ceiling, and the lights were blinding me.

"He's awake!" I heard someone shout.

When I opened my eyes, I saw my mother and two police officers standing there, smiling gently at me.

"What's going on?" I asked as I sat up in the hospital bed.

"You're lucky to be alive, young man. You apparently walked out into the middle of the street and almost got hit by a truck," one of the police officers said.

"And then the doctors and EMTs found a box of cigarettes on you called Pleasure," Mom said, sounding concerned.

I then told everyone in the room what had happened to me while messing with the pleasure cigarettes.

"Well, we actually found out that those cigarettes had an experimental drug in them and you were the first victim of it," the other cop explained.

A few days later, I was out of the hospital, and I was sitting in the living room of his house when I smiled.

I had actually quit smoking for the first time, and I actually felt happy, and then I looked over and saw Mom reading a book.

Then the doorbell rang, and both of us looked at each other, puzzled.

I got up and headed to the front door, and when I opened the door and looked around, no one was at the door.

I then looked down and noticed something on the ground. It was a bottle of wine, and I picked it up.

Glamour, the bottle said.

"Jack, who was at the door?" Mom asked.

The only sound heard was the sound of a wine bottle being opened.
