What we saw that night at my friend’s house… I’ll never forget it. It wasn’t something unexplainable. Not paranormal. That would have been almost comforting, in a way, knowing it came from outside our world, even if it was terrifying. But this… this was much more real.

It was a brutal winter during school break. We were sixteen and already hanging out almost every weekend at my friend’s place drinking and playing video games. Our favorite (and really stupid) pastime was penalty shootouts in FIFA, and every time someone got scored on, they had to take a shot of the cheapest vodka we could find.

Yeah, it was dumb, really stupid but we laughed our asses off. My best memories are in that room, far away at the end of my friend’s house right next to the laundry room and before the back porch. His mom couldn’t complain about the noise, and she had no clue how insanely much alcohol we were downing just for fun. Or so we thought. 

That night didn’t seem any different. I left my house and told my mom I was going over to Luke’s. She knew exactly what that meant, but she was… let’s say “selectively” permissive. She couldn’t stand to see me drink or smoke, but if I did it behind her back, suddenly it wasn’t a problem. On the way, I stopped by Mrs. Rosita’s corner store, the old lady that used to sell me cigarettes and booze even though she knew that I was still in high school. Same as always: a pack of smokes and the cheapest vodka they had.

I was the first to get to Luke’s. His mom gave me this quick side glance and a knowing smile when she heard the clink of the bottle against my keys in my backpack. She knew, but like my mom, she wasn’t going to get involved.

I went straight to the back room. Luke was already drinking a beer, God knows where he’d gotten it from, and playing a game that I thought was a shooter at first, but turned out to be horror. He had a hoodie on and a blanket that covered him completely; I could only see his head and hands, which struck me as a bit weird. Then again, that room, as much as we loved it, was freezing as hell. No heat. The window closed, but somehow the wind still found a way in. Inside there was just an old mattress on the floor, an even older TV, and our holy grail: the PlayStation 2.

Five minutes after I got there, we were already playing that stupid penalty-shot game. Meanwhile, we talked about the usual: girls, half-baked rumors, and other pointless crap sixteen-year-olds obsess over.

Now, I loved Luke, he was my best friend and I always was very supportive of him no matter what, but his relationship with his girlfriend was… odd. She was insanely jealous, to the point where even as a dumb teenager, I knew it was way over the line. She usually didn’t come to our hangouts, thank God. But every once in a while, she’d just show up out of nowhere, like she was hoping to catch Luke cheating.

We talked about it that night. He was fed up. I didn’t get why he didn’t just break up with her. He said if he didn’t answer a text within a minute, she’d call him. If he didn’t wake up before her to text “good morning,” she’d block him. Any interaction with a girl was enough to set her off. “The sex is good. Really good… though she’s into some weird stuff,” he said. I pushed him to explain. He was always the kind of guy to overshare and laugh about it but this time he was dead serious.

Anyway, the night went on like usual. The rest of the guys showed up, and the four of us played our penalty-shot game until the drinks ran out. It was late, but Rosita's was still open. The neighborhood was pretty quiet, but at that hour, you still had to keep your eyes open.

We all left our phones in the room. Luke said it was too cold to go, so the rest of us went and he stayed behind playing. As soon as we stepped outside, we saw Luke’s girlfriend at the gate, phone in hand, a small Hello Kitty backpack over her shoulder.

I unlocked the gate and let her in. She didn’t say a word to us, she hated all of us for reasons we never understood. Once we turned the corner, we started cracking up. She couldn’t have been weirder. And whatever was about to go down inside… it wasn’t going to be pretty.

We took our time getting back, just to avoid the awkwardness. But after half an hour, the cold was just unbearable, so we headed back anyway. No yelling, no voices. That was a relief. Maybe we’d dodged the drama.

When we got closer, though, we heard these… wet sounds. That’s the only way I can describe it. We thought we were about to walk in on some very awkward BJ, so, being the assholes we were, we crept up to the door, sneaking.

I flung the door open and we all froze. One of my friends ran to the back porch and threw up before he even made it outside.

Luke was lying shirtless on the old mattress. His torso and arms were covered in poorly healed wounds. Patches of skin were missing. Dry, leathery flesh… and fresh, raw muscle where a new chunk had just been taken from his forearm.

Next to him was his girlfriend. Chewing a strip of skin and muscle, her teeth sinking into it with a sick, gummy sound. She didn’t even stop when she saw us. She swallowed the piece, wiped her mouth with a cloth napkin from her Hello Kitty backpack, stood up, and left.

Luke begged us not to tell his mom. Said he was “handling it,” that she was dangerous, that he couldn’t just leave her. Somehow… we believed him. I think we were too shocked to think straight.

I didn’t see Luke much that winter. He stopped answering my Facebook messages. When school started again, we found out he’d moved to another city. Months later, he texted me and said he had no choice, he had to get as far from her as possible. We met up again eventually. We still hang out every now and then.

We never talk about it. He wants to leave it in the past. Pretend it didn’t happen. And honestly, I want that too. But I can’t erase that image from my mind. Or the sound. That sick, gummy chewing sound… of her eating that piece of flesh.
