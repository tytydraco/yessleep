The Field Beyond the Pond

I started using the tape recorder a few weeks ago.
Not for anything special. Just so I could remember.

I talk slow when I’m tired, and I’ve been tired a lot lately. The kind of tired that feels like gravity is heavier here than it is anywhere else. Not depressed or anything—I think I’m past that—but I’ve been waking up in different places. Not far, not dangerous, just… wrong.

Two nights ago, I woke up standing in the middle of the field. The one past the second pond, where the grass hits your knees and the frogs scream like they know something. I didn’t remember walking there. My clothes were wet. There were footprints behind me.

That’s when I started taping things down.
Just to keep my days from slipping.

“Alright. Um. I went into town today. Got gas, picked up some canned soup. Same guy was behind the counter as usual, but he wouldn’t look me in the eye. Not in a rude way. Just… like he was scared to. Maybe I looked off. I’ve been sweating more. Forgot my change. Anyway. I came home around four. Mitchell’s tractor came through the back trail around five-thirty. He waved. I waved back. Good day.”

Click.

The thing is, I played that back this morning and it doesn’t match.
There’s no gas receipt in my truck. No soup on the shelf.
And the trail behind the house? No tire tracks.

I thought maybe the tape got mixed up. But the time stamp’s right. I remember recording it. I remember Mitchell waving at me. I can still picture the sweat stains on his shirt—like a butterfly spreading under his arms.

But when I went over there just now, his house was empty.
Not like he was gone for the day—empty.
Like no one had lived there in a long time.

Dust on the porch swing. A layer of green across the windows.
Mail from 2021 stacked in the box, soggy and soft.

I walked back slow. Around the pond. Water moving like it always does, the way it feeds from the spring. I passed the second pond. Stood at the edge of the field. I could feel the wind move the grass, but none of it felt right.

I sat on the bench where Grandpa used to smoke and drink his coffee.
There’s no one here but me.
There’s always been just me.

But I don’t believe that.

“Someone’s walking down the driveway. I can hear the gravel. It’s slow, like… like they don’t want to be heard. I don’t know who’d be out here this late. I’m turning off the light now. I’m just gonna wait. See who it is.”

Long pause. Then:

“…He’s stopped. Just standing there. Right at the edge of the circle.”

Click.

I don’t remember recording that.
But it’s my voice.
And when I stepped outside this morning, there were bare footprints in the gravel, heading toward the house.

Not away.
Toward.
