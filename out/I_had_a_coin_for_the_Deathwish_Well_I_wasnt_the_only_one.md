Jordan and I got home a little after sunset, sopping wet and muddy up to our knees. We should have been more careful as we walked inside. Usually, we were smart enough to quiet our voices and take off our dirty shoes on the front porch, but our afternoon at the well had filled us with a strange recklessness, a feeling of invulnerability. 

At the sound of our father’s voice, all of that fell away. 

Once again, we became boys, cold and dripping wet, suddenly conscious of the mess we’d brought into the house.

“Where the hell have you been?” he asked, his words slurred enough to let us know this would be no minor punishment.

“Hiking,” said Jordan weakly. 

And then a bottle flew across the room and exploded beside his head. My father was walking toward us, fists clenched. Jordan was shouting. I think I was screaming. At some point, my dad started hitting him. 

And then… it’s blank for me. 

I don’t remember any more.

Later, after my dad had passed out, I helped Jordan pick out a stray piece of glass from the bottom of his heel. His skin was wet and wrinkled from spending so long in his wet shoes, and it made the glass hard to extract. Every time I pinched at it with tweezers, Jordan winced. 

“I’m sorry,” I said after another failed attempt.

“It’s fine if it hurts,” he said. “Just don’t let the glass break. Take your time.”

In the bright overhead light of our bedroom, I could see the bruises blooming around his ribcage where he’d taken the worst punches. This was worse than before. My brain felt clouded and foggy. I tried to think back through the day, trying to glue back together the broken pieces of my memory, but some of them were just lost forever and others seemed impossible.

Had we really spoken Frank Wu’s name? Had the thing really emerged, invisible and massive, into the falling rain?

I checked my body for bruises too and found none. Why had my father left me untouched? I supposed Jordan had taken the blame at some point, sparing me his own fate.

I pushed the tweezers farther around the shard of glass, drawing more blood. This time, though, when I pinched them together, I caught hold of the piece and removed it. Blood flowed out faster now, but at least the glass was out.

“Got it,” I said.

Jordan nodded. He was staring miles away, into the dark of the forest.

“He doesn’t know who he’s fucking with,” he said. “He thinks he knows, but he doesn’t.”

I knew what he was saying. And he wasn’t wrong. Dad needed to be taught a lesson. The only question was, how harsh that lesson needed to be. 

My mind turned back to Frank Wu. I wondered if the thing from the well had found him by now. *Two for a spill.* Tomorrow, we’d find out exactly what that meant.

The next day at school, Frank Wu didn’t show up to class. By second period, rumors were swirling. Some people were saying he’d had an accident. Some were saying he’d been attacked.

The facts everyone agreed to was that at some point in the night, his mom had heard a giant crash, followed by a thud. Then she’d found her son on her front walkway surrounded by glass, bleeding all over, both arms broken from the fall, the bones sticking out through the skin.

Later, Frank would say he’d awoken in midair, that he’d looked down to see the ground rushing up at him. He would say he smelled something rotten in the air. 

Some kids, the ones that were kind, thought maybe he’d just been sleepwalking. That he’d had some kind of nightmare and thrown himself through his own window. Others decided there was something wrong in his head, that he’d tried to off himself and just couldn’t admit it. 

At lunch, as we heard the news about Frank circulate, Jordan could barely hide his smile. We were sitting outside on a picnic table away from the other kids. Nearby, a bunch of the jocks were playing a no-holds-barred version of Five Hundred, which almost always resulted in some kind of injury.

“Sounds like Frank’ll be out for a while,” he said. “Too bad.”

“Careful how you talk,” I said. “He’s got plenty of friends around here. If they think that it was us–”

The words caught in my throat as I sniffed something foul in the air. It was a clear, sunny day. When I squinted, I could make something out just beyond the football players, a strangeness in the way the grass bent.

I elbowed Jordan and pointed it out.

“Did you go back this morning?” I said. “Without me?”

He shook his head. 

“I wanted to see what happened to Frank first,” he said.

As we watched, the ripple in the grass approached the clump of boys leaping for the football. I held my breath, waiting for one of them to have his feet ripped out from under him, to bloody his teeth landing hard on the dirt. 

But the thing moved past them.

For a moment, I thought it was coming toward us. Had Jordan sicced it on me as revenge for letting him take the full force of our father’s wrath? No question, I would have deserved it. I steeled myself, ready for the thing to slam me off the picnic table and onto the asphalt. 

But the thing moved right past us, too.

It rounded a corner of the building. Jordan and I exchanged a look and then got up, running after it, desperate to see where it was going, but before we’d even gone a few steps, we heard a scream.

We came around the corner to see Heather Lewis, the prettiest girl at school face down on the sidewalk, her mouth bloody, one of her front teeth busted out and lying beside her. She was screaming into the stinking air, looking around to see what had pushed her over and finding nothing.

“What did you do?” I whispered to Jordan.

“It wasn’t me,” he said. People were running toward Heather now, answering her cries for help. 

“Watch the crowd,” Jordan said. “See if anyone’s reaction look… you know, off.”

“Why?” I asked.

“Because we need to figure out [who else has a coin.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/)
