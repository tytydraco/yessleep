Hello, users of r/nosleep

By now, I'm sure you're familiar with the concept of the paranormal. You have all read and shared countless horrifying anecdotes of paranormal experiences, and I feel like this is the best community to share my experiences.

Most "paranormal" experiences I have read on many forums have been of cursed videotapes, flesh-hungry  monsters, spider-like creatures, time loops, or other such things that go bump in the night. However, I have encountered something beyond ghosts, beyond even demons, beyond even the divine.

What I encountered was not a god, a demon, a pixie, a fairy... No, none of those terms could describe it. Okay... demon, maybe, but even then, that's the closest thing there is to what I encountered.

I suppose I should begin telling my tale. When I was but a young child, I lived in the town of Sutton within the province of Ontario. I have long since moved, but have returned to visit now and again. But I also have a strange tale that happened there. One that I would have once described as paranormal, but after recent events?

Eldritch is a word I've seen people throw around for these types of experiences, and I can't really say that they're too far off...

The daycare centre that has since closed down would take the kids on walks through the forest once (sometimes twice) a week, and I remember these experiences with fondness. These outings were a way of getting young children some exercise, as well as letting kids see nature. This is where the weird part comes in. About a year or so before I moved away, I would have a dream of one of these walks, except we strayed from our usual past and got lost. We wandered and wandered, but we never did find the entrance.

We came across a house.

This house was not a small, dingy, log cabin in the middle of god-knows-where. It was a decently wide, two-floor house, and a sizeable interior. It had a staircase in the middle of the interior. The house itself, despite looking somewhat run down, looked like it had been abandoned not long ago. The only light in the house was coming from whatever natural sunlight had managed to creep its way through the foliage into the windows of select rooms. From there, I remember going upstairs, and into a bedroom. It was as if I knew exactly where I needed to go.

My memory of the dream is hazy after that. Whatever happened between entering that room and what happened next, my brain tried to block it out. I once chalked up this occurrence to mere chance, an amusing, if not off-putting probability... To say I was unwise was a gargantuan understatement.

What happened next? I woke up in a town that looked familiar, yet unrecognisable at the same time. It looked like any other town that I had visited, yet nothing like one. Internet memes telling you to name one object in a photo come to mind when trying to describe this town that only seemed to exist betwixt the corporeal world and my dreamscape.

The weirdest is yet to come though...

Apparently I've had dreams of this house long before that, and I don't even remember having them, let alone telling people... When I first heard my family tell me that little bit of information, I was a tad unnerved, sure, but a part of me was determined to find this house, to put an end to the mystery. I had gone to visit some extended family, and I told them that I would be going to the forest on the edge of town to take some photos of nature.

The actual expedition left many more mysteries than revelations, if it held any revelations as well.

First of all, I had spent all day wandering through the forest, keeping note of my position with a video camera in which I would record my expedition in bursts. I had also brought along a backpack with a thermos full of water, as well as some bananas, trail mix, my phone, and the usual stuff...

I won't tell you how I found the house, because... well... It was more like the house found me.

The exterior of the house looked exactly like I remembered it from my dream, two floors tall, with what appeared to be windows for the attic near the roof. I walked up to the door, and the door seemed to creak open as if it were expecting me. Interestingly, there were very little signs of neglect.

I should have just snapped a photo and left, but I still wanted answers. Why did I dream of this house, and how could it be real? Did some unseen force compel me to visit this house in the middle of nowhere?

The expedition of the house was quite uneventful at first. I had explored some bedrooms, living rooms, bathrooms, and other rooms, including an empty, unspecified room that had a black triangle with a red eye spray-painted on it. That was the first sign that something was off about this house. I, being stupid, chalked it up to some amateur graffiti artist finding the house before me. Nevertheless, I felt like I should take a photo, and I did just that.

Once I was done with the bottom floors, I decided I would continue up into the second floor. My expedition would be cut short, however, as I immediately entered the last room I remembered visiting in my dream before  waking up. Well, it was more like the last room I entered before what seemed to be a town. I then looked in the dresser drawer.

My confusion turned to fear, then to anxiety,and then a mix of the three when I heard a door creak. I grabbed what was in the drawer and hid in a closet. Ironically enough, my recollection here was top notch, as I remember sprinting down a hallway and hiding in a cabinet. The cabinet did have a slit in the middle of the doors. Even though both doors were closed, I took a quick peek between the slit. It was faint, but I heard footsteps coming closer and closer. Then they stopped, and I pondered how long I would have had to hide in this cabinet, perhaps until sundown, perhaps an all-nighter would be pulled. I wouldn't need to stay put for long, though.

A man in a black cultist robe, wearing a deep-scarlet coloured Michael Myers mask swung the door straight open. In his right hand, he held a large butcher's knife, and held an oil lamp in his left. At that moment, my fight or flight response kicked in, and I bolted. The man was quite slow, but I was slower. I couldn't jog to save my life. Thinking this must have caused a spark in adrenaline to coarse through my entire body, causing me to do a sprint that would have probably broken a world record. I ran through the halls, and I got near the entrance of the house. I stopped to catch my breath, and was about to run away from this house, but before I did, I realised that I had somehow never once dropped the object I had grabbed from the dresser drawer in the bedroom. 

Said object was a piece of paper. A crumpled up piece of paper. I exited the house and walked out of the woods. It was quite a hike, but I eventually found the entrance of the forest. I had made it out alive. 

And then I looked behind me.

Did I mention that the man I presumed to be a cultist was 7 feet tall?

My adrenaline kicked in once more, I sprinted and sprinted back to the place I had been staying, hoping and praying that the cultist hadn't followed me. I made it back home to my extended family's residence, and explained away my fear as having come across a maniac during my nature walk. unsavoury types in nature areas were (and probably still are) common in Sutton,so the idea of a violent maniac lurking in the forest at the edge of town didn't seem implausible. I, of course, left out the part where I found a house that I visited in a dream. I went into the basement bedroom of the house, and tried to get whatever rest I could that night. Also, I somehow still had the crumpled up piece of paper. I unfolded it, and I saw something that shook me.

It was a black triangle with a red eye. Under the triangle was one word which looked to be written in what I thought was red ink, but knowing the butcher knife-wielding maniac, I didn't rule out blood.

NECROSS

I looked at the backside of the paper, and there was another word.

BELIEVE

Sleep did not come easily. Once I fell asleep, I had another dream. This dream,however, was something that I may remember for years to come.

I dreamt that I was in a grey-scale version of the forest, with black fire engulfing the monochrome trees. Eventually, the largest tree collapsed into a vantablack pile of ash. The ashes eventually grew a pair of equally dark-coloured wings, with lines of red giving off the appearance of bat wings. Lanky, black arms and legs protruded, and I could only stand in horror as I came to a horrifying realisation.

The ash was taking the shape of a triangle.

And then the eye opened.

I remember our conversation to a tee.

"Well, well, well... what do we have here?"

Its voice was, odd, to say the least. Its voice sounded, natural, yet not of this world. Masculine, yet feminine. It didn't sound pleasant, but it didn't hurt to listen to it. It wasn't loud, or quiet. It wasn't deep, nor was it high pitched.

"Who are you?" I said to it with a hint of confusion and fear in my voice.

"I am Necross. I exist within the dreamworld, and I normally cannot make contact with humans, but my powers have grown over the past few years."

I was confused, as well as nervous, but I tried my damnedest to not falter. "What do you mean?"

"For many years, my powers were useless when I would attempt to use them in your world. However, as of late, my grip has grown stronger. I'd say my knowledge of the human mind is to be thankful for that." Necross said to me, with a hint of playfulness in his tone.

It didn't take a genius to put two and two together. This thing, whatever it was, led me to the house in the forest. No doubt that it was the subject of worship in that house. 

"I have developed quite a following, as you can guess from the symbolism in that house. That house used to belong to a rich man who decided to build a vacation home in the woods. He was my first ever victim. I infected his mind like a parasite, and now he is but a mindless slave. I have since managed to attack the minds of other people,and soon the Cult of Necross was formed."

I had one question left.

"But, why me?" I asked him.

"Oh. I could tell you..." Necross began, before perishing whatever thought he had

"But it would ruin the surprise..."

I awoke in a cold sweat that morning. After I woke up, I tried to spend a normal last day of vacation with my family, but the dream wouldn't leave my mind. 

Fast forward months later, and here I am now. I have finally decided to come out to you guys about this experience, in hope that you guys know what happened to me. I hope that whatever Necross is, that it doesn't have any control over my mind.  I tried searching up "Necross" on Google, but I am simply at a loss right now... 

And about that photo... I checked the photos on my phone, and the image just wouldn't load. Once it did load,however, it was a corrupted, illegible mess. It ended up deleting itself a day later, so I can't even upload it online.

I also neglected to ask about the town that I dreamt of as well, but I have a feeling that it may have just been an unrelated dream. Still, I feel like I should mention it. Just in case...

I've been checking the news, and apparently a man was arrested outside of the Pizza Hut in Sutton for brandishing a butcher knife and charging at someone with it. So at least the maniac won't be causing any harm for the foreseeable future. Still, I have a feeling that this isn't even the beginning...
