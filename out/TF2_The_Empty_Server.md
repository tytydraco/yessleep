July 8th, 2024, was the day everything went to hell. For me, it didn’t start then, but I suspect that was when it was first born. I remember logging into TF2 about a week ago now. You know the text as well as I do.

"**You’re On Your Way To Thunderous Mountain."**

 

I already knew I was playing Sniper, so the loading didn’t take long. A click here and a click there doesn’t seem like much effort to get into the first match of the day. Just like that, I was in another game. Peering at my keyboard in my dimly lit room, I shot off a message to the server. Scarcely had I sent a message when a response popped up in the chat. “KYS.”

"That's rude,” I responded, already annoyed at my fellow players. It was my first game of the day, couldn’t these guys give me a break? Still, after enough matches on this game, you won’t think too much of it, so I just ignored him. Besides, GUILLIESUIT was a cool username.

Though I hadn’t ventured too far past my spawn, I began to notice something—the server seemed relatively empty. Usually, you’d hear the sound of shooting, or see two people in chat going at it, but nothing so far had happened that reminded me of the comforting chaos of the usual games I played. I don’t know how to describe it, but it felt as if the game itself was unusually silent. I know TF2 is rather old, but it still has a vibrant community, but i digress.

 

I had barely pressed enter, sending a message that said “Where y’all at?" when the unnerving quiet was broken by footsteps. Past me, emerging from the darkness, ran a spy. Before I could even react, however, he had passed me. Right before I could move my fingers from the send button, he continued to run along the rail tracks, paying no attention to me. But he didn’t stop, nor did he turn, at the end of the tracks. He ran toward the edge and, with one jump, fell into the void below.

 **"Breadolphin fell to a clumsy, painful death."**

Well, I supposed that answered my question as to where these guys were. “Lol spy,” I typed in chat, but a second later another system message displayed below mine.

 **"Breadolphin left the game (client disconnect)."**

 

I didn’t have time to care about some lagging player with a bad connection, though. A second later, a Scout leaped through an opening, and it was game time. I whirled around and tried to no scope him, but missed. "Ah, Piss," said the sniper. I had him in my scope. Now he just stood there, staring down my barrel. He didn't move, didn't attack. I could've sworn he nodded before I pulled the trigger. At this point, I couldn’t help but think I had been placed on a server full of noobs.

"Man, y’all are bad,” I spelled out as quickly as possible, making sure to send the message before this guy disconnected as well. “KYS.”

Now it was starting to annoy me. What's the deal with GUILLIESUIT?

 

“You too, man,” I responded before venturing out into the map to find other players. What I found, however, was just more idle server BS. The only other player I found in a few minutes of searching was a dead body of Heavy with Ammo floating above him. It was clear that there was nothing on this server worth doing.

 

I sighed, annoyed. I had spent a good 10 minutes of my time—wasted a good 10 minutes of my time—on this stupid server. And now all I could do was log off because nobody here was even close to my level.

 

That was when I realized something. I couldn’t log off. I couldn’t disconnect, and I couldn’t close the program. It was like my game was frozen, stuck on my screen. This didn’t freak me out—I’d dealt with plenty of lag issues before, considering my piece of junk computer was subpar at best. However, I could've sworn I heard Heavy's voiceline, "Yes, I like this new weapon," but it sounded off; it was deep and almost demonic. I looked back at where Heavy's corpse was, and he was gone.

It's midnight right now, so i fatigue must be getting to me.

I returned to the game, running this way and that to try to find some way to get out. I decided to leave my base and go towards RED base. As I turned the corner into a room, I came face to face with a player.

 

The engineer stared at me. His mouth moved silently, in a way it should have never done, and at the same time, a message appeared in the chat. “KYS.”

 

“How are you moving like that?” I typed back. I had never once in my life seen a character in the game move when someone sent a message.

 

“You need to kill yourself,” he responded, his mouth once again moving silently as if he himself were stuck in a night terror—unable to speak but trying all the same. His plastic, 3D-modeled face seemed to shift as his jaw moved, the composition changing depth as it did.

 

I simply stood there, unable to move my character from the shock. And as I did, the engineer approached me. He walked forward—a human walk, a natural walk—and quietly took my knife from my hand.

 “Leave while you still can,” he spoke. His blackout goggles were inches from my face as he said this, and I swear I could hear a voice faintly through my headphones. At that second, however, the Engineer looked past me toward the door behind me. He must have seen something, because the next moment he ran away and up the stairs. I turned to look at what he had seen and saw it too.

 Through the open doorway, I could see an arm of a character. But on that arm, on the hand, there weren’t five fingers—there were six. “Come over here,” said the voice of a Medic, but there was something distorted and unnatural about it. It almost sounded demonic, as if there was an amalgamation of voices speaking at once behind it.

 Something about the way the voice spoke and the way the hand began to move, creeping around the door, made me finally move. I turned and ran, my character running effortlessly up the same stairs the Engineer had run a minute before. I could hear the voices calling for help behind me, playing the help voicelines of all characters.

 

I might have even considered it, but at the top of the stairs I saw something that made the blood drain from my face and my fingers feel stiff. At the top of the stairs lay the body of the engineer, a puddle of blood beneath him. As I glanced frantically around the room, I saw on the far wall a simple message had been written in what looked like his blood.

“DON’T LET IT TAKE YOU ALIVE.”

 

I could hear it stumbling, and it's calls for help growing more frantic.

 

With a thump and a crash, the screaming and writhing thing threw itself even further up the stairs, only a hair’s length behind me. Without thinking, I leaped from the window, running desperately. I dared not look behind myself or turn around to see whatever this thing actually was. I ran, desperately dodging around corners and sprinting through the map.

 

I could hear it behind me—the hundreds of voices all yelling. I could hear it murmuring for help, but each voice was distorted and demonic, a mask of its former self. I no longer felt as if I was separate from my Sniper. I no longer saw beyond the screen, and sometimes I felt as if I was looking through his eyes as I ran. But I had no other options—when I reached the edge, I continued to run and threw myself off.  


The pain as I hit the ground was agonizing and sharp, but I saw a message float up on the screen.

 **"Dicksalot fell to a clumsy, painful death!"**

 

And suddenly, I had snapped out of it. I was back in my body and able to move again. My TF2 displayed the Disconnected message, and a little error message popped up informing me the client had stopped working and would now close.

I sat there for several minutes, unable to move. I had no friends or family to talk to about this. I was all alone in my house. And for some reason, I felt as if I had just escaped death.

 I had nothing else to do. Still feeling numb, I clicked on my browser and pulled up Google. I remembered two names, but that was enough.

 In the search bar, I entered “GUILLIESUIT TF2.”.

 

A few forum posts popped up, as well as his profile on various websites. Scrolling through the system, I didn’t see anything out of the obvious. He had been fairly active up until two weeks ago.

 Still, I kept scrolling, hoping to find something. Maybe an hour later, in some of his earliest posts, I saw a picture he had taken and for whatever godforsaken reason, decided to post to a TF2 forum.

 He stood there, smiling, nerdy, with glasses and a buzzcut, looking nothing like the engineer whom he had played. It was a picture of when he worked at Subway. And I saw his name, too. I quickly typed it into my search engine and hit enter.

 The headlines washed over me with an icy clarity that made it feel as if the room had suddenly become colder.

“Man goes missing in the small town of…”

“Body of man who went missing still not recovered…”

 

The earliest date was two weeks ago, right when he had stopped posting to the form. A few days later, I saw another post on the forum. It wasn’t from GILLIESUIT, but it was worded strangely, and I almost instantly sent the poster a message. The post was simple, but it detailed a frighteningly similar experience to mine. I’ll include it here.

TITLE: Anyone Else Stuck in Game?

 

POST: Guys, I’m freaking out, rn. I joined some servers, but there was some voodoo shit going on when I joined. This one guy kept banging his head against the floor and typing “I’m having so much fun in chat!” over and over again. I’ve never seen a player act like that before. I also saw this other weird thing running right me right before I alt-F4’d that looked like some glitchy 3D model of a bunch of players stuck together. Am I freaking out for nothing? Is this some new update?

  
Everyone thought he must've joined a freakfortress server. No one took him seriously.

 

\~

 

We chatted for a while, and I ended up telling him about my experience. The fact the server was still running isn’t what worried me the most, though, as surprising as that might seem. It was something else he mentioned in the last message he sent me.

 

"Yeah, dude, I don’t know what’s going on. I went back to check the server, and it was normal. That thing was no longer there. Even weirder is that lately many users who have actively played TF2 recently are disappearing, some of my friends included. In any case, im outta here!”

Days have passed since that day. I have been hearing news reports about people disappearing under mysterious circumstances lately. All they had in common was they played TF2.

Part of me wants to log back in and check, but I dare not to because of that thing.
