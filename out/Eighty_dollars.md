I have always been afraid of running out of money. As a kid, my dad lost his job more times than I could remember. Although everything always turned out alright in the end (his job had been more on the freelance side), I remember how anxious it made me feel. I always felt like we didn’t have anything to fall back on. Even as the years passed by, and my parents paid off their debt and set money aside, money became something I didn’t want to squander. 

I felt uncomfortable having someone pay for me when we went out for dinner. Despite being someone with a crazy long steam wishlist and enough cash to buy things in moderation because of my part time job, I would keep my money in the bank for the most part. (Though, I’ll admit, I’m a sucker for iced coffee, which is where most of my money went during highschool). And I remember as a kid that when I grew out of clothing, I would put off telling my parents as if not to waste their money.

A couple days ago, I spent a lot of time with my mom getting a present ready for my boyfriend who is going to college in a state bordering ours. We’re highschool sweethearts and he’s never really had a good relationship with his family like I do with mine. So, knowing that he’s going into his Junior year of college without anyone else supporting him, my mom and I make a care package for him each semester before we send him on his way. This is something that normally is a good way to spend time with my mom after a long spring semester (as fall semesters tend to be more my thing).

Anyway, my mom was teasing me about my crazy ability to lose things. As a kid, I left more water bottles at my house on the way to school than anyone else I knew, resulting in a lot of overpriced recyclable ones I bought directly from the school. I often misplaced whatever book I was currently reading somewhere between the sheets and as if I was the kid who cried wolf, my mom would somehow make it materialize out of nowhere. There were multiple days where I would just leave my textbook in my room and have to grab one of the extra copies in the classroom. I lost everything, and nothing was more notable than the sweater incident.

I went to a private school since I was in middle school. Every private school I knew had certain rules on what you could and could not wear. The length of your skirt, the color of your hair, how many bracelets you wore on your arms: all of these rules in the name of discipline. Even now, I look back and wonder how I spent so many years without having the comfort of wearing hoodies and sweatpants every day. 

At any rate, it was my senior year of highschool when the Sweater incident happened. During my second semester, it started snowing more than it had ever snowed before. Although we were all happy for a supposed snow day, we all knew it was going to be colder in the halls than normal to save on utility bills. You’d think private schools would be less cheap than that but from what I’ve come to realize, they seem to be more stingy that the public schools some of my friends went to.

I had approximately one sweater. It was the only design that looked good on me, and I patched it up on the elbows from the wear and tear as it belonged to my two older sisters who had since graduated. But, ever the lazy seventeen year old, I often threw it into my room without a care. Over my bed, on my desk, in my self-proclaimed “art cart” with all the art supplies I’d gotten from Christmases and birthdays over the years. The point is, I had no clue where I put it. But I always knew where it was because it was flipped inside out somewhere in my room.

When we tell the story, it’s always about waking up on a cold, snow covered February day. I go through the motions, eating cereal for breakfast, pouring some sugary coffee, maybe coloring a coloring sheet as I try to wake up. And then I went to my room, got dressed, brushed my hair, brushed my teeth, and then I went to find my sweater. I couldn’t find it anywhere.

It was like losing a big project on the day that it was due. I couldn’t find it anywhere. Not in the dirty laundry where I could have honestly thrown it the night before, not somewhere in my sheets, not under my bed. I could not find it. I remember calling my mom downstairs, feeling guilty that I couldn't find it. But then she came into my room. She looked through my dirty laundry, moved my blankets to the side, and used a flashlight to look under my bed. She didn’t see anything either. 

Eventually, my older sister who lived at home, my two younger brothers, my dad, my mom, and I were all scouring my room. We found nothing. To this day, I have deep cleaned my room multiple times. There was never any evidence that I left it in my room. No wrappers of the cheese crackers I was so fond of at the time, no crumpled up post notes that I would put in my pockets that I put the date and a little homework to do list on. Nothing. My mom went and bought me a new sweater the next day.

 But when my mom and I were busy reminiscing, I remembered something else. To make this more understandable, I likely have ADHD and there’s this thing called executive dysfunction that just makes it a lot harder to start things than most people. Which is why, despite some of my cleaning being out of pure laziness (I will admit sometimes I just sat on my computer and watched horror movies) I had a hard time making my bed. I had a lot of blankets and stuffed animals and it was a whole process that was just hard to make myself do. 

I remember making my bed at some point after the incident, I’d assume around late February or March because my family’s Christian and I remember Lent just starting up. I’ve always had bed covers that don’t fit perfectly (cause my mattress is shit, pardon my language) so I finally moved my pillow. As I go to move it, I’m shocked to see a folded twenty dollar bill.

We all know what a new twenty dollar bill looks like. Crisp. You pick it up and it feels *new*. The only thing that seemed off about it was that it was folded. I remember unfolding it carefully. Inside of it, I found a fifty dollar bill.

Just like anyone else, I am prone to misplacing a little bit of money. A twenty dollar bill on my ground from Christmas money is very in character for me. But I felt uncomfortable as I surveyed the money. It didn’t look like anyone had ever used it. It had one of those perfect creases that people who are good at origami can make. I can’t even make a crease to fold a piece of notebook paper in half. So for such perfect money, not accidentally marked by one of my pens, put almost perfectly folded under my pillow, made me really uncomfortable.

I didn’t even put it in my wallet. I didn’t really know what to do with it. I decided to put it on my bedside table. I don’t remember when I moved it but I probably put it into my bank account. (I was trying really hard to save money at the time).

It wasn’t till yesterday when I texted my mom to ask her how much the new sweater cost her anyway, for nostalgia's sake of course. My mom said she got it on sale with her teacher discount (some of that stuff could cost at least a hundred dollars). She told me it was only eighty dollars.
