Im writing this with my phone on 14% and my brightness all the way down. He hasn't come yet, but I know he will- fuck it's driving me crazy. 

My name is Dane West, I'm 19 years old and I live in Tampa, Florida. I know I'm not supposed to give out personal information on the internet but I don't give a shit, I'm freaking out, man. 

This hell started 3 weeks ago. I had just moved out of my last apartment that I shared with my best friend before he died in a car crash. I had been on the phone with him when it happened, and the memories tormented me in my last apartment. I saw my friend everywhere. I wanted-  no, needed to escape. 

I thought moving would end my nightmare, but I was so so wrong. 

My new apartment is a gem on the outskirts of Tampa, plenty of space for one person, and a small community area to connect with your neighbors. I nearly cried tears of joy the night I moved in four weeks ago. 

But shit got weird fast. 

It started with the dreams, I'd had them since Scott's death, but assumed they'd go away with a scenery change and time. For some reason though, after moving they got worse. 

The images would get more and more vivid, until they were joined by morning headaches. Coffee barely eased the suffering but I got through. That is, until the second week. 

That was the week I really freaked out, because instead of seeing Scott in my dreams, I saw him in my apartment.

I was finally laying down after a long day of college classes and 3 hours of work, when I heard a creak on the floorboards. Not unusual for an apartment, but it sounded close enough to put me on edge.

I sat up and stared into the dark when I saw it. An eye. White, beady, small and barely poking around the corner.

I didn't know what to do, my palms got sweaty and my heart rate increased. But after 23 minutes with the dot not moving I convinced myself I was being paranoid and forced myself to sleep. 

The eye kept coming back though. Slowly I could see more and more of it. It got joined by a head, and then a neck, until an entire body darkened my doorway. It was fully black apart from the eyes which shone in the dark. 

The silhouette was of my best friend, but I knew it was him. I wasn't sure what to do. I looked up hallucinations on the internet and found that grief, stress, and exhaustion can cause them. 

Check, check, and check, so I didn't worry about it. I mean, damn, it freaked me the hell out, but Im I'm not a wuss, and I didn't believe in ghosts.

Four days ago though, everything changed. When I woke up in the morning he wasn't gone, or at least not completely. I saw him leave my room out of the corner of my eye, and a piece of paper on my bed caught my eye. 

Picking it up, I squinted through the tiredness and read one word: Soon. 

Chills shivered through my entire body, and I felt my heart start to pound. Was that a threat? Am I hallucinating during the day now? 

I ignored the note, determined to stay sane. 

That night I went to bed determined, and when I woke up, nothing. I thought it was over. 

Last night, though, I had another dream. But this one was different. I was the man. I watched myself fall asleep from my doorway, then crept to my bed, rattling breaths getting shoved out of my body with every step. I felt the bed sag beneath "me" as I leaned over my own sleepimg body. 

Rattling breath in, and out. 

The exhale sent chills down my spine, and I woke up, but didn't move one inch, as I felt the breath shiver on the back of my neck. 

It was real. 

I was so convinced in that moment, I felt the terror of the fact that these nights had been a reality. I couldn't force my eyes open until late in the morning, long after I couldn't feel the breath on my neck anymore. 

My day was spent shaking and quiet. I feel crazy. Felt. Am. 

I took a shower, shake it off. The steam was practically choking me. 

I step out and on the mirror one word. 

Tonight.

I feel numb. I don't know what he wants from me. I know he isn't Scott. Right? Who the hell would do that? Huh? 

Is it you Scott? 

I'm mumbling under my breath, I can barely tell when I'm speaking or thinking. 

Am I even typing right now?

Heavy, deep breaths. In. Out. In. Out. In. 

He's here.

His beady eyes glare from the doorway. I'm ready. Whatever this is, I want it over. I close my eyes. 

Whenever you're ready.
