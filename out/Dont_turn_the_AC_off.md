My name is Jackson, I had a normal bland childhood just like any other. I had 1 Older Sister, 1 Younger Brother, a Dog, a Mom, a Dad, we were in a good financial position and lived in your average American Suburban Neighborhood. However, there was only one thing abnormal about our life. The House was constantly cold, and I mean really, really, cold. It was because of our parents, they had a weird rule that the AC always had to be at exactly 33.8 Fahrenheit They would never explain why no matter how many times me and my siblings asked. But they were very strict about it so we didn't touch it until I was 15. 

&#x200B;

I was having a sleepover with 3 of my close friends. My parents were out of town and my Brother was having a sleepover at a friend's house. My sister was still at home but in her room, she didn't really care what we did, she was always chill like that. So we basically had the whole house to ourselves and we could do whatever we want. As expected our parents strictly told us to keep the AC on. 'Yeah, yeah we will" We had heard it a million times. The sleepover wasn't going as planned. Right when they entered they complained how cold it was. "It's the middle of winter dude you don't need the AC on" "I have to keep it on my Mum makes me" All my friends sighed and just dealt with it.

 We were all nearly asleep when one of my friends yelled out "Ugh! It's way too cold bro, please turn it off" "No! I already told you I can't. Just deal with it" I of course felt how cold it was but I was very much used to it. "I can't do it! I'm calling my Mum to pick me up" "Me too" "Same" My friends were all about to leave because of my Parent's stupid rule. You can probably guess what I did next.

 "Fine! Fine! Fine! I'll turn it off, just don't leave." "Thank god man" My friends were relieved and followed me down the hall. We walked down the stairs with the only source of light being my iPod Touch's flashlight. We got to the Thermostat and I stared at it for a good 10 seconds "What the hell are you doing man turn it off!" "Yeah, I will" I said nervously thinking about all the times my parents had firmly told me not to. But I didn't want my Friends to leave. I reached up to the Thermostat slowly, my arms shaking slightly. I turned it off. "Finally man I already feel better" My friends took off their thick Jumpers and were happy again, and even better nothing happened. I remember thinking to myself why were they so strict about it. I mean I didn't really think about it much. I went upstairs with my friends feeling satisfied and accomplished. We walked back into my room and we all slid into our sleeping bags.

 I fell asleep almost right when my head touched the pillow. I woke up almost as soon as I had fell asleep to my Sister's sharp screams. My friends also bolted up freaked out. "What the hell was that?" One of my friends said. We all immediately got up and bolted out of my room heading for the staircase to go to my sisters room that was downstairs I was Infront of everyone and was about to go down the first step when all of a sudden my friend grabbed me by my shirt and pulled me back. "Look! The air is purple." He whispered. We all looked downstairs and noticed that the air was purple, and it was coming out of the AC. We all stood there for 10 seconds looking down puzzled.

"We need to turn the AC back on!" I said. I walked down the stairs, my friends nervously followed along. I had gotten to the bottom of the staircase right where the thermostat was. I turned it back on to no use. It didn't turn on. I started creeping to my Sister's room with my friends. We got to the hallway where her room was and the door was wide open. I slowly and quietly walked towards her room picking up a baseball bat that was resting on the wall. I got to the doorway and quickly entered in wielding my baseball bat ready for the worst. There I saw the most terrifying thing I have ever witnessed in my life. My sisters dead body, her throat was slit, her eye balls were gouged out, she had cuts all over her, and her legs were completely missing. One of my friends screamed the most ear deafening sharp scream. But then the screaming stopped. I looked in the hallway from my sisters room and noticed all my friends were missing.

 I slowly crept into the hallway and looked left to the end of the hallway. There it was, in the light that the moon was emitting through the small window I saw My Mom, Dad, and my sister. They looked like mannequins and were eating my friends legs. They noticed me almost immediately and smiled. "Hi Jackson, you'll be joining us soon" My "Mom" Said. Then my Mannequin sister got up and started sprinting at me. I swinged my baseball bat in desperation. It was no use. She just grabbed the bat and smiled at me. I let go of the bat and ran as humanly fast as possible. I wasn't nearly athletic but I was running insanely fast.

 I ran through the kitchen, the living room and could see the front door. I ran up to it and turned the handle. Since we lived in a safe neighborhood the door was unlocked. I went on my porch and made a run for it. I ran through multiple streets for what felt like hours. Eventually I stopped due to exhaustion and looked behind me. No one was there. After that night I never saw my parents again. And 9 years later I now live in a apartment in the city. I always keep the AC on.
