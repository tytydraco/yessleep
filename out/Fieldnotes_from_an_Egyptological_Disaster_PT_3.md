Even the previous night’s events couldn’t stop me from sharing a secret smile with Sam over our breakfast. I found little in the way of sleep after my snake encounter, and that was to say nothing of being pursued by whoever was in the tomb. I didn’t know what to do about it. The most obvious solution was to get Felix involved. As project supervisor, he had seniority and held more sway with the expedition organizers than anyone on site, except James. Unfortunately, he left before I woke up to maintain the chain of custody over the artifacts in transit to the Ministry of Antiquities. I didn’t want to go to James for help. Our distaste for one another aside, I had next to nothing tangible to report, at least, nothing that wouldn’t give him a chance to chew me out or worse, assign me another menial task like sweeping out the tomb all day for breaking curfew. I needed more information before I’d risk that. While I sat, nudging dehydrated eggs around my plate, Sam vented her newest frustrations to me and Jorge.

“I still think it’s rubbish, you lot getting to open the burial chamber while I’m stuck in the communications tent all day.”

As it turned out, the Ministry of Antiquities had little interest in interfering with a determined young woman’s desire to remain on site, no matter what James had to say. Unfortunately, it did fall within his purview what duties she performed. For the time being, Sam was tasked with sending and monitoring emails, maintaining records, and other administrative tasks.

“Take it easy, Sammy.” Jorge grinned as Sam crinkled her nose. She hated that nickname. “At least they’re lettin’ you stay.”

“Oh yes, I can’t believe my luck. I’ve always wanted to be someone’s secretary!” Sam threw her hands up in disgust, and I caught a glimpse of the purple veins and dark bruise peeking around the bandage covering her hand. Jorge must have seen it too, because he got that smartass look on his face.

“You know, Sammy. I think you’re lucky. There’s these people that pay for bee stings. Supposedly it jump-starts the nervous system or whatever. Maybe scorpion stings do the same kinda’ thing. And just think, you got yours for free.”

“I’m not about to buy into a lot of medical quackery, thank you very much,” Sam said, rolling her eyes.

I watched the tent door flap shut as the occasional team member left. I wanted to tell Sam and Jorge about what happened, but didn’t want to risk tipping off whoever was fooling around in the tomb. I decided to bide my time until we could speak more privately. We were among the last to leave the dining tent. I told Jorge to go ahead to the tomb without me and walked Sam to her new post. It was a short walk, but she seemed happy for the company.

“I’m sorry you won’t be there with us today,” I said, offering a sympathetic smile.

“It’s alright, I suppose,” Sam sighed. “At least I’m not bound for Cairo with that first load of artifacts, am I?”

“Who knows, maybe they’ll let you back on the excavation site sooner than you think.”

“The only one who wants me off the site, out of camp, really, is James. Ugh! I can’t stand that man!”

We stopped for just a moment beside the communications tent.

“Be sure to take lots of pictures for me,” Sam said, a disheartened expression on her face.

“I’ll take as many as I can,” I said, holding up my digital camera. “I’ll let you know if James gets caught in a booby trap.”

She gave me a small grin before disappearing into the folds of the tent, and I made my way to the tomb. I felt sorry for Sam. Missing the opening of the burial chamber after toiling away in the hot sun for months had to be disappointing. Still, I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t overcome with excitement as the stone slab slid to the side, revealing the next chamber. I stood breathlessly as James went inside. Once again, I was stuck, waiting until the senior Egyptologists had taken the first look. It was agony, standing in line, slowly advancing into the burial chamber. It was only made worse by the occasional gasp of amazement from up ahead. The room was still dimly lit, even with the team’s headlamps, but it didn’t take much light to reveal what the stone slab kept hidden for so long. The chamber was empty.

There was nothing inside. Just the thick coating of dust I was accustomed to and 4 walls. There was no mummy, no coffin, no artefacts, nothing except a raised portion of the floor the size of a long dinner table, protruding about knee level from the rest of the floor. I had no idea what it was for, but as a few of the more optimistic members of the team brought in work lights on tripods, I noticed black and brown stains against the ivory white limestone. As I stood, staring at it, Jorge crept into my peripheral vision, piloting the 3-D scanning R.O.V.

“Looks like someone beat us to it, huh?”

“Real funny,” I frowned.

“Hey, take it easy, big guy. I was just trying to lighten the mood, is all.”

I tore my gaze from the short table, still unsure what I was looking at. The room was considerably less interesting without a mummy in it. It wasn’t hard getting the team to go back to cataloguing artefacts in the chapel. Even James left, leaving me and Jorge alone, but he didn’t seem to be working. Passing by the door back to the chapel, I noticed him standing perfectly still, facing the room’s northern wall, staring into the serdab.

“You’re telling me there wasn’t a thing inside?” Sam asked, leaning close to me over our lunch as I told her about my morning in the tomb. Her eyes were wide with surprise and just a hint of jealousy over the nothing we’d found. She made several appeals that morning to the expedition’s organizers to be allowed to resume “real” archaeological work, but they either hadn’t gotten back to her or held their ground. Despite James’ instructions for her to remain in the communications tent and Elaine’s suggestions she “take it easy”, smudges of dust and dirt on her bandages betrayed the fact she’d been doing something more than sending emails and filing documents on the computer.

“I couldn’t believe it either. Literally the only thing inside was that table, or whatever it was.” I gestured to my camera. Sam picked it up and frowned while scrolling through the most recent pictures.

“Well, I’ve certainly never seen anything like this. It’s very odd, isn’t it?”

“Were empty tombs something they built in ancient Egypt?”

“Not exactly, no, but they built something similar called a cenotaph. People visited them as a pilgrimage of sorts.”

“They must have been important people if there were pilgrimages to visit their false tombs.”

“Cenotaphs weren’t meant for mortals. They were dedicated to a particular deity. In a way, it makes sense, doesn’t it? That might explain why we didn’t find any food stores or canopic jars inside the store room.”

“I guess I’m just kind of disappointed,” I frowned. “I was really hoping we’d find a mummy today.”

“Let’s not start feeling sorry for ourselves,” Sam said, resting a hand on mine. “It's still an important discovery. Mummies bring people into museums, but things like this teach us so much more about life in ancient Egypt. Who knows, there might be more tombs in this valley the first round of LIDAR scans missed.” I tried forcing a smile, and Sam went on. “And if that’s not enough excitement for you, it looks like we’ll just miss a sandstorm heading this way to flatten the site.”

“Sandstorm?” Sam must have registered my confusion because she crinkled up her nose.

“Did James not tell you and the others? I sent word a few hours ago about a storm system further to the west. It’s still in Libya, but it could cross over into western Egypt in the next day. There’s still a chance it could divert its course, but meteorologists are saying it will likely dissipate before it gets anywhere near us.”

We sat for a few moments in quiet contemplation before Sam picked up my camera again. She had a quizzical look on her face as she stared at the screen.

“You said there was some kind of residue on the table you found?”

“There was something on it. It seeped into the stone at one end, but there was some of it that dried into a thin coating. It flaked off like old paint when we took our samples. Maybe it’s some kind of tar or melted resin from incense.”

“Was it rather gum-like when you scraped it up?” Sam asked, cocking her head to one side.

“Not really. It was actually kind of hard to collect a good sample. It kept flaking away while we tried to clean dust off the- ”

“I don’t think that was tar or resin, Derrick. I think it was blood.”

I looked at her, unsure or perhaps unwilling to follow that line of inquiry to its conclusion.

“I think something was sacrificed in there.” I must have had a look of disbelief on my face because Sam went on talking. “It wasn’t uncommon for ancient Egyptians in those times to sacrifice bulls, birds, rams…” She looked up as if trying to remember something. A sickening thought occurred to me as I looked at what now seemed more akin to an altar of some sort than a table.

“People?” I asked. Sam shook her head.

“That’s been hotly debated. Personally, I don’t think it’s all that likely, but this is tremendous. If this really is a cenotaph, it’s a far greater discovery than a tomb. And it’s so well preserved.”

I cringed a little, thinking of the night before. Someone in the camp was threatening the integrity of the site. It wouldn’t take them long to recognize its religious significance, and when they did, it was hard telling what they might do.

“Sam, listen. I need to tell you something.” There must have been something in the tone of my voice, because her expression turned serious. “Last night on my way back to my tent, I saw something near the dig site.” Her nose crinkled as I said this.

“What do you mean?”

“I saw someone with a flashlight going into the tomb and went to investigate.” I went on to explain more about my run-in with James while I was getting her notebook the previous night, and not wanting to explain why I was outside in the middle of the night.

“Did you go inside and see who it was?”

“I was going to. There was a strange chant coming from inside, and I stopped to listen. That’s when I ran into a-”

A rustling of canvas gave us pause as someone came into the communications tent, before we realized it was only Jorge.

“Hey, you guys wanna grab something to eat?”

“We already ate, but we could really use your help,” I said.

“What’s going on?”

I gestured for him to keep quiet, and he closed the gap between us, a dubious look on his face.

“Well, what is it?”

“I think someone in camp is up to something, either stealing artefacts or disturbing the site after dark. I saw light coming from inside the tomb last night, but was… unable to investigate further. Whatever the case, I think whoever it was will go back again.” Jorge nodded.

“Ok. What do you need me for?”

“I want to catch them in the act, but I don’t want it to turn into my word against someone else’s.” Jorge nodded, seeming to contemplate things.

“Yeah, I can help with that. It doesn’t need to be your word against someone else’s, Derrick. We could always hide ROVER in there and get video evidence.”

“I thought the R.O.V. could only make 3-D scans,” Sam said, tilting her head to one side.

“That’s its main function, but it also has infrared and standard video.”

“This is perfect!” Sam almost clapped her hands, but stopped when she remembered the scorpion sting. “We can hide the robot in the tomb and leave it running like a security camera.”

“We wouldn’t even need to hide it,” I said, thinking out loud. “It’s been inside the Chapel for the past few days; it wouldn’t seem out of place to anyone.”

“You’re right about that,” Jorge nodded. “We’d still need to tail this creep, at least to those stairs goin’ to the tomb. There’s the chance someone might put somethin’ in the way and we won’t be getting the full picture. It’d be nice to have the option to move it around.”

“Where’s the R.O.V. right now?”

“It’s still in that room we opened up this morning. I’m planning on moving it to the Chapel after I finish up those scans.”

“Then it's settled, tonight we’ll meet up and keep watch for anything out of the ordinary. Then we can catch this bastard red-handed.”

“Please, just be careful, you two,” Sam said.

Whoever we were after must have wanted to play it safe and wait until more people were asleep. Another long day of work left Jorge and me exhausted. It was nearly 3 AM, and we were about to resort to sleeping in shifts, when we finally saw signs of movement on the dig site. We waited for what felt like ages. In reality, it was probably closer to five minutes before I nudged Jorge and we took off through the dining tent’s flapping door. Adrenaline pulsed through my veins as we jogged through the sand to the tomb’s glowing entrance.

“Slow down, will ya’?” Jorge whispered while panting along after me. I remembered he was lugging the R.O.V.’s wireless controller along with him and slowed my pace. I gave the camp a cursory glance, hoping no one spotted us, especially not James. Clearing the last of the sand dunes between camp and the dig site, I heard the same muffled chanting from the night before. Jorge met my eyes, a look of disbelief on his face as we tried to suppress our gasps for air. I stared down into the tomb at the flickering glow of an open flame.

“Are you ready?” I whispered.

Jorge nodded and opened the R.O.V.’s controller case. It powered on and the loading screen animation played, but when the main control screen came on, instead of a camera view of the tomb, the words ‘no signal’ dominated the screen.

“Shit,” Jorge cursed.

“What is it?”

“The R.O.V. is too far underground for the signal to get through.” Jorge frowned and flipped a few of the switches experimentally.

“I thought you said this thing had a range over a quarter mile long?”

“It does if it has straight line of sight,” he said, agitation in his voice. “But I never accounted for it being underground. That corridor has too many twists and turns. The rock must be absorbing the signal.” We sat for a moment, with only the muffled chanting and occasional breeze breaking the silence as we avoided the only sensible solution to our problem.

I took the first step down the stairs, careful to soften each footfall on the stone steps. Jorge followed close behind, shaking his head every few steps to confirm the still non-existent signal. We reached the bottom of the stairs and crossed the threshold into the antechamber. Sweat beaded on my forehead and the small of my back as we looked up the buttressed corridor. Flickering light from a naked flame danced on the walls. Chanted words echoed off their stone surroundings, less distorted now. The words sounded something like the ones Sam pronounced while showing me one of her books about hieroglyphs, only they were spoken in a flowing cadence that rose and fell with the intensity of the fire’s light.

I looked back at Jorge. His expression was stoic, but his eyes betrayed something bordering on fear. The scent of fresh incense mingled with the tomb’s musty odor. It occurred to me the first time this idiot playing Egyptian Priest might actually be using some of the resins we found in the store room for this ridiculous ritual. I was getting impatient waiting for the R.O.V., but I had to restrain myself. Once we had video evidence, we could rush into the chamber and put a stop to this.

I knew whatever was going on in the chapel was nothing but new age hokum, ancient practices cherry-picked and mixed with modern spiritualism, but something about the rise and fall of the chanting and the shadows playing over the walls and floor made me shudder. We were halfway to the chapel, near the middle set of buttresses, when Jorge nudged me on the shoulder. I stopped in my tracks and stood next to him, looking at the spinning greyscale camera footage as the R.O.V.’s forward infrared camera un-stowed itself. Jorge zoomed in and switched to video.

Orange flames licked the air from oil lamps set in the corners of the room, casting polygonal shadows of the pelican cases strewn across the floor. They didn’t offer much light, but they provided enough to give us a glimpse of James, kneeling behind a reed mat in front of the serdab, encircled by a thin cloud of smoke from the incense burning in a brass bowl.

I don’t know how long we stared at the screen in disbelief as he chanted, rocking gently back and forth in time with his speech. An aura of red light poured over James’ face, rising and falling with the intensity of his voice. The way the camera was placed, I couldn’t tell where this light was coming from. My thoughts raced to the Ka Statue.

"Can you get a view of the inside of the serdab? I want to check something out." I whispered.

"Not unless you want me to move the R.O.V.."

I thought of the noised it made earlier that day navigating the empty chamber, it's rubber caterpillar treads squeaking over the floor, servo motors whining, mechanical brakes clicking. It wasn't an option. I glanced at the red glow, advancing and receding down the passageway like the tide coming in. My curiosity got the better of me, and I found myself being drawn up the passageway.

“Hey, are you nuts or something?” Jorge hissed under his breath. “Derrick, get back here!”

My actions felt like someone else’s. I was dimly aware of something in the back of my mind causing me to walk up the center of the passage. I wasn’t trying to hide, but I don’t think I needed to. James was too entranced to notice me as I neared the top of the passageway, bringing the chamber into view. My heart pounded in my chest, sending blood that had turned to ice through my veins as I looked through the haze of smoke into the glowering eyes of the Ka statue. They were almost hypnotic. I felt lightheaded as I made eye contact with those shifting red eyes. My world spun.

I was back in the nightmare, the one I thought I’d stopped having. The one where all I can hear is her haunting voice calling out for me as I fight the river’s current. I can see her, drifting further underwater, about to be ripped away from me. Sunken snags reach up for her from the river floor with rotting, blackened limbs. I dive after her shadowy form, reaching helplessly back for me.

This is usually the part I clasp her hand in mine and clamp down on it with all my strength, not wanting her to slip away again. This time, the sight of another figure, rowing an ancient boat along the river bottom scares me so bad I stop short. I recognize it from the chapel mosaic, only now it has the same glowing red eyes as the ka statue. Its silhouetted form reaches out with sharp, angular limbs, summoning her to join it. I fight the current with renewed fury, lungs burning, but I pay no attention. I’ve dreamed this nightmare enough times not to care about drowning, not when she’s so close. I almost have her hand in mine when I’m caught in the forked branches of a submerged tree. They wrap tighter and tighter around my chest. My vision blurs and lungs burn with an intensity I’ve never experienced. I inhale filthy river water tasting like death and decay a second before I’m ripped back to reality.

Jorge squeezed my chest from behind and I vomited water from my lungs onto the floor. My vision swam with bright dots and I gradually became aware of the fact I was no longer in the chapel. Jorge muttered something as I coughed up the rest of the earthy water onto the stairway to the tomb.

“Get up man, we can’t stay here!” The R.O.V. controller shook in his terrified hands as he half-dragged me up the stairs. A gust of air ripped from the mouth of the tomb, carrying a muffled, inhuman screech. Airborne mites of sand scratched at my eyes as we struggled to the top of the stairway and ran back to camp.

"What the hell was that, Derrick? What the hell happened to you?" He panted, a bit too loud for comfort. I didn’t know what to tell him. I felt a strange sense of guilt for the trance I was lured into. I didn’t want him or Sam to question my mental state.

“I just had to know,” I started, not sure how to end the sentence. “I had to find out about the Ka statue’s eyes.”

“We’re just damn lucky you didn’t get us caught,” Jorge said, his sidelong glance betraying his skepticism.

We must have sounded half-crazy when Sam let us in her tent. Recounting James’ ritual, the noises we heard, the thing we saw. My heart raced. Jorge ‘needed’ a cigarette. He refrained from mentioning my trance, but I registered uneasiness in his expression when he looked at me.

“You’re sure it was James?” Sam asked us for the fifth time.

“I know that creep when I see him,” Jorge said, exhaling smoke with his words. We caught him red-handed, doing whatever that was.”

“He’s obviously a threat to the expedition.” Sam grimaced as Jorge took another drag.

“Yeah, I got that part. What are we supposed to do about it?”

“We need to get ahold of someone with authority,” I said. “Someone with the Egyptological Society who can actually do something about this.”

“Yeah. It’s too bad Felix ain’t back yet. Is there somebody else we can talk to? Surely, they got someone else who’s a stand-in for him.”

Sam glanced upward, searching through her memory for someone, anyone who might be able to help.

“What about Elaine?”

“No,” I shook my head. “She’s technically not even a member of the dig team. Forget who’s on site, we need to report this to someone at the expedition’s Senior Archaeologist level.”

“Who’s that?”

“Professor Ossendorf,” Sam frowned. “I suppose we could try him, but I don’t know how much help he’ll be. Something this far-fetched might be hard for him to believe.”

“He don’t have to believe us,” Jorge said, taking a final drag from his Camel unfiltered before crushing it on the heel of his shoe. “We got camera footage to prove everything we saw.”

“Do you have the files with you?”

“Naw,” Jorge shook his head. “They get stored on a hard drive inside Rover. I’d have to download ‘em. It wouldn’t take me more than a few minutes.”

“Here’s what we need to do,” I said. “Tomorrow, we’ll get the video files off the R.O.V., We email Ossendorf first thing. Hopefully, he can help us before James disrupts anything else on site.”
