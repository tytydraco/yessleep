No one will hear me scream for help while they are ripping my body apart. But you, you have to know this.

Hi, I am Joshua and I'm currently hiding in a locker while writing this. I don't know who- or, what- they are, I just know I need help. I am face-to-face with my death right now, and I think my ending is imminent. But how did all happen?


A few days ago, I was invited to one of my best friends' wedding. I didn't want to go, because I hate his bride, but I had to repay him somehow after he saved me that day. They rented a cabin in the Hoia Baciu woods, in Romania, which- I should have guessed- it was a bad idea, but I've never been the superstitious type of person. I never believed in the supernatural and would hardly get bored.

And yet, I am shitting myself right now.

I don't know how it happened, but two nights ago I started to see them. Glowing eyes looking at me from the woods. Probably because of the loud music. Last night, they thought it would be funny to put on loud shrieks and whiteboard scratch sounds to annoy the "animals" in the forest. We never believed they would get annoyed, but last night, they came right in the opening, where we could see them.

Skinny, grey creatures, with glowing eyes and on all-fours, looking at us from the woods.
We didn't even think about leaving. Thought they were racoons or something. I knew it wasn't a racoon though.

And this evening, we saw them in plain light. We had enough. We wanted to leave. We couldn't call 911 because almost every phone was drained from the other night. So here we were. Defenceless. Against a horde of unknown creatures. And when they saw we were packing, they attacked.

They went after anyone they saw, and those who got caught got killed in the worst ways ever. I saw disemboweled, headless and dismembered bodies. Hell, I even saw the bride with weird eggs all over her lifeless corpse. Some of them would rape their victims before killing them and some were smart enough to lock doors, ultimately trapping their victims. 

I initially hid in the kitchen, where I found 4 other survivors, but they got through our defenses. I managed to escape through a vent, and got in a hallway, where I almost got killed. I would soon find myself at the second floor, falling through a hole in the floor, and I got in this storage.

I have my car keys, and my car is somewhere in the parking lot. It doesn't look damaged, I can see it from the window, but I won't be able to open it. I already tried.

I am still hearing screams, some far away, some very close to my location. I am almost out, if I just get by this corner and run across the hallway- shit, one of them just got in the room. I'll update you- if I manage to get away in time.
