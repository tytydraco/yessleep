None of it made sense. I've tried my best to understand but I just can't. That's why I have to write it all down, from the beginning, before all this drives me insane. 

Just need to collect my thoughts, walk through these last few weeks. I know when it all started. I had finally went out with my best friend Collen to the club. It had been 3 months and I finally felt ready to move on from my ex. 

That's why when I saw this bright green eyed older man across the bar I humored his advances. In almost any other situation I wouldn't but the mix of alcohol and the dulling heart break helped see him as more attractive. 

It wasn't long and before I knew it I was in this man's car and Collen was bitching me out. I didn't care. 

"Oh my god," I said drunkenly turning my head to him, "I didn't even get your name." 

He chuckles eyes on the road.

"Rodney."

Rodney, had to be around 50, 40s at least. I don't know if it was the drinks or what but his driving was horrible. Nearly ramed into the back of a car and took out two trash cans. 

When he had almost hit that car it was because he kept staring at me. We didn't talk much I got his name but really it was all we said until we got to my house. We walked to the door and I could hear my little pug, Trixie, barking wildly from the otherside. 

"Oh yea, hey before you come in let me put her up. Shes not good with stangers," I say but before I can slide into the door she runs out straight to Rodney.

"Fuck," I curse turning to them, "Trixie get back in here."

To my complete surprise Trixie, a dog who's gone feral to almost every person she's been introduced to, is jumping up this man's leg. Begging for pets and barking happily.

"Seems to like me," Rodney says smiling. 

Once we're inside I take Trixie to the backyard and from there I will be sparing with some of the details. Although one part was important. It wasn't the fucking weird "I love you"s during sex. 

When Rodney first got on top of me I noticed something was wrong with his eyes. If I looked at them long enough, or at the right angle I could swear it looked like a mask. Or like his eyes were slightly pushed back in his head, like I could see a tiny gap between his eyes and their sockets. 

He left after, I asked him to. I felt disgusted afterwards. I stayed in the shower until the hot water stopped, and when I got out I went straight to bed. That next morning I was gifted not only a hangover but a meriad of unwanted texts. 

A "goodmorning beautiful boy," at 5 AM followed by ten "hello?"s and ending at the most recent with. "I need to be inside you forever." All these messages being sent from a new contact simply marked with 3 heart emojis.

What the fuck this guys a creep, which I should have definitely noticed sooner. Blocking the number I called Collen to tell him what happened. 

"Bitch, call the cops. I told you not to go home with him."

I rolled my eyes.

"Im not gonna call the cops. Hes just fucking weird."

"I would get a restraining order or something. You never know with people."

I sighed. I'd delt with creeps before and even though this had to be the creepiest I wasn't all that worried.

"You wanna pick me up and hang out. I really to get out."

"Damn bitch again?" Collen said laughing. "Well I would but I'm busy today. I'm sorry." 

"For real?"

"Yea gotta get me some too. Once you left last night I unfortunately didn't get as lucky."

"Right," I say annyoned, "well I'll talk to you later then."

I spent the rest of the day in bed. The loneliness really setting in. My mind finds it's way to Tom, my ex. It's always during times like this, it's why I try my best not to be alone. I don't have much in terms of family to spend time with besides my sister who, since she married that prick Brad, I barely see anymore. 

Tom wasn't horrible, and I wasn't perfect either. He was just so jealous. It didn't matter if I was out with Collen, my only guy friend, or out with some girlfriends he was always so hurt about it. Constant messages and calls when I wasn't around him. I loved him but it got to be too much after three years. I couldn't dwell too long so I decided to make dinner.

I left Trixie out for the night and was washing dishes in the kitchen when I heard her barking. Which is very normal but something about the tone of her bark reminded me of the time she nearly died fighting a racoon. So I grabbed a kitchen knife and made my way to the back. 

Opening the door the light on the back porch only goes so far before its met by a wall of darkness. Trixie stood right at its border, barking into the night on full alert. 

"Baby what's wrong?"

She kept barking, wearing her little voice cords out until suddenly; she stopped, titled her head and punched into the black. 

"Trixie!" I screamed.

It didn't sound like she went far as I could hear her panting in what sounded like excitement. Right were the light met the dark. It was there a silhouette came out into the light. 

"So you just throw everyone away?"
I knew that voice.

"Rodney?" I gripped the knife higher, "What the fuck are you doing here?"

He slowly stepped closer. 

"You blocked me. How else was I supposed to see you again Shai?" He's crying and now I can see his face. 

He looks so sad and honestly unthreating in this moment. Sniffling like a child and wipping his nose. His shoulders bouncing to his sobs. But his eyes, the ones too deep for there sockets, look so angry. 

"I'm calling the fucking cops!" I scream pulling my phone from my pocket. 

"Wait! Please just let me in to explain!" The rage and desperation in this voice pushing me back into my house as I dial. 

Trixie is hoping around his legs, clawing for his attention. 

"Trixie get inside now!" 

With my attention drawn to my dog Rodney saw an opportunity to attack. He lunged towards me. It caught me off guard but I was able to jump back and slam the door catching the fingers on this right hand. I pulled hard until I heard them pop and break.

"You fucking bitch!" He screamed pulling his mangled finger out of the door. 

By then I heard his whimpering curses trail off and the fence around my yard jingle to what I assume him climbing over. I swung the door open letting Trixie in. I was worried he'd have hurt her after I broke his fingers but she was luckily.

"Thanks for the help." I say as she wags her tail.

I called the cops and when they showed up I told them everything I could about Rodney and that night. They did a sweep of my house and the perimeter, asked if there was anyone I could stay with tonight. Unfortunately Collen was "busy" so I reluctantly called me sister after the police left. 

She picked me up and nearly blew my head up with all the questions. I was just so tired and with her berating me along with Trixie barking at every passing car I couldn't handle it. I was ready to jump out of that car when we finally pulled up to her house. 

I wasn't having it anymore and luckily Brad was already asleep so I beelined it to the guest bedroom and passed out. I spent the next few days couped up in that room. Only coming out for doordash and to let Trixie out. That's when around noon the fourth day a detective was standing at the front door asking for me. 

"You must be Shai?" He extends a hand and shakes mine, "I'm Henry nice to meet you." 

"Did you find him?" I ask hoping I can finally return home.

"Rodney was found dead in an alley downtown. I came here to ask you if you can remember anything else from that night that could help us."

I was shocked. He was dead? I stepped outside closing the door behind me to avoid my sisters snoopyness. I told him everything I could which was everything he already knew. 

"Thank you for your time. I'd advise you stay with your sister until we get this sorted out. If you remember anything else please," He hands me a card with his contact information, "call me."

Once he left my sister pressed me for what was going on. I just ignored her and went to the room locking myself in. Collen tried calling but I didn't pick up. I just wanted to be alone. I remembered Rodney's eyes, how angry he looked. Not only that he said my name. 

That's really bugged me because the night we met when I asked him for his he never asked for mine. I mean sure he did go through my phone and put his number in. To top it all off was Trixie. As long as I've had her there's alone been a handful of people she likes that way and she's never treated a stranger like that. 

All this stress and tension came to a head the next day. I guess after I wouldn't tell my sister what happened she stormed out. Which is very normal of her however she didnt come back till later that night. In the morning I came to confronter her about it. It'd be better to just tell her now rather have an argument and make my stay here that much more unbearable.

She was sitting in the living room when I came out. It was then when she turned to me I froze. My sister has hazel eyes, it was kinda the talk of the family since no one else did. But they were always on the browner side. For some reason, they looked so green.

"Hello, Shai." She smiled, and it looked so forced like she was holding back a tidelwave of screams. And her eyes so green and full of rage.

It was then I noticed; that is not her smile, those are not her eyes and this is not my sister.
