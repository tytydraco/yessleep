As the title suggests, I have no idea what is happening. Well- I should start where it first began, back in 2019. It was a Monday morning, the sun was shining through our windows and the smell of fresh coffee washed over the apartment. Me and my husband lived in a small apartment alone. (With 2 lovely cats) I will admit I was always spooked when I was home alone. We lived on the 4th floor which was the highest floor of the building, so seeing shadows or figures outside the window was extremely unsettling. it was never occasional, maybe once or twice every month. I worked as a cashier at our local grocery store, surprisingly it made a decent payroll, decent enough to live off of anyway. One day I had came home around 5:30pm. I went to close our curtains since I never liked them open especially near night. I made dinner, cleaned, and showered.I heard the door slam close, I was startled but I just assumed my husband was just having a bad day. I realized the dinner probably went cold, I never make dinner this early. I went over to the kitchen table and grabbed the plates to reheat them, but as I was walking over I noticed my husbands shoes weren’t where they usually are. At this point it was 8pm, he should’ve been home 10 minutes ago. “Maybe he didn’t take his shoes off“ I thought. I was spooked but once again, brushed it off as me being an over thinker. As I was sitting down and about to call my husband over I hear the door open and close lightly and my husband calling out “I’m home!”Shivers went down my spine, then who was the one to slam the door? I ran to him and grabbed his arm, “Ezzy (His nickname)” I said almost to tears. I was terrified, what if there was a murderer in our apartment? I’m not a big fan of paranormal things and a bigger non-fan of true crime. it all scared me to much. I told him about it and he told me he wouldn’t leave me alone in the apartment for a second to calm me down. That was also the day the figures showed up in the windows daily. I noticed it while eating, I started bawling and didn’t eat a single bite.The week later I covered our windows so I couldn’t see anything outside. I installed extra lights and security cameras. It was expensive but I could afford it with my money. My husband tried his hardest to understand but anybody could tell he thought it was ridiculous.Then the knocking started, everyday at 6:45am. Sometimes it would be violent slamming and kicking, or just a calm single knock. When this started happening I couldn’t even go to work without completly breaking down, so I followed my husband. I took drastic measures, called the police. After awhile a deputy moved in the room next to us. I made sure a security camera was outside the door, usually nothing eerie happened. During the knocking there would be a but of static sounds but nothing else. Nothing was reassuring me anymore. This continued until 2021, September. Where when me and my husband would wake up to shattered glass in the kitchen, nothing was destroyed. Just random fucking glass. (please excuse my language) When i first saw it, blood was on the floor. I wasn’t hurt. I couldn’t breathe for a second and fainted.At this point I’m petrified of what the next stage would be, would we wake up to scars next? Or blood covered furniture? I called the deputy over, he inspected it and said to just ignore it. I was furious, ignore what? This is delusional! I suggested moving into another area but husband said that this is nothing, and it’s not worth moving away over. I was more frustrated. We shouldn’t be dumb characters like in horror movies. This is why they all die!I calmed myself down and searched tips on things like these. This is when I started excessively using evil eye bracelets, crystals, manifesting, all that shit. If you don’t know, usually when an evil eye absorbed to much negative (or “evil”) energy the bracelet will break. This applies the same to certain crystals. I put crystals everywhere, wore bracelets and made my husband wear them too. I could tell my husband was getting tired of this. He was a loving and patient man so he dealt with my shenanigans. Most of the stuff eventually broke not even two months after buying them. I bought more, and more. (P.S, all of the things I bought other than the evil eye bracelets are used with my money, independently.) This time I didn’t use them all at once, eventually it started going away. I was better and I felt safer. I still didn’t risk anything though, I dialed down on my crystal’s and bracelets, still having about 10 of them each in the closet. (BTW I didn’t get hexxed, even if I did the egg cleansing stuff) 

It is now 2022,Petrified, we are moving very soon. I don’t think I’ll still feel safe. I don’t know what’s happening. I came home with my husband after spending a whole day at the theme park, to come home to a dark gloomy room. As soon as I stepped into the apartment I fell down and covered my ears, static was absolutely SWARMING the whole room. my husband stepped back and fell and tried to grab me to pull me out. I started crying when he successfully pulled me out. We called the deputy over but he just smiled at us.this leads us to now, he’s smiling at us and I don’t know what to do. I think I see hands growing out of the walls. Me and my husband agree without even looking at each other that we need to run.

Its actually been months since I last wrote, and we don’t know if we are safe. Sometimes I hear a hint of that static sound and I feel sick every time I do. For now, all I know is that it’s not hurting me directly, and that’s all I need to sleep at night.
