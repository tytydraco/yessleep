It had been the summer of that year, six full weeks to piss about and do absolutely nothing! So, when a good friend of mine extended his usual invite to hang about at his house… how could I say no?

His house was one of those old farmhouses, not quite decrepit but certainly not far off it; sixteen acres of land sprawling across the British countryside that most notably, led out into a wood.

There had been all sorts of stories about it, or at least my friend told me so. Did I take him seriously? No of course I didn’t, looking back on it I don’t even think he was taking himself seriously. 

It was all rubbish about ghosts and what not, some poor woman had hung herself however long ago and her wailing spirit had ‘wandered betwixt the trees ever since’. I don’t really remember the details; it’s been a while since this all happened.

The dusk faded as the sun fell below the horizon, the plan had been simple, we would sneak out after his parents fell asleep and like, kick about in the woods? We were never the smartest bunch to be honest. It was the closest we could get to camping and I guess that’s all the incentive we needed.

Darkness swallowed what had been left of the light and we sat in the garden, there had been three of us that night; From memory, we told stories or something? Again, it’s been a while. 

We saw the lights in the house dissipate and we were left the dull crackle of the fire and the soft glow of its dying embers. With a somewhat startling clap of his hands, Richard jolted from his seat.

“Right then my dear friends! Let’s get to work.”

His tone was clearly mocking, Josh hadn’t been looking so hot all night and whether that was from fear or his overconsumption of marshmallows I couldn’t tell, though the answer is pretty obvious looking back on it. 

The two of them had been my good friends for years, they’d been with me through everything you could think of, bullying, breakups and broken bones included. I gave Josh a reassuring pat on the back and the three of us started towards the woods.

Silence permeated the expedition, I think we were all scared shitless and just far too proud to admit it. I liked the woods, during the day that is when the crunch of a leaf or the snap of a twig doesn’t send you reeling in search of an imaginary murderous cannibal! We had been moving in silence for maybe, ten minutes? When, Josh spoke up.

“This is boring! Can we just go back and…”

His voice was cut off abruptly by Richard who, in a low whisper and through gritted teeth said.

“Hey! Shut up, you think we’re being quiet because we want to?”

He cocked his head and I could see the panicked expression carved onto his face, he held a pale finger to his lips.

“I don’t want to get done in by the Gamekeeper, these woods aren’t all mine and well they say he’s a bit… Crazy”

The irony of his condemnation of speech was funny to me at the time, after all we were shining flashlights through the trees like lunatics. Even now, I doubt being quiet would’ve kept us concealed. Over tree trunk and river, we crept and I began to question Richard ‘s decision to leave out the crazy Gamekeeper and why we’d really come out in the first place.

Our flashlights illuminated the suffocating confines of the darkness, like headlights they searched over tree after tree after… Then there they were, three tallies carved like crooked fingers into the soft flesh of a single tree’s trunk. I remember running my finger through the groove in the wood, it was rough and crude and seemingly pointless. We moved on soon after, the hysteria over the ‘tally of doom’ fading back into the usual silence.

Boredom had set in, why exactly had Richard made us come out here and why had we obliged? I had thought at the big age of thirteen I was a grown-up, spared from fear, how wrong I’d been. The enforced silence made it worse I had heard every creak in the trees, every muntjac’s howl as it pierced the silence like a bullet and every footstep upturning freshly fallen leaves

Step after step, my feet ached, I hadn’t brought my walking shoes and that had been my main concern at the time; By this point I had the rhythm of our steps down, Richard had heavier steps whilst Josh had lighter ones and well, I knew my own. That’s why I found it so odd when a fourth set began crunching in the leaves somewhere behind us.

The silence continued, I said nothing as if ignoring it meant it wasn’t happening. My flashlight groped the bark of the trees as I tried to block out the thought of the Gamekeeper being behind me. But then there it was again, the trio of tallies.

Richard looked up and let out a sigh and muttered a series of incessant swears.

“God dammit!”

His voice echoed of the trees and through the empty air. I opened my mouth to respond but in his usual fashion he silenced me with a wild gesture.

“Look I don’t want to hear it! I know we’ve gone in circles and whatever, I just went the wrong way that… that’s all”

A fruitless attempt to quiet the discontent arising in our party, it reassured me even less than it had him. I turned to Josh and we exchanged some whispered banter at the expense of our not so gracious ‘tour guide’ who had already taken off into the dark, this time in the opposite direction.

Together, we walked for maybe another twenty minutes? Time wasn’t really a concept in that endless darkness. I was contented I suppose, at the very least our footsteps were once again very much… Alone.

Soon, we swapped the scenery for a dewy field; we’d reached the forest’s boundary! We all sighed in relief, far more startled than we were letting on or at least I was. Richard pointed to the far side of the clearing, to a cluster of trees doing a poor job of concealing a lake hiding behind them, like a toddler playing hide and seek. This is what he had wanted to show us and to his credit it was beautiful.

We started into the grass, it was taller than us, or at least it felt like it was. One foot after the other we snuck closer and closer to our journey’s end. I couldn’t see my companions they, like me, were having just so much fun traversing the grasping confines of wet grass. Coughing and spluttering I, like a cascade, crashed out from the field and right back into familiar surroundings… The woods.

Thorns and nettles pricked at my backside as I pulled myself from their grip and to my feet, soon after me came Josh in a similar fashion. I had helped him to his feet expecting the third of our band to emerge and yet but he never did.

My best friend, for years, through everything and the last I would know of him was a scream?

Like a miasma it hung in the air, almost tangible and for what seemed like an eternity we stood there, frozen and unable to react. Josh’s jaw was slack and his words came out a barely perceivable cacophony of whimpers and cries.

“The… The Gamekeeper? Is… is it him… You heard those footsteps before right?”

I said nothing and did nothing, not a word in any language could have or would have reassured either him or me.

Our eyes locked for but a moment as another scream tore through the silence followed by a great tumult from the woods in which we stood. Back into the grass we ran, tearing, ripping and weaving through the blades as they tried to constrict us and deliver us to the same fate as our friend.

Into a clearing I collapsed, the bank of the lake stretched out in front of me. A journey’s end.

Silence was all that followed me. I turned and shone my flashlight like a lighthouse in a storm and prayed it would lead Josh straight to me but it never did.

Alone with my thoughts I slumped on that desolate bank, the water still and calm. I looked out into the dark, despite the valiant efforts of my flashlight it did not penetrate the void of the lake. I threw a pebble into the surface and wept… I wanted my mum; I wanted to go home. 

I remember thinking of all the possibilities, that my friends were dead, murdered by some crazy old bastard in the woods and soon I would join them. I don’t know how long I sat there, throwing pebbles into that mirror as it reflected my sorry state, I don’t know how long I muttered that lament for my friends. 

Tears stung the corners of my eyes as they carved their way down my flushed cheeks, the ripples of the impacted water came back to me until I ran out of stones to throw.

From that place I did not want to stir; I did not want to face what was in those woods… 

Whether it was the crazed Gamekeeper or the ghosts and in a selfish way I didn’t care. I had wanted the mud of the bank to engulf me or for me to wake up entirely; I quietly begged it had all just a been nightmare. 

With my head in my hands I began to drift into sleep, my tears using my hands as a slide to fall and dilute into the mud.

Once again, I fell into a rhythm, a twisted lullaby as I faded in and out of consciousness, the rustling of the leaves and the wind as it caressed the trees soothing me. Then came a soft rippling of the water.

It had been at least twenty minutes since I cast my last stone… the intensity of the rippling increased and I scrambled to my feet, whatever had taken my friends was now here for me.

Up the bank I fled and yet I could not, it had been far easier to come down than it was to get back up. The mud turned to slop under my grasp and I slipped and writhed as I desperately tried to clamber to my salvation. My fingers tugged on the blades of grass at the bank’s pinnacle, they ripped and tore as I failed to pull myself up and over.

“Please… No… Leave me alone!”

I began to plead with whatever was behind me, my voice was shrill and now more than ever my tears stung. Silent went the world at my cries, the rippling all together stopped and I kept my face buried in the damp earth.

Seconds, minutes, hours passed? I don’t even know how long it was before I turned around and I wish I never did. 

The water ran sanguine as a mass drifted onto the shore. Not long congealed blood clung to its face glinting in response to my abandoned flashlight’s beam. Out of their sockets its eyes bulged, pupils dilated into deep blackened moon-shaped pools. Twisted was its mouth, teeth missing whether from age or death I could not tell; It seemed to scream at me and I screamed back…

The Police found me on the bank the next morning and to be honest I don’t remember what happened after or before they did. My friends, much like me were soon found and after the events of that night we kind of drifted in and out of friendship, a shame I suppose but I guess it was for the best. 

It’s been maybe seven or eight odd years now since that night and I’ve never really moved on. The woods were fully searched and of course the body that well… found me on the bank was the Gamekeeper, he’d been missing for a week. That fact had all but confirmed my worst fears, there had been someone or something in those woods with us that night.

I went to therapy and to some support groups and well perhaps I would have forgotten about it entirely, I mean after the first few years I did. Repressed in the deepest recesses of my brain I kept it… until today.

For the first time in my life, I no longer live with my parents, I found a farmhouse for rent out in the countryside close to my university, eerily cheap and now I suppose I know the reason. Today I stepped outside and I don’t know why? I was like pulled? like it was a pre-existing thought if you get what I mean? 

My new abode leads out into the woods and on the tree nearest my property were two… tallies.
