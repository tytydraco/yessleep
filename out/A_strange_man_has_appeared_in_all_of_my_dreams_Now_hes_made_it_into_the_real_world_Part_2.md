Now I know I haven’t updated anyone in what, five years now? But if you remember, the guy I described all those years ago, he’s still trailing me.. 

It started five years ago, my work day was normal, and I came back home. 

Now what do you usually do when you come home from work? You go take a shower, get changed, get comfortable right? 

Well.. I did just that; a nice warm shower, a plush white towel from the towel rack, and some warm sweatpants. 

Everything seemed perfectly normal mind you, but the two times my eyes were obscured, when I washed my face, I could feel eyes, piercing eyes, watching me, but not from outside of the shower. My eyes shot open and I scanned the room. My eyes immediately darted over to my mirror, fogged up, but still clear enough to see. I was back to where it all began five years ago.. and I remembered exactly who I had seen, or at least believed I’d seen. 

Pale, ghost-like, but still human… a mangled, disfigured face that would only be visible one time… and that blazer…

When I looked out at the mirror, there he was. Still wearing the same blazer… that goddamn red blazer… It looked like rotten, decomposing flesh at this point.. I knew something was wrong the first time I’d seen it… It was barely hanging on to his long, slender arms by now.  Threads, or what were probably tendons, barely holding it together. His pants held up by a tan belt.. I think it was a belt… it looked like human entrails though… wriggling around his waist. 

I had a glass barrier between me and this.. thing… but every time I blinked, he got closer to the mirror, a look of malice on his face and an unnaturally large grin.. He couldn’t get out though, or so I thought.. He stared intently at me, he wanted something.
