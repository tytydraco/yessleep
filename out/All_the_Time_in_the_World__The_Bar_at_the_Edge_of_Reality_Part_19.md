As the [echoing voice faded](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12i1zu4/bad_faith_the_bar_at_the_edge_of_reality_part_18/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), the glinting silver eyes in the shadows grew larger, and a moment later, the Ancient One emerged from the darkness.

It was in its human-like form, continuing to look eerily like a fifty-year-old version of me, only with steel-colored eyes instead of my boring brown ones. I wanted to find comfort in the fact that the Ancient One had brought us here—because it was finally occurring to me that the icy fingers on my neck pressing me into unconsciousness *must* have been its doing—but I just felt uneasy more than anything. Somehow I didn’t think this was going to be a peaceful family reunion.

Faith was already getting to her feet, though her hate-filled gaze had shifted to the Ancient One, her face twisted in fury. “How dare you bring me back to you!” she spit out. “I swore I’d kill you if I ever met you face-to-face again, and you’re delusional if you think I was bluffing. I meant every word!”

And apparently she was determined to prove this, because with a wordless scream, she ran towards the Ancient One before it could reply.

…Only to continue running straight *through* it, its form wavering like a ripple in a pond as she passed to the other side.

Faith let out a string of curses. “What kind of game is this?”

“Not a game at all,” said the Ancient One in its timeless, multi-layered voice. The words flowed together and yet were disjointed at the same time, each one reverberating with a distinct pitch and melody. As if countless beings were all speaking at once, with a different speaker dominating each word. Despite hearing it before, it was still unnerving. “Merely reality.”

Faith cursed again and halfheartedly swung a knife at its arm. The Ancient One watched it pass straight through with an unblinking silver gaze. “I know you can be hurt,” she hissed.

“I can,” it agreed. “But not here.”

I glanced around us at the dense black fog. Even my own feet were hidden in shadows. The only other times I remembered this place were also when I’d been unconscious. I had a feeling this wasn’t exactly a *physical* location. Which meant the Ancient One wasn’t physically here.

“This is, like, another plane of consciousness or something, isn’t it?” I said.

The Ancient One turned to me, a small smile on its face. The skin around its silver eyes crinkled when it smiled. “Very nice,” it said. “This is a corner of consciousness all my own. When I am too weak to reach out in the physical dimensions, I still have strength here. It requires much less energy to exist without the boundaries of physics.”

“Sure,” I said. “Makes sense.”

Faith made a noise that can best be described as that of a pissed-off cat. “So you’re just a projection of your consciousness. You couldn’t even be bothered to physically face me. Coward.”

Okay, I’d already had to listen to her entire narcissistic, murderous story today, and I was done with her twisted tales. I rolled my eyes. “Its weakness has nothing to do with its desire to fight—or *not* fight—you. It was already weak from talking to me earlier.”

This turned out to be a mistake. Faith’s eyes narrowed angrily as she stalked towards me, twirling her knife in one hand. “Oh, so it wanted to talk to *you* earlier? Always the Golden Child, huh? Figures.”

My own anger boiled up in my chest like hot lava. I ripped Sgrios from my belt and held it in front of me. “Oh, give it a rest. You said it yourself—you tried to kill the Ancient One the last time it spoke to you, and you threatened to try again! That doesn’t exactly leave the door open for future father-daughter bonding, you know?”

She made a face. “That is *not* my father!”

“Not mine either,” I countered. “You *murdered* mine.”

*ENOUGH.* The Ancient One’s single word was booming and creaking with the weight of its power; it crashed through my skull, splintering my thoughts. Instinctively, I dropped the knife and fell to my knees, clasping my hands to my ears. Even the echoes of the word made my entire brain pulse in agony. I moaned and squeezed my eyes shut, trying to glue the shattered pieces of my mind back together.

It was several minutes, I think, before the pain had subsided enough for me to open my eyes and cautiously drop my hands. There were specks of blood on my palms.

“I am sorry,” said the Ancient One. “But I did not want you to fight. I brought you here, to the only place I can currently speak to you, in order to tell you the truth. All of it.”

I couldn’t help it; my curiosity was piqued. Call it my fatal flaw, I suppose: so desperate for answers and some semblance of self-identity that I’ll stop everything to listen for mere fragments of information. Wouldn’t even be the first time I’d done that *today.*

Somehow I doubted Faith would care, though.

Sure enough, I glanced over at Faith, who was picking up her fallen knife and glaring at the Ancient One as she got to her feet. There was dried blood around her ears, too. “Too little, too late,” she growled.

“It is not too late,” said the Ancient One. “It is never too late.”

“For answers, no,” I said, wielding Sgrios as I stood up. I met Faith’s gaze steadily. “For forgiveness, yes.”

The Ancient One sighed, its deep, endless kind of sigh that seemed to carry the weight of the world—and probably did. “I knew it had gone too far for amends,” it said, voice heavy with sorrow. “I am sorry I could not help you earlier. I would have if I was able. But I have been weak for a long time now.” It paused, and it sighed again before its next words, this one somehow even deeper than the first. “I have been *dying* for a long time now.”

My heart beat quicker, though whether in shock at its news or fear at the eager look in Faith’s eyes, I’m not sure. “What do you mean, dying?” I whispered, as if whispering would somehow make it better.

“It is why you have both become more unstable as you age,” said the Ancient One. “I grow weaker every day. I am merely a remnant of a world long past. I have no place in this one anymore. They do not need me. They have forgotten me. And so I fade.”

“Some people believe in you,” I argued, not entirely sure why I was even protesting. “Like Asher and Acacia!”

“Thank you, Ian, but it is not enough,” said the Ancient One. “And that is okay.”

“I thought the world needed you to exist!” I insisted. “If you die, won’t it all crumble?” I thought of my friends, of Griffin’s Edge, of all the incredible places I’d seen in my travels—both the intentional and accidental ones. “Didn’t you say you ‘brought balance to the universe’ and all that? Shouldn’t you be more concerned if all of it dies with you!?”

Faith seemed unbothered by this revelation. In fact, she was making no effort to disguise the joy on her face. I wondered just how much of a psychopath she had to be to enjoy the thought of all of existence burning.

Oh wait, I knew the answer. The kind that murders innocent beings for fun.

I shoved that thought aside before the hot lava boiling in my chest threatened to well up again. *One problem at a time, Ian.*

The Ancient One’s silver eyes sparkled in the darkness as it smiled at me. “That was true, once,” it said. “But I am no longer needed. As long as a piece of my essence survives, the world will live on.”

I met its gaze. I swear it was staring into my soul, seeing whatever part of me had been born in its silver fog.

It meant me. Us. Two fragments of itself that had become beings of their own. Beings that now hated each other and wanted to tear each other apart. How must the Ancient One feel, to have watched us over the years, to see me struggle with my jumps, to see Faith turn down the darkest of paths and continue until there was no light left at all where she tread? How did it feel, when it had seen me run to Henri’s side, knowing that she had killed my only family, that any potential bond between us had been severed before it could ever form? Knowing that it was powerless to change the course of any of it?

I didn’t want that. I didn’t want to be anything like the Ancient One. God, I hoped that’s not what it meant.

Not that I had time to ask it. In my spiral of existential crises, I’d nearly forgotten that Faith was still standing here too, and she’d apparently had a very different reaction to the Ancient One’s impending death than I had.

“The world will be better off without you,” she spit at it now, face furious. “*I* will be. Look at you, even now, favoring Ian! *Neither* of you deserve to live!”

Alright, that was enough. I know I’ve said that before and then keep getting distracted from killing Faith by other things: fighting spiders, hearing her story, talking to the Ancient One. Look, I’m not perfect, okay. Emotions are complicated. Curiosity killed the cat for a reason. Turns out it distracts the hell out of Ian too.

But that was the last straw. That hot lava burning in my chest, that anger, had been steadily boiling since I’d woken up here; now it overflowed. Heat seemed to course through my body, all the way to my fingertips and toes, setting my heart on fire. She thought *I* didn’t deserve to live? Well, what about Henri? What about all the innocent beings, human and inhuman alike, that she had murdered in cold blood? Did *they* deserve to die?

I found myself, not entirely consciously, storming forward past the Ancient One, closing the distance between me and Faith and shoving her in the chest hard enough to send her stumbling backwards. She stared back at me, her expression twisted in a grotesque blend of hatred and shock. “How *dare* you!” I shouted. “*You* don’t deserve to live, let alone make the decision for anyone else!”

She spun her knife around in her hand. “Well, luckily, only *one* of us needs to survive for the world to live.”

I tightened my grip on Sgrios. “Good.”

Eyes locked with Faith’s, I took a step sideways. So did she. Another. She copied it again. And then we were circling each other cautiously in the darkness, silent except for the quiet echoes of our footsteps and our shallow breaths.

That is, until the Ancient One stepped between us. “Stop,” it said. “Or I will send you back to the conscious plane.”

“We’ll just do the same thing there,” I warned it, never glancing away from Faith, never breaking our slow steps around our invisible circle.

“At least you cannot kill each other there!” it said, its voice shockingly human-sounding in its desperation.

Despite the fact that it had sounded more human and less all-powerful than ever before, those words seemed to hang there in the air between us more than any of its echoes ever had. Faith and I simultaneously stopped and turned to look at the Ancient One. It had never looked so fragile—so *scared.*

And for once, it only took a moment for the puzzle pieces to fall into place in my head. In the real world, the conscious one, Faith and I had never harmed each other—not directly. Sure, she’d sicced some spiders and a wolf on me, I’d sicced my friends on her, we’d chased each other plenty and *tried* to hurt each other…but I couldn’t think of a single time we’d actually injured *each other.*

What if…we couldn’t? What if, whatever bond we shared, whatever ancient essence tied us together, prevented us from harming the other?

In that world, the Ancient One could be hurt and killed, even at our hands. But Faith and I couldn’t hurt each other. In this world, the Ancient One was safe from all physical injury, even from us. That was the opposite of its normal frailty. And if we were the opposite too, by whatever absurd rules governed this ancient magic stuff…that would mean that Faith and I could hurt each other here, in this dark, subconscious place. We could kill each other here.

*Only* here.

One glance at the Ancient One’s desperate face, one glance back at the sudden understanding on Faith’s, and I knew that I was right. Or close enough, at least. And Faith had realized the same thing.

There was a split second where we made eye contact, where Faith and I both processed what we had just found out, both decided what was about to happen.

And then we charged at each other, full force, ready to end it.

We met mid-air; her knife had been better aimed than mine, and the breath was torn out of me as its blade buried itself in my ribs. I cursed and slashed downwards with Sgrios as we fell to the ground, managing to get in a slice across her shoulder. Her shirt tore open, exposing the blood that blossomed from her shoulderblade.

We hit the ground, hard, me pinning her in the darkness. I gasped as she twisted her blade deeper into my ribs, but with a grunt of pain flung us over, using the force of my knees to throw her off me.

My blood sprayed as she ripped her knife out of my abdomen, pulling it with her. She moved fast, though; I was barely on my feet before she collided with me again, aiming for my chest.

Cursing, I deflected her blow just in time, knocking into her arm so that the tip of the blade merely grazed my face, cutting upwards across my eye. Wincing as blood dripped and blocked my vision, I thrust forward with Sgrios and heard her moan as I buried it in her stomach, even if I couldn’t see the impact through the blood.

Suddenly she’d knocked my feet out from under me, and we were on the ground again, this time with her pinning me. God, I really should’ve taken Henri up on his offers to sign me up for elf-taught martial arts lessons as a kid! Elves are great in combat. Their moves would’ve been *super* helpful right about now.

Granted, I’d never expected to be fighting for my life against a serial killer in a dark semiconscious plane on the edge of existence.

Faith slashed at my neck, and I narrowly managed to twist to avoid the blow. *Focus, Ian. Too late for martial arts training.*

But while elves couldn’t help me now, dragons could. I couldn’t believe I hadn’t thought of it before. With a deep breath, I rolled to the side, just enough to get her weight off my jacket—and as she slammed me back to the ground, knocking the wind out of me yet again, I managed to rip my lighter from my pocket with my free hand.

Her knife slashed across my chest—she was *way* better with a knife than I was—and I swear I felt it hit bone. *Oof,* that hurt.

I cursed and blocked another hit, luckily keeping the contact to only my arm (still hurt though), which was enough to give me an opening. It took a moment or two to get the lighter open—I am, after all, aggressively right-handed, and I was *not* about to get rid of Sgrios to put the lighter in my right hand—but finally, I managed to click it open.

Immediately, fire burst from the lighter with a roar. Faith screeched in surprise and stumbled off me, trying to escape the flames. Heat licked my fingertips as I shielded my face with my arm, counting to five in my head before clicking the lighter shut.

I staggered to my feet, breathing heavily as the full pain of the multiple knife wounds became obvious, intending to attack Faith again and try to finish this. She was still screeching, trying to quench the last flames burning on the scorched remnants of her sleeve, the skin beneath bubbling and blistered.

But I didn’t get the chance.

*ENOUGH,* came the Ancient One’s booming voice, just as it had earlier. I fell to my knees as the reverberations bounced through my skull. *I CANNOT STOP YOU, BUT I WILL NOT WATCH YOU KILL EACH OTHER BRUTALLY IN MY HOME. BE GONE.* A pause. *AND I AM SORRY.*

Still aching, still barely able to think, I suddenly felt icy tendrils on the back of my neck, and my scrambled mind had hardly registered what that meant before I found myself slumping to the ground, the already-dark surroundings fading to even more absolute darkness, the intense silver stare of the Ancient One vanishing behind my heavy eyelids.

I woke up exhausted, sore, and still bleeding. It took a minute to piece together what had just happened; I blinked blood from my eye as I moaned, slowly stirring as I noticed the fog drifting lazily around me.

I heard a groan off to my left—*Faith!* —and it all came crashing back. Cursing, I haphazardly stumbled to my feet, flailing my knife in a way that I can only imagine resembled an uncoordinated toddler wielding a plastic sword.

Faith was standing, too, though looking as unsteady as I felt. Her clothes were in tatters, singed where they hung in burnt pieces, and most of her skin that I could see was burnt to some degree. Even the right half of her face was red and blistering from the flames of my lighter.

I *would* have felt bad, if she hadn’t deserved it. If the heat of my anger wasn’t still burning brighter than any fire could’ve.

Still, she glared at me, hatred twisting her face into a mask. “Maybe *I* can’t kill you here,” she spat, voice dripping with venom. “But I can make sure you die.”

“I thought you wanted me to see [Griffin's Edge](https://www.griffinsedgebar.com/) burn first,” I said. “Pretty inconsistent.”

She grinned, but it was humorless; the kind of smile I think a lion would have as it hungrily stalks a gazelle. “Change of plans,” she purred, now eerily calm. “Since only one of us needs to survive, and since you’re *way* more trouble than you’re worth, I think I’ll go ahead and kill you, with this promise: once you’re dead, I’ll kill myself. And the entire world, including everyone you love and everything your uncle built, will collapse with me.”

My heart stopped. “You wouldn’t.”

Her wicked grin only widened. “You underestimate how far I’ll go,” she hissed. “What better revenge on the worlds that didn’t accept me than to destroy them all? And *you* won’t be around to stop me. You’ll simply have to die knowing what will happen after.”

Then she whistled. And I had a horrible idea I knew what that meant. I’d encountered her wolves one too many times—both normal and antlered—and though I had no earthly idea where the hell she was *getting* these wolves, a sinking feeling in my gut insisted the whistle would be summoning at least one of those beasts.

And the wolves? Uh, yeah, *they* could kill me.

I cursed mentally as she simply stared at me, still grinning that awful creepy grin. I didn’t have much time. Once her murderous backup arrived, I was done for. She could watch while they tore me apart, and I could do nothing here to harm her.

What did I have? My friends. But they had no idea where we were in the fog, and me running away wouldn’t do any good. There was a higher chance of a wolf finding me first than of me finding my friends that fast. I had no idea if we were even in the same place in the fog as we’d been before our trip to the subconscious.

Honestly, it probably didn’t matter. This fog seemed to have a mind of its own.

*Come on, Ian, think! You’ve got to figure something out.*

…Figure it out. *Figure it out.* What had Faith said before she’d dragged me off? She’d made some kind of silver rope from the fog and said that we had more power than I knew…if only I’d had time to figure it out.

Well, no time like the present, right?

Breathing heavily, heart racing, still feeling the weight of Faith’s hungry gaze, I went against every screaming instinct in my body and did the only thing I could think of to try to focus: I closed my eyes.

“Don’t want to see your death coming, hmm?” taunted Faith. I ignored her and took a deep breath. *You can do this, Ian.*

I would love to tell you that my motivational self-talk was instantly effective. But, uh, it was not. I tried to look inward, to look for whatever was inside of me that came from the Ancient One, to whatever power must be lying dormant. I knew it was there; I just had no idea how to unlock it. Where was that magical strength when I needed it!?

*Not* wherever I was looking, apparently, because suddenly I was flung off my feet, finding myself wheezing for breath as I landed—\*hard—\*on the ground. And then pain exploded in my leg as massive teeth sank into my thigh, and I opened my eyes to see an antlered wolf whipping me around like a chew toy.

My vision began to spot from the pain. I was afraid it might tear my leg off. Groaning, I stabbed Sgrios into the most vulnerable part I could reach: its large golden eye.

The wolf howled and dropped me several feet to the ground, where I gasped at the impact and instantly began to drag myself away, leaving a trail of blood as I pulled my numb leg along behind me.

“There’s more where that came from,” taunted Faith behind me, and my heart sank as I heard a chorus of growls and snarls.

I stopped moving, my breaths ragged as I laid on my elbows.

The wolves were there immediately, though this time they didn’t attack right away. Instead, they fanned out in a circle, surrounding me on every side with a wall of rancid breath and fangs the size of my forearms.

Faith stood in between two of them, looking down at me. “Any last words?” she asked, eyes glinting eagerly. “I think I’ll enjoy your death more than any other.”

“Thanks,” I said. “I’m flattered.” And closed my eyes.

I can’t really tell you the sequence of events that happened next, because I’m honestly not sure what order they happened in. But here’s my best guess.

This time, when I closed my eyes, I didn’t just focus on myself and the Ancient One and whatever supposed power I could tap into. I thought of where my strength really comes from: Milo, and Asher, and Acacia. All of the guests at Griffin’s Edge. Most of all, Uncle Henri. Henri, comforting me when I cried. Henri, healing my wounds. Henri, promising me that no matter what was going on with me, we’d figure it out—together.

*That’s* how I wanted to figure things out. Together, with my friends. With my family.

And that’s how I would do it.

I can’t really explain it, but when I focused on that instead, I suddenly felt my own power. It was…odd. Like a shift in my aura. Silvery and shining, moonlight reflecting off a lake. And when I felt it, I *knew.* I knew where my friends were in the fog, and I knew how to lead them to me.

It was easy, actually. Like molding clay. I don’t know if this all happened in one second or five minutes, but it felt like only a moment. Suddenly I could see them in my mind’s eye, and I could see the fog drifting lazily around them, and I could mentally reach out and twist that fog, compress it down into a thin silver thread—a thread that led right to me.

And at the same time or maybe before or maybe after, the wolves attacked. I felt teeth tear into my skin, felt claws meet bone, and I knew that I was dying, but I also saw the silver thread, and I saw my friends running toward us, and I knew they were almost here—

And then my consciousness was slipping and my vision was dancing with black spots but the wolves were dropping around me, ashen handprints stark against their pale fur, and Faith was shrieking in pain as water flowed from her mouth, arcing through the air towards Milo, and her skin began to shrivel.

And I heard my heart beat in my ears, fought to stay awake, as Asher pulled Sgrios from my fingers and threw himself at Faith’s drying, burnt body, his dark eyes burning with an icy fury as he buried my knife straight into her heart.

Faith slumped to the ground, blistered and dehydrated and bleeding, her eyes staring glassily into mine, and even as the world seemed to echo and each blink made it harder to reopen my eyes, I saw the wisp of silver float away as her soul returned to our birthplace.

They knelt beside me, then. My friends. I was bleeding and my skin was hanging in flaps and blood was in my eyes and my leg was attached to my body by only a few tendons and my heartbeat was slowing down. Everything sounded like it was underwater, muffled and distant. Acacia held my hand. Milo was crying, I think. Asher whispered that we’d done it, we’d killed her, and it was over because I’d led them to me.

I remember thinking, *It kind of sucks that we killed her but the world is still going to die since I’m dying too, that’s really anti-climactic.*

But in the final few seconds, the Ancient One was there. Time seemed to stand still in the space between two heartbeats.

*Thump.* One heartbeat.

*Ian,* said the Ancient One’s whispering voice, and I swear I could see it silver eyes piercing through the fog. *Ian, I am passing my strength to you so that you may live. I am dying already. It does not do me good to keep living.* A deep sigh. *You are the future the world needs. My time is past.*

Even barely alive, I found that I could respond. *I don’t want to be what you are.*

It laughed, and somehow that laugh was the happiest it had ever sounded. *And you will not be. You are you. That will not change. But you will not die. Now, or ever. You are…more.*

Immortality. That’s what it was. I didn’t want that either, not really. I knew the weight of life and of time that Henri had carried.

But it was that, or I doomed the world. And they didn’t deserve that. None of them. They deserved a protector, someone to provide a place where all creatures were welcome, someone to make all dimensions safer and better.

Henri had done his best to make that a reality, but there was still work to do. And hey, if he could handle it, so could I. He’d made sure of that.

So I said, *Okay.*

The Ancient One sighed, but for the first time, it was a sigh of contentment, of acceptance, of peace. *Thank you,* it whispered on the breeze. *Ian, I am sorry things have turned out this way. But I am glad to leave the world in your hands. And your uncle would be immeasurably proud.*

*I know,* I said. *I hope you can rest.*

*So do I,* said the Ancient One. *Goodbye, Ian. Good luck.*

*Thump.* Second heartbeat.

I jerked upright with a gasp, as if taking the first breath of air after nearly drowning. The pain was gone. I looked down; everything was healed. No blood, no teeth marks, no visible bones or tendons. Even my clothes were sewn back together. It was impossible to tell that they’d been slashed, torn, and ripped off in the last few hours.

There was one other thing: my aura. You know how powerful beings give off a particular energy, kind of an aura of strength and immortality and power beyond their appearance? How I said I was good at recognizing that energy after growing up around Henri and Griffin’s Edge?

Yeah. I had that. I could see it, this faint silver energy emitted from my skin. Most people wouldn’t notice it, not visibly, at least. They’d sense it, though, with a prickling sense that I was more than I looked. Even humans get that gut instinct in the presence of powerful beings, though they’re not always sure why.

It was…weird. If I’d been working at Griffin’s Edge and saw a being with my aura walk in, I’d have thought it was ancient. Immortal and powerful, like Henri. Someone to be extra respectful of, someone I *definitely* shouldn’t piss off.

But now it was me. And I was just…me.

I finally raised my eyes to see Asher, Acacia, and Milo all staring at me in shock. Milo grabbed my hand and put it on his shoulder. “Pinch me,” he demanded. “I need to make sure I’m not hallucinating your miraculous recovery in my grief.”

I pinched him. He squeaked and punched me in the arm. “You told me to!” I insisted.

Me speaking seemed to break the spell. Acacia laughed and hugged me so tightly I could barely breathe. Asher wrapped an arm around me with a grin. “You’re different,” he whispered in my ear.

So he could tell. Of course he could. I grinned and got to my feet. “Come on,” I said. “I have *so much* to tell you on the way [back to Griffin's Edge](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1377uig/best_friends_forever_the_bar_at_the_edge_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)."
