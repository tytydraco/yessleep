For eight years I’ve been too terrified to reveal the secrets that I know. My life has never been one of value. I’m not sure I even fear death. Even through anonymity there’s a chance I will be found out. So, why come forward now? It’s simple. I no longer have anything to live for. Pain and torture, followed by the relief of death seems far better to me now than long drawn out suffering, isolated, drowning in my own madness. I no longer have to worry about the consequences of my actions harming others. I have no wife, no kids, or a family. My mother was the last connection I had to the world. She passed last month and the age of eighty-six. Both of my parents were only children and I myself am an only child. If anyone is related to me by blood we have no knowledge of one another. Because of these reasons I forfeit my own safety, which was once promised to me, by telling you all the truth. So that I may finally find some peace.

Before I get into I am laying down some rules. The names and places involved in the horrific murders that took place from 1981 to 2016 may be changed at my discretion out of respect for the victims and their families, unless otherwise stated. I do not wish to lead people blindly to their deaths or to turn small towns or businesses into media circuses. Through my telling you might think you have an idea where these places are or who these people might be, however, it is fortunate that without specifics there will be no way to narrow it down. I feel confident in this. I will not ruin anyone else’s life. For now, take this story as a fool’s confession, a cautionary tale, or even a work of fiction, if that helps.

Besides, I don’t believe there is much we can do. There are forces beyond the good deeds and will of men. A lot of these forces even think they are doing us a service. They keep information under lock and key for our benefit. Then there are the others. The one’s we should all fear, that will gorge themselves on hose that get too close, or get too unlucky. Sometimes they just want to play before having themselves a snack.

I apologize. This is vague and I hardly know what I’m doing or how to start. In another life I was a journalist. I didn’t work for any of the big outlets. Small papers here and there. A magazine article. Freelance work for anyone who would pay for half-assed investigative pieces. My longest tenure was for a tabloid that published both physical works and online pieces on their website. This is where I was employed at the time of my discovery. It paid well enough. I could afford my rent and indulge myself at bars.

Don’t get me wrong. I once took my work seriously. But at the time, my dreams of making a name for myself, breaking a big story, taking down the criminal underworld were as good as dead. During the days and early evenings, when I wasn’t hashing out a piece about sewer cults, practicing satanism and cannibals from a half-blind witness, I still held onto those goals, however tentatively. I did it, like I would a smoke break. A few minutes every hour. I did it. With little passion. Then they came. And I don’t know which one I answered the door for first. The depression or the booze. But they were such good company. I started to get off on the self-pitying rants I forced upon any stranger or regular who happened by my stool. Some stayed for awhile, others left as soon as their cosmopolitan hit the bar.

The story really begins on August 15^(th) , 2014. I was drunkenly ranting about how I couldn’t find a story to save my life. And it was all the internet’s fault. Too many laws prohibiting “true” investigative journalism. Fifty years earlier and I would’ve been the real deal. The truth was: I was a coward. I was lazy. What I really wanted was a story to fall into my lap. That’s what I was thinking about in the back of my mind. My girlfriend of eight on and off years had finally and officially broken up with me. She had called me a coward.

I planned to drink myself into a stupor by downing Jacks and Cokes. An old man who was also a regular and the only other patron that night got caught in my storm as he waited for the bartender who took his time retrieving a bottle from the back. The old man heard me bitch for a few years now. He would nod his head and talk back a little from time to time. He paid me a little more attention when I told him Jessica had left me. Maybe he could relate because for once there was sympathy in those glazed cataract eyes.

The bartender came back. I ordered my fifth jack and coke in less than an hour. That’s what I liked about the shitty bartender and his shitty bar. Since I wasn’t a violent drunk he never cut me off. The old man patted me on my back, said he was sorry and that I’d find someone else and scuttled back to his booth.

After I was served, the bartender turned his attention to the television hanging from the corner of the bar that played sports highlights. With no one to talk to I turned to my drink and thought: I’m ruined, aren’t I? I’m a broken man.

Then the most inexplicable thing happened. It won’t sound inexplicable at first, but here it god. A big man. And I mean HGH corn-fed big. Parked his ass next to me. It was like watching a grizzly bear wiggling himself onto a child’s stool. I was shocked it didn’t crumple underneath him.

“You’re a journalist, huh?” he asked matter-of-factly. His voice was much softer and articulate than I would’ve exptected by his appearance. There was a slight southern tinge to his accent that must’ve been diluted from years of wandering. His face was clean shaven but red and cooked from the sun. Atop his head was deep brown hair, wild and greasy. He wore a black moth-eaten shirt underneath a raggedy pair of old denim overalls tucked into worn-out, black laceless work boots. Strangest of all, was the clean, smooth black cloak draped over his shouders. The hood was down and the cloack was open around the front. But it was August, in the middle of a heat wave in a bar where the cheap bartender refused to turn on the AC. To top it all off, there was not a single bead of sweat on the man.

“Where the hell did you come from?” I asked. I was genuinely perplexed this. I was sure there was no one I didn’t recognize a few moments ago. I surveyed the bar. The bartender was cursing at the television. The old man was head-jerking in his booth, trying to stay awake.

Neither of them paid this man any attention.

He ignored my question. “I overheard that you were a journalist.”

“Yeah, I mean, no. Not for much longer, I think.”

“That’s too bad.”

I stared at him, still processing the figure before me.

“I say, that’s too bad,” he repeated. “Because I got a story for you.”

“I’m sorry, but, I really not in the mood to listen to your story.” My mouth dried up all of sudden.

“That’s perfect. It’d be better if you read it.”

I downed my drink and ordered another, trying to get the bartender’s eyes on us. I had a bad feeling about this guy. He smelled, funny. Not like bad body order or like he was homeless or anything. Something funky, yet familiar and almost sweet.

The bartender came over and begrudgingly made the simplest cocktail a man could ask for. “If you want people to read your story start a blog-”

I stopped with my mouth agape. The man was gone. The bartender placed my drink in front of me with a raised eyebrow. He said nothing and walked to the far end to finish watching the talking heads.

In the man’s seat was a thick, grimy black journal with loose pages sticking out of the cover. “What the fuck?” I got up out of my seat and frantically looked for the man. He was nowhere to be found. “You saw him right? You couldn’t have missed that son of a bitch. He was this big!” I showed them with my hands. The bartender turned up the volume and the snores from the booth behind me told me enough.

I said I had to take a piss and excused myself, not that anyone was listening. He wasn’t there either. I drained my lizard anyhow and when I came back the journal was still there.

I suddenly didn’t feel like being there anymore. I needed to go back home. I slammed crumpled bills on the counter and rushed to leave, but before I could take a single step into the hot summer night air, I did a very foolish thing. I grabbed the journal. Then I went home.

I shouldn’t have done it. God I wish I hadn’t done it. I had picked up a den of terrible secrets better left unknown. Ignorance is bliss is what they say right? Maybe the truest statement ever uttered. To this day I wish I had been born as something else. A dog or a bird, even a fly. Anything but human.

But I did what I did. And before you ask. No, the journal is no longer in my possession. The reasons will become clear, but there *are* reasons. Good reasons. Like I said. There are forces afoot. And the second I took what didn’t belong to me, a gift or not, those forces saw me as if my very life was being watched behind a two-way mirror. They saw me. But I had yet to see them.

For now, I’ll finish by saying this. As I stumbled the short walk to my apartment I never once opened that journal. I was too busy being paranoid. Looking over my shoulder to see if I was being followed. I didn’t know why that should be so. I thought at any moment that man would appear again. He didn’t though. I got home safely. I fell into bed still garbed in my dirty, sweat-soaked clothes and then fell asleep. The last peaceful sleep, night or day, I would ever get.

I'll post again, soon...but I need to rest before I continue on.
