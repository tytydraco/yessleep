There’s a moment I asked myself to never forget.

I was five years old, standing in a quiet apartment not far from the school I would later attend. I don’t remember if we were moving in or moving out. The room was empty, quiet, and warm in that strange way afternoon light sometimes feels. A single bulb glowed above me, that older kind of filament light, soft and amber. Sunlight slipped through the blinds, striping the carpet with gold.

The closet was simple. Wide. Not too deep. A single shelf ran across the top. Off-white walls, a few paint chips, some shallow scuff marks on the inside. Just a closet. Nothing strange about it. But I remember standing there, looking in, and thinking something I’d never thought before.

"Remember this. Don’t forget this moment."

I said it in my head like a promise. Not because something scary had happened. Not because I was sad or excited. I just felt something... settle. Like the air paused for a second and everything inside me stopped rushing.

I stood still, staring at the empty space, and told myself to hold onto it. Forever.

That’s the part that’s always stayed with me. That a five-year-old version of me could somehow decide that this exact moment, this one quiet second in front of a nothing-special closet, needed to last a lifetime.

There were toys nearby. I think one of those old Starbright boards sat on the floor, where you plug in little lights to make glowing shapes. I also remember discovering an Etch-a-Sketch around that time, maybe in the same room or the one across the hall. I don’t remember if those memories came before or after. They just float near this one like soft little echoes. But the closet is the core. That’s the moment I chose to carry.

Back then, I had trouble speaking. I won’t go too far into that now. It wasn’t something I was fully aware of yet, but I could feel the weight of it sometimes. The way it made me quiet. The way it separated me from other kids. But none of that was in the room with me that day.

That day, there was no noise inside me. Just the light, the closet, the warmth, and the decision.

Sometimes I think about it and wonder why I remembered. Why that moment held.

And more than that, why I felt the need to remember it.

It was just a closet. Just a room.

But even now, after all these years, I can still feel the carpet under my feet, the way the light spilled across the floor, and the shape of the air in that quiet space.

Maybe some part of me knew I’d need to come back to it.

Not in person.

Just here.

In memory.

Sometimes I wonder what would’ve happened if I hadn’t told myself to remember.

What if I’d let that moment disappear, like all the others?

I think... maybe I wasn’t supposed to forget.

But I don’t think I was supposed to remember alone...
