Life turns into a bad dream when someone you love and have known your whole existence, does something you’d never understand or forgive.

Jason and I grew up together. My first memory is from that time at the park, when I fell over some shattered glass and kept on playing. Jason just like me, didn’t even spoke yet, saw me bleed and began to cry. They kept repeating to me that if it wasn’t for that, no one would have noticed, and I’ve could have caught tetanus.

It’s not for that particular episode, but for all those special moments that we shared till that day, that when Jason told me he was diagnosed with schizophrenia, to me nothing of what I thought about him changed. There was no one else in the world that could make me feel safer than Jason.

In that instant, he was so afraid that without thinking twice, I held for him the most secure space I could. I embraced him instinctively, so he could express his sorrow. I swore to never disclose his condition to anyone, unless he asked me to do so. Not even to my parents.

That was one year before the tragedy.

Everything unfolded mercilessly and without a warning.

It was the Autumn when most of the class had turned 17. We were getting ready for the finals just like 17-year-olds get ready for their exams: with a movie night. Mum was hosting. You’ll see, she had earned a reputation among my classmates. She didn’t do well around my dad – something that I understand later on why. But for us, she was a benefactor. A shinning idol among the rest of the lifeless, grey and boring adults.

Dad was away for work, and although she swore that she wouldn’t, she allowed me, Jason and a group of friends to rejoice in the opulence of a night in front of the screen. Such a hard joy to put in words. Even without my father around, having people over was unheard of. Especially at night. An absolute taboo. A rule engraved on steel, broken. For the first time, thanks to mum, I was exploring unknown and exhalating territories. My dad’s reign of terror was over. I was invincible.

We wanted to watch something at the same level of transgression that we were incurring in. We felt brave enough to watch one of the last horror ones on Netflix. We wanted blood, we wanted screams. We wanted to make sure that the one we manage to sit by our sides, cuddled us during the jump-scares. I chose Jason and I was feeling cozy.

A plate crashed against the floor in the kitchen. I heard my mum curse.

Some kids squeaked startled. She begged “I’m sorry” and mumbled some other things I didn’t quite get. Jason then looked at his right arm and spoke softly: “Hey, I need to pee”. “Haha, soz” I said, agreeing to let go of his arm. “That’s okay” I heard him say. “I’ll go check on my mum”, I finally said. His last word to me was: “Okay” as he walked away trying to not to step on the rest. He was calm and lovely as always, though I knew they had changed his prescription recently and he wasn’t having the best time. The adult in me wondered if a late night was the right thing for Jason to go through right now. I trusted his mum, though, who allowed him to come over in the first place.

I left the room struggling to get my eyes used to the light of the kitchen, where my mum was cleaning the mess that she made. “All good Cassy”, she said. “Almost done here”. I gave her a look from top to bottom. “Hey, it’s all good. Have a look by yourself”, she said shaking of her blouse and flashing me both sides of her hands. I smiled satisfied. “Alright, alright! Enough!”, I laughed at her spanking her jeans, showing all areas were safe.

The flushing noise from the toilet interrupted her performance. Her demeanor changed from casual and relax, to frightened and tense. “Are you okay? -It’s the toilet. Jason was there just then”, I explained in a chuckle. She placed a hand on her chest and sight after I said that. “Are you okay?”, I insisted, and she looked at me, snapping back to her casual self. “Jason, that’s it! Sorry, I’m a bit all over the place today. I’m fine, truly”. “Alright. Then… I’ll be back with the guys now”, I told her pointing towards the sounds of the movie. “Won’t--? Won’t you wait for Jason?”, she asked. “Nah. He always gets stuck in there fixing his fringe.” She smiled to the answer, though she didn’t laugh as I expected her to do. I blew her a kiss to break the awkward silence, which she mechanically returned. I went back to the dark, teenage-scented room blaming dad for whatever she was going through.

I found the movie to be on it lasts moments. I tried giving it my attention, but I had lost interest. I felt discouraged to reconnect with it, so I went into my phone instead. That’s when I saw that I had a couple of messages from Jason’s mum. She was asking if he was with me. Then, my phone began ringing in my hand with a call from her. I was thrown through a loop. From the kitchen I heard some commotion and hustling building up. “Mum?”, I stood up and called through the door. I was replied with a horrible squeal-like scream. Everyone in the room jumped in their spots and turned around frightened. Loud, desperate running steps were heard before Jason bolted though the frame tackling me all the way down to the floor. A second pair of sprinting steps stopped right before entering and then backtracked indecisively. I thought that I heard the typical sigh of my mum whenever she reaches her hands over her scalp.

Everyone in the room had cornered themselves to the closest wall with eyes wide open. I realized how soaked my blouse was and that Jason was sobbing through a mess of blood.

My mum’s steps finally brought her to us. She turned the lights on, pale as never before. She didn’t have her blouse on, and her hands were shaking. “--A-A man just came in and he-…”. She was barely able to speak. “H-he did *that* to Jason and--”. Jason tried to pull his face off my blouse, groaning in pain, leading to some cold air to cool my stomach, but quickly pressed himself back against me.

*He did that to Jason*, echoed in my head. I couldn’t get myself to take a look at him. My eyes were stuck on my mum. “I-I’m calling the police!”, she yelled in a very strange tone, almost theatrical. “Stay here, you all! Stay! Stay until they show up!”. And disappeared.

Some kids were trying to hold their phones in their shaking hands. We were sobbing quietly, enduring Jacob’s animalistic grunting.

Mum was lying. I know how she prepares herself, blowing air and grabbing her skull. *Jason is under new medication*, came to mind. *He did that to Jason*, the thought kept coming back. “What did you do?”, I ended up asking him in a whisper. Jason then stopped breathing for a second and began trembling. I thought he would snap at me. He pulled himself up, growling and turning towards the door, finger pointing beyond the frame once and again, accusatively. The face that I knew all my life was minced by cuts and punctions, and inspired screams of horror amongst us. I couldn’t take it anymore. I had to find mum and explain to her that Jason was psychotic. She wasn’t to blame, she needed to know, so I found myself searching for her around the house.

I was expecting to find her somewhere walking back and forth on the phone to the police, but I had to go back over my tracks when I saw her out of the corner of my eye, sitting in the kitchen. Her elbows on the table, her head between her hands. Still half naked, mumbling and gaging things quickly. On the table, there was a piece of the plate she broke earlier on. On the floor by my feet, her blouse. Both were stained with blood.

I heard someone collapsing behind me. That alerted my mum, who turned around to look at me, then at Jason’s unconscious body and then back at me. I couldn’t tell if it was safe for me to take my eyes off mum anymore.

“I thought it was a mask”, she said covering her mouth. “I thought he was someone else”.

I remembered when Jason went over about how sometimes he felt paranoid, and believed her mother was an impostor who wanted to kill him.

“You said that he was taking too long in front of the mirror”, she spoke again crying.

I just wanted dad to be back.
