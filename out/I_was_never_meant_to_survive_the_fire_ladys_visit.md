A few months ago, a little after I turned twelve, my brother and my parents died in a fire. I tried to tell the police what happened, but they didn’t believe me. We’d all been sitting in the living room, watching TV, when all four walls burst into flames all at once. I tried to run for the door, but the knob burned my hand. 

When I turned back to look for another way out, I saw a woman standing in the center of the room. She was taller than my dad and had a skintight dress made of blood-red feathers. She was leaning over my little brother, gently stroking his face until he fell asleep. Then she walked over and kissed my dad long and hard on the lips. 

The whole time, my mom just sat and watched, like she was about to doze of watching some old movie. I tried to shake her awake, and she seemed to stir for just a second. She put her arms around me, squeezing me tighter than she ever had before.

“It’s okay,” she whispered. “Just let it take you.”

As my mother spoke, the woman began to walk toward us, running her too-long, too-pointed tongue around her cherry-red lips.

I think I would have died with them, except a fireman came crashing in the door. 

The next thing I knew, I woke up in a hospital. I tried to tell the doctors and the cops my story, but they didn’t buy it. Gas leak, they said.

Our family wasn’t exactly happy, but it was better than where I am now. I’m down in a group home just outside the city limits. My social worker, Ms. Chan, told me it’s one of the good ones. Out in the country, fresh air, not much history of complaints. 

The couple running the place, the Browns, are decent enough people, just kind of old. The food is pretty bland, but they keep the place clean and make sure we get to school on time. The big problem is the other kids. From the moment I got here, they decided to make my life hell.

They call me ‘Blister’ because of my hand, which is still healing from the fire. And everywhere they go, they pretend they smell bacon. There are five other boys here, and they’re all pretty much assholes as far as I can tell, but the worst of them are Derek and his sidekick Miggy. 

Derek is only fourteen, but he’s already almost six feet tall, with long stringy hair that covered his dull eyes. He’s got to weigh three hundred pounds. The Browns had to buy him a new bed because the slats broke on his old one. Miggy was a string bean with knife scars all over his face and back. 

A few nights ago, he and Miggy pissed on all my stuff and stole my clothes when I went to take a shower. I stood in the bathroom crying until Mrs. Brown came to the door with some too-big loaner clothes and told me to get to bed.

When I woke up that night, the Lady was sitting at the foot of my bed, watching me sleep. My feet felt hot near where she sat, like I had a bottle down there full of scalding water.

“I was wondering when you’d get up,” she said. I looked around the room. All of the other boys were sleeping. “Nasty little creatures,” she added. “You should teach them a lesson.”

“Are you here to burn me?” I asked.

She laughed and shook her head.

“At first I wanted to,” she said. “But I need you for something else. You’re a good boy, I can tell. Trustworthy. I need you to take care of something very important for me.”

She opened her hand, uncurling her long slender fingers to reveal a round white stone.

“I think you’re going to have a lot of fun together,” she said, dropping the stone on the bed. “Do take good care of it, or I won’t be needing you anymore, which would *not* be good for you!”

She blew me a little kiss.

“Have fun!” she said.

The next thing I knew, I woke up with the stone in my hand. It was hot, so hot I couldn’t hold it for more than a few seconds. I dressed in the loose jeans I’d borrowed and shoved it in the pocket.

That day, the Browns put us to work cutting firewood for winter. Everything was fine at first, until Mr. Brown headed inside to take a leak. Then Derek told Miggy to hold my arm down on a stump and loomed over me with the axe.

“What if I just cut your hand off and called it an accident? Who’d believe you?” he asked. He leaned down and smiled wide at me. His breath made me want to throw up.

He raised the axe. I think he might have really done it if his hair hadn’t burst into flame. It happened all at once. One second, he was smiling, ready to swing the axe. Then bam. Head on fire. His oily hair crackled and hissed in the cool autumn air. 

No one quite knew what to do. Derek rolled on the ground, screaming, but the first just wouldn’t seem to go out. As he shouted, the rock in my pocket felt warmer than before, almost so hot that I had to take it out. 

Eventually, Mr. Brown came running with a bucket of water and put the fire out.

After that, the other kids kind of looked at me funny, like maybe I’d somehow caused the fire, even though that was impossible. Derek had to go to the doctor and didn’t come back.

I thought maybe after that they’d leave me alone, but boy was I wrong.

I woke up that night to find all the rest of the kids standing over my bad. They all had sheets balled up at the ends and soaked with water. I woke as Miggy swung his at full force, knocking the wind out of me. 

“Wake up!” he shouted. “You’re gonna pay for what you did to Derek.”

“I didn’t…” I tried to say, but another blow collided with my stomach. 

My hand scrambled for the stone, which I’d tucked under my pillow, but I couldn’t find it. 

“Looking for this?” asked Miggy, holding up the stone. “Saw you messing with it all day.”

Another blow landed. My vision went blurry.

“I think I’ll keep it,” said Miggy. “To remember you by.” He looked at the stone in his open hand, and a puzzled expression crossed his face.

Then, the stone turned bright as the sun, and Miggy’s screams filled the air. As the superhot stone melted right through his hand and fell on the bed next to me. Miggy stood screaming, looking right through the empty space in his palm.

Somehow, the stone didn’t even singe the sheets. I picked it up and looked at the other boys, who were backing away from me now.

“Kill him,” Miggy was shouting through his tears. “Kill him!”

A couple took a step toward me. Then, suddenly, they were all on fire. Each of them burning in isolation like candles on a birthday cake. They screamed for a few seconds and then fell, blackening on the ground.

I quickly put on my shoes as the flames began to spread around the room. 

By the time I got out of the house, the whole thing was lit up pretty good. I hope the Browns got out, but they had a reputation for sleeping through almost anything.

I’m on the road now, with nothing but my backpack and the clothes on my back. And the stone of course. Holding it up in the cool night air, I see something inside of it now. It looks like a tiny red chick, all aglow, and clawing to get out. 

And it’s only as it begins to crack that I realize that it’s not a rock at all, but an egg. The thing is coming out, crying for food, crying to burn.

And I know that I must feed it.
