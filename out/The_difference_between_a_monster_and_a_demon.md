Sometimes I just can’t help myself. I’m a retired man, but sometimes you just know that you’re the only one who can get the job done right.

I was walking alone in the park at around 9 in the morning. I was listening to the birds, admiring the dense trees, and shaking the dust off these old bones. When along the path I see a cute little play castle. A fine place for youngsters to burn off some energy. Oh what I’d do to be young and spry again, I was so nimble and dexterous in golden years. Now-a-days I can barely use a butcher’s knife on a~ dag-nab-it! I was rambling on again, so sorry. Where was I? 

Ah yes, the play castle! So as I was walking, I take a detour on my route to inspect the castle. It was made thin metal sheets. Built in last in the sun, but gets dreadfully sharp when given enough force. Some good kid could get hurt if they ain’t careful. Anyway, as I’m looking at the outside of the castle, I hear a young boy from within yell “whoa gross!” Needless to say it startled me half to death! I looked inside and sure enough, I saw a little boy no more than 10. 

He was hunched over, looking at a bug or something, I couldn’t quite see at the moment. I say “what are you doing in here boy, giving a poor old man a heart attack!” The boy straightens up and stands towards me with his hands behind his back. Like he was hiding something. These eye may be foggy, but they’re still keen as ever. “What are you hiding there boy?” I said. Red faced, he sheepishly showed me what he had. 

And this really broke my heart, the boy showed me a poor little butterfly fly with its wings ripped off. I know boys will be boys, but this was unacceptable. I felt the need to make an example of this. 

I ask “Did you do this?” He nods. I say “What did that butterfly do to you?!” “Nothing sir.” He stammered. “Now son, do you know the difference between a monster and a demon?” He shakes his head. I grab his arm and say “A monster is a beast that would rip the wings off a butterfly, for fun.” I then grab his other arm and pull him in close. “And a demon is a beast that would rip the wings off a monster, for fun!” 

The boy blew out my hearing aid with his screaming, lucky for me sound doesn’t travel well with all the trees around. And not many people go through this park this early. It was a messy job, on the fact that I had to use the castle walls as a clever. But like I said before, I get the job done.

After a few days, the local news finally got around to covering it. They found the boys arms two miles away from the body. I would have carried them farther if my own didn’t get so tired. And I made sure he still had those butterfly wings in each hand. 

Like I said, I had to set an example.
