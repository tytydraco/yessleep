Hello all, I have more information about the situation again. Thank you for the support.





I sat frozen in shock for several minutes.

After the video cut off, bile rose in the back of my throat. I bolted to the bathroom and barely made it to the toilet in time.

Was what I saw real? Or just some elaborate Halloween prank?

Even if it *wasn't* real, why was I—someone presumed to be *me*—being carried by a man, surrounded by chanting people?

If that was actual snuff footage, why would anyone film it? And an even bigger question—**who were these people?** A new-age version of the Raven’s Gate?

Why would my dad keep something like this? Wouldn’t that be incriminating if someone found it?

Then again... who sits around watching someone else’s old home videos?

I had so many questions.

My thoughts circled back to the strange question the man at Walmart asked me:

“Have you heard of the Windmill People?”

Could that be it? A satanic cult that kills pregnant women?

I didn’t know my dad well. I couldn’t tell you his favorite color, hobbies, or anything about him outside of sports and drinking. But one thing I *did* know for sure?

**I need to find out if my dad was a murderer.**

But where the hell do I even start?





I figured I’d try the other missing-in-action parent in my life. I found my mom’s contact and hit call. It rang three times before she picked up.

“Hello?”

“Hi, Mom. I wanted to ask you a few questions… about a tape I found in Dad’s stuff.”

There was a long pause.

“What tape?”

“The one labeled *Home Videos,*” I said, casually.

Silence. I thought the call dropped—until she finally responded.

“We never had a video camera when you were a kid.”

“I thought that too. But… I saw your wedding. And then I saw some really weird cult—"

“Maybe one of your dad’s relatives taped over a movie with our wedding. Listen, I have to go. Have a good day.”

*Click.*





Well... now what?

I thought about that question again—*Windmill People*—and whether my dad was involved.

I dug back through the boxes scattered on my floor, searching for the old MacBook Johnny gave me. He’d spent most of his money on a gaming computer instead of covering rent that month. Eventually paid me back—but I told him he’d be dead if he ever pulled that again.

The laptop, of course, was dead. I plugged it in and paced my room, watching the battery charge like it was my lifeline.

When it finally powered on, I typed in the only lead I had: **Windmill People.**

Nothing.

Just a few indie horror games and an article about old Southern Britain traditions.

Figures.

There was only one place left that might hold real answers—the town library.





It sat on the edge of Willington like a forgotten relic. Ten miles away. Big Victorian architecture. Peeling paint. Empty parking lot. From the outside, it looked abandoned.

Inside, it was full of old files, dusty books, and glass display cases housing rusted tools and black-and-white portraits of *important men* no one remembered.

The librarian pointed me to the local history section.

I combed through book after book until my eyes went blurry.

And then—I found something.

A newspaper article from 1878:

**“Local Cult Suspected of Kidnapping 7 Women.”**

Only a few paragraphs long. But it mentioned people in purple robes and plague doctor masks being spotted in an abandoned lumber yard.

The same lumber yard.

That would explain the woman in the video.

I shuddered.





That night, I barely slept.

My mind kept asking the same questions. *Did my dad have a double life? Did Mom know?*

Her reaction earlier... she was hiding something.

I decided to call her the next morning, on my way to work.

No answer.

I called again. Still nothing.

That wasn’t like her. She always answered by the third ring, even if she barely said anything.

All day at work, anxiety clawed at me.





Around 8:00 p.m., I saw someone familiar in the store.

**Terrence.**

He was holding potato chips... and two cartons of milk?

I didn’t hesitate.

“Terrence,” I said.

“Hi Evan. How’s the car?”

“Still running. Thanks again,” I said, forcing a smile. “Listen—can we talk? I had some questions. About the Windmill People.”

His expression shifted.

“Sorry, who? Never heard of them.”

Liar.

“Anyway,” he continued, “I was actually looking for help on my farm. And for some reason, you came to mind.”

I wasn’t about to turn down extra cash. He handed me his number and walked off.

Then my phone buzzed.

A message.

**“Meet me behind the Walmart after your shift.”**





At 11:00 p.m., I slipped out the back and found Terrence waiting in his car. He gestured for me to get in. I did.

He looked... serious.

“So, you want to know about the infamous Willington cult?”

I nodded.

He explained: in the 1980s, the cult lived off the grid. Suspected of kidnappings. Panic swept the town. But no one was ever charged—no IDs, no proof. Eventually, the story faded.

“Did they ever find the missing women?” I asked, voice barely audible.

He leaned closer.

“What do you think happened to them?”

Then, he paused.

“I have a theory. No proof, but... there was a fire at the lumber yard. I think that’s where their ceremonies took place.”

“Ceremonies?” I echoed, fearing the answer.

“Yeah. The legend was... they impregnated women and killed them as part of some ritual. But no one knows for sure.”

My stomach dropped. That tape—everything lined up.

Then he asked:

“Was your dad Charles Perez?”

My blood froze.

“Yes. Why?”

“I knew Charles. We were friends in grade school. Drifted apart.

Years later, I saw him again.”

“Where?”

“I saw him kidnapping my wife.”





I couldn’t breathe.

**Who the fuck was the man I called my dad?**

I stumbled out of the car, slammed the door, and rushed home.

That night, panic swallowed me whole. I had a full-blown attack before I could even get into bed.

When I finally crawled under the sheets, my head pounding, I did the one thing I swore I’d never do.

I opened Johnny’s vodka and took a swig.

The very thing that destroyed my family… I reached for it like it was comfort.

I wish I hadn’t. Because ever since that night—I haven’t had one moment of sober clarity.





Svedka became my vice.

The thing that kept the nightmares and memories away.

I started missing work. Showing up late. Got multiple warnings.

Johnny tried to intervene. I didn’t listen.

We stopped talking.

We’d come home, go to our rooms, and pretend we weren’t roommates. Just strangers sharing rent.





One night, I came home to a note on my pillow.

I assumed it was from Johnny—rehab stuff, probably. He’d left notes before with phone numbers for AA or clinics.

But this one just said:

**“Go to the lumber yard. You know the one.”**

Fear surged through me.

Who put this here?

Johnny wasn’t working today. And no one gets into our building without a key or resident buzz-in.

An old cult member? A threat? A test?

I tried to forget it. I drank more. But it lingered.

Hours passed.

Eventually, I made my decision.

I needed to know who my father *really* was.





I thought about the pistol I kept in my safe. It was my dad’s—the only thing of his I still owned.

When I was six, he took me shooting. Too young, probably.

But it was the only memory I had of him where I felt like his son.

That memory... and that gun.





I ordered an Uber.

I drank a bit more before leaving. The buzz numbed the paranoia.

The gun was tucked into my waistband.

When I arrived, the lumber yard was pitch black.

I used my phone flashlight to cut through the dark.

“Hello?”

No answer.

Then—the smell hit me.

Sour. Burning. It stung my eyes. I gagged.

I moved deeper in.

Charred wood littered the ground. Ashes, bark, scorched debris. I had to watch my step.

The stench got worse.

My eyes watered. My stomach flipped.

Where was the person who left the note?

I expected to be attacked. Dragged into the shadows by someone in a purple robe.

But instead, I saw it.





On a pile of burned tree stumps...

**My mother.**

A bullet hole clean through the center of her forehead.

She was the one person I could’ve gotten answers from.

And I never got to say goodbye.
