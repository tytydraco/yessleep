I woke up from a horrible dream of my father making my splitting headache worse when I bonked my head off the car roof, looking around at first forgetting my surroundings before I remembered where I was…where I always was. I was passed out in the back of my dark gray hatchback as the heavy rain beat down on a cool autumn night in Seattle, well I suppose I was always in the car these days but as for Seattle I’d been hiding out here after things went south is Orlando, anyways I looked around for something to eat pushing aside the wrappers and beer cans seeing nothing…well that wasn’t great…guess I had to go buy something. So I rolled over from the makeshift bed I had made I grabbed my wallet that I had lazily thrown aside in the passenger seat after I had finished last night with my hobby, looking inside it I realized I only have about twenty two dollars and a couple cents left, guess I would have to hit up a local convenience store for cash I mean it’s not like I could hold down a job anyways, anyways I finally climbed out of the bed being careful not to hit my head a second time and drove over to some local place I forget the name…something burger I think, anyways I drove over there trying not to skid off the road with how much rain there was until I eventually pulled up in the parking lot.

I examined what clothes I had deciding to just go with my go to look of my old gray hoodie and gray cargo pants as I rushed into the fast food place my stomach gurgling with pain, I pushed open the doors of the place being bombarded with bright white light from the cheap bulbs as I made my way over to the cashier and ordered some cheap slop from the menu, after that I lazily walked over to one of the tables trying to shake off my half-awake funk. That's when the itching started, as usual it started slow with a soft sensation in the back of my neck that almost felt like scratching from under my skin that would slowly build in intensity, this is how I knew I needed to begin another hunt…I perused the restaurant looking for who the next target would be…the choices were pretty bare I remember how I dismissed the cashier thinking it would be to easily with the boy having a similar body shape to a stick bug, I also remember dismissing the large man who had lazily thrown on a wool coat over his old white t shirt…I decided he probably would have a gun and that would make things to complicated.

Then I saw…her, I mean she was perfect just what I was looking for between her red wool jacket and dress to her short bob cut blonde hair and blue eyes…she was perfect looked like a girl who had never missed a day of class in her life like she actually enjoyed visiting the library she must have cause it was four in the morning and she was at some run down burger joint studying an English textbook, I mean what a sweet little lamb. Anyways I decided she was perfect so I headed back to my car and waited…followed her around for a bit the little lamb didn’t even notice as I trailed her back to her house then to the college she went to confirming my suspicions of her age, I mean she looked about a decade younger than me but I couldn’t tell for sure until she bounced out of her car and into that large brick building. Finally I followed as she drove to her house with her boyfriend… the boy was built like a rhino but looked like he had an IQ level lower than a grape, anyways the time had finally come as I prepared myself getting out of my car parked across the street as I watched through the living room window as she got up from the couch her sleeping boyfriend next to her and went over to get something from the kitchen, now was my moment.

I grabbed my things starting off with some gloves before packing my real tools, my old hunting knife my dad had given me…man that thing had been through so much use, anyways I also grabbed my mask a larger metal thing molded to look like a man's face, the thing was made of a reflective metal so all my prey could see in their final moments was their own scared faces. Oh I loved doing these outings it was the best part of my life as I sprinted across the streets before slowing as I reached the from door, I checked and as expected the fools didn’t lock it, so I specifically left it open to give the little lamb a spook as I climbed up the steps to the second floor looking over the small hallway with two doors exploring a bit. I checked the door on the right and my heart skipped a beat as I saw a small boy with blonde hair and blue eyes sleeping peacefully in bed…and I was thinking, little lamb? There's no way she would have a kid this early. I mean look at her…must have been a little brother, either way he would complicate things, so I grabbed a chair from his room and blocked the door to his room with it to keep him in there while I worked.

I then crept into the other room discovering it was her bedroom as I heard her gasp downstairs as little lamb rushed up seeing the chair, oh the sweet girl must have seen the open door and came to check on her brother…well anyways I could finally have some fun as I burst from her room her letting a short shriek as I grabbed her by her sweater and dragged her throwing her to the ground in her bedroom right in the space between her bed and closet with me raising the blade to finally see some red before something struck me, I fell to the ground cursing to see who but lug head standing over me with a broken bottle, my rage flared as I plunged the blade into his foot quickly dashing to cut his throat, so much for that hero. I continued as I heard her shuffling in the closet…of course the little lamb must have been scared and hid, so I threw open the doors slashing as her as soon as I got a glimpse with her ducking my first slash but then I overpowered her choking her against the wall as I slid my blade down her cheek, then I finally got to see some red leaving a large gash on her face.

Anyways that was the last thing I saw before the glint of a golf club filled my vision as she swung it upwards sending me ricocheting off of the bed…I thought about my father his same words he used when he first taught me how to gut somebody echoing in my head…sloppy work Vic, but then I saw her, and my grin returned. As she looked down as me her face bleeding, I saw something I left her that was much more permanent than the scar…her eyes were empty and hollow instead of the joy I had first scene in the burger place, that's when I smiled and knew she would never be the same before I passed out”.

This ends the confession of Victor Rivers who is still as of 2023 serving a life sentence for the murder of 26 people. Her final victim Gloria Adams went missing three years after this incident.
