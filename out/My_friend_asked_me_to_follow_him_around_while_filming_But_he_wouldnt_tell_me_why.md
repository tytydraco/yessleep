Last week, my friend Jaime asked me to follow him around while filming him.

Pretty bizarre request, right? I certainly thought so. I asked him what he wanted it for and he told me some university project. So I guess the title of this post is a bit misleading. He did give me a reason. I just don’t believe it.

Because I go to the same school as him. We both study finance. I know what his schedule’s like and there’s no chance that one of his courses had him doing something like that.

He then clarified that it wasn’t for a course. But for a club he’d joined a few weeks ago. I asked him which club. He told me it was the “filmmaking club.”

I’d never heard of that club before and I’d never seen it advertised anywhere around campus. Though I’d figured it did seem like the kind of thing that he might be into. He has a small YouTube channel where he goes around and films himself exploring creepy abandoned buildings. He says that it gives him the same kind of adrenaline he used to get from boxing, before the concussions started piling up and he couldn’t compete anymore. That it was a good replacement.

But even with the additional context, I just couldn’t find it in myself to believe what he was telling me. It’s not that I had any reason to want to doubt him. It was more so that he didn’t seem all too convinced of it himself. You ever get that feeling? When somebody’s trying to sell you on a story but their tone’s all weird and they’re rushing and stumbling through their words? That’s the vibe I was getting from him.

But I just told myself that it wasn’t a big deal. I’d just be a good friend and go along with it. He probably had his reasons for keeping the true purpose of it under wraps and I wasn’t the kind of guy to pry.

So I told him I’d help him out. I then asked how long he wanted me to follow him around for. He told me an entire day. Morning to night.

At that point, I’d been under the assumption that he just needed me for a few hours. But an entire day? I had shit to do. But I guess he could sense my apprehension so he offered to pay for drinks and the uber the next time we were out.

Which I accepted. Realistically, I wasn’t going to get anything done that day anyways.

He told to wait outside of his dorm building the next morning around ten. He then handed me a small black device about the size of my thumb.

“Body camera,” he’d explained. “Wear a jacket and then clip it on near the center of your chest. Don’t follow too close.”

He then gave me a brief rundown of his plans that day. He’d leave his dorm in the morning before walking all the way downtown and then over to a public park on the other side of the city before going back downtown and then back to the uni.

I asked him if he was joking. He looked me dead in the eyes and told me he wasn’t. That the project was a “candid” sort of thing. Whatever the hell that meant. He then tacked on another strange request. He said that he wanted me to capture a “three-sixty” view of things. In other words, he didn’t want me to be facing ahead the entire time. He wanted footage of all directions, all angles. But I didn’t have to linger in any particular direction. Just a slow, passing shot was alright.

So basically Jaime was asking me strap on a bodycam and trail him at a distance for 8-10 hours while intermittently twirling around in a circle.

I can’t say that it sounded like a particularly good time. But as a painfully broke student, the prospect of getting shitfaced for free was enticing enough. So I went ahead with it.

That morning I woke up and walked over to his dorm. I waited around near the edge of the parking lot until I saw him come out of the front entrance at around five past ten. Then I waited a bit longer before I started following him.

I’d like to tell you that I noticed anything strange that day. But that just wouldn’t be true. Because nothing happened. It was just really boring and by the end it, I was freezing and my legs were cooked. Of course I still did my best to do what he’d asked, even if I’d felt a fucking weirdo every time I’d stop in the middle of a sidewalk and slowly rotate around.

At around 9 PM, he’d simply headed back to his dorm, disappeared inside. Shortly after, I’d received a text from him telling me to send over the footage whenever I had the chance. Which I did once I was back in my room. He thanked me, told me to meet him at the nearby Iris pub after classes the next day.

Of course the entire thing had left me with more than a few questions. But I also wasn’t really dying for any answers. I was too tired to really think about it. So I just went to bed.

After classes that next day, I headed over to the pub. Five o clock, he’d told me. I waited until around six. He never showed. Wasn’t answering his phone either.

I thought it was a dick move but figured he could make it up to me some other time. So I just let it go for the moment, headed back home.

It’s been five days since then and I haven’t seen or heard from him. His phone’s radio silent, he hasn’t posted on Instagram, he hasn’t been coming to classes, he isn’t in his dorm. Or if he is in there, he’s doing his damn best to hide.

I’ve gone and asked the people on his floor whether they’d seen him recently. They all told me that they haven’t. That they’re worried about him. It seems like the last time anybody’s seen him at all was the morning after the day I’d filmed him.

I’ve also heard through the grapevine that his floor’s RA has contacted Jaime’s parents, told them it might be a good idea to file a missing person’s report because nobody has a fucking clue where he is or where he could be.

Which means that within the next few days I’m gonna have to talk to some cops. I mean surely, right? I spent an entire day with somebody right before they went missing. Hell, I’m probably being actively investigated as a suspect.

Right now, there’s a question that I can’t stop asking myself.

Was it a coincidence? That he went missing the day after I’d filmed him? I suppose it’s possible. At least statistically speaking. But the circumstances just seem too bizarre for me to believe it.

It’s been gnawing at me in a way that I really don’t like. A way that evokes this primal sense of dread. As if I’ve inadvertently become involved in something that I really don’t want to be involved in.

Better to look for answers before I’m blindsided by an outcome I’m unprepared for.

And I think combing through that footage might be a good place to start.
