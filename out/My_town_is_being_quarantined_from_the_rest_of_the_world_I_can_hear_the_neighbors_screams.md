I could hear the screams from the neighbor’s house as I sat on my roof in surveillance. I scoffed at their incompetence, as their stupidity caused the horde outside to get hungrier and more desperate to get inside. Hundreds of bodies were surrounding their home, smashing into the walls and piling over each other. I knew I had to do something. I had to get in that house, even though the likelihood of my survival wasn’t high.

Our town has been on lockdown for months now. To the best of my knowledge, they have actually kept this outbreak contained. Then again, there’s no confirmation what we were experiencing was an outbreak of some viral disease. But when the dead begin to walk and feast on their loved ones, it’s sort of a natural conclusion. The only thing I knew for sure is that we weren’t getting any help anytime soon, so I had to take things into my own hands.

I made sure I had my machete with me, and wielded my shotgun. Certainly not an ideal loadout for a horde, but it was better than nothing. After working myself up, I made the leap from my roof to theirs. I landed halfway on, but began to slip off the edge of the roof. Snarling monsters clawed up at me from the lawn, reaching for my dangling feet. With a bit of struggle, I managed to pull myself back onto the roof.

“Glad the pull ups are paying off,” I muttered to myself, catching my breath.

I scouted the scene, making note that the family inside was no longer making noise. So either they realized their mistake too late, or… they were already being eaten. I prayed that wasn’t the case. I pulled out a flare gun from my backpack and fired it into a house across the street. This drew a good amount of the horde in that direction.

As they scattered, the majority of them were curious about the house which had begun to catch flames. I leapt down the chimney, praying it wasn’t blocked off. I was in luck. However, as I crawled out and into the living room, I was met with a room full of the undead.

At least five of them were meandering about the room, with seemingly more piling into the hallway. One of them turned its gaze towards me. I quickly cut it down with my machete, before turning towards several others who were still distracted. I raised my shotgun to try and take them out quickly. But right as I fired, something yanked my ankle causing me to fall and completely miss. My head whipped back, smacking into the fireplace I had exited out of. 

Dazed, I noticed the legless zombie who had tripped me nearing my ankle with its hungry mouth agape. I kicked at it hard, reaching for my machete, and bringing it down into the creature’s skull. However, when I tried to pull it out, I realized it was stuck. The remaining three undead in the room were mere feet away, and the shotgun was just out of reach. I quickly pulled the corpse of the legless one on top of me, blocking myself off as two of them fell on top of me.

I managed to roll out as they got caught on their fallen brother, allowing me to quickly retrieve my shotgun. With two shots, they were now dead. Well, I mean… actually dead. I sighed in relief, before making my way towards the hallway. It appeared to be empty, with one room noticeably clawed on and worn down. The family had to be in there, and it appeared they had been able to keep quiet. I reached for the handle, when I was suddenly attacked by another of the dead.

I managed to block its mouth with my shotgun, but this one was much bigger than me, and its size caused me to be pushed back towards the open window at the end of the hall. I struggled, realizing that even if I survived this fall, some of the dead were certainly still patrolling the outside of the house. I pushed hard against the beast, before dropping to my knees and tossing it over my shoulders in a sort of fireman’s carry throw, sending it out the window.

“Man… I’ve never seen one that big…,” I exclaimed, barely able to get to my feet.

That’s when the worn down door in the hallway swung open, and an older looking man came out to me. He helped me up, and began to drag me into the room. “Quickly… I’m sure more will be coming up soon,” he said as we made our way down the hall. We entered the room, and the man blocked off the door with some large furniture. It wasn’t super secure, but they clearly weren’t the brightest bunch.

I surveyed the room. One older man, a middle-aged woman, and their two children. I stood up slowly and blocked off the door as I began to laugh, gripping my machete tightly. I could see the realization wash across their faces all too late. This trip was worth it after all. I’d be eating well for the couple of weeks.
