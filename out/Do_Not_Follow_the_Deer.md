I’ll never forget that hunting trip. I was part of a small guided hunt deep in the woods, just me, a couple of friends, and the guide. The forest was quiet, the kind of silence that feels heavy and alive all at once. We had been tracking deer all afternoon, and as the sun began to dip behind the trees, one of the hunters ahead of me froze.

“Guys… there’s a buck up ahead,” he whispered, voice almost reverent. “You have to see it. It’s… enormous. Just a little further.”

At first, we laughed. It was dusk, the shadows stretching long, and the woods always make things seem bigger than they are. But there was something in the way he said it — a calm insistence, like he wasn’t entirely in control of himself. His eyes were fixed forward, unblinking, and his voice had that strange, hypnotic quality, the kind that makes you pause without realizing it.

Our guide shook his head. “It’s getting dark. We need to head back and set up camp,” he said firmly. “Nothing’s there.”

But the hunter didn’t seem to hear. He waved for us to follow, urging us toward something I couldn’t see. “It’s beautiful. You have to see it. Just a little further!”

I started to feel uneasy. There was something off about him — not like he was joking or excited, but as if he were in a trance, drawn forward by some force we couldn’t comprehend. The guide tried reasoning with him, telling him to stop, that there was nothing, but the hunter just kept insisting. He tried to make the rest of us look, almost forcing our heads toward the direction he was staring.

The sun slipped below the horizon, and the forest grew darker, shadows pooling between the trees. Our guide finally called it a day and began setting up camp, but the hunter didn’t stop. He kept walking forward, into the deeper woods, calling for us to follow.

By the time night fully fell, he was gone. The guide later said he smelled something foul outside his tent — the stench of rot, of death. I couldn’t sleep that night, imagining him wandering through the black forest, drawn forward by whatever had him.

We searched the next morning, combed the area, but there was no sign of him. Not a footprint, not a branch broken, nothing. He simply vanished.

I’ve heard all the usual explanations since — hypothermia, disorientation, maybe he fell or was attacked by wildlife. But I’ve also heard the local legends about the “Not-Deer,” a creature that lures people deep into the woods. It looks like a deer at first, normal and peaceful, but its movements are… wrong. Its gaze is too intelligent, its call eerily human. Hunters whisper that if you follow it, it can make you forget yourself, draw you off the safe paths, and you may never come back.

I don’t know what he saw that night. All I know is that the forest is full of things we can’t always explain, and sometimes curiosity can be deadly.

If you ever hear a deer calling in the woods — one that sounds almost human — or see one moving in ways that feel wrong, don’t look too long. Don’t call out. And whatever you do, don’t follow it.

Because the Not-Deer is always watching, and it waits for the next person foolish enough to be lured too far.
