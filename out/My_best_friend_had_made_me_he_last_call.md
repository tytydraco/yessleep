It started with a simple call.

“Hey, you up?”

I had been laying in bed doom scrolling until I could fall asleep. The last person I expected to call me was my best friend.

“What's up?”

I sent that Expecting just him being unable to sleep and needing someone to shoot the shit until he could. I wish it was that.

“I need someone to just talk to. I knew you would most likely be up.” 

“Yeah sure what's on your mind?”

I sat there expecting just a simple problem like, “oh me and my girlfriend just had a fight. I need to make sure i am in the right.” For they would constantly argue. Sometimes i would even get calls or msg from his girlfriend saying Don't help him.

“Jessica broke up with me. I'm also worried my son isn't my son from things she has said.”

I sat there baffled at the statements made. He had sounded as if his world was coming to an end. 

“Oh shit Frank what happened.” 

“We had gotten into it like we usually do. You know some shit she said about me not caring about him. I had just gotten back from work and had no time to rest. It had pissed me off. So i started yelling and she started yelling. The baby was crying because of it. It just kept escalating More and more until she had said John would be a better father an-”

“Woah woah what the fuck does that mean. He is your son. You care about him with your life and she is saying her ex would care about him more?”

“Yeah… I wish I could have said I stayed calm Or cool down but I didn't. I had asked what she meant. She told me it means what it means and that he is probably the real father anyway cause she was screwing me and him at the same time. There was more then that but i don't want to say it.”

“It's okay man I'm not expecting you to fully give me everything. Just…. Holy shit”

“Yeah.”

We had sat there in silence for a minute. I had process everything he told me. Process what he must be going through. I had blattered out a question that should have stayed in my head.

“Are you gonna get him tested?”

I heard the hesitation In his voice first before he said anything.

“I know I should but I don't want to find out he is his. That is the last thing I want to know. I don't know what I would do.”

He was on the verge of tears. 

“Hey, man come over let's just hang out and talk.”

“NO”

He had shouted with a sense of fear in his voice.

“I can't let you see me like this.”

“Dude I had seen you in an adult diaper passed out drunk. I think I can handle this.”

He had passed for a moment

“I don't want to pass out while driving or crash.”

“I can pick you up man, I don't mind. You need a break.”

I heard him do an audible gulp.

“Zach… I'm not going to make It pass tonight. I have nothing left.”

I sat there stunned by his comment. I answered back with a little fear.

“Frank, you got me. You have all your friends. You have something.”

“No… Jessica and the baby were the only things I had left…. I'm sorry, maybe I shouldn't have called. I'm gonna go bye.”

“WAIT FRANK WE CAN-”

I couldn't finish what I was gonna say before he hung up. I dialed 911 and told them everything. They rushed over there to find him already dead. He had been dead for over an hour.

“I need to ask you. How did you know he was going to or well did kill himself?” 

I sat for a minute trying to understand what he was saying. 

“As I said , I had been on a call with him. He made it seem like he was.” 

The officer sat there puzzled.

“Are you sure?”

I answered back with anger.

“Yes, I would know if I was on the phone with my best friend.”

“Well that's the problem, his phone wasn't in his apartment and when you said the time the call took place. He was already dead for over thirty minutes.” 

I had been thrown back by that comment.

“Are you sure you were on the phone with him?”

“Yeah, yeah i can show you on phone.” 

I had handed the officer my phone. As he was searching through it all that went through my head was there was no way it wasn't him.

“There's no call log for time you said”

“WHAT” 

I snapped the phone out of his hand. I looked to see on my phone there was no call recorded on my phone for him. 

“I don't know, I swear I was on a call with him. I wouldn't lie about that.”

“Listen you are in distress go back inside your house and get some rest. We'll come and talk with you tomorrow.” 

“Okay then” 

I had begun to close the door. I think he had said one more thing but I couldn't remember what. I just went straight to my room and sat on my bed.

How could he have called me if he was already dead? How come the call doesn't pop up on phone? None of it made sense

Before i could fully focus and think on those questions my phone started buzzing. I picked it up to see who it was.

It was Frank
