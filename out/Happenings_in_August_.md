It was first day in august when I left my hometown and moved to love with my father in different state. Everything was planned before the beginning of summer holidays, I'm staying here for whole two months and will help him im work 'till noon, then I had free time. I waited for him to come home, usually he came before I went to sleep, only once I recall happened he came late in night. Two weeks passed, I believe for I don't remember the exact time when the first thing happened, and everything seemed alright. Then it started, what was the beggining or how it followed I cannot tell, I only know these were the things. I went to ride my motorcycle when it fell as I was trying to moved it, that never happened to me and I believed it would never happen, that was before I stopped going for ride. My father crashed his car. Two colleagues from my work stole car and crashed it as well, why? No one knows. Another collegue was wanted by police for an unknown reason. Another fell from bycicle and hurt his shoulder, another one was stung by wasp and ended up in hospital for he was allergic. Grill exploded in the job and hurt my hand. 

It got to a point were I started thinking that this place holds some strange aura. It was true that I couldn't fall asleep and the sleep was restless, maybe I wasn't use to getting up early for work, but even if I fell asleep after noon it didn't help. One night another thing happened. I was woken up by loud bang, although my sleep was restless I slept well and all night. This bang must have been really loud when it woke me and after it lighting followed and it was the last one. There was no storm or it immediately ended, otherwise I cannot explain that light that flashed. After that loud noise I heard someone walking down the stairs then it stopped but no door were open.

I was in the city only once for a walk, simply because so much have changed. The streets I remembered and loved as young kid, had changed. Most of them were now prohibited from entering. Another thing I don't understand. All the narrow streets and stairs leading somewhere were now forbidden, some with signs entering at your own risk. Like what would happen, will someone shoot me? I crossed one barricade on old stairs and walked down them. They were like before, nothing changed, only there was more uncut grass on sides. 

Month passed and in June I agreed with my friend he will come visit me. In a month none of us have written a word. It was night I woke up from strange dream. My mind started working with horrors that now as I lay on my side a dead woman will hug me, with her wet hand over me and the problem won't be the fear but that she won't dissapear and will hold me, I will turn to her and there will be those wide opened eyes and mouth even wider not screaming just looking at me with dead eyes. And she won't dissapear, what will I do when she won't dissapear. Then I have thought of man in he corner of my room either just standing or kneeling and he won't dissapear either. I turn on the light and it won't work. I turned on my back and sit, the room was empty. I decied I'll write my friend. 

I wrote him that it will be better if he won't come. I wrote him I don't believe in supernatural and am no mystic or anything but there's too much weird coincidences malevolent only, and I don't won't anything to happen to him. He wrote me after ten minutes. "I'm sorry for that, but we have come for you."
I was ready to reply what does that mean, when knocking on the door started. Sweat ran down me. My father had keys. I wrote him and my friend but no one replied, I went to open the door.
