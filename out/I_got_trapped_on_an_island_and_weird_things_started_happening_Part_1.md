I'm sure that everyone remembers this, but when I was a child I was always told to not give in to peer pressure. If anyone is offering you drugs or pretty much anything that you didn't want to do, you just firmly but kindly say no. I never gave it much thought because I was always good at making boundaries with people, my dad taught me that. However, for some reason I never thought that peer pressure existed in the adult world. Most of the people I was around that would offer things like weed or something to me when I was at work, would only ask once and after I said no, they would just leave me alone. Hell, I'm even friend's with one of those guys. This utter incompetence is what got me into the situation I'm going to tell you about. 

One day while I was at work a co-worker of mine, Adam, had invited me over to his place for drinks and pizza. I had asked him why since we didn't know each other that much, and he told me that I seemed like a cool person and he wanted to be friends. I eventually relented, and I met him at 7 after work. The night was what you would think: music, funny YouTube videos, pizza, alcohol. As the night died down, we had pretty much cemented ourselves as best friends. At one point I asked to use the bathroom, he told me to walk down the hall and it's the door on the right. I must have been incredibly drunk because I forgot which was my right and which was my left. I opened the door on the left. When I opened it I was hit with the most incredible smell. Lilac, roses, tulips, and fresh grass filled the air, and although I smelled them all at once, they were still distinctly different. 

Completely forgetting I needed to piss, I yelled at Adam, “Yo, what the hell is this room?”

Adam jumped up quite quickly and said in an eager voice, “Oh, yeah that's my plant room. I sit in there whenever I need to unwind. It's fun, you should try it sometime.”

I was a little unnerved but hey, everyone has their hobbies. I told him that I'd have to get some plants soon and the night ended soon after. 

Not a lot happened for the next couple months, Adam and I worked day in and day out. Dealing with unruly customers, unfair supervisors, and trying to balance our work and social lives. Whenever Adam and I would chill at his place, the conversations we had always ended up being about plants. I didn't mind though, because I was planning on getting a plant of my own. 

Adam and I had become such good friends that we both had keys to each other's apartments. So, it didn’t surprise me when he barged in one day and basically begged me to take this cruise with him. He told me about this cruise, “ The Floating Oasis,” he called it. A massive yacht that would hold 100 people, it would sail across the pacific to Japan and come back. The trip would take a month, and Adam had saved enough money to take me with him. I simply couldn't say no.

The yacht was massive. White, gold, green, and orange blended effortlessly into a concoction I can only describe as vibrantly beautiful. Once everyone was on the ship, we departed the port of California and made our way west. About an hour later, after we were settled, Adam and I took to exploring the cruise and everything it offered. The pool was dyed a beautiful green, with plants outlining the perimeter. Everywhere you looked there were either vine-like plants, or massive leaves that would tower you, looming above your head. I had never felt safer. 

A week into the voyage the captain told everyone that they had to stop at an upcoming island to fuel up. We were free to explore off the yacht as long as we were back in an hour. Jack, a pseudo survivalist, jumped pretty quickly to the idea of being able to explore a random island in the middle of the ocean. Adam seemed to like Jack, they had been talking for the past couple of days, and even though Jack clearly thought he knew more than everybody else, he made good company. We walked off the ship with a couple of other people and immediately noticed that the island was covered in pollen and a thick vast expanse of trees and vines littered the landscape. Lush greens and purples coated the earth as if God himself had painted the island. The sand was soft and warm, and the ocean stretched endlessly, its surface shimmering under the golden sunlight, with gentle waves lapping against the shore. The water was a deep, mesmerizing blue, fading to turquoise near the coastline, inviting and serene. The salty breeze carried the sound of distant waves, and the air felt fresh and alive, as if the sea itself was breathing. Jack ran past me into the tree line, and bent down to inspect the underside of a large rock. Adam and I followed while the rest of the group played in the water a ways away from the boat. 

“Help me lift this?” Jack asked Adam. 

Adam moved towards the formation and dug his fingers beneath it. I ran over with him and all three of us put every ounce of strength we had and pushed the rock onto its side. Underneath the rock was a sigil. A sapling buried its roots deep into the earth with massive leaves sprouting out, the image was encompassed in three circles and seemed to have odd ritualistic markings on it. 

As we inspected the markings, the ground started to shake as though the devil was pounding the earth beneath us. A shockwave knocked me on my back, and as I looked up into the tree line I saw a massive stretch of tree bark and luscious green leaves peering at me above the smaller trees around me. 

“Holy shit, did you guys feel that?” A young woman came running up to the three of us, her hair was long and brown, and she introduced herself as Julia. Adam interjected, “Fuck this, we need to leave. Now.” Julia helped me up and as I turned toward the ocean, I couldn’t believe my eyes. The ship was gone.
