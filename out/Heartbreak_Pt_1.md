Heartbreak does things to people, crazy things I'd say. Eva was my first love. We just sorta clicked. She approached me at lunch when I was getting my meal. Damn. The next day I got her number and we texted and called everyday. She was the sweetest girl. She had long black hair with her brown eyes. She was the prettiest girl I've ever seen. On to the week. 

I got the courage to ask her out and she said yes. Our first date was at a local fair. The memories are sometimes too much to handle. We made so much memories. It was early in the school year and she was sort of popular so I became popular. Those were the best days of my life. We dated for around 8 months until randomly she ignored my texts and calls. I tried to approach her in person but she turned towards her friends. I was confused. 

Then one of her friends came up to me. "Hey, um Eva thinks your weird so she doesn't wanna talk to you. And by the way she said you guys are over" Her friend said to me. I didn't respond. At first I thought this was some type of sick joke. Did I say something wrong? I texted her as I had ever since we met. I looked through our texts and even from the day before things were fine. All my texts were just checking up on her and sending her reels. No girl had ever liked me before and I've always been rejected by my crushes so I guessed Eva was playing with me...

On that Monday I showed up to school to see Eva with one of the football players kissing and her friends cheering her on and recording. I felt a cold chill go down my spine. I turned around and pinched myself to see if I was dreaming. I looked back and she was sitting on the football players lap now. A tear went down my eyes. I had always looked down on boys who got depressed over girls. Now I became one of them. I said to myself she's just a girl. I look on my phone and the wallpaper is a selfie of me and Eva. I stash my phone in my pocket and walk away from the school. I was always nice to her. I don't get it. Later that day Eva texted me a short text. 

"Can you please stop texting me"

I dropped my phone. Thoughts flew through my mind as I processed the reality. Anger. Sorrow. Betrayal. 

That night I tried to kill myself. I took some bleach when my parents were sleeping and drunk some. I walked over to the bathroom. I looked in the mirror. *Stop it. Why are you being sad over a girl? You soft ass bitch.* More thoughts flew in. *So much memories. Time. Wasted. Why. What did I do. Why would she do this.*  Then the violent ones. *Death . Kill the football player. Kill Him.* I looked around. Were those whispers? I pulled my phone out and stared at the selfie of me and Eva. *End it. End yourself. Kill yourself. Kill the football player. Kill her new boyfriend. Kill. KILL.* The whispers got louder. I looked in the mirror and looked at the selfie. Mixed in the pain was anger. But the anger had risen. I dragged myself to bed and tried to sleep. I thought of Eva and start crying. That's when it came. A man in a tuxedo sat at the end of my room. I usually would of jumped out of fear but I just sat there. "Kill me. Please. Just kill me" I said to the man.

He stayed where he was. He smiled. "Revenge. You want revenge. You say kill you but what happens to Eva and her new boyfriend? They will continue to date and their wrongs will be unserved" He said calmly. I wiped my tears and sat up coming to my senses. "Why are you even here? Who the hell are you? You can't get me Eva back so there's no point for you to be here except to kill me. I accept it. Just give me a quick death" I said to him. He shook his head. "I heard your pain. I'm here to help you get justice for it. Call me a spirit. Many don't see me when they get heartbroken. But your pain was some of the worst I've seen. You need revenge" He said to me a mask covering his face. He walked over to me and I looked in horror as he sat next to my bed and put his arm on my shoulder. "Do you accept the path to revenge or decline it and stay in pain" He said slowly . There is nothing to lose. Whatever this dude was offering was better than crying. "Sure" I said plainly. He smiled slowly his mask moving with his face movements. "Enjoy the full wraith of Vengeance. Oh and call me Vengeance" he said before getting up and exiting the room. I guessed it was a hallucination and went back to sleep.

I woke up with a jolt. I walked out my room feeling energized and walked into the bathroom. *Find the football player, Eva's boyfriend Dan and kill him. He stole her from you. Kill. KILL.* The whispers flowed into my ears and I felt a surge of anger. I get dressed and go the school but I watch from outside. *Dan.* Later that day I planned to go the football game at 7:00PM and follow Dan home. Had to kill him smartly and that would take some time. For a second I look at my hands. What had become of me? The once nice boy turned into a homicidal madman? I pushed the thought away. I just said to myself "That's what heartbreak does to you". Either Vengeance had gave me some type of power or I slipped away mentally into a psychotic wormhole. I knew I should get some help. I know I should talk to someone. I know this is wrong. No. I need revenge. I shake my head and prepare to walk down to the football game
