I’ve tried pretending it was just a fever. Hallucination. Trauma.
But I remember the night I died. Every second of it.

I had been traveling through England on business for my family—trade arrangements, finances, things I’d been groomed for since birth. I was supposed to meet a partner near the market square, but the town had begun… dissolving into chaos. The plague wasn’t just killing people—it was tearing the place apart.

People stumbled through the narrow streets, coughing blood, screaming prayers, crashing into one another like terrified cattle. The bells didn’t stop ringing. The air tasted like rot and smoke and fear.

One of them slammed into me.

A woman. Or what was left of one. Her eyes were milky, unfocused. Her veins blackened like ink bleeding beneath the skin. She collapsed against me, and her breath rattled in her chest before she coughed blood across my cheek and collar.

It was hot. Thick. Wrong.

I shoved her off so hard she cracked her skull on the stones. My stomach lurched—not out of pity, but disgust. I wiped the blood from my skin until it burned, then dropped the ruined handkerchief beside her twitching form like garbage.

I refused to die like this.
Not here.
Not alone in a foreign street.
Not as another nameless corpse carted off to some ditch.

I was Lucian di Rossi of Florence. My bloodline mattered. I mattered.

I ran blindly, the town twisting around me in a maze of smoke and shadows. By the time I realized I was lost, night had already swallowed everything.

That was when I saw him.

A figure stood at the far end of the lane—still, patient, dressed in a long dark coat. A birdlike plague mask hid his face, the kind English physicians clung to like talismans.

He walked toward me without fear. Without hesitation. The plague-ridden didn’t even look at him.

“Stay back,” I warned, though my voice shook. “I am a nobleman. Touch me and—”

“You are ill,” he said in a soft, smooth voice.

“I am not—”

“You are dying,” he continued as if reading from scripture. “But I can cure you. If you accept the price.”

I should have turned and run. But I could feel something inside my chest tightening—something that whispered he was right.

“Do it,” I said. “I won’t die in this cursed place.”

He lifted his hands and removed the mask.

His face was carved pale and perfect. Lips colorless. And from them, two gleaming fangs slid into view like blades.

I had no time to scream.

The bite wasn’t a clean puncture. It was a violent tearing. Heat and ice ripped through me. My heart hammered, then stuttered, then strained like it was trying to break free.

Blood poured from my eyes, my ears, my nose. My fingers twisted. My lungs seized.

I collapsed, choking on my own blood.

“You said you’d help me,” I gasped, tasting iron and dirt.

He placed the mask back over his face with priestlike precision.

“I am helping you,” he murmured. “Let the mortal part of you die. When the pain ends… come find me. We will begin the rest of your eternity together.”

He stepped into the smoke and vanished.

But I didn’t vanish with him.

I woke beneath a sky full of cold stars. The moon hung swollen above me, staring like an unblinking eye. The first thing I felt was the ground under my hands—soft, uneven, warm.

Not warm with life.
Warm with rot.

I pushed myself up and felt something burst beneath my palm. I looked down—

Bodies. Dozens. Hundreds. A sea of swollen corpses dumped in a mass grave.

The English plague pits.
I had died there.

Revulsion ripped through me and I convulsed, vomiting across the dead. Their slack mouths and clouded eyes stared up like they knew exactly what I was becoming.

I scrambled backward, slipping on ribs, sliding across bloated limbs—but I moved too fast. Too neatly. My balance wasn’t my own anymore.

A puddle nearby caught my reflection in the moonlight.
My skin had turned the same marble-white as the creature who bit me.
My eyes glowed faintly.
And inside my mouth… new edges. Sharp. Waiting.

I should have screamed.
I didn’t.

Something vibrated beneath my ribs—power coiled tight, hungry.

The hunger hit me so violently that I nearly collapsed. It wasn’t a craving. It was a need. A demand.

I staggered toward the edge of the forest until the small English town appeared again—changed, unfamiliar, but still the place where I had died.

A house near the road pulsed with warmth. Heartbeats. Breath. Living blood.

I reached the window before I knew I’d moved.

Inside, a family slept peacefully.

I slid the window up. It wasn’t wide enough for any human—but my joints loosened, dislocating with soft wet cracks as I folded myself through the narrow gap. No pain. Just the mechanical pop of bones.

I put myself back together quietly in the dark.

The father lay closest. His pulse throbbed beneath thin skin.

I leaned down. Opened my mouth. Bit.

His blood hit my tongue like fire and thunder and music all at once. I drained him. Then the mother. Then the children.

When I was done, the house smelled of iron and warmth and silence.

And for the first time in both of my lives,
I felt whole.

That was the night Lucian di Rossi died.
And the night something perfect replaced him.
