[I Am a Medical Anomoly: Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jhti9y/i_am_a_medical_anomoly_part_2/)



It’s been a cathartic experience, these posts. I have never really gone in depth regarding my personal life before and knowing that a bunch of strangers might give a damn about me and my weird ass situation is kind of comforting. 

I attended another symposium at the University today. I haven’t really talked about this much. It’s something I am summoned to at least a couple times a month. I don’t know how they get me out of here considering I can’t even walk up the stairs but I guess they’re the geniuses. I basically am brought out onto a stage, sit still in a chair in a hospital gown while some crusty old man talks about my condition and what a medical marvel I am. One of these crusty old dudes tried to “coax” my co-pilot to come out and it ended with me throwing a chair across the stage and security escorting me off to the side. I’m basically just a monkey in some weird lab experiment. I’m tired of it. Surely they can figure this thing out without making me dance like a jester for the masses.

I try to go down to the day room today, but it’s a little hectic in there today. 5D has been masturbating constantly since this morning and when I sit down he looks at me. Gross.

Finally, I find a spot in the hall next to a window that I can hunker down in until Mr Jack-Off can go limp and head back to his room. The asshole in my head is still trying to keep me from making posts but after all this reflection, anything he removes just comes right back. It’s all fresh in my mind now. 

Now I’ll be able to tell you who he is…what he is…why I am some kind of “medical marvel”. I call it a damn curse, but I suppose if I can prevent this from ever happening to another person then I am more than willing to sell my soul to the devil to get to the bottom of this. 

Here we go…

Stage 4: Depression



I remembered more than just waking up. There were fleeting moments where my mind tried to clarify that, somehow, I was still alive.

I heard dogs barking and raised voices above me on the drop off. The light against my eyelids told me it was day time.

Splashing and crunching of wet gravel grew closer and flecks of water hit my hair and face.

“...it’s him, the Novak boy…de Silva…identify him…”

I heard muffled words then a rapid intake of breath.

“Yes…him”

I heard the radio bleep to life and a voice call for an ambulance. The pain was indescribable. I didn’t try to move. I knew I would black out if I tried.

“...someone call Jamie?...on shift at the ER…give him a head’s up…”

No…don’t let my dad be the one to see me first…

Darkness took me again and I found myself back in a state of semi-consciousness as an ambulance rattled down the highway around me. 

“BP 85/56…not looking good…”

Just let me die, I begged in my head. You should have left me in the creek.

“...Jamie, let me talk to Alice…you don’t need to hear this report…”

Dad…

Darkness, then… something thick in my throat and tried to cough it up, but it was deep.

I heard alarms going off around me and the squeak of sneakers approaching me. I couldn’t see them, but I felt their hands holding me down as I fought to reach for the hard, thick tube in my neck. 

A dizzying feeling came over me and I knew they had given me something. Suddenly the tube was being pulled back from my lungs and out of my mouth, causing me to gag and choke.

“Collin, Collin, easy, it’s ok. My name’s Dr. Kelley, I’ve been taking care of you,” a soft female voice drifted into my ears and past my panic. I finally wrenched my eyes open and looked around me. Though one of my lids was swollen, I could stil see. I looked up and saw a small woman with fiery red hair looking down at me. Dr. Kelley, MD, was embroidered on her white coat. 

“Welcome back, Collin,” she smiled calmly as the nurses moved furiously around her. “You had a rough week but here you are.”

I gathered myself a bit and noticed how heavy my body felt. Not because of the drugs, but the plaster.

My left shoulder was completely encased down to my elbow in a plaster cast. I felt a wrap around my ribs, which protested as I attempted to scoot my body up. My left hip down to my ankle was nothing but cast. 

“W…what-” I said in a gritty, raspy voice.

“We’ll talk more when your dad gets here, ok?” Dr. Kelley patted my hand. “He’s here, he’s on his way up.”

“D…dad,” I stammered and just as I did he burst through the door, his eyes dark beneath and shining. He ran over to me and threw his arms around my head as gently as his enthusiasm would let him. I felt his chest heave with a sob and I felt…nothing…

“Oh my god, son, I thought you were gone,” he pulled back, grabbing my face in his hands. My face was bruised and my skull was wrapped tightly with a bandage, but he looked at me like I was perfect. I didn’t respond to that confession. I wasn’t sure what to say that would bring him comfort. I didn’t feel like I had won a victory…more like I had lost. I failed. 

Once the alarms were taken care of and my father had calmed down some, the nurses cleared the room and allowed Dr. Kelley to speak with us privately.

“It’s a miracle you’re still alive, Collin, I won’t sugar coat it,” she said as she scrolled down her tablet and tapped it a couple times. “One of the worst skull fractures I’ve ever seen, 5 broken ribs, broken hip, multiple organ involvement and bruising… so I guess my question is…what happened, Collin?”

I looked up at her, begging her silently to not make me talk about it. I didn’t want to tell the truth, but I knew I was so far gone that I needed professional help.

“Col, please,” my dad begged, gripping my hand tightly in his own. “Please give me something, son.”

That was it. That did it. 

“I…I jumped.”

My dad’s face went slack and the light flickered in his eyes. 

“Why did you do that, Collin?” Dr. Kelley asked in a professional, yet comforting tone.

“I…I hurt my friend. Ashlee.”

Dad nodded shortly and pulled away from my hand. 

“Dad…I’m so sorry. It…it happened again.”

Dr. Kelley, who softened at the sight of my dad looking so lost, prodded. “The voice? The blackouts?”

I nodded. I figured my medical history was now public knowledge especially considering I had almost killed someone. 

“Well…that’s part of what we need to discuss today. Jamie, do you need a minute?” She asked Dad. He took a breath in and shook his head. 

“No, I’m fine…Is he gonna be ok?” he asked.

“Well…I’m not exactly sure how to say this but…we found something that no one I have tried to contact has ever heard of. If I am right in my theory, this will explain everything you have been experiencing since you were little.”

I tried to sit up a little straighter, but my body wouldn’t allow it. My dad took my hand again.

“Well…what did you find?” he asked.

Dr. Kelley sighed and pulled up an MRI on her tablet. It was a full body MRI of me. I was looking around and it may as well have been Greek. I tried to see if I could see something weird, but my dad sat forward.

“What the…”

“You see it? I thought it was just an anomaly. This was the first MRI. Here’s the second,” she scrolled over and there was an almost identical scan that didn’t offer much of a different explanation.

“It almost looks like there’s… two bodies in the machine,” Dad said. I squinted a little and…yes there it was.

I could see my body from head to toe…but just in the shadows around it…a shadow of a second head, second set of arms, second set of feet, superimposed set of ribs… like I was housing an entire second person.

Dr. Kelley leaned forward slightly. “Am I right in understanding that Collin was a twin?”

Dad furrowed his brow. “Oh…well, yea he was.”

“And that baby fell victim to Vanishing Twin syndrome, correct?”

Dad nodded. “It was much smaller than Collin…it didn’t make it past about 18 weeks.”

Dr. Kelley nodded and tapped out a short note on her tablet. “I have a lot more to look into but I have a working theory. I don’t wanna say much until then, but I will guarantee you this- I will find out as much as I can and try to give you both as many answers as I can. Right now, I will let you two visit while I make a couple of phone calls…I’ll come back in a bit and maybe I’ll have more for you.”

She stood up and walked out. Dad’s eyes met mine.

“Collin…why?”

“I messed up so bad…we were riding in the Jeep and Ash…she was flirting with me and I didn’t want her to and something just…snapped. I choked her, Dad…I almost killed her.”

Dad looked solemn. “I talked to Ashlee’s mom. She’s doing ok now, she’s just a little shaken up. She told me to tell you she forgives you. She knows you didn’t mean it.”

I wanted to laugh. No matter what I did, Ash was always there to be the mom and be rational.

“Dad…is Ollie ok? I…I heard him when they found me.”

Dad tilted his head, a knowing look in his eye. “Ollie is ok. He’s been by a few times. Seems to really care about you.

I knew he knew, but I didn’t go into it. Now isn’t the time to try to come out to your dad considering you’re literally broken.

“Yea,” was all I could muster. Dad squeezed my hand again. 

“Col, nothing that happened that night should have made you feel like you couldn’t come home and talk to me. Or Ollie or Charlie or whoever. You have people who care for you, son, you just have to keep us in the loop.”

“I heard the voice again…right before it happened.”

“Did it tell you to jump off that drop off?” Dad asked, his voice less desperate and more focused.

“It just…reminded me that there was nothing left for me. Don’t, Dad, I know you wanna argue and hype me up, but what I did to Ash…My friends are never gonna forgive me, not really, and Ollie…looked terrified. I’d never get into college ball after what I did and you would be harassed because your son is a freak-”

“Stop,” Dad hugged me again. “You are not a freak. You heard Dr. Kelley, there may be something medically wrong. If it’s medical, we can fix it.”

I limply hugged him back with my good arm. “Ok, dad,” I answered, not putting much into it. I still wasn’t hopeful, but I couldn’t keep raining on his parade. 

After a while and a couple of bites of orange jello that were forced down by sheer pity from the look on my dad’s face when I told him I wasn’t hungry, a knock came at the door. 

Dr. Kelley came in followed by a host of what I assumed were doctors. 

“So this is the team that’s been taking care of you. Neurology, pathology, orthopedics, pulmonology, and the pediatric general physician.”

“And the other 4 dudes?” I asked, indicating the suits standing off to the side. Dr. Kelley nodded.

“Yes…these are the psychology department heads and the head of the Division of…Rare Diseases.”

My dad and I tensed at the same time. “Rare Diseases?” Dad asked.

“Right now, that’s what we are classifying it. It also encompasses genetics as well, but…honestly no one has seen anything like this.”

“What is it, Dr. Kelley?!” My dad was getting frustrated. Honestly, so was I.

“I’m sure you’re familiar with the medical term “fetus in fetu”?” she asked him. It sounded goofy to me but Dad nodded.

“Parasitic…twin?”

“Essentially, yes,” Dr. Kelley affirmed. She sat down in the chair next to Dad and the team behind her moved in a little. I kind of felt like an animal in a zoo. 

“So we have been gathering information about this…anomaly for the last week and have noticed some…strange things in Collin’s brain activity. There are times where there were spikes in activity that were being recorded almost in tandem with Collin’s brain activity. As if it were recording two people at once. I’d never seen anything like it so I sent it to the CDC and after reading his history and discovering that he was a twin…we believe this anomaly could possibly be Collin’s twin.”

*Jesus…finally*

My stomach dropped. “My…brother?”

Dad looked like he had been smacked in the face. “But..how?”

“Well, normally with fetus in fetu, a teratoma develops after the absorption. It can contain body parts, tissue, teeth and hair, things like that…with this we haven’t found any kind of teratoma. We couldn’t do further testing until Collin was stable enough to tolerate it, so we are hoping to be able to develop a plan to move forward with the testing with your permission.”

Dad looked lost and confused. “How does that correlate with the voice in his head? Or the black outs?”

“Well,” Dr. Kelley said hesitantly, “I only have a theory-”

“What theory?” Dad asked. “You said you weren’t sugar coating, so tell us.”

Dr. Kelley nodded seriously. “The layout of this anomaly on the MRI…it looks like it is around the same size as Collin…encompassing all of his body from the inside. Its my belief that this…parasitic twin may be growing with him, learning with him, gaining a sense of control.”

“Like a split personality?” I asked, my voice breaking.

“Is that how it feels to you, Collin?” she asked. 

“Sometimes,” I croaked, “I feel like I lose time. Like I go to sleep for a while and wake up not knowing what happened…I blinded a boy in elementary school and don’t even remember why, I have stolen from shops and don’t remember why and my friend Ash…I hurt her and don’t know how I got from A to B. I thought I was going crazy…”

I couldn’t hold back anymore. My eyes burned with tears of…grief. My whole life has been plagued by it from my mom grieving the brother I never had, my father grieving my mother silently so I wouldn’t see, and now…now I was grieving normalcy. My life, as I knew it, was over the moment a name was put to this thing in my head. I knew, after overhearing the following conversation with my dad and the other doctors, that I was in for a battery of testing, checklists, diagnostic exercises…and not to mention recovery. I’d never play baseball again. My hip was dust. My senior year was nowhere in sight. I’d not finish school with my friends or go out and have beers with Charlie and Ash ever again. I’d never get to know Ollie. 

My life as it was known to me would change forever. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Well, those tests seemed to just be the confirmation of the inevitable.

I was the first ever case of fetus in fetu in which the host and the parasitic twin were truly two in one. My brother, the voice in my head, has grown with me. We took our first steps at the same time, we went to kindergarten together, we played our first game of baseball together. He has learned and grown in the same space and speed that I have over the last 23 years. 

He has his own voice, his own beliefs, his own temperament… he is a whole different person living alongside me under my skin. Just below the surface aching to achieve total control and live my life as his own. Even now, he’s screaming. I can hear his voice echoing inside my skull, shaking my eardrums, making me want to take a screwdriver and just pierce them enough to end the chaos. But, I know that even if I were to do so, it wouldn’t stop him. Nothing has and so far, nothing will.
