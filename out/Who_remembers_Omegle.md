I still can't believe this was a time on the internet, people really had no clue about online safety. As a kid sitting with my sister in front of a computer flipping through omegle chats, nothing raised any red flags. I got to meet people the same way I did at school, how could that be wrong? We saw a few of our friends as it was mostly local, some older kids from other schools which made us feel super cool, and on the odd occasion, an adult. Most of the time it was fine, innocent enough, we got to talk to new friends or adults would yell at us that this wasn't a place for kids.

I remember though, as I'm sure many kids do, the time it got weird. I can't remember all the details leading up, but I remember the event. I had finished a chat with a girl my age. She was nice and also watched Doctor Who so we talked about that for a long time. I remember something weird about this next one, I don't think it was random but I can't remember where I would've found a link or anything. Either way, I somehow found the next chat. I thought it was still loading for a long time before I realized that it wasn't a loading screen, but an entirely dark camera. It was the background static noise that clued me in. I could hear someone shuffling around, the low buzz of a light, and then softly an inhale. Then exhale.

"Hello?" I asked, having no concept of this being weird, I thought maybe this kid's camera was broken. There was a small flurry of noise before a small timid voice responded,

"Hi" it sounded like a little girl, younger than me certainly, and immediately I wrongly assumed I knew what was happening, this was a little kid that wasn't supposed to be on the computer at this time. That was why it was dark and she was speaking softly.

"Hi! I'm Sophia. What's your name?"

"How old are you?" She asked in a whisper, ignoring my question. I frowned but rationalized that if she was little she wanted to see how old I was first.

"Eleven. You?" I heard mumbling then, there was no response that ever followed, it was just that. I talked at her a little more, telling her what I liked and all I heard in response was her breathing. I knew what it was like to want to listen and not talk so I just kept going. Toward the end of the conversation I asked her a question again and heard her begin to respond. She made just the start of a noise before I heard a loud bang and hushed yelling. The person was mad but wanted to stay quiet, so I couldn't hear what was being said, all I heard was the girl sobbing and apologizing before the call ended. I was terrified after that, I had never heard a kid so upset nor an adult so mad, my parents never yelled at us so the concept was completely foreign. I didn't understand what had happened but I felt like I had done something wrong. I thought through all that I had told the girl, what if I told her something that got her in trouble, what if I told the adult who was there something that would hurt my parents. I couldn't think of anything but I still didn't tell anyone about what had happened, afraid of being yelled at the way the kid had been.



I guess this isn’t as bad as it could’ve been, but still I was so freaked out. Does anyone else have any Omegle horror stories? I don’t remember much about the website's mechanics, but if anyone remembers, was there a search bar? I am racking my brain trying to remember how I got to that specific chat

  
  


EDIT: Hi, I'm back to this draft because I showed it to my sister. I asked if she remembered omegle and she said she did, and then told me a nearly identical story to mine. I asked if she was actually with me that night and I misremembered, but she said no, she was alone. As far as she can recount, she logged on and had gone through a few calls before the same thing happened, a dark screen with no one speaking. She said her name and asked if anyone was there and the little girl replied and asked for her age, just as she had with me. My sister lied, though, having an off feeling about this call. She said the girl didn't reply but she also heard the sounds of a very angry adult and a very upset kid. She said she remembers the kid crying, asking why she would lie, why my sister would do that to her, while the sound of rage grew and eventually overpowered the girl's cries and the call ended.



I asked her the same question, how did you get to the chat? She remembered a bit more than me, recalling a username or a link or something to the chat. She said she didn’t ever use it, she had seen it but never put it into omegle. When the call came through she recognized the username as the same one. She always assumed it was a random chance but I’m not so sure. Now that I’m older I feel so much more uneasy about this whole thing. I don’t know for sure but I imagine that man was not an innocent, kind man, and that girl, god I can only imagine who she was or what happened to her. Does anyone else have a similar story?
