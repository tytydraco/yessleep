I'll probably regret posting this when I wake up tomorrow. But I can't really tell anyone I know about this, and posting on an anonymous Internet account makes me feel...well, a little better, I guess.

For starters, I'm an international student on a loan studying at a certain university in the US. Unfortunately said loan is scarcely enough to scrape by, and since I wasn't able to get an on-campus job, I resorted to working outside in secret during the semester. I landed myself a 'decent' (decent by college student means) night shift job so that I can finish my classes and take a breather before coming in for work. The only problem was that because I live on-campus, more often than not I have to rush to catch the last bus back to my dorm once I clock out.

Things were going smoothly for the first few nights, and if I were to be honest, I enjoyed my secret part-time job. My manager usually leaves within an hour of my shift starting, so I can do my homework and revisions during the lulls in customers. At the end of my shift, I can relax and catch some shut-eye on the empty last bus back.

Although, the last bus was never truly empty. Sometimes, there would be the odd passenger boarding and alighting a couple of stops across town. When I get the occasional weekend shift, there would usually be a few drunk partygoers on board. However, these people would always alight the bus before it hits the long, pretty much desolate stretch of road connecting the town center to the college dorms. After all, besides myself, who else has a reason to stay on the bus all the way?

"Please hold onto the poles when standing on the bus. The next stop is 44th at Woodlands."

Usually, I would either be too sleepy after a tiring shift or use my phone to alleviate my ennui, so I didn't notice her presence during my first few rides on the last bus. However, one particular night, I decided to gaze out the window instead. That was when I caught a glimpse of her reflection in the back.

"...?" Surprised, I cautiously used my phone screen to peek over my shoulder. Yet it was too dark and shadowy to make out her features, so I surreptitiously tilted my head to glance at the mysterious passenger.

A girl, with black Asian hair and looking about the same age as me, sat on the bench directly behind mine. I had never seen her before on campus, and from the looks of her fashionable white lace dress, she didn't strike me as a college student either. An earbud rested in her left ear while the other loosely hung near her chest, but I didn't recognise the sounds being played from it.

Before she noticed me looking in her direction, I snapped my head back to the front and fiddled with my phone. Strange, I wondered to myself, where could she possibly be heading towards?

"This stop is 44th at Woodlands."

This was the final stop before the bus exited the town center proper, yet she showed no indication of alighting. The bus promptly sped past the unlit bus stop and turned onto the deserted road leading to the dorms.

"The next stop is 47th at University (Administration Bldg.)"

In the end, I decided it wasn't really my business to care about the destination of a stranger, so I tried not to think about her any further.

"This stop is 54th at University. This bus service ends here," the announcement rang. "Please take all of your belongings with you. Good night."

I stood up and prepared to leave, stealing another glance at the girl sitting behind me. Her eyes were fixated on something outside the window, and to my puzzlement, she didn't move from her seat, even as the bus driver switched the lights off and shooed me out of the exit.

I started. "W-wait a minute, Sir, you have another passenger..."

The middle-aged driver with an obnoxiously large beer belly stared at me as if I had just spouted nonsense in his face. Without a word, he shut the doors and drove the bus away with the girl still gazing out the window. Our eyes met for a moment, and I could swear I saw her blink before she disappeared from view.

My next shift was two nights later, and with all the piling academic work and pressure on me to perform well so that I won't get booted back to my home country, I quickly forgot about the mysterious Asian girl.

Texting my manager that I'd closed the store as usual, I briskly walked to the bus stop to catch the last bus. Waiting at the bus stop alone has always slightly unsettled me; after 10 pm, virtually no one would be out on the streets, making the entire town feel completely abandoned. It certainly didn't help that the street was barely illuminated by the meager and sparse street lights along its edges.

A loud and sharp honk snapped me from my phone. The bright headlights of the bus dazzled me for a moment before the bus rolled to a stop by the curb. With a soft hiss, the front doors swung open.

I smiled and bowed my head at the middle-aged driver in a polite gesture like I always do, though I’m not sure if he really understood me. Before I settled down on my usual seat behind the rear doors, he closed the doors and sped off down the road.

“Please hold onto the poles when standing on the bus. The next stop is Town Park at Kenwood.”

The only other passenger on the bus, a young lady with a large trolley bag in one hand, pulled the cord. A two-tone chime echoed inside the bus.

“Stop requested. This bus will be stopping at Town Park at Kenwood.”

I was absent-mindedly watching the lady struggle to get her trolley bag off the bus when the front doors suddenly hissed open. Blinking in surprise, I looked up and immediately stiffened.

It was that Asian girl, in the same white lace dress as before. She was standing in the aisle, her cold eyes seemingly unfocused yet looking in my direction at the same time. The wire of one earbud hung from her left ear, while the other earbud dangled by her side. This time, I could see that her earphones were connected to a rectangular-shaped object, about the same size as a mobile phone, but much thicker and with buttons at the side.

“Sta-and c-clear of the closing doors,” the announcement crackled over the speakers. “Please hold onto the poles when standing on the bus. The next stop is Woodlands at Town Park.”

Silently, she glided down the aisle at an incredible speed and sat down on the bench directly behind me.

I was pretty creeped out at this point, but not to the extent that I would want to jump off the bus at the next stop and walk all the way back to my dorm. Only when I looked down at my phone again did I realize my fingers had been trembling the entire time.

“This stop is Woodlands at Town Park. The next stop is 41st at Woodlands.”

The chime didn’t sound.

“The next stop is 44th at Woodlands.”

I kept my eyes on the reflection of the glass pane, focusing on her blurred visage with more scrutiny than I ever did during any of my lectures.

“The next stop is 47th at University (Administration Bldg.)”

We were out of the town once again. I was so focused on trying to discreetly stare at her reflection that I didn’t even notice the bus had come to a stop in front of the college dorms.

"This stop is 54th at University. This bus service ends here," the announcement rang, snapping me out of my trance. "Please take all of your belongings with you. Good night."

Just like before, the girl stayed on the bus as I alighted. When I finally turned to glance back at her, our eyes met instantly and I realized with a chill that she had been watching.

It wasn’t until the noise of the bus engine had completely faded into silence that I could turn away and leave the bus stop in a panic.

The next night, there were some issues in the store that my manager had to come in personally to solve. I stayed back a little too to help her, so by the time I clocked out and left the store, the last bus was already waiting by the bus stop.

…waiting? My footsteps abruptly slowed. Why would the bus be waiting for me? Knowing the bus driver, if he had arrived early and saw an empty bus stop, he would have driven past without a second thought.

Cautiously I approached the bus and greeted the bus driver. He glared at me as if I had just offended him and his entire three generations and tried twisting the key in the ignition again. The engine wheezed and spluttered out.

“Um…” I paused on the steps of the bus. “What’s wrong, Sir?”

He didn’t reply. I glanced at the interior of the bus, and immediately tensed when my gaze fell upon a familiar visage.

She was sitting in her usual seat, one row behind the rear doors. The wan interior lights threw dark shadows on her face, but I could tell that she was staring in my direction.

Before I could react, the engine suddenly spluttered into life. The bus driver gave me a perfunctory nod and gestured at the card reader.

“O-oh, sorry…” I paid my fare and gingerly walked down the aisle towards the Asian girl. Oddly enough, I was feeling a little foolish that night. I wanted to see what would happen if I sat behind her instead, so steeling my nerves, I walked past her and hurriedly sat down on the bench behind hers.

However, she didn’t react in the slightest. From my new perspective, I could make out the rectangular device that she had plugged her earphones into. An old-fashioned Walkman, similar to what my mother used to play her old cassette tapes back home. Its metallic front was heavily scratched up and the battery indicator was flickering blood-red.

“Please hold onto the poles when standing on the bus. The next stop is Town Park at Kenwood.”

Since she only had one earbud in, I could faintly hear what she was listening to. Curious, I carefully leaned in closer and strained my ears.

“On…2022…”

I started. That was today’s date, wasn’t it? Was she listening to the radio on her Walkman?

“…international scholar…at the University of…”

I froze when I heard the name of my college being mentioned. The actual fuck? At this point, I was too intrigued to stop eavesdropping, so I quietly shifted closer to the front.

“…working at…not supposed to…kept quiet about her part-time job…no one knew…”

It definitely didn’t sound like any radio broadcast I knew of. While I was still puzzled by what was being played from the earbud, the next sentence froze me.

“…clocked out later than usual…didn’t know the last bus had come five minutes early and left…black Toyota sedan stopped at the bus stop, right next to her…gets into the car…never be seen again—”

The crackle of an announcement briefly cut into the recording, startling me. “St-stop requested. This bus…zsstzz…stopping at 4...44th at Woodlands.”

I looked up at the girl. She removed her hand from the stop request cord and stood up from her seat, clutching her Walkman tightly in her other hand. I should have immediately looked somewhere else, but after what I’d just heard, I was too dazed to react in time.

Our eyes met. She stared at me blankly for a moment longer than usual, then slowly lifted her head up to look at something in the back of the bus.

I noticed her gaze and turned my head around to see what she was looking at. My eyes instantly widened at the black sedan car, following so close behind to our bus that it would no doubt crash into the bumper should the bus abruptly stop.

“This stop is 44th at Woodlands.”

The bus slowed to a stop, and when I looked back, she was already standing in front of the rear doors. Her blank eyes turned towards me one last time, and to my utter astonishment, she lowered her head in a bow before stepping off the bus.

I frantically tried to track her through the windows, and the last thing I saw before the bus turned away from the road was the girl entering the black Toyota sedan parked by the bus stop.

I haven’t gone back to work ever since that night. Today, I finally worked up the courage to lie to my manager that I was down with COVID and would be coming back to work tomorrow night. I don’t know if I would ever see that girl or the black sedan car again, but if we meet again, [I should probably ask what she is listening to.](https://www.reddit.com/r/killwrites/)
