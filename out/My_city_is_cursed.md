Well, I live in a very small town called Cidade da Lucky. This name doesn't make sense because luck is what we have the least here, the city is very small and is famous for its brutal crimes.

Just yesterday 10 children were killed in a nursery by a teacher. murders and suicides are very common around here. I was born and raised in this town so I'm pretty used to the goings-on, I'm currently 16 years old and I live with my mom and dad.

You must be wondering why we don't leave this place, we just can't, we tried to leave but whenever we pass a certain point our car breaks down and we have to go back to the city.

And as if something doesn't want people to leave the city, that is, when you enter the city there is no way out. There are also other strange things around here, for example when I'm going to school I always see an old man crying in the backyard of a home in a rocking chair, every day he is there in the same place rocking and crying as if he is sorry for something.

The house he lives in is very old and the paint is peeling and the wall of the house is covered in mold, and it is very scary to go there. I forgot to tell you a detail, the city is always cloudy and rainy, a very depressing, it's rare the times where I feel the heat of the sun.

City dwellers also report a shadow on top of buildings at night as if they were watching the city. One day I decided to ask that old man why he was crying because I was tired of seeing that old man crying every day, so when I was returning from school I asked :''hey are you ok?'' and he replied:''i'm not ok it's all my fault.''I said I wanted to come in and talk to him but he told me to go away but I insisted so he opened the gate and let me in.

he told me to come in the house i went in and the house was run down with a musty smell it felt like the ceiling was going to fall in at any moment i sat on his couch and ripped he sat on the other couch there i started talking to him.

His face was sore you could see his dark circles from crying and his sad expression. I asked him why he was crying and he told me everything. His name was Joe When he was young, legends circulated of a supposed woman in the forest who granted wishes in return that year he smoked a lot then he had developed lung cancer, it was already in a very advanced state and he knew he was going to die so he went after this supposed legend.

He went into the woods and found a wooden hut he approached and there was an old woman sitting on a wooden chair she asked him if he needed any wishes to be granted he said he wanted to cure cancer she asked what he would give in return and he said he had nothing to give so she said she would take something of her own.

She put her hand on his forehead and said some strange phrases after that he woke up at the exit of the forest he could hear some laughter coming from the forest it was probably that woman. He was feeling totally healed so it worked the legend was real, he went back to his home and continued his life normally the next day the murder cases began, now the spirit of that witch surrounds the city at night observing the disgrace that she herself caused.

He ended by saying ''that damn witch why did I trust her now we're all trapped in this town being forced to live with this terrible curse.''

I left his house wondering if I should really believe him, but I think he's right, this town is not normal. I went back to my house and decided to write this. never pass through this town unless you want to be stuck here.
