I'm Mahamudul and This story takes place back when I was in 11th grade.
I spent that entire year living in a hostel. There were four sections in total, and I stayed in the first one, right next to the staircase and the bathroom. Our room had thirteen of us packed in together.

Most nights we stayed awake until one or two in the morning, then had to get up by six when the hostel super would come around to wake us. He wasn’t exactly the nicest guy – more of a strict, bitter type – so we’d often mess with him. At night, when he was asleep, we’d knock on his door and run away, or throw little stones from far just to annoy him. That was our usual hostel life.

But then… things took a very strange turn.

One night, while I was in our room studying, a group of my friends were in another room, coming up with a new plan. They wanted to scare everyone by pretending there was a ghost in the hostel. I had no idea what they were planning, because after finishing my studying around midnight, I fell asleep early.

Later that night, something woke me up.
I felt someone tugging at my toes.

At first, I thought I was just dreaming. But then, it happened again. Someone was actually pulling at my toes while I was lying in bed. The third time it happened, I quickly pulled the blanket off of myself and looked.

What I saw made my heart sink.

Across the room, I saw a tall figure, wearing a long white kurta, swaying its arms slowly as it walked. My blood ran cold. I shook my friend Didarul, who was lying next to me, but he brushed me off, saying I was imagining things and told me to just sleep.

I pulled the blanket over my head, terrified, and tried to sleep again. But soon after, I felt the same thing – that tugging on my toes. This time, when I pulled the blanket away, I saw it clearly.

A tall man in white was standing right next to my bed.

I panicked and grabbed the hand of my friend Mamun, digging my nails into his skin out of fear. My friends never admitted anything to me that night. They just let me stay scared. I barely slept until morning.

When the sun came up, I told everyone what had happened. They all laughed at me. Some were curious, but most found it funny – because they were all in on the plan.

I told them I wanted to go home and leave the hostel. I was serious about it. A couple of days later, they tried it again at night. And again, I was terrified. This time, they couldn’t hold back their laughter. They finally admitted it was all a prank.

But the thing is… even now, years later, I still remember that night.
Because for at least one of those times… I know it wasn’t a prank.
