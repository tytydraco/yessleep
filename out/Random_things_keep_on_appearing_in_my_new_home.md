Good things, and I mean very good things do happen. It is true and I have seen it with my eyes. Nevertheless, people are also right when they say that if it is too good to be true, there is probably a problem of some sort.

I did have problems at the time, it was the sixties, 1965 to be specific, and in my part of the world at that time, one of the hardest things to accomplish was to find a place to call home. I was 23 years old, bold and full of hope for the future, despite bouncing from place to place and on the verge of homelessness, therefore, when the opportunity presented itself, I could not believe it. A two bedroom house with a beautiful garden and a backyard at a price that seemed to be a prank. It was too good to be true, but I did not have a choice.

The first night, pressed by the urge to urinate, I opened my eyes to see a massive bug on my pillow facing me, almost as if it was watching me sleep. I jumped, knelt and froze to assess the situation but the bug remained immobile. It was dead. Upon closer inspection, I realized that it was an abnormally big flea and feared the worst. I did not end up in a dream house only to battle a flea infestation, I thought, trying to spot other ones on and around my bed to prevent any catastrophe. There was indeed an infestation, just not the one I thought, rather one I was really not prepared for.

The second night, once again, pressed by the urge to urinate, I got out of bed and made my way to the door. When I finally noticed it, I froze, eyes widened, trying to understand what was happening. There was a hole in the wall next to the bedroom door, not of an important size, but large enough to house an eye that stared into my soul. I remained frozen for at least five minutes just not knowing what to do and trying to comprehend, until I started approaching slowly to examine the eye, however, nothing could prepare me for the reaction it had when I got a few inches close to it.

It blinked.

My heart almost exploded as I fell backwards. I then turned on my stomach and crawled towards my bed to retrieve the baseball bat that I had hid underneath. Afterwards, I stood up and immediately looked at the hole which was still there, but the eye was gone. I patched the wall the very next day after work hoping that I did not notice the hole when I moved in and that the eye was just some vivid hallucination, especially since my job required me to remain sane and rational.

The third night, I woke up suddenly because I was not in peace. From the deepest parts of my mind or maybe even my heart, I knew something was wrong with that eye incident. I opened my eyes to see the covered hole and it was still— covered. I then scanned the room with my eyes trying to detect any anomaly such as a new hole or anything else extraordinary and ended up finding exactly what I was looking for. Placed on my desk a few meters away from my bed, a golden can shone in the darkness of the room. I lifted my head, surprised by the foreign item, and with my eyes riveted on the can, I slowly sat on my bed with my feet touching the floor. Of course, I had to get closer to investigate the strange occurrence, knowing that I was not the one who put the can there, so the next step was to walk to the desk. The moment I looked down to spot my sleepers, next to my right foot, I glimpsed a long, pale and lanky arm that rapidly retreated under my bed.

I took off running for my life.

Remembering Sam, the first man that welcomed me in the neighborhood days ago, I ran to his house to ask for help and we called the police. After investigation, nobody or anything suspicious was found and I was just reminded to make sure that every door and window remain secure at all times, especially during the night. A few hours before morning, I stepped into the house and searched the house myself once more just for good measures. Everything looked normal, except for the presence of a strange small tree in the backyard that I know was not there the days before. I did not know what it was at the time and it had small and strange red fruits that looked punctured, and that contained seeds inside the holes, instantly reminding me of the eye. I decided to ignore it and barricaded myself in the room after finding out that there was nobody under my bed and that the can was gone. The next morning, before stepping out of the house for work, I noticed that the strange plant had also vanished. While at work, I asked a colleague about the plant, passing it off as something strange that I had seen in a random picture in the newspaper and that got stuck in my mind since. To this day, Susan is still a big plant enthusiast and she is the one who told me that what I saw was undoubtedly a yew. After work, I did what I could to delay returning to that house quite successfully, dreading whatever madness awaited for me within its walls.

The fourth night, which is when I returned from work, I made my way to the kitchen and noticed that the yew had also returned in the backyard. I armed myself with a kitchen knife, ready to face my fears, unaware of what awaited for me in the bedroom. My heart was beating louder than a drum as I progressed, step after step up the stairs. Halfway through, I noticed something on one of the stairs and picked it up: it was the wheel of a toy car. I slowly put it back in place and advanced until I reached my bedroom door and immediately noticed another small object carefully placed in the middle of the entrance: it was a die, a red die like those found in the casinos. I did not pick it up and just opened the door, expecting to find something more. I stepped inside the room and looked around but I could not spot anything foreign or suspicious. I then sat on my bed, exhausted by all the madness when a thought suddenly reached my mind: what about under the bed? I sighed to build up the courage before kneeling in front of the bed and taking a look under it. Fortunately, I did not see a psychopath hiding and smiling back at me, however, I could see that there was something. Using my handkerchief, I retrieved the strange object and slowly brought another madness to light, trembling and sweating as soon as I could clearly see what I was holding in my hand: a severed and partially decomposed human pale ear. I spent the rest of the night in a motel.

At work the next day, I spent the whole time in my mind, reflecting on how and where I would live because I had decided to vacate that house, I just had to determine when. After leaving the office, I purchased a small bag of apples and slowly walked to the house like a zombie, overwhelmed by fear, despair and fatigue. Timmy, Sam's 6 years old son was enjoying the late afternoon on his bike, going up and down the alley. I waived at him before I could reach the front of the house and he waived back. When I finally reached the front door, already trembling in fear, the little boy surprised me with...

"He doesn't like those." Timmy said behind me.

"What?" I replied, turning around to look at him. I did not even hear him arrive but there he was on his little bike, one foot on the ground, the other on the pedal, and hands on the handlebars.

"He doesn't like apples." He elaborated.

"Who?" I asked, already perplexed about the interaction.

"Rebus." He answered.

"Rebus?" I repeated, chuckling. "Who's Rebus?" I then questioned.

"Don't you know or you just don't understand? He's been warning you all along." He added with a cold tone and an equally freezing stare.

"Timmy what on earth are you talking about?" I asked, absolutely bewildered.

"Good evening Mr Hayward!" He gleefully wished before pedaling away. 

I decided not to think about that strange conversation.

The fifth night finally arrived, finding me sitting on my bed, and I was contemplating two possibilities for the occasion: staying awake all night or spending another night and money at the motel. My strange conversation with Timmy resurfaced in my mind, distracting me a little bit from the dreadful night. Rebus does not like apples and he has been warning me, oh really. Rebus? I know at least what that word means: a puzzle that contains words but in which they are sort of coded and represented by— wait a minute, I thought. The nightmare started when I saw the eye, then after the eye I saw the golden can, then the arm sliding under the bed then the tree, the yew. Eye - Can - Arm - Yew. I can harm you? I thought, immediately standing. Then the yew disappeared but it returned the following night, and then I saw the toy car wheel, then the red— die, then the ear. Yew - Wheel - Die - Ear. You will die here? I finally realized.

I had to leave.

No need and no time to pack everything anyway, let me just take the essentials, I thought. I grabbed and loaded my suitcase with a few stuff, before flying throughout the house and towards the entrance door, ready to flee. Wait, flee? Like the flea I found the first night? The message was quite clear all along. As soon as I reached the living room, a major obstacle stood in my way: the yew tree was there, its root emerging from the then broken floor. One of its red fruits then popped out its seed as I initially thought, but when the object landed a few inches away from my feet, I realized that it was a black die instead. The rest of the fruits then followed, imitating the first one, and die after die, the message appeared clear to me. It was time to flee or die. I made my escape through the back door and through the backyard, like a thief running away with their loot, never to return on the crime scene.

Several months after, although getting drained financially, I paid for the lease cancelation while also paying for motel rooms or bouncing from place to place of friends and acquaintances again. I never returned to that house and never retrieved the rest of my belongings. Strangely, there was no damages or anything abnormal according to the real estate agency, but true or not, that is their point of view.

I ended up landing a job in another town and found my dream home there along with my dream wife and this is where I have lived since. Who or what was Rebus as Timmy called it? How did he get to know Rebus? I do not care to know. That thing certainly has its own real name and Rebus was just what the little kid chose to call it because of the way it communicates. Truly, in addition to the monstrous and terrifying human beings that have lived in this world, there are really some strange and dreadful things out there. Please always be careful.
