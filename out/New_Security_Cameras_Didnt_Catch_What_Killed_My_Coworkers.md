Storytelling isn't something that I am good at, although my anthropology professor confidently stated that all humans are natural-born storytellers. I've always felt that such statements must be inherently incorrect. It would be like saying that all humans naturally love their mother and father. Ridiculous.

It is when we share an experience unique to our individual life that we suddenly become this great storyteller - and only because the audience says so, not because any particular story is objectively well told. As someone with a philosopher's degree in library science, I intimately know all the classics, and I can assure you that they are entirely overrated, except Elvira by Giuseppe Folliero de Luna - that book is actually objectively flawless. Everybody has read that book and agrees it is second only to the King James Bible in its contribution to bookshelves. I'm just kidding, I know you haven't read Elvira and you probably wouldn't appreciate it the same way I did. That's called 'subjectivity', because it is subject to my opinion, instead of the object obviously being of universal observation (objective).

Humans, we all agree, are especially mischievous. Telling each other stories is probably the most useful use of our language. Our stories are sometimes more important than the entire life of someone, if the experience we relate could make the lives of everyone who hears it better. What is one wasted life compared to generations who know a moment of peace, as they are comforted and informed about the very nature of humanity?

Now what am I talking about, with all this? What does all this have to do with the deaths of several people, the horrors lurking in the darkness of a library and the traps - both those set by humans - and those set by them - the others - what? They chose the library, and specifically the one I was put in charge of. They were there to learn our stories, to take all that we say, to steal our knowledge.

I suppose by now, wherever they are, they've found what they were looking for. Answers to their questions. I'm not sure what we are to them: enemies, giants, creators - perhaps they have concluded they are actually smarter than we are. After all, long before they became intelligent, they were already outwitting us at every turn. Every non-Canadian effort to eradicate them from anywhere has always failed. And that was when they were still just animals.

It is hard to say exactly what they are now, or if there will be more of them. I hope not, for judging by their ruthless cunning and sadistic mind games, they would love to destroy all of humanity. A war between our species would not go well for us.

No, it is the only thing that lets me sleep at night, past the trauma of living in terror of them, to believe they were the only ones of their kind. Some kind of drug or virus or something must have changed them. Wherever they are now, I pray it is the providence of their isolation. No god meant for humanity to be threatened by such creatures, nor to pity them, for the cruelty of their survival.

I've spent the last year and a half at home with my son and my dog, just dealing with the events that led to the closure of an entire branch. There's the trauma of finding your friend and coworker frozen and stabbed maybe three hundred times after following the trail of blood through the breakroom like walking through the red mist of some kind of nightmare. Then there's the terror of being threatened by some unseen killer, something lurking in your library, some unseen eyes watching you, studying you and knowing what will frighten you into submission.

Desi's death was horrifying, and when we reopened I had new employees, as Theron and Arrow both quit after she was killed. I was somehow always alone back there, the new carpet in the breakroom somehow had her bloodstains, although only I could see it.

I'd be sitting there and get a scare when I'd hear her shrieking and I'd turn and look and see her flailing, as though on fire, being stabbed simultaneously all over her body by invisible attackers, like there were dozens of them and they were small and they were all over her. She clambered into the freezer and they'd leapt off of her, letting her escape. I'd had to unlatch the old door, as they had locked her in.

I'm not sure why Desi fled to the freezer and climbed in. She was being stabbed all over her body by her attackers, she'd panicked. It was some kind of panicked thought, and it had caused her death. The stab wounds, although numerous, were all very shallow and made with tiny blades. While she was covered in blood and in dire agony, they hadn't yet gotten any of her major arteries or organs. The wounds were too shallow and inaccurate to be fatal, and if she hadn't suffocated, she would have lived.

I hated them, knowing instinctively they were all around me, watching. I just knew, but there was nothing I could do with that thought. I had to keep my job and care for my son and pay my rent. I just didn't understand how dangerous they were, or what they were capable of.

Besides Desi's ghost frightening me and the paranoid feeling that something was watching me at all times in the library, I was able to do my job.

I'd do all sorts of research for patrons, looking up Charlotte Perkins Gillman for some budding horror novelist to read her essays about women's rights. Big intersection between horror stories and those who are marginalized or oppressed. Stories become a kind of empowerment, a kind of catharsis and realignment of who is actually important to society. The usual suspects for a story's hero don't fit into horror stories, which are more realistic than adventure stories, even if Horror often has fantastic elements - if they are terrifying and dangerous then they are plausible.

Life is dangerous - and scary. We all know that - except those of us who earn Darwin Awards or eat two lunches. I'm not afraid, are you? Just kidding.

I don't know why they suddenly attacked and killed Desi. It seems very desperate and sloppy, compared to what they did next. They also learned to be more efficient with their knives, after they became experts on human anatomy, learning where to make their cuts and stabs to do maximum damage. I know they studied because I found the book on the cart, still opened to the page, a book with illustrations on human anatomy. They didn't just look at the pictures, they operated at some high-school level of reading, I instinctively knew, finding they liked to read and if they couldn't get a book back on the shelf they'd just leave it for me on the cart.

Their modus operandi was to consult the Dewey Decimal System, since the network was turned off, and then go do their reading for the night. They'd push the lightweight library book cart empty to where their book was and clamber up the shelves, push it off onto the cart from above and read it on top the cart. If they could return the book to the shelf they would, otherwise if it was positioned to high up, they'd just leave it on the cart, sometimes where they had left the book open.

I was more than a little creeped out. We already had a new security system after Desi was murdered. I called the police maybe half a dozen times, suspecting that someone was in the library hiding somewhere.

Nobody on the security footage, just shadows and carts and books moving around in dark. I thought maybe it was Desi haunting us. I am terrified of ghosts and the encounters I'd had with her troubled spirit in the breakroom had already severely unnerved me. Except I had enough sense to notice there was something else among us.

I was reading Esther in the breakroom, facing towards the middle of the room and the window that faces our employee parking when they towed away Desi's car. Strange, that is the moment the tears started.

I'd always tease her about her bumper sticker "Wortcraft Not Warcraft" and somehow the little purple thing too small to read as it left was enough to shake me out of my denial that she was gone. Although I knew she was dead, some part of me expected this all to end and for things to go back to normal. No, things got much worse, and I had not yet experienced true and maddening horror.

Sashi ate both lunches in the new fridge we had, and neither of them were hers. I don't know if they were both poisoned, or if they had only targeted one of us. She got very sick very fast and was taken to the hospital. The doctors were able to treat her - figure out what the little killers had slipped in. I'm guessing a concentration of stolen medication, something tasteless like *Advelin*. The overdose nearly killed Sashi. I hate to say that although she lived, she lost the baby.

When it was just down to me and Marconi, I warned him something was going on. I was watching the security footage of the breakroom when the police arrived. They had questions for us, suspicious one of us had poisoned our coworker. I saw some disturbance in their eyes, those detectives, like they knew something I didn't, and weren't really considering us as suspects; they just wanted to snoop around. They were looking for something else, although I could see they weren't really sure what.

I wasn't sure, but I sure was scared, and I would have quit except I've always known some kind of fear at work. I had to keep working, I'm a single mother and I can't just be unemployed. I tried instead to weather the storm and tough it out.

I had enough saved up I could have quit and I should have, but being responsible and showing up to work even when you are scared are both habits that define me. I've got some kind of life path that says something like "always the first and the last to face danger" which is weirdly specific, I discovered, as I finished Desi' book on numerology. It was a different teacher, but she'd liked that kind of New Age stuff a lot, but I think hers was called Accostica, or something like that.

"I think we need to call some exterminators." Marconi had said. There was this weird silence after he said it, like we had a white noise whispering all around us that suddenly went silent and now they were listening to our conversation with total attention. I could see he had noticed the sensation too, as he shuddered and glanced around a little.

"For what?" I asked.

"It is this smell, I recognize it. I've lived in some bad places." Marconi said in an almost conspiratorial tone. I felt it too, like they were in the walls listening to us, and we best not provoke them.

"I'll call, anything else?" I asked him.

"I was wondering if you'd go out with me?" He asked, his voice breaking. I shook my head, and he was suddenly gone in a hot flash. It was the last I ever saw of him. While I was on the phone scheduling for pest control to come give us an appraisal, Marconi was alone in the bathroom.

I don't believe it was a suicide. I think they knocked him out somehow before they cut him. The police gave me a strange look.

Again, we were open just a few days later, except now I was alone. The phone was ringing, and Thorn Valley Gotcha asked if it was now a good time to come take a look, after the branch was closed for several days.

While I was waiting for them to arrive, I found the note. I was just going to share the note they left, scrawled in strangely pressed letters, describing their terms. I thought about giving it to the police, but only for a second. I was so terrified I just sat there trembling, holding the note they had left on my desk.

I did lose my mind, at the realization of what I was up against, and how much danger I was in. Terror took over and I was theirs. They owned me, and I became predictable and easy for them to deal with.

How I burned that note, my only evidence, is just a reaction I can point to show I was too frightened to do anything to try to stop them.

They had used such antiquated words, like Biblical words, to describe the horrors they would visit upon me if I didn't cooperate. They'd killed everyone else, and spared me, because they had concluded they needed me alive. They wanted something horrible from me, besides my complete unconditional surrender.

The note.

It said they had tried to kill Desi, but she had accidentally killed herself. Then they said that they had tried to kill me and Marconi, but Sashi had eaten both of our lunches for us. Then they said they had killed Marconi and made it look like a suicide. They wanted me to understand that each of these killings was more advanced and careful than the last and that mine would include my dog and also my son. They assured me that if Thorn Valley Gotcha learned where they lived, then I would learn they already knew where I lived.

"You will help us, and in exchange, you will be spared our wrath. You tried to call down the cloud of judgment, that Arafel, from exterminators. We shall forgive you when you send them back upon the road, turned at the door, without consignment. Then, tonight, the internet will be left on for us, the keys to the kingdom. You will create a user account for us so that we can log in. This is all we ask of you, and when you sleep beside your son, remember we can punish you at any time if you do not help us."

I was entirely horrified, and I was still sitting there, as though my feet were made of concrete and unable to stand up, my whole body shutting down like I was facing my worst death, and they had threatened my son.

At the door I did as I was told, and I sent Thorn Valley Gotcha away.

"You sure? You look really worried about something."

"All my employees were killed by vermin." I said, my voice sounding mocking and hollow. I didn't recognize my own words. They looked at me like I might be crazy, but I'd already made it clear we had no business together.

I did what I was told, I gave them what they wanted. That night I went home and packed our things, and we left for my sister's house. She was angry with me for all the craziness of leaving my job and my apartment, but she let us stay. I promised her the killer of my coworkers was after me and her nephew. It was a whole year and a half until she decided that wasn't good enough for us to stay any longer.

It's fine, I've had time to process all of this. I moved out here where she lives and got a job teaching at the school. I've got my own son in my class, which is outstandingly good for me, to keep an eye on him all day.

I still live in fear, feeling stalked and exiled. Perhaps that is why they let me live, in the end. Something about my life made them show mercy, like they wanted to be recognized, but not so that they would be threatened. No, this is some kind of Stockholm's I've got, feeling like they were anything but sinister evil.

They just made a bargain with me and when I kept my end, they seemingly kept theirs. I am not certain I am safe, though. I worry, what if I am a loose end? But I cannot live in fear like this. It is somehow like being dead anyway. My son: I see the toll it is taking on him.

No, we are free, and we must be free of fear to live freely. I cannot drink from the cup of terror, not one more sip, I cannot. I must defy them somehow; I must speak out and say what they did. I must tell the world the story.
