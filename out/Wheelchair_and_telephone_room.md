A few summers ago me and my brother and my cousin were camping with our family and my brother found this cool place to explore called Northville. It’s in a Bandan psychiatric hospital where there’s been countless patient and patient killings patient and doctor killings and of course a lot of mental distress so anyways after leaving our campsite and driving there, it looks like something straight out of a movie. The walls were deteriorating. Everything was broken and Olden basically everything you would expect a typical haunted hospital to look like.

Upon arriving, we get out of the car and then head towards the building and conveniently, I forgot my flashlight, but we proceeded anyways. My brother was recording for YouTube at the time and I decided to try to communicate with any spirits there so I told us to stop walking, so I can set my intent to send a message to anyone nonliving. The very second I ordered those words I was interrupted with an extremely loud bang above us, which we thought was another human, and  a place like that you don’t want to encounter another human, so we stayed low and tried to investigate what the sound was and there was no more noise after that, so we carried on. It wasn’t until later that we realized there was no second floor above us. It was a roof.

Fast forward to approaching the seventh floor we encounter this pitch black room with a sign next to the door that said “wheelchair and telephone room”. Now keep in mind. It’s a bright and sunny day out but this room was darker than dark. It looked as though it ate any incoming light. My brother did not go in there and me, being the older brother immediately said “What you’re not willing to go in there?” so I approach the door and the second I touch the handle to the door the heavy hallway door next to me begins closing on its own. We checked everywhere for a draft, and found none. Then, after feeling how heavy the door was, we realized a draft couldn’t move the door, so we carried on and I still wanted to go in that room to feel its energy. So I grabbed the handle again and attempt to open it and M interrupted when my brother hears a growl which I did not hear. So we sit and listen for a few moments, and then I proceed to go into the room within my first three steps into that room. My entire body disappears, and I was wearing all white. While standing in the room and feeling out the energy in there, I felt an evil presence but before I could say anything, I was interrupted by that hallway door closing again except this time it slammed shut.

About a minute later, my brothers fully charged camera battery then proceeds to die so we had to stop recording and then resumed recording once we were in the basement using his phone. It wasn’t until reviewing the footage that I put two into together every time I was about to enter that room up until I did enter that room , either the door would close, my brother would hear a noise, and then my brothers fully charged camera died. What’s even crazier is I described how it felt like something was circling above me and trying to attack me, but couldn’t as if it was bouncing off of a fishbowl, the only way I can describe it, while watching the footage, we noticed I was actually looking up at the ceiling in a circular motion. I completely forgot that I did that it’s all review the footage. All of the overwhelming evidence led us to the conclusion that something very dark resided in that room. 

Since then, the building has unfortunately been torn down but luckily we have that entire 3 part series on YouTube. I will post the link to part 2 where I go inside the haunted room and catch doors closing on camera. Skip to 28 mins to watch the wheelchair and telephone room scene.
