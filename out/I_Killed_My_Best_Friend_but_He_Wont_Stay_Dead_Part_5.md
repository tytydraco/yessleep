[\[Part 4\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pdk8so/i_killed_my_best_friend_but_he_wont_stay_dead/)

I was almost content with giving up on my Sisyphean task. I lived the next few days normally - granted with the knowledge of the graveyard full of John’s bodies - but still as normal as I could. It became less traumatic and more of a hassle with every repeat. But even more, I underestimated the deep isolation that came with it. I was itching to tell John, but I already had, and didn’t get me anywhere. I had considered telling Dahlia, but it felt like my mental breakdown had gotten the overflow of emotions out, not enough to completely calm me, but enough to where I could boil within my own mind and endure it. I was going to let my plan to rescue Dahlia rest. I was ready to forget our unspoken agreement. I was hellbent on ignoring John’s sudden immortality. So I bit my tongue whenever he pulled Dahlia into his embrace and she hesitantly reciprocated, whenever he took her back to his room and I could either listen to them through the walls or go home.

I hadn't accounted for the looks Dahlia would give me. Whenever John was around, she would stare as subtly as possible, the way she did before we'd first talked, and I found myself wishing John would catch her and reprimand her. But she was smart to not make it obvious. When we were alone, her gaze held an expectancy, even when we were talking about something completely different. And whenever I brought up anything that wasn't leaving with her, she would look disappointed. John wouldn't have noticed, but I did. I had tried to make it up to her in every way possible; I asked about her favorite books and bought them for her, I asked her if she needed to talk about everything and assured her I'd be there for her, as long as it was within the four walls of John’s house. That didn't stop her from bringing up the one topic I didn't want to talk about, this time without asking.

“Do you like the beach?” She asked while we laid together, her head on my arm and her hand stroking my shirtless chest. It had been so nice, but her question tore me out of my relaxation. I knew immediately where it'd lead. In her memory, we had never talked about it before. I shifted next to her, clearing my throat.

“Sure. It’s nice.” 

“I really wanted to go… before this,” I wanted to shoot this down immediately, but I nodded along as she talked. “Living right by a beach would be nice, I think. I used to go to Siren Haven with my parents each summer and I remember just wishing I could stay there forever. We rented a little house that stood right on the sand. You could walk out in your swimsuit and basically jump into the water. Wouldn't it be nice to live like that?”

“Yeah.”

“Would you like to?” I idly stroked her hair, staring up at the ceiling. I couldn’t find it in me to lie to her, but my voice left me fully at the thought of telling her the truth. My chest tightened when I felt her move, my hand slipping from her hair. “...I never felt like I fit in here. I can't explain why. That's why I wanted to leave without telling anyone.” She continued. “I know how stupid it was to get in that car, but… I was so desperate-”

I refused to look at her until I heard her sniffle. She was crying, the first time in months.

“Dahlia…” I pulled her closer. She didn't hide her tears. 

“I really want to leave.”

Sitting there, forced to listen to her cry her heart out to me and knowing I was the one person who could ease her pain, I begrudgingly reevaluated my decision. I would be miserable either way, but I found I couldn't deal with Dahlia’s tears. Not when she’d blame me for them.

I had to try one last time. I had felt compelled to give John at least a somewhat dignified death, but I had to let go of that. It had to happen without any formalities, without burying John or cleaning up his mess. I wanted to drive away and never return. And if he came back, I'd just kill him until he wouldn't. As pragmatic as I could and the same day, when John got back, I excused myself, grabbed my gun and shot him between his eyes before he could get a word out at the dinner table. His body slumped behind the counter. I didn't even have time to register Dahlia on the chair, who'd fallen backwards with a horrified scream. 

“Get up, we gotta go.” I said as I pocketed my gun.

“But-”

“Out, now.” She flinched when I reached for her and I caught myself before I lashed out. I took a breath. “You wanna leave, right?” I redirected her eyes to look at me instead of the corpse. “Dahlia. Do you want to leave?”

“Ye-yes-”

“Then get up.” She reached for my hand, looking at me, then my gun, then to John's dead body. “Get dressed, come on.” I urged as I helped her up. Still shaking, but more determined, Dahlia disappeared down the hallway to grab her things. I felt the agony of every second in which I had to stand next to John. I couldn't keep my eyes off him or the blood that ran down his face. The lifeless eyes that looked at nothing. I felt a sense of fear looking at John's corpse. It was an anticipatory dread of witnessing his body twist back into a living state, which never came. He never walked into the living room through any of the doors either. If only he could stay this way. Dahlia returned, wearing John's shirt, a pair of his jeans secured with a buckle and her own shoes that she had been wearing when she got here. I grabbed John's jacket and pushed it into her hands.

The faster we got out of there the better. I pulled Dahlia with me, feeling her sluggish movements. I pulled her closer, steadying her until she pushed herself away and walked by herself. With my car parked further away than usual this time, I frantically searched for my car keys as we got closer. Not feeling them in my right pocket, I checked the left, the back, the jacket.

“Fuck.”

“What’s wrong?” I heard Dahlia ask. Background noise that I couldn’t find the strength to focus on.

Had I left the keys in John’s house? I let my mind wander back to the inside and replayed if I’d put them anywhere out of habit. I should’ve double checked, even in my frenzy. A rush of heat broke out over my body. I couldn't go back, not now. Or was there still time? No, I couldn't go and risk him already being back. Not when Dahlia was outside. Could I tell her to go back inside, or would that revive John?

I stood frozen, weighing my options when a thundering noise tore me out of my thoughts. I noticed the sound and impact before any pain. A sudden force pushed me to fall over and disoriented from the booming sound I hastily looked around. Just seconds later everything registered as a gunshot to me, and my heart sank with the realization that John was back and had shot me. Adrenaline allowed me to scramble to my feet while holding onto a tree as I cursed. We had to get away, he'd shot at me. How far could I make it by foot, and where to? Where had he shot from? I looked in the direction of his house, but the door was closed. There was nobody there.

I heard the clicking sound as the gun was cocked next to me. Only now did I turn and see Dahlia holding my gun, aiming it at me from a safe distance. I stared at her in disbelief.

“Dahlia?” She didn’t answer, taking a step back instead. “Come on, stop that,” I tried with a gentle tone, but the pain was slowly setting in. 

“I will kill you if I have to.” She spoke clearly, soft and serious, never once taking her eyes off me.

“Don’t-... Dahlia, please…” I took a step towards her, cautiously extending my hand before I tried to grab the gun. Between my injured leg and her wariness, she stepped back and I missed it. Another shot followed and I dove to the ground, certain that she’d struck me again. Only on a second glance did I realize the bullet had hit the tree next to me, bark splintering off and raining on me. It was enough of a distraction for her to take off with my gun.

“Fuck- Dahlia!” I struggled to get up, but once I put my weight on my injured leg the pain stopped being an afterthought. I cursed, letting out a raspy hiss. My jeans were torn where the bullet had entered and exited, blood spilling into the grass. I felt light-headed, unsure if it was the blood loss, the sight of my injury or the fact that Dahlia had caused it.

Fucking Dahlia. I laid back in the grass, swallowing my vomit and trying to stay conscious. Here I was, risking my life and killing for her, killing my best friend a dozen times, and she did *this*. I struggled out of my jacket and tore the sleeve off, wrapping it around my leg and tying the knot as tight as I could. The keys to my car fell out of a pocket I was sure I had checked before. Great. She'd run off without a hint of hesitation, and I was sure that if she made it out of the woods she’d tell the cops. The thought made me feel as if I stood beside myself until I forced myself to sit up. There was no time for that. With the ball of my hand pressing on my wound, I racked my brain on how to catch up with her. Was there still time? Yes. There had to be. I just had to get up and endure the pain for a couple more minutes. I took a deep breath, then another one as I prepared to get up. My gaze shifted to the side and with my hand on the tree I got stuck in the motion. On the path we’d come from, stood John. 

His house was behind him with the door open wide, and he held his gun in his hand. It reflected in the sunlight. I slumped back down involuntarily as he approached me. His expression made me gasp in a breath. A perfectly neutral face with only his eyes narrowed slightly, but it told me everything I needed to know. I wasn’t given an opportunity to speak, nor to move away. My legs moved out of instinct, trying to push myself away and reminding me of the deep pain. John closed the gap between us and stood over me, kneeling down and trapping me between his legs.

“Where is she?”

I stammered something without getting any actual words out, trying to avoid locking eyes with the gun, and eventually pointed in the direction she’d run. He acknowledged it without looking, never letting me out of his sight. He was waiting for more. An explanation as to why he shouldn’t kill me on the spot

“S-she was trying to kill me!” I propped myself up on my elbows. “I-I don’t know how she got out, maybe the door was unlocked - I don’t know! I was trying to catch her and then she shot me-” I could tell that he didn’t believe me entirely. I accidentally looked at the gun. His finger was resting on the trigger, twitching, stroking against it as he waited. That look in his eyes intensified when I looked back at him. “Fuck- *John*, why would I let her out?! You think I wanna go to jail? Come on!” I begged, grabbing onto the fabric of his jeans.

John rolled his eyes and looked past me with a sneer, then looked back at me and kicked my hand off. “We'll talk about this later.” He hissed, jabbing my shoulder with the gun and running off in the direction I'd pointed.

Despite the warning tone, I breathed out a relieved sigh that I didn't end with a bullet in my head. Had he wanted to, he would’ve killed me now. *‘We’ll talk later’* meant a black eye, but not death. I watched him sprint into the woods and soon disappear behind the trees. I listened to the sound of John’s heavy steps on the woodland floor and convinced myself that he'd catch up with Dahlia and do what needed to be done. What he did best. He couldn't not make it. What did Dahlia have on him except a small head start and a gun she was holding for the first time? She was as good as dead. The thought crossed my mind easily and didn’t leave any trace of guilt.

I tried to get up again. The makeshift gauze wouldn’t work in the long run. I had a med kit in my car somewhere. It was close enough to where I could limp over and properly stop the bleeding until we could get a professional look at it. I finally heaved myself up and stumbled over to my car when I suddenly heard a gunshot off in the distance. I glanced in its direction and sighed in relief. My body didn’t hurt as much anymore, I felt lighter. The biggest problem was taken care of. Now I just had to come up with a way to appease John when he came back.

Another gunshot rang through the woods and made me stop again. A third followed. They were sporadic. A terrible thought nestled itself in my mind, that the gunshots hadn’t been John’s, but that Dahlia had shot him instead. I didn’t believe that she could, but what if? What if she had somehow managed to escape death himself. I had underestimated her before, and it got me shot in the leg. I should’ve been used to John dying by now, but I didn’t know if he’d come back if he didn’t die by my hand. Something told me he wouldn’t.

Fuelled with another surge of adrenaline, I ran down the path the other two had taken. The pain was there but got replaced by a much more prominent burning in my lungs. Another shot, louder, somewhere off to my right and a moment later I stumbled upon John and Dahlia. I caught them in the middle of a struggle, with Dahlia aiming the gun at John. His was nowhere to be found. How had she managed that? She hadn’t noticed me right away. This time, I succeeded in disarming her and pushing her to the ground. She realized who had tackled her later than I would’ve expected, and from the way she was looking at me, I knew that she didn’t remember shooting me. Her expression was filled with surprise, confusion and fear at the force with which I held her down. It was so easy to feel bad for her, and for a moment I did.

“Wait, Tommy-...” She tried, her lamb eyes darting to John, a message meant only for me. She was trying to play innocent like before. If I hadn’t known, I would’ve taken care of John here, and then she would’ve stabbed me in my back. Recalling that made me shake off any hesitance. When she realized that I refused to catch on, she tried lunging for the gun. 

I barely managed to grab her hair and pull her back. With a scream of pain, her hands shot up to punch and push at my body. Her elbow connected with my cheek, not enough to push me off her. I readjusted my grasp, winding my hand around her neck, and found enough leverage to submerge her head in the stream beside us.

I don’t know how long she thrashed beneath me. How long she actually managed to claw at my neck and draw blood, no matter how much I craned it to get away. I only knew it took a long time until her struggle started to die down. Until her fingernails only left small white scratches and her fight became less focused. Weak fists tried to beat against my chest and her legs managed a kick or two, fuelled by a last determined spurt. Or maybe it was a purely instinctive movement, the body acting on its own. I could shrug the hands off with enough force. They fell slowly, ghosting down my chest and finding their momentary grasp at my waist before falling into the grass. I don’t know how long I had stayed in this position, but once John’s hands joined mine in the water and guided them out by my wrists, my fingertips were short of turning pruney. I hadn’t heard him come closer, I hadn’t heard anything until now. John snapped his fingers in front of my face, making me look at him.

“Tommy! Hey, Tommy!” 

I finally nodded. He looked at Dahlia's corpse and I tensed with the realization of what I had done. I was responsible for him not getting what he wanted anymore. 

“Oh God… I…”

“No,” he muttered under his breath, raising a hand in a dismissive manner. “She tried to kill you, she was trying to kill me - you did what you had to do, okay?” I dumbly stared at his calm tone, not back in reality just yet. I slid off Dahlia’s waist, slumping on the leg that wasn't injured. “Can you walk?”

He didn't wait for a reply as he helped me to my feet. I clung to him, feeling like I was about to faint.

“What about…?” I glanced back down at the half submerged girl. Distorted by the stream and animated by the current, her face changed expression and shape as if alive.

“Nobody comes here, I'll take care of her later.”

John drove me to the hospital and did the talking for me, telling the nurses that we had gotten into a hunting accident. The scratches on my neck were from my cat, he explained, and I agreed with him. My pain became manageable with some antibiotics, and despite the strain I had put on my leg, the bullet had missed any bones or important nerves. There were barely any complications. In that time, neither John nor I spoke about the incident, but he didn’t leave my side. He waited until I was out of the ER, discharged after a couple of hours with instructions on wound care and medication. I still wasn’t completely convinced that he wasn’t upset, feeling a bit of unease at the idea of getting into a car with him, but I figured he wouldn’t have bothered driving me to the hospital if he was. He held none of the falsely sweet tone that I knew meant trouble in his voice.

“If I had killed you,” I began during our quiet car ride home. I was sitting comfortably in the passenger seat while John drove and hummed along to the radio. Dazed from the painkillers and everything that had happened before, I was fighting the urge to doze off with my head against the window. “Instead of Dahlia, I mean, back there. Would you have been mad?”

John pursed his lips. “Bummed out, probably.” 

“Be serious.” The whole ordeal wasn't even a day old and he was already back to his usual, joking manner. I shot him a glare.

He lost the smirk, I saw him rolling his eyes playfully before adapting a more serious tone. “Yeah, I would've been pissed.”

“Very?”

“You wouldn't be?”

“I don't know.”

He looked my way and I saw him smile again. “You shouldn't worry about that. Really, it’s stupid. I don't think you could kill me anyways. No offense.”

“...yeah, I don't think I could.” I muttered. I was contemplating whether I should ask what was on my mind. “Are you mad at what happened?”

His smile faltered for a moment. John shrugged. “At first I was but…” He tapped his fingers on the steering wheel. “Whatever, it got kinda monotonous anyways. It was fun while it lasted, but if you hadn't done it, I would've. ‘Sides, the bitch tried to shoot me. And she shot you.” I was surprised how well he'd taken it. He said it without a hint of malice, as if I had dropped his favorite mug and nothing more. His smile came back. “I can get another one. Maybe two this time, so you can-”

“Don't even start.” I hissed. A long moment followed in which John’s laugh died down and I stared at the trees passing by. I intertwined my fingers, squeezing, pressing my nail into my palm. “Do you think Dahlia is mad at me?”

“I think she’s dead, dude.” He patted my thigh, careful not to put too much pressure. “Don’t think about that now. It won’t do you any good.”

I gave up trying to have any meaningful conversation with him. The rest of the drive was long enough for me to pass out. I was nudged awake by John.

“Hey, sleeping beauty,” He said with a light melody to his tone. “We’re home.”

I groggily got out of the car and John helped me stand when he saw I’d forgotten about my injury. As we walked back to his house, I was gripped with a sudden unease. What if, when I opened the door, Dahlia would be waiting for me? Just sitting on the couch, reading her book, and John would forget everything we'd talked about in the car. I inhaled deeply, but it became more shallow by the second. What if nothing had cursed John? What if it was me? Cursed with the inability to kill, which somehow became a problem. What was wrong with me? I stopped dead in my tracks. John looked at me with confusion.

“What is it?”

“I don’t- I can’t go in there.”

“Why?” I just stood by the railing of his porch, shaking my head. John sighed. “Come on,” He grabbed my arm again. “You're still all tense from before, you gotta go sleep it off.”

“Can you open the door?”

John raised a brow and glanced at the door over his shoulder. He walked over to it and did as I asked, looking at me expectantly. I slowly limped closer, glancing inside. I could see the living room, parts of the kitchen. No Dahlia, at least not there.

“Just go inside-” I shushed him, taking a moment before finally going inside. It was comfortably warm inside. I could make out a subtle metallic smell, but aside from that, everything was normal. John closed the door behind us. “Was it that hard?”

I didn’t respond, instead passing the couch and gently pushing the guest room door open. Typical, unmade sheets. I presumed that’s how I left them, though I still couldn’t remember many details from this morning. Dahlia wasn’t here, but then again, she never had much of a reason to be in the guest room.

“Can I lay down on your bed?” I asked John who was taking off his shoes by the front door. “It’s… better on my back.” 

He saw through my excuse, but humored my request nevertheless. “Sure.”

I trudged down the hall, pushing each door open and peering inside just for a moment. John must've seen it, but thankfully decided not to comment. With every door I opened, my anxiety started to die down. I briefly considered letting down the attic ladder, but decided against it. With all rooms investigated except for John's bedroom, I entered. Dahlia was not sitting on the bed, or awaiting me in any other way. It was just me in the empty room. I ran a hand through my hair and down my face, sighing deeply. My leg thanked me when I finally sat down on the bed. Though Dahlia was gone, traces of her remained. Her books were all on her shelf, neatly organized, from the first one that I could still recount the plot of, to the most recent one of which I could barely remember the title. The small bit of property John had allowed her to own. I let myself fall back on the bed, staring up at the ceiling. Dahlia was gone, and the fantasy of her was gone too. She could've done me the favor and at least waited for John to kill us both. But now the reality was plaguing me. I wondered if she had ever meant anything she said to me. She had to. I didn't believe she could be this cruel. The Dahlia in my fantasy couldn't, but she was not real. I wondered if this could've worked out, had we met in a different situation. In a situation where my hands weren't tied and where she could fully trust me. I thought about it, and I wasn't sure if I would've wanted it in a different, more normal situation.

“The hell?!” I heard John exclaim from the kitchen. I jerked up, a cold sweat breaking out over my body, and stumbled into the kitchen.

“W-what?! What is it?” I found him standing over his own dead body. It was still slumped behind the counter. I had completely forgotten about it. I let out a relieved sigh, at which John turned to face me and I tried to compose myself again. “Oh.”

He just motioned to the body, as if asking if I was seeing it too. I nodded. “Who is that?”

“How would I know?”  
  
“The fuck is up with this house?” He groaned and looked back at his corpse. “First that blood, now this.”

“Maybe someone broke in…? And, uhm…”

John looked at me as if I was dumb, but couldn't find a better explanation either. I let him rant about it for as long as he wanted until he seemingly resigned. He told me he'd take care of it, he had to get rid of Dahlia anyways. I welcomed it, going back to his room to rest. In my half-sleep I listened to him curse under his breath. It was his turn now to look through the house, including the attic and basement. Maybe I had gotten the hang of it, but it took him longer than expected to get his body ready for transport. 

“I'm off!” He called. I got out of bed and followed him to his car. He regarded me with surprise. “Don’t you gotta rest?”

“I wanna come with you. It feels disrespectful not to.”

“Alright.” He scoffed. With Dahlia’s and John’s corpses already loaded up, we drove out of the woods and headed down the road to the clearing. I didn't know if there was room for two more bodies, but objecting would have seemed weird. I listened to him talk about his own body again, how heavy it had been and how similar he looked, though he couldn’t put his finger on it, until he finally stopped the car amongst the trees. The clearing was in front of us. An outsider wouldn't have noticed, but I recognized all the semi-lose ground all around us. “You gonna help me dig?”

“With my wound?”

“So you really just came along to bum around, huh?” He rolled his eyes and got out.

I sat leaning against a tree and watched John push the shovel into the cold ground. He had taken his jacket back from Dahlia's body, but seemed fine parting with the rest. *“It'll be fine if I just wash it, right?*” To which I just muttered a *‘yeah, sure’*, unable to hide my disgust. I told him to dig further back, in a spot I knew he wouldn't stumble on any of the previous bodies. He dug a much deeper grave than I would've, though it still was just enough to do the job.

Steadying myself against a tree, I watched him drag his own body over to the hole. It was such a weird sight, watching him throw his own corpse into the shallow grave. Then he grabbed Dahlia from his car. Much lighter than his own body, he could carry her as if she was sleeping. He dropped her on top of his body. Dahlia's body looked normal, maybe a bit pale, up until her head which had turned a bluish tint. It contrasted with her hair, still wet and clinging to her waxy skin. John extended me a cigarette and I thanked him. With his own between his lips, he grabbed the shovel again. I heard the sound of dirt hitting the bodies, starting at their legs. I couldn't look away from their faces. In the dying sunlight, it became harder and harder to properly make out their features before long shadows distorted them. I thought for a second that their eyes had moved from the unfocused position to staring right at me. Before I could even startle, a heap of dirt landed on their faces and sealed them away once and for all. Maybe it was for the better not to dwell on it. That was it. No more Dahlia and no more dead Johns. I vowed to myself that this would be the last of John's bodies I would have to bury. We stayed for a bit, or at least I stalled our departure until John nudged me out of my thoughts.

“I'm starving.”

“Right.” I looked up from the ground, John already going back to the car.

The radio miraculously caught a signal and John turned it up loud enough to serve as a substitute for smalltalk. It was fine by me. I closed my eyes, listening to the song and finding a calmness within me that I was unfamiliar with. I felt like whatever had been sitting on my chest had finally gotten off me, hit by John’s car and left as roadkill on the cracked pavement. I felt like I could breathe for the first time in weeks, and I felt every single breath deep in my chest. No anxiety, no stomach ache when I saw the trees part to expose the solitary house in the woods.
