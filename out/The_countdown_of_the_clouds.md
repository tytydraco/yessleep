I have always been fascinated by the sky. The way the clouds move and shift, the colors they can turn during sunrise and sunset, and the shapes they can form. But something strange has been happening lately. Every day when I look up at the sky, I see the clouds forming numbers. 

It started about a week ago. I was walking to work, admiring the clouds as usual when I noticed something different. At first, I thought it was just my imagination, but as I kept staring, the numbers became more and more clear. They were counting down from 10. 

I tried to brush it off as a strange coincidence. Maybe it was just a weird formation of clouds that happened to look like numbers. But the next day, the clouds formed a 9. And the day after that, an 8. 

I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. I started to become obsessed with the countdown. Every day, I would watch the sky, waiting for the numbers to appear. I tried to tell my coworkers and friends about it, but they just shrugged it off as me being paranoid. 

As the days went on, the countdown continued. 7, 6, 5, 4. I couldn't help but feel a sense of dread with each passing day. What was going to happen when the countdown reached 0? 

I started to do research, trying to find any information on strange cloud formations or countdowns in the sky. But I couldn't find anything that matched what I was seeing. 

One day, I decided to take a day off from work and spend the whole day watching the sky. The numbers started to form at around noon. 3, 2, 1. My heart was pounding in my chest as I watched the last number form. 

And then, the sky went dark. It was as if a thick cloud had covered the entire city. I couldn't see anything except for a faint red glow in the distance. 

I knew then that something terrible was happening. I tried to call my friends and family, but none of my calls went through. The city was completely cut off from the outside world. 

I spent the next few days holed up in my apartment, trying to make sense of what was happening. I could hear screams and gunshots outside, but I was too afraid to leave my apartment. 

And then, the clouds started to form numbers again. But this time, they were counting up. 1, 2, 3, 4. I couldn't believe it. Was there some kind of reset happening? 

I knew I had to find out. I gathered whatever supplies I could find and set out into the city. It was a warzone. Buildings were destroyed, cars were flipped over, and there were bodies everywhere. 

I walked for what felt like hours until I reached the source of the red glow. It was a massive portal, hovering in the air. And then, I saw them. Creatures pouring out of the portal. They were unlike anything I had ever seen before. 

They were tall and thin, with elongated limbs and sharp teeth. They moved with an otherworldly grace, their eyes glowing a sickly green. They were killing everything in their path. 

I knew then that the countdown was a warning. A warning of the impending invasion. And now, the countdown was counting up to the complete takeover of our world. 

I knew I had to do something. I couldn't let these creatures destroy everything I had ever known. I reached into my backpack and pulled out a homemade explosive. I had no idea if it would work, but it was better than doing nothing. 

I ran towards the portal, dodging the creatures as best I could. I could feel their hot breath on my neck, their claws scraping against my skin. But I kept running. 

I threw the explosive into the portal and ran as fast as I could. The explosion was deafening, and I was thrown backward by the force of it. 

When I opened my eyes, I was back in my apartment. The sky was clear, and the sun was shining. It was as if nothing had ever happened. 

But I knew it wasn't over. The countdown had stopped at 4, but I had a feeling it was only a matter of time before it started again. And when it did, I would be ready. 

I had seen the end of the world, and it was terrifying. But I would do whatever it takes to prevent it from happening again.
