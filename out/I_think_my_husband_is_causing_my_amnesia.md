Hi, everyone. I need to tell someone what's happening to me. I'm terrified, and I don’t know what else to do. I don't have much time. Please bear with me.

My name is Melanie Tierney.

I live in St. Louis, MO. 8520 Nottingham Estates. Our house has a red door.

My days are routine.

I wake up, turn to my right, and reach for my husband, Mark. He’s always there, smiling at me. He tells me I have anterograde and retrograde amnesia. That I can't form new memories or remember my old ones. He says it gently, like he’s said it a thousand times before. I trust him.

He shows me pictures of us smiling, traveling, being happy. He shows me old love letters, ticket stubs from trips to the Oregon Coast, handwritten notes stuck to the fridge. Everything is supposed to remind me that my life is real, that Mark loves me.

He keeps me on a strict routine to help me stay stable. To remind me who I am and where I am. Two red pills in the morning, two blue pills at night.

Every morning, he goes over the basics as I take the red pills.

"You're Melanie Tierney. I'm Mark Tierney. We live here, together. You had an accident three years ago."

The accident is vague in my mind, a blur of flashing lights and pain that I’ve never quite been able to visualize. I don’t know if it’s because of my supposed condition or something else, but Mark says not to worry about it. He says some things are better left forgotten.

But lately, something feels wrong.

Two days ago, I saw Mark's phone light up before he quickly shoved it into his pocket.

It was a weird sight. He's usually so composed, so calm. It made me incredibly uneasy. I caught a glimpse of the message though.

**patient doesn't expect anything<>...?**

My heart dropped.

Patient? Was that me? Why was I a patient?

I wanted to ask him, but I stayed quiet. I didn’t want to risk a confrontation. Instead, I smiled at him, as if nothing happened, and we went about our day. The mall, dinner at his sister's, just as planned.

But I couldn’t let it go.

I journaled that night, writing down everything I could remember from the day and my suspicions. I hid it under a loose floorboard in the closet, a place I was certain Mark wouldn’t find. A place I knew future me one day would stub her toe and take a closer look.

This was my backup plan.

My main plan was this...

I snuck into our bathroom and used a private browser on my phone to look up the medications. I looked at the red and blue pills in the medicine cabinet. There were no markings on them, no brand names, nothing.

I read about different types of drugs, and one thing that kept coming up was that high doses of certain medications, like benzodiazepines, could cause memory loss.

I felt fear grip me in a way that I hadn’t experienced before.

Was Mark lying to me? Was he giving me something to keep me like this? The trust I had in him began to unravel. I started to see things differently. His reassuring words, his gentle touch, the way he always seemed to be watching me, just a little too closely.

Who is Mark? Who am I?

The photos in the living room. Us smiling at the Cannon Beach, our wedding in the garden. They suddenly felt wrong. The woman in those photos was me, but she also wasn’t. I stared at myself in the mirror, and I realized I didn’t recognize the woman looking back at me. The lines of her face, the way her eyes looked dull, the lifeless expression. It wasn’t who I imagined myself to be. It scared me.

I decided I had to know the truth.

That night, I pretended to take the blue pills. I swallowed water, but the pills never left my hand. When Mark turned away, I tossed them into the toilet, flushed them away, and hoped he wouldn’t notice.

The next morning, I woke up, and the world felt different.

It was like stepping out of a thick fog for the first time in years. Everything was clearer. Sharper. And with that clarity came a deep, bone-chilling terror. My name isn’t Melanie. I didn’t know who I was, but I knew I wasn’t Melanie Tierney, and I knew Mark wasn’t my husband. The accident he always talked about. The one that left me like this. I didn’t think it ever happened.

I needed answers.

But I was stupid. I confronted Mark too early.

I told him I didn’t believe him anymore. He didn’t look surprised. He looked… cold. His face changed, his smile vanishing. He just stared at me, and then he said I was confused, that I needed my medication.

He spoke calmly, but there was something in his eyes. Something dangerous. He tried to gaslight me, to make me doubt myself. He reached for the pills, and I backed away, pretending to calm down. I knew that if I pushed too hard, he’d force me to take them. I needed to be smart about this.

I apologized and pretended to take the pills. That I was just being hormonal.

He accepted my apology.

The next day, after Mark went to work, I searched the house.

I needed proof.

I remembered a safe he kept locked in the study. I’d seen him open it before, but I didn’t know the combination. I found a drill in the shed, and after what felt like hours, I managed to force it open. Inside, there were documents, stacks of cash, and at the bottom, a patient file with my photo. But it wasn’t Melanie Tierney’s photo. It was a photo of a younger me, and the name on the file was Beth Swanson.

Panic surged through me as I flipped through the pages of the file.

There were medical records, observations, notes about my behavior. I don’t know who Beth Swanson is, but I know she isn’t Melanie, and she definitely isn’t Mark’s wife. There were notes about "conditioning" and "maintaining compliance." I felt like I was going to be sick.

Then I heard the door open. Mark was home early.

I scrambled to hide the file, but it was too late. He saw it.

His face changed in an instant, his eyes narrowing as he stepped towards me. I tried to back away, but he was too fast. He grabbed my arm, his grip like iron, and forced the pills into my mouth. He screamed and screamed that I needed to swallow, that everything would be fine once I did. I didn’t have a choice. I swallowed them, the bitter taste lingering in my mouth.

He then ran downstairs, as if there was some fire downstairs.

I know I have 10 minutes, maybe less, before the pills kick in, before everything goes foggy again.

That’s why I’m writing this now.

I don’t know how much time I have left before I forget all of this. Please, if anyone knows anything or has been through something like this, tell me. I need someone to know. I need someone to understand that I’m not crazy. That there’s something very wrong here.

My life is replaying in my mind rapidly.

I keep thinking about the little things now. Things that didn’t seem important before. Like how Mark never lets me answer the door when someone knocks. He always tells me to stay put, that he’ll handle it. Or the way he’s always so careful about what I eat, what I drink. He says it’s for my health, but now I wonder if it’s just another way to keep me under his control. And the people we see, his sister, his friends... they all seem to look at me strangely, like they know something I don’t. Like they’re in on it too.

I’m scared I’m running out of time.

I just hope that I stub my toe soon and can start again. I need a better plan.
