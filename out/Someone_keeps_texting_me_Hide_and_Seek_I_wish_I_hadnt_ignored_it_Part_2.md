[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1km2s1j/someone_keeps_texting_me_hide_and_seek_i_wish_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

I had no idea what to do, or where to go after I sent the response. I certainly was not going to try and hide again, but I panicked at first, after sending the one word reply,

“Seek.”

I thought I had made a huge mistake. I figured maybe there was some bizarre time limit or trick to the game and if I did not find whoever I was looking for in time, they would show up and take me away just like Mike.

Before that message came, I was planning on going to the police and having Mike declared missing. I thought maybe someone could explain what happened or know where to look. But the more I considered it, the crazier it sounded. If anyone could help me find him it would be great, but I was also afraid of what else I might find. On top of that, I could not shake the sinking feeling that searching for whatever took him was a bad idea. Then the message came, and I answered.

At first, I just fumbled around in a tense state of paranoia in my apartment. Yet after several minutes of searching, I found no trace. There was nothing to indicate that the entity that was in home before, was there now. No weird power outages, no terrible stench. The horrific calling cards of that nightmarish presence were all absent. I started worrying about some implicit time limit again. Then my phone buzzed and I saw I had received another strange message from no number,

“You know all the hiding spots in your home........let’s play somewhere else.........727 Cherry St.........more fun there :)”

Despite the ominous message, I had an address now. Though an actual location made the next part feel terribly real. Worse still, it meant that I had no excuse to not go and look. I thought for a moment of just leaving. I considered if I left it might go after someone else. I hated to admit it, but I did not have a strong moral compulsion to save Mike. He was a bad roommate and kind of a dick.

But I remembered the sound of his scream as whatever was hunting us found him. I remembered how he had lost “Hide and seek”. I did feel compelled to do something, despite my fear. No one deserved that fate, whatever happened to him. Even if it was a remote chance to find him I would take it, better still if I saved myself in the process. Maybe if I won the game, whoever, or whatever was messaging me, would leave me alone.

I looked up the address in my phone and saw it was a real place and not too far away from my apartment. I started for the door, but before I left, I went to Mike’s room. I grabbed the footlocker in his closest. I opened the case and recovered the handgun I knew he owned. If I did find some psychopath or monster where I was going, at least I would be armed.

I ran outside hopped in my car and in the next five minutes I was on Cherry street looking for the right number. I was not very familiar with the place, but the section I needed to check was not too large.

As I drove through, I saw the entire neighborhood was in a bad way. It never really recovered from the recession and a lot of houses were unoccupied. I finally found 727 and the place was a derelict. It looked condemned and many windows were either broken or boarded up and the whole place looked like it was falling apart.

I pushed past tons of encroaching blackberry bushes on the cracked steps leading to the front door. There were notifications all along the front of the house warning people to stay out. I knew no one could be living there in the state it was in, yet I got a strange feeling when I stood in front of the door. I knew this was the right address, so I stepped up to the crumbling edifice and reached for the handle.

It was unlocked and the door swung open on painfully loud rusty hinges, giving it the charmingly terrible sound of a proper haunted house. I was second guessing my decision almost immediately and I considered turning back again, but another message arrived.

“Hurry up....or you are going to lose.....9 minutes left......”

I did not like what losing implied and I turned on my flashlight and started fumbling through the dust choked house. I was not sure if I should bother calling out to see if Mike was there, or if it would just give away my position and allow for whatever was hiding in there to move to another spot. I had less than ten minutes to play a real game of hide and seek, so I moved along as fast as I could. I gripped the handle of the gun so tightly my fingers hurt as I looked around the dark house. Whatever was there, if I found it, I was not going to let it try and start another game.

Two minutes had passed and I knew my time was ticking down. I could barely see even with the flashlight and since the power was out none of the interior lights would work.

I had cleared most of the living room and the closets in the downstairs hall. I opened a door and saw stairs leading down to a basement. I was about to head downstairs when I recieved another message,

“Colder.....try harder.......running out of time.....”

I shut the door and took a step back, closing my eyes and trying to focus on searching and not the looming dread of the time ticking down. Suddenly I caught the scent of a familiar, terrible stench wafting from upstairs. I turned and walked to the base of the stairs, and I felt a terrible pressure in my head and heard another notification.

“Warmer.....”

I swallowed hard and forced myself to ascend the stairs. I had to hold back the urge to gag at the stench coming from somewhere up there. I did not like the idea, but I figured I would follow the fetid odor and see if it would help me locate my target.

I moved slowly to a bedroom at the end of the hall and had to pull my shirt up over my face to keep the worst of the smell out. I had a strong feeling I was close, so I summoned my courage and rushed inside. When I shined the meager light into the room I thought I was going to be sick. It was dozens of rotting bodies, moldering on the floor in various states of decomposition. I retched and almost threw up on the floor as I reeled from the sight. As I recovered, I looked around and saw even more carcasses and I realized in horror that there were at least twenty of them, at least that I could see.

Near the center my light landed on a familiar face and to my horror I realized I found him. Not the hidden horror I was seeking, but Mike, or rather what was left of him. Mike looked strangely emaciated, like despite only being gone for a few days, he looked as if he had somehow starved to death. He was sickly pale and I realized that despite the dismembered bodies all around, his body and the others were absent of any large amounts of congealed blood. It was like something had drained them all. My horrified stupor was broken when another message arrived.

“Colder.......but hey look, you found the losers.......3 minutes left and then it’s my turn.....”

I panicked and started scrambling into the other rooms, throwing doors open and looking under rotting furniture and in every conceivable hiding place. I had around two minutes left before I was out of time.

When I stumbled into the last room I hadn't checked yet, the light of my phone went out and I knew it had to be there. One last message splashed on the screen before my phone died.

“Hot as fire......no more hints.......good luck.”

Despite the message indicating I was close, the room itself felt freezing. There was a more subtle fetor of decay lingering in the air.  I was almost out of time and terrified, it felt just like the last incident. The dark, the chill, the smell, the same suffocating presence. I knew it was there.

I was blind and fumbling in the dark. I tried to focus. I felt around the small room which might have been another bedroom. I bumped into what felt like a bed and paused when I thought I heard a raspy breath coming from somewhere in the room with me.

I took a deep breath and reached into my pocket for a secondary light source. I knew the light wouldn't work this close, but I had brought a lighter in hopes it could not extinguish flames. I flicked it on and the faint glow of the flickering flame brought dim illumination to the room.

I heard something like a startled gurgle and a gasp, like someone trying to hold their breath, but releasing a death rattle instead. I had been trying to countdown the seconds while I searched, and by my count I had less than thirty left. I threw the closet door open and there was nothing there.

Twenty seconds left.

I threw open the doors of a crumbling armoire, no one inside.

Ten seconds left.

Then it came to me, the last place to look in the room. I bent down, held my breath and looked under the bed. When I saw two glowing eyes staring back at me and a strange glowing smile growing on the things face, I had seen enough. I screamed, fell down on my side and emptied the entire magazine of the pistol into the demonic visage.

My heart was racing, my ears were ringing. Yet there was no sound after that. The room grew warmer, the smell began to dissipate and my phone came back to life after a minute or two. I held my breath and turned my flashlight back on and aimed it under the bed and to my horror I saw.....nothing.

There was nothing there, no body, no blood, no trace of anything. I stood up and was confused and terrified, I had no idea where it had gone. I looked at the other side of the room just to check and I did not see any marks on the wall where the rounds I had fired should have hit. Something stopped them, but it was no longer there.

I sat for a while, alone and confused in that charnel house, until I received another message,

“You won.....good job :)”

I was stunned and unable to do anything but just stare at the message in a confused stupor for a while. I could not understand just what the hell sort of game I had been drawn into and what the thing was that was playing with me. It seemed like I was safe for the time being. I had a morbid responsibility now to see what to do about the room of rotting victims that the thing had referred to as the losers of it's previous games.

When I walked closer to the room at the end of the other hall, I was surprised when it did not smell nearly as strong as it had before. I had my phone out and was ready to dial 911 to call for help, but the phone dropped from my hand when I entered the room.

To my shock and disbelief, every single body was gone now. Each one of the desiccated corpses had vanished, no trace left beyond a faint lingering smell of decay in the air.

Unable to process what I had experienced and unable to do anything further about it, I returned home. Once again I was left with the horrible aftermath of the game and no evidence of anything having happened beyond my own word and the disappearance of my roommate.

I wish that was the end of my story, if that was where it had ended I suppose I would have been content. But something happened that has made me regret ever telling anyone about this horrible game. I received another message last night and now I know the game does not end with me. That thing, whatever it is will always find someone to play with and now I fear I have made a huge mistake.

The message was,

“Do you think your friends would want to play as well?.......perhaps when they are done reading about the fun we had? I wonder if they will want to hide or seek?”

I must apologize now, I am so sorry. I just wanted to warn people about it, but now it is too late. Now It knows I have told others about it. It is searching for a new playmate and if you receive a message from a non existent number asking you to play Hide and seek. Well all I can say is that I am sorry and I hope you will be as lucky as I was, to survive.
