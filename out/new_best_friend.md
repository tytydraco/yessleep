i was just making dinner, when i heard my daughter talking to someone. it wasnt the kind of talking she would do when she was playing house with her barbies, it sounded like an actual conversation. i turned off the stove and went up to check up on her, i opened her door, but saw nothing unusual, kinda. she was showing her barbies, to the air? i asked her who she was taling to.

Darcy turned around to face me and smiled. "im showing my barbies to anne!" she said enthusiastically.

"whos anne?" i asked, leaning on her doorframe.

"shes my new friend, shes waving to you!" darcy laughed and looked at the place where, i suppose, anne was sitting.

i smiled and waved back. "well alright then, clean up your dolls, dinners in a few minutes"

i left her room and closed her door. in the meantime, my husband came home. right in time for dinner. as we all sat down to the table, darcy kept on talking about anne. 

"less speaking, more eating" michael looked up to darcy

darcy chuckled, and it was quiet for the rest of the dinner. 

after dinner, michael offered to help darcy take a bath, so i could get her bed ready for sleeping. i went into her room and accidentally stepped on one of the barbies. i put it in place and got her bed ready. just as darcy and michael came in, i told darcy about the barbie.

"but i cleaned it up like you told me to" darcy said confused

"are you sure? im pretty sure that clean, doesnt mean in the middle of the room" i told her

she just stood there for a while looking into the ground. "it was anne" she said quietly.

"darcy, im sure anne didnt do it. just make sure to clean it up next time" michael said.

"but it really was a-"

"darcy, come here. do you want me to read you a bedtime story" i cut her off before she could finish her sentence.

"no thank you" darcy replied, sounding angry.

i kissed her goodnight and walked out of the room. later that night, i woke up out of nowhere, feeling the need to go check up on darcy. her door was creaked opened, even though i remember i closed it. i got a sense of unease. i quietly opened the door to see darcy, quietly sleeping. i was calm for a second, but them i saw her closet, it was opened, my heart skipped a beat as i walked closer to it. but there was nothing unusual about it. i figured darcy mustve opened it, for whatever reason. i closed her door and went back to our bedroom.

"Judith, are you okay?" i heard michaels sleepy voice from the other side of the bed.

"im fine, just went to the bathroom" i replied

"oh, alright, goodnight then" michael yawned and went back to sleep. 

i couldnt stop thinking about it. i kept staring at the wall until i heard my alarm clock go off. i immediately got up to wake up darcy. everything was how i left it, but i still felt like something was off. i woke up darcy, she looked up at me, still sleepy, and then got up from her bed. i took her to school today, she sat down in the car and yawned. the ride was quiet, usually when i take her to school, she talks the whole time. 

"anne slept with me today" she broke the silence

"what do you mean, sweetheart?"
i asked her

"she laid beside me, because she didnt like the closet anymore" she said

i kinda froze, and my heart started beating faster.

"the closet?" i asked

"yeah, she said it was uncomfortable"

i was quiet. for the rest of the ride neither of us said anything. i dropped her off, kissed her goodbye and headed to work. i kept thinking about it. but then figured she might have opened the closet herself, because she wanted it to seem more real. i didnt believe it a bit, but i had to calm myself down. i realized i had forgotten my wallet at home, which had my card in it. so i headed home so i could pick it up before work. i unlocked the door, got my card, and was ready to get out, when i heard something fall upstairs.

instead of just leaving, like a normal person would, i decided to investigate. i went up the stairs and saw my daughters rooms door creaked open again. my heart was beating so fast i could feel it trying to escape my chest. i opened the door, but nothing was there, except for a few barbies laying on the floor, even though they were in her toy box right before we left. i quickly turned around and ran out of the house. i got in my car and drive to work

i sat on my desk, staring at the computer screen for what felt like hours, when i got a call from michael

"judith? darcy broke her arm"

"what do you mean, she broke her arm? how?"

"she fell on her hand from the slide. apparently anne made her do it, i think we should have a little chat with darcy when you come home." michael said, sounding worried.

"anne made her do it?"

"yeah, she said something about anne telling her to jump off, as a punishment for telling on her about the barbies"

i didnt answer for good 10 seconds until michael started talking again

"im taking her to the ER, not coming back to work, try to come home as soon as possible"

"ill try michael, call me if something happens" i hung up and i couldnt believe what i just heard. im typing this at work, im  gonna have to talk to darcy about anne, but im so scared. i may update if something happens, i hope it wont be necessary.
