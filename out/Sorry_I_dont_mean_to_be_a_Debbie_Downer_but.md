Hello. I’ll make this, or, try to make this brief. My daughter won’t leave her room anymore. She tells us nothing.

Sorry to have ‘bad rizz’ or ‘bring the vibes down’. I say that all the time to my Facebook group and they all laugh. I love that youth slang. I don’t know how to do the face Emoticons but it’s all part of that language.

It’s hard to express yourself in words on a page. Words don’t convey.  

No, my other daughter is no longer with us.

Does anyone remember Lavender Town? It was from that Game Boy cartridge from the Computer. It had a melody slick as shears. I remember hearing it from a Video on the Internet. I won’t tell you the gruesome ways it burrowed itself into children’s brains, making them leave their already short lives.  It was everywhere on the Internet.

My daughter was almost beautiful, not like me but like my own mother. Not like her family. I treated her right, I let her be herself. I tried to let her be herself but she kept forcing my hand.

I still blame her father. Once, my husband. The Computer Games he played, not Solitaire but violent, gory, vehement.

My Facebook group began to mutiny. Words failed me. I tried to communicate; lmao and lol means laughing and those cute Emojis, the one with the rather rapturous looking grin with its tongue sticking out. 

They were never laughing with me.

My other daughter, it hurts to mention her. 

After she left this world selfishly, I poured for answers. Her tablet device gave more questions. I fingered my way through the dark crevices of Message Boards and Texts.

Hate and words. Words I tried to decipher like a scribe. I tried. Sentences that meant nothing to me yet incited other Messages on the Message Boards. She spent so many nights with her father over the Computer. All the vile things they must have shared about me, blasphemous in dodging the irony as they played violent Shooting Games. 

A few months later, he decided to join her in Hell.

My man who deflowered me. 

Man to no one, a fatherless creature. I am glad he won’t see my little girl grow up.

I think I get the youth slang now. It is hard to convey words, to reach other people on this Internet. But you can congregate, not like at a church, but like cavemen, uttering primal grunts.

I hum that silly song with a solemn defiance. It is just music, but it reminds me of how far I’ve come. The Internet is an ocean of noise. I am the ark that sails across it. Now, I can face my daughter. 

 I can go down to the basement, looking at her perfect figure. 

 When I hug her I feel the bones of her redeemed body. I see recognition in her eyes. 

 Not yet as she hesitates to hold my hand, but maybe one day I will loosen her shackles.
