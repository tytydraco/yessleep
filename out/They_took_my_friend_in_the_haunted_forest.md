We didn’t mean to go to a haunted forest. We just wanted to spend some time in the woods. 

Connor and Claudia were my closest mates at university, and nothing strange ever happened when we went out together. We were normal students.

Connor was the only one that drove. He pulled up a forest near our town on Google Maps, shrugged, and said
“Half an hour. We can chill in the woods as the sun sets.” 

We got ready and left after classes around 6 pm that November evening. The drive passed like any other; conversation, jokes, the usual.

When we arrived, the gravel car park led to a narrow path. At the end of it stood a bridge. It was red‑grey and streaked with rust, looking over part of the town and the water before the trees swallowed the forest ahead. 

Something about it made my chest tighten, a subtle weight in the air I couldn’t explain. It wasn’t broken or obviously dangerous. It just… felt wrong.

We stood at the bridge. It was a red‑grey colour, looking over part of the town and the water, then the forest up ahead. 

This bridge slowly filled my head with darkness like a demonic possession. While we were taking in the view, smoking cigarettes, I couldn’t help but obsess over thoughts I’ve never really had before.

I knew this is just an intrusive thought. But that’s not like me, not really. I then started thinking about what if I accidentally fell off the bridge into the cold dark water below. 

The bridge looked so rusty and old, like it could fall at any moment. It stunk of iron and rust, a slimy combination of rotting metals. But it looked normal. It wasn’t a gut feeling to leave; it was inviting. It made me want to head into the forest out of curiosity 

So we began wandering into the forest, on the path. However, within moments of leaving the bridge and entering the forest, the sun set, and it became pitch black in what felt like seconds.

Connor said to us,
“How did we miss the sunset?”

Claudia replied,
“Guys, I’ll be honest, this place is kind of eerie. I don’t like how dark it is. We could get lost. I think after we should just head back.”

I didn’t want to sound scared, but I quickly responded,
“Yeah, we can stay for a bit then we can go for a drive after. I’m playing my music this time too.”

I wanted to sound calm, but I just wanted to leave. Connor had driven all this way, and he seemed alright.

Then we got lost. The paths kept leading to what felt like nowhere. It was pitch black, so we were using our phone flashlights to guide the way. What happened next, I can’t explain. 

We began to hear screaming. Faint screams in the distance, all around us. We were all spooked. Connor’s composure broke.

“Do you hear that sound or am I going crazy?”

Claudia and I replied, talking over each other,
“I heard that too.”
“I can still hear it. Do you think it’s animals?”

Connor replied,
“Probably, like deer or pigs or farm animals, I guess. There’s gotta be other people in these woods too. They’re probably messing about.”

As soon as we heard the faint screams, I felt as if we were being watched. The forest looked ordinary, how you expect a forest to look. The forest looked like any forest we’d go in when we went camping as kids. 

Forests normally have a way of freaking you out. Yes, my friends and I could see shadows of figures moving, and sounds of branches breaking. But that wasn’t the issue.

The only thing wrong with the place wasn’t the shadows, the tall and short shadows creeping around, like they were ducking out of the way of our phones’ flashlights. No. 

It was the darkness I could feel, and I know they could feel it too. The sinister energy in those woods is nothing I’ve ever felt before or again.

After wandering around for what felt like hours, Connor said,
“Let’s just find a decent‑ish spot, then we’ll start walking back in the right direction.”

So we walked around a little longer until we found a clearing. I can’t explain the clearing’s peaceful energy. It just felt safe, like home. Like it wasn’t even a part of the forest. 

It felt quiet and calm. It was small, but there was enough space above between the trees to see the stars. We even spotted a shooting star. The stars were lit up like in a Star Wars movie. We could see different patterns like the belt.

We sat down in the clearing, looking at the stars and our phones to see we had no signal. We started talking about what we’d do when we drove home.

As we sat there, I could smell something really unusual. It wasn’t anything from us. This smell was more like a smell in the distance. It smelled of rotten fruit, sulphur, the smell of rotten eggs too. 

The same rusty iron at the bridge was there too. Had I not been distracted, I would’ve taken more notice of it. 

Then as I was listening to Claudia talking about her new cookbook, I realized something else. It was too quiet. The sounds of the forest were gone.

All I could hear was Claudia’s rambling and Connor breathing. It was total darkness except for the stars, which didn’t provide much light for us at all.

Then Claudia said to us,
“Guys, I’ve lost my lighter. Help me find it.”

She started patting the floor in the darkness. As we sat and patted the floor, I said,
“Bro, just put the torch on.”

“But I can’t find my phone,” she squealed.

I sighed and put on my flashlight, shining it to the floor. I only vaguely spotted something out the corner of the light projection. Then I saw it. I thought it was a tree trunk at first, but it was too close in the clearing; it was too lean. 

I curiously shined my phone torch higher and saw a figure. It was a person in a cloak only eight or nine feet away from me. 

I could only vaguely see their face, a ridiculously long beard and hair coming out, white as snow. I could see their pale cheeks, as white as their hair. Their cloak and hood were brown and red, but not a clean or new cloak. It looked like a thousand years old. The hood covered over half their face.

I quickly shot up and said,
“Look,” just to make sure they also saw this.

I had startled my friends, and they shot up too, pulling out their phone flashlights to see if it was real for themselves as well. The figure just stood there. In a panic, I said,
“Are you good?” in a kind of tough‑guy, macho, threatening way. At first, I really thought this was just some crazy guy, like a nut job on the loose. 

It was only when I saw more of the exact same cloaked figures standing behind him in the distance that I realized something was unnaturally wrong here. In our panic, we panned the phone flashlights around us, and there were dozens of them surrounding us. 

All wearing the same cloaks. Some as tall as six foot seven, and others as short as… as children. Children as young as four or five.

There must have been, I don’t know, fifty or sixty of them. All quietly standing still, watching us three surrounded in the clearing.

My friends and I were frozen still. This moment must have only been seconds but felt like hours. I think the adrenaline slows down time so every millisecond is like a minute. 

The original one I saw stepped forward a couple paces, as if to remove himself from the crowd, now only six or seven feet away from us. What he said next has haunted me ever since. 

There was nothing sinister about him. Where he was, what he was doing, who he was with, what he must have done, was horrifying. 

But he himself didn’t come across as a big evil monster or demon or anything like that. I couldn’t see his eyes in the shadow of his hood, but I could tell he was looking at me directly. He said to me in a friendly, polite, calm, and thick local accent,
“Don’t be afraid.”

He said it like a father to a child on their first day of school. It felt sincere and honest. Him and his group then began slowly pacing towards us, closing in on us.

Connor sprinted away from the direction of the man as fast as he could. He looked like an Olympic sprinter. I instinctively followed him. 

Then those faint screams we heard before became not so faint; they erupted through the forest like an earthquake. We all ran past the figures, and up closer I realized that rotting fruit smell was them. 

They were all screaming. I could now see, even in the mere seconds I saw them as I dashed past them, some had masks on. All sorts of masks. I couldn’t make out what, but they looked shiny and ceramic, and some looked wooden with cheap paint. 

They reached out their arms towards us, like they were trying to give us a hug. I could see their hands, thin and bony, pale as the man’s face, long nails, and thick with scars. The screams were so loud I thought my eardrums were going to cave in.

That was the fastest I ever ran in my life. My legs, especially my knees, have never been the same after that. We ran for a long time, gradually slowing down. We finally came to a quick stop when we saw water. 

Then we saw the bridge; we just had to run around the river and we could get back to the bridge. It was only now that I noticed Claudia wasn’t with us. I couldn’t breathe from the running, but I shouted to Connor,
“Where’s Claudia?”

In the darkness, we gave each other a look, a painful yet horrified look. He said it before I even could:
“We can’t go back.”

He accelerated again from our quick halt to an explosive sprint to the bridge. I followed, I could feel tears running down my face.

We sprinted to the bridge and could see the car park. I looked behind us, expecting there to be an army of cloaked monsters charging at us. But there was nothing. We kept running until we got to the car. In the darkness, he fumbled with his keys.

I said to him,
“Connor, hurry up! We need to call the police!”

“I’m trying,” he screamed. There was pain, frustration, fear, and anger in both our voices. He finally opened the car, and we jumped inside, quickly starting it. 

As the headlights lit up and beamed ahead of us, we saw them again. In the trees, they were there. Must have been about twenty of them, maybe more. 

They were just watching us, observing. They were slightly peeked behind the trees, like they were pretending to hide. As Connor drove the car out of the gravel car park, I turned my head to see them slowly pacing towards our fleeing car, like they had before in the clearing. 

One raised their arm and waved at us, like waving goodbye. Their pale hand missing fingers, the ring and pinky detached.

We called the police; they didn’t believe a word. A student was missing, so they got a search party and scoured the woods for days. They didn’t find a thing. The tabloids labeled it, “Student lost in woods.” It didn’t help that Claudia had actually run away from home twice years before. 

They had all sorts of theories as to what really happened. They said she was pranking us, or that we scared her and she ditched us. It’s been two years, and she still hasn’t been found.

Connor and I lost touch after that. We both dropped out of uni and went to live back home. I still have him on social media; I don’t use it much anymore, but he doesn’t post, just like me. I don’t know what he’s doing now.

As for me? I’ve been struggling. My garden back home is big like half an acre, lots of trees. When I moved back I could have sworn I saw them…things hiding in the trees. So I don’t come out my room now.

My mum brings everything up to my room. She treats me like I’m about 4 years old now. I go days without seeing her or talking at all. She cares but doesn’t know how to help.

I can’t eat meat or fruit after all that. I can browse the internet but even that can scare me. I spend all day watching easier going chill TV like kids’ movies and cheesy sitcoms. I eat Doritos all day in my room just to get through the day. 

I used to compete in amateur MMA and have a six pack, now I’m skinny fat. I forgot to mention but I was doing law at uni, had a really good internship lined up. Now I haven’t worked since that day she disappeared.

I really miss my friends, and of course I wish she was still here. I wish they had at least found a body, just for her family even. Then they’d believe me too I think. 

Whatever those things were, I know they did something horrible to her. 

That man, what did he mean by “don’t be afraid”? I have nightmares every single night of that moment, and in my nightmares I see all the possibilities of what they could have done to her and us. 

I can’t even open my curtains because I genuinely believe they’re outside my window, watching and waiting for me.
