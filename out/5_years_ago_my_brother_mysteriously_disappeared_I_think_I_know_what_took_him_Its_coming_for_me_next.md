Dear Diary, I’m sorry for my horrible grammar and overall bad writing skills. Regardless, I’ve been having thoughts, and I think they would be better off on this page.

I’ve always had an irrational fear of disappearing. Imagine one second you’re there and the next… just gone, wiped from existence. Like some overarching power right-clicked your life and hit delete. Gone.

Better yet, imagine this has already happened to someone you once knew. Of course, you would never know. In fact, the disappearance of others is almost more terrifying to me than my own. The phobia actually has a name, it’s called ‘Athazagorapgobia’, ‘fear of disappearing or being forgotten’. For me, Athazagorapgobia kicks in not only for people but also for things, places, thoughts and animals. 

Often, when going down the online ‘disappearing’ rabbit hole, you end up at the Mandela effect. If you don’t already know, this effect shows how things like Pikachu’s black tipped tail or the cornucopia in the Fruit of the Loom logo have seemingly been removed from our universe. How can it be that so many people have such vivid memories of things that apparently never existed?

Many people say they’re the product of societal expectations, creating mass confusion over what things were once like. I think I agree with those people, but I don’t buy the Mandela effect. Still, I get curious and wind up coming back to [r/Mandela](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mandela/) or other similar forums more than I’d like to admit. 

That's a weird thing about me. The more I hate things, the more I can’t get away from them. The Mandela Effect is one of those things. It puts me on edge, triggers my phobia and yet I can’t seem to get enough of it.  

You might ask why I’ve told you about these fears of mine. Well, it’s because in a way, my fear is reality. It has nothing to do with the supernatural or things shifting in and out of our reality; instead, it’s about the passage of time. You see, my brother disappeared 5 years ago. 

The more time goes on, the more I notice his existence fading. Now that he’s physically gone, he only continues to exist in our minds, and eventually, he will cease to exist even there. Once that happens, he will be gone, wiped from the universe’s history tab. Not just him either; everyone. Everyone will cease to exist one day, first physically and then a little while later, metaphysically. 

I remember first experiencing this phenomenon just after the search efforts ended. The world moved on, things continued to change, move and advance just without my brother. Everyone just forgot and moved on. I hate to say it, but his vanishing had little to no effect on the world. His name made a few appearances in the newspaper, and his portrait was printed on the back of some milk cartons made by a slowly dying local dairy brand, and that was it. Just like that, he became barely more than a statistic. 

I refused to accept that, all of that, I think you would’ve too. Even if it was inevitable, it’s far too soon for him to be nothing more than a memory, far, far too soon. And so naturally I started looking into his disappearance, at first through ‘helping’ a detective and extracting as much information from them as I could, but now by myself. 

The detective was nice enough, but as she began to hit dead ends, she slowly stopped replying to my emails and questions, and eventually, the case was closed and marked as ‘unsolved’. I don’t blame her; in her eyes, the fruitless, blind hunt for clues that was this investigation wasn’t worth the time. But as for me, being a night shift security guard, I had virtually all the time in the world.

When police first arrived at his apartment, he had already been gone for a while. They found a cold, stinking lasagna, a smashed glass with red wine spilt on the ground and no signs of a break-in. This must have meant that my brother dropped his glass and then walked out the door without taking his shoes or anything. 

They predicted he had been gone for about a week. Around that time, there was a planned power outage. The theory was that he had dropped his glass when the power went out, then went out to inspect the power box for whatever reason and during that time was kidnapped. Smoothly. Without trace. For what reason and by whom, nobody knew. 

They went through all his emails and contacts as well as his history and found no evidence of him having made an enemy or anything of the sort. There was no evidence that the electricians at the outage had done anything malicious, and no witnesses of any suspicious behaviour.  

For a long time, I was certain it was something to do with the electricians, I mean, they were the only ones out at the time. But there really was nothing. Security footage from a nearby traffic camera showed them repairing the power box and then driving off. 

 

To this day, I sit in my empty security room trying to piece together a story. Now, me not being a detective and all makes this task incredibly difficult. Honestly, I’ve never really found any solid clues of where he went, but for me, that itself has always been the biggest clue.

I always remember something the detective said back when she was first assigned the case, ‘This case isn’t normal, we can’t waste our time looking for the normal’. So I’ve looked at abnormal possibilities. I started looking at online paranormal forums. It was dumb, but it seemed like the most obvious place to start. I went off searching the depths of Reddit for people who might know something. 

I only ever found people trying to convince me a demon had taken him, or he had glitched out of reality. Really I don’t know what I was expecting. It didn’t take long before I realised that approach was useless. 

Since that realisation, I really haven’t had much to go on. Since then, I have looked into human trafficking, hitmen, government assassinations - maybe he saw something he wasn’t supposed to see? I don’t know. Nothing seems to line up with my brother's case. Still, I’m determined to find out what happened.

I will continue this diary when I have time. Anywa,y it's 3 am now and I have to do a round at the mall I’m working at. I think I saw something move on one of my cameras, bye.

**Entry 2, 1/11/2014 - 01:28**

Hello again, it’s been a little while. Some interesting things have happened since my first entry. 

Later that morning, after I’d written my entry, I had to deal with a homeless man trying to break into the mall. When I confronted him in the parking lot, he was trying to smash a store window by ramming it with his head.

I told him he had to leave. He got hostile, tried to smash a beer bottle over my head. I managed to weave the swing and decided to call the police. Luckily, the station is just across the road, so they came almost instantly. 

However, the man didn’t go down without a fight. The guy swung the bottle, catching one of the officers in the face, then took off toward a window before literally diving headfirst through the shop window, taking out a couple mannequins as he went through -  very impressive acrobatic skills, If you ask me. 

Somehow, the officer got away with a small scrape across his cheek; however, the homeless guy didn’t look so good. They apprehended him and called for an ambulance. After some more struggling and shouting, a first responder arrived who confirmed the man needed to be taken to hospital as a result of the dolphin dive through the window.

A younger medic (probably a rookie) was also there to help haul the man onto a stretcher and into the back of the ambulance. One of the officers thanked me and reassured me I could call anytime if I was having trouble removing intruders.

I had to file an incident report, and the property damage which gave me something to do. I felt bad for the guy honestly, I mean, what circumstances could bring a man to that state?. He was surprisingly agile. I mean dolphin diving through a window is no small feat. 

I think he might be the result of a failed Olympic athlete who’s taken far too many drugs. You’d be surprised how many of those kinds of incidents I have to deal with. Most of the time, they go away after seeing me, but oftentimes it can escalate.

The other thing that happened wasn’t quite as interesting, but I'll mention it anyway. Two nights ago, I was sitting back in my security room around 2 am, watching the parking lot cameras and Netflix simultaneously, when the parking lot lights began to malfunction. They would momentarily flick off before turning on again around five seconds later.

I was thinking about whether or not I could be bothered reporting this when I noticed that every time the lights flicked back on, the cameras I would see this strange static for half a second. It wasn't like normal static. I can’t put into words exactly what I saw; it was like a cacophony of all the colours mushed together, quickly lighting up in the dark corners of the parking lot to form a scene I couldn’t really comprehend.

I found it strange that the cameras were only picking up the weird static in the dark areas of the dimly moonlit parking lot. I chalked it up to electrical malfunctions or something to do with the camera exposure, then reported the incident. Last night, my boss told me he had told the property manager about the issue. An electrician had come in, but couldn’t find anything wrong. 

It happened again last night, strangely enough, around the same time. First, the parking lot lights started malfunctioning, and then the cameras kept showing those weird static colours in the dark corners of the parking lot, only for a split second after the lights flicked off and on again. I logged it again, the electrician came in again, and once again found nothing wrong with any of the electrics. It’s probably nothing, but still, it unsettles me.

I went through some old texts from my brother. Not sure why, I’ve done it a hundred times already. I guess I’m still hoping that after all these years, I’ve missed some crucial detail that might give me some insight into what happened the night he disappeared. I never find anything. 

The last few messages we exchanged were about inviting some of our friends on a camping trip, ‘like the good old times’ was the last thing he ever told me. So much for those. As kids, we used to go out into the woods and camp with our friends. 

We would sit around campfires, drinking beers, sharing a cigarette while laughing, talking about girls and how stupid school was. Back then we were oblivious to reality; that's why we were happy, we simply ignored all the bad things. With age, bad things became unavoidable (rent, debts, work, etc) and our obliviousness collapsed; along with it much of our happiness did as well. 

Our last conversation was a futile attempt to return to our obliviousness/‘good old times’. Most of our friends would have been busy with family and jobs anyway. It’s pessimistic, I know, but that’s how I see it. A final spark of hope stamped out by the cruel boot of the universe. 

As I'm writing this the parking lot lights have begun to falter again. Crap…  there it is again, every time I look up at the camera I see that weird static. I think I’m going to head down there and investigate the lights myself. Useless electricians probably aren't even doing anything. Just walking in collecting a paycheck and leaving again. Besides, it’s not like there's much else to do. No homeless people diving through windows so far tonight.  I’ll give an update soon. Bye.

**Entry 3, 3/11/2014 - 01:15**

The last few days have been… weird. Nothing paranormal or anything like that, at least I don’t think so. I’ll start by telling you what happened when I went down to the parking lot after the last entry. 

I grabbed my flashlight and took the lifts to the parking lot. The lights had completely failed at that point and it had gone completely overcast by the time I got to walking down there. Without my torch, I wouldn’t have been able to see anything. I cursed the electrician for not being able to find the issue and then walked over to the electrical box. 

Conveniently, it’s placed on the corner of a cracked concrete pillar, a good 100 meters from where I was standing at the entrance. I rarely had to come out here, I always parked my car in the back employee parking lot and at this time of year it's freezing outside (not that the inside is much warmer). 

Of course, the door on the box was jammed shut. The lock mechanism wouldn’t even budge despite being in the unlocked position. Evidently it hadn’t been opened in so long that it was completely rusted over. It was a wonder the lights hadn’t failed earlier judging by the state of the electrical box. 

‘Useless bloody electrician’, I murmured to myself as I plucked out the flat tip screwdriver from my pocket knife. After a minute or two of wedging and prying, the latch finally flicked up and the old metal door panel creaked open on its hinges. The old plastic switchboard was worn and cracked, the little red light which was supposed to confirm there was power was dimly osculating between off and barely on. 

What confused me was the fact that all the switches were at the ‘off’ position. At first, I thought the original electrician had screwed up the switches and somehow mixed up off and on but when I flicked each switch to the on position, the parking lot lights came on one by one.

I was baffled and slightly unsettled. In the end, I convinced myself that the feeble switches were probably damaged causing the switches to flick off by themselves - or something like that. Maybe it’s a safety feature that the switches turn off by themselves? I’m not an electrician, so I left it at that. 

As I turned to walk back to walk to the security room one of the lights flickered right when I turned. For a split second where there should have been complete darkness I could have sworn I saw that weird static mush of colours that I had seen on the cameras only just in my peripheral. At first I thought my eyes were playing tricks, I was quite tired at the time so that made sense. However it happened again an hour or so later. 

This time I was walking through the dark and decrepit food court. They had dimmed the indoor lights right down to save power so those were next to useless. That place always puts me on edge for whatever reason. I think it's because there’s so many hiding spots behind counters and tables that I always have to check.

I'm terrible with jump scares so whenever there’s a rat or raccoon looking up at me from behind a counter (a fairly frequent event) I just about jump out of my body. This time nothing like that happened, but as I waved my flashlight around I could swear just between the boundary of light and darkness I could see that weird blend of static colours. I could never focus on it properly, it somehow blended in with both the light and darkness. Kind of like when you stare at the ceiling and see visual snow (those little pixel things) but… stronger. 

I would see it in my peripheral for a split second and try to spin and look at it, but it would always be gone. At one point, the flashlight flickered and I panicked, thinking it would die. For that second, the mush of colours appeared in front of me like a short blitz. I can’t explain exactly how it looked because I myself can’t comprehend what I was seeing, but it seemed so… prominent, like it couldn’t have come from my mind.

These sightings have been happening for the past few nights. Every time I spin around or turn quickly I’ll see it in the corner of my eye, seamlessly blending into the dim surrounding environment. Then it will disappear just as quickly as it appeared. I’m starting to get used to it. I think these night shifts are just getting to me, maybe I’ll take some leave or see a therapist or something.

Other than that I had to deal with some of those ‘urban explorers’ last night who seemed to have confused this mall for a shutdown one (no surprise). They were complacent enough and left without too much fuss which was nice. Usually teenagers are more difficult to deal with. 

After that little ordeal I finished up my round and walked back to the security room. I tried to watch the cameras but ultimately succumbed to my tiredness. 

The only reason I woke up was because the next guy who did the morning shift was nudging me on the shoulder and asking if I was alright. I went home and collapsed in bed after that.

As usual I’ve made almost no progress on finding out what happened to my brother. I did however manage to recall a memory from the last time I saw him in person. It was at dinner at my mum's house, maybe 3 months before he went missing. It was the first time I’d seen him in a while. 

My brother had always been an anxious person, he dealt with a lot of social anxiety and probably depression, and so at this dinner when I noticed him glancing around as if he were nervous I passed it off as his anxiety and chose not to confront him. 

He didn’t speak much. He had been particularly silent over the past few weeks and deflected all our questions with one or two word answers. I remember him telling us he had started seeing a therapist again which made me a bit less worried. He left soon after merely nibbling on the macaroni and cheese mum had made. I remember seeing him speed walk to his car right after he left the house before driving off. As if he was trying to get away quickly.

Having these memories makes me regret not doing anything more. I mean looking back he was clearly troubled and needed help and it was arrogant and stupid of me to just shrug that off as normal. To me it’s clear his mental state was related to his disappearance. The investigators kind of passed it off as ‘not severe enough’.

Anyway I’m pretty sure I’ll take some leave, I actually can’t remember the last time I took leave. I’ll give another update soon. Bye for now.

**Entry 4, 8/11/2014 - 15:24**

It’s been 4? No, 5 days since my last entry. My boss granted me a grand total of 2 days off. I also had my usual Saturday off so that gave me three days to relax. That static’s really starting to get to me. Everywhere I look, it’s there, lurking in the corner of my eye. I can’t tell if it’s getting larger or not, but it’s definitely not disappearing as quickly. It comes with a kind of weight, I feel its presence before I turn around and catch a glimpse. It’s really is weird.

I also went out for dinner with some old friends who used to go camping with us. I told them about the static mush and they told me I should see an eye doctor or therapist, which I did actually end up doing. We then spoke a bit about old times with my brother. Eventually the conversation circled to his disappearance. 

One of my older friends who was particularly close to my brother (I’ll call him Dave) had seen him only a few weeks before he disappeared. Dave had gone over to his place to visit him, he was passing by anyway and thought he’d pay him a visit. He mentioned how he seemed nervous but like me passed it off as his anxiety which was nothing new.

I'm paraphrasing here but he said something like: ‘Looking back at it, it was kinda weird, he kept looking around and fiddling with his fingers but I genuinely thought nothing of it, ya know? That's just how he always was’.

The thing that got me thinking was Dave mentioning how he was glancing around the room. Of course this was five years ago but I vividly remember him doing the same a few months prior at mum's place. I guess what I’m trying to say is that maybe my brother was seeing the ‘abnormalities’ that I am now. 

Once again it reminds me of the investigator's words, ‘this case isn’t normal, we can’t waste our time looking for the normal’.  I mean this is something clearly not normal right? If he really was experiencing what I am then is it possible that it drove him to madness? You wouldn’t think so because there would be signs that he was going crazy. The investigators surely would have picked up on those, no?.

Anyway, I got my eyes checked out, the doctor couldn’t find anything wrong. I also saw a therapist. He told me the static I'm seeing is likely just a hallucination as a result of stress and that I need a change of scenery. He suggested trying meditation. I think that's a good idea.

I have to work again tomorrow, but it's already late so it isn’t really an option. I’ll see if this meditation thing works .I’ll update soon. Bye.

**Entry 5, 13/11/2014 - 02:55**

It’s gotten worse, I still can’t look at it directly but I know it’s grown. Every time I look around I see the putrid mush out of the corner of my eye, menacingly lurking waiting to grow. They bring this horrible dizzy feeling that makes me feel like I’m walking at an angle. I started calling the blurs of incomprehensibility ‘blind spots’. 

Worst of all, I think I see movement in them. Just last night I was patrolling down a hall of old, mostly closed stores when I saw it again, like a hole in reality. It disappeared after 2 or so seconds, but I swear a humanoid blur disturbed the otherwise still image. 

It freaked me out and I speed walked back to the security room. I ended up convincing myself I was hallucinating. This was my mind playing tricks. Since then it has happened a few times, I feel this thick weight in my chest just before I turn to see it. A blur of motion in an otherwise still frame. Sometimes the shape will freeze for a second, as if watching me before blitzing off out of my vision.

I also tried meditation, It feels like it only made it worse. One morning, I sat for about 3 hours listening to this meditation podcast, but I could never get in the zone, and the blind spots kept appearing in my peripheral vision. I turned the lights on, and It actually helped a bit. I think that's their weakness: light. I honestly might start sleeping with the lights on. I try to leave the lights on as much as possible. It seems to make them less frequent, and they become a bit fainter.

Early this morning a small party of homeless people found their way into the food court at the mall. I saw the small pixilated figures on the camera poking around garbage cans and trying to take down the store gates. I really didn’t want to go down there. I delayed for a while thinking maybe they’d just leave but when ten minutes had passed and they hadn’t, I mustered up the courage to head down. 

Trying not to glance around I headed down the elevator. To my surprise as I walked into the food court that horrible feeling of dizziness that was so prevalent when I was alone went away. I actually stopped seeing the blind spots fully for the first time in days. 

I feel like it was something to do with the presence of others. In fact I almost didn’t want to shoo the homeless people away. In the end I did. They were fairly complacent and left after a few insults and remarks about the mall being a ‘public place’. I made sure to lock the emergency entrance I suspected they had come in through. As I did so the feeling returned, sure enough when I turned around I started seeing them again. 

When I thought I saw another bit of movement in the blind spot I took off running back to the security room. That was dumb because I tripped on my shoe lace and went flying into a table. I got back up, calmed myself down and did a fast walk back. 

After that the atmosphere that the blind spots seemed to bring with them was back in full swing. I cut my shift half an hour early and went home. Currently I can’t sleep. I decided I might as well update this. I am now almost certain this is what my brother experienced. 

I talked to my mum and she also remembers his anxious energy at that dinner. I haven’t told her about what I’ve been going through, she’ll just say I’m insane. 

The only question that remains is whether or not the blind spots are related to his disappearance. I’m too tired to think about that right now. Not sure when I’ll update again. I’m leaving the lights on.  

**Entry 6, 16/11/2014 - 03:00**

They’re growing. Wherever I shift my gaze the blind spots are covering the edge of my vision. They’ve become more of a blind spot rather than spots. More and more I'm seeing the figures, or maybe it’s the same figure - I can’t quite tell. They beckon to me. Something about their presence induces my horrid curiosity. I try to ignore it, but every time I start to forget, I see them again. They plague my mind as well as my vision.

I had a dream last night. I was stood in the endless expanse of the blind spot. A thick buzzing of particles invading my skull, vibrating my bones and muffling my senses. The only thing I could make out was a distant view of a bedroom in front of me. My bedroom. Like a picture frame with the edges melting seamlessly into the abyss. 

In the bed lay a figure. Me. I watched myself for the longest time. Then I turned in my sleep, shook, then sat bolt upright. Slowly, I tilted my head toward where I was watching. In an instant, it was gone. A bright flash overtook my view, and before I knew it, I was sitting upright in my bed, head turned toward where I had been in the dream. For the longest time, I just stayed frozen, staring at the wall next to my bed. As if I was going to see a blind spot appear, with a distorted version of myself staring back at me. I didn’t. Next thing I was pulling out my computer.

I made a post online about what's been happening on a few different forums. Within a few hours, I got at least 10 different responses.

 Of course, most of the responses attributed the ‘symptoms’ to partial blindness and hallucinations. However, one user by the name of Crazysloth\_003 suggested the ‘double slit experiment’ could explain my recent experiences. 

Crazysloth basically said whatever these blind spots are, they want to be just that, blind spots. They disappear as soon as you see them. The double slit experiment shows how light particles can behave seemingly unpredictably when not being In direct line of sight, or as google puts it: “The double slit experiment demonstrates, with unparalleled strangeness, that particles of matter can behave erratically, and suggests that the very act of observing a particle has a dramatic effect on its behaviour’. 

Crazysloth basically suggested that for one reason or another, I’m able to see particles before they arrange themselves into how they should be. 

Of course, there's a good chance this is all horribly wrong. I mean, even if this does explain the blind spots, it still doesn’t exactly explain why I can see them. Anyways, food for thought, I guess.

With nothing else to do, I’ll keep enduring whatever it is I’m going through. Maybe try looking for more answers. No promises.

**Entry 7, 19/11/2014 - 12:17**

The lights started turning themselves off. No, something started turning them off. The past few days, I’d fall asleep with the lights on and wake up in darkness. That thick dizzy feeling sitting deep in my mind, it almost reverberates. Like TV static, buzzing with intensity from the inside out. After navigating to the light switch, it’s always switched off despite my having definitely turned it on before going to bed.

At work, the lights are flickering more and more. I’ll be sitting at the cameras when suddenly the dim ceiling lights erratically start to blink. Sending me into short bursts of near darkness. Every time the lights turn off, I feel it sending pulses through my body, lurking, closing in on me from all sides. I shut my eyes, a futile attempt at stopping the blind spot from encroaching on my sight. 

One time, the lights flickered, and I saw a silhouette. It was blurred, outlines whirring right in front of me, radiating with sickening intensity. The shape of a hand shot in my direction with impossible speed. I flinched, but the blind spot disappeared before it could reach me. In that second, I think it spoke to me. Maybe it was just my mind, but it felt like the words were forced into my skull. Spoken in a different tone from my usual internal monologue. Not just any tone, it was his… I could swear. It was cracked and distorted like hearing someone who's in a storm through a cheap radio. 

‘It's time ’ 

Since then, I've been feeling suspense. Every moment of silence seeps into my skin. Like something’s about to happen. It’s the silence before a storm.

Despite sounding like him, I don’t think it’s who it sounds like. 

I'm scared. 

Whatever it is, it wants me, and I think it took my brother.

**Entry 8, 25/11/2014 - 05:49**

I quit my job. It overwhelms me, too much darkness, I see the blind spot everywhere. At least at home, I can turn on all the lights. Still, it enshrouds my vision, like I’m being pulled out of my own head from behind. Things are becoming more distant. It feels like I’m watching a movie, not living my life.

Yesterday it came to me again. I woke up lying in bed. My gaze locked on the ceiling, unable to move. The blind spot enshrouding the edges of my vision. At least an hour must have passed like that, then I saw it. At first little more than a quiver in the corner of my eye, then it grew. I couldn’t see it directly, but I felt its presence, immense, powerful. It made me feel tiny. At that moment I knew there's nothing I can do. 

It continued to move toward me. Bit by bit it moved. Powerful humming filled my ears and nose, shaking my bones and flesh. All the while, my eyes stayed glued to the ceiling. It was the same silhouette from before but clearer. I could only see it in my peripheral vision, but I recognised the outline of its head. It was his outline, my brother’s. Yet it felt off. Like something was using him. 

It moved closer. Until it was right next to my ear. I felt nausea rise in my stomach, more buzzing intruded my eardrums, dense, putrid and deafening. For a moment, I completely lost contact with reality. Like I felt in that dream. I was watching, not living. Then it whispered to me.

‘You're mine’

Like before, it spoke through his voice. But it’s not him, he wouldn’t say that.

In an instant, I came back to my senses. Violently shoved back into reality. 

I spent the whole day lying in bed. 

I thought I’d complete one last entry.

Now I feel it again. I sense its presence, its hunger. 

My brother wasn’t enough.
