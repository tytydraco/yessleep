Hi everyone,
Iâ€™m new to Reddit and Iâ€™d like to share a paranormal experience I hadâ€¦ and ask if anyone has ever gone through something similar or maybe even heard of anything like this.

So, Iâ€™m from Serbia, from a small town in the north. One night, I stayed lateâ€”past midnightâ€”at a good friendâ€™s house. We were just hanging out, talking, nothing out of the ordinary. Since I was already feeling tired and live nearby, I decided to walk home. Just to be completely clearâ€”we didnâ€™t drink any alcohol, didnâ€™t smoke anything, and werenâ€™t under the influence of anything. Everything about that night felt normalâ€”until that moment.

The story begins a few hours after midnight, in the middle of winter. The streets were quiet, cold, and empty. Not far from my friendâ€™s house, thereâ€™s a small canal, and right next to it, thereâ€™s a playground thatâ€™s almost always empty, especially at night. Itâ€™s one of those places that feels a little eerie even during the day, let alone after midnight.

As I was walking past the playground and getting closer to the canal, I was talking to that same friend on the phone. We were chatting casually, just passing the time. I wasnâ€™t distractedâ€”my surroundings were clear and visible thanks to some streetlights nearby.

Then, all of a sudden, I froze. My body reacted before my mind could even process what I was seeing. I saw something climbing out of the canal. It looked like a foxâ€”except it was entirely black. Its fur didnâ€™t reflect any light; it almost looked like a shadow. It started running, moving quickly away from me, as if it was frightened or being chased.

After a few steps, its form began to change. It started morphing into something larger, and to me, it looked like a deer or some kind of large animal with long legs. That transformation scared me even more. I stood there thinking I was hallucinating or that something was seriously wrong with me.

Trying to stay calm, I convinced myself it was probably just an animal acting weird, maybe due to the cold or the time of night. I kept my eyes on it and took a slow step forward. But before I could even finish that step, the creature suddenly changed again. This time, it transformed into a giant birdâ€”huge wings, dark feathers, and in a flash, it lifted off the ground and flew away. It flapped its wings only a few times before it vanished into the night sky. It was so fast that I barely had time to react.

Iâ€™m writing this to make sure Iâ€™m not going crazy. I know how this might sound, but I saw what I saw. I really hope someone can help me understand what happened that nightâ€”or at least tell me theyâ€™ve seen or heard of something similar. Maybe I was overtired or imagining things, but it felt completely real, like I was fully awake and aware.

Please, if anyone has seen, heard about, or even knows someone who might recognize a story like thisâ€”let me know. Iâ€™d really appreciate any insight or thoughts. I just want to understand what I experienced, because itâ€™s been stuck in my mind ever since.

Greetings from Serbiaâ€¦ see you in the next story time ðŸ˜±
