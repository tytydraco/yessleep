After my middle school graduation, in celebration of our intellectual achievements, a few friends and I spent a Saturday being as stupid as possible. We played a mind-numbing amount of CoD, shotgunned some beer we had bribed from an older friend, and then ran wild around town. We played chicken fight in the river. We free-climbed the side of Town Hall until the sheriff chased us away. My buddy John puked his guts out in front of a nice-looking family in the park. It was great.

In those days, I had a friend named Isaac who, in retrospect, was probably responsible for 95% of the trouble I got into as a kid. After a long day, our group retired to his house, and Isaac suggested that we all get baked. His mom was working that night, and his older sister was on vacation with her boyfriend—leaving her recently-acquired stash of edibles conveniently unattended. I wasn't too keen on the idea. I was no model citizen, clearly, but I liked knowing what I was consuming before I put it in my body; it's why I would gladly crack open a can of beer with friends but stayed wary of jungle juice at parties. When Isaac came out of his sister's room with a tupperware full of brownies and a vague, hand-wavey explanation of the dosage, I resolved to restrain myself to a small serving. The seven of us took our brownies, which we all agreed were more bitter than we expected, and then settled in for a night of video games and movies.

The brownies didn't take effect for a while, but once they hit, they hit hard. The energy in the room dissipated quickly, leaving my friends giddy and lethargic. For some reason, the pot had the opposite effect on me. I felt uncomfortable and on-edge, and my paranoia was not eased in the slightest by my friends' decision to watch a horror movie. It was a subtitled foreign film called *Eyes of God*, and while I can't recall much of the plot or even the original language of the film, I remember that it followed a necromancer as she attempted to raise her son from the dead. It was an R rated film full of gore and nudity, which delighted my friends, but I was only passively watching. I seated myself on an old recliner, huddling under a blanket and wondering why I felt so unwell. The brownies were the obvious culprit, but I had consumed so little, and none of the others seemed in the least affected. I felt as though I had suddenly contracted an awful fever—the kind that chills the bones and sets the skin on fire.

The film ended with a seance scene. The protagonist covered her eyes with her hands and recited an evocation in Hebrew, and when she lowered her hands, a warped, demonic-looking version of her son was standing before her. A part of his soul had returned to her, but she would never truly be reunited with her child in this life. It was a mediocre film at best with a rather uninspired "be careful what you wish for" moral, but I noticed Isaac perk up in recognition during the finale.

"Woah," he murmured. "Sounds like *Kel Maleh Rachamim*, but backwards." The *Kel Maleh Rachamim*, as I came to know later, is a prayer usually recited in memory of the deceased in Jewish traditions. It's a plea for the soul to find peace and rest in the afterlife, asking for divine compassion and forgiveness.

"We should do it," John said from his spot on the floor.

"Do what?"

"Summon the dead, bro."

"Who're we summoning?" Someone else inquired.

"I have a dead grandpa but he was kinda a piece of shit."

"I don't know any dead people."

"Me neither."

Everyone thought for a minute, and then Isaac gave a facetious laugh. "How about that Gatlin kid? What was his name? Oliver?" He was referencing the victim of one of our town's more famous deaths by drowning. If I had been more clear-headed, I might've objected to the idea, but I was too busy trying to remember how to breathe. Lungs tight and hands clammy, I was mulling over the possibility of a latent THC allergy when my friends summoned me to the carpet. I joined them on the floor, completing the loosely-shaped heptagon formation as the credits to *Eyes of God* rolled on the T.V. behind me. Now, as an adult, I'm well-aware that I should've told someone what was happening to me as quickly as possible, but I was young and stupid and hesitant to make a scene. I figured that if I still felt ill once we had completed John's dumb ritual, then I would tell someone.

John went first, covering his eyes and stumbling over the strange version of the prayer (the "remix", as he jokingly called it) with Isaac's help. Of course, nothing happened when he lowered his hands, but it didn't stop him from pretending he saw a ghost. We went one by one, pronunciation improving with every new speaker, and for the most part, everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. I think that in any other circumstance, Isaac and the others would've dismissed an activity like this as being too girly (too akin to summoning Bloody Mary or whatever other weird crap girls got up to at their sleepovers), but the pot had loosened everyone up.

I was the fourth to recite. At 11:43, according to the clock at the other end of the room, I covered my eyes and began to speak. Still feeling as though someone was stepping on my chest, I wasn't sure I'd be able to say anything at all, but the words came out with surprising ease. From his seat across from me, Isaac helped me bumble my way through the prayer, which in English would have said something like this:

*Tie his soul with the rope of life from behind the hiding of thy wings.*

*May thy divine mercy protect him forever,*

*For a charity was given to the memory of his soul.*

*Provide a sure rest upon thy wings,*

*Angel of Mercy.*

The room went oddly quiet as I finished reciting. Maybe they were shocked by my excellent pronunciation. Hands still over my eyes, I considered who I should mess with. This whole thing had been John's idea, so I decided to pretend I saw something behind him. I smiled, preparing myself to mimic the movie necromancer's exaggerated scream. I lowered my hands, fixing my gaze upon where John had been sitting.

But John wasn't there. Nor was Isaac, nor any of the other boys who had been sitting across from me just seconds ago.

Instead, staring straight at me, were six strangers.

"Well?" One of them said. "What do you see?"

I sat frozen in place, hands still raised. I was still in Isaac's living room. It was dark, but I could still tell that all of the details were the same—the old piano in the corner, the photo of Mount Elbert on the wall, and the grandfather clock, reading 11:44. The only things amiss were the people in the room. Where had my friends gone, and who were these people who had taken their places?

"I …" I didn't know what to say. This was either the most elaborate prank ever, or that brownie I ate had been laced with some serious hallucinogens. Whereas five of the strangers regarded me with mild amusement, the one sitting in Isaac's place leaned forward, disquiet apparent in his expression. "I don't see anything."

Bored by my answer, the strangers lifted their eyes from me. Behind me, the credits of *Eyes of God* finally finished. The VHS rewinded itself, filling the dimly lit room with a staticky hum. The stranger sitting where John had been leaned back on his hands, looking out the window to the vast forest and the towering mountains beyond them. I studied him carefully as a small square of moonlight illuminated his face. I was certain that I did not know the person I was looking at, and yet somehow he seemed familiar to me.

"Hm," he said, almost to himself. "My mom's on her way."

I followed his gaze to the treeline, but saw no headlights, no approaching vehicle. All I saw was a patch of cedar trees, far in the distance near the base of the mountains, swaying as the wind caught their leaves. I hurriedly excused myself and made my way out of the room. I walked down the hallway and turned into a small bathroom to splash some cold water on my face. After closing the door, I went to the sink and took a good look in the mirror hanging above it. My breath caught as I saw a face that wasn't exactly mine, but wasn't exactly *not* mine either. Have you ever stared in the mirror for so long that your face starts to distort? That's the best way I can describe what I saw.

The door to the bathroom clicked open, and the stranger in Isaac's place, the one who had instantly looked wary of me, stepped inside and closed the door. I felt like a cornered animal with someone I didn't recognize between me and my only exit.

"You good?" The question sounded genuine enough. I tried taking a deep breath and calming myself down. The only logical explanation was that I was having an adverse reaction to the edible and was seeing things that weren't there.

"I think I'm hallucinating, Isaac. Your face looks all messed up."

"Who's Isaac?"

For a long moment, we stared at one another, both equally unnerved. Then, the stranger took a deep, shaky breath. Mouth set in a thin line, he gave me a single nod. "I understand. We need to get you back."

"Back where? What's going on? Who are you?"

"A friend." He answered, not bothering with the first two questions. "We need to get you to the river quick. Just follow my lead, alright? Don't tell the others what's happening. And do not let anyone here touch you, ok?"

"Why not? What happens if they do?"

"Nothing pleasant," he said, and his tone was so severe that, hallucination or not, I had no choice but to agree to his terms. Without waiting for me to ask more questions, my "friend" left the room. I followed him out, making sure to keep ample distance between us in case I tripped into him. As soon as I turned out of the bathroom, I saw the other five strangers at the end of the hall, watching us.

"Something wrong?" One of them asked.

My "friend" nodded in my direction. "He's not feeling too good. I'm gonna walk him home, make sure he doesn't pass out on the way."

They said nothing in response. Not-Isaac walked in the direction of the entryway, slipping through the small gap left by the other five. It occurred to me that I had to follow him, and do so quickly. I forced my feet to move, every step bringing me closer to the strangers. I felt a horrible, mounting dread as I approached. As I walked carefully between them, one of the boys stuck his leg out as if to trip me. I saw it just in time, hopping over it a split second before his foot came into contact with my own. The others laughed, then pushed past one another to follow my friend to the door. I winced every time one of them came within a few inches of me.

"We'll come too," one of the strangers said, stopping at the entryway to put on his shoes. "I'm tired of sitting around inside." My friend was quiet as the others followed us out the door, perhaps worried that rejecting the strangers' company might attract their suspicion.

The night was cold and still. We headed down the driveway and made our way to the woods, within which laid the shortest path between my house and Isaac's. I tried to catch my friend's eye, looking for further direction. He had said something about a river—I could only assume he was talking about Cedar Creek, the namesake of my town. It wasn't far from our current position (if we were still in my town, that is), but it was not on the way to my house. At some point, we'd have to veer off course, and doing so might put unwanted attention on me.

But then again, why was I blindly following my "friend's" instructions anyway? He was as much a stranger to me as the others, and maybe I was missing out on some much-needed help by not telling the other five what had happened to me. A hopelessness gripped me there in the dark as I tried to tell what was real and what wasn't. Surrounded by unfamiliar faces, I listened for the familiar sounds of the woodlands to comfort myself. And yet, even as I strained my ears, I heard nothing: no hooting of owls, no rustling of small mammals in the brush, not even any chirping of crickets. There were no sounds of life in those woods, nor was there the slightest rustling of foliage in the breeze. As the strangers chatted around me, I considered what I had seen out the window earlier, troubled by the stagnancy of the night air. If there was no wind that night, then what had been shaking the cedar trees?

Not-John, who had been leading the pack, suddenly came to a halt. He turned around to face the rest of us. "We should play one more game before my mom gets here."

I looked around. Why did he keep bringing up his mom, and what the hell did he mean by 'here'? Was his mom about to pop out from behind a tree to take him home?

"He's really not feeling well," my friend protested, gesturing in my direction.

"He looks fine to me. One round won't hurt ya, right?"

"What game are you suggesting?"

Not-John raised a finger to his chin, striking an exaggerated 'thinking' pose. "How abouuut …" He looked directly at me, smiling.

"Tag."

His arm lashed out fast as a whip to jab the shoulder of the stranger next to him. "You're 'It'!" he announced before running in the opposite direction. Unfortunately, the boy who'd been pronounced 'It' did not chase after him, but instead sprinted straight towards me. Not-Isaac cursed, running in what I believed to be the direction of the river. I followed him, grateful that, if nothing else, we finally had an excuse to break away from the others. The trees towered above me, a canopy of leaves blocking out the moonlight as I tried to keep pace with my friend. I had never run so fast in my life, and yet try as I might, I couldn't seem to outrun the stranger who was chasing me. My ears were filled with the pulsing of my own blood through my veins and the shallow breaths of my pursuer. And beneath those two sounds, there was something else too. It sounded like boughs cracking, like something lumbering through the trees in the distance. Something big.

To my horror, not only was the distance between myself and my friend widening, but that between myself and my pursuer was decreasing. In a fit of panic, I picked out a particularly large tree and circled the trunk, timing it so that I disappeared just as the stranger ran past. I crouched down, pleading to any and every god that he would keep going, and one of them must have answered. I held my breath as he ran past the tree, the unnatural silence settling over the forest once again as he disappeared from view. I had lost him, but I had also lost my ally and my sense of direction.

I turned in a circle, surveying my surroundings. I couldn't rely on my eyes since everything looked unfamiliar in the dark, and I couldn't rely on my ears since the once-familiar sounds of the forest were no longer there to guide me. Instead, I relied on my memory—retracing my steps in my mind's eye and trying to calculate where I was based on where the group had split apart, the angle at which I had run from the path, and how long I had been running. I picked a direction and jogged. I'll never forget the stillness, the complete absence of animal life. Sometimes, I thought I heard footsteps apart from my own, but the second I stopped, I heard nothing at all.

After a while, I heard a scream, not of terror but of elation, followed by a peal of manic laughter.

"—'s 'It'!" Someone announced, the origin of the voice far too close for comfort. I couldn't quite pick out the name that had been shouted. Realizing that I should have hit the river by now, I changed direction slightly, picking up the pace once more. My lungs tightened. My face stung from running into branches. I felt at once feverishly hot and piercingly cold, but I was urged onward by a familiar thinning of trees. I could have cried for joy; I was approaching a clearing that I recognized, and once I crossed it, I wouldn't be far from the river. I could only hope that my friend wasn't leading me astray, and that whatever was waiting for me in Cedar Creek would end the nightmare I had slipped into.

I ran into the clearing, the sudden dearth of trees making me feel horribly exposed. By the time I was a quarter of the way across the glade, I was certain that I was being followed again. I could feel a presence behind me, yet I could hear no one: no heavy breathing, no snapping of twigs underfoot. Figuring that I couldn't hear my new pursuer because they were too far behind me, I risked a glance backwards and failed to stop the scream that escaped me.

There was a human body, floating a few inches off the ground, less than four feet behind me. I say body and not person because in that split second glance, it was impossible to discern if the person was dead or alive. The person, the thing, was horrifically bloated. Their head hung downward at an odd angle; their skin was so pale that it was almost light blue. Their arms were drawn upwards towards their chest, and their fingers were curled and poised as though they'd been clawing at their own neck. I tried not to focus on the ghastly sight as I sped towards the treeline. At three-quarters of the way there, I saw my friend peering out from behind one of the cedars.

"Come on!" He yelled. "He won't follow past the glade!"

Praying that he was right, I put everything I had into that final stretch across the clearing. Whatever was following me was getting closer, so close that if it reached out one of its swollen arms, it would almost certainly touch me. I managed only a few steps beyond where my friend had stopped to wait for me before I collapsed, my legs utterly spent. I fought for breath as I turned onto my back and propped myself onto my elbows, looking into the clearing for the floating body.

But there was nothing there.

My friend jogged over to where I was lying, looking down at me sympathetically. "We're close," he said. "No use in stopping now."

I laid there panting for another moment, looking up at my ally. He too looked familiar, though I could not recall ever having seen him before. My mind was overrun with questions. Who was that? Where are we? Am I dreaming? Am I hallucinating? Feeling that I only had enough breath to air one of my many inquiries, I eventually settled on:

"Are you dead?"

"I was," he answered, before looking up at the dark sky. "Or maybe, I will be …"

I wanted to ask him to explain himself, to stop with all the riddles and just speak plainly, but a heavy thudding drew my attention. Something was approaching, and some deep-seated instinct in my animal brain told me I didn't want to be around when it got there. Though I wanted nothing more than to curl up into a ball and sleep, I somehow stood.

"Don't panic when you see the river," he said. "It might look strange, but it'll still take you where you need to go."

"You're not coming with me?"

"No. I think you've got it from here." He gave me a sad smile. I thanked the odd stranger, and he bade me goodbye. We split off from each other, him running parallel to the clearing and me perpendicular to it. Though my muscles pleaded for respite, the sound of running water gave me the strength to go on. The thudding increased in volume, trees shaking and boughs breaking as that massive thing ambled its way closer, but it was too late for it to catch me: I had made it to the shore.

The river was flowing backwards. It was a majestic, hypnotic sight, but I didn't stop to appreciate the impossible way in which the current surged upwards along the gentle incline of the forest. I didn't stop running until I reached the water's edge, at which point I took a deep breath, steeling myself for the cold, and dove in.

I was sinking for longer than I should have been given the depth of the river. Frigid water filled my nose and the muffled sound of whatever monstrous entity had been following me slowly faded into the thumping of my own heartbeat. There was a slight stinging feeling against the side of my neck, but aside from that mild discomfort, it was almost relaxing. I thought I had been sinking downwards, but I must have been rising upwards, for eventually I encroached upon the surface (or at least *a* surface). I closed my eyes as my head breached the water and drew in a breath of fresh air. I heard sound again—crickets and nightbirds, the gentle hum of the T.V. and faint ticking of a clock. Warmth surged through me and I knew I was home, and indeed, when I opened my eyes, I saw my six friends looking at me. I was back in Isaac's house, though we all seemed to be standing in the kitchen instead of the living room we had started out in. So overjoyed was I that I could have hugged them all, going around in a circle and telling each one individually how much I valued their friendship. Although, as the world I knew came back into focus, I noticed that my friends didn't look happy to see me. In fact, as they all stood together a few feet in front of me, they looked afraid.

"It's ok, man," Isaac said, reaching a hand out to me. "Why don't you just … hand that over to me?"

Hand what over? I wondered, before I finally thought to investigate the stinging I had felt.

A paring knife. I was holding a paring knife against my own throat. Carefully, I lowered the knife. A tiny trickle of blood slid its way towards my collarbone; I had made a long but very shallow cut. The second the blade wasn't directly pressed against my neck, Isaac lunged forwards, grabbing my wrist with one hand and prying the knife out of my grasp with the other. The other five hovered around us, not sure what to do. After a few tense moments, my friends seemed to decide that I was no longer a threat to myself and others, so I was ushered into the bathroom to put some Neosporin and BandAids on my neck. John came in with me to make sure I was wholly finished with whatever mania had gripped me. According to him, I had lost my shit after our ritual—talking to myself and wandering around the house in a daze. They'd all thought it was hilarious until I marched into the kitchen and pulled a knife out of the cutlery block.

It was a horribly embarrassing evening, but then again, everything's embarrassing when you're fourteen. I didn't end up telling my parents since I didn't want to get my friends in trouble for the edibles, but Isaac did make me swear to never touch the stuff again. We figured, since no one else had the reaction I did, that I must have some kind of severe weed allergy that simply manifested in a very bizarre way. All in all, it was an easy ordeal to explain, neatly packaged with a nice "Don't Do Drugs, Kids!" moral to go along with it. I thought about the strangers I had hallucinated often, particularly the one who had guided me back home, but aside from the occasional bad dream, I quickly moved on from the experience.

The only oddity in the whole situation I discovered a week later. I had returned to Isaac's house for a decidedly sober hangout, and was sitting on his living room couch, looking across the room.

"Damn, it's later than I thought."

Isaac followed my gaze to the grandfather clock.

"Oh, that thing's broken," he said. "It's been stuck at 11:44 for a week."
