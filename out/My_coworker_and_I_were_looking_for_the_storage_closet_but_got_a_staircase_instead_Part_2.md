[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jqj69g/my_coworker_and_i_were_looking_for_the_storage/)

As I began my descent I found that there was dust and dirt on each step, now getting stuck to the bottom and sides of my shoe. Gross, I thought, I guess the guys that did this never came back and cleaned up. 



Once I got to the landing and turned, to my surprise, there were more steps. This case wasn’t more than 5 feet down, but it still struck me as poor planning on the part of whoever designed it. I mean, was it seriously not possible to just extend the room? Before I decided to walk down, I turned and called up to Catherine that things were fine, and there were only a few more stairs, but everything looked good. Leaving the door propped open with a mop bucket, she met me at the landing and we continued. I hadn’t insisted on walking ahead of her, though she all but encouraged me to do so.



At the bottom of the steps there was a large, empty room save for a pile of boxes and power tools, a few piles of strewn-about papers, and oil lamps stuck to the floors and walls. To the right was another hall leading to a lectern, dead ahead from the bottom of the stairs was a door, and to the left was another door with no real light around it. Seeing as the floor cleaner wasn’t in my immediate view, I turned to Catherine.



“Seems like we’re gonna have to take a look around.”



“You got that, right?"



I was surprised to hear this, as up until this night Catherine hadn’t seemed like the kind of person who scared so easily, I was still shocked by her reaction before. She’d always been cool and collected whenever there were rowdy customers at least, but I guess in hindsight that wasn’t a good gauge for how she would react to this. There was nothing even around us though that should’ve made her that nervous.



I took it to mean one of two things:



One, she was testing me. I was supposed to be acting strong in front of her, so she knew I was gonna keep her safe if we went out. That seemed logical at the time.



Two, she was still afraid from before, since these stairs just seemed to appear out of nowhere, and wanted to go back up. That also seemed logical, and more likely.



Going with the first option I took a deep breath and smiled. “We don’t have to split up or anything if you don’t want to. We aren’t some mystery gang.” This seemed to earn me some brownie points as I heard her laugh to herself. Score.



Leading her around the room, we started by searching through the boxes. They were more like storage crates as I got to examine them closer. All but one was empty, housing only some power tools and a burlap sack that folded over itself by the top. It looked like it was full of something, but the smell coming from it was horrible. I opted not to touch it. I turned to Cathy to let her know, but she was halfway across the room from me, staring down the hall that led to the lectern.



I went to call out to her but stopped as I heard what sounded like scraping along the floor to my side. I turned my head as fast as I could but was met with nothing. I swore I heard something dragging itself right beside me. I can still hear the scraping of flesh on concrete. To then be unable to find any trace or signs of a source made me shiver, but maybe it had been something above us. Shaking myself free of the horrors my mind was already making up, I called out to Catherine.



“Anything?”



“Not yet, but I want to go see what’s up with this room. The oil lamps are weird enough, but why would the guys leave the plans down here?”



“So they could ask you to clean up?”



As if those words were enough to bring her peace of mind, I heard her laugh, and once again I found myself lost on her. The light wasn’t great down there, but somehow Catherine had a kind of glow about her. I wanted to say something, anything, but decided that if I did, I might take her out of the laughter, and I’d lose that fluttery feeling in my stomach. The sound of the scraping faded from my mind and was promptly replaced by the giddy chuckles of the woman down there with me. So, I watched her, and as the laughter died down, we were brought back to the basement together. I felt at that moment like maybe I’d never want to leave it in her company. I brought myself back to reality, conceding that I was getting a little ahead of myself. She hadn’t even given me a definite yes. I was losing my cool over a maybe.



“I’m surprised they left anything down here really.” I continued “There’re just some dusty power tools here and a huge sack. It reeks.”

“Sounds like the rest of the store.” Again, that smile. “Would you mind going in here with me?”



Giving a nod in her direction, I strode over and gestured ahead. Catherine stepped in front, and we walked down, however, there were no blueprints on the lectern. It was a book. There was even a large faded sticky note stuck to the space beside it. I didn’t know how Cathy mistook any of it for blueprints, but I chose to ignore it. Sometimes women say crazy things.



“Huh,” she picked it up, dusting the top off, “I’ve never seen plans inside of a book like this.”



“Me either, but I think that's because there are no plans in it. Maybe we should leave it where it was, I wouldn’t want us to get in trouble for touching admin's things.”



“Honestly I don’t think anyone’s gonna mind, looks like they finished building already.”



As she flipped the book open, I repositioned myself in place. I didn’t understand her newfound boldness after her anxiety and astonishment topside. I remember thinking it might've just been a woman thing, they do sometimes say crazy things. Besides, looking through someone else’s things felt uncomfortable when we were only down there for floor cleaner, but I said nothing. It was just us.



To occupy myself I reached out and took the sticky note off the lectern. Scribbled on it was what looked to be a to-do list. I brought it closer to my face so I could make out what was written on it since it was pretty faded and dusty. It read:



\-	prepare living space for next attempt

\-	speak with Apep about Door properties

\-	see about getting key copied

\-	lock the Door



I cocked my head to the side. That definitely confused me. As far as I knew we didn’t have an Apep on the team. I figured someone had lost their to-do list for another job, or it could have been someone from the regional headquarters, either way, it wasn't really my business. So, I stuck the note back where I found it.



Was someone supposed to be living down here? I remember thinking. Why would anyone build a basement apartment underneath here, and who'd want that? 



Cathy scoffed from her place a few steps from me, causing me to perk up and jerk in her direction. I thought maybe she’d seen something funny or possibly was having the same thoughts as me. “Whaddya got?” 



Shaking her head, she didn't reply at first. She came over to me and pointed a finger at the page she was on. It was full of writing on both sides. “It looks like someone was keeping a diary.” She explained.



As I heard this, I placed a hand on the book and pressed it down from her gaze. Her lack of care while rummaging through her higher-up's personal belongings was not something I shared, and I had already gotten the feeling we'd stumbled into something we shouldn't have.



“A diary? Catherine. We shouldn’t be looking through it. If it’s personal, wouldn't we want to leave it for someone else to deal with? I mean, whatever is written in there is not our business.”



“Adrian,” she looked up at me; her expression not as serious as I was sure my own was “look at the date. You don't have to worry.”

I obeyed. As I gazed down at the head of the page I could read the date: May 19th, 1990. That'd been well over 20 years ago. It still wasn’t enough to convince me we weren’t snooping too much, though. “Cool, so this is a super old diary. Good for them for keeping up with it. We should put it down.”



“I don’t think you’re understanding what this means.” Cathy pressed the book to her chest tightly, stepping back from me. “Someone has been living down here!”



There was silence at first, but once I came to terms with the fact that Catherine wasn't joking with me, I laughed. However, I could almost see the desire to figure out this mystery dripping from my friend's gaze. My laughter faltered as I broke through the quiet intensity. “I think that was the point. The post-it next to the book had a list of stuff and a living space was on it. I think this is s’posed to be an apartment, but that’s impossible because there’s never been a basement.”



“That’s true.”



Silence fell between us as we both seemed to be trying to come up with some cause for the place's existence. It was only broken by the occasional sound of the flickering of the oil lamps before an idea was offered by Cathy. “Maybe they took down the back wall and there was just a staircase behind it.”



"You think?"



"I don't know Adrian. I'm just as confused as you, but at least I'm trying to come up with something."



"That's fair- but I don’t know either. We’re definitely intruding now, though. Wanna just head out?”



“Yeah, I guess we can go. Just lemme see how recent this gets.”



Now flipping through the pages, she seemed to have a newfound interest that had completely replaced the fear. I had expected this the entire time, but to see her have this air about her now felt unnatural. This was not the case for me, and I found myself looking around the room. It was at this point that I started noticing the splotchy paint on the walls and the graffiti that had been spray painted about. There were symbols and words I didn’t understand. I thought I had seen some of them in a video game once, but I had no idea what they meant in real life. I shook my head, looking back at Catherine. In an unexpected twist, it seemed like I was more interested in leaving than her. 



“Aw, that sucks.” She’d now stopped flipping through the book.



“What’s wrong?”



“The last entry is from the same year, in July.”



“Guess they weren’t keeping up then. Bummer.”



“Listen Adrian, this is kinda sad: 



July 3rd, 1990



They’re going to lock me down here tonight for the sleep test. That guy Apep said I should keep a separate journal, so whatever I write doesn’t get mixed in with all the other things in here. They gave me something for the shaking and fever, symptoms of withdrawals they said. I’m just glad to be catching a break. I couldn’t stay out on the street anymore. Hopefully, things only go up from here. I’m sure he will read this, so thank you Apep for the place. I'm infinitely grateful.”



As Cathy spoke, I gave the room another once over.



“So, where’s the other book?”



As I asked, she procured a much smaller composition notebook from the inside of the larger.  “After that entry they mentioned they were gonna tuck the new book into the last page here, convenient huh?” 



I scoffed as she handed it off to me and went to place the other book back onto the lectern. I was apprehensive, but ultimately decided it wouldn't hurt if I opened it up. On the first page I'd found another entry. I read aloud for Cathy:



“July 4th, 1990



I’ve never kept a dream diary or journal before, but I guess it’ll help them with their study. Apep told me to record any dreams I had anyway. I’m just a little shaken up to tell you the truth.



I woke up on the floor just outside my room. Something huge was in my face and called me Lighten. I felt like I couldn’t do anything while it was looking at me, not run, not scream, I couldn't even move my arms. It had a lot of mouths, but none that moved. I don’t know how I was hearing it. Dreams are weird. The thing looked so real. I felt like I could reach out and actually feel it there. Eventually, I was able to move again, so I stepped back and told it my name. It didn’t respond to me. I eventually said something else, and it cut me off, telling me that I wasn’t worthy of some task. I asked it to stop but it kept on going. It said a lot of things. Something about a God born from consciousness and doors through the cosmos. It told me I wasn't worthy; that I'd rot with the rest. I didn’t really understand so I kept trying to stop it, but I guess when it was done saying its piece it just stopped. It just sat there, like it died right in front of me. It started to move again, but that's when I woke up. I was covered in sweat. It was a creepy dream, sure, but I think it must be a side effect of these pills. I’ll ask Apep later. He’s supposed to be coming around noon- not that I can tell when that is down here.”



My only reaction at that point was laughter. “That is crazy. There hasn’t ever been a basement here. This guy must mean a different basement he got locked in, because we’ve only ever had a supply closet up there.”



 “Maybe we should call the owner? Forget the cleaner- let’s go up.”



Still in disbelief, I gestured out to the hall. “Sure, let’s do that. Upstairs. Tomorrow. Come on. I just want to get back to flipping shit.”



In agreement, we both made our way back to the main room. I noticed as we were walking that I still had the notebook in my hands. 



“Should I leave this?” I asked ahead. Without turning around, she shrugged. “I don’t know. Whatever you want.”



I looked around the main room and decided to toss the notebook by the crates I’d looked through earlier. I no longer wanted any part of anything going on down here, and I hoped Cathy didn’t either. I was almost itching to continue talking about where she liked going for coffee or maybe hobbies she had. I just wanted to experience anything more interesting and easier to stomach than the new, dirty, poorly lit basement apartment. As I thought about this and tried to catch up to my companion, I heard that same dragging sound. It was further than before, but still clear as day. Seeing as I had almost a full view of the space and couldn’t see anything that would’ve caused the sound, I summed it up to water pipes or something overhead and dropped it. I made a swift ascent and stopped at the top of the stairs, just in front of the exit with Catherine. The mop bucket must’ve fallen over or rolled back because the door was now closed.



“Forget something?” I asked, looking up as she faced me.



“Adrian I’m such an idiot.”



“What do you mean?”



“I don’t have the key on me anymore, I put it down before we came down the stairs.”



“Oh, well that’s fine. You unlocked it; it should still be open.”



She reached back, and the sound that followed made my stomach drop. Catherine jiggled the handle, but the sound of the door opening never came. It must not have actually unlocked, or maybe Cathy had relocked it on our way down without a key. That wasn't the case. The door was left open on the way down, I'd been certain we left it that way. I noticed her face again, panic now laden in her expression.



“Don’t worry, if there’s a basement here then there must be some another door or something to get out. Wouldn’t it be illegal if they didn’t? It sounds like a fire hazard.” Trying to lighten the mood here was not working I judged, based on how Catherine didn’t laugh this time. She shifted her weight from one hip to another. To further remedy this, I offered her a smile. “It’s gonna be okay.”



Still, this didn’t change her expression, but she did reach out and take my hand. I took this for the small victory it was and started to lead her back downstairs. I would be lying if I said that I wasn’t nervous at this point, but for the sake of us both I tried to keep my composure as best I could. As we descended, I started to wonder what it even was that I was afraid of. It was just us down there- but the notebook had made it seem like someone had been here for a while. I began to wonder what became of them, and why no one had ever made it a point to mention it was even a part of this building’s history.



Now back at the crates, Catherine bent over and grabbed the small book from the floor, her other hand still in mine. “Maybe this guy talked about an exit other than the door?”



I shrugged and she took her hand back. As she was searching through the pages, I scanned the rest of the room. I don’t know what compelled me to do so, seeing as we had been there a few moments before, but I just had the feeling that I needed to. Something about the air had changed. It was stale and dried my throat with each breath. That’s when I noticed it. 



The door that had been shrouded in the almost dark, leftover glow of the lanterns to our left was open. Not all the way so we could see inside, but enough to notice that it was in a different position than before. Neither of us had gone over there before then, and there was no one else down there with us.



There isn’t anyone. I remember I had to tell myself. We would’ve seen or heard someone by now.



I took a step forward towards the door, instinctively. I needed; I wanted to know what was beyond it. I was thinking maybe there would be an exit or someone who could help us find it. Either way, it was now my job to investigate, for both of us. I took another step, fixated on the gap in the door and wall, staring into the dark. I couldn’t peel my eyes away, maybe in fear or maybe in awe, I couldn’t place the feelings at that point. I still have trouble placing them when I think about this moment, but I knew that something wanted me to see what was beyond the door.



“Adrian?”



Catherine’s voice took my attention back and I spun to see I had made it halfway across the basement from her. I only recall taking a few steps, but clearly, I’d gone much further.



“Sorry, the door is open," I explained "and I came over to peek in.”



I could see her face change in the flickering of the lamps. She was confused, just as I found myself now, seeing her like this.

“The door looks closed to me.” She said, softly now.



I turned, and she was right. The door sat closed, an overbearing figure in the darkest corner of our cell. There was no gap; no change. The wonder that had come over me moments before passed, and I was finding it hard to explain, even to myself, what had compelled me to walk over.



I made my way back to her quickly. “I guess it was a trick of the light. I seriously thought it was open.”



Cathy let go of her breath, and I saw her shoulders drop. “Okay. You were just walking over there. It was starting to freak me out. I called out a few times but you just kept walking.”



“Yeah, sorry...” I rubbed the back of my neck, wondering if the door had been closed this entire time. Maybe the freaky stuff we’d been reading was starting to get to me. It was late, and I wanted out more than ever, but we still had to find a way.

“Find anything useful?”



Shaking her head, I felt her disappointment. “Nothing. Not even a small window or something. This guy just keeps going on about the test and weird dreams.”



“More about the thing he saw?”



“Almost nothing but that. Though, now I’ve made it to these pages where he refused to sleep.”



I nodded to her, and she read:



“I don’t know what day it is anymore. Nora, I’m sorry about my outburst. I thought I had been sleeping through the night but there is no night. There is no day. There are no days in here. I feel like I am losing my mind. 



Pills. The pills are making me sleep. I’m not taking them anymore. I can’t take them. They are bringing it in here. Every time I close my eyes I see it. Please, Nora I just want to come home. I am scared. No one has come for me. There’s no way out and the door is locked. I am stuck and the more I see it the more real it looks. It's with me now. Nora, I miss you. God I miss you.”



“This guy sounds like he’s going through something rough." I stopped her from continuing. "We don’t know why he was homeless before this. I don’t trust him. If he doesn’t mention a door or window, then I don’t think we’re gonna find anything useful. I guess we’re just gonna have to start looking through the rooms.”



I noticed that I was starting to feel hot. The lack of any useful information now fueled an anger I couldn’t shake. All fear deserted me, replaced with the need for freedom. Without another word, I made my way to the door ahead of us and threw it open.



“What are you doing?” I heard Cathy ask from behind me. I made my way inside. This room was about the same size as the one we’d been in with the lectern and weird symbols, but it was furnished. There was a bedroll on the floor in the back right corner. Wads of paper littered the floor, which I quickly imagined had been used for sanitation.



How could these people leave the place so disgusting? I thought. How is there no way out?



I was answered by the smell of piss.



I stormed out, not interested in questioning anything further without the promise of a way out. This time, I headed to the door in the dim corner, but as I put my hand on the handle, I felt a cold rush fall over me. All anger deserted me, and everything in me warned me to stop. The muscles in my hands tensed to firmly grasp the knob and turn, but I found I overexerted and gripped the handle so hard my knuckles were starting to become pale. My stomach churned. I gagged on my spit. I needed to leave that door alone. I couldn’t open it. I felt like if it opened in that moment I would disappear. Like I'd die. The sensation flowed over my person, and it became overwhelming. I was now under the impression that my death was imminent. Crumbling to the floor, I pulled my hands to my head. Tears threatened to fall from the corners of my eyes. I wanted out then more than ever, but still had no idea where to go. I'd run out of ideas.



“It’s going to be okay. We’ll just have to wait it out.” Catherine’s voice was a light in the dark. I looked up at her and opened my mouth to say something, but I couldn’t. I had no words. She got down next to me and threw her arms around my body in the most comforting hug of my life. The tears never fell, but I clung to Cathy as tight as I could.



“I’m sorry,” I sputtered, bringing her as close to me as I could manage “I don’t know what’s wrong with me.”



“It’s okay, I don’t blame you.”



There was silence then, the flickering light our only ambiance.



“What do we do?” She asked, her voice a whisper.



“I guess the only thing we can. We’re just gonna have to wait until someone opens the door.”



She pulled her head back and looked up at me. “You think so?”



“Probably. When does the next shift start?”



“1 or 1:30 I think.”



“That’s…” I tried to think but had no idea when we’d originally gotten down there. It felt like at least an hour, but with everything going on it wasn’t like I could tell at all. “a few hours from now- I think.”



“Maybe we could get some sleep?”



I scanned the room, eyes darting from the few objects to the doors around us. I did not like that idea. Something was wrong- I didn’t know how I knew, but I did. There was something wrong with the door I just couldn’t move past. Something was wrong with the entire basement.



Lost in my thoughts, I barely noticed Catherine’s hand on my cheek. “We’ll be okay.”



I don’t know how she'd done it then or how she does it now, but everything felt okay. It wasn’t her eyes; the way she was holding me then. Waves of relief thanks to her touch allowed me to relax, and I used the moment to pull her closer. It didn’t feel magical or special, however, I was comforted. 



After what felt like hours I pulled back. Cathy left her hand caressing my cheek, and I leaned into it, locking eyes with her.



We ultimately decided to sleep on the landing. Neither of us wanted to be in the open room much longer, and it'd be easier to hear someone or see shadows moving under the door if we did. There was nothing down there with us to worry about anyway. I told myself I was being paranoid; that I needed to stop trying to impress Catherine with my composure now that I’d lost it.



I dozed off to the white noise of flickering oil lamps and the stench of women's perfume. Unsure of what was to come.
