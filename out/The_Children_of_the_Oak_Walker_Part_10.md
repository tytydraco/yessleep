[\[Part 11\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1apagsz/the_children_of_the_oak_walker_part_11/)

*There were trees everywhere, tall and green, with rain dripping off the pine needles.*

*Something coarse lay under my hands, dozens of little bits that were sometimes sharp, sometimes smooth. The wind blew cold, the rain had me drenched to the bone, and I couldn’t see anything.*

*Stones crunched somewhere nearby, and I peered into the dark.*

*They stood a few yards off, just beyond the gray aura of my vision. Someone was watching me. Someone in khaki pants . . . and a black New Wilderness shirt.*

*I opened my mouth to ask who they were, but another voice interrupted.*

*“Kendra?”*

*Stunned, I looked around, only to realize the voice was mine. But it wasn’t my usual voice. It was someone else’s, another girl’s words that I didn’t recognize.*

*Out of nowhere, the figure charged, and I threw my hands up to shield myself with a frightened scream.*

“Hold her down!”

Horrible pain ripped through my skin, as if fingers of lava were digging into me without mercy. Blinding white light flooded my eyes from overhead, and the word spun in a hazy kaleidoscope of shapes and shadows. My mouth tasted awful, like blood and mud, the saliva dried up so that my tongue stuck to my teeth. The air stank of a strong, coppery smell, and a sickly-sweet aroma that made me think of the color black for some reason. A noise rose above everything, a terrible screeching sound, like that of a siren.

It took a moment for me to understand that the rapid-fire shrieks were coming from my aching throat.

“She’s bleeding too much, we have to put the tourniquet back on.” A woman’s voice reverberated into my ears, speech coming to me in wavy intonations as though it were echoing off water.

“I’m not leaving more of that stuff in there.” A man hissed back, and there were hazy shapes hovering over me now, round faces that I couldn’t make out, covered in little blue squares.

“Pressure’s dropping fast.” Another woman’s voice broke through the din, sharp but calm, and my insides prickled with a cold touch. “Someone get me another unit of plasma.”

A slice of cold pricked beneath my skin, and the resulting spasm of agony forced me to screw my eyes shut, unable to stop the cries that ripped themselves from my lungs. Every muscle I had contorted on their own, causing the hands holding me to slip and slide on a hot, sticky substance.

“Hold her still, or I’ll end up hitting an artery!”

More hands obeyed the second woman’s command, but before I could draw another breath in between gasps of pain, the shadows pulled me under.

*I ran as fast as I could go, my sneakers crunching on the gravel, terrifying screams echoing through the woods behind me. Someone else sprinted not far ahead, another figure with khaki pants, and a corduroy jacket, leading me down the opposite side of a grassy embankment. I couldn’t see his face for how fast he moved, but something about the person felt familiar, warm, safe.*

*Lightning cracked through the sky, and I stumbled, chest high grass rushing up to meet me.*

*The man caught the hood of my coat and yanked me to my feet, his shout almost drowned out by the furious booms of the storm overhead. “Stick with me, come on.”*

A nasty tug in my arm brought a groan out of me, as if someone were dragging a piece of string through my veins.

“We need more anesthesia, the morphine is wearing off too fast.” Blue eyes blinked down at me, bloodshot with exhaustion or sadness I couldn’t tell, a male tone coming from beneath the cloth surgical mask.

“She can’t take any more, we’re over the safe limit right now.” A flash of blonde hair flicked through my field of vision, and two fingers pressed to my neck.

“Just do it.” A head floated by, with a shiny gray thing covered in smeary red held aloft. “Give her another dose, before she comes up off this table.”

Again, the cold pokes attacked me, cutting, biting, hurting all over. I cried, gritted my teeth, and screamed when it got to be too much, but for some reason, the voices wouldn’t stop. No words came to me, my throat raw and throbbing, the air barely making it past my lips.

Darkness closed in once more, merciful fog that dulled the pain and shut out the light.

*I stood in a big open concrete windowsill, the frigid rain pouring down, the angry wind howling just outside. Hot tears flooded down my cheeks, and I could smell something metallic on my clothes, felt it drying between my fingers. Thunder boomed, and from the gloom outside, a shadow strode closer, enormous, towering over the trees.*

*A head wrapped in vines appeared from the dark, with no eyes, nose, or mouth, and my mind swam in a chorus of whispers.*

*“Maddie, go!” The man’s voice called from somewhere below me.*

*Thunder roared, and a bolt of lightning streaked down from the sky as my feet left the ledge.*

A heavy weight pushed the air through my sore windpipe, and I choked down a breath.

“Pulse is back.” The man behind the surgical mask sighed, as if he’d just run a mile, and someone briefly gave my left hand a squeeze. “Jamie, keep her head still. She’s not going to like this.”

Sticky fingers clasped the side of my head, and a blonde blur floated over my face, a rough and flat object sliding between my teeth.

“Keep looking at me.” Woman number one’s green eyes set off bells in my head, and something about her made me think of a boxer poster and the scent of oranges. “Just breathe slow, and bite down. Deep breath in.”

All the hands tightened their grip on me, and searing torment blazed through my upper chest.

I ground my teeth on the rough material and held my breath to keep from sobbing. Why did they keep hurting me? I just wanted it to stop.

“Come on, come on . . . I got it!” The second woman exclaimed in triumph.

I felt myself go slack, and gratefully retreated into the safety of my subconscious.

*Blackness, cold and deafening enveloped me.*

*“Your flesh is your weakness.” A harsh whisper rasped in my ear, as if the person speaking were right beside me. “I can break you. I can mold you. You need only give in to the inevitable.”*

*Lightning peeled, and for a split second, I saw it.*

*An enormous head sat level with mine, faceless, with bark and vines interwoven where the eyes, nose, and mouth should have been. Twigs arrayed its jagged scalp like a crown, and its bark shone with a dull gray hue in the gloom. The longer we stared at each other, the more I felt something deep within my mind, a primal urge to take a step forward, to reach my hand out, to let it pick me up in its huge four-fingered hand and carry me away.*

*To carry me home.*

*Home, deep among the trees, where the light never reached, and the rain was warm forever.*

*I lifted one hand, ready to take the plunge, knowing it was still there even though I couldn’t see it in the abyssal shadow.*

*“Don’t listen to it!”*

*A girl’s desperate pleas rang out behind me, and I turned int time to see the weak beam of a flashlight, and illuminated by it, a face.*

*She looked to be about my age, wearing a black polo shirt under a forest green rain jacket, her long auburn hair tied back in a functional ponytail. An Armalite rifle hung from her shoulder, the grimy bolt locked to the rear on an empty magazine. Mud and black spatters of some unknown substance covered her khaki pant legs, her clothes soaked through. I could smell the girl from where I stood, a strong mix of burned cordite and hot metal, as if she’d walked through a fire. Her blue eyes shimmered with tears, and the look on her pale face was one of regret, one of loneliness . . . one of grief.*

*“It’s a lie.” She pointed into the darkness, at the thing which waited behind me now, her tears flowing like crystalline streams over her rather pretty face. “Don’t listen to it. It killed Mark.”*

*Swallowing hard, I forced out a word, my voice tired and strained in the void. “W-Who are you?”*

*The girl’s face crumpled into a sob, and she shook her head, walking slowly past me toward the hidden being. “Lost.”*

*“What do you mean?” Confused and terrified, I watched as her flashlight beam lit up the towering figure, the being crouched on one knee like a child examining its toys. “What are you doing?”*

*She turned, and looked back at me with a resigned, heartbroken shrug. “Waiting.”*

*Four huge gray fingers plummeted out of the gloom and scooped her up, the girl vanishing without so much as a scream.*

*My heart skipped a beat, and I took a frightened step back. The air turned bitter, and I tried to suck in a gasp, only to feel my lungs contract in a poisoned twitch. I felt flakes of ash on my skin, though I couldn’t see the fires, and tasted tangy chemicals on the wind.*

*“Breathe.” A soft baritone voice echoed softly from the shadows, and a second light appeared.*

*This one shone brighter, warmer, a yellowish flame inside an old kerosene lantern. It was held aloft by a man who stood off to my right, wearing a cobalt-yellow chemical suit, with the protective hood lowered, and his gas mask removed. He was tall, with short-cropped gray hair and luminous silver eyes that arrested mine like beams from a lighthouse. A number had been emblazoned on his suit, 036, in bold black letters, but other than that, I could see no other label or name tag. But I knew him, I realized.*

*I remembered him from somewhere else, somewhere before the pain, the dark.*

*The man smiled, a gentle, fatherly grin, with a twinkle in his eyes like a shining star. “You’ve done well. Come, filia mea, we have a long way to go.”*

*He held out his other hand, still shrouded in the black rubber gloves of his suit.*

*At his words, I felt an expansion in my chest, as if a bubble were moving up from my stomach, up through my chest, up, up, up . . .*

My eye fluttered open, and I coughed.

Everything ached, a throbbing under my skin that made any movement excruciating, but I rolled over and hung my face off the side of the bed. Something stuck in my throat, blocked the air, and an animalistic side of me wanted it out, no matter what.

I winced, gagged, and foul goo slid over my tongue.

Wave after wave poured forth, sour mucous flecked with spots of red blood, until I coughed it all out. Just the effort to throw up made my torso blaze with fire, but I couldn’t stop. My stomach emptied, my lungs drew in a deep breath as if they been sandblasted clean, and I rested my forehead against the mattress, too exhausted to push myself upright.

“There you go.” A hand rubbed my back, and Dr. O’Brian’s face came into view, lined with wrinkles, but with a jaded smile, nonetheless. “Just breathe through it. We want all that nasty stuff out.”

It was dark in the clinic, only a few lights on overhead. The air smelled metallic, like fresh blood, along with tangy chlorine from whoever had been cleaning it up. Various machines hummed and beeped around the drawn white curtains of my bed, but I could hear the muffled groans of other wounded in the bunks around me. Feet shuffled over the tiles not far away, hushed female voices revealing where nurses tended to their charges. Far from comforting, the atmosphere gave me an oppressive, claustrophobic sensation, as if I would pull aside the bed curtain to find a mountain of severed limbs and wheezing lungs stacked to the ceiling. My own puking sounded like cannon fire in the stillness, but my misery overpowered any kind of self-restraint.

Spitting onto the floor, I winced at how my throat rubbed like sandpaper. “Water.”

She sat in a chair on the opposite side of the vomit, and Dr. O’Brian cradled my head with one hand to pour some cool water into my mouth from a bottle. It tasted like the sludge, thanks to my mouth being less than clean, but it felt too good for me to care.

“Are you hurting anywhere?” Daubing the corners of my mouth with a napkin, Dr. O’Brian placed a hand on my forehead, and then grasped my left wrist to check my pulse. “Any sharp pains, any movement inside?”

I did my best to relax, to take stock of myself through touch, but it was as if alarm bells of soreness were going off under my flesh. “Nothing moving. It burns though. All over.”

“We can’t put you on too many painkillers until the rest of the drugs from surgery wear off. You got a pretty heavy dosage, not that it helped things much.” Her hands moved to the right side of my face, and I felt the cotton bandages there for the first time, medical tape holding gauze over my skin.

*Hang on . . . why can’t I see out of my right eye?*

Confused, I moved to raise my right arm, but it flared with pain.

O’Brian stopped me, grimacing as she placed a hand on my wrist. “Don’t. We had to do some rather serious work on the right side of your body, so its best if you move as little as possible. Those stitches need time to heal.”

Fighting a surge of panic, I gulped. “What’s wrong with my eye?”

Her shoulders sagged, and O’Brian scooted her metal folding chair closer to the bed. “I need you to promise me you’ll remain calm about this, alright? We’re working on solutions as we speak, but I need you to stay positive, and most of all, not overreact. Can you promise me that?”

*Not when you say it like that.*

“I promise.” I shut my good eye so she couldn’t see the lie in my gaze and sucked down another lungful of air.

“You’ve been infected by some kind of . . . growth.” Dr. O’Brian shifted uneasily in her chair, a clipboard on her lap that she began to leaf through as she went. “It spreads primarily through sub-dermal perforation, with shorter, deeper roots under the muscle tissue. We were able to extract the most active elements of it, but the base root system of the parasite remains too close to vital organs for us to reach. Thankfully, we stopped it from spreading at a rapid rate. However, we have to remove it within the next week or so, otherwise it will contaminate other parts of your body.”

“What does that mean?” Refusing to look at her, I kept my left eye shut, hoping to fall back asleep and wake up to this all being a bad dream.

She paused for a moment and cleared her throat. “We patched up the lacerations in your intestinal wall, but if it isn’t properly removed, the infection could spread to your kidneys, stomach, and uterus, not to mention the rest of the internal organs and spinal cord. One of the subdermal sprouts moved rather high up your body, but we intercepted it above your collar bone before it could reach your nervous system. Unfortunately, it seems to have released some heavy toxins into your bloodstream, and somehow your right eye was affected.”

“Am . . . am I blind?” I almost whispered it, too scared to give the words volume for fear it might manifest such things.

“No.” She patted my shoulder, though I could sense the doubt in her voice. “Like I said, we’re working on solutions. Your eye just needs some time, that’s all. I’m sure it will be fine in a week or two.”

And if it’s not, what then?

My stomach rolled at that thought, but nothing else came up. “So, you’re going to remove the rest of it, right?”

Dr. O’Brian looked down at her notes, but I could tell she wasn’t reading from how her lips pursed.

“Doc?” I tried to sit up, but my right arm betrayed me, the fingers tingling as if they hadn’t been moved in a while.

She put a hand to my shoulder and pressed me back down to the mattress. “You need to rest. The more you exert yourself, the slower any healing will be.”

“Tell me.” With my heart thumping against my aching ribs, I begged her, clutched her hand in as tight a grip as I could muster. “Whatever it is, I have to know. Please, just say it.”

Dr. O’Brian’s face fell, and she shut her eyes as if in dread of what she had to do. “We don’t have the equipment needed to extricate the rest of the growth without it dumping mutagenic cytotoxins into your system. Every time we remove pieces of the foreign material, it leeches more of the toxin, which causes damage in the tissue or nerve endings nearby. If these were normal times, I’d have you life-flighted to Columbus or even D.C, but . . .”

*But we’re trapped here.*

Tears welled in my eyes, and I sniffled to keep them at bay, staring up at the ceiling. “The others. Chris and Jamie. Are they alright?”

Half turning in her chair, Dr. O’Brian pointed to a cot set up in the center aisleway, where a familiar blonde head lay under a wool blanket, another figure slumped in a swivel chair with a jacket across his chest to keep him warm. “They both insisted on aiding me in the surgery. Bit out of the usual, but then considering everything . . . well, it’s been an unusual day, hasn’t it? I tried to get them to take some time off while I sat up to observe you, but they refused to leave your side. Lansen was in tears half the night.”

*At least they’re alive.*

I drank in the sight of Chris’s handsome face as he slept, a pain in my heart that no scalpel could have made. He was so close, yet with everything that I knew, he may as well be a million miles away. Jamie’s blanket rose and fell in steady breaths, and I wanted to hug her, to tell her everything would be okay, but how could I?

Everything wasn’t okay. I wasn’t okay.

Maybe I never would be.

“Hey.”

My vision flooded with a renewed assault of despair, but I looked up to see Dr. O’Brian’s eyes on mine, a gleam of pity in them.

“We’re going to fix this, alright? I’ve got my whole team working on it. Ark River is brewing every remedy they know of, and for whatever it’s worth, their entire camp has been praying for hours. We’re all behind you, Hannah. Just keep fighting.”

Choking back a sob, I let her hand hold mine, grateful for the human contact, for anything to keep me from being swallowed up by the hopelessness in my chest. Instead, I focused on the blue hospital gown covering me and tried not to think about the bandages around my ribs, my stomach, and over most of my right arm.

*Wait . . . the key.*

Tension slammed through me, and I let go of her hand to grope around my neck in vain for the fiber cord. No, it wasn’t in its usual place. The key was gone, gone along with the rest of my clothes, which meant someone had taken it, and there were only two other people who had known about it besides me.

“Doc?” I knotted my fingers in a tangle of the sheets to keep my voice on an even keel. “What happened to all my stuff? Like, my clothes, my gear?”

She jerked a thumb at Jamie and Chris. “They took most of it off you. I think Dekker has it all stored somewhere.”

My face burned at what that implied, and I glanced at Chris, embarrassed enough to melt through the floor. “He . . . he *saw* everything?”

“Sweetheart, we thought we were going to lose you.” Dr. O’Brian gave a small laugh that seemed more sad than happy. “Trust me, he was too busy to stop and take in the scenery. I’ve never seen him so worried.”

*The first time he saw me naked, and it was with black roots growing out of my stomach. Great. So much for being sexy.*

“So, you didn’t happen to see a necklace? Like, a small metal key on a string?” I scanned the room with my one eye as best I could, but it was hard to do lying down.

“If it was on you, Dekker probably has it.” Rising from her chair, Dr. O’Brian set the water bottle on a little wooden nightstand and gave my left shoulder a reassuring squeeze. “I’ll get something to help you sleep. Now that you’ve cleared most of the mucous from your lungs, it should be easier to rest. In a few hours, we’ll start experimenting with detoxification procedures.”

She swept out of the alcove, and away down the ward, leaving me in the weak glow of the dimmed overhead lights.

Biting my lip, I shut my eye, and let out a shuddery breath. I had to be strong. Chris and Jamie needed me, and there was a good chance they had the key, that I could easily get it back from them. Chris might not be the spy. My condition might be curable. I just needed to stay positive.

“It’s going to be fine.” I whispered to myself, praying for the daylight to come so I could hear it from Chris or Jamie’s lips instead of my own. At least then, I might have believed it. “This is fixable.”

Alone with my thoughts, I tried not to think about how my skin tickled under the bandages in an eerie, sentient way, or how humiliating it was that Chris had seen me in such a vulnerable state, or the fact that I might have just handed the key of some great unknown secret to an ELSAR spy. Worst of all, I wanted to shut out the lingering memory of that strange, hooded figure in the woods, and the words he’d snarled into my ear as he attacked me.

*I already own you.*
