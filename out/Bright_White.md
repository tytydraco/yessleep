Please bear with me while I explain some of the background first. I promise, it’s relevant. I’m posting this with the hope that there’s someone out there who can help. 

Bianca always pointed out that this is truly the old world. We met on the yachts, years back, and she she’d been staying with me while she looks for a job here. She’s from a different, “newer” country and the age of things around here fascinated her. Like many of our generation, I too like old stuff, antiques, historic buildings, heirlooms. Or used to. But I have come to realize that there are dangers to old places. 

There’s a square around here that’s nicknamed bright white. The name refers to an old tale about the lake in the middle of the square. 

According to this tale, the lake used to connect the realm of the living, Midgard, with the realm of the dead, Hel. On it’s shores stood a sacrificial altar, dedicated to the the goddess Hel is named after. A druid watched over the altar, bringing Hel sacrifices at all the major holidays. In return, Hel sent a black Ox to the Druid twice a year, at Ostara and at Mabon, to help him plough his fields and bring in the harvest. When the Druid died, he was replaced by a Christian priest, who stopped the worship to the old gods and with it the sacrifices to Hel. When Ostara came around, Hel sent her black Ox. But instead of helping the priest plough his fields, the Ox killed the priest and dragged him down the lake. 

Years later, the government commissioned an Ox statue to stand at the shores of the lake. According to the artist’s descendants, it‘s hollow belly contains a box with list of people who opposed the regime that had commissioned the statue. 

Mike, who grew up around here, tells a different story, the one the locals believe. According to him, the artist, who designed and build the Ox statue, was of the old religion. He built it as a new altar to Hel. And ever since it was finished, Hel has been demanding her dues again. The locals, still familiar with the old ways, and aware of the legend, started leaving gifts again. 

Obviously, I had my doubts. But then he showed me the articles. It wasn’t every year, but it was always on Ostara or Mabon, and no body has ever been found. Suspected drownings, unexplained disappearances. Which would be understandable if this was a decent sized lake or had currents or anything really, but I’ve seen pools bigger than that! As for why the government doesn’t remove the ox: not only would that require them to believe the legend, they are simply not allowed to. At some point, the park, the statue and the lake became protected monuments. 

It took me a while to be able to write the next part, but I need help. Mabon is coming up and we‘re no closer to finding a solution. 

Mike’s tale had made us curious, but Bianca and I were never religious or superstitious, so we didn’t really believe him. This year, the weather on Ostara was beautiful and after sharing a bottle of wine, we had the brilliant idea to not just get another one, but to drink it at the lake and see if we could spot anything supernatural. We got there about an hour before sunset and set up on the opposite shore of the statue, in the grass just above the tiny beach section. As we were drinking our wine and nibbling some olives, the sun slowly started setting behind the houses on our right. 

Just as the last rays started disappearing behind the buildings, we heard laughter from the other side. A group of kids approached the statue, giggling, clearly daring each other to take the gifts that had been left there. I looked at Bianca: “I’m not sure this is a good idea. Should we say something? Maybe we should leave.” Laughingly, she shook her head: “Really? Do you believe that stuff now? Besides, even if it were true, it wasn’t us. Chill. We will leave when it gets cold.” She was right, of course. I didn’t really believe in any gods, old or new. And while kids messing with things wasn’t cool, it was also harmless. Still, I couldn’t shake the feeling of unease as I watched the biggest kid take whatever had been left at the foot of the statue and run off, his friends chasing after him. 

And then everything shifted. Do you know that purple, hazy glow you sometimes see from the corner of your eyes? The one you immediately forget about it? The one that tells you something isn’t quite right? Yes, that one. The houses were gone, we were surrounded by fields and trees and everything was glowing in that hazy purple shade. The grass around us seemed taller. And there was no ox statue. I turned my head to look at Bianca, to ask her if she could see it too. But she wouldn’t look at me and just kept staring at the black ox walking towards her through the silvery water. I opened my mouth to scream, I tried to grab her, but found I couldn’ move at all. I still don’t know what paralyzed me, if it was something supernatural or simply fear, but I just stood there unmoving, not even blinking, while I watched as the Ox dragged her into the lake. 

When I came back to my senses, lying on the grass, everything was as it had been before. No purple glow, no fields, just houses. A large stone ox on the opposite shore. But no Bianca.

Obviously, I tried to tell myself it had been a prank or a hallucination. But when Bianca didn’t come home the next day, I had to inform the police and her parents. I didn’t tell them about the purple glow or any of the things I had seen. I said I must have fallen asleep and when I woke up, she was gone. No one would have believed me anyway. Officially, she’s a simply another missing person, one of many in this city. The only person who knows the truth is Mike, but in the five months since, we have failed to come up with a way to bring her back. 

I need help. Is there a way to bargain with the goddess Hel? Is there a way to bring back people from the place Hel? Mabon is approaching, the veil will be thin and this will be our best chance. Please, if there’s someone out there who has experienced something similar or is more familiar with Hel, what can I do? I need to get my best friend back!
