A little while ago when I was 10 something weird happened. It was 5/6/13. I was in my mother's car sleeping before school because it was early. I had usually gotten there around 7:00. My school opened at 8:00, so I had time to sleep. I had a dream.

It wasn't your usually happy rainbows and unicorns dream it was a horror dream. I never really thought I was the type of person to jot down my dreams after I woke up, but I immediately did after it. This dream was different though. It was personal. Let me go ahead and tell you about the dream.

I was in my house with my brother Jamon (M13) I saw a monster which I cannot describe. I don't remember everything because it was a dream. Allow me to continue. I was going downstairs when I saw this monster. It was very dark though because there was a blackout. When I saw the monster I immediately told my brother. He checked then said nothing was there. He couldn't see them but I could. He told me that I was hallucinating and being dumb. But I'm genuinely scared of these "hallucinations", so he goes to get the sheet that I wanted. I went with him because I was too scared to be alone. Then somehow I end up in a car. My mother's car to be specific. The very car I was sleeping in. Every detail is exact. This is where I was sleeping. But I didn't see my mother nor my sleeping body, for I didn't realize that I was dreaming. It all seemed natural. I don't know how I ended up in the car, but I was there.

I was in the car with a monster outside of the car which I felt familiar with. It was odd. It was like the king of all monsters. I used my brother because I knew he couldn't see the monsters, so I used him to see if they were real or not. But my brother seemed to see the king of monsters. I was so scared, but the king of monster felt so familiar. Like I'd seen him or her before. It was scary. I didn't know how to kill the monsters, so I was just sitting there outside my school in my car with my brother.

The king of monster was about to attack me. Somehow I knew all of its moves, but this one was different. He used a different move that even I can't explain. He attacked me, then he was somehow in the car, I messed him up. I knocked this dude out like he was a plushie no not a plushie a pillow. Like a marshmallow I got him I did a lot to him. I'm gonna tell you. I didn't have powers so I resorted to the only thing I did have, a brain. I flipped him upside down. I punched the freak out of his balls and I took him pants off and I punched even more, (don't worry he had underwear on.) He then used another power that I wasn't aware of.

He morphed into the body of a cop. He could go into people's bodies. I started punching him in his head over and over. Killing him or so I thought. I somehow beheaded him during the time I was beating him up and forcing him to never have babies ever again. I just knew something was up. It couldn't be that easy to kill him. In the front of the car where you could change the temperatures a screen popped up. It was a list of monsters inside the car. I somehow killed them all.

The cops were there too. Though they were a little cartoony. I threw the head of the king to them. I also threw his body. His head just dropped because I apparently sucked at throwing and his body turned into millions upon millions of tiny little spiders. They all picked up his head carrying it. Around this time his head turned back to what it was originally, the king of monsters. The spiders carried the head up a pipe and he said " I will come back for you" then  I woke up. I don't know what those words triggered in me, but it was serious.

It sent a shockwave through my body. Before you start to comment, no this wasn't your ordinary nightmare, because after that he started appearing in all of my nightmares. Saying " It was me" every time. Then pressing a button to end my dream. It ended after a couples of years. I've been scot free until now. I had him in my dreams, but instead of saying " It was me" He now said "I've got you. I won't let go until you're finished" I don't know what that meant. Finished what?  If you had a similar experience you want to confirm. The king looked like a tall man with a a white mask. Similar to Slenderman, but not at all him. Thanks.
