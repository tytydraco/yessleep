Gray propped my arm over his neck to hold me straight as we walked back through the trees. My consciousness slipped a few more times, but my body continued to move on autopilot despite it.

 

After a few minutes, my strength returned enough for me to be able to walk unaided. I wanted to run, to get out of this place as quickly as possible, but that wasn’t an option.

 

Fortunately for us, our path out of the woods was relatively straightforward. We didn’t get lost, and there were no more ghastly interruptions. We made it out in about 45 minutes.

 

We reached our respective cars and began to split off. This day finally seemed to be over.

 

“Hold on, Cole.” Gray said, breaking the long silence. “I can’t let you drive like this.”

 

“I’m okay. Seriously.” I answered.

 

“Nah, you’re not. Get in the car.”

 

“I’m not just gonna leave my car here, Gray.”

 

“Your eye is nearly fucking swollen shut and you look like hell. Come on. We’ll come back for it. There’s somewhere we gotta go anyway.” He said, demanding.

 

“...Fine.” I relented.

 

We drove down the dark country road. I still fought the urge to pass out. Gray was probably right about being in no state to drive. He took a few calls, it was difficult to focus on what he was saying, but a few of them seemed to be letting people know that he found me.

 

After about a half hour’s drive, we pulled up to a somewhat meager local pizza joint. The name ‘914 Pizza’ laid out inelegantly on a sign at the top.

 

“What are we doing here?” I asked as we stepped out of the car and strolled up to the front. Gray didn’t answer, just ushering me inside.

 

“Yo, why are the floors so fuckin’ filthy up in here!?” Gray yelled out into the nearly empty restaurant, louder than my head could handle. “Where you at, boy!?”

 

Out from the kitchen stepped a pale, thin man with a long, dirty blond mess of hair and beard.

 

“Well ho-lee shit!” The man called out, practically hopping the counter to get to us. A broad smile plastered over his face. “Let me grab the mop for you, old man. Get to work.”

 

The two exchanged a firm handshake and a quick hug. It seemed like it had been a while. Then the man turned to me and offered a far more formal handshake.

 

“Benji. Nice to meet you.”

 

I responded with my name and a smile, accepting the handshake. Looking at him, beyond his general dishevelment, his eyes were extremely kind and disarming.

 

“That looks like it hurts, god damn.” He remarked, gesturing to my eye.

 

“Its seen better.” I said, not noticing my own pun at first.

 

“She’s my new partner.” Gray jumped in. He didn’t say rookie this time.

 

“Shit!” Benji exclaimed, then muttered “I’m so sorry.” In mocked concern.

 

I snickered and gave my eyebrows a subtle raise as if to say “You have no idea.”

 

“Oh knock it off and grab us a slice, will ya?” Gray reprimanded.

 

“Yes, detective.” Benji answered with a dramatic salute before walking off. Gray and I sat in a corner booth.

 

“So you come here often then?” I deduced.

 

“You could say that.” Gray answered.

 

“Why did you bring me here?”

 

“Because neither of us have eaten all day and I’m fucking starving... And because earlier you asked why I came here from New York.”

 

“You came here for the pizza?” I questioned.

 

“Nah, I brought the pizza here. This is my place.”

 

“You’re kidding. You own this restaurant?”

 

“Well I used to. Now it’s Benji’s, he’s my protégé. But for a long time, yeah. Used to run it with my man Obi. We had a place back in Yonkers before that.”

 

“I’m... so confused.”

 

“He got me off the streets, Obi did. I was a mess, I was in all kinds of shit. 17 years old, homeless, living in the dump, high off my ass. Obi ran a pizza joint in the city. One night, I sneak in to rob the place after hours. But Obi was still there, he catches me. Coulda sent me to jail. Hell, many folks down there would’ve killed me. Instead he gave me a job. I mopped the floors and took out the trash. He let me stay in a room upstairs. I got food, I got money. He said as long as I got clean, I had a place with him. So I did. Never touched another needle.”

 

“Good man, Obi.”

 

“The best. So anyways, few years pass. He teaches me how to cook. He shows me all the recipes. It becomes, like, our thing. One day he says he wants to move over here because he’s got family. So I say “Let’s go, pops.” And off we go. Open up shop, call it 914 for Yonkers. Bringin’ a little New York to the east coast.”

 

“That’s... wow. I love it... How does becoming a detective fit into that?”

 

“Well...” Gray began to explain, but his cheery disposition faded. “It’s funny, I lived in the city all those years. I seen a lotta bad people. But it wasn’t until I got out here that I saw real evil... There was a serial killer in this town. 15 or 20 years ago now. A bad, bad man. Like you wouldn’t believe. One night Obi was... being Obi, trying to help a kid, and...”

 

Gray stopped for a moment and clicked his tongue before continuing, “After that, the restaurant wasn’t the same, and I wanted somethin’ different. I wanted to do what he did for me, and what he died doing. Just, help out, you know? ‘Cause I shouldn’t be alive. I’m alive ‘cause of him. So I gotta do right by him. That’s it.”

 

There wasn’t much else to say after that. Initially I was mad that he brought me here, under the somewhat false pretense that it would be important. But it was important in its own way. I was glad that he shared his story with me. And to be completely honest, the pizza was unbelievable.

 

Gray dropped me off at my place and I wobbled my way inside, ready to crash hard on my bed. But first I wanted to see the damage. I moved to the bathroom mirror to take a look at myself.

 

It was a bit rough. My eye was completely purple and shut by this point. There were a few scrapes and bruises. Nothing dire but I doubted I’d be able to take another selfie for the next little while.

 

One more thing was nagging at me as I looked at my face. Why was Donaldson afraid of me? Why did Harmony look at me like that? Aside from being battered, I looked otherwise like myself, I thought. Fairly unremarkable.

 

I grabbed an ice pack and I hopped online to check things out. Eight new followers on my experimental account. Along with three comments on my most recent selfie. The first was a slur. Lovely. Saw that coming. The second was three heart eye emojis. So I had that going for me. The third one said, “Whoa I love your eyes, are they really like that or is it Photoshopped?”

 

I was confused. What was wrong with my eyes? I looked at the selfie I posted. The lighting was bad and it was hard to see much at first, until I looked closer. I turned my brightness all the way up and squinted at the screen.

 

“What the fuck?” I said out loud in my dark room.

 

I couldn’t believe it... My eyes were two different colors. My right eye was greenish hazel, like it had always been, but my left eye was now blue. Very blue. Was it just a trick of the light? It had to be, I thought. But then another thought crept into my mind.

 

I’ve seen blue eyes like that so many times these past few days. The image of Harmony’s face inches away from mine was stuck in my head. Her left eye was gone, but her right eye was still the exact same blue.

 

“No.” I said dismissively. It’s not. It can’t be. How would it be possible? What would that even mean?

 

I left that page and moved over to check my messages and it all dropped from my mind once I saw that I finally got a response about the deleted video.

 

“I gotchu fam. All her videos and streams are archived here.” The message read, along with a link to a channel on some bootleg YouTube clone. Unsettling, but in this case, efficient.

 

At first I wasn’t sure what to look for on this channel of hundreds, if not thousands of videos. Fortunately, the uploads were all chronological, so all I had to do was cross-reference these uploads with her official uploads to find which ones don’t match up. Maybe there was more than one deleted video.

 

I found the one in the infamous red top, and then to be thorough I combed through the rest. I managed to find two more. I began with the earliest one, dated three years ago.

 

“Hello my lovelies, who’s ready for some story time?” She began, with her beaming smile as she sat in front of the camera on a small leather sofa. “I got this comment from someone on an earlier video, and they were basically saying that they don’t trust medication. Meaning, like, mental health related medication. And they listed their reasons, and that’s fair enough, but it got me thinking that maybe I should talk about my own stuff. Maybe just to offer my own insight, if you’re worried about medication and how it could affect you and things like that. To add on to that, all proceeds from this video will be going to a mental health awareness charity which I’ll discuss more in a bit... But to start with my own experience, I’m actually on several medications right now, believe it or not.”

 

Initially the video didn’t seem to be related. I could see her deleting it due to the personal nature of the content. Maybe it hurt her brand, or maybe she just preferred to keep that side of her a secret.

 

She talked about her experience with anti-depressants for a few minutes. I admit I was engaged with what she was saying. I always was. She had that way about her. Nothing about the girl in the video was the same as the girl in the woods. Not a single thing.

 

“The other main medication I’m on is for seizures.” She explained. “I used to, and still sometimes do, get really bad seizures and really bad migraines. The anti-depressants actually also help with the migraines to an extent by the way. And this leads to the funny story of the day, because I don’t want this to be all serious.”

 

She took a swig of water and then searched for her story’s starting point. “You guys know I don’t believe in... like... astrology, or ghosts, or god, or premonitions or anything like that. I did have to go to Christian schools as a kid but I hated it. So anyways, I’m not saying that what I’m about to say is any of that superstitious stuff. It’s just funny... I don’t remember when the first time it happened was, but it became a thing in my family and at school as a kid where any time I would have a really bad migraine, something bad would happen, like, that day or the next day. An accident, or someone getting injured, or a pet dying, grandparent, etc. – I’m not saying it was funny at the time. God. That makes me sound like such an asshole. No, it was awful. But any time I’d be in class and I’d feel a migraine coming on, everyone would act all afraid and give me shit. They literally started talking quietly and massaging my head and neck to try and get it to stop before it started. I’d be like “I’m sorry guys, it’s happening.” And they would get all dramatic. Even the teachers started getting in on it. It was wild. I got called Carrie sometimes... But yeah, these headaches sucked. It would be like a fireplace poker right behind my eye, every time.”

 

Her cadence was so casual and friendly, but I couldn’t help feeling unsettled. My mind could only draw connections. The fireplace poker behind the eye. That was exactly how I’d been feeling for the past few days. Her story about the headaches being some kind of harbinger of terrible things, of course it was just a silly series of coincidences, but what if it wasn’t? And what does it mean if those headaches never go away?

 

I decided it was time to do some unpacking. This was all too much to keep in my head all at once, and Gray was right about one thing: Physical paper does feel better.

 

We had our own evidence board at the office, but there were several things I couldn’t reasonably put on there without my sanity being called into question. I hung my big cork board on the wall and dug out my simple supplies: A pack of sharpie, multiple packs of index cards, and a gargantuan tube of thumbtacks. I omitted getting a classic spool of red thread, it never seemed all that practical to me. Also I bought the thumbtacks online and they ended up being the flat, metal kind which you can’t tie thread around, so we do without.

 

Dreams. Left Eye. Missing Goats. Candle Caine. Headaches. Fake Videos. I wrote out the strangest pieces vaguely on index cards and hung them up. Hoping that maybe if I stared at them long enough, it would all make sense. But that didn’t seem to be happening right now, so I moved on to the second deleted video.

 

“Hello my lovelies, who’s ready for some story time?” Harmony greeted once again. This video was from only ten months ago, but the set up was largely the same. She began with some general life updates, before coming forth with a question.

 

“Have you guys ever had a reoccurring nightmare?”

 

I shuddered at the question... Not until very recently.

 

“I just had this dream last night, and it reminded me of a nightmare I used to have as a kid almost every night. There was this-“

 

I knew exactly what she was about to say. I mouthed her words as she said them.

 

“-Man in a hat.”

 

I paused the video and sat back in my chair. My breathing began to accelerate and my body physically shivered, but I talked myself down. No. It’s a common nightmare. The Hat Man. Lots of people talk about this phenomenon. It’s nothing.

 

“I would be paralyzed in my bed, and I’d see him come out of the shadows towards me. He always held out this weird looking fancy cup, or chalice, or goblet I guess you could call it... It was gold, I think.”

 

My slim justification went up in smoke just like that. To deny it any more would be ridiculous. It was the same dream. The same man, and the same chalice. The more she spoke, the more I knew it to be true. But it couldn’t be. This was not how the real world works. This was not reality. Those words replayed over and over in my mind like a desperate incantation. A hopeless cling to the skin of what I knew this world to be, as it spun me out of control. Not reality. Not reality. Not reality.

 

One video left. The one she posted right before leaving on that fake trip. After the Candle Caine game. I shuddered at the thought of what this one could be. I pressed play.

 

To her fans’ credit, they were right about the red top. It was stunning on her. Her wardrobe, make-up, and overall production design undeniably got more refined and sophisticated over the years. But she was still her. For now.

 

“Hello my lovelies, today it is our monthly unboxing video!” She beamed with excitement. “As I always say, you all NEVER have to send me anything. Seriously. But I appreciate every single one of you who sends things in, it means the world to me, and these days are my absolute favorite days of the month. So let’s get into it!”

 

The first five boxes or so were relatively normal. Some plushies, a signed copy of her favorite game, a coloring set, things like that. Then she came to an unmarked box. Rectangular, about a foot in length and maybe 8 inches wide and thick. She apologized for not being able to credit the gifter, and then she began to open it.

 

She went through several expressions as she looked inside, settling on happy but curious.

 

“This looks... fancy as hell. This looks expensive, who sent this?” She remarked. I felt dread consume me. I once again knew what was coming. I knew when she reached into the box what she was going to pull out. And I was right.

 

“Some kind of... medieval looking chalice? Oh my god, you guys... It’s heavy. This is like... real. What on earth? I feel like a queen with this thing, this is amazing. Thank you so much, whoever sent this. You better not have spent a lot on it, I would feel so bad. Please, if you’re watching, send me a private message, I want to know what the story is here.”

 

She giggled as she studied it in her hands. Then her brow began to furrow.

 

“Is this... from something? Is this from a game we played on stream? I feel like I’ve seen this. It reminds me so much of... something.”

 

I wanted to shout through the screen. Tell her to throw it away. Tell her to run. But I know she never did.

 

My hands were shaking and my head was throbbing. The chalice was real. That means the man in the hat must be real. He took her. He changed her into whatever she is now. That chalice had to be how he did it. Some kind of fucked up ritual. Who was he? What was he? Had he been planning this for her whole life? And why now does he come to me at night?

 

I tried my best to put it together, but it didn’t fit. How could this connect to Candle Caine? Candle Caine was an internet thing that just popped up this year, and that she happened upon at random, how could that relate to a dream from her childhood? It didn’t make sense.

 

I couldn’t hang on any longer. I had to go to sleep, as much as I was dreading it. As much as everything seemed to be going a mile a minute. I had to stop.

 

The Man in the Hat. I wrote it on one more index card and stuck it to the cork board. Then I popped a few more painkillers and some melatonin and collapsed on my bed, falling into a deep sleep almost immediately. Then the dream began.

 

I stood at my bathroom mirror, looking deep into my reflection. Only I didn’t see me as I am now. I saw the old me. The me I fought so hard to change. I was afraid of her. She taunted me. I didn’t want to go back. But did I deserve to stay?

 

I held my eyes closed, praying that when I opened them I would see the real me again. But I didn’t. It was still the other one. I tried again, and it was the same. I tried a third time, and this time it finally wasn’t her.

 

It... wasn’t anyone. I had no reflection anymore. I looked in the mirror and saw no one. I was no one.

 

I stared and stared into the lack of me, then I felt my skin begin to bubble and stretch. My body began to change. My bones popped and morphed. I felt my muscles slide up and down into place under my skin. I began to panic. I couldn’t go back.

 

I put my hands to my face, trying to hold everything together. To force it not to change. But my fingers slid inside my skin. Slid through the muscle and tissue. I could feel my own skull. I could feel my eyes in their sockets underneath my eyelids. I could feel the roots of my teeth underneath my gums. It was all beginning to soften. I knew I couldn’t keep it together. I knew I couldn’t stay me anymore. With a subtle brush of my fingers against my teeth roots, I could make them fall out like they were nothing.

 

That’s what I began to do. Dislodging my back teeth one by one. It felt uncomfortable having them there. They had to go. Then I grabbed my front teeth in a handful and dropped them all, hearing their hollow clattering into the sink. I did the same with all my bottom teeth. Every last one had to go.

 

I sunk my hands deeper into my face. I sunk them inside my skull. It was all soft like putty now. I played with the strings on my back of my eyeballs and watched as they popped in and out of their sockets. Eventually I grabbed them both in one hand and yanked them out. I didn’t want them anymore. I didn’t want anything anymore. I would rather be nothing. I would rather be no one. I deserved to be no one. My body was wasted on me.

 

I raised one of my eyeballs to face myself so I could see what I had done. I saw a face of melting wax. The holes of my eyes and mouth stretched down and became cavernous voids. But my eye holes weren’t as empty as I thought. Deep in the two black abysses, I saw new eyes. Only they weren’t my eyes.

 

They were the most horrible eyes I had ever seen. Like every bad thing to ever exist lived inside of them.

 

I woke up screaming. Those eyes seared into my vision like an old TV. Quickly my screams turned to violent sobs. It all flooded out in a torrent. I couldn’t hold the pieces together any more.

 

I cried about it all. I cried about things I didn’t even know I was still holding on to. It was like one domino fell and then it all came crashing down. I cried until I ran out of tears.

 

My head hurt even worse today, and the respite of sleep was slim to none. I skipped my workout altogether and went straight for the coffee and painkillers. I put on my sunglasses when I went out and I didn’t plan on taking them off until I was back home in the dark.

 

“Jesus, Cole.” Gray remarked as he picked me up from my place.

 

“I know.” I curtly answered.

 

“You look like fuckin’ roadkill.”

 

“We have to go see Harmony’s mother again.” I said, ignoring his probably accurate jab.

 

“You wanna get your car first?”

 

“After.”

 

“Okay. What for? What did you get?”

 

I explained what I found in the videos as we drove. I thought about fabricating the whole thing to make it seem more tangible and plausible, but I decided to keep Gray in the loop for now. I did omit certain details, such as the dreams I’ve been having. Surprisingly Gray was fairly receptive to these bizarre findings... It made me think. He said he had seen weird things in this place before. I had to wonder how weird.

 

“So, what, you think this man she dreamed about was real?”

 

“If the chalice was real, then maybe. Maybe it was some kind of repressed memory... It has to be connected somehow.”

 

“This is pretty flimsy, Cole. It’s pretty out-there. I’ll go with you on it, but I need you back to reality. I need you to take a step back and take care of yourself a little bit, you know?”

 

“Yeah.” I answered, more dismissively than I intended.

 

We reached Evelyn’s house and knocked on the door. She opened, and for a moment I saw myself. She looked disheveled and sleep deprived. I could tell she had been crying. But of course she had.

 

“How are you holdin’ up, Evelyn?” Gray asked.

 

“How do you think?” She answered, gesturing vaguely at the world. “Any news? Please tell me there’s news.”

 

“I’m afraid we’re still looking.” I interjected. “But there may be something you can help us with.”

 

“Of course. Anything.”

 

“This might sound strange... Do you remember your daughter, as a child, ever mentioning a man in a wide brimmed hat?”

 

“Um...” She responded, puzzled at my question.

 

“Even if it was just a bad dream, do you remember anything like that she may have mentioned?”

 

“Oh. Well yeah, she used to have a nightmare about a shadow man in a hat when she was around 6 or 8. Sure, I remember that... I think that was just because she didn’t like nursery school.”

 

“How’s that?”

 

“She was afraid of going. She didn’t like it, she never liked the religious schools. And Father Whitley, he was a priest and did a lot of early bible lessons with the kids, and he wore this hat...”

 

“Whitley... The guy who runs the soup kitchen? ‘Blessings’ or whatever it was called?” I asked, trying to hide my shock.

 

“Yeah, him. The school closed down a long time ago, but he still comes to church.”

 

“Okay... So Father Whitley... did he ever take a special interest in Harmony?”

 

“Well... I suppose, but only because he was a friend of the family. Before Harmony was even born. He was a great guy. He was always very generous and patient with Harmony... You... You think he had something to with this?”

 

“We’re just covering all our bases.”

 

Evelyn began staggering back and beginning to cry. “I didn’t know. I didn’t think he would ever... I trusted him.”

 

Gray reached out and placed an arm on her shoulder. “Hey. It’s okay. We’re not saying he did this. Don’t you beat yourself up now.”

 

“Please find her!” She pleaded through her sobs. “Please find her and bring her home!”

 

“I promise, Evelyn. We’ll bring her home.” Gray said. “You stay strong now, alright? Stay strong for your girl. She’s gonna need her moms.”

 

Gray and I both let out a long and shaky exhale when we eventually left Evelyn’s house. Any other time I would’ve been able to compose myself better, but I was worn down. My emotions were quickly becoming compromised.

 

“I don’t know if you should have made that promise, Gray.”

 

Gray shook his head. “I know. But what was I supposed to do?”

 

I stayed silent, as I had no answer. I wanted to promise the same thing. But I knew deep down that she wouldn’t be coming back. Not the girl she knew. Not the girl with that kind, effortless smile. Even if we got her back, even if we managed to undo whatever had been done to her, that girl would be gone.

 

It hurt me more than it should. More than it has in any other case, and that frustrated me. I knew better. I knew better than to get attached. You can’t do that in this job. I knew that, I recognized that, and I practiced that for years. Why was this one different? Why was SHE different?

 

It didn’t take long to find Whitley. We knew where he worked. He lived close. It was time to pay him a visit. No time to waste.

 

We quickly arrived at his place. It was a very small and run down little house. Any smaller and it would be a trailer. Nothing immediately stood out as strange about it. It seemed to fit in. But for a man of his social standing, I expected a little bit more.

 

Imagines of the man from my dreams – our dreams – flashed through my mind. That dark and imposing figure. Was that really Whitley? He was so old and gentle when I met him at the soup kitchen. He was softspoken and his words were filled with such kindness and humility. I knew not to judge books by their covers, but this was a hell of a cover.

 

Gray knocked on the door and it was hastily opened. As unassuming as the house was, the man was perhaps even more so. He was tall, around 6’1, and held a firm posture. His thin lips twisted into a smile of indeterminate intention.

 

“How may I help you?” He asked, but the way he said it made it sound like he already knew the answer. His voice was breathy with a slight regional twist, but it exuded a confidence that was... different.

 

“Good afternoon Mr. Whitley, we just wanted to ask you a few questions.” Gray stated with a friendly tone.

 

“I see. What is this regarding? Something about Melvin?”

 

“You knew the missing girl Harmony and her family, did you not?” I asked, cutting to the point.

 

“Ah, yes. They were dear friends. So terrible to hear she had gone missing.” As Whitley spoke it was obvious he was hiding a smile. When he finished his deeply insincere statement, the smile returned as full as ever. It WAS him, and he wasn’t even trying. I was getting furious.

 

There’s a delicacy to questioning someone. It’s like a game, to try and extract information from a suspect. A social game. I don’t know what it was that compelled me to completely forego procedure. Maybe it was the fact that I knew this was the guy. Maybe it was the fact that he seemed to be enjoying the game, and that bothered me. Whatever it was, I chose to end it early.

 

“What did you do to her?” I asked calmly. I saw Gray out of the corner of my eye turn towards me. I could only imagine the look on his face.

 

Ray snickered. “What makes you think I had something to do with it?”

 

“I know you did. Don’t lie to me.”

 

Gray leaned in a muttered to me with urgency and building rage, “Cole, what the fuck are you doing?”

 

I ignored him and continued to press. “Tell me what you did to her.”

 

Whitley laughed again. “It don’t matter now. What’s done is done.”

 

“Talk.” I insisted.

 

“You’re too late, kiddo.”

 

I hated that he called me that. I hated it so much more than when Gray said it. My voice raised.

 

“You think we won’t put you away for this? You think you got off scott-free?”

 

Whitley leaned in uncomfortably close to me and smiled even wider. I saw his crooked teeth and smelled his rotten breath. “I did it. I confess. I took Harmony. Arrest me.”

 

I lost my temper entirely. I quickly unholstered my weapon and pointed it at his head.

 

“What the fuck kind of game are you playing!?” I shouted at his face.

 

“Hands behind your back! Get on your knees!” Gray yelled before turning to me. “Cole, step the fuck back!”

 

Whitley dutifully put his hands behind his back and got down on his knees. I didn’t take my gun away from his head, even as Gray physically pushed me back.

 

“She was our lamb from the beginning.” Whitley taunted to me. “She was born unto a greater purpose and now that purpose has been fulfilled.”

 

“What does that mean!?” I yelled. Gray began to handcuff him.

 

“The game was for her. It was always for her. My work is done. For the father. He will have new skin. He will have eyes.” Whitley drew a long, slow sigh and closed his eyes before continuing. “My candle hath burned out.”

 

Gray shouted in pain and recoiled before he could get the last cuff secured. I didn’t see what happened at first, but his hand began to drip with blood almost immediately. Whitley moved quickly back to his feet and I saw the glint of something metallic in his hand as he thrusted it towards Gray with immense speed.

 

I pulled the trigger. The shot hit Whitley in the temple and exited the other side with a firework of blood. He collapsed instantly.

 

Gray clutched his bleeding hand and shouted obscenities. My entire body shook with adrenaline and rage. I knew I made a mistake. I knew I did what he wanted me to do. The one person who could tell us the truth was now gone.

 

“Cole, what the FUCK!?” Gray snapped at me.

 

“He was going to kill you!” I yelled.

 

“Not that! Fuck him! What aren’t you telling me!?”

 

“What!? What do you want me to say!?”

 

“The truth! What the hell happened here, Cole!? Coming up here throwing accusations in his face, pulling your gun out, that’s not what we do! Not when the only evidence against the man is a little girl’s bad dream! You know more! You tell me what you know, right fucking now!”

 

I clenched my fists and relented. “It wasn’t just her dream! Okay? It was my dream too.”

 

“What? What the fuck does that even mean?”

 

“Fuck!” I screamed. “Alright, you wanna hear it? Fine. Ever since I took this case, I’ve been having the exact same dreams that Harmony had. The man in the hat with the chalice. As soon as I saw Whitley, I knew it was him because I’ve seen him every fucking night. I’ve seen what she has seen. I’ve felt what she has felt. My headaches are her headaches.”

 

I ripped my sunglasses off and threw them to the ground. “Look! Look at my fucking eye. This isn’t my eye. It’s hers. You want the truth? That’s the truth, and I don’t understand it any better than you do. And I know how I sound right now. I know. You have no idea how humiliated I feel to even have to speak these words out loud, but there they are... You can call me crazy, you can get me fired. Hell, have me committed, I don’t care. Just find the fucking girl.”

 

Gray just shook his head and angrily paced for a minute before finding his response.

 

“Listen. I don’t care how humiliated you feel, or how crazy you think you sound, I need to know this shit! I need to know everything! You are supposed to be my partner. Whether either of us likes it or not, that means something. That means trust. That means having each others’ backs. I’m not gonna get you fired. I’m not gonna have you committed. But you need to get a grip.”

 

I took a moment to slow my breathing and my heart rate, despite worrying that tears would follow. “Okay... You’re right, and I’m sorry... I’m not like this, Gray. I am good at what I do. This case is just... different. The shit we’re digging into, I feel it digging back into me. I can’t get a grip on reality, I don’t know what reality is anymore.”

 

“I know you’re good at this job.” Gray assured me. “You wouldn’t have made it this far if you weren’t. There is something about this case that’s not right, I agree with you. You think I can’t feel it, I can. I feel it in the goddamn air. So maybe I don’t need you to get a grip on reality, but I need you to get a grip on yourself.”

 

“I’m trying... But I need you to tell me something. Because I think you’re holding out on me too.” I accused.

 

“What? What the hell do you mean?”

 

“I mean I’m glad you’re not calling me crazy, and I’m glad you’ve been hearing me out, but why? Why do you have any faith in me? Why would you, Detective Gray, humor me on this insane bullshit without any proof?”

 

“What are you implying?”

 

“I’m not implying anything. I’m not. I just don’t understand.”

 

“I’m not holding out on you, Cole. I just know this place... It’s a great place to live and 99% of the people are the friendliest you’ll meet, but sometimes I felt safer on the streets of Yonkers than I do on these dirt roads... Things happen out here. You hear stories, and if you’re in our line of work, you become part of them. Eventually, when you do this as long as me, you discover that sometimes the crazy shit people say ain’t always that crazy.”

 

It was hard to parse how I felt upon hearing that from Gray. He was as salt of the earth as they come. A man like him wouldn’t say something like that unless he had some damn good reasons. Frankly, it scared me to death. But at the same time, I felt a level of vindication and comfort in his words. For the first time I didn’t feel completely insane or completely alone.

 

“Well maybe I need to hear these stories.” I responded, forcing my emotions to simmer down.

 

“I’ll think about it. Talk to Benji, he runs a whole goddamn website about the ‘maritime mysteries’, and I’m sure he would love if one person read it... For now, let’s call this in. It’s gonna be a long day.”

 

He was not wrong. It was hell. Fortunately, our brief talk with Mr. Whitley was recorded by Gray. The wound on Gray’s hand and the knife that delivered it were pretty airtight as evidence as well. Still, I didn’t imagine I would be well liked after this. The new city girl detective shooting one of the pillars of the community in the head in her first month on the job wasn’t great optics, no matter how you spun it.

 

I struggled with how I felt about what I did. It wasn’t the first time that I had to shoot someone, but it was the first time that I WANTED to shoot someone. I fucked our investigation, but I was happy that he was dead.

 

Why could I still feel it though? That dread hanging in the air. The shadow cast over myself and the entire town. I thought I might feel better, at least a little bit, but I didn’t. I felt worse. My head hadn’t stopped pounding for a second since I pulled the trigger... Something was coming. Maybe we really were too late.
