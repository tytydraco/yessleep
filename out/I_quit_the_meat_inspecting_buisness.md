My name is Gabriel Fife, and I am a USDA inspector at the Davy Street kill lot, a facility in Northwest Texas that processes 200,000 head of cattle a year. Today I quit, but I don't think it will matter.

I'll be the first to admit, I was fucking exhausted. I've been pulling insane overtime, and I have been looking forward to this weekend for months. I'm going camping with my son. I don't get to see him often enough, his mother sees tot hat, and it's rarer yet that we get to go some place together.

So yeah, I wasn't at the top of my game when the truck came in. It was late in my shift, around 4PM, when the cow carrier, pulled by a rusted out semi that is older than me, the livery peeling, the paint faded, the chassis dotted with dried mud and god only knows what else pulled into the inspection area.

It's pretty standardized process, I greet the transporter, check the paperwork, inspect the cows, and make a cow-by-cow decision and certification based on a set of guidelines. But those guidelines are pretty lax when it comes to implementation. 

If you let something slip, generally it's a no harm no foul, at worst you'll get a slap on the wrist. But if you deny a shipment and your case isn't bullet proof, well, that's how inspectors loose their jobs.

But this was a little different. The farmer was bringing his own herd on this particular shipment. This is either a good thing, or a bad thing, depending on how scrupulous the farmer is. He will either be super honest with me, and possibly catch problems with his herd that I wouldn't even notice-- or he would go the other way, and in my experience with this particular farmer, it was more likely the former than the latter.

This was an exceptionally small heard for him, about 45 head of Angus, each coming from their small organic farm in St. Frenzen, FL. Well, technically organic. 

Back in my farm inspecting days I had the distinct displeasure of visiting the Johnston-Meadows family farm, and found everything to be just on the right side of legal, but about as far as you can get from ethical. The food we were shown was organic (though I have my doubts on whether that is the same food the cows actually received); the barn was in bad repair, there were too many cows in too small of a space, but everything was just barely within limits, and I had no cause to shut him down-- but plenty of cause to never buy his beef for my own eating.

See, we're trained to look for certain things. There are the really rare symptoms in cattle that say hey, something is super wrong, abnormal gate, stumbling, refusing to get up, those sorts of things are an automatic reject. Then there are the really common things that you see every day that require a little investigation, but that still inevitably lead to rejection-- abscesses, pneumonia the like.

The difference between the two though is the response. For a simple common rejection it affects just the cow. It is rejected, marked as unfit for consumption, and becomes other products without the risks. But a cow that has an abnormal gate, is stumbling, refusing to get up? Those cows have to be quarantined, the feed lot has to be investigated, the kill lot goes down for weeks, everything is investigated-- millions of dollars are burned.

So we spend most of our day looking for the normal, and praying that we never in our career see the extraordinary.

But for what all of that training does for me and cattle, it does absolutely nothing for my skill at identifying sick humans. I'm a veterinarian by trade, and while we get some basic first aid, and generally hold the compliment of CPR/AED/BLS certs that any other provider gets, my schooling was dedicated to the illnesses of animals, not man.

Anyway, I'm getting ahead of myself here. Brian Johnston, the farmer who I've known for a little over a decade now, whose the owner of Johnston-Meadows family farm in St. Frezen, FL showed up today ahead of schedule, with 45 head of cattle.

I've taken Brian's herds a few times for processing. He's one of those guys that keeps everything just this side of legal. He's been in trouble with the IRS a few times for tax evasion, he buys the cheapest feed he can get his hands on, and he's tried to trick me into taking cows that shouldn't be processed before, so I am usually pretty careful when I inspect his heard.

But when the door opened, and Brian stepped out, it was pretty immediately clear that something was wrong with him. He looked off, in the same way a horse or cow does right before it can't hide that it's sick anymore. His eyes seemed to float in their sockets, the pupils large and sluggish. 

His skin was flushed with deep crimson, and the air around him smelled of old pennies. They all looked like they hadn't slept, and I don't just mean on the trip up. They had that deep tired look to them, like someone who is on the wrong side of 96 hour shift and is about to pick up 48 more. But the way he looked did nothing to prepare me for his wife, and worse, his daughter.

His four year old girl, Sammy, normally ran up and greeted me with a hug on every previous delivery. She usually ran up and called me Gabby, for why I have no idea, but she was always happy to see me and wanted to show me her latest coloring sheet or drawing or toy. But this time she didn't even seem to recognize me, and while Brian smelled of pennies, she stunk of something much worse. 

She smelled like rot-- like decay, and her skin was taught with an oily sheen, seeming to both be swollen and hanging off of her. And her mother didn't look much better, despite the weak smile she tried to give me. I hadn't to that point seen Sammy's eyes, they were buried with the rest of her face in her mothers chest; but when Julie set Sammy down and encouraged her to come say hi to me, I saw her eyes as she swayed, they were deeply bloodshot, and glassy like no one was there. 

Each step she took toward me seemed like a mountainous struggle, and within a few she stumbled and fell, eventually laying back and refusing to make eye contact with anyone before her mother picked her up.

I was obviously concerned for them; some nasty bug must be going around there home town, or at least that's what I thought at the time. But sick human's really aren't my concern, so I moved on to looking over the cattle, and to my surprise, for the first time, Brian didn't have one cow I had to reject. 

Each were happily chewing cud, each looked strong, each looked happy, or at least as happy as any bovine ever looks. Being they were sick, I didn't want to keep them, so I kept the process moving, and sent the cows into the kill lot for processing. Brian liked to watch the start of the process, and stood with me a while, watching the cows be stunned and drained before going by conveyor to the butchering area.

We made the usual small talk, this time about our favorite football teams (how I love the Packer's and how he hates them) and how Sammy was doing in Pre-K. It wasn't long before the workers were clearing the last dozen or so heads of cattle. It was then that I thought to mention the fact that for the first time, none of his cows had had any problem.

And in response, he said the scariest words I've heard in the twenty plus years I've done this.

“Oh, we eat the downers ourselves now.”

I didn't know what to say-- I'm not sure if I nodded or smiled, or what, but that was around the time they stunned the last cow, and as I was processing what had been said, he jumped back in the rig and headed back towards the highway. 

I wanted to stop the meat right there. I wanted to reject the whole herd and shut down processing. I wanted to throw up. Were they sick from something the cows had? Is that very something now washing it's way down our drain and into our sanitary sewers? Is that very something being chopped and ground right now for distribution across the country?

I wanted to stop it all, to shut the place down and call in the Infectious Diseases team.

But how could I?

Shutting down a kill lot isn't a magic switch. It doesn't just go offline without consequences. Hundreds of employees, millions of dollars, thousands of cows, hundreds of thousands of pounds of beef. All  because I suspect that Brian Johnston may have had a downer cow with something dangerous? Brian would simply deny it, and I'd get fired for it. No one would believe me. They wouldn't care what I thought, they would care that there was no proof, and that Brian was a paying customer, and by the time I could talk any sense into anybody, the meat would be across the country.

So I came here instead. I'm mostly just scared of the unknown at this point. The chances of those healthy cows having anything is really low, I know that, but I wonder what Brian and his family is sick with?
