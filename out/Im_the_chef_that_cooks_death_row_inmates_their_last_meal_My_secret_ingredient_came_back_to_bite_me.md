The botched execution of Norton Caraway stayed in the national news cycle for weeks. But that first night, in the early hours of the morning, I just had the details I’d seen first-hand in the witness gallery — along with a sense that it was all my fault.

I paced until I thought I’d wear a hole in my apartment floor, replaying the events in the hopes that some logical explanation would let me off the hook:

Guards led the so-called Silverton Strangler into the chamber, scalp shaved bald. They restrained him in the electric chair; the method he had fought in court to have over lethal injection. When the executioner threw the lever, Caraway convulsed. I kept waiting for the shaking to stop. Instead it worsened. I don’t think I’ll ever forget the Screaming, and the smell of burning skin…

Prison staff shut the curtains to the witness gallery, and rushed us out. I left knowing he was still alive, and silently prayed with each passing moment that I would get the call confirming his death.

When my cell phone finally did ring, it was warden Paul Perkins, calling from his personal number.

I answered. “Hello?” 

“We need to talk about Caraway’s last meal.”

My blood felt cold. What did he know? How could he know. “I don’t—”

“In person.”

I’ve never driven so fast; it’s a miracle I didn’t get pulled over. I reached Balsanchi Penitentiary before dawn. Place looks like an old high school, wrapped up in barbed wire. An uneasy silence filled the long sterile corridors. The guards I passed looked twitchy, and unnerved. The whole prison seemed to be on its feet, waiting for something.

The warden greeted me in his modest office, all bookshelves and filing cabinets with a small window overlooking the plains.

“It’s been a long night.” He gestured toward two steaming mugs of coffee on his desk. “Sit. Drink.”

I obeyed.

“I didn’t think you stayed for executions,” Paul said.

“Usually don’t.”

The warden lowered himself into his chair with a huff. “Why was last night different?”

I studied his pudgy face, normally bright, kind, and clean-shaven. This morning, his eyes were bloodshot.

“A victim approached me,” I said. Give him a grain of truth. Something he may know anyway. “It made this case feel more personal.”

“Who?”

“Rebecca Plymouth,” I said. “She tracked me down and knocked on my door.” The poor woman had looked so thin, like she’d forgotten to eat. Miss-matched, wrinkled clothes.

Paul just looked at me, expectant. I continued: “I felt awful for her. So I invited her in. Made her dinner, then let her talk about her daughter.” Among other things. Oh, if only she had just gone home—

“I know you were doing a nice thing, but I’d be careful around her.” Paul said. He took a sip of coffee and smacked his lips. “When Rebecca's daughter went missing, did you know that she was the prime suspect?”

“No, I didn’t.”

“Everyone always forgets the early days of that case.” Paul set his coffee down. “Officer dropped by, asked for one of Daniella’s favorite stuffed animals. Something to help the search dogs catch her scent. Know what they found?”

I shook my head.

“Weird stuff, Cathy. Runes and animal bones. She told the cop she’d been doing a ritual to bring her baby back,” Paul said. “She couldn’t tell them where she was when Daniella went missing. So they booked her. If the Silverton Strangler decided to up and retire that day, I think you would’ve been cooking for Rebecca on death row. But I guess Caraway couldn’t help himself.”

Had I given too much away in mentioning Rebecca?

“She might not have done anything to her daughter. But she’s not safe, or sane,” Paul said. “I’m getting side tracked though. The execution: you stayed out of sympathy then?”

“Sure, you could call it that.”

“Okay.” Paul nodded. “Well, things got a bit hectic after you left. Executioner cut off the power at the 20 minute mark. Way, way longer than it’s supposed to take.” Paul took a deep breath. “By that point, Caraway looked like a half-spent candle. Bastard wasn’t just alive. He was coherent. Begging for death.”

“How is that possible?” I asked. I knew exactly how. The question was, did the warden?

“Problem with the chair, maybe.” The warden shrugged. “I made the call to override his wishes. He got the lethal injection, and stopped breathing at 3:45.”

Caraway was dead. I relaxed a little in my chair, but tried not to show a change in my posture.

“Why did you get into this job, Cathy?” Paul asked.

The question caught me off guard. Where was he going with this?

“Honestly?” I asked.

“I hate when you say that,” he said. “Implies you’ve been dishonest about everything else.”

“I picked a terrible time to be a chef. Restaurants going under right and left. What was it, 25 percent in the whole country that year?”

“Something like that,” Paul agreed.

“Any halfway decent owner wanted a chef with serious culinary experience. Sleazy ones wanted to get me on server staff, so they could see my ass in one of those tiny uniform skirts,” I said. “You were my only option.”

“Cooking last meals for death row inmates has its perks,” Paul said. “No bad reviews to worry about.”

“No repeat customers either.”

“The ideal learning environment.” He curled his lips into a smile. “How inspiring.”

We both cast glances to his signed copy of, “The Killer Cookbook,” sitting on the edge of his desk. It looked like he’d put it to good use, too, judging by the sauce stains and kitchen spills that flecked the book jacket. Paul had been the one who encouraged me to write it. He even thought up the tag line appearing on the inside cover: “Gourmet meals to die for, straight from death row.”

“You did tell me people would have an appetite for it, if you’ll pardon the pun,” I quipped.

“Pardon?” He asked. “I think you’ve got a twofer.” We both chuckled in spite of the unease hanging over the room.

“So why did you stay when it all took off? The best seller list, cooking shows. Anyone would’ve hired you. Hell—you could have your own restaurant.”

“Authenticity.” I tasted each syllable of the word. I hated how often my publicist used it. Hated the way it felt in my own mouth even more.

“No other reason?” the warden asked.

I answered honestly: “No.”

He leaned in. “You didn’t ever like to mess with them?”

“Who?”

“The prisoners. You ever mess with their food?”

He knew. He knew, and he saw it in my eyes. “What’s going on?”

“Engineer took a look at the chair.” Paul bit his lip, and shook his head. “Nothing wrong with it. So after Caraway’s heart stopped, I ordered an autopsy. Maybe he had some freak medical condition. I don’t know what I was expecting.”The warden went on, his voice starting to shake with anger. “You know what I find?”

“What?”

“DNA. A Victim’s DNA. Daniella Plymouth’s blood, mixed in with the food in Caraway’s stomach and intestines.”

My face felt prickly. Stress-sweat tricked down my forehead, stinging my eyes. “Her what?”

“I’m asking you this as a courtesy, because I consider you a friend: did you tamper with Caraway’s last meal?”

I opened my mouth.

“And before you answer—” he cut me off, “—keep in mind what’s going to happen here. Botched execution means investigation. State’s gonna want to know what went wrong. Even if I tore up the report, the state would order its own autopsy and find the same thing. Might start taking a look your other meals. 

“I need to know how long this has been going on? Was this always some karmic justice for you? Like spitting in a rude customer’s food on a—a just, sick level?”

“Paul, you don’t understand—”

“I’m sorry, Cathy I’ve gotta fire you. You walk away clean, and I don’t think they’ll go after you for food tampering.”

Food tampering?

Then it clicked: Paul only thought I’d been tampering with their food. He harbored no suspicions anything supernatural even happened.

He didn’t know what I’d done; the ritual that evil woman had convinced me to play a part in. I thought back to Rebecca, and the vial she had given me along with a tattered recipe card.

“Execution is too good for him,” she’d said. “Feed Caraway this, and he will never know peace.”  
Where had she gotten her daughter’s blood for the concoction? Why did the lethal injection work, when the electric chair failed?

A blaring siren from some distant watchtower answered my second question. “Prisoner escape,” the warden muttered under his breath. He reached for his phone. Before it was halfway from its cradle to his ear, a corrections officer barged into the room, panting.

“What’s happened? Are you alright?” Paul gestured to the front of his uniform, soaked in blood.

“It’s not mine.”

“Then whose? Who’s down?”

“The coroner.”

The warden had gotten halfway to his feet when he froze. His brow wrinkled. “Wait, then who’s missing?”

“Caraway.”

My breath caught in my throat.

“Caraway’s body is gone. Autopsy report too. Someone must’ve broken in and dragged it off. They can’t have gotten far.”

“How many hurt?”

“Half dozen,” the officer panted. “Pretty badly too. I don’t know about Hopkins and Clark. Medics are with them, but…” the officer trailed off.

“How about you, you’re not wounded?” Paul asked.

“No, sir.”

“Good. You’ll need to keep Cathy safe in my office until those freaks are caught. You’d have to be some special kind of screwed up to try stealing a famous killer’s body.”

“Yeah,” I agreed.

He jabbed one of his sausage fingers in my direction. “Don’t think I’m done with you. This isn’t over.”

He had no idea how right he was.

The corrections officers didn’t catch them. There wasn’t even a “them,” to catch. 

The riot team said they must’ve fired dozens of rounds into the charred, disemboweled corpse of Norton Caraway. He just kept coming, howling in pain the whole time. The warden didn’t believe them at first. Who would? Even after he saw the security footage himself, I still don’t think he’s sure.

Officially, the Silverton Strangler was dead from 3:45, to 6:15 a.m., before he got up from the mortuary slab, and fought his way out of Balasanchi Penitentiary. He’d taken the autopsy report with him. The one that included a whole bunch of question marks around his stomach contents, and his last meal. Of course, he knew exactly who prepared it for him.

He’d looked me dead in the eyes when I served him. “You’re that cookbook lady, right? I’ve really been looking forward to this.” He flashed a smile that I couldn’t help but return. He looked so normal; certainly not the shut-in serial killer trope. He was average height, and in decent shape. Neat, combed hair, atop a round face, with a small nose. Nothing about him was intimidating, or even remarkable.

Difficult to pick out of a lineup.

Perfect for hunting down the cookbook lady.

Paul quietly let me go from my job at the prison. Felt like I got off easy for what I did. My publicist cooked up a new way for me to maintain my authenticity: making meals for the families of Caraway’s victims. She was a cunning businesswoman. A bit cold, but at least she understood my paranoia in a way that my family and friends didn’t.

“I don’t know about vengeful death row killers. But there’s plenty of crazy fans.” She set us both up with web alerts for the Silverton Strangler. That way we’d be notified if any news broke, without the need to scroll the feeds constantly.

Unfortunately, police and reporters were slow to find the bodies.

My line of work meant I often saw unknown numbers popping up on my phone. They could be a booking agent or distributor. So when it rang one weekday evening, I answered without hesitation.

“Hello, Cathy speaking.”

“Cathy—I’ve just learned the most interesting recipe. You’ve got to include it in your next book.” The voice was wheezy and labored. “It’s to die for, like you say.” The caller let out a laugh somewhere between cackle and coughing fit.

“Who is this?” I demanded. But I knew.

“Rebecca told me everything I needed to know, in the end. Told me how to reverse what you bitches did to me,” Caraway said. “The bullets weren’t the worst of it: frying in that chair; being paralyzed while they cut me open to dig around in my guts—” he raved, “—I felt everything. I still feel everything!”

I kept the phone close to my ear, turning on the spot to ensure my windows and doors were secured. I kept expecting the man’s marred remains to leap out at me.

“But you can take that pain away,” Caraway rasped. “I’d be honored, Cathy, if you’d have me over for dinner.”

My phone buzzed with a text message notification. A new image. Bony fingers wrapped in disfigured skin, pinched the edges of a recipe card.

“Dinner for two,” I read aloud.

“The witch could only push around pain and suffering from one person to the next: Daniella to me, and now me to you,” Caraway said. “Follow those instructions, and you’ll have a proper last meal for me.”

“And for me?” I asked.

Caraway laughed. “You’ll take on my suffering. A heavy burden I admit.”

“If I refuse?” 

He sighed, his labored breath crackling in the receiver. “Rebecca said we both needed to eat willingly. I can’t force you to cook, or eat. But I can certainly persuade you.”

“How?”

“Use your imagination. Watch. Give me w ring when you’ve seen enough.”

The call ended.

I told the police, of course. They searched the house, and posted an officer out front for the rest of the night just in case Caraway decided to drop by. 

I was so worried about my physical safety that I never quite wrapped my head around what the madman actually threatened me with.

When I went online the following morning, Norton Caraway had made the news again.

“Silverton Strangler Strikes Again,” was plastered across the Internet. I clicked an article at random from one of the countless news outlets running with the story.  
  
*COLUMBIA, S.C. — Police are asking the public to remain vigilant, after 48-year-old Rebecca Plymouth was discovered dead in her home. Plymouth’s daughter Daniella was one of the first confirmed victim of Norton Caraway; who would later become known as the Silverton Strangler.*

*“I am not going to share specifics to protect the integrity of the investigation. I can tell you that victim’s injuries are consistent with torture. We do believe someone was trying to get information from her,” said Detective Ronnie Mire.*

*The home had also been ransacked, and several personal items including books and Plymouth’s cell phone were missing, police said.*  
  
The article ended with a rehash of the first wave of killings, the execution fake-out, and prison break. Just like that, one of the worst killers in history was free again. Unstoppable. All because I’d let myself get wrapped up in a crazed revenge plot.

The bodies have begun to pile up — five so far in as many weeks — all strangled. I know what I have to do to stop him. I know I’m the only one who can. But I’m scared of what it means to take on that pain myself. 

Every time I think I’m strong enough, I think back to those screams of agony from the witness gallery, and the smell of burning flesh.
