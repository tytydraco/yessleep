My polaroid pictures are changing, and I don’t know why.

My name is Alex Barton, and I’ve been a photographer my entire life, ever since my grandfather gifted me my first camera on my thirteenth birthday, not long before he passed. I’ve worked for the New York Times for 30 years and have been their top photographer even from the transition from newspapers to online articles. In my career I have seen some odd, scary and downright disturbing shit which usually occurs in New York City but nothing like this.

It all started when my wife Faye and I were going through some old boxes of photos stored at the back of my closet due to us moving to a small house in Armonk in a few weeks. I had recently retired from my job, as did my wife, who was a writer for the NYT, and we were both looking for a change in scenery. The two brown boxes were completely covered in cobwebs and dust - these were photos I had taken back in the ‘90s and early 2000s. I always liked keeping copies of my work as mementos of a sort. Unfortunately, I haven’t done it since the transition to the Internet due to the switch to digital cameras. 

I opened the first box and smiled when I saw the picture. It was of my wife. Her beautiful, light blonde hair spread over her face as she smiled her big, goofy smile. She was dressed in a yellow sundress, and I realised that this was taken on our first date.

“Faye!” I yelled across the apartment; the hustle and bustle of the city outside would have been deafening, but we were New York natives and were used to it.

“Yeah?!” she replied, walking across toward me and kneeling in front of the closet.

“Look what I found,” I said, handing her the Polaroid as I continued to rummage through the box.

Faye took the photo and stared at it for a split second before giggling.

“Aww!” she said. “You kept a photo of our first date?”

“Of course I did,” I replied. “You’ve never looked better.”“Shut up!” she laughed as she continued to look at the photograph. “Oh, I miss that dress… where did we go again?”

“Umm… the Landmark Tavern, I think? I-”

I was about to continue before Faye spoke very quickly and with a strong sense of urgency.

“Who is that?” she asked, handing me back the photo and pointing to the top right of the photo, which I believed had featured an empty table now had a strange man in a duster coat and a fedora staring at the camera with blood-red eyes, he was hunched over the single table- strongly gripping his beer.

“Huh, that’s weird. I’d never noticed that guy before. He must be affected by the red eye effect - the bar was dim - the only reason your eyes are fine is cause they’re closed.” I replied.

“Are you sure? The red is surrounding the entire eye - it’s usually only the pupil, right?” Faye asked.

“Usually, but it’s a weird angle. I wouldn’t worry about it.”

She should have worried about it. I certainly was. I was fucking shitting myself.

It was my dead grandfather.

He was unmistakable - his long greying hair peeking out of his signature fedora. 

“He would never take the damn thing off,” my mother would say.

How could my grandfather, who had passed away 8 years earlier, be in the bar where my wife and I had our first date? 

I began to rummage through some more of the photos lying at the top, and the trend continued.

There was a picture from 2001, when I was on call to take pictures of the 9/11 attacks. I was on the ground, snapping photos of the burning towers, when I noticed an odd shadow on one of the shorter neighbouring buildings - those blood-red eyes continuing to stare at me.

I decided to leave the project for the day, and Faye and I went out - back to the bar where we had our first date. We sat at the same table we were on in the photo and recreated it with my Polaroid - she looking as beautiful as ever and we enjoyed a nice night out for the first time in a long time. Later that night, after Faye fell asleep I looked at the new photo and the old photos again. The new one was fine, but the 9/11 one had altered again - the figure was gone, but so were the towers, as if they were never really there.

I was beginning to become extremely paranoid, and I began to dig through the second box filled with old papers until I found the newspaper from September 12, 2001 - and the picture on the newspaper was the same as my own picture. The towers were gone.

That morning, I showed Faye the photo and asked what she thought. What she said shook me to my core.

“There were never any towers. What’re you talking about?”
