Once he shut the door behind him, I figured I’d try to at least befriend Jin.  
“So, have you tried the suit out yourself?” I asked, looking up at him. He just ignored me, focusing on his book.  
“Uhhh ok, well, where are you from?”  
This time he shot me a quick look, a look that singled he wanted me to leave him alone. So I sat on the bottom bunk, quiet and filled with anxiety. I looked around the room, trying to find a book or anything to take my mind off of what had just happened with the villagers. My eyes fell on a novel that was sitting on top of the desk. It was War of the Worlds, by H.G. Wells. I was a little familiar with the concept of the book but had never gotten around to reading it. But when I went to reach for it, Jin stopped me.  
“That’s mine,” he simply said.  
“Sorry,” I replied as I embarrassingly pulled my hand back. With nothing else to do, I decided to try and take a nap. I hadn’t really gotten any good sleep in the last few days. So it wasn’t that hard to drift off. But as soon as I felt like I did, Chapman was waking me up.  
“Hey Sione, I brought you something to eat.”  
I rolled over in the bed to see him standing in the doorway and holding a plate. On it was a simple ham and Swiss sandwich with some fruit. I was pretty hungry, so I grabbed it from him and ate quickly. He had also brought me a big bottle of water, too. He waited patiently by the door while I wolfed down the food. I noticed Jin was now reading War of the Worlds and was no longer listening to music. He didn’t seem to be paying us any attention, however.  
“Eat it up. You’re gonna need your energy. We’ve arrived at the site,” Chapman told me as I finished up. I felt my body tingle with excitement, knowing I was finally gonna have a chance with that diving suit.  
“Well, I’m ready,” I said firmly, standing him and looking him in the eye.  
“Alright, follow me,” he said and left the room. I was glad to be out of there, as Jin honestly kinda made me a little uncomfortable. But as he led me down the hallway, I began thinking about the village again.  
“Hey, are we gonna be alright when we go back?” I asked.  
“You mean to the dock, right?” He replied without looking back.  
“Yeah.”  
“Don’t worry about it; we’ve been helping those people out with food, water, and supplies for this past year. I think they’ll come back around.”  
“I am curious, though. That church I went into was very odd. I didn’t see a cross or any Bibles. Do they have another religion? I’m not too familiar with who they worship around here.”  
Chapman waited a few seconds before replying.  
“Uh, honestly, I don’t know. I try to avoid bringing that up with them. They’re sensitive about it, as you already know.”  
Once we reached the main room, the one with all the computers, Chapman stopped. This time, men in suits were moving all around. Another man with short grey hair and a grey mustache swiftly made his way over to us. He was much older than Chapman or anyone else I had seen on this trip.  
“Come right this way,” he beckoned me over to him. We followed him down another hall and down the steps into a large room, where a man in a suit silently watched us. The walls were lined with stands, where the diving suits were on full display. They were amazing, and just as advanced looking as the helmet had been.  
“Mr. Tupuola, I can’t wait for you to try this suit on,” he led me to one which was sitting in the middle. The suit itself looked like something out of an iron man movie, with a metal-like but thin material. I had no idea how I was gonna put it on.  
“Were you already briefed on these suits?” The man asked me.  
“No, I haven’t been.”  
“Oh good, I love explaining it,” he smiled joyfully.  
“Have you ever been in an atmospheric diving suit?” He then asked.  
“No, I can’t say I have.” My mind went to the endless amounts of youtube videos I had watched about the big puffy suits.  
“Well, these here are similar, but better. They can withstand up to a 2,000-meter depth, and they have actual mobility.” He then pointed to a cylinder-shaped object on the back.  
“This thing right is basically like a jetpack, but underwater. It’s got a propulsion system that allows you to move around.”  
“How do I control that?” I asked.  
“Oh, there’s a simple button on the sleeve which turns it on and off. However, if your hands are busy, it can be voice-activated with the commands ‘jet-on’ and ‘jet-off’”  
He looked at me with a large grin, and I got the idea he had been responsible for most of the suit’s design or build.  
“Wow, I can’t wait to try it all out,” I smiled back at him, returning the excitement. I truthfully was very happy to try this on.  
“How do I get in?” I asked.  
“You ever seen the Marvel movies?” The man asked, like he had been reading my mind.  
“I’m a big fan, although I think the time travel was-“  
“I’m sure you remember the Iron Man suit-up scenes.” His grin widened as he stepped forward and removed the helmet from the suit, before pulling a remote out of his pocket and pressing it. The back of the suit began to separate into smaller pieces before opening up, leaving enough space for someone to step in.  
“How did you even engineer that?” I said as I stared in awe.  
“That’s not important. But every suit was tailored to everyone on the team’s sizes, so this should fit very comfortably to you. Go ahead and step in.” He nudged me and I stepped into the suit. He pressed the remote again and the suit closed around me. He was right too, it fit my body snugly and perfectly.  
“Now you see the pad you are standing on,” he pointed to my feet. I looked down at a grey circular pad to which the boots of the suit were attached to.  
“Mhm,” I muttered.  
“In order to activate the opening mechanism, you must stand on one of these pads.”  
“Well, it’s not like I plan on taking it off while exploring the sunken ship,” I laughed a little. But the man just gave me an odd, almost worried look. He then walked over to a shelf and pulled off of it what appeared to be a rifle. As he brought it closer to me, I recognized it as a speargun, but one I had never seen before. It had a folding stock like a shotgun, and two loaded spears in a sort of double-barrel fashion. A large cylinder ran under the entire length of the barrel as well. I had never seen anything like it.  
“Are we hunting Jaws down there?” I laughed again. The man still kept his worried expression and kept his eyes down at the gun.  
“You’re very funny. We have scanned the area for sharks and have seen nothing, but we didn’t just bring you all out here to test out our new suits. We also wanted to test out this new speargun, which was designed along with our suits. As I’m sure you can tell by this cylinder here underneath, it is a pneumatic speargun. Although this one is more powerful than any other design you have seen, with a rare velocity of firing over 200 meters per second. You have two shots with it, and it is attached to the side of the oxygen tank for convenience. Feel free to use it while you’re down there.”  
“I’m not going down there to murder fish,” I replied and picked the gun up, which was surprisingly light. The man went and picked up a helmet, which matched the color of my suit. I assumed it was part of the suit, but it looked exactly like an astronaut’s helmet, with a heavily silver-tinted visor.  
“Here you go. The helmet was designed to be as comfortable as the rest of the suit. But of course, that will be up to you to decide in the end,” he spoke as I attached the speargun to my oxygen tank and grabbed the helmet. Chapman stepped forward and repeated the same process as I did. He looked like he had done this plenty of times before, however. Once he was also suited up, he told me to follow him out to the deck. I turned back to the man who had helped me out.  
“Thank you, it was nice to meet you Mr….” I trailed off, extending my hand out for a handshake. He shook it back firmly and said.  
“Oh, I’m afraid I can’t tell you my name, for security purposes.”  
I nodded and followed Chapman out onto the deck. The suit felt light, natural, and comfortable. At least above water. They had done a good job with it. But now it was time for the true test. Chapman and I were the only two out on the deck. It was a cloudy day, and I could only see the ocean in every direction to the horizon; a line that separated the dark blue from the light blue of the sky and dark grey and somber clouds. Chapman walked over to the port side of the boat next to the submarine and looked over. I followed him and noticed a ladder descending down into the water.  
“Alright, the wreckage is directly below us, about 400 feet. Now, because we’re on such a large ship, there’s no need for a backwards roll off of it. We’ll take the ladder down and descend slowly to the wreckage. No need for the submarine either,” he said to me and put his helmet on. I followed his lead, and now I was fully encased in the suit. Like everything else, breathing in it felt natural, too. Chapman climbed over the side of the boat and began to descend the ladder. When he was at the bottom, he told me to follow him down. It was honestly pretty cool hearing him talk through the helmet radio. As I climbed down, I noticed him letting himself sink, and did the same once I reached the water.  
“Alright, now I just want you to test out the suit’s movement. It was designed to be able to swim in too,” I heard Chapman’s voice come over the radio. I almost expected some sort of advanced H.U.D. to come over the front of my helmet’s visor, but none did.  
That might be a little bit too advanced for us yet, I thought and began treading the water. The suit felt like, almost like I wasn’t even wearing it.  
“How’s it feel?” Chapman asked me, also treading the water.  
“Great! This thing is awesome! This could really revolutionize my industry. Surely you guys are gonna make this kind of stuff available for everyone one day, right?” I replied fast. I could hardly contain myself and I knew it. Embarrassment ran through me.  
“Well, maybe one day, but right now it’s just planned for military use. We’re gonna start our descent now, so just let yourself sink,” he explained as he quit moving. I followed his lead, and we began to sink slowly. Although on the way down, I couldn’t help but move around in the suit a bit. After about ten minutes, I felt the pressure in my ears begin to build up. It was something you would think I would have gotten used to by now, but I still hated it. With the suits on, it took us about thirty minutes before I finally caught sight of the sunken cargo ship. I saw a few fish on the way down, but nothing too crazy.  
“Alright, here we are,” Chapman said, spinning around to face it directly. I did the same and noticed a few dolphins swimming around it too. At this depth, there was still enough light to see everything. I had dived around a few sunken wrecks before, but nothing ever this massive. The ship was mostly still intact, with cargo crates and everything still strapped in. The crates by the front looked like they had all been knocked over, and I noticed a massive hole in the starboard side.  
“You said pirates sunk this? What kind of weapons do they have to make that big enough of a whole? Why wasn’t this on the news?” I asked.  
“Because we wanted to keep it secret. They somehow got access to a bomb, boarded the ship, and then detonated it, trying to hide their evidence. They were after even heavier weaponry that we had been transporting secretly to Africa on it. Luckily they never got to it,” he explained. I didn’t bother asking why they were transporting weaponry to Africa, but I had an idea.  
Maybe they had been supplying civilians to help them defend themselves?  
I didn’t know much about wars and what was going on in Africa in 2022, but I knew the country was always in turmoil.  
“Why don’t you give that thrust pack a try?” Chapman asked me, quickly moving on from the topic.  
“Alright,” I said, aiming my body at the ship.  
“Thrust-on!” I yelled. Right away I was being hurled forward, way faster than I could ever swim. I aimed myself up a little and shot over the tops of the containers.  
“Thrust-off!” I said once I had reached the other side of the ship. I looked back and saw Chapman following me with his own thrust pack.  
“How is it?” He asked.  
“That was pretty neat.”  
“I’m glad to see you approve of this suit. That helps us out a lot. We got about 20 minutes to spend around here, so why don’t you explore the cargo ship? Get a feel for the suit so you can give the most honest feedback on it possible.”  
“Wait, what about the weapons? Weren’t we coming out here to retrieve some?”  
Chapman hesitated a bit before replying, and I watched a dolphin dart past us, just a few feet away.  
“Full disclosure Sione, we already got the weapons from this wreck. It’s the second wreck we’ll be getting them. And then you’ll be part of a full team. I just wanted to make sure you could handle the suit and were comfortable in it and everything before we proceeded on to that one.”  
“It’s fine, I get that. I’m gonna explore the ship. You wanna come?”  
“I’m gonna stay up here and talk to Command for a bit, go on ahead,” he replied. I began swimming to the ship, feeling no need to use the thrust pack. I did find it a lot of fun, however. I wasn’t too bothered about him lying about getting the weapons, as this dive felt a lot more casual to me now. Most of the sunken wrecks I visited around Hawaii had been there for years and were covered in colonies of sponges, shrimp, seaweed, sea anemones, tube organisms, and all types of sea life. This one hardly had anything covering it, so you could easily tell it was new wreckage. I spent a lot of the time swimming through it, looking around, and even used the thrust pack again a few more times. But when I saw a bale of sea turtles on the sandy ocean floor, I got distracted and made my way over to them. There were some clownfish swimming around too, darting in and out of some anemone plants. I easily recognized the turtles as green sea turtles, ones who were commonplace in the Pacific. There were about four of them, and they were eating on the seagrass. But with every bit, they got a mouthful of sand with it. I felt a little bit of pity rise up in me, and decided to help them out. So I pulled some grass out with my hand and outreached it towards the turtles. The closest turtle swam over to me and picked up the grass out of my palm gently, accepting my offer. This was something I did often, as turtles acted like dogs when it came to this. It didn’t take long for the rest of them to be swarmed around me, and I spent the remaining time feeding them.  
“Just letting you know, you can’t keep them,” Chapman’s voice came over the headset, pulling me out of my thoughts. I spun around to see he had made his way over to me and was floating about ten feet above me. I hadn’t even noticed him come over.  
“That’s one of my favorite things about coming down here in the depths. So many people are terrified of the ocean, but a lot of it is just gentle life like this,” I said, looking back at the turtles and clownfish and then back at Chapman. Without saying anything, he reached back and pulled out the harpoon gun from the back. I quickly darted in front of the turtle that was right next to me, covering him.  
“Woah, you’re not gonna use that thing on any of these creatures,” I said, trying to remain calm.  
“Relax, I’m not planning on it. But take your speargun out, we’re gonna be practicing it,” he said as he turned around to face the wall of the cargo ship. I felt my brief sense of panic leave me as I reached back and pulled out my own speargun.  
“You see the letters on the side of the ship? Try to hit them,” he said and fired his gun. I watched as the spear darted through the water and hit the R, getting stuck in the metal. We were about thirty or so feet from the side of the ship, which read RACHFORD, which I assumed was the company name. I noticed several holes in the letters that looked like they could be the size of the spears, and wondered if they had come down here before to use this as target practice. I now wondered if they had gotten the weapons a long, long time ago, longer than he made it sound. For all I knew, they could be regularly keeping the ship clean, to make it appear as it had just recently sunk.  
“Sione?” Chapman’s voice rang through my helmet, once again bringing me out of my thoughts. I raised my speargun and aimed at the letters, but didn’t squeeze the trigger right away. I had never really been much into guns, and only shot one once, when I was a teenager. I knew I wasn’t a good shot, but squeezed the trigger and fired anyway. I was aiming for the A but the spear hit the space in between that and the C.  
“It’s ok, try again,” Chapman commented. I fired once more, aiming for the A. And once again I missed my shot. With Chapman’s accuracy, I wondered just how skilled with guns and fighting he was. He seemed like the kinda guy to not get dirty himself, but with these people, I didn’t even really know.  
“Here, why don’t you try again,” Chapman insisted and swam towards me, outstretching his own gun. I put my own gun back on the thrust-pack and grabbed his. Then I raised his gun, aimed, and breathed deeply. This time when I fired the gun, the spear hit the mark.  
“Good job Sione.”  
I figured it was for security reasons. He wanted me to be accurate with it, in case we were attacked by a shark or something.  
“Thank you, Sir,” I replied.  
“Oh, you don’t need to call me Sir,” Chapman replied, swimming forward to the spears. I watched as he pulled them out of the side of the ship, and let myself float down a few feet back to the turtles. In the suit, I could actually walk around on the ocean floor some, an experience that wasn’t really that possible in a normal scuba diving suit. One of the turtles made its way over to me, probably expecting me to feed it. So I bent down and gave it some grass until Chapman had gotten all the spears.  
“Time for us to go back up, which we must do slowly, as I’m sure you know,” Chapman said, glancing in my direction before looking up and swimming. I followed him up, taking one last look at the turtles and dropping the remaining grass out of my hand for them. I had witnessed firsthand what happens if you ascend too fast. It was a nasty thing called decompression sickness, or more commonly, “the bends.” It was caused by dissolved gasses emerging from solution bubbles inside the body during decompression. It left horrible rashes, numbness, and pain in the joints, and even sometimes even death. I hadn’t known anyone personally who had died from it, but I had heard stories from other people, including someone Nathan once knew.  
“So, what do you think of the suit?” Chapman asked me when we were about halfway up.  
“It’s awesome, really. You have done something amazing here, and I can’t thank you enough for letting me be a part of it.”  
“Well, if it’s up to standards for one of the all-time greatest swimmers this nation has had, then it sounds like it’ll work for the United States military itself,” Chapman replied, almost cheerfully. My face grew a little red with embarrassment.  
“Thank you, but I’m far from the greatest. I only ever won a single gold medal, I didn’t break any records or anything.”  
“I had to look into you a lot, and I disagree.”  
As soon as we emerged at the top, Chapman began to reach for the ladder. But something made him pause. He stayed completely still for a few seconds before rapidly spinning around. I turned around also and saw what he was now looking at. Three small boats were speeding in our direction. With the helmet on, I couldn’t even hear them.  
“Get down!” Chapman looked at me before diving back under the water. I followed and dove under too, heart beating rapidly now.  
“We need to get lower again,” Chapman said as he let himself sink. As I sunk, I looked back up to see the bottoms of the boat approach our boat and begin to circle it.  
“Are they gonna board the boat? Attack the others?” I asked.  
“I can’t be too sure, but we made sure to bring security in case something like this happened.”  
“I thought you said that these waters were clear from the pirates, that they hadn’t been seen in months.”  
“We hadn’t, but there are always risks to things like this. I’m sure our guys can handle this. Usually, these kinds of people aren’t well coordinated and organized.”  
“How long do these oxygen tanks last?”  
“Ten hours, but that’s a non-issue.”  
I watched as the boats kept circling, not knowing what could possibly happen. I imagined them killing the whole crew, maybe even sinking the boat. If that happened, we would be stuck out here, doomed to drown to death after ten hours of building dread. It was a fate I didn’t want to meet. One of the boats slowed down, stopped circling, and began to approach our own boat. The other two boats stopped on the opposite side of the boat.  
“It looks like they’re gonna board,” I said.  
“Just hang on,” Chapman replied. I noticed him press something on the headset, and then he was silent. But as I observed him, I was close enough to make out his mouth moving. I figured he had to have switched radios, possibly to whoever was “Command.” And now, whatever he was saying, he probably didn’t want me to find out.  
I thought about saying something but held my tongue for now. After around maybe five minutes, he pressed the button on his helmet and finally looked at me.  
“Alright Sione, I don’t think these guys are here to harm us. But I need to go up to them and negotiate, and you gotta stay down here.”  
“Alone? What if I don’t hear from you again?”  
“You will; now do not come back above the water for any circumstances until you do, got it?”  
“Got it.”  
I watched as Chapman began to ascend to the surface, and then move to the ladder. Pretty soon, he disappeared completely from sight. I watched with anxiety, almost expecting to see his body splash back down into the water or any number of others. The minutes ticked by, and I heard nothing. I was in complete silence under the water, and the boats were still. It was like someone had paused time.  
“God, please let them be safe,” I uttered a quick prayer and then began to consider going back to the ship, back to the turtles. With them, I felt some comfort. And if I was gonna die, I didn’t want to die alone. With every growing minute, my anxiety grew deeper. And finally, I began to let myself sink, sink back down to the depths. Sink back to a place away from all this presumed death and chaos, to tranquility. This was an odd feeling, running through me. It was something I had never felt before. I looked back down to the ship and noticed But then I took one last glance up and noticed something. The boat parked next to the boat was moving away from it. And not long after, the other boats began to pull away. I watched as they left the main boat, and headed back in the direction of Madagascar.  
That doesn’t change anything, they still could have killed everyone on the boat and just left it out here to rot.  
But now I realized I had a means out. I had never driven a boat that large, but I would certainly figure it out if it was my only way back. I just didn’t know how I would explain everything to the villagers, or even get back home from there. But still, that boat was a shimmer of hope now.  
“Sione? You there?” Chapman’s voice came over the radio, hitting me like a wave of relief.  
“Yeah, I’m here.”  
“Ok the coast is clear; you can come on up.”  
I let out a deep breath and swam up to the surface. As soon as I emerged I swiveled around, checking one last time to make sure the pirates were gone, and then grabbed the ladder and began to climb. Chapman was waiting for me alone on the deck, and I saw no signs of a fight or anything serious happening. It looked just like it had before we went on our dive. I took off my helmet gently, breathing in the fresh air. And then, I questioned Chapman about what just happened.  
“Is everyone alright?”  
“Yeah, they didn’t want to hurt us. It was just all a big misunderstanding. They weren’t even the same pirates from a few months back.”  
“Well, who were they then?”  
“Some locals from the island just wanted to see what we were doing all the way out here. They were fine with the diving. We pretty much just told them the truth, anyway.”  
“Thank goodness.”  
“Come with me; let’s get that suit off you.”  
With that, Chapman turned around and began to walk back into the cabin. I rushed after him.  
“Hey, I need to know that this is gonna be safe. I have a family to go back to. But with the pirates and the speargun practicing…”  
“We would never let anything happen to you, I promise,” Chapman said, almost giving me a small smile. He led me back to the same room where we put on the suits the first time. There, the same man was waiting. And once again he was wearing a giddy smile. Some people may have found it unnerving, but I admired that they were still keeping a positive attitude.  
“How did you like the suit Mr. Tupoula?”  
“It was good, y’all did an incredible job with it.”  
“Thank you. Now, in order to get it off, all you have to do is step back on the same pad that it was on originally,” he said with satisfaction. I followed his instructions and stepped on the same one that it had been on. The suit began to open up, and I stepped out.  
“Are you ok? With those other people coming on the boat?” I asked the guy.  
“Oh, they were no big deal. I doubt something like that will happen again for the rest of our time,” he said. After Chapman got out of his suit, he escorted me back to my living quarters. And like I had expected, Jin was still lying on the bed and listening to music.  
“I’ll be back around in a few hours for dinner, but is there anything else I could get you?” Chapman turned to ask me as he headed out of the door.  
“Yeah actually, maybe a few books or puzzles like Jin has, and a bible possibly?” I asked him.  
“Alright, I’ll be right back,” Chapman said and left, shutting the door behind him.
