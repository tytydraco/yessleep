Hello, good people of nosleep. I have a story I haven't told anyone because no one would believe me and while I don't expect anyone here will believe me, I need to get it out. I've been on edge since this happened and am hoping by talking about it, I'll feel better about it. Maybe someone has seen something similar or has an idea of what it was. Or maybe someone can point me in the direction of a good psychiatrist. 

Now, I live on the bank of a murky, semi-polluted lake and I think something strange lives in it. Whenever I sit on the dock I'll hear loud splashes and see a large areas of disturbed water but I never see what makes it. The thing is, it always sounds too heavy to be a fish or any of the aquatic birds who hunt by diving. Even a large fish wouldn't make a splash that big. The herons make big splashes but you can see those big dummies right away. 

The other day I was out on the dock admiring the sky, it was early evening and the clouds were breathtaking. I love spending that part of the day in nature, everything's getting ready for bed and it's so peaceful. It was nearly dark when I finally decided to go inside. I heard a loud splash, like someone jumping in the lake,  and spun around. I had to see who it was because EW the lake is not good for swimming in and I thought maybe the new neighbors were being brave. My eyes were immediately drawn to the only part of the lake with signs of movement. I expected to see someone's dog or a kid and was ready to holler out a brain eating amoeba joke when my eyes focused on what I saw. In the dimming light I had to squint to really get a look and when I did I immediately began backing towards the house, keeping my eyes locked on its eyes. 

I saw a humanoid figure in the water, about 10 feet from our bulkhead. The eyes and forehead sticking out of the water, the body floating out behind it. I could see spindly limbs in the water. It didn't seem to have hair, it was very thin with mottled gray and sickly white skin. There was eyeshine, despite it looking human. The eyeshine is what unsettled me. Bright white eyeshine on a humanoid creature...? We continued gazing at each other for a few moments, it began swimming slowly forward with careful strokes before it, and its creepy, glowing eyes disappeared back into the water.

I locked myself inside and watched from the window to see if it reappeared but it didn't. It just left large ripples where it disturbed the water. I stopped watching once it was too dark to see the water. 

I haven't spent much time in the backyard since I saw... whatever that was, and now when I do, I feel like I'm being watched at all time. I've been referring to it as water gollum and I hope we never meet again.
