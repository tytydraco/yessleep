Brynn Williams was twenty-seven years old. She had a story that sounded right out of Dateline: a bright college graduate who disappeared in the foggy, pre-dawn hours of June second. And who was found twenty-four hours later, halfway submerged in the canal on the edge of town, her face bashed in beyond recognition. 

Her case never made national news. Of course it didn’t. She wasn’t white enough, blonde enough, or thin enough. The cruel reality of our world.

Her case was an odd one, because she left behind a recording. Brynn had been recording a voice memo when she’d left her apartment at 4:25 AM.

“Has anyone else listened to it?” I asked Officer Burns when she handed me the USB stick.

She shrugged. “Don’t know.”

“So you don’t know... what happens on it?”

“No. Just that the timestamp matches when she left the apartment.”

Okay. So I was going in blind.

I got up and closed the door to my office, fearing the worst. Then I put on my headphones and pressed play.

“Okay. So I, uh... I just left the apartment,” Brynn said. Her voice sounded breathy and scared. In the background, the car’s engine thrummed to life.

I pictured her pulling out of the driveway I’d seen in the crime scene photos, puttering down the narrow country road in her beat-up Subaru.

“So. I left, because, something really weird happened,” she started, sounding unsure. “I didn’t tell Brandon, because he’d just laugh at me. And I don’t want to call anyone and wake them up. It’s like, 4:30 AM. But I want to get it all out while it’s still fresh in my mind.”

It was so strange. Hearing her voice from beyond the grave. I felt like she was next to me. Talking in my ear.

I closed my eyes, to try to focus better. But all I could see was her face in my mind’s eye. Crumpled, bashed in, so disfigured it didn’t even look like a face anymore.

Except for her mouth. Her mouth hanging open in a smile, a void, her jaw halfway dislocated.

My eyes popped open and I stared at the sunny wall across from me.

“So, um... I was browsing TikTok, and I saw this video. It just came up in my feed, I wasn’t looking for it or anything,” she said quickly. “But it looked like... like this woman was...” She let out a stifled sob. “She um, she stabbed herself. I don’t want to get into the details but it was, really really graphic.”

I swallowed.

“I was really scared, but then I thought, this is probably just some AI-generated shit, right? I decided that was enough internet for the day and I turned off my phone and tried to go to sleep.” She sucked in a breath. “But then I heard the TV go on downstairs.”

I stared at the wall, my heart pounding in my chest.

“It was some rerun of The Office. I could hear Steve Carrell’s voice as I went down the stairs. But as soon as I walked into the room... it flicked to that fucking video. Of the woman stabbing herself.

“I unplugged the TV and went back up the stairs. I went back to sleep. I think I dozed off a little bit, but then I woke up. I woke up to the sounds from the video. They were coming over my Bluetooth speaker on my nightstand.”

Her voice broke. “It was somehow even more horrible hearing the sounds. She starts out crying... and then you hear the knife... and then she lets out this manic laugh. And then a thud when she falls over. And it was just looping like that, crying, knife, laugh, thud. Over and over and over.”

She sniffled. “So I left. I just couldn’t stay there anymore. I don’t know what was going on, like could it be some virus that keeps playing the video on all my devices? Is that even possible? All my things are Apple and all connected to each other, so it’s not like, outside the realm of possibility. Right?”

The *clack-clack-clack* of her turn signal filled the silence.

“Wait... there’s someone on the sidewalk.”

My stomach flipped.

“Oh wait... it... what?”

She gasped.

And then I heard the squeal of tires.

“It’s *her,”* she breathed. “Oh God, it’s her, what the fuck?!”

She began to cry.

“What the fuck, how can it be her?”

And then I heard it.

Static crackled through the car’s radio, into my headphones.

And then--

A woman sobbing.

The horrible *schliiiing* of a knife being unsheathed.

A giggle, that crescendoed into a full-throated laugh.

And then...

A *thump.*

The audio looped as a shrill scream burst through the headphones.

And then the audio cut out.

I looked at the computer screen. It was over.

I took off the headphones and set them on the desk, shaking.

The consensus had been that the boyfriend murdered her. He had motive. He was cheating, and a general lowlife.

Now... now I wasn’t so sure.

I was still shook up when I got home. I went through the rest of the night on autopilot, making small talk with my wife, barely eating. I turned in early and went to sleep.

At 4:25 AM, I was startled awake.

By the sound of a woman sobbing.

I jumped out of bed. Checked my phone. There wasn’t any video playing. I heard the knife...

I froze.

It sounded like it was coming from my closet.

I walked over, my legs shaking underneath me. My hand tightened around the doorknob.

I sucked in a breath--

And yanked it open.

My eyes scanned the dark clothes, the shelves, the little nooks and crannies behind the boxes. I didn’t see a woman anywhere, or anything else that could be making the noise.

I closed the door--

A quiet giggle came from behind me.

Before I could turn around, cold fingers wrapped around the back of my neck--

And began bashing my face into the door. 

*Thump.*

Pain shot across my face. I screamed.

*Thump--*

I heard my wife scream behind us, and then it all stopped. I collapsed to the floor.

I told the others what I saw. But they don’t believe me. In fact, when they saw how desperately I begged them not to listen to the recording--when my wife told them no one else was in our bedroom when I was bashing my head in--they put me on suspended leave. For my own health, they said. My own well-being.

I can’t stop it. They’re going to listen to that tape, and they’re going to die, too.

And I’m not sure how long I have left.

Because I hear giggling all the time now. From the closet. From the attic. From all around the house. I don’t know if I have a day to live or a week. But it won’t be long now.

And I think I should make a voice memo.

It would be nice for my family members to know what happened to me. To be able to hear my voice, my final moments, whenever this thing chooses to finally take me.

I think they would like that.
