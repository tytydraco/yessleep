Before I start with my real concern, I'm going to explain a little bit of what happened when I was young. I don't want any judgement either. But I’ve done something I shouldn't have. I've grown to understand our school system isn't all like the rest. Though I didn't really come to notice that until I had a kid of my own. 



Let me brief you on my experience:



In my school we had this little ritual song thing we said to each other while we were drinking water from the water fountain. I don't know who started it, or where it came from, but even the teachers seemed to know the little jingle. 



“One, two, three! That’s enough for me!” was chanted behind you, as you gulped down as much water you wanted in the time frame you got. I remember some of the kids would suck on the water dispenser, practically tonguing the thing. Even to me as a child, it was absolutely disgusting.



When I've told this part to some friends, they've said it was really nothing out of the ordinary. I guess this little chant, and the gross kids, have populated the word more than I'd thought. It's not till I get to this next part when I start to get the whites of peoples eyes to show. The blank stares of disbelief. 



Only once, do I remember a kid going against our little chant. The greed. 



This one boy, named Eric. Funny looking fella. Usually all kids have a cute charm to them. I don't really like kids. I was even opposed to having my own at first. That was until I met my son of course. But Eric. He was the type of kid that made you not want kids. Beefy, but tall. You'd think that more height would help distribute some of the fat on this kid, but no. Skinny arms, big belly, and really chubby cheeks. He was one of those kids that always had snot coming out of his nose. Like please someone get this boy a tissue.



I'm not trying to be mean, just trying to explain that this wasn't an accident on his part. In my opinion it was totally deserved.



One day, while we were all lined up at the fountain, after recess. I was about 2 kids behind Eric. Waiting for my turn at the fountain. The teachers, only half paying attention, while they chatted about what traffic was like this morning.



“One, two, three! That's enough for me!” the girl chanted in front of me.



But the line didn't move. I hadn't seen Eric walk to the side, for the next kid to take his place. 

 

“Hey! One, two, three! That's enough for me!” the girl persisted, reaching around the boy in front of her, nudging Eric in the back.



Now everyone was leaning to the side, trying to get a visual of the madman who wasn't listening to the chant. 



I remember the view, Eric had practically his whole mouth around the water spout. Golfing down every drop he could get. Looking as if he was a runt pig, who finally got his shot at the teet. He wanted that water more than air in his lungs.



“HEY! Your turn is over!” Shouted the boy directly behind Eric. He was practically trying to pry Eric off of the water spout. Eventually grabbing the attention of the teachers. 



“What's going on?” Ms. Davis used her less happy voice to exclaim.



“Eric’s going over his turn Ms. Davis!” Said that same girl in front of me. 



“Yeah!” Some of the other kids shouted in agreement.



“Eric! Your peers are saying your turn is over. Please remove yourself from the fountain. I don't want to have to call your mother.” She said in her grown up voice.



Eric hadn't unlatched himself. He was turned just to the side enough that I could see his eyes fixated on the fountain. Practically going cross eyed. Ms. Davis was growing, not mad, but worried? Usually when we don't follow her rules we get lectured. But she didn't seem like she knew how to handle this. She was looking around almost as if she was in trouble. She started tugging at Eric, and tugging led to pulling. But Ms. Davis was not strong enough. Eric's fingers turned white with his grip. 



“Eric please! I'm trying to help you! Well get you some water inside! Please just stop.” Ms Davis was practically pleading, in an almost whisper. Her voice shaking, eyes welling up with tears. Us kids in line, could only look at eachother with confusion. Why was she so worried? 



Our questions would be answered soon enough. Eric didn't let go. What a surprise. Not until something besides water arose from the faucet. With Ms. Davis still tugging, Eric finally detached with a quickened pace. Almost knocking both of them down with his sudden release of the faucet. Confusion arose and fell, when he opened his mouth. Thick, red blood poured from his mouth. He looked terrified as the red (not movie theater red, more like gash on your knee red. You're gonna need stitches, red). We probably looked just as scared. But Ms. Davis. She looked the most frightened by the scene. 



“Eric! What have you done! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!” She was practically shaking him enough to give him a concussion.



Shock had passed over Eric. He was no longer frozen, his body thawed out enough to grab his face. 



Screaming, crying, pulling at his fat face. He fell to the floor



“Mf. Davif!?” He tried speaking through the thick blood, coughing it up. I've always wondered how long it took him before he realized it wasn't water. How greedy do you have to be to not notice blood instead of water going down your throat.



Ms Davis did not look scared for him anymore. More scared for herself. Or scared of him. Though most of the kids had gone inside, there were still some students who were waiting for their turn, including me. She pulled herself together, and stood in front of us, trying to block the scene. Or maybe just distract us.



Other teachers gathered around, just as concerned by the situation at hand. 



“Come on children, let's go inside, and cool off, huh?” She said with a smile, but her eyebrows rang with worry. While she was trying to herd us like sheep, I got a look of what was behind her. And I realized how wrong my first predictions were.



See I thought the blood had come out from the faucet. But no, the closer I looked, I realized that something was wrong with Eric. Even after getting most of the blood out of his mouth he still couldn't speak right. He opened his mouth and all I saw was black and red. No tongue. Holes in his cheek. His flesh melted away. And the boils. I could see boils in his mouth. He sat there on his knees holding his throat. I guessed whatever was in the faucet had caused his throat to burn too.



Eric didn't come back for a while. We were lectured, and reminded of why we have rules, and why we shouldn't go against them. When Eric came back weeks later, he returned with a mask over his face, and bandages over his throat. We all looked at him like he was an animal in an exhibit at the zoo. Inconsiderate of course, but we were children. Once he was reintroduced as part of the class, the whispers started.



“What happened?” The boy who sat next to him whispered.



Eric didn't respond, not to anyone. The teacher didn't even call on him for class reading. The classroom was just as quiet as before. Eric had always been the loudmouth. Not really a class clown, because we all found him annoying. But, it was almost like he never really came back. Nobody in our class used the facets anymore. We all decided on bringing personal water bottles the rest of the year. 



Now, that you're probably wide eyed too, let me explain what I have grown to find out. The truth about not only my school, but my town. I wish I could say the school was evil, or the town was feeding us the blood of dead children. That would make this way more interesting. But no. I actually found this out more in my teen years when we started gaining access to computers. Technology is such a blessing. 



Our school is located just near an old coal mine. Still up and running. I thought most coal mining was finished by the time I was born, but I guess they tried to keep this a secret from most people. It worked I suppose. Kind of wears down the property value. 



Well the thing about coal mines is that it can release acidic water caused by pyrite. This wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't for our town trying to cut down costs, and not deal with the matter by putting in a better filter of sorts. The filter only lasts for so long before it shuts down, and has to be manually restarted. The schools have a system planned that gets everyone off the faucets at a certain time. We weren't allowed to use bathrooms or anything after 2:00pm. That little chant we said. Yeah, that wasn't for us to get water in a timely manner. It was so we didn't cut past the time. Ms. Davis’ class was always last to get water, and alphabetically I'm almost the last in line. So I guess when Eric took too long, he drank about 6 childrens turns of water. Eventually going over the time limit, and the filter shut off before he detached. I'm guessing the acidic water was way more acidic than presumed. It had to be to burn through flesh and all. They haven't fixed this little problem since. How they get away with it? I have no clue.



Now that I've explained everything, I want to preface my reasoning for even telling you. I know what everyone is going to think of me. And, I'm truly sorry. But once I tell you, you will hopefully get why I did this. 



My son. He's 7 years old. I'm pretty sure he has some sort of disorder, as do I. His mom passed away a couple of months ago from a terminal illness, and she was always the one who took care of him. She knew how to calm him down. Now that she's gone, he's been acting even more frantic. He throws tantrums and screams bloody murder when the slightest thing goes wrong. He has a tough time explaining himself, so I am always left confused. I don't know how to deal with him. We never got him tested for anything because we thought it was just regular kid stuff, ya know. After all my wife's hospital bills, I can’t afford more doctors to run test after test like they did with me. 



I'm sure you're seeing what I'm getting at. I'm sure you're mad at me. That's okay though. I didn't expect sympathy from my explanation. Only for you to grasp my reasoning. 



This morning, I crushed up some of my Lithium Carbonate pills I've been taking for my bipolar disorder. They make me really thirsty during the day, I constantly have to drink fluids. 



I sent him to school without a water bottle today. While meeting the teacher, I learned he's also one of the last students to use the water fountain.



I'm sorry, I just want it to be quieter.
