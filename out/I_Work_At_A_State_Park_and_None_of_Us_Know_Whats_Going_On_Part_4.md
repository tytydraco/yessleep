The other day a Boy Scout troop came to the park. The idea was that the group would split in two and one of the groups would hike the West side, and the other would hike the East side and they would meet up at a halfway point on the map. They would use this opportunity to learn how to navigate via a map and compass, as well as learn how to make a camp and how to tear down a camp. People at Richard L. Hornberry generally have no problem tearing down their camp.

However because the scout leaders themselves were completely unfamiliar with the park the job was given to Jordan and I to lead each group. I rather unfortunately got tasked with taking the group that was going up the West side. The brightside is that this was a shorter hike, camping would not necessarily be needed, as the halfway point was the Tin Whistle. I say it wouldn’t necessarily be necessary because most of the time you can make it through the West side into the Pines and over to the Northern part of the East side where the Tin Whistle is in about a day. It is a solid three or four hour hike generally speaking. However, sometimes something strange happens in the Pines. Call it “getting lost” call it whatever, but sometimes it takes longer to get through the Pines than just a few hours. Jordan and Ellen are convinced that sometimes the trail through the Pines gets longer, like it expands and contracts or something. I have always just assumed that this was a pitiful excuse for poor navigation skills getting the two of them lost. But at Richard L. Hornberry, you never know. 

There was another downside though. Not only was I going on the most boring hike, into a part of the park that is notoriously difficult to navigate, but the group of scouts I was tasked with leading were all approximately 8 to 10 years old. I’d be responsible for these snotty brats for the better part of two days and I was not looking forward to that one bit. 

Jordan was leading the highschool aged scouts, and they were doing a longer hike. From the lodge they would go through the southern part of the West side, through the Swamps, up through the East side and eventually would meet up with us at the Tin Whistle the following day. Then we would all hike back through the West side and back to the lodge. That is honestly quite a hike, and I predicted that they would likely be setting up camp somewhere in the middle of the East side and would probably meet us at the Tin Whistle around noon the next day. 

Jordan and I checked our radios and made sure that they were fully charged and functioning. We would definitely need to be able to coordinate our meet up at the Tin Whistle, and of course if anything went wrong then we’d need to be able to let the other group know.

“Ranger James, are you sure you know where we’re going?”

“Pipe down!” I said, beginning to sweat. The Sun was setting and I was sure that I’d lost the trail about an hour and thirty seven minutes ago. 

I picked an arbitrary spot in the woods and said, “Alright kiddos, this is where we will be making camp for the night.”

The scout leader, a young guy not many years older than myself,went about helping the little gremlins get their tents set up. I set up my tent and quickly ducked inside. I was desperately trying to get some kind of GPS signal on my phone. I was unsuccessful. 

I think there is a good reason that no one usually camps in the Pines. Thankfully for the sake of the scouts there was nothing too terribly loud that would have woken them all up in a cold sweat. Before they all went to bed they seemed pretty tired from our long hike that day.

At one point in the night I left my tent to go find a good tree to stand behind. I thought, as I was finishing up, that I saw one of the scouts peeking at me from behind a tree. 

“Hey!” I yelled at him. “Get back to the camp.”

The person I saw quickly ducked their head back behind the tree. I followed after them. The moonlight twinkled around the pine needles, and shone bright enough that I could see my shadow as I walked. 

“Hey buddy, let's get back to camp alright. These woods are dangerous alone at night.” They are dangerous in large groups during the day too but that little amendment is kind of hard to add on to a yell like that. 

The little guy kept poking his head around trees, looking at me and then darting off. I could never really get a good look at him, but he did seem to be about the same size as the kids back at camp. 

“Hey man come on, I’m not in the mood for this right now, it's cold and dark, let’s get back to camp.” 

The little guy never stopped; and before too long I realized that I had been chasing him for a while. I saw him poke his head out from behind the tree just in front of me. 

“Hey!” I said, stepping around the corner; only to find that the kid wasn’t there. There was no one there. 

“Nobody, nobody, nobody,” I heard from above me. I looked up and saw a large crow perched on a branch, silhouetted by the light of the full moon. Maybe it was “No body,” but I couldn’t tell. The crow said it again, cocking his head to look at me. 
“Nobody nobody, no body.” 

I know that it’s normal for the crows around here to talk. I even know that scientifically speaking crows are better at mimicking human speech than parrots. But for whatever reason, in those woods on that night, it freaked me out. I felt cold, the temperature should have been around 40℉ but it felt much, much colder. The crow kept repeating that word, and it felt as sinister as it possibly could. I looked all around me, realizing that I had no idea where I was, or how to get back to the camp.  I started walking in the direction that I thought seemed right, and just stuck with it. After a while I realized that I had chosen wrong. 

I found myself now standing at the Trout Pond. Its inky black surface perfectly reflected the night sky above it, so that it looked like I was standing at a precipice, or before a giant mirror. Then the perfect reflection began to ripple, something, hopefully a trout, must have stirred the surface of the water. However, I couldn’t shake the sense that something was watching me from beneath the surface of the water. 

“Nobody, nobody, nobody.” I heard again from the tree above me. I had a general idea from the Trout Pond where the campsite should be, rather unfortunately it was back the way I came. I turned and began to walk that way. Something I’m still not sure how to explain is how quickly I found the camp from the pond. It was only about ten or so minutes later and I found myself walking back into camp. At the time I was confused, but far too tired, and far too cold to stand around thinking about it, so I climbed back into my tent and went to sleep. 

When daylight finally came I exited my tent, looked around and realized exactly where we were. I guess it was just in the waning light of the evening last that I mistakenly thought I had lost the trail. I could now see the trail just twenty yards away from our campsite. 

I was relieved to discover that the scout leader wasn’t going to bugle to wake the boys up. Everyone was up and ready to go by about 9 a.m. We hit the trail and headed for the Tin Whistle. 
I guess I should explain what the Tin Whistle is. Back before there was a lake here there was a railroad that ran across what is currently the Northern part of the lake. There was also an old road that ran through the area too, while most of the old road is under the lake, the part that goes north is now a trail in the park. The railroad goes over the road, and the road had to pass through a tunnel underneath. The metal tube used to make the tunnel resembles the metal used to make a whistle, and therefore the tunnel is called the Tin Whistle. 

At one point in our hike to the Tin Whistle I noticed a man on the trail some distance ahead. I silently prayed that it would be just a normal hiker and not something strange or otherwise traumatizing to the young kids. The closer we got to him the more familiar he looked. He was walking rather strangely though, staring straight ahead, and seemed to be breathing heavily. 
“Richard?” I called out when he was only a few yards ahead of us.

The man turned.

“Richard! Oh my God it is you.” I felt a little guilty, as in this moment I realized two things. 1. I had found Richard, and 2. I realized that Richard had been missing. Before writing this down I checked my notes and I did in fact mention him in part one. 

“James, hi. I’m just going up to check on the Trout Pond.” He said as if it was old business. Indeed it was very old business. 

“Richard, Phil told you to go do that like last month man. What are you still doing out here.”

“Uh, last month, yeah whatever James, that was probably more like an hour ago.” The poor guy was delusional. Maybe there really is something to that whole expanding trails in the Pines thing. Perhaps it's more accurate to say that the total area of the Pines is a fluctuating measurement and can never truly be pinned down. Sometimes it’s one thing, sometimes it's another. 

Though it could be another thing altogether. Richard was convinced that he had only been out for an hour and that it was in fact still February. He didn’t seem hungry, and he did not have any significant facial hair growth. 

In order to keep the general light hearted atmosphere of a fun hike for the scouts I just told Richard not to worry about the pond and to follow me to the Tin Whistle as we would be meeting up with Jordan there in an hour or so. Richard fell in step with me and we continued the rest of our hike without much interruption, at least until we got close to the Tin Whistle.

I heard the scout leader ask his young scouts to take out their maps and compasses and try to determine the direction of the Tin Whistle. Unfortunately everyone's compass gave a different direction. Somewhat panicked, the scout leader decided that they would just follow his compass bearing and go that way. Unfortunately my own compass was also faulty and at that point in the trail there is a fork. We should really put a sign there. I had never personally been to the Tin Whistle and when I asked Richard if that direction seemed right I found him to be no help. He was just kind of muttering to himself and shaking his head, staring at his boots.

We got to a location that had to be somewhat close, though the Tin Whistle was nowhere in sight, and I radioed in to Jordan to try to get some better directions. Here is my best attempt at a transcript of this conversation

“Hey Jordan, this is James, we need a little help with the directions to the Tin Whistle.”

“Jimmy, my God, Jimmy…wWh…you?

“Jordan, connection’s a little rough. We're in the Pines, could you give us directions to the Tin Whistle?”

“Yes! Go…we've got….ig…tr…Go…then…Tin Whistle.”

“What was that?”

“Go…then…Tin Whistle.”

“Connection’s bad Jordan, we are in the East part of the Pines not far from the fork, we went left. Where are we supposed to go?”

“You've gotta…then…after…Tin Whistle.”

“Jordan I can't hear you.”

“Go……………Tin Whistle”

At that moment the radio began to squeal and squawk like crazy. When Jordan came back over the radio it was chaotic. The following is just what I heard. Most of the discernable words were from Jordan, most of the screams sounded like highschool kids.

“Jimmy we……*screams*... Jimmyyyy…you've gotta…OOOOOO…JIMMY…Foooooooooooooooo……*screaming*

I held the radio away from me while the chaos continued. That “fooooooo” and the “oooooooo” sounded very distant and echoey. I have no idea what it was but it wasn't Jordan. I radioed in because I could tell that this was going nowhere.

“Jordan, I can't hear anything you're saying. We're going to turn around, we'll meet you at the lodge tonight alright. The Lodge.”

From Jordan: “Lodge…alri…*screaming*...”

After that I turned and told the scouts that we were just going to turn around and meet them back at the Lodge. 

Somehow we made it back without any issues, and strangely enough, I think it took like half the time to get back. 

When we got to the Lodge we waited probably two or three hours for Jordan and his crew to come in. When they finally did show up they all had this strange look on their face. I think they call it the thousand yard stare. I tried to ask Jordan what happened but he wouldn't talk. The young scouts asked enthusiastically about their older companions' trip. None of them would talk either. They clambered onto their bus and Jordan, Richard and I stood and waved as they left. Without talking Jordan just looked at me with bloodshot eyes and walked over to his car, got in, and drove home. Richard did the same.

I began to walk back to my cabin, but I thought I'd better go talk to Phil and let him know how everything went.

“Hey Boss,” I said, stepping into Phil’s office.


“Wha…AH! Oh hey Jimmy,” He said in waking.

“Thought I’d tell you how the scout trip went.”

“Oh yeah, well, how’d it go?” Then he sat up and leaned forward, “Everyone make it?” He said with a grave countenance.

“Oh yeah it went really well. I ran across Richard up in the Pines this morning.”

“Richard…Richard…Oh my, yeah Richard. He uh…okay?” 

“Seemed like it. Even though he thought it was still February and I really haven’t seen him since February, that can’t be possible, can it? I mean the guy wasn’t malnourished or anything.”

“Where did you find him?” Boss said. 

“The Pines, like I said.” 

“Oh, my bad Jimmy. Yeah I wouldn’t think too much about it.”

“You also might want to talk to Jordan. We weren’t able to coordinate the meet up at the Tin Whistle so we all just met back at the Lodge. I have no idea what happened with him and his crew but none of them would tell me anything.”

“I’ll look into it,” He said.

“Well, I’m going to turn in. See ya Boss.”

“See ya Jimmy.”

Some of you reading this might be wondering what happened to Part 3. Well quite frankly I took it down. I was getting so many complaints from readers about visions and headaches, and seeing strange shadows move across the sky after reading that I thought it might be best to take it down. In its original form at least. I will link here to a highly edited version, it’s not on nosleep as I don’t want to cause any issues, but you should be able to read it and hopefully you won’t have to worry about the side effects that the previous version brought on. 

Anyway, here is part 3 but proceed with caution
