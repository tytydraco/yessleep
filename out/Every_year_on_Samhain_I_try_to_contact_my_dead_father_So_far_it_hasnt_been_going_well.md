Samhain is almost upon us. Only another night. The prospect has me quite nervous, which is why I've decided to share some of the experiences I've made on this day in the past couple years. To prepare myself for the coming one and take the edge off, so to speak.

All who celebrate do it differently. In itself, the Samhain is a wonderful occasion, in the most literal sense of the word. It's the one night of the year when the two worlds brush against one another, and the veil between the other plane of existence and our own is thinnest. I know a great many people who use this night to pay respects to their late loved ones. Others happily disguise themselves and go around town in groups, dispelling any evil spirits that might have made their way into our midst. Others yet call it Halloween and do the same thing, but for the purpose of obtaining candy.

I do something else. Each year, I perform a ritual to invite one particular entity. And it's the kind that most people would hope to chase away with their masks and scary costumes.

In life, my father was not a good man. I have no doubt he's just as nasty and horrible in death. Still, I need to see him one more time. I didn't get to say goodbye, you understand. There's so much that I've yet to tell him. From the moment I got news of his demise nearly a decade ago, I knew I couldn't go on without speaking to him again.

For a long time, I tried to find him on the night of the thinning veil. I called upon the departed in a great many ways, never to receive an answer. Then I was joined by my companion, whom I met under circumstances I don't wish to disclose as of now. I call them Calloway. Calloway is always by my side, for they haven't earned their right to leave. Their presence allows me to communicate with the dead more effectively. It has been a fruitful acquaintance, although I haven't been able to get through to my father just yet. I've got my hopes high this year, though.

But first things first. Here is what happened on Samhain three years ago, during the first ritual I undertook utilizing Calloway's power.

It began with us building a large bonfire in front of the mound on the outskirts of town. The hill there stands between the houses and the forest's edge, separating settlement from wilderness. It is high and wide and green even in the winter. I have never gone atop. Calloway and I lit our fire at the foot of the mound, a respectful distance away. Sitting in the dry, cold grass, we waited for nightfall. I was meditating in an effort to fortify myself.

But it was not to be.

"You are an awfully nervous person, no?" Calloway asked me.

They had been silent for hardly more than a couple minutes. It's not in their nature to keep still.

"Skin crawling, teeth chattering beneath that affected veneer, am I right?" They plucked out a branch from the crackling fire and angled the smoldering tip into my direction, aiming for my arm. "Maybe if I poked you a couple times, the cracks would start showing. I wonder when you'd shatter."

I gave them a smile. "I'd rather go back to my good-for-nothing ex-husband than let you poke me."

Calloway's face fell. "That's not what I—! You're… Gods, what's wrong with you." They hurled the stick back into the flames. "The mere thought. I think I might be sick."

I laughed and shut my eyes again, straightening my back and taking several deep breaths to steel myself. Irritating though it was to admit, Calloway had a point. My mind was awhirl with doubt and apprehension, more so than the year before. I knew that my reach through the veil would be successful this time. I could not fail with Calloway's aid, but somehow, that made me even more uncertain.

"There are only two tragedies in life: one is not getting what one wants, and the other is getting it," my companion said, prompting me to look at them once more.

"Are you quoting Wilde at me for a specific reason or…?"

"I thought it was a good fit," they replied easily, eyes gleaming in the firelight. "Your… *twitchiness* won't do, you know. You need to be strong for this. How are you to stand your ground against whatever we're about to encounter when you're shaking like a leaf? And, to circle back to Wilde, what are you going to do should we meet the one you're looking for?"

"I'll know when it happens."

"Will you, though?" Calloway leaned back on their lower arms, stretching their lanky body. "You never struck me as the type to think on your feet when you're emotional."

I was about to argue when they held up a silencing finger. "Emphasis on \*when you're emotional\*. We both know you can be a heartless little plight, and that's honestly when you're at your best. And your best is pretty damn amazing, I'll concede to that much."

"Is that a compliment? How unexpected."

"It's a begrudging admission." They tipped their head back to gaze into the ever-darkening sky. "Seeing as I've no other option than to work with you, I would like for this to go as smoothly as possible. For that, I need the aforementioned stone-cold pest, not the trembling damsel."

"So what would you have me do?"

"When you feel the veil parting, *focus*. It'll be… wildly confusing. You'll see figures, dancing with us around the fire. Those are nothing to be alarmed by. Simply leave them be. But look into their faces, because one of them might just be your father. That's why you'll need to concentrate on his image. Wipe your mind of all other thoughts." Calloway pointed at my backpack, resting beside me in the grass. "You did bring a personal effect of his like I asked, didn't you?"

I nodded, reaching into the pack to produce my father's tarnished brass knuckles. They felt far colder and heavier than they ought to.

"That… that's the item you chose?" Calloway asked, looking askance at the weapon.

"It belonged to Dad and he carried it on his person at all times. It meets the criteria."

Calloway frowned but refrained from commenting further. I was grateful for it. I had one more question for them. "You won't run away from me when the worlds brush, will you?"

Calloway stayed silent, a smug little grin on their face.

"You won't run away from me, will you?"

Still nothing.

The third time I asked, Calloway could no longer ignore me. Their features mirrored my own irritation as they blurted out, "I would if I could, but I can't so I won't!" They shut their mouth again immediately, touching their lips with their fingertips as if in disbelief. Then, they trained their vexed expression on me once more. "There. Are you satisfied, you little pest?"

"Plenty."

"That was beyond violating."

I shrugged. "I won't apologize. You *made* me force the truth out of you. Spare me the breath next time and be honest from the get-go."

"Spare you the breath… I wish you'd stop breathing altogether! I simply wanted to keep you on edge. You're even harder to bear when you're feeling superior."

"Then why don't you do both of us a favor and stop talking to me?" I suggested. "Conversation is wholly unnecessary right now."

That hit the spot. After throwing me one final insulted glare, Calloway clamped up, plopped back into the grass and went back to watching the stars. Blessed silence.

Night fell, darkness settling over the mount. The moon and the stars, though bright, were partly obscured by thick clouds. My companion rose to their feet and proceeded to flex their arms. The firelight lent their long flaxen hair a blazing red sheen. “We can begin,” they said, turning to face me with a set jaw. I, too, arose to stand beside them. With visible reluctance, they gathered my hands in their own. A deep focus entered their gaze as they began to speak their Samhain prayer. I’d heard and read quite a few prayers for this occasion, but never one quite like Calloway’s—the words were tailored to fit them, fit their nature. Spoken by a mere human, such an invocation would not even make sense.

*“They’ve laid bare the fields and hung their herbs,*

*they’ve mourned their sun retreating.*

*Now winter comes and darkness comes, and brethren, we come with it.*

*They’ve cast their circles and bowed to pray,*

*to call forth those who were.*

*Now fathers, mothers, lovers come, and brethren, we come with them.*

*They’ve donned their masks and turned their cloaks,*

*but heed not their disguises.*

*For winter comes and darkness comes, and brethren, we come with it.”*

As Calloway’s voice grew louder, I began to hear—feel? a low thumping, like a large drum being beaten somewhere in the ground. The vibration seemed to carry through the earth, seizing my feet in its surreal, foreboding rhythm. My muscles suddenly ached to move, my whole body was itching to writhe and twist and *dance*. But I dared not break my companion’s gaze, despite the strange sense of ecstasy growing stronger by the moment. The crackling of the fire had intensified. The flames themselves seemed to come alive, devouring the wood with more ferocity than ever.

*“The moon is out, she dares not wink,*

*the gate is open wide.*

*The fog has thinned and darkness comes, and brethren, we come with it.”*

*I spotted movement in my peripheral vision, figures like shadows coming into the very edge of my view. They were inching closer, approaching from within the fire. My heart beat in sync with the eerie unseen drum, the sound mingling with countless muted whispers. Calloway’s tone had become harsher, louder, wilder—there was a perverse, ominous delight swinging along in their words.*

*“The fields are bare, the sun is gone,*

*the time of light is over.*

*Come forth, brethren, we fly in flocks,*

*and we’ll make this night* **ours**.”

With that, Calloway tore their hands out of my grasp and spun around to face the fire. They spread their arms, leaning close to the flames as if to embrace them, and let out a deafening scream of joy. Welcomed by my companion's fervor, the figures I'd seen creeping around the firepit poured forth into the night. I found myself surrounded by several dozen people, some decidedly corporeal, with wings and claws and horns and frightening grimaces. Others were more like shapes, their outlines flickering like the light of a candle as they began their dance around the fire. Others still looked rather quite a lot like myself and Calloway, with the right amount of arms and legs. Their bodies and faces were beautiful in an almost disturbing way—I lack the words to describe it.

However, as much as I might have liked to, this was not the time to observe the oddities around me.

Ignoring the swelling cacophony of whispers, hushed conversations and faint laughter, I grabbed the brass knuckles that used to be my father's, and, taking a deep breath, tossed them into the flames. "I call upon the spirit of Lawrence Volkov, gone but not forgotten and once more, tonight, alive!" I screamed at the very top of my lungs. The words had barely left my lips when I felt my wrists being seized—Calloway had grabbed me and was spinning me around in a circle, again and again, before releasing me to stagger backwards into the crowd. Giving in to the euphoria, I allowed myself to get swept up in the movement. Together with the other spirits, I ran around the fire, jumping over the flames and yelling when I felt them lapping at my ankles. I quickly lost sight of my companion, but told myself it didn't matter. Calloway had done their part, I hoped.

I scanned the faces of the other dancers, watched them cackle with the exhilaration of their release into the mortal realm. Yet none of them looked familiar. I knew my father would be among the flock. He'd show up sooner or later, surely. Perhaps I needed to wait a bit longer. And to keep dancing, of course.

Keep. Dancing.

That's when I realized. My feet seemed to be moving on their own, my body swayed and turned to the beat of the drum on its own accord. I couldn't stop it anymore. What little control I'd had over myself, I had undoubtedly lost it somewhere along the way.

My blood ran cold when I noticed my legs were carrying me ever-closer to the fire. The ecstatic, nervous glee that had filled me moments prior gave way to raw terror as I tried and failed to keep my limbs still. No matter how hard I willed my muscles to cease their twitching, they didn't obey.

I realized in horror that I was more or less doomed. Getting too close to the flames meant a certain, agonizing death. If I were to trip and fall, the others would trample me to mush. Even if I managed to stay on my feet, there was only so much a human body could do. Sunrise was not to come for hours. If whatever power was controlling me forced me to keep dancing until then, I would not live to see the morning. My lungs or my heart were bound to give out, and I would drop dead in the grass.

I thought feverishly, drawing upon my last shred of mental fortitude. I needed to come up with something, and quickly. When did I start dancing? When did my body stop obeying my orders? What happened before?

I'd still been in control of myself when I threw the brass knuckles into the fire and summoned my Dad. That was something I actively wanted to do. Neither my arms nor my lips had been acting on their own. Shortly after, I'd started dancing. Something must have happened in between, something that made me lose power over myself.

And then it came to me. *Calloway.*

Calloway had spun me around, and after they'd let go of me, I had *staggered*. It was them. The bastard had tricked me.

The knowledge alone gave me back at least a tiny bit of command. Enough to rear my head and yell their name into the crowd. I shouted it once, twice, thrice, and upon the third call, they appeared before me. Their cheeks reddened by the firelight, they stared down at me with wide eyes. Their gaze spelled shock, and, oddly enough, guilt.

I grabbed them by the collar of their woolen brown sweater and pulled them close, hissing right into their face, "What did you do to me?"

They squirmed, trying to bat my hand away, but I didn't let them. My blood was still singing in my veins and I was trembling all over, the need to join the dancing throng again threatening to overtake me. Even so, I managed to stay focused. "What did you do to me?" I repeated.

"I wasn't going to hurt you!" A pause. "Not… *badly,*" they added, hanging their head.

"What did you do to me?"

"It's only a small charm. Tiny, really. I can make it go away like this." With a sigh, they snapped their fingers. "There. All good."

The burning ache to move subsided. I let go of a long breath when the familiar weight of consciousness returned to my limbs. I flexed my fingers and wriggled my toes in my shoes, relieved to find that I had regained total authority once more. The beating of the drum was still there, though, beckoning me into the dancers' midst. Only now it was much easier to ignore.

"Why?" I asked, in a cold voice.

"*Why*?" Calloway threw their head back, laughing. "She asks *why*! Ramona, do you have any idea how long it'll take to find your father? There's no telling if he's even heard your call from the other side! Or if he even wants to come to you! It's a one in a millionchance."

"So what was your master plan here?"

"To scare you. With the veil this thin, I was able to put a spell on you. I figured once you realized, I'd have enough leverage to make you release me from our contract. You'd abandon that hare-brained plan of yours or at least leave me out of it." Calloway rubbed the back of their neck. "I thought a small brush with death might set you right. I wouldn't have killed you, mind. All I wanted was to get you into a position where I could force you to free me."

I listened, arms crossed. When I didn't respond right away, Calloway seemed to grow uneasy. "Let's face it," they began, "it'd be for your own good. You'd be better off celebrating Samhain in a more wholesome way instead of bargaining with my kind.”

I took a deep breath. “Heed me, fiend. I’m keeping you until you’ve made good on your promise. We made a deal, and until you’ve held up your end, you will do as I say. *You will do as I ask.*”

“That’s madness! Who knows how many Samhains it’ll take us to find him! Do you intend to keep me on your leash for an unspecified amount of years?”

“So you do get it.”

Calloway went white as a sheet. Their blood was boiling under their skin. I could see it plain as day, in the way they gritted their teeth, the way they clenched their fists.

Good.

“There.” I patted their slender shoulder. It was taut as a bowstring. “We understand each other. You go now, enjoy your night with your brethren. It’ll be a whole year ‘til you’ll see them again, after all.”

“You are… so awful. You are awful, awful, awful,” Calloway whispered, voice deadly soft and full of disdain.

“You know what you did,” I reminded them. “You deserve this. It’s your fault and yours alone that you’re in this position. You swore that you would make things right. I’m only holding you to it.”

“Just you wait,” they uttered. “Oh, the things I’m going to do to you once I’m free…”

I let out a laugh. “Well, if it’ll take us as long as you say, I’ll have lived a rich and full life in the meantime. All I know for sure is that you just wasted a perfectly good opportunity to make good on your promise. Now, we’ll have to wait until next year at the very least. And only because you tried to get ahead.” I tilted my head at them. “Take this as a learning experience, why don’t you.”

With that, I turned on my heel, picked up my backpack from where it was lying discarded in the grass and began marching off into the direction of the settlement. “Douse the fire when you’re done,” I called over my shoulder.

“I hate you!” Calloway yelled after me. “I hate you so much it hurts!”

“Then you should have killed me when you had the chance!”

To be honest, I had no idea why they hadn’t.
