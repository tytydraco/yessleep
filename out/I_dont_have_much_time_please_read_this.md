Hey, my name is Augusto Eduardo Traniella, and right now I'm under the bed, scared and fearing for my life, 'cause my friend Alan, the Honduran guy, started acting weird a while back.

It all started a couple of hours ago when we were watching the new episode of *Familia Medina*. We were all hyped 'cause they were gonna introduce a new character to the show, but then Miguels gets up to go take a dump. I tell him, yeah, go ahead, but make sure you don't steal the pipes this time. Everyone's on the edge of their seats for the new character, trying to contain our excitement. Then a curtain opens, and they introduce him: it was none other than Lucifer, the lord of darkness.

Out of nowhere, everyone goes crazy and starts mutilating themselves, chopping off limbs. Lucas pulls out a sawed-off shotgun from his ass and shoots himself, splattering the walls with super realistic brains and blood. I try to call the ambulance, but when I pick up the phone, I hear a moan, like someone's enjoying themselves. Super confused, I try to call the police, but when I try to dial 911, the number changes to 666.

All my friends were dead; they'd all killed themselves right in front of me. The scene was horrible. The only one left alive was Alan, the Honduran guy, 'cause he was sitting in front of the TV, still and unfazed. I wanted to ask him if he was okay, but out of nowhere, he turns around and says to me: "They all deserved it, now they're more beautiful."

And then he gets up and starts convulsing while standing, just like Mr. Crocker from *The Fairly OddParents*. I was terrified and almost crying; I ran to my parents' room and hid under the bed. Now I'm writing this, hiding and fearing for my life, 'cause I hear Alan's footsteps, and he falls and convulses every two steps. I think this is the end for me 'cause there's nothing left to do. Alan found my dad's machete and is gonna find me and chop me up alive.

By accident, I move my foot, which gives a little tap on the bed leg. Suddenly, the footsteps get faster, and I hear them getting closer and closer. I'm sorry, Mom and Dad, I won't make it today. Alan finally finds me and starts to pull out his machete, but before anything happens, an avalanche of sewage water with excrement and pee floods the whole house, covering everything up to the ceiling. Turns out it was Miguel who clogged the toilet, and the toilet exploded violently, filling the whole house with poop.

In the great avalanche, you could see Miguel being dragged away and asking for help. The aforementioned avalanche engulfs Alan and pushes him against a lit lamp that breaks, giving way to an explosion that destroys my house, and only rubble remains. I was on the ground without an arm or a leg, fighting for my life. Miguel would have been propelled by the explosion and would have a concrete beam stuck in his anal rectum.

Then I thought that at least I could go in a more dignified way, having killed Alan, the murderer of my friends. But out of nowhere, he gets up, dusts himself off, and tells me that it was all part of his plan: to put Lucifer on TV, to make a pact with my friends so they would kill themselves in horrible ways, to leave an erotic magazine in the bathroom to force Miguel to clog the sewer. All to get to me. Now I understand everything, so my life ends. Alan lunges at me and starts pulling out my guts and limbs and starts to tear me apart....

I'm writing this from beyond the grave so that none of you go through what happened to me with this story that's 100% real and true. With nothing more to say, goodbye.
