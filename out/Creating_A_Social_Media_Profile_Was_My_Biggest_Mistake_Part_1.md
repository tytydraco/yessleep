I have always loved the idea of anonymity. My laptop is the second thing I touch in the morning after my alarm clock, to check if it's still connected to the VPN. I have never had any real social accounts on any site whatsoever. I never wished to give them my data and thereby my very privacy, which is priceless.

Messaging apps for me have been equally pointless. Even browsers, the ones with trackers, location access, and what not; irk me to the core. Even the ones that claim absolute privacy are lying in one way or another.

I refrain from uploading my photos not just on social sites but on professional sites as well. I recall one incident when I hadn't uploaded my actual photo on a job portal, and because of that, I had almost lost the job. To this day, I know I would have preferred losing the job over losing my privacy.

But time and influence are powerful things. To a few colleagues, I was an early man, a caveman who didn't understand the importance of revealing his every move on social media… huh. They'd often suggest that I join one photo-sharing site, which is extremely popular among clowns who value likes and comments over privacy.

Some family members kept insisting as well. To them too, I was some ape who should jump between trees instead of living among modern humans.

These things began to weigh on me, and honestly, I didn't want to disappoint them. They didn't want to harm me; they only wanted my social media presence. And I couldn't resist, nor did I want to lose my privacy, and the only way to win on both fronts was to create a fake account, one that would be mine but not me. And that was what mattered most.

But privacy is not just about uploading a fake profile picture; it's about lying about yourself; doing and saying the opposite, and sometimes worse, of what you actually do. I forewarned my friends and family that I wouldn't be revealing any work, school, or interest-related details of my own, but that I'd be faking them too. I didn't want to be tracked by my choices either.

Because choices are just personas wrapped in translucency that eventually become transparent.

The next day, my alarm rang, and as usual, I hit snooze and picked up the laptop. It was a day I was feeling particularly low. I felt like a spy from some highly discreet intelligence agency who had suddenly been assigned the task of revealing every detail about himself and his operations.

I intended to be as fake as possible, but the very architecture of the web doesn't let you fake things for long. There's always someone who knows exactly who you are, even when you're rejoicing in the belief that you're completely masked.

Besides using fake names, I planned to use a dangerous-looking man for the profile picture, so that most people; especially friends of friends, would think twice before sending a request, and ideally, not send one at all.

I turned the VPN on first, opened a privacy-focused browser that doesn't track, and then typed the address. The website initially loaded partially broken in places, as if it had been punched.

And I knew exactly what had punched it, my VPN.

Websites like that despise VPNs; they start lagging the moment they detect one. If those websites are thieves; and they are, then VPNs are law enforcement.

After a while…

…reloading… “Welcome to [REDACTED].”

I had all the necessary fake data ready to upload and type.

I used the name **"Thamior Voss".**

And an ordinary password, because I had no attachment to the account. If it got deleted, I could create another one anytime.

Now came the real part, the profile picture, and for that, I asked an AI to generate one. A guy who looked less human and more threatening, whose appearance alone would make people avoid sending friend requests and block him instead. The more blocks I received, the more privacy I would claim.

And there we had Thamior; a man who looked not just otherworldly, but deliberately inhuman.

I already had plans for the account; I would periodically change the profile picture and never settle on a single one.

My VPN gave up the next moment because my antivirus unnecessarily took over.

It felt like I was writing a movie character with what I did next. I added fake professional details, a fictional city, which the site wouldn't allow, so I made him live in a lesser-known town, roughly a hundred miles from my own.

The “about” section had to threaten and repel, not welcome; therefore, it was written accordingly:

*"This is Thamior. I don't like people. In fact, I hate them. Prefer not sending me a friend request."*

The interests needed to be equally otherworldly and off-putting, so I added:

*“Stalking”*

That was it. The profile was complete, awaiting friend requests from those who had insisted I create one. But I also had to send a few, otherwise no one would know I was done with the fake ID creation. So I sent requests to a select group of colleagues.

Lana accepted instantly; perhaps she was online. Even if she hadn't been, she would have accepted without thinking twice. Her friend list spoke for itself; “2283” friends, seriously?! How many of those even care that you exist?

Lana was the kind of person who accepted requests without thinking. She once said profiles were *“vibes, not résumés.”*

And her message arrived immediately:

“Ah, the guy in your dp looks creepy but charming, hmmm…”

I didn't reply because I wasn't connected to the VPN and logged out.

It was already past 11 at night, and I hadn't been to the gym. I had forgotten amid all the account creation. I collapsed onto the bed moments later.

The alarm rang again. I snoozed it and opened the laptop.

First, I opened the site to see how Thamior was doing. There were unknown friend requests and message requests as well.

Then my eyes landed on Thamior's timeline. There was a check-in. It was my city. Yesterday at 11:57 pm. I dismissed it as something I must have done while half asleep.

And I left for work.

At the office, after lunch, I casually opened Thamior’s profile again, and in that moment, I realised I was getting addicted, one way or another, to social media. Once you start receiving requests, curiosity follows; and curiosity means your mind has been hacked remotely. Imagine what I would have become if the profile were real.

There were more requests, more “People you may know,” and more message requests. Then I opened the profile, and that’s when the shock surfaced. The “about me” section had been changed:

**“The name is Thamior. I like people. Let's be friends.”**

I was a complete dumbass when it came to social sites, and I barely understood how they worked. I assumed the platform had censored or altered what I wrote earlier. Perhaps the site didn’t allow people to be openly unwelcoming.

Five hours later, at home, I was talking to a friend when I  got a notification on the site.

I checked a few new message requests and deleted them. But it wasn't the requests that unsettled me; it was a chat, already opened; with someone named “Sophia.” It read:

“Hey… Thamior, wanna have some fun?”

“Fun sounds good. Let's meet tomorrow at [REDACTED] Area, house number: [REDACTED] by 11 pm.”

I was shocked. I didn't remember sending anything like that to anyone. Sophia sounded like an escort, but what truly concerned me was my reply. The address was mine, and it was 9 am when I read it.
This version keeps your voice, rhythm, and density intact, just with sharper words and fewer soft spots.

I shut the laptop and sat there for a long time, trying to convince myself that this was still something I could undo.
