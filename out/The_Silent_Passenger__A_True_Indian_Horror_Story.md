It was around 3 a.m. when I left Nagpur, heading toward Seoni on my bike. The air was damp, heavy with the smell of rain-soaked soil. I had a night shift at work, and my manager had asked me to drop off some documents in Seoni before morning. Normally, I’d never drive that route so late, but I didn’t have a choice.

The highway was almost empty—just an occasional truck rumbling past. I turned up my jacket collar and rode faster. About halfway through the forest stretch, I noticed something strange: a woman walking alone by the roadside.

She wore a pale red saree, her hair tied loosely, and she was barefoot.

At first, I slowed down, thinking maybe she needed help. But as I got closer, I realized she was walking perfectly still—her feet didn’t move, yet she seemed to glide forward.

My stomach twisted.

I blinked once—and she was gone.

I tried to laugh it off, told myself it was the fog playing tricks. But when I looked in my bike’s rearview mirror, she was sitting behind me.

My throat went dry. I couldn’t feel her weight, but I could see her reflection—hair covering her face, the red saree blowing in the wind.

I shouted, “Who are you?!” and twisted the throttle to full speed. My bike roared through the night, but no matter how fast I went, her reflection stayed perfectly still—right behind me.

Then she whispered, so close to my ear that I could feel the cold breath:


“You shouldn’t have looked back.”



I swerved, nearly losing control, and when I finally stopped near a roadside dhaba, the seat was empty. I jumped off, heart pounding, and stumbled toward the small building.

The dhaba was dark except for a single dim lantern. An old man sat at a corner table, sipping tea.

He looked up as I entered. “You saw her, didn’t you?”

I froze. “What do you mean?”

He sighed. “The woman in red. She’s been here for years. Died in an accident on this road. People say she asks for rides—or just appears behind you. If you talk to her, she follows you home.”

My hands trembled. “She—she spoke to me.”

The man’s eyes widened. He stood up quickly, grabbed a small brass bowl filled with ash from the counter, and muttered a prayer. Then he sprinkled some ash on my helmet and said, “Don’t look behind you tonight. No matter what you hear. Ride straight to Seoni, don’t stop for anyone.”

I nodded and left. The moment I started the bike again, the road ahead felt endless. Every shadow looked alive. Every gust of wind carried whispers.

Half an hour later, I began to hear footsteps behind me—not from the road, but from right behind my seat. Soft. Wet. Rhythmic.

Then, I felt a hand on my shoulder. Cold. Damp. Unmistakably human.

I screamed, but the sound was lost in the roar of the engine. I didn’t dare turn around. I kept riding until I saw the first lights of Seoni. When I finally reached my office, I stopped the bike, dropped the keys, and ran inside.

Everyone stared at me. My face was pale, my hands shaking. One of my colleagues asked if I was okay.

I said, “She was behind me the whole way.”

They looked confused. Then one of them pointed at my jacket and said, “Whose handprint is that?”

I looked down. There it was—a muddy, blood-stained handprint on my right shoulder.

That night, I stayed in Seoni. I didn’t sleep at all. Around midnight, my hotel room’s window creaked open. The curtain moved though there was no wind. And faintly, in the darkness, I heard the same whisper again:


“You shouldn’t have looked back.”



The next morning, the staff found muddy footprints leading from the corridor straight to my room—and ending at my bed.

I don’t travel at night anymore.

Even now, when I ride past that stretch in daylight, my bike mirror sometimes flickers…
and for a split second, I see her sitting there—still, silent, watching.
