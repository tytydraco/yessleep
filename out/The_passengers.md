The passengers


Steve stood next to his car in the company’s lot and blew out a long sigh. He loosened his tie, ran his fingers through his hair, and gave the car door a quick, frustrated kick. Not hard enough to leave a mark—he loved it too much for that—but enough to let it know how he felt. The November evening had turned into a flurry of snow, ice already creeping across the ground, and his BMW had chosen this moment to play dead. Muttering curses under his breath, he scanned the near-empty car park for a solution.

Only one other car was still there: Edmund’s, from data input on the floor below. Quiet, polite, and always in his own world, Edmund was a mystery wrapped in tweed. Steve had seen him at lunch, reading novels or staring off into the distance like he was watching something invisible. Steve prided himself on noticing everyone, no matter how flamboyant or shy, for moments just like this.

Edmund emerged from the building, almost summoned by fate. Head down, long, dark hair ruffling in the cold breeze, his wool coat flapped around his tall frame. Papers juggled in one hand, satchel slung across his shoulder, he fished for his keys with the other, seemingly unaware that Steve was waiting for him.

Steve pushed off his car and approached with a bright, easy smile. “Hey, uh, Edmund. My car’s dead as a doornail, man. You live near me, right?”

Edmund looked up, blinking twice. His dark eyes, soft and deep under the fluorescent lights, seemed to weigh Steve’s words. Snowflakes dusted his shoulders as he tilted his head, waiting.

Steve added quickly, “I don’t need you to take me all the way home—just as close as you pass by, save me a taxi fare.”

Edmund considered this for a brief moment, then nodded towards his Saab. “You’ll need to sit in the back. Right-hand side. Keep your briefcase on your lap. Do you agree to this?”

It was the first time Steve had ever really heard Edmund’s voice—calm, quiet, carrying a kind of gravity. He nodded, maybe a bit too eagerly. “Yeah, no problem. Picking up someone else, too?”

Edmund’s lips curved into a soft, almost secretive smile. “Something like that. Get in.”

He unlocked the doors, and Steve climbed into the back seat.

Instead of turning right onto the main highway—bright, busy, and always crowded—Edmund turned left, down a hidden lane that passed by the old church near their office. Steve watched the two towering rowan trees at the gate, skeletal and ancient in winter’s chill. They looked like silent sentinels, and he shivered.

“Is this a quicker way home?” he asked, leaning forward. “I always take the highway.”

Edmund’s gaze stayed on the narrow lane ahead. “It can be. It depends on the time of year.” And then he fell silent again, eyes fixed on the winding path.

They passed cottages with wild, tangled gardens, and open fields where horses huddled in loose groups, breath steaming in the cold. The only sounds were the purr of the Saab’s engine and the quiet hush of tires on the wet road. Light from the occasional window spilled briefly into the car before the darkness swallowed it again.

The lane narrowed, hedges crowding in, and the darkness grew thicker—no longer grey, but a deep, complete black. The headlights cut a small circle of light ahead, but the edges of the world were hidden and silent.

The car slowed and rose up a small mound. Steve felt the rumble of water below them as they crossed a long, unseen bridge. Edmund stopped the car at the crest and reached into the passenger footwell, pulling out a towel. With careful, almost reverent movements, he smoothed it over the front passenger seat.

Steve swallowed, words catching in his throat. A rush of cold air swept in as the door opened. He saw a pale, almost translucent figure slip inside, long dark hair wet and trailing over her slender shoulders. In the brief glow of the dome light, he caught the soft, haunted lines of her face—a young woman, still and silent.

Edmund smiled at her as though she was an old friend, then turned back to the road and drove on, the car pressing into the darkness.

The scent of river stones and cold water filled the car, mingling with the musty tang of fallen leaves. Steve pressed himself deeper into the seat, heart hammering, saying nothing.

The road rose again, the engine growling softly. For a moment, the cloudy night sky flashed through the windscreen before the car plunged back down a lane lined by ancient oaks and stone walls, their shadows looming like watchful giants.

They drove for what felt like miles, until the car slowed beside a massive oak tree, its gnarled trunk cloaked in ivy. In the faint glow of the dome light, Steve saw the thick roots like the grasp of some slumbering beast.

He lifted a hand to point at it, turning to speak to Edmund, but the words froze in his mouth. Orange light flickered as the door opened again, and another passenger climbed in.

The smell of fresh earth and old woods filled the car, and a low voice boomed with gentle authority. “Hello. Well, I didn’t expect you tonight. But there’s enough room for us all.” The man’s face was deeply lined, with a broad, stubborn nose and wide yellowed teeth. His rough woolen coat was heavy and corse, patterned with oak leaves and ivy.

He leaned in close, pressing the hard muscle of his arm against Steve’s side, and laid a large, wrinkled hand on the young woman’s shoulder. She lifted her own pale hand to rest on his, head tilting with a sad, tender smile.

Edmund shifted the car back into gear with a soft clunk, and the Saab drove on.

Steve huddled against the door, breath shallow, heart racing. Outside, the darkness pressed close, the only light a shifting pool in front of the car. The scent of riverbeds and forest floor filled his senses, heavy and ancient.

They drove on in silence until the car pulled into a layby, beside a cattle gate that opened into a frost-silvered field. Cows stood motionless, breath steaming like engines in the night.

The door opened once more, and the cold air that rushed in this time stayed. In the brief orange glow, Steve, unable to help himself, turned his head, eyes wide, and saw only an outline this time: the shape of an old-fashioned hat, a thin, long coat that rustled as its occupant settled in, and features hidden by shadows and darkness. In gloved hands, it held a black leather-bound book, a sheaf of papers, and what he assumed was some kind of ship’s compass that glowed with a sapphire blue light, shifting between lighter and darker hues as it turned in its owner’s quick fingers. Fascinated by what he was seeing, Steve quickly turned back to the window at his side when the mysterious new passenger turned his shadowed face sharply toward him.

Edmund, once again, put the car in gear and drove back onto the road, following the small circle of light as it pushed aside the inky darkness surrounding it.

As the trees, high hedgerows, and stone walls flashed past, Steve realized that the darkness outside was thinning, and a pale grey was creeping in. Again, as Edmund slowed and allowed the car to drift over to the right side of the now-widening road, Steve closed his eyes tight and whispered a half-remembered prayer from his childhood.

The car stopped.

Feeling the gentle rock and a heavier one as the bark-skinned fellow beside him shuffled and carefully climbed out the opposite door, Steve opened his eyes. Two figures—the young girl and his previous seatmate—walked side by side toward a hooded figure standing by the tree line a short distance away. Upon reaching him, they exchanged brief but unseen words, nodding at the gestures from the cloaked being. They hugged each other with genuine warmth before departing, melting into the gaps in the trees along separate paths.

Steve felt his skin try to stay seated as his bones and flesh threatened to burst through the car’s roof when the third passenger leaned inside and touched his arm. A voice felt, not heard, whispered: “Thank you for your company, my friend. But alas, this was not yours to see. Wraiths of thought may linger for a while, but they will fade eventually, as does everything. Goodbye.”

As Edmund steered the old Saab out from under the overhanging, bare branches that lined the lane—now thinner and more staggered—Steve noticed a lone streetlight casting its orange glare downwards, others in the distance, closer together. He settled back in his seat, thoughts drifting to his warm house, maybe a sly beer before supper. He thought, “I wonder if that really was a quicker way home? I’ll stick to the highway, though—I prefer the company of other cars.” And then he shivered, though he didn’t know why.
