When your grandfather has spent a week at the hospital and is due to come home soon, you probably want him to come back to a clean house, or at least, that's what i and my mother wanted, but as i loaded the shop vac into the car, my mother made a strange request.

&#x200B;

'Oh by the way, there is a door to the right near the end of the hall, don't go in there, it doesn't need cleaning, if it's already open, just close it'

&#x200B;

I remembered that door from my childhood, and there was never anything in there, just old junk, it was indeed a storage room, but why would she insist on keeping it closed? 

&#x200B;

As i let myself in with the key i noticed how untouched the whole place was, my grandmother had passed some 20 odd years prior but it was like nothing ever happened.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As i wheeled the shop vac across the carpet, i noticed another vac at the end of the hall, it was an older model but still looked decent, it sat there, screaming 'use me!' even though i had a far superior one for the occasion.

&#x200B;

After i did the hall i went into the front room, and i only did a quick tidy because it seemed clean enough already, but in the corner, was another vac, the same model as the one in the hall, i shrugged it off, it's not uncommon for a house to have mutiple vacuum cleaners in use.

&#x200B;

As far as the downstairs went, i left the kitchen for last, as i was surveying the room i noticed there was a small storage area towards the back.

&#x200B;

And poking out of all the miscellany? was the handle for yet another one of those vacuum cleaners, i assumed he just really likes that model and has several for spare parts as i got to work.

&#x200B;

As i walked upstairs, i noticed it again, at the end of the hall, another one, thankfully there wasn't another one in the rooms and i walked downstairs to prepare to pack up.

&#x200B;

I thought the amount of the same vacuum cleaner was strange but not out of the ordinary, i'd counted 6-7 and one was in storage.

&#x200B;

As i surveyed the hall one last time, the door caught my eye, what is in there? i thought, i decided i'd have a sneaky look.

&#x200B;

I started recording on my phone with the light and slowly opened the door, it was dark, the lights were off and the windows were covered, but with the phone light i could see all around, those same vacuum cleaners again! if you thought 6 or 7 were a lot, there was at least 30 packed into this room, amongst other things.

&#x200B;

I stepped in, trying to navigate the maze of vacuum cleaners, i've always been an investigative nosey type, i never take no for an answer, if someone is hiding something from me, i'll do my damndest to find out what that thing is, so i was exploring the room, trying to find the secret.

&#x200B;

When suddenly, without warning, the door slammed shut, i ran to open it, thinking it was just an air thing, but it wouldn't budge, that's when one of the vacuums turned on, followed by another one and another one, it become deafeningly loud, almost like a jet plane taking off.

&#x200B;

And they started moving, cornering me, the 30 odd vacuum cleaners in the room had formed into a crescent formation, and then my phone died, damn, i had forgot to charge it, and recording had obviously used up what little battery there was, now all i could see was an army of lights.

&#x200B;

They all suddenly stopped, was this some kind of prank? some anti-burglar thing? those thoughts were cut off when i felt the tentacles, or more exactly, the wires for the vacuum cleaners.

&#x200B;

But as soon as it started, i heard a banging against the door, something with wheels and quite heavy seemed to be ramming into the door, after 4 or 5 smashes, it clicked open and light flooded in.

&#x200B;

To my surprise, it was the shop vac, it burst into the room, being pursued by the 6 other vacuum cleaners that were in the house.

&#x200B;

I watched in amazement as the shop vac whipped around, smashing with it's nozzle every other vacuum cleaner, parts flew everywhere, it then finished the performance by discharging it's entire load at a small group of the vacuum cleaners that had survived the initial carnage.

&#x200B;

And just like that, the shop vac went limp, it's smily face glowing in the light from the door.

&#x200B;

I made a quick call on the house phone, explaining i needed to do some extra work before coming home, i explained something had gone funny with the shop vac resulting in it exploding the dirt everywhere.

&#x200B;

I bagged up the smashed vacuum cleaners, with the intention of getting it all recycled and leaving no evidence.

&#x200B;

Of course, granddad wondered where his vacuum cleaners had gone, i just told him i tested them and got rid of them because none worked, i replaced them with a shop vac, similar to the one i used.

&#x200B;

When i dug the shop vac out of storage next, i said.

&#x200B;

'Thanks henry, for saving me from the dysons'
