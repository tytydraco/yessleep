I’m back. I had to shake off what was either a tail or a salaryman with a staring problem. I probably should have waited to upload this until I had it all written out but I was worried about them deleting it or something. All going well, this will wrap things up, though not satisfactorily as you'll see. Looks like you can still read [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1onhu7k/i_was_a_salvage_diver_we_found_something_in_an/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), hopefully it isn't just on my end. I think they’ve got a cell jammer because my hotspot isn’t working well. God I hope this gets out. I think I left off when that thing ran from us. I had closed the door and…

I breathed as deeply as I could to try and calm myself, my hand staunching my bleeding wound best I could. Glancing feverishly around for anything to barricade the door with, I realized we were in another bunk room, this one with larger beds, a higher ceiling, and more room. Officer’s quarters more than likely. The corner of the room held a wooden alcove blocked from view by a soft maroon curtain. These beds too held the remains of their occupants, with their clothes and artificial lungs folded neatly by their skulls. Footlockers sat at the end of each bed and I approached, desperate for a gun, or knife, or wooden stake.

Rifling through the belongings of the trunk labeled R. Schmidt bore no fruit, and I moved onto the next bed down the line. J. Hohe’s Locker held only old clothing and indecipherable letters. I cursed and began to stand too quickly, banging my head on the bed above. Its chains clanked and bones clattered onto the floor around me. I rubbed the sore spot, then ran on the balls of my feet to where Pieter still lay. Whispering a prayer under my breath I pulled his auxiliary tank off and set it on the ground nearby still attached, then rolled his body onto his back, and placed my ear to his chest listening intently. The soft rhythmic thumping of his chest was nearly drowned out by the ravings of the monster, but they were there all the same. My heart lifted a little. If I could manage to get him awake, Pieter could help me into my atmospheric suit and I could return to the surface to get him help. My hope disappeared as I checked him for any other injuries. The twisted ankle had become a break, his bone jutting out through his skin and far too much blood trickling out of it. There was no way for him to make it up the ladder we entered from. Not with only me to help. 

My medical training started and ended with rescue diver experience, and I tried to attend to his wounds the best I could. A record sprint to the medical bay and back left me with an ancient bottle of peroxide and a tourniquet. I twisted the device over his thigh until I couldn’t anymore and unstopped the bottle. I doubted the efficacy of eighty year old wound cleaner, but upon pouring the solution over his leg, Pieter was brought back to consciousness, quite literally kicking and screaming. Even if it hadn’t helped sanitize, at least I wasn’t alone in here anymore.

*“JEZUS GODVERDOMME CHRISTUS!”*

“Sorry Pieter, fuck’s sake, I was worried I’d lost you.”

“My head! God above”

“Gimme a sec, I’m gonna find you some bandages” Standing, I began my way back to the already open footlockers. I grabbed what looked to be a cotton jumper and began tearing it into strips and wrapping them around my own gashes -- shallower than I first thought, thank God. As I wrapped, bone crunched under my foot and I looked below. Tiny, brittle, fragments splintered beneath my sock, but something felt strange. Around my foot were a handful of human ribs, all of them cracked in the middle. It was too perfect to have happened when they had all fallen. Confused, I peered up into the bunk which they had fallen from, and grabbed another bone at random. The partial femur my hand had selected came away neatly from its other half. There was no marrow in the broken segment. Every single other bone was exactly the same, cracked neatly down the middle, absent of marrow, and meticulously seated into its other half. All of the skeletons were anatomically correct, with not so much as a fingerbone missing. Pieter groaned again.

“Ah Christ, sorry Pete” I jogged back over to Pieter and began wrapping his ankle. “Alright soldier, I need a way out of here” I pulled the makeshift bandage tight to his protest, and moved to the head wound I wouldn’t have noticed if not for his previous exclamation.

“Medical bay…saw a map of the place” It was good enough. I hoisted him onto my shoulder and slowly shuffled us back towards the nearest free bed. The monster had gone quiet now, which made me uneasy. Pieter didn't seem to mind the silence. I don’t think he would’ve cared about anything at that point. I tried to lay him gingerly onto the bed but my foot slipped and he tumbled onto it a little rougher than I would have liked. He moaned.

“On the…wall, by the records” The ship's schematic was tacked slightly askew onto the siding of the medical bay. Studying it, I saw that down the yet unexplored hallway in the bay was the front torpedo room. I checked my memory and figured that was around where the damage to the hull would be. 

“I’ll be right back Pieter” He grunted in acknowledgement. I slipped my way through the unexplored hallway until I reached the room depicted. Four large circles lay at the front of the room, and great black scorch marks stretched across the inner right wall of the prow. At the site of impact was a grey metal sheet welded carefully to its place. On the ground beneath the artful repair job was a long, rotting bough of timber. The realization struck me only then. Either one of those corpses was a traitor, or these men had sunk themselves. My head reeled. I understood so very little. Pulling open the hatches to the torpedoes, I raised my flashlight and peered inside. All but one of them were still filled, though I doubted any of them would fire if launched. Maybe the red lever attached to the empty tube would open the outer hatch, but I made no attempt to pull it. I made my way back to my friend to check his condition. His teeth were starting to chatter, and his cheeks were losing their color. Piling the old, thin, bleached blankets around him, I checked his pulse again, then made my way over to the wall. 

Now, I tore the blueprint from the wall and placed it on the table amidst the still open medical folders. Getting Pieter to translate for me, I figured the ship was now divided into “Our side” and “Its side” by the door between the officers’ quarters and the radio room. There would be no escape for either of us if I didn’t explore further into the ship. Pieter’s occasional insights illuminated the only way out for either of us. Through the currently sealed bulkhead was the radio room, followed by another storage room, and an electrical engine room. Pieter inhaled sharply and in a strained voice, said

“There will be diving suits in the rear storage room. They are old, and likely in poor condition, but you only need to make it back to the diving bell.”

We both knew going out as I was now, the pressure would crush me. Worse comes to worst, I would still prefer that to the alternatives waiting for me here, but I would take any chance I had to get off of this ship in one piece. I remembered something and found myself growing curious. There was still something left to check before leaving Pieter alone in the dark.

Ripping open the filing cabinet, I began removing and opening every folder I could. Petty officers, engineers, radio operators, even the captain. All marked with the same red curse. Then, nearly through the last drawer, I found it. That thing still had the same face. Thinner, but no older than the picture in front of me. Red ink on this page too, but not used for words. Like a child draws on a wall, the information had been scribbled and struck through in a manic, absurd way. A few words were left unblemished, of them I could only understand one.

“**WUNDERWAFFE”**

After what I’d been through, it didn't even make me blink. I did one last check on Pieter, and exited from the medical bay. Averting my eyes from the trash pile as I passed through the storage room, I tried not to consider its implications, but failed. Now, the squeeze through the industrial ever-coitus of pipes as I made my way towards the curtain in the officers’ quarters. If I was going to get anywhere near that thing, it would not be unarmed. The sound began again.

Distant, echoey thuds though softer than before, like flesh on metal. The thing had dropped its hammer when it noticed me, and when I again reached the officer’s quarters, I took the time to retrieve it, placing it in my belt. Pulling back the maroon curtain, I nearly cried in relief at the otherwise pitiful sight that awaited me. Similar to his crew, Captain Wohler’s bones were naked and snapped cleanly. His clothes were folded neatly at the top of his bed, but there was no rebreather. The captain’s cause of death was far more obvious. In his right hand was a small pistol that the reports would list as a Walther PPK. In the right temple of the captain's skull was a round hole that was mirrored on the left side where the bullet exited. The lead had lodged itself in the wooden wall, but was completely clean otherwise. I realized as I pulled the little pistol from the Captain’s hands that it too was untarnished. No rust, or viscera, and not so much as a streak of gunpowder on the ivory grips. I pulled back the slide, and sure enough, a round sat squarely in the chamber. The gun’s magazine was missing only a single round, but any extra ammunition could make the difference. 

I began to rummage through the writing desk to the captain’s left. An empty bottle of Peach liquor, stationary, an old dead flashlight. I sighed when my hand brushed the empty leather holster, and I found a single extra magazine beneath it. I set the pistol into its place and snapped the holster onto my tool belt, removing some of the less useful items from it and setting it on the desk to try and balance the weight. Sat on top of the desk were two things. A worn gun cleaning kit, and a document flecked with dried blood. I realized then. 

There was only one way an eighty year old war relic could have been kept in such great condition. My stomach turned at the thought of that thing rearranging the finger bones of his superior exactly as they were when he found him. Here was where the pinky bones went, the thumb wrapped like that. Reconstituting the suicide of his captain God knows how many times. All to keep things in proper order. To what end? Pushing aside the thoughts I picked up the document, knowing very well I wouldn’t be able to read a word of it. It was handwritten in an unsure, staccato script. Bold lettering stared from the top and an icon of a German eagle perched in the upper-left corner A thin yellow sheet fell from under my fingers, joined at its top to the document by glue. I hadn’t known the Nazis used carbon copying but the sheet was perfectly familiar to me all the same. I gently tore off the bottom sheet, folded it twice across its center, and tucked it underneath my water proof undersuit, not wanting the sheet to be ruined if I did somehow make it out. There was little else keeping me now. It was time. 

With no great show, I passed out of the curtain to the grisly scene, spun open the door to the unknown, and marched forward.  


The dark is far scarier when you know something lurks within. My spine tingled and my hands shook as I resealed the hatch behind me, The clanging was intermittent now, and inconsistent in its tone. The noise felt far enough for me to continue forward with my light on, but not comfortably so. I took very little notice of the radio room as I crept through it, paying far more attention to my feet. One stubbed toe or upset waste bin could very well kill me and leave Pieter to choke, or freeze, or die of whatever else. One foot in front of the other kept me occupied, and moving forward. When I  reached the door to the storage room it was pulled mostly closed and I peeked in. No faces stared back at me, and the door to the Electrical engine was shut completely. I hurried in and took stock.

Three aged diving suits hung on hooks on the left wall. I closed in and touched my fingertips to the bronze helmet of the one closest. Quickly now, I slipped out of my belt and into the reinforced oilskin jumpsuit. These too had been perfectly maintained. I suppose the ship’s sole crewman had a lot of time to read manuals and practice upkeep. My fingers fumbled as I fastened and buttoned myself, listening intently to the next room over for any changes in behavior. Now for the helmet. The tanks the suits originally had were hefty, and likely contained no oxygen anyway, and would be left here, as my auxiliary tank would be enough and could fit in the mass of the helmet and under the oilskin suit. More buttons, screws, pausing every time the noise stopped. At this point everything was at least on my body except the boots, which would clang loudly against the flooring if I walked with them on. I grabbed them up, retied my belt, and began back towards Pieter when a new sound began to ring through my helmet. 

Familiar electronic beeping filled my ears; the thirty minute alarm on my rebreather was telling me I didn’t have much longer. I switched off my flashlight and began to undo the bolts securing the helmet to the suit. Stumbling backwards through the darkness, I backed to the wall where the suit had hung and pressed myself against it, still feverishly tearing at the fasteners. The thing had stopped making noise, and to my horror, I heard the sound of a hatch wheel spinning. We had never been safe at all, of course that thing knew how to use the doors. A guttural scream as I slipped my hand through and stopped the alarm, the sound of the hatch being flung open and then, stillness. A thud…another, it was approaching my wall. More footsteps until I felt it. Fingers brushing against the outer layer of my suit. Heavy breathing from the pale man as I held my hand over my mouth to stifle the sound of my own panicked gasps. The fingers turned sharper, pressing into the suit. I had no doubt the monster could shred through it with its nails if it wished. I did not scream, nor did I sob, nor did I run. It was over and I was dead, except. 

*\*CLANG\**

A loud crash, joined by an accented voice

“Come and get some, you freak!” Pieter's strained voice was distant but recognizable. He began to sing in a bassy voice. *“Wat zullen we drinken – Zeven dagen lang…”* It was an old drinking song he’d taught me when we first met. Pieter had heard us, and was pulling its attention away. The pressure on my chest disappeared and was replaced by the loud slaps of the monster’s bare feet sprinting towards the cacophony. Rhythmic metal clanging as Pieter began banging two cans together and continued. *“Wat zullen we drinken? Wat een dorst!”*

I could not let him kill himself, not with the family he would leave behind. I ripped the gun from its holster and took my flashlight with the other hand, attaching it to my chest. The boots slid on easily and I clanged after the two of them, speeding up when I heard the bulkhead slam open. As I closed in, Pieter’s singing raised in pitch abruptly, and then cut off, as a loud thump shook the ship. My heart sank. When I entered the trash storage room, and found the two of them, the pale figure was huddled with its back to me, crouched on the ground, moving its head wildly. Pieter lay gasping, flat on the floor in front of it. 

“Get the fuck away from him!” I shouted with all the courage I could muster, gun pointed squarely at its head. It stopped moving, and dropped what it was holding. Pieter’s leg rolled from behind its frame, detached at the knee. Chunks of flesh were ripped from the calf,  and the ankle was now almost disconnected. I tracked it with the sights as it brought itself up on its legs as it turned to face me, teeth bared and coated in red. The gun fired once, almost startling me, the report echoing through my entire body. The round caught the monster in its cheek and made the thing scream. I lowered the pistol slightly, not trusting my aim as it charged for me. My fingers moved on their own, squeezing the trigger until the gun clicked. I might have closed my eyes, I don't really remember. It had been hit in the chest and fallen to its knees, some organ deep inside its skinny body was perforated, making a hissing sound. Our eyes met, his now a deeper blue than before, far less wild and frantically tracing over my own. The bullet holes dripped a clear, thick mucus, and he fell now completely, his cracked lips moving wordlessly. Weakly, he lifted his arm from the floor, reaching out towards me, his hand open rather than clawing. A death rattle escaped his bloodied mouth, and the monster’s head fell to the floor, his heart stopped. 

I flung myself down to Pieter’s side, and thanked God for the monster picking the already tourniquet wrapped leg to gnaw at. A pool of blood crept from Pieter’s stump, but far less than there would have been. The shock had knocked Pieter out, but I promised to return with help all the same. It was not yet a lie when I said it.  
Water was sloshing from behind me now. I cursed myself for not just leaving and turned to face my death but, the creature lay still where it was. I drew closer, pulling out the thick hammer. The pale man was melting. His skin liquefied, then collapsed into the new cavity. A bubbling, murky white liquid filled his innards until its skeleton and the basin of its ribs collapsed as well. The frothy seafoam that was my attacker only moments ago drained into the tightly slitted floor below us. The only thing I could do for Pieter now was getting help from Command. I prayed aloud as I crashed towards the torpedo room..  


When I reached the surface without Pieter, the storm had not passed. The journey back up had been far more violent, though I hardly noticed the shakes and shudders of the bell. My radio, foolishly left behind, likely wouldn’t have worked anyway, and the dive phone remained unanswered no matter how many times I tried to key into Command. My borrowed helmet was already off when the door to the bell was finally opened. Command, or as I knew him, Paul, leaned over the open hatch, hair plastered against his head from the rain and sea-spray. Only then did I start crying.

“Pieter’s still down there, get me another suit! We’ve got to go get him back!” Paul shouted something back to me, but his words were stolen by the wind and booming thunder. I grabbed onto the ladder, and started making my way out. Paul’s rough hands grabbed at the scruff of the suit, and he hoisted me out, both of us tumbling onto the deck of the ship. Men rushed about around us, hollering orders to each other, desperate to break through the din. The words tumbled again from my mouth.

“He’s hurt bad Paul! His leg was ripped off! He doesn’t have much time, please, you have to send me back dow-” Paul cut me off, shouting over the roar as the sea swelled around us.

“You’re not going back down there son. Not like this” Rising to my feet now.

“HE’LL DIE DOWN THERE IN THAT FUCKING SHIP IF YOU DON-”

I stopped myself. Bright lights surrounded our ship, and I realized I was in the middle of a small flotilla. A large navy cruiser bobbed in the water next to us, with three smaller PT boats escorting it. A second ship from the company's own fleet sat on the opposite side of our boat. On it, two other men were in the middle of putting on their diving suits. Paul shouted to me again.

“The others will handle it from here, right now the best thing you can do is give us information”

I paused for a moment, steadying my breathing, then raised my voice

“Make sure they have auxiliary tanks, there’s no water in the submarine.” Paul stared at me for a beat, then tapped his ear as though he had misheard me.



I told them the same story time and time again, down to the look in that thing's eyes as it died. They never laughed once, nor was I shouted at or accused. Those men moved me from dull room to dull room, and I talked at their suits and ties for God knows how long. There were no handcuffs, or chains, or orange jumpsuits, but I knew very well that I would not be able to leave their custody until they found it appropriate. They put us in these cramped rooms with a bed, and a lamp, and a little attached bathroom so as to keep us from interacting with each other. The worst part was not knowing if Pieter was dead or just asleep one door down the hall. They wouldn’t tell me anything about what I saw either. I expected dropped jaws, or gasps, or maybe smirks when I spoke about the thing down there, but got blank stares instead.

You have to understand. That’s why I did it. I hadn’t even remembered the carbon copy until I stripped down to bathe that first night. It fluttered out of the undersuit I had on and onto the floor. I started to call out to let them know about it when I realized they would already have all the info on it. I took a closer look instead. The suit had kept it protected from the sea spray and blood, but not from my sweat. Thankfully, I could still make out the uneasy script, moist as it was, as well as the faint gray cross from where I had folded the paper. I laid it out to dry under one of the bleached white towels they provided us, and it sat either there, or folded against my body until they finally let us go weeks later.

The worker’s comp form read “Short term psychosis caused by Carbon Monoxide poisoning” and the medical leave was indefinite, which I took full advantage of. Phony as the cause may have been, the sizable check gave me a war chest of sorts. I had enough money now for a few private investigators, a German translator, and plenty of sleeping pills. The PI couldn’t find so much as a trace of Pieter or his family. No phone bills, or social media, or obituaries. He couldn’t even prove that the address Pieter had given me for Christmas cards ever belonged to him. Of the two divers who had gone down after me, one was killed in a car accident shortly after, and the other refused to answer any of my messages. Paul, however, had heard from him.

Paul had quit, of course, and was living in Florida when we found him. He agreed to meet and I caught the next available flight. Neither of us were much interested in pleasantries or catching up, we knew each other far too well for that sort of thing. The coffee his wife poured us sat untouched for the duration of our conversation, slowly growing colder in their chipped white mugs. I went first, recounting my story for the last time, until now. Paul’s reactions were far more in tune with what I expected, and I didn’t notice myself trembling until he grabbed my shoulder, and asked me for a break with tears in his eyes.

Pieter was our friend, and Paul had known him longer than I did. Pieter had gone to his wedding, and they’d held each other's kids. Pieter was dead, and neither of us were buying it. The official story made no mention of any injuries found, or autopsies performed. According to the rescue dive report Pieter was found “Cold and unresponsive with no pulse, body was recovered, remains cremated and sent to surviving family” Paul of course couldn’t find Pieter’s family either, though I suspected he hadn’t tried as hard as me. He seemed to be ready to leave it all behind, and I found out why as he went on. 

By the time the rescue crew surfaced, Paul was already at port, being interrogated in a room near mine. Eric, the one who had disappeared, had called Paul about a month after we had been released. Paul said he sounded frantic, and Eric told him that the report was wrong. When they had gotten down there, Pieter was still breathing, but seemed to have dragged himself to the medical bay and fallen unconscious on one of the beds. His leg was still in the storage room, eaten like I had said. Paul said the phone line was disconnected mid sentence shortly after, and he wasn’t able to get much more of use out of him.

At this point, I find it prescient to reveal to you what I was keeping from Paul, as I did to him when I was told this. My carry-on for the flight to Orlando was light. An overnight bag with some cash, my wallet, a change of clothes, and a manilla folder carrying the translated copy of what I found on the Captain's desk. The college student I had hired to do it was smart, but we only corresponded online. I was able to convince her I was a German author trying to break through into the English market. If only. The document was not, as I had originally thought, a log from the captain’s journal. It was a radio message, decoded by hand, and read as follows:  


*For immediate action.*

*This is a message for Captain Wohler of U-897. This relay will entail your final orders, and last communication from German High Command. The war is lost, and the Reich will soon fall. You must honor your countrymen by completing this final task to its fullest. The encroaching Allies must not be allowed to gain control over this wonder-weapon of ours, and its destruction is impossible. The war correspondent newly assigned to your crew is to be preserved within your ship until such a time that a successor to our great Reich can retrieve him. All records of your submarine, its crew, and its current location have been destroyed, and only a select few ‘designated survivors’ of the Reich have been trusted with its knowledge.*

*Upon reaching the previously discussed coordinates, you are to detonate a scuttle charge, and sink your ship, so as to give an outside appearance of destruction during battle. The breach is then to be repaired, and any sea water is to be pumped out. Should the correspondent ever become frantic at any point during this operation and begin to undergo the transformation early, make no attempt to harm him. Any damage inflicted upon him will be repaired in whole after liquefaction and reformation, and his memory will remain intact. The hatch on your conning tower has already been sealed, so as to prevent any unwanted egress by the correspondent. He, and the rest of your crew are at no time to be made aware of any other possible exits*

*After completion of the above duties, you are relieved of your command, and no more is expected of you. Your’s, and your crew’s sacrifice will be honored for generations to come in the hearts of every German.*

*Hail Victory,*

*Generalfeldmarschall Kreutz*

*March 30th, 1945* 



Paul, finished reading now, leaned back into his chair, closed the folder, and put his hands over his eyes. I took the opportunity to ask him.

“What else did Eric say before the call was cut off. Did he see him?”

“He said nothing else save for how you were mistaken and the leg was broken in two places other than one, but knowing them, there’s no way they would have left Pieter down there if they had any choice.” I breathed through my nose and stared down at the floor, thinking. Something wasn’t sitting right.

“How did they know the leg was broken in two places if they were in such a rush to find Pieter?”

“He said it was pretty obvious. When they went to pick up his bones, they had been snapped in half. I figured that’s what you came upon when you found that thing over Pieter.”

My heart thudded against my chest. That wasn’t how I had left his leg, but I suppose I should have already expected as much. Thanking Paul for his time, I stood,  shook his hand, and left his house. There was a return flight to catch. I don't think Pieter is still down there, and I pray every night that thing still is. A part of me can't help but wonder, though. If it learned how to maintain that ship in perfect darkness, then maybe I taught it how to leave.

I do not dive anymore. I hope I’ll never have to again.
