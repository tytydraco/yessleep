This may be a long post but I need to get this out while I can and I need out of here. 
They aren’t here right now. I’m not sure when I’ll get this opportunity again. 
I went to an unfamiliar mall a few cities over by myself just to do some browsing and maybe a little shopping. Everything was normal for awhile. 
For some reason a guy walked up to me and he was really angry just shouting at me telling me I should be ashamed of what I did. I brushed it off thinking he was crazy or something. 
Kept walking and I felt like I was being sucked into quicksand. I could move but not very well but everyone else was moving fine. 

Everyone kept giving me looks of absolute disgust and pointing at me and making faces. Obviously they thought I had done something terrible but I had no idea what it was or what was happening.

I knew in my mind I needed to get out and I saw just down the hall was an exit sign. I made my way down the hall and everyone was just yelling at me and pointing and making awful faces to me like I was an outcast. 

I eventually made it to the exit sign that was located above a hallway. Standing on the line between that hallway and the rest of the mall I turned around and saw absolutely everyone was slowly following me and still yelling and pointing. They didn’t want anything to do with me.

I looked down this long hallway and the ceiling had several light fixtures in the ceiling and it came to an abrupt end with a very sharp turn. 
I was too scared to turn around because everyone was following me and angry so I knew my best bet was to just keep going. 

I stepped into the hall and I made it a few steps before the light fixtures started to flicker and just went out and came back on. Nothing different happened just weird.

After that becomes something I can never explain and I need help. 
It happened again and when the lights came back on there was a woman standing with her back to the corner in a nurse outfit. 

She had a wheelchair in front of her in her left hand and was holding a clipboard with some papers on it in her right hand but otherwise was just looking at her clipboard not showing me any mind.

I was so scared but I figured this was my only option to get out of here and I was only halfway down the hall around this time. 
I knew my best bet was to push myself as close to the wall as I could and just slowly make my way down and around the corner and hopefully she wouldn’t mess with me.

Lights kept flickering and going off but nothing happened and I breathed a sigh of relief because I actually made it to the corner and got around.

I turned the corner with this woman still there looking at her clipboard and I saw the end of the hall and the door that would be my exit. I took a couple more steps and before I knew it I felt something grab me and basically spin me around.

At this time I was standing face to face with this woman and she was holding my arm very tightly with one arm and scanning her clipboard of papers with another.
She kept looking at me and looking down and scanning. 

She flipped a couple pages and stopped and looked at me and smiled really big and said “welcome to your permanent residence”

Now I’m stuck in what seems like a hospital room and I’ve tried to leave but they always get me back.
I have no idea where I am or what this is and I want help. They are very adamant that I stay where I am. I want help and need out. Please help me. Please

Edit: don’t worry guys they are taking very good care of me and they assure me I’ll be out in no time (:
