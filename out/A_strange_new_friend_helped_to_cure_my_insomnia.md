I was in an especially grim rut before I met Hester. 

Years of restless nights were taking their toll, and life seemed to be getting bleaker and bleaker. I was wrestling with my own personal demons, but the relentless tide of carnage and anguish on the news certainly wasn’t helping.

I couldn’t remember the last time I opened my phone without getting smacked in the face by genocide, corruption, and tyranny. 

I awoke to the sound of my mobile ringing. 

I groggily sat up in my sleeping bag, rubbing the drowsy haze from my eyes. 

“Morning, my love,” Arthur’s voice crackled out of my phone as I answered, “Have you been out camping again?” 

“Couldn’t sleep,” I yawned, “Sorry.” 

“Don’t be daft,” I could hear the gentle smile in my husband's voice, “If popping down to the creek means that you actually get some rest, go there as much as you need. I just wanted to make sure you weren’t late for work.” 

“Thanks, babe. I’ll wander back over to the house.” 

“Sure thing. Love you.” 

“Love you too.”   
  
I hung up, then shimmied out of my sleeping bag. My back was sore, but in fairness, I had been sleeping on hard stone. 

Byre’s Creek was a secluded little spot, tucked away in a tangle of verdant woodland. There was a natural stone platform that rose up out of the trickling stream, which I had taken to sleeping on when I needed escape into the quiet of nature. 

The creek was special to me. I could hear a child’s laughter harmonising with the soft rhythm of flowing water. It was my mind playing tricks on me. I knew that the gleeful giggling of that little girl was just a memory bleeding into the present. 

I pretended that the laughing was real, that it was wrapping itself around me, like a warm hug. Inevitably, that tiny little slither of happiness didn’t last. 

With a groan and a sigh, I bundled my sleeping bag back into its sack and pulled myself up onto my feet. 

I began the short journey home, hopping off the platform and onto the muddy bank that ran beside the stream. The soft chirping of birds swayed through the trees above me as I pressed on through twisting woodland.   
  
It took roughly fifteen minutes of ducking beneath branches and scurrying over uneven ground before my house came into view.

Arthur and I had a respectable-sized home. It was built from warm orange brick, with a sloping roof and a front door that was painted deep green. Arthur was a sharp-minded accountant, and I was a moderately successful counsellor.   
  
Whilst he made more than I, we were both on decent wages, so we could afford a nice house. 

Double income, no kids. Well, no kids anymore. 

I slipped inside, chucking my sleeping bag into the hallway closet. I found Arthur drinking coffee in the kitchen. 

His eyes lit up with genuine warmth when he saw me. 

“Morning, gorgeous,” he beamed, “There’s a twig in your hair.” 

I pulled said twig out of the messy jumble of curls that sat atop my head. Dull grey was starting to peek out from amidst my fiery ginger tresses. I made a mental note to get them dyed ASAP. 

  
“Got any interesting clients today?” Arthur asked, taking a swig from his coffee. 

“You know I can’t give out details,” I laughed, “Rules are rules.”

“You’re such a spoilsport,” he teased, “I want the juicy gossip.” 

When we’d first met, several aeons ago, he’d had this shaggy-haired, Rob Zombie look going on. These days, he had a neatly-trimmed beard and a buzzcut. I didn’t mind that he was going to grey, he looked nice with a dash of silver, but I did miss the long hair. 

“These lips are sealed.” I gave him a quick peck on the cheek. 

“I was thinking I might pop up to see Joy after work,” his voice switched from boisterous to soft in an eye-blink, “Do you want to come with?” 

I fought like hell to keep the stab of pain that I felt from showing on my face. Joy was a spectre that loomed over everything. Every time I felt even somewhat like a normal person, she would pop back up again.   
  
We could never be normal people, ever again, and I hated that. I also hated myself for wanting to be normal. It felt like I was betraying her. 

“I’ve got a late session today,” I told Arthur, “It's fine, you go. You deserve some alone time with her. I don’t have exclusive rights to mourning.” 

He gently placed one hand on my shoulder. 

“You’ve never made me feel excluded,” he promised in a soft voice, “You’ve never pushed me away. Honestly, you’re a bloody champion. You’re so full of empathy and compassion. You don’t have to be perfect. You can let yourself get a bit messy, sometimes.” 

“I’m plenty messy,” I chuckled, “You’ve seen the state of my car.” 

“Yeah, fair enough, your car does look like a bomb went off in it.” 

“See? Plenty messy.” 

He downed the rest of his coffee, then kissed the back of my neck. 

I felt a rush of warmth rumbling through my body. 

Even after all these years, my man still knew how to brighten up my day. 

“I’ll catch you later, messy lady,” he shot me a smile, “Don’t work too hard.” 

“I never do!” I called after him as he strode out of the kitchen.

I had several regulars booked in that day, alongside one new client. My new approach had booked in for the very last slot that I offered, which was far from unusual, given that most folks worked a nine-to-five

I started off with a client who was struggling with the pressures of a recent promotion, moved on to a young trans man who was building up the courage to come out to his family, then took an hour break for lunch after I’d seen a single mother who had finally gotten a formal diagnosis of ADHD, and the medication that came with it. 

After lunch, I saw a woman in her late twenties whom I was helping to manage her EUPD, moved on to a man in his thirties who was battling with depression, and then had a session with a gentleman who had quit his soul-crushing office job to pursue his passion for acting.

By the time my last session rolled around, I needed an outrageously large coffee to put some pep back in my step. 

It was a dark and cold evening.   
  
When I opened the door, an icy wind howled into the house, so ferociously freezing that it made my skin burn. 

“May I take a name?” I asked the visitor. 

The woman standing in the doorway had silky blonde hair, fair to the point of looking almost white. She had a soft, round face adorned by a pair of emerald green eyes that shimmered with flecks of bright cerulean. 

Her figure was pear-shaped, with most of her weight resting in her hips and legs. Her distressed jeans strained against her chunky thighs, and she wore a velvety top the colour of gleaming amethysts.   
  
The woman’s fingers were festooned in a glittering display of ornate golden rings, each one adorned with a different colour gemstone. The light above my doorway made the jewels sparkle in a vibrant rainbow whenever she moved a hand. 

“Hester Hillcrest. May I enter?”   
  
Her voice was decadent and inviting. She spoke in a slow, leisurely manner, which gave the impression that she had all the time in the world.   
  
Standing in Hester’s presence made me feel self-conscious. She was young and revoltingly pretty, with a refined cadence which suggested she either came from old money or had at least attended a prestigious private school. 

I didn't like the way she looked at me. When those emerald eyes drank me in, it was as if I were once again a child being harassed by the mean girls on the playground. 

Hester had the aura of both a snooty socialite and a bloodthirsty warlord. She looked at me like a tactician studying enemy formations, searching for weak spots that they could exploit. 

“Of course,” I moved out of the doorway, “Please, come in. My office is this way.” 

I guided her through the house and into the office.   
  
When it came to my workspace, I had done what I could to balance professionalism with comfort. 

My patients had the option of sitting in a chair or reclining on an especially soft settee. I had opted for a light that gave off a warm, gentle glow, and there were a few paintings depicting various relaxing landscapes dotted around the walls of the office. 

“Oooo, very swish!” Hester cooed, lying down on the settee, with both hands slipped together, “You’ve got the iconic therapist sofa. I love it.” 

“I couldn’t resist it,” I gave her a thin smile, taking a seat behind my desk, “Would you kindly walk me through what has brought you here today?” 

Hester absentmindedly fidgeted with the sunstone ring, which sat on her index finger as she spoke to me. 

“My boss jumped from his office window, right onto his silver Lamborghini,” she explained, speaking in a relaxed voice that was utterly devoid of gravity, “Blood everywhere. Very messy. There is a rumour in the office that somebody pushed him.” 

“I’m very sorry to hear that,” I said in the gentle tone that I used for clients, “I imagine that was a very distressing experience for you.” 

Hester exploded into a fart of abrasive laughter that caught me off guard. 

“He was an arrogant pig. If he hadn’t jumped, I probably would have pushed him myself. The man was a colossal wanker.” 

I raised one eyebrow. 

“If you weren’t impacted by your boss's death, why has it made you pursue counselling?”

“I’ve been made aware that my response to him offing himself was…unusual,” she explained, “I found that curious. I thought a shrink could help me explore *why* I responded the way that I did.”

“There's no right or wrong way to handle a tragedy. You don’t have control over your innate reaction,” I explained to her, “Your ambivalence could be a “freeze” response. During times of great stress and anxiety, some people “fight”, some people “flee”, and some people “freeze”. Sometimes our body tries to keep us safe by making us completely numb to something that it perceives as dangerous.” 

Hester clicked her tongue in a somewhat grating manner. 

“What if I don’t care because the prick deserved it?” she asked, “What if the fact that he was an awful, irredeemable prat stops me from feeling any sympathy for the bugger?”

I couldn’t shake the feeling that Hester was toying with me. I had the creeping sense that she was trying to lure me into some sort of trap. 

“That depends on your morals and ethics,” I made an effort not to let my unease show, “Does your lackadaisical response to your boss’ death align with your principles?" 

“I have flexible principles,” Hester replied, “The more I see of life, the more I realise how little I know. Mankind is sinking deeper and deeper into the mire of madness. I find it hard to have consistent principles when I’m constantly being disappointed by the depravity of man.”

“I know that things can feel bleak, but there is goodness in the world as well.” 

“Last night a madman stormed into a gay club in LA and gunned down twenty people,” Hester told me, “People who committed the heinous crime of existing. The gunman was so repulsed by said existence that he decided to rectify it with an assault rifle. The youngest victim was twenty-one. Is it wrong of me to wish death upon the perpetrator?"

“Sadly, I’m not a moral arbiter,” I replied, “But I do understand your anger.” 

Hester took a ruby-encrusted ring off of one finger and began to roll it around in her palm. 

“Somebody may take umbrage with the shooter,” Hester leant back on my settee as she spoke, “Somebody may decide that he is a stain which needs to be scrubbed out. Somebody like Faith Laval.” 

“Faith Laval?” 

“A single mother whose daughter was abducted and assaulted by her maths tutor,” Hester explained, “Faith beat him to death with a cricket bat. She’s something of an idol of mine. Who could blame a mother for protecting her daughter? Who would argue that the life of Faith’s daughter was worth the same as the man who abused her?” 

My throat tightened. My heart pounded in my chest. My breathing became raspy. 

“Are you alright?” Hester asked me.

“I’m fine,” I said in an unconvincing, shaky manner, “I probably just ate something dodgy earlier.”

Hester spent the rest of our session ducking and weaving around my questions, often shooting back questions of her own. My gut instinct told me that she had an ulterior motive in coming to me for counselling, yet I had no inkling as to what it might be. 

As I lay in bed next to Arthur that night, Hester Hillcrest whirled round and round in my thoughts. 

Her exterior was that of a stuck-up, pampered bully, yet my gut instinct told me something was lurking beneath her pretty exterior. Why had she really sought counselling? What did she want from me? 

It was only when I noticed Arthur staring at me expectantly that I realised I had accidentally blanked him.   
  
“Sorry, I was miles away,” I mumbled, “What was the question?” 

“I’m getting dinner with mum and dad on Friday,” he laughed, “I was asking if you wanted to join. No worries if not, I know mum can be a handful.” 

“I’d love to,” I attempted a genuine smile, “I feel like I haven’t seen your folks in donkey's years.” 

“I can come up with an excuse if you don’t want to,” Arthur smiled, “Sincerely, I won’t be pissy if you’ve not got the energy right now.” 

“Don’t worry, I can play nice for one evening,” my lips curled into a smirk, “I’ll be on my best behaviour.” 

“You’re a goddess,” he placed one hand softly on top of mine, “I’ll do what I can to keep the beast’s claws sheathed.” 

“How was your trip to see Joy?” 

Arthur was smiling, but his eyes were heavy with sadness. 

“Yeah, it was nice,” he shrugged his shoulders, “Well, as “*nice*” as something like that can be. I got rid of the manky old flowers and left some fresh ones. Crazy to think she’d have been fifteen this year. We’d be knee-deep in teenage angst. She was a right little madam as a kid, I bet she’d be a real terror as a teen.” 

He had a habit of deflecting with humour whenever we talked about something upsetting. I didn’t hold it against him; Arthur’s parents were hardly the most nurturing people in the world. His mum was especially venomous. Having met my husband’s folks, I was amazed that he turned out as well-adjusted as he did. 

“I reckon we’d have managed,” I told him, “You were such a wonderful dad. You could have handled some messy hormones.” 

Arthur’s lips quivered. He stared up at the ceiling, like he always did when he couldn’t make eye contact, and I could see tears welling in his eyes. 

I knew what he was thinking. “*I miss her so fucking much*”. The same thought that ran through my head, perpetually cycling around and around and around. The aching chasm that she had left behind would never stop burning like a fresh wound. It didn’t matter how much time passed. 

Our daughter’s absence was an injury that would never heal. 

“I had a really odd client today.” I told him, trying to steer the conversation into less painful waters. 

“I thought you weren’t allowed to talk about them?” he teased me. 

“As long as I don’t give away any super-specific details, I reckon we’re okay.” 

“What was odd about them?” 

“On one hand, she was really chic and stylish - “ 

“Is that weird? You have a lot of clients with more money than sense.” 

“Let me finish!” I laughed, playfully swatting Arthur in the arm with a pillow, “She wasn’t the usual spoilt princess-type. She felt…ominous. There was something sinister about her. She was unnervingly calm, in a predatory way. Like a tiger creeping towards an antelope.” 

“Are you the antelope in this scenario?” Arthur asked me, “You do have very striking legs.” 

“Control yourself, man,” I chuckled, “But yeah, I guess I am. I can’t shake the feeling that she’s got some kind of ulterior motive.” 

“If the predator princess is making you uncomfortable, then chuck her.” 

“*Predator Princess* is a pretty rad name for a band.” I mused. 

“I wish nonces hadn’t ruined the word *predator*,” my husband thought aloud, “I want to be a predator in the *cool ninja assassin* way, not in the *child molester* way.” 

“It's never too late to drop accountancy and become a ninja.” 

“Babe, don’t put ideas like that in my head,” he grinned, “Next thing you know, I’ll be running around on our roof in a balaclava." 

“So long as you don’t fall *through* the roof, I don’t object.”

It wasn’t long before we went to sleep. As always, my sleep was polluted by nightmares. I tossed and turned, thrashing about like a rabid animal, with sweat soaking my skin. 

My nightmares always led me to the same place. I awoke feeling even more tired than I had when I lay down my head. I couldn’t remember the last time I got a decent night's sleep. I was eternally exhausted, eternally feeling as though my tank was devoid of only the smallest dregs of fuel.   
  
Another week of work rolled around. My job filled me with a strange blend of warm satisfaction and cold ennui.   
  
Most of my clients were decent people struggling through tough times, and being able to help them was what got me out of bed in the morning. Sadly, I also had my fair share of overprivileged pisspots that wanted me to arm them with therapy jargon, so that they could justify behaving like mega-twats. 

I could be relatively selective with the clients that I took on, but at the end of the day, Arthur and I had to keep the lights on.  
  
By the time my second session with Hester Hillcrest rolled around, I’d just finished smiling and nodding my way through an hour of a landlord lamenting over how his greedy and ungrateful tenants were impacting his mental health by asking him to fix their boiler.

At the start of the session, Hester seemed agitated with a silver ring I was wearing. It was a present from Arthur, which I’d put on that morning without a second thought. 

“Silver makes me anxious,” she hissed, glaring at the ring as if it caused her immense offence, “Take it off.” 

“Is there a particular reason you don’t like silver?” I asked her. 

“Take it off, or I’m leaving.” she snapped firmly. 

I did as Hester wished, slipping the ring into the top drawer of my rosewood desk. 

She settled after that, her posture unhunching. In an instant, she was the relaxed, nonchalant young woman I had seen previously. 

“In our last session, we spoke about morality,” I addressed her in a calm yet professional manner, “Specifically the moral worth of one individual against another. Shall we pick up there?” 

“There are people who don’t just contribute nothing, they actively make the world a worse place,” Hester said as coolly as if we were discussing what she had for dinner,”Our society is ordered in a way which enables these people.” 

“Wouldn’t you say that all life has worth? That life is sacred, and should be cherished?”   
  
“Unquestionably,” she coiled a strand of fair blonde hair around one finger as she spoke, “But these people don’t cherish life. They squander it. They spoil it for everyone else.” 

“So, you are pro-capital punishment? Would you trust the state with the power over life and death?” 

Hester let out a musical laugh. Her laughter was smooth and rich, like silk. She was a woman who oozed decadence in her every movement. 

“I don’t trust the state with anything,” she shrugged her shoulders, “Too many people rely far too heavily on others to get their hands dirty for them. The people in power are ultimately still people. They are no more infallible than you or I.” 

“When you say “*get their hands dirty*”, do you mean *murder*?”

There was a flash of something sinister in her emerald green eyes. 

“Soldiers murder for a living. They are hailed as heroes. Why is it heroic to kill for your country, yet reprehensible to kill for yourself? We exist in a world of paradoxes. Everyone is so terrified of rocking the boat that they move through life shackled by naive obedience.”

“A lot of us find comfort in structure and routine,” I replied, “We want freedom to an extent, but we also crave instruction. Not everyone can be a leader. Not everybody wants to be a leader.”

“The world is madness and mayhem,” a slight tremble of excitement thrummed through Hester’s voice, “We seek order because we think that the alternative is chaos. The powers that be want us to believe that their rules protect us from unchecked, primal evil.” 

“But you disagree?” 

Hester fixed me with her emerald eyes. I felt as if they were burrowing down into the deepest depths of my soul. I was unable to stop myself from flinching uncomfortably beneath her stare. 

“You must watch the news,” a sharp grin curved at the corner of her lips, “You must see the unrelenting tide of misery, horror, and suffering. Take a look at the world we live in. Do you genuinely believe that - THIS - is the best we can hope for?”

“No,” I admitted, “But I don’t think that vigilante justice is the solution.” 

“I trust my own judgement far more than that of any two-faced politician,” Hester shot back, “If someone were to hurt me, or to hurt someone I love, I fundamentally believe that I am justified in taking my vengeance.” 

A familiar scene went charging through my mind like a rampaging bull. The stench of burning flesh. My ears ringing with the sound of my own shrieking. My body filling with an icy dread so overwhelming that I felt cold even as fire raged around me. 

“An eye for an eye makes the world blind.” I was fighting to keep my voice from shaking. 

“An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.” she replied. 

“You seem to like talking about violence,” I observed aloud, “What is it about violence that appeals to you?”

“Violence is an incredibly effective means of resolving persistent problems,” Hester explained, “Too often we pander to those who are cruel and stubborn. When we compromise, we hand them another victory.” 

“If we stoop to their level, we become as consumed by hate and misery as they are,” I countered, “I’ve walked through life with fury in my heart. All it did was poison everything else. Letting go of hate isn’t a kindness to them, it is a kindness to yourself.” 

I surprised myself with the words that were passing my lips. I had never been this open with a client. I rarely referenced my own experiences in sessions, especially ones that were so personal. 

It was as if some unseen force was coaxing raw honesty out of me. Like an invisible hand had reached past my defences, and was pulling me out of safety and into dangerous waters. 

“I’m not talking about people who are rude to service staff, or who listen to music without headphones on public transport,” Hester scoffed, “I’m talking about real, irredeemable monsters. The kind they write legends about. The kind that heroes of old went on quests to slay.” 

“In my experience, people aren’t good or evil,” I told her, “They are layered. The world isn’t black and white.” 

Speaking openly filled me with a bizarre weightlessness, as though a tremendous pressure were being lifted. I should have resisted, yet the invisible hand seemed to be stronger than my barriers were durable. 

“I tend to agree,” Hester replied, “Most of the world is grey. There is blackness out there, though. Some people are utterly devoid of light. Some people simply are evil.” 

“They say Hitler loved dogs.” 

“So, tyrants get a free pass if they’re nice to animals?” 

“That isn’t what I meant!” 

I didn’t mean to raise my voice. It was unprofessional of me. I wasn’t used to feeling so exposed. 

Hester crossed her hands in her lap, her eyes twinkling with delight as she watched me getting flustered. 

“A man gets behind the wheel of his car, knowing that he is under the influence of coke and booze,” the pace of her words became slow and precise, like she was choosing them methodically, “Whilst zooming around like a lunatic, he kills a child. This is a rich man, a man with lawyers who can sway almost any jury. He walks away with a slap on the wrist.” 

I could feel my heart beating faster and faster in my chest. I tried to speak, but the words were trapped in my throat. 

“He doesn’t change his ways. He doesn’t care about who he hurts. He thinks that all of the money his father handed down to him makes him invincible. He’s still out there. He’s still hurting people. His powerful friends stop him from ever facing justice.” 

My forehead was caked in a thick layer of sweat. 

“He is a rancid parasite who takes, and takes, and - TAKES -. There isn’t so much as a drop of goodness in his wicked, shrivelled little heart. Is his life sacred? Even as he destroys the lives of others without a second thought?” 

“How do you know about Knox?” I managed to stammer out, “Who are you *really*?”

“Someone who wants Knox dead,” Hester told me, “For you, and for every other life he has ruined.” 

My hands were shaking like leaves caught in a storm. I felt dizzy, as if I were drunk and the world was spinning around me. 

“You need to leave. I want you to go. Please, just go.” 

Hester Hillcrest rose to her feet, never once looking away from me. 

“We can’t bring Joy back, but we can avenge her.” 

In an instant, the fear that had been pumping through me like blood was transformed into searing, molten rage. 

“GET OUT!” I shrieked at her, all pretence of rationality melting away, “GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!” 

There wasn’t even the faintest whisper of fright on Hester’s face as she turned and walked out of my office. 

I heard her closing the front door as she left, and then I collapsed into my chair. I was struggling to breathe, whilst tears streamed wildly down my cheeks. 

No matter what I accomplished, no matter how much progress I made, Joy was the phantom that would forever haunt my life. There was nothing that could fill the vast, boundless crater that she left in my heart.   
  
I remembered how irritating I’d found it when I’d ask Joy to do something and she’d shoot straight back with “Why?” in her shrill little voice. 

She was also chirping “Why? Why? Why?” as if she were a parrot. 

I would have cut off a limb if it meant that I could hear my baby girl ask me “Why?” one last time. 

Knox had ripped my life apart. He had stolen my happiness away. He had killed my little princess. 

Hester was right. Knox was a monster. A monster who didn’t deserve to live. 

I was in a horrifically foul mood when Arthur came home. I couldn’t tear my thoughts away from Hester. I felt as if a balloon full of fury was blowing up in my chest, threatening to burst under the slightest pressure. 

Arthur talking over an episode of *Sweetpea* proved to be the straw that broke the camel’s back. 

I slammed the pause button with disproportionate force, leaving Ella Purnell’s face frozen on the screen.

“For fuck’s sake, I can’t hear what they’re saying!” I snarled at him, “I never talk through your shows! Why is it that the second it's something I want to watch, you don’t stop blabbering?!” 

Arthur stared at me like a child who had just been scolded by their mother. The palpable upset on his features made me feel like a massive bitch. 

“S-sorry,” my husband spluttered, “I just wanted to know how similar to the books the show is. I know you r-really enjoyed the books.” 

I let out a heavy sigh, my body still shaking with poorly repressed anger. 

“I need five minutes to myself,” I told him, “I’m going to the creek.” 

“Should I wait up for you?” he asked in a sad, shrunken voice. 

“I don’t know, Arthur. I need space to think.” 

I left my husband sitting meekly in the living room. I grabbed my sleeping bag, then set off into the night. 

As I drew closer to the creek, I heard the sound of frantic voices echoing through the darkness. 

That was weird. I’d never bumped into anyone else there before. 

I followed the sound of voices down into Byre’s Creek. I fumbled my way over muddy ground and between twisting branches, whilst inky black water flowed beside me, twinkling beneath the silvery light of a full moon. 

Hester was standing upon the stone platform where Joy and she used to play. There was a man double over on his knees in front of her. 

It was Knox. 

He was an ugly, rat-faced man with a receding hairline and flabby jowls that were disproportionate to the rest of his body. He had small, piggish eyes and pouty lips that reminded me of young influencers who’d gotten far too much Botox. 

Knox’s skin was coated in angry red patches. His face was peppered with nauseating ulcers that looked borderline necrotic, painted in a blend of rancid yellow and inflamed pink. 

It was immediately obvious that killing my daughter had done nothing to quench his appetite for whiskey and cocaine. 

“Get this psycho away from me!” Knox yelped pleadingly, as soon as he saw me emerging from the darkness, “She’s fucking loony!”

Boiling fury churned in my stomach at the sight of him.

“My audience arrives!” Hester clapped her hands like a child who was giddy with excitement, “The performance can finally begin.”

She grabbed Knox’s patchy hair, yanking his head backwards. He let out a pitiful little yelp. 

“Hester, what in Christ’s name are you doing?!”   
  
My glare shifted away from Knox, fixing on her. 

The stylish, put-together woman I knew was gone. Her cheeks were sunken to the point of gauntness, which was only accentuated by the deathly grey pallor of her skin. 

The teeth that sat in her gums were horrifyingly sharp, as if each one were a knife-like canine. Where Hester’s eyes had been a dazzling emerald, they now burned with a rich crimson hue, bespeckled with pinpricks of dark carmine. 

“Creating ecstasy from tragedy!” she declared, her red eyes bursting with schadenfreude, “You’ve been hurting for far too long, dear. Together, we are going to indulge in the bliss of righteous vengeance.” 

“Don’t just stand there, you old bag!” Knox snapped, “Help me!” 

My hands clenched into fists.

“You don’t recognise me, do you?” I spat, “You killed my daughter.” 

Knox’s stupid, overly plump lips quivered.

“I’ve never killed anyone!” he insisted, “You’re as crazy as this nutcase!” 

Hester’s mouth was graced with a smirk so sinister that it would have made demons in hell blush.

“Are you ready to take the shot?” she asked me, “You’ve been an empty gun for far too long. Let me put a bullet in your chamber.” 

“You bitches are - DEAD - !” Knox was screaming like a petulant child, an enormous vein bulging on his forehead, “I’m gonna sue you into oblivion!” 

Hester smacked him. 

Her nails were long and deathly sharp, to the point that they looked like claws. When her hand connected, she drew needle-thin threads of deep red blood across his face. 

“Gah! Fuck!” he winged. 

“You’ll never get a better chance than this,” she told me, “Time to rid the world of this putrid leech.” 

“Whoa! Whoa!” Knox spluttered, fresh carmine dribbling down his face, “Let's all relax! Let's not do anything we’re gonna regret!” 

He was sickeningly pathetic. Without his money to protect him, Knox was reduced to a snivelling, spineless little man with a receding chin and hair like frayed wire. 

Even after everything he had taken from me, I felt more disgust than rage when I looked at Knox. 

“I’m not killing him, Hester,” I told her in a firm voice, “He’s not worth going to jail for.” 

“Look, I’m sorry I called you *bitches*,” Knox mewled like a frightened kitten, “If you let me go, I’ll forget this ever happened. I won’t go to the police, I promise. You’ll never hear from me again.”

“Let him go, Hester.” I instructed her. 

“How old would Joy be this year?” Hester snarled, “Still younger than Knox. What an extraordinary life of reckless depravity this reprobate has lived. Do you - *REALLY* \- think he’ll change his ways?” 

“I will!” Knox babbled, “I will! I will!” 

“Do you think I don’t want this child-murdering scumbag dead?! Of course I do!” I screamed, “But I - *WILL NOT* \- become a killer! I already have to carry Joy’s loss with me, everywhere I go. I’m not adding the burden of murder.”

Hester reached one hand into her pocket. She pulled out a squat, blocky phone that looked several decades out of date. 

She pressed one finger against the middle button. A garbled voice crackled out of the phone. 

“I painted that little shit’s brain across the road. She looked like a stomped tomato! The brat should have looked before crossing. Ha! So what, my car got trashed? Best money I ever spent! I wish I had one of those dash cam things. I’d get rock hard watching her splatting across my bonnet!” 

I recognised the voice in a heartbeat. Knox’s voice. 

Rage burned so furiously inside me that my whole body was shaking. It felt as if there was fire blazing beneath my skin. My blood boiled like a howling kettle. 

“That was just stupid banter!” Knox babbled, staring at me with bulging eyes, “I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I was coked out of my mind! I didn’t know what I was saying! Christ, I’m so sorry!” 

I’d spent my whole life trying to be the bigger person. Trying to be better. Trying to turn the other cheek.   
  
I was constantly tempering my anger, constantly snuffing out those rogue sparks of fury.  
  
I had let so many people walk over me, just so that they could keep their shoes clean.   
  
I was done being the world’s doormat.   
  
I locked eyes with Hester. 

“Do it.” 

Knox’s screams were smothered as she plunged her teeth into his neck. His horrified shrieking became a wet gurgle as she ripped free a mouthful of soaking flesh. Blood spurted out of the sodden crater where his throat had been. 

Hester spat out the wad of viscera, pressing her mouth up against the wound. She drank deep, like an alcoholic guzzling wine.

By the time Knox’s corpse thudded to the ground, Hester was drenched in the dead man’s blood. 

I felt numb. Like I was frozen in place. Like conscious thought had fled my mind, and only howling white noise remained. 

Hester licked her lips, letting out a laugh that was equal parts sensual and sadistic. 

I would have thought I’d have been repulsed, yet Hester Hillcrest looked so at home covered in blood that it seemed as if it were the most natural thing in the world. 

“I really thought I was gonna go hungry for a second there,” she chuckled, “But you didn’t disappoint. Now there’s one less monster in the world.” 

She gave Knox’s body a sharp kick. 

“You should probably get back to your darling husband,” she told me, “We don’t want you getting locked up on my account.” 

Hester turned away from me, ready to stroll off into the darkness of the night. 

“What if I don’t?” I called after her. 

She stopped in her tracks, then spun back to face me. 

“What do you mean?”

“I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone like you,” I admitted, “The way you walk through life, the world that you live in. You’re all chaos and danger, but you’re also so damn…alive. If I didn’t go home, if I followed you, would you…would you take me with you?” 

Hester’s expression softened. Her warm smile was somewhat undermined by the fact that she looked like Carie at prom. 

“It isn’t all adventure and excitement,” she told me, “I’ve had to sacrifice a lot. The mundane stuff. The stuff that seems boring, yet you grow to miss it. There is beauty in the ordinary. Losing Joy tore your world apart. I’ve never had a Joy. I’ve never settled in one place long enough to put down roots.” 

Her voice took on an honest, plain-speaking tone that felt anathema to the whirlwind of dark delight that I had come to know. 

“Once you step across the threshold, there's no turning back. I can open the door for you, but I don’t want you walking through it without knowing what you’re walking away from.” 

There was a part of me that wanted to follow her. A big part. The child-like part of me that still believed in dreams and magic. The part of me that wanted desperately to throw caution to the wind. To escape into fantasy. 

“I wasn’t the only one whose world got torn apart when Joy was killed,” I murmured, “Arthur lost everything too. I couldn’t leave him to suffer alone. That isn’t fair.” 

Hester Hillcrest shot me one last smile. 

“God, you’re nauseatingly selfless,” she laughed, “You’ve got a good heart. Don’t ever let the world take that away from you.” 

“Take care of yourself, Hester,” I smiled back at her, “And…thank you. Thank you for everything.” 

She winked at me. 

“Thank you for a truly delicious meal.” 

Hester vanished into the night, a shadow disappearing into the dark embrace of the void. 

I think about her often. There are days when I wish I’d followed her. Wherever she is, I hope that she finds her little slice of happiness. 

Hester Hillcrest taught me that I didn’t need to be a doormat. She taught me that sometimes I need to stare right into the eyes of my demons, then punch them in the fucking jaw.   


I’ll never stop treasuring the gift that she gave me. I’ll never not be grateful. For the first time in what feels like eternity, I sleep peacefully when I lay my head down at night.
