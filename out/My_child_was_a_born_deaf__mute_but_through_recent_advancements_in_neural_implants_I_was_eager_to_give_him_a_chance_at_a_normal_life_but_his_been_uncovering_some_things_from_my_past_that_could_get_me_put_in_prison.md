Our home was a peaceful place where I did my best to take care of Jonathan. He needed help with getting dressed every morning, and I helped him with the buttons and zippers that he struggled with. I was proud of how hard he tried. We did homeschooling together, and I made sure he learned things that suited him. He couldn't hear or speak, but he was curious and smart. We didn't pay much attention to the outside world, we had our own little bubble.  
But there was something missing in our home—his mother, who had died not long ago. He missed her so much, and sometimes he would have fits about her. I could see the pain in his eyes, even though he couldn't say anything. I felt the same pain, and I hugged him tight. I was his father, and I had to be strong for him. I hoped I could make him happy, even without her.  
  
For some of his homeschooling lessons I would take Jonathan to the museum, but he got very upset and sad when we passed by a group of kids doing a tour for their class, he tried to walk up to them and use sign language, but they couldn’t understand him. So, he solemnly walked back to me, and asked to leave. A woman came up to us and said her name was Sarah. She said she was a neurologist, and told us about a new experiment that could make him hear and speak with special devices in his brain. I was not sure what to think.   
I loved Jonathan the way he was, but I also wanted him to be happy and have more opportunities. Sarah said it was a big decision and we had to think carefully about it. She also said there were some risks and side effects. I did not know what to do. I felt scared and excited at the same time. I wondered what would happen if we agreed to the experiment.  
  
I wanted to help Jonathan overcome his deafness and muteness by using neural implants. I wanted him to hear sounds and speak words, to communicate and connect with the world in new ways. I wanted him to have a better life without the restrictions of his condition. I was not sure if the neural implants would work or cause any harm, but I was willing to take the risk. Sarah offered to invite the both of us to her lab, and I took the offer without a moment of hesitation.  
  
Sarah told me the dangers of the neural implant surgery. It was supposed to help Jonathan hear and talk again, but it could also change his senses, his perception of things, and his thinking. Some people who had the surgery saw, heard, felt, and thought things that were supposedly there. They had trouble adjusting to the new reality and some ended up in mental hospitals. I felt scared when I heard that. I wanted Jonathan to have a better life, but I didn't want him to lose himself or go crazy.  
  
We made the choice and started the neural implant procedure for Jonathan, hoping it would help him communicate with the world. The operation was stressful, and when Jonathan woke up from the anaesthesia, everyone was silent. The first thing said he wanted to talk to his mother, I was excited to hear him speak, but heartbroken I had to explain that it wouldn’t be possible for him to speak to his mother.   
Jonathan learned to use his new abilities in the short span of a few days. Sarah told us he was a successful case, but we were not completely calm. We found out that Jonathan could copy the voices of other people, particularly people he had never seen, nor heard in his life and that were usually dead. It was more than just getting his speech back, it was something strange. Sarah seemed uninterested in handling the problem, but she reassured me he was alright.  
Jonathan started to attend a normal school, and immediately fitted in with his classmates liked his voice mimicking skills. But things changed when he did something wrong. He found out one of his other classmates had lost their mother too, and offered to contact her, and so he copied her voice in front of everyone. The classmate started crying.  
We faced more problems – Jonathan wanted to make friends, but. His copied voices sounded in the school, showing how different he was and how hard it was for us to choose this way. We wanted him to have a normal life, but it was full of challenges and pain.  
  
His abilities, but he was still adjusting to his mimicry skills, and it caused a lot of trouble for him. I tried to convince him against it, until he suddenly used his mother's voice.   
“Don’t act so surprised, honey.”, He uttered, with the same exact words, she used the night I found her with another man.  
 She had cheated on me years ago and left us both. I felt a surge of pain and anger as I heard her voice again, as if she was in the room with us.   
The argument turned against me. Jonathan blamed me for everything that went wrong in our lives. He said I was bitter and cold, that I never moved on from her. He said I didn't love him enough, that I resented him for being like her.   
I tried to explain, I have done everything I could to help him, but he shouted back again. I asked him where he heard that conversation between myself, and his mother, and he explained that she was talking through him.  
  
I immediately went off to see Sarah to help with the situation she had created, but she deflected my concerns, before she finally blurted out it was my responsibility to solve my problems, especially since the ‘others’ know everything. I lost control, and threw her pipettes’, books, and instruments to the floor and demanded to know what exactly they knew about me, and how exactly a neurologist finds herself in a museum during weekdays, was I a target?  
Sarah explained that she knew nothing about my personal life, rather that I was witnessing one of the side effects she mentioned. Other patients of her’s, and the caretakers too where somethings driven insane from what they heard through the patients. I demanded that she reverse the procedure, but she explained that I should have read the contract more clearly, without anything left to tell her, I stormed out, hoping that I could find someone else to help my child.  
  
I wanted to surprise my son for his birthday. I took him to the restaurant where I used to go with his mom. It was a place full of memories and love. But as soon as we got there, everything went wrong. My son started to copy the voices of the deceased of the people around us. He had this strange ability that I didn't understand. He could mimic any voice he heard, but he couldn't control it.  
 He said "Happy birthday, sweetie" in a woman's voice. Then he said "This steak is delicious" in a man's voice. I looked at him with concern and tried to calm him down. But it got worse. He copied the voice of the owner, a man who I read about in the papers.   
Copying the voice of a man said "You’re going to kill me in your clean office, Vanzetti? You’re only brother for this godforsaken restaurant? – Bang!Bang!Bang!."  
He said it loud and clear, for everyone to hear. The owner heard it and turned around, and walked towards us with a murderous look.   
I grabbed my son's hand and whispered "We have to get out of here, now." I pulled him towards the door, but it was too late. The owner blocked our way and said "You're not going anywhere, you little freak." He called the security stationed outside of the restaurant, before he could pull it out, my son copied another voice.   
She said "Vanzetti, You’re a criminal? Why do you hurt me like this." And he said it, in her voice, with tears in his eyes.   
The owner stopped and looked at him with shock and confusion. He looked at me and said "Get out.” I nodded and left as the fell to his knees and sobbed.   
  
Things had gotten a bit worse with Jonathan, but for a moment things seemed a bit calm, I was playing catch with my son in the park, hoping to reconnect with him, since he had been forced out of school, being isolated from people his age has been difficult especially when he could now talk to people. Sarah had offered a space for him at a special school, but he was done with being ‘special’.   
Suddenly, Jonathan stopped playing and looked at me with a serious expression. He opened his mouth and spoke in his mother's voice. She sounded scared and angry. She said: "You did this to me. You pushed me down the stairs. You killed me!"  
I felt a cold sweat on my forehead. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. How could he know?   
He continued to speak in her voice, describing the details of that night. How we had a fight over money and how I lost my temper. How I grabbed her by the hair and threw her down the stairs. How she broke her neck and died instantly. How I lied to the police and said it was an accident.  
He looked at me with accusing eyes. He said: "You are a murderer. You are a monster. You don't deserve to be my father."  
I felt a surge of rage and fear. I wanted to silence him, to make him stop. I wanted to run away from this nightmare. But I couldn't move. I was paralyzed by his words. He had exposed my dark secret, the one I had tried to forget for so long.  
I tried to calm him down, to explain that it was an accident, that I loved his mom more than anything. But he didn't believe me. He accused me of lying, of being a murderer. He said he hated me, as a police officer approached as he ran away from me.   
  
Jonathan has gone over to Sarah, for the past two weeks. His started to attend the special school that could assist with guiding him with his abilities, but I’m worried he could find out where his mother’s buried. How do I stop him, from trying something stupid like that? He doesn’t understand he could lose me too, and I’m worried. Worried for him…
