*Delve into the city’s eerie past with a guided tour of its most historic—and haunted!—locations. Real history. Real ghosts. Real scary.*

The ad for the candlelight ghost tour was accompanied by a host of five-star reviews. I went out of curiosity. It was hokey, hoax-y, but not bad entertainment for an evening. Our guide arrived with a small battery-operated candle, not a real one. They were nerdy, nervous, and intensely knowledgeable about local history. Anytime someone on the tour asked about this old Victorian building or that old fountain or anything else in the historic district of our tour, the guide’s eyes would roll back like a computer loading screen and then out of their mouth would pop an answer. Like a human Wikipedia.

Still, it was entertaining. Especially the talk of murders in some of the stately mansions. I suppose every street has some history of crime. But usually you don’t have a tour guide narrating which rich person was pushed out of which window.

By the time we got to the park, though, my patience was wearing thin. It was a cold winter night, the snow slushy under our shoes, all of us shivering in our coats, hands and feet freezing.

What we really came to see, our guide informed us, was inside the park, just past the fountain that was currently closed for the weather. At the other side was an alcove where the park wall curved, and built along it was a stone bench. Above the bench, carved into the wall, was a relief sculpture of dancing figures. The guide’s flashlight beamed across the figures, tortured human shapes in strange poses.

“This park was founded over a hundred years ago," said the guide. "Originally, the sculpture was supposed to represent people enjoying themselves in the park. But as you can see, the figures are strangely contorted…”

By this point I was shivering so hard that I’d had about enough of the ghostly nonsense. I stopped listening to the guide and instead studied the relief sculpture with its six tortured figures. The last figure appeared to be sitting, pulling away from one of the dancers whose hand gripped their shoulder. The sitting figure had arms folded and appeared affronted at the dance. On impulse, to alleviate boredom and get my blood pumping, I jumped past our guide and into the alcove, sat on the bench by the relief sculpture, and mimicked the pose of the sitting figure, arms crossed, glaring at the dancers as if taken aback by their nonsense.

The crowd of tour goers laughed.

The guide blinked at me, goggle-eyed. “Oh,” they said. “Oh. I never go in the alcove.”

Some of the other tour goers had taken out their phones to snap pictures of me, so I held my pose, still miming the sitting figure. Our guide, meanwhile, prattled on about how sometimes people in the park feel the temperature drop, or find themselves shivering or their breath freezing.

My breath was freezing. Duh, it’s winter. It’d been freezing for awhile—

—someone’s hand gripped my shoulder, and I shot up off the bench.

I figured one of the other tour goers was pranking me, sneaking behind me while the guide babbled.

But it was just the wall behind me.

I skittered back out to the crowd where they all laughed, assuming I faked my startlement for effect. I was so surprised I didn't even try to make excuses for myself, just blurted out, “I felt a hand just now. On my shoulder.”

Some ooohs and aaaahs from the crowd. The tour guide pushed up their glasses and suggested we all check our phone pictures. All the pictures of me looked normal. I didn’t see any hand in any of them, though one person said they were sure they saw a shadow behind me (“Yeah, that’s *my* shadow,” I told them). I had them send me the picture anyway as a souvenir, and decided that I must've imagined the hand.

After another forty minutes trudging around in the cold past churches and cemeteries, hearing lectures on history and ghosts, the tour was over. I was frozen to the bone, and glad to go home.

But when I got home, after I shed my thick coat and boots and hurried into the hot shower to warm my frozen flesh, just as I was getting out, I felt it—the brush of fingers on my bare shoulder.

I actually screamed and jumped out of the shower.

There was nobody. Nothing. It felt so real though.

And for the next few days after, periodically, I’d notice it. A weight on my shoulder, as of a hand. Over the days it grew heavier, as if wanting me to notice it was there. And sometimes, when I’d forget about the grip, I’d be reminded when the fingers would squeeze.

When I found bruises one morning, after I woke screaming from a nightmare and felt the fingers gripping agonizingly hard, I finally went to the doctor. They said it looked like someone had definitely grabbed me, not a spirit but an actual person’s hand clenching. They asked if I’d been in a fight or if I felt safe at home. I didn’t know what to say.

Later, I went back to the park. I went and stared at the sculpture. At the sitting figure. I noticed again how the sitting figure seemed to be invited in—no, *pulled* in by the other dancers. How there was a hand on the sitting figure’s right shoulder, squeezing. That hand—that hand on the figure’s shoulder had to be what was on my shoulder. How could I make it let go?

When I turned to leave I stopped in my tracks. Because the invisible grip had tightened. It was so tight, almost like a vice. Tears sprang into my eyes from how much it hurt. “Leave me alone!” I shouted, wrenching free. I stumbled and fell out of the alcove to the pavement and snowy ground. A couple of passersby walking their dog looked over at me. I just scrambled up, embarrassed, and fled. As soon as I got out of the park the grip on my shoulder lightened, but then as I was at the corner, waiting to cross the street, something else happened. Something even more terrifying. A car was coming and I—

I felt it push me.

Next thing I knew, I was stumbling into the street, and the car slammed its brakes and screeched to a halt while the grip on my shoulder shoved me almost under its wheels. I finally broke loose, babbling apologies to the driver, and hurried home.

That’s when I called the tour guide. I left message after message on their voicemail. Finally they called me back.

“Help,” I sputtered. “I still feel it. The hand on my shoulder. I think it’s trying to kill me. What was the story behind that sculpture again? The dancing figures! Tell me!”

I hoped there might be some information that might free me. The tour guide was silent for some moments and I imagined their eyes rolling back as they sifted through their encyclopedic knowledge and brought up the entry on that relief sculpture.

“Oh yes,” they said. And explained the story again. How it was originally meant to represent parkgoers enjoying themselves. Nobody knows when, but at some point people began noticing that the dancing figures appeared contorted and agonized, and that the central figure looked especially demonic. Supposedly, the dancers are all people who went missing, and the central figure is a demonic spirit that haunts the park. He can be seen sometimes walking around the fountain, or in photographs behind those who are soon to disappear.

“But how do I make it let go?” I asked.

“Well to be honest I’ve never heard of anybody feeling its presence outside of the park,” said the guide. “And the figure didn’t show up in the photo with you. Just don’t go back to the park.”

“No—no! You don’t understand. I still feel it. It’s… it’s gripping my shoulder, right now.”

“Gripping your shoulder?” The guide sounded confused. More and more, I was beginning to feel like they didn’t ever get calls like this. Like maybe they, too, assumed it was all a hoax and didn’t buy into the things they told people. “What’s gripping your shoulder?”

“The hand! Just like in the sixth figure, the sitting one on the end—”

“Six?” The guide interrupted, and I could hear the encyclopedic riffling of their thoughts. “No. Five.”

“No, I was copying the pose of the sixth. The sitting one. It—”

“Five,” said the guide firmly. “Definitely five.”

“Listen, the one I was copying—”

“There are five, and they are all dancing. Do you remember my lecture from the park? I talked about the central figure. If there were six, there would be no central figure. It would be three and three split evenly. There are five, two on each side of the central figure. *There is no sixth figure*.” And then the guide, sounding thoughtful, added, “yet.”

I didn’t hear what they said after that. I was scouring through my phone until finally I found the picture with the “shadow” behind me that the other tour goer had sent. There I was, sitting posed with my arms crossed glaring at the relief sculpture.

But the guide was right. There were only five figures visible in the photograph, all dancing.

The hand is squeezing my shoulder now as I type this. I don’t know how long before I get pushed into traffic, or yanked off a bridge, or… held down in the bathtub. The hand squeezes almost constantly now. Nobody believes me. But I’m posting this for the record.

If you take the Candlelight Ghost Tour and see the alcove with the dancing parkgoers, count the figures.

You’ll know what happened to me if you count and there are [six.](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuincyLee/comments/11nxwz3/welcome_thanks_so_much_for_stopping_by/)
