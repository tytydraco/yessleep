It begins, as always, around 3:23 AM.

Time bends. Or maybe I do—bent against the wheel of a memory I can’t scrape off my ribs.

First, the sigh. It’s a sound like old rope fraying. Like the house itself is exhaling after holding its breath too long. Then the shift of weight—barely there—on the hallway floorboards. Fifteen steps. Always fifteen. I’ve counted them for years. Each one lands like a hammer against the inside of my skull. They always pause just outside my bedroom door.

I’ve stopped opening it. Whatever waits out there isn’t meant to be seen.

It’s felt.

It’s the echo of me. That’s the only way I can describe it. A phantom limb of the boy I was at thirteen, severed by trauma but still twitching with pain. He lingers there, just beyond the wood, a silhouette pressed against the grain. I imagine his eyes—empty, hollow wells reflecting the dark I try to lock away.

I’ve tried everything to quiet him. Meds that made me feel like a fogged-up mirror. Therapists who talked like grief was a logic puzzle. Rituals pulled from the bottom of internet rabbit holes—burning sage, burying silver coins, whispering names too old for language. Nothing worked.

Because trauma isn’t a demon you exorcise. It’s a parasite. It splices itself into your wiring.

“It isn’t fair,” I whisper tonight, forehead resting against the unyielding door.

The silence that follows feels thick, like it’s listening.

Then: a voice. Mine, but stripped bare. Cold. Removed. “Was it ever?”

That voice remembers hope only as a setup for pain.

A shrink once called them trauma loops. Patterns etched into the mind. Replaying until you rewrite the story. But how do you change the ending when agony’s the author?

“Let me in,” the ghost murmurs. Barely audible. Heavy as a tombstone.

And cold. A bone-deep chill spills into the room. My skin prickles. Not from fear—but recognition. My body remembers what my mind tries to forget.

“You’re already inside,” I tell him.

It’s not metaphor. He’s in the way I tense when someone gets too close. In the static that builds behind my eyes before sleep. He’s the tremor I hide under silence.

“Then see me,” he pleads.

His voice cracks.

It mirrors mine.

I never look. Not at 3:23. Not when the weight shifts. Not when the door breathes.

But tonight, something inside flickers.

I open my eyes.

The room is empty. Still. Too cold.

My gaze drifts to the antique mirror on the wall.

Its silvered surface seems... wrong. Like it’s remembering something, too.

I don’t see him, not fully. But there’s pressure on the glass. An impression that wasn’t there before. A ripple in my reflection. My eyes too wide. Too hollow. Like they’re haunted by something they almost recognize.

For a moment—just a moment—I think I see a second set of eyes. Distant. Watching.

“I’m sorry,” a whisper emerges from nowhere. Or from the mirror. Or from me.

“I never wanted this.”

“Neither did I,” I breathe.

My reflection flickers. Twitches. Offers a smile far too sad to be reassuring.

The second set of eyes is gone.

Or maybe they never were.

The distortion fades. The cold lingers, but it’s thinner now. Loosened.

The clock clicks to 3:24 AM.

I am alone.

But the echo remains—imprinted on the air, stitched into my skin, curled tight in the marrow of me.

Tomorrow, the sigh will come again. The steps will start again. The weight behind the door will return.

Because this inheritance is mine. A ghost I can’t quite see, whose name I try not to remember.

Waiting, just beyond the edge of my reflection.
