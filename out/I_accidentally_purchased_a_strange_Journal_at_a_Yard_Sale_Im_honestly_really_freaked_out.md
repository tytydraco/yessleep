Hey there everyone! I've not actively posted anywhere in quiet a while, so please bare with me here/  I'm not sure how to phrase this so I'll keep it brief.   
Basically, I bought a series of books from a Yard Sale from this older fella, said he was moving out of town so he could be closer to his grand kids. Spent most of his life overseas or something, wants to spend his last years close to those he loves, that sorta thing.   
Anywho, most of the books are history related, I love em' a lot. I got some stuff on Churchill, Washington. There is something weird though. In the box, a little tiny book popped out. Its not overly big, about the size of my hand, and looked like a scribbler?? Anyway I decided to open it up and it appears to be a Journal of some sort. I'm going to post the first entry I see here, I figure this is the right community for it, though keep in mind this is NOT the first entry of the Journal itself. If theres any interest, I'll post the rest periodically when I have time. Fair warning, this seems pretty dark and I have no idea what its talking about?

*I'm starting to wonder if this rain will let up? Its been falling down now for a while. Funny thing, I always hated rain. I find as though it acts as natures*  
*static and who the hell willingly listens to dead air? Lunatics no doubt. Miley, though? She loved it. She'd always say to me "Its the Earths way of cleansing its emotions."*  
*I chuckle thinking about that now, she always had such a positive spin to put on everything. God.. I still haven't racked up the nerve to tell Kimmy and Carter that*  
*she isn't coming back. I mean sure, she has only been gone what? A few hours? It isn't like it used to be, no one spends more then twenty minutes out in that hell hole*  
*and comes back telling about it. Miley stubbornly insisted that the symphony that the rain drops bring would surely drown out any noise she could have possibly made..*  
*I'm starting to think that wasn't the case. I've thought the Fakes could smell us out a while now, noise doesn't really have much to do with it or else they'd have*  
*ripped each other limb from limb in the days after their arrival. Anyway, I don't wanna dwell. I've seen enough tragedy in North Fall's for one life time. I've taken*  
*a quick stock on our rations, we've still got enough food and water between me and Miley's kids here another week or so but after that.. I guess it'll be my turn.*  
*I'm not sure if I'm ready to face the Fakes, not after what I've seen them do to Corey... I don't fear death, I feel that is inevitable nowadays but to leave these kids scared and alone?*  
*I couldn't do that.*  
*There is always the Quiet Pills. My handy applicator, however, Miley took with her.. Where the Hell did I put that spare revolver?"*
