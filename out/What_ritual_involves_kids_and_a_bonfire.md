“Did you see that?” My mother said as we sped past an orange blur. I saw out of the corner of my eye. “What was it?” I asked. I was trying to see what was in the rearview mirror, but there was nothing except the inky darkness of the country road. “They were having a bonfire just like we did a couple of weeks ago.” “Do you reckon it was a burnoff like ours was?” I asked because we didn’t have a bonfire a few weeks ago. It was a big pile of cuttings from trees and bushes we lit on fire because it took up too much space. “Theirs is bigger and a lot kids dancing around it. Which is stupid because what if one of them tripped and fell in!” This should have set off alarm bells in my head; it was extremely out of character for anyone in my local area, and honestly, it seemed more insidious than innocent. Instead, I was more focused on the road. I had only recently gotten my driver’s license; it was irregularly dark on the road, and my mother’s car was some European import, which I was struggling to drive safely. My mum didn’t bring it up again on the rest of the drive into town.

Next I was running home. My mum was on her way to pick me up after she had gone home with the shopping while I had been at the gym. I sent a message to my mother, but I got no reply. Still, I wanted to get home ASAP. So, I began to run home to close the gap between myself and my mother. I was running and enjoyed the cold night breeze on my face when the sky turned red. 

It was like a flash-bang as fire erupted and consumed the sky, a word in a language I couldn't even identify echoed around me. My eyes had no time to adjust to the sudden blast of light from the sky. So I shut them tight. Dazed and left in darkness, my other senses began to pick up on everything else. The rush of heat was intense, akin to the blast of hot air when you open an oven. I could feel sweat forming on my brow. The smell of cow shit had been replaced with burnt hair, gunpowder and cooking meat. I heaved, dinner rushing up my throat. Beyond my retching, I heard a cacophony of livestock calling out, sizzling, and delighted screams. It sounded like the sound children make when celebrating someone’s birthday. I struggled to keep my eyes open, blinking profusely as my eyes hadn’t adjusted to the sky, and the heat made it feel like they would dry up if I didn’t keep them wet. Eventually, I got my bearings and was able to look around. The first thing my eyes were drawn to was roadkill; I couldn’t see in the dark. But now, with the illumination from the burning sky, I could see it in all its grotesque glory. It looked like a possum. The next thing I noticed was dancing fire. A small and strange inferno frolicked on two legs of flame, twisting and gliding towards the possum's body. I watched, my mouth agape, as it stopped beside the possum. With an exaggerated leap, it dived into the possum carcass. 

Confused, I stared as it dissolved into the roadkill. Seconds later, the corpse began to writhe as its joints pivoted unnaturally, and its flattened body began to inflate. It got onto all fours before it started to tear and contort. Its jaw opened wider and wider, splitting the tissue as its mouth recessed deeper and deeper into the possum’s body. The top of the possum’s head rose from its body like a snake getting ready to strike as the jaw fell limply, dragging on the road. It’s ribs broke and ripped from its flesh and moved around freely, eventually settling like pincers lining the new upper jaw of the possum. As it began marching towards me, the possum’s tail was pulled back into its body, sprouted out of the possum’s new throat, and followed more. These new tongues whipped and thrashed around like tentacles, and I watched as they flailed with such vigor that they tore and gouged at the possum’s flesh. After this final adaptation, the possum finally charged at me. 

I don’t know if what happened next was divine intervention or just pure luck, but as the possum closed the gap, I was frozen in fear. I watched it get closer and closer until one of the tongues struck the left front leg of the possum. This completely severed it. Because of this, the possum lost its balance and went tumbling, ass-over-head, into some gorse next to the road. This broke me from my trance, and I pivoted 180 degrees into a sprint. Overall the commotion, I could hear hoarse hissing from behind me; that was when I saw the possum had recovered and was charging at me, it's right front leg had somehow shift into the middle and it was sprinting at me again. I looked around, panicked, and noticed a large branch in the grass next to the road. I sprinted harder than I will ever sprint to grab that stick. I picked it up and spun around, clutching it like a bat. The possum was airborne and flying at my face, all of it's tongues stiff and pointed like spear ready to impale my face. With a swing that would have gotten me drafted by the Yankees, the branch connected with the possum in such a way that it exploded upon impact, sending chunks of it flying off to my left. I didn’t watch to see whether it had died; I just ran in the opposite direction. 

I ran until I found a place to hide. There was a small shed out in a field far from where the possum burst open. That’s where I am now. After what happened with the possum, I was extremely vigilant while running. Everything is extremely fucked up here and non of it makes sense. I saw a man crouched over in the middle of the road calling for help; it was only when I got within 10 meters I realised he couldn’t be shouting so loud while his head was buried in the road. I saw a horse that had been lit on fire chase down a herd of cows, and when it touched one, the entire herd combusted like they had all been drenched in gasoline. I ran past a hole the size of a manhole cover in the middle of the road that was talking. For some reason, I stopped and listened, and it kept insisting it was my grandmother. As I turned around and continued running, it kept saying over and over, “Come and let Nana tell you a secret!” The worst is that I saw a sheep get possessed by one of those fire things while it was still alive. It was screeching in pain as it changed, I forced myself to look away and started sprinting; I don’t think it saw me. 

I keep trying to text my parents, but all my messages get read but go unanswered. I tried calling my mum once, and the person who picked up the phone whispered, “You are making too much noise!” And hung up. I am pretty sure the voice on the other end of the phone was my own. This is my last line of communication to the outside. Despite being out in the middle of nowhere, I somehow still have a strong signal, and even though I have been on my phone religiously since I found shelter, my phone hasn’t lost any battery; in fact, I think it has gone up by 1% or 2%. I am so thirsty, but there is nothing to drink. The only thing I want at this stage is answers; I am so confused. The only thing I can think could have caused this was those fucking kids and their bonfire but even that is a stretch. I think I'm despite for anything. So, can anyone please tell me what ritual involves kids and a bonfire?
