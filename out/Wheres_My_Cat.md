We have cameras set up in our house. It's not meant to be weird or creepy. There are three of us splitting the rent, and we collectively have rabbits and cats in the household. It's good to make sure everyone is getting along, as well as to be able to tell when the rabbits have last eaten if one of them seems sick. Honestly, I don't check them all that often. For the last few days, I've been taking care of the critters solo, since the rest of our little faux family is out of town on a holiday vacation, just a few days in San Diego to get away from it all. 

I have a bit of an active imagination at times, but I also ground myself in reality and try to keep to my senses as best I can. 

Our house moves a bit in the wind. It's not unsafe or lacking sturdiness. It's just a 50 year old house that gets hit with wind and the occasional rain and has a bit of give to it from a few lives and tenets worth of use. That said, the normality of the occasional sway doesn't mean that there's still not an occasional startling of the creatures when the house shakes, and tonight, with the wind ripping through the small crease in the 'closed' window, my bedroom door was rattling a bit more than normal in the conditions. I was working on something I can't even remember now, and feeling pretty cozy, so I decided that rather than go all the way downstairs, I'd just quickly check the bunny and cat cameras to see how everyone was holding up in the weather. 

Loading up the Cat cam, the instant I got to the feed, I saw one of the two cats running away from it, up the stairs, as fast as she could. Outside my door, I heard the little paw patters of a kitty running on hardwood. Assuming she was just startled, I quickly scrolled back through the camera to see what got her running in the first place.

Once I went back, it was strange. It took me a minute to understand that the feed wasn't broken.

I had to see other small movements happening in the background with the wind to make sure it wasn't frozen. 

But for two hours and twenty three minutes, from 1am exactly until the moment I checked the camera at 3:23am, my calico cat was sitting completely still. Staring at the camera. Not at the camera device. INTO the lens. She didn't blink. She didn't move. She sat down and starting looking at the viewer. It was baffling. I really didn't know what to make of it. As I scrolled, I could hear the scritch scratch of her trying to put her paws under my door. However, I was feeling a little freaked myself, and wanted to see what was going on to startle her, so I kept moving the feed closer and closer to live to see what caused her to run off. 

And it was ...nothing?

...or maybe, it was me.

The moment I had checked the camera that she was looking into, the stillness gave way to a brief change in her face. It was something I've never seen in her before... 

It was hate.



She looked furious for a half second, before turning and BOLTING up the stairs. Just at the moment I had checked. 



I was just about to go find her to make sure she wasn't SUPER mad at me. I was sure there was some explanation for what made her upset. Some coincidence to justify that look in her face. 

The problem is, the stream has kept going. It's only about 30 seconds behind live at this point. And she's back downstairs...staring at the camera...she's staring at me...

I don't know where my cat is. I want to say she's downstairs right now, sitting in front of the cat camera, staring at me and being a weirdo. That's what I can SEE in the feed, and I just jumped back to live, and it's still the case...I can literally see her in the feed....but I'm just not sure. 



It's weird to say this about a cat.



but I think she's smiling at the camera.



And something is still scratching at my door.
