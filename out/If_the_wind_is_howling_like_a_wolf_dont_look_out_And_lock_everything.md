So, apparently ’’living the dream” sometimes can have downsides. I mean, I had it all. And I didn’t even need to work that much for it. Since I started highschool, I slowly started realising that I don’t need people around me. When a party, or school event was cancelled, and everyone was complaining, I secretly felt happy. It’s not like I’m fully antisocial, I liked spending time with friends, but I just didn’t need it. I was completly fine alone, with my only connection to the society being the internet.  
  
I finished highschool like everyone else, and then went to university like nearly everyone else. And then came work. It was boring as hell. I saw the people around me, and old friends burn out, and become zombies, who repeat everyday the exact same way, or start drinking, or doing drugs in a worse case, and then either die early, or live as one of the thousands of biorobots of a company. And the worse part was when I noticed that I started to behave the same way. Getting up early, going to work, coming home, feeding my pets, scrolling endlessly on social media, and then going to bed, thinking of how I wasted my whole afternoon again. And then the ad, which changed my life, randomly popped up.  
  
A farmhouse. A large one. Miles away from everyone. For such a low price that I tought for sure that it’s a scam. I mean who wouldn’t want to live in a place like that? Even though I didn’t think much of it at first. But then it popped up again. And again. At one point I checked the site. It seemed legit. So I eventually messaged the guy, because i tought that I can always turn it off if it turns out to be a scam.  
  
Well, turns out it wasn’t a scam. The guy inherited it from his parents, but couldn’t do anything with the house, so he tried to get rid of it as fast as possible. And now I’m here. Thinking of the same, except I still want to continue this lifestile, but not here.   
  
The first months went well. I was able to buy the livestock that was left ont he barn as well, so I got a relatively easy start. I had chickens, ducks, four small cows, two pigs and a donkey. This was a lucky start for me, because i was able to learn tze basic of animal keeping with a smaller population. In the following months, I expanded the numbers, with three horses (it was an old dream of mine, and they were proved to be useful eventually), some goats, turkeys, two emus, and a leonberger dog. Sorry. I’m getting off of the subject.   
  
As the weeks passed, my routone started to form. Buti t was different than before. Here, everything which I had to do had a reason behind it, and I always had enough freetime as well. Everything went fine until the first sign. I wish I took that seriously, but of course I didn’t until it was too late.   
  
In the summer, i taught horseriding to some local kids. It earned me some money, and I liked working with them. They weren’t loud and evil, like many city kids, and I enjoyed that I can teach them about the animals in general as well, so hopefully they wouldn’t gorw up to think like many others, who say that we are the only creatures that matter. On a late August afternoon, while we brushed the horses with some kids, who were big enough to do so, a girl turned to me. She was around 12, and obsessed with animals, and particulally horses. That’s common at her age, but she really cared about all parts of taking care of them and not just the riding. So, she was the one who turned to me with a scared face, and asked:  
  
\-You are going to lock them up real good when the wind howls in the autumn, right?  
\-Don’t worry, they wont get cold. -I answered, with a grin. She knew so much about them for her age, and yet she was still a child, not knowing that most animals tolerate cold weather better than humans.  
\-Of course they don’t get cold! I’m talking about the times when the wind howls like a wolf! Will they be safe then? They shouldn’t be able to see outside, like you in those times.  
\-Yes, darling. I’ll make sure that they are safe. -Yeah, I was stupid, and I should have listened tot he girl more, but I was tired, and to be honest, I didn’t reaílly care. I tought that she don’t want the horses to get scared or something. Even though she knew better than that.  
  
Not long after, I basically forgot about this, until September came, and at one day, I went to the store in the nearest village, to buy some nails to fix up the fence of the cows.   
\-Gettin’ ready for the howling winds? -Asked the cashier, as I paid for the nails.   
\-No, the buildings are pretty strong, they won’t get blown away. I just need to fix a fence. -The cashier gave me a strange look, but didn’t say anything.  
  
An other month passed, and October arrived. At this point, it became my habit to sit out ont he porch in a warm jacket, and watch the afternoon turning into night. Mouse, my dog was laying beside my chair, as i drank some tea, and wached the darkening sky. Thats when the wind started getting stronger. Fortunately, I didn’t feel much of it on the porch, but I saw the branches shaking, and the leaves of the nearby trees falling and dancing in the porch light. Then the sound started.   
  
At first, it was like the usual sound of the wind, but there was something unsettling in it. Before this point, no matter how strong the wind was, it never really made a sound. A memory formed my mind, one of that summer afternoon with the little girl.   
’’You are going to lock them up real good when the wind howls in the autumn, right?”  
And suddenly, it didn’t seem like such a bad idea.   
  
At the time I finished closing the animals in their sheds, the wind was howling. It was exactly like multiple wolfs. You couldn’t tell the difference at all. Mouse waited for me ont he porch, whining. In never heard him whine before, only hen I came home after a longer time than 15 minutes, and he was excited. But now he was scared. I called him in the house, and locked the door behind us. Not long after, the sound stopped. After the wind stopped, everything went silent, for some time and then smething started to rhustle outside. I peeked out of the front window to see whats causing it. This nearly led to my death.  
  
At first, I saw nothing. Then, like some doomed musical, it started. It reminded me of the start of Cats (please don’t mention the movie, I’m not speaking about that abomination), where the actors come out to the stage and freeze, one by one. Except these things weren’t anything like actors. The first which jumped into the glaze of the porch light, looked like a wolf at first glance. But as its mates arived, one by one, frozen in the position which they landed in in the light, I started to see some things that were off. They had longer fingers on their front legs, almost like ours, and their legs bended in weird angles. Their mouths were too wide, and their eyes didn’t look like wolf eyes at all. Some of them didn’t even have pupils if I saw it right.   
  
At first, they just stood there, frozen. Then, seemingly without any cordination, some of them vanished into the darkness. And then, the others started to dance. Yes, they were dancing, or at least they were doing something really similar. I can’t really describe it, but it looked so beautiful, that I started to feel eager to join them, and constantly had to remind myself that this is not right. But the movement slowly sucked me in, until the point where I didn’t even care when I saw the other creatures return with one of my horses. The poor animal’s eyes were rolling in terror, but it couldn’t run anywhere, because the wolves surrounded it, leading it to the middle of a forming circle. Then again, everything stopped for a second. The horse stood perfectly still in the middle, while the wolves stalekd it without any movement at all. And then one of them jumped ont he horses back, its mouth opening awfully wide, ripping into the neck of the poor thing. This broke the stillness, and the pack immediately swarmed the body. There wasn’t any order, they would even bite each other without hesistation.   
  
The beauty of their previous performance was gone. But not entirelly. There was some beauty in this chaos, the primal rage of nature, which you can only feel when you have an adrenaline brust. I caught myself pressing my face tot he window, my mouth watering, as these unnatural beasts devoured the remains of one of my beloved animals. And then the one which I assumed to be the pack leader, looked up with its bloodsoaked face. It lifted one of its front leg, and made the univrsal sign of ’come here’ with its weird, elongated fingers. I knew I had to go. I wanted to run with the pack, to howl with them in the night, to hunt, to became one with them. My legs carried themselves to the front door.  
  
I was stopped halfway. My dear, lovely Mouse grabbed my shirt, and started pulling it with all of his strenght. Fortunately, he didn’t tear the shirt. I stopped. The spell started to break. As the dog felt that I stopped, he let go of me, and started barking. And that was the point when I got my full control back. Then I heard something scretching my door. Then banging on it. Mouse stood in front o me, barking loudly at the door. I wasn’t able to do anything. And then, suddenly, as it began, it stopped. There was only silence. Then the wind. It howled like a wolfpack.  
  
There was nothing left of the poor horse when I checked in the morning. The two remaining horse and the donkey run out of their shed, and I had to spend the morning trying to gain back their trust, and build up their confidence, to come back to their home. The next day, I went to the village, to buy more nails, planks, and fence support. The cashier didn’t say anything, but from his eyes, I knew that he knew why I need those.   
  
Sincet hat doomed day, it happended three times. I didn’t look out again, and there aren’t any new victims, but the banging ont he door keeps getting stronger. They are desperate.   
  
So please, alwys listen tot he old village tales. You don’t want a similar situation. And if the wind starts howling like a wolf, close everything, and all of your animals, and never ever look out.
