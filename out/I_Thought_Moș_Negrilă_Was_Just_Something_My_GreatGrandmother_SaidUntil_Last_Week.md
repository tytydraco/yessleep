I grew up hearing stories about Moș Negrilă, the old winter spirit my great grandmother always warned us about. She told us that he wanders villages at night, checking windows and chimneys, but he doesn’t take children who misbehave. He stays with the ones who don’t listen when they’re told to ignore him. I laughed it off as a kid. Everyone in the family did. But last week, I realized some stories are real.

It started small. I was alone in our house, the first time in years I had the place entirely to myself. My parents had gone to a relative’s wedding, leaving me with the quiet, snow-covered village outside. At first, I heard nothing but the wind against the windows, soft and rhythmic. Then, very faintly, I thought I heard the sound of small jingling bells. I froze, heart hammering, and listened. It was gone.

The next day, I noticed footprints in the fresh snow outside the front door. They didn’t match my boots. They didn’t match my dog’s paws. And they ended abruptly, right at the doorstep, as if whoever made them had simply vanished. I convinced myself it was a trick of the light, a leftover prank from neighborhood kids. I didn’t sleep well that night, but I laughed nervously at myself in the morning.

Two nights later, I woke to a scraping sound coming from the kitchen. My bedroom is on the second floor, but the sound carried clearly through the house. I sat up in bed, straining my ears. There it was again: a low, deliberate dragging, like something being pulled across the floor. My stomach turned cold.

I crept to my window and peeked outside. Nothing. The snow was undisturbed. Yet, I could feel eyes on me, pressing from the darkness. I told myself it was impossible, that I was imagining things. But as I looked down the street, I thought I saw a shadow, hunched and moving unnaturally. I blinked. It was gone.

The following day, I tried to convince myself I was being paranoid. I kept my curtains open, lights on, doors locked. Everything was normal. And yet, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something or someone was studying me.

It escalated quickly.

I was brushing my teeth late at night when I noticed a reflection in the bathroom mirror. At first, I thought it was my imagination: a tall, thin figure standing behind me, hunched under dark tattered furs. But when I spun around, there was nothing. I backed into the hallway, heart racing, and heard it: the faintest jingling, like tiny bells strung together, echoing down the empty house.

That night, I stayed awake in bed, listening. Every creak of the floorboards, every rustle in the hall made my stomach twist. Around 2 a.m., I heard a thump outside my bedroom door, soft but deliberate. Then silence. My hand shook as I reached for my phone, but the signal was dead. The house was old, and the walls sometimes interfered but tonight it felt deliberate.

I slept fitfully, dozing in short bursts, dreaming of a figure standing over my bed, face obscured by shadows. When I woke, I found something chilling: a small bell on my nightstand, not mine, covered in faint scratches that didn’t make sense. I didn’t dare touch it with my bare hands.

Over the next few days, I started seeing him more often. Sometimes, in the corner of my living room, crouched like a child, watching me. Sometimes, outside the frosted window, staring up at my face through the glass. Every time I moved to look directly, he vanished. But I could feel him. Always just outside the range of my sight.

Last night was the worst.

I woke at 1:37 a.m. (I know the exact time because my phone’s screen lit up with a notification: a message from an unknown number). But before I could check, I heard it: footsteps pacing slowly upstairs. My house only has two floors, and I was alone. My hands shook as I grabbed a kitchen knife and crept upstairs.

The hallway was empty. The bedroom door was closed. I approached slowly. My breath came out in shallow, icy puffs. And then I saw him at the foot of my bed.

Moș Negrilă, exactly as my great grandmother had described him: hunched, wrapped in dark, tattered furs, skin pale, eyes dark and gleaming, mouth pulled into a wide, unnatural grin. The room was freezing. My blankets were pulled off me before I could react, and I could feel his icy hands hovering, brushing the hair from my face. I wanted to scream, but no sound came out.

I ran. I don’t even remember how. I stumbled down the stairs, out the front door, into the snow. And then he was gone. No tracks in the snow. No footprints, no sign he had been there at all.

I tried to call my parents. No answer. My phone was dead again. I ran to a neighbor’s house, pounding on their door, breath ragged. They were confused, told me to calm down. When I looked back at my home, there was nothing. But I could feel him watching.

I stayed with my neighbor all night. This morning, I returned cautiously. The front door was ajar. I stepped inside, heart pounding. Everything was in place except on the window sill, there it was: a single, small bell, resting in the dust, scratched and worn.

I’ve barricaded my bedroom door tonight. I haven’t touched the bell. But I can hear it. Softly, faintly, jingling somewhere in the house.

I don’t know what Moș Negrilă wants. I don’t know why he’s here. I only know one thing: tonight, he’s watching me.

And the bell jingled again.
