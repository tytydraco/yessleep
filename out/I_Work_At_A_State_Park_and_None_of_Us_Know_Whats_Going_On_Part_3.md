Part 2:

Last Thursday morning the report came in from Ellen that the Fog was out on the lake. No problem, only slightly more inconvenient than if it was in the Swamps like normal. I briefly mentioned the Fog in part 1 but if you don’t remember there’s a fog that just sits in the park and never dissipates. One of our many jobs as rangers is to find and report where the fog is everyday and change the sign at the front of the park to accurately reflect its location. I really think that most of the people who visit the park think that the fog sign is either a joke or has a typo. But no. There’s no typo, and it’s not a joke. 

Welcome to Richard L. Hornberry State Park! Today The Fog is on the lake

The park wasn’t too busy that day. Afterall it was a Thursday in early March. Though I’ve come to find that little things like work and family life tend not to bother the fishing habits of the local middle aged man. I was in the little rangers hut that sits at the front of the park handing out brochures and checking fishing licenses, or at least that’s what I was supposed to be doing, but no one was coming in so I spent most of the early morning on my phone. 
Honk!
Startled, I looked up to see a little white Ford Ranger, with a fishing boat in tow, and two rather stereotypical looking gentlemen in the truck. 

“We ‘sposed check sum’n wih you?” The driver gargled. 

“Morning fellas, y'all boys going fishing today?” 

“Nah, we’s goin’ on a little love cruise. The sam hill you think we doin’ boy.”

“Fishing licences,” I sighed.

I don’t know why I even try to be nice to people anymore, at least the fishermen. I almost always get some kind of sarcastic reply, tobacco spit at my shoes, or otherwise unpleasant response that leaves me wondering why I ever wanted to be a park ranger to begin with. They showed me their licenses and then drove off towards the boat docks. 

Around twelve Ellen came to relieve me from my post. The changing of the guard. Time for me to go, uh, where was I supposed to go? I started thinking about Ellen and completely forgot. 

“Hey James, time to switch!” She said, ripping the door open and nearly off its hinges.

Working under the conditions that have been thus far described you could imagine, or possibly even understand how a man could become a little jumpy, go about his business on the edge, fight or flight constantly just under the brim, primed to spill over.

“Get up doofus!” Ellen said, helping me up off the floor. 

“Heh heh, uh, yeah,” I said. Beautiful recovery.

“Don’t forget it’s your turn to deal with the squirrel pile. I walked through there today and it’s really bad this week, lots of blood.” She scrunched up her face and bared her teeth apologetically. 

“Fun times,” I said, exiting the hut. I climbed onto the atv and headed off for the tool shed to find the trailer and shovel. I hate squirrel day. 

I exchanged a half mumbled, “how’s it goin?” to a group of now traumatized hikers as I dumped another shovel-full of squirrels into a wheelbarrow. 

“Nice day,” I said to yet another hiker as he passed by. 

“Sure is.” He replied. Unfortunately he stopped, likely thinking that we were about to have a conversation. However when I wheeled that barrow full of dead squirrels past him and dumped it into the trailer hitched to the parks side by side, he suddenly didn’t feel like talking anymore. He honestly looked a little sick. 

“Jimmy, come in Jimmy” Phil came in over the radio. I hate when he calls me Jimmy.

“Yeah.” I said, taking the moment to rest and grab a drink, there was still quite a bit of squirrel pile left to shovel. 

“Yeah, Jimmy, I’m gonna need you to go down to the docks and check out these fish this guy caught. Once you’re finished with the squirrels of course.” 

Great. 

I finished up with the squirrels and got back in the side by side. As I did I saw a man coming up the trail the same direction that the last two hikers came from. He looked an awful lot like the last guy I talked to. All these guys look the same. Flip open any REI catalogue and you’ve seen him. Patagonia vest, brown Patagonia pants, Patagonia hat, expensive trail runner shoes, maybe even trekking poles. What purpose you could possibly find at Richard L. Hornberry State Park for trekking poles is beyond me. 

The trail from the East side back to the West side of the lake is a fairly mundane stretch of double track that is just wide enough for a Toyota Tacoma or even an adventurous Subaru. The trail crosses the dam and below the dam the river forks, that is where the Swamps are. The dam is where the squirrels get dumped.  Just right over the edge. Now anytime a vehicle crosses the dam no less than 150 catfish, at this point mutated to such an unnaturally large size, swim just beneath, ready to gorge themselves on the squirrel corpses. Doesn’t matter to me. I dump the trailer load of squirrels into the water, and continue down to the docks. 


“Nope, certainly nothing normal about that.” I said staring down at the amalgamation of fins, scales, and I think an eyeball that was supposed to pass as a fish. 

“You expecting us to do something about that?” I said.

“What Ranger Jimmy is trying to say sir is that we’ll be conducting a thorough investigation into this to see if this is some kind of disease or otherwise dangerous biohazard.” Phil chimed in barely letting me finish my sentence. 

Good, things pretty friggin weird if you ask me. Been fishin forty seven years now ain’t never seen a thing like that.”

Clearly none of those forty seven years were spent at Richard L. Hornberry. 
The man turned over the five gallon bucket to us and walked back to his vehicle. As his truck made it out of eyeshot Phil turned to me and said,

“Dump that thing back in the lake. I’ll be in my office if you need anything.” 
He proceeded to jump in the side by side and drive off to the office building. I was left at the docks with a sorry excuse for a fish, a five gallon bucket, and no way of getting anywhere else in the park except on foot. It was already about 4:00 pm and the sun would be setting in a couple of hours. Then my radio squawked.

“Oh Jimmy, if you’re looking for something to do, head up to the campground, we’ve got a few campers this weekend, make sure they’re all settled in and see if they need anything. Consider it a wellness check, thought I heard some screaming coming from that way earlier.” It was kind of hard to hear him over the sound of the side by side.

“The East or West campground? I asked.

“West.” 

Screams on the westside are generally not a good sign. The East side is where the old mine is and as stated in previous entries screams do occasionally emanate from there. This is not to say that screams on the west side are necessarily indicative of foul play, sometimes the park just screams I don’t know how else to put it. 

“10-4” I radioed back. 

The Westside campground. About an hour's hike from the docks. Which would mean of course that I’d be hiking back in the dark. Great.

I dumped the strange fish back into the river and watched as it sank to the bottom, faster than any rock I had ever seen. Whatever. I just left the five gallon bucket there. Someone in need might come and scoop it up. I noticed that white Ford Ranger I checked in this morning was still in the parking lot. I suppose if the fishing is good then there’s no rush to leave. Then again the fishing isn’t particularly good at Hornberry. For some reason the size of the lake makes people think there’s gotta be a lot of fish in it. I’m sure there is, but the fish here are too busy trying to survive their own horrors to worry about shiny spinners or crank baits or anything like that. Some whoppers have definitely been caught out of here, but I’ve never had much luck, and I have seen my fair share of fishermen leaving empty handed, groaning and mumbling to themselves. Then again, that might not be because of the lack of fish. 

I began to make my way towards the Westside campgrounds. From the docks you can cross a floating bridge and make your way up a short trail to a service road. The service road goes straight to the campground but like I said the campground is way back, actually it’s called the Westside campground but it's really close to the north end of the park. Not quite in the Pines mind you, but the Pines are only a fifteen minute hike from there. 

I reached the service road and began walking. From behind me I heard the unmistakable sound of a side by side. I guess Phil decided to go check out the campground himself. When it pulled up next to me I realized that it wasn’t Phil, it was Ellen. 

“Care for a lift soldier?” She cooed. 

“Uh, um, yeah?” I stuttered back.

“Hop in then.” 

On the side by side the trip to the campground was halved. Though with Ellen, I’d ride The Circuit. The Circuit is the massive trail that loops the entire park. It goes through all four areas, The Swamps, The Westside, The Eastside, The Pines, all the way around, starts and ends at the lodge. To hike it I think it’s something like twelve hours. It has been done in a day, but the poor guy that did that has been in a medically induced coma for the better part of a year now. 

When we got to the campground we found the place in a frenzy. There were two groups of tent campers and a few RVs. All of them, packing their things frantically. 

“Can we help you folks?” I asked. I was met with wide eyed stares, one of the family's little toddlers started crying. 

“Throw anything we left out in the camper.” 

Ellen and I began tossing things into the back of their camper. Things like keys, and wallets, and other little trinkets they’d forgotten to throw in already. No sooner did we shut the door to their Airstream than they backed out and took off down the road out of the park. He backed up so quickly the trailer jackknifed and hit a tree. I have to say it is good to know that with enough speed you can unjackknife a trailer like that without even having to get out of the truck. All the other campers were gone in another few moments and the Westside campground was cleared. 

“Well that’s a shame. I wonder what it was that got them spooked?” I said, hands on my hips as I watched the last trailer hit the left turn out of the campground hard enough to send it up on two wheels. 

Just then we heard a blood curdling, ear piercing, guttural scream. It really didn’t come from anywhere, it just filled the whole of the air around us. 

“That’d be it.” Ellen said as the two of us scrambled for the side by side. We made it back to the front of the park in about ten minutes.

With the campers all gone and the last of the day hikers speeding out of the park by sunset the park was empty. Since no one was there, and definitely no one spending the night, us workers got together in the common room at the lodge to destress, have a few drinks, and tell a few stories. It wasn’t often that we all got to hangout and really talk.

Aaron launched into a story about his time on the East side this week and began to tell us all about a strange hiker he had encountered.

“The guy must have been trying to see how many times he could walk that little loop trail that goes around the cliffs. You know the one, what’s it called, the Blackberry Trail?”

A silence fell across the room. All the lights dimmed a little. Jordan, Ellen, and myself all slowly sat up in our chairs and leaned forward, exchanging troubled glances. Jordan nearly choked on his drink. 

“Oh no, my bad, not the Blackberry Trail, it's the Blackhawk Ridge Trail.”

The three of us eased back into our chairs, Jordan began to sip at his drink again and the lights carried on strong as ever. 

“So yeah, anyway, I was shoveling squirrels and this guy passed me, tried to say hi but I think he saw the squirrels and decided to keep going. Then like twenty minutes later here he comes again from the same direction, tries to say hi again, sees the squirrels again, and then just walks off, again! I had finished up with the squirrels and was going back to the spot to look for my pocket knife. I realized I had dropped it in the process of shoveling. No sooner do I make it back to the spot than I see that hiker again. He was in a yellow Patagonia puffer vest and had one of those weird looking Patagonia hats.”

“REI catalogue.” I chimed in.

“Exactly like an REI catalogue. But yeah that time we were able to kind of talk, found out his name is David. Right about that time when the conversation was turning awkward a squirrel fell off the cliff and hit the freshly cleared ground below with a squeal and a splat. David had seen about enough and kept on hiking down the trail. I looked for my pocket knife for a while but to no avail. I was too busy trying to dodge falling squirrels to keep much attention on that knife. They should really issue us umbrellas to bring out there. I know you’ll find it hard to believe guys but I’m telling you I saw David again. This time though he just kind of said hi and kept walking.”

“You know I saw a guy that looked a lot like that today,” I said. 

“I think I saw a guy like that about a month back,” Jordan added.

We all collectively looked to Ellen to see if she had had an encounter with this guy. 

“Don’t look at me, I don’t go to the East side much.” 

“Well this just goes to prove my theory, all hikers look the same. Straight out of an REI catalogue, and all of the campers lately seem right out of an L.L. Bean commercial you know.”

Just then the ancient grandfather clock in the lodge chimed twelve. The ancient grandfather clock that has been broken for twenty years. We all decided that that was enough and took off for our cars, and I for my cabin. 


I know this might be hard to believe but sometimes it is normal around here. Friday was a normal day. I spent my time doing some regular trail maintenance on the West side. I fixed a plank that had broken on the boardwalk in the swamps, and I sat for a long time in the welcome hut, typing some of this story. It was a very normal day. Saturday on the other hand, that was a different story. 

“Jimmy, have you noticed that white truck down at the docks? That’s been there since Thursday morning hasn’t it?”

“Yeah, I checked those guys in Thursday morning. You mean to tell me that they are still here?”

“Well I mean the truck is still here. Those two guys, well, we’ll see. Look Jimmy I’ve got a lot of paperwork to do in my office, why don’t you grab Ellen and go out on the lake and try to find them.”


“10-4 Boss.” I said. Now to find Ellen. 

I really had no idea where she was but I was determined to find her. I put in several radio calls and never got anything in return. 
And then a call came.

“Oh hey Jimmy, silly me, I forgot I gave Ellen the weekend off. Jordan is going to meet you down by the docks.” 
“Thanks.” I squawked back.

Jordan for Ellen isn’t exactly a fair trade but I guess it’s better than taking the new guy out. Jordan hasn’t been here for very long either but he saw more in his first week than I saw in my first year, so he feels like a seasoned veteran like the rest of us, and by the rest of us I mean Ellen, Phil, and myself. 

Jordan’s got this kind of look about him. I’ve seen a similar look in my grandpa’s eyes, he operated a flamethrower in Nam. 

“I’ll bet anything those guys are out on the island.” I was met with a shudder from Jordan. No idea what happened to him out there but his whole demeanor changed, and this is a demeanor that is usually on edge, but now he just kind of shrank into himself. 

The Fog had moved back into the Swamps a day or two ago so the lake was perfectly clear. A few hundred yards out I could already see the fishing boat on the island. We pulled up and dropped anchor. Jordan and I stepped ashore and quickly a strange scene began to unfold before us. 

The boat was destroyed. There was a massive hole in the side, as if a log or something else had gone right through it. In the boat was about a foot of standing water. There were two fishing poles snapped in half, and we could see a trail in the sand leading into the woods just a few yards away. 

Jordan and I followed this trail for a few yards before we came across the remains of the fisherman’s camp. There was a pile of coals where they had made a fire, and a relatively small shelter that they had made from fallen trees and pine branches. 

Inside the small shelter I found a little journal, leatherbound with those pages that aren’t cut flush with the edge of the book. Every single page was full of writing. The first twenty five or thirty pages were full of records of fish that had been caught. 

Thursday, May 20, 2020, Largemouth, 6lbs, Channel Cat, 12lbs, 12 Crappie all about 2 lbs.

It went on like that for pages and pages all the way up to this year. Then it started getting weird. 

Thursday March 27, 2025. Richard L. Hornberry State Park. Foggy.

“Dale caught a strange looking fish after about twenty minutes on the water. It only had one eye and it was on top of its head. It looked like it might have been a catfish but it was hard to tell. It had skin not scales, but not catfish skin, it felt kind of human. It grossed Dale and I out so much that we just cut the line and tied on a new lure.”

“A little while later. The wind has picked up quite a bit, the water is getting really choppy, we’ve been looking for a little cove or something to get out of it. Fog making navigation difficult.”

“Something slapped the side of the boat. Dale is confident it was a tentacle. He’s becoming more and more erratic.”

“Dale is inconsolable. He’s sitting at the back of the boat, knees tucked up to his chest, arms around them, rocking back and forth and muttering things.” 

“Dale’s muttering isn’t just gibberish, I’ve begun to notice that he will repeat phrases, but they aren’t in english or any language I’ve ever heard. I can just tell that there’s some kind of pattern. I’ll do my best to recreate the speech phonetically but I don’t know if it will come close

G’nagh Ma’taga, R’ahwn Mu’shuaun, Al’am phatagan. 

That’s what it sounds like at least. He’s been repeating that for the better part of an hour.”

“Something hit the side of the boat again. There’s a giant hole in the side now and the wind is flushing water through it with some ferocity. I need to find land fast, Dale is no help, still rocking, still muttering.” 

“Heard singing. Like a beautiful woman. It didn’t sound like words, but more just like a hum. If there were words, they belong to the same language as Dale’s muttering.”

“Fog is too thick to navigate. Decided to follow the singing. Didn’t see the land until we crashed into it. As soon as we landed Dale quit muttering. Still unresponsive though.”

“We’ve landed on an island. I walked the perimeter and we are surrounded on all sides by water and fog. When I got back to the boat I couldn’t find Dale. A short search revealed that he had made a camp. Some kind of primitive structure. It was getting dark. I made a fire, and tried to talk to Dale. Still nothing.”

Friday, March 28, 2025

“Woke early. Couldn’t find Dale in the camp. Walked to the shore and found him fishing. Tried to talk to him, it was as if he never heard me. The fog is still as thick as ever. Going to try to fix the boat. There is no phone signal here.”

“Fixing the boat is hopeless without a hammer and nails. Boat will sink if taken out. I fear we may be trapped here for a while.”

“A storm has started. It began with rain and has progressed from there. The wind that found us on the lake yesterday continued through the night and is beginning to push the rain sideways. Thunder rolls overhead. 

“The singing is back.”

Saturday, March 29, 2025

“Dale won’t stop fishing. Something snapped his pole yesterday, and I watched as he picked up my pole and began fishing again. I can hear him muttering even from the camp. I am confined to this shelter while I write. The pine branches used as a roof are remarkably waterproof, and fire, somehow, has not yet gone out, despite the rain.”

“The singing won’t stop. It sounds like the voice of a beautiful woman. I searched the Island for hours, trying to find the source. Though the storm ravages the island, I feel a sense of calm, just at the sound of the voice.”

Saturday, April 5, 2025

“A week on the island and no one has come for us. The storm remains, and only gains ferocity by the day. I worry for Dale. Something snapped our last fishing pole. Now he just stands at the shore, muttering in that strange and unearthly tongue. I have grown to feel that the Island is humming, emanating some kind of sound. The woman still sings, and I have grown weary of eating berries.”
	
Monday, April 7

“I have eaten my fill of bark. I have grown weary of this storm. It seems to have no end. A flock of crows has nested above our camp. They speak names, names I have not heard before.”

Thursday, April 10

“The crows said ‘Dale.’ I got up and ran to the lake. I could not find Dale.”

“A horrid shadow appeared out of the storm, rising from the lake, too large even to comprehend, though I thought it had a shape, a terrible shape, a ghastly form.”

April ?

“I stood on the shore and looked and I saw, rising from the waters, a beast. Ghastly green and fleshy, I saw seven arms, and on each of the seven arms were twelve pulsing suckers. On the beast's head was an eye like obsidian. One horrid glance was all I saw. The beast sank back into the depths creating a great whirlpool as he did so. I ran back to the shelter, laughing and screaming into the wind and rain.”

May ?

“The voice, that beautiful singing, it called my name, and at once so too did all of the crows. They are all coming from the shore, near the boat. I must go, I must see what they want.”

“Pssh, yeah right.” I said handing the journal over to Jordan. There were quite a few pages I skipped over. Not that they had any information on them. Just random scribbling that went crazy all over the page. Just the word, May, written over and over again for pages and pages.

I stood and waited for Jordan to read through it. I heard his teeth begin to chatter. 

“Oh my God.” He said. 

“Come on. Those guys were high or something. It’s still March Jordan, those dates go up to May of this year. The guy’s were delusional. It hasn’t stormed here in at least a week or so. Probably killed each other or something. Let’s look around the Island and see if we can find them. If not they probably drowned themselves and there’s really nothing we can do.” 

There sure was nothing we could do. We found a few things, mainly just trees completely stripped of bark at their base. A few of them had the word “May” carved into them. Jordan and I went back to the office and gave Phil the journal we found. He promptly locked it away in a drawer under his desk that we all collectively refer to as “The Drawer,” and then we went about the rest of our day. 

Monday morning three or four black SUVs rolled into the park, and went straight to Phil’s office. Five or so men in suits and sunglasses walked into the office and came out carrying a briefcase. This kind of thing happens about once a month. It’s just par for the course here at Richard L. Hornberry, we don’t ask questions, especially if we really don’t want to know the answers to them.

Until next time

James.
