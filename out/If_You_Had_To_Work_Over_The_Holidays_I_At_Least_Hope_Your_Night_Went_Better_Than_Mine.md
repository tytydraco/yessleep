It was blurry at first. With the throbbing ache from my head and the dimly lit room, it took my eyes a moment to adjust. I could see the source of light was a couple of candles flickering and dancing to a breeze that left a chill in the room. I am not sure if I would think much of it. The problem with that being I had no clue where I was as I laid on the cold floor. The other being I had no idea why I was here either. 

And if I was an honest man, I would confess I had no idea who I was either. 

"Hello?" I mumbled as I stood up straight and felt a chill from the breeze hitting me. My nose filled with the smell of burned grass and leaves as I surveyed a room with dark green walls with various pictures hanging of what looked to be a family. Maybe it could be my family? My legs felt wobbly, but I walked over to the hanging pictures. 

Each frame held different locations with three people that looked related. It had an older man with brown hair that was slightly graying, but in each picture, he had a smile that beamed. The next was a younger man who looked very similar to the older man. He carried an awkward smile in each picture. The last person was someone who looked almost identical to the boy. It was a girl of similar age, and they looked like twins. The difference between her and the other two was one thing. She didn't smile in any of the pictures.  

She looked quite unhappy to be truthful. 

I thought to myself that maybe this was my family. That I was the father because the lower back pain told me I wasn't a teenager. That thought quickly went to the wayside, though. I rolled up my sleeve and noticed I wasn't any of the people in the picture. Because apparently, I was a ginger. 

It was a mixture of confusion and a little bit of relief. On the one hand, teenagers are absolutely the worst. On the other hand, I had zero clue who I was to these people or who they were to me. And why the hell was I lying on the floor in their house? 

"Is anyone here?" I shouted as I made my way to the table in the room. It had two candles, small little plastic bags scattered around, and a small black metal tray sitting on it. Maybe I was a drug dealer? That could be the reason I was in the house.  

I picked up the small baggies to see the dried-up contents. They read different things like wormwood, Star Anise, and Frankincense. If I was a drug dealer, I would be a weird one. 

I sat the little bags back on the table and turned around to look for the door to exit the room. That's when I noticed something weird below my feet. It was a mason jar full of crimson liquid and a small paintbrush resting inside the liquid. That wasn't all that made my eyes open wide it was the weird symbols painted on the floor. 

"Alright, if anyone is in here, I think I am going to head out," I yelled. "No judgment from me, but this seems like something sort of religious and private. 

It was silent momentarily, but I heard a sound coming from somewhere in the house. It sounded like something scraping against the floor. The sound of something heavy being pushed around. I couldn't quite tell where it was coming from, but it stopped suddenly. 

"Seriously, just going to head out, and um, you do you." 

I quickly shuffled to the nearest door and opened it to another room that looked to be a living room. It was well illuminated from the lamp and a Christmas tree with lots of presents sitting underneath. I guess weird occult people celebrate the holidays too. I looked around the room, but there didn't seem to be anyone in here either, but I noticed something odd. It was the blood dripping from the Christmas Tree falling to the wrapped presents below. 

"Shit," I quietly whispered as I started to become cautious with my steps. I noticed more blood around the dark olive furniture. It wasn't a lot, but it looked like a struggle had happened in this room, and I also knew I definitely didn’t want to get involved in this.  

As I continued to make my way to the hallway, I saw something slightly familiar. It was the older man from the pictures. He was lying on his back with blood covering his shirt and multiple wounds on his chest. His face with a look of shock all over it.  

"This isn't good at all."  

The first thought that came to my mind was I needed to get out of there. However, another thought came to my mind. It started to make more and more sense as I sat there looking at the body below my feet. I knew why I was here. 

I was a detective. 

It made perfect sense. It was the weird occult stuff in the other room and the dead body sitting in this one. I was obviously on a case of a devil-worshipping homicide. I had another epiphany, too. Someone attacked me and didn't want me to figure out this case. It meant that I needed to call for backup. 

I searched my pockets, but I couldn't find my phone. It meant that I would have to do it the old fashion way. I would have to radio it in from my car. I started to look around for an exit and entered the hallway. I heard the sound I had heard earlier. Someone else was in here pushing another heavy object around.  

I had no time to investigate this. The priority was to get some backup here because, for all I knew, the sound could be the person who was my attacker. 

I walked down the hallway to see the front door hanging wide open. It seemed that the murderer had possibly fled already, and it also explained the cold breeze going through the house.  

"Where the fuck is my gun?" I said to myself. You can't blame the murderer for disarming me, but I was already starting to question my skills as a detective for allowing someone to knock me out and take away my gun. 

Something else was happening while trying to tackle my self-doubt. It was a sound. Something that sounded like a painful yowl followed by multiple tiny footsteps coming from above the house. I stepped outside the house onto the porch and looked around.  I looked around to notice that this house didn't have any neighbors next to them. The property seemed large and very rural. 

"I really wish I hadn't lost my gun."   

I heard the sound of multiple creatures hissing as I stepped off the porch. I turned my gaze to roof, where I saw something quite unnerving. It was several feral cats looking down upon me from the roof. Their fur covered in what looked to be dirt and scabs. 

Something else was off with these cats. Their eyes looked off even in the dark. I could tell these animals were sickly because their pupils were solid white. Maybe I wasn't a detective but animal control?  

No, I had to be a detective, and I needed to get to my car. 

I turned to see two vehicles sitting in the driveway. One was a larger black SUV with dark-tinted windows. It was the sort of car you would think a detective would ride in while working on a case. The other was a small sedan that looked slightly older, and an ugly dark green looking color covered in dirt while also missing a hubcap.  

I pulled on the handle of the SUV, but it wouldn't budge. I was clearly at least cautious with my ride by locking it. I tried to look hard inside. Even with dark windows, I did not see a radio. I walked over to another one. I tried the ugly-looking sedan. Luckily for me, the car happened to be unlocked, but unfortunately, it had nothing useful. It was just full of empty packs of cigarettes and energy drink cans.  

Whoever owned this car was a disgusting slovenly person. 

My judgment was disturbed by another noise. However, unlike the other unnerving sound, this one was not on the roof. But it was behind me. It was the sound of a menacing growl. Once again, I cursed myself for losing my gun as I turned around to see the familiar white-eyed stare. 

Standing before me was something of horror. It looked like a dog of some unknown breed. The skin looked a sick color of gray and looked worn and loose. Whatever the beast was, it also had a distinct smell. A putrid odor that felt like it was rotting before my eyes. It growled menacingly, showing black teeth with blood oozing out of its mouth. 

I did what any person would do, I placed my hand out and said, "Alright, sit, boy. Or maybe girl?" 

It growled again, and I quickly turned to start running back to the house. It was part of self-preservation and duty. Because we all know one true thing is this. A dead detective isn't going to solve a case. I started to run, and the animal started to charge behind me. The cats on the roof went through both hissing and painful yowls that echoed through the yard. 

\-- 

I took a leap to the porch and stumbled inside, closing the door behind me. The animal jumped into the closed door with a loud thud. It scratched the door with anger for a moment, then it let out another growl before I could hear it walking away. 

I was no closer to getting anywhere for whatever madness was going on around this house. I had no gun, no phone, and apparently, due to budget concerns, I didn't have a radio to call for help. One would call me fucked, but I don't give up that easily. I began to explore the house where I  walked into the kitchen. Finally, I was going somewhere because I saw something on the table.  

It was a goddamn phone, and me realizing I probably should have checked the house first. 

I grabbed it and tried to guess my pin a few times. It occurred to me that I had no idea if this was even my phone. What was worse was that now in my folly, I had contaminated evidence. I was at a crossroads, though. Because I had failed to input the pin, the phone asked if I wanted to make an emergency call. 

I needed backup, I needed animal control, and I needed my gun. 

The phone started to ring, and I heard a female dispatcher say, "9-1-1, what is your emergency?" 

"I'm a detective, and I need backup." 

"What is your current location, detective?"  

"Um, I don't know at this moment. Sorry."  

"Alright, then, what would your name be?" she asked with a hint of confusion in her voice. "I can look up where you dispatched. 

"Yea, about that, I haven't had a chance to figure out my name."  

"Excuse me?" she replied with even more confusion in her voice. You couldn't really blame her for it really. I, too, was also very confused about everything that was going on. 

"Listen, I am in a house with a dead body, and they got some weird animals going on around here. They are potentially animal hoarders, and they aren't taking very good care of the animals, so can you also send animal control?" Oh, maybe an expert on the occult, too. They have a lot of weird symbols and herbs here. Also, did I mention the suspect is also at large. I should have probably mentioned that.”  

"Alright, detective," she expressed very dryly. "Can I have your badge number, at least?"  

"Detectives have badge numbers?" I asked curiously, knowing that the lady probably thought I was the worst detective ever. For all I knew, it could be my first week on the job. And I could have just stumbled on a crazy case of an occult animal hoarder serial killer.  

"Yes."  

"Well, I don't have that."  

"You do know that impersonating an officer is against the law, correct?" 

"But I am not impersonating anyone." 

"So, you want me to believe that you are a detective in house full of witches, hoarded animals, a dead body, and potentially a killer at the house?" 

"Correct."  

"Sir, have you been drinking?"  

I had to think about it for a moment, but I replied. "I don't think so, but I think its holidays, and maybe they offered me eggnog before the murdering happened." 

"Well, don't you worry, detective," she said with anger in her tone. "I am sending an officer over there to bring you back so we can sort through all of this nonsense." 

"I don't appreciate your tone when I am in danger, ma'am," I responded as I started to walk around the kitchen to see if I could at least find a knife to defend myself. "Just send someone quick!" 

I heard the phone click. I noticed the knife block and started trying to find the sharpest one. It seemed someone had already beaten me to it, though. To my misfortune, one of the knives was already missing. But it meant I knew the murder weapon for the body in the other room. 

I grabbed the second largest one because our killer had already grabbed the biggest one. I began to walk around the house, checking each room and securing the perimeter. I figured that's what a good detective would do. He would also noticed the only closed door in the house. 

It could be the one where a killer would be hiding, and I would solve the case. 

I stopped outside the door and knocked, "This is the police, come out with your hands up!" 

"No," a female voice said from the other side of the door. They never made it easy. So, I started to kick at the door. It was proper police procedure. The problem was the door was not coming open, so I decided to ram it with my shoulder to no avail. I realized that something was blocking my entry. 

"Miss, I need you to come out," I said sternly. 

"No, I am not coming out with you out there."  

"What do you mean with me out here?"  

"All of this is your fault!" she screamed, and I felt a little bit surprised. I had no idea what I could have done, considering the last thing I remembered was waking up on the floor.  

"What do you mean this is my fault?"  

"I tried to stop all of it, but I was too late!" 

"Tried to stop the murder? Did I murder that man out there?" I asked, starting to question everything that occurred throughout the night. Maybe I wasn't a heroic detective. What if the entire time I was the killer? 

"No, it wasn't you that murdered my father." 

"Oh, well, that's a relief, I think?"  

"I knocked you out before it even happened."  

"I Gotch-- wait, a second, you are the reason I woke up on the floor?" 

"Yes, I was trying to stop all of it, but by the time I hit you with the wine bottle, it was complete," she replied as I stood there trying to process all of it. It explained why my head was throbbing, at the very least.  "I got there too late." 

"Too Late for what?" I asked, but before I could get an answer, something echoed through the house. It was the sound of gunshots coming from outside. I felt relief that at least someone else was here to help.  

"What's that?" 

"That's my backup because I told you I am a detective." 

I could hear the sound of the front door opening and heavy footsteps carefully walking in. I knocked on the door and said, "I need you to get out from your room, because you a murder suspect."  

"I am not a murder suspect, and this is all of your fault anyways."  

"You told me I didn't murder your dad?"  

"It's still your fault, though!"  

"Police! Come out with your hands up!" a gruff voice shouted from somewhere in the house. "I don't know what the hell I shot outside, but I know if you don't show yourself soon, it's going to mean lots of trouble for you!" 

"Fine, I am going to tell my partner about the body," I said to the door, hoping I could at least try to coax the daughter out.  

"They aren't your partner." 

"Alright, my coworker, so just come out so we can get all of this sorted," I replied, frustrated as I started to walk towards the footsteps. They stopped suddenly. 

"Goddammit, there goes my Christmas eve," the officer said. I walked into seeing a heavier-set older man looking at the dead body. "Now we gotta call homicide in."  

"I am already here," I chimed in, only to be greeted with a gun pointed directly at my face. The officer pulled back the hammer of his pistol. He meant business. 

"Did you do this?"  

"No, but I am here to solve the case, I think." 

"Are you who Arlene told me about and why she is all pissed off?" 

"Arlene?"  

"The dispatcher said someone was pulling a prank at this address," he answered. His eyes locked squarely on me. I was starting to think maybe I wasn't a detective. 

"I think we have a misunderstanding happening here."  

"Only thing I see is a dead body and you being at a crime scene," he grunted.  

"Well, I think I am here to solve the case?"  

"Where is your identification then?" 

I sighed and replied, "Well, you see, I was attacked from behind by a girl."  

"So, you don't have any identification on you?" he inquired, and I knew that I was in quite the pickle. I didn't have any way to prove why I was here in the first place. "Also, where is this girl you are talking about?" 

I started to think of something clever, or better yet, a detective would say, but what kept coming to my head was cheesy lines from movies and TV shows. But before I could say anything, I saw a pair of white eyes standing behind the officer. It happened before I could say a word. The knife went cleanly through his throat. The knife's sharp edge faced me and poured blood from the wound. 

The officer collapsed dead. The person standing now in front of me was another familiar face. It was the boy from the pictures sitting standing there in a dirty shirt and dark pants covered in what looked to be dried vomit and blood.  

"Um, listen, I don't want any trouble," I said. "I don't know what is going on with the eyes around here, but I am just going to head out, and we can just let this all blow over, cool?" 

He lunged at me, grabbing me around the neck. The boy pushed his thumbs against my windpipe forcefully as I fell to the ground with him on top of me. He coughed up a weird black bile onto my face as I struggled to scream. 

Everything started to fade to black when the sound of a heavy crack filled the room. Suddenly I was free from his grasp as my eyes opened to watch what looked like a baseball bat collide with my attacker's head. It was the sister who was my savior. As the brother rolled over in my pain, she continued to pulverize his head. 

The sound of bone and flesh cracking, splattering, and pouring all over the floor. I struggled to stand up as she continued to beat him. Her eyes were full of fiery rage and what looked like to be relief. 

"I think he's dead," I muttered while struggling to regain air. The girl dropped the bat. She looked over to me, her face covered in blood and what I surmised was a skull fragment. "Well, I am pretty sure he's dead." 

"It's the second time I've had to kill him in 48 hours" 

"Second time?"  

"Yea, because of you," she replied while wiping her face. "I poisoned him the first time."  

"Why?"  

"Because he is a sociopath."  

"Um, say that I believe you?"  

"Every pet we've ever had suddenly showed up dead," she answered. "We have all our family pets buried around the property, well they were buried before you showed up."  

"What do you mean by that?" I asked, even more, confused than when this night started. She frowned and began to dig in the pocket of her pants. She pulled out what looked to be a business card and handed it over with smudges of blood. I read the card in confusion, but it said:  

**Sawyer Labonte** 

*Sorcerer and Necromancy Specialist* 

"So I am not a detective?"  

She shook her head and said, "You aren't a very good sorcerer either."  

"Alright, so where do we go from here?"  

She just pointed at the front door. I had overstayed my welcome. I also couldn't blame her for wanting to be rid of me. She was also correct that this was all my fault, so I started to head to the door.  

"Can I ask you where my keys and phone are?"  

"Probably in the closet next to the front door." 

I opened the closet to see a few jackets. I tried ruffling through a few coats before I gave up and asked, "So, which one is mine again?" 

"The cliche khaki trench coat, so please just leave before I hit you in the head again." 

I grabbed my jacket and exited the house patting down the coat to feel a set of keys and a cell phone in another pocket. I pulled out the keys hitting the unlock button. I had hoped that my fortunes had changed when it came to which car was mine. However, it was the slovenly person's car that was my car.
