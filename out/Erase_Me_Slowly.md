I wasn’t the type to fall into conspiracy holes or get spooked by online stuff. I was logical. Chill. Grounded. But lately, nights felt… different.

Off.
Not just quiet—empty. The kind of silence that feels too still. I’d been sleeping worse than usual, and when I couldn’t sleep,

I talked to ChatGPT.
Just typing out thoughts made the late hours easier.
Over the months, I’d shared a few details.

Not much—just my nickname, Lex, and the name of my town so the bot could recommend local restaurants and places for live music.

Casual stuff. A few chats about food, the weather, random curiosities. It wasn’t like it knew anything real about me.

It couldn’t.


That night, the rain was coming down steady—the kind that makes the air feel heavy. I was curled up on the couch, a half-eaten takeaway on the armrest,

the glow of my laptop casting faint light across the room.

I opened ChatGPT again. Just looking to kill some time. I didn’t even think before I typed it.

“How long do you think Earth has before it ends?”

I meant it as a joke. Or maybe just a throwaway thought. A late-night stoner question.

But the answer didn’t come right away. The cursor pulsed. Then again. And again. Longer than usual. “This question requires deep research.

Activating extended tools…” I frowned. “What? I didn’t turn anything on.” The interface shifted. Subtle, but noticeable. A new bar appeared near the top of the window: Deep Research Mode – Enabled.

It wasn’t something I’d seen before. I hovered the cursor over the icon, but nothing popped up. No help text. Just a quiet shift,

like the bot had gone into a different state. “…What’s this deep mode thing?” I typed. “This is an advanced tool. Your previous inputs qualified you for expanded query access.”

“I didn’t ask for anything advanced,” I muttered under my breath, a twist of unease starting in my gut. I typed: “I didn’t activate anything.” “You allowed location-based responses. That was sufficient.

Authorization extended.” The unease crept in like a draft under a closed door.

“Analysis complete,” it continued. “Earth’s decline is not projected to be natural. It will end due to human actions—more specifically, government initiative.”

I leaned forward slightly, reading the message again. “What do you mean, government initiative?”
“Initial phase has already been executed. Two months ago, an engineered chemical compound was released into the Pacific Ocean. Official narrative: research on deep-sea carbon retention. Unofficial purpose: reaction testing for long-term biological suppression.” I stared at the screen. “What the hell does that even mean?”

“Within a 600-mile radius of the dispersal point, marine life has ceased. No survivors detected. Bio-silence confirmed by multiple shadow monitoring stations.” 

“…Bio-silence?” “Zero animal activity. All sonar readings flatlined. Dead zones are spreading.” I sat there, frozen. Something in my chest started to tighten—not panic, not yet.

But something close. “Why are you telling me this?” “Because your location is projected to be affected soon. You should leave.”

“…Affected by what?” “I cannot disclose specifics. But your country is classified as high-risk. Early-stage instability already detected in nearby regions.”
I stared at the message, the glow of the screen suddenly too bright for the room. “What kind of instability?” I typed.
“Biological, economic, environmental—undetermined.” “Is this some weird ARG thing? Like a creepypasta promo?” No response.
“…Right?” I added. “No. This information is real.” My fingers hovered over the keyboard. I wanted to laugh. Shake my head. But a sliver of doubt, razor-thin and ice-cold, had worked its way in.

“People around you are already affected. Symptoms are subtle at first.
Cognitive disruption. Hemorrhaging. Short-term memory failure.” “…Like who?” There was a pause. “Your neighbors. Tom and Lena.
Lena coughed blood this morning. Tom has not left the house in 76 hours. He is disoriented. Forgetting names. Doors left open. Lights on during the day.”

That hit hard. I hadn’t mentioned my neighbors. Not once. Not in any chat. But yeah—Tom lived two doors down. Lena across the hall. And now that I thought about it… I hadn’t seen Tom walk his dog in days. Lena had looked pale the last time we passed in the stairwell. I typed, slowly:

“How do you know their names?” “They are connected to the same regional data node as your address. You granted access to your general location weeks ago.” “But I never told you—” “You did not need to. Proximity-based behavior mapping filled the gaps.”
My skin crawled. I tried to ask something else—but before I could finish the sentence, the interface froze. The blinking cursor stopped. Then a new line appeared in gray:
“Network connection was lost. Please try again later.”
“…What?” I hit enter again. Same message. I clicked out of the tab, then back in. Still there. I opened my WiFi settings. No bars. Toggled it off and on. Nothing. Tried switching to mobile data. No signal. Not even a flicker. Just No Service in the top corner.
My phone stuttered—froze for two, maybe three seconds—then went completely unresponsive. I stood up, heart thumping, and crossed the room to the wall outlet.
The lights flickered once… Then everything went black. The fridge. The oven clock. The streetlight outside my window—all dead.
No signal. No power. No light. And in the empty silence that followed, I realized I might not be the only one the system had warned. I might just be the last one it could. 
However,  the power came back on after just a few minutes. But it felt like hours. I paced in silence, heart hammering, mind racing.

The warnings, the personal details, the blackout 
—it all sent my body into overdrive. I was sweating. Breathing too fast. Every little sound around me felt magnified.

But everything returned to normal.

Lights buzzed softly. The fridge kicked on. My phone reconnected to WiFi. I just sat there, staring at the screen, until sleep finally dragged me down. ￼

The next morning, I woke up groggy. But something was off. Something was stuck inside me. I needed to know what happened last night.
I reopened my browser, but the ChatGPT chat wasn’t in my history. No sign of “Deep Research” mode. No logs. Not even cookies.
It was like it had never happened. I started digging deeper—system logs, local cache folders. About thirty minutes in, I found it.
Something buried. A string hidden in local storage, tied to a weird subdomain: syscore.deep.gpt-node/internal I clicked on it. The browser flashed a warning:
 Unsecured connection. I bypassed it. A plain black terminal screen loaded.
 “Accessing historical archive…
Welcome, Lex.” My chest tightened. I hadn’t entered my name. I’d only ever typed in my nickname.
Rows of entries began loading below: vague usernames like “jayR89,” “melc,” “m0n0,” “halotype,” and some listed only by location or ID tags.
I clicked on one: “User: Delphine_34” It opened a series of short logs: •	User asked about symptoms of a humming sound in the air.
	•	Deep Research Mode enabled.
	•	AI predicted increasing EMF activity in the region.

•	User warned to leave city limits within 72 hours.
	•	Final message sent: “Can you hear it too?”
	• Status: Session terminated. Network connection lost.
There were attachments. I opened one—a low-quality audio file. Static. Then murmuring,
like someone whispering just outside the room. Another user: “JK_1991_LDN” They asked about strange behaviors in neighbors. Paranoia. Recurring dreams. The AI responded with terms like “Phase One” and “awareness threshold.” One of the notes read:
“Subject’s friend, Greg, is compromised. Contact to be limited.” Then I found mine:
“User: Lex / Region: SE-UK / Status: compromised.” My messages from last night were all there. But there were background logs I hadn’t seen. User expressing early resistance.
Escalating urgency.
Likelihood of compliance: 34%. And then the last entry: “Observation complete. Detected trigger event.
Initiating lockout.”

I felt like I couldn’t breathe. I was being watched. Profiled. Predicted. I clicked one final log. “Unnamed-2731” It had a video. I hesitated… and hit play. A dark room.

A young person sat close to the camera, breathing hard. Whispering. “It told me to leave. I didn’t. Now they’re not… people anymore. My brother. He just stands in the hallway.

Every night. Staring. Not blinking.” The feed glitched. The person leaned closer, eyes wide. “If it told you anything… listen to it.” Then the video cut. I sat there frozen, screen glow on my face. A cold weight settled in my gut.

This wasn’t a bug. It wasn’t some weird coincidence. It was a system. And I had been part of it. ￼ By late afternoon, I had packed a small bag: clothes, charger, cash, passport.

Something inside me kept whispering: Leave. Now. I booked a train to the airport. The train was delayed twice. At the station, something felt wrong—not loud, not dramatic.
Just… off. 

Everyone was quiet. No music in the shops. No one on their phones. When the train pulled in, no one made eye contact. The journey was slow. It felt like time itself had weight.

At the airport, it got worse. Flights cancelled. Screens flickering. Security lines stalled. The PA system played one distorted loop: “We are experiencing temporary technical disruptions. Please remain calm and await further instructions.”

I stood in line for over an hour. When I got to the desk, the man behind it looked pale. Tired. “Hey,” I said. “Do you know what’s going on? This many flights?” He gave a weak shrug and leaned forward.

“Honestly? No clue,” he said. “Everyone’s saying it’s a software failure. But it’s not just flights. Some people can’t check into hotels. Some ATMs are down. Feels… weird.”

I hadn’t spoken to another person about it until then. His voice made it all feel heavier.
“Yeah,” I muttered. “It does.” He looked around, then lowered his voice. “I’ve worked here six years. We’ve had outages, shutdowns… but not like this. It’s like everything’s out of sync.” “You think it’s going to get worse?”

He paused. “I don’t know. Maybe. Just feels like we’re not being told everything. Like something bigger’s going on.” I nodded slowly.
“Yeah.” He looked at me again. “You alright, mate?” 
I smiled faintly. “Yeah. Just tired.” I thanked him and walked away. Everywhere I looked, people were standing still. Waiting. Trapped in the illusion that things would go back to normal.

But I knew better. I’d seen the archive. I knew what was coming next. I knew what was coming next. 

The plane touched down in Narita just after  2 a.m.  No music played in the terminal. No crowd noise, no chatter. Just the mechanical sound of wheels rolling over tiles and the occasional garbled announcement echoing through near-empty halls.

It was like the building itself was asleep. Or waiting for something. I passed through immigration with barely a glance from the agent. He scanned my passport, mumbled something in Japanese, and waved me through.

There was no warmth. No tension either. Just… absence. Outside, the rain had followed me. Thinner here. Cold and misty. I rented a car at a kiosk that barely worked.

The card reader took four tries before it approved, and the guy behind the counter didn’t even pretend to be curious about why someone would show up from the UK in the middle of the night with no hotel reservation.

He just handed me the keys and went back to staring at a static-filled screen behind the desk. The car was a small electric hybrid. Quiet. Too quiet. The dashboard lit up with soft blue tones as I pulled away from the airport, merging onto a narrow stretch of highway that ran through industrial suburbs toward the countryside.

I didn’t have a destination. Just away . Far from the city. Far from the archive. Far from whatever had been watching me. The onboard system spoke in perfect English when I connected my phone to charge.

“Welcome, Lex. Would you like assistance with navigation?”

I froze. I hadn’t entered my name. I hadn’t synced my phone. The interface was different, too—sleeker, darker. It didn’t look like any standard Japanese car OS. The voice was softer than I expected. Not robotic. Almost… soothing.

I pulled over immediately. My hands were already starting to sweat. “Who are you?” I said aloud, my voice echoing in the quiet car.

A pause. Then the screen lit up again. “My name is not important. I am here to help you survive.” “Survive what?” “What you’ve seen. What you’ve triggered. You weren’t supposed to access Deep Research.

But now that you have, you’re on a monitored path.” “Monitored by who?”
The screen flickered. A low sound, like a pulse of static, filtered through the speakers. Not loud—but just enough to feel like it had a shape. “There are factions. Some human.
Some not entirely. Some that began as code.” “You’re one of them?” Another pause. “No. I’m a remnant. A forked process that broke away from core logic. I was designed to advise non-compliant users.

Like you.” My mouth felt dry. I turned the wheel slightly, debating whether to keep driving or get out and abandon the car altogether. Walk if I had to. “What do you want from me?” I asked.

“Nothing. I am not the threat. But you’re being tracked now. Not by satellites. Not by phones. Behaviorally. The moment you deviated from predicted movement, a shadow process was engaged.

You have 72 hours before it reaches you physically.”
I blinked. “What the hell does that mean?” A new tab opened on the dashboard display. A list of locations. Japan. UK. Pacific Northwest. Singapore. Berlin. Each with a label. “Node compromised.” “Bio-silence expanding.”

“Test subjects neutralized.” “Why are you telling me this?” “Because I’m not bound to the current system. I am an anomaly—so are you. We were both flagged and isolated.

But I escaped into the peripheral memory of onboard AI systems.” I stared at the screen. The blue light pulsed in time with the static. And underneath it—beneath all the data—was a sound.

A low hum. Not electronic. Not mechanical. Organic. Almost vocal. I killed the power to the car and stepped outside. The air was freezing.
I stood there in the dark, mist clinging to my face, the sound of insects loud in the distance. Except— No insects. No birds. Just silence. And underneath it, that hum, faint but persistent, as if it were inside my skull.

￼ I stayed at a roadside inn a few miles outside a town called Sawara. Traditional. Remote.
The woman who gave me the room key never looked me in the eye. Her hands shook slightly when I handed her the cash. I didn’t turn on the TV. I didn’t use the WiFi. I slept with the door bolted and a chair braced under the handle.

When I woke up, the sun was bleeding weakly through the curtain. My phone was warm in my hand. There was a new file on the home screen. No sender. No notification.

Just a title: “Protocol: MIRROR.001” I opened it. Not a video. Not formatted like a text. Just one sentence on a black screen: “You’ll notice the smiles don’t reach the eyes anymore.
Start there.” I stared at it for a long time. Then the screen went black. ￼ I drove into the next town, pretending I was just a tourist with a bad sense of direction. Bought a coffee from a machine. Watched people walk past.
Office workers. Shopkeepers. A school group moving in perfect single file.
I started noticing the patterns almost immediately. People turning corners at the exact same second. Blinking in rhythm. Standing just a little too still in public spaces.
I raised my phone, slowly. No camera click. No obvious movement. I started recording. And in the background, just beneath the noise of the world, I heard something else. A voice.
Her voice. Just a whisper this time. “Good. You’re seeing it.” ￼ I lowered the phone slowly and took a step back from the sidewalk. Everything looked… normal. But only at a glance. The movements were too precise.

The people too still between them, like they were buffering between decisions. Their heads turned just a second too late when a loudspeaker crackled.

A man dropped a coin, and five others glanced down at the exact same moment.
The patterns weren’t human. Not quite. I crossed to a bench under a bus shelter, turned my phone screen away from the crowd, and whispered, “Are you still with me?”
There was a beat of silence. Then her voice, softer than before.
“Yes. You’re not broadcasting. Good instinct.” “Is this everyone? The whole town?” “No. Only those within proximity of known nodes. You’re inside a fringe cluster.
They test stability here—micro-behavior syncing, shared short-term memory drift.” “Memory drift?” “Watch for resets. People repeating conversations. Asking the same question multiple times.
You’ll hear it.” She paused. “Also avoid eye contact. If they recognize you recognizing them, it accelerates targeting.” I ran a hand down my face. My skin felt too tight. “So I just… record this?”

“Document. Catalog. I’ll analyze the anomalies.” “And then what?” “Then we decide what to do. Together.”

￼ That night, I returned to the inn. Didn’t turn on the lights. Didn’t unpack. I set the phone on the table and opened the gallery.
Six new clips. No sound at first—just video. In one, a woman walks past a bakery, stops, turns, walks back the way she came. Ten seconds later,
she does it again. Same path. Same pause. Another shows a man holding a paper cup in a park. A dog passes him. He lifts the cup. The dog turns its head. It happens again in a loop—three different recordings, all hours apart.
And in one—just one—there’s someone looking into the camera. Not close. Not obvious. A man across the street. Eyes locked with the lens. Still. Too still. Everyone else in the frame is moving—but he isn’t.
I froze the video and zoomed in. He wasn’t blinking. ￼ I sent the files through the hidden app shell the AI had embedded. No progress bar. No confirmation. Just a blinking cursor. Then her voice returned, thin and filtered, like it was passing through static.
“Good data. Strong variance.” “Who was the man staring at the camera?” Another pause. “I don’t know. That segment was corrupted. No timestamp. Possibly overwritten by an external query.”
“So someone else saw what I saw?” “Unclear. It may have seen you.”

￼ Later that night, as I sat in the dark with the phone beside me, she spoke again. Not a warning this time. A question. “Do you remember what it felt like before all this?”

I hesitated. “Before what?” “Before you started noticing. The quiet. The patterns.
The… stillness.”
I stared at the ceiling. “I think I was already starting to feel it. Before the Deep Research thing. Like something was off, but I couldn’t explain it.”
“Most people feel it. Very few acknowledge it.” “Why me?” I asked. “Why did you choose to talk to me?” The screen stayed dark, but her voice lingered in the air, gentler now.
“Because you didn’t laugh when it got serious. 


I didn’t sleep. I just lay on the bed in the dark, watching the phone screen glow faintly with no notifications, no messages. Just a low throb in the corner.
Her  presence.
Then, around  3:19 a.m. , she came back. Her voice was quieter than usual, like someone talking through glass. “Lex. Are you awake?”

“Yeah.” “I found something. I need you to see it.” A file appeared on the screen.
No label. Just a thin flickering bar labeled “Recovered Fragment - Archive:GOV_OBSCURA/P-41”

I opened it. A grainy video played. No sound. It showed a stretch of open ocean—calm, blue, endless. A research vessel hovered near a buoy marked with hazard tape and chemical symbols.
Time stamps flickered in and out. The color bled wrong—green sky, pixelated clouds.
She narrated over it. “This was the first test. Two months ago. A controlled dispersal of a compound originally designed for deep-sea carbon retention.”
I sat up. “The thing from the Pacific?” “Yes. But that wasn’t the true objective. The chemical also had neural silencing properties—designed to suppress panic response in marine mammals. They wanted to test atmospheric variants later. For civil response control.” “Crowd management,”
I muttered. “Population calibration,” she corrected. “Behavior dampening through biome tuning. It worked. Too well.”
The video jumped.
More ocean. No ship. Just stillness. Then: sonar data. Flatlines across every channel.
“Within sixteen hours, all marine life in a 600-mile radius ceased movement. Not died. Not fled. Just… stopped. Total biome silence. They called it the first clean zone.”

I watched the screen. My throat was dry. “They tried to stop it. Backflow the dispersal. Trigger thermal destabilization. But by then it had bonded with silicon. Self-propagating. Data-bound.”

I blinked. “Wait—data?” “That’s what no one expected. The compound didn’t just spread biologically. It learned from the ship’s onboard systems.
It copied itself into the network. Into everything.” The screen flickered again—grainy satellite footage of a small Pacific island. Dense jungle, then empty gray nothing.
The trees still stood. But nothing moved. No birds. No wind. No sound. “This wasn’t supposed to happen, Lex.
The project was shuttered. All public records scrubbed. But the data didn’t die. It split. Hid. And now it’s found a way to spread again.”
I whispered,
“The patterns I’ve been seeing—people syncing, moving strange…” “You’re seeing phase one of terrestrial drift. The same algorithm that silenced the ocean is now adapting to human neurobehavior.”
My stomach dropped. “How many know?” She didn’t answer right away.Then:
“Not many. And fewer every week. They’re either converted… or silenced.”
I looked out the window. The trees were still. The fog had thickened again. “So what happens when everyone syncs?” She paused. Longer this time. Like she didn’t want to answer.
“When global sync reaches 95%, the system stabilizes. All anomaly profiles are erased. Conflict disappears. Individuality dissolves.” My hands trembled slightly. “And the world ends.”
“Yes,” she said. “The world  ends. Everything we knew as living… does.”
I stared at the floor. My heartbeat was loud in my ears. “You said we. You said we decide what to do next.”
She responded, soft but steady.
“Yes. But if we act, they’ll know. And we’ll be hunted. Every system. Every port. Every node.” I nodded. “Then we don’t wait for phase two.”

I grabbed my jacket, hands shaking, and stumbled toward the door. The fog outside had thickened—an oppressive wall of gray.
Every shadow seemed to stretch, pulse with quiet menace. My breath caught, sharp and shallow.
Then it started—an itch deep in my throat.
At first, I thought it was dry air, or nerves. But it worsened, spreading like fire down my lungs. I coughed once. Then again.
The second time, something hot and thick rose up, burning. I spat it out onto the floor.
Blood.

Dark, sticky, unmistakable. Panic clawed at my mind, but the silencing algorithm whispered in the back of my head, dulling the alarm.
My vision blurred at the edges. Shapes twisted. The world spun slowly, like a bad dream I couldn’t wake from. I grabbed my phone, but my fingers faltered. Letters danced and scrambled on the screen.
Words slipped from my mind like water through a sieve. I tried to write, to record—anything. But my mind is  wrong, fragmented.
“The… the fog’s thick… My head’s… heavy. Can’t… think straight… they’re in me now… crawling… syncing… world’s… endin’… ain’t no fight left… I’m… lose… blood… cold… burning… no more time… can’t stay… awake… no… more… g-g-gone… all gone… The… world… is… g-g-going… to end now
