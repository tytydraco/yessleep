My name is Kourtney, I’m 23, and I have a problem. A weird problem.

It started when I bought my house around 5 months ago. 

The first few days I moved in, everything seemed normal. Well, everything except for the busted air conditioning, but that’s beside the point. 

It was round the end of the second week of living there that it started happening.

The morning of the first gift, I had gotten out of bed and got going as usual. I got out of bed, fed my cat Misty, and had started my coffee when I noticed a small package on my coffee table.

It was wrapped in plain white paper with a small sage-green ribbon tied neatly around it.

Shocked, I looked all around for the person who had left it. I searched in closets, under my bed and guest bed, even going as far as to check the air ducts. Nothing. No one. I knew it couldn't be any of my friends, nor my parents, as none of them had the code to my front door. 

Not wanting to touch it, I got dressed and walked to the cafe down the street, where I’ve been working as a barista for 4 years.

I worked my long 8 hour shift, forgetting all about the package as I talked to my favorite regulars about their grandchildren, how their dog was doing, etc.

When the day was over, I walked back home.

Walking through the front door, that’s when I saw it again. The package.

It was still sitting in the middle of the coffee table where I had left it, except now, there was a small notecard laying next to it. It read “*open me*” in the prettiest cursive I have ever seen.

Picking up the notecard first, I turned it over to see if there was more writing on the pack of it. Nope. I put the card down and picked up the package.

Untying the bow and unwrapping the neatly folded paper, I unveiled a small black box. I took the top off of the box and saw a small pendant, like one you would wear on a necklace.

It was pure metal with a very detailed flower on it. It looked like a lotus. 

Turning it over in my hand, I tried to think about who would have left me something like that, and more importantly, how they got into my house during the night. 

I placed the pendant back into the box and left it on the coffee table, ignoring it as I went to the kitchen to heat up some leftover spaghetti. 

While my food was in the microwave, I texted my best friend to tell her about the package, but her being boy crazy and delusional, she came up with the idea that maybe I had a secret admirer. I just rolled my eyes and decided not to tell anyone else. *It’s no cause for concern, it’s harmless* I told myself.

I grabbed my food and sat on the couch, eating and watching tv while simultaneously scrolling through social media. 

After an hour and a half or so, I decided it was time for bed. I placed my dishes in the sink, scooped Mitsy off of her cat tree where she liked to lounge, and headed to my room. I locked the door, just as a precaution.

When I woke up, I checked the coffee table. Nothing. I checked all around the house. No package in sight. I sighed with relief and continued on with my day.

It was three days before the next one appeared. 

When this one showed up, it was a tad bit larger than the last one. Still wrapped in the same white paper, though this one had a royal blue ribbon wrapped around it. There was no note.

Opening it, it was a necklace chain, seemingly for the pendant I had received a few days earlier.

The gifts continued like this, every three days. However, it was always something different in the boxes.

Gift 3: a heart shaped trinket box; yellow ribbon. 

Gift 4: a piece of polished obsidian; fittingly, a black ribbon.

Gift 5: a vintage-looking handheld mirror; pink ribbon. 

I gladly accepted these gifts, always saying a quiet “thank you” to whoever had left them.

It was after the fifth gift that things started to take a turn.

Three days after the mirror, I went to the coffee table to find another package, this time wrapped in black paper with a white ribbon wrapped around it.

Not thinking anything of it, I opened the package - It was a tooth. A singular human tooth with root still connected. 

I gasped and dropped the package. I left it on the floor when I went out to work.

When I came home, it was back on the coffee table. 

The packages kept coming after that. I tried to ignore them, but when I did, a note with the same handwriting as before would appear, reading “open me” in red ink.

Gift 7: the head of a bird; black paper, white ribbon.

Gift 8: the eye of a small mammal; black paper, white ribbon.

Gift 9: a *human* finger; red paper, white ribbon.

I called the police after this one, and they took it as evidence. They said they would be in touch with me, but I haven’t heard anything since. I gave them the rest of the “gifts” just in case they could track whoever was sending them. 

When I found the tenth package, I was horrified.

A large kitchen knife, covered in blood; red paper, black ribbon. A note next to it read “no police, no telling” in red ink with the same, beautiful cursive.

I sobbed, screaming “Why are you doing this? Who are you? ***What*** are you?” I got no answer.

I’ve been considering moving but I’m worried it will follow me. Maybe it would move onto the next person who lived here, but I’m too scared to find out.

I haven’t eaten since the knife. I can’t. I can’t breathe. I can’t think.

It’s been two days after the last gift, and I’m terrified to see what awaits on my coffee table tomorrow.
