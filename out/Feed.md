Yet another freezing morning.



Well, I assume it is. In here it’s a perfect 21 degrees Celsius. Out there it’s around -10 degrees at the most, always.



I make my way down to the canteen. There are already some people there. I’m always the last one. I don’t know why, I wasn’t like this at the beginning, but these days there is zero motivation left in me.

The same terrible coffee every morning, the same terrible Daniel every morning. I put up with it all for nothing. 



Without much excitement I walk to my post to start my day. Eve and Raul are already there. I can already hear Raul in my head: 'working only half a day, huh'



''Working only half a day, huh?'' Raul greets me. Ugh, if I could hop in a car I’d drive home right now. 



But I can’t. When they sent the six of us here it was pretty exciting. Something about a secret discovery, very hush hush. We were sent to Antarctica to investigate a discovery made by one of the satellites. Well, supposedly made by one of the satellites. 7 months have passed and we’ve found jack shit. You can already tell I’m done with this whole 'investigation'.







“Hi Raul, good morning to you too’’, I greet him back. ‘’Afternoon, you mean!’’ he replies. Will it ever stop?



I take a seat at my place and start staring. Staring like I have been for these past 7 months. Staring and thinking about where I wish I’d be right now. Staring at the screen that shows the view of our deepwater camera. I see the same kind of fish all the time. I’ve even secretly started to name them. If my coworkers found out they might throw me off the project. Maybe that’s what I want after all…



I keep staring. It’s all the same, only the names will change. Every day, it seems we’re wasting away.

I shake my head and realize I have lapsed into song lyrics again. My mind can’t keep tethered to this mind numbing experience.



 

Luckily Eve snaps me out of it. ''Ready for another day of spying on fish?'' Sometimes it feels like she is the only other normal person on this compound. I say jokingly that that’s what I’m here for. Sadly she turns back to her work and l go back to staring at this screen in front of me.



Hours go by, or is it minutes? I can never tell. When I’m sitting at my desk I lose all concept of time, all I know is water and fish. All the sudden I’m shaken awake. The camera starts moving at a high speed downwards diagonally. ''Raul what the hell man!” I look up from my screen and see Raul sweating, pulling on the joystick. ''I’m not doing that'' he says. Eve rushes over and so do I. This is the most exciting work has been since the second day.





We rush to Raul and see he’s trying to pull the observation sub in the opposite direction its going. Raul’s the first one to suggest: ''It must be stuck on something''. I lose interest immediately. Oh well, maybe hopefully the camera will break and we will get to go home. It is after all the only one we had available.





''that’s it folks, time to wrap the show up!'' I proclaim. Raul shatters my hopes and dreams: ''It’s stopped! No wait, it’s moving slowly now!''. I walk over to my screen and the others follow. By this time the others in the canteen down the hall have heard the commotion and have rushed over. All six of us are standing around my desk watching. “What happened?’’ asked Dave. Eve shushed him. I love it when she does that. Dave is our leading scientist and what he says goes, unless Eve is around. She always knew how to put him in place.





''Can you hear that?'' she turns the volume knob all the way to the maximum. It’s no use. There is never a sound down there. I mockingly and silently laughed at the engineers many, many times since we came here. I couldn’t help but crack a smile again. It was the single most usele…. BEEP BEEP BEEEEP BEEP. There’s a sound!



We all lean in instinctively trying to hear better. I have no idea what it is, what could this beeping be and WHAT is making that sound? Daniel shouts out: ''Its morse code!''. Ugh, of course DANIEL knows what it is.



''What is it then?’’ I ask him. He listens for a little while. And then another and another.





I take my eyes off the screen and realise the others have done the same. Daniel looks like he’s seen a ghost. ''feed’’ he whimpers. I stare at him blankly. ''feed what?’’ I ask. Daniel replies: ''I don’t know, it just says feed.’’ 



We are all baffled. We stand around for a couple of hours, listening, watching but nothing happens. Nobody lost interest but it was no good to all stand around and do nothing. Everyone goes back to their place. Except Eve, she’s still at my desk watching and listening. I don’t mind that she stays.





We both stare in silence and yet again my mind goes elsewhere. But this time it isn’t a sunny beach or a nice warm cozy place with a cold drink in my hand. It is to the mission briefing seven months ago. An unidentified flying object crashed into the Southern Ocean. Yes, yes, hold your horses, I am indeed talking about a UFO. We have been sent her in search of a UFO and it was made out to be something very important and classified. 





As I have already made clear, for seven whole months we hadn’t found anything. We were very close on giving up hope, I already had. Today was the most excitement we had during work since I could remember.





''Go grab some rest’’, Eve says to me. ''we’ve been here for hours.'' I take a look at the clock and realize she is right. We are way past midnight. Time has never gone faster here before.  Normally I would have said something like ‘Oh Eve no, you please go ahead, I’ll stay’ or ‘I don’t need rest, I can do this all day’ but today has really drained me. I thank her and quickly make my way to the sleeping quarters. 





I crash on my bed and all the questions fade away. At least the bed is nice, I think, as I have thought every night since I’ve arrived in this place. I close my eyes. Darkness. Darkness like the ocean we have been watching for months. Darkness like the place the camera was brought. Beep beep beeeep beep. It still rings through my head. Feed. What do we need to feed? What do we need to feed it with? So many questions we have. Questions we can find the answer to tomorrow.



Today is not like just some other freezing morning. I make my way to the canteen and find nobody there. I can already guess where everyone is. I quickly ate breakfast and I notice its my first breakfast without Daniel sharing his random fact of the day. With a cup of coffee in my hand I make my way to the observation room. Again, people have gathered around my desk. ‘’What is happening’’, I ask, but nobody cares to look up from my screen.





By that time I notice the beeping has changed. I still don’t understand anything. I take a look at Daniel and he says to me: ‘’feed, come.’’ OK, that’s creepy. Dave claps in his hands, demanding everyone’s attention and tells us to go to the conference room. 

We each take a seat around the table and Robert is the first to break the silence: ‘’ So, everybody, any thoughts?’’. As the oldest of the group Robert liked to think he was in charge. Dave knew he wasn’t, Eve knew even better. Everyone turns their heads to me. ‘’ Neil, you have been in charge of observation. Have you ever noticed anything strange?’’ Dave asks. I scrape my throat before I speak. ‘’No, never. I’ve stared at the screen and I have not once in our time here seen anything like these past two days.’’ He turns his head to Raul: ‘’Any idea where the observation sub is now?’’ ‘’Well, what we saw last is that the sub seemed to pass through the opening of the mouth of a dead blue whale, but it hasn’t come out. It’s safe to say it’s still in there’’.





‘’Also, what up with that creepy Morse code?’’, Eve sadly addresses. I didn’t want to give that part any thought. It creeped me out. I think it creeped everybody out, because nobody said a word.

Unfortunately no important questions were answered during that meeting. We all return to our stations and another day passes. 

In my bed at night I can’t help but feel a sense of dread come over me. ‘feed, come’. Those two words are scaring me. Will there be another word tomorrow? I really don’t want to find out, yet I drift away to sleep and tomorrow comes.

 

Another perfect temperature morning where I assume the outside is freezing like Hell. Only this time it isn’t perfect. Its cold inside. That is impossible. I get up and look at the little digital clock that is sitting on my desk. 02:43. Why am I awake? My alarm doesn’t go off for hours. Suddenly the cold hits me hard, was it the cold that has woken me up? I grab my parka from my closet and make my way down. I see everyone is gathered around in the canteen. “Hey, has the door been opened or something?’’ I call out in the open. People look at me with a bewildered look on their face. Nobody speaks a word. I notice Dave and Robert are gearing up for what seems like an outdoor expedition.





Suddenly I don’t feel so good. There is something wrong. I notice stains on the wall. What the hell happened? As I get closer I realise it is words that are on the wall, not just stains. I read the words and tears of pure fear and shock come out of my eyes. “Who the hell wrote this!’’ I shout. Again I’m ignored. I get frustrated. I cannot believe this is happening. That damn Daniel pulling one of his stupid pranks again. I’ve had it. I’ve reached my limit. I am going to punch him and get sent home for fighting. I do not care anymore. I just want to go home. 

Then I suddenly realise it is just the five of us there. Daniel is nowhere to be seen.

‘’OK everybody, Robert and I will be back in two hours!’’ Dave shouts and they go through the first safety door. I don’t want to be here. I also want to go out, but I want to go out and go home, the office, anywhere but here. I realise Eve is crying. I need to comfort her. But as I’m walking towards her I get close to the stains on the wall. It smells bad. As a doctor and scientist I know that smell. It’s the smell of blood. My body seems to be unable to move once I realise what it is. 



I need to be strong. I cannot panic now, not now. Leave that for later. I approach the stains and see the kitchen knife is on the floor next to the wall, completely covered in blood. I am getting sick. Why? Who did this? Was it really Daniel? Why would he do such a thing? My mind was racing. I’m getting dizzy and I need to sit down. After a small moment of recollecting myself I realise Eve is still sobbing. She needs to get out of here. With all my strength I stand up and I walk towards her.



''Eve, please. Come with me.’’ I hold her by the arms and shoulders and I guide her to the bedrooms. As we are both walking away, completely in shock I can feel the words written on the wall staring at us. It is like I have eyes in the back of my head; I can still read them. There is no questions left to ask or answer. There is no research left to be done. All that’s left is to call the people back home and arrange immediate transportation. We are almost there. I can’t help but look back one more time at the large letters written in blood on our wall.

FEED, COME, NOW.
