*A man enters a meat market, he looks around for a bit, then he grabs two packets of ground meat, he goes to the checkout counter with the packets in hand.*

*At the checkout counter he meets the shop owner.*

Man: Hello!

Owner: Hi, there! 

*The owner looks at the two packets of ground meat.*

Owner: That'll be 12$!

Man: Sure, let me just grab my wallet.

Owner: Oh, almost forgot to tell 'ya! I'll be back in just a moment!

*The owner turns around and opens a creaky black door, he enters the room and closes the door behind him.*

*The man looks confused, but still patiently waits for the owner to return.*

*About 5 minutes pass and the owner returns.*

Owner: I apologize for the wait, here you go!

*The owner gives the man a small packet of minced meat.*

Man: Umm, what is this?

Owner: Well, we've just opened up this shop, so here's your gift for being one of our first customers! It's a special kind of meat, made from a very rare type of pig, I'd say we're one of the only ones that produce this type of meat!

Man: Thank you very much, sir!

*The man pays for his order, the owner quickly wraps the three packets of meat in a paper bag and gives it to the man.*

*The man slowly exits the shop, he turns around and sees the friendly owner waving him goodbye, but as he looks a bit closer, he sees the owner's eyes are red and full of tears, the owner turns around and once again enters the room behind him.*

*The man enters his home, he wastes no time and immediately starts preparing his meal.*

*He takes the ground meat out of the two plastic packets. Skillfully, the man forms the ground meat into a couple of patties and begins cooking them on a small portable grill. As soon as the burgers become slightly brown, the man puts them in a couple of buns and eats them, voraciously.*

*The man finishes his meal, but he doesn't seem to be fully satisfied, he looks at the small packet of meat that the owner gave him as a gift. The man takes the packet, rips it open and forms it into a small patty, he begins grilling the juicy, crimson patty. As soon as the meat looks fully cooked, he puts it into a bun, and eats it just like the last couple of burgers, but this time the man looks visibly satisfied, he licks his fingers as soon as he finishes the meal.*

Man (To himself): Jesus, this is so damn good!

*The man cleans up after himself, then takes the small empty packet of meat to the trash can, before throwing it into the trash can, the man freezes in place and looks at the bottom of the packet.*

*The man sees something written on the bottom of the packet, in tiny black letters, the word "HELP" is plastered on the bottom of the plastic packet.*

*The man scratches his head in confusion, probably wondering if this is some kind of early April Fool's joke.*

*After a couple of seconds, the man puts on his shoes and leaves his home.*

*The man approaches the same meat market, it has a "Closed" sign on the door, but the front door is not locked and the lights inside are still on. Probably thinking the owner just closed up shop recently, the man enters the shop.*

*Before the man can even say "Hello", he is met with a loud squeal coming from the room in the back.*

*The squealing continues and gets even louder.*

*The man approaches the black door slowly.*

*After about three minutes of waiting and listening to the almost deafening piglike squeals, the man's curiousity gets the better of him as he slowly opens the door just enough so he can see what's inside the mysterious room.*

*The man is immediately met with a disturbing image.*

*He sees the owner of the shop on his knees, he is wearing only his apron and squealing like a pig.*

*After a couple of seconds, from the shadows, a large figure emerges.*

*The creature that emerges is at least 2.5 feet tall and seems to be morbidly obese, it is wearing a white butcher's uniform with a red apron, the most disturbing feature is it's head, it looks exactly like a pig's head, but the look on it's face is unnervingly human, the rest of it's body looks just like a normal human being's body, although unnaturally bloated.*

*The creature moves closer to the owner, it opens it's large mouth and starts vomiting.*

*After about ten seconds, the creature stops vomiting and wipes it's mouth with it's apron.*

*The owner lunges at the vomit and eats it while grunting like a pig, after just a minute he devours all of it. Not even a moment later, the owner's body swells up, he looks like his weight doubled.*

*The creature takes something from the table, it looks like a bag of some sort, then it throws it right next to the owner.*

*The owner takes the bag and puts it on his head, as he does, it becomes clear that the object he put on his head is no bag, but instead a makeshift pig mask, the mask has a pink pig nose taped on it and two holes for where the eyes are.*

*The owner starts squealing once again, while looking at the disturbing creature.*

*The creature grabs a large butcher knife.*

*The creature cuts off a piece of flesh from the owner's back and drops it into the meat grinder.*

*The owner squeals while the creature holds him down and cuts him once again.*

*The man looks like he has been frozen solid, he just stares in disbelief.*

*The creature wiggles it's piglike ears and turns to face the man, a large smile forms on it's face as it looks the man in the eyes.*

Creature: Looks like you already ate it, good!

*The man trembles in fear as the creature grunts.*

Creature: Since you're here, there's no need for this one.

*The creature averts it's gaze, it looks at the owner and with one quick move, it slices his throat.*

*The owner audibly chokes in his own blood.*

*As the owner dies, the creature grunts in pleasure and looks at the man once again.*

Creature: Come! You'll be a fine replacement!

*The man tries to turn around and make a run for it, but before he can, the creature speaks once again.*

Creature: Humanus Porcus!

*As soon as he hears the creature speak, the man falls to the ground, then he gets up and quickly enters the room.*

*The man gets on all fours and starts squealing just like the owner did.*

*The massive creature slowly approaches the door and closes it.*

*TAPE ENDS*

*The last couple of tapes were disturbing, but this one almost made me throw up, I didn't even let the warning play out, instead I took the tape out and threw it back in the box, then I put the next tape in and hit "Play".*

*Tape 4: Pigeons, begins.*
