Since I can remember, I've gone on outdoor runs. One night in the summer, around 6pm, after finishing a light dinner, I decided to go on my usual run. I always run the same path, starting with neighborhood sidewalks for about a half mile, then passing through a gate into the forest where I run another two miles. In the forest, there are two separate paths, one paved and one unpaved. The unpaved path is more scenic, so I usually take it on the way in, and then take the paved path when I turn around. These paths into the forest are hidden, and not many people know about them, so they're usually not busy. It's actually rare for me to see another person on my run, except for the occasional encounter with people walking their dogs. But other than that, I'm pretty much alone, or at least I thought I was.  
After running in the forest for a while, I heard a notification coming from my phone. It wasn't a text message, but an airdrop notification. I panicked, realizing that someone must have been close to me to send this. I tried to play it off like I didn't hear it and continued running for a few seconds. Then, I stopped to change the music, but in reality, I pulled out my phone to look at the notification. My heart sank when I saw that it was a Snapchat picture of me mid-run with the caption, "come back." The picture was taken just seconds ago, as I was wearing the same clothes as in the picture. It appeared that the person taking the picture was hiding in the bushes. I put my phone back and started running as fast as I could. I was forced to take the long way out of the forest and back to my neighborhood.  
While running, I started hearing rustling and footsteps behind me, but I didn't turn back knowing it would slow me down. Finally, I reached the edge of the forest and began running through backyards to lose whoever was chasing me. It worked, with the last thing I could hear being the sound of metal hitting metal, suggesting that the person chasing me had some sort of weapon. I still don't know who it was, as I never looked behind me and never saw what they looked like. I don't know what they wanted from me. I never ran in that forest again, and I've since turned off my phone's airdrop feature completely. Also Since that unsettling incident, I've become more cautious and aware of my surroundings while running. I always stick to well-populated areas now. I also I make sure to inform someone of my running route and estimated return time, just in case something ever goes wrong. It's a lesson I learned the hard way, but it has made me prioritize my safety above all else.  
Sometimes, when I'm out for a run, I can't help but feel a lingering sense of unease. It's as if the memory of that frightening experience is imprinted in my mind forever, a constant reminder of the potential dangers lurking in the shadows.  
Nevertheless, I refuse to let fear control me. Running is my passion and my escape, and I won't let one terrifying encounter ruin that for me. Every step I take now is a testament to my resilience and determination.  
As time goes on, the memory of that night becomes less vivid, but the lessons I learned remain etched in my mind. I am more cautious, more vigilant, and more aware of my surroundings. I've joined running groups, ensuring I'm surrounded by fellow enthusiasts who share my commitment to safety.  
While my love for running remains strong, I have come to appreciate the importance of balance. I still explore new paths and venture into the unknown, but I've become mindful of the potential risks. I now carry a small personal alarm and pepper spray, just in case.
