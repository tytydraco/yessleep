\~PART 1\~

 

An urban legend took my daughter’s life, and I would’ve done anything to save her.



Cock the Hammer.  Have you ever heard of it?  Not the Cypress Hill hip-hop song but the game.  I’ll be honest, I hadn’t.  Not until all of this happened.

 

Looking around at all the people in my house, I had wanted them to take their sympathy and leave me the fuck alone.  A funeral for Nina shouldn’t be any kind of comfort for me.  My daughter was dead, and I felt responsible.

 

Max found his sister.  I should’ve been the one, but I was too busy and distracted.  I should’ve done better.  Nina had always thought I *could*.  She believed in me more than I believed in myself, and that’s not the way a father-daughter relationship is supposed to work.

 

When I saw Chief Schnabel slip in my front door, I was furious.  I didn’t want this guy in my house or anywhere near me.  Schnabel was the one who told me the gunshot that killed my daughter was consistent with suicide.  But they never found a gun.  I’m no Sherlock Holmes, but suicide victims don’t dispose of their weapons.  But this minor fact didn’t stop Schnabel from shutting down his investigation three hours after Nina was found.

 

I was about to make a rage-filled beeline for the Chief when I spotted Willow, Nina’s best friend since pre-school.  I hadn’t talked to her since Nina died, and I needed to.  Maybe she had answers.

 

Willow was emotional, but that didn’t stop me from bombarding her with lawyer-like questions, making her cry.  I felt bad, but before I could apologize, the rest of Nina’s friends swooped in.  There was Zach, Haley, Chase and Hugo.  I’ve known these four for years and think they’re all decent kids, apart from Zach and his frat-boy smugness.  I couldn’t tell if they were trying to protect Willow or hiding something, but I was determined to find out.  But they kept giving me the runaround, especially smartass Zach.

 

I suddenly had the urge to punch Zach in the face, but my sister rescued me, dragging me into the kitchen.  Lauren and her wife, Kim, reminded me that I was at my daughter’s funeral reception and that I probably shouldn’t be getting into a fight with her friends or making them cry.  Lauren said I should be focused on Max.  This riled me up, but I knew she was right.

 

The reception was finally winding down, and I had stayed hidden in the kitchen for the last hour, trying to talk to Max.  He was playing his Game Boy and refusing to look at me, his fingers tapping away a million miles an hour.

 

Max is the sweetest kid – when he’s not having one of his epic meltdowns.  His mother was good at consoling him, but she died last year of ovarian cancer.  Nina had gracefully stepped in as the family Max-whisperer in my wife’s absence, the best big sister a kid with emotional issues could wish for.  But now it was just me and Max.

 

“I promise I’ll do better, buddy,” I told him for the umpteenth time.  “We’re all we have now, and I promise I’ll do better.”

 

Max didn’t respond, but I knew he’d heard me because his fingers stopped moving.

 

Willow suddenly appeared at the door.  I was glad to see her, and I apologized for before.

 

“It’s okay,” she said, her voice still shaky.  “I know you’re upset.”

 

I nodded and kind of smiled, sharing something with her.  We were both upset.  We were both devastated.

 

“I just wanted to say goodbye,” Willow finally said after a long silence.

 

“I really am sorry, Willow.  I was out of line.  I know you were a wonderful friend to Nina.  She was lucky to have you.”

 

Willow started to cry again.  It was a little awkward, but I hugged her.  I knew I wasn’t hugging my daughter, but I felt Nina close.

 

“Max, can I talk to your dad in private for a moment?”

 

Max dropped off his stool and walked out, never looking up from his Game Boy.

 

Willow wanted to tell me something important, so I let her take her time.  I didn’t want to spook her.

 

“I was there when it happened,” she finally said.

 

I wasn’t sure what she meant.

 

“I was with Nina when she did it.”

 

“You were with Nina when she died?” I asked, needing this to be as clear as possible in my head.

 

Willow couldn’t speak before, but once she started, she was desperate to get it all out.  She told me they got a hold of the gun and played the game at Zach’s house.  She told me Nina didn’t want to play at first, but then the gun followed her home and seduced her, and when she did play, she experienced a suicide and the gun forced her to do what she did, even though Willow knows that’s the last thing Nina wanted to do.

 

I was trying to make sense of what she was saying.

 

Willow keeps talking, forcing the rest out.  She told me she got rid of the gun.  She told me that after a suicide, you have to protect the legend, or the gun will come after you and everyone you love.  So that’s what she did.  She drove out to Walton Park, dug a hole, and buried it.

 

She finally took a breath.  I could tell she felt a sense of relief, but at the same time, she looked as if she might break into a million pieces. 

 

“I’m really sorry, Mr. H.”

 

“I’m trying to understand what you’re saying, Willow,” I said as gently as I could.  “I *need* to understand.  This gun – whose was it?”

 

“It doesn’t belong to anyone.”

 

“And you say you played a game.  What do you mean… what game?”

 

Before Willow could answer, her mother swept in, offered her condolences again, and whisked her daughter out.  I would’ve stopped them if I had been thinking straight.

 

I found my sister cleaning up the buffet table.  Lauren knew something was up by the look on my face.  I asked her if she knew of some urban legend about a gun and a game.

 

“Cock the Hammer,” Lauren said without even thinking about it.  “That story was big when we were kids.  Why?”

 

“I don’t remember that.”

 

“That’s because you were too obsessed with basketball and Suzanne Boysen.”

 

“So, it’s not real?”

 

“What?  Some haunted gun?  No, of course not.  Why are you asking about this?”

 

I brushed the question off.  I didn’t want to try to explain what Willow had told me.  I just wanted to think for a moment.  I just needed time to think.

 

I jumped on the internet as soon as my house was my own again.  It was true – there’s an urban legend called Cock the Hammer that’s been around for decades.  I still couldn’t believe I’d never heard of it.  It involves this ornate Lefaucheux revolver from the Civil War.  Supposedly when you cock the gun’s hammer it shows you a random killing that’s been committed with the gun.  You time travel to the place and time of a killing and get to inhabit the body of the person pulling the trigger.  But there’s a Russian Roulette catch to the game.  While most people experience the killing of another person, in some cases, the person used the gun to commit suicide.  If a player relives one of these scenes, they’re forced by the evil possession of the gun to use it on themselves.  The gun takes control, and it insists on being discharged – into a player’s head or mouth or whichever way the person committed suicide – to end the session.  Or at least that’s how the legend goes.

 

My first thought was that’s some crazy, stupid shit.  But the more I kept reading, the angrier it made me.  This crazy, stupid shit was dangerous as hell.

 

How did Nina fall for it?  I couldn’t understand that.  She was such a smart kid.  How could she have believed in such nonsense?  That some fantasy gun had magical powers.

 

I wanted answers.  But then again, maybe I didn’t deserve answers.  I should’ve been protecting my daughter, but instead, this game and this so-called haunted gun had seduced her.  It was a hard truth for me to swallow.

 

I couldn’t sleep that night.  The gun haunted me.  Not that I believed any of it; I didn’t.  But I worried another Nina would.  Willow said she had buried the gun, but that wasn’t good enough for me.  I needed to unearth it and destroy it.

 

I picked Willow up first thing in the morning, and we drove out to Walton Park.  I knew what I was asking her to do made her nervous.  She didn’t want to be anywhere near the gun again.  But I think she could tell I was desperate.  It wouldn’t bring Nina back, but maybe it would save me just a little.

 

The hike into the woods was farther than I anticipated, but Willow said she wanted to get the gun as far away from anything and everyone as she could.  She remembered exactly where she buried it.  She hadn’t wanted to get lost hiking out, so she picked Squaw Rock, a place she used to visit with her dad before he remarried and started a new family.

 

We finally reached the area and the mound of dirt Willow buried the gun under.  I had brought a small shovel and immediately started digging, tossing off dirt.  I keep digging.  I was surprised at how deep Willow buried it.  Finally, I hit something solid.  But it wasn’t the gun.  It was a thick root from a nearby tree.  I couldn’t dig any deeper.

 

“Are you sure this is the right spot?” I asked.

 

Willow was positive.  She was suddenly on her knees.  She put her hands into the hole, and they knocked hard against the root.

 

“Where is it?”  She started searching through the loose dirt.  She kept clawing at things with her hands, hoping the gun was somehow hidden in the tiny clumps.  “Where is it?!”  Her nerves had turned to panic.

 

I put a hand on her shoulder.  “Somebody probably just found it.”

 

“No.  I buried it here so no one could find it.  But I shouldn’t have done that.  I made it angry.”

 

I helped her to her feet.  “Someone came along and dug it up, that’s all,” I said in my most self-assured voice.

 

Willow shook her head and kept shaking.

 

“It’s going to be okay,” I told her.

 

“It’s evil, Mr. H.” 

 

“It’s a gun, Willow.  It’s only evil if we make it evil.”

 

Willow told me I didn’t understand.  She told me she would give anything to make me understand before it was too late.

 

All I wanted was to talk to Nina’s friends, and I asked Willow to text them.  They felt ambushed when my car pulled into the 7-11 parking lot an hour later.  Willow wanted to tell them she had buried the gun, but it was gone.  I wanted to know if any of them had it, convinced that one of them did.

 

Even though I now knew they were all playing the game the night Nina died, her friends were still reluctant to talk.  But Willow vouched for me, and they all softened.  None of them had the gun.  None of them *wanted* the gun after what happened to Nina.

 

“You can’t bury it,” Hugo said.

 

“You can’t destroy it, either,” Chase added.

 

Now that I was hearing the same story from all of them – seeing the same ardent belief in something so preposterous – I wanted more than ever to get my hands on this gun.  Everything can be destroyed, even something evil. 

 

I questioned Zach on where he got the gun in the first place, and he said he just found it.  He was walking home from school, cutting through Abbot’s field, when the gun was just there in his path like it had been waiting for him.

 

“It probably sensed his fear,” Chase tells me.

 

Zach shoves Chase.  “Bullshit, what fear?”

 

“Fine, dude, then it sensed your anger or stupidity or whatever.”

 

Zach came at Chase again, and the two boys scuffled, and I had to step in and break them up.

 

Zach stormed off in a huff, and Chase disappeared into the 7-Eleven.  Hugo tried to escape with Haley, but she pulled her hand away.  She wanted Hugo to tell me about his Uncle Ray.  Hugo was pissed she was bringing this up when he asked her not to.  The two argued for a moment, but then Hugo came clean.  His Uncle Ray played the game a few years ago.

 

I pressed Hugo for details, but he said all he wanted to say, so Haley spoke for him.  She told me that Uncle Ray played the game and experienced a suicide, but the person in the past trying to kill themselves screwed things up.  “I mean, it was an attempted suicide, I guess,” Haley said.  “They put the gun to their head and pulled the trigger, but they didn’t die.  The bullet just got lodged in their brain.  And that’s what happened to Uncle Ray.  That’s how the game works.”

 

“He’s a vegetable,” Hugo offered.  “Or at least that’s what my dad thinks.  But my Aunt Kathy still visits him every day.  She talks to him and swears he talks back – or at least on some telepathic level or something.”

 

“Where’s he living?” I asked.

 

“If you can call that living,” Hugo said with a pained chuckle.

 

“The place is called Cedarwood Manor,” Haley offered.  “It’s out by the interstate.”

 

I wanted to take Willow home – she had helped me enough – but she insisted on coming along to Cedarwood Manor.  I think being with me made her feel connected to Nina, and that’s something I understood.  The feeling was mutual.

 

The front desk receptionist sent us in the right direction.  We stepped into Uncle Ray’s room, pulled in by the droning beep of the machines.  The blinds were drawn.  To be honest, the guy looked dead more than anything.  I guess he hadn’t been out of bed, or rather *some* bed, since this all happened – since he supposedly played the game and put a bullet in his head whether he wanted to or not, so his body had deflated like a balloon.

 

It wasn’t until Willow and I stood closer to the bed that we realized Uncle Ray’s eyes were open.  His blank stare was eerie-looking.  It was also focused squarely on Willow.

 

I wasn’t there for small talk, so I started asking the man questions about the gun and the game.  I was pretty sure Uncle Ray could hear me because his eyes kept glancing over at me at various points, clearly triggered by what I was asking.   But for the most part, his focus stayed drilled on Willow.

 

I wanted to know if it was true that he played some game called Cock the Hammer.  I wanted to know how I could find the gun.  I wanted to understand what he was so afraid of.

 

This last question surprised me.  I wasn’t planning on asking it.  I wouldn’t have imagined why I would.  But the look of terror on Uncle Ray’s face made me realize it was the most important question of all.

 

Willow still hadn’t looked away.  I think she was waiting for Uncle Ray to blink.  I was waiting for the same thing.  The man hadn’t, I swear, since we walked in.

 

*Blink.*

 

Willow’s arm was suddenly snatched by Uncle Ray’s hand.  It came out of nowhere, his bony fingers clamping down hard around her flesh.  Willow freaked.  She tried frantically to squirm free, but his hand stayed clutched around her wrist, draining the blood from her hand.  She wanted to run, and she tried to, yanking the wisp of the guy out of bed.  The two of them were on the floor before I could even react.  I jumped in and tried to pry Uncle Ray’s fingers open, but it was like rigor mortis had set in.

 

The commotion brought a crowd into the room like a code blue.  The massive descent of bodies somehow freed Willow from what I’m sure felt like the grip of death.  She scurried across the room on all fours.  I moved with her, wanting to comfort her, but she jumped at my touch.

 

Willow was still shaking when I drove her home.  She wouldn’t talk at first, but then she started mumbling something under her breath.  I told her I really wanted to hear what she was saying, but she would have to speak up.  She took a breath and started over.  She told me that when Uncle Ray grabbed her arm, there was a bright flash of light in the room, and Uncle Ray was suddenly sitting at the edge of the bed, the Lefaucheux revolver from the game pointed at his head.  He was trying to tell her something.  She was terrified, but she stopped fighting him, transfixed, and just watched as the words slowly formed on his lips.  *I... dare... you.*

 

“I dare you,” I repeated.  “I dare you to what?”

 

“Play the game, I think,” Willow said.

 

It was suddenly clear to me that she had hit her head when she fell, and what she experienced was some sort of delusion.  I told her that, hoping it would reassure her, but she insisted that what she was telling me had really happened.

 

“Why would he want you to play the game?” I asked, gently trying to discredit the story.

 

“He doesn’t,” she answered.  “The *gun* does.”

 

I didn’t know what else to say, so I stayed quiet.

 

A few minutes later, I rolled to the curb in front of Willow’s house.  The place was dark, except for a garish fluorescent light in the kitchen.  Willow just stared up at it.

 

“It’s my fault,” she finally said.  “I should’ve stopped Nina from playing.”

 

“It wasn’t your fault,” I quickly answered.  “It was my responsibility to be there for her.  And I wasn’t.”

 

Willow took a few deep breaths, still trying to calm her nerves, then started chewing on the ends of her hair.

 

“I want you to take care, Willow.  Okay?”

 

I think this made her feel better... that someone cared enough to be concerned.

 

“I want you to be careful, Mr. H.  Okay?”

 

“Don’t worry about me.  I’m going to find the gun.  I’m going to destroy it, I promise.”

 

Willow didn’t say anything for a long moment.  Finally, she told me she wanted to believe me.  She said she was going to try really hard to believe me.  She said she genuinely thought that if anyone could do what I just said I would, it would be me.  And then she said she’d pray for me.

 

I thanked her.  She smiled, which was a little forced but nice to see, and then she climbed out of my car.

 

I didn’t know then that I would need Willow’s prayers – and every bit of help I could get – to survive what was about to happen next.
