I'll keep this short and sweet because I just need to get this out of my head. I've already told everyone I know now all my closest friends think im fucking crazy. It's all his fault it's all landons fault he's the crazy one with all his stupid pranks trying to get a rise out of me. But this most recent shit is fucking horrible. 

My brother ever since he stopped seeing me as his cool older brother (he's 4 years younger than me) as loved messing with me making me angry. It started with pouring salt in my drinks or covering my bed in toilet paper and man that shit pissed me off. But I learned to acknowledge it but not let it get to me. You know I figured this was all because I wasn't spending enough time with him. So recently I did im now 19 and hes 14. We started watching all of dragon ball from the beginning it was our thing on fridays. He seemed to love it I'd always find him waiting for me on the couch. We'd have stupid arguments about who would win just normal brotherly conversations. But I guess I must've upset him somehow because he started again. 

A couple weeks ago I walked into the living room and sat down on the couch and called his name to come join me. And then his hand jetted out from under the couch. I cursed and asked him if he was okay under there. He just giggled. I laughed it off and leaned the couch back so he could crawl out. But when I saw him there on the floor this uneasy feeling came over me. He was sprawled out flat on his stomach every part of his body seemed perfectly flat on the floor. His arms and legs were all at 90 degree angles and his chin was perfectly flat on the carpet it looked like it hurt but he still had a stupid grin on his face. So I set the couch all the way down and picked him up by his arms. He let out a deep groan as he stood up not one like a kid his age would make. Then he turned to face me smiled innocently and asked, 
"What episode are we on again?" In this casual way like he didn't just scare the life out of me. He acted completely normal all week. 

Friday came back around. I was filled with dread when I walked through the kitchen towards the living room with Landon being nowhere in sight. The clicking of the ice maker in the freezer making me jump as I creeper into the living room and looked under the couch both of them but he wasn't there. So I took a deep breath and I figured our mom hadn't brought him home yet. I live with my girlfriend Julie but I come over for the weekends to visit. So I walked to the kitchen and grabbed a glass from the dishwasher and walked to the fridge, the freezer right next to it was still making that awful noise so I banged on it trying to dislodge the ice, it would sometimes get stuck in the ice maker and make a clicking noise. When it didn't stop I frustratedly opened the freezer door only to scream when it swung open and I was met with my brother in the small freezer knees to his chin making a sickening click in his throat as he grinned at me wildly. My brother is not a huge guy but he is 5'10 and 140 lbs but looking at him curled up with bits of ice on him he looked like a five year old. I yelled angrily and yanked him out the fridge. I dragged him to the bathroom while he giggled not even attempting to stand up or stop me from dragging him. I brought him to the bathroom, through a towel around him, got in my car, and drove home. I told my girlfriend Julie about it and she really did feel for me, we'd been together for 4 years and she was well aware how I was trying to fix my relationship with Landon. I stayed in the house with her all weekend.

I went to classes and worked like usual all week and part of me thought I should call Landon but I couldnt bare to hear that fucking giggle again. When next Friday came I got a call from my mom saying Landon broke his arm playing inside the house and that he seemed pretty bummed that I wasn't there. And I'm glad I wasn't cause I didn't want to be the one to find him "playing" inside the house. It fucked me up I felt like I was going crazy he had taken this shit to far. The week passed and again I had no plans to see my "brother" on Friday. 

Julie has been my best friend for six years and my girlfriend for four and I plan to propose (if you see this babe sorry for spoiling the suprise) She is the best thing that ever happened to me and one of the reasons I stopped spending so much time with Landon. She's always pushed me to spend time with my family and they love her, I just don't get along with them too well they never wanted me to move out until my brother did. My brother has always hated Julie and once he started playing harmless but bothersome pranks on Julie was when I stopped bring her over. I've known I've loved her since our first kiss and I will never let anything happen to her no matter how small. 

Julie could tell that the situation with Landon  was really messing with me so she wanted to cheer me up. We watched a movie together and when it ended we went to our room for some personal time. We had both partially undressed so I leaned over to grap protection from the bedside dresser. As I opened the drawer I heard the last sound I wanted to hear. I heard that fucking giggle I heard that giggle from a three foot tall one foot deep dresser. I fucking lost it I grabbed my girlfriend and ran out to our car and drove for hours. We ended up driving to her parents house where I am now. 
I am writing this because I just got off the phone with my mom who was in hysterics about my father and Landon. I was later informed by the police that my father had been stabbed seven times in the chest and once in the temple. They said he dies instantly but the officers apprehension makes this hard to believe. They believe that Landon has ran away from home taking the murder wepon with him. A younger officer pulled me aside and gave me the actual briefing it makes me sick to just think about it. My father hadnt been stabbed seven times and he certanly didnt die instantly. He had his achilles tendon severed and was forcibly crammed into a fucking ac vent. He then showed me one of the crime scene photos it was of the bloody ac vent cover,l and next to it was a picture of me and julie when we were kids that my parents kept in the living room. On it in read was wrote, "You 2 will fit in." I don't know exactly what that means, but i have an idea. I have no fucking clue what happened to the my brother but i promise I'll kill that little shit before I'd let anything happen to Julie. 
We're safe right now but her parents are in Europe so it's just us here. Hopefully this won't go any further but if it does you'll be the first to know.
