Over the years, I’ve become something of a collector of supernatural trinkets & stories - to be clear, I’m only in my late twenties, but through some twist of fate, I have been encountering the supernatural for as long as I can remember. I can feel something coming for me - there’s a looming at the back of the deepest recesses of my mind, one that causes my sleep to be restless and my waking hours to be filled with paranoia. I don’t - can’t - trust something I have written down that only I have access to, so I’m going to post this in the hopes that with enough eyes on this, it won’t be altered or changed. I am going to begin with a tale of something I call “the Willow Man”. This is, comparatively, a more recent story: my encounter with the Willow Man occurred when I was in my early twenties, maybe 3-4 years ago. 



There’s a fairly large park in my hometown - it’s primarily flat grass, but it features a large artificial pond surrounded by ancient weeping willows. As one might expect, an open park is a popular place for teens and university students to hang out in the evenings, away from parents and school-related stresses. And so, I found myself sitting alone at the park one evening - university had been particularly intense that semester, but the cool air was doing wonders for me. Besides myself, there was a small scattering of people in the park - some teens doing a bad job of hiding that they’re smoking behind the toilet building, some other uni students sitting in a group near the water, and a couple on a date on the other side of the pond. Really, everything seemed to be at peace - the world was turning but we were here, and we were breathing, and everything would be *fine*. 

It was a short time later that the teenagers began to leave, and as they wandered past the pond, I watched as one of them tossed a still glowing cigarette butt into the pond. The subsequent sequence of events was so rapid, I still struggle to piece everything together. One of the willow trees rapidly uncoiled in a cacophony of creaks and cracks into a hulking humanoid form, and swept two teens into the air with a swipe of one of its “arms”. They tumbled through the air, before landing and rolling to the ground, coming to a stop in a tangle of limbs that made it hard to distinguish who was who. The other teens, frozen on hearing their friends screams, then decided it may be best to start running but quickly found themselves ensnared by the vine-like branches of the willow, dragged backwards towards the lumbering tree-man, while two teens were quickly disregarded - tossed aside and landing in the middle of the pond - the final teen, the one who had thrown the cigarette butt, was suspended upside down in front of what passed for the face of the entity. It bellowed at him in a language I didn’t know, but it was clearly giving a form of disciplinary lecture as it occasionally punctuated its statements with a whipping of its branches. Human skin, however, is not great at receiving a beating from high velocity willow branches, and the teen was very quickly bleeding from dozens of lacerations.



The couple across the pond had fled entirely, leaving behind a blanket and picnic basket, while the university students had split - some bolting, while one was paddling towards the pond’s edge, drenched teen in tow, and another two were working on detangling the mess of the first two teen victims. I, however, dumbfounded and in disbelief, continued to observe the brutal flaying of the litterer. The willow, seemingly complete in its lecture, proceeded to lift the teen up, blood dripping off of hanging strips of skin, tilted its head back, and swallowed him whole. It turned then, towards the entangled teens and their would-be rescuers, and let out a roar. The uni students froze, turning towards the tree, though it made no move towards them and they so they slowly resumed the assisting the teens, each supporting one, as they began to hobble away - I noted their fatal mistake right before the tree began to move: a cigarette box had fallen out one of the teens’ pockets. The tree-man roared once again, this one distinctly angrier, and crossed the distance in two steps, once again swiping at the cluster of people. This time, one of the teen–uni student pairings were flung off the ground - the teen landing on his neck in such a way that I knew he would not be standing, while the uni student collided with the wall of the toilets with such force that when she slumped over, it seemed like some of her bones were no longer there. The other pair, well I still can’t decide how they died, they were drawn towards the beast by its vines, and then held to its chest which, somehow, opened and they simply disappeared into its hollow.

At this point, it briefly turned to me, before shifting its focus to the remaining university student, who stood at the water’s edge with the teen she rescued. It was at this point that I realised two teens had gone into the water, but ostensibly only one had made it out - the tree-man look a slow step towards them, but ultimately altered its course and returned to its spot by the edge of the pond amongst the other willows, reforming into a tree with the snap of some branches and a low moan. The shivering pair near the pond, noting their crumpled comrades, hurried towards the bodies - but I knew better. The supernatural never leaves a trace. The corpses stood, moving as if puppets, and wandered towards the pond, ignoring the pleas and tugs of their friends. A third corpse - the missing teen, emerged from the water and embraced the other two. As we watched on, the three corpses contorted and twisted and changed into a full-grown weeping willow, limbs contorted and whip-like branches hanging down to dance their tips along the water’s surface.



While the teenager and university student wept for the loss of their friends, and then called the police, I stood and left - not wanting to be caught in a police interview for an inexplicable event. At home, I did some precursory research - I believe the tree-entity to be what is called a *hamadyrad*, a type of tree spirit mentioned in Greek Mythology. However, for ease of memory, I elect to call it the Willow Man. 

I also kept an eye on the news. When the story broke two days later, it is alleged that the missing people had fled to join an unknown cult, and the surviving witnesses had hallucinated the entire experience due to the deliriant drugs used in an effort to convert them as well. Sadly, the next day, murder-suicide also took place between newlyweds, with a note left by the husband claiming that they had been at the park that evening but had clearly also been exposed to the deliriants as they had recurring nightmares of humanoid trees killing them in their homes.

Near everyone in the town also all distinctly remember the new willow has having always been there, and somehow in every photo of the park, the spot which should have shown empty space instead of a willow was obscured by perspective or the people in the photos - rendering it impossible to prove the *lack* of a tree previously.



I returned, some days later, to the park and investigated both trees, but there was nothing to indicate that either of them were anything other than a plain old willow tree.
