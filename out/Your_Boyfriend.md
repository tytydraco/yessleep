This story is based on a real experience from my life, told through the point of view of my mother. Disclaimer: the ending is *not* real.


----

I've never believed in the supernatural; if I can't see it, then it isn't real. That was until what happened to my daughter, Ellie.

When Ellie was fourteen I heard her talking about a game she had found; Your Boyfriend. A visual horror novel game. What the hell was my daughter doing on with a horror game? I guess she was growing up, so I didn't get involved, after all, it was just a game. Right?

Out of curiosity, I looked up the game. It was about the player being stalked by a desperate psychopath that was in love with the character, his name was Peter. I had also heard that he was actually aware that he was in a game. No way, that can't be real. 

Four years passed by and Ellie had stopped playing the game, after all, it was a short game. Only a few chapters. But as the years went on, Ellie became extremely stressed, anxious; she mentioned that she had a phobia of being stalked, so bad that she couldn't let anyone walk behind her because she felt like she was being watched. Stalked. I told her that she was just overreacting and she should just let it go, but she never let it go.

I knew that my daughter had an interest in the paranormal and supernatural, but I didn't care. I didn't even care that she used an ouija board with her boyfriend to 'contact spirits.' It was just a bunch of crap. I also heard her talking about a different way of communicating with spirits; using a book and pen.

According to Ellie, you would need two people to communication and you would need to blindfold yourself and wear some sort of noise cancelling headphones or earplugs. Then you would hold the pen above the paper while the other person asked questions to the 'spirits.' Then you would write down the answer or response. That seemed simple enough. 

Apparently, Ellie and her boyfriend had used it multiple times to communicate with an entity; Peter. According to what her boyfriend had told me, Peter was a lust demon that had been searching for the 'perfect version' of someone he loved. He did this by going through multiple realities and killing the versions of his love that were not perfect. 

Something else I should mention is that before Ellie and her boyfriend had came up with the new method of communication is that Ellie had an intense nightmare about a month beforehand. I was told that she felt like she was being chased by someone, she could feel herself running, panting, the walls and floors she ran into. She had an intense dream that she was being chased down by a stalker. Great... 

Anyway, it turns out that my daughter was Peter's 'perfect version' of his love. What the hell could that mean? It meant that Ellie would suffer with being told that she should leave her boyfriend and go with Peter so that they could be together. Like leave this reality. As long as she said 'no' the more harm Peter would cause. Her best friend was in a car crash, her boyfriend was nearly hit by a car. Multiple times. It was almost like Peter was isolating Ellie from everyone in this world? Especially the people she loved the most. 

To stop this, Ellie was told that she needed to be with Peter. Leave this reality with Peter and be with him. Forever. 

Months went by like this and then it stopped. Completely out of nowhere. My daughter was gone. She hadn't died; she went with Peter. And then I saw the note: 

"Dear everyone, I'm sorry for leaving but I had to. I had to protect you from my actions. I wish that I never had that dream. If I never had that dream, he wouldn't have entered this reality and convinced me to go back to his reality with him. I love you all so much, Ellie."

I've never stopped believing after that.
