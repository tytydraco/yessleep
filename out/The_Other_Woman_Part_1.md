The story I’m about to tell began as the best day of my life and ended as the worst. It's the day the hole opened in my front yard.



I’m going to tell you everything as truthfully as possible. Even the uncomfortable parts. Not because I’m trying to convince you, not because I think the world will be better for it, but to prove to myself that I’m not ashamed.



\---------------------------------------------------------------------------



“So… take it out,” Chloe mumbled against my lips.



“Right away.” I fumbled with my belt for three years before the buckle gave way.



If I had known Chloe was coming over I would have changed my boxers. But that Friday night went like this: my dad pulled out of the driveway for his weekend work trip (to New Orleans, or Hartford, or something like that), I put a movie on TV, and then I heard this knock on the door. I answered, and a girl was there. Chloe. Like she beamed down from a UFO. She didn’t say anything, just kissed me. One thing led to another, and… 



Now I was stuck wearing cowboy-print boxers like a toddler. I ripped them off as quickly as humanly possible and tossed them into the laundry bin. They flopped onto the lip on full display. She glanced over at them and giggled. Then she glanced down and giggled again. 



With everything happening so suddenly, I was basically numb at that point. Like… Chloe wasn’t my girlfriend. According to everything I knew about anything, dating was a prerequisite to intercourse. That’s how it worked for my Mom and Dad. But partaking in intercourse requires the assumption of risk, and my parents paid the price: they had me at 22. I, on the other hand, had no intention of repeating their mistake. I didn’t waste energy chasing girls. I had long since relegated myself to graduating high school a virgin. And yeah, I’ll be completely honest, it’s not like it was fully my choice. The dweeby hobbies, lack of athleticism, and crooked teeth certainly didn’t help. But still, in violation of every law of nature and a complete lack of effort on my part, Chloe had appeared on my doorstep. 



She was a vision. I surveyed the little stick-and-poke tattoos along her ribcage and upper arms. I couldn’t detect an ounce of nervousness on her face; just a faint smile and an eager glint in her eyes. She terrified me.



Now, she was moving closer, and it was really about to happen. My brain screamed at my body not to screw it up but… I never even got the chance.



**BOOM**!



The house shook so hard that Chloe stumbled down onto her knees and I fell back onto the bed. My *The* *Dark Knight* poster clattered to the ground. One of my succulents shattered. Dust and debris tinged against my second-floor window like a rain shower. Then it was quiet again.



“What the fuck?” Chloe shouted. “What the fuck *was* that? Was that a car?”



I ran over to the window butt naked and peered down. It was difficult to see anything through the red dirt that coated the glass. I was breathing hard. My… member had fully turtled, and all sexual heat between Chloe and I had gone stone cold. 



The porch light was still on, and I could see the dust whirling around as it settled. In my panic I convinced myself I could see shapes moving in the maelstrom; figures crawling on the ground, slinking away into the night, slipping beneath the porch.



“I don’t know. I’ll go down and check.”



Chloe nodded. She was already putting her shirt back on. I didn’t even mourn the loss of my chance; it felt natural, like being woken from a good dream by my alarm. Of course it wouldn’t happen.



I threw some shorts on and crept downstairs. It was even more quiet down there. The Transformers movie I had on before Chloe showed up had turned off automatically. A lamp beside my dad’s armchair was the only light source, and its yellow warmth shined off everything: the pots and pans swaying where they hung on their steel rack, the scuffed hardwood flooring, and the picture frames lining every shelf that I hardly looked at anymore.



Just as I reached the bottom of the stairs, I heard something: 



*Knock Knock*.



It sounded like it came from the front door.



“Chloe?” I hollered, my eyes flicking between the top of the steps where I could still see the overhead light of my room and the front door. The lamplight wasn’t enough to illuminate the door handle, but I thought I saw it turning.



My breath quickened. 



For whatever reason, more than fear, I felt caught. I felt embarrassed. One looming image spawned immediately and brilliantly in my mind: on the other side of the door, a dark creature, nothing more than a shape, was breathing against the peephole, watching me, its hands working at the handle, in no rush at all, just laughing and laughing to itself because it saw everything–the juvenile first kisses, the awkward hand placements, the underwear, the untrimmed pubic hair, the cringy questions, the naive excitement on my stupid face–and now it was about to break down that door and let the world in.



I was vulnerable and panicked. I couldn’t move.



*Knock Knock*. It came again.



“What?” Chloe hissed. I jumped out of my skin. She was a silhouette at the top of the stairs.



“Eli, who the fuck is here right now? Is it your dad?”



“I… I don’t know,” I muttered. I swallowed and finally moved to answer the door.



Chloe watched me but said nothing.



I reassured myself that it was probably a neighbor checking on the noise. Our closest neighbor lived two miles away, but… it *was* a pretty loud crash, after all. And it’s not like we lived out in the sticks. There were some thin trees in the way, but you could see the main road from the house. Maybe someone passing by saw the debris from… whatever that was.



My bare feet plodded along the hardwood until I reached the peep hole. 



I squinted and looked. Against all sense, I felt certain something horrible would be there looking back.



But it was nothing. No one was standing on the porch at all.



“I don’t see anything,” I shouted.



Chloe didn’t answer. I stepped back and looked up again, but she was gone. Bathroom, maybe. I felt like pissing, myself.



I thumbed the deadbolt, swung the door open, and stepped onto the porch.



It was a muggy August night. Despite the sun having gone down hours before, strands of hair adhered themselves to my forehead immediately, and patches of damp appeared along my shorts moments later.



The air was still dusty. The dim porch lights and the poor visibility allowed me to see only as far as the porch steps. I had no shirt to cover my face, so I measured my breathing.



“Hello?” I cried. I didn’t plan on doing that, and I regretted it immediately. I was terrified there would be an answer.



I heard only the quiet din of the crickets and frogs.



The porch was a wraparound, but I had no intention of making a full loop around the property. If someone was sneaking, they wouldn’t knock, and if they weren’t here now, they must have left when no one answered. The logic of a coward.



On my left was the window to my mom’s old office. It was open. I shook my head and sighed.



“No, Dad, it’s fine, I’ll close every door, I’ll shut every window, I’ll turn off every light. You just relax, king. Perhaps a beer, my liege?”



I shut the window tight. I lingered there for just a moment, peering inside.



By the porchlight I could make out some of the knickknacks my mom kept on her desk: the Russell Westbrook bobblehead I got her (mostly for myself) when I was 12, the oxymoronic Everglades National Park snowglobe from our family trip, and the dozens of pens, notepads, and highlighters scattered in a colorful mess. I never really went into that room anymore. I had long since taken all of her plants out of there and put them in my room. I was waiting for my dad to do something with her things, but he seemed content to keep the office as it was. Not even as a preservation of her memory or anything; he just didn’t give a crap.



The rest of the porchlights, along with the floodlights for the yard, suddenly flashed on.



I jumped and let out an embarrassing yelp. 



Chloe swung open the door and stepped out onto the porch with me. She was gazing out into the yard.



“Scared me,” I laughed nervously, slicking my hair back. “I was actually just about to turn on the floodlights myself, but...”



She was wearing a cami and a pair of my athletic shorts she must have grabbed from my drawer. Chloe was an acquaintance (in that we sat next to each other in a couple classes), and she was kinda cute, but before that night, I had never really thought of her as a candidate for… you know. Something about seeing a woman naked really ignites a flame in your chest.



“Eli?” she said. Her eyes widened. They were dark brown and almond shaped. Chestnut hair, cherry lips, almond eyes… I was already planning a poem for her. “Trail Mix,” I would call it, and I would write it for her all in one night, and she would fall in love with it and with me, and we would be together. Yeah, she was kind of weird, and she posted cryptic memes on her insta, and she was always sneaking out at night to explore the sewers or break into abandoned buildings, and every time I talked to her she had a new hyperfixation she had doodled and stickered all over her notebooks, and–



“Eli, turn the fuck around,” she barked, and shoved my shoulder hard. I spun towards the yard.



Under that harsh fluorescent light, what remained of the front lawn of my house was now an archeological dig site. It was completely collapsed. Chloe and I staggered forward, each step revealing more hanging tatters of sod, more stone, more glinting metal wires and pipes, until the bottom of the pit appeared, too deep for the light to reach, strange and red and dark like the surface of Mars.



There was a smell that wandered now in the dark air like the sharp tang of an opened cask of wine. It was the sweet funk of dirt atop a festering undercurrent of spoiled meat and eggs.



“Holy crap,” I muttered. “I gotta call my Dad.”



I shouldered past Chloe on my way to the landline in the kitchen. She hardly seemed to notice I left.

  


He picked up on the third ring.



“Yuh?” he grumbled.



“Did I wake you up?”



“Eli… what’s goin’ on?” I definitely woke him up. I think he might have been drinking that night, too. I could hear it in his voice.



“Sorry Dad. Um… well, we–I, sorry, I heard a huge crash outside, like a massive crash, and there was all this dirt kicked up, and I go downstairs and turn the floodlights on, and there’s this giant hole in the ground outside. The whole yard is like *completely* gone… like seriously, the yard is totally swallowed–”



“Slow down, slow down. What the hell are you talking about?”



“I don’t know what happened. I think it was a sinkhole. The yard collapsed somehow and now there’s this huge crater in front of the house. What should I do?”



There was silence for a moment.



“The front yard?” he said finally.



“Yeah, the front yard. You gotta come back, Dad. I’m gonna call the cops, but I think you should come back home, if you can, please.”



“Do not call the police,” he demanded. His voice was stern and sober. “Do *not* call the god damn police. Do you understand?”



“Okay. Alright, I won’t. Sorry.”



Silence.



“I’ll be home as soon as I can tomorrow. I have a meeting in the afternoon and I’ll be back in the evening. You think you can handle yourself for 24 hours?”



“Yeah, I can.”



“You’re not hurt are you?”



“No, Dad, I’m fine. But… what if the house falls in too? Is it safe for me to be here?”



He sighed like the weight of sleep was falling back over him. “Eli, it’s gonna be fine. If the house was gonna fall in, it woulda done that already.”



“Um… I guess you’re right.” I didn’t find that logic very comforting.



“Watch bed, go to a movie–uh… you know what I meant. Listen, just wait for me to come home. Okay? I’ll handle it.”



“Okay.”



“It’s just you at the house, right? No guests?”



“Yep. Just me.”



“Good. I hope it stays that way. I’ll be back soon.”



“Thanks, Dad. This is crazy stuff,” I laughed.



“Ha, yeah, buddy, sounds like it. Stay out of the hole, m’kay? It sounds dangerous. What knows who’s in there.”



“Yeah,” I said, my laugh faltering. “I will.”



“See you tomorrow, bud. Sleep tight.”



“Sleep tight,” I mumbled, and racked the phone with a click.



When I stepped back out onto the porch, Chloe was nowhere to be found.



“Chloe?” I shouted. No response.



I stepped forward. That’s when I saw her.



On the edge of the hole closest to the porch, there was a mound of dirt that created a steep ramp to the bottom. Chloe was descending into the sinkhole.



“What the *hell* are you doing?” I hissed. She was wearing flip-flops for God’s sake.



She looked back at me and blinked. “Is that a trick question?”



“You’re going to kill yourself in there. Here, give me your hand, I’ll help you out,” I pleaded as I sidled up to the edge of the hole and extended my arm.



Chloe reached out to my hand. She didn’t take it, though. She fist-bumped it.



“I’m good, Mom. Thanks though.”



She turned back and continued her descent. 



I stood in anxious silence and watched. At certain points, she had to press her chest against the slope and find a foothold like she was rock climbing–that’s how steep it was. Then, she finally submerged into the darkness.



If she fell, what was I supposed to do? Call the police? I had no clue what reasons Dad had to protest the idea so adamantly, but I’m sure they were good ones. Insurance. City ordinance. Utility bill. Some other adult word I knew but did not entirely understand. 



I had no intention of breaking the promise I made to Dad, but if Chloe got hurt, all bets were off.



I paced back and forth, wringing my hands, until I heard Chloe let out a little “Whoo!” to let me know her feet were on solid ground. I exhaled in relief.



“You made it?” I called.



“Duh!” Her voice echoed just a little bit. I felt like a search-and-rescue team calling down to a survivor.



“Do you think you can climb back out?” 



“My arms and legs work just as well now as they did on the way down, Eli.”



I heard her shuffling around in the rubble down there. I could discern her shadow moving if I leaned over the lip, but I wasn’t very confident in the security of the ground at that moment, so I mostly just listened.



I looked around in the night. Everything else seemed normal. There was a cool updraft coming from the sinkhole, like the exhalation of a glacial cave. It was a breath from heaven on such a horrible humid night, but… the stink that had once been an undercurrent was now cloying, and though it was almost certainly the product of an inscrutable chemical process from within the earth, the smell still struck me as something terrible and even sinister.



After a couple minutes of silence, my curiosity got the best of me, and I dared to lean into the smell once again.



“See anything cool?” I cried. Chloe had wandered over to the left wall of the hole, and it looked like she was rubbing her hands along the surface.



“What’s that?” I asked again. She paid me no mind. I could hear crumbles of dirt pattering the ground as she excavated something.



Faintly, I heard her gag.



“Chloe? Hey, don’t dig like that, you could–”



A large chunk of rock and dirt broke free from the sinkhole’s lip and tumbled to the bottom, right beside where Chloe was standing. Her shadow was obscured in dust.



“Chloe! Holy shit, are you okay?”



No answer. My heart thudded in my ears.



“Hey! Chloe!”



I heard coughing. Then, a weak voice: “I’m alright!”



“Jesus Christ, get the hell out of there!” I demanded. This time, she listened.



Chloe emerged from the dust and made her way up the incline. When she passed back into the light, I saw that clothes were covered in red dust and sweat, her arms were bleeding, and roots and pebbles were tangled in her hair.



“Are you okay?” I asked. She climbed with urgency and said nothing. 



When she was close enough, I extended my hand and pulled her up.



“Thanks,” Chloe muttered, and shouldered right past me.



“I don’t mean to say I told you so, but…”



She didn’t laugh. She just made her way inside. I followed behind her.



“Chloe, what’s wrong? Are you actually okay or… did you see something?”



She swung the door open and grabbed her purse. Then she turned around in a huff.



“I’m fine. Okay? I know, that was stupid, and it freaked me out, but I’m fine. And no, I didn’t see anything. It’s a fucking hole in the ground, just like we thought. Happy?”



Oh. She was mad at me. My stomach dropped. 



Chloe didn’t wait for an answer. She stormed upstairs to grab her clothes. Not knowing what else to do, I followed after her.



“Thank God it didn’t swallow my fucking car,” she muttered to herself.



I stood in the door to my bedroom wondering what the sudden hurry to leave was about. She took off my now filthy shorts and put her jeans back on. Then she stripped her sweat-soaked cami, careful to cover her chest like I didn’t see everything half an hour before, and grabbed a t-shirt from my drawer.



“I’ll give these back before our first class in the parking lot. Cool?” she asked rhetorically.



“Chloe… I think you owe me an explanation.”



She considered that for a second. Then she sighed deeply.



“Sorry, Eli. I acted on an impulse. I do it all the time, but obviously, the universe didn’t want this to happen. Sorry about your lawn, but I need to go home. I suggest you call the police or the city or whatever.” The nonchalance of her tone was brutal.



She walked past me into the upstairs bathroom. When she saw the dirt all over her face and in her hair, she groaned in exasperation.



“So… we just pretend this never happened?” I asked. I tried to seem as indifferent as possible.



“Yeah. Please, don’t make a big deal out of this, okay? I’m already embarrassed enough.” Chloe splashed sink water on her face and raked her fingers through her hair.



She was embarrassed? What, embarrassed I saw her shirtless, or embarrassed that she ever even considered sleeping with me? I had a feeling it was both.



Shame burned my cheeks. I was just another late night adventure gone wrong. 



I followed her downstairs and leaned against the wall as she put her shoes on.



I remembered her giggle when I pulled my boxers down. I prayed she would hold up her end of the bargain and keep this whole thing between us, for my sake.



I also remembered that knock at the door, and the ocean of shame that had washed over me where fear was supposed to be. I felt the fear now, though. I didn’t want Chloe to leave me here alone. But what kind of creep would I be to make her stay? She didn’t owe me anything.



“I’m just glad you’re safe,” was all I managed to say.



Chloe broke her fixation on her laces to look up at me. 



“You’re a sweet guy Eli, but I’m technically still with Ryan, even though we took a break, and I’m already thinking about dropping out this semester because of that bitch Mrs. McKane, and… it’s just not gonna work, you know?”



“Yeah, no, I understand,” I mumbled as I took my turn to stare at my shoes.



She stood up to leave.



I didn’t want things to end on this awkward, frantic note. Plus, I didn’t really feel like being alone quite yet.



“Let me walk you to your car,” I offered. Chloe hesitated, but she seemed to remember the massive hole outside and agreed.



We had to walk along the rim of the sinkhole to reach the driveway. My Ford F150 was parked a mere three feet from the lip. A sizable edge of the gravel driveway had been eaten by the pit. The whole scene was like a nuclear test site. Chloe and I both stared at the carnage as we made our way to her car.



“This is freaking insane, man,” I remarked.



“Yeah,” Chloe chuckled. “It’s like getting struck by lightning. I’ve never heard of a sinkhole around here.”



“You think there’s caves or something under the property?”



“I don’t know. Maybe. It smells like sulphur down there at the bottom.”



We reached her car.



“Welp… this is me,” she said. “Thanks for walking me. Very gentlemanly of you.”



“Of course.” In keeping with her assessment, I opened the car door for her too.



“Alright, don’t push it,” she teased. I smiled. Thank God the awkwardness had eased up. I doubted we would ever be friends after all this, much less a couple, but at least now I could stomach talking to her in class.



“You can’t drop out, by the way,” I said seriously. “You’re like the only person I know in 4th period. And you’re too smart for that.”



“Relax, dude, I’m not dropping out,” Chloe laughed. “But I am going home now. Thanks again for the duds.”



“No problem,” I said, waving it off. “Anytime.”



“Later, Eli.”



Chloe closed the door and turned the engine over. I stepped back. She waved at me through the window.



I waved back, but… something was eating at me. I needed an answer before I let her leave.



Chloe was nearly done turning her car around to leave when I flagged her down.



She rolled down her window and I jogged over to her.



“Hey, uh… what were you digging at down there?”



A pang of nerves flashed over Chloe’s face for a second. I hadn’t seen that expression on her before. Then it was gone, and she rolled her eyes and smirked.



“Oh, yeah. I don’t know, there was a gopher hole or something that was blocked by rocks, and I thought I saw something in it. Buried treasure, probably,” she joked.



“What did it look like?” I asked.



“Oh, it’s whatever, it was just a rock. I’m pretty sure it was a rock.”



“Okay, but… what did it *look* like?” I repeated.



Her face soured a little.



“Like a high heel. Like a red, women’s heel.”



We both stood in silence for a second.



“Thanks,” I muttered, and waved goodbye again.



She rolled up her window, and soon her taillights were snuffed out by the night. And I was alone again.
