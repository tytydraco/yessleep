I found something in my tool bag. 

V issues our bags, and i’ve used the same one for the entire 6 years I’ve worked here, so I know exactly what’s supposed to be in it.

A few hours ago, I was digging through the bag looking for a specific hex key for the Kit48 dining set, when my fingers hit something bulky at the bottom. It was rectangular and hard, but it was sewn *into* the lining of the bag.

I’ve never felt it there before.

I took a box cutter and sliced the interior fabric. 

It was a book. 

A thick, spiral bound manual of some sort, with a lifeless grey cover titled: **\[Company Name\]: On Site Optimisation Log.** 

I’ve seen the standard assembly guides a thousand times. This was something else. 

I flipped to the section for Kit48, and the instructions were… oddly scientific.

It said things like, the coffee table must be placed at the exact intersection of the floorboards in the primary living space, the floor lamp must be angled at 14 degrees relative to magnetic North. The convection oven timer has a specific frequency setting, and that the button should be held down for ten seconds until the display flashes a code: 48.

I didn’t know what any of that meant. But it had been a really weird week and clearly I was feeling reckless, so I decided to follow what the book said. 

I used a laser level to line up the sofa, a compass on my phone to find magnetic North for the lamp, and I set the oven ‘frequency’ just like it said.

It took about an hour to get it all right. 

But nothing happened. It was pretty anticlimactic actually.

I carried on with the stage as I normally would, and as I added the finishing touches, I started to feel weird. My vision started to lag, and when I turned my head to look from the kitchen to the living room, the furniture seemed to take a microsecond to appear. 

It felt like the world around me was moving slower, or my eyes were processing things faster. The rosemary smell from the oven felt like, I don’t know how to describe it, like it was *physically* in the air. 

I became very aware I was breathing it in and it was filling my lungs. 

It only lasted a few minutes before things went back to normal, so in the moment, I put it down to stress. Things *have* been weird as fuck lately, and there are bound to be some side effects. 

I was coming to the end of the stage, and walked into the living room to take the final photos. 

But when I looked out the window, the coastline was gone.

I stepped closer and pressed my forehead to the glass. 

A flat, white hot desert stretched to the horizon. The sun was a blinding white eye in a bright, cloudless sky. It looked like it was midday.

I'm in Maine. It was 2pm.

I unlocked the sash and pushed the window open. 

Heat poured into the room and hit my face. It was like opening an oven door. 

I let my right hand drift outside, and watched it start to burn in real time. My left arm, still inside, remained cold. 

I slammed the window shut and locked it. 

My breath was visible in the cold air of the cottage, but the desert sun still shone through the glass. 

I grabbed the manual and left. 

Back in the van, I went through the manual again. I couldn’t find any author details, or department names, but there was a list of, what I assume to be, ID numbers. I don’t want to include too much detail here, but they all start with ’48’, followed by a string of letters. There’s also a section called ‘validation credits’, which I’ve never heard of in my life. 

I tried calling Madey, but her phone was still going straight to voicemail.

So I called Donna. 

Donna was in the same batch as me and Madey. We started together, trained together, and we all work with Kit48. We’ve always been close, as close as you can be when you’re physically miles apart. 

She picked up on the third ring.

Her voice sounded different. Flat, and monotone. Not the joyous voice I remembered. Donna is usually full of life and bursting to speak, always filling the silence. 

I made small talk for a few minutes, then asked if V had started installing new high tech windows. 

I expected her to laugh at that. We both know V doesn’t spend money on anything it doesn’t have to.

She went quiet for a few seconds, then said:

“What did you see?”

That threw me, because that's a a really odd response to that question. So I didn’t say anything.

In the exact same cadence and tone, she repeated:

“What did you see?”

I couldn’t think of a single normal response to that, so I lied and said “nothing”. Then I asked if she’d spoken to Madey. 

She said she’d spoken to her yesterday, and when I asked her how, she said on her cell. 

I’ve tried calling Madey multiple times, at different times of the day, but it goes straight to voicemail. I’ve also sent messages but they all still show as undelivered. 

I think Donna lied to me. But I don’t know why. 

Something doesn’t feel right. 

I’m going to see what I can find on the V employee portal. If these IDs link to people, I want names. And if this manual was stitched into my bag, I think someone wanted me to find it.

No time lost today. As far as I know.
