Hi Everyone  
I have a story, it's not really scary, but it is creepy, and what does make it even creepier and odd is that this is true.  
So my partner and myself lived in a rental in  the suburb of New Farm, which is an inner city suburb of Brisbane in Queensland Australia.  
There were 3 things that happened, 1 quite creepy, one just imagination creepy and then the really odd thing.  
1. My partner had little magnetic words that were on the fridge. So you could take the magnets and write little messages. This was back in around 2006 and she still smoked back then (gave up a long time ago now thankfully).  
One day she is siting in her chair on the little entry landing to have a cigarette and looks down and the magnetic word "leave" is beside her chair. She got grumpy at me (we don't really ever fight) for almost losing one of her words. I was like, "wasn't me" but as I often take the marker pen and scissors from the kitchen and forget to return them, she didn't believe me. Until a few days later when she found "leave" beside her chair again.  
2. The type of creepy thing. My computer desk was down stair (I will cover the floor plans later) and it was dark down there with not many windows. I would go in to turn on the light and my computer chair would have this dense darkness on it that would sometimes make me double take thinking someone was sitting in my chair.  
3. The really weird thing. So this house we rented was a type called a Queenslander. They were built raised because of frequent flooding back in the day, and to cool the houses in the heat, but as the storm water infrastructure improved, and air-conditioning,  many people closed these spaces in to make another level (really cheaply). So this space had a large main room, a little closed area for the laundry and a small bedroom with a single bed we didn't use.  
The ceiling for down stairs is just the upstairs floor boards, not closed in so you could see the wood and the cross beam supports.  
So sometimes I would find a puddle of water on the cement floor and assumed it was just coming from the bathroom upstairs. One day when I was at my computer, water started to  flow from the ceiling boards, over a beam, and onto the floor, at a rate of say a slow pour from a 2 litre jug. I yelled out to my partner, think she had left a tap on or had the cats knocked something over. She runs about and says no. I'm thinking has a pipe split in a wall upstairs, so I pop a bit of paper up through the floor (the water had also stopped by this time) and my partner is like "erm that just in our bedroom". So I fold the paper a bit, poke it up and go look and sure enough, there it is, about a half meter in our main bedroom, with no place for the water to come from. the board dry, no sign of water.  
I looked at the beam downstairs the water had flowed over, and you could see the beam had water damage, that had been painted over in some reno before we turned up, and the paint was damaged, so this happened on the regular.  
I told my friends (who are all scientists and architects and business type and got roundly teased for being silly. One day when my architect friend was over, I told her to come have a look. I showed her the damage, poked a bit of paper up and took her upstairs, her response "huh?"  
The house is goner now many years, we had been forced to move as the council was laying new storm water pipes. I wonder if the new house built there has the weird water portal and single word ghost still.   


There you go.
