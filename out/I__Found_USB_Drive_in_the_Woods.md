I never should have picked it up.

It was just sitting there, half-buried in the decaying leaves along the trail. A simple black USB drive with no markings, no identification. I figured someone had dropped it while hiking. Maybe there'd be contact information on it so I could return it.

That night, I plugged it into my old laptop—never my main computer, I'm not completely careless. Just a single folder appeared, containing a video file named "WATCH_ME.mp4". Classic horror movie setup, right? I laughed at myself for hesitating. It was probably just vacation photos or something.

The video showed a forest that looked exactly like the one where I'd found the drive. Eerily similar, down to the distinctive bent oak tree I always pass about two miles in. The footage was shaky, clearly handheld, following the same trail I walk daily. No big deal. Probably just another hiker.

Then I noticed the timestamp in the corner: tomorrow's date.

A chill ran through me as the camera approached my usual resting spot—the fallen log where I always stop for water. The camera lingered there, then panned slowly upward to reveal a figure standing motionless among the trees in the distance.

It was me. Wearing the exact clothes I had laid out for tomorrow morning.

I slammed the laptop shut, my heart pounding. I'm not superstitious, but this was too specific to be coincidence. 

I tried to rationalize it. Maybe someone had been stalking me, learning my habits. That was somehow less terrifying than the alternative.

I deleted the video and formatted the drive. I even took a hammer to it before throwing it in the trash. I changed my hiking plans, choosing a different trail on the opposite side of town for my morning walk.

As I hiked the new trail, I felt silly for letting a video frighten me so badly. The morning was beautiful, birds singing, sun filtering through the leaves. I rounded a bend and froze.

There was my fallen log. The same bent oak tree. Somehow, taking a completely different path, I'd ended up in the exact spot from the video.

My phone buzzed with a text notification. Unknown number.

"Look up."

I didn't want to. Every instinct screamed at me to run. But my body betrayed me as my head slowly tilted upward.

There, standing among the trees, was a figure. Not me this time.

It was holding a camera, pointed directly at me.

I ran. I ran until my lungs burned and my legs gave out. When I finally made it home, I locked every door and window. I called the police, but they found nothing. "Just kids playing pranks," they said.

That was three days ago. I haven't left my house since.

But an hour ago, I received an email. No text in the body. Just an attachment.

A video file named "WATCH_ME_2.mp4"

The timestamp shows tomorrow's date.

I can see myself through my bedroom window, looking out at something in my backyard.

I've closed all the blinds. Locked myself in the bathroom. But I can't stop thinking about what I saw in those final frames of the video.

My back door, slowly opening from the inside.

I never left it unlocked.

And I live alone.

Wait. 

Did you hear that?
