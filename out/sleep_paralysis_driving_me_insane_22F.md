I've been getting sleep paralysis since a kid but the past 2 years (especially the past few months) have been crazy, I don't sleep for for days sometimes. I'm so tired all the time cause I can't sleep peacefully. I've tried melatonin, nightlights, even giving my room and house a cleanse. 
I've seen many things and voices when having sleep paralysis, and also have had these things physically touch me (aggressively). I wake up with fear,  panic and goosebumps all over my body everytime. I'll list the things I've seen while having these "episodes" (if that's what they even are)

- baby on the edge of my bed
-a man with an all white tight suit, head to toe, including fitted mask with a red patch on his mask on the right side.
-a girl or woman with black hair, who covers her face with it and wears a grungey type gown/dress
(She grabbed me by my wrist)
- a black figure hovering over me (while seeing flashes of white light)

Just 2 weeks ago I was sleeping in bed, face down on my stomach. (I don't sleep on my back) and I felt like someone got into bed with me and I genuinely just thought it was my sister in law since we live together. I remember looking over and this woman was sitting next to me with black hair and white gown. She had her back towards me while she sat on my bed by my feet. That's when I felt I couldn't move. It felt like someone was on my back pinning me down while they held my wrist down to my bed. I started hearing this woman whispering in my right ear but couldn't understand what she was saying. Then I was out of it and again that feeling of panic/fear and goosebumps took over my whole body.
 
It's to the point it's affecting my mental and physical health. I'd love to get help but where do you get help for something like this.. it's also to the point that it happens even when I just try to take a quick little nap, I can't rest and I feel myself getting more drained everyday .
 
Idk if I'll get answers here but it feels nice being able to talk about it to someone at least 

Last week as well I was sleeping (stomach down) and I felt someone come into my room, (me and my sister in law live together but I was home alone this time.) I heard her soft  voice "chelis wake up hey" (chelis is my nickname) and I couldn't move or see because the way I slept my blanket and pillow was covering my eyes (I was very cold that day.) And I tried to respond to her that I couldn't move and couldn't see her cause the stuff in my face and that's when it got super quiet and I tried moving and I couldn't thays when I felt this force like someone was tryna ragdoll my body, grabbing me from my back and hitting me with an aggressive scary sounding voice basically screaming at me "i said wake up chelis wake up wake up wake up" I couldn't see what or who that was . Scared me for a good time
