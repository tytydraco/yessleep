After the Army, I felt lost, unsure of what to do with myself or my life. I had joined up at the ripe age of 18, spending most of my illustrious 10-year career and my 3 tours in Afghanistan as a Military Working Dog Handler. After we pulled out of Afghanistan, however, with my current contract coming to an end, I felt that my time had come to move on, that I had done my part, but I just didn't know what it was I was supposed to be moving on to.



So, I drifted. With no real family or home to go back to, I bought a van and hit the road, saw the country. 



I bought a Belgian Malinois pup as well, which I named Rowdy, from an ex-military guy I knew. He had also worked as a Dog Handler, and now specifically bred and trained working dogs for people who wanted the real deal. 



Over the course of the next several months, Rowdy and I went on many great adventures together. We saw the Grand Canyon and Niagara Falls. We camped out in Tahoe, Yellowstone, and Yosemite. All the while, our bond growing, as did Rowdy himself, and my extensive training with him paid off as he grew into a model working dog, and my best friend.



It wasn't long, however, until our traveling adventures began digging deep into my savings, and I knew we would have to settle down someplace soon before I went broke. So, that's when we made our way to Alaska. I had always pictured myself settling down there, in the last frontier, but didn't exactly know where, or what I would do for work.



We again drifted for a time, but this time, in the confines of the state, with the express goal of finding our new home. And eventually, we did just that.



The coastal town of Pike's Head Cove was perhaps the smallest I'd ever been to, with only a population of 182 people at the time of our arrival. There was only 3 ways in or out of the town, North and South tunnels carved through the mountains that bordered it, and by sea travel. It had one market, one mechanic's shop, one 24 hour diner that also served as the town bar or a place to rent a room for the night if the misses locked you out after a bender, and practically nothing else, as their economy completely consisted off the fishing trade.



You see, the town received its name for two reasons. One, that from an aerial view, the shape of the town and the cove it had developed around resembled the head of an open mouthed Pike. Two, that the cove itself and the section of the Arctic Sea beyond were mysteriously filled with a seemingly endless supply of Northern Pike.



Upon arriving in this town, I completely fell in love. I loved the quiet seclusion of it, the hardworking and welcoming nature of its people, and the cold sea that bordered it. So, I decided to make it my home.



I found a small house to rent. It had been left unoccupied for the better part of 2 years, as I had been the first person to move into town in that long.



Then, one night, I managed to corral the local fishing Captain of a vessel named the Helmsman, Captain Burke, a burly and grey bearded man, for drinks at the town diner, The Cove's Respite. 



We talked some about my military service and his, he was ex-Navy, and I emphasized throughout the night my passion for fishing, and how I was looking for work. This was mostly true, as I was an avid fisherman, even having been deep sea fishing a handful of times in my life, although I had no work experience in the field.



Several whiskeys into the night, Captain Burke finally relented, offering me a spot aboard his crew, under the condition that I prove myself capable of handling the job over a short trial period. I had to assume he had only done so given the fact that I was a military man, but work in town had been secured for me regardless.



That was also the night that I met Rachel. She was a beautiful brown haired woman in her late twenties that worked as a waitress, bartender, dish washer, basically whatever was needed of her at The Cove's Respite.



Upon seeing the banter and looks the two of us had been sharing over the course of the night, Captain Burke assured me that she was single, and that I should ask her out. 



So, I did.  



The next few months passed by in a breeze. I proved myself, through trial and error, among the crew of the Helmsman, and Captain Burke assured me a more permanent position within its ranks. My relationship with Rachel developed quickly, though maturely, and it looked as though it could be one that went the distance. I even began decorating my home and settling in, something I had never really had the chance to do before in my adult life.



Everything was going smooth as could be, until one day, aboard the Helmsman, I reeled in a Pike, only to drop it in horror at the sight of what was inside its open mouth. Where the Pike's tongue should have been, a white bug-like creature wriggled around in its place, staring back at me with tiny beady black eyes. 



"What the shit is that!?" I exclaimed, pointing to the sickly thin looking Pike that wriggled about on the floor before me.



Captain Burke took notice and stomped over, grabbing ahold of the fish by the base of its head with one meaty paw of a hand and lifting it to eye level. "A Fish Louse," he said matter of fact like with a curt nod.



"Fish Louse?" I asked.



"Forget their scientific name," Burke continued. "But they're Isopods, they replace the fish's tongue and live inside their mouth, stealing their food. They're pretty common around the cove for some reason. When I first discovered them out here, I looked into it online, and it said they prefer warm coastal waters along California and Mexico and such, so I don't know why they're out here in the Arctic, or how the hell they're surviving, let alone thriving like they are. It's not really a big deal though, they're harmless to humans, so we just cut the heads off the infected fish and sell them at the market regardless." 



"So," Kajak, a middle-aged Inuit man with black hair pulled back into a bun and thin strands of greying facial hair lining his lips and jaw chimed in as he unhooked a Pike of his own. "The Landlubber finally catches a Tongue Stealer."



"I guess so," I said. "Fucking creepy."



Burke stomped over to a cutting board he already had prepared for the day, smacked the wriggling Pike down onto it, lifted up a big meat cleaver, and hacked down, severing its head in one blow. A stream of blood poured out from the Pike's open neck, soon to be washed back into the ocean from sea water that periodically splashed aboard.



A quiet yet echoing scream sounded off in the distance, over the foggy sea, and I turned my gaze out to find it.



"They always scream whenever he beheads one of their kin," Kajak said. "It's a bad omen."



I looked to him with concern, and then back to Burke as he tossed the head of the pike and the Isopod that lived within back into the sea before dropping the rest of the fish into a huge ice chest. "Will you quit scaring the boy with your superstitions?" Burke said. "Green Gill," he called me, a fun little nickname for the newest member of the crew. "Get back to work, you're burning daylight."



"Right," I moved back to the edge of the Helmsman, reset my rod and lure, and then cast back into the gently waving cool blue of the Arctic Sea just outside of Pike's Head Cove.



"Oh shit," Arturo called out from his fishing spot aboard the Helmsman, the last Green Gill before I came aboard. "I caught one too!"



I turned back as my line bobbed above the water, watching as Captain Burke made his way over and took the wriggling pike from the stocky Hispanic man. 



"Two in one day," Burke said as he stomped over to the still blood and sea water coated cutting board, smacking this fish down upon it just as he had the last. "That's rare." He hefted up the meat cleaver and whacked down, chopping off the Pike's head again in one mighty blow.



Another distant scream sounded out across the waves, and I looked to Kajak, meeting his gaze. "I told you," was he all he said, causing a chill to run down my spine.



It wasn't just 2 Louse infested fish we had caught that day before making our way back to land, but 7, a new record according to the rest of the crew. And every single time Burke beheaded one of them, a distant scream sounded out across the sea, and Kajak would meet my gaze with concern.



As I made my way down the dock to reenter the town proper, I pulled out my walkie talkie to call Rachel. Cell service was non existent in Pike's Head Cove, so walkie's were a necessity if you wanted to have communication across town on the go, and for the most part, people respected each other's private channels and knew better than to listen in or talk on a channel that was designated for someone else. Ours was channel 14.



"Landlubber to Sexy Barmaid," I said into my walkie as I pressed the talk button. "Come in, Sexy Barmaid, over."



I let go of the talk button, and seconds later, Rachel's chuckle sounded out from the walkie. "Will you stop it with the codenames already?"



"Negative, Sexy Barmaid," I responded. "Landlubber has made shore, what's your ETA?"



"Well, I just got off work, and I still have to swing by the market to grab some fish and a few other things to make dinner. So I'd say, about an hour from now?"



Her mention of fish forced the terrifying little face of the tongue stealing Louse back into my mind, and I felt my guts roil at the thought of eating anything that could have possibly been infested by one of those creatures. "On second thought," I said. "Skip the fish for tonight. Let's do something else for dinner."



"Everything but fish is too damn expensive right now, you know that," Rachel replied, and she was right. The market could sell fish for cheap, as it was caught and supplied daily by us fisherman, but practically everything else had to be delivered from out of town. That, combined with Alaska's already steep prices on groceries, because of how hard it was to farm or raise livestock here, made most things at the market far out of our price range. "Besides, I don't really trust the frozen beef they sell. I feel like Marta sells it long past its expiration date, but just doesn't care since it's frozen."



"Look," I said. "Just get anything you want, anything that looks good, and I'll pay you back when you get to my place, just remind me. But please, no fish for tonight, just trust me."



"Alright, if you're buying," Rachel said mischievously, as if she would go overboard shopping, even though I knew she wasn't the type of person to do such a thing. 



Arturo made his way down the dock then behind me, stopping momentarily to light up a cigarette.



Burke and Kajak closed in behind him, dragging carts behind them with ice chests filled with our daily catches resting atop them.



I realized then that I didn't actually have any cash on hand to pay her back with, and that the town bank would be closed for the night by now. "I gotta go, Sexy Barmaid," I said. "See you soon."



"Aye Aye, Landlubber!" She called back in a pirate accent before signing off.



I smiled at that, and then stuffed my walkie into one of the hand pockets of my big thermal coat. "Hey, Cap'n!" I called out as I jogged back over to my crewmates.



"Yes?" Burke said as he came to a halt.



"Anyway I can get paid in advance for today?" I asked. "It's date night, but I don't have any cash to pay for dinner."



Burke sighed, reaching around behind himself to retrieve his wallet from his back pocket. "Yeah, I suppose so." He reached into the thick stack of cash that rested within, pulling out 6 twenties and handing them over to me.



"Thanks, Cap'n," I said with a smile. "You're the best."



"Yeah, I know it," he said as Kajak came to a stop and held out his hand without saying a word. Burke sighed, and pulled out 8 twenties to give to him, and before the other man could even ask, pulled out another 7 to give to Arturo, nearly cleaning out his entire wallet, the other men of course getting paid more than myself as they had worked aboard the Helmsman for longer. "Everyone happy now?" Burke asked with exasperation before picking back up the handle to his fish hauling wagon.



Everyone nodded and smiled in agreement, like we were all children convincing our father to pay us allowance that would secretly be spent on bud and booze.



Kajak pulled out a wooden pipe then, its bowl already prefilled with a blend of tobacco and weed. He sparked a match and lit the whole bowl, taking several quick puffs from it to get the ember nice and ripe. "Arturo, my friend," he said between puffs and exhales. "You mind taking the haul to market with the Captain for me today? I also have a date night with the misses." 



Arturo shook his head between drags of his cigarette. "No, not at all," he said as he took up the handle of Kajak's fish cart for him and began following after the Captain.

  
Kajak caught him before he got too far away, offering him one of the twenties he had just received from Captain Burke, as bringing the fish to market with the Captain was part of Kajak's job and part of the reason why he got paid more that Arturo. So, it was only fair that Arturo received the extra pay for today, as Kajak was a man of principal.



"See you men bright and early on Monday!" Captain Burke called back as he made his way in the direction of the town market, Arturo following closely behind him now. We worked a 6 day work week, having Sundays off, and today happened to be Saturday.



"Enjoy your weekend, Cap'n!" I called back after him.



Kajak stayed standing on the dock, puffing from his pipe.



"Well, have a good weekend," I said, ready to head home to see Rowdy and wait for Rachel.



Kajak nodded, but didn't say anything as he continued sucking on his pipe.



I started away, when he spoke up from behind me. "Landlubber," he said, calling my attention back to him.



"Yeah," I responded. "What's up?"



"Be careful, and stay calm," he said. "I'm worried about you. I see omens and portents more often around you. Been seeing you in my dreams."



Coming from anyone else, this revelation may have creeped me out, but something about Kajak radiated a foreign wisdom from a culture I wasn't a part of, like he knew something that I couldn't possibly know, and that I should listen to his warnings and words of advice. "What sort of dreams?" Was all I could think to ask in the moment.



Kajak seemed to consider sharing his dreams with me, but then thought better of it, waving the prospect away with a shake of his head and swipe of his hand through the air. "Go about you way, Tyler," he called me by my name for perhaps the first time since I'd met him. "Just don't forget to listen when the world speaks to you. You're more perceptive to hearing her voice than most Landlubbers."



I nodded. "I won't forget," I said as I turned to leave, and I genuinely meant it. "Goodnight, Kajak."



"Goodnight, little brother," he said back as he also turned away, heading for his pickup truck, still puffing on his pipe as he went.



I hurried home then, greeting an excited Rowdy at the door and taking a quick shower before Rachel could get there.



When she arrived, I opened the front door to see her standing there, holding up a boxed frozen pizza in one hand with a wide grin. "Looks like $20 freezer burnt pizza for dinner," she said, just managing to contain her laughter. "Are you as excited as I am?" 



"Oh," I replied in exaggeration. "You have no idea." I grabbed her then, pulling her inside into my warm embrace and greeting her with a kiss. "I missed you," I said as I pulled back and looked into her piercing green eyes.



"I missed you, too," she replied, a bit of a blush taking over her cheeks before she leaned in for another kiss and then closed and locked the front door behind her.



We set the oven to preheat and opened up the pizza box, both laughing at the sight of the frozen wasteland that its surface had become during its months of travel and hand exchanges in order to even get here to grace the freezer aisle shelves of Marta's Market.



As the pizza cooked, I paid Rachel back her $20, we cracked open a few beers, lit up a joint, popped Shaun of the Dead in the Blu-Ray player as Rachel had claimed to never had seen the masterpiece of a film before, and we played a few quick rounds of catch with Rowdy in the backyard. 



Once the pizza was ready, we sat down on the living room couch as we ate our shares of the mostly edible pie and laughed at the movie, as well as each other's weed induced pieces of commentary, and it wasn't long before the film came to an end.



We sat their in silence for a few moments, both lost in our high thoughts it would seem, before I spoke up. "Want to watch Hot Fuzz next?" I asked.



I turned to face her, but she was staring off into the distance, still thinking about something deeply.



Then, with a quick snap of her head, she turned her piercing green-eyed gaze to me, the whites of her eyes now mildly bloodshot. "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?" She asked.



I laughed inappropriately, imagining that she just randomly decided to start roleplaying that we were in a job interview due to my inebriated state of mind. But as the laughter calmed, I apologized, explained, and then took her question seriously.



"Honestly? Right here," I said. "I want to be right here with you and Rowdy. Fishing for work. I don't know..." I trailed off then, unsure of what she wanted to hear.



"No, be serious," she urged.



"I am," I replied. "This life is peaceful. After Afghanistan, I didn't know if I'd ever get that again. A peaceful, simple life. It's what I needed. What I wanted."



Rachel held Rowdy's head in her lap as she listened, massaging her fingers through his short brindle colored fur.



"I guess I want to make more money, maybe work out of a boat of my own. But other than that, things are going pretty great."



"I don't think that boat of yours will be able to haul in enough Pike to make a living, if I'm being honest," she said with a devious smile, referring to the little rowboat I had purchased shortly after moving here and now left beached in a small, secluded part of the cove. I'd often take it out with Rowdy, or Rachel, or both to enjoy some calm and quiet out on the water, smoke a joint, drink a few beers, watch the sunrise or sunset, maybe do a little recreational fishing.



"No," I laughed. "But seriously. Maybe I could finance a boat of my own. There's plenty of Pike and mouths to feed to go around. I'm sure the Captain wouldn't mind. I could even sell out of town. It would be a hassle, but the better pay would account for that, I'm sure. Or maybe, I could buy the Helmsman off him if he ever decides to retire. Though I doubt he'd do so, unless it got to the point where he physically couldn't do the job anymore. I'm happy with this life, though. I want this life."



Rachel smiled at that, leaning her head into my chest and snuggling it into me.



"What about you?" I asked. "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"



She opened her eyes to look up to me, her gaze full of emotion. "Right here, with you," she said.



I smiled at that.



"Kiss me," She instructed, and I gladly obliged, leaning down and passionately interlocking our lips as I brought my hand up under her head, running my fingers through her hair and gently caressing the back of her scalp. That kiss turned into a full on make out session, which led us into the shower, which led us into bed, which then led into me waking up the following morning, our naked bodies interlocked, and I looked down with a smile at the peaceful and resting features of the woman I loved.



I hadn't realized it was what had awoken me at first, as all my attention from the moment my eyes opened had been on Rachel, but I could now hear someone banging on my front door, not furiously, but hard and consistent enough to imply some urgency.



I noticed then that Rowdy wasn't in his dog bed on the floor of my room, but was now out in the living room, barking at the front door.



Rachel stirred and groaned, clearly still too tired to start her day, and I disconnected our bodies before maneuvering myself off the bed and making my way to my closet.



I quickly pulled on a pair of boxers, a pair of jeans, and then slipped a camo Realtree long sleeve on over my head before stepping out of my room, closing the door behind me as Rachel was laying naked within. "Quiet," I instructed Rowdy, and he immediately went silent, demonstrating the well-trained dog that he was. I then gave him some quick pets to assure him that he was right to alert me that someone was here, even though I wanted him to stop alerting now. I led him back into my room then, shutting him in with Rachel before proceeding to answer the door.



Whoever it was, mildly banged on the front door again.



"I'm coming!" I called out. "Jesus Christ, who bangs on someone's door at the 6:30 in the morning," I commented as I caught sight of the time on my microwave oven as I passed by the kitchen. "This better be a fucking emergency."



Looking through the peephole, I immediately realized that my house caller was Captain Burke. The burly man stood with his back to the door, wearing a red and brown checkered flannel, but I could make him out by his build, grey buzzcut, and the bushy grey beard that grew out around his face, too big to be obscured even by his large dome of a head. 



It was strange that he would be showing up here on our day off, but it wasn't unheard of, as there had been a few times where he'd had to come get me to help with some repair on the Helmsman or some such in order to make sure it was sea-ready by Monday morning. Or times when the Market was too stocked with fish to purchase more, and he needed someone to make a run with him out of town to sell the fish to markets of neighboring towns hours away while they were still fresh.



I sighed, unlocking the door and beginning to pull it open, realizing that the day I had planned of lying in bed with Rachel, having sex, watching comedy movies, drinking beers, smoking joints, and playing fetch with Rowdy, was now to be replaced with yet another day of work. 



"Mornin' Cap'n," I said as I finished pulling open the door. 



"Green Gill," Captain Burke replied, his back still turned to me. "I need your help wish shomething, it shouldn't take long." He was slurring his words a bit, as if he had been up all night drinking.



*I knew it.* "Alright," I sighed. "Just let me grab my coat and some gloves, say goodbye to Rachel." At least if he was right about whatever it was not taking long, I could maybe make it back in time to still spend the day with her.



I turned to step away then, when some sort of primitive survival instinct compelled me not to turn my back to the Captain. "Just don't forget to listen when the world speaks to you," Kajak's words echoed through my mind, and I knew my instincts were right in that moment. Something was off. Something was wrong with Captain Burke.



I turned back, keeping my eyes trained on him. Every other time he had shown up on my day off asking something of me, he showed up with coffee, doughnuts, and an apology, promising double pay for the day. Then there was his speech, Captain Burke enjoyed his drink just like any man, but he wasn't one to stay up until sunrise drinking like some college kid, especially if he knew there was work to be done the following day. Also, there was the fact that I'd never seen Captain Burke refuse to look another man in the eye as he spoke to him, that was just not something his character would allow for. And lastly, as I cautiously watched him now, I could see that his body was sporadically twitching, though he seemed to be fighting against the urge, and I could even hear low guttural noises coming from his mouth, sounds and movements that I had never seen or heard him make before.



I took a step back toward the door, readying to slam it shut if the need arose. "Captain Burke, why won't you look me in the eye?" I asked.



A muffled chuckle escaped the Captain then. "Quit meshing around, Green Gill," He slurred back. "We have work to do, you're burning daylight."



I hoped I was wrong, that I was just being paranoid because of Kajak's words yesterday and perhaps some lingering effects from the plethora of weed I had smoked the night before, but I needed to know before I took one step out this door with Burke. "Captain, look at me," I urged.



"Who do you think you're giving ordersh to, boy?" Captain Burke snapped back angrily.



"Burke, turn around."



"Are you out of your-"



"Turn around."



"You're about to be-"



"Look at me!"



An inhuman screech shrieked through the air then, as Burke turned, thrusting a white blur in the direction of my face.



I reflexively pulled my head out of the way and caught Burkes burly arm in such a way that I had control of his wrist and elbow, to apply pressure, or even break the limb if need be.



As our movement slowed, I saw just what it was Burke had thrust at my face, as one of the tongue-stealing Isopods wriggled about in his grip, staring back at me with beady, soulless, black eyes, its legs reaching out for me, its mouth opening to let out a little scream of its own.



"What the fuck!?" I turned back to face Burke then, seeing what had become of my noble Captain. An even larger Isopod resided in his mouth, in place of where his tongue should be. It held his jaws pried open with its limbs, allowing a steady flow of bloody drool to trail down out of the corners of Burke's mouth and into his beard, crusting the grey hairs red. The Captain's eyes now dangled out of his face, hanging past his cheeks by bloody cords, their sockets crying tears of blood, and in their place, eye stalks like that of a slug or snail rose up out from them, their alien movements putting on a terrifying display.



I screamed in horror, immediately bending the Captain's arm in a painful manner, gaining myself a dominant position, and then I threw him out of my front doorway with all my strength, watching as he flipped over himself, and painfully tumbled down the set of stairs leading up to my little front porch.



I could see more people approaching the house now, the nearest being Arturo, only, I didn't know if they were really people anymore. As where Arturo's eyes should be placed within their sockets, they instead dangled out in front of his face, and two eye stalks stretched up out of them in their place.



I slammed my front door and locked it, hearing Rowdy beginning to stir now, letting out little yipping barks as his claws scraped across the hardwood flooring of my room.



I reached my bedroom door and opened it just as Rachel had reached it from the other side, having seemed to have awoken and already put on some clothing while I was dealing with Burke.



"What's going on?" She asked.



I pushed her back into the room, forcing my way inside as well, and then I closed and locked my bedroom door behind us.



I immediately moved to my closet then, grabbing my Army green Kevlar vest from where it hung and throwing it on over my torso, plates already aligned within, and my KA-BAR already sheathed to its chest. 



"Tyler? What the hell is happening right now?" Rachel asked again.



I strapped my sidearm holster to my right leg, and then opened my nightstand, pulling out my handgun lockbox and placing it onto the bed.



Rachel grew frustrated at my lack of reply, moving for the bedroom door.



"No!" I stopped her, grabbing her wrist.



"Tyler! What the hell is going on!? Are you having some sort of psychotic break right now or something!? You're putting on your gear like you're back in Afghanistan! You're scaring me! Say something!" 



I nodded, taking a deep breath. "I'm not going crazy, even though what I'm about to tell you is going to sound crazy. But you need to trust me and listen to me, because we are in danger right now and we need to move, okay?"



She nodded, her eyes filling with involuntary tears.



Banging started sounding out from the front door once again, though this time, it was much more forceful, as if Burke was now attempting to break it down.



Rachel jumped, turning her gaze toward the bedroom door briefly and then back to me to hear my explanation.



I moved back to my handgun case as I spoke, unlocking it. "There was something infesting the fish yesterday, an Isopod, the Captain called it. That's why I didn't want you to buy fish for dinner, remember? I don't know how, or why, but it is infesting people now, taking them over."



"What?" Rachel forced out a fake laugh in disbelief. 



I retrieved my black Springfield XD Tactical .45 from the case, slapped one of the magazines home, chambered a round, then holstered my sidearm before also slotting the two spare magazines in the case into the holster as well. "I don't know how to explain what's happening, or how to make sense of it, but it is happening. Whatever that creature is, it was in Burke's mouth, controlling him. It pushed his eyes out of his fucking head for Christ's sake, and it was using his speech to try and trick me. It forced him to attack me. The worst part, is that he was trying to force one of those things into my mouth as well, to make me like him, to turn me into one of them." I rambled all of this off as quickly as I could, knowing that there was little to no time to catch her up, and to get her to trust me.



Rachel backed away from me now, keeping her eyes cautiously trained on my holstered sidearm. "Tyler... I want to leave," she said.



"No," I begged. "Please, you have to believe me. I know this sounds crazy, but it's the truth. Just trust me for the next minute, and if you don't see what I see, then walk away and call Sheriff Dunn on me, okay?"



Rachel nodded, forcing down a lump in her throat. She was clearly terrified that I was losing my mind, and having some sort of PTSD mental breakdown, but she trusted me enough to give me a chance to prove that wasn't the case.



Glass shattered then, from somewhere within the house, causing Rachel and I to both jump.



I listened closely for a moment then, hearing footfalls as someone entered the house from whatever window they had just broken.



I looked to Rachel with terror and concern. "They're inside," was all I said. I grabbed my walkie talkie from my nightstand, using the clip on the back to strap it to the front of my vest, realizing as I did so, that she had left hers out in the living room inside of her purse, and that it was out of our reach now. I then took her by the hand and pulled her toward my bedroom window.



I let go of her, unlocked the window, and pulled it up and open. I then stuck my head outside, looking back and forth and all around, seeing that my backyard and the visible areas around it were clear, for now at least. "It's clear, go," I instructed, gently pushing Rachel toward the window.



"You want me to crawl out your window?" She asked, still not fully grasping our situation in her confused and freshly awoken state.



"Rachel," I said sternly. "This is life or death. Move."



She met my gaze, seeing how serious I was, and nodded, turning to crawl her way out through the window.



As she got her footing outside, I turned to Rowdy, pointed to him, and then pointed out the window. "Through!" I commanded, and he didn't hesitate to gracefully leap through the window, landing gently in my backyard. I then clicked my tongue and snapped my fingers to draw his attention back to me. I then pointed to him, and then to Rachel. "Guard!" I instructed, and he immediately got to work, stalking around Rachel and eyeing his surroundings, emanating a low warning growl to any that would dare attack her.



I moved back to my closet now, knowing there was one more thing I would need if we were to stand a fighting chance. I owned several guns, and had plenty of spare ammunition, but there wasn't enough time to grab it all. I knew that I needed to not get greedy, and that expedient movement would be the main key to my survival here. But I feared my sidearm wouldn't be enough alone to protect us from whatever was going on.



I grabbed the tan case that housed my AR-15 from the closet and hefted it up onto my bed, getting to work on putting in the combination to unlock it just as someone or something slammed into my bedroom door from the other side and began furiously banging against it. I unlocked the case, pulled the rifle up out of it, and then slammed a magazine home in the well, chambering a round just before the wood of my bedroom door shattered inward, and the door itself was wrenched off its hinges.



A shrieking cry sounded out as Arturo flung himself through my bedroom doorway and in my direction.



I pulled up my rifle at the last second, wedging it between us, and squeezed the trigger twice, punching two rounds into the dead center of his chest and propelling him back. 



We both froze for a moment, and then the Louse in his mouth let out another shriek, and he launched himself forward again, as if the fatal wounds didn't even phase him.



I pulled the barrel of the rifle up then and popped off a round just before he reached me, bursting apart the Louse within his mouth and painting the bedroom wall and doorframe with Arturo's blood and brain matter.



His form flung back from the force of the gunshot and then crumpled to the floor like a sack of bricks, but Burke replaced him in an instant, grabbing ahold of the barrel of my rifle before I could get a shot off on him, and shoving it to the side, causing me to fire a round needlessly into the wall.



He used his superior strength then from a lifetime of hard manual labor to wrench the rifle from my hands before thrusting the butt of it back into my Kevlar vest and forcing me back onto my bed. 



I thought, for less than a second, about drawing my sidearm and fighting for the rifle, but the other infested townsfolk that had made their way into my house and were now nearing the doorframe of my bedroom caused me to think better of it.



It was time to retreat.



I rolled back over my bed, falling to my hands and knees on the hardwood floor, and then launched myself through the open window, landing with my weight into my shoulder on the cold hardened ground of my backyard and using my momentum to roll with the impact, managing to quickly get to my feet.



"Tyler!" Rachel screamed in terror, clearly having seen some of what had just went down through the window.



"Go! Go! Move!" I urged, pushing her forward, covering her with my vest protected torso as Rowdy followed along behind us.



Gunshots cracked off behind me now, whizzing past us, and I continued using my body to cover Rachel's as we made our way to the side gate of my backyard.



A burning sting traced along the inside of my left arm, causing me to wince. Then a round full on impacted with the left side of my lower back, hitting home with my Kevlar vest, the impact nearly toppling me forward as the air was punched out of my lungs, and I gasped.



"Tyler!?" Rachel cried out.



"Go!" I managed to gasp out, wincing and wheezing in pain as we moved, hoping against all hope that the bullet hadn't managed to get through my vest.



We reached the gate, and I allowed myself to fall into it for a moment to catch my breath as Rachel unlatched it and pushed it open.



"Come on," she said, taking me by the arm and pulling me through as I groaned in pain, leading me out onto a street filled with infested townsfolk that I once called neighbors. But I knew their minds were gone, replaced by the will of the Isopods that had stolen their tongues, now overcome with the urge to hunt down and assimilate everyone they once knew.
