First there was nothing.

Then God created a Woman.

She was thankful.


God decided to thank her.

God created a man.

Man was not thankful.


Woman was no longer thankful.

The two of them fought.

God put a baby in between them.


It did not help.

They got even more upset.

God made a world for them full of people.


They finally calmed down.

The Woman looked into the eyes of her baby.

Everyone was happy. 


But overtime their baby grew smaller.

The baby could barely open its eyes. 

The Woman consumed it.


God was angry at the Woman.

God made the man punish the Woman.

He stole something from her.


The man grew distant.

The Woman became sad.

The man left the Woman all alone.


God felt bad for punishing the Woman.

God made another woman come into her life.

They both started to get happier.


The Woman began to shrink.

The woman began to grow.

God was scared.


The Woman shrank to the point where she could barely open her eyes.

The woman made herself look like the Woman.

The woman tries to consume the Woman.


God wants to save her. 

God tries to stop the woman from eating her.

But God gets tangled up, and before god knows what is happening they are in complete nothingness.


But God feels different.

God feels warm.

God feels safe.



They see a light.

Their body begins to feel pressure.

They are thrust into a cold world and cry.


They see a man they created.

He had helped feed the Woman to the woman.

What was he doing here?


God looks down to see the woman.

God is brought to her.

God cries in fear of being eaten. 


But God was met with warmth.

They felt safe.

And in that single moment of relief, God forgot everything She knew.


She lived with the woman for a long time.

The woman introduced her to the world.

The woman introduced her to the people.


They were all so big.

But eventually they started to shrink.

As did the world.


One day she could see eye to eye with the people.

People seemed to no longer like who she was.

She left them. 


One day she saw the man.

She was scared and intrigued by the man.

She decided to talk to him.


The man understood her.

The man spoke back.

This scared and intrigued her even more.


They began to speak all the time.

They started to touch each other.

They found love together.


She got pregnant.

They had a baby.

She was truly happy.


But one day while she was looking into the eyes of her child, she started to remember.

This was the baby that she had created.

This was the world she had created.


God looked up to see the man.

God grabbed the man.

Then the world vanished.


God held onto the man and her baby.

But then her baby vanished.

God gave up.


The man tried to comprehend what was happening before vanishing himself. 

God cried.

God yelled.


But God could not hear themself.

God could not feel themself. 

God’s world was again nothing. 


Then God starts to laugh.

A full laugh that shakes the universe to its very core. 

And now God is clear.



God creates a Universe.

One that is beautiful and full of life.

One that is in a state of complete peace.



and then god lets chaos begin.





Moral of the story:

Pineapples don’t have sleeves.
