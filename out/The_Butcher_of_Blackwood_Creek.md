I’ve always hated the way the fog rolls into the outskirts of Blackwood Creek. It’s not a soft, romantic haze; it’s a hungry, predatory thing that eats the streetlights and swallows sound. But now, I see it not as an enemy, but as a silent accomplice. The town’s old-timers still have their names for it—the Widow's Veil, the Butcher's Breath—but to me, it's simply the veil that hid me from the monster and the breath that gave me the strength to survive.

Six months have passed since that night. The town has been in a state of quiet hysteria. Three missing teenagers and the discovery of Adam’s body—or what was left of it—fueled a furious, but ultimately fruitless, investigation. The police found the murder weapon, a rusty rebar with a dark, metallic fluid on it, but the Mutilator's body was nowhere to be found. The ground was just too churned up, the police said. He had been so sure I couldn't escape, so convinced of his victory, that he never even considered that I would fight back. The townspeople whisper about a vigilante, a silent hero who ended the town's oldest evil. But no one knows who the hero is, and I'm not about to tell them.

I have my own truth to live with. I buried him. I stood over his still form, the cleaver in my hand, and watched as the fog began to thin. The rising sun revealed a truth that the night had hidden: his skin wasn't just pale, it was a translucent, almost waxy white. He didn't have a pulse. He didn't even seem to be breathing. He was a creature of myth, not a man of flesh and blood. I used the same shovel from my grandfather's shed to dig a shallow grave in the oldest part of the local cemetery, a forgotten corner where the headstones were just moss-covered rocks. The cleaver, still a testament to the night’s work, I’d buried in his chest—a final, macabre act of defiance.

I thought I would feel relief. Instead, a new kind of sickness has taken root in me—a strange compulsion to visit the grave. At first, it was once a week. Then, every few days. The grave has become a pilgrimage, a place where I can face my own darkness. I stand there, watching the fog swirl over the ground, a silent question on my lips. Have I done the right thing? Am I a hero, or just another monster born from the darkness of Blackwood Creek?

The cemetery is a desolate place, a silent city of the dead that feels more alive than the decaying town. The trees are ancient, their gnarled branches reaching for the sky like skeletal fingers. The wind, when it blows, whispers through the gravestones, a haunting symphony of forgotten names and broken promises. On this particular afternoon, the air is still, heavy with the scent of rain-soaked earth. The sky is the color of a bruise, and a faint, thin mist is already beginning to creep in from the west.

I find his grave, a small, unremarkable mound of earth hidden behind a massive oak tree. It’s exactly as I left it. The soil is firm, and the weeds have started to grow over the surface. The sight of it brings a cold comfort to my heart. He's here, beneath my feet, a silent prisoner in the earth. The Mutilator, the creature of legend, is nothing more than a ghost story now. I won.

A flicker of light catches my eye. It’s a single, black feather, fluttering on the edge of the grave. I reach down to pick it up, my fingers brushing against the cold, damp earth. My breath catches in my throat. The feather isn't just on the edge of the grave. It’s on the edge of a hole. A small, black, perfectly round hole, no bigger than a mouse’s, but perfectly defined in the soft, dark soil. I kneel down, my heart starting to pound. The air grows colder, and a sharp, metallic tang, like the smell of fresh ozone and rust, fills the air. I haven’t felt that smell since that night.

With trembling fingers, I brush away more of the soil. The hole grows larger, then larger still, as if it were a wound in the earth itself. It isn't a hole, I realize, my mind screaming in terror. It’s a tunnel. A tunnel that has been dug from the inside out. A tunnel that has been made with a single, brutal force, not a shovel or a pickaxe, but something else. Something inhuman.

I stare into the dark opening, a black void in the heart of the earth. The cleaver is gone. A low, wet rasp, like a saw grinding through wood, echoes from deep within the ground. It’s not a sound of struggle. It’s a sound of triumphant release. I look at my hands, the hands that buried him, and feel the hot, stinging tears of terror on my cheeks. I hadn’t buried him. I had simply delayed him.

The Mutilator is gone from his grave. The town of Blackwood Creek, shrouded in its familiar fog, is about to learn a new kind of horror. He's no longer just a monster who hunted. He's a monster who remembers.

I look up, my eyes, now pale with a newfound dread, locked onto the distant lights of the town. The fog is a solid wall, a silent, grey lie that hides everything beyond twenty feet. I'm alone and fear grabs me now in a visceral grip. The Mutilator is waiting, watching. He will exact his revenge.
