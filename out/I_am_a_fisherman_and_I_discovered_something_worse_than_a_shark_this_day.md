It was a very windy day today in the middle of the ocean in my small little boat. This wind caused the boat to occasionally rock back and forth. Crashing into the waves caused the freezing water of the Pacific Ocean to splash all on me. Soaking me wet.

“Ugh, isn’t Mother Nature sometimes a bitch.” I exclaimed in annoyance out loud to myself. 

A bit of background information to help things be more understandable. I have been fishing for over 10 years now and only do it as a hobby to make some money on the side. 

It’s not a full time job that I do as I work for a business and create my own art work to sell as the main career, but as a little side gig, make a little bit of money; and hey, fishing in the middle of absolutely fucking nowhere surrounded by visibly limitless ocean, is a way to face a fear of deep bodies of water that I have, also known as Thalassophobia.

I only do the fishing about twice a week, normally on the weekends because for some reason it is a relaxing experience to be by myself in solitude with nature itself for a couple hours. Only being out about 10-20 miles from shore, I make sure to stay about 3-4 hours out and make sure to come back before sunset. Living close as well to the beach is what inspired me to begin having this hobby of fishing. 

A couple times I have hallucinated some things after being in the intense heat one summer day. The waves started turning into beautiful hilly green meadows, and I tried to get off my boat to walk on them, but then I stopped myself after noticing that they were hallucinations.

But that wasn’t the scariest middle of the ocean story that I have. Yeah, hallucinating about a beautiful, calming, and serene meadow trying to cause you to drown is not the scariest thing I have experienced. The scariest thing…. is what happened yesterday.

It was the typical fishing day. Waiting around in boredom waiting for the fishing line to start and move and pull you downward by getting heavier. Until, I noticed something in the distance. It was a little green thing. Sailing closer to it, I get close enough to point out what it is. It was a bottle. 

“The classic message in a bottle.” I said to myself chuckling. “Must be something cool.” 

Reaching out from my boat, I grab it and pull it back into my boat. Opening it… pop goes the cork.

But I noticed something after doing do. 

There was no message in it. Instead there was only a liquid. A red liquid. 

“Probably a drunk that forgot to tie up there wine.” I said to myself rolling my eyes. 

But it wasn’t wine. 

IT WAS BLOOD. 

I knew this because of the smell of it that I did to see if it was genuinely wine or not. And it wasn’t, it was blood. 

“That’s odd.” “Again though I am in the middle of the ocean, and it is pretty odd out here in general… so, I shouldn’t get too worked up about this. I should just get one more big catch and call it a day and sail back to the coast to go home.”

I knew my wife missed me. My sweet, beautiful, wife. The girl of my dreams. I love her so much and I sometimes feel bad when I leave her at home to go on these fishing trips. She always is worried when I go because of the risk and danger of the ocean taking my under and drowning me. 

Grabbing my net to get one more catch, I throw it in the cold, deep, blue water, and begin to wait for fish to get in. 

*Shake, shake. Shake shake* the net went and it was at this moment that I knew it was time for a big catch. 

Reeling the net up I see lots and lots of fishies.

“JACKPOT!” I yell out in excitement. 

But than…

*Crash* 

Waves crashing hard into my boat. Causing me to rock like crazy. 

“Let’s get out of here!” I say in fear but also pride after what I had just caught. “This will probably hands down be my biggest catch I have ever gotten!”

*but this isn’t the scariest part that happened.*

No not the blood in the bottle and not the waves trying to feed me to the wrath of Mother Nature. 

It was when I noticed another boat in the distance. A tiny boat, about the same size as mine. 

“That’s odd, usually when I am out here I am the only one. Must be another fisher. I could say hi to them maybe. But I really should get back before this wind and massive waves take me out any more. But it wouldn’t hurt to just say hello and leave. Ok, fine! I will go over there.” I said in my head after have a little battle of thoughts conflicting each other. 

The waves were pushing me over to the other boat anyways and it wasn’t like I was going against such an obstacle, so why not just meet this fellow sailor. It wouldn’t hurt to do, I mean I have already been out here by myself for hours anyways. 

Sailing over to the boat close enough to reach and get off onto it, I throw my sea anchor out and come to a complete stop with the only movement being the rocking from the waves. 

I get off my ship onto the other one like a pirate and calmly knock on the cabin door in a friendly and quiet manner, making sure to be polite and not startle the person who’s inside. 

*knock, knock, knock*

no answer 

Again…

*knock, knock, knock*

No Answer 

“Hello, I don’t mean to interrupt you, just wanted to say hi and wanted to know if you were another fisherman or not or maybe you could be lost, well if you are, than I will help you and am here to help you.”

Then the door opened after the next knock I did on it. 

Creaking slowly and creepily like something out of a horror movie. I take a peak inside and see it is absolutely empty. Nobody, no noise, the only thing being a bed, a kitchen, stove, bathroom, etc. 

But I did notice one thing… a terrible stench. It smelled awful. I couldn’t pin point what it was or where it was coming from. But it was terrible. 

“Where is this person? Is this another hallucination I am having?” I said out loud, this time in genuine fear.

That’s when I heard…

*buzz, buzz, buzz*

Around my ears , going around them. 

They were….

Flies????

I watched one in the air to see where it will land at and it went over to the bed. Walking over to the bed, I noticed a swarm of flies above it. Intrigued I pulled the mattress off the bed and found something awful. 

A dead corpse lying on the floor. A hole of blood coming out of a man’s head, looking only in his 30s. A pistol lying right by his hand. 

But next to him…. 

Oh next to him……

Was pure nightmare fuel.

MY OWN WIFES HEAD SEVERED AND LYING ON A PLATE WITH A KNIFE STABBED IN HER Right eye! BLOOD DRIPPING across her cheek.
