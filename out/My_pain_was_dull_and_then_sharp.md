"Can you describe the pain?"

My wife and I were sat opposite the doctor. For a second, I sat in a trance, staring at a spot on the floor. "It's... a sharp pain in my arm and like, a dull, achy feeling that goes over my shoulder." I wasn't good at describing pain.

"And have you noticed any other symptoms that come with this pain?"

"Well, I..." I told him the nail analogy, and we spoke a bit about that.

"... Given your age, I'd like to do some tests to have a look at what's going on... The sooner the better, I think... Are you free tomorrow?" We agreed on a time.

"Any idea what it could be?" I asked him, stone-faced.

"These tests are going to help us find out."

A week later, I received my diagnosis of stage four cancer. I didn't have long left.

At first, I reacted in the way you'd expect, by becoming very depressed, very quickly. I lay in bed for almost a week; staring at the ceiling; staring out the glass in our bedroom - the one that bore an uninspiring view of a row of houses. I barely spoke to my wife, except when I asked her to do things for me. "Get me some water." Was the main one.

A part of me appreciated her being there for me, but I was battling more than just the cancer. It felt like I was seeing myself for the first time - who I really was - and it hurt.

"Can you describe the pain?"

Yes, doctor. I worked as a mason since I was fifteen - a brick-layer for that long. I spent the good part of thirty years building homes that are now lived in by thousands of people, and what did I get in terms of appreciation? Barely enough money to make ends meet, or come close to paying off the mortgage on my shitty house. Meanwhile, I heard stories of teenage YouTubers buying mansions. What did they ever do for society?

It cost me my dignity. The other guys always took the piss, said I was born old, stuck in my ways from the start. They laughed at my posture. Said I was round enough to knock down pins. I couldn't help that I was short and stocky, could I?

I pretended to laugh and go along with it. Told myself it was all good fun, that they were my friends. But, deep down, I think I hated every one of them. I hated playing into who they told me I was.

"Can you describe the pain?"

Yes, doctor. My wife. I'm grateful for her company but I don't think I've ever loved her.

Like most people, I made do. As she aged, I didn't like her wrinkles, her saggy tits. She was bony and almost anorexic, and I said as much in moments.

Our happiest memories amount to us sitting on the couch and watching TV. My stubby fingers, clenching a bottle of lager on a table. Both our faces, hanging low and gormless, absorbing the pale light from the screens we clung to. That was our marriage in a nutshell.

We didn't know each other, not really; we only said what our parents told us to say - only heard what the world pressured us to hear. And it's only now I realise how much I hated every second of it.

"Can you describe the pain?"

Oh, yes. It's very dull for the most part. It hurts immensely, but I try to ignore it. My body aches, my head aches; it's a dull, banging, ringing noise. I feel a lump, slap-bang in the middle of my chest.

Maybe you can help me?

"I'd like to do a few tests to see what's going on."

"Yes, yes please."

"What other symptoms are you experiencing?"

"I'm boring, moronic, irritable. I can't love."

"I see, we'll check that too..."

Days passed. They called me into the hospital. Put me in a thin gown, in a ward full of other sick people.

"Richard, your wife wants to see you."

"Tell her I'm sleeping." I didn't want to see her, or anyone.

One day, I was shown myself in the mirror. My face had inflated to twice the size. The ceiling lights burned my eyes.

Days passed.

"Richard, are you alive?" Came the voice of a nurse.

"I don't think so." I replied in a weak breath. "But maybe."

Days passed.

Morphine. More morphine.

Beside my bed stood a tower of cardboard bowls; I kept forgetting how sick the painkillers made me.

Days passed.

I looked down at my arm - its natural colour slowly boiling away. Cold, sharp pain like nails pierced my muscles and bones.

Days passed.

"I'm afraid your situation is quite dire: you seem to have wasted your potential on this earth." Said a man in a white coat.

A chuckle escaped my numb lips. "Oh, yeah, cock-sucker?"

It was a dream.

Days passed.

"I'm so sorry, for everythi-" I fell to sleep. I slept for longer and longer, my time awake growing shorter and shorter.

Days passed.

A robin perched on the windowsill at the end of the ward. I watched it curiously for a minute, before it darted away. Then I fell back to sleep.

"When?"

"Soon."

"When?"

"Soon."

I didn't have the energy to move my lips anymore.

Eventually, it came - the oblivion I'd been waiting for.

For forty-four years, my pain was dull. And then it was sharp. And then it was over.
