I’m standing out in my garden at home. It’s sunny, but the clouds start to roll in and quickly the weather becomes overcast. Something’s wrong. Long strands start falling from the sky above, reaching down towards me. I try to move, try to run, try to do anything at all, but I can’t move.

They grab me, and hoist me up. I am pulled upwards, further and further, into the newly born blanket of gloomy clouds. Above me, the upside-down surface of a lake approaches at a great speed, before I am plunged into it and pulled through.

I hang in a grey abyss, held still by unseen forces. It’s so cold. Things move around me in the murk, but I can’t make out their shapes. They approach, curiously, and grow bolder. They reach out, nipping my body. More and more start to attack, each time stealing away a tiny part of my body.

The assaults increase. Larger and larger parts of me are torn away and lost to the haze around me. Yet even after the last fragment of my body is taken away, I remain. I see and hear everything as a being of perception alone. But I cannot look around, nonexistent limbs refuse to cooperate. No matter my yearning to scream, no sound is produced from a mouth that is no longer there.

It is torment, and infinity.

Sorry, I had to write all that down first thing, wouldn’t want to forget such an astounding dream. Well, nightmare moreover.

As for the rest of this, I had a very hard time putting any of it to paper. I seem to have recovered now, but forgive me if there are things I’ve missed out.

.

Following that terrible dream, I woke up in a frenzied confusion. I felt terrible, foggy. Where was I? What was the time, and date?

Who was I?

Rubbing my head, legs hanging off the edge of the mattress, I looked around to see one other, empty bed. Was I here by myself, or… was there someone else here?

Someone else… Arthur, no, Angela… Angie? Annie… ANNIE? Where was Annie?

Through the haze I somehow willed my brain into recalling who I’d come to this forsaken place with. I tried to stand up from the bed, but my legs buckled and I toppled onto hands and knees. The cool stone floor definitely gave me strength, dispelling some of the abhorrent mist that clouded in my head.

Pushing myself back up with an effort that felt like the last rep of a push-up set, I found myself on my feet once more, albeit with wobbling knees. I reached a hand out to the wall to steady myself, and after gaining some composure I was able to start walking.

The door to this room hung wide open, but there was no one outside.

*God, Annie, where have they taken you? What are they doing to you?*

I stumbled and tripped down a seemingly endless hallway, and like smoke, or vapour, a man suddenly appeared in front of me. I bumped into him, but he caught me in his arms and hoisted me back up, both hands on my shoulders.

“My friend, are you okay? What are you doing?” he said, with a concerned tone.

Who the hell was this guy? He had the weirdest haircut, like ripples on the surface of a pond, and wore the most dazzling robes. Any shadow that fell upon them was washed away in place of their vibrant colours.

I tried to speak, but my native language had not yet come back in its entirety,

“I, eh, wh- where am, is, Ann… ie?”

The man shot me a quizzical look, then took my hand, turning around and leading me somewhere.

“I think it’s time you leave, for your own wellbeing. You will recover soon. I will prepare a brew that should nurse you back into being.”

I don’t remember the journey, but I found myself sitting on a bench with a steaming cup in my hand. It was hot, really hot, and I dropped it reflexively. The man was still with me, and without a word he filled another cup and placed it down next to me, clearing up the one that had just shattered on the ground.

This time, I waited to let the drink cool, and then drank half in one gulp. The warm sensation travelling into my stomach was pleasant, and the effects of its contents were made apparent as clarity found me again, and memories came flooding back.

I groaned, took a few deep inhales, then got up and asked,

“Can I- we, please leave now, Dominika… sorry, Domimokah?”

“Absolutely. I should have sent you on your way yesterday, regrettably. But alas, here we are. Though, before that, would you like to say your farewells?”

“My farewells… yeah, yeah of course, thanks for the hospitality, I-“

“Oh, no, no,” he interjected, “I meant, to your friend.”

A pang of adrenaline cut through me as I heard that. Why would I be saying farewell to Annie? Unless…

“Wh- no, what have you done? Where is Annie? I want to get her and leave, where is she?!”

Wordlessly, Domimokah beckoned me to follow. With no other choice, I complied, and after a short walk we arrived back in the skull room, complete with its burning incense, polished floor, monks, Annie…

*Annie? No, god, please.*

I… I was too late. I didn’t recognise her at first, but I’d recognise that shade of brunette anywhere, tufts peeking out from underneath a funnel-shaped hat.

“N-no… fuuuck, no, ANNIE! HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?” I screamed, thrashing out of Domimokah’s grip.

“Please, stop this. I implore you. It was of her own choice to join us. Nothing was forced upon her.”

“I- I don’t believe you! How, how the FUCK could you possibly have done this?!?”

My weakened legs carried me towards her, but again, that whistle sounded, and I was quickly restrained by a pair of brainless monks. I pulled, shouted, fought to escape, but it was no use.

“I think that is more than enough. The Well speaks, the presence of this man is welcome no more. Yerhemmi, please escort him out with haste.”

The other man, Yerhemmi, appeared from nowhere, from somewhere behind me, and took my arm in a grip of steel. It was an unnatural strength, from something else within him. Something that shouldn’t be there.

“No, no! Stop! Let me take her, PLEASE!”

The whole time my head was turned backward, screaming out for Annie, even though I knew there was no possible scenario she could return with me.

My throat was shredded by the time we arrived back at the entrance. There, Yerhemmi halted his march, and turned to me with a grim expression.

“You must leave this place, quickly. The great Well covets you, now. It has allowed you to peer inside it, but I can sense its revulsion to your gaze. Please, run, do not linger here one minute longer.”

In those final moments, I finally saw the pink scar tissue encircling his head. Before I had the time to properly understand this, he pushed me forward, jumpstarting my muscles into action.

I tumbled down the slope in dust and brittle leaves. From above sounded a soul-twisting vibration, and I dared not look. My descent was broken and I rolled across the ledge, the path I had taken with Annie to reach this terrible place.

All my limbs were scratched and scraped, but through a divine miracle nothing was broken or sprained. My shoes scraped across the ground, gaining traction, and I ran with all the energy I had left.

As I fled, the sun’s light began to dim, and a dark front slid over the ground, stretching far away from me. Nothing could distract me now, booking it at full speed down the time-worn trail. Sounds like thunder erupted from far above, an awful crackling resonance that penetrated flesh and bone.

Lungs screamed, muscles burned. None of that mattered. Even if I never walked again, I would absolutely choose that over being taken by the incomprehensible madness, the same one whose eyes were on me.

Without warning, my foot caught on something and I rolled head over heels, gashing my cheek on a sharp stone in the process. I forced through the dizziness, and turned to sit upright.

A mistake. Oh, what a mistake. In doing so, I’d unwillingly turned around to face back from where I came. I’d tripped over some strange, black object… it hit me then, what had hindered my escape, it was the same blackened, seared corpse of the mountain lion from days before. No more white flames this time, but… I don’t know why, but I looked up.

Immediately I regretted this decision, as I saw those dark grey coils tighten around each other, in a way that made my head ache. They condensed, twisted, and grew impossibly, until a colossal blanket smothered the midday sky. It dwarfed the formation we’d seen before, tenfold larger in size and span. I didn't want to acknowledge it, but the cerebral shape of the formation was obvious now.

Then… they parted. Like Moses parting the Red Sea, the great cloud separated down the middle. What I thought to be sunlight was re-emerging, clawing its way out of the dark mass, but it wasn’t sunlight. It wasn’t anything close.

The sky between the clouds cracked and splintered, and it ruptured. A vast split cleaved apart the heavens, widening into a gaping fissure, leading to somewhere else entirely. It was so bright. God, it felt like staring into a military flashlight. I had to shield my eyes from certain damage.

The colourless void stirred. Out of the fractured sky, uncountable strands fell out like dangling ropes. Only, they were huge, unfathomably so. They danced about the orange peaks like pale snakes, but they weren’t… they were that same pure, blinding flame that had plagued this journey.

And every single one slithered through the air towards me. Every last one. They were distant still, but even then I could feel the radiating hunger that wanted to eat all that I was, everything I’d ever known.

I let out a shriek, which was retorted by a deafening wail. A sound that was the embodiment of the collective despair of tortured minds. I hated it so much, nothing since has come close to instilling the raw terror I had in that moment.

I scrambled to my feet and turned, almost falling again as my feet slipped on the ground. At that time I could have beaten a champion sprinter, doped by pure adrenaline. I fear that I’d not been soon enough, as I felt a weight, something of substance, crawling out from my eyes and ears, caught in the gravity of my pursuer. The skin on my face bubbled, small patches sloughing away with my air resistance. To this day, I have never felt such a scathing heat. As if the flames of Lucifer himself were reaching out to me, lapping at my soul.

Dreading the loss of anything else, my mind went blank as all power was directed to my legs. My feet were in agony, slapping down on rocks and dust over and over, and my chest felt tight. I would still rather die from a heart attack than be caught.

I felt my consciousness slipping, blotches covering my vision like I’d stared at the sun for too long. I didn’t slow one bit, though. It was like my body had entered full autopilot. As the red and purple spots spread over my sight, I heard words spoken to me. Well, not spoke, more like something had hijacked my internal monologue in order to convey itself.

“…not return, not yet, for thy self is sweet and succulent, to be savoured. Long has it been…”

That’s all I could remember in any meaningful way. Invasive thoughts of oblivion swam about my head, and at this point I was practically blind.

I don’t remember much of the next part. There were several “blinks” in perception, and each time I caught glimpses, vague outlines of new surroundings. The blinks became less frequent, and I came back to full lucidity to find myself teetering on the edge of a steep hill.

I’d learned not to look and see what was behind by now, so I shot down the slope, almost skating with my trainers as skiis. An intense flash of light hit my eyes and I feared for the worst, but it went as quickly as it had come.

Clenching my eyelids a couple of times to clear my vision, I could see that the light had been reflected off of a vehicle’s hood. A grey range-rover. Annie’s range-rover. It didn’t even register to me at first that it was likely I didn’t have the keys. In fact, I wasn’t even aware of the pack slung over my back until I slowed to a stop and felt its weight.

I tore it off, unzipping to reveal the contents. No tent, of course, but I still had my notepad and laptop, mostly undamaged by some miracle. A few wires, empty wrappers… no key.

My heart dropped, but I persisted and shook the bag up and down. There was definitely something rattling in there, and I remembered the pouch on the inside of the bag. The lip was hidden at first, but I reached in and grasped something cold and hard.

I’m not saying I would live through all of that again to experience the same feeling, but the unadulterated, euphoric relief that rushed over me was incomparable. I did indeed have the keys to the rover.

Not skipping a beat, I fumbled to unlock the driver side door, and clambered inside. The first comfortable seat in hours. I sat there for a good ten minutes before I even considered starting her up, letting my pulverised joints recover. It would be a real shame to die in a car accident after only just escaping with my life, and sanity.

I won’t bore you detailing the drive, but I felt a deep sense of regret the whole way home. Surely I could have done something to save Annie. I mean, she didn’t have any brain to speak of now, but I feel that killing her would have been a mercy. It kills me to know that she’s out there somewhere, in the clutches of that… thing.

The shock started its onset barely five minutes from home. The burning pain radiating across my face was subdued. I just about managed to get back and park safely. I exited the car and opened my front door, stepping inside with total vacancy. I made it a few steps into the living room before, ultimately, my legs gave out, and I collapsed from exhaustion.

I woke up later, seeing it had already started to grow dark outside. For a blissful moment, I was spared the memories of all that had happened. It was short-lived though, and as it came rushing back, my eyes widened and I jumped up off the floor.

I called 911 and requested an officer. Who could’ve guessed to see Davis standing on my porch, after opening the door to urgent-sounding knocks.

I explained everything. Well, not everything, in truth. I wasn’t even sure if I could understand half of what I’d witnessed, and I didn’t want to come off as bat-shit crazy while giving a formal report, even if it was with Davis.

I think he could tell I needed the rest, and told me he’d come back tomorrow to discuss further. A missing persons report was filed immediately, since we’d already been out on the trail for a few days, and a recovery team was sent out to the Salt Point trails.

The case was kept confidential, so I don’t really know much beyond that. I even felt a pang of guilt, having them sent out to that place, in that they might also never come back.

What I do know is they never found Annie. Not that it surprised me. Even if they did, she may as well be dead, and likely would be if she ever left that place.

I never want to go back there. Ever. The fear of losing your entire self, all that composes you, is something I’ve never come to terms with. It is the feeling of unimaginable loss, becoming irretrievable in the hands of something old. Something hungry.

Still, I’ve tried to look into the place over and over again. There’s nothing on satellite images, but the strangest thing is that no matter how I try to remember, to remind myself of where it was, or how exactly to get there, I never learn anything. It’s like the knowledge is permanently lost, like even if I were to dedicate every day of the rest of my life to discovering it, I’d turn up empty handed. Empty headed, rather.

That in itself terrifies me to no end. The fact that something so trivial as a location is now forbidden, my mind repelling any attempts to re-learn the whereabouts. I know where the Salt Point trails are, where the car was parked, but beyond that I cannot fathom.

I would write for Annie here, the whole, “if you’re out there,” thing, but I know in my heart that she will find no rest. Only eternal dissolution, the total loss of everything unique and dear to her. One could see it as a hell of sorts, to be an undying being of unbiased perception, knowing and remembering all from everywhere, but without the ability to solidify any of those thoughts or memories.

I don’t think I’m gonna try to sell this story after all. It would be an insult to my partner in crime, but even disregarding that, it would just read as a jumbled mess of nonsensical events, likely the deranged hallucinations of a sun-stricken man.

So I think I’ll just keep these posts up, on here. This is a warning. There’s something deep in the hills of Utah, and it is not benevolent. It is unnatural. A deceiver between the peaks. This is not just a piece of creative writing. If you were to encounter whatever is out there, you’ll wish you’d never been born. Endless non-existence is child’s play in the face of it.

I don’t think anything I was told there was true. Well, maybe, but a heavily warped truth. One that even the monks themselves could not see through. I fear for them all, that beyond a shadow of a doubt, they have been deceived.

What else can I say? If you ever find yourself deep in the hiking trails of Utah, or anywhere else, and you see alien clouds whirling in the sky… turn around, never look back, and do your best to forget. There is nothing there worth investigating.
