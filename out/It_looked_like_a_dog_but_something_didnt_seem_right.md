I honestly don't think anyone will believe me when I say this since a lot of people claim stories to be "true" when they most likely aren't. But I can promise you that this was something truly unforgettable. 

A few years ago I worked at a PF Changâ€™s not too far from me. Not a bad job as it was something to keep me busy and earn myself some money before starting my next semester of college. 

One night, it was just like any other night. Things were slowing down and I was headed home. I took the route I normally took and honestly nothing didn't seem off about the night. Well, this wasn't until I noticed that I was the only car on the road. For clarification, my shifts typically ended around 10:30 and there aren't too many cars driving at the time especially on the weekdays. But, I would at least see a few pairs of headlights on my commute home. On that night, however, there weren't any. The night was still and quiet, but I didn't really pay much attention to it honestly since I had my music playing through my car speakers. But, little did I know that I was about to see something that I could only describe as "something that clearly didn't belong." 

I turned onto the road that leads up to the stop sign turning into my development. At that very moment my eyes immediately focused on... some thing that was right in front of me. The creature was about two or three car's lengths away from me so I got a pretty good look at it. The creaturr was on the road walking towards me on all fours head on. 

If I could give a description of this thing I would say that it looked like a dog... but something didn't seem right. First off, it was much too big to be a dog. You might say "it might have been just a big dog" but I know it couldn't have been. And secondly, by the way the creature "walked" it didn't look at all natural. It was in a crouch-like position as it walked like it was curious as to what I was. And IF it was a dog or any other natural woodland creature it would have moved as I approached, right? Like at least run away or something. Its almost like it was "pretending" to be a dog. It's eyes glowed too, either from its nocturnal nature or something otherworldly. It was light in color, probably gray, but my headlights didn't directly shine onto it and it was partially in the dark. 

Keep in mind I kept on driving forward while I was looking at it and at that moment I just wanted to get the hell away from that thing. When I made the turn into my development I didn't look back... I couldn't. This might sound silly but I was worried that it might follow me home. 

Luckily it didn't. But I can promise that, that night I didn't get much sleep. And to this day it left an impression in my memory that I could never shake off. If what I saw was just a normal animal then something was definitely wrong with it. But if it was what I thought it was then there's a chance this creature is still out there lurking. Every so often get the feeling that IT may be out there watching me.
