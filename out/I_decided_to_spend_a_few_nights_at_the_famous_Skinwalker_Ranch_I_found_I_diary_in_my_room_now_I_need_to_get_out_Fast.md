For context, I’m a real thrill seeker and a fan of anything horror related, So as soon as I heard about Skinwalker Ranch, I jumped at the opportunity to spend a few nights there, see what’s got people freaked out so much.

I decided to make the trip, since I live in New Mexico, I was looking at about a 3 hour trip to the ranch. I packed up my things and began the drive down.

As soon as I arrived, I laughed. “This is what everyone is shitting their pants about?” It was just a small ranch, filled with farm animals and friendly people.

I decided to check in, when I noticed I was the only visitor, everyone else was just a worker on this ranch, or at the front desk. “Weird.” I thought. But shrugged it off. “People will believe any tourist bullshit.” That was the thought left in my head as I walked out to my cabin rental.

I settled into the place at around 5 pm, I was going to open the drawers to find a tv remote, when I found the diary.

“What the fuck is this?” I said to myself. I opened it up to reveal 3 entries, dating back to about 20 years ago. I began to read:

Day 1: July 16th 2002, 7:38 pm

I just arrived at the ranch, and I’ll say, it’s not as terrifying as everyone makes it out to be. I figured I would use this journal to document my stay here, I’m gonna be here for 5 days after all, may as well make some use out of it.

Day 2: July 17th 2002, 4:50 am

I just woke up to a loud bang, I sounded like it came from the roof of my cabin, but that’s not possible, since there are no trees near the cabin. It may have been a vulture. I’ll check it out later.

Day 2: July 17th 2002, 3:03 pm

I decided to check out the roof, but when I climbed up to it, there were no feathers or anything, just claw marks.
I was freaked out of course, but I dismissed it and thought they have probably been there for a while.

Day 2: July 17th 2002, 11:30 pm

I was woken up yet again, except this time, I heard screams coming from outside, except they sounded off, like something trying to sound human, but definitely not human.

Day 3: July 18th 2002, 8:05 pm

They’ve come for me.

The Skinwalkers. Their hungry. 

I’ve been hiding in my cabin since 7:30 when the screams and clawing at my door began, I don’t know what to do, but whoever reads this, get out while you can. You wont survive here. I know I won’t.
————————————————————

The entries ended there. “Holy shit.” I said out loud. I was about to exit my cabin to show the front desk this and demand an explanation, when I heard a high pitched scream

That’s when I realized. I’m too late. They’re hungry.
