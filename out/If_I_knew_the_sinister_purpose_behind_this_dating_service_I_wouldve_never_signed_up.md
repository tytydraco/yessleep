It all started when my friend Kim who was obsessed with dating apps and constantly complaining about her lack of success on them, told me about this new app that she liked. At the time it was called Bodleu, though it has ceased to function since, unless it’s now operating under a different name. 

When I first opened the app, it had an elegant black and white design, very fifties like. Kim had sworn by it after successfully finding her match following five years of failure, and I went in expecting a classy version of Tinder. Instead, the app asked me to fill out their online form and attach three photos. If my “application” was “accepted,” I would hear from them “soon.” I sent in my photos and kept checking my e-mail every day for a month, but heard nothing. Kim wasn’t particularly concerned.

“I got my invitation three months later,” she said. “I think they do a background check and everything. They don’t let in just anyone.”

She meant to sound reassuring, but the month after my application, I started having doubts. If they were so exclusive, then why was membership free? Like, who paid for those background checks? Then there was the application itself, which, considering they were doing a background check, was surprisingly short, limited to my name, height, weight, eye color, birth date, occupation, and a short summary of my dating history. 

They seemed much more concerned with my photos, with the image upload form surrounded by an essay length list of bullet points that must have been at least fifty times as long as the questionnaire. I was warned that any photos I uploaded could get rejected for poor lighting, being over a year old (I had to make sure the date they were taken was displayed clearly on the photo, which had to match its metadata), having other people in them, makeup (I was only allowed to submit photos where I was bare-faced for some reason), choice of clothing (nothing baggy to “avoid misrepresenting my body shape,” including no high heels), presence of piercings or tattoos (which supposedly interfered with a “clear” view of my features), and other silly things. 

After another month passed and I still didn’t hear anything from Bodleu, I gradually forgot about it. Long ago, I had come to the conclusion that each life was unique and what worked for other people never worked for me. This was just further proof of this. I moved on with my life (nine-to-five at a start-up which was chronically on the brink of either break-out success or filing for bankruptcy, nights with my TV and mornings at the gym, weekends sleeping late and avoiding any kind of plans) and let Kim know that I appreciated the tip, but it didn’t work out in my case.

And then one rainy Saturday as I was aimlessly watching a video of a mama gorilla hoisting a baby gorilla over her head, I got a new message in my inbox. It was from someone named Doby Bodleu who introduced himself as the “founder” of Bodleu and congratulated me on “joining” their “family.” My new membership was effective immediately. I did a little high-five with the screen. Maybe I would get a Kim-style happy-ever-after after all. 

And then I finished reading the message. My “match” was already pre-selected. It was someone by the name of Oliver and my date with him was booked for the following Monday at some restaurant I had never heard of. It was odd for it to be on a workday rather than the weekend, but I figured I had nothing to lose. 

On the appointed day at the scheduled time, Oliver picked me up. He was gorgeous in an it’s-suspicious-that-you’re-still-single kind of way, with the sort of intensity in his eyes that seemed to x-ray your soul. After we arrived at the restaurant, he made a point of putting his arm around me the moment we sat down. The gesture was oddly intimate, considering we had known each other for all of thirty seconds. Even weirder was that it didn’t match his eyes, which seemed to radiate coldness. 

After ordering dinner for both of us, Oliver then had another couple join us—who were twice our age. When I whispered “what the fuck,” he quickly explained the strangers were his boss Laurent and his wife Silvia. Before I could get the hell out of there, his boss shook my hand and was strangely friendly with me, as if we had met each other before. Silvia, while less friendly, kept asking me about my condo (I live in a house) and “that darling puppy” (my only pet is a cat). No matter how many times I corrected her, she kept going as if I haven’t said anything. This was followed up by her asking Oliver if we’ll start planning for a baby (I’ve known Oliver for a grand total of thirty minutes by this point, and them for twenty-five minutes). After Oliver responded with a nod that made me want to slap him, they segued into a detailed discussion of some complicated business deal they were due to close the next morning, before switching the conversation to a former employee and co-worker of Oliver’s by the name of Dustin. 

“Heard he finally got out of that mental institution yesterday,” Laurent said. 

I nearly chocked on my soup.

“Just as scheduled,” Oliver said. “Horrible timing, I know.”

Laurent suddenly tensed up.

“Did you just say ‘just as scheduled’?” he asked Oliver.

“I paid someone over there to keep me updated. Considering everything that happened, I didn’t want to take any chances,” Oliver said. 

Laurent and Silvia exchanged glances. There was a long pause, and then: 

“I knew his mother in high school, you know?” Silvia said. “Every boy who broke-up with her seemed to mysteriously perish afterwards.”

“Sounds like a vengeful psychopath,” Laurent said. 

“First one that didn’t break up with her, was the one she married,” Silvia continued. “Of course it later turned out he wasn’t entirely…normal either.” 

At that point, I had lost all of my remaining appetite, and picked at my roasted chicken after my half-eaten soup was taken away by a concerned-looking waiter.

“Remind me why we hired Dustin again?” Laurent asked his wife. “I mean, aside from ‘*his looks will draw the clients in’*.” 

Silvia blushed, but didn’t respond, all but confirming that she had been ‘drawn in’ by his looks herself. A moment of silence followed as everyone ate, with Laurent finishing his meal first.

“Anyway, nice seeing you two,” he said as soon as his plate was empty. “Oliver, see you tomorrow. Get ready for your bonus.” He winked at him and left, with Silvia trailing behind. As soon as they were gone, I turned to Oliver.

“What the hell was that?” I asked.

“Sorry, I thought if I mentioned I needed a date for a dinner with my boss you’d run for the hills.”

“It’s not just that,” I said. “Why did he and his wife act like we already met?”

“Really? I didn’t notice,” Oliver said.

The date was a complete disappointment, but at least Oliver paid for the food. My main mistake—besides showing up—was to agree to be picked up by him instead of using my own car. And now I relied on him to drive me back.

After his boss left and I finished eating, Oliver promptly stood up from the table and silently accompanied me to his car. During the drive, I suddenly became wildly sleepy to the point that I could barely keep my eyes open. I no longer trusted Oliver, but remaining awake was becoming so hard. Did he put something in my drink? But not in front of his boss, surely? Probably before. But why? Before I could further analyze what the hell was happening, I fell asleep.

When I came to, it was inside his spacious house filled with chandeliers, impressionist paintings, and marble floors. I found myself on the couch, still dressed in my outfit from the restaurant, with Oliver sitting nearby and typing something on his laptop. The moment I opened my eyes, he stood up and brought me a glass of water.

“No, thank you,” I said, refusing to take it for fear it was drugged as well.

“You were dehydrated and passed out in my car,” Oliver said, “but suit yourself.” And drank the glass in front of me. I stared at him. Okay, so this particular drink wasn’t drugged, but that still didn’t explain why I, as he put it, ‘passed out’ in his car.

“I want to go home,” I said. 

“Can’t help you there. It’s already past midnight, and I have to get up early for work. Tomorrow, I promise.”

“I’ll call a taxi,” I said. “Where’s my purse?”

Oliver pointed to the opposite end of the couch where I had slept, and I quickly grabbed it. But my cell phone was not inside.

”What the hell? Did you take my cell phone?” I couldn’t keep my fear out of my voice.

“Excuse me?” Oliver remained his unshaken self. 

“My cell phone. It was in my purse. It’s not there anymore.”

Oliver raised an eyebrow, but didn’t say anything.

“So give me your phone, then,” I said. 

“The battery’s dead, I just put it on charger.”

“Landline?”

“Sorry, I only use my cell phone.”

The longer I was around Oliver, the more he gave me the creeps. The problem was that it was too dark outside to see clearly where I was going, and a quick look out the window revealed that Oliver’s house sat on a somewhat isolated plot of land. Then there was the matter that I didn’t even know where I was, since I had fallen asleep before we got here. There was no guarantee I would be safer outside than inside.

“Listen, we’ll figure it out in the morning. In the meantime, you can stay in the guest bedroom,” Oliver said casually.

There was not much choice for me at this point, so I reluctantly followed him to a bedroom on the second floor, which was located at the head of the stairs. After briefly showing me around, he left, closing the door softly behind him.

When I got a good look around, I realized the ‘guest room’ where he left me in fact looked nothing like a guest room. It was much too personal, with a closet full of women’s clothing, frilly pink curtains, and a calendar hanging above the bed with handwritten notes in the margins. 

But it was when I opened the nightstand drawer while trying to find some tissues that I came across a picture frame that had been tucked away. As I prepared to put it back, I caught sight of the picture inside. And gasped. 

It was a picture of me on horseback. Or rather, someone who looked like me, since I never wore this particular outfit, and had no idea how to ride a horse. Oliver was also in the picture, holding the hand of a little boy and smiling up at the horse. 

And then, just as I was putting the picture back into the drawer, I saw something else underneath it. A crumpled up piece of paper that I slowly unfolded. It turned out to be a note, handwritten in all caps. 

YOU CAN HIDE

OR YOU CAN SIT

BUT I’LL FIND YOU

AND YOU KNOW IT

Underneath the text was a grotesque hand-drawn illustration of a stick figure with long hair and a bow being ambushed by a hooded figure. 

I put the note in my pocket and closed the drawer, but it was useless trying to fall asleep after that**,** as a series of horrible thoughts entered my mind. What if Oliver was ‘Dustin’ and his ‘boss and boss’s wife’ were actually his crazy parents? How could I know for sure that all three of them hadn’t just been released from the mental institution? Maybe Oliver had been terrorizing his wife who had escaped and had found me as his next victim… And here I was, in the middle of nowhere, stuck in the house with him in the middle of the night, with no phone and no immediate way out. 

Forget about sleeping. I jumped up from the bed and was about to burst out of the room, when I heard a creak outside the door, causing me to freeze mid-movement. 

“Oliver?” I called out.

But there was silence, followed by a louder creak. A moment later, the doorknob began to quietly turn. Definitely not Oliver. I could hear my heart thudding in my ears as I checked to see if the door had a lock, but there was nothing there. So I did the only thing I could think of. Just as the door slowly opened, I dove under the bed.

“Mommy!” 

It was a child’s voice. Probably the same boy as the one on the photo, looking for his mother. I immediately relaxed. 

“Mommy, where are you?” It was louder this time. Poor thing. 

I reluctantly crawled out of the bed, hoping to avoid scaring the kid too much by my presence. Maybe we could search for Oliver together and I could at least ask him about the woman in the photo. The one his boss must have mistaken me for. And then I screamed.

The visitor was a fully grown man that had tricked me into thinking he was a child. He was wearing a dark gray latex mask and gloves, with the rest of his body hidden behind a gray latex suit. As he stared at me, I almost screamed. The irises of his eyes were blood red and seemed to glow in the dark. 

“Arissa.” He said the name in a mocking tone of voice, finally sounding like his real age. It was clear this was someone he really hated. But it wasn’t my name. 

“I’m not Arissa!” I yelled, just as I noticed what he was holding an ax in his hands. 

He froze for a moment, looking me over. 

“I’m not Arissa!” I repeated. “I don’t even know her. Or Oliver for that matter, whom I just met for the first time today through a freaking online dating site, okay?”

He didn’t respond, but continued blocking my way out of the room. Where the hell was Oliver? We stood there for what felt like an eternity, before he spoke again:

“I don’t believe you.” 

And then before I could properly process the words, he launched at me. 

The ax missed me by mere inches, with reflex taking over and saving me at the last moment. But the nightstand to my right was now irrevocably ruined, cracked open by the blow of the ax. As the masked stranger tried to retrieve the ax, I ran the hell out of there, almost slipping down a flight of stairs. 

Oliver had turned all the lights off, so it was hard to see. While I searched for the front door, I could hear loud footsteps behind me, and the steady thud of the ax hitting the marble floor, getting increasingly closer. 

Oliver’s house was more like a mansion, and I was getting more lost by the minute. Just as it became clear that the masked stranger would reach me before I reached the front door, I slid into the room closest to me and softly closed the door, so he wouldn’t hear.  The house was like a maze and with a little bit of luck, he wouldn’t know what room I went into which would buy me a bit of time.

As luck would have it, this particular room had a window, which was almost ground level. The problem was that it wasn’t the easiest of windows to open, and applying full force would definitely make a sound. 

“Arissa!” 

I heard the sound of various doors opening and closing. He was down the hall now, getting closer and closer to the room I was in. Fuck the noise. I pulled the window open with all my might, and jumped out—just as he barged into the room. 

I could hear him climbing out after me, but I didn’t wait long enough to actually see it. It was pitch dark and I had no idea where I was going. Somewhere along the way, I saw a figure beside the tree, middling around and smoking. With no guarantee I would see anyone else along the way and with no idea where I was going, I stopped mid-run and approached the figure.

“Help me!” I screamed, as the figure turned toward me. 

And then I gasped. It was Oliver, looking just as shocked as me.

“How are you still—“ He abruptly paused, mid-sentence, but what he was about to say had been clear enough.

“Alive?” I finished for him. “You did this all on purpose, didn’t you?”

But before Oliver could respond, I saw the glowing red eyes just inches from us, wielding the ax high up in the air as the gloved hands aimed for the kill. Another moment and he would—

Oliver screamed, just as I jumped to the side. The ax grazed him, before the stranger raised the ax for a second blow. Oliver tried to shield himself with me, but at the last moment, I somehow managed to duck away again, slipping out from under his sweaty palms a semi-second before I heard an ear-splitting crunch, followed by Oliver howling in pain. 

I didn’t wait around to be next. Screaming as loudly as I could to attract the maximum amount of attention despite the midnight sky being my only companion, I ran without having any clue as to where I was going. I have no idea how long I kept running, until I finally somehow managed to reach the main road. A gray Honda Civic stopped right in front of me, hitting on the brakes so loudly that I shrieked. 

“Oh dear! What were you doing running out into traffic like that?” The question came from a middle-aged woman in the passenger’s seat, while her well-dressed husband in the driver’s seat cursed under his breath. 

“I need to get home! Please!” I gave them my address, desperately begging them to not drive away from me. The husband really wanted to, but the wife looked sympathetic.

“We’ll get you there, honey. And no more drugs, okay? It never ends well,” she said.

I didn’t bother correcting her. All that mattered was that they had agreed to get me the hell out of there and for that I was grateful. After giving them my address, I got into the backseat and closed the door. The husband started up the car and I put on my seatbelt. A little longer, and it would be all over. I closed my eyes, allowing myself to exhale in relief as I heard the sound of the engine running. A moment later, the car began moving. 

By this point, I was feeling so tired that I almost fell asleep again. Almost. For minutes later, the car abruptly braked. Probably traffic light, I decided, but opened my eyes anyway, just as I heard the man’s voice:

“Another hitchhiker, dammit! One more, and I swear I’ll—“

The rest of his sentence was drowned out by the sound of the woman next to him opening her door.

“I’m sorry, I got a little lost.” 

I looked up at the speaker. It was an elderly man, apologizing to the woman. 

“That’s alright, do you need any help?” the woman asked. “We might as well give you a ride.”

The elderly man gazed at them, before his gaze found me in the backseat. And then it stopped, staying on me for a moment too long. Or was I just growing paranoid?

“Thank you,” he said after a long pause, before opening the back door and sitting down next to me. 

A moment later, the car started up again. But this time when we began moving, I felt a creepy sense of uneasiness, the reason for which I couldn’t firmly put a finger on. 

As the car gained speed, I couldn’t look away from the elderly man, unsettled by the way he kept staring at me. While the car drove on ahead and the dark road became better lighted, the night lights streamed in from the window and for the first time fully illuminated my fellow passenger’s face. 

The first thing I noticed was that the elderly man’s face looked somewhat unnatural. The skin was wrinkled, but in the wrong places. The face had almost a frozen quality to it, like a mask. And then I saw the red eyes. 

I screamed so loudly that the man slammed on the brakes, barely missing a lamp post. A moment later, his outraged wife got out of the car and proceeded to kick me out. So distracted was she while screaming at me and calling me a drug-addled schizophrenic as we were standing on the side of the road, that she failed to notice as the back door opened behind her. So lost in his own thoughts was the husband, cursing about how much he was wearing out the brakes and how expensive it would be to replace them, that he missed the moment when the ‘elderly man’ opened up his coat and pulled out an ax. Only at the last moment did the woman finally turn around—letting out a bloodcurdling scream of her own.

A moment later, two cars pulled to a stop beside us after the ax attracted attention. While the driver of the first car yelled something frantically into her cell phone, a group of three men got out from the second car and started heading in our direction. After a moment of hesitation, the ‘elderly man’ shot me one last sinister look before finally dropping his ax and running away like a man several decades younger, vanishing behind the dark woods along the road. 

\*\*\*

I finally got home hours later, after telling the couple driving me home the whole story. They urged me to file a police report and even offered to go in with me, but all I wanted to do was to put the whole nightmare behind me.

I had barely closed my front door, when the phone rang. It was Kim complaining about not being able to reach me on my cell phone and asking me about how yesterday’s date went. But when I finished telling her about the absolute disaster that meeting Oliver had been, her answer surprised me.

“You know, I always thought there was something off about that dating site,” she said.

“Excuse me? I was only on there because you recommended it!”

There was a little pause, and then:

“It just took so damn long for Bodleu to respond to my application and there were so many damn rules about only submitting ‘authentic photos’—whatever that means—that at one point I almost gave up. But at least it did hook me up with this rich old guy, Evan. The dates were like something out of a fairytale. Or would have been, if the people around him didn’t keep mistaking me for his niece.”

I stared at the phone as Kim continued.

“But the real funny thing was that when I finally got around to googling his niece, who actually did look similar to me, it turned out that she had vanished. So weird right?”

“Kim, where are you right now?” I gripped the phone.

“Where would I be? With Evan, of course. We’re on his yacht.”

“Get the hell out of there!” I said. “He probably killed his niece and is using you to cover it up!” 

There was a pause, as I waited Kim to respond. And then her phone was disconnected.

\*\*\*

It took me a while to piece together what had happened on my own ‘date.’ Since Oliver had avoided providing his last name and his boss had been introduced by his first name only, I called up the restaurant where we had shared the dinner and pressured them into giving me Oliver’s full name. He had paid for the dinner with his credit card, and I pretended I wanted to pay him back. 

With Oliver’s name in hand, I was able to find out the company he had been working for through his Linked In profile, as well as track down another employee who had it listed as his active employer. A man by the name of Dustin. From there, I went through the rest of my search results.

Putting in Dustin’s full name alongside the company’s name yielded a photo of what he looked like in real life (surprisingly attractive but expressionless, with soulless eyes hidden by blood-red contact lenses) alongside a local story about him stalking the wife of a co-worker after briefly meeting her at the company Christmas party and becoming obsessed with her. 

The wife’s name had been Arissa and her husband Oliver had tried everything to get Dustin fired. None of it worked—until Dustin threatened to sabotage a major deal their company was due to sign off on that had been put together by Oliver, if Arissa didn’t ‘sacrifice herself’ to him. That threat—combined with him turning up at Oliver’s residence multiple times in a goblin costume—was what had ultimately landed Dustin in a psychiatric facility. Apparently, the same one he had been released from the night before mine and Oliver’s ‘date.’

From there, I put the pieces together. Oliver had used the dating service hoping to find someone who looked enough like his wife to fool Dustin so he could finally leave him and the real Arissa alone, while going through with the business deal in peace. Inviting me to the restaurant had been a test. If his boss believed I was indeed Arissa, then Oliver would drive me to his house where crazy Dustin could finish whatever sinister intents he had had, without Oliver paying the price for it. The real Arissa would be safe and sound, while his employer would sign off on the deal scheduled for next morning, with Oliver receiving his bonus.

It was a win-win…for everyone but me. I then thought about Kim’s situation. If Oliver only pretended to date me so he could pass me off as his wife and Evan dated Kim so he could pass her off as his niece…then what was the real purpose of this ‘dating’ service? 

Impulsively, I logged on to the Bodleu platform and searched for their contact information. But the only information provided was that of its founder, the enigmatic Doby Bodleu. The same one who had sent me the welcome e-mail after months of silence following my application submission. I took a chance and e-mailed him my horrible dating story, adding that after my conversation with Kim she had abruptly stopped answering my calls and I had no idea if she was safe or not. 

Doby never responded. I began to wonder if he even ever existed. A day later, the Bodleu site was abruptly taken down, replaced by a “Page Not Found” message. Despite using different search engines and combinations of key words, I was never able to find it again, with all traces of it scrubbed off the internet. Repeat e-mails to Doby led to my e-mails being returned as ‘undeliverable.’ 

I then tried to file a police report, but I had no witnesses and no proof I even used the site other than my welcome e-mail which the cops were quick to dismiss. Since the site was no longer active, one of them told me, there was nothing much they could do. But what about Kim, I had asked them, to which they shrugged their shoulders. No one else had reported her missing and they had no jurisdiction over international waters. I continued arguing with them, but it was useless. As far as the police was concerned: No website, no crime. No body, no crime.

It was only while redoing the keyword search for the thousandth time during one drunk Saturday evening after unsuccessfully trying to track down its parent company, that I finally understood the real purpose behind the ‘dating’ service founded by “Doby Bodleu.”

It had been there all along, but in anagram form: Body Double.
