Every story starts in once upon a time and has a happy ending, there was nothing to be happy about.
I’ve been dating Ruby for over a year, we were getting closer and closer to having sex but it was bound to happen sometime soon because we’ve had no arguments, just straight up happiness. It’s currently Sunday 3rd September 2026, Ruby went to go get McDonalds just a couple roads away, came home and we ate like normal. The dog wanted some of my fries per usual, the cheeky bugger. 
“Josh, can we talk?” Ruby sounds quite uneasy, she was never sad infront of me, this time it did look quite serious, by her facial expressions, she wanted to speak about it with me for a long time. “Look Josh, if we want this relationship to turn into marriage, we have to step up our game a bit. You said you wanted sex, that’s what I want to. But we’ve never seemed to get to that point…”
Wow, the talk is getting somewhere.
“Look Ruby, I want it too but-“ her phone buzzes.
“Shit, I have to go into work. Sorry Josh I love you.” We kissed each other and she walked out heading to work. Her shift was meant to end at 9:00PM and it’s currently 7:00PM, was quite a short shift but god knows what she’s doing after, I don’t know

I headed out to the pub, reflecting on what Ruby said in that talk. Kept my head up and stayed positive, there were a couple people I could speak to about girls, we could all relate to our girls because they’re all the same type, mainly because we met up at this exact pub as it was their ladies night out. 
About 6 to 9PM, we managed to get drunk and we was forced to walk home, had to leave the car with TJ our bar attendee. First, I went to see Ruby at work but her manager Doris said ‘Ruby was meant to be at work today Josh, do you know what’s up?’
‘N-no. No I don’t, did she call in?’
‘Nope, she’s my top employee. She’s also meant to be paid today. Oh well. Keep me updated Josh. Bye.

I came home broken into pieces, drunk and sober. I see a letter saying “OPEN ME” in bloody and quite scribbly handwriting. I open the neatly folded letter reading: “Come and find me, your girlfriend is with me. Times ticking. Cunt.” She’s missing, it’s all in handwriting, was she abducted or just somewhere like a terrible place. The someone forgot to take her phone because I have her location on Find My iPhone. Didn’t realize that?

She was located over an hour away, I was given 48 hours to find her or she could have been fatally killed. She was my life, I was never going to give up on her. 
Seemed like she was kidnapped in the forest. Probably hung up on a tree. This was all according to her Find My iPhone. I could hear her yelling my name “JOSH!!!!” repeated 10 times. Everytime, it was sounding like her crying. I have found the right place.
I took one step and have a knife placed at neck point. “One more bad step, and you’re fucking gone. You understand me?” 
“Fuck you pervert, you stripped my girl in embarrassment as a 60 year old man!” I had to learn my karate moves and use them even if I got murdered.
About 10 moves later, he was bleeding out. “Go to hell. Cunt.” A swearing warning should have been appropriate for this story but we’ll cope. 
Life lesson girls. It’s not nice in the dark. You’ll Never Walk Alone.
