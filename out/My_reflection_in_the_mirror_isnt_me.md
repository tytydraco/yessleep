Over the course of my entire life, I’ve experienced things that’ve led me to believe that my reflection is not me. No, not just “believe”, but know that it isn’t me. I’ve never met anyone with the same problem, so you can imagine how crazy this has driven me. Every time I see myself in a mirror, or on any reflective surface, I know that whatever I’m looking at may look like me, but it isn’t, it’s something else.  
  
I hope by leaving this here I’m, at best, able to find someone with some knowledge on what’s happening to me, or that at the least, I can tell someone what’s going on.  
  
The furthest instance I can trace back to me realizing something was off, is not even one I remember clearly since I was only five years old.  
  
I was at my great grandmother’s house with my family celebrating Christmas. I was fortunate enough to have gotten to know my great grandmother, and her house felt really magical to a five year old. This was mainly due to the fact that her house was pretty large. It was three stories including a really nice basement with a guest room, and since my great grandmother had trouble with stairs, the basement and second floor were basically just used as storage rooms giving them a lonely and half-lived-in feeling. Whenever I explored them as a child I felt that maybe I was doing something wrong, or something wasn’t right, yet the rooms were still so much fun to explore and re-explore.  
  
Anyways, as my family was opening presents and the attention was nowhere specific, I must’ve wandered off, because I went missing for three days. No one had any idea where I was or where I could’ve gone, and even though my parents expended a great effort searching for me, I wasn’t found.  
  
Eventually though, I was found by my great grandmother sitting in her living room. I seemed as though I hadn’t even left her house, which was impossible since it was the first place anyone looked. Another improbable thing was that I was in perfect health for a five year old that had disappeared for three days, which introduced the disturbing idea that maybe I had been taken care of by someone.  
  
There were plenty of somewhat rational reasons for my health, but something my parents couldn't ever really get over was that supposedly when they asked where I had been I told them,  
  
“I was playing. I was playing and there was someone watching me play.”  
  
All I remember from that day was playing in my great grandmother’s house. I’m not even sure if it was the same day as when I disappeared, but something makes me feel like it was. I remember specifically sitting in one of the house’s bedrooms playing with a set of miniature ceramic houses. Besides that, I remember nothing.  
  
You can imagine how that terrified my parents, but as I grew up, we all seemed to heal from my disappearance somewhat well. I can also see how this doesn’t seem to tie into my current problem, but I’m completely confident that it does.  
  
The second instance I remember happened when I was in elementary school. I must’ve been 11, and I was with some friends after school. They had come over to my house to hang out, and they had been telling me about a trick you could play on your brain. They said if I went into the bathroom with the lights off, lit a candle, and stared into my reflection’s eyes, all of my facial features would start to fade. I was a sucker for those kinds of things so of course I wanted to try it out.  
  
I followed all the rules, and began staring at myself in the mirror. Sure enough, my friends were right, and as my vision began to blur, my mouth and nose went with it. I thought it was cool.  
  
As I stared, a memory quickly flashed through my head and I lost focus. I still don’t know what the memory was, but I remember the feeling of it. It felt like I was in the presence of some sort of perversion. I felt that I was in danger.  
  
I rubbed my eyes gently to hydrate them again, and when I opened them I met my reflection in the mirror. My reflection’s facial features were still missing. This time I could see that my mouth and nose were gone with perfect clarity, and in their place was a featureless patch of skin. In that moment, I felt like my reflection was observing me, like it was curious about me. Within seconds though, my reflection reverted to normal, but the image of my featureless face found a place deep within my memory.  
  
My friends could see that I was pretty shaken up, or at least in total disbelief. I never even tried to explain to them what I saw, because I didn’t even know how much I believed in what I had seen. I had only seen it a few seconds so it was possible I had seen it wrong. They also did tell me that my features would fade, but I assumed they didn’t mean that my features would disappear so clearly.  
  
This was when my low-key fear of mirrors started. Ever since that day I was somewhat creeped out by mirrors or the concept of your own reflection. I also felt that seeing my reflection like that somehow tied into my disappearance when I was younger. I guess it was a hunch of sorts.  
  
My main reason for retelling these events though comes from something that happened to me when I was 18. Long story short, my great grandmother passed away and left us her house. Due to my parents’ eventual divorce and financial status, moving into the house was the best option for us moving forward. I don’t really want to get too into it.  
  
Since I’m the oldest of my siblings I got to pick my room first. At the time I wanted the room with the most privacy so I chose the guest bedroom in the basement. Staying in the basement gave me the entire basement floor at my disposal which felt pretty nice. The foundation of my great grandmother’s house was built upon a hill so even my bedroom in the basement had windows into our backyard due to the slope revealing the basement floor.  
  
Most of my great grandmother’s things got stored. Some of it was sold, but anything that had been in the family stayed. This included a lot of the furniture around the house. This also included a mirror that was in my room. It was on the wall to the right when you walked into the room. By 18 I pretty much ignored my fear of mirrors and reflections, mainly because I was able to convince myself I was just being stupid by having a fear of them. I didn’t even really pay much attention to the mirror when I moved my stuff in, and even after moving in, I didn’t mind it being in my room.  
  
The mirror was really tall, with a dark brown frame that had been intricately carved into flowing patterns. The whole mirror showed signs of age. The frame was worn down, and the mirror itself was covered in mysterious black splotches. I didn't think much of it, the mirror still served its purpose.  
  
Then came the first night in the house. As I was falling asleep I could hear soft thuds coming from somewhere in the basement. It sounded like someone was moving something around, but I couldn’t place where it was coming from. I attributed it to the house being old, and eventually fell asleep.  
  
Now I’m a heavy sleeper, but one of these thuds was loud enough that it woke me up in the early hours of the morning. It sounded as though it had come from just the other side of the wall to my right.  
  
These sounds continued to happen every night, and a lot of the time they sounded so rhythmic that they sounded like footsteps. However the sound of them was mostly very soft, and so I wasn’t ever too bothered by the noises. I got used to them.  
  
A few weeks passed before something happened that caused me to dread the noises. I was once again woken up early in the morning to a loud thud from the wall on my right. This noise had been particularly loud, enough to keep my attention. As I laid there I heard another noise, but this time it was clear that it was a knocking. It was three sequential knocks that sounded to come from one of the windows.  
  
My whole body tensed up, and I got the hell out of my room. For the rest of the night I just chilled on the second floor of the house until I calmed down. I tried talking to my mom, but it was difficult to know how serious the knocking was. I didn’t know if I was just being dumb, or if I actually had a valid concern.  
  
The next night I returned to my bedroom. That night there were no noises. There were no rhythmic thuds or knocks. This honestly freaked me out more than if there had been noises. It made me feel as if the noises were intentionally being made by someone, and my reaction to the noises the previous night had made them scale back their frequency so that I wouldn’t notice.  
  
I was watching YouTube in my bed still feeling tense from last night, when I heard another knock. It was just one knock, but this time it didn’t come from the window. I very clearly heard it come from the mirror. I got up, but this time I turned on the lights and, keeping my distance, looked at the mirror in confusion.  
  
I was so focused on the knock that I didn’t notice one very important thing– I had no reflection. There was no other me, just an eerie, empty mirror. I didn’t understand. At a certain point I just stood there perplexed. Then a hand reached out and knocked once again on the mirror as if knocking on a door. It seemed as though my reflection were hiding directly to the right of the mirror just out of view.  
  
That did enough for me to leave the room for the second night in a row. I spent the entire night upstairs again. What I saw must’ve been a dream of sorts, or I was just tired. Right?  
  
I fell asleep on a couch upstairs, and when I woke up it was nearly noon. The light in the house made me feel generally safe so I went back downstairs. This was when something completely inexplicable happened.  
  
When I got to my room, the mirror was still there, but the glass was gone. My entire room was still reflecting, but there was no glass, meaning I could walk through the mirror and be in the reflection myself. My reflection was also still gone.  
  
I poked my head through the mirror like I was looking into another room of the house. The room was an exact reflection, though the air in the room was much thinner, and very cold. My heart was beating in a way similar to when I had done the trick in the mirror years ago. Like I said, I was a sucker for these kinds of things.  
  
Against my better judgment, I entered the reflected room. I think I went in because I wanted to confirm that what was happening was real. I would also be lying if I said I wasn’t the slightest bit intrigued.  
  
I crept quietly all the way to the doorway of my room and looked out into the hallway. It felt insanely surreal seeing my house completely reflected like this. When I looked out into the hallway, I noticed that the accuracy and decoration of my house got worse the further from my room I got. The hallway outside my room was almost completely devoid of any decoration. Even the wall paper faded from my great grandmother’s floral pattern, to just plain white. It was like I was staring into an undeveloped portion of the world, like I was seeing something that I wasn’t supposed to see.  
  
After a few seconds, I turned to walk back towards the mirror. I wanted to see what my bathroom looked like. This was when I saw something that drenched me in a stifled panic.  
  
Now, I was facing my mirror and looking through to my original room. Obviously, I never saw this side of my room, because in a mirror you only see what it reflects, but I was seeing it for the first time. On the wall that the mirror was leaning up against, hundreds of poorly drawn pictures ran along the border of the mirror like petals around a flower. The paper looked like it had been torn straight out of a composition notebook, and the longer I looked, I realized I couldn’t tell what was holding them up to the wall.  
  
The most disturbing aspect was the drawings. Some of them were just short phrases, some poor scribblings, and others a combination. A large majority of the drawings depicted were of my room, and of a stick figure laying in bed. I just knew these were drawings of my room. The written phrases were short, one read “Nice time with you, miss you”, another read “Beautiful, funny, habits”.  
  
All of the drawings and writings were so clearly about me. It made me nauseous. Someone had been watching me while I had been living in my great grandmother’s house. But how could someone live in the reflection of a mirror?  
  
I needed to leave, but before I left I went to my bathroom to take a quick look. Somehow in my panicked state, I had remained curious about what the mirror in my bathroom reflected. Even reflected images have reflections, and those reflections have reflections.  
  
The bathroom was completely dark. There wasn’t even a light switch. I also noticed that only about half of my toiletries were present. It was strangely empty, like someone had tried to recreate my bathroom from memory.  
  
However, on the sink-counter was a unique item, not in the original bathroom. It was a miniature ceramic house, and underneath it was a folded piece of paper. This was the miniature I had a memory of playing with. My stomach was in a knot. I took it and unfolded the piece of paper that was weighed down under it.  
  
The drawing, I could only assume, was of me. There were miniature houses around me, and to my left was a tall man. The image depicted the man holding a knife and from me there were lines spewing from my stomach that seemed to be blood. Written was the phrase “Love for you”.  
  
The following happened fast. I heard a strangely organic, low buzz emit from the mirror. I looked, but I already knew what it was. It was my featureless reflection. At the same time from the floor above me I heard rapid footsteps. I left the bathroom, legs going numb. The footsteps were now slamming down the stairs to the basement. Whatever was coming was walking uneven, and frantically, yet it was gaining ground unnaturally fast.  
  
In blind fear, I made my way to the mirror and back into my room. As I passed from the reflected room to my room, I felt the presence of something malicious behind me. When I was in my room again, I kept going until I was out in the hallway with my bedroom door held shut. There was no noise from inside my room. It had all happened so fast that I had no time to think on what I had seen, just to give in to pure instinct.  
  
I waited.  
  
Since this encounter, I have had no more experiences with anything in that mirror, or in any reflective surface.  
  
I waited some more.  
  
However, I know that my reflection has got to be something using my face. Sometimes, I feel my reflection looking at me, and I swear I catch glimpses of it staring at me. I don’t know what to do, but I’ve been trying to live with it.  
  
I waited still.  
  
Then muffled from inside my room, “I love you”.
