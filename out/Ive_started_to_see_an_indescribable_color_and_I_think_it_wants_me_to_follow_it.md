At first, it was just a tiny pinpoint at the center of my vision.

I’d wake in the morning, and it’d be there, faintly swimming around my field of view. Rubbing sleep from my eyes didn’t clear it. Nor did cleaning my glasses. The pinpoint would still be there, like it was some featureless gnat buzzing lazy circles within my retina.

The thing annoyed me to no end when it was that small. It interfered with work. I stare at a computer for a living, wrangling unruly excel spreadsheets for clients twenty-times wealthier than I am, and the pinpoint was a pest. It dragged my attention away from the legions of defiant numbers and decimal points.

But it didn’t remain small for long.

Within a few days, the thing grew from a pinpoint to a pixel. Once it was that big, it started to gain definition, and by then, it was no longer a distraction.

Once I could see its color, it became everything to me.

There isn’t any conceivable mixture of human language in existence that can do the color justice, honestly.

It’s bright but not blinding, vivid but not overwhelming.

It’s the vastness of the universe, condensed and refined into a single, perfectly balanced hue.

It’s the tip of God’s finger dancing between my left eye and my right, showing me things you couldn't even imagine.

Honestly, I pity you all. You just cannot understand.

Quitting my job wasn’t difficult. What good is money now that I have that color?

Limiting my sleep to only three hours a night was a little more challenging, but I’ve been able to do it. 

What good are dreams anymore? The color I dream of is a cheap recreation - a poor man’s divinity. For twenty-one hours a day, I lay silently in bed, drinking in every solitary molecule of the color. I fall asleep for three hours, my phone alarm wakes me up, and I watch the color again, rinse and repeat. Needless to say, I haven’t left bed in months.

Removing my eyelids, though - now that was tough.

My atrophied muscles had a hard time steadying the rusty scissors I pulled from the nightstand. But at the end of the day, it was a necessary modification. Closing my eyelids on the color felt extremely impolite, bordering on frankly disrespectful. More than that, I’ve been finding darkness to be utterly repulsive as of late. By definition, it is the complete absence of that color. Of *my* color. 

As I was making the final snip, though, something happened. My withered hand overlapped with the color, but it didn’t just disappear behind it, obscured by its vibrating beauty. No, It plunged *into* it. As my fingers vanished within the smudge, the perfect sensation that lies precisely between pain and pleasure radiated like pins and needles through my unworthy digits - an exercise in exquisite, holy acupuncture.

With my extremity submerged, the color seemed to ripple with excitement, like it was trying to encourage me to continue further in. And trust me, I wanted nothing more than to keep sinking. I would have more than happily drowned myself in it.

But immobility and malnutrition have left me frail. And despite my brain screaming to do the exact opposite, my arm fell out of the color, landing pathetically back onto the dirty sheets.

The abrupt withdrawal from that perfect sensation shattered my mind. Plummeting from the sublime back down into the chaotic disorder of this godforsaken reality made my entire body writhe in agony. My hand is currently suffering an invisible burn that refuses to go out. If it was an actual flame, it would have melted my extremity a hundred times over by this point.

No matter how hard I try, no matter how much I focus, I can’t seem to reach back into it. Heaven is a mere few inches away, cruelly tantalizing me, and yet I just can’t get to it. The color ripples, calling out to me, but I can't follow.

I’m too goddamned weak. I can’t sit up. I can’t lift my arm high enough. I can barely breathe.

With the last of my energy, bloody fingers slipping across the surface of my phone as I type, I’ve made this post.

Is anyone willing to come over and lift me into the color?

The front door should be unlocked. 

I'm in the bedroom. 

Don't be frightened by what you see. 

You just can't understand. 

But maybe I can show you.
