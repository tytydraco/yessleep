It started so small–life changing events always do. Just one event, one action, one choice, and nothing was ever the same.

It actually started as a joke between my mom and I. We were driving home one day when I was just big enough to sit in the front seat when we saw a tipped over bucket of apples in someone’s yard. Mom laughed and said that it looked like someone had been abducted by aliens while they were picking apples. 

From then on it became an ongoing, inside joke between the two of us. Whenever we would spot someone carrying buckets of apples or picking apples off a tree we would say, “Don’t do it! It’s a trap!” as we drove by. It was silly, innocent, and harmless.

Until it wasn’t.

I couldn’t have been older than thirteen when it happened. My cousin was visiting for the weekend–I’ll call him Colby. He was a sweet, gangly kid a couple months younger than me, with dark curly hair, round glasses, and hobbies that were just strange enough to earn him the title of “weird kid” in school. He collected marbles and feathers and could tell you the entire lore of the Final Fantasy franchise if you asked him. He probably would have been diagnosed with autism if he had gotten the chance.

We were playing in the front yard, some combination of tag and hide-and-seek. I was outside all the time then. Back when being outside was still fun and I wasn’t anxious all the time. Back before I was afraid of my own shadow and the sight of pine trees didn’t make me queasy. Colby suddenly stopped running and pointed, “You’re selling apples?”

I followed his pointing finger with my eyes until I saw what he was talking about. Tucked slightly away from the road and braced up against one of the big pine trees that lined our driveway, was a little wooden booth. It was rickety-looking and leaning slightly to one side like it had been made by kids. Buckets of apples were placed on either side of it with a couple more balanced on nearby chairs, and a handpainted sign on the front of the booth said “Apples 4 Sale” in blotchy, dripping black paint. 

“No…?” I remember saying with a frown. We had apple trees in our yard–ugly, scabby things that were probably older than the house, and produced a handful of tiny, bruised, sour apples every other year. Nothing we could ever sell. All the neighbors had apple trees of their own anyway, why would they want to buy ours?  

Colby laughed and I don’t blame him. The booth was *right there*, so apparently we *were* selling apples. That was the only explanation, right? But as I watched Colby walking toward the booth, Mom’s ridiculous words came back to me and stopped me from following.

Don’t do it! It’s a trap!

I don’t remember if I called for Colby to stop. I want to think that I did–that I actually tried to save him, even though I didn’t know what I was saving him from. I want it to be his fault that he walked up to the booth and picked an apple out of one of the buckets. He ignored my warning, so it’s his fault, nothing more I could have done. But I don’t remember if I called out to him or if I just watched him go. Watched him walk up to the lopsided booth and pull a fat, red apple–too big to be one of ours–out of the bucket and bite into it, juice dribbling down his chin–too sweet to be one of ours. 

He turned away from the booth to face me, grinning like he had just gotten away with something illegal. That’s how I choose to remember him, the snapshot of his face that I keep tucked away in my mind. Not the stiff, uncomfortable school photo that they used for his funeral, but how he looked right there in that moment. Smudged glasses sitting crooked on his sweat and dirt smeared face, smiling so wide his face could barely contain it. He had his back to the booth so he didn’t see it coming. I might not remember whether or not I called out to him, but I remember what happened next.

It feels like it happened in slow motion, but it couldn’t have taken more than a couple of seconds. As soon as Colby turned away from the booth something moved behind the pine tree and a hand curled around the trunk. Not a human hand. Thinking back I can’t remember what it really looked like–just a dark, spindly shape against the mossy tree bark–like one of those scrambled up AI generated images where there’s just enough information for your brain to take a guess at what it’s seeing even though you’re looking at nonsense. My brain categorized it as a hand, maybe to spare itself from cracking under the strain of what it was really seeing.

It was big. Big enough to wrap its misshapen “fingers” all the way around Colby’s torso and yank him away faster than I could blink. Like a trapdoor spider silently dragging a cricket into its burrow, Colby disappeared behind the tree before he had a chance to scream. Not so much as a rustle of leaves.

He was still holding the apple.

I stood there frozen for a minute. It didn’t feel real. It felt like I had just watched a scary scene in a movie, watched everything happen through the eyes of a stranger while the real me was miles away. It wasn’t until a blue jay screamed from some hidden place in the trees that I finally jerked back to life. My eyes were burning like I hadn’t blinked in days and my dad was in front of me, shaking me by the shoulders and asking what was wrong. He said he came running when he heard me screaming. I don’t remember screaming, but my throat was raw like I had been. 

I told him something behind the tree had taken Colby. I told him something was hiding behind the tree. I told him not to go near the apples. 

“What apples?”

I looked past him then, around his body at the spot where Colby had been standing a few seconds ago. The apple booth was gone. There wasn’t even a dent in the grass where it had been. 

Dad called the police after that. There wasn’t a trace of Colby anywhere, hair, no scrap of clothes, no blood. The only sign that he had been at our house at all was his jacket hanging on a peg in our kitchen. Threadbare denim and a size too small, he never wore it when his mom wasn’t around to make him. 

An officer questioned me. He was a young, fresh-faced man, better suited to be a kindergarten teacher than a police officer. I told him the truth, something was hiding behind the tree and snatched Colby away.

“Why did Colby go with him?” the officer asked.

“He didn’t,” I said, “the thing grabbed him and pulled him away.”

The officer scribbled in his notepad, “You said he didn’t scream, though?”

“No, it happened too fast.”

More scribbling. “Did you see where he took Colby?”

“Behind the tree.”

“He didn’t get into a car?”

“No! Colby went to the apple booth, grabbed an apple, and something pulled him behind the tree!”
“He told you he had apples?”

I’ve never wanted to hit someone more than I did right then. 

I got sent to psychiatrists next. Well-meaning people who wanted to talk about my feelings, explain what trauma was, and convince me that what I “thought I saw” was just my mind protecting me from what had actually happened. There was no apple booth. There was no brain-bending monster hiding behind the tree. There was just a sicko who kidnapped Colby and dragged him into a car or a shed or the house, and I needed to remember what really happened so they could save him. 

*I* was holding up their investigation. *I* was the key to solving everything. *I* was the reason they couldn’t find Colby. It didn’t matter that the sniffer dogs followed Colby’s scent to the tree and stopped in their tracks–that they growled and raised their hackles and ran circles around the tree until they dropped from exhaustion. It was my fault. 

Eventually I started to believe them. When enough grown ups tell a scared kid that what they saw was just their imagination it’s easier to agree. They were trained professionals, they got paid to be right about this kind of thing.

My dad got arrested even though they never found Colby, dead or alive, and I let myself believe that that’s what happened. Mom got a divorce, took back her maiden name, we moved to a different state where no one knew us, and did our best to start over. Colby became a bitter memory that I shoved into the basement of my mind, only surfacing in nightmares for years until even those started to fade. 

I might have managed to forget about it entirely if it wasn’t for what I just saw, and my reason for writing all of this down. 

I’m an adult now, living on my own in a little house on the edge of town, nothing but my pets to keep me company out here. 

When I looked out my window into my front yard this morning I saw, tucked slightly away from the road, braced up against one of the trees that line my driveway, a little booth. It’s rickety-looking and leaning slightly to one side like it was made by kids and there’s buckets of fat, red apples on either side plus a couple more balanced on nearby chairs. On the front of the booth is a sign, hand-painted in botchy and dripping black paint “Apples 4 Sale”.  

There's something behind the tree, I can't see it, but I know it's there. Looking at the tree makes my eyes burn like I haven't blinked in days. There's something impossible to comprehend, something Other, something that doesn't belong. Or maybe we're the ones who don't belong 

No one has walked by yet, but if you do, if you happen to see the booth. 

I'm begging you–don't take the apples.
