I met him many moons ago, and while at first I wasn't sure of him - I ended up falling in love.
His smile, the way he spoke when he talked about things that excited him, and his beautiful, dark, curly hair. 

He had ringlets you could run your fingers through, and they would still bounce back. As someone with thick, straight hair at the time, I enjoyed that. 

We both quickly fell in love. We both enjoyed sushi, and walking around town, on the nights out when the moon was at it's brightest. While I was an early bird, I would frequently just nap after coming home and he found it adorable. 
And while now, years later, things are still happy to me. He easily forgave me sleeping in another's bed, as long as I returned to his as night. And I did... night after night after night. 

Our true trouble began years later, when he finally noticed the difference. See, they came crawling to me. 

We'd be out on the town, and see a stray feline, who would eagerly run over to be pet. "we already have Tuli!" He would remind me. 

Tulip was the kitten he had found astray while I was off...at work, a few years ago. She was an adorable thing, and she loved her father. They cuddled every night together. The man did have a wonderful way with cats. 

He got jealous of how much Tuli bonded to me as soon as I returned from my trip. He'd yell at her, saying she was his first, and that I must be spoiling her somehow. 

Each time, I would demurely respond "read up on cat language, my love, she loves you the most still." 
I would remark on how when he leaves how she would miss him, and I was just a place holder for him. 

And then, we got the new one.We took in another feline, a *male* this time, from my brother in law who did not want to deal with him. 
Apparently, he loves to pee, to mark his territory, and wasn't cuddly. 
He was a gorgeous creation, and I was quite proud. It hurt me that one would just abandon him just because he peed, without further figuring out why he was upset enough to do it. But, given how the owner kicked and punched his dog, I was happy to take the cat in. 

At our home, it was like unboxing a new cat. He was the most friendly, the most understanding, and quickly had Tuli jealous.

It was good timing, as well, because unfortunately, my brother in law passed a week later. He was driving from work, when he drove straight into a building. There was no neurological brain damage - the doctors and police assumed suicide, leaving behind his wife and kids. 

It was hard at the funeral, and everyone truly looked sad, so I did as well. I wore the accustomed black, the accustomed tears and sad face, and spent several hours there. 

Afterwards, we were supposed to attend a remembrance party, where I reminded Ra - my nickname for Raymond, that the cats would need new food. I would be back in 30 minutes and he could spend that time grieving with them. 

As I was leaving, I heard my newly widowed sister, saying how she hates cats now, and will kill the last one as a tribute to her dead husband. My eyes shone brightly, though no one saw. 

That was not something I could allow again.
