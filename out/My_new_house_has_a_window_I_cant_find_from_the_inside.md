I should clarify: I bought my new house about three months ago. Nothing too fancy, just what I can afford. To be honest, I consider myself lucky that I was able to get it. I’ve always had a thing for old houses so when it came on the market I jumped at the chance.

I didn’t really notice the window at first. I think I was just keen to get the sale through and get settled. From the street it all looks perfectly normal, with the weird window on the second floor, above the porch. I say weird; there’s really nothing particularly unusual about it in terms of the outside. But inside the house, no matter how often I walk around the upstairs rooms, it just isn’t there.  

At first I assumed it was some trick of the architecture. Old English houses can be pretty eccentric, with all sorts of awkward angles funny doors that open into places you don’t expect. In my house hunt I certainly viewed a fair few odd ones. I suppose I told myself it was a charming quirk.

Still, I started making a few notes in the first week. More for planning’s sake than anything. The upstairs has three bedrooms, one main hallway, and a smaller cross-hall that connects them. I cross checked my scribbles to the floor-plan from the estate agents. I even measured it all, checking everything lines up where it should. And it does. Except when I try to account for that window. 

The measurements, if you can call my pacing around measuring, imply there should be a space roughly the size of a cloakroom that just isn’t there. 

I thought maybe there was some closed-off loft space. But between the rooms, between the walls, there’s nowhere for it to go. I still can’t get my head around it, but with all the stress of moving I sort of pushed it out of my mind. At least until the noises started. 

I first noticed the noises in about my third week in the house. After a late night painting the living room walls I heard this tapping from upstairs. I was a little spooked, I’ll admit, but I figured it was just house-settling noises, and chalked my nerves up to poor sleep. I kept telling myself the same thing every night as the noises carried on. It was this tapping, and these drawn out creaks like wood expanding and contracting, every single night starting at one in the morning like clockwork. It always seemed to come from the same place: the right-hand wall of the upstairs hall, just where the missing space should be. 

I did my best to ignore it, but as the days passed, the noises seemed to get louder, more insistent. They started to wake me up at night, and I could swear they’d gotten less like creaks and taps and more like deliberate knocks. I even started to pick out the sound of glass being knocked rather than wall. I started losing sleep so badly I was debating taking time off work.  

After nearly two weeks of it, it wasn’t just the knocking. The whole house started to feel unbalanced, like something just out of sight was really wrong. 

My interest in the window came back. In the tiny bits of sleep I could get I swear I was dreaming about it. 

I called in sick from work one Monday and decided to map every wall again. I counted steps, windows, doors. When my step counts didn’t add up on Tuesday I tore up the carpets and counted the floorboards. At 2am on Thursday, still in my pyjamas, I decided to answer the knocking with my own. 

Basically, I swung a claw hammer into the wall. These layers of paper, paint and plaster crumbled away as I kept hitting the wall, the history of the house that I loved just collecting at my feet. Eventually it all gave way and the knocking stopped dead.

There was nothing. No hidden window, no secret door. Just brick, littered with tiny chip marks from the hammer. Still a bit frantic, I pressed my ear to the wall. Silence.

After that, I just ran outside into the rain and squinted at that damned upstairs window under the streetlight. To anyone looking out it must have seemed like I’d gone mad. I suppose I had really. I think I almost came to my senses until I heard it again.

Knocking. The sound of someone knocking on glass.

I haven’t slept more than an hour in days now. When I close my eyes, I see the missing room, the space the house refuses to give up. In my mind it’s there, perfectly aligned, exactly where the measurements say it should be. I dream of standing inside it, but the dream always ends before I can turn around to see how I got in. 

The knocking is still there. I’ve tried to ignore it, to bury my head in pillows, drown it in white noise and podcasts, even leave the house entirely. It just follows me. One in the morning, without fail. Sometimes faint, like a distant memory tapping on the edge of a dream. Sometimes it’s so loud I don’t know how the neighbours don’t hear it too. Nobody does.

No one ever looks at that window either. I’ve watched them: delivery drivers, dog walkers, even friends I’ve tried to lure into noticing. Their eyes slip right past it, like it isn’t even there. Like I’m the only one who sees it.  

The last few days, the knocking’s been getting louder again. But it’s not steady any more, it’s impatient. Like frantic fists against glass.  

And the window. From outside, it’s different again. I know it’s different. For weeks, I thought its curtains were drawn, but yesterday I realised the glass itself is darker. When I tried to stare longer, my eyes start watering so badly I have to look away. Or maybe I’m just crying.  

The house isn’t balanced anymore. The walls don’t feel straight, the floorboards give beneath my feet in places I know should be solid. Sometimes I find myself counting steps and stopping short, because somehow I’ve taken more than I should have.

I can feel it constantly. At the edges of my vision, the house breathes. The rooms are wrong. The hallways spiral in patterns that shouldn’t be possible. I swear I opened six different doors today before I managed to get out. 

I know I shouldn’t go back. But I think maybe I have to. I think I’m meant to.  

It’s hard to explain, but that window is watching me. Even when I keep the curtains drawn downstairs, even when I sit with every light blazing, I can feel it, somehow angled towards me. Like the whole house has turned itself around so that room-that-doesn’t-exist is at its centre, and I’m the one in it, just knocking to get out.
