Hey, r/NoSleep. I'm posting here because I need advice and maybe just someone to help me bounce ideas. My sister Marley has been missing for a week now, and the park officials have called me to identify some of her belongings (a sweater, journal, her pack and her boots) that washed up in a green canoe. What I found and read in her journal haunts me, and I don't know what to do next. I’m considering going to Echo Island to find her, but I need your advice. Here’s what she wrote:

***July 1st***

*Jess, Bean, Lux, Perry, and I are camping for a week out here in Mont Tremblant National Park. We arrived this morning and managed to get set up right next to the beach sites. Lux and Perry decided to scout the trails while Jess, Bean, and I stayed back to relax on the beach. It’s been unusually warm for spring, so we will likely go to the beach all day tomorrow before the storms move in. We saw this beautiful island across from our site where the forest was dense, and we could hear people talking and laughing late into the night. Bean proposed that we canoe out and camp there for a night. Although I think it would be amazing, Lux seemed unsure, so we will see how it goes. I can hear people there right now, laughing, and I see the campfire smoke rising through the forest, but our park map doesn’t seem to have it marked down as part of the National Park.*

***July 2nd***

*It’s about the afternoon, and we just returned to base camp after eating lunch to pack up and attempt to ferry across the island during low tide. We’ve dubbed it Echo Island because of how close the island is to the mainland; the echoes are loud enough to almost hear people's conversations there. Bean said he found a path low enough for us to walk across with our stuff in the afternoon. Lux is really against us going; she thinks it’s private property and that we will get arrested. I’m sure it will be fine because I saw a girl canoeing from the island towards the camp docks. I’ll write some more later. I can hear Lux arguing with Perry right now in their tent. I’m going to try and reassure her.*

*-*

*So we made it to Echo Island just in the nick of time. The rain clouds started moving in, and the water suddenly returned with cold winds and clouds. Luckily, the forest on the island was so thick that we could barely feel the rain, so we decided to set up a little further inland from the beach. We ended up in a patch of cleared forest that had been used as a camp before. We can hear people, but we have yet to encounter anyone, so we decided that we can deal with a property owner if they stumble on us and play it dumb.*

***July 3rd***

*I think someone walked by our camp last night. Even in the deep sleepiness of campfire drinking, I could hear someone walking around, and I knew it wasn’t any of us because we were all sharing Jess’s giant tent. I walked out this morning, and it was still quite dark because of the weather and the thickness of the canopy of forests, but I could see human footprints as if someone was walking around without shoes around our campsite floor. Bean thinks it’s probably just another camper who went for a swim or dip drunkenly coming through our campsite mistakenly. He heard many people laughing and chatting after I had fallen asleep early. I guess that makes sense, but what is weird is there were human handprints everywhere as well.*

*Lux seems anxious, so I am playing it cool. I know she isn’t an outside person, but I am hoping she will see she has nothing to fear. This island has been nothing short of magical so far!*

*-*

*We decided to explore some trails while Lux and Perry stayed behind. We walked for an hour or so before we came upon a couple of what looked like abandoned old campsites. It’s weird because it kind of felt like people were still using these sites, but the tents and chairs seemed old and tattered. Bean and Jess wanted to explore further, but I was getting cold the deeper we went into the forest, and I left my red sweater behind at the campsite. We turned back and headed towards camp, where we found Lux worried that Perry hadn’t returned with us. She had mentioned how he insisted on exploring and told her he would catch up to us just a few minutes after we left on our hike. I tried to explain to Lux that there were several paths, and we never crossed him, and maybe he just went by one of the other trails by accident and that he would come back sooner than later, but she was inconsolable. To be honest, I am a bit worried because it is starting to get dark fast.*

*-*

*It’s later now, and Perry is not back. You could cut the stress in the air with a knife. We were supposed to leave with low tide but decided to stay on the island and camp another day since Perry hadn’t returned. Bean offered to head out and look for him, but after Perry got lost, we decided it might be best to stick in groups, and Jess joined him. They left 35 min ago, but we haven’t heard from them, and for some reason, none of us are getting cell reception. Lux is a mess. She is convinced something happened to Perry and wants to go off and check the other trails. We are doing everything we can to keep her here in case she gets lost. She is refusing to eat and she barely sleeps, I am really worried for her. But neither of us have been sleeping really since last night.*



*It was midnight, and Lux finally fell asleep beside me on her camping chair by the fire—no sign of either Bean, Perry, or Jess. Lux and I had been waiting and watching the woods with no avail before we fell asleep. But I just saw Perry in the distance. It is pitch black, but I could swear I saw his dreads and jacket walk by in the darker parts of the woods. I called out to him and tried to follow him, but for some reason, he kept walking as if he couldn’t hear me. I heard people laughing and could hear them talking, but I couldn’t make out the conversation. I turned back to the campfire, and Lux was wide awake, straight as a needle, wide-eyed. She whispered, “you saw him too.” I am terrified because although I did see him, it didn’t feel like Perry, but Lux tells me she swears she heard him talking and laughing last night and that it MUST be him.*

***July 4th***

*It’s 2 am. The fire is out, and I must have fallen asleep on my chair next to the fire. I opened my eyes, and I saw Bean and Jess crouching behind the tent and silently mouthing and signalling to each other. Although I was waking up from a painful and patchy sleep, my body immediately had goosebumps, as if something was wrong. I see Jess pointing towards the forest when I move my gaze slowly, quietly, and as still as I can, and there, I see someone standing and watching us. As my eyes adjust to the darkness, I can see that the person standing isn’t blinking, and their smile is too big stretched from ear to ear. Something is wrong with their face, or they're wearing a mask. My heart is beating so loud I'm convinced they could hear me even at that distance.  As I looked closer, I recognized the person was wearing Perry’s jacket and beanie, but something told me this person wasn’t Perry. After what felt like forever, whoever it was turned around crouched down on all fours and ran into the forest. We rushed back into our tent as if we were safer here behind the thin piece of fabric. Lux is wide awake, eyes wide, staring off. She saw us come in and said, “He’s here. He came back for me.” Bean and Jess have already started packing up their stuff. They whispered that someone in the forest was pretending to be Perry and that we needed to get off the island as soon as possible. They said they felt like they were being watched the whole time they were searching for Perry. Only to see someone dressed as him running behind them and then disappear.*

*-*

*It’s 5 a.m. I don’t think it’s safe on this island. There has been no sign of Perry. But we must have all fallen asleep, and Lux disappeared. She didn’t take any gear and seems to have left her shoes. Bean and Jess are fighting at this point. Jess wants to stay, but Bean wants to leave. I don’t think I can leave without Lux; it’s my fault Perry and Lux are on this trip. This island suddenly feels very magical for not-so-great reasons.*

*We walked deep into the forest, which was cold and damp, and the overgrown shrubs and bushes kept scratching up my legs. About an hour into our search, we found what looked like a makeshift shelter and camp where we found Perry’s jacket and Lux's phone. The firepit was warm, and this gave us an idea that they were, in fact, alive. It was getting darker, and the forest was only denser from now on. They could have gone in any direction. I’m trying to calm my breathing so I can listen well, and that’s when the echoes start up again. I could hear people, but I’m sure I could hear Perry, Lux, and other voices.*

*I stood there yelling for my friends repeatedly. I was exhausted, and I had no clue what was going on. All I could think of was, what am I going to do? I’m unsure what happened, but we started walking and then jogged towards the voices in a desperate attempt to find our friends. It all happened so quickly, but Bean was convinced he saw Lux, and he took off in a direction where the forest swallowed him. We called and called, and we heard nothing but these echoes, and for a moment, it felt as if the echoes were coming from all around and above them. Jess and I tried to find our way to the camp. We only found a clearing with a little treehouse type of shelter. We scouted around and decided to crash here for the night. Jess stepped outside to extinguish the fire before taking the first watch.*



*I must have dozed off, but I was still extremely sleepy and began nodding off again when I heard footsteps approaching the camp. Thinking it must be Jess coming to switch watch, I sat up straight and peeped below at the ladder, but I didn’t see Jess. Instead, I saw Lux barefoot walking around on all fours below. I peeked out at a distance, and there it was again. The not-Perry stood at the dark forest's edge, staring at the fire and Lux below me. The moon was bright and I noticed its smile right away. Did it see me? A few minutes later, another one approached from the other side, the not-Jess. My heart sank; they got her, too.*

*At first, I thought it was people dressed in their clothes, but as they got closer, I realized they looked oddly similar to my friends, but some things were very off. Their smiles covered their whole face from ear to ear, and it was as if the dark holes of their eyes were far too wide and unblinking. They walked on two legs but then would default to running on all fours like a dog. But the worst part was their hands; it was as if someone drew their hands with extremely long fingers, and they were all crooked and wrong. I hear them running around the forest, echoing my friend's voices. I can't tell if my friends were lost or consumed by whatever these things were.*

***July 5th***

*They couldn’t track me last night hidden up in the tree, they also seem to come out at night since we never saw them during the day. I saw them walking around all fours around the campground below me, but it’s as if they can’t see well. By the time morning came, I was exhausted. I could hear them mimicking our conversation and voices all through the night. I was on my third night of no sleep, and I felt drowsy, but I kept my eyes open until daybreak, terrified they would find me. I climbed out of the shelter, and below me was Bean! Bean was back and looked even worse than I did, but he was so happy to see me. He chased what he thought was Lux until a large clearing in the forest, only to realize it wasn’t her. Bean had climbed a tree, hid at night, and returned to our campsite by following the creatures, where he got a good look at them. Bean seemed relieved that I wasn't lost, and he declared that even if it meant swimming, he would get me off the island. We hugged deeply. I hadn’t told him how I felt but knew our feelings were mutual. I will do my best to leave when we find that canoe we saw earlier. Although day is breaking, I can feel them watching us. I can feel their eyes and smiles all around me.*

*-*

*It was exactly where I saw it last, my saving grace: a green, beaten-down canoe. I am writing from the canoe while Bean oars us toward the campground. We have been rowing for a while, though, and I'm getting a bit anxious, but I think it is because I can't believe we made it. There is a thick fog covering the lake, but I can hear the sounds of people talking. Hopefully, we can find someone to call the police and SAR to help us find our friends. I am just happy we escaped, but you know who seems happy, Bean! In fact, I just realized that Bean hasn't stopped smiling and that his smile seems to be getting bigger.*

Post Cont'd:

That was the last journal entry that I found in her bag. I'm convinced that she and her friends experienced a sort of folie à deux, or hallucinations from starving and lack of sleep. Or maybe there was someone there playing tricks on them. Either way, I need to get to that island and investigate. When I asked the National Park, they insisted that I avoid that island since it is private property and that the police were working on getting a warrant since there were no witnesses or proof that they had gone to the island until they found her journal.

Have any of you ever experienced something like this? What should I know before I åget to the island of Echos?
