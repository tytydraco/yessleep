Imagine if the devil did not take but give give give give. he wanted every day to be your Christmas. Well, that's what the hell is like. you heard me hell, not heaven. those that are evil get what they want and everything they want. the devil sees to it. murdered someone here your reward do other things well if it's bad enough hell have you(get it). So what happens to the good people do they suffer? no not really more on that in a bit.  
  
Anyway, where was I right, hell. Yeah, so how it works is that your prayers are always answered there is no death, hunger or disease to speak of. if you want anything else just whip up a prayer and you have it. you might be thinking anything oh yes why hell has been going crazy over housing? Don't get me wrong making the houses isn't the issue; it's the constant one up making it a continuous cycle of I want better no I do. if you ask me they should just stop and smell the roses.  
  
you might think I'm punking you why would people like rapists and mutilators get whatever they want how is that justice. well, life isn't fair kiddo. That is just how it works. now don't get me wrong there are wars. seriously people have tried countless times trillions of times to start a war. they kinda can. they can pray for victims to mass kill, torture you name it. Remember when you want just dial a prayer.  
  
surely there's a catch, right? mental degradation, the frailty of an old body. nope, people when dead are reborn in perfect health. heck even if you were ugly on earth you can be the next supermodel there if you wish to be.  
  
oh, Hitler alone the stories I can give. Heh, he has a thing for blonds and surprisingly bondage. who else oh that Vlad it took him Millennium to realize he wanted to impale men with his pike if you know what I mean. oh don't get me started on Gayce it's practically a scene straight out of it. Oh my god, and there are people you wouldn't expect there like Steve Jobs, Krisi from Threes Company heck even Dale from The King of the Hill. not the characters the actors silly.  
  
so what do you think would like to go it's not hard. Grab a knife, hit, and run join blm the options are endless. every second is an opportunity to be part of its non-exclusive but worthwhile club. Oh and don't worry anyone you want in your life be it a dead relative or celebrity will be created exactly as either you remember them or more importantly want them to be like.  
  
now it's pretty friendly believe it or not that last detail makes it so everyone wants to play nice; even if they hate you they have a replica of you to torture. now people have tried to fight each other but don't worry no one wants pain so in the end it's more play fighting. really there are no strings attached.  
  
no due date when everything ends up bad no time of reckoning it's a party 24/7 yearly. I have no idea where all this hellfire, torture, and burning came from. It's almost like people want you to follow god, hahaha preposterous. now unfortunately they lost a good man or two to born again and repented sinners meh it happens. now I can see you salivating anything I want why don't more people just kill and mame? I know right there's plenty of chances. those poor souls are lost because of the deceit of said priests men of the cloth.  
  
but now you're here don't worry about it. you've passed the test and entered the promised land of milk and honey. let's see what do we have you in for oh you're a rapist. Any way you're here have some fun run someone over, hire a hooker or run over a hooker. heck, want to live in Buckingham Palace it's yours.  
  
Now we have just one rule you can't die. not now not ever not in a thousand years, a billion years or tens of trillions of years. you're here to have whatever you want for eternity. sure things might get dull but just try new things after all aren't we full of imagination? Whenever ever has a vacation has been boring because you stayed a bit too long? you and everyone here are to never struggle and only get rewarded. now enjoy hell. Oh and what do good people get ah they just hang out and hover in heaven.
