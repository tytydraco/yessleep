“Hey Cecilia, Dmitri, how close are you to the patient?” I inquired, looking at both of them.

Cecilia responded without hesitation. “I’ve talked to him plenty of times. We had wonderful conversations about his life and his dreams. He used to dream about being a professional swimmer… before he swam in another world, that is.”

“Great,” I said, nodding. “Can you talk to him now? I need to review his file to see if there’s something else that can help me.”

Cecilia gave a reassuring smile. “Of course. He trusts me, so maybe I can help him feel more at ease.”

As Cecilia approached the bed, Dmitri stood by the door, his watchful eyes scanning the room. “We’ll keep you safe,” he said in his thick Eastern European accent, his voice steady and calm.

I nodded, grateful for their presence. I then opened the thick binder Cecilia had handed me earlier. The file was filled with detailed notes, medical records, and observations. I flipped through the pages, looking for anything that might provide a clue to his condition. The more I read, the more I realized how complex and baffling his case was.

That’s when I encountered a series of documents claiming that his case is highly correlated with sample 4622. There were a few entries that stood out to me:

>*Initial optical research indicates that the sample becomes perfectly transparent at near body temperature (36.50 degrees Celsius). However, according to on-site technicians Arya and Seo-jun, they reported hearing voices and warnings in their heads before fleeing the lab after reaching perfect transparency of the sample. The optics researcher was found dead, mummified by an unknown entity linked to sample 4622. The on-site technicians also mentioned seeing a monolith-like structure displayed in the sample. They are currently undergoing psychiatric evaluation.*

…

>*Another study was conducted using scanning tunneling microscopy on material highly correlated with the sample. Researchers on site found that the lattice structure appeared to change sporadically when viewed under the scanning tunneling microscope. However, each image outputted by the microscope was clear, with patterns that indicated intelligence rather than natural design. The study was interrupted by an entity resembling Dr. Aisha, who murdered and mummified Dr. Campbell. Further casualties were prevented by destroying the microscope examining the sample.*

…

>*Initial hypothesis indicates that crystals highly similar to sample 4622 are to be treated with caution. Anything that can either raise the temperature of the crystal to 36.50 degrees Celsius or apply a continuous small voltage to the crystal runs the risk of opening a connection between Earth and the sample 4622’s origin. The mechanism responsible for this observed phenomenon is currently unknown.*

The severity of this assignment struck me like a brick: if this patient is indeed linked to sample 4622, then if his crystallization phase is complete and he transforms into a crystal, this could open a permanent gateway between our world and that unknown world he swam in. What dangers lurk there that could suddenly show up in our world using patient 20134 as a door?

However, we still don’t know if his crystalline form upon full transformation will allow him to act as a doorway. The only way to find out is to carefully test this patient’s crystalline shell, somehow.

Suddenly, I recalled that Saed mentioned an incident with patient 20133 and that he might have been linked with this patient. I quickly skimmed through the binder, hoping to find anything that mentioned that incident, and there was a handwritten document that briefly described the incident. It was authored by the senior technician at the time.

>*The patient has undergone intensive neurological monitoring using the brain scanner with the secondary probe attachment under the expertise of Dr. Aisha. Note that the brain scanner has been updated based on classified technology. The signal was processed and refined in real time using advanced processing techniques, leading to a visual output of the patient’s thoughts. However, Dr. Aisha found that if the signal was filtered at the fourth and fifth orders, we could see that an unknown entity was somehow affecting the patient, and a visual representation of that message could be displayed. That message can be seen in the next two pages.*

…

>*Figures 1 and 2 show noiseless signals with what looks like monoliths at random frequencies. Even with the advanced brain scanner, noise is typically expected. However, we can only speculate that the tower the patient kept mentioning that was calling for him is somehow linked to these signals. Unfortunately, the rest of the signal was destroyed after an entity entered the patient’s room and presumably mummified both Dr. Aisha and patient 20133.*

That’s when I dropped the folder. Everything seemed to indicate that patient 20134’s crystalline form was made of the same alien material as sample 4622. If this was the case, then we were in serious trouble. He could act as a portal at any moment, and he kept mentioning a tower—just like patient 20133.

The implications were staggering. If patient 20134's transformation was indeed linked to sample 4622, then the potential for a permanent gateway between our world and the unknown world he had visited was terrifying. What kind of entities or phenomena could cross over? The thought of it sent chills down my spine.

I needed to act quickly. The documents suggested that raising the temperature of the crystal or applying a small voltage could trigger a connection. I had to find a way to test the crystalline shell without inadvertently opening a portal. 

I glanced at Cecilia and Dmitri, who were both watching me intently. "We need to proceed with extreme caution," I said, my voice steady despite the fear gnawing at me. "If this patient is linked to sample 4622, we could be dealing with something far beyond our understanding."

Cecilia nodded, her expression serious. "What do you need us to do?"

"First, we need to ensure that the patient remains stable," I replied. "We'll need to monitor his temperature and any electrical activity around him. We can't risk triggering a connection."

I paused for a moment, pondering what needed to be done. “I will call Saed and request technicians to bring equipment to cool the patient and monitor both his temperature and electrical activities. This will take a while. In the meantime, please keep the patient calm and occupied. Notify me of any changes right away.”

She nodded and continued to talk to the patient in a low, calming voice. I looked around and saw a secured landline phone outside the patient’s room. I approached it, scanned my keycard, and proceeded to call Saed.

“Hello, Saed?” I said.

“Yes, my friend! What can I do for you?” replied Saed.

“This is bad. I have no time to explain, but please bring technicians here to cool the patient and monitor his thermal and electromagnetic activities.”

“Of course. I will call them right away. Expect them in roughly—”

The call was cut off abruptly, and I could see the hallway lights flicker. A sense of unease washed over me as I glanced back at the patient’s room. 

I quickly returned to the room, my mind racing with possibilities. "Cecilia, Dmitri, something's wrong. The call got cut off, and the lights are flickering. We need to be on high alert. Can either of you call for—"

Suddenly, the patient spoke in a loud voice, interrupting me. "The tower... it's coming closer..."

I turned to look at him, and that’s when I saw it. His organs, already visible through his crystalline skin, began to change. The once faint outlines of his internal structures started to fade, becoming more transparent with each passing second. It was as if his body was dissolving into pure crystal.

His lungs, which had been expanding and contracting rhythmically, now appeared as ghostly shapes, their movements barely discernible. The transparency was so perfect that I could just make out the faint outlines of his trachea and lungs. Each breath he took seemed to struggle through the translucent structures, the once robust organs now appearing fragile and ethereal. The sight was unsettling; his lungs, barely visible, moved with a hauntingly slow rhythm, as if they were on the verge of disappearing entirely.

His heart, which had been beating steadily, now looked like a shimmering, translucent sculpture. The chambers and valves were visible, but they seemed to be made of glass, the blood flowing through them like a faint, red mist. The arteries and veins, once prominent, were now almost invisible, their paths only hinted at by the faintest of outlines. Suddenly, his heartbeat, which had been steady, began to increase rapidly, looking as if it had doubled in speed. The rapid pulsations made the translucent heart appear even more fragile, the blood coursing through it with an urgent, almost frantic rhythm.

The rest of his organs followed suit. His liver, kidneys, and intestines all became increasingly transparent, their functions continuing but now barely visible. The transformation was both mesmerizing and horrifying, a grotesque display of his body’s internal workings laid bare in a way that defied natural law.

Cecilia gasped, her eyes wide with shock. "What’s happening to him?" she whispered, her voice trembling.

"I don’t know," I replied, my own voice barely steady.

Dmitri, ever vigilant, kept his eyes on the patient, his hand resting on his weapon.

I continued observing the patient, hoping that it might give us a clue about what was happening. His face appeared flushed, and a thin sheen of sweat began to form. His breathing became more labored, and I could see the slight tremors in his face as his body struggled to cope with the changes.

“His body temperature is increasing. That’s why he’s becoming more crystallized.” I said, quietly.

Suddenly, I saw an electric spark connect between the room lights and the patient. Then I heard someone behind me shooting at something. I covered my ears and turned around. I saw something otherworldly standing at the door of the room. It was a grey, formless entity, vaguely resembling a humanoid shape. It looked more like a ghost, with a head that had no face, just a smooth, featureless surface.
The entity seemed to shimmer and shift, its form constantly in flux. It moved with an eerie, fluid grace, as if it were made of smoke or mist. Despite its lack of distinct features, there was an undeniable sense of malevolence emanating from it.

I could see Dmitri continuing to shoot at the entity with his pistol, but the bullets passed through it harmlessly, as if it were made of air. The entity slowly entered the room, its presence causing the temperature to drop noticeably. It moved towards Dmitri, who stood his ground, his face set in grim determination.

As the entity encompassed Dmitri, he seemed to lose all color from his body. His skin turned a ghastly shade of grey, and his eyes widened in terror. He let out a scream that I had never heard before, a sound filled with pure, unadulterated fear and agony.

Dmitri's body convulsed as the entity enveloped him, and he dropped his pistol. His movements became sluggish, and he seemed to be fighting an invisible force. The color drained from his face, and his eyes rolled back in his head.

I heard Cecilia screaming, frozen in place by fear while still pointing her gun at the entity. Her hands trembled, and her eyes were locked onto the horrifying scene unfolding before her. She was unable to move, paralyzed by the terror that gripped her.

I was left with no choice. I picked up Dmitri's pistol, my hands shaking. I walked up to patient 20134 and spoke to him softly. “I am so sorry.”

He nodded, his eyes filled with understanding and resignation. And I shot him in the head.

The crystallization of the patient’s body stopped immediately and seemed to become opaque, turning a perfectly black color. The process had halted, and the threat of the portal opening was averted.
I turned around and saw that Dmitri had dropped to the ground. He was still breathing, but he seemed paralyzed, his body rigid and unresponsive. Cecilia was still frozen in place, her eyes wide with shock.

I dropped the gun, still comprehending what I had done. What sin I had committed. The weight of my actions pressed down on me, and I knew that the consequences of this day would haunt me forever.

Moments later, the sound of rushing footsteps filled the air, and paramedics rushed into the room. They quickly assessed Dmitri's condition and carefully lifted him onto a stretcher. As they carried him away, I could only hope that they would be able to help him.

After answering the many questions from the security staff and the supervisors, I slowly walked to my quarters, each step feeling heavier than the last. The events of the day replayed in my mind, a relentless loop of horror and regret. I needed to fill out the assessment for patient 20134, but the thought of reliving those moments in writing was almost too much to bear.

As I sat down at my desk, the sterile light of the computer screen illuminated the room, casting long shadows that seemed to mock my despair. I began typing, my fingers trembling with each keystroke. The technical language of the report felt cold and detached, a stark contrast to the turmoil raging inside me.

I couldn’t help but let out a quiet sob, the sound echoing in the empty room. The weight of my actions pressed down on me, and I felt a deep, gnawing guilt that threatened to consume me. Desperate for some semblance of comfort, I reached for my favorite bottle of whiskey. The amber liquid glinted in the light as I poured myself a generous glass.

Taking a long, slow sip, I felt the warmth spread through my chest, dulling the edges of my pain. With a heavy heart, I finished typing the first section of the report, the words blurring together as tears filled my eyes. 

>*Initial and Final Assessment of Patient 20134*

>*Status: Deceased*

>*Summary: The patient’s crystalline form appeared to function as a conduit between Earth and another world, potentially linked to sample 4662. Empirical observations indicated that an increase in body temperature (e.g., sweating, elevated heart rate) caused the crystalline structure to become more transparent, mirroring the optical properties documented in the study of sample 4662. Given the circumstances, it was imperative to terminate the patient’s life using Dmitri’s firearm to sever the connection between the two worlds. This intervention successfully closed the portal at the expense of a human life. Regrettably, no viable alternative was available under the conditions presented.*
