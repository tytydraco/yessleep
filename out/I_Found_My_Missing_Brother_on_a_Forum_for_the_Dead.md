I Found My Missing Brother on a Forum for the Dead

I never thought much about online forums until one of them brought my brother back.

Ryan had been missing for two years. One day, he went out to grab coffee and never came back. No suspicious activity on his bank account, no weird phone calls, no signs of struggle, just gone. The police said he'd likely been abducted, but without evidence, they couldn’t do much. My family fell apart. My mom stopped eating. My dad stopped talking. And I... I just stopped feeling.

Late one night, while spiraling through forums about unsolved disappearances, I stumbled upon a thread titled “Messages from Beyond: Connecting with the Lost”. It was buried deep within an obscure corner of the internet and full of people claiming to receive messages from the dead. It sounded ridiculous, but one comment caught my attention.

A user named “EchoingVoid” posted: “Sometimes the missing don’t know they’re gone. Sometimes they’re here, looking for home.” Below, someone replied, “How do you know?” and Void answered: “Because I am one.”

For whatever reason—grief, desperation, or lack of sleep—I created an account and messaged Void. I typed: “If you’re really one of the missing, prove it. Tell me something only you would know.”

The response came within minutes: “What do you want me to prove? That you once broke Ryan’s nose during a stupid fight over a game of Mario Kart? That he forgave you before you forgave yourself?”

My stomach dropped. I hadn’t told anyone about that—not even my parents. It was just one of those childhood moments you carry like a secret scar.

I asked: “Who are you?”

Void’s reply: “I think you know.”

The next few weeks were a blur. I spent hours every night talking to Void. “He” said the world he was in was a fractured reflection of ours—familiar but empty. The sky was always gray, the streets abandoned, the air heavy with silence. He couldn’t explain how he got there, only that he woke up in this place and couldn’t leave.

The more we talked, the more he sounded like Ryan. He even remembered details no one else could, like the nickname he used to call our childhood dog or how he’d secretly taped my embarrassing middle school dance recital to blackmail me later.

One night, Void said something that terrified me. He typed: “They’re watching me now. They don’t like that I’m talking to you.”

I asked who “they” were, but his responses became cryptic: “The shadows. The ones who keep us here. They don’t like noise.”

That was the last I heard from him for weeks.

Then, a new message appeared in my inbox: “Do you want to see me?” Attached was a link to a live video feed. I hesitated but clicked.

The stream showed a dimly lit street that looked eerily like the one Ryan and I grew up on. The houses were distorted, their shapes wavering as if viewed through heat haze. In the distance, a figure walked toward the camera. As they drew closer, I recognized his face. It was Ryan.

But something was off. His eyes were too wide, his movements stiff, like a puppet on strings. He smiled at the camera, but it wasn’t the smile I remembered—it was forced, unnatural.

He raised a hand and waved. In the live chat beside the video, he typed: “It’s me. I told you I was here.”

I couldn’t move. My heart felt like it was trying to escape my chest.

Suddenly, the camera shook violently. The shadows behind Ryan began to shift and ripple, forming towering figures with jagged edges. They moved closer, their distorted limbs reaching for him.

Ryan typed: “They’re coming. You have to help me. Find the door.”

The feed cut out.

I spent the next few days piecing together everything he’d said about his world, looking for clues about the “door.” It wasn’t much, but he’d mentioned a specific place from our childhood: an old, abandoned cabin in the woods where we used to play.

I drove there, half-expecting nothing. The cabin was just as we’d left it, rotting and overgrown. Inside, I found a trapdoor beneath a threadbare rug.

The ladder below led to a tunnel that stretched on for what felt like miles. At the end was a heavy iron door with strange carvings.

As I touched it, my phone buzzed. A message from Void: “They know you’re here. Don’t let them in.”

Before I could reply, the shadows began to seep through the walls, crawling toward me like living tar.

I shoved the door open and stepped through.

I don’t know how to explain what happened next. One moment, I was in the tunnel; the next, I was standing in the gray, empty world Ryan had described. The air was heavy, the silence deafening.

And there he was, standing a few feet away, staring at me with wide, desperate eyes.

“Ryan,” I whispered.

But before he could respond, the shadows surged forward.

The last thing I remember is his scream.

I woke up in my bed the next morning, clutching a piece of paper I’d never seen before. Written on it, in Ryan’s handwriting, were the words: “Don’t stop looking. There’s another door.”
