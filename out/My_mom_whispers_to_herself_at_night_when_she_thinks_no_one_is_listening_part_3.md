When I arrived back at my parents’ house, the sun was still high. It was afternoon, and I knew they wouldn’t be home for at least a couple of hours. I had time.

My grandma had wanted me to find something in the attic. She’d been cryptic, as always, but the weight of her words stayed with me: *“Maybe it will help you remember. Help you see what you need to see.’’*

I found the wooden ladder tucked neatly in the closet, just where it had always been. The hatch to the attic groaned as I pulled it down, the sound carrying through the empty house. As I climbed, each step felt heavier than the last. I tried to brace myself for what I might find.

The attic was unchanged. The same as I remembered from years ago—dusty, old, and shrouded in an eerie stillness that seemed to press against my chest. The wooden beams overhead cast long shadows in the dim light filtering through the lone window. The floorboards creaked beneath my weight, sounding fragile, as if they might give way at any moment. The air was thick with the scent of rot and dust, a stale, suffocating aroma that crawled into my throat and refused to leave.

*“Look for a yellow faded box,”* Grandma had said. I scanned the cluttered space and spotted a pile of boxes beneath a tattered blanket. The fabric was rough and grimy, like it had been abandoned to time. My hands brushed over the familiar texture as I peeled it back, and there it was—a large, faded yellow box. Scribbled on the side were the names *“Simon and Hollie.”*

My stomach sank.

With trembling hands, I lifted the lid. The stale scent of old cardboard hit me immediately, and for a moment, I hesitated, half-expecting something… terrible to leap out at me. But all that greeted me were toys, faded drawings, and an old photo album. My chest loosened in relief, but the unease lingered.

I sifted through the contents, each item dragging me back through memories and feelings I thought I had buried long ago.

There was Leo, Hol’s favorite stuffed white tiger. She’d adored him, carrying him everywhere. I’d been jealous once—just once—and because of me, Leo now wore an eye patch that my mom had lovingly sewn. The white fur was matted and gray with age, the little patch still crooked. Holding it now, I felt the sting of guilt I hadn’t known I’d carried. It wasn’t just a toy. It had been her joy, and I’d scarred it. Was I like that? Did I have trouble controlling my emotions? Did I take it out on Hol?

*“I was a kid,”* I whispered aloud, trying to rationalize it. But the thought turned sour. *No excuse.*

Something shifted in the air, a barely perceptible sound—like whispers carried by the attic’s stale breath. *No excuse.* The words coiled around me, soft at first, then louder, crashing in a rising crescendo. I shook my head, desperate to quiet them. I hummed a tune I barely remembered, a childhood melody that brought me a sliver of comfort.

Beneath the toys were drawings—mine, mostly. Memories of afternoons spent with crayons and markers came flooding back. Hadn’t I also drawn things for Hol? I had, I remember now. *“ Draw me tigers, rainbows, and sunflowers,”* she’d say with wide eyes. And I’d oblige.

*“For Hol,”* the words on the drawings said, surrounded by little hearts. The ones with tigers, rainbows, and sunflowers. They were happy, innocent pieces. Tigers played under rainbows; sunflowers stretched tall under bright skies. But not all the drawings were like that.

The others—the ones I’d made just for me—were different.

I flipped through them, the familiar unease returning. My mom’s voice echoed in my mind: *“So many of your drawings have ghosts in them.”* She wasn’t wrong. I hadn’t noticed it as a child, but now, staring at the crude figures, I couldn’t deny it.

One drawing caught my eye—a family portrait. Stick figures, all of us together. Except I’d drawn myself twice. One version of me stood with the others, smiling. The second… it was scrawled in red, thick and angry, overlapping lines that slashed across the page like open wounds.

The whispers came again, closer this time. *Always broken. Always broken.*

I dropped the drawing, my hands trembling.

What had Grandma wanted me to see? What had she hoped I’d remember?

The ghosts in the drawings weren’t just stick figures—they were hollow-eyed, monstrous things. Their smiles stretched too wide, jagged mouths curling unnaturally across their faces.

Why had I drawn these things?

I flipped to another drawing—a grotesque scene of a monster killing a man. Below it, in a child’s scrawl, I had written: *“It’s fun to murder.”*

I shook my head, trying to dismiss it. *Just a kid with a vivid imagination.* It didn’t mean anything, right? I’d probably been inspired by that old horror movie with the murderous doll—*Child’s Play,* I think it was called.

But the whispers disagreed.

*You lie to yourself,* they hissed. Their voices wrapped around me, overlapping in a maddening chorus that rose from every shadow in the attic. *You were always broken. Dark and twisted. Poor Hol. She suffered because of you.*

“NO!” I screamed, clamping my hands over my ears. I started humming the tune Hol and I used to sing together, trying to drown out the voices. But it didn’t help. They weren’t coming from the attic—they were inside my head.

*This can’t be what Grandma wanted me to see.*

*Did she set me up? Was she in on it all?*

“Keep going,” a voice commanded, louder and sharper than the rest. It cut through the noise like a knife.

I obeyed.

I opened the photo album, flipping through the pages of old, faded Polaroids bleached by time. There we were—Hol and me, side by side in nearly every photo. I hadn’t looked at these in years. As if seeing her face would bring back something I I’d rather leave behind. She smiled at me now, from the old, faded Polaroid. One of the last taken of her and me before she died. Forever 8 years old. Sitting next to me in our parents’ old storage space, where we kept all the Christmas decorations. Where we used to play.

Her expression haunted me. Something about the way she sat, slightly too far away from me, as if something had spooked her.

The whispers grew louder, their words like daggers: *“Yes, yes, yes! She was scared of you! Scared of you!”*

“NO!” I yelled, my voice shaking as almost slammed the album shut.

But then my eyes caught another picture.

It was of me and Hol in the garden, standing beneath two towering sunflowers. Our smiling faces beamed with innocent, unrestrained joy.

“Draw me tall sunflowers,” her small voice echoed in my head, faint and almost drowned by the whispers.

My mom once told me the world, everything and everyone in it, seems larger, more mysterious, and adventurous to a child. Everything is new and exciting. Everything must be explored. A child will see entire universes in a simple leaf.

We forget though, most of us, what it’s like to have that kind of imagination.

I remembered how we used to play in that garden. To us, it was a jungle. Flowers, weeds, and trees became magical kingdoms. We were adventurers, explorers, greeting every animal and insect like old friends, and looking up at the sunflowers who seemed to reach into the sky.

I remembered the first time Hol saw a rainbow. We were lying on the grass, rain lightly falling around us. Her eyes lit up with wonder.

“What is that pretty thing in the sky?” she asked.

“It’s a rainbow, Hol,” I told her. She dragged me around the rest of the day trying to chase it down.

Our backyard was a jungle. Our jungle. Flowers, weeds, large trees, and bushes were everywhere.

On lazy summer days, we would play this game, where we’d pretend one of us was a big hungry tiger chasing the other one through the garden.

I remember running through the bushes, with leaves and branches hitting my face, my heart racing with pure excitement and joy as I heard Hol closing in behind me. She’d growl like a tiger, and we would both finally collapse in a fit of giggles when she eventually caught me.

After she died, the garden changed. It looked the same but felt different, empty of something essential, occupied by something monstrous. Once it had been a jungle of wonder, a kaleidoscope of greens, yellows, reds, and purple bursting with life. Now, the leaves seemed dull, their edges curling inward like clawed hands. The sunflowers loomed less like gentle giants and more like towering sentinels, guarding something sinister.

I remembered the last time I ran through that garden.

I was 14, desperate to feel like I had back when Hol was alive. I ran through the weeds and bushes, pretending she was chasing me like she used to.

I remember running through the weeds and bushes like I had done so many times before, my heart racing with excitement. Then I heard it—branches crackling behind me, bushes being trampled. The laughter coupled with growling. Her laughter. Her growling.

Only it wasn’t.

It sounded wrong, like a deliberately bad imitation—a wailing, painful laughter devoid of joy or innocence. An angry, guttural growl.

I stopped and glanced over my shoulder, and that’s when I saw her. Pale, ghostly, slightly obscured through the weeds and bushes. Her eyes—those dead, accusing eyes—stared straight at me. Eyes that had closed forever and been buried years ago.

I froze, paralyzed by fear, as she slowly crept out from the shadows. She crawled on all fours like she used to, pretending to be a tiger. Only this time, her movements were predatory—deliberate, menacing. Her limbs, broken and twisted as they had been the day she died, jerked unnaturally with every step, like a marionette controlled by unseen strings. The growling deepened, layered with something that didn’t belong to her small frame.

Her face, once so full of life, was now pale and contorted with hatred. The light that had danced in her eyes during our childhood adventures was gone, replaced by an empty, seething darkness.

Her lips twisted into a wicked, unnatural smile that stretched far too wide, splitting her pale face like a gash. Jagged, yellowed teeth—too many to count—filled a mouth that seemed to grow larger the longer I stared. Her bright blue eyes turned to black pits, glinting with an otherworldly hate that seemed to pierce my very soul.

“Don’t you want to play anymore?” Her voice was guttural, a hideous growl that rumbled from deep inside her throat.

I turned and ran. I ran like I’d never run before. My chest burned, my heart pounded, but I didn’t dare stop. There would be no giggling or collapsing in fits of laughter this time. If she caught me, I knew it wouldn’t end with joy.

Behind me, I heard her—half-wailing, half-growling—a rising crescendo of fury. Her voice rang out, a guttural howl that sent shivers down my spine.

“It’s your fault! It’s all your fault! And now you leave me!” Her words tore through the air, sharp and ragged, like a thousand nails scraping against bone. The sound vibrated in my skull, drilling into my thoughts.

Branches whipped at my face, cutting my skin as I ran. The air around me felt thick and heavy, carrying the acrid scent of decay. My lungs burned as I gasped for breath, pushing my legs harder than I ever thought possible.

The crackling of branches behind me grew louder. Her howling was closer now, and I was certain she’d catch me. I screamed, the sound ripping from my throat, raw and desperate. Somewhere in the distance, I heard a voice calling out—a lifeline.

I burst out of the bushes and into the open. Strong arms wrapped around me, and I thrashed wildly, convinced she’d caught me. It wasn’t until I felt the familiar warmth of my mother’s embrace that I realized I was safe. I buried my face in her chest, sobbing uncontrollably. She held me tightly, rubbing my back in silent comfort.

“What happened?” she asked softly, but I couldn’t possibly begin to explain. No more words were said about it. We were never good at talking in my family.

As I glanced back, tears blurring my vision, I saw her. Half-hidden in the bushes, her pale, ghoulish face stared at me with those empty, hateful eyes. That smile—God, that smile—was still there, carved into her face like a cruel scar.

Had she always been there? Watching me through the years, through my lonely, sibling-less childhood? Always one step behind, waiting for the right moment to strike?

No. This wasn’t her. It couldn’t be. This was something else. Something monstrous. This was the “it” Grandma had warned me about.

How could I fight something when I didn’t even know what it was? What it wanted?

I know I wasn’t the best brother. I know I’ve screwed up—then and now. I could never be like her. Perfect Hollie. I wasn’t there for her when she needed me most. Maybe… maybe I was even partly to blame for what happened to her. For when she fell. Is that what it wanted me to admit? Would that bring me peace?

I couldn’t tell where the whispers ended and my own thoughts began. They echoed in my mind, relentless and accusing.

I took the Polaroid of Hol, me and the sunflowers. I took the drawings I’d made for her, too. I held onto the memories—of running through the bushes, of laughter, of childhood wonder. Of tigers, rainbows, and sunflowers.

I don’t know what’s coming, but I need those memories. I need them close.
