Today was my eighteenth birthday. It wasn't anything special tho being a person from a middle class family with a low income household and never socializing much, there wasn't a cake or friends that came to surprise me for my birthday. The only wish I got was from my driving simulator saying how happy they were to have me. I woke up as usual and got ready to do absolutely nothing but exist all day hoping someone would send me a mail saying I was hired and crossing my fingers that my birthday present would come in the form of a new job. 


The day went by slowly, second by second, I could hear the pendulum of the clock hit the end points once each second and the second hand moving just at about the same time.


Just like this, the day went by with no mail or nothing. I stood up and opened the window that was beside my bed and just looked outside at the empty road with an occasional car passing by.

The phone on my pocket buzzed. Being the people pleaser that I am I immediately took it out to look who texted me but there was nothing. 
Weird, I thought. Maybe the phone wished me birthday, I pushed it off.


My parents came back from work together. They seemed happy than usual today must be since they came back together and stopped at some place as they are a bit late than usual. 
My mom asked me if I wanted anything and I told her I ate already. She asked me to clean my room and went back downstairs. 


I heard my mom and dad wishpering in the kitchen but I didn't pay much attention neither did I bother looking as they did it when they were talking about my worsening studies and lack of interest in anything.
I grabbed myself my half eaten packet of chips from the living room sofa and went back upstairs to my room.


Then I heard a knock on the door. I thought it was mom or dad wanting something but when I opened it there wasn't anyone.
I shouted MOM but there was no reply.
Wow I must be imagining things I thought.
I went back to my computer to play some games when my phone rang. I answered but there was nobody talking on the other side. Only heavy breathing with an occasional deep breath. I cut the phone thinking it was some kinda butt dial or a prank. Then I cut the call and continue gaming.
After a while I could hear my door creak open and someone walk in but I had an intense moment going on so I didn't bother looking. I thought it's mom or dad came in to get something. Later when I realized they hadn't left, I turned back to see nobody.
That was it. It's enough weirdness for the day, I say and then go downstairs to look for mom. I look in the kitchen, the living room, even the bathroom is empty. I call her but she doesn't pick up. 


Then I call my dad and someone picks up the phone and it's not my dad.


"Hello, who am I speaking to?"


"Hey uh this is the son of the phone's owner... Who am I Speaking to?"


"Oh this is the BlueBrick Hospital, I'm sorry to inform you that your dad and mom were in a car accident and died on the way to the hospital about three hours ago"


My jaw dropped, my heart shrunk and my brain went numb. I didn't know what to say. Then it clicked me. The phone buzzed three hours ago. But who did I let in the house? Who was wishpering in the kitchen? Where are they now?

 
I had so many questions but no answers. Is this how my birthday is supposed to go? 


Is this my birthday present?


Just then I hear my mom's voice, coming from the living room asking me to come down.
I couldn't believe my ears.


I look outside the window,"I could surely make this jump"


 I jump off trying to be as quiet as I could but being not so athletic I make a huge noise when I drop spraining my ankle in the process.


I run to the main door but there was my dad, covered in blood, with a pair of medical scissors in one hand and a knife on the other, looking at me with a huge smile and just as I turned I saw my mom in similar clothes, walking towards me with a knife dripping with her blood.
