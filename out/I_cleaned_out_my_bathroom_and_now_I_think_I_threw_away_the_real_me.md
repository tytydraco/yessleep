I spent most of yesterday reorganizing my bathroom. I wasn’t planning on it. I just went in to grab some floss and ended up on the floor, knee-deep in plastic bins and expired products. I think we all have that one drawer or cabinet. The one where things go to die. Mine happens to be where I’ve been storing almost a decade of backup skincare, hair tools, and half-used personal hygiene products.

It wasn’t hoarding. I swear. I just like what I like. When I find a shampoo that works, I buy five. If a deodorant smells good and goes on smooth, I’m sticking with it until the end of time. Call it habit, call it brand loyalty, call it over-consumption. I always saw it as being prepared. Until yesterday.

At first it was oddly satisfying. Tossing dried-up mascaras. Grouping razors together in a little tray. Lining up my backup moisturizers like soldiers. I felt like I was reclaiming space. Taking inventory of my life.

Then I started noticing patterns.

Three of the same hairbrush, all opened but barely used. Four tubes of toothpaste, the exact same kind, same size, bought years apart but somehow all opened from the same end. Five sticks of deodorant. The same brand, same scent, different degrees of wear. I couldn’t remember using more than one.

That was fine. Maybe I had a weird thing where I open stuff, forget, and open a new one. I tried to ignore it.

But there was this weight to everything. Like my belongings were watching me. Waiting for me to make a decision. Each time I picked something up, I felt like I was peeling something loose. Like a layer of myself that had crusted over.

I rubbed labels until the ink came off. Snapped open bottles just to make sure they were empty. I was being ruthless. No more stockpiling. No more keeping things “just in case.” I told myself I couldn’t bring anything new into this place until I made space for it. Real space.

Not just in drawers. In me.

I think that’s when it started.

I began to feel like I was downsizing more than my bathroom. Every cotton swab, every crusted cap, every crumbling face mask—I threw it away like I was pruning a part of my body. Not metaphorically. It felt physical. Like I was rubbing off my own edges to make myself smaller.

And it wasn’t just trash. It was my skin cells. My hair. Dried saliva on floss. My scent, preserved in lotions. My fingertips, pressed into caps and jars and tubes for years.

It hit me that our DNA is everywhere.

Every time I use something, I leave a trace behind. A residue. A record. And I don’t think I ever really understood how much of me I’ve left in this apartment. How much I’ve sealed into drawers and lids and trash bins. Not memories. Pieces.

I was in the middle of wiping out a little white organizer bin when I found a strand of my hair curled into the corner. Old, brittle, almost clear. I picked it up without thinking and dropped it into the trash. But then I paused.

I had cut my hair two months ago. Short. That strand was long.

Much longer than it should have been.

And it was tied at one end.

I stared at the trash bag. I had filled it with bits of myself. Not just junk, not just clutter, but discarded versions. Past selves that had slowly been rubbed away over time, left behind in packaging and residue and lint.

I kept going. I couldn’t stop.

Then I found a box.

It was shoved in the far back corner of the under-sink cabinet. Small, white, unmarked. I don’t remember putting it there. I don’t remember seeing it the last time I cleaned.

Inside the box was a sealed bag. Inside the bag was trash. Used floss picks. Cotton pads soaked in micellar water. Q-tips with black smudges on the ends. Bits of hair. A contact lens. A Band-Aid.

All of it mine.

But I never saved this. I never bagged it. I never put it away.

I sat on the floor for a long time. I didn’t move. I just stared at the bag and started breathing slower. Something wasn’t right.

I looked up and caught my reflection in the mirror. Nothing wrong. Just me. But when I tilted my head, it didn’t move right away. Like there was a lag. A delay in the glass.

I didn’t sleep last night.

I kept the light on. I lay in bed thinking about every item I’ve ever thrown away. Every towel I’ve donated. Every empty bottle I’ve dropped into the bin. How many pieces of me have been replicated. Preserved. Shelved.

I went back in the bathroom this morning and the trash I had bagged yesterday was gone.

Not taken to the curb. Not moved to the hallway. Just... gone.

The only thing under the sink was the box again. Same size. Same placement. But now it was full of items I hadn’t thrown away yet. Things I was going to get rid of today. A toothbrush I hadn’t opened. A serum I was still using. A nail file I swore I just had in the drawer.

I opened the medicine cabinet. Every product was full. New. Lined up neatly.

I don’t remember doing that.

I don’t know what I threw away.

I don’t know which version of me I am.

And when I smiled at my reflection, it smiled back too soon.
