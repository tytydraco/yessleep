I recently moved into a quaint cottage at the edge of a dense forest. Finally getting some peace after living in the city my whole life, it was lovely for the first couple of weeks. But last night, it became a nightmare.  
  
I had just settled into bed, the only source of light being the soft glow of my bedside lamp. I read a book I'd wanted to read for quite a while, but never got the time to do. The silence was comforting, or at least it was until I heard a faint whisper, almost imperceptible. At first, I dismissed it as my imagination playing tricks on me, but as I strained my ears, the whisper persisted.  
  
It sounded like someone softly muttering words just beyond the reach of my understanding. The voice seemed to be coming from within the walls themselves, like the very structure of my home was whispering secrets. Goosebumps formed on my skin as I tried to decipher the words, but they were elusive, slipping away like mist.  
  
I told myself it was the wind or perhaps the creaks and groans of an old house settling, but deep down, I knew it was something else. My heart raced, and a chill ran down my spine as the whispers intensified, growing clearer and more coherent. It was as if unseen entities were sharing a conversation, mocking my solitude.  
  
Terrified, I grabbed my phone, ready to dial the police, but as soon as my fingers touched the screen, the whispers ceased abruptly. The room plunged into silence, a silence so profound it felt like the world outside had disappeared. I hesitated, my senses on high alert, but when nothing happened, I convinced myself it was over. Yet again, I thought that perhaps my mind was playing tricks on me.  
  
Just as I was about to put my phone down, I heard a soft, deliberate tap on my bedroom window. I froze, my eyes fixed on the curtain-covered glass. Another tap followed, rhythmic and deliberate. Panic set in, and I mustered the courage to slowly draw back the curtain. Nothing. Somehow a wave of courage hit me and I opened the window slightly.  
  
There was nothing outside but the enveloping darkness of the forest. And there were no trees rustling, no wind blowing â€“ just an oppressive, unnatural stillness. I scanned the shadows, my eyes straining to catch any movement, but there was none. The taps had stopped, leaving me alone with the unsettling quiet.  
  
Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, I heard the whispers again, this time echoing from the depths of the forest. The voices seemed to be closing in, their words growing clearer and more sinister. I stumbled back, my mind racing with fear and confusion. What did they want? Why were they tormenting me?  
  
I quickly closed the window and picked up my phone. I started dialing the police before suddenly, of course, the battery died. As the feeling of complete dread hit me, my whole body froze as I heard a knock on my door.
