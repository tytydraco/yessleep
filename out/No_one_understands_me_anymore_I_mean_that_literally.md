This all began three weeks ago, after my almost year-long relationship with my ex ended.

Things were amazing with Lily at first. 

She was hot, way out of my league, but what really made me fall for her was how well we meshed together. How seamlessly we understood each other. She met my every need, big or small.

I’d have only just put my fork down to reach for the tomato sauce and she’d already be passing it to me. I’d sink onto the couch, in the mood for a good horror movie, and before I could suggest the idea, she’d smile and say, “This feels like a horror movie night.” I’d wake up from some pretty heated dreams and she’d already be swinging her leg over me, ready to start the morning exactly how I imagined it.

So after five months, I made the very smart, not at all too soon decision of asking her to move in with me.

It was amazing. At first. 

She was the first girl I'd ever met who didn't care if I played video games for hours, because she'd just sit beside me the whole time, watching me play. She didn't care what I did, as long as I was within reach. Always within reach. Her nails would trail circles on the back of my neck, glide along my arms, or she’d just rest her foot on top of mine.

She constantly wanted me in touching distance.

I loved it at first. I knew we were probably getting a bit *too* attached to each other. I stopped seeing my friends as much. I called my family less. 

Then one day after work, the guys invited me to the pub. It made me realise it'd been way too long since I hung out with them. I didn’t see the problem and texted Lily to let her know I’d be home late. Just a few pints. 

There was a skimpy at the bar, so I didn’t stay long. I didn’t even look at her. I averted my eyes out of respect for Lily. I was a good guy. A good boyfriend.

When I got home, Lily was livid.

“You went to a skimpies bar?”

There wasn’t a bar in our rural mining town without skimpies - and I barely even stayed an hour - but I didn’t argue. I felt guilty at the hurt in her eyes as she sobbed into my chest. I didn't realise she'd feel so hurt by it, but of course she would. I never should've gone. So I stopped going out to the pub with the guys. 

I thought it was the skimpies that were the problem. So, when the guys invited me out to play golf, I thought it'd be no big deal. It was completely innocent. 

Wrong. 

She was livid at me again. 

"You don't even *like* golf," she cried out. 

"I just wanted to see my mates," I said carefully. 

"So you'd rather spend time with them than me?"

"Babe…" I was shocked seeing this insecure side of her I'd never seen before. And definitely a little off-put. Was she being serious? 

"I am… *allowed* to see my mates… right?" I said it slowly, hoping it'd make her understand how ridiculous she was being.

And it did. She sighed, her anger dissipating, replaced by the sort of sadness that reminded me of a kicked puppy. It made my stomach clench in guilt. 

"I'm sorry. I just missed you," she said. 

After that, she stopped being livid whenever I went out without her. 

Instead, she punished me quietly. 

If I came home from playing pool at a mate’s house, she’d barely look at me, barely speak. I’d feel sick with guilt even though I knew I’d done nothing wrong. 

The breaking point was lunch with my mum.

I got home, and she gave me the exact same attitude she always did, acting all cold and distant and miserable, which in turn made *me* miserable. 

I'd had enough. I was sick of it. 

"Are you serious, Lily? You're *seriously* going to make me feel bad about seeing my own mother? The woman who gave birth to me?"

"I'm sorry," she said, tears in her eyes. "I just get jealous."

"Of my mum? That's insane." 

She stepped closer. "Well maybe…. maybe I just want you all to myself. Is that really so bad?" she murmured softly. 

For a moment, I was in a trance, forgetting why I was mad in the first place as she stared up at me from under her lashes, her soft lips pressed into a little pout. 

I knew if she touched me, I’d cave.

So I stepped back.

“I don’t think I can do this anymore,” I said quietly, refusing to meet her eyes. If I did, I wouldn't be able to say it. “I think we need a break.”

“A break?” she scoffed. “Or a breakup?”

I didn’t answer.

“Let me make the decision for you,” she said. “Good luck finding anyone else who understands you like I do.”

She packed her things and left. 

I stayed silent, even though one word from me would’ve stopped her. Even though I *wanted* to stop her. This was for the best. For me, and for her. She was too attached. It wasn't healthy for either of us. 

The weekend was hell. I’d sit in front of my console, staring at the loading screen, remembering her fingers in my hair. Her constant touch. Her steady, comforting presence. And then the house would feel unbearably empty.

When I went back to work, everyone could tell I was in a foul mood. 

At the time, I didn’t notice anything strange about that day. Looking back now, I don’t know how I missed it.

“Everything all right, mate? You and your missus have a fight?” Greg, my older manager, asked. He was a good bloke, always had been.

“I fucked it all up,” I mumbled without thinking. It was the only sentence my brain seemed capable of forming.

“Oh, you’re both doing well then? That’s great, mate. Must just be a bit hungover, eh?” Greg said with a wink.

I frowned at him, but I was too wrapped up in my own head to notice how little sense his response made.

It wasn’t until the next shift that I really started paying attention.

“Jerry and the boys are meeting at the pub later. Joining us, Harry?” Lachlan asked.

I blinked. My first instinct was to say no, that I wasn’t in the mood. Then I realised there was nothing stopping me anymore. No one waiting at home. And a pint with the boys sounded better than going back to my empty apartment, where everything reminded me of her.

“Yeah, sure,” I said.

“Ah, bummer. The missus still has a problem with those skimpies, does she? You should really tell her they’ve got nothing on her and her banging body,” Lachlan chuckled.

“Don’t talk about her like that,” I snapped. Then I frowned, the words catching up to me. “I said I'll come. We broke up, didn’t Greg tell you?”

“Still don’t get what she’s doing with a guy like you. You’re what, a four? Nah, like a three and a half. Lily is a solid ten.”

I stared at him, annoyed as hell, but more confused than anything. Why wasn’t he listening?

“We. Broke. Up,” I said slowly.

“Honestly, I get why you don’t hang out with the lads anymore. If I had a woman like that waiting for me in my bed, you boys would never see me again,” Lachlan laughed.

I just looked at him, wondering if he was deliberately fucking with me, and briefly imagining my fist connecting with his acne-scarred face.

“Just shut the hell up,” I said.

“Tell her hi from me later on,” he smirked. “Tell her I could show her what a real man is like.”

I was seconds away from punching him when Greg called us over.

That night, I joined the lads at the bar. I still caught myself averting my eyes from the skimpy, even though I had no reason to anymore. It felt wrong, like muscle memory I couldn’t shake. And irritatingly, Lachlan was right. No one compared to Lily.

.The boys looked genuinely shocked when they saw me.

“What’re you doing here, mate? Isn’t it you and your missus’ anniversary today?” Greg asked.

It was. One year exactly. But we weren’t together anymore, and I was past exhausted with this.

“Guys, we broke up. Are you messing with me or something? It isn’t funny. It’s kinda fucked up, actually.”

“You just left her at the house? That’s low, bro. Who would leave a girl like that at home?”

“We broke up!”

It was pointless. They were purposely ignoring me, and I couldn’t understand why.

For the next half hour, they kept shooting me weird, dirty looks. Judgemental ones. Lachlan just smirked, like this meant it was finally his chance with Lily.

But Lily wasn’t here. Why did they think she was still around? 

What the hell was wrong with them?

“Your pale ale,” the waitress said, setting a beer in front of me.

“I ordered a Guinness,” I frowned. Normally, I’d just accept it. I hated making a fuss. But between the boys and the constant misunderstanding, something in me snapped.

“Yes, this is your pale ale,” she said slowly, like I was stupid.

“I *know*, but I ordered a *Guinness*.”

“Sir, this is a pale ale,” she said again, irritation creeping into her voice.

“I. Know.”

I was seething. Why did *she* look annoyed?

“I. Ordered. A. Guinness.”

“I already told you, this *is* your pale ale!” she snapped, crossing her arms before storming off.

I stared after her, completely disoriented.

“What the hell is her problem?” I asked.

No one answered. I turned back to the boys, searching their faces for anything that'd back me up, but they were all glaring at me.

“What’s the matter with you?” Greg demanded. “Have you gone mad?”

My chest tightened. Was I going mad? Or had everyone else?

“I’m sorry,” I said instead. “I’ve been a mess since Lily left me, alright?”

“You didn’t even buy her roses?” Greg’s eyebrows shot up. “On your anniversary? Go back home to your missus, mate. Go make things right.”

What the hell?

I stood up, my head pounding, and left the bar. My thoughts were spiralling.

What is going on?

At home, I called my mum. 

I needed to be grounded. I needed something familiar. Her voice had always been able to pull me back when everything else felt wrong.

“Hey, Mum. I really need someone to talk to,” I said.

“I’m good, honey, what about yourself?” she replied.

The answer immediately put me on edge. It didn’t match what I’d just said at all. Still, I told myself she hadn’t heard me properly. Mum’s hearing wasn’t always the best.

“Not great, honestly. Lily and I broke up a few days ago.”

My throat tightened as I said it. Tears stung my eyes, the first time I’d felt close to crying since she left. Talking to my mum always did that. Like I could finally let my guard down.

“Did she like the flowers? What flowers did you get her? I hope you cooked her a good dinner too. You’ve got a good one there, Harry,” Mum said cheerfully.

My body went cold.

No. There was no way she was ignoring me too. My mum wouldn’t do that. She’d never be that cruel.

I tried again, slower this time.

“Mum, we broke up. Lily and I broke up.”

“That’s wonderful. I’m so happy you’ve found such a beautiful relationship. You better put a ring on it soon,” she laughed.

I hurled my phone across the room. My chest rose and fell as I paced.

Why didn’t anyone understand what I was saying?

Lily’s voice echoed in my head.

“Good luck finding anyone else who understands you like I do.”

My thoughts raced. It was ridiculous, impossible, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that this was somehow her doing. Had she told the boys to mess with me? To make me feel crazy as some kind of punishment? I was sure most of them would do anything if she smiled at them.

But my mum too? That didn’t make sense.

Needing answers, I rushed back to my phone, relieved to see it hadn’t cracked. The call was still connected.

“Harry? Are you there?”

“Yeah, I’ve gotta go, Mum. Love you,” I said.

“Yes, I am looking forward to lunch next week,” she replied pleasantly. 

Even that didn’t line up with what I’d said.

I ended the call with a shaky breath and dialled Lily’s number, only hesitating for a moment.

She picked up on the first ring, just like she always used to. Lily had always been within reach. Always there when I needed her.

“Harry?”

Her voice was soft. Sad. My chest tightened instantly. I’d missed her voice more than I wanted to admit.

I forced myself to stay focused. “Did you tell everyone to mess with me?”

“Mess with you?” she repeated.

Relief flooded through me so sharply it almost made me dizzy. For the first time in days, someone had responded in a way that actually made sense. She wasn’t ignoring me. She wasn’t twisting my words.

She was listening.

She was understanding me.

“Harry, what are you talking about?”

“I— uh.” I hesitated, suddenly aware of how insane I sounded. Still, I couldn’t let it go. “It’s just— everyone is ignoring me. They’re not listening to a thing I’m saying. They’re making me feel crazy. And I remember the last thing you said to me was ‘good luck finding anyone else who understands me like I do.’" 

She went quiet.

The silence stretched unbearably, my heart hammered in my chest.

“I said that because I was hurt,” she said finally, her voice low.

Guilt stabbed straight through me. I’d never wanted to hurt her; that had never been my intention.

“What do you mean everyone is ignoring you?” she asked. She sounded genuinely confused. Concerned, even.

I dragged a hand down my face. “It’s like they’re pranking me. I’ll say one thing, and they’ll respond with something that makes no sense. I can’t get through to anyone.”

Saying it out loud only made it feel worse, unreal, like I was describing someone else’s breakdown.

“I understand,” she said.

My head snapped up. “You do?”

“Yeah. Since coming back to live with my parents… seeing my friends again… I don’t know. It’s like no one’s on the same wavelength as me. I can’t connect with anyone either, Harry,” she said quietly. “Not since you.”

My chest ached.

That wasn’t what I meant… *was it?*

“I miss you,” the words tumbled from my mouth before I could stop them. They felt right to say. I did miss her. 

“I miss you too. But you’re right. This is for the best. When I moved out there, all I had was you. I guess I got pretty attached. It was hard to make friends. I was jealous you had so many people, and all I had was you.”

She sighed, and the sound twisted something deep in me.

I remembered those moments clearly now. Her jealousy. Her insecurity. I’d always brushed it off. But I’d lived in this town my whole life. She’d left everything behind for me. Family. Friends. Her entire support system.

Of course she’d clung to me.

Why had that ever felt like a problem?

Why hadn’t I just brought her along more, instead of insisting on doing my own thing?

The more I thought about it, the less sense our breakup made. The unease I’d felt around her dissolved, replaced by regret so sharp it made my chest hurt.

“I want you back, Lily. I’m so sorry for neglecting your feelings. I was a shit boyfriend,” I said.

“I want you back too.”

Hope surged through me.

“But I think we need a little more space. It’s nice being around friends and family again. I’m remembering who I was before you.”

Something inside me cracked.

I didn’t want her to remember who she was before me. I didn’t want her to be okay without me.

I wasn’t okay without her.

“Give it another week. Then I’ll come visit, and see if we still have something,” she suggested.

The thought of another week without her made my chest ache, but I swallowed it down.

“Okay.”

That whole week, the only thing keeping me sane was knowing I’d see her again soon. The insanity never stopped - people continued misunderstanding every word I said. Everyone still acted like Lily and I were together, like nothing was wrong. I’d order a chicken parmi at a restaurant and get spaghetti instead.

And then finally, she came back.

I picked her up from the train station and scooped her into my arms. She was just as stunning as ever, smelling amazing despite being in a stuffy train for seven hours. Her laughter was like music in my ears.

I’d never been more ecstatic in my life.

We spent most of the evening in bed, and when we were physically exhausted, I rolled over to look at her and said, “I’m never letting you out of my sight again.”

“Finally, you know how I feel,” she smiled, rolling her eyes.

She moved back in.

At work, I was in a better mood than I’d been in for two weeks. Greg noticed.

“Someone’s happy.”

“Yeah,” I said, accepting that people were going to misinterpret everything I said these days. I didn’t care anymore - I had my beautiful girl back.

“I got her back,” I said with a happy sigh.

Greg frowned.

 “Who? Lily?” His eyes widened. “Did you two break up?”

“Yeah, man—” I paused.

He understood what I said. He actually replied with something that made sense for once.

I narrowed my eyes.

“So you were messing with me?”

Greg looked at me like I was an idiot.

“Messing with you? Man, what are you talking about?”

“All those times I told you we’d broken up, you did hear what I said, didn’t you?” I accused.

“Mate, I—” he paused, furrowing his brows like he was confused now. “Huh. That’s weird.”

“What?” I scoffed.

“You did tell us," he said in a sudden, shocked realisation. "You said it to Jerry five times in a row, ‘We broke up.’" 

That was when I had decided to just mess with them back a few days ago. I’d stared at Jerry with a flat look and repeated it robotically, and he’d just chuckled, and said, ‘Yeah, I guess the weather is nice today, man." 

“Weird. I swore you were going on about some other thing,” Greg said. “Wait, you said to me you shit your pants.”

I almost laughed.

That was also when I was messing with them. I’d just looked Greg directly in the eye and said, “I shit myself,” to see how far he’d take this weird prank.

But he just clapped me on the shoulder and said, “That’s great news, man.”

I stared at Greg, a cold, uncomfortable feeling washing over me at the genuine confusion on his face.

“Dude, we thought you were losing your mind. Why did I think it was normal for you to say, ‘Let’s go golfing.’ You hate golfing, you'd never suggest that. What the hell?”

He stepped back, looking like he wanted to vomit.

“I feel weird, man,” he said.

“Are you okay?” I asked, genuinely concerned.

“Yeah,” he furrowed his brows and gave me a weird look. “Let’s, uh, get back to work.”

It stuck with me all afternoon.

They had all been genuinely hearing things I wasn’t saying.

The other guys started understanding me again too. Even they seemed creeped out by something.

“It’s like some voodoo shit,” I heard Jerry mutter to Lachlan.

Lachlan almost looked scared when he looked at me now.

I didn’t let it spoil my mood. I was a little weirded out, sure, but I had my beautiful girl back. Everything felt right again.

“How was your day?” Lily asked when I came home.

I hugged her immediately and breathed her in. She was like a drug. Her scent, her warmth - my entire body relaxed.

“Good, but a lot better now.”

Over the week, the boys invited me out more than usual. They were persistent, but I refused every time. All I wanted was to be with Lily. I cancelled plans with Mum. I wanted to spend every minute with her. I even started thinking about quitting my well-paying job for a remote one so I could stay home. Anything to be surrounded by her.

Until one day, the boys cornered me at work.

They all looked worried. Even Lachlan.

“Something’s happening to you, man,” Jerry said. “And it’s because of Lily.”

“What?” I laughed, shaking my head.

He stayed serious.

“What do you even know about her?”

The question hit me like a punch.

“What do you mean?”

“I mean, what does she do? Does she work? Where does her family live? How did you meet?” Greg asked.

My mind went blank. I didn’t have answers to any of it.

But that wasn’t the worst part.

A strange part of me - something old and buried -screamed that something was wrong. Like a threat hovering just out of sight.

“She doesn’t work," I said.

*Does she?* I wasn’t sure.

“I make more than enough to support us both,” I shrugged. “Besides, she’s easy to provide for. And she catches the train to see her family, so obviously they must live in the city.”

“You don’t know where her parents live?” Jerry demanded. “Have you ever even met them?”

Of course I had.

Had I?

My stomach twisted.

“When did you pick her up from the train?” Lachlan suddenly asked.

I frowned. Why would he ask that?

“On Saturday,” I said.

All their faces drained of colour.

“Seriously, what is wrong with you guys?” I asked.

“The train doesn’t run on Saturdays, Harry,” Greg said, looking sick again.

“So what are you saying?” I folded my arms.

“She’s been lying to you. And she’s doing something really weird to you. And us. We didn’t understand what you were saying for a full week, Harry. Do you know how freaky that is? And now, when we think back on that week, it’s like there was an evil presence with us. Something controlling us. Something’s wrong with that chick.”

“Don’t talk about her like that,” I spat.

“How did you meet her, Harry?” Greg repeated.

“I don’t know!” I snapped.

They all looked at each other, like I'd just confirmed something for them. 

“You need to get away from her. She’s some sort of…” Jerry trailed off, like he knew the word he was about to say sounded ridiculous even to him.

“Fuck this. I’m leaving early.”

I turned away from them.

“We’ve never even met her, Harry! I could've sworn we had. But we haven't. Has your *mum* even met her?”

I kept walking because I didn’t want to admit the truth: *I don’t know.*

I was desperate to be back with her.

At home, she opened her arms, and I melted into them.

“The guys were saying some weird stuff today,” I mumbled into her hair.

“Just ignore them, baby. They’ll never understand what we have,” she hummed.

I took a few days off work. The boys blew up my phone, but I told them to leave me alone.

One night, I was looking for my hoodie -  my favourite hoodie. It was cold, and I needed it.

I wondered where it could be when I noticed, for the first time, the room.

It was just a normal room at the end of the hallway. But I’d never seen it before in my life.

I blinked. How could I not know there was a whole room in my own apartment?

I went inside.

It was small. A basic spare room, with a bed, a desk, a wardrobe.

But in the middle of the floor, a triangle of candles was laid out.

And in the centre of it sat my hoodie.

My favourite book - the one I’d been missing for months.

And my toothbrush - also missing for weeks.

I stared at them in shock, stepping closer.

“Don’t touch anything. Come back to bed, baby,” her voice said behind me.

I turned, and even though unease crept in, I couldn’t help but smile at her cute, sleepy face.

“What is all this?” I asked slowly, in some sort of haze. 

She shrugged.

My eyes flicked back to the bed, and a strange thought hit me - almost funny.

“Lily… When you left…” I began. “Did you ever actually… leave?”

She chuckled.

“Of course I didn’t, Harry. I’d never leave you. You’ll always be within my reach.”

I went back to bed.

And now, as she sleeps beside me, I’m typing this out on my phone.

There’s a part of me that knows something is wrong. That I’m under some kind of spell. I can feel the small voice in my head telling me to GET OUT, but it’s getting quieter.

Maybe the boys are right.

Maybe I know they are.

But has she really done anything I don’t want?

She wants me forever.

I want her forever.

I suppose the only reason I’m writing this at all is because I’m afraid I’ll forget I ever felt differently. 

Because I feel really forgetful these days.

And maybe I just want to see what other people think.

If a beautiful girl wants me all to herself, every day, for the rest of my life… is that really so bad?

It’s what I want, isn’t it?
