I’m Xiao Ma—Little Horse, they call me. It’s funny, I suppose. I like to joke, "My name's Little Horse, like the one that carries burdens, but also the Horse in Ox-Head and Horse-Face." But the joke’s a hollow one. You see, there’s nothing funny about what we do. I’m the Horse Face in Ox-Head and Horse-Face. We come for you when your time’s up. It’s not glamorous. It’s not glorious. But it is necessary.

At first, I thought the job would be simple: show up, collect the soul, and guide it into the next world. A duty, not a choice. But today, I learned nothing is ever that simple.

Old Ox—my mentor—has been doing this for centuries, long before my own death. He walks beside me now, as we step across the veil into the living world. There’s something unshakable about him, like a mountain watching the sky shift above it. He’s seen it all. Centuries of souls slipping out of their bodies like whispers on the wind. And somehow, he never flinches. That calm, unflinching quiet... I’ve never quite mastered it. He carries a stillness with him that the weight of this job never touches.

We’ve been summoned for Mr. Zhou, an 82-year-old man, living in a dim apartment crammed full of memories and dust. His time has come. The orders are clear: tonight is the night. A fall, a heart attack, and then—death. No exceptions. You know the old saying: "When Yama decrees your death at midnight, no one dares keep you alive until dawn." The rules are absolute.

Or so I thought.

We arrive in the dim-lit apartment. The air is heavy, thick with the scent of incense, though no offerings remain. Mr. Zhou sits on the edge of his bed, staring at the frail figure beside him—his wife. She is thin and pale, clinging to life with breaths as fragile as spider silk. I can feel the weight of loss here, gathering like a storm.

I step forward. “Mr. Zhou,” I say, my voice soft, not wanting to startle him. “It’s time.”

He doesn’t react the way they usually do—no panic, no shock. He turns to me slowly, and his tired eyes find mine. He already knows. They usually do. Deep down, something in all of them knows.

But instead of acceptance, I see something else. His head shakes, weakly, but with a force I wasn’t expecting.

“I can’t go,” he whispers. His voice is small, but there’s a tremor there, something raw. His eyes flick to his wife, lying in her bed. “Not yet.”

And there it is—something I wasn’t prepared for. The inevitability of death, crashing headlong into the fragile wall of his desperation. I glance at Old Ox. Surely, he’ll guide me now. But Old Ox, unshaken as ever, stands in the corner, watching. Waiting. This is my lesson to learn.

“I promised her,” Mr. Zhou’s voice trembles again. His hands reach out, smoothing the blanket over her frail body. “I promised I’d take care of her until the end.”

There’s a weight to his words, one that presses down on my heart in a way it hasn’t felt in... well, not since I died. I wasn’t supposed to feel this. I wasn’t supposed to care. But here it is—a quiet, gnawing injustice. How could we take him away and leave her behind? How could we be so... cold?

I turn to Old Ox, whispering. “What do we do?”

Old Ox watches me for what feels like an eternity. Finally, he speaks, his voice as calm as ever. “Sometimes, Little Horse, the rules aren’t as rigid as they seem.”

I blink. The rules, not rigid? Yama doesn’t tolerate mistakes. But Old Ox has walked this path longer than I can fathom. He knows the lines that can be bent.

I turn back to Mr. Zhou. “I can’t change your fate,” I begin slowly, feeling the weight of my words, “but... maybe we can give you some time.”

Mr. Zhou looks up at me, a flicker of something I hadn’t expected—hope. It’s fragile, like a candle flickering against the wind, but it’s there. He looks at his wife, then back at me. “How long?” His voice is barely a whisper.

“A couple of hours,” I say, glancing at Old Ox. He nods, barely perceptible, but enough. “Long enough to make sure she’s cared for.”

His face softens, and for the first time, he smiles. A small smile, yes, but real.

I watch as Mr. Zhou moves carefully around the apartment, each gesture tender and filled with love. He calls a nurse, confirms she’ll be there in the morning. He sets out his wife’s medicine, perfectly within reach, just the way she likes it. Then he goes to the kitchen, preparing a small pot of congee with century egg—her favorite. He pours it into a soup warmer, murmuring that the nurse can feed it to her tomorrow.

He waters the jasmine flowers by the window. “She’s always loved their scent,” he says quietly, his voice tinged with memory. “It calms her.”

As the minutes tick by, I watch this quiet, ordinary love unfold. And in this small, cramped apartment, with the dim light and the scent of jasmine and congee, it feels... sacred.

Finally, Mr. Zhou pulls on an old, worn knit sweater—deep brown, the kind that feels like home. “She made this for me,” he says, his voice barely more than a whisper. “Years ago. I promised I’d wear it whenever I felt cold. It still keeps me warm.”

He buttons it slowly, his fingers trembling. He adjusts her pillows, wipes her brow, whispers something only for her ears. There’s a tenderness here, a love so deep it doesn’t need to be spoken aloud.

Eventually, he sits at the foot of the bed, his hand resting on her leg. He looks up at me, and I see the acceptance in his eyes. “I’m ready now.”

Old Ox steps forward. His voice is deep and steady, as always. “Your wife will join you soon. It will be peaceful.”

Mr. Zhou nods, his frail body trembling. And then, the inevitable comes. His hand flies to his chest. The heart attack. This is the moment.

I rush forward, but I know it’s already too late.

His body crumples to the floor, and his soul, faint and glowing, slips free. He rises above the lifeless form he leaves behind, a strange calm settling over his face.

“It’s strange,” he says, his voice distant, as if from a place far away. “I thought it would hurt more.”

“It feels worse in life than in death,” I reply.

He takes one last look at his wife, resting peacefully on the bed. “I’ll wait for her,” he whispers.

And with that, Old Ox and I guide him toward the veil. As we walk, a lightness settles over me. We had bent the rules tonight, and in that bending, we’d found something... right.

I glance at Old Ox before we cross over. “How often can we do something like that?”

His smile is small, almost imperceptible, but it’s there. “Not often, Little Horse,” he says quietly. “But when the right soul comes along, you’ll know.”

And I smile too. Because maybe, just maybe, this job isn’t just about taking souls away. Maybe, sometimes, it’s about leaving them with peace.
