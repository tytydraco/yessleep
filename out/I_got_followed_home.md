This all starts many years ago..


I was still in my teens. My friends & I liked to go urban exploring, & go to haunted locations. We're from a small town, with nothing to do.


We had been told about a haunted bridge, at the edge of town. It's one of those old tiny communities, an un-incorporated part of the larger county. 


The legend says, if you park on the bridge, your car will go off, or your lights will go out while crossing. Some older people we knew, even claimed they saw a woman appear in front of the car.


This intrigued us. On Halloween night, we decided to go down there. There was five of us in total. Sarah, Gina, Joey, Russ, & Myself. 


As we're getting everything ready to go that night, I turned to Russ, & said "this trip feels a little different. Like for some reason, I feel like 'it' knows we're coming?" He acknowledged having a strange feeling as well. But, we brushed it off, as being a little spooked by it being Halloween. 


On our way down there, a few of us were partaking in drinking. Sarah was always the one in the group who kinda got ahead of herself, & drank too much. Not wanting her to ruin the trip, I take the vodka & hide it in my bag. 


As we approached the old, windy, red dirt road.. Joey stops the car, & turns to me.. "Look.." he says. I look up from the passenger seat, & see a thick fog covering the road..


I thought "Well, that's fitting".. We slowly crept up to the bridge, & none of us said a word. There was a thickness to the air.. 


We stop, right in the middle of the bridge. But, nothing happens. I said "why don't we get out & look around?" Everyone agrees.


As Sarah exits the backseat, & I see her stumble. Not wanting her to fall, I grab her arm, & we walk together. 


We're about a car length from the vehicle when the headlights flash off & on again. "Let's go, y'all" Gina whispers.. Russ interjects with "Isn't this what we came all the way down here for? Let's at least look around" 


Sarah wants to go down under the bridge, by the water.. I motion Joey to grab her other arm, & walk with us.


As we're walking down, Sarah out of no where starts to taunt whatever is there, saying things like "oh, you're not going to show yourself are you?".. "Coward" etc. Everyone starts telling her to stop being disrespectful. 


As we get by the water, I feel a static in the air.. I knew she had provoked it.. Sarah goes to taunt it again, but before she can even finish her sentence, she's pushed, forcefully out of me & Joeys grip. 


She hits the ground, nearly falling into the cold water.. "It pushed me!" She shouted. "I told you to stop! You never disrespect or provoke a spirit!" I said. 


I started feeling nauseous, I've always been sensitive to these kind of things.. Russ, seeing me in discomfort says "what do you feel? Do we need to go?" An image flashes into my mind of a woman, right in front of me.. 


I said "She's here.. we should go. Sarah, don't say another word" 


We get back up to the car. As we're getting in, Joey says "I just saw her.. oh my God" .. When we get into the car, the engine goes off.. after two failed attempts to restart it, it finally starts. 


We have to go across the bridge, do a U turn, & then re-cross it, to go back into town. As we're re-crossing the bridge, the lights go out again, I frantically turn on my flashlight & hold it out the window, hoping it's enough for Joey to see, in this foggy mess. 


We make it back to town, go to my house & order pizza, & decide to watch movies for the rest of the night. But, I could tell, all of us still secretly felt off.. We just weren't admitting it to each other.


We all fell asleep in the living room, on a huge pallet. During the night, I heard someone say my name.. I look up, but everyone else is asleep.. I was very restless that night. My dreams kept taking me back to the bridge.


Before the sun had even come up completely, the doorbell rings, making all of us jump.. I look at the clock, it's 6am. I crept to the door, to see a long time family friend, Loretta. 


I nervously open the door, letting her in.. 


She looks at me suspiciously.. then heads upstairs.


I only had enough time to lay down, & close my eyes before my mother comes running down the stairs & hollers "OP!" 


We all raise up.. "yes?" I said.. 


Loretta, walking calmly behind her, says.. "OP.. where were you last night?" 


I hesitate.. thinking about lying.. but, Loretta is a clairvoyant.. if she's asking me, then she probably already knows.. 


"Get up here & talk to you Aunt Loretta.. Now.." my mother says.


I climb the stairs to my bedroom.. Loretta is already sitting on my bed. "Where'd y'all go? Because she followed you home.." 


"We went to the bridge -"


 .. Loretta cuts me off.. "on Topsy?!" She says.. 


I nod, in agreement.


Lo: "Why would you go out there after what happened?" 


Me: ".. what happened?" 


She calls for my mother.. & says "you never told her about what happened down on Topsy?" 


My mother shakes her head "No.. I didn't think it was my place.. I thought her dad would've told her"


My mother sits with us on the bed. 


She says "in the late 50s.. you had a cousin, on your dad's side.. She had went thru a divorce, & started working down at the little bar on Topsy. It was close enough to her house, she could still keep an eye on her kids, & walk home. One night, she was followed by two men.. they did awful things to her, before eventually throwing her body off the bridge, & into the water.. Her name was Priscilla.."


I was shocked.. I started asking Loretta why she would've followed me. After all, I wasn't the one who provoked her. I tried to be respectful.


Loretta explains, Priscilla must've known we were family. & Says "We need to try to send her to the light, tonight"


My friends & I went to my great grandmothers house, & asked her about Priscilla. She showed us photos of her, & photos of her children. Granny tells us that Priscillas ex husband had paid the men to kill her, & all three were now dead. & She agreed that we could take the pictures for the night, as long as we brought them back. 


When we go to Loretta's, she & my mother have set up some candles, & I bring them the photos. We all sit at the dining room table, & Loretta starts speaking to Priscilla. She confirms that Priscilla followed me, because we're family. She was upset, & wanting to protect her children from their monster of a father. The photo of her children then moved across the table. Loretta tells her, that her ex husband, & the two men who hurt her, were dead, & most definitely in hell. Loretta tells her, she needs to find the light, so that one day, she can be with her children again.


The room became extremely cold, during this. She didn't want to move on, because she was waiting on her children. After much persuasion from Loretta, & I, she decided to go. 



I closed my eyes, & saw her.. she said  "thank you" & walked away into the light.. 


Then, the largest candle on the table went out, & the cold went away, immediately. That was all the confirmation I needed. I knew, she was gone.


Older people around here, still talk about the bridge.. but, I'm happy to report that no more paranormal activity goes on there. 


I was out that way, recently. I decided to stop, & look out over the water. I felt calm, knowing she was at peace.
