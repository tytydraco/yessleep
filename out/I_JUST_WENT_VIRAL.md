I just went viral!! I finally decided to try what everyone did and posted the picture. I can’t believe it 10million views 500 thousand likes and DMs are FULL with messages of men complimenting me wanting to take me out etc.

My morals what I stood so strongly against regarding posting a picture with barely there lace were old fashioned you know everyone is doing it everyone wants to be viral. It’s been a month since I went viral and the attention continues to increase I’m LOVING it.

Just got a lecture from my dad about how he raised me better than that and self respect blah blah blah. I’m going to get endorsements I told him they recognize me everywhere I go now! He ended the phone call with all money isn’t good money same for attention.

It’s been six months now and I’ve been doing well! I now live in a luxurious apartment with the best security driving my dream car and all I have to do is post pictures give shoutouts etc. Only downside is it seems as if every date I go on now they expect sex afterwards. I read through the comments under my recent video regarding my recent experiences things like: “You have no morals” “Nobody wants a woman everyone has seen naked”

Going viral wasn’t supposed to feel lonely at the end of each day. It wasn’t supposed to be depressing this was my dream I thought it would be easier. I wasn’t prepared for the death threats and jealousy from men and women. I wasn’t expecting the crazy obsessed fans that always try following me everywhere.

It’s been a year since I went viral I smile for the camera and numb the pain with drugs and liquor when the stream ends. Bottle of liquor in one hand scrolling through my comments with the other “Pretty, I wish I had your life, marry me” they offered a good distraction from the crippling pain of loneliness I feel. I love my fans even the weirdo obsessive ones everyone tells me to be wary of. They’re harmless, after all I live in one of the most secure buildings in the city.

I sit in front of the camera today my daily routine the fake smiling answering the questions ignoring the stalker that I’ve blocked numerous times and somehow always know where I am. Live stream over I sit here wondering what I should do next this routine is getting old a little more attention never killed anybody.

A year and a half since going viral and this live stream has the most viewers I’ve ever had. From all over the world all walks of life watching me but for once it wasn’t out of just or admiration. For once I didn’t have that fake smile plastered on my face instead tears streamed down as my stalker stands behind me telling them since he can’t have me they can’t either.

I was so convinced I was secure that all the evil was locked outside of the apartments gates only to find out evil manifests in many ways including the maintenance worker currently holding a gun to my head asking if I had any last messages. I did. I told my dad I was sorry and I wished I’d listened. Morality doesn’t shine as bright as vanity. Going viral was my dream the beginning of my life but apparently also the end. 

My stalker kisses me and says we’ll be together forever as he takes aim. My life flashes before my eyes as he fires the first shot. My happiest most proudest moments and they were all before the fame. Regret came with the second bullet realizing I was focusing so hard on material things I forgot by dreams of being a teacher, a wife, a mother. The last thing to cross my mind as that final bullet barreled towards me was “I wish I never went viral”. Laying on the floor bleeding out hearing his body thud after shooting himself.
Then eternal darkness.

I sat up fast waking from the terrible nightmare. I assured my husband I was fine just a bad dream. I went to each of my children’s rooms kissing their foreheads.
Staring at myself in the mirror the nightmare replaying in my head. I have everything I need everything I want I’m happy. All because instead of posting that provocative picture I deleted it.

I’m glad I’m not viral. No amount of fame or money could ever bring me the joy I feel when I look at my kids or kiss my husband. The warm feeling I get when my dad tells me how proud he is of the woman I’ve become. It’s crazy how one decision can have such different outcomes. I have all the adoration I could ever ask for here with my family. I’m glad I didn’t go viral thank God I never went viral.
