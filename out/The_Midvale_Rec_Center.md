It was 1991 and the time leading up to the summer was like a heartbeat, each beat getting closer to the fun, the excitement and the glory of being young. I was fourteen going on fifteen that July and all year I was discovering new things, making youthful chaos in an otherwise calm mid sized town. Peter Adams was fairly new at the beginning of eighth grade, his family moving to Midvale in the previous summer. He and I had a lot of the same interests so we became instant friends, he also fit into my friend group pretty well. There was Daryl, Mike, myself, Ben and Kevin. We made our own fun, palling around town, exploring the woods and sneaking beer or cigarettes. Peter and I became like a dynamic duo and oh how the jokes came flying about that from our buddies. There was something about Peter that I just couldn't put my finger on, every time we were together I felt funny, but a good kind of funny. I felt like I was falling in love.

We would horseplay a bit too much in the locker room, flinging jockstraps at each other, towel snapping, the usual for boys our age, the coach getting on our asses to shape up. We would get a lot closer when hanging out, when it was just the two of us and finally that May, we had our first kiss. We were watching Batman for the millionth time, talking about how excited we were that they were making a second one, how awesome it must be to be Bruce Wayne, how hot Vicki Vale was. He asked me "Would you make out with her?" I said "Hell yeah I would!" He asked again "How would you do it?" I though for a minute and hesitantly said "Maybe...like this." I grabbed the imaginary Vicki and made my lips dance wildly. He laughed and said "What about like this?" he did the same but moved his lips slower. We had a good chuckle and turned back to the movie for a minute. We looked at each other for the longest time before leaning and having an actual real kiss. We locked lips for what seemed an eternity, it was so magical and exhilarating.

We had to stop because we could hear his mother coming, she always brought us rice Krispy squares and tang. I think it was all the woman knew how to make. After she left we waited a second before kissing again, it was just as glorious the second time. There was so much going on inside me after I left his house that afternoon, was I gay? Was I straight? Something In-between? I was a ball of emotions and elation. I suspect Peter felt the same, but I wanted to keep our friendship, keep the same feelings that we had for each other. That Monday hanging out after school, we talked in the woods, near our secret spot. We both agreed that we really liked each other and we wanted to keep doing this new, exciting thing. We spent the rest of the afternoon cuddled up to each other, making out and enjoying the ever warming weather. Our secret love, now blossomed that day.

Come June and it's the end of our eighth grade year and we are rolling. Everybody is excited, not so much for the commencement but the big party afterward, the whole rec center would be rented out, just for us. Peter and I and the rest of our friends were making plans, we were going to scope some girls, pull some pranks and enjoy ourselves. Peter and I exchanged a glance and a smirk.  So the big night comes, all us boys loosened our ties and climbed into Daryl's mom's Aerostar and off we went. As soon as we got there, we couldn't wait to be free of the adults and we rushed inside, with Daryl's mom calling after us. As soon as we get in we can hear the music going, laughing and talking, I scan the room and see some kids dancing, a few adult chaperones in the corner smoking and talking.

The evening goes fairly well, lots of punch, talking, dreams of the future, when Jennifer Steele comes up and asks me to dance. Now this was 1991 and girls waited to be asked back then, but not Jennifer Steele, she took what she wanted and knew she could, she has and will always be a spitfire.

All the guys urged me on Peter giving me a smirk and stuck his tongue out, So Jennifer and I danced. November Rain was playing when she asked "You have plans this summer?" I replied "Oh, yeah! Me and the guys are planning a heist." she laughed "Well if you can drag yourself away, would you like to hang out?" I hesitated a moment looking to Peter "I'd like that..." she smiled a bit "Good..." the song ended and we went back to our respective friend groups, the guys giving me slaps on the back, Peter holding back a bit, I offered him a weak smile. The night went a bit longer, some of the kids going home, the adults now sitting and looking at their watches. I don't remember who suggested hide and seek, but as the night wore down it seemed like a good nightcap. Several people thought this was weak and wanted to do something else, but they were overruled.

The adults were beyond caring at this point so we had to do this quick before they changed their minds. Kevin ended up being the seeker for this round, he turned counting to a hundred while we all hid. The rec center was a big ass place, big enough for anyone to get lost in, which looking back was the worst thing to do. As soon as Peter and I made sure we were alone we snuck into a vacant office, giggling we made our way under a desk. We cuddled together as Peter asked me "What did you and Jennifer talk about?" I replied "She was just wanting to hang out, you know, over the summer..." Peter said "That's cool..." I paused a minute "But just as friends, I think..." Peter gave me that classic smile as he leaned in and kissed, it was deep and full. I stopped and asked "Do...think we could...go a little farther? You know if we don't get caught?" He smiled again and nodded yes. We had been at it for what seemed like hours, the hide and seek forgotten, the party forgotten, lost in each other. I thought I heard a scream at some point, but didn't think anything of it. The door to the office suddenly flew open, startling us so we quickly buttoned back up and peeked over the desktop to see who it was.

Stood before us was a man wielding an axe, blood glistening on the blade. My heart started pounding, immediately going into fight or flight. As the man scanned the room we ducked down too late, he advanced and swung the axe down into the desk, where it stuck. Peter and I made a mad dash to get past this guy, slamming the door behind us. We made our way down the hall toward the common room where could still hear the music going. Looking around, the place was empty save for the body in the pool of blood and the overturned table, the snacks mixing with blood. We rushed over to see if we could help, flipping him over, it turned out to be Mr. Williams. He taught history, almost flunked me last semester and was a bit of a rules Nazi, looking down he had a gaping hole in his chest, in the shape of an axe blade, a frozen look of pain on his face. Peter and I ran to the doors, terrified, we grasped at the door handles but the goddamn things were jammed...from the outside.

"Oh shit!" Peter exclaimed, I had to shush him. A crash from the other side of the room sent us both silently running through the opposite hall, heading toward the gym area. We tried to get down the hall quickly without making noise but it was difficult, the darkness here was thick. I tripped, slowing us down and as Peter pulled me up I tried to see what I fell over. In the dimness I could see it was Stacey Nelkin, she sat next to me in English, but her head was wasn't quite where it ought to be. It was sort of...hanging on by a thread, her face contorted in a ghastly grin, her blood blending into the carpet.

Peter pulled me up quickly as we made our way to the gym area, passing doors in the dimness and not absorbing fully what was happening to us. One of the doors cracked as we went by, the familiar face of Daryl greeting me. We burst inside, so glad to see some people who were still alive. I hugged Daryl hard as I saw Ben and Jennifer, they looked worn and ragged, she was nursing a shoulder wound, blood ruining her white ruffle dress. "What the hell happened?" I asked "Some fucking maniac man, after we went off for hide and seek Ben had to take a piss, so he goes off for the restroom and in walks this guy with axes and knives and shit..." he trailed off leaving us in suspense, finally Ben chimed in "He took out Mr. Williams first, just swung his axe square into his chest, everyone stopped in shock.

He collapsed and when he yanked out the axe, the sound it made man..." Daryl, Peter and I exchanged a look with one another. Ben buried his face in his hands "Everyone scattered like roaches, trying to get out. The remaining adults trying to wrangle the rest of us like cats. He must've blocked the doors because nobody could get out..." "What about the phones?" Peter asked. "Dead, man, dead..." Daryl replied. "He got Stacey..." Jennifer piped up "We were running and she tripped and I tried to help, but...this guy he..." She trailed off as Ben put his arm around her.

"Anything we can grab in here to use as a weapon?" I asked. Peter, Daryl and I looked round the small room, finding a few brooms, a pipe and some tools. "We get out of here, we go through the pool area and break a window because it's all glass in there and we run for it." I said. "Are you sure? What if that guy--" Jennifer couldn't finish as Daryl interrupted "He won't, We'll kill that fucker before he can do anything." We set off quietly, checking what little we could see in the dark hallway, the coast being clear we moved as fast and quiet as possible. We reached the gym area, passing weights, dumbells and exercise machines getting close to the pool. As we got closer to the pool, a rythmic sound became apparent, it was wet and squishy and brutal. Daryl and I ventured a peak to see what it was, when it suddenly stopped, leaving us chilled. I cracked the door, looking around the pool room lit up completely, my eyes stopping on the body near one of the windows, blood smattering everything, my stomach nearly lurching at the sight of it. I couldn't make out who it was as I signaled everyone to back up.

The door swung open so hard it hit the wall and shattered the glass pane. The man wielding the axe stepped through, scanning the room, seeing us with our measly makeshift weapons. An evil smile crept across his unshaven face, the bags under his eyes accentuating this evil visage, one filled with rage. He took a big step forward and raised his axe, pointing at every one of us, like he was playing some sick eeny meeny miny moe. He settled on Jennifer, raising the axe further and approaching her, she cowered back while he advanced. All four of us boys saw our moment to strike, it was a combination of our fear, anger and a little bravado to save our friend Jennifer. We jumped forward and gave it everything we had, anything to kill this fucker. He was taken by surprise as we wailed on him, his anger showing  on his contorted face, blow after blow on him. He swung the axe around him, trying to fend us off, we barely moved out of the way so as not to get a face full of axe.

He wheeled around and elbowed Daryl right in the face, sending him down. Swinging the axe, the broad head hit Ben in the leg, an audible snap sending him down in a cry of pain. Peter tried to move but wasn;t fast enough to dodge the axe, the maniac cutting him down the front leaving a gash, which immediately started flowing blood. My eyes widened in terror as I saw my first real love fall to the floor in slow motion, Peter looking dumbstruck. The man turned and raised the axe ready to bring it down on a whimpering Daryl as I finally snapped, quickly looking around and finding the heaviest barbell I could find. I grabbed it and with the widest swing and a cry from deep inside me I brought it against the side of his head. He dropped the axe and fell straight to the floor like a sack of wet shit. He convulsed a little bit as I hit him again for good measure.

I dropped the barbell and ran to Peter, trying to staunch the flow of blood. He squirmed a bit as I put pressure on him wound. Daryl got up to help me as Jennifer crawled to Ben, his leg badly broken. I kept telling Peter to say still and that help was coming, I put pressure on his wound and clutched him tighter. Eventually help did come and the flashing lights were all around the rec center. The rest of that night was a blur, I'm not sure when the police showed up or being loaded into the ambulance with Peter or anybody else. The hospital was so bright and I remember being asked by a doctor if I had any injuries, I was stuck in an exam room and given a once over. They set me down in waiting room while my parents were notified, Daryl came out to sit with me after they set his nose. Eventually all our parents showed up, all of them in a frenzy to see us again. I didn't want to leave until I knew Peter or Daryl or Jennifer were okay. Mr. and Mrs. Adams hugged me and told me it was going to be okay and they would let me know what was happening. My parents took me home, the light of dawn coming up over the hills, the first day of summer vacation. As soon as we got home I climbed up to my room, stripped everything off and collapsed into bed. I had nightmares upon nightmares and didn't wake until late the next day, when I finally stirred and walked downstairs bleary eyed and not entirely with the waking world.

My parents sat at the table "Hey honey, how're you feeling?" my mother asked "Like hell mom, like hell." I replied "You're a champ, Brady" my father said. There was silence for a moment before my mother started "Honey, we got a call From the Adams..." My stomach dropped as I dreaded the news I was going to hear. "Peter is going to be just fine, he's in stable condition, but he's going to be just fine." I was so overjoyed and with all the emotions I felt I broke down in tears. My parents consoled me, pulling me tight to them, after having the worst night of my young life. In the days that followed the details came into the light. There were nine kids and three adults murdered in cold blood, among the dead were Stacey Nelkin, Mr. Williams, Grace Morello and her son Josh, Alex Pixley, Ally Winterson, Jimmy Miles, Alana Conley, Reg Walder, Zach Smith and my friends Mike Wallace and Kevin Thompson.

The man that did it, Harlan Crest, was a janitor at the school who'd been fired a few months before for threatening staff and stalking the female students. They had found a notebook in his house along with his dead mother, her throat slashed open so cleanly that it nearly decaptitated her. He'd planned the murders from the start intending to take more people out, but had fallen behind that night taking care of his mother. Come to find out he had spent a lot of time in and out of institutions  over his life. From endless police interviews to seeing the victims families and reporters sniffing around, it was okay because we had each other and it brought us so much closer together. 

Soon after the families of the victims and our parents got together to bury this whole event, due to our ages, the gruesome nature of the crime and out of respect for the whole town. Which is odd, considering how awful the whole thing was and how devastated everyone was, but it happened.  It was a bummer of a summer, but it was over and we could all heal.

Walking into ninth grade that fall we got the endless "that's them" death stares. Eventually the fervor died down enough to lead a semi-normal existence, we still had awkward interactions, weird notes and the girls throwing themselves at us guys. My parents had the foresight to get me a psychiatrist as did some of the other parents, owing to help our mental health. As those four years flew by Ben and Daryl joined football, Jennifer got on student council, Peter loved drama club and me, well I channeled a lot into creative writing. Peter and I finally got to see Batman Returns when it came out, he loved it, while I liked the first one better. He and I kept our secret love going but I suspect the others knew, but didn't say anything, especially Jennifer, but you could see it in her eyes just a glimmer of disappointment.

And so in 1995 we all graduated, Ben and Daryl got football scholarships, Jennifer had been accepted to Harvard, Peter was going to Washington State and I had been accepted to a writing program in Los Angeles. In the meantime following we all said our goodbyes to each other, we all made a solemn vow to never forget each other and write. The day Peter left we met at our secret spot cuddling up, sharing the last bit of our time together, saying our I love yous.

That was almost 30 years ago, but we made good on our promise. Jennifer became a lawyer, is married and has a daughter, a spitfire liker her mom. Daryl joined the military after college and after he got out he started a veterans organization. Ben moved back to Midvale and started a repair business, I see him every time I go back to visit, we cut up and reminisce, I also visit my special spot in the woods that Peter and I shared. Peter stayed in Washington and is now married with three kids, it's bittersweet as it always is, but I am truly happy for him and happy for the time we spent together. As for me I'm a screenwriter in L.A. with several indie and mid budget pictures under my belt.

I came out as bisexual in 2001 and had a few relationships, but nothing like the one I had with Peter. I was toying with the idea of writing a true story about that night, because who better to write it than someone who lived it. I decided to confer with the others asking if they'd be okay with me doing this, but sadly no one wanted to revisit this event

I kept up on my therapy over the decades, even though I still have recall and the occasional nightmare of running from Harlan Crest and his axe. He's been locked up in a maximum security institution since the night he murdered twelve people. He has to eat through a tube and he can breath okay if you don't unplug him, thanks to my handiwork. Severe brain damage they say, but good riddance to him, I hope they keep hell hot for him. And that's my story, I wish there was more good to tell you, God knows, there's more like mine out there. Take care and stay away from the rec center, it may be remodeled, but the old memories linger.
