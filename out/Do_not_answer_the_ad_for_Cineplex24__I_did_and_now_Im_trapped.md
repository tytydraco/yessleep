I didn’t know what to make of this job when I first took it. It paid too well — which should’ve been my first warning — but I was broke, restless, and desperately in need of something that wasn’t platinum trophy hunting or doomscrolling my life away.

The ad read:

Cinema Host at one of the UK’s only 24-hour cinemas
No experience needed
Night shift only (10pm–6am)
£18 an hour
Apply in person at Cineplex 24 — ask for Mr. Clinton

Seemed perfect. Emphasis on seemed.

It took less than twenty minutes into my first shift for my perception of reality to… warp. That’s the word for it. Twisted, smeared, and bent into something I still don’t fully understand.

No one outside this place would believe me — and frankly, I wouldn’t blame them. But I have to get this out. There’s something wrong with Cineplex 24. Something wrong in ways the human brain isn’t designed to name.

And I fear this job might not just last a lifetime. It might be the thing that takes it.

After finishing college, my life had become a revolving door of Red Bulls, pot noodles, and the cold blue glow of my TV screen. My serotonin was rationed between trophy pings and TikToks. I was bored and numb. The kind of numb that gets mistaken for peace.

Then the ad hit my screen.

It autoplayed, a low-quality YouTube pre-roll. A man in a sharp red suit — like something from a cheap Vegas lounge — pointed directly at me, eyes wild behind a too-big grin.

“YOU. YES, YOU. Jobs are scarce in this little nugget of a world, but do I have an EXCITING OPPORTUNITY for you! Cineplex 24 is hiring NOW! Great pay, great perks, all the popcorn you can stomach! So what are you waiting for? Click the link below, or come down and ask for me, Mr. Clinton!”

Then he dove into a vat of popcorn, surfaced grinning with kernels spilling from his mouth, and gave a thumbs up as the Cineplex 24 logo spun into frame.

I was at the cinema twenty minutes later.

Cineplex 24 is beautiful — too beautiful. Like a caricature of a cinema drawn from childhood nostalgia.

Big glass doors, red neon signage, pristine white light board with black film titles, vintage posters stretching down the side walls. It reminded me a bit of the New Beverly Cinema in LA, where we stopped during a college trip to California. A place that feels curated to be comforting. Too pristine. Too clean. Like it was built from a memory.

I folded my CV (badly) into my back pocket and walked through the glass doors.

Inside: a red carpet lobby with golden detailing. Marble staircases sweeping to either side. In the centre, a glowing concession island with glass cases full of overpriced sugar. Little themed buckets. Limited edition cups.

And behind it, a man elbow-deep in the guts of a slush machine.

“Hey, buddy,” I said. “I’m here about the job? Mr. Clinton around?”

The man jerked, startled. His head popped out of the machine — curly brown hair, thick black-rimmed glasses, and a moustache that looked like it was drawn on in biro.

He squinted at me. “Mate, I’ve told you. Your friend’s not here. Stop saying he was killed. We both know there was no evidence, no body, and—”

He paused.

“Wait. You’re not the bloke looking for Rob, are you?”

I blinked. “Uh… no. I’m asking about the job.”

He muttered something under his breath — I caught the words “stupid Nick, not supposed to mention the death” — then slapped his own forehead with a pathetic little whap.

“Oh. Right. Mr. Clinton? He’s in the office. Over there, by the stairs.”

And with that, he returned to the slush machine and began to sob into it.

I didn’t ask. I just walked away.
The office door was already ajar.

“YES! Yes, come in!” boomed a voice before I’d even knocked.

Inside was the man from the advert, though… off somehow. He looked like someone had tried to recreate Danny DeVito from memory. His nose looked freshly broken. He now had an extravagant, curled moustache. No glasses. Too many teeth.

He waved me in, gesturing to a chair with exaggerated flair.

“Ahhh, there you are! Sit, sit! You’re here for the job, yes? The night shift?”

“Yes, Mr. Clinton. I—”

I pulled out my CV, but he snatched it mid-sentence, skimmed it for half a second, then crumpled it into a ball and hooked it into the bin like a basketball pro.

“No need for that nonsense,” he grinned. “I want to know you. Not what some paper says about you.”

He gripped my shoulders. Firm. Too firm.

“Now then. Tell me — favourite film. Has to be before you were born.”

“Uh… Reservoir Dogs?”

He leaned in. Inches from my face. I could smell popcorn and something coppery.

“I bloody love a bit of Tarantino,” he whispered, eyes wide with a little glint of madness.

He stepped back and rifled through a drawer, pulling out a thick file.

“So, Will — do you like the place?”

My name isn’t Will. Never has been.

But I said, “Yeah, it’s great. I love the—”

“SMASHING, Will! You’re hired!”

He handed me the file.

“You start tomorrow. Eleven sharp. Use the back door. Never the front after 11pm. Ash, our other night employee, will let you in.”

He ushered me toward the exit, clapping me on the back.

“Oh, and if that deranged man is outside again, do not — and I mean do not — speak to him. He’s… lost. And the police are sniffing around about some Robert fellow again, so I need to make a few calls…”

The door slammed behind me with a loud CLACK. Then came the bolt. Then the chain. A series of locks. Too many locks.

I stood in the lobby with the file in my hands, trying to process what the hell had just happened.
The file seemed standard at first — health and safety sheets, emergency contacts, all the usual corporate nonsense.

But near the back, nestled between photocopied training sheets, was a single white page in bright red ink:

FOR NIGHT WORKER EYES ONLY

The first page looked handwritten. Sloppy. Panicked.


To the poor unfortunate soul who’s got the pleasure of working with me…
Welcome.
The job isn’t what you think, so here are some rules you’d do well to follow if you want to keep your bones inside your skin.



Then came the list. Typed exactly as written:




Screen 14 doesn’t exist. If anyone asks for it, take their money. They’ll find their way.
At 2:57am, a man in a green coat will appear in the lobby. Don’t acknowledge him. Leave a small popcorn on the counter. He’ll leave at 3:00.
Lobby speakers don’t work. If you hear static, turn off all lights and hide beneath the concession cabinets. Stay quiet. This usually lasts 90 seconds. Usually.
If you hear someone calling from Screen 2 between 12–1am, ignore it. No matter the voice. Do. Not. Enter.
If a customer asks for a film that doesn’t exist, issue them a ticket to Screen 5. Do not engage in conversation.
The emergency exit upstairs isn’t real. Never open it.
If you see yourself walk through the lobby doors, run out the back. Immediately. Your co-worker will know what to do.




That’s all I have for now. Sadly, that’s not all there is.
Stick to the rules. Keep your head. And maybe, just maybe, you’ll survive long enough to regret it.

Good luck.
—Ash



I laughed. Genuinely laughed.

I figured it was just hazing. A spooky little initiation to mess with the new guy. I was actually looking forward to meeting Ash. They clearly had a sick sense of humour.

But even then — buried somewhere beneath the disbelief and sarcasm — was a quiet, flickering instinct.

I should take this seriously.


I turned up for my first shift at 10:58pm, standing in the pissing rain behind the back entrance of Cineplex 24, holding the folder like it was going to protect me from the cold — or the creeping sense that I’d made a terrible mistake.

I almost left. I really did.

Then the steel door swung open.

A figure stood there in the uniform: red trousers, waistcoat, crisp white shirt. Not what I expected. Definitely not unpleasant.

Short, thick black hair streaked with blue. Tattoo sleeves that spiralled with chaotic stories — snakes, pocket watches, fragments of eyes and flames. Piercings glinting beneath the flickering back-alley light.

“You’re the new guy,” they said, stepping aside. “Come in.”

Their voice was low and half-asleep, the kind that’s spent years staying up too late. I was ushered into a tiny concrete room barely wider than a hallway. Ash — that had to be them — pointed to an old metal scanner beside the wall.

I pulled out my ticket:

Admit One – Cineplex 24
Film: NIGHT SHIFT
Starring: [My Name]

Slid it through.

A mechanical ka-chunk sounded from somewhere behind the wall. I wasn’t sure if that was the scanner or something… 
Ash gave me the world’s most apathetic tour.

They explained the tills. The break room. The broom cupboard that “might be bigger inside depending on the time.” The popcorn machine had a dent in it — apparently from someone trying to attack it when it “started crawling.”

Everything was accompanied by a shrug or a “meh.” Like they were describing a particularly disappointing Tesco shift, not a place with seven paranormal workplace safety rules.

We were halfway through counting change when the lobby speakers behind us clicked.

Not the usual soft click. This was sharp, unnatural — like someone slapping two bits of bone together.

Ash froze.

“Oh f— not now,” they whispered.

I laughed. “What, is this the part where you try and scare the new guy?”

I didn’t finish the sentence.

Ash shoved me to the floor, killed the lobby lights with one swift flick, and dragged me under the concession stand.

I opened my mouth again, but Ash slapped a hand over it.

“Shh,” they hissed.

And then it began.
The speakers didn’t play music. Not exactly. It was like someone had tried to reconstruct a lullaby from broken instruments. Warped piano. Screaming violin. A trumpet gasping its final breath.

Then came the THUDS.

Heavy. Rhythmic. Dull, wet, and impossibly close.

The sound of something that shouldn’t have legs but does. Something that puts its whole body into every step. Floorboards cracked. Glass rattled. I could feel it — not just hear it.

Then… sniffing.

Not a person. Not even a dog. This was something feral and broken, dragging long, rattling sniffs across the air like it was trying to peel my scent off my skin.

Then the groan.

I wish I could explain it properly. Imagine a wolf howling underwater while someone shoves a straw into its lungs and stirs. That kind of sound. Half-voice, half-choke.

I was shaking. Not metaphorically. My teeth clicked. I held my breath so hard my chest burned. I didn’t know whether to scream or cry, so I did neither.

The thuds moved on. Eventually.

The speakers fell silent.

Ash stood, dusted themselves off, and nudged me with a boot.

“Up you get. It’s gone.”

I scrambled upright.

“What the fuck was that?” I gasped. “That was… that wasn’t real, right? That wasn’t—”

Ash, somehow already back to casual, shrugged. “That’s the Beast. It’s the only one that’s really dangerous, far as I know that comes out of there, I mean the grey lady keeps fucking with my displays … bitch ”

They moved back to the till like they hadn’t just faced the embodiment of fear.

“Thing crawls out of Screen 10 most nights. We close it at nine, but the movie still plays. Nobody knows what film. No one asks.”

I was hyperventilating. I sat next to the popcorn machine and just… broke a little. My limbs stopped listening to me. I stared at the floor and tried not to throw up.

Ash tossed me a handful of popcorn and squatted down beside me, sipping a Monster from a cracked can.

“Happens to everyone on shift one,” they said, mouth full. “Congrats. You survived.”
Once I stopped shaking, I asked Ash what would’ve happened if I hadn’t followed the rule.

“What if I’d turned on the lights? Or… or ran? Or looked at it?”

Ash scrolled through their phone and said nothing.

Then they turned the screen to me.

I immediately vomited in the bin.

It took me a moment to understand what I was looking at.

It was a person — or it had been. Wearing the Cineplex uniform. But their body had collapsed like someone removed every bone and cartilage and filled them with soup. The arms were just meat sacks. The head was a sagging balloon. A big wet meat pile.

Ash spoke softly. “That was Rob. Didn’t take the rules seriously.”

I wiped my mouth.

“Why the hell do you have that on your phone?”

Ash shrugged. “Morbid curiosity. Also proof. Helps newbies believe me when I say this place is not fucking around.”
After that, everything felt… still.

Like we were in the eye of a storm.

Customers came and went. Some were normal. Some were clearly not. 
By 2:55am, I was beginning to relax.

By 2:57am, I wanted to climb inside the popcorn machine and die.

The lobby temperature dropped five degrees in an instant. The air turned syrup-thick. My spine began to tingle before I even saw him.

A man in a green coat stepped through the front doors.

He didn’t walk. He… slid.

Like the world was moving around him.

He glided to the centre of the lobby and stood still. Head down. Hands loose at his sides. Ash had written not to look directly, but I couldn’t help it — just a little peek from the corner of my eye.

His shoes made a shrill squeak as he drifted forward.

I grabbed a small popcorn from the warmer, placed it on the counter, and left it there. Then I stepped back, heart pounding so hard it felt like it was trying to burst out of my throat.

He arrived at the glass counter. Slowly. No footsteps. Just the sound of friction.

And then he whispered.

His voice wasn’t loud. But it didn’t need to be.

It sounded like a violin string being dragged across barbed wire.

“Number 97. Blue curtains. White door with glass panel. Broken fence. Little dog. Soon.”



To anyone else this would just be random words but he was describing my house.
Down to the cracked panel in the garden gate.

The man picked up the popcorn. And disappeared. Not walked out. Not faded. Just — gone.

I stood there sweating, staring at the empty spot where he’d been, and finally managed to move.

I ran. Straight to the staff room.
Ash was on the staff room sofa, feet up, watching TikTok.

“Let me guess,” they said, eyes still on the screen. “Green coat?”

“How the hell did it know where I live?” I shouted.

Ash smiled.

“Yeah, it likes to test the newbies. Get under your skin. If you talk to it, though — or look at it full-on — you’re done. So, hey. Congrats. You passed.”

“Passed?”

“What would’ve happened if I didn’t?” I asked, voice shaking.

Ash tossed their feet to the floor, then pulled up another photo. Another meat puddle. Another face barely recognisable almost as if they’d been stepped on by an elephant.

“Blob man,” they said, deadpan. “The sequel.”
I asked Ash how they were so unfazed by all of this. How they hadn’t gone completely mad.

Ash cracked their knuckles. Their eyes went dark for a moment. Sad.

“My dad’s Mr. Clinton. And the cinema… it’s kind of a family business. After his partner died I … well stepped in to help”

I opened my mouth to ask more, but Ash shook their head.

“I don’t wanna talk about it. You’re doing fine. Go take your break. Seriously — take a couple of hours.”

I didn’t argue. I needed to breathe. Or sleep. Or die.

I walked to the table in the corner.

Sat in the chair laying my head on the table.

And the world… shifted.

The break room wasn’t where I’d left it.

When I closed my eyes, I was sitting in a freezing little staff lounge with cracked leather sofas and a vending machine that only dispensed Root Beer or static.

When I opened them again, I was in a café.

Not just a café — an eerie copy of a café I knew all to well . The one my grandparents used to take me to on Sunday mornings. Pepper’s Café, I think it was called. Torn from the 70s. Cream walls, wooden booths, red checkerboard tablecloths, the smell of warm butter and burnt bacon.

Behind the counter stood a man in a paper hat and apron, humming as he polished a ceramic mug.

He noticed me, beamed, and said: “Morning, bud! Fancy a nice hot cup of Joe to perk you up?”

“Erm… yeah. Thank you. That’s very kind.”

He poured me a cup, steam curling up into the fluorescent lights above. I took a sip — and I swear to god, it was the best cup of coffee I’ve ever had. Rich. Dark. A little sweet. Like the smell of safety.

“What is this place?” I asked, looking around.

The man — short, balding, deeply kind eyes — did a small spin and flung his arms wide.

“This, my boy, is George’s Café!”

I blinked. “And… you’re George?”

“Damn right I am!”

He sat down across from me, folded his hands, and smiled like a granddad about to explain where babies come from.

“Now listen. I know what’s out there. All of it. This place — it’s a pocket. A little corner of the Cineplex carved out by a man named Alphonse.”

“Alphonse?”

George nodded.

“gone now... But before that — before it all went too far — he made this place. A safe space. For the staff , curated to their own feeling of safety”
I felt a weight pressing against my chest. The kind that tells you this peace is only temporary.

I stood, thanked him quietly, and walked toward the exit I hadn’t seen before — now a frosted glass door marked “LOBBY.”

Before I opened it, George said softly:

“Be careful, lad.”

Ash was standing in the lobby, staring through the glass front doors as sunlight began to leak across the car park.

“Beautiful, isn’t it?” they said.

“What is?”

“How a place full of monsters can still make something this golden.”

The light hit their face in such a way that, for a moment, I saw just how tired they were.

“Ash,” I started. “I don’t think I can keep doing this.”

They turned sharply. Grabbed my shoulders.

“Don’t say that,” they whispered. “Not even out loud.”

“What? Why not? I’ve seen things that shouldn’t exist. I’ve had my house described by something with no face.”
Ash shook their head violently. “You don’t get it. You can’t say you want to leave. If it hears you — it’ll take that as rejection.”Ash’s eyes darkened. Their grip tightened.

“I don’t know what it is. No one does. But I’ve seen what happens when someone quits. It doesn’t let them go. Not cleanly. Not fully. You’re tied to this place now. Only two ways out: permission… or death.”

“Permission from what?”

Silence.

Ash looked away.

“Take your pay. Rest. Come back tomorrow.”
I slumped against the wall, numb and shaking.

Ash, trying to lighten the mood, laughed a little.

“Hey — at least the pay’s good, right?”

I snorted. “£18 an hour to get psychologically shredded? Yeah, a bargain.”

Ash blinked. “£18?”

“Yeah… the job ad—”

“No, no, no. You’re not getting £18.” Ash looked genuinely confused.

“You’re on the night rate. You get £180 an hour.”

I just stared at them.

“Wait, what?”

“Yeah. That’s why most of the others stay , or , stayed.” 
I was in utter shock and disbelief, maybe I could stick it out for the immense amount of money on the line. 
6:00am hit. The staff scanner beeped me out.

The morning shift passed us in the hallway as I left. They looked clean. Normal. Confused as to why I was pale and twitching and covered in popcorn.

Ash climbed the steps above the lobby to the flat above the cinema.

They shouted down to me:

“Hey! You survived day one! Better than the last few.”

Then they shut the door behind them.
I slept 12 hours that day. Didn’t dream. Or maybe I did and just don’t remember.

The next two nights? Oddly… uneventful.

Nothing violent. Just weird.

The popcorn machine got up and walked away. Came back 20 minutes later like nothing happened.
The film posters all changed overnight to advertise a movie called The Hunter’s Beartrap. No one’s heard of it. But every customer who bought a ticket for it seemed… satisfied. I think they were customers. I think they were people.


I don’t feel the same fear I did that first night. It’s like my nervous system gave up trying.

But the rules still hold. The dread still bubbles. And the money is still flooding in.

And that’s the scariest part.

Because I don’t think I want to leave anymore. I can’t. But to anyone reading this please take it as a warning not to answer the ad , I’m on too deep now. I’ll try to keep you all updated when I can but for now , I’m signing off.
