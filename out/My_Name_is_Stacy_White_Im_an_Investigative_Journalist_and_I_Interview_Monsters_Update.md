When I next met with Molly it was with extreme reluctance. Apparently my article had resonated well with the audiences and they were morbidly curious for more. As such my boss had sent me back. She sat just as arrow straight and emotionless as last time. 

“Good Morning.” She greeted me pleasantly, almost as if we were friends. 

“Yes..” I answered minimally as I set up my equipment. 

“Did it negatively affect your morality last time? To hear of my masters and their world?” She asked curiously. 

“It.. Surprised me..” I answered diplomatically. 

“I understand. What is it that you would like to know about this time?”

“How did the child, Eric, destroy your supply chain?” I asked straightforwardly. 

Molly took a deep breath in, as if it was some effort for her to continue this time, then she began, “The boy was permitted to join in the day classes with the girls after he beat Radomir, however this brought with it new problems. Aside from the disciplinary issues, it quickly became apparent that Eric was not the same level as the others. Out of ten he ranked 7th. When the three girls below him defaulted to the meat farm, he became the bottom of the class. 

On the day of their 22nd exam, I was working with Nathaniel on another matter when he was called to the infirmary. When we arrived Eric was lying on his side curled up on one of the sterile hospital beds in a medical robe. Beside him Doctor Markos Behrend was writing on a chart. He was one of them, just the same as Nathaniel or Master, however was a couple years older than the brothers. He had strawberry blonde hair and lavender eyes. 

‘Nathaniel.’ The Doctor greeted him with a humble bow despite the fact that they had been friends for many decades, ‘I thought you would want to be the one to make the decision on this case?’ 

‘Indeed, what is the damage?’ Nathaniel asked calmly, though looking at him I could tell he was tense. He stood just a little more rigid in the same way Master did when he was stressed. 

‘It seems the boy failed the 22nd test. He fell from near the top, when I heard I had expected that he would need to be scraped off the ground, however it seems he survived, though his injuries are considerable.’ Markos began cheerfully, ‘Internal bleeding, multiple broken ribs, broken wrist and fractured leg. It would be my recommendation that he should be euthanized.’

Hearing this Nathaniel ignored the man, moving instead to crouch beside the bed, ‘Eric, look at me.’ He spoke with a softness that was nauseating and the child rolled over to face him, he was pale with pain. His injuries were plain to see, no bandages or otherwise had been placed. ‘Can you tell me what happened?’ He prompted 

‘I fell..’ Eric whispered ashamedly, ‘I couldn’t keep up.. they all moved too fast..’ 

‘Was it because of your leg?’ 

‘..Yes.. I’m sorry.. I’ll do better..’ It was strange to hear a child apologize for it implied that forgiveness could be given.

‘Are you in pain?’ 

The boy nodded.

‘Good. Then next time, I expect you won’t fall.’ He said calmly before returning his attention to Markos, ‘There’s no need for euthanasia, his spirit isn’t broken.’

‘As you wish.’ The doctor agreed, ‘With respect, I should inform you I am forbidden from using any medicines on him specifically. He will receive no pain relief or other treatment and I have doubts that he will last long without it.’ 

‘Orders from my brother is it?’ He sighed and Markos nodded in confirmation, ‘I see, no matter. Eric, will you sit up for me?’ He requested. 

It took a moment but the child obliged, sitting up with some effort to swing his legs over the edge of the bed. This was the first time I had seen his left leg without the bracing and it was disturbing. Sickly thin with sunken muscles and more twisted than it should have been. It was also heavily bruised, I assumed it was the one that had broken. 

‘I’m going to give you a gift. Do you think you can withstand a little more pain for a moment?’ Nathaniel asked curiously. 

‘I’m fine.” Eric responded stubbornly. I don’t believe he understood exactly how much gifts hurt when bestowed.

The man looked bemused, ‘Very well. Hold your gown out of the way.’ He instructed and Eric hesitantly rolled it up to his hip on one side, exposing the full length of his damaged leg. Nathaniel seemed to examine the disfigurement for a moment before activating his magic. Ordinarily their energy is not something we can see, however, when it is particularly concentrated it becomes visible. As such, his eyes glowed and blue sparks crackled in the air around Nathaniel’s hand as he placed it over the wasted muscle, moving it downward from there past his knee to his ankle. 

There was a moment of awed silence before the child screamed and began to writhe in agony. He was clearly not prepared. His skin boiled, blistering from within as the magic burned through his leg and blackened symbols seared themselves down the length of it where Nathaniel had touched. I had never before seen one of them use their magic in this way. The marks left were a combination of interconnected circles, crescents and what I can only describe as stars arranged in a neat line.  

When they were done forming, the bruising around the break faded and the muscle began to fill out. Even the bruising on his wrist disappeared and I realized then that Nathaniel had healed him entirely, ‘Your brother wouldn’t approve of that,’ Markos warned, though the mischievous gleam in his eye signified that he did. He had always preferred Nathaniel to Master. 

‘Perhaps not.’ Nathaniel agreed, though turned his attention back to the child as he began to recover from the shock and sit up, his brow slick with sweat, ‘Why don’t you try standing?’ 

Eric looked suspicious but optimistic, following the instruction without saying anything more. His first steps were tentative, as if he didn’t fully trust it. 

‘Well?’ The man prompted. 

‘I.. can walk.’ Eric stumbled, barely containing his excitement, ‘Thank you!’ He said with such an intense appreciation that it made both monsters visibly uncomfortable as they looked between each other. 

‘Don’t thank me. There are limitations-’ Nathaniel started mildly embarrassed but stopped mid sentence when Eric suddenly hugged him. 

‘I don’t care. Thank you.’ The boy repeated. 

At this situation Markos appeared to be distinctly amused while Nathaniel remained frozen, looking utterly shocked. He seemed to have no concept of how to return the gesture, ‘Yes. Right. Well… *Release me.*’ He used a command and Eric obediently stepped back, ‘As I was saying, child, there are limitations. You may not use it all the time, the more you use it the faster you will burn through the magic sustaining it. If it runs out you will revert back to how you were until it recharges enough to continue.’ He explained. 

‘How long does it take to recharge..?’ Eric asked now. 

‘Depends on how depleted you allow it to get.’ Nathaniel shrugged, ‘I would suggest exploring the limitations before taking the 22nd test again. If you fail a second time, there won’t be a third.’ 

Bestowing that gift was perhaps the second biggest mistake Nathaniel ever made. The boy learned to use his gift only when required and it seemed to me that for the majority of the time he used it minimally. Only enough so that he could walk with the assistance of a cane rather than the leg braces and under  Nathaniel’s continued guidance he was becoming regrettably formidable. 

By the time he was a teenager he was outrightly dangerous. He excelled in his classes with the girls and was soon ranked third among them, the only two who opposed him were Calla and Loree. However as he approached maturity a new problem arose. ’It is time now brother, you *must* destroy him. I have allowed you to indulge whatever interest it is that has consumed you these past years, but that is to end. He is causing problems among the girls.’ Master pleaded with his brother to see reason.

Nathaniel sighed, ‘He is not interested in the girls, and his benefits far outweigh the risks.’ 

‘How do you know he holds no interest in the girls? Humans are extremely hormonal.’ 

‘Because I just *know* brother, trust me. His interests lay elsewhere.’ Nathaniel insisted, exasperated. 

‘And what of the effect he has on them?’ Master demanded. 

‘What of it? I will not punish the boy for things he cannot control!’ 

‘You are blinded by your affections for him.’ My master scoffed. 

‘And you are blinded by your own ignorance. He has never disobeyed any request I have made of him, I don’t even need to use glamours. He has brought us back hundreds of children, he understands how to talk to them. He makes them feel safe. Do you not remember just last week, he brought home an entire bus of them! Tabloids are publishing it as a mysterious disappearance, they have no leads. He left no traces at all! He is far better at it than any other has ever been, I told you it would work.’ His brother responded. 

‘I am not denying that he has served his purpose, I’m saying he is getting too old! What will you do when he asks where the children he brings home are? When he asks how they are doing and why he never sees them?!’ 

‘I will tell him the same thing I have *always* told him, that once he has rescued them they are taken to Sweden and re-homed.’  

‘How long do you expect him to believe that? He’s too clever Nathaniel! You should see the way he watches me, blue eyes of a devil.’ Master muttered.

At this Nathaniel laughed, ‘He watches you with conjecture because he can sense your loathing. If you would spend some time with him you would see his company is quite pleasant.’  

‘I will never understand your fascination with him.’ Master shook his head. 

‘That’s because you lack vision, you never look toward the future. When mother and father arrive I intend to show them Eric and how well he has been trained. You should hope that they don’t change their minds on the succession.’ Nathaniel mused, he had never previously expressed an interest in the inheritance, so I was sure that he was only teasing. Though Master didn’t seem impressed. 

‘If you will not control him, I will.’ He warned but Nathaniel dismissed him. 

‘He is perfectly under control.’ His brother stated nonchalantly.

That was one of the many arguments the brothers would have over Eric Linnaeus, yet each time Nathaniel remained unyielding.

I passed by Eric that day in the hallways. He was now full grown and taller than I and I could see why his presence disrupted the other pets. He was young and handsome, his dark hair framed his face and his eyes were a deep blue. Though he wore no expression he didn’t seem unkind, you see being fed on monster’s foods enhances features you already have. Eyes, lips, hair, your skin no longer scars when cut and so on.

‘Molly, have you seen Nathaniel?’ He asked, his voice was like velvet, it was disturbing. 

‘He is in a meeting with Master.’ I informed him and it was only then that I noticed he had children with him. Two little girls no older than six or seven stood nervously hiding shyly behind his legs. They were thin and covered in dirt, they looked like they may have been living on the streets. When I looked at them they shrank back, as I said, children are unsettled by me. 

‘It’s okay, she won’t hurt you, this is Molly.’ He assured them softly. 

‘How much longer until we’re there..?’ The taller of the children asked. 

‘Not much longer, I have to take you to Nathaniel, we can get you something to eat and he will help you I promise.’ 

It’s not often that I feel as though I could laugh, but hearing Eric speak with such unawareness to the truth was entertaining. It pleased me to know that the masters *both* trusted me more than they did him. Even for all Nathaniel’s fawning, he didn’t trust Eric to accept him the way *I* accepted them.” Molly paused there, and I saw for the first time a smile on her lips. 

“Your ‘masters’ are evil.” I commented flatly. 

“Evil?” She mused, “Are lions ‘evil’ for eating buffalo? Are humans ‘evil’ for eating cattle? It’s simply a part of life. All things must eat.” She corrected me. 

“Not all things eat babies.” I stated bluntly, though she ignored me this time as she continued instead. 

“Sometime after my Master sent me to collect Eric from the day classes. When I arrived the teenagers were in the middle of sparring, Eric was facing Calla and she had disarmed him, she held the tip of her sword to the artery in his thigh without applying any pressure. 

‘You have lost.’ She announced though he seemed annoyed by this statement. 

‘Do you always have to aim for my leg?’ He demanded. 

‘Of course. It’s your weakness, learn to defend it better.’ She said simply, finally lowering her weapon. 

Eric paused a moment then and I thought he might try to catch her in a surprise attack, however he instead asked, ‘..You’re better than I am.. So.. How would you defend better if you were me?’ 

This did indeed catch the girl by surprise and her cheeks flushed, ‘I would just.. Not make it so obvious. I’ve seen you use it sometimes, why don’t you just use it all the time?’ She asked as she offered him her hand to help him up. 

‘I can’t.’ He sighed, accepting her assistance and reaching for his cane as he stood, ‘I’ll wear it out too quickly for no good reason. It’s not worth using in training..’ He trailed off as he saw me approach. 

‘Eric, please come with me, Master wishes to have an audience with you.’ I announced. 

In response he narrowed his eyes, ‘Why? Does Nathaniel know?’ 

‘It was Nathaniel’s idea.’ I lied without hesitation.

‘Fine.’ He agreed. 

We walked in silence and he followed me through the hallways to Master’s office. He was waiting for us and I stood to the side of the room while he gestured for Eric to sit, he didn’t. 

‘Hello Orphan.’ He began. 

‘What is it that you want …. ?’ Eric spoke my master’s name without any reservations, it was a sign of disrespect. 

‘I see my brother failed to teach you manners.’ Master smiled tightly, ‘I requested you here in hopes that you might agree to a contract with me.’

The boy seemed caught off guard, ‘There’s nothing you could offer me that I want.’ He stated. 

‘Oh? Come now, everyone has something that they want. I will grant you anything, name a price, and in return I should like you to become my property. I would have you contracted so that you may only obey my command, my brother nor anyone else would have the power to glamour you.’ 

’Nathaniel doesn’t need to use those on me and I refuse to allow others to do so.’ Eric was overconfident. 

‘*Sit*.’ Master commanded him and he sat back heavily in his seat as the order compelled him, ‘*Stand*.’ 

‘Stop it.’ He snapped as he unwillingly followed the instructions. 

‘Why? I thought you said you could resist?’ My master mused. 

‘You’re using more force than others do.’ He muttered. 

‘Well of course, I know you are strong willed. And others will figure that out as well. Do you really want to be at the mercy of whatever anyone asks you to do?’ 

‘..No..’ he admitted honestly.

‘Then make the contract.’ 

‘With you? Also no.’ Eric stated defiantly. 

Master looked annoyed this time, it wasn’t often that people denied him what he wanted, ‘Let me put this another way. Make the contract with me, or I’ll return you to Nathaniel in pieces.’ 

‘This conversation is over.’ Eric announced, moving to leave. Master allowed him to reach the door before giving another command. 

’*Stop*.’ He said simply and the boy froze in place, ‘That knife on your belt is nice. Did Nathaniel give it to you? *Answer me*.” 

‘Yes.’ He responded bitterly through teeth. 

‘Wonderful! Should I command you to take your own eye out with it?’ Master asked casually. 

Now Eric appeared nervous, ‘I would rather you did not.’ 

‘I’m sure my brother would rather I didn’t as well.’ He deliberated a moment, then shrugged, ‘But, he’s not here and I would love to know just how strong you are when it Really matters. So, Eric. *I order you to take your eye out. Just the eye though. Don’t want you damaging anything else*.’ 

Eric’s expression flickered between shock and spite before settling on concentration as he fought to resist the command. It was foolish to even try. His entire body trembled with the effort yet he still took the knife and directed the tip of the blade at his right eye, ‘Retract the command.’ He hissed, sweat beading on his brow as he used all his will power to hold the knife back. 

Master sat forward slightly, ‘Interesting.’ He mused, I’m sure he hadn’t expected any resistance at all. 

‘Master forgive me.. Is this wise?’ I asked quietly. It’s not that I minded that he would injure himself, it was more that I understood Nathaniel would be less than pleased.

‘Wise? No, but, I think it’s going to be worth it anyway.’ He smiled as Eric began to scream, the blade slowly driving it’s way into his eye against his will. Blood spilled out down his face, the whole ordeal took longer than I would have expected, I suppose Eric fought it the entire time. When it was done my master sat back. 

‘I suppose not strong enough to resist then,’ he sounded amused, ‘That’s good. Now, *take your eye, and hand it to my brother. Go quickly*, don’t want to keep him waiting.’ He smiled. 

This time Eric offered no opposition to the direction. I thought that without the instruction he may not have been able to move at all, he seemed close to losing consciousness. I can only imagine the horrified expression on Nathaniel’s face when Eric walked into his office, blood trailing down his face, knife in one hand and his own eye in the other. I wondered if it would upset him to be handed one of the eyes he always claimed to admire so much. 

‘Molly, *see that he makes it there*, he seems unsteady.’ Master ordered me and I moved to follow after the boy. It was apparent that when he told Eric to go quickly he had. So by the time I caught up with him he had already entered Nathaniel’s office and I struggled to find a way in without being seen. There’s no point in my gift if I cannot get into the room to begin with. I managed to find a vantage point beside a window on the roof, though the curtains were drawn I could hear through the glass well enough. 

‘-Is that all?’ Nathaniel was speaking calmly. 

There was a long pause, ‘Yes, that’s all.’ Eric responded.

‘And you do agree to the terms?’ 

‘Yes. I will obey any order you give me without fail so long as I hear it. I will never tell you a lie. I will never use the weapon that you have granted me against you and I will live for as long as your lifespan. I accept these conditions.’ Eric replied in monotone.

‘As a final condition, from the first time you choose to use it, you will never again be able to return it to a human state. You will have to live with it forever, do you understand?’, It almost sounded as if he was trying to dissuade the boy. 

‘I do.’ He answered calmly. 

There was another moment of silence before Nathaniel answered, ‘Very well…’ he agreed exhausted. 

When I next saw Eric it was some months later. Winter had set in and snow was piled on the ground. Other servants were clearing the pathways when the court yard doors opened and Eric returned. Spots of snow decorated his dark hair and he wore a thick jacket with a knitted scarf. Beside him was a small human family, a woman and her three children who looked around the area in awe as Nathaniel, Markos and Calla approached them.

Calla had been assigned to Markos and Eric to Nathaniel once their training had completed.” She explained briefly then continued, “Markos and Calla led the family away while Nathaniel remained with Eric. 

‘You did well.’ He praised, though there was no true emotion behind the words as he tilted Eric’s chin up to look at him.

‘There are so many this year.. I don’t know that we’ll have room for them all..’ Eric murmured, averting his gaze.

Nathaniel seemed entertained, ’Let me worry about that, we have provisions enough.’ he assured.

I didn’t hear the rest of their conversation for my master approached. He came to stand by my side in the shadows and patted down the length of my hair slowly as he spoke, ‘It seems that my brother has decided to ignore my warning.’ He mused.

‘That appears to be the case.’ I agreed obediently, briefly returning my attention to the pair of them to see that they were now headed inside.  

‘*When an opportunity arises, take the orphan into the sub levels. Show him what’s kept down there.*’ Master whispered the order in my ear and I nodded. 

From then I spent my days paying even closer attention to the orphan than I already did and hoping for the chance to fulfill the command I had been given. It’s.. Somewhat uncomfortable to be under an order that lasts any extended length of time. It consumes your thoughts and makes it difficult to focus on anything else, it’s a permanent state of *waiting*. 

Eric was almost never alone, if he wasn’t with Nathaniel, he was with Calla and if he wasn’t with her, he was out collecting children. Fortunately I caught a break when he separated from his master one night after dinner. I fell into pace with him and he stopped, ‘Orphan, there’s something I need to show you.’ I stated politely. 

‘Not interested.’ He responded flatly. 

‘Your Master wants me to show you something.’ I lied. 

At this the boy snorted, ‘He’s not my ‘master’ and if he wanted to show me something, he wouldn’t send *you*.’ He stated bluntly, moving to leave the area. He was irritating.

‘Nathaniel is hiding something from you.’ I told him finally. 

This caused him to pause, ‘No he’s not?’ 

‘He is.’ I said honestly, ‘I can show you what it is.’ 

Eric hesitated still, he seemed to be thinking through his options, ‘What is it?’ He asked at last. 

I shook my head, ‘I can’t explain. It must be seen.’ I could see him weighing up his curiosity against his distrust. 

‘How long will it take?’ He asked eventually.

‘Not long, we can go right now. It won’t move.’ I could feel the order loosening, he was going to accept. 

‘Okay.’ He agreed and I began to lead him toward the sub levels. 

You know when you have reached them because the hallways become like a maze. It’s difficult to navigate and it feels as though the room is spinning. If you don’t know which direction to take you may easily become lost. ‘Keep up.’ I instructed as I noticed Eric was starting to slow. 

‘This is the sub level. Nathaniel said I shouldn’t come here..’ He said uncertainty. 

‘He says that because he doesn’t want you to see. That’s what the definition of hiding something is.’ 

He looked displeased at my explanation but continued on. We stopped when we reached the stairs, they led down to a heavy wooden door, gargoyles sat atop the banisters and I made my way down without hesitation, though Eric followed more cautiously, ‘How much further?’ He asked. 

’Not far.’ I reassured as I opened the door way into the room beyond.

‘It’s.. Just the kitchens.’ He said relieved. 

‘Yes.’ 

‘So what of them? They eat tons of meat. They have to prepare it somewhere.’ He stated annoyed.

‘This isn’t what you’re here to see.’ I mused, gesturing for him to follow. 

I opened the next door and allowed him to step through into the processing room. It was a good time to visit, the production line was just commencing. If we had arrived later in the day the meat would have already been largely processed and barely recognisable, however at the beginning there is no mistaking what it is for the corpses are still quite whole.

The machinery hummed and clanked in rhythmic timing as the operation began. The bodies entered from the right, freshly slaughtered and hung upside-down to allow the blood to drain out before they moved through the skinner. Once the skin was removed, workers removed the head, hands and feet, as well as any other unsavory appendages. They were then sent on to be quartered, the choice cuts were separated and de-boned. The offal is thrown into a crusher to be ground and the whole area gets washed down before the next batch is sent in. 

I wondered if Eric was able to identify the children from the family he had collected in the days prior, or the little girls from the months before. Not all livestock is processed immediately, there is no meat on a starved body and they must be made plump first, or sometimes the masters simply wish them to grow somewhat before slaughter.

His breathing became shallow, he stepped back until he hit the wall and slid down it slowly. He seemed to be in a state of disbelief, he was quivering and tears welled in his eyes. I was interested to know what he thought. Though I supposed he understood.

 ‘..All-.. All of them..?’ He whispered barely audible. 

It took me a moment to understand the query, ‘Oh yes. All of them.’ I confirmed, ‘Your master is very pleased with your numbers. They keep a leader board, your rank is the highest by far. You should be proud, you serve them so well.’ I commended. It was curious, his expression then was.. Pained? Remorseful? I can’t be certain, I’m not entirely familiar with that specific emotional range. 

I was about to continue explaining the process to him when the group of three entered from the opposite door. They had come through from the slaughter room and were talking amongst themselves casually. 

‘-that will be enough to fill all the orders for the following months.’ Markos was saying. 

‘We should consider a second expansion.’ Nathaniel was insisting as they conducted their routine inspection. 

‘Let’s not over-extend ourselves.’ Master answered to which his brother rolled his eyes. 

‘We can train more collectors brother.’ He sighed.

‘In a few years we could have no supply problems at all- Oh..’ Markos cut off mid agreement as he was the first to notice us.

Arbitrarily the brothers followed his gaze and their attention came to rest on Eric. ‘Oh indeed.’ Master commented, he gave me a pleased smile before turning to see his twin’s reaction.

Nathaniel stood rigid with shock, though no emotion crossed his face as he and Eric stared at each other. It was as if neither of them could quite comprehend what they were seeing. I can only imagine their thoughts. The lies Nathaniel had so carefully arranged were crashing down, the world Eric knew was shattering and all the while machinery continued to slice *meat* in the background. It was a pleasure to be a part of that moment. 

‘..You lied to me.. This entire time…’ The boy was coming to a new realization. Anger was replacing shock and he was starting to stand, using the wall for support as he did. 

‘Eric..’ He started but didn’t seem to know what to say. 

‘You killed them, every one of them!’ Eric shouted in response.

‘It’s just business, they’re just livestock, you must understand-…’ 

The Orphan cut him off, ‘They’re not livestock! They’re people! Every one of them-, I brought them here so that you could ***help*** them! You told me you sent them to Sweden!’

‘Come now Eric, you didn’t truly believe that did you? Surely you had your suspicions? Yet you still collected them because I asked you too, don’t hide behind morality. You ignored what you didn’t want to see.’ His attempts to calm him were uneffective. 

Eric grit his teeth, ‘I didn’t think you were butchering and eating them!’ 

‘I can put him down for you if you prefer.’ My master offered generously. 

‘You will do no such thing! I can fix this.’ Nathaniel snapped back quickly. 

Master gave a short laugh, ‘Will you never learn? He’s already in the right place, just kill him and hang him with the others-..’ He stopped. The air crackled with energy. 

Beside me, Eric was removing his eye patch. He let it drop slowly from his fingertips to the ground and beneath it I was surprised to see the eye was intact. Though the iris was a darkened purple that filled the whites of the eye almost completely and the pupil was a thin slit. The silver crescents on his neck lit up, glowing a bright white as an energy ignited up the length of his arm disintegrating his sleeve. The skin at his shoulder split and magic spilled out burning away the flesh as it transformed his arm. 

When it was complete his human limb was gone, replaced by that of a monster. I’m sure it must have hurt, though he showed no sign if it did, there was pure malice in his eyes and his glare could have withered daisies. 

‘What kind of contract did you give him?’ Master demanded of his brother.

‘I gave him a weapon..’ Nathaniel answered tranquilly.   

‘You gave him a weapon like that? Are you mad?!’ 

‘Everything is fine, he must obey my command as per the contract.’ 

‘Any command I *hear*.’ Eric corrected him calmly, as he took a knife from his belt in his left hand and stabbed it into his own ear canal. Not one of them moved to stop him as he repeated the process on the other side, deafening himself permanently. I suppose they were entirely too surprised. Or perhaps they simply didn’t realize the consequences of what he was doing until it was too late. Eric exhaled in pain as blood trickled down his neck on both sides and he took a moment to steady himself. 

I could see the implication of what he had just done dawning among the others. Their expressions varied. Markos looked apprehensive while Nathaniel seemed to be caught between disbelief and horror. My master seemed equally astonished though he also appeared afraid. Loopholes in contracts are common, though they are designed to benefit the masters.. So for him to use it to his own advantage was.. Unheard of. 

’…He’s your pet, you will deal with this.’ Master told Nathaniel as he took a step back, ‘Molly, *observe*. I want to know all that happens.’ He ordered and I nodded, then Master departed with Markos. Eric seemed to remember my presence for the first time at that moment and as I was the closest thing he lashed out at me first. I jumped away swiftly but made no effort to engage him, my orders were simply to monitor. 

The Orphan didn’t pursue me, instead his attention returned to his master as the man drew the sword on his belt. He seemed to be calculating before he made his next attack, he surprised us both by targeting the machinery instead of Nathaniel. Workers scrambled out of the way as he tore through the mechanics with his arm. 

One of the machines sparked violently and combusted after the impact. This was especially troublesome as most magic is flammable which makes fire difficult  for them to combat and in the ensuing chaos Eric disappeared. He slipped out following along the conveyor track that brought the bodies in. The order I was given compelled me to follow, though it was rather unpleasant pushing past the bodies. I came out in the containment room and could see right away that Eric had broken the locks on the cages. 

Livestock were running out the exit doors into the sub level tunnels, castle servants were scrambling to corral them back and I hurried to find the Orphan.  In the hallway I found him stumbling along, it was clear his balance was off but he seemed to have purpose in his direction. His enhanced eye was dilated and scanning the area as if he was searching for something. 

However I soon realized what it was, for ahead my master walked unaware of how the situation had escalated. Eric moved quicker the moment he saw him, his footsteps were light in just the way we had been trained and Master only noticed his approach at the last moment. Sharp claws met with a shield of energy as the resulting discharge threw them both back. 

Eric was unfortunately quick to recover and Master looked rather annoyed, ‘I warned my brother so many times to destroy you.’ He sneered, drawing a weapon to face him with. They fought in brief interactions, but the boy was swift and my master was out of practice. As it became apparent that he was outmatched my Master retreated, using his magic to put distance between them.

He managed to escape and Eric continued his pursuit after him. However as I moved to go after them an explosion from below rippled through the castle’s foundation. It caused some of the old stone to give in and I was momentarily delayed by a collapsed ceiling. This meant that by the time I regained sight of them they were on the rooftops, though getting up there myself was no easy task. 

Blood stained the pure snow and it seemed Eric was about to dispatch Master when an arrow flew, striking the boy through the left leg. It caused him to falter and he stumbled. I turned to see where it had come from and saw Calla, she stood beside Markos in the courtyard, ‘*Another, through his thigh*.’ Markos instructed and the girl obliged. 

Naturally Master took the opportunity he was granted and moved to cut him down. However, to everyone’s surprise metal connected with metal and sparks sprayed off sizzling in the snow. 

‘What are you doing?!’ Master hissed as Nathaniel now stood between them, I didn’t see where he had come from but energy radiated off of him in waves that dissipated slowly into the air.

’I cannot let you destroy him… I have told you that I can fix this, allow me the chance.’ He bargained. 

‘How can you fix this? He is deafened! He will never hear your command to obey!’

‘Please brother, I have asked you for nothing else but this and you owe me as much…’ Nathaniel implored him. 

I’m not entirely sure what he meant by that, however Master seemed annoyed, as if he had brought up something they weren’t ordinarily to discuss, ’You have asked me for a great many things in regard to *‘this’.* Yet you expect me to oblige you once more?’ 

‘I do.’ He confirmed. 

I could sense my master’s displeasure as he responded. ‘…Very well. But I will have you know I disagree and you may invoke no more favors from me.’ 

‘I understand.’ Nathaniel responded calmly as he turned his attention to Eric. The Orphan had taken the opportunity to remove the arrows from his leg and now faced him with a knife in his left hand, ‘Really Eric, you must be exhausted by now, give up.’ He said, irritated that he even dared to oppose him. 

When they met in combat it was clear that Eric was at a disadvantage, slowed by his injuries and unable to use his right arm against Nathaniel he stood little chance. Their battle took them further from the courtyard across the rooftops and Eric nearly fell more than once as they got higher up. It ended when Nathaniel caught a hold of him and slammed him back against the outer wall of one of the towers with enough force to crack the mortar. 

He held Eric there preventing him from raising the knife again and placed a hand over one of his damaged ears. A glow emitted and the boy flinched away begrudgingly as Nathaniel restored his hearing. ‘*You may never compromise your hearing again*.’ He commanded immediately. 

‘You promised I would be free of commands, you promised *you* wouldn’t use them on me again.’ He hissed. 

‘I lied.’ Nathaniel answered calmly, ‘Now *drop the knife*.’ 

Eric scowled as he reluctantly allowed the knife to fall away and Nathaniel readjusted his grip to hold him by the throat as he continued, ‘Do you have any idea how much damage you have done? Our entire operation is compromised because of this stunt.’ 

‘That was the intention.’ he retorted spitefully. He was trying to loosen Nathaniel's grip, though it was pointless, they are far stronger than we are and in response Nathaniel slammed him back into the wall again. It must have hurt for he gave a soft sound of pain and glared back at him with disdain.

‘That’s *enough! Behave*!’ He snapped, ‘Now listen to me. You’re going to stop this nonsense. If you wish to pretend you didn’t see the slaughter house that is perfectly fine. But you will not act out in this way. Am I making myself clear?’. 

Eric set his jaw and tilted his head up defiantly, refusing to answer. Though he at least had the good sense to stop struggling.   

‘*Speak!*’ He ordered in response to his resistance. 

‘Fuck you!’ He said venomously in response fulfilling the command, ‘Just kill me and get it over with.’ 

‘Kill you?’ He laughed humorlessly as he leant in close to threaten him. ‘I don’t think you understand the position you’re in here. Your life is forfeit, I hold your contract and I can make you obey anything I say, you belong to me. You should take a moment to think about what that means if you displease me again. I’ve been kind with you so far but my patience wears thin. Perhaps my next order should be for you to assist in the slaughterhouse? Or maybe it should be that you consume human flesh? Tell me, which would you prefer?’ He asked coldly. 

I saw fear in his eyes for the first time then, perhaps he understood the world of monsters more truly now. ‘..Nathaniel.. Please.. ’ Eric whispered more meekly.

‘You’re afraid? Good. There is some sense in you.’ He muttered exasperated, ‘I don’t ***want*** to do this you know. But you’ve left me no choice! Destroying our equipment, releasing all the livestock, attacking my brother! What else am I supposed to do with you?!’  He shouted and Eric flinched which seemed to bother him. 

‘You don’t have to do this.. Just let me go...’ He begged softly. 

Nathaniel let out a slow frustrated sigh, ‘My brother was right, I should have destroyed you years ago for all the trouble it would have saved me.’ He stated ruefully then gave the commands, ‘*You will say nothing more until I tell you otherwise. You will not attack my brother again, nor will you destroy any more of our castle. Follow me.*’ 

Eric did as he was instructed and Nathaniel led him back down to the courtyard where Master waited. He watched them approach with caution.

’*Step forward, kneel before my brother*.’ Nathaniel instructed and Eric dropped to his knees reluctantly before Master, ‘*Speak and apologize for your behavior.*’

‘I’m. Sorry. For my behavior.’ Eric hissed resentfully.

‘Good.’ Nathaniel mused though Master didn’t seem impressed. 

‘That was hardly sincere.’ 

‘Sincerity doesn’t matter. The point is he is under my command. The problem is solved.’ 

Master thought for a moment, ‘Barely. Our operations have been severely impacted. He should be punished for his actions.’ 

‘..What would you suggest?’ Nathaniel asked calmly. 

‘Command that he feel pain.’ He suggested nonchalantly. 

‘You don’t have to.’ Eric growled, I could tell he was still fighting the order to kneel. 

‘*Quiet*.’ His master ordered him, then responded to his brother, ’That’s unreasonable, he is already injured.’  

‘If you cannot make the command, I can punish him for you in other ways.’ Master offered. 

‘No.’ His brother answered in a controlled manner, though still delayed a moment longer before giving the command, ‘Eric.. Do you remember the pain you felt when I bestowed gifts on you? *You will feel that pain once more*.’

The results were immediate and Eric writhed in pain. I didn’t envy him. Perhaps if Eric had learned to submit without defiance he could have saved himself the agony. When it was over, he lay still in the snow breathing heavily as the shock faded. ‘Are you satisfied brother?’ Nathaniel asked without emotion. 

‘For now.’ Master agreed. 

‘Good. Then we will be leaving.’  

It was Nathaniel’s intention that Eric should continue to collect livestock for them under his command. Though the destruction of the processing room was problematic..” Molly mused to herself and I realized then that my hour was up. Of course I still had more questions, but they would have to wait as the guard buzzed through the door to escort me out.
