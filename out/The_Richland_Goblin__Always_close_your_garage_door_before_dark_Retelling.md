Yeah I know it sounds cliché, the title that is with all the warnings. Yes I know it is obvious with all the unsavory people that come out at night wanting to most likely steal my stuff. They might want to kill me at the worse end but that isn’t the reason why I am saying to make sure the door is closed.

Also, you maybe thinking that I should be talking about all doors but, you would be mistaken I am only talking about the garage door. You know that ones that go up so you can bring in your car. I know I’ve experimented with other doors front doors, back doors, sliding doors, warehouse doors, and hell I even took off the door entirely. It laughed at me for that one, but none of those it entered through not through any windows only the garage door.

I’m getting ahead of myself here. What am I talking about? Well, a few months, well actually a year ago now I moved into a new house in Washington, Richland specifically. I had moved into a new hosing area that has been recently built a lot of fields around. During the day it was nice and night was amazing it was so dark I could almost see the stars. For about a month it was like this peaceful and I loved it. About a month in to living there I saw something moving around in a vineyard that was behind my house. I just figured it was a fox or a coyote.

I had been told that they like to wander around the area at night so, I didn’t think much about it just a coyote. That was for a month sometimes I would see it clearer but it was too brief for me to make it out. That is when the disappearances started. It started at just some pets at first someone’s small dog got out chasing something and got taken by the coyotes it’s whatever. Then a kid went missing it was one of my neighbor’s kids it was a little boy named Mathew I think he was around 4 at the time.
The family had security cameras so obviously watch the footage to see where he went. It was 10pm at the time the kid was watching cartoons in the living room. Mom was out and dad was passed out drunk on the couch. Turns out that he was drinking because he found out that his wife was cheating which is where she was but that is besides the point. Kid was unattended, then at some point between shows a high pitched sound could be heard like throwing a pebble at a window, because turns out that is what actually happened. The kid turned and appeared to be watching something out the window for a little bit there are video cameras outside but it was in the perfect spot where it is close enough for the kid to see but not the cameras. That creepy bastard.

Anyways after like a minute the kid goes to the backdoor which was locked but he managed to unlock it and opened the door and went outside to the backyard and looked out at the field for another minute or so before following something that ran off it was visible on camera for a second and we saw what looked like a human foot on camera ,but we couldn’t be sure. I say we because after the kid ran out of his family’s camera’s range they appeared next on the next house’s camera’s and ran across their yard since none of us have fences. The kid kept chasing the thing till it got to my house and all that could be found was the kid’s blood; in my backyard.
So, this is why I know about this because I was a suspect in the kid’s disappearance but the police couldn’t find anything that connected me to it. This same thing happened 3 more times I was suspected each time but each time the only thing that could be found was the kid’s blood. I did put of video cameras after this of course I put them up after the first disappearance, but the bastard always avoided them.
After the third kid went missing it had calmed down for about a month. The kids were eventually found almost 3 miles away their bodies drained of blood and mangled in the trees of some poor farmer’s orchard investigation followed and nothing. Once they were found, good god, I swear the gates of hell opened. I had been living there for 5 months at this point and things only got worse. Like I said before gates of hell opened. For a month, a fucking month 2 kids went missing a week. They didn’t go out side no they were asleep in bed. The only thing they had in common was they were in my neighborhood and their windows were open. It took them through their fucking windows.

They were found later in the same spot as the last 3 the oldest this time was 13 it took a teenager and not even a small one this kid could have been a linebacker, hell I asked the parents he was a linebacker. No evidence to convict anyone again. God the first 6 months of me living here had been horrible. I wanted to move or live with someone else, but I couldn’t I didn’t have enough money. So, I had to stay and endure it. The next two months things calmed down a lot the only thing that was found was new claw marks on my door and the doors of the victims. They were in the shape of tally marks on the victims counting them. The last victim’s door had 13 written in tally marks. Mine was a smiling face.

It wasn’t on camera for any of this it would either tear out or move the cameras away from the door so all we could see was a hand a gray skeletal hand. Followed by occasional pet disappearances but, those were actual coyotes. There was one braking and wondering case nothing was taken but the garage door was wedged open with a price of wood. Nothing on camera again.

This is where I wanted to write this story this is what happened to push me over the edge of keeping this quiet. It got in. I knew it could but, it waited to I was too tired to remember to close the garage door one night. Nothing was taken and my camera’s weren’t tampered with but, all that could be seen was a small dark silhouette dark from outside to underneath my car. It couldn’t be found after that. It couldn’t be found for 2 months till January 3rd. When I heard tapping from the door going into my garage.

I go to the door with my gun I had a shotgun loaded with slugs. I ask who is there. Nothing. Silence for what felt like hours then pounding so hard it actually damaged my door frame. I swing the door open and there it was standing underneath my open garage door snow blowing in from outside. It was a large figure it was nearly 7 feet tall and skeletal like it had nothing but bones. Its hands were long and thin each finger on its hand had the sharpest claws I had ever seen. Its feet were human like but it only stood on its toes like a cat (digigrade I had to look it up). It’s skin was a pale gray and it had a tail that was like a rat’s tail. Its head was similar to a human it was like a mix between a wolf and a human. It’s ear we’re where human ear we’re supposed to be but their were long and pointed like elf’s ears. Its eyes were solid black and it’s mouth. Good god that is what haunts me to this day. It was smiling wide it had all its teeth showing they glistened white. Whiter than I have ever seen and they were like a dog’s teeth. I can’t I see it.

Then. Oh god then it spoke it had a deep horse and raspy voice it said “Thank you for letting me in David I’ll be back. Your blood will be delicious” it spoke slowly with breaks to take deep breaths between each word like speaking was exhausting to it. Then it left it ran on all four legs like a dog it was fast. Of course I tried to shoot at it but, it was too fast and I couldn’t steady my hands to get a clean shot.
I’ve seen it again several times it refuses to enter when I’m there and refuses to enter through any door or window but my garage door. I don’t dive my car anymore and I never open that door I take the bus and lock all the doors and windows of my house when I can. I cover all the windows but, every night when I sleep I can hear pebbles being tossed at my window and it’s horrible high shrill laugh. And I can see it staring at me if I’m in the garage at night I can see its smile.

It has been a year to the day that I moved in and I can’t take it anymore I hear it knocking on my garage door I’m gonna open it. Thank you.

He was declared missing 2 weeks after the incident all other criminal activity regarding David had stopped after this fact. His face was found 10 miles away from his home sliced from his body on a rock in an elementary school playground causing it to be closed for the day. The creature described hasn’t been seen and no surveillance footage has been found of this creature as any and all camera that would have captured it was destroyed. Many have labeled this creature as the Richland Goblin and has been become a popular crypted of the area. The original post has been taken down by police to calm the public but, I still have it so here it is pleas bring justice for David. I won’t I can hear pebbles being thrown at my window it might just be some kids but, I think it’s the goblin and it’s not happy I’m sharing this. Thank you for reading and good bye.
