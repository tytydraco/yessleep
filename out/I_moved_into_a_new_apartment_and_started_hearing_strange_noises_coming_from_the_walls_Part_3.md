Sitting on that bench, I took deep breaths to slow my racing heart. What was I thinking, wanting to confront whatever was in my apartment alone? I was in way over my head dealing with something so frightening. But the thought of it harming someone else steeled my resolve. I had to at least try to stop it.

  
First I needed help. Someone experienced with creepy old buildings who could advise me. I decided to call Mike, a contractor I found online. To my relief, he agreed to come check out the apartment right away.

  
We walked through the rooms as I described the bizarre incidents. Mike's face was grim as he examined the cracked mirror and charred kitchen socket.

  
"Old wiring and pipes can make some crazy noises and cause accidents," he said. "But this seems like more than just an old building settling." He hesitated before adding, "If I were you, I'd get this place blessed just to be safe."

  
I nodded eagerly. "Do you know someone who could do that?"

  
Mike rubbed his chin. "Well, my aunt is pretty religious, leads a small church over on Oak Street. Why don't I give her a call?"

  
That evening Mike returned with his aunt, Pastor Celia. She was tall with piercing eyes and carried a large leather bible. As we entered the apartment she stopped, waving her hand over the rooms murmuring, "There is a darkness here..."

  
I shivered. She turned to me with a somber expression. "I will cleanse this place of evil. But it will take great courage and faith."

  
We stood in the living room as Pastor Celia opened her bible. As she began reciting verses, the temperature dropped sharply. The walls creaked and groaned around us. My heart pounded as a rank stench filled the air.

  
Pastor Celia's voice rose louder, commanding all evil spirits leave this home. Thunder rumbled outside as she shouted a final verse. The pastor appeared drained but satisfied. "The evil presence is gone. God has prevailed."

  
Mike sighed in relief and squeezed my shoulder. "It's over now, buddy. You can rest easy." I managed a weak smile, but couldn't escape the feeling that deep down...this was far from over.

  
Over the next few days, I stayed alert for any signs of trouble. But the apartment remained quiet. No strange noises or smells. I started to breathe easier, thinking maybe Pastor Celia had succeeded. Until three nights later.

  
I awoke to freezing air blasting my face. Eyes flying open, I saw my bedroom window was wide open, frigid wind whipping the curtains. Heart seized in panic, I leapt up to slam it shut. Peering out into the darkness, I saw a pale face staring back at me from the alley below.

  
I jumped back with a cry. When I dared to look again, it was gone. The street was empty. Trembling uncontrollably, I sank to the floor with my back against the door.  


Something was still here.

The next morning I called Mike, my voice shaking as I described the eerie face in the window.

  
"I'll come back over," he said, tone serious. "Don't panic, we'll figure this out."  
But inside, my thoughts spiraled. Whatever was tormenting me refused to leave. I couldn't live like this, in constant terror under the same roof as some malevolent force.

  
Mike's reassuring presence helped calm me as we walked through the apartment again. Nothing seemed disturbed in the light of day.

  
"And you're sure the window was closed and locked before?" Mike asked, examining the latch.

  
"Positive. I'm always careful about that," I replied. He scratched his head.

  
"Maybe lay off the late night horror movies for awhile," he said with a gentle laugh. My cheeks flushed. I couldn't blame him for being skeptical.

  
Mike changed all the locks and inspected the fire escape and roof access. As he was leaving, he hesitated at the door.

  
"You know Sam, old plumbing and electrical can cause hallucinations if there's a leak," he suggested. "Might be worth getting a carbon monoxide detector just in case."

  
I nodded weakly, but I knew it wasn't fumes or imagination. This was real. And escalating.

  
That night I left all the lights blazing. I tried calling a few close friends to stay over, but they were busy. Finally exhaustion overcame fear, and I fell into a fitful sleep on the couch.

  
Sometime past midnight I woke with a start. The rooms were dark and freezing. Heart hammering, I fumbled for the lamp switch. In the shadows I made out a tall silhouette standing perfectly still, watching me.

  
I screamed and stumbled back against the wall, shielding my face. When I found the courage to look again, nothing was there. Just my empty living room, lights now burning normally.

  
Shaking violently, I grabbed my phone and car keys. I had to get out of there. But where could I go in the middle of the night? With trembling fingers, I texted my friend Jake who lived just outside the city.

  
Jake: Dude what's up? Why u coming over at 3am?

  
Me: I'm so sorry but something is very wrong with my apartment. Please can I crash on ur couch tonight?

  
Jake: Of course man. Everything ok?

  
Me: No. I'll explain when I get there.

  
Jake stared bleary-eyed at my disheveled state when he opened his door. As I recounted the bizarre events, his expression shifted to concern.

  
"I think you're dealing with something serious, Sam. Let me call my Uncle Ross in the morning. He's an occult expert who consults with the police sometimes."

  
I exhaled in relief. Finally someone who wouldn't dismiss this as just an overactive imagination. The next day Jake's uncle came over to talk.

  
Ross was an imposing bald man with piercing blue eyes. He listened intently as I described the escalating phenomena. After some probing questions, he leaned back looking troubled.

  
"I believe a dark entity has attached itself to you or the building," he said gravely. "We must act swiftly. I'd like to perform a cleansing ritual in the apartment and attempt communication."

  
My pulse spiked at the idea of deliberately making contact. But Ross believed it was necessary to understand what we were dealing with before attempting banishment.

  
So that night we sat across from each other in my living room, surrounded by burning candles. Ross murmured strange words then placed an ornate stone bowl on the table, pouring in oils that emitted pungent fumes.

  
"Let us call forth the inhabitant of this place," Ross proclaimed. The smoke twisted into a column, almost humanoid in form. A sinister cold permeated the room.

  
The smoke figure suddenly dispersed into a violent gust that snuffed out all light. A voice like splintering wood boomed out of the darkness.

  
"LEAVE NOW!"

  
The lights returned, leaving us rattled. Ross' brow was beaded with sweat, his face pale. He turned to me, eyes grave.

  
"A vengeful spirit resides here. And it is focused on you, Sam. We must take drastic measures before this escalates further."

  
A tense dread now gripped me, seeming to confirm my worst fears. We were dealing with something malevolent and obsessed with me specifically.

  
Ross insisted I stay elsewhere while he made preparations for a more powerful cleansing ritual. Jake offered his place again, but I couldn't bear waiting days to confront this thing. I had to know why it was after me.

  
Against advice, the next night I returned alone. I brought only a small bag of salt and candles per Ross' instructions to ward off the evil presence. The apartment was intolerably icy when I entered.

  
I quickly lined the windows and doors with salt then sat vigilantly on the couch. 

As midnight approached, the oppressive atmosphere grew. My heart pounded erratically, breath coming in panicked gasps. I jumped at every creak and pop of the old building.  
But still I waited, determined to stand my ground. To face this demonic spirit that had seized upon me for some sinister agenda.

  
Finally I fell into a exhausted sleep. And had the most vivid, terrifying dream of a gaunt face hovering over me, smiling wickedly as clawed hands reached for my throat. I awoke screaming and flailing.

  
Except I wasn't dreaming. Icy fingers were wrapped tight around my neck, cutting off air. Gasping futilely, I stared up into the grinning visage of my attacker, eyes deranged and hungry.

  
Fading into blackness, my last conscious thoughts were that this was no mere haunting. This was an inhuman monster that had lured me back specifically to fulfil its twisted purpose. And I, in my reckless pursuit of answers, had walked blindly into its trap.
