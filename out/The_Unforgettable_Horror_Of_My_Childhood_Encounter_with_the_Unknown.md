As a child, I had a strange and terrifying experience that still haunted me to this day. It started at a Red Lobster restaurant where I was having dinner with my family. I excused myself to go to the bathroom, but when I caught a glimpse of my reflection in the mirror, I saw something that I couldn't explain.

At first, I thought it was just my imagination playing tricks on me, but then I saw it again. And again. Each time I saw this mysterious figure in the mirror, I felt a cold hand squeeze my heart, and I couldn't shake the feeling that something was watching me, waiting to reach out and grab me.

I tried to ignore the strange figure, but it seemed to follow me everywhere I went. I would hear a whispering voice calling my name in the darkness of my room, causing me to wake up in a cold sweat. I would see things move on their own, toys falling off the shelves, doors opening and closing, and shadows appearing and disappearing. The fear was constant, and I could never shake the feeling that something was always watching me, waiting to reach out and grab me.

It wasn't until I was at a friend's sleepover that I had the most frightening encounter. We were playing hide-and-seek in the basement when I heard a strange sound that seemed to be getting closer. I turned around and saw a figure standing just inches away from me. I couldn't see its face, but I felt its breath on my neck, and I heard it whisper my name. I screamed and ran, but the figure seemed to follow me, growing closer and closer. I never went back to that house again.

To this day, I still didn't know what that figure was, but the fear it instilled in me as a child had stayed with me all these years. I could still feel its presence, hear its voice, and see its shadow. I didn't know why it chose to haunt me, but the memory of that strange encounter was burned into my mind, and I would never be able to forget the terror it brought into my life. Was it a ghost? A monster? A demon? I still didn't know.

And yet, I find myself drawn to write this story. It is as if an unseen force is urging me to put these events into words, as if by doing so, I might finally understand what happened to me all those years ago. But as I write these words, I can't help but feel like I am being watched, like that figure is still following me, waiting to reach out and grab me. I don't know what will happen when I finish writing this, but I can't shake the feeling that I am about to uncover something even more sinister and frightening than I could ever imagined. I will keep everyone updated if anything else happens. I have doubts though. It's been years.
