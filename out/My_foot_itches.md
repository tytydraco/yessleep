The moon shines in the sliding door window. I’m sleepy, but not groggy. It’s natural for me to wake up like this in the night sometimes. My foot itches. I roll my head to the right. I’m always closer to the window than her. The bedsheet tugs just a little against my skin as her chest rises. She breathes in and out slowly, still asleep. I usually draw the blinds, but I must have forgotten to last night. I should scratch my foot, which itches, and draw the blinds, and then I can go back to sleep. I go to heave myself up, but something’s weird. My foot feels numb, but like it got pricked as I started to move it just now, but not like the pins and needles when your foot falls asleep. A splinter or something, I guess. I stop and slide myself forward, minding my foot, and fold the sheet off myself, slowly, carefully, leaving it on her. There’s a bunch of straw stuck to my foot- no, it’s sticking out of my foot.

  
There’s straw sticking out of a perfectly cut oval hole in the bottom of my foot. It’s a little bigger than half as long and half as wide as my foot. I almost gasp, but stop before I make any noise. It doesn’t feel like anyone’s still here though, it wouldn’t make sense. And even if I did make a sound, it’s them— I breathe shallow and feel up my leg. Everything under the ankle is numb. I try, but I can’t get my toes to move even a little, and it’s totally numb. I don’t want to mess with the straw, I need a doctor. I don’t want it to start bleeding. Where is the blood? There’s no blood on the sheets, there’s not even any blood at the edge of the skin where the straw comes out. How long did this take to do? In the night lighting I finally notice the color of my foot. There’s no blood red, but it’s not pale either… I don’t go outside much. My skin is almost translucent, and so the straw color shows through under what it’s stuffed in. I go to try and bend my big toe with my hand. Everything was taken out first. No joints, no bone, there’s just straw that strains and starts to fold. I can feel it, even hear it under the skin. I bend more and watch my big toe fold limply, misshapen now.

  
I know what this is. I don’t know if she got punished too. She’s asleep still. My heart is pounding in my chest, the air feels too dry as I slowly, carefully peel the bedsheet off her, dreading it as I look over her body. If she wakes up, I will be there, if they did something, I will be there. But I don’t want her to wake up yet, I want to just get myself under control so I can be there. We’ll leave right now, tonight. I hover over her to look at the other side of her now, there’s nothing. I look around the room, I almost say something. But no one’s here. It’s done. I almost laugh, but it’s nervous, I feel like I got off easy. I sit still for a moment, I’ll get ready to go. …but I want to wrap myself around her first. She breathes in and out slowly against me. I nestle my head into hers. I’m crying, silently, in relief. Relief it was just a warning. It’s okay. We can disappear to somewhere far away. I tuck my lips into her neck. I slide my hand up to the back of her head, slip my fingers under her long hair. She breathes in and out slowly against me.

  
My finger pricks on a piece of straw.
