Well, not your typical microscope that you use in your biology class in high school. No, I am referring to a scanning tunneling microscope, the one that allows you to see the structures of materials at an atomic level. Once you have everything set up, it should be quite easy to use. However, the setup is such a pain, a terrible pain in the ass.

Before you even look at anything under this type of microscope, you need to set up an appropriate environment. Like get a table that uses a pneumatic system to keep it steady against all vibrations, even the tiniest one like someone walking down the hallway. Then you have to set up the tungsten needle. It has to be so thin, just as thin or even thinner than those needles used in hospitals. Not only thin, the tip has to be extremely sharp. And it's not like you can sharpen those with a nail file. No, you have to use either a fancy mechanical device or a chemical method to do it. And you’re not even done afterwards. Now you have to prepare the sample, study it, and make it as flat and as clean as inhumanly possible. No, I don’t mean humanly. I really mean that you have to go way beyond your abilities to make that sample so Goddamn smooth and clean that you will want to cry once you’re done.

However, once this is done, which usually takes hours or even days, then and only then you can even consider scanning the sample under the special microscope. 

I am in my third year of university, attending an advanced laboratory physics course, along with 27 other students. And one of the projects that I have to work on is, you guessed it, scanning tunneling microscopy. My project is to choose three samples provided by Professor Massimo and identify them using the scanning tunneling microscope. I am hoping that at least one of the samples is graphene because that’s easy to identify, especially since its atomic structure forms honeycomb patterns.

However, I don’t think I will be that lucky. I know that Professor Massimo despises me, ever since I dropped a metal water bottle in the lab a month ago. No damage was done. No one was startled. But somehow, he came out of his office screaming at me, saying that I almost ruined an extremely sensitive experiment of his. I don’t know why he was using the student labs to do it though. He has his personal lab at the deepest depths of this building where he can run his super sensitive experiments.

You can tell that I don’t like this guy, right? Well, it’s warranted. I think he is the most selfish professor I have ever met. All he cares about are his experiments, not the students. He only teaches us for the money, and he doesn’t teach us properly. I can’t even remember the last time he brought slides into class or wrote equations on the whiteboard. He just speaks to us like a robot in front of the classroom, reading out loud everything that he wrote in his papers.

At least the teaching assistant is nice. I like Felicia. She has a passion for teaching physics to students in the lab. This has been extremely helpful for everyone because they are learning nothing from the classroom lectures. However, I can also see her frustrations. She is taking the brunt of the questions from everyone, including myself, because of Professor Massimo’s lack of care. Hopefully, she can get a break and continue her PhD research once this is done.

Thinking about it now, maybe she has started her break already. I have not seen Felicia for at least a week and I have noticed Professor Massimo teaching the lab component in her place. Which notably leaves the students, including myself, sorely pissed at the whole thing. I remember inquiring about her absence from Massimo and his reply was vague, saying that her task was done and that he will take over from here.

During the wee hours of the night, I was working in the lab to finish setting up the experiment when I noticed that Emilio, my partner, did not show up at the time we agreed upon. He’s a nice guy, never late, but I know for sure that the professor hated him just as much as he hates me. It wasn’t even his fault either. Emilio was doing the courteous thing by stomping on his boots to shake off the water just before entering the lab because it was raining cats and dogs a few weeks ago, and Professor Massimo came storming out, screaming at him, claiming that he almost ruined his very sensitive experiment.

The only person in the lab was me. Wishing not to be left alone, I decided to call Emilio and check that he was indeed coming. It rang a few times before going to voicemail. I left a rather colorful message for him, so that he absolutely knew how I felt about his absence. A few minutes later, I heard rushing footsteps and a door opening behind me. I turned around expecting to find Emilio, but he wasn’t there. The door did move though.

I was extremely perplexed by this. I turned around to finish up the lab setup and noticed Professor Massimo standing right in front of me, watching me silently. I gasped, shocked at his sudden appearance.

My surprise did not seem to move Professor Massimo in the slightest. In fact, he just stood there, watching me. He seemed very curious, maybe wondering why I was here at 8:00 pm.

“Well, I see that your lab partner isn’t here. That’s a shame,” Professor Massimo said, breaking the silence.

“Indeed,” I replied, confused as to why he was here or even speaking to me.

“I want to modify your assignment, just for you,” Professor Massimo said, handing me a small box. “Take this. I decided that this project is too tough. You only need to examine this sample and identify it in your report.”

“Thank you very much!” I responded, relieved by what he said.

“Oh, and I forgot to mention that Emilio’s mother sent me a note, stating that he is sick today and is unable to make it for the rest of the week,” he said in a neutral tone.

With that, he left for his office and closed the door. I opened the box and saw a perfectly smooth, thin rectangular material. It looked like it was made ready to be placed under the microscope. With any luck, the sample was smooth and clean enough to be used under the microscope.

Fortunately, Emilio and I had completed a good portion of the setup yesterday, and I was able to finally finish it today, precisely at 8:27 pm.

I decided to do an initial scan of the sample the professor provided me and see how it goes. If it was already prepared, then the scan would be quite clean, and I could save the results and send them to Emilio tonight. Otherwise, I could come in tomorrow evening to clean up the sample and do another run.

That reminded me that I should send a message or call Emilio later tonight to see how he’s feeling. Strange that he didn’t send me a notification about his well-being earlier today. It could’ve saved me some emotional stress from his absence, and that colorful voicemail that I left for him.

Anyways, I placed the sample in the scanning tunneling microscope and executed its scanning procedure. I could see the tungsten tip that I chemically etched move across the sample from top to bottom. I was expecting the scan to finish in thirty minutes considering the size of the sample, which was large by the microscope’s standards. But somehow, it finished in seven minutes.

Excited, I looked at the results and saw two highly unusual patterns at the center of the sample. They looked like fuzzy, imperfect ovals, almost human-like. I rubbed my eyes and looked again; they looked human-like. I told myself that I must be imagining things, that impurities like this can occur in nature. However, the patterns surrounding these shapes were almost honeycomb-shaped, except that instead of one-dimensional hexagons, they were one-dimensional pentagons. In all my three years of undergraduate studies, I had never heard of pentagonal lattices before in one dimension, only two-dimensional.

This sample was extremely strange, but the ovals confused me the most. So, I zoomed in again at the ovals and I could see fuzzy features that kind of looked like hair. The oval on the right side seemed to display a person’s head with long hair, and the one on the left seemed to display a bald person. I was starting to think that this sample had some sort of voodoo or something to it as it didn’t make any sense at all.

I zoomed in to the max to try to make out the features on both ovals. I almost dropped to the floor in disbelief. That bald face. That scar underneath his right eye due to a childhood incident with a candle. That was Emilio. And the face with the long hair. I recognized her face, that was Felicia. Both of their faces had their eyes closed and their mouths shut.

I ran the scan again, this time focusing on the faces, thinking that somehow the microscope or software or both were hallucinating or somethin. This time, the results came back, and I let out a loud gasp of shock. This time their eyes were wide open, and so were their mouths. They seemed to be expressing fear, or pain, or I don’t know what. It was all so confusing for me.

Screw it! I decided to forget the lab, the results, and even my backpack. I grabbed my coat, determined to leave immediately. A sense of unease had settled over me, and I didn't feel safe—not even in the slightest.

Just as I was about to step out, the door behind me creaked open. I turned around to see Professor Massimo emerging from his office. He walked towards me slowly, his gaze fixed on me with an intensity that seemed to pierce my very soul.

Even though it was against university policy, I always kept pepper spray on me. I held it up, aiming it directly at the professor.

“Don’t come any closer! I mean it!” I demanded, my voice trembling slightly. “I don’t know what’s going on, Professor Massimo, but I don’t like it at all.”

He ignored my warning and continued his slow, deliberate walk towards me. His eyes never left mine, and he began to speak in a melodious tone that sent chills down my spine. “Why do we look for intelligence beyond the skies? Beyond the stars? When they exist so close to us. Beyond our sight, but within our grasp!”

I was puzzled by his words, but my primary concern was that he seemed completely unafraid of my weapon.

“Why are you afraid? Come, join me. Join your friends,” he said grimly, his voice carrying an eerie calm. “You should see them. They exist in a world beyond the atomic scale.”

He stopped roughly twelve feet in front of me, his eyes still locked onto mine. “Are you afraid?” he inquired, his tone almost mocking. “You shouldn’t be. Your friend, Emilio, is having a wonderful time with them.”

“But he is in pain!” I replied harshly, pointing at the screen displaying the faces of Emilio and Felicia.

Professor Massimo glanced at the screen, then turned his piercing gaze back to me. “All I need is one more. They will be pleased with one more. They demand it,” he said, his voice devoid of any emotion.

Suddenly, he lunged towards me with phenomenal speed. I barely managed to dodge his grasp, his arms missing me by mere inches. He fell to the floor, landing between me and the only exit from the lab. Quickly scanning the room, I noticed the door to his office was open. Without hesitation, I sprinted towards it, slammed the door shut, and locked it.

Within seconds, I heard him banging on the door, his voice filled with fury as he demanded that I open it.

I didn’t have time to think about how he recovered from that fall so quickly. Instead, I moved the desk and chair against the door, further barricading it to prevent Massimo from barging into his office.

I reached into my coat to grab my phone and call the police when I heard whirring sounds behind me. I quickly turned around to see an open door inviting me into another room. The room was spacious, with a large metal table at its center. The table seemed to be modified with a pneumatic system, similar to the one I used, designed to prevent vibrations from shaking it. On the table was a scanning tunneling microscope, much larger than the one I had been using, and a small, perfect cube made of some sort of purple metal. The microscope appeared to be scanning the cube repeatedly.

Next to the microscope was a monitor, displaying the images it was capturing. Initially, I saw the same one-dimensional pentagonal pattern I had observed earlier, with no abnormalities. Then, the microscope scanned the sample again, and the image began to change. The pentagonal pattern slowly faded, replaced by a one-dimensional square pattern. In the center of the screen, an empty space began to form, occupying roughly half of the image. It seemed like a fluke.

However, I quickly came to my senses, realizing I had no time to dilly-dally. Just as I was about to press the call button after dialing 911, the microscope suddenly stopped scanning. I looked back at the screen and saw the perfectly square patterns surrounding a large empty square in the center.

That's when I saw it. An arm—or what looked like an arm—seemingly appeared from the empty square. It was skinny, with three slender, protruding fingers. The arm was fuzzy and static, like the interference you see on a TV screen. It flickered and crackled with electronic energy, its outline shifting and unstable, as if it were made of pure static. The sound it emitted was reminiscent of TV static, a constant, unsettling hiss that filled the room. The arm reached out, aiming to grab me.

I quickly jolted out of the room, slamming the door shut behind me, and backed away rapidly. But to my horror, I saw the hand reach through the door, passing through it as if it were thin air. Just before it could grab me, I dodged out of the way, ignoring my surroundings. The hand missed me by inches, continuing past the office entrance door where Massimo was located.

In my haste, I miscalculated and hit my head on the corner of a bookshelf near the wall. Pain shot through my skull, and I felt a fainting spell coming over me. Desperately, I took out my phone once again and dialed 911. But as I tried to speak, my strength gave out, and I dropped to the floor, feeling very weak.

Before passing out, I could hear the professor's screams mingling with the operator's concerned inquiries, asking if everything was okay.

I woke up, surrounded by sterile walls and stark bright lights. I was lying in a hard bed, with a nurse, a doctor, a police officer, and my parents standing around me. My parents were crying joyously, their relief palpable as they saw my eyes open. They kept repeating that everything was fine now and that I was safe. I could hear the doctor reassuring them that I needed rest but expressing relief that I had woken up, worried that I might have fallen into a coma. I told them I was still sleepy and fell into a deep, peaceful slumber after saying nighty-night to them.

During the week I spent in the hospital, Officer Darius visited me several times to ask questions about what had happened that night. I told him I was alone in the lab and that Massimo had tried to kidnap me for God knows what. I mentioned that Emilio and Felicia were brought up during our encounter. However, I intentionally left out the part about the arm that tried to grab me, knowing he would never believe such a bizarre story.

“There are a few things that concern me,” Officer Darius said during one of his visits. “Emilio and Felicia are still missing with no traces to be found. And Dr. Massimo is nowhere to be seen. We checked his house, his family, and everyone related to him. It’s like he disappeared out of existence.”

Officer Darius paused, then continued. “The only thing we found that might lead to his whereabouts and possibly the location of Emilio and Felicia is this object we found in his lab.”

He took out the purple metal cube, now wrapped in a plastic bag, from his pocket. I held back my screams as the memories came flooding back.

“Are you familiar with this?” Officer Darius inquired.

“No,” I replied, trying to remain calm. “I have never seen it in my life.”

“That’s okay. No one at the university has seen it either. It’s not mentioned in any documents or notes in his office or the university database,” Officer Darius continued, looking at the cube with a puzzled expression. “If I can only figure out where he got it from, maybe we can find him, Emilio, and Felicia.”

“Well, I won’t bother you with any more questions,” Officer Darius said. “Get some rest. I’ll come by if I have more questions for you. You’ve been through enough already.”

With that, he left the room. I was alone, which somehow brought me a sense of peace.

In my gut, though, I knew that all three had disappeared, never to be seen again. While no one was looking, I cried and mourned for Emilio and Felicia, hoping they were okay but knowing deep down that they were likely for all eternity because of that monster. I cursed at the name Massimo, hoping he too would suffer for the crimes he committed.

As for that cube, I hoped to never see it again. To never even hear the possibility of other worlds existing near us, where intelligence beyond our own exists past the atomic scale.

Because that would mean they could be anywhere here on Earth. Existing in the lint on our clothes or the nails of our fingertips. Always within their grasp. Right next to me.

And right next to you.
