I tried to put these events into words several times already. I hope this last attempt, the one you have in front of you now, will be the most comprensible. I don't know what awaits me — psych ward, or something worse — but I have to tell someone about it. Anyone.

I was only nine years old when I and my elementary-school friends still used to roam the abandoned barracks behind our housing projects at the edge of the woods. There were four of us. Among the graffiti-painted concrete walls, there was one particular sight. It was a gray concrete rectangle built into a hill overgrown with trees and weeds. No windows or markings — just a pair of heavy metal doors exactly in the middle of the front wall. We were always puzzled about what it might originally have been.

A storage shed? Too big.  
A dump? No. It was completely enclosed. Huge rusted metal gates were locked with locks and chains, as if someone wanted to make absolutely sure nobody could open them by any means. We had no idea what it could be, but we quickly stopped worrying about it.

Like the other kids, we played pirates, gangsters, and so on. One sunny summer day, Chris, one of my friends and the heaviest member of our group, decided to solve the mystery once and for all. He grabbed a heavier stone and started to hammer the rusted door with it.

“Chris! What are you doing?” I asked.  
“Maybe there are some cool stuff inside? If I don't see what's in there, I'll die of curiosity!” he answered.

One by one, the old, rusty chains crumbled under the force of his blows with the rock. When the last one broke, we looked at those intimidating huge doors and at each other, uneasy.

“Who's opening it?” I asked.  
“Chris! You smashed it, so now open it!” Bob yelled.  
“Don't be a wimp!” added Sam.

After a moment's thought, Chris shoved the gate open; it swung wide with an unbearably animalistic squeal and creak. I'll never forget that sound. It still seems to haunt me.

A complete darkness met our eyes. The only thing that seemed to come out of it was yet another door leading further deep into the hill. Now our curiosity completely devoured us.

“Fuck, man! It's probably some kind of bunker!” I shouted.  
“Of course! How did we not think of that!” Chris replied ecstatically. “There must be some cool gas mask and other army stuff here!”

Without thinking much, we opened those next doors, which were in much better condition than the first. Behind them was a corridor leading to a room flooded in utter darkness.

We had no reason not to go in. If it was a bunker, there would surely be treasures inside. And so, one by one, we found ourselves in the middle of total black. We could only see a little daylight, barely reaching the corridor from outside. As we groped around the room searching for anything, Chris shouted at the top of his lungs with all the volume he could muster:

“SOMEBODY'S HERE!”

Chaos. That's all I remember. Complete chaos of tangled voices and screams — ours and someone else's. I don't know. I don't remember exactly what that “someone” said. A complete babble. The only things that stuck in my memory were a terrifying laugh and a pain in my stomach, as if someone had struck me hard.

Ten years passed and I still thought about it. All the other boys, except Chris, left the projects. We never talked about it.

One day, by pure chance, as I was walking home from class, I ran into Chris. We talked like any old friends — about school, girls, and the usual stuff. In the end, I couldn't hold back, and I reminded him of that incident in the barracks. He went pale.

“I almost forgot about it,” he said, embarrassed.

He stared like an idiot at his shoes and nervously picked at his nails. Panic flickered in his eyes.

“I don't remember how we got away from there, you know?” he added after a long while.

Unnerved, I suggested we could go there now, just to put it behind us. He agreed.

After about half an hour's walk, we stood before it again. That concrete monster with its mouth hung wide open - rust and broken chains lying in front like the fossilized guts of some slayed beast. The path to it was difficult; the forest had grown thick and wild over the years. The undergrowth seemed to suffocate us.

Chris was probably about to have a panic attack as we crossed the threshold. He trembled all over, but after a few encouraging words I persuaded him to go inside. We lit our way with our phones. I still wonder what we would have seen in that damned room ten years ago if we'd taken proper flashlights with us. Maybe it's better that until death I don't find out the answer to that question.

Again - a shout. Mine and Chris’s. A dreadful shout of madmen, crazed by fear, terror and returning memories. A shout of death.

This time it was not caused by some invisible predator’s chuckling and babbling. It was something worse, something we did not expect; something that will probably get us sent to the nuthouse as soon as one of us decides to speak of it in public.

There, by the wall; there were bodies. FOUR small bodies. Mine, Chris’s, Bob’s and Sam's. Exactly in the same condition, with the same haircuts, wearing the same clothes we had worn that cursed summer day. The only difference was their faces — completely expressionless — and their bluish skin. Here and there the bodies were rotten and white bone showed through.

They sat propped against the wall as if someone had carefully placed them there.

And now I remembered that, that day, we had not managed to get away.
