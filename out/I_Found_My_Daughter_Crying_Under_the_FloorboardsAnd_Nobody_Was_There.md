When we bought the Colonial on Maple Street, it felt like a whisper from another time: creaking banisters, leaded-glass windows, and wide-plank floors so old they moaned underfoot. Our daughter, Clara, was only three. She toddled through the rooms with her pink flashlight, pretending she was an explorer. I joked that we’d unearthed an adventurer.

It started the night of February 18th, exactly two weeks after we moved in. Clara woke me at 2:17 a.m., blinking terrified in the dark. “Daddy, there’s a baby crying downstairs.”

I pegged it for the pipes—old houses sing through their plumbing. I tucked her back in and went to inspect. Every faucet off. No drafts, no gurgles. I shrugged and went back upstairs. Clara slept the rest of the night.

Over the next few days, she kept mentioning the crying. “It sounds like a baby,” she’d say, voice trembling. “A real baby.” My wife, Mara, insisted it was just excitement or a vivid imagination. I wanted to believe her.

Then came the scratching. Late at night, long, slow scrapes beneath our bedroom floorboards, like someone trying to pry them up. I lay awake, listening. The wood whispered back to me, but I couldn’t pinpoint where.

On March 3rd, Clara vanished for three minutes. I dashed from the kitchen to find her gone—then heard her soft sobbing. It was under the dining room floor. I pried at the oak boards. One sliver of wood lifted on a rusty hinge. Beneath was a narrow crawlspace, just wide enough for a child. I knelt and peered in.

Clara sat on the dirt, knees hugged to her chest, tears wet on her cheeks. “The baby’s cold,” she sobbed. I reached down—she recoiled. “He won’t let me touch him.”

My heart hammered. “Come on, sweetheart.” I flipped the hatch shut and dragged her inside. She trembled against me. I called Mara. We sat on the sofa, speechless. I considered calling the police. What would I say? “My daughter found a baby buried under our floorboards”? It sounded insane.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. I crept downstairs at 1:46 a.m. The house was deathly silent. I knelt by the dining room hatch and listened. Nothing. I opened it—panting cold air. Clara’s tiny footprints in the dust on the beams. But no baby, no cry.

The next morning, I cut the boards out entirely and ripped the old insulation. Beneath lay a rough-hewn wooden box, like a coffin. I pried its lid. Inside—nothing. No bones, no blanket, just the faint smell of rot lingering in the splinters.

I filled it with concrete. I bolted a steel plate and set a lock. Firm. Final. Clara seemed relieved. Mara slept without headphones again. I drank black coffee like medicine.

But on the night of March 17th, it started again—earlier, louder. Not crying this time, but laughter. High, childish giggles under the floor, echoing up through the wood. Clara sat straight up. “Daddy, he’s laughing.” Her flashlight beam darted over the walls.

I wrenched open the hatch. The metal plate I’d bolted was pried aside. The concrete had fractured. Fresh claw marks scored the edges.

I scrambled down. The box was gone. In its place, a small, tattered blanket lay on the dirt, soaked in something dark. I recoiled as Clara screamed behind me. Written in the dust around the blanket, in tiny, perfect letters:

“LOOK UNDER YOUR BED.”

My blood froze. I dimmed my flashlight and crawled back up, dusting my knees. Clara huddled beside Mara. I told them to go upstairs—go to bed—and I’d fix it. They obeyed, trembling. I waited until they slept, then crept back down.

Under my bed, in the moonlight through the window, I saw it: a tiny, red-soaked handprint pressed into the mattress—too small for Clara.

That’s when I heard it behind me: the soft scrape of wood. I whipped around. The hatch was open again. And there, on the threshold, stood a child’s silhouette—distorted, impossibly tall, with arms that stretched below its knees. Its head cocked at an impossible angle, like a puppet’s.

I froze. The figure tilted forward, and a voice hissed like wind through a grave:
“I LIVE WITH YOU NOW.”

It stepped toward me—slow, deliberate. I stumbled back, crashed into the dresser, and scrambled out of the room, slamming the door. I bolted it, wedged a chair under the knob, and dialed 911 with shaking fingers.

By the time the police arrived, the creature was gone. No prints in the crawlspace, no handprint under the bed, no blood-soaked blanket—nothing but the solid wood of the hatch and the cold concrete I had poured. They said they found no evidence. Perhaps a break-in. Or rats scratching. They left me with a pamphlet on home security.

We moved two days later. Clara sleeps in our room now; Mara and I never turn our backs.

Last night, as I tucked Clara in, she whispered, wide-eyed: “Daddy… I heard him talking under my bed. He said, ‘Don’t forget me.’”

She reached for my hand. I squeezed it. Above us, the floorboards remained silent, for now. But I know he’s still there—watching, waiting, laughing. And this time, I’m not sure the police will come back.

Because I told them there was nothing under the floor.

And I still haven’t told Clara the truth: he’s never coming to get me. He’s coming for her.

If you listen closely at night, you might hear him too.
