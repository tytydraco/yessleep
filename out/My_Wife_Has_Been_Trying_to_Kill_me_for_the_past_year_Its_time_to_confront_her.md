I’m pretty sure that my wife is trying to kill me. For the past year I’ve been observing her patterns and keeping a log on her every move.

It all started about a year ago, when she returned from a long trip. She was frustrated at me because her flight was delayed by the weather. The turbulence had also sickened her to her stomach and every so often she would go to the bathroom and make gurgling noises. As if she was trying to throw up, but she couldn’t.

That night she cooked me dinner, complaining about how since she’s been gone I didn’t do anything in the house. Like fix the cupboards or take out the trash. I had always been a bit of a slob and whenever my wife told me to do something, I didn’t really worry about it. Honestly, we lived on the Countryside, quite far away from most civilization and I didn’t see any reason to be neat and clean for anyone.

I tasted the meat she had cooked and it was completely raw. So was most of the rice and vegetables. When I asked her about it she shot me an angry look and said if I didn’t like it I should do it myself. This was nothing like the sweet caring wife I knew. That night when I tried to be intimate with her she refused. Saying she was still sick.

In the days that followed her sickness remained, and I worked on my novel in the attic of our home. I could hear her try to throw up more and more. She also started to get paler. However that was probably because of the harsh winter that had started and the lack of sun.

I asked her to see a doctor soon after and she agreed to go, however she went alone. Upon returning she told me he had prescribed her a group of medicines. They had hard to pronounce names but I believe some of them were Olanzapine, amisulpride, ziprasidone, and quetiapine.

A few days after that I asked her for a cup of tea while I continued to write. She brought it to me, but it tasted funny. Taking the first sip, I spit out the sour concoction. I inspected it and at the bottom of the cup I found a devil’s brew of wet and crusted together tablets, as if she was trying to overdose me.

Over the months that followed her tablets continued to come in the mail, but she never took them, her attempts on my life also grew more bold. Poisonous snakes had entered our home, I tried to catch them but they always escaped me. When I told her about it she claimed that there was never any snakes. Upon further research I found that these snakes we’re not native to our area.

After that she started to serve me more food but this time some of it was spoiled and I even found a maggot in one of the pieces of meat.
Once, while I stood on the balcony she even tried to push, however according to her she just slipped and fell onto me.

Throughout all this, her schedule remained the same. She woke up cooked me food, tried to throw up, went outside and sat on a stone in the backyard until dinner. Than cooked more food and went to sleep.
Last week I called her parents to set up a meeting so that we could all talk to my wife and hopefully get her back to the person she used to be. They wouldn’t listen and just hung up on me.

Today was the last straw. I finally tried to fix that broken cupboard she had been complaining about and opening it I found all her medication. The same as before Olanzapine, amisulpride, ziprasidone, and quetiapine. All dating back throughout the year. She hadn’t taken any of it.

Now I’m just sitting here waiting for the right time to confront her.  Thinking about how I’ll walk downstairs to the stone that she sits on, the one with her name engraved on it and tell her I know she’s trying to kill me.
