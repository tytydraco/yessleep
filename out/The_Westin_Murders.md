I was five years old when the first murder took place and it rattled our small town of \*REDACTED\*. I, of course, had no worries at the time. I was confused as to why everyone was worried but no one could tell a little five-year-old that a child around his age was found dismembered, part of his body missing, believed to have been eaten. There was no suspect in the murder, no evidence left at the scene of the crime. Everyone began to live in a state of paranoia. No one trusted anyone. People, who were once close friends, spread apart. One murder destroyed our little town. No one knew at the time that it wasn’t over.



A few months later, the next murder took place in the same grizzly fashion. The body of a young adult was found, torn and dismembered. The only reason her body was ever found was because the body, torn and dismembered, was dragged for miles. A hiker found the trail of blood and called the police. The police found the body of Jane Doe, only identified by a person who went missing around the same time. No identifying information was left at the body. The body was in such bad shape that they could hardly tell it was a human. 



In that year 15 total murders took place. During that time, the police put a curfew in place, police stood at every street corner, monitoring. Despite their best efforts people still died. It was all in the same way. They were ripped to shreds, almost like an animal attack if the small town even had any animal large enough to do that. The five year old could possibly be taken out by some of the animals here but not full grown adults. 



I lived my whole life in paranoia but never truly understood the situation until I was 15 and my parents finally sat me down and explained the situation. By then the amount of people murdered was over 100. I never understood why my parents didn’t leave, but I don’t blame them for this. This isn’t the purpose of this post. My parents weren’t bad.



The point is I think I know what killed those people. Whatever it was was NOT human and the paranoia was all for nothing. I went out searching for the murderer, expecting a human. I know what you’ll all say I’m stupid. I agree but I did bring a gun along, my father’s old revolver that he gave me as a gift. Despite being at least 30 years old, the gun worked like it was brand new. 



I went to where each of the crimes took place, the police tape was long removed. I went at night as I still lived with my parents. I am 21 but after graduating college, my dad got sick and soon passed. I wanted to stay and take care of my mom. My mom was heartbroken after my father’s death. Anyway, I went strolling through the woods. Somehow I dodged the police still positioned around the town. They never stopped with the police standing around even after years of not finding a killer. Sometimes you could hear the officers grumbling about it but they still do their job. 



The forest was dark and eerily quiet not a sound in sight, not even a cricket chirping. A shiver ran across me despite the fact it wasn’t cold. About a mile into the woods an ear-piercing scream broke the silence. I sprinted in the direction. I don’t know why I did. I thought perhaps I could save the person. It was too late. A creature laid hunched over it the thick scent of decay wafting from that direction along with the strong smell of blood. 



The creature was tall and bony, its ribs poking from beneath scruffy fur. Flies buzzed around it. Its face was one that was almost canine-like but with teeth sharper than I had seen on any carnivore before. Its eyes were dark empty sockets, its arm ended in sharp claws. It was a bipedal creature but absolutely hideous. It was decaying in areas, maggots wriggling around the open area. I could see its ribcage and a large beating heart inside. I knew the reason for the smell of decay.



It was tearing strips of meat from the still form on the ground. They were obviously human or were at one point. I took a stumbling step backward, stepping on a stick that broke with a loud crack. The creature’s head twisted around backward. Blood dripped from its muzzle, its mouth open in a ghoulish grin. I screamed and ran as fast as I could through the woods. I leaped over twigs and roots on the ground. I made it home and promptly vomited.



The reason isn’t to warn others though. The reason I need to share is that ever since that day I wake up around 3:00 at night and feel like I’m being watched. I feel like I see that ghoulish grin through my window, the head turned around 180 degrees. I think it is hunting me, waiting for me to be alone at night. I don’t know what to do and I am scared. My mom refuses to leave though and I can’t leave her alone with this thing. If it can’t get me it might take her.
