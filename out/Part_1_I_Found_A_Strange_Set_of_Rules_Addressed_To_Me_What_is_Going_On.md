I suppose I should start from the beginning, the very beginning.

The sky was dark as the final hues of the sunset faded away. My return home was imminent. I had finished work particularly late. I walked briskly as my surroundings became darker. I took a quick break, leaning against a lamppost, out of anyone's way.

It was then that I saw a piece of paper, attached to the lamppost with a piece of tape. I was stunned.

'**Rules For Your Survival'**

I read the title in my head. It seemed ridiculous, why would I need rules to survive? I was even more shocked when I read the first sentence:

'Dear **Bennett Leonard Gill'**

I was astonished, was that my... name? Written on that piece of paper was... my name? My full name? I was even more shaken because... I'd never told anyone my middle name, that was something only my family knew, and they lived three hours away.

'This note is for your safety, to prepare you for what is about to occur.

I am aware that you have just moved in here, but be alert, as *they* know you are here. There is a limit to what I can do to keep you safe, but here are a few rules that should do the trick: **make sure to follow them closely**.

Rule 1: Once you enter your place of residence, you have exactly **one hour** to gather all of your necessary belongings, there should be a bag by the entrance, but your stuff in there, and never come back.

Rule 2: Trust no one: everyone is **guilty until proven innocent.**

Rule 3: On every cloudless night with a full moon, **don't get caught sleeping.**

Rule 4: Never stay anywhere for too long, that makes it easier for *them.*

Rule 5: Don't stay inside someone else's house after dark: this rule does not apply to public property.

Rule 6: If you feel like you're being watched, **don't look behind you.**

Rule 7: Don't look in any reflective surface for too long, **then they'll find you.**

Rule 8: There is a set of keys inside the safe in your bedroom, the code to it is '2365', **don't leave them behind.**

Rule 9: If you hear any strange noises, like a heartbeat or whispers with no plausible source, run, *fast.*

Rule 10: After you read this note, **never utter your name again. You may use any other name but your own.** Names are very important things, and to have someone... unideal know yours would be a problem.

Those are the rules, **don't break any single one.**

**What is yours was always theirs**'

I stood there in shock, my mouth gaping open. Pardon my language but, oh shit, fucking hell...  how did this person know about the safe in my bedroom? Who wrote this? Was this some sort of entity? I was never a believer of the supernatural but... this was too strange.

I grabbed the note, sprinted home and unlocked the door. Sure enough, a brown rucksack was right in front of me.

*This has to be some sort of joke...* ***right?***
