I worked for the county, not as a dispatcher but as one of the people who cleaned up recordings afterward. Training material. Legal review. That kind of thing.

Most calls never made it past the first pass. They were boring or redundant or too chaotic to be useful. Others stayed with me longer than they should have. You learn to compartmentalize. You have to.

This one slipped through.

The call came in at 2:17 a.m. on a Wednesday. Residential. No address anomaly. No dropped signal. The dispatcher’s voice was calm, professional, exactly how it should be.

The caller was a woman. Mid thirties, maybe older. Hard to tell. Her voice was steady in a way that didn’t match what she was saying.

“There’s someone in my house,” she said.

The dispatcher followed protocol. Asked for her address. Confirmed it. Asked if she was in immediate danger.

“I don’t think so,” the woman said. “He’s just standing there.”

Standing where.

“In the hallway. Outside my bedroom.”

The dispatcher asked if she could leave the room.

“No.”

Why not.

“Because he told me not to.”

There it was. The first thing that made me pause the audio.

The dispatcher handled it well. Asked for a description. Male. Average height. Dark clothes. No visible weapon. Not moving. Just standing.

Police were dispatched. ETA was seven minutes.

The dispatcher told the woman to stay on the line. Lock the door if possible.

“I already did,” the woman said. “He unlocked it.”

That earned a note in the margin. Possible hallucination. Possible domestic situation. Stress response.

The dispatcher asked if the woman knew the man.

“I don’t think so,” she said. Then, after a beat, “He knows me.”

How.

“He’s using my name.”

The dispatcher asked her to whisper if she needed to.

The woman said, “He says it doesn’t matter.”

That was when the call quality changed. Not static. Not interference. Just a subtle flattening of the sound, like the room had absorbed it.

I remember leaning back in my chair when I first heard that part. Rolling my shoulders. Telling myself not to anthropomorphize audio.

The dispatcher asked the woman to describe what the man was doing now.

“He tilted his head,” she said. “Like he’s listening to you.”

The dispatcher paused. You could hear it. Half a second too long.

Ma’am, is he speaking right now.

“No,” the woman said. “But he’s smiling.”

The dispatcher told her to keep her eyes on the door.

“I don’t have to,” the woman said. “I can see his shadow under it.”

The dispatcher asked if there was any light on in the hallway.

“No.”

Then how could she see the shadow.

Another pause.

“He’s brighter than the dark,” the woman said.

That was where the training value dropped off. That line got the call flagged for psychological distress. I should have trimmed it there.

I didn’t.

The dispatcher redirected. Asked the woman to describe her surroundings. Grounding techniques. Breathe. Name objects in the room.

The woman complied. Bed. Dresser. Lamp. Phone.

Then she stopped.

“What is it,” the dispatcher asked.

“He’s closer,” the woman said. “I didn’t hear him move.”

The dispatcher told her officers were en route.

“I know,” the woman said. “He said they won’t see him.”

The dispatcher asked her to clarify.

“He said he’s not here the way they’re here.”

That sentence is underlined three times in my notes.

The dispatcher asked the woman to keep talking.

“I don’t think I’m supposed to,” she said. “He’s asking why you’re lying to me.”

The dispatcher assured her no one was lying.

The woman laughed. A short sound. Almost embarrassed.

“He says you’re very good at it,” she said.

At 2:23 a.m., the audio picked up a second voice.

It was faint. Not coming through the phone. Coming through the room.

I replayed that section dozens of times. Checked waveforms. Compared channels. It was there.

A man’s voice, low and unhurried.

“That’s not true,” it said.

The dispatcher reacted immediately. Asked who else was in the room.

The woman didn’t answer.

Instead, the man spoke again. Clearer this time.

“You shouldn’t have told her to lock the door.”

The dispatcher called for backup. Her voice stayed level, but it tightened.

Ma’am, if you can hear me, please respond.

“She can hear you,” the man said. “She just doesn’t know which of us to answer.”

The woman started crying then. Quietly. Like she was trying not to be rude.

“I don’t want to make him mad,” she said.

The dispatcher asked who he was.

“I asked her not to explain me,” the man said. “It never goes well.”

The dispatcher told the woman to leave the phone on and exit through the window if possible.

There was a sound then. Fabric shifting. Footsteps. Not hurried.

“No,” the man said. Not raised. Not threatening. Just firm. “We’re almost done.”

The dispatcher said officers were on the street.

“I know,” the man said. “I can hear them thinking.”

The woman made a small noise. Like surprise.

“He’s right,” she said. “They’re scared.”

The dispatcher asked the woman to focus on her voice.

“Which one,” the woman asked.

That was the last thing she said.

The call ended at 2:26 a.m. Abrupt disconnect. No struggle sounds. No scream. Just silence.

The police report came in later that morning. Officers arrived to find the house empty. Front door unlocked. Bedroom undisturbed. Phone on the bed, screen cracked from the inside.

No signs of forced entry. No signs of exit.

The woman had no history of mental illness. No domestic partner. No neighbors reported seeing anyone leave.

The case was marked unresolved.

I edited the call down to six minutes. Removed the second voice. Cut the stranger references. Left it as a textbook example of a perceived intruder with dissociative features.

That is what I told myself.

Two months later, I got a call from my supervisor. Asked if I had worked on file 17-0426.

I said yes.

She asked why my name was spoken on the recording.

I didn’t understand.

She played it for me. A version I had never heard.

Same call. Same timestamps. Same voices.

Except this time, when the man spoke for the first time, he said my name.

Not shouted. Not emphasized. Like it was obvious.

“That’s not true, Esha,” he said.

I told my supervisor it must have been contamination. Audio bleed. Suggestibility.

She nodded. She looked tired.

She asked me to listen to one more thing.

A new call. Taken that morning. Different dispatcher. Different address.

A man on the line this time.

“There’s someone in my house,” he said.

The dispatcher asked for his name.

He gave it.

Then he said, “He’s telling me you already know this part.”
