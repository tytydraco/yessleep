You may or may not have heard about the water park "incident".  Many people claim it was an accident, but i think it might have been caused by a poltergeist or maybe a creature of some sort! Here goes one of the worst water park days of all time. It all happened years ago of course at a water park.

I was there in the "lazy river", as people called it, damn kids, always getting in my way of a relaxing pool time. Anyways there was this huge water slide, I would say twelve people would go down it at once, I wouldn't go down it if my life depended on it. Thing looks like it would fall apart any moment, which, eventually did happen and caused the "incident."

I was almost doing my 46 lap around the lazy river that day, when some more kids decided to jump on my tube and start splashing me. I was out of it  I couldn't even think, but, eventually they did. Oh man I hate those kids, Hope the water slide i was talking about breaks and they get hurt.

But I remember the exact time it happened, 5:53PM. I was just about to wrap up my day at the water park and i noticed a giant figure, honestly I wouldn't even call it that. But right as i saw it pass through of the supports of the water slide the entire slide came out crushing multiple people and injuring hundreds. I couldn't really breathe at what i was seeing. Really i was just so tired of those kids I really didn't even have the energy to be shocked.

Of course the water park was shut down and we all had to go home, I didn't really wanna watch the news, I felt, kinda, tired to be apart of something like this. I hurridly came into the living room though when i noticed my son was watching the news about the incident. There was this beautiful reporter her name was at the bottom of the screen showing "ALLISON REPORTING TO THE SCENE OF COLLAPSED WATER SLIDE AT AMUSEMENT PARK" I couldn't believe what I was seeing how, could, I-I do, such a thing?

I didn't wanna kill hundreds but i just wanted to have some peace alone. I turned the TV off and put my son to bed and went to bed my self. Earlier that night, I woke up to, voices, well in my head, Is this whats is like when you kill? Voices of the  people? I decided to go to another water park. It was dark, it was windy, very windy. Almost to the point where I couldn't stand. Yeah right that had to been the cause, just wind right? I laughed a little at that thought, knowing I was gonna be caught eventually, as the voices got stronger I realized, maybe, Loosing the bolts of THIS slide is not such a good idea. Ah i thought maybe them kids will be taught not to mess with old people on the lazy river.

Thinking about those past times maybe, I really should't go to another water park tonight, I mean, I do plan on going and loosing the massive bolts. It gives me joy in knowing i did good for the world, getting rid of those kids. I hope this is a lesson to all of you out there, that, first, never mess with old people at water parks and never, ever, go down a water slide.
