The body in the desert is trying to talk to me



The title says it all. For context,  I work as a national park ranger here in the Mojave desert, in California. I work with a couple other people and, to be honest, it's kinda fun here. Everyday is like summer, we really have nothing going on because no one wants to spend their time at this god forsaken place. So we go exploring the trails, swim in the virgin river(Down the road from our ranger camp) and, when it's hot outside, boot up the console and play Minecraft or fortnite, or whatever else we wanna play that day. 



But not everything is sunshine and rainbows here. The mojave is cruel, and has many cruel stories that it tried to hide from the naked eye. I, for one, am able to tell you those stories today, because I have been stationed here for a little over a year. Colonials usually died making it out here, I guess they were either going to Los Angeles, San Francisco, or San Diego and got stuck here. They would either die of hunger, or loss of water, and other colonials would find their dried up bodies under some dead brush. The people who did make it out of the Mojave, have stories to tell when they get to the place that they want to go. 



‘A giant skinned man was stalking us, always 40 to 50 behind us, never coming closer and never falling behind’ or ‘I would hear a  thousand voices outside of my tent, all speaking at once, making incoherent sentences. They sound human, but something is off about how they speak. But when I opened the tent, nothing, not a single thing, it's all like they ran off and hid under a bush, a sick joke is what it is’ These stories always freaked me out, especially the sinned man. 



T\\He’s the more popular ‘cryptid’ here. There would be stories of colonials who would get close to the man and can smell rotting flesh. His eyes were like a goats, and his skin was dried from the hot sun. The weirdest part was how he talked. He talked like a normal person, surprisingly, but it didn't make any sense. He would say things like



“I really need a ride to the death valley shop, just 20 minutes in the night, can you help me?” or “ THe devil is waiting for you in hell, dear friend.” I would say the skinned man was dangerous, yeah he was freaky and would give you the heebies jeebies if he kept following you for miles without any food or water, but he did not harm anybody. I thought he was completely harmless



Until I saw him for the first time 



Me and my friends, Will and Harvey, were mapping out a new trail. Everything was  normal, until we came across an abandoned house. Abandoned houses out here are normal, there's thousands of them in the Mojave desert. But this one reeked of death. It was absolutely putrid, it stung your eyes and your mouth. 



“God damn that smell is absolutely horrendous.”  said Harvey. I suggested that we needed to find whatever was making that smell, and started walking up to the house. Although Will and Harvey were reluctant, they followed me along. I had to cover my mouth from gagging, the smell was that bad. Will ran out of the house and threw up on a dead brush. 

I followed the smell until I came across one of the rooms. There was a body. It looked like it had been there for a long, long time. It barely had any flesh on it, their eyes were gone, and it honestly looked kind of sad. Harvey took some pictures for evidence and we backed out of there. As I looked back at the body one more time, I swear I saw eyeballs roll into the sockets, and look at me. And I swear it said something



“We are many, you are few.”



I thought I was going crazy, I asked Harvey if he saw eyeballs, and he said no. All day and all night I kept thinking about it. When I went to sleep, I Dreamt of that horrible creature. It spoke to me. At first it had a high pitched voice, and I couldn't understand what it was saying. But then it started using a normal voice, saying word salad.



Then it used my voice



It was standing in the corner, and all I could see was its eyeballs reflecting off of the moonlight from the window.



“I know that you saw us and you see us now.” It crawled closer to my bed, “ Thatcher, I know you are scared of us, and we know all your fears. “ We were formed, not created, by a child. That child is you, you created us, in this hideous beast.” It was standing next to me now. I tried to move, tried to hit it to get it away from me, but I couldn't. “And now we see. The fear in the eyes, Why are you scared of us thatcher? We are your friend, and you are ours.” That sentence sent shivers down my spine. “ I dont know who they fuck you are, you need to get out right now.” I said, still very much afraid. “That's not how you're supposed to talk to us Thatcher, We were supposed to be friends forever, but you ditched us. The pain of hiding, turning into this. But we are here now, and we will never ever leave you again.” 



And with that, the creature disappeared. I knew I was dreaming of this hell, my hell. What did it mean, when it said I created it. I didn't create shit. I'm so scared right now, I'm afraid whatever that thing is will come back, but I have no idea when. So question still remains, what is that thing, and what does it want with me
