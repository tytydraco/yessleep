“So did I just kill my fiancée’s ex-fiancé?” I asked, staring down as blood bubbled from the grimy man’s throat. [The fireplace poker was still jammed where I’d forced it into his neck](https://redd.it/16w4v9v).

“Carl?” Frank asked, pulling back from his embrace but refusing to let me go entirely. His mustache twitched. “No, Carl… well, he had a whole other situation. Don’t worry about Carl.” Frank’s face broke into another grin. “You passed the test! I always liked you enough to hope that I might *actually* like you one day.” He belted out a laugh that sounded like he was squeezing his own breath through a phlegmy tube of toothpaste. Then, still either not knowing or not caring how uncomfortable it made me, Frank squeezed my chest and pulled me back out of the room. 

Lacey appeared, seemingly of nowhere, and wrapped her slender arms around me. For a moment I was lost in smooth skin and the smell of her shampoo, and the trauma eased just a little.

Then she pulled back and locked soft, brown eyes with me. “I’m so sorry, Joseph. I – I know you don’t understand now, but you will.”

A chill dropped down my spine as though someone had dumped a bucket of ants into my vertebrae; Frank’s face suddenly appeared inches from ours. “So,” he grunted to Lacey, “you’re the one who’s been plowing my new friend, Joseph.”

Then he laughed so loudly that the sound broke into raspy coughs. 

Lacey broke away from me. “Dad, you know I don’t like hearing you talk about ‘plowing’.”

His coughing worsened as he laughed harder. “Are you saying the two of you *don’t* plow each other?”

“Dad!”

Frank slapped his knee as his face went from red to purple. He waved his hands in surrender, as though we were intentionally forcing him into the situation. 

Two awkward minutes later, he wiped his eyes and finally controlling his breathing. “I love you both. I really do.”

“We met fifteen minutes ago, Frank.”

“Which is why I’m looking forward to the next part.”

“Nuts.” 

Lacey pulled me toward her and communicated without words. Her eyes told me that things would get better if I just went with her father’s wishes until this nightmare of a day was over, that he exhausted her as well, and that we would both make each other’s days better when we finally had time to ourselves.

I raised my eyebrow in a way that she understood to reference the possibility of plowing. She wrinkled her nose to let me know that this was not the time for such discussions. 

“Fine,” I sighed. “What’s the next part?”

Frank twitched his bushy eyebrows and pulled out an enormous Glock 41. I’d purchased a G19 a year and one month earlier; this was a much bigger gun.

“Holy shit,” I gasped, stepping back. 

“Relax, it’s not for you,” Lacey interjected, stepping forward to take the weapon from her father. 

“I feel that I am owed more of an explanation than I have hitherto received.”

Lacey’s face fell. “I know. I’m – I’m sorry. Look, Joseph,” she offered, clutching my arms. The cold metal of the gun butt chilled my skin. “It’s one of those things that just doesn’t make sense if I explain it. You have to go through the experience to get what’s going on.” She bit her lip. “Do you know what I mean?”

“By the definition you offered, no.”

Frank interrupted us by opening the door to the room I’d just exited. I didn’t like the fact that he was still smiling. “Let’s see what’s behind Door Number Two.”

“It’s still the same door, Frank.”

Lacey ignored me, pulling my arm and heading toward her father. I was inclined to resist, but the sudden appearance of firearms led me to the decision that Lacey was correct in communicating that things would be easier if I just went along with things until it was time to go.

Besides, the man inside was more dead than he had been while threatening me.

I questioned my own actions, however, when for the second time, Frank locked the door behind me. I took a deep breath, inhaling the copper scent that now permeated the room. 

Lacey turned to me, pointing the gun at the floor with one arm and grabbing her elbow with the other. “So I need to go over some of the rules,” she explained.

“I think that would be very helpful.”

She nodded, her pretty brown hair falling over her shoulders. “So this is about cause and effect.” Lacey looked down at the bloody mess. “What happened first is that you left the dead man lying on the floor of this room.”

I folded my arms, unsure of what to expect next. 

“What happened as a result was that.” She nodded at the corpse.

Which wasn’t very corpse-like, because it was twitching. The man groaned, shifting his body weight back and forth. Raw fear stabbed my heart as waves of blood poured from his gaping wound with every twitch. He reached a dirty arm toward his head and tried to grasp the poker in his neck. It seemed that the death strike had damaged his gross motor movements, though, and he was unable to find the metal rod. Instead, he rolled, flopping the poker to his other side with a *clang*, until he was face-down.

Then he pressed his palms against the floor, fingers splayed, and lifted his head.

I looked to the locked door, down to the man on the ground, and back to my fiancée. 

She had the gun. The corpse on the ground still retained the poker. I was left with nothing but the browning of my pants.

Obviously, I made it out alive, but I’ll tell about that a little later.
