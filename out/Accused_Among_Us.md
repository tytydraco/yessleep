It’s 9:30 PM on a Friday night and I’m stuck working a late shift in the 24/7 gas station with my coworker Gabel. It was a slow night and me and Gabel were just having the usual conversation about movies, games, etc. Until a weird woman walked in the gas station.

She had an eyepatch, dark purple hair, tethered clothes, and a small black bag (sizable enough to carry a firearm). She walked up to the counter where me and Gabel was talking. And with her deep feminine voice, she asked both of us: “Do you know where the bathroom is”?

Then I replied: “Oh, it’s in the back and to the left”. And then she replied: “Okay thanks, I have to take my medicine at a certain time and I usually take them in the bathroom”. And the small bag she was carrying had her medications.

I breathe a sigh of relief when it was just medications in the bag. My mind sometimes jump to conclusions without processing the situation until I see clear clarification. But, I never let my paranoia get the better of me and I’m willing to hear both sides of the story.

After the woman with the dark purple hair left, Gabel jokingly said: “Well, I guess the director of Clerks didn’t want to go with the original ending after all”.

It is now 11:50 PM and I just can’t wait for my shift to be over. The place is completely empty and all I’ve been doing was watching commentary videos on YouTube. One video was talking about how a gaming YouTuber named Jerald got accused by two people over grooming and his soon to be ex wife: Molly didn’t back him up. But it turns out that the two people (both named Clarissa, but with different spelling) fabricated their receipts and Molly was upset over Jerald having an relationship with another gaming YouTuber (even though Jerald and Molly had an open relationship during their marriage). 

And then a beautiful distressed woman ran into the gas station asking for help. When me and Gabel walked up to her, I asked the distressed lady: “What’s the problem”? She replied: “My boyfriend is coming after me, he saw me with another guy and assumed that I was cheating on him. She Continued: “So, he kicked down the door and brutally beat him down. Then when I tried running away, he shot me in my leg”.

Then I told her: “Everything is going to be alright, what’s your name”? She replied: “My name is Lily”. Then I said: “Nice to meet you, Lily. My name is Kaine”. Gabel suggested that we should call the cops, but Lily said she tried that multiple times and the police always tell her to file a domestic report.

While all of us was processing what we were going to do, a man in a black suit and white colored eyes was at the door. While Lily was founding a place to hide, the man walked up to us and said: “My name is Raziel, I’m looking for a woman named Lily”. Raziel asked: “Do the both of you know where she is”?

 As Gabel stumbled his words, I asked Raziel: Why? So you can abuse her some more”? Raziel replied: “Oh, so she is here? She’s lying to you”. Raziel continued: “I never laid a hand on her or any woman in my life unless I have to”.

As Raziel walked back to the front door, he looked back and said: “If you know what’s good for you, both of you will get out of way, so I can get her”. After delivering that warning, Raziel left the gas station. I went to where Lily was hiding and told her that Raziel is gone.

Lily then told me that she was sorry for getting me into this and that I was so brave for not backing down. I may not know anything about her, but she just has the most gorgeous eyes ever along with the most precious face I’ve ever seen. Before I started to make my move, a loud bang happened outside the gas station.

Me and Lily checked to see what it was and it was just Gabel taking out the trash. Then after Gabel went inside, out of the darkness, Raziel and two other guys walked up to the gas station, armed with guns. And seeing how Raziel presented himself, I realized that Lily was running away from a sinister cult.

Hysterical, Gabel was contemplating to giving up Lily to Raziel. But I told him not to worry, I’ll handle this. So I went behind the counter and grabbed the gun that was hidden underneath. Gabel then said: “Are you crazy? This has nothing to do with us. I’m giving her up right now”.

And then once Gabel grabbed Lily by the arm and opened the front door…. *BANG* Gabel got shot in the head and fell dead on the floor. Because it was me who pulled the trigger, I knew Raziel and his company wasn’t going to let us live, I knew once we gave her up, we was going to be dead anyway. So I made a fatal decision and shot Gabel in the head.

Once Raziel and his friends started firing, I grabbed Lily and we took cover inside. While me and Lily was taking cover, I noticed her wound was healed up, but I didn’t pay no attention to it because I was focusing on surviving the night. 

And then Raziel threw a Molotov where Me and Lily were taking cover, but luckily, we moved in time and ran to the emergency exit. While Lily was putting down a false trail, I found the perfect hiding spot to take Raziel and his two friends out. Once Raziel and his crew follow the false trail, I shot both of his followers dead in quick succession from the roof.

But then unluckily, when I dropped down from the ladder to shot Raziel, I ran out of bullets. And then Raziel proceeded to throw me through one of the glass window of the store. As I tried to recover from what happened, I see Raziel stalking Lily to the woods.

Then I took a rifle from one of Raziel’s followers and then I followed them. Once I was almost close to Raziel, I see he was carrying a firearm and a black wooden stake. And I was thinking to myself: “What kind of freakish cult is this”?

And then when I tried to get the upper hand on Raziel, I stepped on a tree branch. Once Raziel turned around, without hesitation, I blasted him on his torso with the rifle. As Raziel laid down helpless, I walked up to him, grabbed his black wooden stake and said: “It’s over, you cultist bastard. I’m calling the cops on you”. Coughing heavily, Raziel weakly replied: “You fool, we were trying to protect you”. 

Then I asked: “What are you talking about? You shot at Lily and me first and Lily told me what you did to that guy at his house”. Raziel replied: “That guy was my brother, my brother was dating this girl named lily”. Raziel continued: I met Lily one time and something felt off about her, she didn’t know certain things about my brother and they’ve been together for half a year. My brother then told me to stop being paranoid, what him and Lily have is real and then he say if I didn’t like it, then leave”.

Raziel continued: “Then the following week: When i’m not working at my nearby church, I like to read mysterious crime reports and there was this one article that intrigued me. Before I clicked on it, my brother called and said that he didn’t mean to yell at me, he didn’t know what came over him. I told him it was okay and if you’re available, I can come visit you. My brother said that was fine”.

I replied: “So….how does that justify shooting at me”? Raziel replied: “I’M GETTING TO IT. So, I clicked on the article and it said that a man had his torso shredded apart by a mysterious creature that no one could identify”. Raziel continued: “The man had a wife and I looked at the picture of his widow and it was Lily. Surprisingly, there was more articles about it with Lily in it, but the one I read happened 5 months ago”.

Raziel continued: “So I raced to my brother’s house and when I entered, I saw Lily ripping my brother apart. When she looked at me, she had horns, claws, and her face looked animalistic. Then she nonchalantly said it’s not what it looks like. That’s when I tried to shoot her, but I only shot her in the leg”. 

Then I said: “What the hell is she then”? Raziel replied: “Exactly….HELL, she’s a demon and her real name is Lilith. A rebellious night creature who do these things just for kicks”. And then both me and Raziel heard a maniacal laugh in the distance.

And it was Lily showing up in her true demon form and she said: “Don’t forget: Manipulatively Intelligent”. And then it all made sense: I was manipulated into protecting her and killed three people (including my friend Gabel, who treated me like a brother) for nothing. Raziel then grabbed his firearm and told me to run.

Lily then flew up and landed on Raziel. Then Lily proceeded to maul Raziel. I ran out of the woods as fast as I can and then I see Lily flying preparing to dive attack me. And then at the right moment: when she was about to land on me, I turned around and stabbed her in the heart with the Black Oak Stake.

As I crawled away from her, she started to laugh maniacally as she burst into flames and dissolved in the ground. Even though I was relieved that it was over, it took the deaths of four people to realize that it was my fault for not hearing Raziel’s story. And even though I didn’t deserve it, Raziel still risked his life to save me.

The next day: my boss hailed me as a hero for protecting the store from those three criminals shooting up the place. The outside footage was the only footage that was available. And then I realized that Lily was hiding in the security room and disabled the cameras. Then once I told her everything was okay, the outside camera was the only thing that was working.

Once I got my paycheck, I decided to quit my job. So I can become a paranormal investigator, to make sure incidents like this can never happen again. And for Gabel and Raziel: It’s Time To Walk This Spiritual World and Cleanse These Demons.
