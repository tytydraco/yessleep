So, it’s me again, I managed to document other 4 Reports that my uncle have left behind, but I doubt I’ll be able to cover all of them before the FBI come and takes them away, hence why I started making copies of them to post here, hopefully they won’t find out….

This case really torn him apart you know

He was always a rather stoic type of guy, but after these cases he looked….
Different, broken even.

At family reunion he would barely speaks with anyone, his hands started to shake, he spaced out from time to time.

Nobody should go through whatever he saw at Basset, and I feel like covering all of this up would only make things worse

In case this is your first time seeing these posts, here’s a link to my previous entry.

There’s hasn’t been any sign of our killer since the death of Edwin Curley, but things have gotten hectic up there in Basset.

Journalist and paranormal investigators have come from all over the country to get their slimy little hands on some juicy informations

Me and Parch had to use the back door to get into the local precinct today to avoid the paparazzi.

However, something strange is happening outside the town.

While driving in today I saw a couple of trucks standing in the fields, I didn’t see anything, but it’s weird to see a vehicle parked in a cornfield in the middle of nowhere.

We should give that spot a check, but in the meantime we should focus on studying that book and interview the owner of the murdered pets.

The book hasn’t given much information, nobody on the force is knowledgeable enough on the subject as the late mr Curley, but Parch made an interesting observation regarding some of the stories around the skin walker.

Apparently the myth revolves around a witch doctor that uses the flailed skin of their victims to take on their appearance, Parch believes that our killer is doing something similar harvesting our victims organ’s though for what purpose it’s still unclear to us.

The book doesn’t seem to mention any ritual revolving around sacrificing organs, but maybe our theory could be confirmed by some expert out in the big cities.

I’ll get in touch with some of my contacts in Omaha, somebody might be able to find a history professor interest in the matter.

Detective Bruce Portland

We’ve interviewed two of the three owners of the murdered pets and the killer hasn’t made their move yet.

I don’t like it, if he’s performing a ritual of sorts they’re certainly planning for something, if only we knew what their inspiration is we could be 2 steps ahead of them.

Me and Parch went over to the field were I saw those trucks, they were still there, abandoned without their plates.

They’re nothing special really, I’m surprised they’re even working properly considering how run down they are, but they haven’t been here for long a couple of days maybe judging by the tracks left on the ground.

There are two sets of footprints, most likely the two drivers, one of the trucks was carrying lumber and the other has some white dust all over the back, the boys at the labs will figure what that’s about.

Two trucks appear out of nowhere without even a plate, right after a particularly gruesome murder covered by a wave of nosy reporters, there’s no way that’s a coincidence.

The people we interviewed weren’t of much use. One was an old lady that couldn’t even hear a car exploding and the other one was wasted from his night at a bar.

The choice of target isn’t even that specific really, one was a 11 years old Chihuahua the other one was a parrot and the other was a gold fish.

The pet killings feel more like practice than a proper killing streak really, as sick as this sounds, testing their luck, studying the average security measures of Basset’s residents

He could be posing as some of the many journalists that came into town, better make an announcement about that. Those Vultures won’t like it but I need to keep at least these folks safe, making sure they don’t accidentally let the killer inside with the excuse of an interview.

As for these dumbasses looking for trouble, that can’t be helped, you can make all the announcement you want but some people just refuse to listen, the thrill of the big scoop or the millions of views can claud someone’s mind like the sight of El Dorado

We’ll at least try, but I’m afraid curiosity is gonna kill one of these cats, let’s hope we arrive in time to catch what killed them.

Another interview and another worthless conversation, and once again our guy is still waiting.

This is exhausting, I never had such a vast margin of interval between murders, what are they waiting for, did they get spooked by the journalists and moved somewhere else?
No, no there’s something that interests them in this town, and the trucks confirm this theory.

The lab is still trying to understand what’s that white dust on the back of one of them, but as of now we are at a dead end.

However we might have just gotten ourselves the perfect bait.

As Parch was patrolling around the edge of town he ran into a bunch of kids screaming towards the field.

The information he received from them might just help us jumpstart this case

The kids have been identified as Johnny Morowsky, Mabel Pwick and Jeffrey Boldwyn by officer Parch

D.Parch- Hey, Hey, you can’t stay here near the fields this late in the evenings kids

J.Morowsky- B-but we’re just playing a game…

M.Pwick- Yeah, we’re playing the Blue face game!

D.Parch- The what now?

J.Boldwyn- Yeah, Yeah the blue face game, you scream Blue face three times towards the field and he will come!

D.Parch- Like….. Bloody Mary?

M.Pwick- Yes! Like Bloody Mary! You want to play too?

D.Parch- Wait, hold on a sec little fellas, whose Blue face exactly?

J.Morowsky- T-the big scary man, that, that everyone’s been talking about….

D.Parch-What?! Why are trying to call him, don’t you know it’s dangerous to meddle with strangers, especially with THESE types of scary strangers.

J.Boldwyn- But he’s not scary! He’s super duper stupid!

M.Pwick- yeah he just fumbles and trips all the time….

D.Parch- What the hell are you talking about?! Whose been feeding you this bull…. ehm, these very….false information?

M.Pwick- Nah uh, Spooky Jay Jay did it and he beat him up!

D.Parch- *Sigh*, Who now?

J.Boldwyn- You don’t know Scary Jay Jay on YouTube? He does all sorts of cool things and, and fight all these scary monsters….

D.Parch- Those are NOT real! You shouldn’t believe everything you see on YouTube or the internet. I saw the guy! He hurt me really bad and I’m lucky to be here!

M.Pwick- But…..

D.Parch- A man has died! A man and three animals were killed by this monster and another one almost died!

J.Morowsky- S-someone died?….

D.Parch- Yes, Mr Curley, your history teacher didn’t you know?

M.Pwick- b-but mama said he went away….

D.Parch- I’m… I’m sorry kids, but your parents were only trying to protect you from the truth, there is a very bad person out there, and this “Scary Jay Jay” is nothing but a liar, and you can’t just go around lying to people like this because they’ll get hurt, understood.

M.Pwick, J.Morowsky, J.Boldwyn- understood mr officer.

D.Parch- alright, let me drive you back home, your parents must be worried sick….

So, Jason “Scary Jay Jay” Caroline, the guy’s one hell of a piece of work, two ongoing lawsuits for fraud, 5 years in prison for theft and aggravated assault and now he’s a “beloved” children influencer that specializes in scary content.

This might be a stretch, but someone like Jason perfectly fits the role of the bait, our killer doesn’t like it when people snoop around their haunting ground, and “Scary Jay Jay” doesn’t seem to grasp the cascade of trouble that’s coming his way.

A perfect storm in the making, we’ll keep an eye on him for a couple of days, he always films his videos during the night but seeing what happened to Edwin Curley, I don’t think our guy will hesitate in killing him and his crew in broad daylight

Let’s just hope we manage to get to him in time before “Blue Face” does.

Detective Bruce Portland

We had a visual on Jason and his crew for a while now, watching them annoy a couple of waiters at a bar, picking a fight with a couple of drunkards and so on and so forth

I never thought a YouTube video needed more than two people, but the guy had a small posse with him.

The vultures seem to be as active as ever too, some of them even got our same idea.

Jason’s attempt at fame combined with his past makes for a perfect outrage scoop, and it only makes things more difficult for us.

I was starting to think this was a bad idea, with all these people around their prey the killer will never make their move and might change their hunting ground.

But after looking at one of his videos I realized something

We never described the killer’s appearance to the masses since we didn’t had a clear idea of what it looked like other than our encounter in the attic, and yet, the costume Jason’s used in his videos was frighteningly similar to the blurry image that I saw.

Black robes and a blue wooden mask, resembling like, a smiling smiling eclipse, I think, it’s very tribal looking with a crooked smiled covered with small wooden teeth.
The eye holes looks very small and poorly made, as if someone curved them out with a knife from the already finished mask

Following this guy around will bring us nowhere, we needed to talk him immediately.

This is the transcription of my interview with Jason Caroline

B.Portland- Morning Mr Caroline, you know why you here?

J.Caroline- Nah, but my lawyer would be interested to know that

B.Portland- your not the culprit today Jason, you’re already dealing with two lawsuit, I wouldn’t want to bother your lawyer even further

J.Caroline- then why the fuck are ya bothering me for, I’ve got a video to shoot man!

B.Portland- All in due time Jason, first I’ve got to ask you a couple of questions about your “Blue Face” videos

J.Caroline- Oh come on man, not this bullshit again!

B.Portland- what bullshit? Did somebody asked you about it beforehand

J.Caroline- Yeah! Those fuckin’ limp dicks reporters are all up in my ass. Some Nobody just died, who cares! People die all the time and tons of Content creators talk about it.
What’s so special about this one guy that everyone is all up in arms for, it’s not like it’s the first time I’m doing this kind of stuff

B.Portland- That nobody, as you called him, was dissected alive after the perpetrator took his brother’s kidney

J.Caroline- ……

B.Portland- We think he was killed because he started looking into his brother’s assault, and found something he shouldn’t have.
Sounds familiar? Because that’s very similar to what you’re doing at night in the fields…

J.Caroline- W-wait hold on man, a-are you saying I could be next?! W-Why, what have I done them man, there’s plenty of fuckers around this shit hole snooping around, why me?!

B.Portland- Because of the costume jackass!
We never gave a description of the killer, hell we barely even saw it ourselves, and yet, the costume you’re using is a perfect match to the few informations we had of our suspect’s appearance with even more details.

J.Caroline- Fuck, shit, man, fuck! I-I didn’t know! I’m not in charge of the costume that’s my manager Sammy, he-he does all that creative stuff I’m just the face of the brand man!

B.Portland- Ok, calm down Jason, where’s Sammy now?

J.Caroline- I-I don’t know, he’s usually around the field looking for a spot to film the next video, I-I think he went up north, he said something about the moon giving off good mood light, I-I….

B.Portland- All right Jason, that’s enough, if what you say is true, Sammy might be a target as well, you need to call your crew and tell them to come to the precinct, this guy likes to hunt at night and it’s getting late

J.Caroline- y-yeah, I’ll do that now, I’ll do that now!

As expected, Sammy, real name Samuel Hopkins, 23, was the only member of the crew to not respond to the calls

That son of a bitch played us like a fiddle, the chances of finding Hopkins alive were scarce, but having a body to bring back to the lab would have still been useful for the investigations.

Eventually we found him, up north

This time the killer didn’t take their organs, they took his blood

He hanged upside down, on a cross made of logs, a tube inserted into his Aorta leading to what I assume was a large container judging by the marks on the ground, there’s no way one person was able to carry this on their own

The cross was complex in its design too, with intricate carvings and symbols, the victims legs were spread wide open, positioned perfectly to frame the moon, like the scope of a sniper rifle.

Our killer isn’t alone anymore
