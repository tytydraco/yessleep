Entry #1


I don’t know who’s going to read this. I don’t even know if this will reach anyone. But I have to try.

My name is Daniel. I’m a 47-year-old man, and I’m trapped in a village that doesn’t exist.

A few weeks ago, I got a letter. No return address, no postage. Just a single sheet of folded paper, slipped under my front door. The handwriting was familiar—Eleanor’s. My daughter.

She’s been missing for almost a year. Or at least, that’s what I thought. Until I read her letter:

-Dad,
I’m safe. Please don’t worry. I found my place.
If you want to see me, come alone. The path will show itself to you.-

It was Eleanor’s writing, down to the looping way she wrote her "y’s." I checked the locks on my front door twice, but I already knew—I would go.

I packed a bag, left a note for my brother in case I didn’t come back, and followed the instructions written in the margins.

Drive until the road turns to dirt.
Keep going until you see the trees arch.
When you hear the singing, you’re almost there.

It sounded ridiculous. But I swear to you—that’s exactly what happened.



The road went from paved to gravel to packed dirt until I was surrounded on all sides by endless trees. I should have turned back then. I should have realized there were no signs, no mile markers, no way to track how far I had come. But I kept driving, even when my GPS lost signal.

Then I saw it—the trees arching overhead.

It wasn’t natural. The way they curved toward each other, their branches stretching like fingers interlocking in prayer. It felt... constructed, as if something had told the trees to grow this way.

That’s when I heard it.

Singing.

Low voices, humming a tune I almost recognized but couldn’t quite place. It was coming from deep within the woods, pulling me forward.

I should have turned back. I should have turned the car around right there.

But I didn’t.

I kept going, and suddenly—the village was there.

It wasn’t a slow reveal. It wasn’t hidden by trees. One moment, there was only forest. And the next, I was staring at a town that shouldn’t have been there.

The buildings were old. Not "falling apart" old—preserved old. The kind of old where the wood looked too clean, the roofs too intact, like someone had built them centuries ago and then... stopped time.

And the people?

They were already waiting for me.



They stood at the center of the village, smiling.

Not in an eerie, forced way—in a way that felt too natural. The kind of smile you give a friend you haven’t seen in years. Like I was expected.

And then I saw her.

Eleanor.

She was standing among them, hands folded, calm as could be.

She looked different. Healthier, maybe. Or something else. Her skin had a glow to it, her hair was neatly braided down her back, her posture was straight.

And the strangest part?

She wasn’t surprised to see me.

I expected shock, relief, even anger that I had come uninvited. But she just smiled, the same way the rest of them did.

"Dad," she said softly. "You made it."

She walked up to me, hugged me like she hadn’t been missing for an entire year, like she had just seen me last week.

"What is this place?" I asked.

"Home," she said.

And she meant it.



Something Is Wrong Here

They gave me a place to stay. A small wooden house near the edge of the village. There’s no electricity, no running water, and yet...I have cell service.

I don’t know how. There’s no WiFi, no towers anywhere nearby, but somehow—I can post this. I can reach you.

I’ve tried calling. No calls go through. No texts send. GPS won’t load, and my location just shows blank space.

It’s like I’m nowhere.

Eleanor told me not to worry. She says I’ll understand soon.

Understand what?

The people here pray, but not to the God I know. They read from the Bible, but the words are different.

-“And He will come forth from the trees, to judge the pure from the tainted.”
“And His mouth will open, and His will shall be known.”-

Their priest—an old man with silver hair—watched me the entire time during their evening prayer. And when it ended, he walked up to me and pressed his hand to my shoulder.

"You are blessed to witness it."

"Witness what?" I asked.

He only smiled.

And then I heard it again.

The singing.

Not from the church. From the trees.

It was louder this time. Closer.

Eleanor isn’t afraid. She says I shouldn’t be either.

But I am.

Because I don’t think I can leave.

Because when I walked to the tree line today, the village was behind me.

And when I turned back, expecting to see the village again—it was gone.

Just trees. Endless trees.

And when I turned around again?

I was standing right back where I started.

I don’t know where I am. I don’t know what’s happening.

But I think the forest knows me now.

And I think it’s watching
