Odd-Jobs. That was the name both for what I was and for what I was asked to do. I worked for numerous clients on all spectrums of the law. The basic gist of what I did was that I would be asked to do was to “take care” of certain things that the client wanted out of the way. I wasn’t exactly a hitman, not always. Sometimes I would be asked to destroy evidence convicting a certain criminal, plant evidence on a public official, dispose of bodies, act as an impromptu bodyguard for a drug kingpin and shoot him in the back to advance a crooked cop’s career—basically, if someone wanted a thing done that society frowned upon, they called people like me and paid us with a less-than-glamorous salary. I’m not going to try to justify myself; what I did was illegal and in many cases unethical. Even if I hurt bad people, I wasn't a vigilante, let alone a hero by any stretch; I was a bad guy, to put it mildly. But even bad guys know real evil when we see it. And what I saw in Seattle, Washington on February 16, 2014 was nothing short of evil. And seeing true evil? It has a way of making you re-evaluate things: your ideals, personality, empathy, your place in the world—all of it can change when you understand what evil is. 

I’m getting ahead of myself. As I said, I was in Seattle on February 16, 2014. My client—let’s call them J—had asked me to look for four people that I’ll call as Alpha, Beta, Epsilon, and Omega. These people were all scum, to put it lightly, and that’s coming from me. These people’s crimes ran the gamut from grand theft to arms dealing to human trafficking and many things in between, though Omega was an enigma. J, as you can probably guess, had asked me to kill them. Odd-Jobs never used the word “kill” or any other such terms; we had special code phrases. “Window cleaning” was “gathering blackmail material”, “gardening” was “planting incriminating evidence”, “dishwashing” was “disposal”, and “mowing” was “assassination.” So when I was offered an advance of $40,000,000 with $60,000,000 to follow for “mowing four lawns,” I knew something was off. Clearly someone had a lot of money to throw around, and they really wanted these people dead. I wish I had left the advance in that dead drop, let some other schmuck take it and use it. 

I had a contact of mine smuggle several weapons and other tools I would need to accomplish this. These included several knives, handguns with suppressors fitted to them, two sniper rifles, and a variety of poisons. Once I had all of my tools in place, I set out to find my first target. I was given leeway to eliminate targets in whatever order I chose, so long as I left Omega for last. I chose Gamma as the first. He was a high-end drug dealer who loved to break the Scarface rule of “don’t get high on your own supply.” Naturally, killing him was quite easy. I subtly snuck 1200 milligrams of potassium cyanide into his sizable cocaine stash, then watched from a distance. I watched as he snorted, then as he began to convulse before going still. 

Once he was dead, I moved on to Alpha. Alpha was a gun-runner, and he was in the middle of an arms deal in an abandoned train station. My plan of killing him was a pretty risky one, as it involved “informing” the client that Alpha intended to have them killed and vice versa, then hiding on a nearby rooftop with a sniper rifle aimed at Alpha’s head. As it turned out, I wouldn't need it; the client took care of that for me. 

Epsilon was a unique case. It would be inaccurate to say he specialized in cybercrime; he made it an art form. If you had information online and he decided you needed to be doxxed or blackmailed he would do it. That was what he did when he was bored, though; when he was “at work”, he was sabotaging computer systems worldwide, causing blackouts, controlling drones—if it was electronic, he could get to it. It took me checking most of the computer tech stores in Seattle, but eventually, I was able to get a description of a man who matched Epsilon’s appearance. Once I had obtained camera footage, it took no time to break into his ratty apartment and shoot him with a suppressed pistol. Before leaving, I looked over his files. I found something odd. It was a transcription of an indignant conversation between himself and an undisclosed party. Apparently, despite none of the the targets knowing each other, he was part of a plan involving Omega. He didn’t go into details, but he was saying he wanted out. I didn't think anything of it at the time, just focused on Beta and Omega. 

Beta was the most directly related person to Omega: his bodyguard. A slender but deceptively strong man, he immediately found me as I was casing Omega’s penthouse. He threw me and began beating me like I had pissed on his grandmother’s grave. His fists were like sledgehammers as he punched me twice in the chest, then grabbed my face and slammed my head against the wall, causing stars to flash across my vision. He raised his boot to stomp my face in before I drew my knife in the nick of time. He screamed as the blade impaled his foot. I took advantage, raising my suppressed pistol and firing at his face. I then burst into the penthouse door, only to be stunned by what I saw. The room was lavishly decorated, but sitting in a wheelchair hooked up to an oxygen tank was a man in his 90s. On his neck was a distinctive mark: Omega. 

Beaten down and exhausted, I didn’t think. I just shot him there and then. That was when I heard it.

It was a baby. Slowly creeping my way towards the sound, I pushed the door open to find a crib with an infant inside. Next to the crib were the child’s parents, butchered mercilessly. Then I saw the thing that changed the entire job. The baby stopped crying, then looked up at me and smiled. There was nothing innocent about that smile, though. His eyes changed from blue to green, the same as the old man, and on his neck, the Omega mark formed. 

Instinctively I began to raise my pistol, but stopped myself. I didn’t know what the fuck had just happened, I didn’t know how this had been accomplished, but all I knew now was that, evil old man or not, I couldn't do it. I couldn't shoot him, stab him, suffocate him with a pillow—he was in the one form even the filthiest Odd-Job would shy away from. He seemed to know it too, because he giggled as I lowered my gun and left the penthouse. I made an anonymous tip to the police about hearing a ruckus in the floor above me, and I let that be that. I received my payment, and I retired from being an Odd-Job. 

Now in 2025, I’ve been able to move on for the most part. At least, I thought I had until yesterday. Yesterday, a well-dressed boy with brown hair and blue eyes walked up to me and said my name. I stopped short, asking him how he knew me. He said that his uncle, J, had told him all about me. Then he winked knowingly and walked away. As he turned, I saw it on his neck.

The Omega.
