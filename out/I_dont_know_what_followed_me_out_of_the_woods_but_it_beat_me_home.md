Last night I decided to walk home instead of waiting for the bus. It was late, I was tired, and the idea of just putting one foot in front of the other felt easier than standing around under the flickering streetlights.

There is a set of woods between my place and the main road. I had cut through them once before during the day and it knocked nearly twenty minutes off the walk. I told myself I knew the path. I told myself it would be fine.

At night, the woods are not the same.

The trees crowd closer. The air feels heavier, damp, like it is clinging to your skin. Even the ground seems different. Softer somehow, like you are not walking on dirt but something that remembers every step you take.

I had my phone light in one hand and my keys in the other. I walked quickly, eyes locked on the narrow trail. The usual night noises felt distant, muffled. No owls. No foxes. Not even the rustle of leaves. Just me and the crunch of my shoes.

That was when I noticed something strange.

Every so often I glanced behind me. Normal habit. But each time, I saw my shadow on the path. Which should have been impossible.

I froze and turned in a slow circle. The canopy blocked the moon. There were no streetlamps, no houses, no passing cars. Nothing that could have cast a shadow that sharp.

And yet there it was, long and stretched across the ground. Mine.

I thought maybe my phone light was stronger than I realised, so I switched it off. The screen went black. I stood in total darkness.

The shadow stayed.

I felt the hairs rise on my arms. My stomach flipped. I crouched, touched the dirt with my hand just to make sure my eyes weren’t playing tricks. The shadow crouched too. For a second I almost laughed in relief. Maybe I was just overthinking.

Then it raised its hand before I did.

It waved.

I do not remember making the decision to run. One second I was frozen, staring at that impossible gesture, and the next I was sprinting down the trail with branches tearing at my face and arms. My lungs burned. My heart hammered. But worse than any of that was the sound that followed me.

Something was running too.

Not in boots. Not in shoes. It sounded wet. Bare feet slapping into mud. Fast. Heavy. Right behind me.

I didn’t dare look back. I just pushed harder, legs screaming as the path twisted and blurred in the dark. The noise grew louder, closer, until I could almost feel breath on the back of my neck.

I burst out of the trees so suddenly I almost fell into the road. A car horn blared as headlights swept past, and I stumbled into the grass, chest heaving, body shaking.

The woods behind me were silent. The path was empty.

I stood there for a long time, trying to convince myself I had imagined it. Stress. Exhaustion. Maybe I had nodded off on the bus before and dreamt the whole thing. Anything to explain away the memory of that wave, that awful sound chasing me through the dark.

Eventually I forced myself to keep walking, sticking to the main road all the way home. Every streetlight felt like safety. Every passing car made me breathe easier. By the time I reached my front door, I had almost managed to calm down.

Then I saw the light on in my bedroom window.

I knew I had switched it off before leaving.

I stepped inside, forcing myself to breathe slow and steady. The house was quiet. Too quiet. I made my way down the hall toward my room, every nerve in my body screaming for me to stop, to turn around, to leave.

But I had to know.

Through the narrow gap under the door, I could see it. A shadow stretched across the carpet. The shadow of someone standing perfectly still inside my room.

Waiting. 

I slept on the sofa last night.

I can’t go in there. I can’t
