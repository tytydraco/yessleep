As I sit there, trying to think clearly and put sense into the unbelievable events, I still try to hear some stories of that unfortunate night: my mind keeps dragging back to the abandoned hospital, the walls, and the unutterable horror that was hidden behind them. I can smell the stench of decay, the rusted medical equipment, and eerie silence that swallowed us whole. It's like my brain is trying to protect me from the truth, but I know I have to confront it head-on. I have to share my story in the hopes that it may serve as a warning to others, a cautionary tale about the dangers of meddling with forces beyond our understanding.

It started innocently enough. My friends and I, all avid urban explorers, heard the whisper of an abandoned hospital built at the end of town. Rumors spread that it was a hotspot for paranormal activity, but we didn't believe them. We are skeptics, thrill-seekers, and photographers trying to capture the eerie beauty of the abandoned hospital. For weeks, we planned, prepared equipment, and researched the history about this abandoned hospital. It was a relic of the past, abandoned for decades. We were drawn to its mystery, its decay, and dark allure. There were 10 of us in our group: all equipped with cameras, night vision gear, and a sense of adventure. We arrived at the hospital at midnight, our flashlights casting flickering shadows on the crumbling walls. The building loomed before us, its spires and turrets reaching up towards the moon like skeletal fingers. We approached the entrance, our hearts racing with anticipation. The front doors creaked ominously as we pushed them open, revealing a dimly lit foyer that seemed to stretch on forever.



As we ventured deeper into the hospital, strange noises began echoing through the corridors. We dismissed them as the creaks and groans of an old building, but soon the sounds became louder, more menacing. We heard whispers, footsteps, and distant screams. The air was thick with tension, and we couldn't shake the feeling that we were being watched. It was as if the hospital itself was alive, watching us, waiting for us to make a wrong move. We tried to shake off the feeling, telling ourselves it was just our imagination, but deep down, we knew it was something more. We set up our equipment, trying to capture evidence of the paranormal activity. But as we filmed, the atmosphere grew increasingly oppressive, the shadows deepening into dark, malevolent entities. It was as if we were being herded towards some unknown fate, trapped in a living nightmare from which we couldn't awaken.



It began in the bathroom. One of my friends, Alex, found an eerie, childlike voice whispering and wailing. The sound sent chills down our spines, and we quickly gathered around Alex, trying to locate the source of the voice. But as we listened, the voice grew louder, more urgent, and Alex's eyes began to glaze over. He stumbled backwards, his hands clutching his neck, and collapsed to the floor, dead. We were in shock, unable to comprehend what had just happened. The voice stopped, the silence deafening, and we were left staring at Alex's lifeless body. Panic set in. We frantically searched for a way out, but the hospital seemed to shift and twist around us, like a living, breathing entity. Another friend, Jake, tried to flee, but he tripped and fell from the fifth-floor window. We heard his screams echoing through the corridors as he plummeted to his death. The rest of us were paralyzed with fear, unable to move or speak. We huddled together waiting for dawn to rescue us.

However, in the night's deep hours the hospital seemed more terrible and foreboding; so we slowly walked out, beaten and wounded on both levels: body and mind. And still, as a unit we had Jake with us, we dressed him up in a clean sheet of white but as I rode away and peered backward something caught in my eye made blood run chilled. Empty sat the white sheet. We wildly searched, with no sign of Jake's body. It felt as if he had been engulfed by the hospital, dragging him back deep into its darkness. The couple of us determined to go into the hospital so that we'd uncover the reality concerning this whole thing while following Jake's trail, making the corridors leading us deeper to the bowels of the hospital seem endless in their stretch. We found ourselves in rooms of rusted medical equipment, where the stench of decay weighed heavily in the air. With every step, it was like walking into the heart of madness.



It was then we chanced upon Alex, or what remained of him. He was sitting in a contorted pose reciting some ancient incantation; his eyes were as dark as coal. Snakes were slithering around him, it was as if summoned by his words. We tried to reach out to him, but he started drinking the snakes' blood; his eyes began glowing with an otherworldly sheen. We made a run for it, devastated, but Alex began chasing us, taking us on a wild goose chase throughout the hospital.



We finally understood that Alex had cheated us, made us come to the very spot where our bad dream had originated. The hospital was playing this twisted game on us, just tormenting the hell out of us with this fear and this despair. Trapped we were, with no way to break free.



Then, I caught a glimpse. A sign above the wall; it read: "Welcome to Ravenswood Hospital". I felt myself going backwards, my brain reeling and spinning.



"No, it's not possible", I whispered.



But as I looked around, I realized the horrifying truth. We had never escaped the hospital. We were still trapped, still being tormented by the malevolent forces that lurked within.



And then, I heard the sound of footsteps, echoing down the corridor.



"Shit, here we are again."
