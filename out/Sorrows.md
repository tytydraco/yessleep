She looked just like my mother.

That's what I thought when I saw her crouching in the gutter, vomiting God-knows-what into the road. The streetlights illuminated a gaunt figure with stringy blonde hair, pale skin and a huge patchwork cardigan. My mother had been a kindergarten teacher before cancer took her. She always wore bright, soft clothing like that, even on her days off.

I don’t usually approach homeless people. Maybe that makes me a bad person, but you hear all these scams about people begging then getting into a brand-new Mercedes when the night falls. Or wasting their money on booze and drugs. My mother would never have done any of those things. I think that’s why I approached her.

“Excuse me… are you okay?” was the most stupid question I could’ve asked, but I went with it anyway. Up close, she looked a bit less like my mother. Her green eyes were darker, and she had a thin, pale scar stretching from the top of her eyebrow to the beginnings of her hairline.

“Do I look okay to you?” is something my mother would definitely have said back. My face reddened. The woman - *not my mother*, I tried to remember - wiped her mouth on her sleeve, as though I wasn’t there.

“Well, should I take you to see a doctor…?” Up close, she looked about as exhausted and miserable as any person I have ever seen. The bags under her eyes were heavy and dark. When she belched, I saw a couple of teeth were missing.

“I’d rather have a roof over my head. These nights are cold, you know.” She stopped and gave me a long once-over. I was wearing a thick fleece jacket, gloves, and a scarf knitted by my best friend. My arms were laden with gifts bought for the festive season. My face turned even redder. I felt like a glutton under the gaze of this woman who I’d only just met.

The woman stood up and stepped closer. This close, she reeked of unwashedness and a stale something I couldn’t place. But there was something else underneath. Lavender. Beneath the dirt, she had the exact same scent as my mother’s old lavender perfume.

“Poppy Poppet, have you got a place for me to stay?” Her whisper was hoarse but kind.

Poppy Poppet. I hadn’t heard that nickname since the day my mother died.



\*\*\*



I set her up in the guest room, making sure the nicest sheets were on the bed. It’s a small room, but cosy enough with room for the odd bits and bobs the woman had brought with her. Somehow, I hadn’t noticed her bag at first. It was huge, more like Santa’s sack than anything. It contained blankets, small bags of snacks, tobacco, and some strange things, too. Like a crumpled picture of a woman and her child, too blurry to make out any strong details. But the child had bobbed blonde hair and a pink dress I remembered throwing a fit about wearing when I was seven years old. Inside a small Ziploc bag, she kept a small cluster of baby teeth. I tried not to stare at them too much, but of course she noticed.

“From a little girl who looks just like you,” she said, cackling. “I reckon if I plant them some day, something might grow.”

The other things were equally bizarre. There was a clay figure of a fox, missing an ear, wrapped in newspaper. My mother had loved watching the foxes in our garden at dawn, running back towards the woods. Had I made a clay fox for her, once?

Finally, she had a small coin purse. Inside were… coins, of course. But also some other things. A tiny square of paper folded many times. I was too polite to ask to see, but again, she saw me looking.

“This?” she asked. “This, now, is my most prized possession. Since you’re so nice and gave me a room, I’ll show it to you.”

When she unfolded the picture, my heart leapt into my throat. It was a child’s drawing of a woman with bright yellow hair and green eyes. She wore a rainbow jumper, baby blue jeans and had bright orange circles for feet. In one hand, she held an ice cream cone dripping onto the floor. In the other, she held the hand of a familiar little girl.

MUMMY I LOVE YOU FOREVER FROM POPPY.

I didn’t need to see the wax scribbles to remember that day in art class. I had been upset because Danny Keenan had broken the best green crayon, so I had to use a different shade for my mothers eyes. I also remembered taking it home to share with my mother. I was bursting with pride when she pinned it to the refrigerator.

LOVE YOU FOREVER. The woman didn’t say anything. She just smiled.



\*\*\*



She stayed in my house for six days. During that time, she was a model guest. That first day, I woke up thinking she must’ve robbed me in my sleep, or would be waiting around the door with a kitchen knife and my wallet in hand. Neither of those things happened. Instead, I woke up to the smell of freshly-cooked bacon. She raided the fridge, and put together an almost-passable English breakfast. Just like my mother - never too good at cooking.

We settled into a routine quite quickly. She left the house when I went to work. I never dared ask where she went, but she always came back with her coin purse a little heavier. Some days, she came back with stranger things. One was another small photograph in black and white, of a little boy and his white-haired grandmother. “Cried when giving me that,” she announced proudly through a mouthful of cottage pie. Another was a child’s plastic charm bracelet, with pink and purple beads spelling out the name JENNIFER. She didn’t want to talk about that one at all, and buried it at the bottom of her sack.

But every night, the woman vomited - around midnight, some perverse Cinderella’s curse. Before I fell asleep, I would hear her run to the bathroom to throw up whatever she had eaten. It reminded me of my mother’s long days of chemotherapy. A few times, I called out to see if she was okay, but never received a response. Perhaps she was sick and too embarrassed to tell me? I considered calling a doctor, but really, she seemed perfectly well at all other times. Maybe she had an anxious stomach? I tried to bury it in the back of my mind.

Those six days seem like a blur now. It felt like I had my mother back. The first day, I was at the village shop right as it opened and bought lavender-scented everything - soap, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, the works. After she showered, my house reeked of my mother’s scent. I also gave her a few things to keep her busy - a romantic novel my mother had read a hundred times while waiting for chemotherapy, and a pair of slippers she’d worn around the house for as long as I could remember without them ever getting faded or dirty. The woman accepted these gifts like treasures, but she never asked what they meant. Sometimes, I thought I saw tears in her eyes.

I never thought to ask for her name. The answer seemed so clear in my head.

On the sixth day, I took the day off work and cooked my mother’s favourite meal - roast beef, potatoes, vegetables, Yorkshire puddings and thick gravy. For dessert, I spent hours carefully re-reading her old recipe book to make the cake she’d always prepared on my birthday. It was chocolate, filled with jam and cream, and covered in small red and white piped flowers. Instead of an age, however, I just piped the word MOTHER.

That’s the only time I ever saw the woman look angry - but just for a second. It flashed into her eyes so quickly, I thought I had mistaken it. But her mouth hardened into a line and her eyes seemed to tear up again. Quickly, I realised she wasn’t angry with me. Somehow, she seemed angry at herself.

“Mothe– I mean, sorry, is everything okay?”

“Yes, Poppy Poppet,” she said, thought the smile on her face seemed to tremble. “You have done me good - ever so well. Any mother would be proud to have a daughter like you.”

I couldn’t hide the happiness in my face. I only wished that hers didn’t look so tired. I almost asked the question - almost. But something was still stopping me.

It didn’t matter. On the seventh day, the woman told me everything.



\*\*\*



“I’m not your mother, Poppy.”

The woman spoke while buttering some lightly-burned toast the next morning. I was halfway through a mouthful of baked beans. Trying not to choke, I struggled to answer.

“W-What?”

“Look. I know I look just like her. We have the same habits and clothes. Hell, I even smell like her now, thanks to you. But I am not your mother.” Her smile was the kindest and most painful I have ever seen. “I am so grateful to you, and so, so sorry. But I can’t be her forever.”

My mind was racing. I remembered a hundred little things. When she read the romance novel, she folded the corners of the pages just like my mother used to do (to my deep annoyance). Neither of them could cook anything without it coming out a little bit wrong. Her cardigan was identical to one my mother wore in a school photo - secretly, I had scoured through photo albums and found the match. They both had a slightly nasal laugh, brushed their hair behind their ears with the same gesture, belched like pigs after a good meal and didn’t care for anything cooked too spicy. They wore the same size clothes and shoes - before my mother’s chemotherapy, I mean. Blonde hair and green eyes. The baby teeth. The drawing. POPPY POPPET.

“But the drawing?”

“It shows you whatever you want to see, darling. Take another look.” She took out the same piece of paper and held it in front of my face.

“Think of your happiest memory. Something that always brings joy to your face. Go on.”

As I thought, the crayon scribbles seemed to rearrange themselves. I saw myself, my mother and my father on a trip to the zoo. My parents had bought me a stuffed lemur almost as big as myself. I had wrapped the striped tail around my neck like a scarf. My father was doing impressions of the animals to make us laugh. My mother wore the same cardigan as her kindergarten days, and held ice cream cones for all of us.

“H-How is this possible–”

“Now think of your worst memory. The one that still breaks your heart, again and again. You know it.”

I didn’t want to, but it flooded back so fast I could barely keep up with the flowing crayon scribbles. First I saw my father, lying in a hospital bed after the accident. He’d been crushed by a forklift at work. His lower half was covered by many thick blankets to stop me seeing the gore, but a little blood seeped through. He’d wanted to see me one last time, knowing he was too hurt to survive.

Next, of course, was my mother. The sight of so many tubes and wires attached to her, like Medusa’s snakes, turned me to stone. I couldn’t look away from the beeping of the machines, or the paleness of her face, or the baldness of her head that looked so vulnerable beneath the fluorescent hospital lights. I wish someone had given her a cap to cover it.

Tears ran down my face into my breakfast. The woman was crying too, but her sadness was strange. I was a mess of tears and snot, but her tears ran down her face perfectly straight. Her nose didn’t run, nor did her eyes look red. It was as though she had a computer animation running on her face.

“We call ourselves the Sorrows. We come from nowhere, and we have nobody and nothing. We don’t know what we are. We live as humans, and change to meet how humans wish to perceive us. For some, it’s their parents, others, even their children or ex-lovers. It’s the only way we can receive any kindness in this cold, cold world.”

I thought of every poor street beggar I had ever turned my nose up to. I thought of Not-My-Mother, vomiting into the gutter like a round of chemo gone bad.

“Why do this? Why pretend to be my mother? *How* can you do this?”

“It’s how we survive. It’s remarkably easy to get any information from your brains. I know all of your likes and dislikes. I could describe any life story in great detail. For example, your sixteenth birthday. Your mother had baked a cake, just like the one you made yesterday for me. But you were angry because of an argument with your best friend, and wanted to cancel the party altogether. Your mother tried to be patient, but in the end, both of you were yelling at each other. When the first guests arrived, you were still arguing, but half an hour later with the party in full swing, you had forgiven each other completely.”

I sniffled. “And then?”

“And then your best friend arrived an hour late. Amy was never on time, but she had brought you a present. Two, actually. One was a kids friendship necklace - two hearts that fit together, as an ironic kind of apology. The other was a CD you’d been wanting for months. You gave her the biggest slice of birthday cake, and turned your living room into a nightclub filled with dancing and the smallest glasses of wine.”

I could feel the gift paper pressed into my hands. The pounding of that year’s most popular song echoed in my ears. Amy, always smelling of vanilla perfume, had her hands on my shoulders as we slow-danced, giggling and pretending to be madly in love. Only I wasn’t quite pretending.

“People like you are kind, but you’d never let any old stranger into your home. I understand that. Humans can be dangerous. But you also turn your eyes from us on the streets. If I were an old man, would you stop to see me vomit in the road? If I were a runaway, would you offer me money or a hotel room to stay in?”

I didn’t need to answer. My shame spoke for me.

“You are kind to me because you want your mother back. That doesn’t mean you are a cruel or ungenerous person. It simply makes you human. But I can’t bring her back. Your mother will always be dead. And I really am just a Sorrow. I can’t stay here forever.”

My head snapped up. “What? Why not?” I gestured to the kitchen scene around us. We looked as comfortably domestic as any mother and daughter. “We could pretend. You’d have a roof over your head, and maybe I’d have… have a family…”

The shaking of her head broke my heart again. “You’d start to notice the cracks. The parts of me that aren’t quite like her. You still don’t like to see my scar, do you?” I blushed. It was true. I always averted my eyes from the thin line striping her face. “And darling, my eyes will never, ever be green enough. These are all little things. But I promise. Those would increase in time.”

She smiled sadly. Her face showed more compassion than I deserved.

My grief was a physical thing, just like it had been when my mother really died. It felt like hands were gripping my heart, and squeezing out all the good and bad memories of my mother with it. The strength of it made it hard to breathe as I fell back into my chair, willing the memories to either stop or take me away for good.

“So what will you do now?” I was surprised I could even manage the words.

The woman finished eating her toast. “Today, I will go walking again. Tonight, I will pack my things and leave in the morning. It is time for me to move on. But it has been lovely knowing you, Poppy Poppet.”

She rose from the table and began to wash the dishes - the best china, I’d set out especially for her. I stayed put, my mouth now shut tight, thick tears still leaking from swollen eyes. I was only vaguely aware of the woman moving around the kitchen - drying dishes, scraping away the abandoned food from my plate, and finally fishing out some tissues to dry my eyes.

I blew my nose and looked up at her face. Her scar seemed more severe than before. Would that make it easier, if I focused on all of the wrongness and none of the right?

I still had a hundred questions to ask the woman. At this time, I chose only one.

“Why do you go walking?”

The woman stood still. Emotions played over her face like a child flicking through a flipbook.

“Sorrows like us need to eat, and not your ordinary kind of food. It’s best if you don’t ask too much.”

A few minutes later, the woman was ready to go walking. I stood by the gate and waved her goodbye. She was wearing my mother’s cardigan, and clutching an empty sack.



\*\*\*



Before the woman left that night, I crept into her room. I knew she was awake and could see me. I didn’t care. I tiptoed over and opened the sack she had filled with belongings again.

I saw some of the same things. Blankets, baby teeth, the drawing that showed my mother again. Also some new things. A man’s watch, old but still ticking. A thin wad of cash. A generic greetings card that looked like it had been written in a hurry, with a fifty-pound note folded inside.

And then, some scraps of clothing. They looked like t-shirts and jeans, all covered with blood and bits of gore. Someone - or something - had been torn into bits, from the looks of things. I considered asking. I didn’t.

Holding back tears, I added my own bundle to the sack. A bottle of lavender perfume. A box of the biscuits my mother had always bought whenever they went on sale. A bottle of red wine, gifted to us one Christmas and still untouched. A bundle of her t-shirts and long, flowing skirts. And of course, the patchwork cardigan.

When I left the next morning, it was as though the room had never been touched at all.



\*\*\*



I’ve met other Sorrows since then. I try to give a little money or food to any homeless person I see. Sometimes, it’s clear they’re drunk or on drugs. I don’t let it bother me. We all have our demons, but we still deserve care.

I met some familiar faces there, too. One looked like Amy. She also stayed for six days. We talked about the argument we’d had that birthday - how I’d had a huge crush on her, but she was as straight as a ruler. I found the matching friendship necklace she’d bought and wore it under my shirt. We made mooncakes together and talked about how much she’d missed me as a child when she went back to Taiwan every summer. She even taught me a little Mandarin. After the Sorrow left, I called the real Amy for the first time in years. She’s married now, with twin sons and a wonderful husband who volunteers at a homeless shelter. I still haven’t found the nerve to ask him about the Sorrows.

Another Sorrow I met looked like my grandfather. I only knew him for the first few years of my life. When I think of him, I remember the smell of peppermint sweets and the endless carpentry he’d do in his garage. We spent a lot of time together doing things we never had a chance to do - him “teaching” me how to drive, hearing his own father’s stories about the war, and me learning a hundred little stories from discovering his love of carpentry to discovering his love for my grandmother. After his six days, he left me an immaculately carved wooden poppy on my kitchen table.

I never tried to look through their things. Sometimes they came home with blood on their clothes. Each Sorrow apologised profusely, and I never saw so much as a speck when it was time to do the laundry. It took a lot of effort not to wonder where it came from.



\*\*\*



When the last Sorrow left, I followed him.

He looked like my uncle. The oldest child of his generation, he’d passed away in my teens after a life of excitement. I remembered him as short, dark-skinned, pot-bellied and with thick, bleached-blonde hair that never seemed to thin or turn grey. He always wore the same jacket to family reunions - purple suede; we always jokingly compared him to Prince. We had parties every night for the six days we spent together. He drank enough wine to drown a man, and showed me drinking games even my university days hadn’t taught me. Even with his stature, he danced effortlessly with the grace of a rockstar too cool to acknowledge the audience cheering at his feet. He always called my Pops, never Poppy, and made jokes about the heavy-lidded eyes and strong jaw I’d inherited from my father.

I didn’t plan to follow him. I just did. After I heard the door close that seventh morning, I put on my warm winter jacket and packed a bag full of warm blankets and snacks, just in case I met any homeless people on the way. The thick snow falling from the sky made it easy to follow his footsteps from a distance. The air was so chill, I shivered in my winter coat. I doubted the Sorrow’s purple suede was enough to keep him warm.

But as he walked, he seemed to *blur*. It happened like my glasses were steaming up after entering a hot room. He grew taller and thinner, and the purple suede jacket faded into a thin, navy shirt. His hair was grey and straggly. I couldn’t see his face, but I knew it had to be creased with wrinkles.

Was this the Sorrow’s true form? Even from a blurred distance, the pity I felt for him was overwhelming. He looked just like any elderly man with nowhere to go, bumbling about the streets of the city. Eventually he stopped outside a coffee shop and put down his sack beside a nearby bench. It had bars built in, so he couldn’t lie down. Instead, he took out a blanket and wrapped it around his shoulders. Entering the coffee shop, he had a short conversation with the barista. I could see the sympathy on her face. She gave him two cups - one steaming with coffee, and the other empty. When he settled on the bench outside, he left the empty cup perched in the snow before him. He didn’t need to write a message.

I walked over to him and unzipped my backpack. Silently, I gave him another blanket, a packet of crisps and a handful of coins. He nodded slowly and said nothing. I went into the café and chose a window seat.

Lots of the people walking by paid the Sorrow no interest, even as the snow gathered upon his shoulders. Still, some were kind. One carefully dumped the snow out of his coffee cup and wiped the coins inside dry with her scarf. Another helped him shake his blanket free of snow. Some gave him loose change, and twice he was given drinks from the coffee shop. But a few of the passers-by seemed to recognise him.



The first one looked like she’d been hit by a truck. She was an older woman, with thick black hair and dark eyes. The moment she saw him, she stopped dead. People complained as they moved around her. The Sorrow himself had changed so fast, it took me a moment to notice his own thick black hair and olive skin.



The woman babbled something excitedly in Spanish and the Sorrow replied, laughing as though he weren’t sitting upon a freezing street. Though I understood little, it was clear she was offering to help. Strangely though, he seemed reluctant to follow her down the street. Eventually, the woman opened her purse and emptied the contents into his cup as the Sorrow thanked her profusely. Then, she took the scarf from her neck and wound it around his.

I made eye contact with the Sorrow as the woman left. He showed nothing on his face.

The other was a man who looked to be in his late sixties. He was a tall Asian man who walked with a cane, and held a bundle of shopping bags in his other hand. I saw the exact moment he spotted the Sorrow - now a girl with long braided hair, dark eyes and a school uniform that looked foreign. He didn't quite stop dead. But he moved towards her, slowly and carefully, until they stood watching each other closely. Neither of them exchanged words.

Cautiously, the man opened one of his shopping bags and pulled out a gift. Handing it to the Sorrow, he muttered just one sentence that I was able to lip read.

“You look just like she did. Please, take care.”

The Sorrow unwrapped the gift after the man struggled away. It was a stuffed toy of a popular children’s character. Attached to it was a note I could just read from the window.

*My daughter, I remember and miss you every day. I hope you have a wonderful, heavenly Christmas. With love, from your doting father.*



\*\*\*



Hours passed. The snow continued to fall.

It was late afternoon when the Sorrow began to change again. The streets were packed with people returning home from work. Clutching my third hot chocolate of the day, I held the book half-heartedly in front of me as I pressed my nose to the window. The blurring was easier to see at this angle. This time I saw a woman in her twenties, with long, curly hair and beautiful dark skin. As she blurred, the Sorrow’s clothing changed to a stained woollen dress with matching red mittens. A hole in one of them meant her fingers poked through. She wore battered brown boots with the laces missing and drooping knee socks patterned with hearts. More than anything, she looked like a student fallen on hard times.

As soon as she began to move, I discarded my book and followed her. She moved slowly, as though walking caused her pain, and I noticed one of her legs was slightly shorter than the other. Without thinking, I followed her through the increasing snow, across streets, down alleys, until we were in a completely different part of the city. Still, no one but me seemed to have noticed her.

We reached a park. The Sorrow sat on one bench. I sat on the opposite. We simply sat and observed each other. For a brief moment, I saw my father’s eyes in her face. The moment passed. The Sorrow toyed with a thread from the damaged mitten.

The man appeared as the sun set.

Tall, tanned, blonde and muscular. He wore a suit that looked like it cost more than my monthly rent. His shoes were polished leather, and his scarf had to be cashmere. All that he needed was a briefcase to complete the look.

He had barely turned the corner before he saw the Sorrow. He stopped dead.

His voice was weaker than I had expected. “J-Julia? Is that you?”

The Sorrow said nothing. She only looked at him with cold, emotionless eyes. A bruise started to form, just below her left cheekbone.

The man looked on the edge of panic, but he seemed unable to move. “Julia, this can’t be you. Say you’re not her. How can you be here? How did you find me?”

With every word, something new happened to the Sorrow. Her nose, struck by an invisible punch. Her clothes looked more and more tattered. One of her eyes filled red with blood. One arm hung loosely, clearly broken at the wrist.

“Answer me! What is happening? How are you here?”

As the Sorrow stood, her jaw unhinged like that of a snake. Her teeth were pointed.

“You thought you had killed me and gotten away with it, Brian.”

The man clamped his mouth shut. He still seemed unable to move.

“You beat me, day and night. You said it was because you loved me so much, you couldn’t bear other men looking at me. Or my male friends texting me. Or my parents disliking you. Or a hundred more petty, little things. Sometimes, you’d just had a bad day. So you beat me. But I loved you, so I stayed.”

I wasn’t sure if the man would ever speak again.

“But one day, you came home from work drunk. You’d had a fight with your boss over a missed promotion, then stopped at a bar on the way home. You were very drunk, and *very* angry. I tried to embrace you. You pushed me into a wall.”

A horrific injury was forming on the back of the Sorrow’s head. It was like someone had caved in her skull with a bat, or maybe a bottle. Old, blackened blood matted her hair.

“I tried to apologise, but every “sorry” seemed to make it worse. You hit me, again and again, and I begged you to stop. The more I begged, the worse it got. So I became quiet. I wanted you to leave me alone, but my silence seemed to give you a different idea. You left me, broken and sobbing on the kitchen floor, and came back with a rolling pin from the kitchen.”

The only other sound was the snow falling gently around us. The Sorrow moved closer.

“That was a real dick move, Brian. I’d been using that rolling pin to make biscuits for my grandmother’s birthday. But instead, you used it to cave in my skull. You beat me so many times, it stopped feeling like a wound and more like the pounding of my poor, broken heart. When I died, I wasn’t even mad at you. I only wondered what I had done to make you so angry.”

Have you ever seen a rabbit, knowing it’s about to be caught by a fox? That’s how this man looked when the Sorrow finally stopped before him.

“Julia wasn’t mad at you, Brian. But I am.”

Her jaw shot out and those sharp teeth seemed to extend as they punctured his face. Screaming, the man sunk to his knees, the Sorrow descending on him like a monster desperate to feed. All I could do was watch as she devoured him without mercy - blood, guts, bones and all. I expected the snow to turn red, but his blood seemed to fly towards the Sorrow with a magnetic force. His wailing only ended after she clawed the heart from his chest and stripped it into pieces with her new, talon-like claws. With every piece swallowed, her injuries seemed to heal a little, until the only sign of the man was the shredded, expensive suit on the ground.

Finally, when it was over, the Sorrow looked over to me. Panic seized me. Would she let me live, knowing what I’d seen? But I too felt too paralyzed by fear to run. I didn’t want to become another bundle of fabric on the ground, but my knees refused to let me stand up.

The Sorrow came and sat beside me. As she moved, she blurred and morphed and changed again. Finally, she became an image of my father.

“You have helped many Sorrows in this city. Providing you live a good and kind life, we will never harm you. The man you saw was a killer who ruined the life of a wonderful young woman. You know how poor the justice system is when the killer is white and the victim is not.” I nodded - this was a familiar conversation with my mixed-race father. “He got away with everything. I decided he needed to pay. Do you think I made the right decision?”

I stared at the mass of ruined clothing across the park.

“Brian Redfern was the oldest of three children. He has two living parents, both of whom doted on their children. He grew up upper-class and became a leading professor in neuroscience. His research saved many lives. He has a family who loves him, a close group of friends, and a new girlfriend who he has never so much as struck in anger. Do you think I made the right decision?”

The Sorrow put his hand on my knee. It felt warm and familiar, the same gesture my father used to make.

“After he killed Julia, he hid her body in a reservoir. It was found, and he was a suspect, but the evidence wasn’t enough. He had too many loyal supporters. Eventually, he was cleared of all charges. Julia’s killer was never named and her family misses her every day.”

“She deserved better,” was all I could think to say.

“She did,” the Sorrow nodded. “Brian felt remorse. Not enough to confess, but some. He quit drinking the day after he murdered Julia. He donated a great deal of money to help Julia’s family - they were much poorer than his. He still keeps in touch with her sister and listens to her grief. Is that kindness?”

“It’s grotesque.”

“Brian thought he could redeem himself. I have to feed, Poppy. All Sorrows must feed. We eat humans, and we try to eat the ones who we think deserve it. The murderers. The rapists. The child abusers. But it’s horrible work, even though we’re genetically meant to kill. It causes us great sorrow. Maybe Brian could have been redeemed if he’d turned himself in one day, and faced the consequences of his actions. Do you think I made the right decision?”

“Yes.” My answer was instantaneous. “You killed a monster to stay alive. That’s what heroes do in books and films.”

The Sorrow smiled sadly. “I’m no hero. I just want to live. No Sorrow understands where we came from, why we have to feed, and even how long we will live. I have lived a very long life, Poppy. I have fed upon many people, and been treated kindly by many more. Indeed, it’s the kindness people like you give us that sustains us as much as the people we consume.”

Tears stung my eyes. “But we’re not good people. We only help you because you remind us of people we love.”

“Humans are complicated beings. That much, we understand. It’s good to help people for any reason. But it’s also good to help people for selfish reasons. The most important thing is just to do good. Goodness will keep us all alive, until the end.”

I still had a hundred questions, but my head was buzzing. The Sorrow stood up and walked over to the shredded clothes. Whistling a tune from my childhood, he swept them into his sack.

I chose one question. The one that mattered the most.

“Don’t go. Will you stay with me? I have a room waiting for you.”
