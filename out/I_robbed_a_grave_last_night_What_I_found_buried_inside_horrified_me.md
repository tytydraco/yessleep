I know what accusations you’re already forming in your mind. I have heard them all before. And hey, maybe you’re right. 

I will be the first to admit that I am too lazy to get a ‘real’ job. But excuse me for not wanting to wither away in some bleak office space. Maybe I am morally compromised as well. But bills need to be paid and I have a wife currently going through chemo. 

Hell, you probably read the title and felt some level of satisfaction that I encountered something evil. That’s karma and I was definitely asking for it. 

I wouldn’t expect any other reaction. Trust me, I am aware that those in my profession are frowned upon. We are the lowest of thieves. 

But please, give me a chance to ease at least some of your concerns: 

#1: I do not rob the graves of those recently deceased. I stick to graves that have been around for at least a quarter of a century. 

#2: If the deceased was young at the time of death, I do not rob their grave. 

#3: If there are signs of recent care, such as flowers, I will leave the grave alone. 

#4: No mausoleums. I will not divulge my reasoning on this one. Trade secret. 

#5: I do my research and prioritize the graves of those who were either quite wealthy in life OR had a criminal background. 

So you see? I am not that bad of a guy. I don’t deserve what’s happening to me. And if any of you have advice on what to do then please, offer it. Because I am scared and I feel very alone right now. 

Now that I’m thinking about it, this is how those first astronauts must have felt when they first entered the void and gazed upon the precipice of a new age. Like those who never made it back, I now know the price of that knowledge. 

Christ, I am rambling. I will start at the beginning. 

The job began like any other. I had done some initial scouting in the days leading up to the heist and got a feel for what hours would have the least amount of  people present. Then, I did research into the various people buried there via the computers and resources at the local library and picked out a couple of graves that had a higher probability of riches being buried inside. 

One name stood out in particular — Bertholdt. He had been a very wealthy tradesman in the 1800s, having made most of his fortune in the procurement and distribution of whale oil, narwhal horn, and various textiles. A rather unsavory fellow, he died alone, his only real heir a niece that wanted nothing to do with him and donated all his wealth and belongings to the Church. I would have left the story there had I not caught a snippet from a local historian’s journals which spoke of an artifact the Church wasn’t comfortable with keeping or selling, so they had it buried with Bertholdt. 

I didn’t know what the artifact was, the journal didn’t specify, but stay in the business long enough and you develop a radar for massive scores. Mine was positively beeping. Fueled by the possibility of a huge payday I rose from the seat, gathered my bags, and headed out of the library.   

Since Hillview Cemetery is roughly three hours away from home, I decided to get a motel for the night. Once I had gotten settled I contacted the wife, told her about how well the business trip was going, and gave her my love. Then I ripped off my shirt and fell asleep. 

My alarm woke me at two in the morning. Show time. I pulled my hair back into a bun and pulled a beanie down tight over it. Then I grabbed my shirt, zipped up my jacket, and double-checked my gear. Everything was all set. 

The roads were fairly empty at this hour. I saw a few semis rumbling past on the backroads, and even a police cruiser with its lights off at the local park. From my seat it looked like the officer was taking a nap. I didn’t blame him. I had chosen well. These sorts of towns are a dime a dozen out here. Sleepy little places with populations primarily over the age of forty with less than twenty thousand people. Ideal for robbery, less so for fun. 

I lowered my windows when I was out of the city proper and played the radio softly, just for some company. The cemetery was still a few miles away. The moon was out, casting its ruddy light on both the dry road ahead of me and the fields which extended to all sides on a seemingly infinite plane. I could hear coyotes howling in the distance, their songs carrying perfectly due to it being a cool, clear night. 

Altogether it was eerily beautiful. One of those evenings better suited for roasting marshmallows around the campfire than black work such as this. A familiar gap opened up in my chest. Decades ago I sat around campfires and told the boys around me I would be an astronaut one day. I wonder what they ended up making of themselves. 

I wonder what they and my kid-self would think about what I became instead.

Here’s the truth: I had the desire but not the brains. Maybe if there were adults in my life who believed in me I could have still done it, but that wasn’t my lot. We all have our places in life and the sooner we accept it the less pain we will deal with. But I can’t help but ask myself: just because I was born stupid, does that mean I don’t deserve to see the stars? 

A large hill rose up in the distance, the only break within the dull flatness for miles. I cut the radio and rolled up the windows. Hillview. Never had I seen a cemetery quite like it. Tombstones wrapped around its bulkage like dozens of necklaces, and at the very top was a bent tree carved with the names of hundreds of sweethearts. 

I passed by the padlocked iron gates and drove until I reached an unmarked side road. I would have preferred to kill my lights at this point, but the road had the odd ditch here and there, along with large rocks and other scattered debris. 

I must admit that a thrill rose within me as I made my way further in through the encroaching mists and winding curves. I was dialed in in a way I never could be during the day, my eyes constantly scanning the environment, wary for others. 

I eased my foot on the pedal and steered around a corner, only to slam on the brakes. 

There was a tree lying across the road, thick enough to be the height of my chest. I stared at it in confusion. I had been here not six hours earlier and this road was clear! Swearing, I got out of my truck and walked over, patting the hunting knife at my hip to reaffirm it was there. 

I knew I could climb the tree just fine. I just couldn’t make sense as to how it got there. You see, this tree was solid oak, and by the looks of it, fresh. Now that may seem odd to you and you would be right to feel that way. But what should cause your arms to go all bumpy is that there are no damn oak around here! Only fruit and nut trees. 

I should have left. I went so far as to get back in my truck and start backing up. Then I remembered rent was due this month. Beth was counting on me. Sighing, I parked, swung my pack over my shoulder, and continued on foot. 

The rest of the road was clear outside of the odd coyote out for an evening stroll. These ones were braver than I was used to. I recall one of them stopped and stared at me as I walked past. It was a calm creature and bright too, judging by the glint in its eyes. It flicked bat-like ears at me and sauntered off. I chuckled. I liked those critters, in fact they reminded me of myself. Drifters in the dark. 

It was the Devil’s Hour by the time I took my first steps onto the Hill. The mist was so thick I could hardly see more than five feet in any direction. So I moved gingerly, a walking stick tapping the ground before me. I took care to avoid stepping on any graves and paid close attention to even the faintest of sounds. Maybe it was my imagination, but there were moments where I thought I heard people whispering nearby. Almost as if there were a party of guests waiting to surprise me at my home as they watched from the shadows. 

After a few wrong turns I eventually arrived at the walkway which circled the hill. It was wet and there were steps missing in places, but if I followed it I would arrive at Bertholdt’s grave, which was on the Hill’s western side, about half the way up. 

I only took about a dozen steps before I heard someone scream in the night. I quickly crouched low and dimmed the lamp which hung at my side. 

I was beginning to think the scream had been a mere figment of a tired mind when I heard it once more. By God, the way it pierced the stillness! The coyotes began to laugh and screech from their homes, and the moon herself hid behind the clouds. I waited for so long I seemed to become part of the hill itself. But whoever or whatever it was seemed to have made their point, because I didn’t hear another scream. I glanced at my watch and saw that it wouldn’t be long till the sun rose. 

Thankfully the Hill wasn’t that big. I made it to Berthold’s grave quicker than I thought I would, though I was huffing and puffing. It was in a space all on its own, the grass around it wet with dew. Almost exactly the way I left it, had there not been signs of an animal nearby. I kicked aside the string of bird skulls it left behind onto a pile of loose dirt near the bench which had Bertholdt’s name on it and set to work with the shovel. 

My first grave robbery didn’t involve any digging. However it did involve the first and only time I ever broke one of my rules. 

The night it happened, I had been in the graveyard mourning the anniversary of my mother’s death with Mr. Daniels by my side. He helped me lose track of time, and when I was finally roused from my drunkenness I realized I was lying like a baby near my mother’s gravestone. Through sheer luck or maybe fate, I was perfectly angled to see a grave that someone recently left gifts at. Curious, I wandered over and to my shock saw that they left a golden necklace with a golden Jesus hanging from it next to some flowers. It didn’t take much for me to steal it. I simply leaned down and stuffed it into my pocket. I remember the fear I felt in my belly. The way I walked with my head down to my bicycle. 

I sold it at a pawn shop for a few thousand and bought groceries, half a year’s rent, and a brand new dress for Beth. It was more money than I ever made working at the car wash, and way quicker too. 
I told the wife it was some inheritance from an uncle who died recently when she asked. I know she didn’t believe me, but we were desperate and couldn’t afford to ask questions. So I continued to receive monthly deposits from my uncle’s estate, and every time I did, I felt a bit less fear. Not without  cost though. Remember that folks. Nothing is free. Every time I felt the fear leave, I felt some of the love go with it. Eventually, I couldn’t look at people on the street directly anymore. I couldn’t stand to be near them. 

My shovel struck wood and left a dent. “Shit,” I whispered. I tossed the shovel to the side and wiped sweat from my brow. Faintly in the distance, I could see the edges of the sky beginning to pale and figured it wouldn’t be too long until the old folks started trickling in. 

I wiped the dirt free until I could see the gilded mahogany of the coffin. There, written faintly across the front, was the name ‘Bertholdt’ along with a warning in Latin I would only decipher all too late: “Mortui Vivos Docent.” 

With my tools I cracked the padlocks which sealed it, and after taking in a steadying breath, threw it open, a wide grin on my face at the prospect of treasure. 

I took in the corpse’s boots, jeans, and blood-soaked jacket, and felt my smile fade away when I saw his face. 

For it was not Bertholdt lying there. It was hardly a corpse. 

The person lying in Bertholdt’s coffin was me. 

I stumbled back, rubbing at my eyes and desperately hoping this was all a trick. But the truth was plain as the sunlight which slowly burned through the mist. I was in the coffin. That was my wedding ring, that was my shovel and lantern held in the corpse’s arms like a Pharaoh’s crook and flail, and those were my eyes, now open and staring at me. 

I willed myself to climb out of that hole, but the creature wearing my face froze me with its stare. I could only watch as it slowly sat up, its eyes never leaving mine. Bright red blood steadily poured down its mouth, drenching its clothes like it had been dunked in an ocean of the foul liquid. Then, it screamed. The sound came out more like a gurgle than a pure screech, and I don’t know if it was the strength of the creature’s cry, or some latent force within me that forced me up and out of there, but next thing I knew, I was crawling out and running away, my gear left behind. 

I half ran, half rolled down the hill. The screams intensified behind me, shaking the very earth from their force. There was such hurt and pain in its voice, and I knew I never wanted to be within its reach. So I sprinted like never before, my mind on nothing else but what was ahead of me. I heard its feet slapping the ground behind, and felt it constantly getting closer as I weaved between tombstones, but eventually I think I lost it in the orchards. 

My teeth were chattering and arms and legs shaking violently as I sped away. I kept glancing in the rear view, thinking I would see my dead copy racing towards me at supernatural speeds, but there was nothing but empty road. 

In my studies I have read about ghouls and grims and other mythical creatures, and in this profession it is not uncommon to hear stories about encounters with the unknown. I never gave them much credence. Why believe these things protect the dead, who they can do nothing for, and not the living who suffer every day? I reassured myself on the drive home of this and figured it must have been a guilt-induced hallucination. Hell, I even began to feel better as I walked up to the door. 

After eating some breakfast and taking a hot shower, I walked into the living room and felt a curious draft of air. The front door was open. 

“Beth? That you?” I said. 

I whipped around when I heard something shuffle behind me. I swallowed, throat suddenly dry and began to walk backwards. “Beth?” I said again. 

The front door slammed shut. I could see the front porch through the living room window, and there was no one out there. 

Then a glass shattered in the kitchen. That was it. I sprinted for the door, knowing that Beth wouldn’t joke like this and stepped outside into a mound of dirt that sent me flying onto the pavement. I cried out in pain and held my leg to my chest. Ankle sprain. But that pain was soon forgotten by the sight of what was standing at the far end of my home. 

A perfect replica of myself. All cleaned up and dressed in fresh clothes. The only thing off about it was the emptiness in his eyes. I screamed and it smiled. 

To be frank, I don’t know how I got into my truck or how I was able to contact my wife and tell her to stay at her sister’s and not come home for a while. There was no thought to it. Just pure mechanical movement as my mind oscillated between fear and doubt and loathing. 

So here I am now, typing away at a computer in a public library a few towns over. I have spent nights in my truck, parked where I am never too far away from others, constantly on edge. The screams are getting closer no matter what I do, and I fear that I have damned myself to a life of constant running. If only there was some way I could go back and undo everything. 

Please, if anyone knows what this creature is and if I can do anything to be free of it, tell me. Because I miss my wife and I want to go home.
