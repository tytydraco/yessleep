I'm writing this because I need to get it out. Because if I don't tell someone what happened, I think I'll lose what's left of my mind. This was a week days ago, and I still can't shake it off.

\*

It was a Thursday morning, and Sylvia and I were passed out after a long night of partying. Zack had picked up a fat 8-ball the previous afternoon, and we had plenty of liquor and beer—everything except ice. Zack and I had gone out to the Kid's grocery and restaurant to grab some.

By the time we stumbled back into the apartment, Sylvia was half-asleep at one end of the giant U-shaped sectional, one leg dangling off. The baby was in his crib in the corner of the room snoring softly under this funny dinosaur blanket he refused to sleep without. Completely oblivious to the chaos around him, as if parental irresponsibility was just another ambient household sound, like the fridge humming. I thought about Trainspotting and thanked god we were not heroin addicts.

Looking back now, I should have noticed how still he was. How the apartment seemed to hold its breath around that crib.

Zack burst in first, triumphant, shaking a bag of ice over his head like it was the Olympic torch. "Mission accomplished!" he yelled, immediately tripping over Sylvia's shoe and nearly face-planting onto the carpet. The man had all the energy of a golden retriever.

Sylvia cracked one eye open. "Did you… seriously yell? With Cullen sleeping?" she muttered, pointing vaguely in the crib's direction before rolling over with the grace of a tranquilized seal.

I tossed the ice into the sink, grabbed a beer that was already questionably warm, and flopped down next to her. "Relax. That kid could sleep through a nuclear test," I said. Which was true. Last week someone dropped a full bottle of vodka on the tile, and the kid didn't even twitch. Little king of serenity :) The kid was a champ, sleeping through the kind of noise that would've had the neighbors calling the cops if we weren't in a building full of people just like us.

Or maybe he was trying to tell us something. Maybe that unnatural stillness was a warning we were too fucked up to read.

Meanwhile Zack was already setting up the drinks, trying to resurrect the party like a necromancer with poor judgment. "Guys, c'mon," he said. "It's still practically morning. We've got momentum!"

Momentum. Right. As if gravity and regret weren't already doing their best work on us. As if something wasn't already pulling us down, down into whatever waited at the bottom.

But he was smiling that ridiculous smile of his, the one that said yeah it's stupid, but wouldn't it be stupid together? And honestly? On that kind of afternoon, in that mess of a living room with a tiny dinosaur-cloaked toddler snoring away like a saint—yeah. Why not.

\*

Zack cracked open a fresh beer and poured shots of bourbon over ice. "To momentum," he said, raising it like a toast to nothing in particular. Sylvia groaned but reached for her glass anyway as I handed it to her. The ice clinked against the sides, already melting, already losing the fight against the heat of the room, our heat.

The baby stirred—just a little shift, a sigh—but stayed under. I watched the rise and fall of the dinosaur blanket, the way it moved with his tiny breaths, and felt something twist in my chest. How could such a lovely thing come from Sylvia and me? But then Zack turned up the music, some bass-heavy track that vibrated through the floorboards, and the moment passed. Sylvia laughed at something—maybe a joke, maybe nothing—and suddenly, it was just another one of these afternoons again.

Except the light in the apartment seemed different. Thicker somehow. Like we were all moving through amber.

\*

Zack was cutting lines on the coffee table again, his hands steady despite everything. Sylvia leaned over, her hair falling into her face, and did one without hesitation.

I did a line. Then another. The room got brighter, sharper, the edges of everything too defined, like someone had turned up the contrast. Zack was talking about some conspiracy—something about the water, the government, the way they were all out to get us. Sylvia was nodding along, but her eyes were glazed, already halfway to wherever the coke was taking her. I could feel the sweat prickling at the back of my neck, the beer and the powder and the heat of the day all mixing together into something thick and electric.

That's when I heard it. A sound from the walls. Not the pipes, not the neighbors—something else. Like scratching. Like something trying to get in. *Or out*.

"You hear that?" I said.

Zack paused mid-sentence. "Hear what?"

"That... scratching sound."

Sylvia laughed, but it sounded wrong. Hollow. "It's just the building, babe. Old pipes. You're paranoid."

Maybe I was. The coke did that sometimes. Made you hear things that weren't there. Made you feel like the walls were listening in..

\*

Around 2 PM, Zack decided he needed to "organize the situation." This involved him standing in the middle of the living room, hands on hips, surveying the apartment like a general assessing a battlefield.

"You know what this place needs?" he announced to no one in particular. "Feng shui."

Sylvia, still draped across the couch like a discarded scarf, didn't even open her eyes. "Zack. Please shut up."

But Zack was already in motion, picking up empty beer cans and arranging them in a careful line along the windowsill. "No, no, listen—I read about this. Energy flow. Chi. We've got *blocked chi* in here, and that's why we feel like shit."

"We feel like shit because we've been awake for hours doing blow," I said, watching him with growing fascination and horror.

He ignored me completely, now trying to move the coffee table three inches to the left. Except he was still holding a beer in one hand and a cigarette in the other, so he was essentially just hip-checking the furniture while everything on top of it rattled precariously.

"The baby's corner—see, that's good. That's the *prosperity corner*. Very auspicious." He nodded sagely, ash from his cigarette dropping onto the carpet.

Then he stopped. Stared at the crib. His face went pale.

"Where's his head?"

"What?" Sylvia sat up.

"I can't... I can't see his head. Under the blanket. Where's—"

And then Cullen shifted. Just slightly. The dinosaur blanket moved, and we could see the shape of his little face again, peaceful in sleep.

Zack laughed nervously. "Jesus. Thought he'd... never mind. Fucking coke paranoia."

But his hands were shaking when he picked up his beer. And I noticed—we all noticed—how he didn't look at the crib again after that.

I should have checked on Cullen then. Should have walked over and made sure he was okay. But I didn't. I just sat there, heart pounding, telling myself it was nothing.

"But this couch?" Zack continued, voice too loud, too forced. "Facing the wrong direction. Totally wrong. We're basically *inviting* bad vibes."

"Zack," Sylvia growled, "if you try to move this couch with me on it, I will *personally* block your chi with my fists."

He paused, considered this, then pivoted. "Fine. Plan B. We rearrange the *spiritual* energy with positive affirmations." He cleared his throat ceremonially. "I am a *beacon* of good decisions!"

The baby chose that exact moment to let out a small fart in his sleep—loud enough that we all heard it.

The silence that followed was profound.

Zack pointed at the crib, eyes wide. "Even Cullen knows that's bullshit."

I nearly choked on my beer. Sylvia actually laughed—a real one, the kind that shook her shoulders. And Zack, completely unbothered, just shrugged and took another sip. "Okay, fine. Feng shui cancelled. But I still think the coffee table should move."

The moment passed. The tension broke. But something lingered in the air. Something that felt like watching.

\*

By the time the 8-ball was just a memory and some residue on the coffee table, we were all grinding our teeth and blinking too much. The sun was barely starting its slow climb outside, that awful pre-dawn gray that made everything look like a crime scene.

And doesn't that feel prophetic now? Crime scene lighting. As if the universe was trying to warn us what was coming.

Zack was pacing near the window, jaw working overtime, occasionally pulling back the blinds to peek out like he was expecting someone. "What time is it? Feels late. Or early. Is it early?"

"It's past 5 AM," Sylvia said flatly from the couch. She'd been staring at the ceiling like it held answers. "Guys, we need some sleep. Cullen's gonna be up in like three hours."

The baby. Right. Feeding time. Bath time. All those things that required being a functional human being, which none of us currently were.

I rubbed my face, feeling the electric buzz still crackling under my skin. "We're not sleeping like this."

Zack stopped pacing and snapped his fingers—actually snapped them, like he'd just solved cold fusion. "I think I got Xanax. In my jacket. Oh yeah almost forgot about those fuckers."

"Thank god," Sylvia breathed. Salvation.

He dug through the pockets of his denim jacket, which was all crumpled on the floor near the door, and produced a little orange prescription bottle. Shook it like a maraca. "My cousin's. Well, *was* my cousin's. He doesn't need 'em anymore."

The way he said it made my skin crawl. But I didn't ask. We never asked about things like that.

Zack dumped a few pills into his palm, squinting at them in the dim light. "Okay, so... half a bar each? Maybe a full one for you, Sylv, you're bigger—"

"Just give me the damn thing, Zack."

He distributed them like a very unreliable pharmacist, and we all washed them down with whatever liquid was closest—beer, flat Coke, something that might've been orange juice once upon a time but now was brown (bourb'orange?). I swallowed mine and waited for the glory to descend.

Zack flopped into the armchair, limbs everywhere, looking like a marionette with cut strings. "Okay. Okay, we just... wait for the landing gear to deploy." He closed his eyes, then opened one. "How long does it take?"

"Twenty minutes, maybe," I said, though honestly I had no idea, but it sounded about right.

"Twenty minutes," he repeated, like he was trying to convince himself. Then, after a pause: "You think Cullen's gonna know? Like, when he wakes up... you think he can *tell* we've been up all night?"

Sylvia snorted softly. "He's two years old, Zack. He doesn't know anything except tiny dinosaurs and mashed bananas."

"Right. Right, yeah." Another pause. His voice dropped to almost a whisper. "But what if he's, like... *perceptive*? What if he knows what we are?"

The question hung in the air like smoke. Nobody answered it. What could we say? That we were good people? That we were trying our best?

We all knew what we were.

"Go to sleep, Zack."

"I'm trying!"

The apartment settled into an uneasy quiet. Just the hum of the refrigerator, someone's car alarm going off three blocks away, the occasional creak of the building itself. I could feel the Xanax starting to creep in at the edges—softening things, pulling the volume down on the anxiety, the jittery heartbeat, the sense that my skin was too tight.

But as I started to drift, I heard it again. That scratching. Closer this time. Coming from somewhere inside the apartment.

I tried to open my eyes. Tried to check on it. But the Xanax had its hooks in me now, dragging me down into the dark.

Zack's voice came again, quieter this time, almost drowsy. "You guys ever think about... if it is... like... what we're doing?"

Nobody answered. Sylvia's breathing had already gone slow and deep. I was halfway there myself, sinking into the couch cushions like they were quicksand, and honestly? It felt good. The chemicals finally balancing out, the crash pad catching us before we hit concrete.

Cullen made a small sound from his crib—just a sleepy little grunt—and I cracked an eye open to check. Still under. Still dreaming whatever baby dreams he had, probably nothing more complicated than colors and warmth and milk.

I closed the blinds, plunging the room back into darkness.

"We'll figure it out in the morning," I mumbled to Zack, but he was already snoring.

That was the last thing I remember before the drugs took me completely. The last moment before everything changed.

I wish I'd stayed awake. I wish I'd checked on Cullen one more time. I wish I'd done so many fucking things differently.

\*

The Xanax had me down deep, buried in that thick, dreamless muck. But somewhere in the dark, I was dreaming. Or remembering. Or seeing something that hadn't happened yet.

Water. I was underwater. Cullen was there too, reaching up toward me with his little hands, but I couldn't move. Couldn't swim. Couldn't breathe. And he was sinking, sinking down into the dark, and I could only watch—

I woke up needing to piss. Or shit. Something. Both. My body was making demands through the fog, slow and insistent, like someone knocking on a door three rooms and a half away.

The living room was dark. Completely dark. What time was it? The quality of the darkness felt wrong—too thick, too quiet. I tried to sit up and my head swam, everything moving in stages. Slow. So heavy.

Couch empty.

That thought took a long time to form. To become real. Sylvia wasn't there. The shape of the couch where she'd been—just cushions now. Flat. *No one*.

Zack's chair. Also empty.

My brain tried to process this but kept slipping, like trying to grip something covered in oil. But something felt off. The apartment had a weird quality to it, like the air pressure had changed. Like something changed while I slept.

I stood up—too fast—and had to catch myself on the arm of the couch. The room tilted. Righted itself. Tilted again. Floor solid under my feet eventually. Good. Walking now. One foot. Then the other.

Bedroom door was half open. Light coming through—that gray morning light that seeped through the broken blinds, striped and cold.

I pushed the door wider.

Sylvia was in the bed. Under the covers. I could see her hair spread across the pillow, dark against white. Still in her clothes, I thought. Jeans. Her shirt. She hadn't even bothered to change.

And Zack.

Zack was next to her. On top of the sheets. Naked. Completely naked, sprawled out like he'd been dropped from a height, one arm across his face, mouth open.

My brain stuttered trying to make sense of this. Why was Zack naked? Why were they in bed together? And why did I care? I didn't care. Did I? The thoughts came slow and stuck together, clumping like moldy paper.

But there was something else. Something my mind kept trying to grab onto and missing.

The crib.

I turned—too slow, everything too slow—and looked back toward the living room. In the corner. Without the dinosaur blanket.

Cullen.

Where was Cullen?

Not in the crib. The shape of it wrong, empty. I'd seen it when I stood up, hadn't I? Had I seen it? Everything was soup, my thoughts thick and useless.

Maybe Sylvia had brought him to bed. But I didn't see him in the bed. Just Sylvia. Just Zack's pale naked body. Fuck. I backed out, left them sleeping in their wrong places.

My bladder cramped, gut twisted, reminding me why I'd gotten up in the first place.

Bathroom. I needed the bathroom.

I moved down the hallway, one hand on the wall for balance. The apartment was so quiet. Wrong quiet. Even Cullen's little sleep sounds—those tiny snores, the rustle of him shifting—nothing.

The bathroom door was closed. Not all the way, but mostly. A sliver of light visible through the crack.

That scratching sound again. Coming from inside.

My hand, moving through syrup, pushed it open.

\*

The light was on. Had I left it on? The fluorescent bulb buzzed, flickering slightly, casting everything in that sick yellow glow.

Water everywhere. The floor was soaked, puddles spreading out from the base of the toilet. The toilet lid was up.

And there, in the water—

Cullen.

He was in the toilet bowl. Face down, his heavy head bobbing. His hair floated around his crown like dark seaweed. His little body wedged in at an impossible angle, the dinosaur pajamas he'd been wearing dark and heavy with water. His arms hung limp over the sides of the bowl.

My heart stopped. Time stopped. Everything stopped.

I lurched forward, my legs finally responding, hands reaching for him—

And then he moved.

His head lifted out of the water. Turned toward me. Water streaming down his face, his eyes bright and alert. He was *smiling*.

"Jack," he said clearly. Too clearly for a two-year-old who barely said ten words.

I froze, hands outstretched, brain refusing to process what I was seeing. He was fine. He was *fine*. Playing in the toilet like it was a bathtub. But how long had he been there? How had he gotten there?

"What... Cullen, what are you—"

"Jack," he repeated, pointing past me. Toward the hallway. Toward the empty hallway.

My skin went cold. "Who?"

"Jack!" Insistent now. Still smiling that wrong smile. Still pointing at nothing.

Footsteps behind me. Sylvia's voice, groggy and confused: "Who's Jack?"

I couldn't take my eyes off Cullen. Off the way he was looking past me at something I couldn't see. "He must be talking about Zack," I said, but my voice sounded distant. Wrong.

"Zack?" Sylvia said from the threshold. I could hear the confusion in her voice. The creeping dread. "Baby, who's Zack?"

The fluorescent light flickered again. Cullen giggled—a sound like breaking glass—and splashed his hands in the toilet water.

"We don't know anyone named Zack," Sylvia whispered.

 \*

That was six days ago. We've asked everyone. Checked our phones. Our memories. There's no Zack. There never was. The third person in all those memories? The face is blurred now when I try to remember it. The voice distorted. Like trying to recall a dream.

But I remember the Xanax bottle. The one he pulled from his jacket pocket. His dead cousin's pills, he said. I found that bottle yesterday, wedged between the couch cushions.

The prescription label was still legible: *Jack Metcalf.*

\*

Sometimes, late at night, when Cullen should be sleeping, I hear him in his room. Talking. Giggling.

 "Jack," he says. "Jack, Jack, Jack."

And I hear it—just barely, like it's coming from very far away or from underwater—another voice answering back.

 *Momentum*, it whispers. *We've still got momentum*.

\*

I can't write much more about it, my words are scant and at least for now... Not yet. Maybe not ever. But I'll tell you this: momentum is real. It pulls you down. And once you start falling, once you let yourself get pulled into that gravity—there's no landing gear. There's no crash pad.

There's only what waits at the bottom.

And sometimes, what waits there is something you put there yourself as you were born like this—into this.
