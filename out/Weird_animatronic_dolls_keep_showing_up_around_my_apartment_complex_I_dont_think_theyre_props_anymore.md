I used to think "ghost" stories only happened in old places. You know, creaky staircases, peeling wallpaper, antique mirrors. 

I didn’t expect a brand-new apartment complex, still half-empty, half-lit, and barely staffed.. to scare me worse than anything I’ve ever experienced in my life. But that’s exactly what happened when I took a night security job at a building nobody seemed interested in living in.

I was working a contract gig. Just a few weeks to watch over some half-baked luxury complex on the outskirts of town. Nice enough glass paneling, fancy lobby with too much chrome, echoey hallways. 

Except it was basically abandoned. 

Management claimed there were seven tenants, but I only ever saw one. An older woman who stared straight ahead when she passed you, like she was watching something through your chest.

The others? Never saw them. No movement or sounds. Lights on sometimes, but I chalked it up to timers.

The job was easy. Too easy. Just patrol the floors every hour, make sure the doors were locked, and keep a little logbook in the office. 

But the silence got to me after a few nights. 

No staff. No cleaners. No contractors. Just me.

I started wandering more during my shifts. Roaming through upper floors. Sitting on unfinished balconies. Letting my mind drift.

That’s when things started getting weird.

It was a Tuesday night. Nothing special. I was bored out of my skull and started doing my rounds earlier just to keep my legs moving. 

While I was walking around on the 5th floor, I heard something. Not a voice, but a sound - more like a distant speaker glitching. Garbled static with syllables stitched together wrong. I followed it down the hall toward a T-junction like passage.

That’s where I saw the first one.

It was standing in the corner where the hallway dead-ended, facing the wall. A humanoid figure in the darkness. It was way too still. It had the plastic sheen of a mannequin, but its joints were segmented.. almost like a robot’s.

Its face was unnaturally pale and polished. Red lips, painted eyes, a dirty blond wig on its head. A plastic parody of a person.

There were faint orange-red LED glows under the seams in its neck and shoulder. And it was speaking.. or at least trying to. 

“Hi - Hi - Hi - sm-smi-- smi--" it repeated in a monotone, uncannily cheerful voice. "smi--uuhhgghghhhh-" it prolonged, its speaker perhaps crashing.

It turned its head unnaturally and one of its hands began to wave at something on the other end of the side corridor to its right. 

Its voice was vocoded. Like an old speech-to-text program skipping on a corrupted file. Perfect robotic cheerfulness.

I froze. I don’t know how long I just stood there, watching it twitch slightly like a screen stuck in a loop.

Eventually, I walked close to it a few steps, yanking a fire extinguisher off the wall.

It didn’t move but its voice glitched. 

At first I thought it was one of the few tenants playing around or testing some of their creations, or trying to weird me out.

If it was so, it was a bad prank. So I smashed that bot's face into the wall with the cylinder. 

I smashed it hard.

Metal bent, the plastic crunched, and wires popped out like nerves. It crumpled down like a puppet losing its strings, still whispering fragments.

I didn’t log this encounter. I didn’t know how to log that.

Half an hour later I went down to the third floor, just trying to forget it. But as I turned another corner, I saw another one.

This one was walking in place. Slowly bumping into the wall at the far end of the corridor like it was trying to continue on, but the building had ended before it expected. 

Its arms swayed like it was on a showroom floor. And behind it, down the side corridor. Dozens of parts.

Legs. Arms. Heads.

Some clean. Some crushed. Some twitching. Some still talking. A severed porcelain-plastic-looking torso was lying on its back, both arms missing, and still wheezing:

“H–hello. Arrr------- u oka-aayyy? I can m–mmaaake you smile.”

Something about all of this made me lose it. I wasn't agitated anymore, I felt genuinely creeped out. 

A sudden rush of adrenaline hit me and I ran down the stairs two at a time, nearly slipped, and bolted down to the lobby office.

I locked the door and turned off the lights.

No one knew I dozed off there sometimes. But I didn’t care anymore. I threw myself on the revolving chair and told myself they were props. 

Sick pranks. Vandalism, maybe. Someone trying to freak me out. Maybe I’d fallen asleep earlier and dreamed the whole thing.

I didn’t even realize I’d drifted off on that chair by the desk.

What woke me up was the distorted, eerily familiar sound of a speaker just above me - flat, repeating.

“Waaakeee- Up --- Smile-- Smile-- Smile-- Don't woorrr--yyyy, be--- hap---”

The room light was on. How?

And it was standing next to me. Yes, next to me.

One of those things. Bent over, almost nose to nose. Its hands on my cheeks. Pressing. Forcing my face into a grin. Fingers rigid, cold, a little sticky, like rubber gloves soaked in glue. 

Its eyes weren’t just painted on - they glowed faintly. A soft, pulsing pink. 

“Better-- bett- better--” it repeated.

I screamed and shoved it. It didn’t even fight back, just staggered a little, arms out, like it thought I wanted a hug.

There were others in the room.

Two standing in opposite corners, watching silently. One on the ceiling, literally attached, its hands gripping the concrete like some animatronic nightmare spider, head twisted 180 degrees to look at me.

I shoved past them all and burst out the office door.

Every hallway had something. A hand sticking out of a vent, heads piled atop each other in corners, limbs scattered - incomplete robots splayed apart. I couldn't even fathom where they appeared from.

As I ran through the passage, an elevator suddenly reached the floor, its doors opening to reveal a bunch of them jarringly dismembered. One of those sick bots stood there silently still, upright, with a delicately sly grin to its face.   
  
The doors then closed naturally, the elevator ascending to the ninth floor as if it was called.

I broke through the fire exit door. One of them was sitting in the middle of the stairwell, its head tilted so far sideways I thought it was broken. It wasn’t. It looked at me.

I kicked it and it tumbled down the stairs. I descended the stairs regardless. Didn’t even care. My legs were shaking.

Halfway down, the lights flickered. One more of them was waiting at the next landing. This one was a sickly pale face similar to that of a dying patient, but one leg missing and sparking at the shoulder. It didn’t move.

But it started to laugh.

Not mechanically.

Just...laughing. Wrong. Like an adult doing a bad child impression, looped and reversed.

I fell, caught by its almost sudden appearance.

Hit three or four steps before tumbling down the rest. I must’ve blacked out, because when I came to, the lights were on. The stairwell was empty. No voices. No movement.

My arm went numb and weak, feeling too heavy, as if I was dragging it along with me. I must have broke something. My head hurt as my vision blurred.

I crawled out through the back exit and never went back.

I quit the next day.

Didn’t explain anything. Didn’t collect my last check. Left my logbook on the desk and walked away.

Two days later, I saw a listing online. The entire complex had been sold. No explanation. Just “undergoing new management.”

There was no mention of those dolls. No police report. No complaint.

No record.
