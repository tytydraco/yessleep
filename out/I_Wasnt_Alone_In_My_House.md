I Wasn't Alone in My House

For the past three years, I’ve had the same dream almost every night. It’s always the same. I wake up in my dark apartment, my heart pounding in my chest. Everything looks normal at first—my bedside table, the faint outline of furniture, the sliver of light coming through the curtains. But there's a suffocating silence, the kind that presses in on you, like the air just before a storm.

In the dream, I always know that I’m not alone. It’s an instinct, that deep, primal feeling that something is terribly wrong. There’s someone—something—in my house.

Each night, the dream follows the same pattern. I get out of bed, my feet cold against the hardwood floor, and I walk down the hall toward the living room. The hallway feels longer than it should, and every step I take echoes in the silence. When I finally reach the living room, it's dark, as always. The curtains are drawn, casting everything in shadows, and the air is thick, heavy. But it’s when I reach the door that I freeze.

That’s when I see it. A shadow, darker than the rest, moves on the far side of the room. It’s not the kind of shadow that’s cast by light; it has its own form, its own presence. It’s like the darkness is alive, watching me, waiting. I can feel its eyes on me before I even see them. And when I do, they’re glowing—two small, crimson dots, like embers smoldering in the void.

Every time, without fail, I hear the same voice. “I’ve waited so long,” it whispers, but the voice isn’t human. It’s more like a rasping echo, a sound that crawls up from somewhere deep beneath the earth. The words are enough to send a shiver down my spine, locking me in place. I can’t move. I can’t breathe. And just when I think I’m about to be swallowed by the darkness, I wake up. 

Morning light floods the room, and everything feels safe again. I tell myself it’s just a dream, nothing more. But the feeling lingers, that oppressive weight, like something followed me out of sleep.

Last week, it happened again, only this time, something was different. After waking from the same dream, I went about my day, trying to shake it off as usual. I left for work, the apartment feeling too quiet behind me. But when I came back home that afternoon, I knew something was wrong. The front door was locked, just as I’d left it, but when I stepped inside, the air was heavy. The same thick, suffocating feeling from my dream.

Then I saw it—the living room door was open. My heart skipped a beat. I always close that door before I leave, a habit I’ve had for years. The curtains were drawn, and the light in the room was dim. Everything felt off, like I was still trapped in the dream.

I walked toward the living room slowly, trying to convince myself it was nothing. But with every step, that familiar sense of dread crept up my spine. When I finally reached the door, I hesitated, staring into the darkened room. 

Then I saw it—a shadow, darker than any normal shadow, moving at the far end of the room. My breath caught in my throat. And just like in the dream, I saw them—two glowing, crimson eyes staring back at me.

“I’ve waited so long,” the voice whispered, closer this time. It wasn’t a dream. I wasn’t alone in my house.

And I still don't know how to make it leave.
