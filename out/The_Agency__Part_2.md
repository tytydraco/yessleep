**The Agency â€“ Part 2**



**Day 2.**



And the investigation goes to the next level.



Our clandestined agency or organisation is beyond top-secret. We exist in the shadows to protect the world from the shadows. Our mission is to protect the world, to protect humanity, and we are very good at it.



Each one of us has gone through rigorous training, we are trained in every form of hand to hand combat, we have mastered most forms of martial arts, we are trained in the use of every weapon available to us. We have been taught how to beat lie detector tests. We are the shadows, we are basically the closest thing you would find to real life super-soldiers.



We have been trained to be fearless, to face any adversary we might encounter, we deal with the things that you don't want to believe exist, Things that goes bump in the night, the monsters under you bed, the ones in your closet, that thing sneaking around in the woods, we deal with all different kinds of threats, from human threats, terrorist threats, meta-humans, criptids and even extraterrestrials, yes you have read that right, those thngs that you read about online, they are all real, the only reason you don't run into them, why you don't see them is because of us, we take care of them, we are the reason that the world is still spinning.



Our organisation has limitless funding, our benefactors and investors ranging from governments, banks, corporations and even NPO's, and besides that we also have our own means of funding ourselves and our operations, means which is a closely gaurded secret, means which only the highest of the top ranking officials in our agency knows of.



We were ready for anything, we were ready for Sin, or so we thought.



As you already know, Sin is a Ghost, and some of you might even see him as a hero, doing the world a favour with his activities, but to others he is a threat, he is a threat to our agency, to the people who makes the machine of the world run.



We knew he wasn't a hacker, we watched him, we were watching his online activities. Sin had other means of getting information, other means of getting to you, the mind was his playing field, and he knew just how to navigate his way around the human mind. He had an indepth knowledge of how the human mind worlked, he understood the mind so well that he would make pshychologists blush.



We suspected that he might have had similar training to us, but if he had then whomever trained him went through a lot of trouble to hide the information from the world, there was no traces of any training, no military service records, it was as if he could assimulate knowledge and skills from others, we were confused, and to be honest, we had no idea, he was a mystery, and we knew that he was a fortress of secrets, he knew how to keep secrets, how to manipulate information and how to misdirect you.



We woke up early to prepare for our first meeting with Sin, we knew exactly where he would be, but we had to make sure that he wouldn't expect us, we had to prepare for him. We have spend months studying him, what he was about, what he was interested in, who he interacted with, we had to find a common ground in order to get a conversation going with him, we had to catch him off-gaurd so that he would let slip and give us a clue, some sort of information as to what he truly is.

Sin was known for his love for art, he was a writer, but we knew that he left clues to who he was in his writing, we read all of his material, watched all of his videos. We knew him as well as was possible to know a mystery.



Four of my team mates would go in, two would make direct contact while the other two would stay in the car, we knew what to expect, we were brieved on his abilities, we knew to avoid any form of physical contact with him as that would allow him to gain direct access to your memories, it would literally allow him to draw energy from you and thus he would have some of your memories as well as all of your strenths, we were ready.



Myself as well as two of my other team-members decided to stay back at the safe-house, Sin could not see me, he didn't know what I looked like and we decided to keep it that way as Sin has accidentally confessed that I would be the one who would eventually capture him, so we were playing his game, we were following his own visions.



Lets call them John and Dave as I prefer to protect their identities, not that it makes much of a difference, even the names that we use are not our real names, we have all had many names, many identities, I have had so many names that I cannot even remember my real name anymore.



The got to his work place and he let them in, Dave would make conversation with him while John would be present, but he would listen.



They spend about half and hour with him, Dave followed the plan to the letter, tried to find common ground, he dropped hints hoping that Sin would slip up and confess to how he knew things, but Sin the ever cool and calm level headed guy he is didn't even break a sweat, he misdirected the conversation, took control of it, before Dave knew what was going on Sin was leading the conversation, he was dropping the hints and asking the questions, he was onto us, we were not sure, but I had a feeling that he knew who we were.



Dave even tried to play on sleeping and dreaming, as Sin claimed in the past to get all of his information from dreams, but nothing. Sin just said that people sleep to much and they sleep their lives away.



Dave mentioned the supernatural and extraterrestrial, to which Sin countered with he follows UFO organisations on social media, he was a brick wall, pshychological warfare was failing, he was smart and he was prepared. It was as if he read the script and learned his lines better then we did.



As Dave and John were about to leave Dave decided to try a mental intimidation game and he shook Sin's hand, we all gasped at the action, to Dave it might have been a game of intimidation, but he gave Sin exactly what Sin wanted, direct access to his memories and all of his strengths, and just as they were about to leave he went and shook Sin's hand again. I was thinking to myself, Dave you idiot, what the hell have you done?



They then left and got back into the car from where they were watching Sin, but Sin ever so vigilent immediately went outside and checked where they went and he noticed the car, he saw them sitting in the car and he immediately allerted authorities, now you would think that we would work with the authorities on cases like this, but no we don't.



The moment Sandy saw Sin's messages on his Apps to his friends telling them about our presense and sending them a description of Dave and John as well as the car we knew we had to get out of there. We were on ghost protocol. Sin wasn't a criminal as such and well our organisation is top-secret, so none of the authorities in his country knows of our existence, he was playing our game as well. He was retaliating and he won this round.



We regrouped at the safe-house and I lost it with Dave. He knew the mission parameters and he messed up.



That is when Dave told me that it was as if he couldn't help himself, he had no control, he knew he shouldn't but he lost focus for a second and now that he thinks about it he knows that it wasn't his thoughts or his plans.



We had to think and we had little time, Sin was becoming less scared, more open, he once again released a bunch of information about the Agency and our operations online.



After a long day of going through his material over and over again we still could not find a way to get to him, it seemed like he had other-worldly friends who were helping him, protecting him, we realised that not only was Sin an experiencer, and with that I mean he was an abductee with multiple alien contacts in the past, he might not even be from our world, and I don't mean he is an alien, perhaps a hybrid of sorts, but we had access to his medical records, his blood was very much human. But we found out that he might be from a parallel universe, which would make him the only evidence of the existence of parallel worlds as well as the only witness of been able to move between them. Not only was he now a person of interest and a threat to the agency, he might have just become the most important scientific discovery of our time.



Now if you wonder why all the photographs you see online of UFO's are always blurred, or why you can't find traces of real alien contact online or evidence of cryptids online, well that is because we have a team of analysts who works tirelessly around the clock to make sure that as soon as any undisputable evidence appears online that it is taken down, any evidence appearing online of our existence is taken down immediately.



We follow and watch any claims of contact with extraterrestrials, most of them are hoaxes, some even a call for attention, I am not sure why anyone would want that kind of attention anyway, but then there is the small group of people who truly had experiences with extraterrestrials, we work through all of the date, the information, and when we find a real experience we make sure that it is either debunked or removed from the web. We have to maintain the illusion of normalcy, we have to protect the world from knowledge it is not ready for.



Sin on the other hand was smarter, he slipped through the cracks for years by hiding the truth in fiction, he was dropping breadcrumbs, mixing fact and fiction, mixing real experiences with fantastical stories. But now we have his, he made a bunch of mistakes, he forgot to change some of the information and descriptions, and it was through his descriptions of some of the beings, the technology they use and our agency that our ai's algorythm identified and flagged his content.



I just woke up from one of the worst nights of my life, as we are all sitting here trying to drink our coffee I can see that our entire team struggled to sleep, we are all tired, their faces looks dispondent, they look scared, and I can just begin to imagine why as the nightmares or well night terrors I had was so bad that if I wasn't so tired I would not even have attempted to sleep.



Sin once again got into our heads, it seems his telepathic abilities allows him to enter and manipulate even your dreams, and he was litereally in our dreams, torturing us, each one of us, we all spent most of the night trapped in our dreams, unable to wake up, unable to even move.
