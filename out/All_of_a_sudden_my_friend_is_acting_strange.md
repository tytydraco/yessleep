My friend Stacy, 20F and i 22F, planned to go on a 2 day roadtrip to go meet our other friend Mariah, who lived almost across the country, far away from us. I remember the day i asked Stacy, if she'd like to go meet Mariah, since we havent seen each other since a year now. Stacy's face lit up, she got up doing a happy dance, and came running at me to hug me. She looked very excited and so did i. 



Fast forward to the day of the roadtrip, when we were supposed to leave, Stacy filled the trunk of my car with all the thing's that we would need on the trip. After we were done doing all that, i jumped into the driver's seat, while stacy got into the passenger seat, and we started driving. 



Stacy turned the radio on, singing along Taylor Swift, screaming her head off. I was smiling ear to ear the whole time, enjoying the trip. 



4 hours into the drive, Stacy needed to use the washroom, so she told me to stop at the nearest gas station, i agreed. We saw a sign for a gas station 10 minutes later. As we neared the gas station, it looked somewhat deserted, there were no cars outside, nobody in sight, it looked abandoned. 



Stacy didnt care, she had to go immediately, so she hopped out, running into the gas station while i stayed in the car, checking my phone.

Stacy came back after making me wait for what felt like forever, "Hey! sorry it took me that long, let's get out of here now", Stacy said smiling. 



i nodded and as soon as she got in, i started driving away. A moment later, Stacy turned her head and looked at me in a strange way, it felt way too weird, the way she was staring at me, as if she was seeing me for the very first time. "What Stacy, why are you looking at me like that, as if you havent seen me before", i said irritated. 



" Umm n-no nothing as such, umm do you want some snacks?" she said grabbing a bag of snacks from the back seat, trying to not look at me. "No thanks, why are you acting so strange girl all of a sudden, what's wrong?", i asked.



"Nothing's wrong honey, i'm just tired, i think i'll just take a nap for now", she said sounding weird. Stacy placed the bag of snacks on the backseat, without even getting anything out for her. She laid her head back, making herself comfortable. She put her cap on her eyes and closed her eyes. 



5 minutes later, i looked towards Stacy and i saw her staring at me from under her cap, eyes wide as a ghost. i almost lost it at that point. Why is she acting so strange all of a sudden What's wrong with her.



i kept driving, not saying anything. It was dark outside now and Stacy kept behaving strangely the whole time. When we pulled on a less busy road, i stopped the car, i couldnt do it anymore. I got out of the car, Stacy calling behind me, after a moment she got out as well. 



"What's wrong with you Stacy? what are you doing?", i asked



"What's wrong with me? are you okay? i think you've lost your mind", Stacy screamed.



"What the fuck Stacy, i have lost my mind? i ? comeon now", i said frustrated.



" You know what, i'm not going anywhere with you, leave right now, i am not dealing with this shit anymore", she said.



"You are a monster, you are a fucking monster", Stacy blurted out, looking terrified.



" i am a monster? well, your friend said the same thing, when she was waiting for you in the car", i said laughing. "she looked terrified as well, trying to get away from me, but you see, she couldnt, i killed her, taking her form. I could tell that you caught onto it, the way you were looking at me, trying to make sense of it, of my distorted looking face".



" But damn! you look so good when you are terrified. Now do you want to go meet your friend, in heaven or hell maybe, Stacy baby?".



"N-no, where is Bella , what did you do to her? where's my friend?", she started screaming backing away from me. 



" Dont run Stacy, your fate is already sealed, you are not getting away from me".



Within a moment, i was on top of her, digging my fangs into her throat, drinking her warm amazing blood, draining her out.

I pulled on the side of a drive way. Getting out, walking up to the front door, knocking.



The door opened, "Hey Mariah!! how are you girl?".



"Stacy? why are you alone?", Mariah said after hugging me. "Wasnt Bella supposed to come with you? where is she?"



"Ah! she couldnt come, her mom got sick,she needed her there,so she had to go." 



"Umm let's go in Mariah, shall we?" i said smiling at my next victim.
