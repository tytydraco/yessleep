First of all this all started last summer i was on holiday at New york. The hotel was at a bad place at down town New York, but you can explain that because of the price
 

When i first arrived the receptionist told me that midnight something goes around the hotel knocking . She told me not to answer the door.
 First night goes by i heard knocking on the door but i ignored it because of the words of the receptionist.
 The second day something strange happened i went to a restaurant to eat, i  there someone asked me where i lived when i told him. Then he went pale and started shivering he told me that i should live immediately, he said something lives there something evil .That night something weird happened the knocking was louder.


  The last day i didn't left the room i waited for the night . The knocking started as usual and i did the mistake to answer the door. At first nobody was there. So i closed the door when i turned i saw it a tall figure eyes black ,limbs impossibly big his mouth wide open.

 I opened the door and sprinted as fast as possible i tried to exit the hotel but the locks were closed . While it was walking slowly towards me slowly. I saw a janitor's closet and i entered it.
 
 I waited till morning it disappeared so i left terrified 
  At home i waited till 11:59 and waited, waited and waited that minute was an eternity for me till it happened 00:00 midnight finally came and the knocking started boud loudly i waited all night it stopped at morning finally.

  The morning i went to the library i found a book covered in dust it said that that thing was not alive it was a curse it was a ghost of some type it tries to make someone to answer when it is knocking it then kills the the person who dies becomes the ghost and starts knocking in a random location but if you see its face it starts to follow you so you will become it, it is basically a cycle.

 Then i saw my watch it was closing time so they kicked me out of the library.

  Midnight came so i sat at the couch and heard it knocking it was loud the door shook  like hell. I waited till morning then i went to security place and they helped me install some cameras at my door.
 
 Midnight came and knocking started i looked at the cameras i saw it hitting the door violently so hard that it almost broke . That day was almost the final day before the door broke.
  
I had an idea that day i  thought of an amazing idea i would call someone to answer the door instead of me so he would be made to that thing. I invited my friend Rey over. 

 Midnight came and the knocking started so i made Rey open the door when she did that thing took  her and disappeared.

  I am dumb really dumb i didn't just killed my friend but i almost killed myself. This is what  i mean. This midnight i woke up because someone knocked my door. I thought  the curse was over for me so i opened the door and i saw it i closed the door quickly i went to my bathroom quickly.

  I  heard it broke my door. I had only one option jump out of the bathroom window.

  I ran and ran in to my back yard forest . 
  Some time in early morning i reached society it was a random neighbour. 
  I had a dumb idea i saw a taxi i asked the driver to take me to new York he said no because it was a state away but i gave him five hundred dollars and told him drive so he did.

 When i arrived at new york i went to the same hotel it all started the receptionist saw me and told me why i left without paying i explained her and she went pale. She told me to wait to a room till midnight and she would stay outside waiting. 

Midnight came i heard a scream i opened the door and saw her dead on the floor and the monster next to her i punched it at the face it screamed i ran to the closet that i had hid at the start of all of this.For the next three days it knocked continuously the third day i opened the door and ran but it was nowhere but the knocking when i turned around i saw it on the sealing besides me its black eyes looked at mine i saw her  Rey she was mad angry at me she was suffering she wanted to kill me . 
 
Then it punched me back its punch so powerful that it broke my teeth then it disappeared i saw a police officer talking to me before i passed out .

  I woke to the hospital i saw the police officer besides me he said he was called because someone heard screams my screams from the hotel.later that midnight i heard knocking from the window we were at the top floor. 

 Next night the window broke it came inside and tried to eat me. But i woke up unharmed i saw the police officer besides me he said he was called because someone heard screams my screams from the hotel.later that midnight i heard knocking from the window.                                                          
 
  Then i paused for a minute now it was showing up in my dreams i decided to ask someone to stay with me this night. This night the knocking didn't happen . Then i took my phone and looked at my phone i went to the pictures and saw a page of the book it said the only way to break the curse is to say some words.  
   
Then i ordered to stay alone for the night then at the night the window broke i saw its pale skin its torn clothes and its void for eyes and when i looked into them i saw nothing, as i sat there i realised that Rey wasn't trapped in there it was just an illusion from the dehydration that day. And it came for me and i screamed the words. I saw it for the first time scared it ran into the night.
 
 From that day on i never saw it again so remember if you hear knocking at your door in to the midnight NEVER answer it
