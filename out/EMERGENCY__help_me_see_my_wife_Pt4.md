I saw something today, some sort of figure moving around. It looked like a wispy, not so solid figure. Like the only solid bits looked like a bone structure around empty eyes, and a pure white hand that reached out. I guess the “solid” parts could have been some sort of mascarade mask and white glove, but it looked like they turned to ash at the edges, and if looked like bone. That, or they faded into some mist. It also had a sort of white glow around it, like the general shape of a person. I noticed it in the mirror earlier today. It didn't fade away as I looked at it through the mirror, but I turned around and it wasn't there. When I turned back, it wasn't in the mirror either. I haven't seen it since, but it was creepy. Anyone have answers for that one?  I’ve never seen anything like it in horror movies or urban legends so any advice would help. I don’t know which ritual brought it here, but is it friendly, evil, or maybe indifferent??? It could have maybe been the spirit of my wife, but it looked too tall and it’s hand was too big unless her soul was bigger than her body?

I'm outside in my car now. This thing has freaked me out so much. I had to tell my friend and he asked me to compare it to something, but I don't know what it reminds me of. I'm going to keep writing this post because I find it relaxing, so sorry if I start to ramble.

I think one of the rituals has had an effect on me, or maybe it's my diet, but my stomach has been going through every problem in the book. Some days I feel like I'm being stabbed, some I'm super nauseous, but I have been feeling terrible. I don't think I've eaten anything rotten, but if I had to imagine what it would feel like afterwards, this is it. I've had salmonella once in my life, and I'd prefer that instead. I'll try going to the doctor soon. 

I can hear the metal noises again. I'm not sure what's going on, but it's loud. It sounds like someone in the neighborhood is throwing chains at metal. It's not really helping my nerves. I have music going now. I couldn’t keep hearing that stuff. I don't know what's going on. I just turned on some music to drown out the noise. 

My grass is dead. She's dead. I feel dead inside. Why is everything dead? 

I'm on edge. I've been out in this car for nearly an hour. I don't know if I can go back in. I need food. 

There are so many “for sale” signs in this neighborhood. Probably from whoever is banging metal. 

I just noticed my hand is covered in scratches. When did that happen? Am I going insane? Do you think I'm insane? I don't know what's going on.

I feel so sick. I know I need to eat but I don't want to eat. 

I feel like there are spiders on me. On my legs, arms, back, head. I feel like I'm being touched all over, like spiders are on me. 

What the hell was the mask thing? I tried to draw it. I tried to describe it to a friend and he thought it was some movie monster so I had to draw it. Keep in mind, I'm not an artist, so I tried my best to recreate it. I'm sure my wife would have drawn it perfectly, but I tried. I moved my car before I drew it. I'm at the park now. I'm still hearing noises. My car is rumbling or something. I keep looking around expecting to see it. 

I added some finishing touches on it. Things I think were part of it. What do I call it? Him? Her? The white mask? The masked thing? The ghost? It's more than a ghost. It was there. It was just feet from me. WHY WAS IT WATCHING ME 

My car just died. What the hell? Was it running for too long? Maybe. Probably. I'm going to find someone with cables to get a jump. 

I got my car started and went to my wife's favorite fast food place. I got my comfort meal and I'm going to head back home. I don't know how long it's been since I saw that thing, at least a few hours. Wish me luck.

Edit: I posted the picture on my profile.
