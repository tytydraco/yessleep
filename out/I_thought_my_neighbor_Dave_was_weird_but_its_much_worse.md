A new neighbor arrived to the neighborhood, apparently he wanted to throw a party for everyone, not just neighbors everyone in town. He contacted the local police, the student council, even Local politicians.

I watched them all arrive to Dave's party behind my blinds rubbing the mucus running from nose just to come rolling down once more. I was right in the middle of the flu and so all I could do was watch. The first thing that tipped me off about Dave, other than the massive party was his meal selection. He had the usual, hot dogs, burgers, baked beans but it was all small supply. beans ran out after twenty people, burgers after fifty,  and hotdogs after seventy, but there was plenty of egg salad.

Batches and batches of egg salad were on display, and people apparently loved it because I saw everyone eating it. first as a side dish and as the party continued  Styrofoam plates full of it. I thought that would of been the end but as people left I saw Dave, finally getting a better look at him. He was white, probably around 5'5 and looked to be in his forties but the way he moved was just to flexible. He was wearing a cream colored button up t-shirt with teal lines on it Tucked into some denim blue jeans with a black belt and some type of white sneaker.  And in his hand was a small dish of egg salad that he gave to each guest before they left.

I finally looked away, going to my couch and grabbing the open bottle of water and drinking before I heard a knock on my door.

"Hello there! Daniel right? Samantha told me your name, you know Samantha your neighbor, well I guess our neighbor." He let out let out a few small chuckles before continuing.

"I felt bad that you weren't able to join the party, but as my dad taught me you never leave someone out of some good fun or good food. So I brought you two things of Dave's famous egg salad."

I got up slowly my stomach twisting in knots as I approach the door. "Um thank you Dave but I'll just take one." I lived alone, and after seeing what had to be pounds of egg salad it didn't sound good in general.

"Oh don't be silly Billy, oops I mean Daniel haha. One is for you and one for a friend, but I won't blame ya for eating both." Another laugh into the night as I heard a soft thump at the side of the door "it will be sitting here waiting for ya to eat it all up, see ya around!" I heard him step away and with how I felt I would of just left them outside until I walked past my blinds and I saw Dave on the sidewalk watching, waiting.

I groaned, I thought he was just simply a annoying neighbor. I got the tubberware from outside, Dave giving a big wave and walking away as I went back inside and to the kitchen where I placed the dishes, putting one in the fridge and I inspected the other. It must of been good after all I watched people scarf it down, so I just wanted a good look; my stomach not being ready for anything more complex than oatmeal.

Cracking the lid open I looked upon the most, it had to be the best egg salad I've ever seen. The perfect blend of mayo, mustard, dill, the gleaming egg whites and the onions perfectly minced in. All ruined as the knots in my stomach released the bile from stomach all over the dish. After a hour or so of cleaning my kitchen. I decided I needed to rest. Maybe tomorrow I will have some egg salad.
