I’m not looking for advice or comfort.

I just need someone to tell me this sounds like something a human brain could actually experience and still function afterward.

I’ve already done the checklist. Carbon monoxide, black mold, sleep deprivation, stress, misremembered details. I went down every branch of “rational explanation” until all that was left was this ugly little knot in the middle.

I know what I saw. I know what I heard. And I know what isn’t here anymore.

You can say I’m wrong. That’s fine.

Just don’t tell me I imagined it.

It started with a screenshot.

My friend Liam sent it in our group chat at two in the morning—just a grainy image of a concrete hallway with peeling green paint and a line of doors, no handles, each with a black number stenciled above it.

Beneath it was a caption:

“South annex, Building D. Stairs go down three more floors than the blueprints say. Do NOT go past the second landing. You’ll know why.”

The username was blurred out. The site was some dead urbex board, archived and scraped. The original thread was gone when I tried to find it. Only that screenshot, floating around in reposts and image dumps.

Liam lives for that kind of thing.

Abandoned hospitals, half-finished overpasses, flood tunnels—the kind of places that smell like rust and wet drywall. I’m usually the one who says, “We should not be here, we’re going to get arrested or fall through something,” and he’s the one who laughs it off and keeps going.

This time I didn’t say no.

I told myself it was because the place was local. Forty-five minutes outside town, out near an industrial park that never really took off. Most of the shells out there got turned into storage, or just sat empty with For Lease banners sagging off the facades.

Liam had done his homework.

“The address used to be a small research lab,” he said, riding shotgun while I drove. “Defense contractor spin-off, closed in the eighties. Officially they did materials testing. Unofficially, there’s a bunch of rumors about human factors stuff. Sleep deprivation, sensory experiments, you know.”

I kept my eyes on the road. “Rumors from where?”

He shrugged. “Old forum. Most of the links are dead. That’s the fun part.”

He said “fun” like normal people say “mildly concerning.”

It was overcast that afternoon—bright but flat, the sky the color of old receipts. The industrial park looked wrong in a way I can’t quite explain. Too much empty concrete. Too many loading docks with no trucks. The kind of place that felt like it was built for a future that never happened.

Building D didn’t have a sign.

Just a two-story slab of faded brick with blacked-out windows and a chain-link fence sagging in front. A rusted padlock hung through the gate, closed but not actually latched. Someone before us had cut the link and then looped it back through to make it look secure.

Liam grinned, then sobered when he saw my face.

“We can always bail,” he said. “Walk around, take some photos, go home.”

“Let’s just see the first floor,” I said.

I still don’t know why those words came out of my mouth.

Inside, the air was stale and dry, like a building that had been sealed too long. Dust lay thick on everything. The lobby had that late-70s institutional feel—tan tile, metal-framed glass doors, a front desk with a dead computer still sitting on it.

Someone had spray-painted a crude smiley face on one wall, black on beige.

We stepped through a doorway behind the desk and into a long corridor. Most of the offices were gutted—wires hanging, ceiling tiles missing, stains on the carpet that had no business still being damp.

“Smell that?” Liam asked.

I did. Something metallic and sharp underneath the dust. Not quite blood. Not quite chemical. Just wrong.

“This is probably where they did testing,” he said, sticking his head into a room with a one-way mirror. “Cool, right?”

“Sure.” My voice sounded thin. “Where’s the annex?”

He pulled his phone out. “The screenshot said south annex. That should be… that way.”

He pointed down the hallway.

We walked.

Every few yards, there was a door with a room number stenciled on it. 112. 114. 116. The numbers jumped sometimes. 120 straight to 126. A door with no number. Then 118 where it shouldn’t be.

I chalked it up to renovations, or offices being repurposed.

At the end of the corridor there was a plain metal door with a faded EXIT sign above it, unlit.

Liam pushed it open.

On the other side was that hallway from the screenshot.

Same dull green paint, flaking off in strips. Same narrow strip of linoleum down the middle. And the doors—maybe a dozen of them on each side, evenly spaced, each with a small black number above it.

But in person, the numbers were wrong.

The first one read 0.

The next was 0.

Then 0 again.

Our footsteps sounded too loud.

“Okay,” I whispered without meaning to. “That’s—”

Liam walked ahead, head tilted, studying the digits. “They painted over them,” he said. “Look. You can see the edges underneath.”

He was right. The black 0s were crisp, but around the edges you could see the faint ghosts of other numbers, darker against the paint. 101, 103, 105, all slightly offset under the zeros like something had tried to erase them and given up halfway.

At the far end of the hall, a red EXIT sign glowed faintly.

“No power in here, but that’s on,” I said.

“Emergency battery, maybe,” Liam said. “Old buildings sometimes keep those separate.”

His voice sounded muted, like someone had put a blanket over his mouth.

Halfway down the hall, I realized the air felt thicker. Not humid, exactly. Just heavy, like every breath had to squeeze through something.

We stopped at one of the 0s.

The door underneath it had no handle, no lock, no hinges on this side. Just a rectangular slot at eye level, like a mail slot turned vertical. Liam bent down and peered through.

“Don’t,” I hissed.

He ignored me. “It’s just dark,” he said. “Can’t see anything.”

He lifted his phone, turned on the flashlight, and angled it toward the slot.

The beam didn’t go anywhere.

It hit the opening and just… stopped. Like the light itself was being swallowed. No reflection. No dust motes. Just a hard cutoff.

Liam frowned and pulled back. “Weird. Might be angled weird inside.”

There was a sound down the hall.

Soft. A kind of dry shuffle. No echo.

We both froze.

“Probably a raccoon,” Liam murmured, but his eyes looked wrong.

The sound came again.

Not closer. Not farther. Just there.

I realized I couldn’t tell which direction it came from. Left, right, above—it all felt the same. The hallway had no acoustics. Like it was designed to keep noise from bouncing.

“Let’s find the stairwell,” I said. “See it, then bounce. Deal?”

He hesitated, then nodded. “Deal.”

We kept walking.

The EXIT sign at the far end never seemed to get closer. It stayed the same size, the same distance away, no matter how many steps we took.

I checked my watch without thinking about it. We walked what felt like a full minute. The sign didn’t move.

“Okay,” I said. “That’s—”

“Perspective,” Liam cut in quickly. “This hall’s just longer than it looks. The paint lines—”

The EXIT sign flickered.

Once, like a blink.

When it came back on, it was closer.

Not a little. A lot.

One step away, hanging right over the door.

I hadn’t seen the walls move. I didn’t remember walking further. But there it was.

Liam laughed once, high and strained. “Trippy,” he said. “Just a trick of—”

The sound came again.

That dry shuffle. This time followed by a faint tap, like something hard touching the floor, once.

I was done.

“Stairs, then out,” I said. “That’s it.”

He pushed the door open.

The stairwell looked normal at first glance.

Concrete steps. Metal handrail. The kind of institutional stair tower you see in parking garages and schools. The walls were bare except for small black numbers stenciled at each landing:

1 at the top,

0 one level down,

-1 under that.

Someone had scratched a line through the -1 with something sharp.

There was no up. No roof access. Just down.

“You saw the screenshot,” Liam said, his voice soft. “He said the stairs go down farther than the building should allow. And not to go past the second landing.”

He put his hand on the rail.

“Second landing and we leave,” he said. “Scout’s honor.”

“You were never a scout.”

“Good. Those dudes would hate this.”

He started down.

The air grew colder with each step.

By the time we reached the landing marked 0, my hands were shaking and I couldn’t tell if it was fear or temperature. I wiped my palm on my jeans. The sweat left a darker streak than it should have.

There was a door at that landing. No number. No window.

“Don’t,” I said when he reached for it.

He actually stopped.

“One more flight,” he said. “Just to see if the numbering keeps going.”

I didn’t move.

He looked back up at me. “We already came in here,” he said. “If someone’s gonna yell at us, that ship sailed. Two landings and we bounce. Come on.”

The landing under that was stenciled -1 again.

No scratch through this one.

The door at this level had a black 0 above it.

The same 0 as in the hallway. Same stencil. Same thickness.

“Okay,” I said. “We’ve seen it. You said second landing. Let’s—”

The stairwell lights went out.

Every bulb popped in the same instant—not loud, just a flat little crackle.

Then there was only the thin beam of Liam’s phone flashlight, and the smaller circle of my headlamp.

They didn’t reach far.

“Not funny,” I said. My voice sounded muffled, swallowed by the concrete. “Liam.”

“That wasn’t me,” he said quietly.

Somewhere below us, something shifted.

Not feet. Not an animal. More like a heavy piece of fabric unfurling. Dry. Slow.

Liam turned his light downward.

We didn’t see anything.

We didn’t see darkness, either. Not in the way you’re supposed to. The light just… met a flat gray, like he was shining it on fog that refused to show its depth.

My eyes started to water.

“Up,” I said. “Now.”

He nodded and turned to climb back.

We went up one flight.

When we reached the landing, the stencil above it read -1.

Liam stopped.

“That’s not possible,” he said.

“There were only two levels,” I said. “We started at 1, then 0, then -1. We went down to -1. We’re back at 0. That’s—”

The number on the wall changed.

We were both watching when it happened.

The 0 didn’t smear or get repainted—it just wasn’t a 0 anymore. The paint stayed exactly where it was, but my brain suddenly recognized a different shape. Like someone had flipped a switch in my head.

It read -1.

Liam’s breathing picked up. “We miscounted,” he said. “It’s fine. It’s—”

He took three steps up.

There was no landing there.

Just more stairs going down.

Same direction.

Same walls.

He turned around, slowly, still holding onto the rail.

The steps behind him went down too.

We were in the same vertical slice of space, over and over.

“Stop moving,” I said. My throat hurt. “Just stop.”

We stood there.

There was no sound for a moment.

Then we heard it.

Not the shuffle from the hallway.

This was a tapping. Light, precise, like nails on glass. It started below us, above us, all around at once. Not random. A pattern.

Tap tap tap. Pause. Tap. Longer pause. Tap tap.

It took me a second to realize it was matching our breathing.

When I inhaled, it did.

When I held my breath, it did too.

When I exhaled, it followed a half-second later.

“Do you hear that?” I whispered.

Liam didn’t answer.

I looked at him.

He wasn’t looking at the stairs anymore. He was staring at the wall in front of us, where the -1 had been.

The paint wasn’t plain there anymore.

Tiny black marks had appeared—just above eye level, a cluster of faint vertical lines, almost like tally marks. They hadn’t been there a second before.

There were two groups of them, side by side.

One had a gap underneath it, like a missing line.

Liam reached out, hand shaking, and touched the wall under the emptier group.

His fingertips came away with gray dust on them that hadn’t been there before.

“Don’t touch it,” I snapped. “What are you doing?”

“It’s counting,” he said. His voice sounded far away. “There’s one missing.”

He wiped his hand on his shirt.

A small gray streak remained on his palm, like someone had pressed fingers of concrete into his skin.

We needed a reference point.

I pulled a Sharpie from my pocket—the same one I’d used to sign forms at work that morning—and, with my hand shaking, I drew a big, stupid, obvious arrow on the wall, pointing to the stairs.

“Even if it rotates or whatever, we’ll know we’ve been here before,” I said. “We follow it. If we loop back and see the arrow again, we stop.”

Liam gave a tight nod.

We started moving.

Up, I think.

The stairs didn’t feel like they went either way anymore. There was just motion and concrete and that tapping sound, always hovering at the edge of hearing, adjusting to our lungs.

We passed a landing.

The stencil above it read -2.

My legs started to burn. My chest hurt. The arrow never appeared. The walls all looked the same.

After what felt like ten flights, my legs started shaking so badly I had to stop.

“I can’t,” I panted.

Liam stopped a step above me. “Okay. Okay. Let’s…” He trailed off.

The wall at the landing beside us had changed again.

The tally marks now had more lines.

One cluster. No gap.

“There,” he said, and his voice broke completely. “There it is. Filled in.”

“Filled what in?” My mouth was dry.

He looked at me like he was only just realizing I was there.

“You ever feel like a place is expecting you?” he whispered.

Before I could answer, the tapping stopped.

All at once.

The silence that followed was worse.

Because underneath it, you could hear something else.

A faint rasp, like air being pulled through a long, narrow space. Not from below or above. From behind the walls. From inside them.

I felt it in my teeth.

I didn’t decide to move. My body just did.

I grabbed Liam’s wrist and ran.

I don’t know if we went up or down. My feet hit concrete, over and over, and the rails burned my palm. The landings flashed past, numbers smearing together, -3, -4, a blank one, another 0, all wrong, all out of order.

The rasp grew louder.

At one landing, I felt the floor dip slightly, like the concrete had softened, just enough for my heel to sink a fraction of an inch. The wall to my right rippled, just once, like something behind it had pressed closer.

“Don’t stop,” I gasped.

We didn’t.

At some point, light appeared above us.

Not the flat fluorescent of the stairwell. Actual daylight. Weak, cloudy, but real.

I couldn’t tell you how far away it was. It felt close and impossibly distant at the same time. But it was a direction.

“Up,” I said. “There. That’s up.”

We ran.

The rasping stayed with us, matching our speed, never closer, never farther. There was one last landing, unmarked, with a door hanging half open. Beyond it, a short hallway, then smashed-out windows, then a strip of grass and old asphalt.

We burst through like we were breaking the surface of water.

The air outside hit my lungs like a punch.

I fell to my knees on the cracked pavement.

For a long time, the only sound was us breathing. Real echo, real wind, real distant hum of the highway.

Then I realized Liam wasn’t making any noise.

I looked up.

He was still inside the doorway.

Standing perfectly still, one hand on the frame, the other hanging limp at his side. The light from outside cut across his face in a hard line, leaving his eyes in shadow.

“Come on,” I said. “Liam. Let’s go.”

He tilted his head.

Just a fraction. Not a natural angle. Too slow.

His fingers flexed once, like he was remembering the motion.

Every hair on my body stood on end.

“Liam,” I said again.

He stepped forward.

Something was wrong with his posture.

He moved like his limbs had been put back together by someone who had read the instructions but never seen the finished product. Too deliberate. Every joint a half-second late.

He stopped in front of me.

Up close, his face looked mostly normal. A little pale. A little drawn. His eyes were dilated, which made sense given the light change.

Then he smiled.

Liam has a crooked smile. One side of his mouth hooks higher than the other. It’s one of the first things people notice about him.

This smile went up evenly.

Everything in me recoiled.

“You okay?” I asked, my voice coming out too loud.

He blinked. Once. Slowly.

“We made it out,” he said.

His tone was right. The words were right. But the rhythm was just… off. Like he was reading from a line with no idea what it meant.

Behind him, the stairwell door eased closed on its own.

I didn’t hear it latch. I didn’t hear anything at all from inside. No rasping. No tapping. Just a flat, swallowed silence.

Something white was stuck to his shirt, near the hem.

It looked like dust at first. When he shifted, it slid a little. Not powder. A thin strip of something, embedded just under the fabric, the way a hospital wristband sits under a cuff.

I reached toward it without thinking.

He stepped back so fast I barely saw the movement.

“Don’t,” he said.

His voice didn’t sound wrong that time.

We stared at each other.

“Okay,” I said. “Okay. Let’s just… go home.”

Driving back, he stared out the window the whole time. He didn’t check his phone, didn’t put music on, didn’t make any of his usual stupid jokes about how I baby the brakes.

At one point, I thought I saw faint gray smudges on his fingers, the same color as the concrete dust from the tally marks.

When I dropped him off at his apartment, he turned to look at me.

“You should delete the photos,” he said.

“We didn’t take any.”

He nodded, slowly, as if that made sense.

“Right,” he said. “Good.”

Then he went inside.

I sat there in the car for a while, engine ticking as it cooled, feeling like I’d just skipped a scene somehow.

At home, I locked the door, took a shower that ran out of hot water, and still couldn’t shake the sensation of stairwell air clinging to my lungs.

I didn’t sleep that night.

Or the next.

Part of it was adrenaline. Part of it was this low-level dread that if I closed my eyes, I’d open them again on a landing with a number that shouldn’t exist.

By the third night, I caved and tried to call Liam.

His number went straight to a generic “This line is not in service” message.

I tried texting anyway.

The message bounced.

I checked our group chat.

Every message he’d ever sent—the memes, the photos, the plans—were still there. But his name at the top of the thread was gone. Just a gray bubble that said “Unknown.”

The saved contact in my phone had turned blank. No name. No number. Just an empty field and a little spinning circle that never resolved.

I checked social media.

Nothing.

Not his profile. Not pictures. Not tagged posts. Old comments people had made to him were still there, but their replies made no sense now—half a conversation with a missing half.

I called another friend, Jenna, who’d known him longer than I had.

“Hey,” I said, trying to sound casual. “Question. You talked to Liam lately?”

There was a pause.

“Who?” she said.

“Liam,” I repeated. “Tall, black hair, the guy who dragged us to that stupid flea market in July?”

“Are you okay?” she asked slowly.

I hung up.

I know how that looks.

Memory can be weird. People slip through the cracks. Maybe I conflated two friends. Maybe I’d been more stressed than I realized. That’s what I told myself for about thirty seconds.

Then someone slid something under my apartment door.

I heard the soft scrape against the tile. That was it. No footsteps. No knock. Just that one quiet sound.

I stared at the door for a good minute before moving.

There was no one in the hall when I opened it.

No elevator sound. No closing doors. Just the faint hum of the building AC.

On the floor in front of the threshold was a strip of plastic.

The size and shape of an old-fashioned label. Off-white, edges slightly curled, one side faintly sticky like it had been peeled off a surface and reapplied a few times.

I picked it up.

On one side, there were small black marks.

Tally lines.

Five, then a space, then another cluster of five, then another, all in a neat row. Someone had drawn them with something fine and precise. At the end of the last group, there was a faint smear, like the pen had hesitated.

Underneath the tallies, in tiny block letters, was a single word.

LIAM.

The ink had bled slightly into the plastic.

On the back was something else.

It wasn’t any symbol I recognized, but it didn’t scream “mystical rune” either. Just three short horizontal lines stacked on top of each other, with a single vertical line cut cleanly through the middle—like a logo from some company I’d never heard of, except the proportions felt off in a way I couldn’t put into words.

There were more shapes beneath that. Smaller, tighter together. They could’ve been letters from some other alphabet, or just someone doodling with a fine-point pen. When I looked at them too long, my eyes started to cross, like my brain was trying to read them and failing.

At the very bottom, in letters that were slightly more jagged, like the hand writing them wasn’t used to this alphabet, there was a sentence.

Four words.

“YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO SEE.”

The T in “to” was a little off, like whoever wrote it had almost made a different shape first.

My hands shook so hard I nearly dropped the strip.

I checked the hallway again.

Empty.

I checked the locks. Twice.

Then I sat down on the floor with my back against the door and tried to breathe normally.

I know what you’re thinking.

If this is real, I should burn the label. Move. Tell someone. Call the cops. Get a psych evaluation. Something.

I haven’t done any of that yet.

Because every time I think about taking it out of the drawer where I hid it, I hear that tapping again.

Soft, precise, just on the edge of hearing.

Keeping time with my breath.

I haven’t been back to Building D.

I checked satellite images. The industrial park is still there. The brick shell is still there. When I zoomed all the way in on satellite view, the south side of the building turned into a smear of gray pixels. Could just be a bad image stitch or compression artifact, but it bothered me more than it should have.

I tried to drive out there once.

I made it as far as the highway exit before my hands locked on the steering wheel and my vision tunneled. I pulled into a gas station, sat there shaking until the sun went down, then drove home without ever getting off.

I keep thinking about the tally marks on the wall.

How there was one gap.

And how it wasn’t there later.

Whatever lives in that stairwell knew exactly how many people belonged to it.

Then it let me walk out.

I don’t know why.

Maybe it needed someone to carry the memory. To keep the shape of that place alive outside of it. To drag other eyes back to the idea of a staircase that doesn’t go up or down the way it should.

Maybe that label was a reminder.

Or a receipt.

I’m not writing this for entertainment.

I’m writing it because I can’t stop counting breaths now. Mine. Other people’s. The rhythm of footsteps in the hallway, the ticks of the radiator, the blink of the router light.

I keep waiting for something to fall into sync.

Sometimes, around three in the morning, I wake up with the exact sensation of my hand on a cold metal rail.

Like I never stopped climbing.

Like I’m still on that landing somewhere, staring at a wall that doesn’t say what it’s supposed to.

And sometimes, when the building is quiet and there’s no traffic outside, I swear I hear it again.

Not the tapping.

Not the rasping.

Just the soft, deliberate sound of something counting, just out of sight, one floor at a time.
