Hi, I’m Alex, and I’m terrified. Not because of something lurking in the shadows, but because my life is slipping away from me, piece by piece, and I don’t know why. It started two weeks ago, and I’m writing this down before I lose what’s left of myself. Please, bear with me—I need someone to know what’s happening.

It all kicked off with a photo. I was rummaging through my closet when I found a dusty box of pictures. The top one showed me at a wedding, smiling next to a bride and groom I didn’t recognize. I was holding a champagne glass, looking happy as hell. But here’s the thing: I have zero memory of that day.

I thought it was a mix-up, so I showed it to my sister. She laughed and said, “That’s from Cousin Emily’s wedding last year. You got drunk and danced with the flower girl.” My stomach sank. “I wasn’t there,” I told her. “I’ve never even met Emily.” She frowned and said I’d driven up with her, stayed at some crummy motel. But I couldn’t remember any of it. It was like a blank spot in my head.

I tried to shrug it off, but then weirder stuff started happening. A few days later, I noticed a small scar on my arm—thin, white, like it’d been there forever. I’d never seen it before. I asked my mom, and she said, “You got that when you were seven, fell off your bike.” I told her I’d never fallen off my bike. She looked worried and insisted she’d been there when it happened. But I know that’s not true.

The gaps kept growing. At work, my boss thanked me for fixing a bug I didn’t touch. My best friend talked about a movie we saw together last month nothing. It was like someone was rewriting my life, and I was the only one noticing.

I started a journal to keep track of what I remembered each day. It was my lifeline. But then it turned on me. One morning, I opened it and found entries I didn’t write:

“October 10th: Had lunch with Sarah at that new café. She told me about her promotion. I ordered a turkey sandwich.”

I don’t know a Sarah. I’ve never been to that café. But it was my handwriting. There were more:

“October 12th Finished that book Mom recommended. Called her to talk about it.”

I hadn’t read a book in months or called my mom in weeks. My sister just said I was “spacey,” but this wasn’t me forgettingthis was something else.

Then my apartment changed. I woke up one day, and the walls were pale blue they’d always been white. My fabric couch was leather. Even my cat’s eyes were green instead of yellow. I called my landlord, freaking out. He said, “Your walls have always been blue. You got that leather couch when you moved in.” I wanted to scream.

Under my pillow, I found a note in my handwriting:

“They’re changing everything. Don’t trust your memories. Don’t trust anyone. Find the truth before you forget who you are.”

Had I written it? I didn’t know. I dug through old emails and found one from six months ago, anonymous, signed “A”

“Subject: Don’t forget.

You agreed to this. You wanted to forget. But it’s gone too far. You need to stop them before it’s too late.”
Agreed to what? Forget what? My head was spinning.

Last night, I dreamed I was strapped to a chair in a white room, surrounded by blurry figures in lab coats. One whispered, “You asked for this. You wanted to erase the pain. We can’t stop it now.” I woke up soaked in sweat, wondering if it was real.
Every day, I feel less like me. My memories are fading, replaced by ones that don’t fit. I used to be outgoing—now I’m paranoid, quiet. And just now, a memory hit me that isn’t mine: I’m in a dark alley, holding a bloody knife, a body at my feet. I don’t know who it is, but it feels real.

I’m posting this because I’m scared I’m disapearing. If you see me, and I don’t know you, remember this version of me—the one writing this. Not whatever I’m turning into. I don’t know if I’m losing my mind or if something’s rewriting me, but I’m running out of time. If I don’t update, don’t look for me. I don’t know what I might do next...
