I went back to Mockingbird Wood

This is a continuation of a previous post that you can find [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kvj2qq/i_went_to_mockingbird_wood_with_my_friends/)

  
I was sitting in my car outside Mockingbird Wood. The sun was barely starting to set, beginning its slow descent beneath the skyline. I was smoking a joint to calm my nerves, loading shells into the shotgun I had sitting in my lap. Was it a smart idea to get high before entering the woods at night with a firearm? Absolutely not. Was that about to stop me? Absolutely not.

Somewhere in that collection of trees and solitude was a monster, a monster that had killed five of my friends. I owed it to them to make sure that thing joined them in their eternal sleep. I was terrified, remembering all the things that had happened on that moonlit evening, but the memory of Mark, Martin, Maddie, Rachel and Jessie wouldn't allow me to just go back to my life like nothing had happened.

The days after the attack were the most frustrating of my life. The police that investigated the incident tried to tell me that the bodies they had found were the results of a bear attack. I have never seen a bear in my life, but I'm pretty sure if one were attacked by a bear, they would scream, panic, beg for help. There had been none of that. Not a single whimper had come to my ears as I lay at the bottom of that ridge. I wasn't even completely sure of when it had happened, though I believed it was when I heard that first eruption of birdsong flood the night. I tried not to think about it, ending up as unsuccessful as I was every time the thought of my friends dying penetrated my consciousness.

It's so difficult to lose someone, but even harder when you know the thing that took that person from you is still running around free to kill again. That's why I was here. It wasn't just to balance the debt the creature had accumulated with me, but to make sure no one else had to live through this.

The sun wasn't even fully down when the moon made its ghostly appearance in the sky. I stepped out of the car and closed the door behind me, feeling waves of grief and anger washing over me as I hefted my shotgun. It had once been a tool for downing pheasant and ducks, but now it would serve a different purpose. The twelve gauge was fully loaded with slugs, each packing enough of a punch to take a man's head off his shoulders. I wasn't about to take any chances with whatever was out there. I was going into this thing's domain and only one of us would be walking out.

I popped the trunk of my car and retrieved a roll of duct-tape and a flashlight. I couldn't afford a tactical light to attach to my old twelve gauge, but as the time honored saying of every redneck goes, “duct-tape fixes everything.” Well, almost everything. It couldn't fix the loss of my friends. Mark would have laughed at that. He loved dark humor.

I flicked on the flashlight and once again made my way into Mockingbird Wood. The familiar sense of serenity I would feel every time I entered this place of memories didn't reach me that night, but the sense of solitude still hung thick in the air. I would always think of my ancient ancestors, the hunter-gatherers from prehistory that would contend with monsters in the wilderness for survival. On that night, I never felt closer to them.

I paused when I passed the place where I had seen Mark's body, stopping to look up into the distant branches above and shuddering at the memory of his twisted limbs and torn skin. He had been my best friend and knowing that he had been killed so brutally filled me with an anger that I couldn't bury. I had been mostly scared as I entered those woods, but that memory overshadowed my terror and filled me with rage. That rage was muted with heavy sorrow as the flashlight glistened on the branches above still slick with blood. For Mark's sake, I wasn't about to back down now.

I would flinch every time a stick broke under my feet or the wind rustled the leaves of the trees. It was fall now, and the woods were covered in the firecracker-loud detritus of dry foliage. This was both good and bad for me. It meant I stood a better chance of hearing the beast lurking out there, but also meant it could hear my clumsy footfalls more easily. After all, my ankle still wasn't healed from my fall. That was okay, I wasn't hiding from it this time. I wasn't running either.

I made my way over the stones that provided a natural bridge across the river and started up the hill to the little clearing that held so many good memories as well as the worst one of my life. It had been special to us, a sacred place that represented the friendship we all shared. At some point, there had been a log with three “M”s carved into it, but it must have long since rotted into nothingness. I felt like there may have been some sort of living metaphor in that, the bits of my friends rotting to nothingness in the cold ground where once had been people I loved. I reassured myself that they wouldn't be rotting alone soon.

I stopped once I reached the center of the clearing, the night fully fallen by now. Stars shined through the treetops and the full moon painted the surrounding landscape in its sterling light. I hadn't given much thought to any kind of plan when I decided to come out here. I just decided to take a shotgun into the woods and kill this thing, but beyond that, I really didn't have much of an idea of what to do. So, like I had done a hundred other times in this place, back when my friends were alive, I gathered some dry wood and placed it in the divot we had dug into the ground. I used dry grass and leaves as kindling to start the fire and smiled, remembering all the little campfires I had made up here with Mark and Martin. Not even the horror I had experienced that night could erase all the time we spent here being friends. I don't think anything ever would.

Time dragged by with the only sounds being the crackling of the fire and the soft crunch of my own movements over the dead leaves that littered the ground. I was starting to think I wouldn't see anything on this excursion, when I heard the sound of something snapping a twig out on the path I had come from.

I slowly reached for my shotgun, bracing it against my shoulder and staring down the dark path in the distance. There was already a shell in the chamber, so I didn't need to give myself away by racking the slide. I almost smiled as I thought about the thing being blown to pieces by a well placed slug. That smiled vanished when I saw the white beam of light come shining up the pass. Instinctively, I tossed the shotgun into a pile of leaves behind me and covered it.

“Hey, what the hell are you doing out here?” came the inquisitive voice of a silhouette behind a beam of light.

“Just doing a little camping, who are you?” I shot back.

The figure lowered the light and I could make out the sheriff's uniform. He was a large man, the tan uniform crisp and clean against his bulky frame.

“Marcus Hadley, sheriff's department. No one is supposed to be in these woods, it's dangerous,” he said.

You don't know the half of it, I thought.

“Sorry, I didn't know,” I muttered.

The man paused and lifted the light again for a second before lowering it.

“Hey, I know you. You're Mason. I took your report after the bear attack yesterday. Why the hell would you want to come back here?”

“It wasn't a fucking bear attack!” I shouted before I could catch myself.

“Listen, I know you're upset, Mason, but you shouldn't be out here. Your friends wouldn't want you to get hurt,” he said in a sympathetic voice as he walked towards me and took a seat on one of the logs next to the meager fire. “You kids spent a lot of time out here, I'm guessing?”

“We had been coming up here for over a decade,” I said, unable to keep the anger from my voice as I ruminated on how useless the police had been when they ignored my account of events and wrote me off as crazy.

“Ten years is a long time. I'm sorry, kid, that's got to be pretty hard to go through.”

“It wouldn't have been as hard if all of you had done your damn jobs instead of trying to make me feel like a lunatic,” I spat at him.

“It was a bear kid. It's horrible, but it was just-”

“I know what I saw, damn it! I was there! I heard them! Whatever that thing was, it's still out here!” I shouted.

“Then why the hell are you out here, Mason?” he said coldly.

In answer, I brushed the leaves off the shotgun and stood up, not wanting to grab a shotgun in front of a cop. I took a step back and pointed to where it was laying on the ground.

“That's why I'm out here. To do your job for you.”

He flashed the flashlight over to the gun and stood up.

“You have a gun? Mason, this isn't smart. What if you shot some innocent person out here. You said it yourself, that thing sounds like people, right? Sounds like you could make a mistake pretty easily even if you were right. You know this isn't legal. I can smell the weed on you from here. Being in possession of a weapon while under the influence isn't a light crime either.”

I couldn't meet his gaze, choosing instead to direct my angry frown at the ground. He was right about too much of it. He was right that it was stupid to get high and run around with a gun. He was right that I could easily hurt someone by shooting at human voices in the dark. He was definitely right that none of this was smart. I sighed heavily and sat back down, feeling tears of frustration welling up in my eyes.

“Come on, son, let's get out of here. I'm not going to arrest you, I know you're going through a hard time. Let's just get you out of these woods and back to your car. I'll carry the gun and give it back after we get you to your vehicle.”

I wanted to refuse, to argue with him and try to stay out here, but I knew he was being logical where I wasn't. Besides, I liked sheriff Hadley. I remembered the way he had put his arm over my shoulders when I told him what had happened that night. So, I just sighed and stood back up.

I was about to say okay when I heard it, the sound that made up the lattice-work supporting my nightmares. The whole forest echoed with birdsong. The sheriff looked spooked as he shined his light around the trees, but I felt adrenaline surge through me and went for my shotgun.

“Mason, drop it!” I heard Hadley shout over the din.

“Damn it, you don't understand! That's them! There here!” I screamed, still bent over with my hands on the gun.

I didn't hear him draw the pistol, but I could feel the handgun pointed at my back. I was frozen like that, not wanting to get shot but not wanting to release my only means of self defense.

“Mason, you pick up that gun and I don't care what happened to you, I'm going to open fire. Now put your hands above your head and step away from the weapon.”

“Damn it... damn it!” I grunted through my gritted teeth before finally raising my hands slowly and taking a step back.

The birdsong was dying down now, the woods growing silent again.

“You don't understand, it's here! Right now! We can kill it, just trust me!” I yelled out, hearing how insane I sounded even to myself.

I turned and looked at Hadley who was already walking towards me with a pair of handcuffs in his free hand, the other pointing a sidearm at my chest.

That's when we both froze, hearing it.

“It's a mockingbird!” Jessie's voice called out from somewhere in the shadows.

“What the hell...” said Hadley, still pointing the weapon at me but glancing around.

“Sheriff, you need to trust me. We're both going to die out here if you don't. Just trust me...” I said, slowly dropping my arms to my side.

Hadley looked unsure, still keeping the gun pointed at my chest. I felt bad for him. I never had intended for someone else to be out here with me when I did this. I was pretty sure this was an elaborate suicide attempt on my part, but I didn't want Hadley to be in danger. Again, I liked the man, and knowing he was actively in harm's way because he had followed me out here filled me with guilt.

“Sheriff,” I said after a moment's silence had passed between us. “You should go. You don't need to be out here. It's dangerous, like you said. You should just walk away right now.”

This seemed to have the opposite of my intended effect as he looked back towards me and resumed his brisk stride to where I stood.

“Hands behind your back, Mason. No more ghost stories, okay?”

Just then, we heard a voice coming from the trail leading up the ridge where I had fallen off last night.

“What the hell are you doing out here?” came the sheriff's voice yards away from where he stood.

The sheriff spun and pointed the pistol in the direction the voice had come from.

“Who is that!?” he shouted, his voice tinged with fear.

“Marcus Hadley, sheriff's department. Put your hands above your head and step away from the weapon!”

The sheriff glanced back at me nervously and I couldn't help but shrug my shoulders and give him a “told you so” look.

“This isn't funny, come out where I can see you!” Hadley yelled out in the darkness.

“Sounds exhausting,” came Maddie's voice behind us from the opposite trail now, prompting Hadley to spin around and point his gun that way.

“Sheriff, let me get my gun,” I said as calmly as I could, unable to keep my voice from shaking with fear.

For a moment, I thought he'd ignore me, but instead, he jerked his chin in the direction of the gun.

“Okay kid, maybe you were right, or maybe I'm going crazy right now, but I'd feel better knowing I there's more one gun on our side.”

“I'll be back as fast as I can with help!” came Mark's voice from our left.

“I get my taste from dad,” I heard Rachel's voice call out from our right.

“Where's it coming from, can you tell?” hissed Hadley as he turned back and forth with his gun pointed outwards.

“It was like this last time. It can be hard to tell where their coming from. It's like they're ventriloquists or something,” I told him.

Just then, something big dropped from the trees above us and hit my chest with enough force to send me sprawling in the leaves. I dropped my gun as I toppled over, scrambling to get back to my feet. I looked up just in time to see Hadley bathe the thing in light and got a glimpse at the thing that killed my friends before it evaporated into the shadows again.

It was big, taller than a man by a full head. It was a shimmering collection of dark colored feathers stretched over steely muscles. It was a blur as it ran back into the shadows, only to reappear from another angle and come charging towards where Hadley and I were standing. It sprinted forward and slashed a talon across the sheriff's chest, eliciting a groan from him as he fell to the ground and rolled away.

“Don't worry, Mason!” I heard it say in Mark's voice, twisting towards me with its head lowered and beady eyes narrowed.

The air was suddenly split with three loud pops and the thing scurried into the darkness among the trees. It was Hadley, shooting his gun as he lay on the ground. I ran up to him, seeing the crimson stain spreading across his once clean uniform. Even through the shredded fabric, I could make out the ragged tears in the meat of his chest. He groaned in pain as I crouched next to him.

“How bad is it...?” he asked breathlessly.

“You'll be fine, it'll look bad ass when it scars over,” I said, resorting to making jokes like I did every time things went to shit.

I pulled off my jacket and pressed it down hard on his wound, causing him to cry out.

“Can you walk?” I asked him.

“Yea, I think I can if you help me a little,” he said, his voice tense and betraying his pain.

“Okay, we're walking out of here. Come on up,” I told him, pulling his arm over my shoulders and standing him up.

He grunted in pain as I jerked him to his feet, and I was pretty sure I caught a glimpse of one of his rib bones shining white through the red flesh. Still, Hadley was tougher than most of the men I've met. He held up his service pistol as I began helping him towards the way out of the woods. We had almost made it out of the clearing when we started hearing whispers in the woods. They seemed to come from everywhere, growing in intensity, until the thing dropped from the trees to block our retreat.

“You must have been stoned!” it said in a perfect rendition of Jessie's voice as it charged towards us.

Before Hadley could shoot at it, it headbutted him in the chest and sent both of us to the ground, knocking Hadley away from me as we fell. Before either of us could recover, it cocked its head like a bird and suddenly snapped its jaws on the sheriffs leg. I could hear the crunch of bone echo through the forest, like a dry twig snapping under a heel. That's when the trees filled with birdsong again.

I could see Hadley open his mouth in what was clearly a scream of agony, but no sound came. Only the birdsong could be heard.

The thing released the man's leg and jerked its head back to look at me with those hollow eyes, almost as if to say “I haven't forgotten about you.”

“It's a mocking bird!” it said in Jessie's voice again as it dug its talons into the earth and began to advance in my direction.

I heard the report of the sheriff's gun and the thing seemed to flinch, then turned its attention back to the man on the ground. I couldn't see past the bulk of the creature, but I heard Hadley fire three more times. The birdsong was so loud now that the gunshots were the only thing I could hear over it.

I felt fear flood into my body and spun around, running for the trail that led up the ridge. I felt like a coward, leaving Hadley there on the ground to die, but I I couldn't stop myself from scrambling away in desperate terror. The birdsong stopped as I was halfway through the clearing and I could hear the beast shifting its weight in my direction. I kept running even as I heard it bounding through the dry carpet of dead leaves, getting closer and closer.

“I'm coming back!” it yelled out in my voice.

I made it to the trail and sprinted hard until I came to the spot I where I had fallen off the ridge the night before. The thing was certainly faster than me, but I was more agile, able to turn the corners of the twisting trail faster than it could. It was a gamble, but I crouched inside the bushes where I heard Jessie's voice on that fateful night. Even in the dark, I could make out the long drop to the river bank below me. I heard the thing go rushing past my hiding spot, holding my breath while it did.

“You shouldn't be out here, Mason,” it said in Hadley's voice as it thundered past.

I crept out and started making my way back to the clearing. Maybe the sheriff was still alive and we could still escape this nightmare. I wanted to save him, but I also knew he was my witness, the only one that could confirm that I wasn't crazy. With his help, I could get the whole national guard out here. We could bring an army to this place to kill that thing.

I got to the clearing and could see my little campfire still weakly flickering in the empty space, casting ghostly shadows among the trees. By its light, I could make out Hadley laying on his side, his leg was a mass of pulped gore and blood. He wasn't moving, but I had to be sure. I sprinted to his side and turned him onto his back.

He let out a long groan of agony as I did so, making me smile when I knew there was still a chance to save him.

“Get the fuck out of here, Mason...” he mumbled.

“There's no time to argue, we got to move!” I said, trying to pull him up by his arm, making him shout as I his ruined leg shifted beneath him.

“I'm not going anywhere. I can't move, you dumb kid! Either we can both die out here or you can get away.”

I went quiet, feeling despair fall over me like a bucket of ice water. This thing was going to take someone else from me and I felt powerless to stop it.

“Listen, Mason, you have to get to my truck,” Hadley said, forcing the words out through his clenched teeth as he pulled a set of keys from his pocket. “There's a can of gasoline in the back. I want you to burn this fucking place to the ground. You understand me? Burn it!”

I clenched the keys, wanting to take a moment to thank him for the sacrifice he was making, but knowing there was no time. I stood up, backing away, then turned to run, only to see the thing dropping back out of the trees.

“It's a mockingbird!” it shouted in Jessie's voice.

I turned to run, but it was already moving past me, smacking me hard in the chest with one of its wings. I landed on my back, immediately scrambling away from the creature as it bore down on me. With avian speed, it crouched down in preparation to strike, but I heard Hadley's gun split the night air once again, causing the thing to round on him in fury.

“It was like this last time,” it said in my voice before shooting forward.

I have no doubt that Hadley tried to scream, but the birdsong filled the woods again, and if he did scream, it drowned it out. As it quieted back down, I heard a sickeningly wet crunch coming from where the thing was crouched over Hadley's form, his legs jerking uselessly as the monster's head bobbed up and down over him.

I was still kicking out with my legs, pushing my body backwards and away from it, when it turned towards me, cocking its head in that same bird-like fashion.

“I'll be back with help!” it called in Mark's voice as it slowly stalked towards me. I felt my hand brush something cool to the touch and stopped moving as it loomed above me.

“It's a mockingbird,” it said in Jessie's voice.

“Fuck you!” I spat back at it.

“I'm coming back...” it said in my voice as it started leaning in towards me.

“That's right... I told you I was coming back, you fuck! You remember me?!” I screamed in anger accented with terror.

It opened its jaw, preparing to strike. I swung up the shotgun in the same moment and shoved the barrel into its waiting maw, feeling it smack hard against the roof of its mouth.

“It's a mocking-” it started to say, only to be cut off by a thunderous blast that removed the entire top part of its head.

Feathers and viscera flew into the air becoming gory confetti, and blood splattered across my face as the lifeless mass of dead meat slumped forwards and fell next to me. I stood up, my heart still pounding in my chest as I fired into it again and again. Two craters appeared in its back, but it didn't react. I stood there, hearing my ragged breath and a ringing in my ears, as I stared at the monster that had taken my friends from me.

Finally, I let the shotgun drop to my side and turned towards Hadley. He was already gone, a bloody hole torn into his throat and chest. At least I knew the thing that had ended him was done for too.

I carried out the sheriff's wishes, dousing the clearing with gas after retrireving the can from his car. I spotted something in the beam of the flashlight as I continued to pour the gasoline. It was a small chunk of wood with three “M”s carved in it. I thought it had rotted to nothing, but there it was. I bent down and picked it up, using the sheriff's keys to carve a fourth M into it. After all, Marcus Hadley was one of us now. It wasn't much of a memorial, but it was the greatest honor I could bestow upon the man.

I kept pouring the gasoline on different trees as I walked back down the trail, over the stones that we had used to cross the river countless times. I stood back as I emptied the last of the fuel onto the tree Mark's body was found in and pulled a joint from my shirt pocket. I lit it and inhaled deeply, closing my eyes for a moment and winging a prayer of thanks up to God for helping me survive this night.

We had lit so many bonfires in these woods over the ten years we had been coming to them. I thought it fitting that I'd be lighting the biggest one yet to send it off. I clenched the joint in my mouth and knelt down, sparking my lighter on the gas soaked wood of the tree. Smoky the bear was going to be pretty pissed at me, but I figured it was his fault for letting that monster be his roommate.

I got back in my car and watched as the fire consumed those woods, the sky glowing orange in the night. I worried the police would arrest me for it, but I don't think it will happen. Apparently, no one was aware I had come up there that night. Sheriff Hadley's patrol vehicle was found in the field where I had left it, and the police surmised that he started the fire, for whatever reason. I visited the empty grave they made for him, leaving the piece of wood with the four “M”s carved into it leaning against the tombstone. I wish I could tell everyone of his bravery as he helped me face down the monster in the woods, but I know no one would believe me. At least I can tell his story here, for what it's worth.

I've decided I can put this all behind me now and begin to heal. My friends may still be dead, but at least I know the thing that killed them is dead too. It's a hollow victory, but its better than nothing. I finally feel like life is an option now that this is all over. At least, I was hoping it was.

I was half asleep when I got home and took a nap before posting this. That's when I heard a sound from outside my window. I can't be sure, but I swear it sounded like Jessie. It sounded like she was sayings “It's a mockingbird.”
