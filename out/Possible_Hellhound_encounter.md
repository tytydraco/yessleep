Well this is my first time posting on Reddit I don't much care for the karma or whatever it is I just want to share my story of something that happened.


I was walking down the road stopped at a game stop to get a Gift card to add funds to my account after that I  decided to go get some smokes and a couple shooters to get me on the way (it was cold and fireball whiskey sure warms me up) 

I down the first double of fireball nice and buzzed I went on my path home, I didn't bring my car because I like to walk been doing it since I was 14 now 22

I walk down this sidewalk I say it was around six it was getting dark because it was November in Colorado. 

I was minding my own business happily buzzed smoking a cigarette then I see this big  black dog turning the corner at the end of the side walk.

I froze I felt like I had been doused in cold water. Mind you this very same year I got bit by a pitbull on a errand to get some Gatorade for my Friend he was severely hungover ect so I didn't really fear dogs but was weary of them..but this damn thing sent chills all over my body this overwhelming urge to just run away crept over me 

Something about the way it strared straight at me  through me .. 
I right away cut through a plaza that was on my right through the shops just scared I didn't run because that sends dogs running but I walked as fast and far as I could till I reached the end near a bank  the whole time this feeling of being watched like turning off the lights and running up the stairs in fear of dark .

I'm usually not superstitious, but at that moment I swear I had just ran into a damn Hellhound .

The first thing I remembered was Mysterious 5s videos on hellhounds and that dog matched everything.
 

From the piercing eyes ,to the damn size the raggedy black fur...this thing scared the living daylights out of me I still play that scenario in my head even after the buzz 

Mind you where I was it wasn't a bad area it was pretty well kept as it was a banking/food area so they should have not been stray dogs ..

The thing that gets me is that dog was gone when I looked at the area I had first seen it no possible owner or coller. Even thinking about it gives me chills 

I always thought it could have been a omen , probably I'm just to reaching at straws but I heard if you see a hellhound it's basically impeding doom if you run into it Three times.

I have had my share of close calls living the way I have , but I never felt such fear as I did walking the rest of the way home .It sounds cliche but I see that dog turning that corner every time I close my eyes .
