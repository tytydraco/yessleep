There’s hammering at the door. He’s screaming again.

"Rachel. RACHEL!"

I’m on the cold tiles, clutching the kitchen knife tighter with each bang. I know he’ll get in eventually. I know he will and that’ll be that. So I lie here. The only place left to go is memory.

Every day I have to remember more and more.

It was our first Christmas together. We’d been shopping in town. We'd just bought this place.

*“You can have anything you want.”*

I’d said, *“Anything?”*

*“Within reason.”*

I asked for perfume. He insisted he knew the one I’d like. I’d never worn it before in my life.

It smelt like vinegar and wine - acidic, dark, someone else. But beginnings are a time for change and it felt like love. Love that rearranges you. My hair the way he liked it. The clothes he picked. Everything I was in relation to him. Nothing else allowed in. Not work. Not children. Just him.

Then, gradually, things fall away.  Erode. Rough edges sharpen to points.  You realise that it's easier to love an idea than a person and you’re angry, but you're not angry with him, why doesn't he understand that, you're angry at the fact that you're back where you were and everything’s the same. Everything except you. Older. Bent to shape around him.

“RACHEL,” he shouts again.

One night though, the first splinter, the first crack. I wanted to go out, just to walk, eat, exist outside this place.

*“What’s out there we don’t have here?” he asked.*

When I tried to leave, he grabbed my arm.

*“No.”*

That was it. One ‘no’ and we both knew.

Then last week I found the statement.

An account I didn’t know - money to *her*. Eight years together. Money away from us, money to *her*.

Since then, there have been presents. Cooking.

“RACHEL!”

He didn’t talk about her. Of course he didn’t. Talking would solidify. Talking would leave too many shards in the memory for later casual denial.

Angrier, angrier all the time, I went looking. I didn’t want to find it but knew I would.

A box. Tucked away. Recently moved.

Photos. Toys. Letters.

Letters from her, desperate. Letters begging him not to hurt himself. Others *accusing him of things*. Of *what he might have done*.

I stared at her face in the pictures.

And then I *saw it*.

I saw what he was turning me into.

The same clothes. The same hair.

The same look in the eyes.

I tied my hair like hers. Sprayed that birthday perfume - untouched for months, and surely hers. I walked down the stairs, each step taking too long as I tried to block out the visions of what was about to come. I told him I was leaving.

He screamed:

*“Not again. Not again!”*

And he threw the boiling pan at me.

Skin stripped from my leg as I ran.

And now I’m here. Knife in hand. Door trembling at his fists.

He’s still screaming it. Over and over.

*“Rachel! RACHEL!”*

Rachel’s not even my name.

I suppose it must have been hers.
