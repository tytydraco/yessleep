**My name is Jack and this is a story about… my friend Ryan — and a game he found.**

I’m sixteen, as is he — was he.

We met in high school. I remember bracing for yet another year of unbelonging. Sitting down in the cafeteria, playing with fibrous chicken nuggets and a slurry they called creamed spinach. My mind was lost, wandering. As if my life were a rom-com, I decided to look up for whatever reason and spotted him across the room.

He was buried in his food, like me — lost and thoughtful, or at least trying to distract himself. Blend in with the crowd? Perhaps just attempting to remain unseen. Better to be a nobody than a somebody, right? I think we both knew we were outsiders when we saw each other.

Anyway, I wandered over to him and introduced myself. And there you have it — I made a friend. Sounds almost like the start of a beautiful romance.

Just kidding.

I wouldn’t call us nerds or dorks… well, maybe I’d call him one. We were both weird. Quiet. I don’t actually know if those words suit us, but I know that’s what we were to everyone else. What can you do?

But the one thing Ryan and I connected on — literally — was video games. We both played on PC, and we were both into the same things. I’m what you might call a “casual gamer.” The usual first-person shooters, sure. I think the only thing separating me from someone who spends their days playing Bejeweled is play time. Especially compared to Ryan.

He played everything I did, but also… much more. RPGs, simulators, strategy games — you name it. Whereas I had hundreds of hours, he had thousands. There was always a point in our conversations when it was clear he had passed me.

Something Ryan was really into, though, was indie games.

There’s no shortage of indie games, especially on PC. There are plenty of websites that host them and allow you to download them for free. But Ryan really went digging. I’m pretty sure he didn’t dabble on the deep web, but sometimes, when we talked about his newest discoveries, I genuinely wondered where the hell some of these games came from.

Something he was a big fan of were those stupid, cheesy indie horror games. You know the kind — cheap jumpscares, crappy graphics. Parodies, really. Turning SpongeBob or The Simpsons into horror games of some kind. They made me laugh most of the time. And if they didn’t, Ryan and I would spend our time laughing at how bad they were.

One day after school, Ryan texted me about a game he found.

“Hey man, I just found this new game. It’s the strangest game I’ve found yet. You’ve got to swing by and check it out.”

And so I did.

I made my way to his house. His mother let me in, and I walked into his bedroom, where he was seated at his battlestation — or what he could call one, given everything.

“Oh, hey Jack, dude, you’ve got to look at this.”

He waved me over with one raised hand, his eyes and body never turning away from the screen.

“It’s called ‘CorridorInfinity.’”

“CorridorInfinity? Sounds like a game that got translated poorly,” I said.

I sat down beside him. He was paused, waiting for me to get situated.

“So… what do you do in this game? And what’s so weird about it?” I asked.

“Well, you’re in this long, infinite hallway… corridor, I guess. And… here, let me show you.”

He unpaused the game. It took place from a first-person perspective. We were looking down a dark, dimly lit hallway. There was nothing else to it, really. At the end of the hallway was a fairly bright but small light. Behind us was an abyss of darkness.

Ryan held down the “W” key and moved forward toward the light.

“Here’s the wicked part,” he said.

As we moved, we both started to hear a strange, throaty wheezing. It grew louder as we went forward. Ryan moved the mouse, turning us around.

From the darkness, we saw a figure.

The figure had pale skin, nearly bleached — almost white. He was long and gangly, and not just in height. Its proportions were all wrong. Limbs stretched too far down. Fingers equally long, though some stretched longer than others. An incredibly long neck — not ridiculously so, surely plausible and possible to encounter in reality, but unsettling nonetheless.

But the worst part was the figure’s face.

Wide, open eyes.  
And below that, a wide, agape mouth twisted into a horrifying grin.

The game was pixelated for the most part, but the part that wasn’t was the figure. It was almost depicted with photorealism, particularly the facial features. The eyes bore an intensity of malice and oppression. Its smile… unreal. It stretched too far into the corners of its cheeks, its mouth too full of teeth.

Observing this figure, I began shaking. I felt an immense wave of dread and horror. When I looked at Ryan, I saw that he was shivering too — except he handled it with joy and anticipation.

“Pretty cool, huh?” he said with an excited smile. “I don’t think I’ve ever played a game that made me *feel*. Like… actually feel.”

He turned us forward again and began walking down the hallway.

I assumed that thing was chasing us. As we moved through the corridor, the light at the end grew brighter. The whole time, the whole way, I felt like something was just inches from my back — like fingers were reaching out to grab me, just a hair’s length away.

After what felt like forever, we reached the end. As we were bathed in that light, it was suddenly cut off by a flamboyant and out-of-place “Congratulations!” sign, along with a button to go to the next stage. It was so shocking and so different from the rest of the experience that I almost reacted as though it were a jumpscare itself.

It wasn’t until I was knocked out of my dread that I realized I was sweating cold droplets. Ryan was too.

Just then, Ryan’s mother knocked on the door behind us.

“Boys? Jack? Are you still here? It’s dinner time. Don’t you need to head back home to your folks?”

What? How long had we been playing?

This game… I had never felt so disturbed. Never felt so horrified. I felt like I was being chased. Felt like I was being hunted… haunted. And time? Had we really been playing that long?

Ryan seemed to handle it like an adrenaline spike. He was having fun.

I took a breath, shaking my head and trying to regain myself.



I ended my night with Ryan and hurried home.

The walk home was frightening, to say the least. It was dark — not too dark, but dark enough. The entire walk, I felt as though I was being followed. Several times I looked behind me and saw nothing. Yet I felt the same way I did when we played that game, like something was reaching out for me, just out of reach.

At one point, I began running.

I burst into my house, slamming the front door behind me. My mom and dad rushed over — my mom with concern, my dad with anger.

“What the hell are you doing slamming the door at 7:30? And what were you doing out this late?” my father yelled.

My mother put an arm around him, trying to calm him down.

I apologized and explained that I was hanging out with Ryan and that we lost track of time.

Soon after, I ate dinner and went to my room.

That night, I didn’t sleep well. As a matter of fact, I slept horribly. Nightmares. Terrible, awful dreams.

I dreamed I was in the corridor. I dreamed I faced that small but blinding light, like someone shining a laser pointer directly into my eye. I dreamed I walked toward it, as though I were being called. Then I heard the wheezing — that slightly guttural, wretched noise.

I didn’t need to turn around. I knew what it was. I knew what it looked like. I knew it was behind me.

I ran until I began wheezing myself. I started crying. My eyes filled with water and my chest burned. I was close — so close to the light — and then…

I woke up.

I woke up screaming. Not loud enough to wake anyone else, but a scream nonetheless.

The next morning was rough.

At school, Ryan looked… off. He looked different. He moved differently — rigid, static, like he was dragging himself. At first, he didn’t even notice me. He didn’t try to find me.

He looked rough. Black circles under his eyes. It looked like he hadn’t slept. And if he had, it looked worse than being awake.

When I finally pulled him aside, he looked at me with hollow eyes.

“Holy shit, Ryan, what the hell happened to you?” I said.

“I… I didn’t get any sleep, Jack. I kept playing.”

“Kept playing? For how long?”

“I don’t know. I didn’t stop until my mom came in. I was late to school.”

“Jesus…” I took a long sip from my water bottle, watching him.

He slouched onto the cafeteria bench.

“You stayed up playing *that* game?” I asked.

He nodded.

“It only gets closer, Jack…” he muttered.

“What?”

He went quiet after that and dumped his tray into the trash.

I didn’t see him for the rest of the day.

Later, I got a text from him. It was a mess — misspelled words, broken punctuation. But this is what he said:

“I don’t know how many times I walked into the light, Jack. But it just kept going. And it got closer and closer each time. It doesn’t ever go away. It doesn’t do anything, I don’t think — it just follows you. But Jack, I’ve been seeing it everywhere. It was in my dreams. I saw it in my dreams. And I see it outside my dreams too. I saw it in the cafeteria with you earlier today. It slowly moves toward me. It follows me. It smiles at me. That damn grin.

I think it wants me to keep playing, Jack. I’m going to keep playing.”

I stared at his message for a long time. I didn’t know what to think. I was chilled to my core.

I don’t know how long we played that game the other day, but I was on edge the entire time. I felt like I was about to be caught… taken… and that was just while I was there.

Ryan played all night and all morning.

He seemed to love that feeling, but…

I shook my head. That couldn’t be good.

The next day, Ryan looked even worse. His eyes were dry, wrinkled, and heavy. His lips were crusty. He looked like he had aged years and hadn’t showered. He looked… dead.

And he looked paranoid.

He kept jerking his head around, having little freak-outs where he looked left and right, even spinning around completely. Sometimes he just did it. Other times, his eyes went wide and he moved somewhere else.

We all noticed. Even the teachers.

At one point, he fell asleep at his desk and was sent to the nurse’s office.

Later, in our last class period, we heard it — loud, maniacal screaming.

We rushed into the hallway.

It was Ryan. He was on the floor, screaming and pointing at something we couldn’t see. He scooted backward like a dog trying to scratch itself, as fast as he could. He kept pointing hard at the far end of the hallway.

“Get it away! Get it away! What are you all staring at? Don’t you see it?! Stop it!”

We tried to help him. Several teachers tried to pull him up, to comfort him. He swatted them away and kicked at them.

Then he screamed louder than he had all day.

His eyes went wide. He was petrified. He screamed and screamed. His eyes strained — I will never forget that look.

His back arched and we heard a strange gurgling sound come from him.

Eyes wide. Mouth open. Back arched straight.

He stayed like that, gurgling at the ceiling, for what felt like five minutes while we all watched.

Then he collapsed.

His back straightened. His eyes closed.

He had passed out.

Several teachers carried him to the nurse’s station. Police and medical responders were called. He was wheeled out.

I didn’t hear from him or his parents after that.

I didn’t tell my parents what happened. I didn’t even really know what happened myself.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. Not because of dreams — but because I couldn’t get his face out of my head.

What did he see?



When the next day came, I was shocked to see Ryan back at school.

His parents called it an anxiety attack. The school agreed. We all acted strange around him. Pretending everything was normal felt wrong.

I tried to talk to him, but he didn’t notice me. I figured he needed time.

During class, we were taking a quiz. I sat in the back. Ryan sat near the front.

It was math. I was failing it. I skipped questions and scratched my nose with my pen.

Exhausted, I looked up.

I wish I hadn’t.

Ryan had turned around in his chair.

Facing me.

Grinning.

Goddamn grinning.

But it wasn’t him. It couldn’t be. His eyes were too wide. His mouth was stretched too far. He stared at me with a big, goofy smile.

But there was nothing funny about it.

In his eyes was malice. Like something else was inside him.

This wasn’t Ryan. This wasn’t my friend.

Why wasn’t the teacher yelling at him? Why didn’t anyone else notice?

He wouldn’t stop looking at me.

I put my head down and kept working.

It was a very long class period.

After that, I avoided Ryan. I didn’t look for him. I didn’t look at him.

A few days passed.

Then he disappeared.

His parents were devastated. Mine were worried. The police got involved. His mother found his bedroom empty and the window open.

I didn’t know what to feel.

The school felt quieter.

Weeks later, my mom came into my room.

“Sweetie? Ryan’s mother came by earlier. She found this in a locked drawer in his desk. It’s addressed to you.”

She handed me a small folded piece of paper and left.

I stared at it.

It had my name on it.

After a while, I unfolded it. It had been folded many times.

“Delete the game. Log into my account and delete it. It’s coming. It’s no longer just in my dreams. It’s no longer willing to stand there and watch me. It’s coming. Delete the game.”

It was written on school assignment paper. Dated the day before Ryan lost his mind in the hallway.

I logged onto my computer and typed in his login info.

There it was.

“CorridorInfinity.”

I hovered my cursor over it.

Delete the game, he said.

But he was gone.

It was too late.

Deleting it wouldn’t change anything.

But what did he see? What did Ryan see?

I swallowed hard, remembering how uneasy I had felt that day.

I double-clicked the application.

It launched immediately.

I loaded into the hallway.

Dark. Long.

Everything looked the same. Ryan had played for hours, yet nothing had changed.

Reluctantly, I walked forward.

The noise began.

But it was louder this time.

Right in my ear.

And then I realized…

The sound wasn’t coming from the game.
