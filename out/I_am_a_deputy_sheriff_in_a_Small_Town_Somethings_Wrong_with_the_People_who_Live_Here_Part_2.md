I was a little creeped out by the incident that happened yesterday, but it just ended up being one of those things that I ended up dismissing due to my tired mind or my neighbors just staring at the same thing I was thinking it was as weird as I did.

A few days have passed since the incident, and we have had our little fare shares of people getting into drunken fights or the simple neighbors calling on each other because one did not like what the other had said simple stuff really nothing you wouldn't find in a normal small town like this.

It wasn't until that Friday when things really started to get weird again, I was just getting settled in at this point having been here for a little over a week now when my house started to smell like sweets from the brownies that sweet old woman Barbra had given me.

I honestly had forgot about them sitting on the mantel by the front door, and it wasn’t like I was planning on eating them anyway, so I just dumped them in the trash bin and washed her plastic container out and began the walk to her house to return the bowl.

I rang the doorbell, and waited for what felt like 10 minutes, before turning around and heading back down the old wooden stairs of the old woman's front porch. The sound of the door opening coming from behind me, caught me off guard and Barbra's perky voice greeted me:

“Oh hello, dearie. I’m so sorry for keeping you waiting, I had dinner on the stove, and I am an old lady after all it does take me a while to reach the door.”

“It’s alright ma’am. I just wanted to give you back the brownie container. Thank you for the brownies, by the way.” – I held out my hand with a smile.

She took it and inspected it with a smile, before looking back at me.

“You ate them all, I hope?” – she asked.

“Uh, yeah. All gone. Sweets are kind of my weak spot” – I nervously chuckled.

She stared at me with her unyielding smile for an awkwardly long moment before clearing her throat and beginning to speak again.

“Well, alright then Would you like to come in for a cup of coffee or tea? I also have made some extra food for dinner if you have not already eaten of course”

“I’d love to, but I have some important work to do. Thank you, though.” – I smiled back.

“You be sure to stop by anytime, dear. My husband Troy would love to meet you.” – Barbra said.

I waved to her and as I turned around, I stopped in my tracks.

“Hey, Barbra?” – I turned back towards her.

She already closed her door halfway.

“Yes?” – she asked.

“What’s that big red blinking light over there?” – I pointed over towards the hill.

“To be honest, I don’t think anyone knows, dear.”

“Has it been here long?”

“Well, I’ve been living here for over 30 years and the old military base has been closed for at least 15 of that 30 but whatever that red light is attached to it was only built around 4 months ago. At first everyone thought the town was getting some military service again.”

“But that wasn’t the case?”

Barbra shrugged:

“On the day they started working on the site, multiple SUVs kept driving in and out of the hills where the thing was being built, but we never got to see if they were military or if they were some kind of company employed by the town, nor did we try to stop and ask them. They were in such a hurry, we honestly did not want to be a bother they didn’t look friendly in the slightest either so there's that too. I wanted to offer them some brownies at first, but then changed my mind. The next day they were gone, and the thing was fully built"

I scratched my chin before replying “And have you ever noticed anything weird coming from the hills when that light stops blinking?"

“No, I don’t think so, dear. In fact, I don’t think the thing up there serves any purpose at all. It may have been abandoned, which is understandable. Setting up the thing whatever it is all the way back there on the tallest hill in town… it’s just not practical and it's not close to anything.”

“Interesting well, I really should get going. Thank you, for the information ma’am I mean Barbra.” – I nodded and finally left.

A few more days of boring patrols went by, and I started to get adjusted to my new environment. I’d see Scott, Sarah, Barbra and some other neighbors outside on a daily basis and would sometimes even run into them downtown.

Then on a Thursday night, Scott knocked on my door.

“Hey there Alex, how’s your night going? Hope I’m not interrupting anything.” – he grinned with his usual perky smile.

He always wore similar clothes every time I seen him, and I really started to wonder if he was the type of guy to have a closet full of same outfits that he would just change daily pr was the type that never did laundry.

“No, not at all. Wanna come in?” – I asked.

“No, it’s fine. I got to get back to the house, Sarah’s making a cake and she’ll be angry if I’m not there in time to try it. Anyways listen, the neighbors usually organize this cook out nights on Fridays. It’s a really good way to unwind and you know, get to bond a little bit. So, we figured we’d have you join us tomorrow, what do you say, bud?”

“I don’t know Scott, I have this thing tomorrow that I-“

“Oh come on! It’ll be fun!” – he threw his hands up in the air and smiled even wider.

He then leaned in and whispered:

“And you know, between us, I think you might have some neighbors that have taken a liking to you. But you didn’t hear it from me.” – he said that last sentence in a normal tone and then waited for my response with a smile.

“I mean, I guess I could join for a little bit. But I really can’t stay for too lo-“

“That’s my guy!” – Scott said, stepping backwards to his house – “Come over to my place tomorrow 8 pm, bud.”

“Wait, should I bring anything?” – I shouted after him.

“No need! You’re the guest of honor, Alex!” – and with that last sentence he went back inside.

How the hell did I get into this mess? I guess I’ll just bite the bullet and stay there tomorrow for an hour and then make an excuse that I need to go.

Friday night came much faster than I thought, and I dreaded socializing with a bunch of people I didn’t know, but just like with moving here, I tried to make the best of it. I jumped into my casual clothes at 7:50 pm and practically fell out the front door as I stumbled across the road to Scott's front door, I heard perky voices coming from the inside, as I got closer which multiplied my anxiety. I rang the doorbell and heard Scott's voice say something like ‘let me just get that’ among the rest of the voices that filled the house.

The door opened a few seconds later and Scott stood there, same clothes and all.

“Heeeeey, look who’s here! Come on in, come on!” – he stepped aside, and I went in.

I heard unanimous voices greeting me way more enthusiastically than I’d like, and I tried to return that enthusiasm at least slightly. Some of the people who I knew were there, including Barbra and Scott's wife and kids. Another married couple, Dan and Emma were there with their own kids, so the children were playing with each other, while the adults sat around the table and talked.

As soon as I entered the room, Sarah showed me to my seat and offered me something to drink. I thanked her and joined in on the conversation.

“We had just decided that we’re going to tell scary stories around the fire in the backyard tonight, is that okay with you, Alex?” – Scott asked.

“Yeah, I’m fine with that. But you’ll have to take an easy on me I'm a bit of a scaredy cat.” – I nervously chuckled as I walked through the rest of the house.

Pretty soon we started gathering around the fire in Scott's backyard and despite my initial fear, I was having fun. Barbra sat next to me, so she gave me tips whenever it was my turn to tell a story. Scott was eliminated from telling story's early on because he got himself all worked up and scared, but he was as enthusiastic as ever, giving tips to other story tellers.

There was a moment of commotion with everyone shouting advice to Emma. I glanced to my right at Barbra, who seemed to be observing the situation with a smile on her face. I looked down and started fidgeting with my hands as my anxiety was starting to act up again.

Halfway through me awkwardly playing with my fingers, the entire backyard suddenly went dead silent, just like that. I’m not talking like people stopped shouting and waited in anticipation, children playing in background, etc. I mean so quiet that you could hear the crickets in the night and the roar of the fire as it sizzled on.

Instinctively, I looked up and my blood froze. Everyone was staring directly at me. I turned my head to my right very slowly, hearing the collar of my shirt brushing against my neck in the process, that’s how quiet it was. Barbra was staring at me wide-eyed, merely inches away from my face. Even the children were frozen in place and were facing me with their menacing gazes.

I held my breath and became painfully aware of how loud any movement I made was in that medium sized backyard.

I had to get out of here I braced myself to run if necessary and without a second thought I ever so slowly, pushed myself up out of the chair I was sitting in and ran for the fence gate door which had now been swinging open from not being properly latched earlier in the night.

I did not stop running until I was back across the road and safely on the porch of my own home. I took one look back at Scott's house just in time to see the solid red light switch back to blinking.

However, as it did voices filled the street in front of Scott's house, it was all the neighbors who had been in the backyard, "Thanks for having us, guys!" they all yelled back one by one.

It was like as if nothing had happened and everything was normal again, I just couldn't believe it what the hell was going on.

I wish I could say that this is the weirdest thing that happened to me since, but I would soon realize this was just the begging.
