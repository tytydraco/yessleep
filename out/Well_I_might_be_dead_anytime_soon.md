Our house burned down last month. The flames savaged the haze around it, and the devil in it took away my brother. I could see his body hitching, and twisting, and his screams... portrayed the sound of hell in my mind, just cruel and painful.



For a fortnight, we roamed the streets, looking for a cheap abode to save ourselves. It was hard. We moved to hotels and begged people to let us stay for at least a week.



If it were my dad and my mom who would be begging to do the same, would probably get a kick on their chest. But it was for me, the like of a helpless child that struck their conscience at once. I didn't feel horrible about it either.



We eventually got it. A robust roof, under our budget. At last, the deal came to an end. 



It was strange enough to live in a gothic house, on a quiet outskirts of the town. But there were a handful of families, that comforted us. 



The house was a medieval little house with a tiny little garden on its right. The daisies were a delight, and the soft bed of grass made me feel like running with bare feet on it for hours. Apart from that, there were two bedrooms, one for my parents and one for myself, where my mom kept two beds. One is a memoir of my brother. The overall place was quite ancient and mildly fancy.





......



Our first mistake was to explore the storehouse. It wasn't a "mistake" because exploration is a barrier between the non-living and the living.



What we found were a bunch of scraps. Worn out trousers, a lamp, and some coins. 

Almost mysteriously, we were greeted with a melancholy painting. 

It was a surreal depiction of a man whose chest had been pierced by huge deer antlers.

Damn! That wasn't very good. But we liked it anyway and hung it on the stone wall of the living room. Looked scrumptious enough, but kind of occult.



.......





The night that held me and my mom close with fright wasn't amiable. Our dad wasn't home, in the middle of a sultry, rainy night. 

We decided to call it a day and went off to sleep, we hoped that Dad would arrive anytime soon.

He didn't. 

A man came running into the prospect the next morning. Held my mom's hand and took her into a chariot and rode. I stumbled into it somehow.

There he was, bloody and lifeless. His car sprawled away at a distance, completely shattered. 

But it was the branch, the branch that struck me. His chest was ripped apart by a branch, that pierced through him, like a misericorde.



......



We lived at my grandparent's house. The days became dull and unhealthy.

We lived, we slept, we ate and we worked. But it felt like something was carved out of us.



Then came that postman, with a huge painting.

"Ah! I fancied the fair price of this pristine painting will be equally breathtaking, this belongs to you, madam." Saying this he, handed that painting to my mom, which was handed over to her by the new owner.



Now it was a fiery painting of a devil piercing a trident through the hearts of a woman and a fair boy.

It was it.

.....

I won't live long.
