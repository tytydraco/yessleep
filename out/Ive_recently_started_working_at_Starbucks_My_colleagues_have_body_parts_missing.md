I called it The Starbucks Smile.

You know when you walk into a Starbucks, and the underpaid college kid making your frappe gives you a dead eyed smile?

Yeah. That exact one you’re thinking of

It’s the smile of no sleep, relationship and friend troubles, hunger, an assignment due. Parental troubles. Yeah. The one which sets off alarm bells, because you start to wonder if they are okay. 

The moment my manager started talking about “dorm arrangements” at my new job, I got that exact same noise in my head. The Kill Bill sirens—but more aggressive. Like they were personally trying to claw directly into my brain.

The alarms weren’t quite loud and screeching, but they were there at the back of my mind trying to push their way to the forefront. Boarding school was always a dream of mine as a kid. Everyone wanted to go to Hogwarts and that’s what it was. Minus the magic—and death. I just wasn’t expecting dorms to be a Starbucks thing. I mean, you’re not supposed to sleep there, right? Unless that was a universal thing, and it was me who had been out of loop the whole time.  I thought I’d misheard my manager at first. 

Her name was Claire, and she acted the way I imagined a golden retriever would if it turned into a human. She was all wide smiles and bright eyes. Her fluffy sweater told me everything I needed to know about her within seconds of us meeting. 

Claire was a millennial, had seen Harry Potter an ungodly amount of times, and most likely referred to dogs as “pupper’s”. I felt like I had already made a sort of connection with her. According to Google, that is how you ace an interview. Act casual. Playful even. She mentioned a favourite movie of hers, and I laughed and pretended I’d seen it, and then embarrassingly gone on to badly describe a scene I had only seen on Twitter via a gif-set which hadn’t even loaded properly. The point I’m trying to make is-- I was sure I’d already gotten the job. 

I had the phone interview and completed an online questionnaire before I was called in for a trial. I  was excited. It was my first job, and so far the in-person interview had been going well. I had even been offered a mocha. It was lukewarm because I had spent the last ten minutes answering questions and signing paperwork, but it was a nice gesture all the same.

“Dorms?” I promised myself to only question things I needed to know. I didn’t want to come across as annoying or desperate. But I also had to make sure I was being polite and keen. Claire had talked me through all the drink combinations and secret menu, followed by the dress code, as well as the usual rules of any workplace. I already kind of knew how to make basic coffee, but as for different flavours, combinations, and toppings, I had no idea. I often got Starbucks via Uber Eats, and the effort of the decoration always baffled me. 

These kids were artists. Broke college students fashioned into literal Van Gogh. Every time I ordered a simple coffee, I found a cartoon pumpkin or a smiley face—sometimes a message telling me to have a great day. Starbucks employees had always intrigued me. How could college kids work all night and have a functioning brain to continue on their day? How could they make a drink on demand and not screw up? And why… why were they always smiling? Every time I happened to be walking past, I always caught either a guy or a girl grinning behind the counter. It wasn’t a happy smile or even content. 

It just was. 

And it was enough to cause me jaw pain when I happened to notice. Nobody was that happy. Unless they had a goddamn gun to their head. That is what I expected when I applied.  I expected a shitty manager and shittier working conditions.

What I got instead, however, was a sort of family. That’s what Claire said, anyway. Though I was yet to see this so-called “family” she had been referring to. 

For one, I had barely seen anyone. It was early evening and there was barely anyone there. I did see a staff member when I walked in. The guy was around my age, maybe a little older. He was serving a customer, who seemed to have fallen for his fake charm. His attention flashed to me for the fraction of a second, and I found myself taken aback by just how wide his smile was. It didn’t even falter.

The guy shot me a Hollywood grin before going back to explaining the specials to the customer.  That was not normal. The kid bypassed any kind of emotion. He could have been angry, sad, happy, joyful, despairing. I would never know. 

I’ve always wondered if Starbucks smiles are behind a lack of spirit and sleep deprivation. But this guy’s smile was a whole fucking level. Anyway, according to Claire, I was expected to learn as I made mistakes through my training. Which was fine with me. I was prone to making mistakes so I’d fit in pretty well. When she had brought up living arrangements, though, I was taken off guard.

Everything I had memorised fizzled out, and I was left feeling like someone had just scooped half of my brain out of my skull. Instead of questioning her further, I took a hesitant sip from my mocha and almost choked on it. Until then, I was comfortable. Her office was cosy, with beanbags instead of chairs. Claire sat in front of piles of coffee-stained paperwork and a battered looking MacBook, sipping iced tea from a mug covered in smiley faces. She didn’t seem the least bit fazed.

Her lips quirked into a smile, and she straightened up, steepling her fingers. I could tell she was the type of person who revelled being in a powerful position.

A wolf in sheep’s clothing—who happened to be the manager of a major coffee chain.

Claire inclined her head slightly to the left. Just enough to appear concerned. “Are you alright? You look quite pale.”

Quickly, I got a hold of myself. “Uh, yes! Sorry, I spaced out.” I cleared my throat, nursing my mocha in my lap. “What did you say about dorms?”

“Hmm?” She raised a brow. “What is there not to understand?”

That caught me off guard. I was aware of my fingers nervously peeling the sticker off of my cup. “I mean… is it like… student dorms?”

The woman surprised me with a laugh. Not the laugh I had been expecting—more of a witchy cackle. “Ahh, we get this a lot.” Her smile widened. It was identical to their smiles. The employee’s I glimpsed in passing. Her gaze flicked to the paper in front of her. 

“Matilda, is it?”

I nodded. “Mattie is fine.”

Claire pursed her lips. “Mattie. What a lovely name. Well, to answer your question, we are a 24 hour establishment and our employees are expected to work through the night into the early hours. So, we offer dorms! They’re not perfect, of course. Very simple and minimalist. Just a bed. There’s usually a rota for those on the night shift, and they take turns serving customers and attending to their usual duties while others sleep—and then they swap between shifts.” She must have caught my expression. I don’t know if I looked confused or disgusted—maybe both. Claire picked up a pen, twirling it between nimble fingers. 

“Dorms are offered to those who need them. We have employees who take up our offer, as well as those  who prefer to go home where they are more comfortable,” she laughed, and I forced myself to laugh along with her. “Most people prefer their privacy and would rather not spend every waking moment with their colleagues, but the offer is still there for those who want it.” Her lips quirked. “You never know, Matilda. Once you start working here, you may never want to leave.”

“Yeah…” I said. “I think I’d prefer going home though.”

“Yes, yes, of course!” She put emphasis into every word. “Whatever makes you comfortable, Matilda.”

“Mattie.” I corrected—again.

“Right.” Her tongue curled around my name. “Mattie.”

Claire held my gaze for a moment. And it was probably the most uncomfortable few seconds of my life. Finally, Claire seemingly caught a hold of herself. The trance was broken. “Okay! Well, today will be a paid trial which you will be expected to finish, and that will take us into tomorrow morning. We don’t expect much, just common sense, and a passion for learning new things.” Gathering up paperwork and stained coffee mugs, my manager hurried towards the door, and I struggled to keep up with her babbling. 

“If you make any mistakes, don’t worry. I’ll appoint a helper if needed, but you should be fine. You can meet everyone else when I have finalised paperwork! Would you like another drink?” She stopped three inches from my face, and I got a whiff of strawberry scented shampoo and expensive perfume mixed with mint.  The closer she got, the more I could smell. 

A cocktail of aromas choking my nose and throat. Claire seemed to be drinking me in, her eyes piercing right through me. As if she could read my mind, Claire’s smile widened. The air moved when she spoke. “I’m excited to work with you, Matilda,” she murmured, “We haven’t had a newbie in quite a while. I’m sure our Starbucks family will be happy to see a fresh face.”

“And I’m excited to work here,” I said in a breath, struggling to keep my composure. The words were suffocating my mouth before I could swallow them. Definitely not mine. They felt forced. Alien. When Claire finally stepped back, turning her attention to her busy schedule, and an imaginary watch on her wrist, I allowed myself to hiss out in relief. She pulled open the door with way too much vigour.

 “Alright, you wait here! I’ll grab you a schedule, and then we’ll start you off in storage! It’s not very interesting. You’ll be taking stock, and making sure we have everything we need. Oh, and there’s also Jun, but don’t mind him. He’s a sweetheart, really. If you do happen to meet him, make sure to be soft spoken as he doesn’t react well to loud—" 

Claire was already gone before I could reply. She was still muttering to herself as she yanked open swinging wooden doors, hurrying back to the front of the store. When she was gone, and I was sure I was alone, I leaned against the wall and sputtered out a laugh, surprising myself. “What the fuck.” I spoke to thin air. I said it again in a sharp, panicked breath.

What the fuck?

I already made my decision. When it was my break and nobody was watching me, I was going to make a run for it. Because fuck weird ass manager’s on a power trip taking pleasure in making staff uncomfortable. Abandoning my coffee, I grabbed my bag and shouldered it, my gaze flicking to the door. It would be so easy, I thought. I could just walk out and go home, pretending the interview had never happened. The more I thought about it—about my manager’s strange behaviour, as well as the stink of her, intense scents mixing together, overwhelming me, I was getting progressively more weirded out. It wasn’t that she smelled bad. It was the opposite. 

She smelled good. Too good. I was reminded of when I was in middle school. I adopted a stray cat, and it would regularly pee all over the house despite us trying to train it. I started realizing my clothes were stinking of cat pee, and then so did my classmates. They didn’t say anything to my face, though rumours started to spread that I didn’t wash my clothes. So, I doused myself in my mom’s perfume to mask the smell. It didn’t help. If anything, the perfume made the stink worse. That’s the impression I got from my manager. 

My manager was hiding another scent on her, one she didn’t want me to smell. Fuck it, I was going to run.  The main office was on a rundown hallway with peeling paint and mould creeping up every wall. I was calculating the best time to power-walk back to the storefront and straight out of the front door without anyone seeing me, when a voice startled me. “How long have you been here?” There was a brunette standing behind me looking less than impressed. She was kitted up in the usual Starbucks getup, a black and green short sleeved shirt, and a matching cap hiding bedraggled curls.

Ponytail, I mentally named her.

I could almost mistake her expression for being… territorial. I had only ever seen this in cats when I visited friends. When they sense a new person, fight or flight hits, and they decide if you’re a threat or not. Unbelievably, this was the exact same impression I was getting with her.

The way Ponytail seemed to stiffen up, her hands balling to fists at her sides, her nose flaring, jaw visibly clenching.

“Not long,” I shrugged, gesturing to Claire’s office. “I was just having my interview.”

The girl wasn’t smiling—which was a surprise.  I couldn’t quite describe her expression. It was cross between annoyed and amused. She folded her arms across her apron. The girl’s hands were covered in white powder. Her overall state was dishevelled. I noticed her shirt was stained at the bottom, the buttons on her collar missing. Her ponytail was half-assed, strands of hair dangling in her eyes she kept blowing away in frustrated puffs. 

The way she held herself was strange. Like she was trying to appear stronger than she was. It looked like the girl might brace herself against the wall with one hand, but instead she swiped at her head, smearing white powder all over her cheeks.  “No, I mean how long has it been since you stepped in here?” The girl’s lip curled with distaste. I could tell my mere presence was annoying her.

Like Claire, this girl was reading me with a simple skim of her eyes. “How long has it been since you walked in the doors?”


How many times did she have to ask the same fucking question?

The more I was looking at Ponytail, I started to notice the skin of her hands looked rough, her fingernails chipped and bitten to the stubs. It wasn’t until she was placing her hands on her hips, and her shirt rode up, flashing her stomach—I noticed a scar slicing across her gut.

It was rough and rugged, the stitches clumsy. I wasn’t a medical expert, but that didn’t look official. Maybe she had done it herself. But then it made wonder: What wound was it, and how had she gotten it in the first place? It wasn’t my business, sure, but this girl was one giant question mark. One I wanted to get away from. “I don’t know,” I tore my gaze from her stitches. “I got here a while ago. Claire said I’m doing a trial.”

“No.” Ponytail shook her head. “Leave.”

 “What?”

Taking a step forward, the girl’s eyes darkened. “You haven’t been here long, right? Just leave.” She offered me a smile which was more of a desperate grimace. “The bookstore across the street is hiring. You don’t want to work here. Being a barista isn’t easy, y’know.”

I nodded slowly. “Yeah, I’m not planning on staying.”

“Good.” Ponytail gave me a curt nod. The girl had freckles, I noticed. But they didn’t look natural. How can I explain this? Do you know when you draw on your face as a kid? It looked like she’d given herself freckles with sharpie. “Just slip out of the front door. You should be fine.”

The way Ponytail  kept looking behind her was putting me on edge. When she whipped around for the third time, her ponytail moving with her, I bit back a frustrated yell. Gripping my backpack strap, I swallowed the dread starting to away at me. “Why do you want me to leave?”

She shrugged. “Depends. Did Claire tell you what happens after 10?”

Something ice cold slipped down my spine. I struggled to harbour my bag, grasping the straps. “No? What are you talking about?”

What I wasn’t expecting was for the girl to adapt a sudden look of sympathy. Her hands began to tremble at her sides.

Ponytail opened her mouth to speak, before the door opened at the end of the hallway, a wave of loud chatter and laughter from the store sweeping in. “Hey, Elena,” I couldn’t see a face, only a tanned arm holding the door open. “Did you move the strawberry syrup from storage?”

I noticed her stiffening up again. Nose flaring. Eyes flashing.

Yeah, it was definitely a territorial thing.

This girl was straight up pissed I was intervening on their weird Starbucks family.

“It’s on the counter.” She replied, her gaze straying on me. “I used it earlier. If not, you know who to ask.”

“But Jun scares me.” The voice was a guy. From the tone of his voice, an overly happy yell, it was the kid with the permanent grin.

“Jun scares everyone.” Her piercing gaze faltered, and she straightened up, wiping her hands on her apron. “Is it on the counter?”

“Nope.”

“Look again.” Elena rolled her eyes. “If you actually pay attention, instead of playing that stupid game, you might find it.”

“Ha!” The guy scoffed. “Good joke.” The door opened a little more, and I glimpsed reddish curls sprouting from a Starbucks cap. “Seriously, there’s an abnormal number of people wanting strawberry latte’s right now. Bits is on her break, and Freddie’s taking his hourly nap.”

Elena’s lip twitched. She finally turned to face him. “On the table? Again?”

“Yep.” He popped the P. “His favourite spot. We’ve had customers complaining, but he’s just telling them to fuck off,” The guy laughed. “He’s gonna get a disciplinary.”

Though it was sing-song, so it sounded more like, “Heeeeeeee’s gonnaaaaaa get a disiplinarrryyyyy.”

The guy paused in his apparent manic episode, judging from him jumping up and down behind the door.  I couldn’t see him properly, just a shadow, and battered converse hitting old tiles. “Wait, who are you talking to?” I glimpsed a flash of a face, before the guy backed away.

I could have sworn something was covering the left side of his face—but I couldn’t tell what it was.

“Oooh, is it a new kid?”

Elena went into territorial mode again, irritation pricking in her eyes. She shot me one last look. “Go.” She mouthed, before turning and marching back down the hallway. The head of reddish curls and no identity bled away, and Elena slipped back through the gap. “Do you know how much work I have to do? Why can’t you ask Bits?” Her voice floated onto the hallway, chasing the door which was shutting with a loud creak. I could still hear the murmur of patrons bleeding in. “It’s there!” Elena shouted. “It was literally two feet in front of you, dude!”

With the two of them distracted, I turned my attention back to getting the fuck out of there.

I was backing away, planning to try find a way out through the back, when I bumped into something warm. Moving.

Once again, I was overwhelmed with the stink of flowers and expensive perfume. Pretty much every nice smelling scent I could think of.

Claire. Holding a fresh coffee. She’d written my name on the front in sharpie.

Matilda.

“There you are!” Before I could respond, she was shoving the coffee in my face. “Okay! Let’s head to storage!” It’s not like I had a choice whether I followed her or not, the woman had a tight hold of my wrist. Claire spoke as she walked, pulling me stumbling along behind her. 

“Okay, so storage! Admittedly, it’s not the most interesting job. You will just be unloading boxes and taking stock for now.” Behind a large metal door, the storage room was bigger than I’d imagined. It was just a room full of boxes. I was handed a clipboard and a pen and told to meticulously count every item in every box and catalogue each number. Easy enough. 

Claire didn’t give me time to speak—to even imply that I wanted to leave. She was skipping away before I could open my mouth. I’d like to say I left soon after that, but then I wouldn’t be writing this, would I? The truth is I stayed. I don’t know why I stayed. Guilt? I felt kind of sick, so kneeling on rotten tiles and keeping myself in a certain position while I stared at fruit for several hours, was surprisingly more appealing than attempting to try and find a way out.

I didn’t want to make any sudden movements. So, I found myself lost in my own thoughts. It wasn’t until I had been moved to the counter, when I started to notice things that were out of place. Wrong. It was around half nine when I was told to chop fruit with another employee—and I’d already passed Elena four times. The first time, her eyes nearly popped out of her head. “Go!” She mouthed, stumbling past me, her arms full of boxes. The second time, she didn’t even look at me. Third, she offered me a sad smile, and fourth, I glimpsed tears in her eyes.

I was serving a customer under Claire’s watchful glare when Elena dumped a Starbucks apron and uniform in front of me.  She didn’t say anything and stormed away, muttering something under her breath. I caught her every so often standing with another girl. A smiley blonde.

The two of them were cleaning tables, talking amongst themselves, and I couldn’t help growing paranoid that they were talking about me.

While busying myself chopping fruit, attending to customers and sweeping the floor with the others, I finally met my colleagues.

And meeting them gave me even more inclination to get the fuck out of there.

I started to realise why Elena had been so territorial.

Why she wanted to protect them.

It started off fairly normal. I was struggling to cut through a pineapple, when the curly blonde who had been talking with Elena sidled in front of me. Her eyes were kind, but her smile was lesser than. The girl was side-stepping in time to a song on the radio. “I can help you!” She had a southern accent, a nasally tone, which immediately settled the knot in my gut. The girl took my knife and gutted the pineapple in three strokes before cutting it into cubes. A total pro. “I’m Bitsy.” She offered me a smile. “Short for…” she trailed off, her smile fading, the gleam in her eyes fizzling out. “You know what’s crazy?” Bitsy waved the knife with a chuckle, “I can’t remember what my name was!”

“I’m—”

She cut me off. “Matilda! Claire told us all about you! I’m looking forward to working with you!”

I nodded along, trying to smile, when I noticed she didn’t have ears. But I had been so taken aback by her blonde curls, the way they framed her face and spilled from her Starbucks cap—I didn’t even notice. Once I noticed her ears, I saw more. Like the more I looked at Bitsy, I was seeing pieces of her… missing. It was little things. The skin on the back of her hand was covered in a band aid, but I could glimpse stitch marks. When she brushed her hair out of the way, I noticed the flesh on her neck looked wrong—too lumpy. 

Bitsy herself looked drained, like all the life had been sucked from her. And yet she was still somehow smiling. I caught her reaching for a box of fruit up above, and just like Elena, the girl’s lower back was covered in stitches and rugged skin. Like someone, or something, had been slicing into their flesh.

Was it them? I couldn’t help wondering. Maybe they were tattoo’s they wanted to get rid of. That was the logical explanation, anyway.

Until I met the guy’s.

Rory was the joker—the one who had been singing orders all night and was starting to drive me insane.  I’d only heard his voice because he hid his face a lot. Not in front of customers. In front of strangers, he maintained that Starbucks Smile, but behind the counter preparing drinks, humming to himself and dancing to the radio, the guy made sure to duck his head at the exact time I happened to lift mine. 

He was a burst of energy I wasn’t used to. 

The others welcomed it. Bitsy and Elena treated him like a younger brother. I watched them chat back and forth. Sometimes when it was quiet, Rory swiftly jumped over the counter, side stepping over to where they were sitting on their break.

“Whatcha doing?” Oozing charm with just his voice, he slid into a chair opposite the two of them.

“Talking.”  Bitsy’s eyes were a little too wide. I could see a crush from a mile away. Her smile spoke volumes. “Go away.”

“Wow,” he laughed, “Alright, that hurt my ego.”

He kept his back to me, engaging in conversation with them—when he was supposed to be fucking helping me.

I thought he’d keep it up all night. Hiding away from me. But there was a point when a woman came in and ordered enough coffee to hydrate North America. Rory automatically turned to his left where he thought Elana was. But I had taken her place while she was in storage.

Initially, I didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary. He was short and stocky, a handsome kind of thin face, a mess of curls he was trying his best to hide his face with. Rory reminded me of a guy I used to date—minus the ridiculous Starbucks Smile. But it was just like Elena and Bitsy. One glance meant nothing. I could map out a basic facial structure. But when I kept looking at them—and then him, things started to bloom out of nowhere. The reason why I had only been able to see the left side of his face, was because Rory was wearing an eyepatch.

But not just that. Again, I was starting to see pieces of him missing. Like a jigsaw puzzle left out. Like Bitsy, his right ear was missing, as well as his pinkie on his left hand. It was just small things, but adding up, and comparing them to my other colleagues, seeing rugged skin on his hairline, I started to feel kind of sick. It wasn’t until he bent down to tie his shoelaces, and I saw the exact same skin graft on his lower back—just like Bitsy and Elena—I told myself I was going to get out of there. But first… first, I had to know what was going on with the three.

“Newbie.” Elena finally came over to me when I was trying to concentrate on serving customers, and not searching for skin grafts or missing pieces on my colleagues. The girl shoved a box in my face. “Storage. I asked Rory, but he’s being an ass. Just take it and don’t ask questions.”

Behind her, Bitsy’s smile was fading as time inched towards ten. I noticed a change in all of them. Rory was playful, tapping his foot nervously while he prepared drinks, and Elena and Claire were bringing in coolers and setting them on the counter. I tried to peel back a lid, but Claire slapped my hand away. “Not yet.” She said, her gaze flicking to the group of teenage girls waiting in line. “Wait until last orders, Matilda.”

It was 10pm, I had been told we were open all night. What was she talking about?

I met Jun (Junpei) in storage, hiding behind a door. The kid was younger than me, maybe nineteen. 

He looked to be of Japanese descent, and I found him with his head buried in his lap, his arms wrapped around his knees. Jun wore the Starbucks uniform, but it was filthy and glued to him. When I asked who he was, the kid turned to me, and it was like looking directly into a void. There was nothing on his face, like his entire being had been ripped away. Jun did smile at me. I could see laughing lines in his expression, creases in his eyes. Signs he was a joker. That he laughed a lot. Now there was nothing left. “Newbie.” Jun said, before giggling to himself, burying his head back into his lap.

“Don’t mind Jun.” Bitsy told me, poking her head through the door. Her eyes were dark. “He got the worst of it. The A1’s ripped him apart.”

I couldn’t respond. I wanted to shake him, to wake him up. But I couldn’t. There was nothing to wake up.

“Jun was the strongest,” Bitsy said softly. “He fought for us. And I swear to god, I thought he’d win… I thought he’d get us out.”

When she laughed, it was pathetic, just a sputter. “And once Jun was gone, they took us one by one. Claire really was quite brutal.”

The girl was leaning in the doorway, chewing on a candy snake. “But you can still get out,” she said. “I think. I mean, you can try.”

That was it.

Yeah, that was enough fucked up shit for me.

I can’t tell you how many times I tried to get out of there.

But every time I managed to sneak towards the door, Claire was always behind me, her fingernails digging into my shoulder.

“Orders, Matilda!”

10:12pm.

Everything seemed fairly normal, if I stopped thinking too hard about my colleagues and whatever the fuck was going on with them.

I was heading to storage when the door flew open, almost hitting me in the face. My fourth colleague strode in, a bundle of confusion and black hair sticking from his cap which was clumsily slipping off his head.  Compared to the others, this guy seemed… well, he wasn’t missing any pieces of himself. He was wearing sunglasses inside, but that was normal to me. A pair of raybans pinned back dark brown curls.  Nobody was questioning why has wearing them. The others hounded him with smiles and rolled eyes. 

Bitsy playfully shoved him, and Elena lectured him about sleeping in store. Rory raised his hand for a high five, which he ignored. The kid acknowledged me with a scowl, yawned, and then grabbed a knife and started chopping fruit at an insane pace. I watched him, kind of baffled, until splashes of red started to spot the counter. The guy’s nose was bleeding, but he paid no mind, swiping at it with the sleeve of his shirt. When it got bad enough that it was started to drip down his neck, I couldn’t resist questioning it. I mean, the guy’s nose was dripping scarlet, and he continued chopping.

Unfazed.

“Are you… okay?” I hissed out. “You’re bleeding.”

“Yep.” He surprised me with a response, peeling an apple. The guy’s voice was deep. Like, deep, deep. He turned to me, and I realised his eyes were blank. Empty. He was looking right through me. “It does this sometimes. I bleed from my nose because they cut me up inside.”

His words sent my stomach into my throat.

“What?”

“Excuse me.” He said. He held up his hand, and I had to bite back a scream. He’d sliced right into his thumb—into the bone.

“I’m bleeding quite a lot,” The guy said.  I saw no pain in his expression, no clenching jaw or strain in his face. “I’ll go get a band-aid.”

He was gone before I could question him.

The worst part is he was walking. He was walking. When half of his thumb was hanging off.

Rory surprised me, sliding in front of me, his arms crossed across his apron. “Don’t mind Freddie,” he said with a grin. “An A1 took all of him, man. Every emotion he’s ever had.” With a sigh, the guy tipped his head back, blowing his hair out of his face. “The guy’s a walking toaster.”

I didn’t hear myself say, “What?” But Rory was already continuing, his smile growing.

He moved closer—and the closer he got, I noticed I couldn’t see anything behind his eyepatch. There was no glint of life, not even traces that anything had ever been there. 

“Have you heard of the amygdala?” He pressed, shoving two fingers into his temple. “It’s the part of your brain that feels, you know? With fear being one of them. I mean we can all argue about which parts of the brain control what, but I think it’s more than that. I think it was tar-get-ed.” He giggled manically, and I started to wonder if it wasn’t just the Starbucks Smile. This guy was fucking crazy. The way he held himself, tipping slightly, head cocked to the side like a kid. “Do you wanna guess which part of me was taken?”

Before I could respond, he cleared his throat. “Freddie didn’t just have his fear snatched. Nope. The A1 was way too hungry for that.”

When I backed away, Rory raised a brow.

“Wait…” He said. “Our wonderful manager did tell you about our night guests didn’t she?”

Before I could speak, he was inches from my face. “Go.” He said through a grin, gesturing with his head. The door’s right there.”

I did. I didn’t think my body would be able to move, but pure adrenaline drove me forward. I was shaking when I stepped out into the cold air. I felt it hit my face, felt the gravel under my shoe—even the loud murmur of the late night commute. But when I took another step, I was walking back into golden light. Back under the famous green siren on the wall. I was back inside Starbucks. This time, Elena was waiting for me. She was holding a tray of drinks. Her expression was stoic, but I could see from her expression, she was fighting back a cry.

"Once they've smelled you and got a good taste, you can't leave. That's why I said,” she took another step. Until I could see her teary eyes.

Until I could see the skin on her face starting to come apart, stitches becoming loose when she tensed her face.

"Five minutes. That's all it takes. Just five minutes in here, and they've got you."

Rory started laughing, and he didn’t stop, his body shaking, trembling. Elena didn’t even look at him, only gently grasping my shoulder and pulling me close, her breath tickling my ear. “I really hope they don’t like you.” She said in a hiss. “If they like you, you’re stuck like us. They take parts of you until you beg them, and even then, they make you suffer. They will eat you from the inside out. Brain tissue and bone, organs and blood," she surprised me with a laugh identical to Rory’s. “Let’s just hope you end up like Jun. It’s better to have no thoughts.”

Elena let out a soft sob. “Better… better not to think,” she whispered. “Than be picked apart for fun. For leisure. For.. for food.”

The girl turned to me, and she was smiling a Starbucks Smile. But I saw her pain. Her fight. “I did tell you to leave.”

The doors blew open, and a sharp gust of wind hit me.

“Welcome!” Claire was suddenly at the counter, Bitsy and Rory at her side. The two of them were standing completely still. Unblinking.

But there was nobody there. I kept looking for stray customers, but I was just giving myself a migraine. Bitsy turned and grabbed one of the coolers, peeling off the lid.

I heard the breath catch in her throat. I saw her trembling hands grazing across smeared scarlet and white. I watched Bitsy take out lumps of red, while the colour dripped down her gloves and stained her apron. First, she took out a heart, and then half a lung, before finishing up with fleshy pieces of white, adding oat milk. Bitsy maintained her smile as she blended the drink and poured it into a to-go cup, her fingers working to attach a label. Bitsy set down the drink in front of thin air, her eyes wide and unseeing. “Heart, Lung, Flesh and oat milk latte!”

It took staring at nothing for several painstaking moments before I saw her.

She bloomed into existence, like my vision hadn’t adapted her yet. While the others had.

It was a woman. She was standing in front of me, and had always been standing there. She was beautiful. I couldn’t put her beauty into words. Like looking at something which wasn’t real. I was frowning at glossy locks of dark hair before I caught something… moving. And when I saw it, I couldn't stop seeing it. The woman’s skin was slithering, like there was something underneath trying to get through. When her skin started to pop, ugly black tendrils starting to slither out, I couldn’t stop staring. They were part of her, entwined between flesh and bone.

“Eyes up here, sweetie.”

The voice was like no other I’d ever heard. Melodic.

Sugary.

The type of voice you would hear right before a jaw of impossible teeth ripped into your jugular.

But once I was seeing her for who, or what she was, I saw all of her. Her true from was nothing but an eye attached to a black tendril snaking its hands around its order. “A newbie, hmm?” The eye moved towards Rory, slow, like it was teasing him. “Tell me, who is the new girl?”

Rory didn’t look at her. "I'm not supposed to talk to you," He said, his gaze on the blender. "According to rule 405, If human employee's speak to A1's, it is a direct offense, and the human will be dealt with accordingly. If I engage in conversation, I must offer another piece.”

The eye blinked. “Mmm hmm. Of what?”

Rory cleared his throat. “Myself, ma’am. I currently have a contract with Bob. I am his…”  The boy paused, his lips curling. “Sustenance.”

 "Very good!” The eye chuckled. “You’re learning! I heard a rebellious young human attacked an A1. You must be the one who was…corrected.”

Rory nodded, his smile widening. He snatched the oat milk from Bitsy. “More oat milk?”

Okay, so you can guess what I did next.

What the fuck do you think I did? I ran.

Even when the door didn’t make sense, when it just sent me hurtling back into the store, I stumbled towards it. But something cold and we was wrapping around my neck. I felt her poking and prodding me, searching for valuable pieces she could take. She barely touched my body, instead, slapping a slithery tentacle into my head, sifting through my hair. I remember her voice filled with glee, detailing which parts of me she was going to take. And Claire was right there, holding a clipboard and a pen, vigorously scribbling down my name and signing me over.

When the thing let me go, and my body hit the floor, I blanked out.

I didn’t stay awake for long. Waking up was strange. I felt myself, but also not. I was lying down on something soft. When I opened my eyes, my surroundings were unfamiliar. A box-like room filled with sleeping bags and wooden bunk beds. 

There was an ancient television in the corner, a bookcase, and a pathetic pile of comic books. The light was on, blinding me. There was chatter both up above me, as well as next to me. I spied Bitsy in Frozen PJ’s cross legged on a beanbag. There was a fresh bandage wrapped around her arm. Her eyes were on a dog eared copy of Lowfers ni eht ttaci. 

Next to her, Jun was lying on his front staring wide-eyed at a comic book. “Catch.” Rory’s voice from above. He threw a bag of snacks at Bitsy, who grasped them to her chest, continuing to read the book. Freddie was on the top bunk with his back to everyone. But his hand did whip out and grab the snacks Rory threw at him. Everything seemed… comfortable. Weirdly comfortable.

Elena jumped into Bitsy’s sleeping bag, trying to snatch her book. I think it was a mixture of drugs and my own brain chemistry which made me wonder, for a split second, if they really were a family. That was, at least, until I noticed the pack of snacks Rory was loudly snacking on.

The words on the front were… muddled. I had seen them so many times, but suddenly they weren’t making sense in my head.

Lays. I thought.

They were Lays chips.

But I wasn’t seeing “Lays”.

I was seeing something else.

My body was fine. I had no stitches, no missing skin. But… my head… my vision didn’t feel right.

It wasn’t until I was looking back at Bitsy’s book, when realisation slowly started to sink in.

They didn’t just take you physically. They took you mentally too. According to Bitsy, Rory’s fight was torn from him. Freddie lost his emotions, Jun, his memories…and me….?

I don’t know what I’ve lost.

But she definitely knew what she was doing. By taking my ability to read, it’s like seeing in black and white. Like picking apart a void.

Elena is territorial of the others because she knows our fate.

She knows that no matter what, we are going to give every piece of ourselves away until we are nothing. Just atoms.

Please, I am begging you.

Don’t let them take every single fucking piece of us.

…

Elena helped me type this. (Thank you, Elena). But I’ve been thinking. There are six of us. According to Elena, a contract is broken if a human physically comes in and takes us away. I promise there’s nothing else. You just have to come through the door and march us out.

No strings attached.

Well, there will be a Starbucks job which might be waiting for you…. But being a barista isn’t that bad, right?
