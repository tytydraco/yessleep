I have only just received all clear to tell, vaguely, one of the stories I must tell. I am a ward of a government entity that I cannot name, and I doubt you would know the name of. This entity oversees minding my creations, whereabouts, and behavior. I am closely monitored and must be mindful of how I interact with others. They have been closely intertwined in the writing and publishing of this so that I have not included proper names or whereabouts for any of the happenings.
 
Regardless, I am thrilled to be able to tell others about my life and my talent. I create living art. Not in the sense I am sure you are assuming. I do not play with plants or paint the human body. No, my art comes to life, in whatever medium and form I create it in. Now, with this ability there have been many ups and downs, as one can assume. A very select base of individuals is privy to my ability and can purchase my paintings, namely the top one percent of the world. I do not choose my clients as they are chosen for me. I like to hope that the entities in charge of me are unaware of what some of these individuals are doing within their homes and there is a reason why.
 
Due to my art being alive and having the same properties as us, despite being created entities, they are deeply affected by our world. I assume their world can see into ours as if looking through a window, just as we see into theirs. When I create my pieces, I do everything I can to create a balance in their world. The imbalance of the environment on the outside of the painting can have a drastic impact on the world inside.
 
I have one story that explains perfectly.
 
…..
 
I was commissioned to create a piece depicting a bright, soft, mythical paradise. It was commissioned as a birthday gift for the young daughter of a political leader and his very meek wife. I can remember the daughter very vividly. She had big blue eyes, hair so pale it almost looked like snow, and ever so quiet. Her mother had told me that the little one wasn’t fond of talking because of her disability. She was mostly deaf even with the use of top tier hearing aids. The parents themselves were a bit odd. The husband was loud and domineering. The sort of man you could see in a video about “alpha” males I suppose. His deep brown eyes were very sharp, and he kept himself very clean. Both in the way he dressed and in his almost compulsive need not to touch things. His wife was very petite, meek, and dressed in a way that imbued her as innocent. The perfect submissive wife.
 
The dynamic between the two made me keenly uncomfortable. The way she was unable or unwilling to input her opinion on the painting, the way she flinched when he raised his hand or moved too quickly. No, I was not fond of their dynamic at all. I had a feeling that the home was not stable and made it a point to read the paperwork and warnings aloud myself, before having them sign. I wanted to make it apparently clear that it was unwise to proceed with the purchase and commission of one of my paintings if there was strife in the household.
 
The papers were deftly signed, and I began my work.
 
The painting itself was an eleven by seventeen acrylic. I started as I always do with a pre-made acrylic ready canvas, for simplicity’s sake. With each layer I built the world. Sprawling fields and orchards full of glistening fruit, bustling villages with children playing in the streets, a sky full of singing birds and fluffy clouds. The main subject of the painting was a castle and the magical forest surrounding it. The battlements were coated in flowers and lined with jewels, a dragon lazily sleeping like a well-fed puppy by the castle wall. In the forest, prancing through the trees is a herd of unicorns, playing with faeries that dart through the boughs. Everything was in soft pastels, creamy whites, and deep emerald greens. It was lush with flora and fauna, practical bursting with life and vitality. By the time I was finished, the painting weighed a hefty forty pounds and boasted nearly thirty layers of individual scenes. Each scene feeds the world and its subjects. Balance.
 
When the couple came to retrieve the painting, the wife was wearing a turtleneck shirt, even though the temperature outside was anything but chilly. I again warned them about the fact that I could not be held responsible for anything that occurred once the painting was no longer in my possession. I was assured that everything would be fine and watched as the painting was hauled away.
 
Some time passed before I caught any word or update regarding this particular piece of art until the day I was retrieved to “talk” to my painting.
 
It turns out that this painting had, in a very unique fashion, created a depiction of what had occurred during the time it was in the home. It was in the form of a wordless graphic imprint on the back of the painting. The government entity wanted me to go and interpret the images for them.
 
What I saw was deeply obscene and dark. Read no further if you are easily triggered or offended. Skip past the dots for your own safety.
 
…….
 
The couple was in fact, not a proper couple at all. The husband and wife were siblings. After the death of their parents, the brother took custody of his younger sister and succeeded in isolating her from the outside world. During the time between her being a child and becoming an adult he had brainwashed her, through beatings and sexual assault, to believe that he loved her and that the world would never understand. The daughter was the result of his endless rounds of sexual assault. He had attempted to force an abortion through both brutal beatings and medical means but failed.
 
During the time the painting had hung, it was placed in the little girl’s room. The poor child was not safe from her father’s depravity and, unfortunately, even her room was unsafe. After years of enduring torture and abuse, the mother could not bear to see her child endure the same circumstances. For this reason, she intervened in the attempted sexual abuse of the little girl and was beat to death by her enraged brother. The painting had, at this point, reached a critical point. The dragon could not sit idly by and watch the monster win. It was created to protect the princess after all. With the brother’s final blow and the rending screams of the terrified girl it peeled its way from the painting. Along with it came faeries that pulled the small child into the painting, so she did not have to bear witness to the dragon mauling the man to death. So torn apart was he, that they had to scrape his remains from the walls and replace the floor.
 
I knew that the child was, in essence, trapped within the painting but requested that she be allowed to remain inside. I was questioned regarding this request and my answer was simply that the little girl was a princess there and she could not live a better life anywhere else. The government official relented.
 
The painting was promptly purchased by a man that has taken many of my ill-gotten paintings and was whisked away to some manner of home I was not privy to. This person has taken many of my failed or “damaged” paintings for a reason I will never understand, though I hope to one day be allowed to.
 
……
 
It all began with incest and murder, only to end with a princess in her castle. A bitter-sweet ending for the beautiful blue eye darling and her peaceful pastures.
 
When someone warns you that an art piece may just be alive, be wary. It may be one of my works that somehow landed up in the unwitting hands of the average joe. If it is indeed one of my pieces of living art heed this warning:
 
My art is alive, in every sense of the word. Each creature, plant, and person depicted is as real as you or I. The worlds I create are real and to them I may be a god, but you are merely a glimpse into another reality. If there is strife, unease, pain, or misery in your home; put the art piece back. Go no further with the people of paint, for they will not hesitate to kill or maim. They require a stable home, much like a child. I am not responsible for your destruction if you do not listen to my warning.
 
Once again, beware of the living art.
