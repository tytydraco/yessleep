Update:

If you haven’t seen my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gmt4y6/eyes_in_the_forest_part_1/) I would recommend reading it. It has been a few months now and things have gotten a bit worse. But first I would like to thank everyone who responded to my last post on the subreddit. I got some insight into the subject from some of you.

 I got a lot of suggestions but the most promising one was this. Some said it could be this creature called a skinwalker. 



I looked into it and checked a lot of boxes. But I’m not sure. I’m not a superstitious person so it's all just so hard to believe. But I have no explanation for what I saw out there, so I will have to abandon all rational thought in my endeavor to find out what that thing was. Nothing about that thing made sense. So maybe this whole cryptid thing is what I am looking for.



Anyways, like I said things have gotten worse. I have been having nightmares of that thing in the woods for these past 4 months. I thought they would go away after some time but instead they have gotten worse. I keep seeing its face. That cold, emotionless expression. Sometimes when I look at Anne all I see is that—  *thing* staring back, until I snap out of it. It’s gotten so bad I have been considering seeing a psychiatrist. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and hear a faint scratching on the wooden fence. I’m seeing things, hearing things. This whole event had taken a toll on my mental state. 



I still haven’t told Anne. She has noticed my spiral but I fear if I told her what happened it would make everything worse. There is no way she would believe me. I would just sound like some crazy lunatic. She would ship me off to a mental institute and I would be stuck there to rot. 

I don’t want that, nobody wants that.





Edit: This will be a quick one, Anne should return from the store soon and I have to help her cook.

 It's not just me. 

Anne can hear it too. The scratching.

I’m not crazy, I knew I wasn’t crazy.

This morning as I was brewing a pot of coffee she said it.

 “Has that scratching been keeping you up too?”

“Probably just a raccoon or something, nothing to worry about,” I said in response.

I know it's not a raccoon.

Today I went outside the fence line for the first time in months. The outer side of the fence facing the woods is utterly destroyed. Deep gashes lined the fence that appeared to be made by large claws. The gashes were so deep some were peeking through to the other end. 

It could just be a bear.

It's probably just a bear.

But do I believe it's a bear?

No.



I can’t take any more sleepless nights, I can’t take any more gnawing fear, I can't take it. I just can’t. I fear for myself, I fear for my wife…

Last week we discovered she is pregnant with our daughter…

We have to get out of this house. For her sake. 



Will update soon.



Edit 2: It’s been 3 hours. Where the f\*ck is she.
