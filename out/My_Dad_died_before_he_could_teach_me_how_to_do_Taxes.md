I called Elizabeth. She goes to school in a different state about 6 hours from me. I hadn’t expected her to answer me but she did and all I could say was my dad died. She immediately told me she would see me soon and hung up the phone. 



I began anxiously cleaning my house and realized I hadn’t been doing such a good job. The bottom of my trashcan was stuck to the floor from spillage of some sorts. My kitchen sink had about five different sponges in various degrees of use yet used enough to not know which one was the newest. My shower had more hair than my face which was definitely needing a trim or cut. 



The coffee table had become a catch all for jackets, socks, and pocket change. My bedroom was mostly okay except for the sixty-seven half drank coke cans by my desk. I counted as I cleared them out and wondered if you could somehow deduct them from your taxes. 



The scariest thing in the world to me was Taxes. If you did them wrong, you go to jail and I never wanted to go to jail. Dad watched a lot of crime shows when I was growing up and I just knew I would be the bitch for some dude. 



First of all, I am only 5’5 and I weigh about 125 give or take a little. I’m sort of lanky looking and I have a pretty face as the girls always said when trying to flirt with me. My need for isolation seemed to attract them, especially the goth and emo girls. I wasn’t really into anybody and tried to ignore the attention in highschool. 



Elizabeth never tried to flirt with me or fawn over me. She did stare a lot at times but always had a blank look on her face. We were both seventeen when we met, and it didn’t take long for us to become best friends. She was new and didn’t know anyone and she lived next door. 



She came over to help me with math. Numbers never made sense to me. I could add, subtract, multiply, and divide no problem. However, beyond this my brain just saw foreign objects and still does. She’s the only reason I didn’t fail math and graduated. In return I helped her with writing and essays. 



We also helped each other with companionship. Despite our loner attitudes we still had teenage hormones and general social needs. We just needed less than our peers and so we were sort of outcast to our own world. This was fine, we had each other.



As predicted no doubt, we began dating right before graduation.



After graduation things began to change. She started talking about college and how excited she was to go and asked me how I would like it. I tried to avoid telling her that I had no plans to go to college and deal with more math. I had my fill already and would rather work a dead-end job that paid poverty levels than try to decipher those equations even one more time. 



I assumed she would be going to our community college, and I could just appear there when she wasn’t in class. Looking back, I’m not sure what I planned to do long term. Eventually she would realize I never went myself. 



She wasn’t going local though and this was a problem. I didn’t want to be in a long-distance relationship, I wanted her to stay. We argued for weeks over it until finally she broke and agreed to start a year later. 



Over the next six months the arguments had stopped, and we settled into a nice routine. I moved in the trailer and she had basically moved in too but was still welcome at her parents anytime and still had nights over there. She even began some decorating while I worked at the Wendy's in town. 



She chose to do housekeeping work around town instead of finding a 9 to 5 job, I was fine with this. This left her with plenty of time to see friends and go to the store and decorate the house. 



One evening I came home and found her curled up in a ball, on the couch, crying. I tried to ask what was wrong but she couldn’t speak through her tears and so I used an old trick that my mom taught my dad and my dad used on me growing up. A warm wet washcloth followed by a cool wet washcloth. 



She wiped first with the warm one and it helped her relax enough to stop crying as hard. Then she wiped her face with the cool one to help sooth the swelling that had begun in her face from crying. I asked her again what was wrong.



“Knocked up and washed out before I’m even twenty.” She snarled.



“Huh?” I was confused, what did she mean by that. She didn’t respond, just stared at the coffee table and I turned to see if anything there explained.



There was a box with a picture of a pink stick on the front. Without reading the name on it I knew what it was. Suddenly I understood what was happening and what knocked up meant. Then my stomach flopped and anger started to fill me as it occurred to me the last intimate moment we had was when she agreed six months ago to stay. 



“I hope you know you need to have sex to make a baby.” I said breaking the silence and broaching the difficult subject. Maybe she was six months pregnant, and we didn’t know it. Maybe she hid it but can’t anymore. I tried in my mind to think of ways and excuses.



“Washed up.” She mumbled and turned her head down in her hands. 



“What does that mean, Elizabeth? How pregnant are you? Talk to me!”



“Felix, I messed up. Okay? I just really messed up.” She started to cry again.



Balling my hands together in my lap so I could control my anger, I demanded, “Tell me everything Elizabeth.”



“I went to the college a few weeks ago. You thought I went with my mom on vacation, but I didn’t. I just wanted to see the place and check it out since my last visit. There was a party and I ended up going and I met a guy while drunk. He reminded me of you. I drank too much and missed you and just let it happen when he made a move. I regretted it as soon as it was over. I sobered up, went to my hotel and didn’t leave again until it was time for me to come home. I wanted to forget it but then my period was super late and now… I’m pregnant.” She began sobbing again and wrapped her arms around herself as if she were going to fall apart. I sat back and stared for awhile unsure of what to say or do. 



The love for her in me wanted to comfort her and care for her but the anger and hurt wanted me to scream at her to get out of my home and never come back. I chose neither and just sat there. 



“What are you going to do, Elizabeth?” I asked, needing to know.



“I start college in 6 months. I’m 19 years old. I stay in a trailer with my high school boyfriend who isn’t even the father and works at a Wendy’s and has no drive for better work. I don’t have a steady job either. So I don’t know Felix, tell me what I should do?” She snapped at me. Her words stung and painted a clear picture.



“Ask the father.” I stood up and walked away to the bedroom. 



For a few weeks she stayed on the couch, crying a lot, she said it was just hormones. She did spend about a week with her mom, I suspect that’s when she had it taken care of. I don’t know if she ever spoke with the real father, but it didn’t matter once it was over with. 



We did start acting more like a couple again, we hadn’t actually broken up so it was expected. I didn’t want to leave her; I loved her and had even already had fantasies of marrying her and having our own family one day. I could tell she regretted her mistake though I was not sure if she regretted making the mistake or ending up caught? 



By time for college our relationship had turned into a friendship with certain benefits, like hugs and kisses, but otherwise not very intimate. We had stopped communicating from fear of lashing out over the mistake. This was difficult for me because I liked to allow my feelings to be known. 



As I watched her pack one of her bags to go I felt my emotions beginning to spill over. What if she never came home again? What if she cheated again? What if she died? What if I died? What was I going to do without her to sleep next to at night? 



I lost it then and started begging and pleading with her to stay. If she wanted to go to school we had a college she could go to. Why wasn’t it good enough? I offered to pay for all of it as long as she stayed. 



She said no and refused to budge. She had held up her original deal with me and I needed to hold up my end. That’s when I got nasty and called her names for cheating and lying. Told her, if she left we would be over so that she wouldn’t have to worry about getting caught. Told her, I knew that all she was going for was the hookups and I hoped she had birth control. Otherwise, they would surely know her name soon, down at the abortion clinic.



She grabbed her bag, smacked me, and left. 



We have text a few times and called since the fight but we never talked about it. It’s been nearly 2 years since then and we have just ignored it all and been friendly. I’m scared she will bring it all up while here. Right now I need to figure out my dad's death and his basement. 



She didn’t even bother to knock on the door. Just walked right in and threw her arms around me and hugged me for a minute. She pulled back and touched my face then smiled and pulled away. 



“Glad to see you’re not a puddle on the floor.” She said walking over to the couch to sit.



“Yeah you missed that actually.” I mumbled, sitting next to her.



“I’m sorry, Felix…” She paused and drew a breath, “So, what happened? When did he die?” She asked, taking one of my hands in hers and turning it palm up to trace with her finger. It felt nice and safe and I wanted to tell her everything.



“He died last week. It was a weird rat thing…” I trailed off, unable to find the words to describe what had happened to my father. 

“What do you mean by a weird rat thing? I don’t understand, Felix.” She sounded as confused as I felt. I didn’t know how to explain it. Maybe it was a coping mechanism, but I just couldn't form the words I needed. 



“Maybe I could show you instead.” It was then I realized I could have her go with me to the house and see the basement. It would seem less scary than going alone to the place of my fathers death. Going to that rat infested shithole was really the last thing I wanted to do but I had to. “He died in his basement, and I have to go look at it and get information for some guys to clear it out. I have avoided it and don’t want to go alone. Will you come with me?” 



Her arms shot out and grabbed me in a hug again, “Yes, of course Felix! That’s what I am here for. I am here for you to support and help you in this time of need. Anything you want or need just ask!”



I was shocked by this response and just nodded as I hugged her back. She sounded so happy but forced. Almost robotic or automatic and formal. It just didn’t sound as sincere as the hug felt. I figured it was due to our issues though and ignored it. 



I helped her bring her belongings in and noticed she had brought a few of the decorations back that she had taken with her. My place didn’t have any since they were all hers in the beginning and she probably knew I wouldn’t have thought to get any myself. 



She chattered about college as she unpacked and how she was doing in her psychology classes and such. She had always wanted to work in criminal psychology. She loved mysteries and studying old serial killers. 



I didn’t mind listening to her talk about them but I wasn’t always as interested. When we were together and I got bored of her ramblings I would simply hop on my pc and shut her out with the boys and my games. I think it might have hurt her feelings because she would get frustrated and try to get me to get off the game and talk with her or watch a movie. 



I knew she wanted to talk about the killers and watch the documentaries and I just didn’t. She would tell me that I could pick the movie or topic and it didn’t matter to her because she just wanted to spend time with me. It’s more fun to do what you want than to force yourself to do something just to spend time with someone else. So I never did that and just played my games while she did her own thing. 



When she got quiet I decided to let her have some alone time in the living room. She had a book and papers out and seemed to be studying them intently. 



I walked back towards my room but noticed a strange noise the closer I got to my door. I stood outside of it and listened intently. It was a loud raspy breathing, steady and strong but raspy like wheezing. I wondered what could make such a noise. 



I pushed my door open and of course saw nothing that I thought would be making the noise. Then my eyes landed on the mouse box on my bed. I walked over and looked down. The mouse was making the noise. I couldn’t tell if it was dying or not. 



The cracker was halfway eaten, and the water cap was now empty. I gave it more. It lay in a ball in the corner of the box. Every now and then I would see its head come up and an eye look around before curling right back down. 



“Is that your new pet?” Elizabeth asked, walking up behind me. 



“No, he was caught in the trap and making a god-awful noise, so I took him out and am just waiting for him to die.” I said with a wince at the memory of that sound. 



“Well, it sounds like it’s suffering. Can’t you put him out somehow?”



Suddenly I felt very protective of the mouse. “No, what if he can make it? What if all he needs is some rest and care and can survive the trap? I mean he is still alive right now.”



She stepped back caught off guard by my outburst. “I just meant to help him from suffering until death. You’re right though he could make it. I’m sorry.”



I picked up the box and moved him to my nightstand. My lamp glowed on the corner of his box where he lay. He seemed to like the warmth and relaxed more, popping his head up to face the light. I noticed Elizabeth shiver out the corner of my eye and it reminded me that I kept my house a nice cool sixty degrees. 



Elizabeth would complain that it was too cold and I would tell her to just bundle up because the summers are hot and I won’t be sweating in my house all the time. I eventually compromised with her to sixty-five but she said it was still a little too cool. With her gone it was back to sixty and the poor mouse was probably freezing. 



I walked into my bathroom and looked through my cabinet drawer until I found those white gauze pads. The kind you lay across the wound and tape up. I unfolded them and made it into a blanket of sorts and laid it across the mouse. He instantly popped his head under it and laid down. He was breathing heavily still but it had calmed down and now sounded like someone breathing through their teeth. 



Elizabeth wandered off while I was catering to the poor suffering creature. I figured she would just go back to her studies until I felt like talking. I needed to go to Dads house and look at that basement so I could get the exterminator but I really didn’t want to. 



I sat on the edge of my bed and stared down at my hands. His death was weighing heavily on me. Like a weighted blanket stretched across my entire body, hugging me as hard as possible, and somehow not crushing bones. I kept pushing it from my mind trying to focus on anything else, like taxes. As if learning taxes even matters, they have people you can pay to do them. 



No, my problems were bigger than taxes. My dad was dead and the way he died… How could I face that basement after what I saw? How could I look in there knowing that days ago my father was somehow trapped and eaten by the rats? He didn’t even have a rat problem! Where did the rats even come from?! 



He had laid there at the bottom of the stairs on his back. His arms by his side and feet straight. Like he had just laid down to take a nap or something. He liked wearing the douchebag shirts or wife beaters whatever you’re supposed to call them. His had been white but it was so blood soaked that it was red and pink. They had scratched and tore through it to be able to nibble at his stomach and chest. 



His jeans were less ripped and more full of holes than anything. His fingers had nothing left to them by the time I saw him. The rats had cleaned them off like chicken wings. His belly was so gnawed on that you could see his slick slimy internal organs which the rats were digging around in like it was a fun waterpark. There was so much blood. 



His face was the worst to me. They had picked his right side clean like his fingers. You only saw the skull, his eyeball was gone, they picked it down to his jaw and you could see his jaw bone and teeth. The otherside still had an eyeball and he had some muscle left. His nose was gone too. 



When I opened the door to the basement and saw this, I admit that I froze and stared for a moment. I think my brain was trying to process it but was having issues. Then I reached for my cell phone and dialed 911.



I was unable to explain the scene before me so I had told them to send the police and ambulance. They ushered me out of the house as soon as they saw my dad and I had to be checked by EMT just in case even though I told them I had found him that way and had not went down in the basement. 



I overheard an EMT say that my dad had a very weak pulse when they arrived but within seconds had faded away. This led me to believe that those few moments in the doorway my father was alive still and I had watched him die. 



They questioned me and I explained my side of events and they seemed to accept it. Maybe my shock was so apparent they couldn’t believe I had anything to do with it. They asked about the rats and I told them I had no idea because he had never told me about a rat problem and when I had lived there a few years back we never had any issues with them. 



We were all confused by the rats but the officers said they would keep trying to look into it. It doesn’t make any sense to me. My dad was a well liked guy by his friends though like me he didn’t have many. He was helpful and kind and loving and always tried his best to be a good decent person.



Many thoughts about what happened came to mind. Maybe he hurt himself trying to exterminate the rats himself but Autopsy stated everything was in working order. Even his tox screen was clear so he wasn't drugged and left there by someone. It’s like he just laid down and let the rats consume him.



“Here, eat this and then get dressed. We are going to your dads.” Elizabeth said, showing a plate full of food in my hands. It was Chicken strips, mashed potatoes, mac-n-cheese, and green peas. It was my favorite dish she used to make for me. I realized that I had been neglecting to eat and was absolutely starving. 



I ate rather quickly and then went to my closet to see what I had clean to put on. A pair of jeans and a white t-shirt were all I had, I needed to wash my clothes. I grabbed the pile on my floor and took them out to my washer which was in my kitchen by the back door. I tossed them in with a detergent pod and closed the lid, then hit start. 



Elizabeth was sitting at the island between the kitchen and living room still eating her food. I sat on the couch to wait patiently for her to finish. I had always been a fast eater while she took her time to enjoy her food. It aggravated her to no end how fast I would finish but eventually she seemed to stop caring and just focused on her own food.  



As I was waiting I pulled out my phone to look at memes and videos on YouTube. Elizabeth walked over after a few minutes and started watching over my shoulder. We both snickered at the jokes we were seeing and shared a moment of familiarity as we used to sit and watch together as a couple. 



I exited the app and when I did I heard Elizabeth suck in a breath. I looked at her wondering why, “You okay?” I asked.



“Just figured you would have changed that by now.” she said kind of flipping her auburn hair over her shoulder. 



I looked down at my phone and then I understood. I still had her picture as the background on my phone. I had never bothered to change it after the split. I guess I had other things on my mind or something. I mean I did miss her but I wasn’t staring at her picture every day pining over her or anything like that. It just never occurred to me. 



“I just never thought about it. I’m sorry. I will try to find a new one later and change it.” As I said it I knew I probably wouldn’t anytime soon. I rarely used my phone other than a quick text or call and occasionally funny videos. I liked my computer better. I wondered if I had changed the background on it though? I would need to check later and not around Elizabeth so she wouldn’t be uncomfortable if it were still her too. 



“Well, are you ready to go, Felix?” She asked, taking a step towards the door. I shrugged but stood up and followed her out. 

“We can take my car or yours, doesn’t matter to me.” She said, pulling her keys out. I nodded and headed to her car, better to let her drive in case I had a mental breakdown.



The car ride was quiet and tense. She seemed to want to say something but couldn’t bring herself to it. I didn’t know what to say so I just didn’t say anything. I knew eventually one of us would break and talk about it but now wasn’t the time to bring up the past.



Dads house looked exactly the same. Front porch was clean with the chairs sitting up against the rails on the right forming a semi circle to group up and talk. The front door was closed, he never replaced the screen door after I accidentally put my head through it one Christmas, but the hinges still remained. 



Crime scene and police tape still remained marking off the perimeter of the house. Some was wrapped around the porch railing but it didn't extend across the walkway. I wondered if I was supposed to remove it or if they still needed it there. 



We walked up to the front door and I fumbled with my keys looking for the right one. Elizabeth watched I guess ready to take the keys if needed. I inserted it into the lock, turned it, and pushed the door open. The dark hallway was all that greeted us. 



I stepped in with Elizabeth right on my heels and walked through until I came to the kitchen at the end. Everything looked the same as always, clean, organized. If you saw this house you would never ever believe that it had a rat problem. Yet, it did, apparently. 



The basement door was next to the pantry in the kitchen. I used to get the two mixed up when I was real young. Dad eventually tied a red string around the pantry door so I would know which one. He worried I would go play down there and get hurt and he’d never know. 



He never told me to stay out of the basement or that I couldn’t go down there. It just seemed implied to me growing up and so I never went in there. I guess he could have had a rat problem and just never told me. He could have had a sex dungeon in there and I never would have known it. Doesn’t matter now though. 



I stared at the door and remembered coming over that night. He still wasn’t answering my calls and I was worried. The front door was unlocked when I got here and his truck was outside so I knew he was home. I made my way through every room in the house, even the closets and pantry before I decided to check the basement. I had never been in there so I didn’t know what to expect. I opened the door and the kitchen light illuminated the scene for me. 



I didn’t want to see it again. Here I was at the door, hand on the handle, telling myself to go in again. He’s not there anymore. I reminded myself but still I could not move to turn the knob. I dropped my hand down to my side and turned to Elizabeth. 



Without a word she nodded and opened the door. 



There were bloodstains on the bottom of the stairs and floor. Blood smeared on the walls from where the rats had been soaked and scurried past leaving streaks. Elizabeth hit the switch on the wall to turn the light on. Looking across the room everything had traces of blood from all the rats. 



I saw a few rats scatter with the light but not nearly as many as when dad had been laying there. Other than all the blood most of the room was bare and untouched. The entire room appeared to be made of concrete. 



Slowly I ventured down into the room looking around trying to understand why my dad would have been in here to begin with. A desk and a very large cabinet were against the back wall. I walked over and looked in the desk but it was empty. I supposed the police may have taken anything in it but it probably wasn’t helpful since they still didn’t know why my dad laid down and died by rats. 



Elizabeth cracked open the cabinet. Inside there were a few jackets with new tags on them. Two were very formal looking while the other three were kind of plain tan coats. She ruffled through them while I turned back around to look at the door. 



I felt something nudge my foot and knowing about the rats I instinctively stomped and the same screech as before echoed through the basement. It still sounded like a very stretched out version of my name. 

“Feeeeellllllllllliiiiiiiiiiiixxxx” 



“What the fuck?!” I cried out.



 Elizabeth was startled by the noise and my outburst she pulled the coat she was looking at from its hanger. A sheet of paper fluttered out of its pocket. 



“Why does it sound like that?” She asked as I raised my foot back up. The rat went silent, shook, then took off running across the room to a hole beneath the stairs. Now I knew where they were going at least. 



She picked up the paper and stared at it oddly. I walked over to look too and saw that it was a piece of notebook paper. It said: Meat The Rats in very curly letters. Next to it was a penned doodle of a rat. 



She hung the coat back up and headed up stairs. I followed slowly looking behind me at the empty space. She hit the light switch when I was halfway up and the room went black. I heard a low rumble and suddenly the room was filled with little white eyes all staring at me. 



My stomach turned and I reached for the door knob to steady myself. I pulled wrong and shut the door. Panic consumed me as I realized this could have been my fathers fate. The stairs below me rumbled as little feet pounded against them. Their eyes swarmed towards me, I could not move or breathe. 



I was frozen in a terror of my own mistake. They all squeaked in unison, I swear it sounded like my name. “Feeeeeeeelllllliiiiixxxxxx”



Elizabeth ripped the door open and grabbed me by my shirt, yanking me back out of the room. I stumbled and fell out of the way as she shut the door behind me. My heart was racing still and I was trying to understand what just happened. Why did I freeze? Why are they saying my name when they squeak? Am I going crazy?



Elizabeth basically dragged me home and into bed. She said she heard them too and agreed it sounded like they were saying my name. She said I’m not crazy yet but we need to get an exterminator out there quick before the rats get worse. We kept the odd paper but it doesn’t have much to go off of. There’s nothing else written on it. 



I called an exterminator this morning. He said he would head over and check it out then call me back. That was 6 hours ago and I called his main office. They said they hadn’t heard from him either. Elizabeth wants to go check at dads house but I don’t know. I don’t want to see another crime scene but I don’t want to be the reason for one if I can help it.
