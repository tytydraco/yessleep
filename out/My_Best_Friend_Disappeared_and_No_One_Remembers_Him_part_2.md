Hi everyone, I want to thank those of you that reached out with suggestions. One comment in particular lead to something very strange which I’ll get into with this update.

Many dm’s suggested the obvious, checking Masons social media accounts. I checked the usual suspects of course, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter (still not calling it X), TikTok, and Facebook. The name “Mason Elliot” unfortunately yielded no results, and the same when it comes to his parents names. He never talked about any extended family or relatives so even on that front I’ve hit a wall. 

While none of the social media leads panned out one suggestion did. When I moved here from Illinois I had gotten a Polaroid camera, I thought it would be fun to take pictures on the drive to Michigan and kind of catalogue cool sights as we passed them. Turns out its hard to do that when you fall asleep an hour into the drive from Dixon, for reference the drive was five and a half hours. Regardless, I decided to use the camera with Mason during the spring and summer. I went through some shoe boxes I had converted into memorabilia boxes and much to my surprise I had still had them. A handful I had given to Mason because he seemed more attached to them than I was but there were a few that I held onto. I flipped over a picture and just as quickly let it fall back into the box, I felt my head start to spin. The photo was of Mason, myself, and another classmate. I couldn’t remember the occasion or where we were but I knew who was originally in the photo, Mason no longer stood in this photograph. I remember the photo, he wore a pink pull over hoodie and had his arm draped over my shoulder but now there was nothing. The other pictures weren’t as conclusive so I decided to check the only other capsule that held any memory of him and started going through my phone. Picture after picture that blank space was left like an eerie stain on every single photo, Mason was gone from everything. As I stared longer at the photos a seed started to sprout in my mind, I realized that something or someone was trying to make me forget my friend but there was the problem, why could I still remember?

Against my better judgement I decided to approach my parents with the issue and I should’ve expected the response.

”Sam are you feeling alright champ?” my dad scoffed not hiding the heaping dose of judgment the encompassed the question.

”Sweetheart, I’m sorry i dont know.” Mom had at least the perception of concern which warmed me slightly.

”What do you mean am I feeling alright, there is a whole person missing from my god damn picture.” I had been trying my best to explain what was going on but they still stared at me like I was speaking an entirely different language.

”Mason Elliot, my best friend Mason who we met when we moved here. His mom and dad came over for dinner a week after we all got settled.” I was gradually losing my patience and was studying every movement of their faces hoping to catch them in a lie and finally have an answer for all of this.

”Sam I we have never met a family with that name, we didn’t even host a dinner until well after a couple months of moving in and when we did it was the Mr. And Mrs. Murdock who don’t have any children.” I could tell my dads patience was just as thin as mine was and I decided to leave it at that.

After school yesterday I stopped at the baseball fields and sat for a while, I think everything finally hit me and I started to cry for the first time since Mason vanished. I miss my friend, you go from having someone with you everyday to being alone which I felt now more than ever. I wonder if I’ll ever hear from him or see him again, if he’ll show up at my door again and just play if off as one big practical joke, even now something is eating away at me whispering “Things are changing and it will never be the same.” I am not one for change, moving here took a lot out of me. I had to uproot my life without a choice and start over because that’s what my parents decided was best. I sat on the bench staring at home plate imagining Mason again.

”Mr. Parker I never took you for a baseball guy.” A steady but stern voice came from behind me, I turned fast knocking my bag off the bench and spilling it out onto the grass. I stared up at the man before diving for my bags contents.

“Sorry officer I didn’t know you were there.” law enforcement usually made me uncomfortable but with the very few interactions I had with the MHPD I have to say I felt safe. 

“Please, I told you Mr. Keegan is fine.” The man replied, Mr. Keegan lived two houses down from us and worked at the police department, I almost didn't recognize him in his uniform. I allowed a cautious laugh to escape and started for my stuff, Mr. Keegan knelt down to lend a hand but stopped when his fingers found the Polaroid.

”This the Felder boy? Oh what’s his name..”, he asked

”Braden” I said shorty reaching out for the photo but surprisingly he pulled back.

”Didn’t realize you two were friends, good to branch out and meet new people.” He said, I realized he wasn’t looking at the photo anymore. Instead he had steadied his gaze on me.

”I wouldn’t call us friends, just someone I met through Mason.” I said cautiously.

”Mason? I don’t think I know a Mason. Is he the one who took this picture?” He waved it tauntingly at me.

I wasn’t sure but this started to feel like a soft interrogation, why was he asking so many questions about Mason when no one else seemed to know who he was anymore. I just wanted my picture back and go home.

”No you probably don’t, just a friend of mine. I should get going before my mom starts to wonder.” I said grabbing the rest of my stuff.

Officer Keegan stared at me intently as I stood up, and stopped me before I could grab my bike.

”Hey Sam, we’ve been getting some calls about a couple kids loitering around the baseball fields and smoke stacks after school hours which is actually why I'm here. Just watching out for any trouble when I saw you, just make sure you guys keep moving when you come through here and we won’t have any issues. Understood?” He stood over me with his hands on his hips.

”Yessir I’ll do that from now on, sorry.” He handed me the picture and I turned to get on my bike when I stopped.

”When did you say you got that call?” I asked, anxiety started to shiver through my body and I felt myself start to vibrate.

”Pardon?” He said, almost as surprised as I was that I had said anything.

”The call about the couple of kids, when did you get that?” I was not turned towards him relying solely on my bike to keep me upright, I felt a pit form in my stomach.

”A couple days ago, said it was a little after the high school let out. Just keep that in mind next time you’re on your way home.” He said almost dismissively.

I mounted my bike and headed for the exit to the fields, I looked back to see Officer Keegan staring at me as I left. Only one thing swam around my head as I pushed down on the pedals hard, if he didn’t know who Mason was then why did he say you guys.

I spent the rest of the evening with that single thought swimming around my head, I had never seen any other kids around there after school and if Mason and I had been doing that for months why just now was there a complaint? How could Officer Keegan remember there were two kids and not just one? Something was seriously off about that exchange right, or was I just hypersensitive in an already weird situation. I don't know, I don’t think it will let me add images to posts here but I’ll try to figure out a way to link an image to the Polaroid so people can see that im not crazy. If you’re here from my last post thanks for checking back, it’s nice to feel like im not alone in this.
