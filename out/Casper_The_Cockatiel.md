When I was 16, my mother gifted me a stunning cockatiel. Its feathers bore a striking blend of white and gray, resembling a ghost. Thus, he earned the name Casper. As someone with few friends, having Casper provided solace and the companionship I was lacking in life. I made it my personal mission to teach Casper words, and he quickly learned to say my name, Carter.

After a few months of patient effort, Casper mastered it, rewarded with a grape each time he successfully squawked my name. Over the next couple of months, he also learned to address my parents as 'Mom' and 'Dad'. Every afternoon, after returning from school, I'd be greeted with a cheerful 'Carter'. In return, I would give him a grape. Similarly, upon my parents’ return from their outings, they'd be welcomed with endearing calls of 'Mom' and 'Dad'. Everything went well, and I taught him more words over the next few years.

When I was 18, I got a girlfriend named Skylar. She was my first romantic relationship. We hung out almost every day. I still made time for Casper, just not as much as I once did. He eventually picked up on Skylar’s name as well. After two years, Skylar and I moved in together. She had a pet Siamese cat named Rice.

Rice and Casper did not get along at all. They would fight and fuss at each other non-stop. Rice even left a scratch mark on Casper’s belly that scarred. Casper refused to say Rice’s name. The cat had a deep hatred and fear of Casper.

This is where things got scary and downright unsettling. When I was 22 years old, I found out Skylar and I were expecting a baby. We were so excited. We kept the gender a surprise for ourselves and did not want to pick out a name until the day of the baby’s birth. When Skylar was seven months pregnant, her mother came to visit. Rice and Casper were fighting as always. When she walked in, Casper flew out the door and away. I chased him but couldn’t catch up. We searched all day to no avail. We called his name and left grapes everywhere. We put up posters, but no one could find him.

Five months passed, and Skylar gave birth to our beautiful baby boy Raymond, who is now three months old. As we were enjoying an evening playing with our son, we heard Rice start freaking out uncontrollably by our back sliding glass door. Skylar told me to go check out what was happening. So I did. I heard tapping on the glass. When I pulled the blind, to my amazement, it was Casper, with the same stomach scar and everything. I opened the door, and he flew inside and around the apartment before landing on a counter. He looked at me and said, “Carter.” He looked over at my wife and said, “Skylar.” He looked at Rice and screeched, then finally looked at my son and said, “Raymond.”

I had refused to get rid of his old cage just in case we found him one day. So after spending time with him for the rest of the evening, I put him in his cage to sleep. The rest of the night, Rice hid and cried. After we put Raymond to sleep, Skylar and I went to lay down. The next morning was the worst day in my life. It has haunted me ever since. My son did not wake up. Sudden infant death syndrome. 6 months have passed and a disturbing thought about that night has crawled into my mind. This one question has kept me up for hours now and is the reason I’m writing this:




How did Casper know Raymond’s name?
