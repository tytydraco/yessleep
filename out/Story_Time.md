Mom and I have just finished dinner. Nothing beats a good home-cooked meal. I have this itching feeling that there’s something special about tonight, something about today’s date. I can’t quite remember what…

We’re almost done washing the dishes when we hear two soft knocks coming from the door next to the kitchen. I stop and look at the door, and so does Mom. Mom says we’re safe as long as the door is locked. I don’t know what she means. Somehow, I don’t find it strange enough to ask. Anyway, time to go to bed…

Mom is brushing my hair and singing to me. She suddenly becomes quiet and stares at the bedroom door. After some time, she resumes her singing and brushing. I ask, “Mom, what is it?” She doesn’t answer me. “All done!” is what she says with a smile, after brushing my hair some more and tying it into a braid. We go to sleep…

During the night, I get up to drink some water and sneak a peek at the locked door. I see it wide open. Inside the room stands a small child… almost an infant. It’s hard to tell in the darkness whether it’s a girl or a boy. I call Mom and suddenly she’s right behind me. She says she sees it too. The infant is far too small to be standing so straight and still. Mom grabs my hand, takes me to our bedroom, and tells me to go to sleep. I can hear a soft thudding sound. It almost sounds like… It almost sounds like a heartbeat. A child’s heartbeat…

“Don’t open your eyes until morning, no matter what you hear. It will be over by then.” I lie in bed with my eyes shut tight. Mom is lying next to me. The heartbeat sound gets louder. Mom hugs me from behind and whispers in my ear, melancholically, “I just want the baby to stop kicking. It hurts when it kicks. Maybe if I rest long enough, it will stop.” The heartbeat sound is getting louder.

I am too scared now. I am crying with my eyes still shut. There is something wrong with Mom…

The heartbeat stops all of a sudden. It’s very quiet now.

Minutes have passed. Suddenly I can hear someone whimpering in the corner of the room. Mom holds on to me tighter. Mom says in a quivering voice, “It’s here.” I want to open my eyes. I want to get up from my bed and run. 

As I am about to open my eyes, I feel her hands around my eyes. “Go to sleep,” she whispers. The whimpering sound is coming right from the headboard of my bed now. I call out to Mom. No answer. I want to open my eyes. I want to get up from my bed and run. 

I don’t know how long it’s been now. I can feel tears rolling down my cheeks. Mom is still holding my eyes shut from behind. “Go to sleep,” she whispers again. The whimpering sound is unbearable now. I can hear it right next to my ear. I know, whatever’s making that sound is hanging from the headboard of my bed. I feel like it’s about to scream into my ears any second. I want to open my eyes. I want to get up from my bed and run.

“Go to sleep”…

As I begin drifting off to sleep, I remember:
It’s on this date every year “Mom” comes to visit me. 

But… I bought this house seven years ago. I’ve never had a family. I’ve always lived alone. 
Then who… who is the woman lying next to me?

It’s such a beautiful morning. I had a good day yesterday. After a long day of socialising at the party, I finally had some time to myself. I cooked good homemade food, did the dishes, listened to some music, brushed my hair nicely, and went to sleep. I don’t remember braiding my hair though. I don’t remember the last time I slept so well. Maybe it was last year…
