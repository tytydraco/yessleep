After that night, I didn’t speak unless I had to.

Not out loud.

I learned fast that sound mattered. The flood carried it. The buildings bounced it around. And whatever was copying us seemed to listen.

So I stayed quiet.

I moved slowly. I drank rainwater when I could. I watched rooftops instead of the sky. I counted the footsteps I heard in the distance and memorized which ones never came back.

The city had a rhythm now.

Not a living one.

More like breathing through a clogged throat.

The first time it used my voice again was two days later.

I was crouched behind the broken tank, chewing on nothing, just moving my jaw because my mouth hurt from being empty. The pipe lay across my knees, heavy and familiar. My hands were steady now. Too steady.

That’s when I heard myself say my father’s name.

Clear. Loud.

From the alley below.

“Papa.”

My body reacted before my mind did. I stood up so fast my vision went white around the edges.

I hadn’t said that word since he died.

I walked to the edge before I realized what I was doing.

The floodwater below was calm, almost glassy, reflecting the gray sky. Debris drifted slowly. A door bumped into a pole and turned lazily.

Then the voice came again.

“Papa… help me.”

It was mine.

Not close. Not distant.

Perfectly placed, like it knew exactly how far sound needed to travel.

I stumbled back, heart slamming against my ribs.

“No,” I whispered, and even that felt like a mistake.

The water rippled.

Something moved just under the surface. Not floating. Swimming.

I didn’t go near the edge again that day.

By the next night, the city felt tighter. Like the space between rooftops had shrunk. Shadows moved where they shouldn’t. Once, I saw a figure crouched on a neighboring roof for hours without shifting position. When I blinked too long, it vanished.

Another time, I heard footsteps circle the stairwell below me without ever climbing or leaving.

Just pacing.

Waiting.

I started marking the days by hunger again. Not because I wanted to, but because it was the only thing that changed reliably.

On what I think was the sixth day, I finally made a mistake.

It was raining lightly. Not enough to fill bottles fast. I leaned too far over the edge, stretching my arm, focused on the drip.

That’s when someone spoke right behind me.

“Careful.”

I screamed and spun around, pipe raised.

No one was there.

The word echoed in my ears anyway.

Careful.

Not shouted. Not whispered.

Spoken the way someone talks when they don’t want to scare you.

My legs gave out, and I dropped to the concrete, gasping. My chest hurt like I’d been punched from the inside.

I crawled backward until my spine hit the wall.

The rooftop door was still closed. The stairwell was silent.

I sat there shaking until the rain stopped.

After that, it stopped pretending to be my parents.

It learned faster ways.

That night, I heard arguing on a nearby roof. Two men. A woman. Real voices. Desperate ones.

I watched from the shadow of the tank as they fought over a backpack. One of them slipped and nearly fell into the water. They laughed nervously after, the way people do when they’re almost dead and know it.

I felt something close to relief.

Real people, I thought.

Then the woman looked straight at me.

Not just in my direction.

At me.

She smiled and raised her hand.

And spoke in my voice.

“Help us.”

The two men froze. One of them turned slowly toward her, confusion twisting his face.

“What did you, ”

She didn’t finish.

The water surged suddenly, higher than it had all day. A wave slapped against their building hard enough to knock all three of them off their feet.

I watched them fall.

I watched hands claw at the edge.

I watched the flood take them one by one.

The woman’s face never stopped smiling.

When the water settled again, the rooftop was empty.

I vomited until my throat burned.

That was when I understood.

It wasn’t just copying voices.

It was learning how to use us against each other.

I backed away from the edge, heart hammering.

Below me, the floodwater rippled gently, like it were pleased.

And from somewhere inside the building, from deep in the stairwell, something knocked once.

Hard.

Not polite this time.

Then a second knock.

Then a third.

Slow.

Deliberate.

Like it knew I was listening.

I raised the pipe and whispered to myself, over and over:

“Don’t answer. Don’t answer. Don’t answer.”

The knocking stopped.

Silence stretched.

Then, from the other side of the door, something said, using my voice again, perfectly, 

“You already did.”



 I’ll post it. But after this point… it only gets worse.
