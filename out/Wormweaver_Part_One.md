“Nice chatting with you, Nate.  And good luck writing the rest of your novel,” my friend said, zooming the camera in for dramatic effect.  “You’re gonna need it.”  He giggles and slicked his gel greased golden hair.

I glanced aside, looking at the pile of word vomit that I called a first draft and roll my eyes.

“Ok…See you around.  What can I possibly do without your help?  You are Aiden the Redacted, after all.” I smiled slightly, trying to hide my true feelings about him.

“Have a good one,” he said, kicking me off the video conference call.  I rubbed my eyes, putting a hand to my forehead and shaking my head.

It wasn’t easy being second banana to someone far superior in every way.  Looks, success, having a wife and kids, intelligence, everything including the kitchen sink.  But for some reason, I couldn’t help but take his advice.  I didn’t know if his constant pompous behavior was just an act to encourage me to work hard a la tough love or if he really was a dick.  Still, I did respect him.  Who wouldn’t respect such a talented and charismatic guy?

Besides, he was still my friend.

I turned to the left side of my desk, picking up an old family photo of my wife, two kids and I.  In the center of the frame was a crack in the glass that gave off an appearance of translucent lightning.

“What a lucky bastard,” I muttered.  After giving a good look at it, I walked over to my horrid first draft and picked it up, sighing and turning my head back to the family photo.

Right in the middle of my train of thought, I felt an itch akin to getting smacked with a baseball with screws poking out.  The itch was localized just below my left shoulder where the socket was.  For some reason, the pain came to a halt at some line below my shoulder as if an invisible fence was blocking my nerves from sensing the pain.

I crammed my other hand up my sweater to relieve the stress, but nothing worked.  The itch only grew worse the more I scratched it.  Rushing to the bathroom, I put on some soothing lotion.  It only hid the pain for a minute before its effects wore off.  At one moment, the affected arm spontaneously flailed around like a nightcrawler attached to a hook.  Before my out-of-control hand could hit my face or break anything, I grabbed it to keep it still.

When it settled down, I continued to scratch at my arm until the area was as moist as the inside of a strawberry jelly filled donut and just as red as the filling.  From underneath I could hear something crackle on my skin.  “It’s the middle of winter in New York.  Mosquito season isn’t happening now, so what’s wrong with my freaking arm?” I wondered.

When a crimson and purple liquid started to stain the swirls on my fingers, I took off my sweater, trying to find the source of the problem.

“GOOD LORD!” I yelped at the top of my lungs.

The surrounding area was covered with clusters of knotted and tangled veins and lymph vessels that flared to the top layer of the skin.  Their network was contorted so much that they almost resembled tree roots.  When I gave the mat of veins a poke, they were as stiff as rocks and beating.  Around the area was a bile yellow bruise that spread to the elbow.  Right between the folds of skin, the fissures were frothing up a storm of yellow discharge resembling viscous lemon juice.  I found my affected arm suddenly flailing around again.

Did I somehow contract an infection?  That has to be the case.  But what could have caused me to get an infection like this?  I rarely travelled out of the country, so I couldn’t have contracted anything outside the United States.

And any illness that I know of in the United States that could cause something like this is way too rare or can be treated with vaccines.  I’ve never did any drugs in my life either and I was certain that anytime I had my blood drawn, it wasn’t done by quacks.  There went the option for blood illnesses or drug side effects.

What exactly was going on?

“I must have injured it by mistake,” I thought.  “Maybe I didn’t even know about it until now.”

My theory still didn’t explain why the appendage kept flailing violently at random.

I brushed the thought off, wrapped an ice pack and bandages around my diseased arm and headed for bed.  If the condition worsened, then I was going to have someone check it out.

\---

The following morning, I woke up with the prickling sensation still present and even more virulent than the day before.  I yanked open the covers and threw off my undershirt.

My eye began to twitch.  The arm was still flailing about aimlessly like one half of a bisected worm.  The bruise had increased to double its previous size, this time wine stain purple and beet red in color.  It cloaked my entire left hand in a patch of plague as well.  The vein mass had spread even farther than before.  A pus white discharge leaked out of the sides of some of the sores near the tangled tumors and underneath the fingernails.  Without skipping a beat, I rung up my phone and called my doctor.  I rushed to the car, flooring it all the way to his office.

\---

The moment I get there, I hurried into the reception and told the lady working there that I needed a doctor immediately.  I was so lucky that my arm didn’t go haywire in the moment and slap anyone.  Who knows what would have happened if security saw THAT.

She directs me to the waiting room covered with a basic white paint job and littered with an assortment of chewed up toys.

Out of nowhere, I felt a wet spot on my sleeve that was sticky like syrup and a deep neon yellow in color, almost matching portions of the bruise in color.  I covered up the area with my other arm, trying to conceal my condition as it grew more and more.  My face turned a deep ruby red when I caught a few parents staring and children crying at my horrid condition.  As a last resort, I retreated my arm from inside my sleeve and covered it in the fold of my shirt.

“Pipe down; I’m not a fucking zombie!” I wanted to say.  But I decided against it.  Escalating the situation was about as good of an idea as sticking a foot in a woodchipper.

After what seemed like hours, I finally heard my name.

The bearded doctor arrived in a traditional white lab coat, leading me to a room with an upholstered examination table.  He promptly asks me to take off my shirt and sit down.  Outside from an affirming nod, he remained completely focused and didn’t show any emotion as he inspected my festering arm.

“Looks like a pretty nasty infection.  I’m going to need to do a biopsy just in case if its anything too severe,” he said.

“Maybe, but what is causing my arm to flail around?  That’s clearly not normal!”

The doctor walked over his tool cabinet and pulled out a plastic bottle of numbing agent and a tweezers with scissors.  “Some illness can cause the nerves to fire up seemingly no reason, kind of presenting the patient with epilepsy symptoms.  But for now, I just need to figure out the root of the problem.  Please hold still.”

“I’ll try.”

He took a q-tip, dipping it in numbing fluid and swabbing my bicep before pulling up a piece of skin and extracting it.  After putting it in a test tube, he bandaged up the wound which left a dual tone blotch of red and yellow.  “Have you ever taking recreational drugs before or been out of the country in the last few months?”

“No, sir.”

“If that’s the case, I can’t be completely sure of what’s going on until we analyze your cells in the lab.  The results should arrive by tomorrow.  For now, I’ll give you some antibiotics.  They should help your condition.”

As I drove home, I started praying that everything was perfectly fine.  I ground my teeth in frustration when I came to a stoplight, analyzing the bandages poking out from underneath my stained sweater.  Right in the cup holder was another image of my family.

“This condition better not be fatal,” I growled.

\---

During the middle of the night, I woke up with a splitting pain by my left side.  I sprinted to the bathroom.  The floor leading to it suddenly felt unusually slick, as if it were greased in cooking oil.  Unseen liquid dripped onto the tile and broke the silence.

I turned on the light and sat down on the rim of my bathtub.  It took a few seconds for my sight to focus, but when it did, what I saw left me slack jawed.

Right on my wrist, poking out right where the left arm met the palm, was a parasite.

A fat, jaundiced yellow worm just sat there, flailing around like a rabid raccoon.  Its mouth resembled that of a flower with teeth.  The inside of its mouth, a horrid puce color, glistened in the light of the bathroom as it chomps at the air haphazardly.  Surrounded by a mountain of skin was an abscess that it now called home, spraying a fountain of pus like Old Faithful.  It slunk in and out of the crater like a turtle retreating into its shell.  Around the crater, the mass of meaty ropes had covered the arm completely except for the invisible shoulder line.  I gave the mass of veins a poke.  The surrounding skin ran a blistering temperature I thought was impossible for the body to create.

Suddenly, the bed of rooty veins started wriggling around.  Small macaroni shapes started climbing down to my hand, tunneling and turning it a deeper shade of gangrenous purple.  The entire area felt like it could separate from my muscle at any given second.  I pulled out a pair of tweezers, wrenching one of the unidentifiable shapes free.  I groaned as the metal jaws puncture the skin, spewing out an orange-white liquid resembling fry sauce.  Out of the new lesion was a small wriggling creature.

A maggot.

I dropped the tweezers and bug in a shock, stamping my foot on the wretched bastard, darting out of the slippery bathroom and searching for my phone.  My body suddenly grew weaker by the second as my arm was chewed up from the inside out.  Glistening wounds resembling spilled grape jelly burst open.  More of the bastards start to slither down to my hand, making it feel like the bones were going to explode.  I army crawl over to my bed stand, now unable to get up at all, only managing to dial the first two numbers before something stopped me.  Giving it all I got, I try to input in the last digit, but my healthy arm just stood still.

Why is my arm suddenly paralyzed?  I know I wouldn’t hesitate to call for help in a situation like this!  What gives?

“SOMEBODY HE-“ my mouth fills up with the wriggling insects, silencing me before I could cry for help.

I get an email notification from my phone.  It was from the lab, confirming the biopsy yesterday afternoon.

They said that the entirety of the sample-skin, muscle, veins and everything, was made up of fragmented maggot DNA and cells only made up of neuron tissue.

And human DNA that wasn’t my own.  All the DNA in my cells were replaced with someone else’s.

I blink a few times, wondering if this is some kind of joke.  When I look at my infected arm, I think otherwise.  Was my body attacking my limb?  No, that doesn’t explain the maggots and the foreign human DNA.  Even then, how did the other human DNA even get there in the first place?

I pound a fist at the ground, trying to send an email to my friend, asking him to help.  Once again, my hand just froze in place.  The parasites were controlling me.  But what was going on with the parasites moving down to my hand?

My left arm exploded with pain and I try to scream once again, only for the maggots to fill my mouth and silence me once again.  Then, I heard tearing.  Followed by crunching and a noise that I can only describe as wet, sloppy chewing.  My arm began to separate from my shoulder, ripping the side to chunks; the worms start to poke out of the new cavity, forming tentacles that grip onto the floor and push away my arm from its socket.  The vessels begin to snap sending rancid blood all across the carpet.  Nerves are torn off, their ends exposed to the air like spaghetti improperly set into a pot of boiling water.  The muscles tear off like raw steak in the jaws of a hungry lion.

CRUNCH!

My humerus separates from my upper torso in a bloody, gangrenous contortion.  Hoisting myself up, I gently grab the bundles of nerves and vessels, stuffing them back in.  I wince as I try to push each of them back in.  Weak from the blood loss, I only managed to scoot myself up an inch.  My stomach began to turn as maggots poke out from the separated limb, crossing the floor like an octopus on the seabed, pushing away the carpet fibers and coating it in bodily fluids and slime.

My eyes widened as I witnessed it moving towards the living room.  I swallowed a wad of saliva, having completely given up at trying to call for help.  Those worms were just going to gag me again if I protest.

I thrashed my head to the left; a window right by my couch had suddenly broken.

“This can’t be happening…” I say to myself.  Five rotten fingers grip onto the side of the window, separating the fingernails from the beds.

Another arm.

Through the pain, I amble over towards the window, hopelessly trying to stop the intruder from entering.  As I expected, legs and remaining arm seize up, forcing me to sit behind as the legion of invertebrates plop down with a splat and flounder around.  The muscle and fat of the severed arm jiggles around like eggplant jelly.  The worms continue to guide the arm into the center.

CRASH!  Another window is left splintered, this time coming from my bedroom.  Five separate things, fleshy things, thud to the hardwood floor and slither around.  When I look down the corridor, being pulled like a carriage attached to a troop of millipedes, was a human torso, a rolling head, and two severed legs moving like caterpillars.

As they get closer to me, I can see several tattoos shine in the light on the torso.  Upon closer inspection, I see that it came from an extremely muscular man with a six-pack.

The parasites must have infected another person.  But why?

The head resembles that of a woman and clearly did not match with the abdomen.

All at once, the assortment of mismatched body parts all come together.  Parasites link between each of the joints and connecting them together with a wet, moist snap.  Muscles began to attach to each other.  The remaining worms make webbed formations until the whole thing morphs into one single body.

My remaining arm suddenly slipped as the rest of the parasites burst through my body, pushing away the nerves like explorers pushing away leaves in a jungle.  Simultaneously, worms poured out of my mouth, leaving behind a trail of semen white slime.  I spat the concoction out and wiped my mouth on my shirt.  All of the parasites enter through the anus of the newly formed human and disappear out of sight.

Seconds later, the human’s skin morphed into one single shade of apricot.  The lines between the joined limbs faded away to the point of nonexistence.  All of the head features slowly contorted, erasing all recognizability from the woman’s features.  The tattoos on the chest vanished, getting replaced by more blemishless skin.  After a few more minutes of transforming, his haircut morphed into someone’s signature blonde haircut.

He resembled Aiden one-hundred-and-ten percent.

At a loss for words, I just sit there in disbelief at the situation, taking an occasional break to hold back the pain of my missing limb.  What the hell was that thing and how did it know what my friend was wearing?  What was it trying to do?

“What…Are you?  Why are you…taking on the…form of my friend?” I tried to pipe up while he fished around my drawers searching for perfect clothing for the weather.

Instantly he turns his head around.  My limbs are frozen with fear, so I was in no power to stop him.  And even if I did, what good would it do?  What were those parasites capable of doing to me?  They already took my arm; I know that they can deal even more damage if I dare try to harm whatever the hell that thing was.  He walks up to me, looming over, clasping my throat.

The only response he makes is he puts a finger up to his mouth, smiling like a serial killer.  His eyebrows furrow.

“I want to be like him in every way…Shhh…” he hissed.  When he stopped speaking, he let go of my throat, leaving me gasping for air, promptly sneaking out the window by the living room.  Not long after, I passed out on the ground.

\---

I woke up in a hospital bed with my left side completely bandaged up and fresh.  I hear the sound of a trolley with a blood bag on it getting rolled away.  The sky outside my window was a deep grey, like it could snow at any minute, and an orange horizon is covered by the skyline of New York.  Somehow the clouds were not able to cover the lower sky.

I heard someone call my name.  It was a white capped nurse holding a notepad.  She murmured something along the lines of “Patient…Condition…Stable…”

“You are a very lucky man.  It took an hour for the doctors to stabilize your blood levels and bandage everything up.  No need to thank us.  The doctors said that they have no idea how you ended up with an injury that gruesome, considering the fact that your landlord said that you never left your house.  The cameras were also disabled for some reason, so we couldn’t find any clues to your injury.  How exactly did you injure yourself that badly?” a nurse says.

“It’s a long story,” I said.  “How long was I passed out?”

“You were slipping in and out of consciousness for about two days.  After that you were in a coma for ten days.  It’s currently 8:30 pm.”

I looked down at my side and smile at her.  “Thanks for saving my life.”

Something caught my eye.  The window has a pair of binoculars resting on it.  I set them into focus, searching for what caught my eye.  Blatantly sticking out of the crowd is a man that exactly resembled the assailant that took my arm.  A blonde speck floats by down another avenue.

Another copy of my friend, matching in body structure and differing only in clothing.

Moving through the various pathways across Central Park are three more clones.  None of the clones ever get close to each other as if operating with completely separate intentions.  In the adjacent street are two more.  They all were close to unaware patrons to blend in, walking at brisk but nonchalant paces.  All of them are spaced far away from each other, but were heading right towards New York’s luxury district.

“I want to be like him in every way,” the clone’s voice echoed through my head.

My breath rattled.

I leaned over my bed to a nurse taking notes.  “Get me my phone. Now.”

The nurse handed my phone.

“Hi, you’ve reached Aiden the Redacted’s line!  Please leave a message.”  The dial tone beeped, giving me the chance to speak.

“Aiden, get on the phone right now!  This is urgent!  You’re in danger!”

I didn’t care if he acted like a pompous idiot that would fit perfectly on a marriage reality TV program or what exactly he’s trying to do with that; he’s still my friend.  His grit always inspired me.  He told me millions of times when I felt like throwing my computer off a cliff that I need to keep fighting.  I hoped he can keep up that spirit up and fight off whatever those doppelgängers want from him.

The only use I had at the moment was just a stupid phone.  I didn’t even bother asking for the nurses to release me so I could help him.  The only thing I could do is wait for him to get on the phone while I waited for the doppelgängers to strike.
