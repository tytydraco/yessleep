Hi, guys. 

I was thinking how and where I can share this, and my first thought was about Nosleep, because I’ve been here since NewToTownJam dropped the tale about the previous tenant’s note. So, yes, it’s been a while. I’ve read a lot of scary stuff here, but I’ve never imagined to be a part of one of them.

Before I start, I should apologize for my poor English, since it’s my third language and mostly I read in English, write really rare and never speak in it.

Okay, now to the subject.

I don’t know if you all in your countries have believes about entity, which in Kazakhstan we call ‘ui ieasi’ – in direct translation it means ‘the host of the house’. I guess, it’s a little long title for using it here, so I will call it as Russians call – domovoy. (As postsoviet country we share a lot with Russian culture, since in USSR leaders tried to build soviet nation, but this sovietness had a lot of Russian in its shape and content). 

Domovoy is a spirit, which guards the house and the household, helps to find things like lost keys, may play little tricks like hiding those keys.

I believe in such things, though it’s more of a habit than a conscious decision. Usually, I say goodbyes and hellos as I leave my home and return. Also, I put small treats on a plate on the top of the fridge – it might be candies, cookies, something like this. Normally I find it all untouched and dusty, and just change it to something fresh. Last time I’d left there some dates, and yesterday I found just seeds on the plate.

I was confused, but not scared. I tried to find a reasonable explanation – could it be mice? (though I’ve never seen one and idk if a mouse could climb a fridge) could it be my sleepwalking, regardless that I’ve never done it before. In the end I just brushed it off. I’ve been living alone since 16 and I like the feeling of something guarding the house and me.

So domovoy wasn’t the reason of my bad sleep tonight. At least it wasn’t at first. My neighbors, who live upstairs, are elderly couple, usually very silent. But sometimes they have their grandchildren overnight and that’s when I can really hear everything – all joyful screams and jumps. Normally I don’t get angry, I love children, but the previous night I had a bad migraine and the constant noise got me. I remember I said something aloud. Immediately I heard new scream from above – not playful, but terrified, then crying followed and after some time everything got silent. I was puzzled but relieved nevertheless and fell asleep.

Today I run into my neighbor – an elderly woman of age of 65 or 70. She looked tired. I asked about the night screams. She apologized about the noise, saying things like “you know kids” and all, then said that after midnight something scared the kids, “something black and furry” as she recalled from their describing. I said “no worries” and that was all. Almost.

Because a strange awareness came to me. Right after her mentioning something furry.

Little by little I started to remember that the previous night, while I was half asleep, I was laying with my hand hanging from the couch and petting the warm and fluffy fur of our home cat Tishka. I remember the pleasant feeling of the fur caressing my hand. So cozy. But the thing is that I’ve never had a cat of my own and Tishka lives with my sister in our hometown, which is 2200 km away from me in Almaty.
