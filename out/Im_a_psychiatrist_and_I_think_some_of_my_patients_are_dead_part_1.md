The room is getting hotter. I'm sitting across from my patient, Marko Kovač, and I can see my breath. It doesn't make any sense; it's May, and the AC is off. A cold mist puffs from my lips while sweat trickles down my spine.



Marko is rambling about fire and doors and "finding the only one who listens.", and when he speaks, smoke curls from his mouth. Not vapor. Smoke. Thick, gray, and reeking of gasoline and burning meat.



I am a psychiatrist with terminal liver cancer. I am not foolish enough to tell you my name. The doctors have given me eighteen months. I decided to spend what is left of that time counseling other terminal patients, people who understand what it means to count your days.



But Marko is not on my schedule for today. My receptionist never buzzed him in. The longer he sits in that chair across from me, the more I know something is wrong.



The smell hit me the moment he entered. It was overwhelming. I smelled gasoline and char, something chemical that burned my throat. I thought it was a strong cologne at first. My cancer has made my sense of smell hard to bear.



Everything smells wrong to me now. Eggs smell like sulfur. Coffee tastes like ash. My oncologist told me it is a side effect. The tumors press on nerves and distort my senses.



But this is different. This smell makes my eyes water. It makes me gag. It is so thick I can feel it coating my tongue.



And the heat, Christ, the heat. The thermostat on my wall says sixty-eight degrees, but it feels like a furnace in here. My shirt is plastered to my back. Sweat rolls down my temples and pools at my collar. Yet when I exhale, I can see my breath misting in the air as if it were winter, as if I were breathing inside a freezer while standing in a kiln.



The man won't sit. Marko just paces, his restless hands touching everything. He leaves dark, greasy smudges on the edge of my desk, across the spines of my books, over the glass of my framed diploma.



I asked him to please sit down. He just laughed. The sound was manic, completely unhinged. It didn't seem to come from his throat. It echoed in a way that felt wrong, like it was rising up from some deep, hollow place far inside him.



And his eyes. They look like they contain fire. I don't mean this as a metaphor. They aren't just bloodshot. When he turned to face me, I saw it clearly. There was an orange light dancing in his pupils, flickering like two live embers in the dark.



"I appreciate you seeing me without an appointment, Doc," he says, finally dropping into the chair across from me. The leather creaks. No, it hisses. Like something being pressed onto a hot surface.



"Of course," I say automatically, though my mind is racing. I don't remember agreeing to see him. I don't remember him asking. One moment I was reviewing charts, the next he was in my office, and I was sitting here listening. "What brings you in today, Marko?"



He starts telling me his story. He is a blue collar guy, a mechanic. He worked at an auto shop on the south side for fifteen years. He was good with his hands. He never made much money, but it was enough to get by.



His father just died three months ago. He describes the man as an abusive bastard. He talks about years of beatings and decades of psychological torture.



Marko says all of this matter of factly, like he is reading ingredients off a cereal box. There is no emotion in his voice. Just facts.



Then he found out his wife was cheating. Coming home early from a night shift, he caught her with a neighbor. Some guy named Paul who helped them move furniture last summer. He keeps circling back to that. The betrayal. The rage. How it felt like something inside him broke clean through, like a support beam snapping under too much weight.



"I got drunk that night," he says, staring at his hands. They are covered in dark stains. Dirt, grease, something darker. "Really drunk. The kind of drunk where you make decisions. Bad decisions.



When I try to redirect him, use my training to ground him in the present, ask him about his support system, his coping mechanisms, he cuts me off.



"I don't need salvation, Doc. I don't need therapy. I just need someone to talk to. You're the only one with a door open."



That's when I notice the scorch marks. On the chair where he's sitting. On the carpet where he's been pacing. Black, charred impressions of footprints, like he's been walking through hot coals. The leather of my chair is darkening where his hands rest, edges curling and browning like paper held over a candle.



My heart starts hammering. The logical part of my brain is screaming that this is not possible. That part spent years in medical school and built a practice on evidence based treatment.



But I can see it happening. I can smell the burning leather now. The scent mixes with the gasoline and chemical stench already filling my office.



"Marko," I say carefully, "what happened after you made that decision?"



He stops pacing. He turns to look at me. He really looks at me. For the first time since he walked in, he seems to actually see me. He is not just looking through me or past me.



His eyes lock onto mine. I see something in them that makes my blood freeze. This happens despite the oppressive heat in the room.



"I set the house on fire," he says quietly. "With my wife and kids inside."



The words hang in the air like smoke.



"I wanted them to feel what I felt. Burning, trapped, helpless. Like I burned my whole life for her, for them, and she just threw it away for some man named Paul.



So I poured gasoline in the hallway. I blocked the bedroom doors. I set it all on fire. Then I sat in the living room with a bottle of Jim Beam, and I watched it spread."



My throat is closing. I can't breathe. This isn't therapy. This is a confession. This is—



"I thought I'd go with them," he continues, his voice flat. Dead. "Burn with them. Seemed fair. Seemed right. But I survived. Three days in the burn unit, third-degree burns over sixty percent of my body. They said it was a miracle. Kept telling me how lucky I was. Lucky."



He laughs, and smoke pours from his mouth in thick, roiling clouds.



"And then I didn't survive."



The temperature drops instantly. The suffocating heat vanishes, replaced by a cold so sudden and complete that I gasp. The smoke stops rising from him.



The smell remains, but it changes. There is less gasoline now, and more of a burnt meat smell. It smells more human. I cannot feel my fingers.



My breath is not just visible now. It is coming out in desperate white clouds as I struggle to process what he just said.



He's standing perfectly still now, watching me. Waiting.



"You're dead," I say. It's not a question.



He nods slowly. "Six weeks now. Died from sepsis. Infection in the burns. They tried to save me but..." He shrugs. "But you're the only one who can see me, Doc. The only one with a door open."



I want to run. Every instinct I have is screaming at me to get out of this room. But I can't move. I'm frozen in my chair, staring at this dead man standing in my office, leaving scorch marks on my carpet.



"Why me?" I whisper.



He smiles. It's sad. Almost pitying. "Because you're dying too. You've got what—eighteen months? Less? You're close enough to us now that you can see us. Smell us. The cancer isn't just killing you, Doc. It's changing you. Opening doors. And we can see which doors are open."



He walks to my office door. This is the real door, not the metaphysical thing he was talking about. He pauses with his hand on the frame. Another scorch mark appears where his palm rests.



"I'll be back," he says. "Same time next week. I've got a lot more to talk about."



And then he's gone. Not through the door. Just... gone. Like smoke dispersing. The temperature returns to normal. The oppressive presence lifts. But the smell remains. And the scorch marks. Black footprints leading to my chair and back to the door. Charred handprints on my bookshelf, my desk, my doorframe.



I sat there for twenty minutes. Maybe it was longer. I just stared at the dark marks on my furniture.



Eventually, I checked my calendar. There was no appointment for Marko Kovač. I looked for intake forms. There were none. There was no record that he was ever here.



But I had my notes. A page and a half in my own handwriting, detailing everything he told me. The house fire. His wife. His kids.



I Google his name with shaking hands. It takes three tries to type it correctly.



There he is. Marko Kovač, 43, died six weeks ago from septic shock following severe burn injuries sustained in a house fire. Under investigation for suspected arson and double homicide. Two victims, both children under ten. Wife survived but in critical condition.



I close my laptop. Close my eyes. Try to breathe.
