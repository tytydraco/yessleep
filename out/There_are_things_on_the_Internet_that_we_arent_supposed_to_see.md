Before I begin, I had to say that this is completly real, this is not some story about finding area 51 content or ghosts, this is real.

I wont' actually describe what I saw, so dont worry.

This all started back in 2016, when those stupid videos about the Deep web being haunted were extremely popular, everyone said that if you got into it a ghost could appear, or haunt your house. I was only 15 years old and an edgy teenager who loved movies about paranormal situations so not knowing that this Deep web stuff was bullshit, I still decided to jump in. Probably the worst decision of my life 

For a few weeks, I searched for information on how to get in, back then finding this reliable information was much harder than it is now, so I set up my computer and did all the steps it would require to get in. I thought I was a strong and terror tolerant person, so obviously I wanted to find the "worst" to show off to my kids later, but I never imagined what the worst was.
First, I came across a web page with a lot of links, to different sites, like the outer layer of the Deep web, these sites only took me to not very strong stuff, mostly drug trafficking, nothing out of the ordinary. Until in one of those links, I found a page. It was different from the others; it was completely black, with a red title that said: "The worst of the internet" And below, an index that contained 10 levels, and 5 videos for each level, feeling strong and sure of myself I went to level 10, to the last video that was on the page. 

To my surprise, a video did not appear instantly, I went to other pages, a bit stranger but of the same type. I kept clicking on level 10 all the time, until suddenly a message popped up on my screen that said: "Are you sure?" And two options: Yes, or No. I got some chills, for a second I hesitated and wanted to back out, but my pride made me want to watch it, I wanted it badly so I said "yes."

Suddenly, a video jumped out covering my whole screen , it started a little intro with the title "Daisy's destruction" I recognized the title right away, I saw videos talking that it was the strongest thing out there, that it would haunt you for life...I was happy I found it, but when the video started I regretted everything, 5 seconds were needed for me to turn off my computer all of a sudden. Seriously, there are no words to describe what I saw. It was the most disgusting and rotten thing I had ever seen in my life, I started crying, and throwing up. Those images would not leave my brain, and they have been haunting me for years.
Seriously, if you are young and think you can resist horror videos well and want to seek out this type of content/movies DO NOT DO IT. It's worse than anything you can imagine, it's disgusting, and the worst part? It's real. This was done to someone REAL. And that thought makes you sick to your stomach.
