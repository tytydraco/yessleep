My friend calls me Doctor Arms. My head is lumpy clay colored like a wedding, with bumps on the sides to hear out of. Two tiny black pinpricks, a clown smile, and a ping-pong ball nose make my face. I always wear my smart clothes, complete with a straw hat covering my bald head. My friend adores my doll body and constant smile. He never complains, never sends me away, and always pats my head before sleeping — 7,300 pats.

His granny gave me to him so I could be strong when he couldn’t be. I’m weak as a doll, but I would shake his hand in my dreams so that the next day, I could chase away his problems. Bedtime was spent next to a thing of glass and floating ooze that I would call Lucy Lava. Sometimes, when I woke up, the room would be different — rearranged, re-colored, new windows — but Lucy would always be by my side.

The last time I woke up, I saw my friend alone, smiling with watery eyes. I had been placed on the frame of a cozy hearth. I’ve stayed there for thirteen months. The room I was in was different. Instead of a bed, there’s what looks like a long, furry chair. The walls used to be brown, but month after month, my friend would bring oceans and beaches, birds and fish. He took a stick with long hair named Mr. Brush and used him to bring the outside inside.

My friend loves to make things, just like his granny made me. He takes Mr. Brush and makes a garden, or trees. Sometimes, he just makes shapes and colors. My head can’t make out what my black dots see, but my chest can. He’s painted with the color sad after a long phone call. He’s carved happy circles and angry squares. Even his clothes are paintings, bright and fun. He walks around dressed as joy.

This is how he’s strong without me; he’s frail, he’s nervous, and doesn’t often go outside, but Mr. Brush makes him as strong as I do. I wish I could talk to Mr. Brush and thank him for all his help. Then, Mr. Suit showed up. My friend used to be sunshine bright having him around. His hugs and kisses gave him cheeks redder than mine. It used to be wonderful watching Mr. Suit’s bright color wash through his life. Brighter than my face.

Except it stained other colors. Whenever Mr. Suit came over, my friend would take away his favorite things. Even Lucy Lava and Mr. Brush disappeared after a while. The color is all over his clothes, too. They stopped being paintings and turned into blinding, sour canvases of no. So did the walls. He told me I’m different and always welcome on his hearth ledge, but I could see those looks of ivory fire Mr. Suit would drive deeper than my pinpricks go.

I can tell he detests my vest, my hat, and my tie. He just wants Mr. Suit. He’s turning my friend into Mr. Suit, I can tell. Chalk and pitch bleached away the red from my friend’s face. I realized one day I had been very lucky before Mr. Suit. I didn’t know this feeling. This least favorite feeling — my head is hotter than the hearth below me. My cotton muscles feel like guitars tuned too high. I want to free a larger, meaner Doctor Arms from my cotton skin.

This evening, my friend ran errands without Mr. Suit. He’s an actor walking off stage with my friend gone. With nobody else there, he looked at me with more evil than ever. I thought my hat would burn. He whispered to me, but not so I’d hear. It wouldn’t be smart saying what he did if he knew I’d listen. I know where he’ll be tonight. He’ll walk back toward my little spot to grab me by my frail little arm with his icy hand.

We don’t have cameras, and there’s nobody waiting for him. I’ve been with my friend long enough; I know that people just go away sometimes. I hope my friend forgives me. Hopefully, he knows I’m not strong enough alone for this. I’ll be strong like when he was young. I’m worried Mr. Suit will hurt my friend. But I know I’ll hurt Mr. Suit more. I know his bleach will leave when he does. My friend will be mad at me, I accept that, but with Mr. Brush gone, someone has to put the color back on the wall.
