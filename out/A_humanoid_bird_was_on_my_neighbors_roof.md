I was playing on my Xbox one night. I had a very rough day at the McDonald’s that I worked at so I want to treat myself with some time playing Stardew Valley. I love playing the game as it’s not as fast paced and stressful as say Dark Souls or Need for Speed, just a nice little farming simulator with npcs to interact with. Since it was my last work day of the week, I spent as much time on it as I could before sleeping. That was, until I heard something from outside. 

It was around 10 in the evening when I heard what sounded like a cat being attacked by a bigger animal. I assumed it was a stray that got picked up by a coyote or something and continued my game. It’s sad and all, but what could I do? After another 30-40 minutes or so, I heard another noise from outside. This time it was a man screaming before it abruptly stopped. Hearing this I felt shaken, thinking that some kind of fight had happened or worse. I paused my game, turned down the volume and walked to my window to see what was going on. 

When I looked outside, I didn’t see anything out of the ordinary. I looked left to right unsure of where exactly the scream came from, although I had a hunch that it came from down the street to the left. I was hesitant at first to open the window and peak my head out for a better look, but I quickly mustered the courage to do so. I looked left to see if there was anything going on in the neighboring houses. Still, nothing. Although I did feel that it was eerily quiet. I kept looking for anything unusual. That’s when I heard a faint noise that sounded like… large wings? 

I looked to the house across the street at the far left and what I saw was a shadowy figure seemingly perched on a roof and looking awfully a lot like a giant bird. In fact, it looked almost like a hybrid of a bird and a person. Where the arms would be were instead giant, feathery wings folded inwards. Its body looked somewhat thin like a woman's. If I had to assume, was probably about 6-7 feet tall. Suddenly, it turned its head to me. In that moment I felt an overwhelming feeling of dread and fear. Where the nose and mouth would be was a large beak. From what I could make out in the dark, it looked sharp like a hawk’s. And it had huge, white eyes that glowed. 

All of a sudden, the creature leaped off the roof and flew straight at my window. In a panic I immediately jumped back and shut the window, closed the blinds and ran to my bedroom. I locked the door behind me and tried barricading the window in the room before calling 911. I yelled frantically through the phone trying to explain to the operator what was going on without sounding too much like a lunatic. 

As I waited for the cops to arrive, I could hear the walls scratching from outside the house and the monster hissing and screeching like a predator. As soon as I heard the sirens, the noises stopped and it sounded like the monster was flying away. 

After the cops arrived, I tried to tell them what had happened. When I told them about the screaming that I heard earlier, they went to check the neighboring house. It turned out that what they found was the house resident found dead, seemingly from an animal attack. I didn’t know how exactly to explain what happened without them assuming that I was crazy or some kind of schizo. Thankfully, the damage to my house was enough to tell them that it had something to do with an animal attack, albeit a very strange one. 

Since that night, I’ve had trouble sleeping and have been paranoid about whatever that thing was returning. I’ve already considered moving out and asked my parents if I could stay with them in the next two towns until I could find another place to live. I don’t want to end up like that man it killed.
