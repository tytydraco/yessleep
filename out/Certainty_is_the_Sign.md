(Note To Reader: This interview with my good friend Mr. Turner, happed last spring. In this session we got on the topic of claustrophobia and he told me this story. Here it is. -Dev)

When I was young my grandparents lived in a very nice old country home, just out side of town. It was the mid 1990s. The property must have only been a few acres but as a child I imagined it to be much, much larger. My Grandfather came from a long line of Swedish and Norwegian farmers. His own father was the first of our family born here in America. He would tell me stories and tales of the home land, passed on to him by his grandfather.

The front lawn was perfectly manicured. The side yard that wrapped around to the back yard was also very neatly kept. I rather enjoyed the appearance of their house. From the outside it was very warm and inviting. The Trimming was a soft brown that looked very comforting above the white siding. The front entrance way was accompanied with a flowerpot growing a sunflower that was as tall as me at the time. Yellow as the sun.

The front door was red and had an old horseshoe door knocker. Just inside was the front room and it was very cosey. The stone fireplace warmed the wood paneled walls. The carpet was plush and felt as if you were stepping on a cloud. Soft on impact but almost springy on take off. I couldn't speak much on the comfortability of the couches as us kids were not allowed to sit on them. They were wrapped in clear plastic but they looked beautiful with their vintage floral pattern and hand carved wood frame.

The kitchen was through some French doors in the next room. It was open and was shared with the dining room. They had a very lovely cabinet with very fancy plates and silverware. Past the kitchen was a small hallway that led to a mud room/laundry room at the back of the house. At the halfway point of hallway was a bathroom to the left and to the right was a stairway leading down to the basement and guest room.

They had some interesting old, and very odd things down their. Lots of antiques; tables, chairs, dressers, Paintings, wooden hand carved sculptures; a large grandfather clock. It was a trove of mysterious belongings from unknown origins. The power of curiosity in a place like that is almost debilitating to a child. One day my brother found me playing with Lincoln logs in the front room on the floor saying "Hey" under his breath quietly. "I foun' somethin' on the stairs. Com'on I wanna show you!"

Like the pied piper and the spell that was cast on all the children in the town. I was compelled to follow. The air began to feel still as we crossed the thresh hold from front room to kitchen to hall way and half way down the stairs. It was so quiet. My brother pointed at a flag that was hung on the wall and a sign that hung above it that looked handmade and old. There were words chiseled into the face but they didn't look like English. There were some letters and symbols that I didn't recognize. The flag was a red background with a sideways blue cross and had a white border around the cross. As I got older I learned this was a Norwegian flag from the 1800s.

My brother grabbed the bottom corners of the flag lifting them up to reveal a small door not much bigger than myself. He looked at me and I stared back for a moment before he opened the door. A surge of cold, smelly, old, nasty air waffled out from the blackness inside. We both groan in repulse trying desperately not to vomit. Once we settled my brother said "Climb on in, lets check it out." As I reluctantly climbed in I tried to let my eyes adjust to the darkness.

I scanned the crawl space of the house until I noticed something move out of the corner of my eye and I refocused on an odd looking figure in the dark. It Lurched forward in my direction and growled at me just as the light behind me was snuffed out from the little door slammed shut. For the moment I was paralyzed. Completely strangled with fear. This Thing made a few thumping noise and sounds like something rustling around, getting closer. In this moment I regained functionality of my body and mind and began banging and hitting on the door with every ounce of desperation.

The only two thoughts that flooded my mind was one of certainty and one of uncertainty. I was certain at this point that the sign above the door was a warning in a much older language of some unholy creature from some nightmare in this waking world "Do Not Enter!" The uncertain thought was more of a question. Was this terrible blood curdling scream that reverberated through my ears into my skull and rattling my soul, coming from this unknown horror or was it coming from me?

Unfortunately or fortunately that is the end of the story. The rest of the event eludes me to this day. I had come too, in my mothers arms as we were outside crossing the yard to leave, my brother in tow. I remember looking up at her worried face and then looking back over her shoulder to see the the house. I noticed it was no longer daytime. I donâ€™t remember visiting them in that house after that.

(Final Notes: I actually visited the former property of his late grandparents, a few months back. I met the current property owners and after explaining what I was doing, they allowed me to check out the house. Though it has been renovated over the last 25+ years the overall layout matched the details of the house in the story. Most importantly the little door on the stairs.
