My wife died six months ago.

A car crash. Instant. No chance to say goodbye.

I spent the first month in a daze, wandering the house like a ghost, speaking aloud to her empty chair, touching her pillow just to feel the dent where her head used to rest.

And then… she came back.

Not as a ghost. Nothing cinematic like that. It was more subtle. One night, I woke up to the sound of breathing—not mine. I live alone now. Or thought I did.

I checked the bedroom.

Empty.

But the sheets on her side were warm. Like someone had just gotten up.

That was night one.

Night three, I heard the sound of her slippered feet padding down the hallway. I didn’t move. I couldn’t. I just stared at the doorway, waiting. Nothing came.

I told myself grief plays tricks. Hallucinations. Auditory echoes.

But on night seven, I saw her.

Sitting at the edge of the bed, back to me, hair tangled just like when she used to toss in her sleep.

I whispered her name.

She turned—and vanished.

I didn’t sleep for two days after that.

Then came the dreams. Vivid. Real. She’d be lying next to me, warm, smiling, humming softly. Always the same lullaby she used to hum before drifting off. I’d wake up and still hear it. Like it followed me out of the dream.

Eventually, I started sleeping in the guest room. I couldn't bear the bed we once shared.

And that’s when it got worse.

You see, now she *visits* both beds.

I started locking the bedroom door. Just in case. But every morning, it would be open. Sheets crumpled. Mirror fogged up like someone had taken a hot shower. Even though I haven’t used that bathroom in weeks.

One night, I left a camera running in our old room. Just a basic motion-sensor setup pointed at the bed.

What I caught chilled me.

3:12 AM. The door opens slowly. Nothing visible enters. But the bed *compresses*, exactly where she used to sleep. The pillow sinks. Then a soft indent on the blanket rises and falls—like breathing.

For *three hours*.

I should have deleted the footage.

Instead, I watched it. Over and over.

That same night, I woke up in the guest room to her voice. Soft. Close.

“You left me alone.”

She was lying beside me.

Eyes open.

Not blinking.

She didn’t move when I turned on the light.

But the pillow was indented. The sheet slightly pulled toward her side.

I fled the house. Slept in my car.

Now I alternate motels. Never the same one twice.

But she follows.

Every bed I sleep in—she finds it. Always the same pattern: three nights of silence. Then her scent. Then the breathing. Then the weight beside me.

I don’t know what she is.

But she remembers me.

She remembers *our* routines.

She remembers how I used to read before bed.

Now, the last thing I see before I sleep—if I’m lucky enough to—is a book lying open beside me.

Turned to the last page I read the night before.

I haven’t touched it.

Last night, I woke up to her hand in mine.

It was cold.

But she squeezed back.

I’m so tired.

I think tonight, I’ll stop running.

I’ll let her in.

Just once.

Just to see if she’ll stay.

Forever.
