I'm having some pretty conflicting feelings about it.

We grew up in the same coastal town in Maine, you've probably never heard of it. Raker's Cove was tucked away deep; its townsfolk lived a quiet life.

It was there I first met Tammy.

She had silky golden locks that could make Rapunzel blush. She was the star of the track team, beloved by all.

I was president of the Magic club.

It's a good thing for me opposites attract.

We chatted during our shared classes; she had a budding love for cheesy horror flicks, and we both loved hockey. From there our unlikely friendship grew into puppy love.

Senior year I asked her to prom, and she rolled her eyes at me and punched me in the arm; as if to say, "Why even ask, of course I'm going with you."

She had this navy-blue dress and I wore a matching tux. It was an incredible night; she took the lead when we danced and giggled every time I fumbled. But she stood by me anyway, what a gal. I thought the night would end with the two of us riding away in my mom's station wagon and hanging out by the beach; but when we left the bedazzled auditorium, and I looked into her gorgeous lemon eyes, I noticed-

Well to start with her eyes were usually hazel with a hint of lime green.

At the time I thought it was a trick of the light; her eyes flashed an angry yellow at me. She wasn't even looking at me, she was looking past me, upwards to the sky.

 "Everything ok Tammy?" I asked, arm around her waist. She slid out from my grasp, avoiding my worried gaze.

"It's fine. Let's, let's call it a night. I forgot I had to help my mom with something." She said, her voice low and husky. I stared at her dumbfounded. We were just outside in the school parking lot, most couples had decided to leave early. 

"But we were gonna head down to the beach, meet Brad and the guys." I whined, embarrassingly I might add. In my defense who wants to be the guy whose date ditches them at the dance? She pulled away from me and started moving in stride, her eyes flickering to the sky. 

"I'm really sorry Jay, I'll make it up to you, I had a really fun time." She was halfway across the lot now, I could barely hear what she was saying as she sprinted away like her life depended on it. She said something about texting me in the morning and we'd get lunch.

I was a little hurt by the sudden departure, especially since she pretty much ran off into the night like a loon. I leaned against the station wagon and looked up at the stary night. The pale light of the pregnant moon shone down on me. In the distant woodlands a wolf cried out to it; almost sounded like it was mocking me. 

Of course, we talked about it and her mom explained to me she had "conscripted her assistance" and forgot to tell me.

Belladonna might have been a beautiful woman in her youth, but her face was sunken and her eyes beady and cold. There was a silver strip in her dolled up hair that made her look like a skunk. Maybe that's why she smoked so much; to conceal the smell with rancid tobacco.

She has never liked me, and the feeling was mutual. I remember the first time I went to Tammy's place. Her trailer was tucked away in the back of the commune, lot of dusty plants and exotic looking weeds strewn about.

They had a makeshift porch with bindles of hair and herbs strung together hanging from the rafters. Tammy must have noticed the puzzled look I had and gently explain.

"Ma's really into-alternative medicine." It sounded like a half-truth, but I didn't push it. I'm not one to complain about crazy relatives after all. Belladonna had swung open the ratty front door, crumbling cigarette in her hand still smoking. She wore this extravagant dress like she had just walked out of a renaissance painting-of a carnival.

She had golden hoop earrings that looked like you could hula hoop with. She eyed me, disinterest spanning her face. Finally, she had motioned towards me with her smoke laden talons. 

"Ah yes, so this is the distraction."

It was all downhill from there. 

Meeting my family didn't go any better, my parents acted nice on the surface, but I could tell their disdain from their judgmental looks and hushed conversations.

My grandfather didn't even try to hide his hatred of Tammy, and on some level, I admire that honesty.

Once we were watching a movie in the living room. Some godawful thing we could both laugh at. She was next to me, head on my shoulder as she giggled at the carnage on screen.

"Watch Jay, this guy's about to go into the basement." She pointed at the screen with glee.

"Well, he's dumb, you wouldn't catch me going in there."

"Not even if went first?" She teased.

"Your funeral babe." I had replied and was met with a playful slap on the arm. That's when granddad hobbled in, his head still clinging to the last vestige of his youth. He pointed a frail, boney finger at her and started babbling dementia at her. 

"Git that mangey, flea bitten trash offa my couch this instant, my gawd a grandson of mine associating with the likes of you." he spat at her. Tammy rolled with the punches, and I told grandad to piss off.

We carried on with our affair, despite it feeling right out of "*Romeo and Julliet*" at times. The thing with prom bugged me though, and it wouldn't be the last time. once or twice a month, she would disappear for a day or so.

If our dates ran late, so would she with some flimsy excuse to get away. I grew used to it and would file away the hurt whenever she ditched me. I tried to pry once or twice about where she would go, but she would become cagey and drop the conversation.

When we graduated high school and announced to our families we would be attending the same university in New Hampshire, we were met with apathy and worried looks. I suspect my parents were hoping this would just be a casual fling and hinted I should end it before I threw my whole life away on a whim.

My grandfather had been uncharacteristically silent during their tirade and had pulled me aside after the fact. He said while he didn't approve, he acknowledged I was a man now and could make my own mistakes. He sent me off with a case full of protection and told me to use it wisely.

I hid that case away with the rest of my college bound stuff and eventually set off. College was a blast, shakey and unknown at first but we eventually settled into a routine. We spent breaks together just traveling and seeing the East Coast. We went to Bruin's games, enjoyed a horror convention or two; just living the dream.

She would still pull her disappearing acts at times. Sometimes, we would be staying in a motel while traveling and she would sneak out of the bed at night and wander outside, almost trance like. When I would confront her about it in the morning, she would shrug off my concern and say she was sleepwalking. 

Sleepwalking, once or twice a month.

During a full moon. 

I'm not blind or stupid, just in denial I suppose.

The tipping point came a few weeks ago, she just up and vanished without a trace. It was during the so-called "Bloodmoon," an event that seemed to come once in a lifetime. Really it was just a slightly larger moon with a red tint, but for some it was a big deal. I tried texting her about it and was met with silence. Call after frantic text was ignored, and eventually I realized she wasn't going to call back.

I was freaked out of my mind; I called everyone I could think of no one had seen any trace of her. I called Belladonna and said her daughter was missing and she dismissed it.

 "She will return unharmed, worry not *nebunesc*. I have foreseen it in the eyes of the crimson luna." She was always saying crazy astrology shit like that, it burned my buns to hear her dismiss it like that. I wanted to tell her off, but I held my tongue and thanked her anyway.

Tammy did turn up after a week-at her mother's house.

Belladonna shot me a text that read. "**She returns**." and I hopped in my car and sped towards the Cove. When I saw her, I didn't let her get a word in edge wise, I just embraced her and never let go.

She claimed she had gone for a hike and gotten lost, next thing she knew she was at her mother's doorstep weeping. I pressed her for details and mentioned how the Super moon had came and went in her absence. Belladonna shot me a glance but said nothing as her secretive daughter bit her tongue. Then things got a little heated.

"I'm glad you're ok but you're always doing this, you vanish and then act like its no big deal." I told her. She looked at me with a vacant look.

"I'm sorry." She mumbled.

"I just want to know you're safe, I mean we should call the cops or something-"

"No police." Belladonna had boomed. Now it was Tammy who shot her a look.

"Look I'm fine, stop rocking the boat-" She warned

"I'm not rocking the boat, I just want to know why my girlfriend is out in the middle of the woods for a week."

"My business, you don't need to know every little detail, ok? Just drop it." She spat.

I pressed further and it devolved into name calling and shouting, something I am not very proud of. Belladonna tossed me out the door, and I heard the two of them arguing in Romani or something like that.

Eventually we made up; I apologized for acting like an ass and we moved past it.

In theory anyway, I just couldn't get it out of my mind; this secret she was badly hiding from me. It was like she was flaunting it right in my face, just daring me to confront her about it so she could deny it anyway.

So last night I did something I wasn't proud of.

Last night was the full moon, and I followed her. 

We had gone to the movies, some re-run of an 80's cheddar cheese type. As we left the theatre smelling like cheap popcorn and fizzy drinks; I checked my watch. It was almost 9:30, the moon was covered by waning clouds yet I could feel it's lunar gaze on us. Tammy fidgeted next to me, and her eyes flashed yellow in the pale dark. 

"That was a fun movie." I said casually. 

"Very gory for a puppet movie." She remarked.

"Well, If I saw one of that little pinhead thing walking around? I'd just punt kick it." I boasted.

"You'd try, then slip and fall right into it." She laughed. Her eyes flickered upward, and her face grew red. 

"Let me guess. You have to go real quick? Study for an exam or something." I said. She simply smiled at my faux understanding and gave me a peck on the cheek. 

"You're the best Jay." She said as she hopped off with a skip. I loitered outside the dingy old theatre for a moment. I watched her quickly go down the road out of the corner of my eye, the light from the marquee above quickly fading.

I gave it a moment more and I gave silent chase. It was an odd feeling, stalking my own girlfriend. I stayed a few feet back and matched her quickened pace. She didn't seem to suspect I was tailing her and why would she?

I was dim, trustworthy Jason. Part of me tried to reason with my determined mind. 

*This is wrong, and a bit creepy. It's not too late to turn back, she'll tell you when she's ready.*

The meek voice in my head pleaded. Though it was quickly drowned by a booming, nasty little selfish thought. 

*You've been dating for years now, she's been playing you for a fool. Probably laughs at you on her midnight walks.*

The vain voice in my head rambled on. I trudged ahead, Tammy's mane bouncing as she strolled. Eventually we came to the edge of town, vendors packing up for the night already. There was a little trail that led into the forest,

I knew it well. Sometimes Tammy would drag me on her morning runs, a ritual that he begun recently. She used to hate the wilderness, despised camping. I always thought that ironic, because sometimes when I saw her after her nightly strolls, she would have twigs and leaves clinging to her hair. 

Maybe I am dumb.

She took the winding path with a leap, and I almost lost her to the hungry dark. My eyes took a second to adjust and I followed her into the woods. The trees were mighty and still full of waning green. The moonlit path was clear at first but soon swallowed up by shadows.

Crickets filled the air, an accompanying symphony to my covert walk. I was careful not to step on any sort of sticks or foliage, lest it gave away my position. Tammy seemed to have no such qualms; she was trucking through like a woman on a mission.

The air was crisp and cold that night, and the forest smelled like a new car. I blinked and Tammy vanished from the trail.

*Shit, had she spotted me?*

Was the first thing that raced into my mind. I panicked and looked around, finally seeing a tall silhouette creeping into the brush. I followed as closely as I could, careful not to cut myself on any thorny bush. It was a pain for sure; did she do this all the time?

It reminded me of the hunting trips my dad and grandpa would drag me on when I was young, and grandad could still legally own a riffle. It was thrilling for them, those early mornings into grueling late evenings. I never much cared for it, but I won't fault the appeal.

With how dark it was then, I wouldn't mind donning a bright orange vest.

Soon enough, I came across a small clearing. It was almost picturesque, wildflowers bloomed along the ground, a variety of springing colors. Rays of moonlight rained down upon the solid Earth, and I saw my girlfriend bathing in them.

She was completely nude; save for a gold chain she was wearing around her neck. Her cloths were neatly folded in a pile. My heart sunk, the realization of what was happening seemed ludicrous.  

Then she opened her eyes, a solid yellow glow to them.

Her body jerked upward, her hands contorting in pain. I could hear the cracks from my hidden brush. They rang out in a sickening crunch. Her body continued to contort and warp, her fingers twisted and grew; the skin clinging to them like flayed canvas.

She opened her mouth and a guttural scream emerged, the cries of a pained woman mixed with the hunger of a beast. She rolled around on the ground, clawing at her skin like she had a bad rash. She tore at herself, pulling piles of frayed flesh off her.

Every wound revealed fresh tissue that pulsated and breathed in the night air. I watched as her legs cracked under themselves, her ankles becoming animalistic. Hair sprouted all over her pink flesh, golden strands with a tint of crimson.

Her hands were gnarled and imposing, nails like butcher's knives. Her limbs were slender yet powerful, her chest heaved with each change.

She didn't seem in pain, despite the horrific metamorphous that was unfolding. I could see into her eyes; there was nothing in them but the wolf.

Her mouth extended and cracked into a snapping snout. I saw two pairs of ravenous fangs slowly descend from her gums, bits of sanguine fluid spurting out. Two pointed ears sprouted from her mane, sporting frilly strands of gold.

She was covered in fur now, what was left of her humanity slipping off and falling to the Earth with a *splat*. She sharpened her claws on the ground, growling and foaming as the final change took place.

A nub formed at her hindquarters and grew about two and a half feet. A long tail, it looked like you could club someone to death with it.

Finally, she stood own her hindlegs, panting from the thrill of the change. She threw her head into the sky and howled, that sound echoing across the oak giants.

I stood frozen, taken back by this monstrous form the love of my life had taken. It was the most horrifying thing I had ever witnessed, yet also the most beautiful.

I stepped back, in awe of it. 

***Snap.*** 

The twig rang off like a dinner bell. Tammy took notice immediately and sniffed in my direction. She stepped forward, and her body was incased in shadow. I could only see the glow of her eyes, and the pearly glisten of her rows of teeth.

I could smell her breath from there, like dried meat that had been left in the sun. I could see bloody drool spool down her quivering lips as they pursed themselves into a snarl.

Before I knew it, she pounced at me, and I turned tail and ran.

I could hear her land with a *thud* behind me as she swiped at the bushes with deranged fury. I kept running into the inky night, bulldozing my way past any obstacle. I could feel rouge thorns and branches try and cut into my knees, and I cursed myself for wearing shorts.

Behind me I could hear the snarling werewolf chase me. I didn't dare look back, least I fall prey to the snapping maw. 

The forest had become a twisted labyrinth of wood and shadows. In my horrified state, every branch looked the same and every creeping rock an angry hindrance. All the while Tammy was roaring and giving chase.

She was keeping a steady distance; she could have easily caught up to me if she wanted.

The wolf wanted to hunt, it seemed. 

Up ahead, I could barely make out the trail, and I bolted towards it. I jumped onto it, the perceived safety of civilization. I landed on both feet, a bit of dirt kicking up. I was met with silence then, perhaps the beast had given up the chase.

It was quiet, save my panicked breaths. That soothing silence did not last long unfortunately, as the were-Tammy popped up like a jack in the box.

Before I could react, she was on me. I could feel her claws digging into my shoulders, a bit of spittle from her hungry jaws fell down on me. I could count every sharp tooth she had, and I was staring down the gullet of the beast.

I noticed the gold chain still wrapped around her neck. Dangling in front of me was a tiny gold cross. I refused to die like this, to this ungodly beast. Yet As I looked around me, there was nothing to do, I was firmly pinned down.

My heart was ready to explode out of my chest, and it was all I could do as to not cry out in fear and agony. She let out a thunderous growl as she brought her face down low, as if studying me. In those cold eyes I saw a sliver of the woman I loved.

"Tammy. Tammy it's me." I said calmly, trying to reach her. She made a sharp bark, like she was taken back. I watched as Tammy wrestled control back and the beast slowly released me. I scurried to my feet and put my hands out as the wolf stood there with a heavy pant. I swear it was scowling at me. 

"Shouldn't. . . Follow." It choked out to my disbelief. Before I could say another word Tammy turned and leapt back into the brush. I heard her scamper away, and I called out to her only to be met with a mournful howl.

I limped back to my car, a searing pain in my shoulder. I had never been mauled by a werewolf before, and frankly I don't recommend it.

Eventually I made my way back to campus, attended to my wounds, and collapsed onto the bed in my private suite. I know that sounds callous, but what could I do? There was no talking to her like that. All I could do was await her return.

When morning came, I felt the sun's warm embrace, and a soft touch on my face. I opened my eyes to see Tammy sitting on my bedside. Leaves still clinging to her hair. 

"I'm so sorry. Did I hurt you?" her faze was fixtured on my hastily wrapped shoulder. I sat up, wincing as I did.

"Just a scratch." She turned away, tears staining her eyes.

"I'm so sorry. For hurting you, for lying all these years. I didn't-I didn't think you'd understand." She said, sadness weeping in her tone. 

"I've heard of crazier things then your girlfriend howling at the moon." I said as she sniffled. I couldn't see her face well, but from the ways the corner of her cheeks twitched I could tell she was holding back a grin. I sat up and wrapped a reassuring arm around her. "Look, we can get through this-maybe there's a cure-" At that she pulled away.

"There's no cure. This is who I've been. My entire life." she said. "It's gotten easier to suppress the change. But when it comes, I'm not myself. Not all the time, anyway." I took her hand to try and calm her. 

"You were in control though; you didn't hurt me. You haven't hurt anyone. Right?" I asked

"There were. . .Others-" She looked away, ashamed of my assuring gaze. "They weren't so lucky. I mean, they had it coming, but I remember it; the iron in my mouth, their hot flesh-how wonderful it tasted." She spoke. I was silent at that. "It happened a few weeks ago, when I first-" She trailed off, collecting her thoughts.

She explained the whole story to me. How she had been born "afflicted" as she called, how her mother taught her all about the change.

She told me of her encounter with the hunters up in the mountains, the pack she connected with.

She told me she had ripped through them like butter in her escape, and the retribution she had helped rain down on them.

All the while she was toying with the golden cross she had around her neck. I felt sick to my stomach hearing it all, watching her fiddle with the cross.

"-I left the mountain soaked in their blood. I didn't know where to go so I just, went home." she finished the story as I sat there in silence. She looked at me with hope in her eyes, for any sign I would understand. She took my hand, and I am ashamed to admit I flinched at her touch.

My mind kept flashing to the night before, the horrid beast I had been warned about my entire life. I didn't want to believe the stories my grandfather had told, yet the gash in my shoulder reminded me all too well.

Finally, I spoke.

"I just wish you have told me sooner. Tammy, I love you. Nothing will ever change that." I lied. "What you did, it wasn't your fault. We can get through this together."

Her face brightened and went in for an embrace and wept on my injured shoulders. We sat there for a while in each other's arms.

It was the least I could do, create one more tender memory for us.

I'm writing this in my room, my grandfather's case on the desk next to me. I've been staring at its contents for hours now.

It's a toolbox you see, the instruments of my family trade. I never thought I would have real use for them. My family had tried to warn me, but I was too stubborn. Blinded by love to the monster she was.

Maybe those people she had slaughtered had it coming, I wasn't one to judge. But I was taught that human life is sacred, no one should spill a man's blood.

Least of all a beast.

I examine the case once more. In it is pouches and journals, and a hunting knife with a silver gleam. On the handle an emblem of a wolf being slain by a holy knight; our coat of arms. There's an inscription on it in some dead tongue. Roughly translated it reads:

*"Humanity Prevails Against the Scourge."*

I will do what I must in ridding the world of this blight on humanity. But I struggle to find the resolve, for every time I try, I picture Tammy's warm smile, and the joyous sound of her laughter.

I will do what I must and try and make it as painless as possible.

I owe the beast that much.
