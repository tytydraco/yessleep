I hate my sister, because every afternoon she starts singing in her room without stopping and there is no one to shut her up, no matter how much I beg her to stop singing she doesn't care, so I have to put on my noise canceling headphones that my parents bought me to avoid more fights in the house. I really feel guilty, my parents work for hours a day and it's not like the economy at home is going very well, but they still managed to buy me my new generation headphones.

  
The doorbell rings and as always I have to go to open the door, my sister with the music on full blast does not even know that there is a knock at the door. It's my father Jose, he comes with his stained overalls that he uses to paint and loaded with paint cans of different shades, I admire his fascination for his work. He always arrives home late while my mother prepares dinner.

  
After dinner, my sister and I clear the table while my parents go to bed, they arrive tired from working all day so we take on the task of clearing the house in the evening. While my sister cleans the dishes in the sink I decide to put away the paint cans that my father brought with him to the basement. As I go downstairs I notice that on the basement floor there are some white paint shoe prints all over the floor, I guess my dad had been doing some tinkering around the basement and left it all a mess.

  
When I go upstairs, my sister was already tucked in her room and the house was in complete darkness, so I head to my room to rest after a long day. On the way I clumsily trip over a paint can in the hallway, I was surprised to see that it was a half open white paint can, as I could have sworn I had brought down all the cans my father left there. I head to the basement again to put away the can he had left me, I turn on the light and give a bounce that forces me to back up a few steps awkwardly to see my father ordering some brushes on the table of his tools, as I did not expect him there, I could have sworn I had seen him go to bed.

  
-Hadn't you gone to bed already? I asked him with some trepidation.

  
-Son, I was just making sure I had cleaned my brushes properly, I'm going to sleep now." He gave me a peculiar smile and went upstairs so fast that he bumped into me, spilling paint from the can he was holding on my shirt.

  
-You could be a little careful," I replied angrily without any answer, the truth felt a strange sensation, like that person was not my father, because he was a very responsible and careful man, he had never interrupted his sleep schedule for anything in the world, not even an earthquake would be able to get him out of his bed if it was for sleeping.

  
I leave the paint can, go upstairs to put on my pajamas in my room and finally lie down on my bed to watch Netflix for a while. Suddenly, I hear some banging coming from my parents' room, did someone come in to steal?

  
I quietly make my way to my parents' room, the knocking is getting louder and louder and my heart is beating faster and faster as I make my way down the hallway. I get to the door of the room and see a faint light protruding from under the door, I open it in one swift movement and see my parents naked having sex, I jump back in disgust and close the door as I take large strides towards my room.

  
What the fuck did I just witness, it was a bad idea to open that door. As I get to my room I notice that the basement light is still on, I could have sworn I turned it off on my way out, I open the door to turn it off but I find my father back downstairs tidying up the bins, with a screech that reverberates throughout the walls of my house, I run back to my parents room, I don't care what the fuck they were doing, I'm not crazy and I just saw my father in two different places in my house.

  
I opened the door of my parents' room and the scene I saw left me completely frozen, that thing that was having sex with my mother was not my father, that monster was holding my mother by the neck while he was choking her against the wall. It turned towards me and its facial features were not normal, it had completely black eyes, an elongated mouth that drooled a red and black mejunge and thick drops of blood were coming out of its tear ducts. In the attempt to escape from that situation, that monster approached me in physically impossible movements and everything around me turned absolutely black.

  
I can barely open my eyes, but I don't doubt for a second where I am because of the characteristic smell of paint in the air, I am in the basement. When I manage to open my eyes I realize that I am completely bound hand and foot, lying on the floor and surrounded by traces of white paint. I manage to sit up slightly to sit on the floor and I see how the rest of my family is in the same situation as me, we are all tied hand and foot, but I am the only one awake.

  
I am still disoriented but with a kick I try to wake up my sister, my body is shaking like hell and I feel like I am going to throw up, but I have to get out of here, I have to get out of this house. With a surprisingly deep sigh my sister wakes up and starts screaming desperately, I try to calm her down somehow.

  
-Clara shut up," I whispered even though it sounded like I was trying to yell at her.

  
His gaze fell on mine and I could see his desperate face, we both understood each other at that moment, we had both seen whatever that thing was, he wasn't crazy.

  
The tension in the basement was palpable as everyone tried to comprehend the horrible situation they were in. My parents slowly began to wake up, confused and dazed by what was happening. Meanwhile, my mind struggled to find a logical explanation for what I had just witnessed. How was it possible for my father to be in two places at the same time? What was this creature that had taken his form and attacked my mother?  
Before I could formulate an answer, the basement door opened with an ominous creak. A dark figure was silhouetted against the dim light coming in from above. My heart raced as I watched in horror as the silhouette slowly descended the stairs.

  
When the figure finally reached the basement floor, it revealed itself to be a distorted version of my sister. Her facial features were distorted by a twisted smile, her eyes glowed with a malevolent light, and her skin seemed to emanate an eerie darkness.

  
In the gloom of the basement, we faced our worst nightmare. The doppelganger that had taken the form of my sister loomed over us, its black eyes glowing with indescribable malice. As we fought for our lives, a shadow of fear loomed over each of us, distorting our perceptions and sowing confusion in our minds.

  
The fight was merciless and chaotic. My father, brave and determined, lunged forward to protect his family, but was quickly overpowered by the overwhelming force of the doppelganger. With a roar of fury, the creature threw him against the wall with devastating force, silencing his voice forever.

  
Horror gripped us as we helplessly witnessed the death of our beloved father. My mother screamed in anguish, as my sister and I struggled desperately to survive. But as the battle intensified, we managed to untie our bonds and escape from the basement, seeking refuge in the dark corners of our house.

  
We ran amidst the darkness, the sound of our footsteps echoing in the empty hallways. My mother urged us to split up and hide, promising to meet later and escape this nightmare together. With my heart pounding in my chest, I hid under the bed, praying that the doppelganger would not find me.

  
Time passed in a whirlwind of fear and confusion. I heard the screams of my mother and sister in the distance, but I was too scared to move, paralyzed by the terror of what was happening around me. As I waited in the darkness, my mind filled with doubt and suspicion. How could I know who the doppelganger really was? Was it my sister, or perhaps... my mother?

  
The hours passed slowly, and finally, as silence fell over the house, I gathered enough courage to come out of hiding. I climbed the stairs trembling, each step filled with overwhelming anxiety. As I reached the hallway, I was confronted with a macabre scene: my mother lay on the floor, her empty eyes fixed on nothingness, while my sister towered over her, a twisted smile on her face.

  
Horror washed over me as I faced the truth. The mother I had known and loved all my life was no longer with us. In her place was a dark and malevolent being who had taken over her form to wreak havoc and destruction.  
Heartbroken and soul shattered, I faced the doppelganger posing as my sister. Her black eyes glowed with a terrifying intensity, and her smile was a twisted caricature of the innocence I once knew.

  
In a last act of desperation, I fought with all my might against the doppelganger. Punches and scratches were exchanged amidst the chaos and confusion, as we fought for our lives in the darkness of the night. But despite my best efforts, its strength was overwhelming, and I soon found myself overcome by the creature's overwhelming power. One last glance towards my mother in farewell mode made me notice her house slippers, why were they stained with white paint?

  
As my strength faltered and my vision blurred, one last look of defiance crossed between me and the doppelganger. At that moment, I knew the battle was lost. But as the darkness closed in around me and the world faded into nothingness, one question stuck in my mind, a question that would never be answered:

  
Who was really the doppelganger?

  
And so, in the darkness of the night, the truth was lost forever, buried beneath the shadows of a house haunted by terror and despair.
