There are many small towns in the United States that have some strange urban legend native to them such as Thornton Colorado’s Riverdale Road. Many residents in the hamlet will eagerly explain to you the history of the road, how the KKK used to practice in the woods and empty properties along the road, and how if you drive down it at night you will see the ghost of a woman dressed in white or apparitions of lynched slaves hanging from trees. This is just one example of a ‘paranormal’ local legend, though there are many more. I can not validate any of these, except for one. 

Until I went to college, I had never left the Southern Coast of South Carolina. My father, brother, and I lived in a small trailer home about twenty minutes from the beach. My dad worked as a fisher man, which kept him busy most days of the week, and he often left for work before we would wake up and come home after we had fallen asleep. However, every Sunday, we would go out to the beach and enjoy swimming in the water, and when it began to get late, the three of us would take the airboat out on the creek and either simply enjoy the fresh evening air or go frog gigging. We never had a lot of money, as did most people in the area, but life was always good. But then the tropical storm happened.

To do this story justice, I need to go in perfect order from start to finish, which happens to begin with my dad’s perspective. As mentioned, he worked on a fishing trawler from very early in the morning to late in the night. On this night, like most, he was sitting in the bridge of him and his company’s fishing trawler, sitting in amongst the waves of the Atlantic with their nets out, gathering shrimp. The tide had become more violent than usual as the sun had set, causing my dad a deal of concern. This concern was justified as he received a tropical storm warning through the ship’s radio form the weather service. He immediately called to the crew to bring everything in and get inside the superstructure. He went on deck to help his crew as his skipper turned the boat around towards the shore. When he got outside, he found that the deckhands had already brought the nets in. This puzzled him, as it usually took several minutes to bring the nets in, even if they weren’t full. More strange yet, they had no apparent reason to be hasty, as he had only commanded them to bring the lines in, and had not explicitly mentioned a violent storm. As he looked at his crew, however, he could see them looking out East at the sea, with one of them pointing and trying to yell over the waves. My dad turned in the direction of the man’s finger to see what he was pointing at. At first, he could only see the waves a few yards off of the boat from her lights, and in almost perfect accordance with his turning to look at whatever had fixated his crew, a flash of lightning descended from a storm cloud, illuminating the thing that they were trying to see. 

It was for only a second, but my father described the thing with perfect detail. He said the thing looked to have just risen out of the ocean, as he could make out great falls of water spilling off of its back and head. He described it as a monster, with thick, grey, wrinkled, leather like skin. He described it as hundreds of feet tall, even with its lower half underwater. He said it had four arms, two big ones with with two smaller ones. He said it had ivory claws as big as the boat, and a series of scutes on its back the size of small houses. When he described the thing’s head, his voice shifted. It went from a statement of fact tone to a kind of confused tone, as if questioning the validity of his own memory. He said it didn’t have lips, with its gums and teeth displayed in their entirety. He said the teeth were the size of a man. A tall man. He said it had a set of blue eyes that pierced through the darkness, and in his words, a hateful expression on its face. The strangest detail of all, however, was how its head was almost shaped like a blade. Its forehead formed into a great long narrow spike that resembled a knife, according to him. 

He was stunned, as he literally could not believe what he had seen. It did not make sense, and thus, he could not possibly react. However, he came to his senses yelled to his crew to get inside the bridge. Once they did, he yelled to his skipper to get back to shore as fast as possible. The skipper did not ask any questions, he only increased the throttle and adjusted the helm. My dad then turned back to look back out to where the giant beast had stood as the last deckhand ran into the superstructure. Before the door shut however, the crew heard something over the waves. It was an enormous, primal roar that silenced the waves as it pierced the air. It was followed by a great inhalation of air, and then a steady growl that almost sounded like the boat’s engine. 

The boat began riding the violent waves as they desperately tried returning to shore. The entire time, no one said a single thing. There was so much negatively in the air. Fear, dread, confusion. And then, the boat jolted violently as it was essentially shoved across the water. One of the younger guys let out a yelp and the skipper bellowed in terror. It leaned to one side as something forcefully pushed it aside. My dad thought he was going to die. He thought that the giant beast he had seen was trying to grab the boat and push it under the water, sinking it and surely killing them all, but the boat quickly stabilized and shifted back upright. The thing was just clearing the way as it passed through the water. It did not seem intent on harming them. As he reflected on this thought, however, he realized that the way the thing had cleared was the oath to shore. The beast was heading ashore, where his children slept.

Now, this is my perspective. I was on the creek near the marina with a Junior friend. He had told me that he had gotten a set of keys to his family’s bowrider for his birthday after extensive boating classes. Excited at this prospect, I pressured him into taking me for a ride before the sun went down. However, we got a bit lost along the creek and we were still out on the water despite it being pitch black, with the only thing guiding us being the small lights on the boat and the faint lights of houses along the water. Our troubles worsened as it began to rain, starting soft but then intensifying. My friend began to swear and I simply thought about how pissed my dad would be if he came home and found that I had snuck out on a school night.

It was 12:49 exactly when the beast made land. 

We managed to make our way into the main bay of the creek, signified by a beacon light that came from the marina, as well as one or two other boats roaming carefully through the water. My friend exclaimed in relief and excitement as he eased the boat forward and turned toward the marina. That was when I saw it for the first time. Two blue orbs that floated a good three hundred feet in the air above the beach. I was perplexed. I thought that maybe it was some kind of helicopter, but if it was, it’s rotors would obviously be creating a great deal of noise. The only sound I could hear was the bowrider’s motor and the soft crashing of waves coming from the beach. And then it roared. It sounded almost like a gator at first, producing a guttural growl of immense volume before it morphed into a deafening bellow. The only I can describe it is a grotesque fusion of a whale’s groan and a hippo’s roar, and something else that could not possibly be native to Earth. I immediately felt that the monstrous noise was coming from those blue lights, but I didn’t know how, or why.

The rain picked up in intensity as my friend halted the boat, clearly in response to that primal roar. He followed my gaze as the sound of what seemed to be a distant bomb came from the direction of those blue lights. It was a distant, dull boom that came from a ways away, and was follow shortly by another, and then another. And with each boom, the lights seemed to advance yards forward. And then, a bolt of lightning illuminated the same monster that my father would later describe to me. Its four arms where outstretched to the front of it and moving slowly downward slowly. Its great, blade shaped head pointed to the sky. Its jaw with its numerous teeth still agape. That. That was the source of that malevolent holler, and the booming we were hearing was the sound of its footsteps. 

I only saw it for a fraction of a second as the lightning flashed, but it was enough time for that image to me permanently burned into my mind forever. That is why I remember that time, 12:49, because it was being displayed brightly on the bowrider’s dash at that very second. I don’t want to sound corny, but I can see that image perfectly when I shut my eyes to fall asleep sometimes, and every time that image shows itself, I am once again struck by that same primitive sense of dread that I felt standing there on that boat.

After a moment, my friend began to yell obscenities in a state of utter shock. “What? What? What the fuck?” He, like I, simply could not understand what he was seeing. Any understanding of the world that we once had was gone with that half second flash of lightning. 

The booming continued and the bowrider rocked slightly as a shock wave reverberated through the bay and hit our boat. It was crossing the creek.
We stood, not saying a word, my friend breathing heavily as we watched the the blue lights, which we now understood to be the creatures eyes, move inland through the rain, with the sound of its booming footsteps fading as it went further and further away from us. Eventually, we lost sight of its glowing blue eyes, and we stood for a moment, as if waiting for them to reappear, pivot toward us, and come at us hellbent on eating us or killing us or some other horrible thing, but they never did reappear. Instead, we sat down, and my friend powered off the engine. What else could we do? Return to shore and go home? Why? What if that thing was still out there? For some reason or another, we decided to just sit out there in the creek until the sun rose and we could have some sense of safety.

When the sun did rise, we powered the bowrider back in and returned to the marina, where my friend’s parents and my father were waiting for me. We both were afraid that we were going to be severely scolded and punished, but as we stepped off of the boat, it became evidently clear to us that they had all seen the beast as well, and were relieved that we were alive. As far as we can tell, only a few dozen people, including those mentioned in this documentation, saw that thing in the storm that night, and as far I can tell, not a single one has come forward on the media or online or done anything to tell the general public what happened that night. I cant speak for those other people, but my father and I decided that no good would come out of telling anyone. The beast seemingly disappeared into thin air after the storm ended, and there wasn’t exactly any leftover evidence. The path of destruction that that thing caused as it simply took steps could be explained by the storm, and its giant footprints were likely filled in or misshaped by the mud and water during the downpour. 

There is no way those who saw that thing could possibly forgot about it, but we don’t talk about it, and we just try to push it as far to the back of our minds as possible. For the rest of the time that I lived in that trailer home in Edisto with my father and brother, I absolutely could not sleep whenever it rained or stormed. Instead I would lay awake, sitting anxiously by a window in wait for those blue eyes, hundreds of feet in the air, to reappear. Anyway, I have returned back home for the summer, and as much as I love spending time with my father and little brother, and eating fresh seafood, and walking on the sand, and boating in the creek, I can never feel the same about the small island that I once called home. You don’t have to believe me, all you have to do is come here. And odds are that any one of the locals you may ask about this either knows someone who saw that thing or has themselves seen that thing. I am not writing this by suggestion of my friend, my dad, or some change of thought that makes me want to tell the public about this, but there is another tropical storm warning tonight, and I can’t sleep, and I am of course worried that with the storm, that giant beast will return. I’m putting this on here because I just need to know if anyone else has seen anything like this. Whether in North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, anywhere on the east coast, anywhere on the west coast, even anywhere in the world, I just need to know if anyone out there has seen anything like this. Thanks.
