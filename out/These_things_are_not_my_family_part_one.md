Driving on the highway at 4 am is not ideal but you have to when you have somewhere to be. The lines on the road flying under your car are hypnotizing, putting you in a trance that only you can break yourself out of.  The lights of the dash are the only thing keeping you up. If you close your eyes for a second you risk falling asleep, meeting the heavenly gates. Even if I am complaining about the drive, nothing can beat meeting up with my dads family. I hate almost everyone on that side of the family but as my mom always said family is family you gotta deal with it. Still driving down the hypnotizing roads one thing does wake me up, something flying in the sky. the brightest shooting star I have ever seen. The thought of the shooting star swirled in my imagination. Imagining that it was a space craft with creatures we could never fully think of . Although I know it's just a shooting star it caught my eye.

Driving through the town where my family is from sent memories shooting through my head. Reminiscing of the times when we were one big family. Something was off the town, seemed different, a gloomier mood flowed though the air then it used to. Places that used to be thriving were shut down; the town overall just looked run down. Pulling into my old house I'm met with poorly laid down gravel. The house was not glowing like it used to but it was home and I missed it. My dad comes out and greets me with a big hug asking me how I have been. Since my mother's passing, me and my dad became very distant. Me and my dad talked about the good memories and laughed over it. He started to talk about mom “ Tyler I hope you know how much I miss your mother and I hope you know she would be proud of you.” You know that feeling when you're about to cry but you won't when your eyes get heavy and your throat tightens well. I got the subtle feeling of it but I had to make sure I wouldn't cry.

The family started to arrive at the house. My Uncle Bob and Aunt Gigi arrived. Uncle Bob, a fearful old man, always tries to be the center of attention. Uncle Bob, although he is on his  third wife he is a kind man. Aunt Gigi is a mean looking old lady although she is one of the sweetest ladies you will ever meet. She doesn't like to be in the spotlight but truly cares about Uncle Bob so she will be there for him. Uncle Bob and Aunt Gigi greet me with a big hug. Uncle Bob asked me “So how's med school treating you?” “It's going pretty good. I 've been struggling with some stuff but I'm getting better at it.” Aunt Gigi added to the conversation “So are you still with that girl?”  I cleared my throat not really wanting to talk about the break up so I gave her a short answer avoiding the conversation. “ No, we decided it was best if we part ways.” I could see the sad look on Aunt Gigi's face. I know she liked Stella. They grew close to them while Stella helped Uncle Bob recover from his surgery. It was hard enough getting over her but now I have to be reminded of it. 

I see my Cousin Tom and his Wife Gale walk it but they have an unexpected guest, a dog. Tom yells across the room “TYLER GET YOUR ASS OVER HERE!” in his snobby voice as I reluctantly walk over he gives me a firm pat on the back asking me the same question everyone does “So how have you been.” I gave him the basic answer because I wanted to end the conversation. “Good.” he could tell I didn't want to talk so he ended the conversation  “Well Tyler, it was good talking to you, get back out there, do whatever you were doing.” It's probably best to describe Tom and his wife so you understand why I don't like them so much. Tom owns a fortune 500 company and he thinks he's better than everyone else. Tom's Wife Gale was a stripper; he got pregnant and decided to marry; she's 10 years older than him. She uses him for his money. She wears animal fur clothes and became very snobby and acted like she made him earn his money. Their dog looked like it was straight out of the Beverly Hills house wives, it's an afghan hound with long hair. 

The last guests I knew were my childhood best friends Josiah and Caleb. We've been friends since first grade. We used to be like brothers, never leaving each other's side but had to part ways after high school. Josiah left for the army he just got home from deployment Josiah was the most athletic kid in school but decided not to keep going because it made him depressed. He's the comedian of the group and tries to crack a joke whenever he can. Caleb on the other hand was a shy kid that didn't like to talk much. He recently got engaged to his high school sweetheart Lorrie. Caleb tries to help people as much as he can. A bunch of strangers claiming to be my dads friends came over after Josiah and Caleb. I had no clue who they were but there were so many people I bet they just came because there were people at the house.

Everyone started fizzling out until it was just my family, Josiah and Caleb. We all sat around the bonfire just talking as the ambers faded into the night sky turning into the stars.Tom let his dog out the house for once he was too worried it would get dirty. Well it didn't take long for his worries to happen because as soon as he let the dog out the door it took off into the woods. I have never seen Tom run in my life but he took off. I think he was more worried about the price of the dog than the dog itself. Me, Caleb and Josiah go after him knowing how easy it is to get lost in these woods. We all come to a quick stop standing there amazed. Seeing a crater  at least 15 feet long and 2 feet deep in the middle of a soft sized rock with a sharp texture and moon like craters all over it still red hot shocked us. The dog stood at the edge of the crater barking at the rock. We all stood there perplexed that we were really seeing a meteor. Tom yells out “WERE GONNA BE RICH!” again Toms only worried about money. Josiah stammered “uh-uh what do we do about this?” Tom, of course thinking about money says “we keep it to ourselves until we can pick it up and sell it.”  I stood there completely baffled. “I truly don't know what to do. The best thing I can think of is calling the sheriff." All Caleb could do is stand there with a completely shocked look on his face .
