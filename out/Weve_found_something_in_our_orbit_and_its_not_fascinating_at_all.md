Hello, my name is John Fritz, but you can call me John. I am a NASA astronomist of 12 years and I have a wife and two beautiful daughters. We also have courtesy to our family dog named Pepper. Let me give you a little bit of backstory on my journal that I am writing in as of now.

&#x200B;

Today is March 11th, 2027. I am with my crew studying the orbit of the asteroid named “Oliver-JB10.” But we'll just call it JB. It is about the size of the moon, something which we never seen the likes of before. Possibly the largest asteroid we’ve ever seen, and we might as well consider it a rogue moon or something. It has been orbiting mars since it was a…baby?

Long story short is, it grew drastically in size over the years. It also had absorbed the entirety of Phobos and Deimos, it’s also got a chunk off the asteroid belt, something that has contributed to its massive size. And we’ve been getting many signals from it since the year 2024. My 6 other crew members, Alex, Carlos, Tyrone, Lee, Yasha and Dhariya have been mortified by the way this thing moves. The signals are sent to us every 2 fucking seconds. And I hate to say it, but each of the signals are beats. Yes, **heartbeats.** The thing is fucking alive. And we already alerted the U.S. government of what's going on, but they don't take us seriously.  About what I said by absorbed earlier, yes, literally. No collision, no rupture or blast, JB phases through them, only to come out by itself. This thing is growing by the month, and mars is next. Then after, we're next. 

JB is a round, black and red object. From our studies, it grows about 1,423 kilometers every day for 3 days ago. That's about 1/28 the size of earth, so that means in about 8-9 days, mars will be done for. And in 25 days, we're done for. It's basically a mass extinction event. We've sent one of our hyper energy-powered space probes there, but to no avail. As soon as it hit the atmosphere, it imploded immediately. We counted how fast it happened, and it was 13 picoseconds. 13 fucking picoseconds. It takes us about .5 second to blink, so during the time period of a picosecond, you could blink a couple million times, if I did my math correctly. 

It is now March 22nd, 2027. JB is about a half planet bigger than mars. And mars, it's gone as well. It's headed for us, and now it's visible to the naked eye. It's so damn enormous, you can compare it to a super moon on an unpolluted sky at night in Alaska. The government is now taking things seriously, but there's no point. No good ending, nothing. If you stare at it for too long, then your eyes will start burning, horribly. It's just too far away to reach you as well. A majority of the population have been said to be under psychological warfare, including my wife and daughters. My wife took her life, and our daughters' life yesterday. It's just me and my dog out here, alone.

It is now April 1st, 2027. JB has become so close to the point where even animals are taking the easy way out. My dog is a very strong girl, but she drowned herself in the backyard pool five hours ago, and now the thoughts are getting to me as well. A reported population of 3 billion have been killed off. JB is so close to us in the sky that it covers about 1/3rd of the night. Every minute I think about taking my own life. I don't know what this so-called "planet" does to people, but it's an organism. I know it is. 

It is now April 4th, 2027. I have my revolver in my hand. I see parts of the planet floating up into the air, all planetary defense mechanisms have failed. I don't want to do it, but it feels like somethings forcing the gun to my head. I can feel the ground above me rising as my body feels like it's being ripped to shreds. I take one last sigh as I pull the trigger.

Noon. I wake up in a hospital. To my surprise I see my pregnant girlfriend crying tears of joy, alongside my best friend, Tyrone and Lee. I ask: ''What in the hell happened, where am I, what time is it?'' 

Lee says, "Dude, it's November 9th, 2014, are you okay?''

"Nah, I just had the craziest dream where I lived out till 2027!"

"Haha, you're a good jokester", Tyrone replied. "Also, our letters came in. NASA accepted us in the program!"

I frantically go to the telescope my girlfriend set up for me. I look past on the left of Uranus and, to my surprise...

I see JB.

I hop up from my seat and go directly to my computer.

"Alright bitch, let's see who's planet you're after now." 

I click on the email.
