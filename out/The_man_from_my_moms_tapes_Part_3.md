Before I continue the conversation with my sister, I think it’s important to tell you about the day I met the man from the tapes and how I remembered that day before all of this began.



When I was a child, we moved around a lot because of my dad’s job. I never really understood the details of what he did—just that he worked with the army. I know he served in the war, because back then, military service was mandatory. After that, he studied to become an engineer at the military university and stayed in that career path. But I couldn’t tell you his rank or what exactly his role was. All I remember is the uniform hanging in his closet, crisp and immaculate, like a piece of another life.



Because we moved so often, I didn’t really get to know my grandparents on either side of the family. I knew they had both been in the army as well, but that was about it. Sometimes, we’d talk to them on the phone, but I was too young to understand what those conversations were about. Their voices were just distant echoes in my childhood, blurred and incomplete.



When I was about six years old, we moved to a small house near a base on the coast of Mar del Plata, just outside the city. I loved that place. If you stayed quiet enough, you could hear the faint sound of the sea in the distance, and nothing else. It was peaceful in a way that felt rare and precious, especially compared to the noise and chaos of living in the city, which is my life now.



One afternoon, during my last class of the day at school, the teacher called me aside. She explained, with a patient smile, that my mom had run into some trouble with her car and would be late to pick me up. I nodded, more concerned with getting back to whatever I was doing—likely doodling on a scrap of paper, my mind already far from the conversation.



When the bell rang, signaling the end of the day, I packed up my things and joined the stream of kids rushing out of the classroom. The usual chaos unfolded—laughter, shouting, and the scramble of small feet on the tiled floor. As I stepped outside, scanning the familiar scene, something unusual caught my eye.



Standing just beyond the school gates was Kimmi, our golden retriever. She was a beautiful dog, her golden fur almost glowing in the late afternoon light. She was everything you’d expect from a golden retriever—gentle, loving, and always eager to please. But beside her stood a man I didn’t recognize. He was holding her leash casually, as if he had every right to be there.



I froze for a moment, confused. It was definitely Kimmi; I’d recognize her anywhere. But this man? He was a stranger. My confusion quickly turned to curiosity, and without thinking too much about it, I walked toward them, my small hand tightening around the strap of my bag.



"Excuse me," I said as I got closer, my voice tentative but steady, "why do you have my dog?"



He smiled, and I immediately noticed how old he looked. Deep wrinkles etched lines across his face, and his crooked nose bent downward in a way that struck me as funny. To my six-year-old mind, he looked a bit like the cartoon vultures I had seen in movies. His eyes, a soft, milky brown, didn’t seem threatening, though. They reminded me of chocolate that had melted in the sun, warm and inviting.



He crouched down to my level, moving slowly, like he didn’t want to scare me. Then, he just looked at me, his gaze full of something I couldn’t quite name at the time. Admiration, maybe? Curiosity? Whatever it was, it made me feel important, like I was the center of his attention in a way that felt rare.



“Your mom asked me to pick you up,” he said, his voice calm, almost soothing. “She told me to bring Kimmi along so you wouldn’t worry.”



He reached out a hand, carefully ruffling my hair like I was something delicate. “I’m your grandpa,” he added with a small smile, as if that explained everything.



My heart swelled with happiness. A grandpa. My grandpa.



For as long as I could remember, I had listened to my friends talk about their grandparents—their grandmas who baked cookies that smelled like magic, their grandpas who taught them how to catch fireflies or bait a fishing hook. I didn’t have stories like that. My world was just Mom, my sister, and Kimmi. I loved them, of course, but everything always felt the same with them. Routine. Predictable.



But now, here was this man, my grandpa, promising me a piece of something I’d always envied. So, I believed him. Without hesitation, I stepped forward and threw my arms around him, hugging him as tightly as my small frame could manage.



He took my hand, his grip warm and steady, and led me toward his truck. It was an old thing, the kind of vehicle that rattled a little as it idled, with chipped paint and the faint smell of motor oil lingering in the air. He opened the back for Kimmi, giving her a firm but gentle pat on the head as he told her to hop in. Then he turned to me, gesturing toward the passenger seat with a smile.



“Hop in, kiddo. You get the front seat,” he said cheerfully, like it was some special privilege.



As I climbed in, he slid into the driver’s seat and turned to me with a question that caught me completely off guard. “So, where do you want to go first?”



I blinked at him, unsure how to answer. “I thought we were going home,” I admitted, my voice small and uncertain.



“Well,” he said, his smile widening, “what if we stop for ice cream first? Sound good?”



Ice cream. My face lit up at the thought, and before I could even answer, we were already pulling out onto the road.



The drive was easy, comfortable. He asked me all kinds of questions, ones that made me feel like the most fascinating person in the world. “What’s your favorite game?” he asked, glancing at me with genuine interest. “Your favorite TV show? What about movies?”



As I talked, he listened, really listened. His laugh was soft but warm, and he had this way of throwing in lighthearted jokes that made me feel clever and funny. “You’re like a little expert,” he said at one point, and I beamed, feeling proud of myself.



When we arrived at the ice cream shop, he turned off the engine and looked at me with a twinkle in his eye. “Hey,” he said, his tone playful. “Check under your seat before we go in.”



I tilted my head, puzzled, but leaned down to look anyway. My fingers brushed against something smooth and crinkly, and my heart jumped. Wrapping paper. My hands worked quickly, pulling out the small, colorful package, and I tore through the paper like my life depended on it.



Inside was a Care Bear. *A Care Bear.*



My gasp of delight must have been loud because he laughed—a deep, hearty laugh that seemed to fill the truck. “Knew you’d like that,” he said, reaching into his pocket to hand me a sheet of Sailor Moon stickers.



I stared at them in awe, clutching the Care Bear to my chest. He knew. He knew all the things I loved. And in that moment, sitting in the cab of his truck, I thought he must be the best grandpa in the entire world.



After we got our ice creams, we wandered to the pier nearby, the kind that stretched out into the sea like a long, wooden finger. The sun hung low in the sky, casting everything in a warm, golden light that danced across the waves. We sat on the edge, legs dangling over the side, eating our cones while the salty breeze played with my hair.



It hit me then that I’d been doing all the talking. He’d asked me so much, made me feel so special, and yet I didn’t know anything about him. So I turned to him, licking the last bit of ice cream from my cone, and asked, “Which one of my parents is your kid?”



At the time, I didn’t notice it, but his face shifted ever so slightly. The corners of his eyes pulled downward, and something heavy settled in his gaze. “Your mom,” he said after a pause, his voice quiet, almost reluctant. He stared out at the horizon, as if the sea might give him the strength to say more.



I tilted my head, curious. “What was she like when she was my age?”



That made him smile, though it was a fragile kind of smile, one that seemed to teeter on the edge of something deeper. He reached into his back pocket and pulled out an old, worn wallet. From it, he extracted a photograph—black and white, creased at the edges.



He handed it to me carefully, as if it were a relic. In the picture, a little girl with wavy hair tied into pigtails grinned at the camera. She couldn’t have been older than six. My breath caught as I recognized her immediately. She looked just like me.



“That’s your mom,” he said, his voice softer now, as if the memory itself demanded reverence. “She was always running around, full of questions, wanting to know everything about the world around her. Once, she scared the neighbors half to death because she climbed up to their window late at night to see what they were doing.”



He chuckled at the memory, though his voice cracked slightly, betraying a hint of sadness. “She was a handful,” he added, his eyes glassy.



After a moment, he reached over and placed the photo in my hand. “Here,” he said, his tone serious now. “I want you to have this.”



I looked up at him, surprised. “Really?”



He nodded, though his expression had grown somber. “Keep it safe,” he said firmly. “Very safe. Even from your parents. Your mom loved this picture. If she sees it, she’ll take it from you, and you’ll never see it again.”



He held my gaze for a long moment, his hand resting lightly over mine, as if sealing some kind of pact. “But now it’s yours,” he continued. “No one else has to know about it.”



I clutched the photo tightly, my fingers curling around its edges. His words felt like a secret, heavy and sacred, and I nodded solemnly, promising myself I’d guard it with all the care I could muster.



I don’t remember much after that. Just fragments—how we talked as the sun dipped lower, the world painted in hues of gold and orange, and how, in that short time, I grew to love him. He treated me with such warmth and care, the kind that felt like a soft blanket wrapping around you on a cold day.



I remember feeling a pang of guilt, though. He’d given me so much—a gift, ice cream, his attention—and I had nothing for him in return. So, after a moment of hesitation, I tugged one of the hair ties from my ponytail and handed it to him. It wasn’t much, but it was mine. He took it with a soft chuckle and a warm smile, treating it as though it were a treasure.



Then, the moment shifted. My sister appeared at the edge of the pier, her silhouette framed by the sinking sun. I lit up, waving her over eagerly, wanting to introduce her to the man I’d just met and already adored. “Come meet Grandpa!” I called, my voice filled with excitement.



But she didn’t move. She just stood there, stiff and uncertain, her face pale. And then I saw him—my dad—emerging from behind her like a shadow.



“Go on,” my grandfather said gently, his voice low and calm. “Go with your sister. Your dad and I… we have some catching up to do.”



I hesitated, but he gave me an encouraging nod, his smile steady. Reluctantly, I obeyed, running down the pier toward my family. My dad crouched slightly to catch me in his arms as I threw myself at him, pressing a kiss to his cheek.



“Dad!” I began breathlessly, words spilling out as I tried to tell him about Grandpa, about the gifts and the stories and how wonderful he was. But my dad’s face was different. His jaw was tight, and his eyes flicked past me toward the pier.



“Later,” he said curtly, his voice clipped. He set me down and straightened, his attention already elsewhere.



I followed his gaze, looking back at the man I’d just met. Grandpa stood there, hands in his pockets, the same kind smile on his face, though now it seemed… heavier, somehow. He gave me a small wave before turning his attention fully to my dad.



I didn’t understand then, but the air between them felt taut, like the string of a bow drawn too tight. And though I didn’t know why, something inside me told me to hold onto that picture—and the memory of this day—as tightly as I could.



I never saw my grandpa again. Every time I asked my dad about him, he’d just smile tightly and say he’d call him to see if he could visit. But even as a kid, I knew that call was never going to happen. When I asked my mom about her dad, she’d only say he was a “good man” and quickly change the subject. It was clear they didn’t like him—neither did my sister. That’s why I never showed them the picture.



I loved my grandpa. That day has always been special to me.



So when my sister told me he was a kidnapper, it crushed me.



Her version of the story was nothing like mine. She said Mom had asked her to pick me up from school that day since she was old enough to drive. But when she got there, I was nowhere to be found. They searched everywhere, and only after checking the surveillance footage did they figure out what had happened. The school called my parents right away.



They looked for me everywhere. Eventually, a family friend spotted me with a stranger and called my dad, giving him the location. He rushed to find me, bringing my sister along so she could take me home once they got me back. She said it was like Dad already knew who the man was. He wasn’t scared—just angry.



When my sister saw me with that stranger, she felt a kind of fear she’d never known before. The thought of never seeing me again made her feel like the ground was giving way beneath her. But she promised Dad she wouldn’t let me see how terrified she was.



Months later, my dad sat me down and told me gently but firmly that my Grandpa had died.



I never knew how he died, but now I can’t shake the feeling that my dad had something to do with it.
