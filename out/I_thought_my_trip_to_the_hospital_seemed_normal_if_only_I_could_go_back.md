For those that are reading this I’m dead, don’t bother looking for me. I have survived long enough in this god forsaken place it’s time I give up and let it consume me. 

14th of August 2020 I broke my arm after seeing my friends after the lockdown. Obviously I was in pain but my friend Darius went with me to make sure I was ok.

“Your going to be alright Hazel don’t worry “ he whispered in the silent waiting room 

“I know but I’m scared because if I need surgery I’m going to miss Matts birthday” I replied

He laughed and said “not to worry we will be out of here soon enough”

How I wish he was right. It was bizarre, for some odd reason the hospital was pin drop silent. Alexander’s memorial hospital is a normally loud and pact place being that it’s one of the only hospital’s around and it’s the largest in the country. Suddenly an eerie wailing noise was heard from the upper floor. It was like some mad banshee but we thought of it as a child not wanting to get a flu shot. 

“Hazel Schofield” said a nurse to examine me and my condition

Darius and I got up and followed the nurse into her office. The nurse was gorgeous with big dark brown eyes and luscious curly hair with a nice hour glass figure. As a lesbian at the time it did make me nervous as she was my ideal woman. 

“That arm is definitely broken but not bad enough to need an extensive surgery from what it seems I will get a X-ray done to make sure”

This was a huge sigh of relief as I could’ve made it to Matts birthday. The nurse’s name was Lilac. A beautiful name for a beautiful person. We got the X-ray done and thought nothing off it. We we’re preparing for what’s next when we heard another wailing scream from the floor above. 

“What’s going on up there” Darius said

Nurse Lilac was confused when out of the blue there was a intercom on the hospital speakers.

“Attention all staff there is a Code T this is not a drill I repeat a Code T” this was said by a crying female voice who then horrifyingly said “it’s escaped may god help us all” before screaming so terrifyingly and in such pain I started to sob. 

Nurse Lilac immediately said we need to leave so we bolt out of that little office and we are met by the most hideous horrific heinous thing I’ve ever seen it’s a giant being that was missing teeth and slimy looking. The thing was so ugly it made me vomit, it had this decaying body which had a gaping hole in its chest exposing ribs with this head that was like a mushroom but shaped like a upside down umbrella. 

It attached itself to Darius who let out a horrific cry for help. We couldn’t do anything it was much stronger than us two women and it tore Darius to shreds turning him into the same being. Nurse Lilac and I run into a janitors closet and lock the door we were trapped we had nowhere to go.

We were in hysterics we were crying hugging each other not wanting to die. We had to survive here. Lucky for me Lilac knew lots about the creature it was some form of ghoul however it had a acute sense of sound but it was blind and couldn’t smell so as long as we were quiet we could survive. Over the next few nights  we ravaged all we could.

We ended up with some weapons a ton of food and some equipment to help us keep safe if we get attacked. That was 3 years ago now nurse Lilac died due to a flu since we couldn’t get a shot and I ran out of food for the past six months I’ve been in a tiny room with only my dead friend barely surviving off rats.

They hear me. I’m a goner. May god save us all. They are breaking the door down I can only hop they let me off easy to the ones who read this congrats on not being a victim to these beasts.
