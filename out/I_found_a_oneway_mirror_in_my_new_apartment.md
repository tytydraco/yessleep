So in January, I bought my first apartment. It was a standard one-bedroom pet-friendly place. The neighbors were friendly some were too nice, but to be fair I have a wonderful thing called \*generalized anxiety\*, so I chalked it up to that. I, and my two cats, and lived on the second floor with a window facing the back parking lot, the layout was simple you walk into the kitchen that turns into a living room, and there's a closet by the door that I used as a pantry, and between the kitchen and living room you can turn right to see an entry into my bedroom and if you walk in there's another closet to the right and a bit to the left on the same wall there is the bathroom door hopefully I explained it well enough. It wasn't in the best part of town but not the worst, I tried not to go out at night but my job doesn’t have very flexible hours (I'm a mortician and we are understaffed so I have to take extra jobs around, I don’t mind though I like helping people even if they are dead) so about once a week I have to come home at night. I try not to worry about anything since I am a taller dude with some muscle but to be safe I bring a knife with me (I could, and maybe should've, bought a gun since I’m in America but I don’t trust myself with it, especially now that I’m on edge) every time I go out but thankfully nothing bad happened so I didn’t need to use the knife!

Everything was going fine. I got used to my overly friendly neighbors and was pretty sure I saw everyone there. I was there for maybe two weeks when I walked into the lobby, after an absurdly long day, to a blood bath I had no clue who it was under the blood as they didn’t look familiar (he was the only one that tall, he probably was asked if he played basketball every couple hours) The blood was real and honestly, I thought I was gonna see him in a few days… but I didn’t he was rushed to the hospital after fainting less than 5 minutes before the ambulance arrived, but something seemed off about him I saw him through the window rushing in and he seemed superficially concerned when he saw me it turned to real concern. I tried not to think about it but his expression didn’t sit right with me, my therapist was surprised that was what I kept talking about, but I always had a high gore tolerance which went up even higher with my career.

About a week after I decided to paint my bathroom since I hadn’t had time till now and I hadn’t realized until now that the mirror could come off and what I saw horrified me… there was a hole in the next apartment, which I hadn't met the owner of until I looked at the ring-up sheet (the thing in the entrance so visitors can be let in) it was owned by the stabbed man! I looked in the hole a bit more after I calmed down and it went to his bathroom which had some… things in it, specifically a car window breaker thing, a few knives (one looked like a butcher knife and another looked like a filet knife and there was a few more), and a ski mask! If he wouldn’t have gotten stabbed and beaten with a hammer due to a failed robbery I wouldn’t be here to write this message… it is now sinking in that he didn’t die… I feel sick. I'm gonna lay down… I think I need to get out of here… maybe get a gun.

I just woke up about an hour later with a terrible headache but I know I need to get out of here. I'm packing some stuff up and I’m gonna stay at my mom's for a while. It’s such a shame I have to move out after not even 3 months, but it looks like I don’t have a choice.

Ok so I'm updating you at my mom’s house it took a bit longer due to the incident I’m about to explain.  So to start things off I went down and buckled the cat’s cages into the back seats and needed to grab the clothes that I left up there. As I was going up the elevator it felt like time froze nothing felt like it was moving as I could have sworn it took a half hour to go up one floor. After so long the doors opened and no one was there, thankfully, but it was eerily silent to the point where I could hear the ringing in my ears. I went in there, grabbed my bag, and ran out, as I turned the corner I saw someone step into the elevator but to be safe it wasn’t him I ran down the stairs and beat it down. As I was stepping out I heard the elevator open and I looked and it wasn’t him, but my adrenaline and anxiety were at an all-time high and I must have looked like a madman because the person who came out didn’t say a word, and she is always up for a chat and sits in the lobby a lot looking for some small talk. I walked out to the street and was about to book it when I saw him!

He started charging me with a lust for blood in his otherwise apathetic eyes! I saw his arsenal but he came at me with a pocket knife, weird… then I saw it was covered in caked blood, the way the crimson didn’t reflect on the man’s grisly hands will never leave my mind.  That was the last thing I remembered but from what I was told someone tackled him and subsequently pushed me to the ground knocking me unconscious with the blade nearly avoiding my colon!

Right now I'm writing this on the way to a crisis center an hour and a half away. It is the only place that is near me where I can use my phone, as music is very important to me. I’ll try to update as much as I can, but I’m not sure if there is [anything else.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Trygor/)
