It wasn't long after I graduated that my parents kicked me out. At first I didn't really understand why I had a job, I passed even if it was by the skin of my teeth. If I wasn't doing either of those two maybe I could be more understanding. But no, I was kicked out without explanation, barely even a good bye. Fortunately for me my manager at the lube shop I work at was cool enough to let me stay in the basement of the store. If you are wondering, I don't have many friends and I didn't want to burden them. I work in one of those quick oil change joints where you drive your car over a big hole. If you know you know I guess. Anyway, I slept there for a few days, waking up to the bell that rings through the shop when a customer arrives.  The car runs this hose thing over and the bell rings, that's all I know. That's all I know about how it functions. The only time I liked the thing is when we were slow and I stomped on it causing the bell to ring inside. That bell sucked. If I walked out on my job I'd rip it out the wall as I left. So my days went by work and I slept for a while until one night I got a voice from my Dad. He wasn't a big texter.

“I'm sorry. Please let me say sorry. You may have thought it was random but we couldn't risk your sister getting hurt …” He whispered 

“What” I thought to myself cutting off the message

“I love you. If it hasn't started yet and you are reading this, I'm sorry. We delayed him as long as possible. He's coming back every night now. If you haven't seen him yet, it's because he's checking everywhere you can be. He mostly searches at night as to not be seen but that doesn't mean you are safe in the sun. You'll see him soon and when you do run.”

My mind was empty, the only thing was his words bouncing off the side of my hollow skull. After a moment I was able to form words.

“Wha … what the fuck is he talking about.”

My dad was a big drinker. I thought that maybe he was trying to scrape together a drunken excuse to explain Mom and him kicking me out. I relistened to the audio message. He must've actually been high and hallucinating. My Dad sounded genuinely afraid. I'd be lying if I said it didn't unnerve me. I couldn't respond with anything that wouldn't be crushing so I didn't respond. As I was about to close my phone a final text read “Good luck.”

*DING DING* 

A new day I had off that day so I just chatted with my coworkers for a while and eventually went to get Popeyes. GOD WHAT I WOULD DO FOR A FIVE PIECE TENDER RIGHT NOW. The walk to Poppeyes was cold, it was the dead of winter and the snow was coming down heavily. The walk to Popeyes from my job / temp home was about 15 minutes, about 20 with my cautious walking. I could barely see past my nose. As i saw the gleaming heavenly light of the Popeyes sign I also saw a darker mass ahead of me blocking my path to biscuits. As I got closer I could tell it was a man. He towered about 6, maybe even 7 feet. If I'm being honest I was more impressed then I was scared. I could tell he was facing me coming the opposite direction but as I walked towards him he remained just as far. It was as if he was walking backwards. My body started to tense. I didn't know anyone that tall that would wanna mess with me like this. Walking backwards in a snow storm to scare people is ballsy. I finally got close enough to the store that I was able to make the decision to bolt towards the door risking slipping. Luckily I made it inside unscathed. 

“Well that was fuckin weird” said the employee who must have watched the entire thing. I could tell he was obviously high just by looking at him. The smell didn't help either. 

“You saw that?” I was relieved I wasn't imagining things. Although now that Im thinking about it probably woulda been better if I had. Cannot say I'm thrilled about having to walk back.

I talked to the employee who said his name was Jason and pressed him to tell me what he saw. 

“He has been standing there for almost 2 hours”

“What” I said surprised

“Yeah a few people walked by him but he only started to move a few minutes before you walked in. You know him.”

“Two … Two hours? In this fucking weather? You sure your perception of time isnt fucked.” 

“No, he's been there about as long as I've been clocked in.”

My mind rattled. I walked and sat in a booth alone. Was that who dad was talking about? Who is it and what do they want from me? I couldn't even begin to think of an answer to my question. I'm 19 I've never done anything to anyone at least not that would make them come after me. 

“Fuck!” I screamed uncontrollably, my mind was overwhelmed. 

I saw the manager glare at me and Jason was giggling a stupid giggle. I waited by the door and called my manager for a ride. Again I say he was a cool ass guy. After a few minutes I saw him pull up and flash his high beams. I got in and he could tell he knew something was off.

“You alright kid” 

“Yeah just didn't think it was safe to walk with the weather”

“So you made me drive” He chuckled 

I laughed with a half smile, the image of that figure burned in my retinas. 

We got back to the shop and I went back to the basement where I had my cardboard bed and heater set up. The realization of forgetting to order my chicken hit almost as hard as hearing that guy was out there for 2 hours. I sat and tried to wrap my head around what I experienced. The hours flew by as if I was sleeping awake. The only thing that broke me out of my trance is the bell from cars coming in. My manager eventually came down to let me know he was leaving. I hadn't even realized we closed. The rest of the day went by just as fast until I was ready to sleep. I checked all the doors to ensure they were locked. I laid down and my mind was still racing. The only reason I was able to rest was the metal garage doors and steel lobby doors were keeping me safe. My world faded to black the same dark that was that man who took over my eyes.

*Ding Ding*

I woke up to my phone ringing Slipknot’s Prosthetics blasting from the phone's small speakers. My Sister was calling me and I hesitated to answer. I wasn't mad at her but I was afraid I'd cry hearing her voice. I answered after the second ring.

“Evan, Mom and Dad are gone. I woke up and the front door was wide open.”

It took a second to process what she said. 

“Evan? Evan, please are you there?”

“Lock the front door and go to your room. Lock the room's door and the windows.” I can only assume that they were taken by that man. That towering man. 

I went to give my sister more commands, the adrenaline pumping but the anger from the realization that a way to keep her safe started to blur my rational thoughts.

“Grab something to def…”

*Ding Ding*

I was cut off midsentence and it occurred to me I wasn't sure what time it was.

“Evan? Defend myself from what? Evan?”

I slowly pulled my phone away from my ear. I looked at my phone's clock. 2 am. I knew damn well there was no customer coming in 6 hours before we open.

“Zoey ill be there soon”

“Please don't hang…”

I didn't even have a chance to hang up before I lost service. 

Ding 

I was frozen

*Ding*

*Ding*

*Ding*

*Ding* 

*Ding* 

The bell rang thousands of times hundreds of dings per second. Have you ever heard double bass in metal? Sounded like that but metallic dings. 

“Stop! Stop! Stop! Please stop.” 

And it did. The ringing stopped for a few moments. The silence was deafening after that orchestra of bells. 

DING 

Seconds after the isolated ring it sounded like a car barreled into the garage bay door. Something big wanted in. That man more than likely. Was he driving his car into the door? Did he have my parents? I bolted upstairs if he was here that means he wasn't with my sister. I knew I had to get to her before he realized he'd be there all night trying to get through the door. As I got to the top of the steps I peaked out the small window in the garage door. He wasn't driving a car. He was slamming his body into the door. I still couldn't make out many features besides its purple glowing eyes and almost chrome looking teeth. It was nearly as tall as the garage door and that is while it was hunched over. It was frail and withered. Its skin black as coal. I went to the front door and the whole building shook with the crashes at the back door. I slid the lock open and cracked the front door. I lived 10 minutes from here. That wouldn't be too bad if the crashing didnt stop immediately after I opened the door.

*DING* 

I took off as if the sound was a starting shot in a foot race. I thought I was in the clear until I felt it running behind me. It wasn't close but it was so large the earth shook beneath its steps. As it grew closer I could hear it but instead of crashing its feet hitting the ground it was just ding ding ding. Its steps mimicked the bell. It knew I hated the sound. It was mocking me. I got closer and closer to my house and it grew closer and closer to me. I peeked behind me. It's growing. It stands about 25 feet in height but still looks frail. Fortunately it seemed the added height seemed to slow it down however I hate to know what it would do to the garage door now. I saw the silhouette of my house when the front door was open. My sister reached her hand out to pull me in and I reached out to grab it. That's when I saw the creature's hand fly by my ear and plunge into my sister's chest. I slipped on ice as it happened. My sister died in front of me. That was the last thing I saw before passing out. I woke up in the woods staring at the sky. I could hear fire crackling nearby. I sat up trying to take in my surroundings but everything was blurry. A loud roar echoed through the forest. I was hoping that I was at a party and smoked some laced weed and that that was all a nightmare. My vision started to clear up as I approached the fire. I could smell something cooking. Meat, yes definitely meat. I couldn't tell what kind based on the smell. Another loud roar. I approached the fire to find my sister roasting above it. I dropped to my knees and let out a scream.

"WHERE ARE YOU"

"WHERE ARE YOU SHOW YOURSELF YOU PUSSY"

I looked around the woods so enraged I didn't even acknowledge my parents hanging on nearby trees. 

"WHERE ARE YOU"

*DING*
