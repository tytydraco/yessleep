Hello me again in the time since my last post I have been able to purchase all the necessary stuff for are trip to hell, several dozen crosses, better clothes and some proper eye protection and gas masks

I also purchased a bunch of salt as one of the commenters recommended to make some sort of barrier around the portals opening so we don’t get jumped by demons waiting by the portal

I should probably introduce the people who I’ve convinced to join me on my trip, there’s Alice you already know from my last post, she’s the lady who saved my life,  mike the guy I’m staying with how’s super in the paranormal as you know

And John who I’ve known for years and is a few years older then us, he works for some government agency and agreed to come take a look at it, I don’t know what it’s called when I asked he just said it’s classified or that I wouldn’t know it, which admittedly was a little suspicious but I didn’t think anything of it

Anyway one night all four of use of went to a one of mikes storage sheds to test out the portal and we all suited up, me and mike going in first with me using the crosses to fend off what I could with my holy water guns 

While he used the salt which seemed to do the trick and for those wondering yes I did see the succibis again and I am happy to say it’s now a pile of damp ash, after we cleared the nearby area and expanded the salt circle to be able to have room to move around we began lowering the supplies 

After we got the all the stuff down Alice jumped down and looked extremely unhappy about this whole situation, while John was as calm as ever holding a camera and some other monitoring devices with a strange brand logo on the side

Me and mike began showing everyone around the near by area, before he headed down to the cave I saw on my first trip down which I could now see had a lava river between us and it

John wasn’t able to cross because he was carrying the camera and if it got broken he wouldn’t be able to convince his colleges this was serious, which at the time I doubt even with footage they wouldn’t believe that we found a portable hell portal in a trash can

Luckily the river wasn’t big enough that we couldn’t jump over it with are crosses and water guns, we handed foward with me walking slightly ahead of mike and Alice who were following me with mike staying near the entrance to the cave so nothing could take us or John by surprise 

It wasn’t long before we found what was left of my mother, I will spare you the details but let’s just their wasn’t enough of her left to burry and we would probably end up accidentally bring back parts of other people by mistake

So me and Alice payed are respects before heading out with me keeping my head facing inwards to make sure nothing jumped us, we were about half way out of the cave when we heard John and mike scream for us to come quickly 

We ran the rest of the way almost falling before we made it to mike and John who were in the corner using their crosses to keep back a group of imps that had thrown rocks leading to mike dropping his water gun and johns had broken while trying to save the camera which luckily was still in one peace

Me and Alice then used the last of are holy water to take out the imps before we started heading back up to the portal now that we had no ammunition, we got into the salt circle and began placing crosses along the walls and other surfaces in the area near us so that we didn’t get a repeat of the last incident 

Then we climbed out of the portal and we all went are separate ways after a quick trip to a near by kfc we learned that next to no time had passed when we were in there

Mike left to head home before me who decided to go for a walk to clear my head then John joined me and said the place he works would be willing to take the portal off my hands, even pay my a quite handsome some of cash and even erase my memories of it if that’s what I wanted 

I haven’t decided yet but I’m seriously considering just talking the money and putting this behind me but something just feels wrong about it, anyway I might just go back one last time on my own just say goodbye, I don’t know that feels very dumb going to hell to say goodbye to a bunch of corpses that barely resemble the people they once were when I got a perfectly good not demonic tombstone I can visit 

I’ll update you on the situation when I make my decision, until then feel free to give me any advice you got or speculation on who the hell john works for because he still won’t give me a name
