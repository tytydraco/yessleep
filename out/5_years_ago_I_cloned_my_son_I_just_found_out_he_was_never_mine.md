I parked down the block. Kept the engine running. Didn’t touch the envelope on the seat beside me.

It was already open—the paper inside curled and sweat-warped from being folded and unfolded too many times. I’d memorized every word, every percentage, every damning absence of genetic overlap. I didn’t need to read it again. But I would. Probably tonight. Probably every night from now on.

I was shaking. From rage. From shame. From something darker.

He was sitting in his booster seat, dozing quietly.

She hadn’t seen me in over a decade. Not since the funeral. Not since we buried Leo—our son, my son—in a plot shaded by cypress trees and long silences. He was five. Slipped into a neighbor’s pool while everyone was laughing around the grill.

I’d never stopped seeing that day. I’d never stopped wishing I’d heard the splash that no one else noticed.

The doctors had been fast. Too fast. “Brain dead. No response. Time to let go.” I tried everything. Begged. Hyperbaric therapy. Second opinions. I even called a neurologist in New Orleans who specialized in miracle cases. I held on with both hands.

She let go.

I was overruled.

Grief hollowed me out. Left me brittle. Left me alone. I drifted into forums, Facebook groups, watched other grieving parents try to carry on like nothing had happened. I tried. I dated. I moved. I drank. But the world narrowed until all I had left was one impossible wish.

That’s when I found them.

Or maybe they found me.

A clinic in a country no one talks about. No address. No receipts. Just coordinates and a succession of meetings about funds.

They called it Selective Genetic Recultivation. Like they were growing tomatoes.

They didn’t need much, they said. A baby tooth. A lock of hair. A sliver of umbilical cord, still pressed between wax paper in an old scrapbook.

I gave them everything. I wired the money. I signed the forms—forms masked as adoption paperwork, sealed in obscure legalese and stamped with unfamiliar sigils.

A year later, I was flat broke—but they gave me Leo again, my beautiful baby boy.

Same eyes. Same laugh. Same habit of tugging my sleeve when he was about to doze off.

It was perfect. I was overjoyed.

I moved across the country. Changed my name. Started over. I told no one—not even her. It was selfish. It was monstrous. But it felt like salvation.

I raised him and every day was a second chance I never took for granted. 

Until last week. Leo turned 5 … again 

The pediatrician ran a routine genetic panel—for medication allergies, she said. I let her do mine as well.

And then came the call.

“Sir… there’s been a mistake. The child you brought in—he isn’t biologically related to you. At all.”

No match. No overlap. Nothing.

Which meant Leo was still a clone.

Just not mine.

And there was only one other person in the world who could have given them the other half of his DNA.

The woman I was about to face, for the first time in over a decade 




She stared at the test results, her hands trembling.




“I feared this day,” she whispered, and for a moment, I saw her—not the woman I’d hated, but the girl I married. Pale and frightened. Haunted.

“I thought… I hoped he was yours. But I didn’t know for sure. It happened when you were away … My supervisor, he forced himself on me. I never told you because I didn’t want it to be real. And then Leo died…”

Her voice broke.

“…and I thought maybe that was the end of it. Of everything. Of that nightmare.”

My fists slowly unclenched.

There was a long silence, the kind that stretches into the hollows of old grief.

“I’m sorry,” she said.

“I am too,” I managed.

We stood there like statues—grief, guilt, and forgiveness carving us hollow. Then she glanced over my shoulder, to the street, to the car parked at the curb.

“Is that a kid in your car…?”

She trailed off, a softness returning to her face. A gentle awe.

“I adopted,” I lied smoothly.

A small smile bloomed behind her tears. “Does he make you happy?” she said.

I nodded. “He’s a good kid.”

We embraced—two parents wrecked and remade by loss—and I felt a strange kind of peace, like maybe this terrible wound could scab over.

But then… she stepped outside. Just a few feet. Just far enough to glimpse the car again.

And Leo… Leo had turned in his seat, somehow gotten up on his booster seat . Pressed one hand against the window.

She saw him.

Not a photo. Not a memory.

Him.

What was I thinking.

Her expression collapsed in real-time. Her mouth opened, no sound. She stumbled backward, eyes wide, hands to her chest.

I turned. Got back in the car. Fastened the belt.

I pulled away to her screaming my name.

And his.

She’d seen him. She knew. And she would never forget that face.

But I had the paperwork. The passports. The clean aliases.

Leo stirred in his seat, excited at how fast I was driving.

I reached for his hand.

“Just a little further and we’ll be home, buddy,” I said.

And we drove. Into the dusk. Into our second, stolen chance.
