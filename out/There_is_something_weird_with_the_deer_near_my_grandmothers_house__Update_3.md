It's been almost a month since my last post and if I am being honest, I was unsure if I ever wanted to update again.

My first post has since been deleted because as previously mentioned, I was contemplating on just keeping everything that has happened to myself, but after some consideration. I’ve decided that I need to share what happened to me and my grandmother.I’ll start by saying that in my last update, I was trying to figure out the species of the deer and that my grandmother was considering contacting a professional animal behavioral specialist. And shortly after my post we did.A small team of specialists did in fact show up to my grandmother's property, but what they discovered left all of us feeling uneasy.

They could not identify the deer.

No known species matched the deer that were found all around the property.Soon, more and more specialists and even scientists came to set up cameras and examine the unexplainable things that lingered around the area.

By this time, it was already December 30th and I was convinced by my Grandmother that I needed to go home because she was rather worried about me being surrounded in the environment that her house was currently in So, I left the very next day.

I continued to call my Grandmother almost every single day, eager to hear about any new news, but much to my dismay, she was unaware of a majority of the investigation that was being conducted and eventually she soon stopped receiving updates about the deer all together.As the days passed, and I heard less and less information, I had decided to just give up on trying to figure out the whole thing all together, but that's until I heard the news.

Zombie Deer disease, it's been all over the news recently and I can't help but feel that it is in some way contented with these strange occurrences.For now, I'm left feeling unsatisfied with how everything has turned out. I still am left with the same questions, and I have a feeling that my questions may not ever be answered.However during the few first days of having the small team of specialists around, I was able to witness footage taken by the cameras around the area. On it, we were able to see that they were infact able to move, but that they had a sort of pattern that they would follow, they would arrive near my grandmother's house around 6pm and then around midnight they would gather around the house and would stay there until 4am. The one thing that we all did notice was how they moved. 

&#x200B;

It was in reverse.

&#x200B;

They walked backwards.I can not tell you how horrified I was when watching the tape, it felt like I was seeing something that I was not meant to see.It was that very night that my grandmother had decided that I needed to cut the trip short and go back home. I think that she knew that whatever was going on, was not natural and that I couldn't be around it.I can't explain it, but these deer have to in some way be related to this deer disease that I’ve been seeing all over the web, and I have a strange feeling that whatever is happening here, may start happening all over the world.

But for now, I urge you to be cautious about any deer that you see lurking outside of your house around night, they might not be deer at all.
