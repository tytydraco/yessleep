Like all regrets, this one began with the belief that I was getting sex at the end of the night. 

At first, I didn’t get it. A mansion full of wizards? The [Magic Castle](https://www.magiccastle.com/) is this weird-ass place in Hollywood where people are performing in every room and some of the hallways. 

When I got there, I found out that several bars were sprinkled throughout the mansion. Elisa didn’t see the bill I signed at the first three. 

She also didn’t see how much I paid for dinner, which we were obligated to attend.

*Then* I got it. 

But I have to admit that it was worth it. I watched a man make fruit disappear over and over into a solid cup while I sat at the bar and watched. It might not sound impressive, but I nearly shat my pants. Elisa was watching, so I held the bugger in, but there’s no way to articulate the experience until you’re sitting in front of the guy who appears to change physics as we know it. 

I watch some other guy write what I told him onto a sheet of paper, then wave the writing away while I stood over his shoulder. 

And we ended the night in the “big room,” where we watched a nervous-looking volunteer crawl into a box. He waved to his family before they locked him in. Two seconds later, they opened it and he was gone. 

I know how these stupid tricks are supposed to work. False bottoms, secret doors in the floor, all that shit. But the box was standing upright on a clear platform with nothing behind it. The magician opened the empty box, then *took it apart* and left the pieces on stage. There was literally nowhere the man could have gone. 

I clenched my buttcheeks.

Then *I* got called up on stage because the performer said I looked like the strongest guy in the room. So I took off my jacket (they make you wear a suit and tie for some reason) and rose to the occasion. Elisa squeezed my hand as I got up. 

That’s a good sign.

The magician wrapped his hands around a metal bar and told me to tie his thumbs together on the opposite side as tight as I could. I took that as a challenge, and pulled the string until his thumbs were purple. 

The perspiration on his forehead was shining like a spotlight. I could smell his sweat. 

It seemed weird as shit, and I stepped away knowing that I’d put some serious muscle into it.

“Excellent job, son. By the way, is that your date?” he asked, pointing at Elisa. 

I turned to look at her and froze. 

Slowly pivoting back, I stared in shock as he held his hand up, free of my bonds. 

The audience laughed and clapped. I headed back to my seat, bewildered and a little pissed. 

Elisa squeezed my hand. I felt better. 

“Did you *really* tie him as tight as you could?” she asked a couple of hours later as we walked out of the final room. It was past midnight. 

“*Yes*,” I insisted, frustrated. “Look, I can bench one ninety – one minute…” Three seconds passed as I stared behind me. “Shit. Where did I leave my jacket?”

Elisa smirked. “You took it off just before going on stage, strong man,” she answered, trailing her finger up and down my biceps. 

That was my cue to exit. 

Not going to lie, I almost considered leaving the jacket behind. But it was expensive as shit, so I asked her to wait and jogged back through the deserted mansion.

It was significantly eerier after hours. I really, really felt like I didn’t belong as I made my way toward the Big Room, deep in the middle of the house. 

Nausea hit me as I touched the knob; it was like I was somewhere *wrong*, as though my presence was unwelcome. But I thought of Elisa twirling her hair as she waited for me, and the urge to open the forbidden door suddenly beat out the desire to stay put. 

I shouldn’t have opened the door.

Every magician I’d seen that night was in a circle on stage. Standing in the middle was the man who had disappeared into the box and never returned. 

He was gagged and sobbing.

And he was missing a fucking *hand*. A bloody stump slowly dripped blood onto the floor as the magicians passed around a wineglass filled with bright red liquid. One at a time, they drank from it. When the last one was finished, two of them approached the handless man. He shook his head and forced muffled screams against his dirty rag, but it didn’t slow them down as they lifted him up.

And then they threw him.

I can’t really explain what happened next. A dark circle either appeared behind him, or I just noticed it in that moment. Something about it was wrong, as though the circle didn’t really exist, but it did because I was afraid of it. I don’t know how else to explain it. Regardless, he disappeared into it and immediately stopped making noise. 

That’s when beams of light shot *out* of the hole and connected with every magician, illuminating their skin. 

That’s when I got the fuck out. 

Elisa was excited to go home with me, but my mind was somewhere else. I mean yes, she still had sex with me and it was great, but it took all my effort not to shit myself during the performance. 

She left before I woke up. I had hoped that I would be able to move past everything the next morning. 

For a moment, I did. The sun was shining. I went to my front stoop to grab the newspaper.

Something other than the newspaper was waiting for me. 

I shook as I looked down, convinced that I couldn’t be seeing what I was seeing. With a trembling hand, I reached down and grabbed it.

It was the jacket I’d left in the Big Room.

It was warm.
