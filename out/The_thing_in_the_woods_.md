I’m not one to believe in ghosts or monsters, but something happened to me two years ago that I still can’t explain. I’ve never told anyone—not because I think they’d call me crazy, but because I don’t want to relive it. Writing it down feels safer. Maybe by sharing it, I’ll finally stop seeing it in my dreams.

It was late autumn, and my brother and I decided to go hiking in the state forest near my hometown. We’d done it a hundred times before, but this time, we thought it would be fun to camp overnight. The forest was beautiful that time of year, all fiery reds and oranges, and the air was crisp but not too cold. We packed light, brought some snacks and beer, and headed out just before dusk.

By the time we reached a good spot to set up camp, the sun was already low, casting long shadows through the trees. We pitched the tent, started a small fire, and spent a couple of hours just talking and laughing, the way you do when the world feels far away.

Around midnight, we started to hear noises.

At first, it was just rustling in the bushes. We figured it was an animal—a deer, maybe, or a raccoon. But then came this… clicking sound. Like two stones tapping together, rhythmic and deliberate.

“Did you hear that?” my brother asked, his voice low.

“Yeah,” I said.

We both sat still, straining to listen. The clicking continued, growing louder, then softer, as if whatever was making the noise was circling us.

“Probably some weird bird,” I said, trying to sound casual. But my brother didn’t look convinced, and neither was I.

Then we saw the eyes.

They were faint at first, two pale orbs reflecting the firelight from beyond the tree line. They weren’t high up, like you’d expect from an animal. They were at ground level, staring at us unblinking.

“What the hell is that?” my brother whispered.

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t.

The eyes moved closer, slow and deliberate, and as they did, the clicking sound grew louder. My brother grabbed the flashlight and pointed it toward the eyes.

Nothing.

The beam cut through the trees, illuminating nothing but empty forest. Yet the eyes were still there, just outside the flashlight’s reach.

“Turn it off,” I said.

“What?”

“Turn it off!”

Reluctantly, he clicked the flashlight off, plunging us into darkness again. The eyes were closer now.

And then we heard it—a low, guttural growl, not like any animal I’ve ever heard. It sounded wrong, like it didn’t belong in this world.

“Run,” I whispered.

We didn’t grab anything, not even our backpacks. We just ran, the fire still crackling behind us. The forest was pitch-black, and the only light came from the moon filtering through the branches. I could hear my brother panting beside me, and behind us, the clicking sound was faster now, almost frantic.

We didn’t stop until we reached the car.

When we slammed the doors shut and locked them, we just sat there, gasping for air. Neither of us said anything. Eventually, my brother turned the key, and we sped out of there, leaving the forest—and whatever was in it—far behind.

The next day, we went back to get our stuff. Everything was still there, untouched. But around the campsite, the ground was covered in strange marks—long, deep scratches in the dirt, as if something had crawled around the fire all night.

We never went back to that forest.

And sometimes, late at night, I still hear the clicking.
