It was that time again. Sometime around midnight, I think. The ‬outside was silent, save for the sound of a passing train in the distance, its whistle sounding like a lonesome cry in the dark.
I live alone now, in a house far too large for my cat and me. It sits on an acre and a half of forest in suburban Connecticut. The other residents of the neighbourhood are on similarly sized parcels of land. Distant enough from one another that each house might as well be the last on Earth.

I like my quiet.

I like my solitude.

I wasn’t always such an introvert.

I was startled awake by some nameless horror. A mental monstrosity that vanished the second I opened my eyes. The sweat from my brow mixed with something else on my face. Tears. My eyes stung, and my cheeks were damp.

‘Damn it,’ I thought to myself.

I knew I'd been dreaming about him again. Glancing over at his side of the bed as I absentmindedly reached for the prescription bottles of Klonopin & Seroquel on my nightstand. Those, as well as weekly visits to my psychiatrist, were part of this thing called ‘grief therapy’. It wasn't working.

His side of the bed was empty. Why wouldn’t it be? He had been dead and gone over a year. I hadn’t washed his pillowcases since the incident. I didn’t want to lose his scent from them. Usually, his aroma brought comfort. On this night, however, it made the memories more piercingly vivid and painful.

Even after all of this time, more often than not, I can feel him. His presence. It ebbs and flows during the day. He falters but never flees. Every so often, I catch glimpses of him in my periphery. A spectral form that hides as soon as I turn to face it.

Some find it comforting to see their late loved ones. However, on this unsettling night, I'd reached a point at which the sightings left me with an uneasy knot in my gut. All at once, I felt the need to get out of there. Out of that house.

I made a decision.

I cleaned up, then I slipped into my Iron Heart jeans, a green Momotaro t-shirt, and a pair of boots. Hastily, I threw clothes, toiletries, and pills into a backpack, before hurrying out of the house. As I was about to shut the front door behind me, I heard a meagre meow.

Sasha.

Our... My tortoiseshell cat, adopted from the Humane Society, was looking at me quizzically. Sighing, I went back inside, put down my backpack, and gathered her travel kit. Beneath that sigh, however, there was relief. I didn't want to be alone. Not really.

I headed north on the I-95 towards Maine. I really didn’t have a clue as to where I was going, but I was put at ease by both the drive and the sound of Sasha’s purr-snores, underscoring Chris Rea’s “Looking For Summer”.

Until the memories resurfaced. The cold ones. The fighting, the yelling, the sobbing, and the cheating. MY cheating. Where did the good memories go?

My stomach growled as though it were empty, and I wasn't sure whether I'd eaten that evening. I hadn't had an appetite for a long time. I was more concerned with feeding Sasha than myself. And she'd been woken, either by my restless murmuring or groaning belly. The bundle of fur regarded me with a look that asked, “What’s up, Papa?”

Then my belly growled again with surprising intensity. I needed to find a place to stop, eat, and rest.

'Come to think of it, I have no idea where I've gone,' I suddenly mumbled to myself.

Not a bar of service on my phone. Not a hint of direction from my GPS. The onboard navigation seemed to be frozen. And the road was approaching a bend, but I did not recall exiting the highway.
I started to slow down as an imposing structure became visible. In the midst of trees and fog, it reminded me of a haunted manor from some work of fiction. Unlike something King would conjure, however, this building was beautifully maintained and nicely lit. In bold, timeless lettering, a plaque on the front of the building read: The Whispering Willows Inn.

I parked and took a moment to collect my breath. Then I grabbed my backpack, used treats to lure Sasha into her carrier, and made my way to the entrance. I recall wondering whether this place would have an issue with pets, but that thought was interrupted by the parting of two oak doors. A man, or teenager, stepped outside to smile warmly at me. It was hard to place his age, as he seemed neither young nor old.

“Good evening... Er, morning,” I said, attempting a smile.

The man said nothing in response, but nodded and smiled back. It wasn’t one of those false, polite smiles. It was warm and reached his eyes. A smile that lowered my guard. I made my way through the deceptively large lobby, stepping on lightly coloured hardwood floors. As we strolled towards the reception desk, I took note of the Hotel’s decor.

Is it Art Deco? Belle Époque? Something else entirely, no doubt. Björn would have known. He knew so much.

‘Back in 8 minutes’, read the hastily scrawled sign behind the main desk. Its haphazard appearance seemed at odds with the immaculate aesthetic of the lobby. And when I turned around, I found that the man had disappeared. I was certain he'd been following me.

After waiting about 10 minutes, I pushed the button to try and speak to someone. Uncharacteristically, Sasha was snoozing. I would've liked her company, as I suddenly felt very alone. Gone was the comforting ambience of the room. Then the sound of a staticky crackle jolted me to attention.

“Erm, hello?” I ventured tentatively.

“Good evening, sir,” Came a woman’s voice from the speaker.

She spoke with an accent I couldn’t quite place.

“I think... I mean, I’d like a room for the night please. I may extend my stay in the morning for a day or two more. I don’t know yet. Oh, also, I have my cat with me. She’s really well trained and won’t be a bother...” I promised.

I found myself rambling at that point, flustered and unsure as to why.

“Very good, Mr. Oxenstierna,” The mysterious woman said. “We have you in Room 222 on the second floor. Sasha is more than welcome here. Please don’t hesitate to contact the concierge, should you need anything, and enjoy your stay with us.”

The late hour and lack of food was getting to me. I didn’t initially notice the voice pronounced my Swedish surname flawlessly. Barely noticed her name my cat either. But the cogs were starting to turn.

“Did I even tell you my... Never mind. Don’t you need my ID? A credit card? Something?” I asked, somewhat rattled and disoriented.

“No need, Mr. Oxenstierna. It’s late. We'll sort everything in the morning.”

A crackle followed before I managed to respond, and the conversation ended.

'That was odd,' I muttered to myself.

The Vanishing Concierge reappeared and escorted me to the elevator. I didn't ask where he'd gone. I wasn't sure I would've liked the answer. When the doors opened, the man handed me what I presumed was my room key. Heavy, old-fashioned, and made of iron. It had the number “222” etched elegantly at its base.

And when I arrived at Room 222, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was perfect. Not too big. Not too small. Dark, hardwood floors. A nicely sized Persian rug. A double bed. Even a dressing table.

“Ok, Sashers. Let’s get you situated,” I said to my cat.

As I busied myself with setting up her litterbox and dishes, Sasha happily left her carrier and made herself comfortable at the foot of the bed. I joined her, perching at the edge of the bed and kicking off my boots. Finally feeling, having fled from my haunted home, peaceful. Finally enjoying a moment of silence.

Silence broken by a voice which snarled beside my ear.

“What the Hell are you doing here?”

I screamed and tumbled off the bed.

It wasn’t just a voice. It was his voice.

“Fuck. I’m losing it,” I told myself, panting heavily.

I reached for my backpack and fished out my meds. There were two bottles. In one bottle was Seroquel. An anti-psychotic prescribed to me by my Ivy League shrink. An integral part of my ‘Grief Management’, supposedly. And in the other bottle was Klonopin. Something to alleviate my anxiety.

"To take the edge off," The doctor said.

Both were part of ‘The Programme’. Both were supposed to lessen my grief and anger at the world. At happy fucking couples that passed me on the way to and from work. At everybody and their merry existences. One 100mg tablet of the Seroquel was supposed to conk me out. The Klonopin wasn’ttechnically supposed to be used in conjunction with the Seroquel before bed, but I no longer gave a fuck.

Again, the 100mg of Seroquel should have been enough to wipe me out. This time, it wasn’t.

“Are you really doing this?”

His voice again. Right in front of me.

“Fuck you,” I said, swallowing both pills down dry. And then some more.

I'd increased the doctor's dosage from one pill to two pills. I was considering upping my dosage to three. I didn't want to get better. I wanted numbness. Total oblivion.

Of course, I'd developed a tolerance. I was struggling to sleep easily. So, I started adding Klonopin that I obtained from an offshore online “pharmacy” without telling my doctor. I knew he would only insist I stop, and blending the two actually helped me find some sleep here and there.

On this strange night, in an unnerving hotel, my stomach somersaulted. It did not approve of being filled with the last few pills in those bottles. It didn't have the usual effect. I felt nauseated, not restful. I was losing control of my motor functions. I may have thrown up, but I don’t remember. The next thing I recall is lying face-down on my hotel room floor. Sasha circled me, voicing her concern with a sharp series of meows.

I felt as if I were being pulled underwater. Pulled into a realm of my subconscious that I'd never seen before. I may have shit myself too, but I barely cognisant of my physical form. I walked a tightrope between two worlds, barely keeping my balance. Barely wanting to keep my balance. I was so, so tired. But something in my gut told me if I were to succumb to the ‘sleep’, I wouldn’t wake again.

Not this time.

I was beyond exhausted. Every inch of my body, mind and spirit became chilled as I decided to stop fighting and let myself drift away into a dreamy, swirling darkness.

There were no sounds.

There was no light.

There was nothing.

“Am I dead?” I thought. “Is this purgatory?”

Room 222 faded, and I found myself standing somewhere else. Staring at an empty landscape with only one building in view. My body was suspended in a place not meant for the living. And the structure ahead appeared like some mutated, deformed version of The Whispering Willows Inn. A building half-claimed by the black, unnatural vines rising up from the underworld. I was seeing the true face of the inn, which had always lurked beneath its pretty demeanour. I understood at long last. Understood that the hotel had drawn me into its depths. Sensed my willingness to leave the real world. And it was welcoming me with open arms. Something dark. Something from another realm. And in the doorway at the back of my subconscious, I saw him. The concierge. A tall figure beckoning me into his world. Offering to introduce me to the woman behind the speaker. The silhouette revealed in the top window of the house.

The only things that seemed to permeate the murkiness of this realm were the cold and the quiet. That bitter kind of cold that cuts into your bones and settles into the marrow. And in that quiet, offering only a slight crackle in the distance, I heard him again. Rising to be heard over the static of the woman behind the speaker. The woman whose hotel had enticed me with its warm lights. Tricked me into stepping from one dimension into another.

“Why are you here?” He asked, his voice angry.

“I’m imagining this. You’re not real,” I said, speaking more to myself than Björn.

“You always ran away,” He said.

“I... I couldn’t be around you after the cheating. You… You didn’t even bother trying to hide it,” I sobbed, finding the strength to stand.

I was trying to rid my sight of the hotel in my mind's eye. Break free from that awful plane between existences. Return myself to Room 222. Return myself to Earth before slipping into the other realm forever.

“You ran away,” He repeated. “I needed you, and you ran away.”

He started to coalesce into view. And it no longer felt like the medication. Not even sleep-deprivation. It was real. I'd felt it when I first stepped into the hotel. Felt that this was a bridge between existences. And I was staring through a window into the afterlife. Staring at Björn.

“What the...” I stammered, backing away from the apparition.

“You ran away.”

He was solidifying, appearing as I remembered him. Tall, blond, and handsome.

“No...” I whispered, continuing to back away as my husband advanced.

The colours of the demonic realm started to swirl, revealing glimmers of Room 222 again. I tried to clutch to that world. Tried desperately to return to the comfort of my bed. Of Sasha. Of anything that belonged to reality.

“That’s not... That isn’t...” I stammered, burying my hands in my face as he reached for me.

“You don't want to follow them,” He whispered, drawing my attention away from the terrifying concierge and the woman in the window. "They won't take you to me. They'll take you somewhere worse."

I whimpered. "I... I don't..."

"Please stop running from the world," He begged. "You still belong there."

He took me in his arms, and that coldness dissipated. It was replaced with warmth. Replaced with something I hadn’t felt in a long time. Love. It was a welcome respite from the unrelenting grief. More medicinal than all of the drugs in the world.

After an eternity in that loving embrace, I felt at peace. Felt devoid of fury and fear. The emotions I'd been enduring for over a year, long before Björn even died. Doctors blamed an ‘aneurysm’ for his death. I blamed the universe. Blamed it for taking such a strong man from the world. My foothold in life.

And that immovable man was right. I had been running.

For a year, I had been adrift in a vast nothingness. It was so cold. So warm. To me, it stretched endlessly. Offered far more than the haunting hotel in the centre. I believed the concierge and the woman. Felt that something greater awaited. A paradise with Björn. We wouldn't be parted ever again. But it was a lie. I wasn’t able to form coherent thoughts in this state. I wasn't real.

In the periphery of my hearing, there came two quiet words.

“Wake up.”

Startled, I could feel my senses beginning to regain their function.

Again. Louder.

“Wake up.”

Feeling strength and coherence return to my mind, I paid attention to his voice over the static of the woman behind the speaker. The air felt colder. Felt autumnal again. I was returning to Room 222.

“Wake up!”

I opened my eyes. Groggy, semi-functional, and fully aware. My head was throbbing. I sat cross-legged on the floor. Despite the chill, sweat darkened my shirt, and it clung to my body. I could see my breath like smoke before me. And standing over me was him. Not in that demonic world of the alternate inn. No. This was Room 222. This was reality. And he was there. As clearly as I was there.

Björn.

The man smiled at me, his image dissipating as Sasha looked me up and down. She looked at him for a moment too. Meowed in a mixture of shock and joy. She saw him. I know she did. Just as I know she was looking at me with a mixture of worry, relief, and comfort on her fuzzy visage.

While picking Sasha up and putting her on the bed, I caught myself beaming. And to my surprise, I didn't flee the inn. Didn't fear the concierge and the woman. Not anymore. They wouldn't entice me away from this world. I knew that. They held no power over me. So, I stripped off my sweat-soaked shirt and burrowed into the blankets. I slept well for the first time in a long time.

I could still feel his embrace. His touch. His forgiveness.

I wasn’t afraid, and I wasn’t running.
