Let me start by giving you some context. I am 19. This all started about 7 or 8 months ago. 

I live in a small farm town in northern Colorado, one of those towns you’ll have no idea exists if you pass through on a roadtrip and you’re taking a nap. The town is mostly surrounded by fields and farm land, so you’ll hear some noises but nothing too out of the ordinary. Sometimes a pack of coyotes or a dog barking, at the very worst a gunshot from a farmer keeping coyotes off his land. 

One night I was walking with my friend, we’ll call him Larry, he is 19 as well. We were walking down the main road of the town, but more towards the outskirts where we live. We’re coming up on the first intersection of the town and from across the street we hear what sounds like a cow mooing, every 3 seconds exactly. I was with my friend and wanted to make him laugh, so I jokingly yelled, “IS THAT A SKINWALKER?!” Worst decision of my life. 

We then heard it mooing for 30 seconds continuously, non-stop. Then it was silence. We froze, we didn’t know what to do. Until we heard a twig snap. We started booking it to my house and I told him he was staying the night there. 

After that we noticed some things (mooing, coyotes laughing, etc.) It wasn’t until a month or two ago that it got more active. 

One night Larry and his 17 year old brother Mitch were staying the night at my house. We were having fun, smoking weed, playing games, the works. Around 1:30 AM I started to get tired. I was gonna watch YouTube on my phone but realized I didn’t have my earphones. They were in my car from when I got home from work. I told them I’ll be right back, and that I’m gonna grab my earphones from my car. I grabbed my keys and walked out the front of my house. 

The front of my house is facing a field across the street, I also park my car on the street. Once I get to my car that’s when I hear a voice across the street say “Hey.” I look up and see something hunched over in the shrubbery, with two piercing eyes staring at me. I froze, unsure as to what to do, that’s when it stood up. It was a 7 foot tall pale humanoid creature. I panicked and ran back into my house, but every time I looked away I could hear it getting closer. 

A few weeks later I had my girlfriend over at my house and we decided to go get Taco Bell as a late night snack, so that’s what we did. After we got back, I got out of my car and started walking around to the passenger side of my car. That’s when I heard a footstep in the grass across the street. Immediately my head snapped to where the noise came from. I saw it hunched over again, its eyes staring into my soul. I kept eye contact with it and told my girlfriend to unlock the door and get inside the house. She held the door open for me and every time I looked away from it I could hear another footstep in that grass. That night we heard rustling going on in my back yard.

If you don’t hear from me after this post, I’ve accepted my fate to whatever it is following me.
