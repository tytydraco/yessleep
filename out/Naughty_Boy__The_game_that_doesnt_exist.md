My name is Gabriel, and I've been collecting retro games for over ten years. It's not just a hobby — it's almost an obsession. I drove for hours on end just to pick up a scratched cartridge, I spent more than I should have to get Japanese editions of obscure titles. But nothing prepared me for what happened the day I found Naughty Boy.

It was a sultry Sunday afternoon. I was walking through an old neighborhood, one of those that seems to have stopped in the 80s. The window of an antiques store caught my attention: record players, wooden radios, porcelain dolls... and, in the corner, a box full of Playstation 1 games.
My eyes lit up.

I entered. The air inside smelled of old wood and mold, and the sound of the creaking door echoed through the silent space. Behind the counter, a thin man with pale skin and deep-set eyes greeted me with a small smile. He didn't say anything—he just nodded, as if he already knew what I was looking for.

I started looking through the box. Most were well-known titles: Resident Evil, Metal Gear Solid, Gran Turismo… until I saw something that made me stop.

The cover was… strangely beautiful.
A boy with a mischievous expression, half of his face illuminated by an intense red light and the other half immersed in a deep blue shadow. The background looked like a night park, with rusty swings and slides. The title came in big letters, as if it were made of chalk: Naughty Boy.

I had never heard of this game — and I know practically the entire PS1 catalog.
I turned to the seller:

— This game here… do you know where it came from?
He looked quickly at the cover, then at me, and replied in a low voice:
— Better not play for too long.
Then he smiled. Or at least tried.

I thought it was just a weird storekeeper joke. I bought. The price? R$ 13.00. Strange number, but I didn't question it.



I got home and carefully cleaned the disk. The CD was completely black, with no name, just that dark reflection. I put it on my unlocked PS1 and waited.

The home screen did not have the Sony logo.
Just one sentence, in white letters on a black background:

“The game starts when you look.”

After that, soft music started playing — it sounded like music from a children's music box, but out of tune, with notes that sounded… wrong.
The menu had two options: Play and Watch. I found it curious, but I chose Play.

The screen loaded a rudimentary 3D scene: the same park as on the cover, but with thick fog. I controlled a boy in a striped t-shirt. There was no HUD, there was no clear objective. Just the possibility of walking around the park. With every step, I heard muffled giggles — but they weren't from my character. They seemed to come from outside the TV.

I continued exploring. In the corners, I saw figures standing still, a little blurry, as if they hadn't loaded properly. When I tried to get closer, they disappeared.
After a few minutes, I noticed something: the laughter was getting louder, and the game camera would sometimes turn on its own to show… something behind me. But when I rotated the character, there was nothing.

I played for about half an hour, until I noticed something that made my stomach turn cold: the boy in the game had started to exactly imitate my movements with the controller. Not just walking and jumping, but also the pauses, the hesitations... as if he knew I was trying to understand what was happening.

I hung up.


Over the next few days, I couldn't stop thinking about the game. When I slept, I dreamed of the park. Always in the same spot: facing the rusty slide, and someone — always out of focus — watching me from a distance.

I decided to play again.
But that time, when I called, there was no menu. Just the boy standing in the park, looking straight into the camera.
He smiled.
And he said my name. “Hi, Gabriel.”

My heart raced. The PS1 didn't have a microphone, there was no way to know my name. I continued, even though I was shaking.
The boy started to walk, and I realized he wasn't controlling anything. It was as if the game had become a video. But, little by little, the camera moved away from him… and revealing that behind was my room. With the same wall, the same shelves, the same PS1 on the table.

I watched, transfixed, as the boy turned toward the bedroom door in the game. Just as he put his hand on the doorknob, someone knocked on my real door.
Three times. Slow.


I locked the door and turned everything off. I spent days avoiding the console. Until, on an idiotic impulse, I decided to go back to the store to ask the salesperson about the game. But…
The store was no longer there.
In place, an empty space, full of dust and cobwebs, as if no one had entered there years ago.

Confused, I asked a man at a nearby bakery.
—The antique store? Ah, son… that place closed in 1998, when the owner died.

My stomach turned.
I had bought the game two weeks ago.

I returned home stunned. I needed to confirm that the disk was still there. But when I opened the box… there was no CD.
Just a folded piece of paper.
In my own handwriting:

“The game starts when you look.”

And, at the end of the room, coming from the corridor… the box music started to play.
