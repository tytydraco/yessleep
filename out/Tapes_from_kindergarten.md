That was the early '00s. A remote Siberian town, a small provincial kindergarten. I was three or four years old when the incident happened. It's not that it doesn't let me go, but I sometimes go back to it in my memories to try to clarify - what the hell was it all about?..

At the beginning of September, another year of kindergarten began. We were lucky to have a teacher - she was a very kind and affectionate woman, although she had problems with adultery on the part of her husband (which I learned about much later). But she tried to give her best in her work. And she often made us happy with cartoons - Soviet and foreign animation were frequent guests, if I may say so. We kept the cartoons on cassettes, which in turn were stored on the shelf of the chest of drawers that was the TV stand. Cassetes mostly packaged into white shiny boxes without any description, except date of recording, writed on dirty scotch tape. Most of the time the teacher took the cassettes unnoticed by us, but after a month someone discovered them in our group. Cassetes was packaged into white box without any description except of date and We started playing with them, and I was attracted by the packaging of the cartoon "Bionicle: Legends of Metru-Nui". Without thinking, I grabbed the package and ran up to the teacher, saying: "Aunt Sveta, please show us this cartoon! Please!".

Her reaction surprised me. She rushed over to us, shoved everyone, collected the tapes, put them back on the shelf and strictly forbade to touch them. And to make it even more firm, she locked each of us in the restroom. This unexpected reaction surprised us all: we rarely received punishment from her, only as a last resort. From that time on, anyone who touched the tapes was locked in the restroom until the teacher let them go - usually a last resort against persistent bullies. But that only fueled our interest in the tapes. As soon as we mentioned them once, Aunt Sveta would run across the garden to make sure we didn't damage the tapes. Every time we watched cartoons, it was like the prison guards were supervising the prisoners.

More and more, more and more, we asked the kindergarten teacher to show us cartoons from the tapes she fought for. It took us a long time, and in December she gave in and decided to give us a session to watch the contents of the tapes. The teacher sat down next to us, put the tapes in the VCR and took the remote control. Her demeanor at that moment was very... strange: her finger was nervously tapping the rewind buttons, her gaze collected, like a falcon waiting for its prey to swoop down and grab it. The teacher was nervously swallowing saliva, her eyes watering from exertion, sweat flowing like the rivers of Babylon. Her posture was like a boxer's, waiting for the punch and then counterpunching. I tried to ask her, but she answered with the dryness of a sergeant: "I'm fine. Either watch the cartoon or leave." I continued to watch the cartoons, glancing nervously back and forth at her and the screen. The cartoons were quite peaceful, but starting with the second tape (I think it was "Little Red Riding Hood"), some infernal nonsense began.

First, the tape on the song of Little Red Riding Hood abruptly interrupted to record a New Year's matinee in kindergarten. As luck would have it, the teacher had run out of batteries in her remote control and it was impossible to rewind the tape to the moment she needed. She had to run to her office to change the batteries for new ones. She tried to run as if she knew what would happen after that moment. We watched, not understanding what would happen next - the matinee footage began to float and distort, the picture disintegrated into squares and artifacts of the recording. And then... then over the matinee footage came fragments of some horrible, distorted human figures speaking in voices that were not their own. They were thrashing, screaming, moaning.

After a while, these creatures disappeared from the screen and again the picture returned to the matinee footage, only to then abruptly interrupt to the already pornographic footage. I don't remember what exactly was there, but I remember that there was a very beautiful bed, as if from a movie about the XIX century, a man and a woman in masks from "Eyes Wide Shut" were lying on it and engaged in foreplay. All this action was interspersed with a text in a language I didn't know (but I think, as the teacher told us, it was French), but the voice of the announcer who read out the text was terribly dull and low, as if threatening. Everything except the bed, the man and the woman, and the nightstand was plunged into darkness, and these elements of the frame were brightly and brightly lit. Then the man pulled out a knife and plunged it into the eyes of his date. Blood from the eye rimmed the woman's body and their bed. It poured and poured, poured and poured, poured and poured - there can't be that much blood in a person! Then picture switched back to Little Red Riding Hood's song. The teacher looked at us with a slightly embittered look, as if to say to us, "This is not the end. Did you get what you wanted?". The whole group cried, and we were not calmed down. But we continued watching another tape.

The second tape was a recording from the so-called "Fall Festival." There were different years, and one of the montage fragments featured me and my kindergarten group. The tape was very pale, faded, as if it had been corroded in the processing. There were 3 voices in the background: one male and two female. They were commenting on the recording and saying: "See the pretty little girl in the pink dress on the left? Maybe her...", "there's the kid Spiderman, our main troublemaker, where the fuck should we put him?!", "there's a juicy chubby girl standing there by the tree. Mm-mm." The teacher looked at this video with the same equanimity and some sadism in our attitude. We were really scared, especially when we heard the comments against us. The voices were heavily distorted, which made them sound even more frightening.

The third cassette was a recording of the Soviet cartoon Treasure Island, but there was something wrong with it, too. Every five minutes for 10-20 seconds a picture of the Paradoxx album ([https://www.amazon.ca/Paradox-Album-666/dp/B00000AEI2](https://www.amazon.ca/Paradox-Album-666/dp/B00000AEI2)) by the band 666 appeared, as I found later, remembering this case. But the picture was darker at the edges, the face on it had red pupils and was splattered with something that looked like blood. The title song of the album itself was played in a minor tone and was slow. Toward the end of the cartoon, the same pornographic movie insert that was on the first tape reappeared. We squealed all over the kindergarten, and the teacher took us in a pile and said: "THIS IS YOUR PUNISHMENT. Curiosity killed the cat. You know what I mean, you little buggers? And not a word to anyone". No one dared to tell anyone about it.

Already in the spring, after this incident with the tapes, the teacher resigned from the kindergarten. And then it was closed. However, here is an interesting detail: shortly before the graduation from kindergarten, we were interviewed by a children's affairs inspector together with police officers. She asked if we had seen anything strange. We only pointed to the tapes, which were then confiscated. And when I was older and the Internet appeared, I accidentally found the news archive of our local newspaper, where it was written about my kindergarten, namely the news that the director was jailed for 5 years for abuse of power and organization of illegal video rental. According to the materials of the investigation, she used just these unfortunate tapes to organize the viewing of movies in private with the appropriate.... service. Further the investigation was behind closed doors, to which my mother (a lawyer by education responded) - the case is even tougher and more serious. Apparently, it was related to violence against someone. I don't really want to imagine what it could have been, but obviously the tapes were the tip of the iceberg of some criminal scheme, since they were so protected....
