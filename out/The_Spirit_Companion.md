Dave had always been fond of his cat, Whiskers. A sleek, black feline with eyes that seemed to pierce through the darkness, Whiskers had been his companion through many lonely nights. But lately, something felt off. Dave blamed it on the drinking at first, the blurry nights and foggy mornings, but a gnawing fear had begun to take root in his mind.

It started with the dreams. Dark, unsettling visions where he was lost in a maze of shadows, always feeling the presence of something malevolent just out of sight. But he could never decide which way to go in order to escape the maze. Each morning, he woke up more exhausted than the last, as if the dreams had been draining him. His drinking, a nightly ritual to drown out the memories of his failed marriage and dead-end job, did little to soothe him anymore. The job didn’t pay much, and Dave was dropping what little he had to spare on that night’s libations.

One night, after a particularly heavy binge, Dave awoke to find Whiskers sitting on his chest, staring down at him. The room was pitch-black, but Whiskers's eyes glowed with an eerie intensity. Dave tried to move, but his body felt like lead. The cat's weight was oppressive, and he could swear he felt his very essence being siphoned away.

In a panic, he threw Whiskers off and stumbled to the bathroom. There was a scattering of bottles from his night stand, the cat had made a ruckus escaping the situation. Dave’s reflection was gaunt, his skin pale and his eyes hollow. Dave shivered, blaming the alcohol and lack of sleep, but deep down, he knew something was terribly wrong.

Night after night, it got worse. Whiskers would sit closer, the dreams more vivid, and Dave's energy waning further. He tried locking Whiskers out, but the cat always found a way back in, curling up on his chest, eyes aglow. Desperation led Dave to drink more, trying to blot out the terror, but it only made the dreams more vivid, the fatigue more unbearable. Dave would plan his days so that he avoided the landlord and most of the mail, any chance of dealing with a neighbor was minimized. The bar next door became his home away from home.

One particularly dark night, Dave arrived home. He had been drinking at the bar to avoid his soul-stealing cat. He did not pay any attention to the eviction notice on his door. He was at the end of his wits and nearly incoherent from drink. He stumbled to bed and slumped into it. As he lay in bed, he felt Whiskers leap onto his chest, the familiar weight settling over him. Gathering his remaining strength, he grabbed the cat and looked into its eyes.

"You're... you're taking my soul," he slurred, his voice a mere whisper. Whiskers's eyes seemed to glow brighter, and for a moment, Dave thought he saw something—an intelligence, a malevolence—behind them.

But then, Whiskers spoke. Not in words, but in a voice that echoed inside Dave's mind. "I am not stealing your soul, Dave. I am trying to save it."

The revelation hit Dave like a tidal wave, drowning him in a realization that shattered his perception. He wasn’t the victim. He was the threat. The drinking, the dreams, the growing darkness inside him—it wasn’t Whiskers that was taking his soul. It was the bottle. Whiskers had been trying to intervene, to protect what was left of Dave's fading essence. Whiskers thought that if Dave had seen him enough, it would encourage Dave to snap out of it, to pick up those extra work shifts and make a better life for the both of them.

But Dave couldn’t see beyond the bottom of his empty bottle. As the truth settled in, Dave's grip on Whiskers loosened. Tears blurred his vision. He had been fighting the wrong battle all along. Whiskers nuzzled his face, and for the first time in weeks, Dave felt a glimmer of warmth.

But it was too late. His strength was gone, his soul too fractured to mend. The last thing he saw before darkness claimed him was Whiskers's glowing eyes, filled with a sorrowful resignation. The last thing he heard was the clattering of another empty bottle beside his bed.

The next morning, Dave's landlord found him, cold and lifeless, empty bottles by his side, bills overflowing in the mailbox. Dave’s eyes were wide, milky-hazed, blankly looking towards the ceiling. His skin, cold and pale, an arm reaching out beside him. Whether it was towards the cat or the bottle, no one could ever know.

Whiskers sat beside him, staring at the empty shell that had once been his friend, his PERSON, knowing that despite his efforts, he had failed to save him from the true demon within.
