I was hiking through the dense forest, the crunching of leaves beneath my boots the only sound to be heard. The sun was setting, casting long shadows over the trees, and I realized I had lost my way. Panic started to set in as I realized I was alone and lost in the wilderness.

Just as I was about to give up, I saw a flicker of light in the distance. Excited, I made my way towards it, hoping to find someone who could help me. As I drew closer, I saw that it was a small cabin, its windows glowing with a warm, inviting light.

I knocked on the door, and to my surprise, it creaked open. "Hello?" I called out, my voice echoing through the empty cabin. There was no response, but I could hear strange, muffled noises coming from inside. Cautiously, I stepped into the cabin and called out again.

That's when I saw them: three figures huddled in the corner, their backs turned to me. As I got closer, I realized they were covered in dirt and blood, their hair matted and tangled. Suddenly, they turned around, revealing their faces, which were twisted in a grotesque grimace.

I stumbled back, my heart racing with fear as the figures started moving towards me. I tried to run, but they were too fast, their hands grabbing at me, their nails digging into my flesh. I screamed for help, but no one answered, and I knew I was going to die.

Just when I thought it was over, the cabin door burst open, and a group of search and rescue workers rushed in. They subdued the figures, who turned out to be lost hikers who had been trapped in the cabin for days.

As they took me to safety, I couldn't shake the feeling that I had narrowly escaped a fate worse than death. From that day on, I never went hiking alone again, and I always made sure to stay on the beaten path. The memory of that terrifying encounter would haunt me for the rest of my life.

The rescue team wrapped me in a warm blanket and led me to safety. They explained that the hikers I had encountered had gone missing a week ago and were presumed dead. It was a miracle they had found them alive, albeit barely.

As we made our way back to civilization, I couldn't help but feel grateful for my life. I vowed to never take my safety for granted and to always be cautious when venturing into the unknown.

But as we reached the outskirts of the forest, a sense of dread washed over me. I turned back to look at the cabin and saw that it had vanished into thin air, leaving behind nothing but an empty clearing.

I shuddered, wondering if the hikers had been the only ones trapped in that cursed place. And as we drove away, I couldn't shake the feeling that I had narrowly escaped a fate worse than death, that something far more sinister was lurking in the shadows.

To this day, I avoid hiking in that forest, afraid of what other horrors it may hold. And every time I close my eyes, I see the twisted faces of those lost hikers, their eyes pleading for help, their bodies covered in dirt and blood. The memory of that terrifying encounter will haunt me for the rest of my days, a constant reminder of the darkness that lurks in the unknown...
