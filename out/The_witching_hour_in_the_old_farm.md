  
It was a dark and stormy fall night when I decided to explore the abandoned farm that lay on the outskirts of town. I had heard a lot about this place - rumors about inexplicable events and eerie occurrences that were said to have taken place within the walls of this dilapidated building.   
  
It was just before midnight when I made my way to the old farm. The wind howled through the trees, and the gloomy clouds in the sky did not allow any stars to shine through. I felt like I was immersed in a dark video game world where the inexplicable was waiting for me.  
  
I entered the abandoned building through the creaky door and immediately felt the temperature around me drop drastically. My heart began to beat faster, but I ignored the fear and pushed deeper into the farm. The light of my flashlight was my only companion in this darkness.  
  
In a room that had once served as a living room, I found dusty furniture and broken windows. Everything seemed abandoned and forgotten. Suddenly I heard a quiet whisper, as if someone was whispering right next to me. I froze in fear and slowly turned around but couldn't see anything.  
  
“You’re just imagining it,” I thought and continued my exploration. I climbed the creaky stairs to the first floor. The atmosphere became more and more oppressive. When I got to one of the bedrooms, I saw a door slowly open and squeak shut.  
  
My pulse was racing as I cautiously approached the door. When I opened it, I found myself staring into an empty room. But suddenly the door slammed shut with a loud bang and I was plunged into darkness. My flashlight flickered and went out. I felt trapped and lost in this room, as if the world was collapsing around me.  
  
Then I heard footsteps, quiet and eerie, approaching me. Every step echoed in the darkness. My heart was beating so loudly that I thought it was going to jump out of my chest at any moment. I fumbled for my phone and activated the flashlight function. The dim light illuminated the room and I could see shadowy figures.  
  
There were shadows, human-like figures moving around me. Their faces were unrecognizable, just dark silhouettes. I felt cold fingers slide over my skin and a touch of icy touch my face. The shadows seemed to surround me, pushing me further and further into a corner.  
  
Panic seized me and I ran out of the room, down the stairs and through the deserted hallways. The shadows followed me, their dark whispers echoing in my ears. I rushed out of the farm into the stormy night without looking back.  
  
Finally, as I stood at the edge of the farm, out of breath and completely exhausted, I took one last look back. The abandoned farm seemed quiet and lifeless, as if nothing had ever happened. But the memories of the eerie shadows and the whispers would haunt me forever.  
  
Since that night I have never set foot on the farm again. The Witching Hour at the Old Farm will forever be etched in my mind, and I will never forget that reality can sometimes be scarier than the worst horror games.
