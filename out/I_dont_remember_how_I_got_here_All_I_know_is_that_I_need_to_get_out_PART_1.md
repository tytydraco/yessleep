My name, or, rather, my assigned nickname is "**WELROD**".

I don't know why we have these, I guess it's just an anonymity-type deal.

We all have the same uniform: dark blue shirts, baggy pants, a pair of cheap-looking shoes and necessities, if they're needed, of course. Maybe a special item if you're lucky, but I'll get into that later.

As the title says, I don't remember how I got here. I don't remember entering this facility, don't remember signing a contract or anything like that. All I know is that I saw some weird leaflet somewhere and that's it. Absolutely nothing else.

The people I'm with don't remember either. Of course, they make up their own ideas and theories, but they get more and more absurd as time goes on. Anything - and I mean *ABSOLUTELY* anything - ranging from an alien kidnapping to a specific government agency testing us to find out which one of us sells illegal junk on the internet.

This mess first began when I woke up in a spacious, cold facility.

The walls seemingly made out of thin sheet metal, the ceiling depicting a fake, compressed sky.

There wasn't any furniture, nor were there any electronics, the only light source being the "sky".

I felt incredibly weak, but I still managed to blurt out a barely noticeable

*"What the hell is this place..?"*

before quickly passing out again.

A man with a messy side cut, dark hair and lapis blue eyes jostled me awake.

*"Hey, hey! Come on, hang in there! Apache, you gotta know CPR, help the new guy out!"*

he said, calling in a young, thin teen with a bowl cut and safety goggles on.

*"I don't know* ***EVERYTHING****, dude! Also, CPR only works on people who are drowning. Is this guy drowning?"*

Apache quickly and incoherently spouted.

*"What is happening...? Who are you people?!"*

I managed to get myself together, attempting to get more information from them.

*"Oh, you're awake! You're alive! Thank goodness! Oh, sorry, I got a bit off-track. To answer your question, my name's Kokoda, this is Apache, that guy over there is Krummlauf, he's a bit of a coward, and that other guy's name is... H-Henry, I think?"*

*"It's Hydeman."*

He answered in a rather monotonous voice.

*"The name's Hydeman. Been here forever. Don't know how to get out. Welcome to Hell."*

*"Oh, well, you don't have to be so tactless, do you?! We don't want... uhh... Mister Welrod over here to go insane right away like the other guy, do we, you imbecile?!"*

Kokoda angrily shouted, his voice endlessly echoing throughout the room.

*"Kokoda, you could potentially-"*

A meek voice replied from the corner.

*"Would you just SHUT UP already, Krummlauf?!"*

*"Why am I... Why are we here?"*

*"You tell me, dude! 'Cause we have absolutely no idea."*

Apache replied, wiping under his nose with his index finger, his nails crudely bitten off, his hands pale, yet quick and efficient.

*"It's probably some power-hungry megacorporation. That's the safest explanation anyway."*

Hydeman added, shrugging.

*"How do we get out of here then?"*

My heart kept beating faster and faster, my breaths shorter and shorter.

*"Welrod, Welrod, Welrod! Listen!"*

Kokoda snapped his fingers in rapid succession, wanting to get my attention as quickly as possible.

*"Teamwork makes the dream work, right? So, we just have to stick together and find a way out, alright?"*

*"Yeah, s-sure, I guess. Just let me get myself together and I'll-"*

*"What's your item?"*

Hydeman interrupted, tilting his head slightly to the left and approaching me, each step faster than the last.

*"What... item? What the hell are you talking about?"*

I blurted out, still dazed.

*"Check your pockets."*

I slapped my pockets and felt something inside one of them.

A decrepit-looking mobile phone with a cracked screen, along with a note saying

"**COMMS**"

taped to the back.

I turned it on, only to see Google Chrome as the only installed app.

The only Wi-Fi network available was called

"**CONGRATULATIONS**"

I typed in "COMMS" as the password and it worked, surprisingly enough.

I am now typing this out in r/nosleep as a way to document my journey through this facility. I don't know if I'll make it, but regardless, wish me luck.
