It was summer vacation and I was really excited to get some rest from the busy life of the big city. I didn't know how many of my friends had plans to go to even bigger riots like raves, I always refused and, of course, I invited them to spend at least a few days at the country house that I always went to on vacation, even though I knew that none of them would accept, I did my part.

There I was going along an uneven dirt road, breathing the sweet air of flower dew, with my motorcycle and in the company of Ali, my german shepherd, at his 12 years of life. My girlfriend, Brenda, usually came with me all the time, but one of the main reasons I want to spend a whole month in this end of the world is that we broke up. We had been together since elementary school, we had never dated anyone else, it had been a 15 years relationship and we had already planned several steps forward, but we ended up having a lot of differences in the last year — on an issue that doesn't matter now — and we decided that we weren't as compatible as we thought. Although we grew up together, we clearly didn't share all the views, it wouldn't be a big deal, but the arguments were eroding even the friendly relationship that blossomed in childhood. We decided to break up not to lose that, but it hurts a lot to lose who, for me, was the woman of my life, I just wanted to relive our best moments that were at the country house and try, finally, to move on.

Anyway, Ali always felt very comfortable in the countryside, he knew everything more than I did because he had already walked the entire length of the property. I arrived extremely willing to accompany him on his adventures, I didn't want to become depressed and cloistered thinking about Brenda. I promised myself that I would return home without regrets, without sadness, keeping only the good memories.

Unfortunately, it rained a lot all week, I couldn't go out with Ali, but, as usual, he was free to come and go as much as he wishes and he did so. There were days I was very worried about his delay to come home, until a thursday, he didn't come home at all, I waited on the porch, whistling and calling his name until 10 pm, but it was raining a lot and there was no chance of him hearing. It wasn't the first time he disappeared all day, but I never cared because he always comes back.

I decided to go to sleep about midnight, I looked out the window one last time and called his name and right on the horizon, coming out of a pile of bushes, there came Ali completely soaked, I decided I would leave him outside, I went to the kitchen and looked for his bed, a towel to dry him and his water and food. He seemed very agitated, he didn't want to be outside and it was very strange because it wouldn't be the first time. I understood, it was very cold inside, you may imagine outside. So I put him inside, trying to cover as much of the carpet as possible with cloths so he wouldn't touch it. 

He was always very obedient, he was trained by my grandfather who worked as a police dog trainer, I mean, he was a dog trained by a professional, he never disobeyed, he never broke rules, it didn't cross my mind that this night, after I entered in my room, all would change.

I couldn't sleep, something was bothering me, Ali's behavior wasn't normal, he howled, cried downstairs, I've never seen him so agitated in my life, he learned that he couldn't make noise at night, he always obeyed, but seemed to have forgotten. When it was half past 2am, I was woken up by a very loud knock right on my door, the second knock came and then the third one, something was hitting the door, I've always been the calm type in the middle of the storm, I calmly got up, walked without making any noise and I looked through the keyhole and there it was, Ali, it was hideous! He had no hair, his jaw looked twice as big, he was bleeding a lot from his head, he had clearly hurt himself by hitting the door. I wanted to cry and go to hug Ali, but I refused to believe that was him.

He went down the stairs at a completely abnormal speed, gave a terrifying scream when reached the bottom and then I heard a huge crash and the sound of glass breaking. I grabbed the only weapon I had, which was a tazer, and went down, avoiding any sudden movements, down there it looked like a slaughterhouse, a mess! there was leather, fur and blood all over the floor and even on the walls. The window had been completely smashed, glass fragments were everywhere, the carpet had scratches that looked like they had been made by a bear or a tiger.

I didn't even know where to start worrying, the only thing I thought was if that thing — which was once Ali — came back, maybe it could break down my door and I would be dead. I couldn't wait. I thought about calling the police, but I hadn't been hurt. I just took my motorcycle and left without even packing my things, I would return the next day with the police.  While I crossed the dirt road that connected the property with the avenue, I heard footsteps behind me, the taillights barely illuminated anything and I didn't even know if I wanted to see what it was. The steps came very close to me and I was racing 80KPH (50MPH), I couldn't understand it and I just wanted to get to the light and get out of that absolute darkness where you're very vulnerable.

The steps went silent after about 2 minutes, but I didn't slow down until I entered the city. It was three in the morning, I didn't want to make a fuss and wake everyone up. I simply went to my bedroom and slept very bad. The next day, coincidentally my grandfather, known as Cuba, was at home and I told him everything, he called the entire police battalion and we went there. I didn't understand how he had believed me so easily or why he called so many police officers, it seemed like we were going to war.

Arriving there, the scenery was as I had left it, but as it was night, the details were imperceptible, I finally got really scared as I saw the marks, the scratches, the huge hole that was dug right next to the house and, most importantly, the marks outside my bedroom door. I have to say how lucky I was, whatever had come with Ali was two or three knocks away from breaking down my door and tearing me apart like it did with the couch.

When I was going to the room I heard my grandpa telling to one of the battalion chiefs that he must to report the incident to the State, I giggled a bit and said

"that's an overreaction, isn't it, grandpa? The dog probably got a virus and had an outbreak. Reporting to the State is only in cases of risk to national security"
— do you think that a "virulent dog" that in the middle of an "outbreak" does everything you see here, runs at 80km/h and digs a hole 8 meters in diameter and 5 meters deep in minutes is not a risk to national security? — he replied

I never saw Ali again, in fact, I don't think Ali came back that fateful night. What I saw through the keyhole didn't even look like an animal, that void, expressionless look didn't remind me at all a lovely dog that loved the independence of the countryside and playing fetch.

Before leaving, I gathered up the few hairs that had not been taken by the police and decided to make a grave next to the house. When I finished covering the grave, I heard a bark a few meters in front of me, on the other side of the fence, when I raised my head, half of a face, which looked like a dog, was watching me in the middle of the bush. It was Ali, maybe not just him and the same expression of emptiness and hatred that I had seen the night before was there again.
