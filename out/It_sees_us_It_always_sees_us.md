Hi I'm 16 living with my mum and am British and live in a rural ish area its quiet and for the most part safe. 



I have a little sister and she's nothing but a cute monster with her toys and tantrums I love her or loved her.until he took it from us  I'm going to ask you guys to take a seat or stand whatever you prefer this may be a long story.


It was a friday we had just finished off school and I was done with high school ready to work full time I arrive home and my sister was off sick. Weird I thought she was fine this morning watching bluey and  eating pancakes. I asked what's up with her and rather worried in cold tone my mum replied 
She's sick 
I asked her sick with what the flu? Common bug? Anything no reply just my mum's dry face staring at me. I thought not much off it and walked away and got on the playstaion.



Must have been hours as the sun has just been tucked into bed with its horizon line blanket. I went down stairs my mum and sister gone my brother had a party and my other sister was with my cousins for a play date. Let me put some names to people for you.


My sick sisters only 3 and called Rose 
My other sisters are 6 8 years old and are at a play date there not important neither is my brother who's called Oscar and is at party.


Rose and my mum were gone. It was strange It wasn't like them to vanish without a shout that there nipping out. I walk into the kitchen hungry after a few hours of beating my friends online. A note. A single note left for me on the kitchen table I grab it and the words i read struck fear into me. "He made Rose sick you need to stop him"


I was lost confused. Who's "He" how did he make her sick. I panicked and called my mum.  She answered nit instantly but rather hastley "hey mum" I said not expecting the reply I received. 
"Your mother's busy" I almost dropped the phone in pure shock. This must be him the one who got Rose sick. Almost instantly i snapped 
"WHERES MY MUM AND ROSE YOU SICK FUCK"


No reply but a evil laugh. Calm down the man said calmly there safe with me. He repeated those words everytime I asked a question. There safe with me. Almost minutes later he said "Rose isn't sick" I was confused but still listened. She isn't sick she's happy with her new family. That's when he turned the camera on...



My little sister running around playing happily but not with toys no far from toys in her hand cluched in a fist was a knife and below he'd lay dead people and  she was stabbing away at there corpses. I took the phone away from my face and hung up. The police didn't even cross my mind they would call me insane. I pondered my ideas what could I do.


Time passed 



PING PING 


My phone. A short but horrified text followed by an image come save us we need your help 
A picture of my mum and sister in a room basement I believed but they looked happy. No this couldn't be right my mum's all about supporting people in need never would she kill anyone. Another PING a location come get us...


I couldn't leave them with "him" I grabbed the biggest knife and gently pushed it up my sleeve. I would save them. I walked through woods and across roads for what felt like centuries and eventually found it. A cabin.
I saw the door slightly cracked open. I took a deep breath shaking in terror and walked in. It was dark cold and... coveted in a shimmering layer of red rose like blood. This was fresh. I scurried around and found the stairs in the grand living room I knew when I grabbed them I could leave be safe. There he was. Sat in a chair waving at me.


"I've kept my eye on you for a long time" instantly something in my head clicked. My room no my house has always had a feeling of being watched but I didn't think of it all thst much I didn't believe in monsters and had a bat in my room foe intruders. In a shakey breath muttered " have you been watching us"
No reply but a head nod still waving. He looked human but he seemed off a normal human would be scared of a knife this size it can shatter cow bones and his aswell. He was not scared. Not at all. "Give my family back what did you do to them"


Suddenly he lunged for me his face turned to something best described as a tentacle he tried it shove it down my throat. Possess me. I swung with the knife and missed but he lunged back. I ran for him and it went black. I had closed my eyes and opened them to the shadowed man stood with no injures but seemed to be in pain.


'How dare you" he groaned "I am your new father don't disrespect me" I shouted back that he isnt and swung more he wouldn't die. Multiple cuts across his body yet he still lived. He still stood and walked despite the stabs and slashes. 

He used that tentacle of his to grab the knife and toss it aside I panicked and fell. I crawled over to the knife when he pinned my down with his tentacle no tentacles he had more out his shoulders and hips now. 


He asked me to join them and be happy I refused I was sobbing at this point I saw the knife inches away if I lunged just maybe I could get it what else could I do. I threw myself towards the knife and plunged it into his fog like mouth he screamed and fell he dead he was alive but stunned slowed for a time. I took my knife back and sliced ajd stabbed his back.


No blood ever leaked out of him he was clearly not human just a shadow. I took this time and ran to my mum and sister knife clenched in fist. They had tentacles in their mouths I already horrified and adrenaline taking over removed them from my mum and sister they gasped and screamed looking st the dead body's and blood everywhere. On me. Among the fight I had been cut alot bleeding down my arms and legs I didn't even notice until I saw it. Blood ran down my body as hot painful agony washed over me. I don't have time for pain I grabbed my mum and sister and turned for the stairs. At the top of the stairs he stood. Staring at me. At us.


I screamed and closed my eyes and he muttered his last words " you will be back soon I'm watching" 


We walked home all three of us horrified by the scene we watched unfold. We didn't tell my other sisters about this or brother. Not even the police they would call me insane us insane. 


I still see him staring at me at night I barley sleep afraid of the tentacle he may put in my mouth. Making me a host for his next child almost. I googled what to do and my house is getting blessed hopefully it will go away.


Please If you know what it is tell me I need answers I sit her now awaiting the night. 
I'll see him again I always do
He's always watching 
Always.
