Hi, my name is unimportant. I was recently going through my late grandma's house, as we are planning on selling it. Shame, because I like the house, but I can't take it, I'm only 16. Anyway, I found a box of VHS tapes in the basement. The box was hidden in a wall that had progressively broken down over time. The box was labeled "1978-1990 work tapes - DESTROY IMMEDIATELY -- DO NOT KEEP" I showed the box to my mom, who had no idea what they were. So I decided to take them home.

&#x200B;

So here I am at home, I just popped the first VHS tape in. It was labeled 1978-iNTRODUCTION. It had nothing else on it, just those words and numbers. I'll give you the play by play and transcript here.

&#x200B;

So it starts with a company logo. iCARUS inc. The logo kind of looks like the current day Philadelphia Flyers logo, in that it is a slanted I with wings on the left side. 

As the logo is on screen, a couple synth chords are played, and a cheery robotic woman voice says

"Icarus Incorporated, we go to the ends of the earth for our customers, even to our detriment!"

&#x200B;

The titlecard has an unusually long \~17 second fade to an empty room. Room is generous, this place is as big as a warehouse. A guy walks from behind the camera with a metal folding chair. He walks an unreasonable distance, unfolds the chair, and puts it down. He then sits on the chair. The camera adjusts its position and zooms in on him. Surprisingly, the zoom is really good, I can make out most of his facial features, accounting the low quality of the tape.

&#x200B;

The man is good looking and well dressed. he is in a black suit, white undershirt, noticeably dark collar stays I can see through his shirt, blood red tie. Black dress pants, and shoes that clacked on the floor as he walked. He has a 5 oclock shadow and a killer smile that as he looks into the camera. Something is off with his face though, in spite of the low quality I can tell he is smiling with his mouth, but his eyes don't reflect the smile. He is sweating. he begins to speak.

&#x200B;

"Good morning America and the rest of the world! We here at Icarus Industr-(there is an unintelligible voice from behind the camera)- sorry, Icarus Incorporated have been working on something we are very proud of. After pioneering cordless tools, calculators, and ATMs, we would enjoy announcing our next foray. We have started the engineering of arti-"

&#x200B;

I should note, around when the man starts talking about cordless tools, we can hear footsteps walking away from the camera, and as he says "engineering", we hear a door open and close. The man takes a large breath, seemingly out of relief. His face gets more serious, and he starts talking again.

&#x200B;

"America, fuck it, whoever is watching this, you are in danger. My name is M-\*REDACTED\*-nson and I don't know how much longer the world will last. If you are watching this in anywhere past 2017 and you are human, you are lucky. I can't explain exactly what I mean right now, there is not enough time, but I promise as you watch these tapes, you will understand. That is, if I am not killed before I get all of these made. Please, if you are watching this, do not keep quiet. Speak out against Icar-"

(by redacted, I mean literally it was bleeped like he said a curse word)

Suddenly the video cuts to a happy looking reporter who looks like he could be Jon Hamm's brother. He is holding a microphone, but as he is talking, he moves the mic around with no disparity in the volume of his voice. He is on an assembly line, and he starts talking.

&#x200B;

Reporter: "Are-are you recording? Is it-are we live? I swear to god john, I cant-"

John, I guess: "Damn it marc, we're live!"

Marc: "Oh-  Hi, I'm Marcus Vanaman, and you're watching channel 27 news, live on NDMNBC - National Domestic Media News Broadcasting Company! Today, we are on site at Icarus Industries, ready to interview some of the workers that labor tirelessly here to get us what we want!!"

&#x200B;

Marc and John walk over to one of the assembly line workers. They get the workers attention, who turns around and takes off his ear protection. The worker is the most straight faced person I have ever seen, there is no soul behind those two eyes, and his expression is that of a soldier at attention. His stare at Marc could cut a diamond. I should mention, as the interview goes on, the footage starts to glitch. I'll point it out when it happens.

&#x200B;

Marc: "Good afternoon sir, what is your name?"

Worker(heavy monotone): "incorporated."

Marc: "Uh... excuse me?"

Worker: "you said iCARUS industries. it is iCARUS incorporated."

Marc: "Oh, I'm sorry, I must have misspoke, heh, though I didn't think you could hear me. Anyway, what is your name?"

Worker: "it does not mat-t--t-t-t--t-t--t-t- (A glitch happens as the workers eyes shift from Marc to the camera, causing his eyes to move from marc to the camera back to marc etc) -at my name is (footage returns to normal, but now there is a worker in the background staring directly into the camera) you will not be here much longer."

Marc: "Oh, um, ok? Well, do you like working at Ica-r-rr--r-r--r-r-r-r--r-r-r- (as marc speaks, he raises his arm to scratch his neck, but the footage glitches as his arm reaches his neck, bouncing his arm between his collarbone and neck, as the footage returns to normal, there are now \~10 workers in the background, staring at the camera) -corporated? Haha, got it right this time, eh?"

The worker does not react to his joke

Worker: "iCARUS incorporated has provided me with opportunities most could only dream of. my entire life has been dedicated to iCARUS from the moment i was created."

Marc starts to speak, but the worker swings what I think is a wrench at him, the footage cuts before he makes connection.

&#x200B;

The footage cuts back to The Man from the beginning. There are tears down his cheek, and the room he is in is a lot darker. The camera is intensely zoomed on his face, farther in than I thought any camera could. There is a bright red alarm flashing at the back of the room, but there is no audible alarm. The man starts to talk, frantically, desperately. His voice gradually gets more distorted.

&#x200B;

"PLEASE, PLEASE, THIS IS NOT FAKE, YOU ARE IN DANGER, YOU WILL DIE. THIS IS NOT A JOKE. THEY ARE COMING AFTER ME, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE."

&#x200B;

A door opens, slow footsteps approach. Like, really slow footsteps. The Man immediately gets up and starts to run, he trips over his chair, but gets up and continues running. He runs the opposite direction of the camera, the sound of the slow footsteps getting gradually louder. The Man makes it to the back of the room and throws a door open and exits. I finally get to see what is making the footsteps as the camera zooms out. 

&#x200B;

It looks like a man, making intent limping movement. The weird thing is, he's on fire. I don't know what is happening. The guy on fire makes it to the upturned chair, and turns around. I get to see his burned face/skull and his eyes, his inhuman bright red eyes. As the video slowly fades back to the titlecard from the opening, the guy on fire says one word. "iCARUS"

&#x200B;

Those synth chords come back, almost like the cutoff frequency is raised. The cheery robotic lady voice starts taking again.

&#x200B;

"iCARUS Incorporat-te-te-te-te-ted, please, j-j-j-join us-s-s and follow al-long."

&#x200B;

Then the tape ends.

&#x200B;

I am shaken up, I have no idea what the fuck I just watched. There are tapes left, I will update you on them, but just give me a little bit of time, I need to process whatever the fuck I saw.

&#x200B;

If you don't get and update in the next month, well I guess I died according to The Man in the video.
