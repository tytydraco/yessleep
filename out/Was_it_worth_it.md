I am a scientist. Or at least, I used to be. But something changed during the Hyperion test. Something irreversible. And now I don’t even know if I qualify as human.

I know how that sounds. But I’m not here to convince you—I just need to tell someone. Anyone. Before whatever’s inside me finishes what it started.

The day began like most do in Chicago—gray, buzzing, tired. I woke up from a dream I can’t fully remember. Only fragments remain: warm sunlight, laughter, my mother’s voice. It was a cruel contrast to the morning that greeted me. My apartment was cold. My limbs ached. I dressed in silence, shivering as I pulled on my lab coat. A high-end one, supposedly. Though after so many years in the field, even prestige feels like polyester and lint.

I skipped breakfast. Nerves, maybe. Or maybe some part of me knew. I drank stale coffee from a cracked mug and stepped outside.

The city was a living thing. Cabs blared. Crowds swelled. Skyscrapers clawed the sky. Most people rushed around me, blind to the leviathan sleeping beneath their feet. Hyperion. Our magnum opus. A particle accelerator hidden in the guts of Chicago, built to simulate the earliest birth pangs of the universe. Our goal? Recreate a Big Bang—just on a smaller scale.

The test was that morning. Years of work, billions of dollars, and sleepless nights culminating in one moment.

I should’ve been ecstatic. But instead, as I neared the lab’s steel-and-glass entrance, a pressure bloomed in my gut. Like my body was warning me to turn back. I ignored it. Told myself it was excitement.

The lab was alive with anticipation. Halls glowed sterile white, filled with the low thrum of servers and hushed conversation. As I reached the observation level, I spotted Mitch, clipboard in hand, grin plastered across his face.

“Morning, John,” he said. “Ready to make history?”

I smiled, though it felt brittle. “All systems green?”

“Shelly just finished the final diagnostics downstairs. Should be back any second.”

The lab beyond the viewing window shimmered with soft blue lights. Rows of control panels flickered. Cables snaked across the floor like veins in a giant, sleeping beast. When Shelly emerged from the side door with a thumbs-up, the room sprang to life.

“All right,” Mitch said, voice buzzing through the intercom, “commencing test one of Project Hyperion. Please step back from the glass.”

The accelerator’s hum crawled through the walls. My fingertips tingled. The air thickened, charged. I could feel the machine waking up.

“Five…”

My breath caught in my throat.

“Four…”

My nails dug into the foam of my armrest.

“Three…”

Sweat pooled at the small of my back.

“Two…”

My heart was thunder.

“One.”

BOOM.

Everything went black.

But it wasn’t unconsciousness—not truly. It felt more like falling out of reality.

When my senses returned, I was… nowhere. Suspended in a void that pulsed with red and black. The sky was a swirling mess of maroon clouds and a bloated black star that throbbed like a wound. Beneath me, a crimson ocean rolled, thick as blood and just as ominous.

I tried to move. My limbs didn’t respond.

I looked down—and screamed. My legs were gone, replaced by a tapering, muscular tail that writhed in the air like a severed nerve. My arms ended in elongated claws, glistening black and insectile. My skin sagged and rippled, gelatinous. I reached for my face and felt wet folds, soft and melting. My mouth—my mouth was gone.

I floated. A deformed mutation of the man I’d once been.

And then I saw them.

The eyes.

Enormous, lidless orbs hovered just beyond the clouds. Miles wide. Pitch black. Watching with the kind of indifference that made prayer feel ridiculous. As the clouds parted, the rest of the thing emerged. A body too vast for sanity. Crimson scales that shimmered like burning coals. Limbs—if you could call them that—spiraled with tendrils and teeth. Its mouth opened wide, wider than physics should allow, and the black mist that poured out carried the stench of rot and ozone.

I was pulled toward it.

I fought. Clawed. Screamed silently. But resistance meant nothing.

Its teeth weren’t teeth. They were monoliths—towers of yellowed bone that scraped the heavens. I slipped between them and into the dark.

Inside its mouth, it wasn’t dark at all. It was alive.

Tentacles slithered from the walls. Each ended in a sucker-like mouth ringed with glinting, obsidian fangs. They latched onto me, biting, gnawing, burrowing. My flesh—or what used to be my own flesh—peeled away in wet chunks. One sank its fangs into my skull. All I could think of was my own regret. I had failed, my vision, my dream had completely and utterly failed. I did not even question my own situation. I merely accepted.

Just as the pain became unbearable, I awoke.

In Colorado.

The plains stretched endless and golden. The sky hung gray and low. My legs were back. My skin was whole. Ahead stood my childhood home—paint peeling, porch sagging. And through the window… her.

My mother.

She stood at the stove, humming. The scent of chicken pot pie drifted into the air—my favorite. She had been gone for three years. Kidney cancer. Quick and cruel. I missed her last breath by twelve hours. A snowstorm, the biggest Chicago had seen in the past decade, had delayed my flight. I should’ve flown out sooner. Hyperion was too demanding a project. I was always needed, always pushing the extra mile. I’d always felt a bit of guilt, as if my own ambitions let my mother die alone. Questions always gnawed at me. What were her last words? Would my presence have eased her passing? 

These questions ate at me as I stepped onto the porch. I knocked.

She didn’t respond.

I opened the door. It gave way with a familiar creak.

“Mom?” I called.

She turned. Same soft face. Same gentle smile.

But the warmth wasn’t there. Her eyes were wrong. A shade too dark. Her smile bent just slightly in the middle, as if being held in place by wire.

“John,” she said, voice melodic but hollow. “It’s been so long. Did your project work?”

She came closer. I backed away.

“What’s wrong?” she asked. “Don’t recognize your own mother?”

Her face sagged. Her arms lengthened. Claws split from her fingertips. Her legs fused into a tail. The skin melted, drooped. She became me.

A grotesque mirror of what I’d become.

“The project worked, right?” it—I—whimpered. “We succeeded, didn’t we?”

Then came the tendrils. The gnashing mouths. They tore me apart—my reflection, my guilt, my sin.

“Was it worth it?” it choked before being dragged into the wall.

The house began to collapse. The walls pulsed like a dying heart. I sank to the floor, cold and shaking. Maybe this was my punishment. A tomb shaped like memory.

Then—

I woke up.

Back in the lab. Flat on the floor. Mitch hovered above me, grinning like a lunatic.

“John! Holy hell, you scared us! You passed out. But listen—we did it. The data’s off the charts. This… this is Nobel prize territory!”

He helped me to my feet. My knees wobbled.

“We did good, right?” I asked. “Was it worth it?”

He blinked, confused. “Of course. For a discovery this big? I’d do it ten times over.”

He meant it.

I walked outside. The sun was out now. Life resumed. Nothing had changed.

Except me.

Now, I can’t sleep more than a few hours without seeing it. The thing in the sky. The tendrils. Myself—melting, screaming.

And here’s the part that scares me most: the energy readings we pulled from that first test… They don’t match anything in the known universe. Not even quantum anomalies. Not even chaos theory.

It’s like the machine opened a door to someplace else entirely. A quick glance into another plane of existence.

And I think—whatever it was—looked back. Whatever window we opened, it worked both ways.

So if I seem normal—laughing, working, drinking coffee—know this:

I am not human anymore. I’ve become a husk, an entity assuming an echo of a name.

And every night, just before I close my eyes, I hear the echo of a question I’ll never stop asking.

Was it worth it?
