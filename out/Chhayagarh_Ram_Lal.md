It just would not go away.

While Ram Lal was busy cooking, Bhanu and I busied ourselves in attempting to get the sludge from the man outside off my clothes. While it wasn’t debilitating any longer, the smell was like someone had stuffed a dead rat inside used gym clothes and left it there for a week. The slimy marks seemed almost alive under the dim light, shifting and wriggling as they attempted to eat through the fabric. However much we attempted to wipe them off, they wouldn’t budge.

“Leave it, *babu*,” Ram Lal called from the stove. “It will disappear by itself in a few hours though it will damage the clothes. Your father also had many run-ins with those things in his time. Ruined more than fifteen perfectly good *kurtas*.”

I touched my shoulder, still iced over. The massive ragged hole in the shirt left by the creature had already consigned it to the waste pile, so I supposed it didn’t matter anymore. “This was pretty expensive.”

Ram Lal waved a hand dismissively. “Oh, money’s dirt. You can buy ten thousand like it any time you want. Your life is what is important. Irreplaceable, in fact.”

“That’s what they keep telling me.”

Ram Lal finished stirring and put a lid on the pot, standing and crossing over to us. “The food will be ready soon. It is my honour to feed you in my humble abode.”

I raised a hand to supplicate him. “Please, don’t embarrass me anymore. Take a seat.”

He nodded and began to sit on one of the cushions.

“Hold on.” I got off the chair, leaving it to him. “It’s your house, after all.”

He and Bhanu looked at each other. “You are the *Thakur*, *babu*. We are your subjects. How can we sit on a chair while you sit on the ground? It is not right.”

I shrugged. “Alright. I’ll stand then.”

Ram Lal let out a shocked choking noise and fell at my feet. “Please don’t make me commit this sin, *babu*. You are my guest, my *jajman*. How can I make you stand in my house while I sit?”

“Okay, okay.” I extricated myself and resumed my seat. “Happy? I’m just not comfortable with towering above you like this.”

“Then you will have to get used to it, *babu*.” Ram Lal sat down, finally satisfied, and folded his hands together. “You have stood as a wall between us and… them, for centuries. Your sacrifices, your victories, are the stuff of legend. Your presence towers over us, and it always will.”

I sighed. “I don’t know if I can live up to your expectations, Ram Lal.”

He chuckled a little. “I have heard this exact sentence from your father, my father from your grandfather, and my grandfather from his father before him. You will rise to the occasion. I am sure of it.” His smile turned into a slight frown. “But sending you here, unprepared and unguarded… Maybe your family is not aware yet, busy as they were with your grandfather’s last rites.”

“Not aware of what?” I frowned. Beneath his easygoing exterior, my uncle was extremely methodical. I did not expect that anything had escaped his notice.

“The estate boundaries, my lord. Someone keeps vandalizing them. Stealing charms, scratching out sigils. Once or twice, we even found symbols of dark rites being conducted. The *lathials* repair the damage as and when they can, but the boundaries have been steadily weakening with time. Creatures like that *pisach* would not be able to enter this deep into your lands while your grandfather was still alive.”

Strange people have been entering the village, like my uncle said. Maybe they were responsible for this too. “Was the family not informed?”

“Maybe the guards wanted to avoid a scolding, *babu*. After all, they are responsible for regularly patrolling the walls. But they often sleep on duty or miss the patrol timings.”

“I see.” I would have to raise this issue with my uncles. “Thank you for telling me about this, Ram Lal. I want you to keep an eye out going forward. Anything goes wrong anywhere, you’ll come straight to me.”

He nodded. “Of course, *babu*.” He glanced momentarily at my injured shoulder. “Do you… feel fine? I can send Bhanu to the doctor and get some medicine for the pain.”

The makeshift bandage had dulled the pain completely by now. All I felt was a slight chill, like pressing an ice pack against a bruise. “I’ll be all right. Do you know anything about… that thing?”

“The villagers call it the *bhuka pisach*, *Thakur*. Hungry ghoul. I do not know when or how it came here, but my great-grandfather used to tell me stories about it. It has been on the land for a long time. But it usually hunts in the early morning or in the evening. This is the first time I have seen it during noon. I was chopping some wood outside when I saw it coming down the road, so I quickly tied the wheat to my door and hid inside. Then, a few minutes later, I saw Bhanu and you. I wanted to warn you, but before I could, it was upon you.”

The rules were changing. Everything was in upheaval. Just as the Ferryman had said.

“I survived because of you, and because of Bhanu. Thank you.”

Bhanu folded his hands. “We will lay our lives down for you, *Thakur*. I only regret that I could not return sooner. You were injured in my care.”

Ram Lal nodded. “If you must thank anyone, thank the lady, *babu*. We were merely doing our duty.”

“The lady, yes!” I practically jumped on the thread. “What can you tell me about her?”

Before any of you start your Lady in White x OP fanfics in the comments, I was just eager because I wanted to know where exactly she stood. Was she going to backstab me? Did she have an agenda? Was she actually, legitimately in love with me or something? That would be creepy, given she knew me when I was a kid. Either way, I just didn’t know. Any information would be useful.

Like any good old person, once Ram Lal got to talking, it was difficult to stop him. Apparently, the Lady appeared relatively recently in the village, during a particularly cold winter in the 19^(th) century. No one is sure if she’s a ghost or some other monster wearing a human form, but what is known is that she stalked the village from dusk till dawn every night, hunting and killing humans.

“What kind of humans?” I asked, “Anyone she could find?”

“Anyone who was unlucky enough to find her on the streets. And, if a single man living alone ever slept with a window or door unlocked in the house, she would enter and take his life away. Her victims were found in the morning, frozen to death without a sign of struggle.”

“Was there nothing we could do?”

“Your ancestors tried many rituals to placate her, and when those failed, to bind or scare her away. None of them worked for long. The only people she would not attack were the *Thakurs* and their families, who were protected by their ancient powers. The rest of us had to stay indoors as soon as evening fell, with every door locked and every window barred, lest the lady come for us.”

“But there are people out there on the streets nowadays, even late in the night. What changed?”

Ram Lal smiled. “You did, *Thakur*.”

“I don’t understand.”

“I still remember the day you were born very well. The birth happened here, on the estate. It was night-time, so there was no way to leave the manor and take your mother to the hospital. Lots of things stalked the village in those days. For a few decades, the tides of power had turned. The other side weighed heavy on our own, and everything was spiralling out of control. The family was stretched thin just making ends meet. Even on that very day, your father was not with his wife, but out on the streets with his brothers, doing what he could to save our lives. Only your grandfather and grandmother were there. And me.” He looked up at the ceiling, almost transported to the scene. “The power had gone out again. I was running the maids back and forth, fetching blankets, water, and candles. Whatever was required. It was a difficult birth. She screamed so loudly that I thought my ears might burst in that small bedroom. Then, at the stroke of midnight, just when I thought it would never end, you were born.”

Bhanu was holding on to his *gamcha*, almost as attentive as I was.

“Your first cry… It reverberated throughout the land. To this day, every man, woman, and child in the village who was alive then swears they heard it, even miles away. It was as if something in you had shaken the very foundations of the place. Something like that had never happened. Not with your father’s birth, and from what I can tell, not with any *Thakur* before him.” Ram Lal exhaled. “That night, the lady came to the manor. Your grandparents had left with your mother for the hospital, now that you were safe. Apparently, the entire village was calm that night, calmer than it had been in years. The other servants had also gone to sleep. I was left to watch over you, but somehow, I dozed off from exhaustion. When I snapped awake, it was close to dawn. Frost was spreading over the walls. The window was ajar, its lock somehow broken. And there, over your little cot, the lady was bending down. Reaching for you.”

He touched his chest, his hand trembling slightly. “Even after so many years, I remember the dread that settled in my chest. There was nothing I could do to stop her, nothing in my knowledge that could save you from her. Only one thought ran over and over in my head: I had failed. The *Thakur* and his sons would return to find their heir dead. All I could think to do was to let her kill me before the guilt did. So, I started to struggle to my feet, grabbing a vase off a table. The only weapon I could think of.”

He paused for a moment, staring off into the distance.

“What then?” Bhanu prompted before I could. Clearly, his father had not told him this story before.

“Then, as the lady reached for you, peering closer and closer, you reached up and grabbed her finger. And you laughed. That stopped both her and me dead in our tracks. For what felt like an eternity, you both looked at each other, and I stood there, vase in hand. All of us, frozen. Then, something happened that I had never seen before. Just as the first rays of the dawning sun peeked through the open window, she smiled. Then, she disappeared, melting into the light.” He sighed. “Since that night, she never hunted again. The fortunes of the village turned around. The spawns of the shadows were slowly pushed back to where they belonged. Trouble remained, of course, but for the first time in a long time, we were gaining ground. And it was all thanks to you.”

“Me?”

“You were… special, somehow. A good luck charm. Your very presence gave us hope, gave us power, in a way no one else, not even the *Thakur* himself, could. Even when your father left with you a short while later, your light lingered on, and there was peace.”

“But the lady and I… we met again, didn’t we?”

“You did. While you lived here, she came every night to the manor, and she played with you till sunrise. I was asked by your grandfather to watch her, just in case, but she never tried to harm you. Both of us had many sleepless nights because of her. Even after you left, whenever you returned to the village, she would find you and keep you company whenever she could. Your father did not like it, but there was no keeping her away. You two were inseparable, always hand in hand. Your grandfather on the other hand, the pragmatic man that he was, didn’t mind at all. As long as it kept her from hurting people. After you left the village for the last time, just before your father died, no one ever saw her again. Until now.”

“The lady almost never appears during the day,” Bhanu chimed in.

“Yes. The only times she has appeared have been with you. You only.”

“I see. Is there anything else you can tell me?” I asked.

“That is everything I know about her, *babu*.” Ram Lal pondered for a while before nodding. “Nothing else.”

Before I could press him further, the pot on the stove made some noises that, at least to Ram Lal, indicated that the food was done. The next few minutes were a blur of arranging utensils and serving food. To be honest, his story had left me with more questions than answers. Why exactly was my birth such a big deal? Why did the lady come to me that night when she never normally attacked my family? What exactly about the laughter of a baby not even a day old changed her mind? Hell, how could I laugh that early as a baby?

Ram Lal wouldn’t be able to give me those answers. I would have to find them on my own. Starting from the journal Grandfather had left me. Therefore, as we ate, I decided to change the topic to why I had come here in the first place.

“Enough about that, then.” I poked at the food gingerly, checking the heat. “Tell me about my grandfather, Ram Lal. Did you see anything, hear anything, that I should know? Anything at all?”

In sharp contrast to me, he effortlessly dug his hands into the steaming food and popped a morsel into his mouth, chewing slowly as he thought. “I left the *Thakur*’s service about three months before he died. My son, Bhanu, is the one who saw him in his final days.”

“I know. But you knew him for the longest time. Was there any change in his behaviour? Any signs?”

“There is always something wrong in Chhayagarh, *babu*. Even at the best of times, we can hardly catch a break. I can hardly recall a time when your grandfather was not spending long hours in his study, poring over a new situation and how to solve it. But in those last few months… it got worse. It all started after the strange outsiders started showing up. Even after he barred them from our lands, he was always worried and pensive. As if he was waiting for something to happen. He began spending every night in his study, hardly sleeping for an hour or two. His health began to suffer. *Maa Thakrun* tried to get him to take care of himself, but he was insistent. He had to be prepared, he said. Every day, he made me drop off at least five letters for his lawyers. He also made sure to write to you once a week, though no reply ever came.”

I squirmed, suppressing my embarrassment with a mouthful of food. It was a simple *khichdi*: rice and lentils cooked together with vegetables. Cheap and light. Working man’s food.

“Did you see what he wrote in his letters for the lawyer?”

“No, *babu*. Even if I did, I cannot read English.”

“I see.” I would have to ask Durham about that.

“But I do remember one thing.” He perked up. “A parcel that came in with the bus, a week or two before I took my leave. It was a small journal. From that day onwards, the tall man in the cloak came to the manor every evening, and sat with your grandfather in the study. I once went in to serve him his tea. There, I saw them…”

“What were they doing, Ram Lal?” I pushed, noting his hesitation.

“I saw a terrible thing, *babu*. The man was… holding your grandfather’s hand over the journal, his nails digging into his wrist until they drew blood. And, with his own blood, your grandfather was drawing strange letters and symbols on the page. After he completed each line, he would rub some strange liquid over it from a bottle, and the blood turned black, like ink.”

“What kind of liquid?”

“I have never seen it before, or since, and I have seen many things working for the family.” He stared at the wall, trying to recall. “It was purplish, with black and white spots swimming inside. The entire room was full of a sickly-sweet stench that I am sure belonged to it. It was a few minutes before he saw me standing there, absorbed as he was. When he did, he reacted like he never had before, practically shooing and shouting me out of the room.”

He looked up at me, his eyes wide. “He had never kept secrets from me before. I have been with him for decades, *babu*. He had never hidden anything from me. But that day, he did. I understood then that something must be very wrong.”

“Then why did you leave?”

He gave me a small smile. “I am not as strong as I used to be. My bones are weak and old. I knew that I could not help him face what was coming. Bhanu is a young man, strong and energetic. I thought he could be of more use. So, I asked to be excused. But I suppose it didn’t matter in the end.”

“Can’t you tell me anything about what happened to upset him like this? No guesses?”

“I could not say, *babu*. He had become secretive, suspicious. Of everyone. He did not even discuss it with your uncles, and he had always trusted them with their duties. The only time I had ever seen him this distraught was many years ago, during your final visit here. The day your father saw something.”

My father. He had done something similar, before he died: he did not discuss what he had seen with anyone. Not even his brothers or his mother. The only people who knew were my mother, and my grandfather. Mostly the latter.

“Do you know something about that then? About what my father saw?”

“Not directly, no.” He hesitated before continuing. “But the night that it happened, I was there, waiting outside the study. I used to do that whenever the family was working on a problem, in case something was required. I did not hear nor understand all of it, but I caught some snatches of what they discussed.”

I leaned forward, keeping the food aside. “Go ahead.”

“He had found something in the woods, in the backends of the estate. Some sort of curse, or monster, or something similar. I could not make out the words exactly. It sounded like they were expecting to find it, but it was much more powerful than they had expected. The villagers that had gone with your father were all killed. Down to a man. Your father had managed to get away, but the beast had kept something… important. He knew he was a dead man walking. That’s what he told your mother and your grandfather. That he would die soon, and there was nothing they could do to stop it.”

“A monster?”

“It sounded like no creature I have ever seen on this land. Your father was undoubtedly the best hunter in the family. Only one of his brothers came close. If even he could not bring it down…”

“This thing… what did it take from him? What was so important that it killed him to lose it?”

He shook his head. “I could not make it out exactly, but it sounded like… fate. It took his fate.”

“His fate?” I could not stop the incredulity from creeping into my voice.

“I do not understand it either. Oh, one last thing.” Ram Lal also put his food aside, now completely absorbed. “He mentioned some kind of journal. I think it was the same one your grandfather had. He seemed to be asking for it to be brought to the estate, while there was still time. Your grandfather flatly refused, saying he would find a way, and that was the end of that. But your father was not happy with this decision. Before you left, the next morning, he gave me this.” He got to his feet, washing his hands in the sink before going to the bedroom and returning with a worn wooden box. “He asked me to hold on to it until you returned to claim the land.”

“He knew I would return?”

“He was sure of it.” Ram Lal smiled and handed me the box.

Inside, there was a small metal curio, shaped like a triskelion bound by a circle. Small inscriptions covered its circumference on both sides, though I could not tell what script it was. I remembered it well.

“My father used to wear this.”

“Yes, as a pendant. You loved playing with it as a boy.”

“But…” I looked up at him, trying to prevent the confusion from showing. “What am I supposed to do with it?”

“He said you would understand. But—”

Before he could say more, there was a sharp knock on the door. It was almost unnaturally loud, almost shaking the wood. As if the thing on the other side was far stronger than a human.

Ram Lal’s brow furrowed as he looked at the door, his voice dying in his throat. The knock sounded again, louder this time.

“Bhanu.” His voice was level and ice-cold when it finally returned. “Check the window.”

He nodded, getting on all fours and slowly creeping over. I followed him.

“*Babu*, stay back,” he hissed, but it was useless. We were already at the window.

There was a short and thin man outside, clad in a spotless white *dhoti* with a white stole around his shoulders. His head was shaved except for a small tuft at the back, oiled and neatly tied: the mark of a Brahmin. His right hand held a small alms bowl.

But when he raised his other hand and knocked, the door shook under the impact, threatening to fly off its hinges. On closer inspection, something was off about him: his easy smile was too static, almost painted on. His eyes were fixed on something far away, as if he was looking beyond what could be seen with the naked eye. The nails on his hands and fingers were unnaturally long, but perfectly clean, manicured to an oval tip. His skin was too smooth, his movements a little too jerky.

It was like something was wearing the appearance of a human being. An imperfect disguise.

Bhanu sighed with relief. “It’s the *baman*, *baba*. Looking for alms again.”

Ram Lal exhaled, relaxing a little. “Thank the gods you visited, *Thakur*. I was planning not to cook lunch today.” He crossed over to the kitchen and filled a small bowl with some *khichdi*, before opening the door and greeting the creature on the other side.

It slowly raised its alms bowl. “My friend, I am a mendicant roaming the lands. I have not eaten in many days. Do you have some food you can spare for me?”

Its voice was small and childlike, like what you would expect from the appearance. But behind it, there was an unnatural edge. A subtle, harsh twang that implied a threat, should the request not be complied with.

Ram Lal put on a brave face, smiling as he raised the bowl of food he had taken. “Of course, young monk. It is my honour to feed a Brahmin like you in my humble abode. Please, take this offering, and bless my family with fortune.”

The monk nodded, his smile widening slightly as he pushed his bowl forward and let him pour the food into it. “May the gods reward your kindness, my friend. May your sins be forgiven.”

Emptying the bowl, Ram Lal set it aside and folded his hands together, bowing to receive his blessing. But his smile turned into confusion as the man spoke again.

“But I tire of this food now, my friend. It no longer sates my hunger.”

Ram Lal straightened, beginning to back away. “I… I don’t…”

“Circumstances have changed. This is no longer sufficient.”

“If you require more food, I can—”

“No.” He smiled wider, looking past him and towards me. “There is only one thing that will satisfy me, *Thakur*. I will accept only one offering. Do you understand?”

I did not understand, but before I could make that clear, the young monk raised his hand and placed it on top of Ram Lal’s head.

He twisted it like a corkscrew, round and round, three times. Vertebrae bent and snapped, loud cracks echoing through the stunned silence. Ram Lal’s eyes widened, his mouth agape in a silent scream.

Then, in a shower of blood, it pulled his head clean off. The body slowly crumpled to the ground, as if in a slow-motion shot.

“I will be paid in title. In blood.”

Dimly, I heard Bhanu cry out in shock, still not completely processing what had transpired. Hell, like I had. The horror had not set in completely yet. I used that to my advantage, trying to maintain an even tone.

“Why are you doing this?”

“I’m not like the others. I don’t covet your riches or your power. But you must face the truth now.” He lowered Ram Lal’s head into his alms bowl. As it touched the rim, it started to liquefy into a pinkish sludge, dripping into the food inside. “You are not ready. The balance on the land is being upset by your actions. Everything is breaking down. You will bring nothing but disaster to this place.”

“And you think you can do better?” I managed, though my hands were starting to tremble.

“I am of order. Of justice. Of law, *Thakur*.” He tilted his head back, swallowing the contents of the bowl in a single gulp before throwing it aside. “I will keep the peace. You know it too, do you not? You cannot do what is necessary. You cannot find the curse. You cannot tame it. You are not up to the task. Deep inside, you understand that. I can see it. You had potential, once. But now? You are broken. A liability.”

“Broken? What do you mean?”

“If you truly want what is best for Chhayagarh, for your family, for the world… You will let me kill you.” He sighed, beginning to step inside the house. “I will make it quick. The others will not.”

The necklace began to heat up against my neck again. “Wait!”

He paused, momentarily unsure.

“This is a private abode! You cannot cross its threshold without permission!”

I know, I know. A shot in the dark. There was no way to know if that rule applied to whatever he was. But it was the only thing I could come up with at the moment. Plus, it wasn’t exactly completely random: he said he was a being of order. Surely something like that would respect the boundaries of private property.

He smiled slightly. “I suppose you are more astute than you let on. Unfortunately, that will not work.” His feet crossed the threshold, though he seemed to struggle a little. “By giving me food, your servant has acknowledged me as a guest. As a guest, I have access to his house.”

“I’m not sure guest rights extend to killing the inhabitants,” I stammered, though my heart was on a steady highway to the pit of my stomach.

“Not usually, no. But, like I said, your authority is not as strong as it used to be. The rules are bendable. More… porous than usual.” He steadily approached me, his smile as agreeable as ever. “I do what I do out of compassion for you, not malice. I free you from your worldly burdens. Surely, you cannot want to live this life.”

He had ripped a man’s head off his shoulders as easily as tearing a piece of paper. He was clearly far, far stronger than anything I had seen so far. And this time, I knew in my heart of hearts that no help would be coming. Despite all that, and despite the desperate attempts of my heart to leap out of my ribcage and run away, I did not want to die.

There was only one thing left to do.

I pulled back my arm and punched him in the face, driving my ring into his cheek.

Despite the obvious difference in strength, he staggered back, hissing in pain. A mark in the shape of the family crest steamed on his skin, as if he had been branded. From that point, cracks radiated outward, slowly breaking his mask. From the gaps, black unlight poured forth, casting whatever it touched into shadow.

He turned back, hastily covering the cracks with one hand. One of his eyes was now pitch-black, the iris golden and glowing faintly.

“Fine, have it your way,” he growled, the voice a low rumble that dropped all pretence of civility.

He closed the distance between us before I could blink, shoving me to the ground with one hand. I had expected him to be strong, but the blow still took every bit of air out of my lungs. I felt a few of my ribs crack like twigs beneath his grasp. His fingers easily dug into my skin, drawing blood that pooled in the depressions. I gasped in pain, raising a hand to punch him again, but he let go of his face and slapped it away. My forearm cracked under the blow, slamming into the ground with so much force that the wooden floor broke.

Then, like tossing a ball, he threw me into the air and slammed me back onto the floor. I screamed, seeing stars as my head banged into the hard wood. Weakly, I struggled to get out of his grip, but it was like iron. My vision swam, becoming blurry and indistinct as I tried to focus on his face.

“I didn’t want this. I didn’t want any of this. All you had to do was listen!” he roared, slamming me to the ground again. “Why are you doing this? You never wanted any of this! Just give it up! Be reborn! Free from this mess!”

I opened my mouth, trying to formulate a retort. I did not want to disappoint my father and grandfather. I did not want to abandon my family. I did not want to betray their trust. But all I could manage was a choking sound. Even through the haze, I saw him sneer.

“Weak.” He raised his other hand and slapped me across the face. My head snapped to the side, neck creaking in protest. My cheekbone was broken. I could feel the pain radiating throughout my face. “That is why you will die here, *my lord*.”

He spat out the last few words with disdain. “Because you are weak.”

The oval tip of one of his nails was morphing, changing into a sharp blade. He lowered it to my throat.

“I will drink your blood. I will take your place. I will protect this land. Whether you like it or not.”

I grabbed the finger, letting out a wordless roar as I fought against his strength. But he was overpowering me effortlessly, the sharp edge inexorably moving towards my artery. I mentally cursed my injured shoulder. I cursed Bhanu for not helping. But deep down, I knew it would likely have made no difference.

He was just stronger than I was.

His nail reached my throat. I prepared to die.

A loud bang rang through the air, and his head exploded into a shower of gore. Three more followed close behind, punching gaping wounds into his body. Gunshots.

Despite the injuries, the headless body made a gesture of enraged annoyance, turning away from me and bounding out the door on all fours. Evidently at its assailants.

I tried to raise my head to look, but even if my vision was working as normal, I had no strength left. All I could do was collapse, the creeping darkness overtaking me as more guns fired in the distance, and something let out otherworldly screams.

When I woke up, I was in my room in the manor. The bed had been stocked with more pillows than I thought humanly possible. The familiar scratchiness of bandages was pressing into my skin at various points: forehead, chest, back, waist, arms. Outside, the sun had disappeared from the sky. It was evening.

“You’re awake.”

The voice belonged to my middle uncle. He was sitting on a chair near the bed, half-obscured by the darkness. The only thing visible on his face were his eyes, glinting yellow.

“Did you…”

“The police inspector dropped by. He wanted to see you about something, so I took him to Ram Lal’s house. There, we found… it, attacking you. The *baman*. We managed to chase it off with our guns, though not before it got a few hits in.” He raised his shirt, showing a bloody bandage around his abdomen. “The inspector got a few fingers bitten off, but it’s all right. We found them. The doctor is reattaching them right now.”

“And…” The thoughts just wouldn’t come. It felt like someone had drenched my mind in jelly.

“You? You’re much worse off than any of us. That shoulder wound was the most worrying, but thankfully the worst of it had been stabilized already. We treated it with some antibiotics and closed it up. Besides that, you have a concussion, some broken ribs, a cracked forearm, facial bones crushed, some damaged vertebrae. You know, the works.”

He said it so nonchalantly, like it was all a minor paper cut.

“Am I going to… Will I be okay?” I managed.

“You lived, didn’t you?” He touched my arm. Amazingly, the pain was mostly gone. “We all heal fast, but you’re in a different league altogether. The doctor says you should be completely fine within a few days, but till then, you should really use this.” He gestured at the walking stick that I had propped up in a corner. “Good job with the punch, by the way. I saw the mark on its face, once it regenerated. Not easy to leave a permanent injury on something like that.”

“Will I be able to walk?”

“Tomorrow, yes. For today, bed rest. And you won’t go anywhere without an escort anymore, not even on the estate. Strict orders from my brother. Non-negotiable.”

I sighed, collapsing into the pillows. “I wasn’t planning on negotiating. I’m way out of my depth here. I’m sorry, for not listening before.”

“Eh.” He shrugged. “It wouldn’t have helped anyway. Those things aren’t keeping to the old rules. Things are changing. Besides, I was just like you when I was young. Couldn’t sit still to save my life. But all the same, you should work something out with your uncle. His knowledge is useful. Find a way to retain it. Speaking of which, the ritual that was going to be held tonight has been postponed. For obvious reasons.”

“What about Bhanu?”

“He’s fine. A little shaken, obviously, but uninjured. We’ve sent him on leave for a few days. Don’t worry; he will be all right. He’s seen worse.” He slapped his knee, getting to his feet. “Well, I should be going. Try to get some rest, but don’t sleep yet. Not until we know the concussion is safe. The inspector will be by tomorrow afternoon, and then we prepare for the ritual. No more detours. Clear?”

“Clear. But… there was a box with me. Did you—”

He nodded towards the bedside table. The box was sitting there, closed and perfectly unharmed. “What do you think I am? An amateur?”

I gave him a faint smile. “Thanks, uncle.”

“That’s… his, isn’t it?”

“Yes. He left it with Ram Lal, before he… But I don’t know why.”

“You’re a smart kid. You’ll figure it out. Chhayagarh is your birthright. Don’t let anyone take it from you. We have sacrificed too much. Hell, you have sacrificed too much to back out now.”

“I won’t. I promise.”

He nodded, turning to leave. “I’m proud of you. We all are. Always.”

“Uncle?”

“Hm?”

I pointed towards the desk. “Can you bring me that journal? I’d like to go through it now.”

He frowned. “Is your vision all right? Can you read?”

“It’ll keep me awake, if nothing else.”

He shrugged, crossing over and handing the book to me. With his other hand, he switched on the lamp on the bedside table. “You’re the boss. But if any money falls out of it, I call dibs.”

“That’s fair.”

Once he left, I decided to type this out before I got to reading. He was right about the concussion; my head feels woozy as I try to figure out the keys on my phone. Everything feels weird and numb. I’ve made, like thirty spelling mistakes per sentence already. Hopefully, the final edits will get them all. I probably won’t make head or tail of that journal right now, but I still have to try. For my Grandfather. Hell, for Ram Lal.

Too many people trust me now for me to not trust myself. I just hope it won’t be misplaced.

And I sure hope I don’t run into that creepy bastard again. I’m not sure my bones can take another pounding like that, notwithstanding what my uncle [said](https://www.reddit.com/r/chhayagarh/).
