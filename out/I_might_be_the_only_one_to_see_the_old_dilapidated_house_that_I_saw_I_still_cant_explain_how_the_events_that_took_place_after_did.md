 

About four years ago, I was hired by a contracting firm that oversaw the remodel, and occasionally teardown and reconstruction, of old and dilapidated buildings. Work was about eight miles away from home, which meant almost an hour of driving every day.

For the most part, I’d jam to music during the drive, half of which was simply being stuck in traffic. One day, however, they closed off the usual route I took to reach work. Being left with no choice, I pulled up the GPS and looked for an alternative route.

There was only one other route, which took about five more minutes to get through. I place my phone in one of the storage compartments in my car and begin driving.

The drive was pretty normal, with traffic at about the same places as always. That was until I got to the detour. As I approached the fork in the road, I realized that there were few, if any, other vehicles on the road. I found this weird, since there was traffic not five minutes ago back on the same road. However, I brushed it off and veered left.

Right after I entered the road, I felt something.

That feeling was dread. At the time, I didn’t know why I felt it. What I didn’t know at the time, was that that sense of dread would soon turn into a sense of sheer terror.

I continued on, eventually reaching work. We worked as usual, going over to some reconstruction sites, laying down floor plans for the rebuild, and everything else in between.

However, that road was still at the back of my mind.

Once I got back into my car and started driving, my sense of dread grew as I was approaching the road. Once again, as I approached the road, there was no traffic. No cars behind or ahead of me. I nervously continued on, reassuring myself that everything was fine, and it was all just a hallucination. Until, that is…

…I saw a house. At the end of a little dirt trail off the road. The sight of it was enough to send chills down my spine. After all, it wasn’t there when I went to work. It was an old house, made of wood. The area to its back and its sides was densely forested. The house itself was small enough to be a cottage. Vines were growing over it. It looked like nature had taken its toll on the house.

I drove home as fast as possible, almost rear-ending a fellow driver on the way. I vowed to forget about the house, not thinking of it ever again.

But think of it was exactly what I did. The thought of it lingered in my mind, with a desire to see what’s inside being born and slowly growing.

That night, I had a dream.

I was driving through the same road. All of a sudden, I stopped right next to the dirt trail.

I was walking towards the house. I was taking slow, but confident steps. I didn’t feel any dread at all. When I peered through the window, a family sat at the dining table, laughing and talking.

As I was looking at them, one of them, the youngest, turned to the window and saw me.

Then, one by one, everyone turned their heads towards the window. I turned to run away, but I tripped and fell face first onto the dirt. I could hear the door behind me open, and then rapid footsteps, but before anything could happen…

…I woke up.

Perhaps it was just my subconscious mind playing tricks on me, but the entire dream felt very surreal. As if I had actually gone up to the house. As if I had seen the family eating dinner.

The next day, I took the same route to work. I scanned for any signs of the house, but I couldn’t find it.

It had disappeared.

When I was returning from work that night, however, I saw it again. The very same house as the one I’d seen the previous day.

Weirdly, however, I felt attracted to it. I felt a feeling of warmth. It almost felt as if the house was inviting me to come and see what lurked inside. I shook off the feeling, however, and drove home as soon as possible.

That night, I had the same dream. I stopped by the dirt trail, went up to the house, peered inside through the window, and saw the same family I’d seen the previous night in my dream. However, something was different. I no longer tripped and fell. I no longer heard footsteps behind me. It felt exactly how I’d felt previously that evening – warm.

I went to work as usual for the next three days, and the same events would occur. The house would magically appear in the evening when I returned from work, and I would have the same dream each night.

However, the dream got shorter each day. One night, I woke up right after I reached the window. The next night, I woke up after I parked my car near the dirt trail. The next night, I didn’t dream about the house at all.

This string of events made me curious. I wanted to explore the interior of the house. If that wasn’t possible, I at least wanted to explore the general perimeter of the house.

So the very next day, I got ready. I packed a flashlight, along with a revolver I stored for emergencies somewhere inside the house. The morning, yet again, went just as usual.

After work, I started up my car and drove through the same road. I stopped right before the dirt trail. With my flashlight and revolver in hand, I took a deep breath, perhaps as a way to reassure myself, and began walking towards the house.

Eventually, I was close enough to the house to look through the hole that once hosted a window. It was pitch black. I turned on my flashlight and shone it into the house. I could make out broken chairs arranged around a table with one of its legs missing. Vines were growing everywhere: On the walls, along the floor, and even on the table and chairs.

This was the very same dining table I dreamt about. I shone my flashlight around the house, until I found something that sends chills down my spine to this day.

There was a skull placed on the floor right in front of one of the walls, with a small pile of bones scattered around it. It looked as if the vines had been neatly cut so as to not cover any area around the bones. There was dried blood on the skull.

As I was trying to make out more of the gruesome scene, however, I heard a mix of rustling and footsteps. I didn’t hang around any longer and made a run for the car. As I got into the car, I heard a single gunshot behind me.

I’d dropped my revolver. However, it didn’t matter.

I hastily started up the car and slammed onto the throttle. I drove all the way back home as fast as I possibly could. I was shaking the whole time as I went into my house, locked all doors, and tried to sleep. I placed my car keys on the night stand in between me.

I couldn’t fall asleep. Through the night, many different questions popped up in my mind. Whose remains were those inside the house? Who emerged from the thick forest behind the house? As I thought more about it, I decided that it was for the best that those questions remained unanswered.

As I pondered these thoughts in my mind, I heard footsteps from the hall. They were loud, as if someone was intentionally stomping onto the ground with each step.

I’d forgotten to lock the windows.

I entered panic mode, grabbed the keys from the night stand, and opened the window ajar, listening for any cues to hightail it out of there. When they started to pound on the doors of one of the rooms, I pushed the window open, hopped into my backyard and made a beeline to the car. I got in, locked the car and once again, drove as fast as possible.

I looked through the rear view mirror, and this time, someone was actually chasing after me. I couldn’t make out much about them, but they were tall, and were wearing a black hoodie.

I decided that my best course of action would be to get on the highway and stay at a motel until I had everything sorted out. I was never coming back.

I stopped at a motel after about two hours of driving. I had enough money on me to move to a safer place, provided I managed my finances properly. I checked in, and tried to sleep. This time I was successful in falling asleep, albeit for only two hours.

I woke up the next morning, and sent a resignation letter to the work e-mail ID. I found a studio for rent halfway across the country for a pretty decent price. The next week or so was mostly spent on driving, eating in fast food chains or local diners and sleeping in cars.

Once I moved in, it took a while, but I found another job, and since then my life has been pretty good. However, I occasionally think about that incident – the lack of traffic around that specific road, the house, the family, the unknown person that shot at me and the person that broke into my house. Was there any chance that they were the same person? If so, how’d they get to my house so quickly? And why’d they stop giving chase?

Well, I guess it’ll remain an unsolved mystery.
