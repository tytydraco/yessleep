I’ve worked for the City of London waste and sanitation division for almost a decade. It’s not glamorous, but it pays decently, and I don’t mind physical work. The job keeps you grounded. You learn a lot about people by what they throw away.

But there are some things you’re not meant to find.

And last week, I found one of them.

Every few months, we do what’s called a deep site audit — basically, we clean out and inventory the private hire storage units managed by the council. These are old brick sheds hidden behind housing estates — originally coal storage from the post-war years. Now people rent them to stash junk: old bikes, broken garden furniture, busted kettles.

Half the time, no one even remembers what’s inside.

This site was in Deptford, behind a row of 1950s tower blocks. I’d never been there before — the area’s being gentrified, but these blocks were untouched. Grey concrete, windows covered in tin foil, the smell of burnt grease in the stairwells.

We had a list of ten units to check.

Nine were boring.

Then we got to Unit 14.

I still have the photo I took. The rust on the padlock had bled into the latch like a wound. And there was something about the air around it — like it hadn’t been opened in a very, very long time.

My coworker Sanj said, “Looks like a squat.”

I laughed. “More like a tomb.”

We pried the lock open.

And immediately, something smelled wrong.

Not rotting, exactly. More like… metal and old paper. Like someone had buried books in a wet basement for years.

The unit was 6 feet deep and 4 feet wide. No light. We shone our torches inside.

It wasn’t full of rubbish. In fact, it was unnervingly clean.

There was:
	•	A metal chair bolted to the floor
	•	A small desk with a notebook
	•	A digital recorder
	•	And a tall grey locker — like the kind you’d see in an old police station

On the wall was a city map. South London. Pins stuck into random streets — no pattern I could make out.

I said, “Looks like someone was living in here.”

Sanj said nothing.

He was staring at the locker.

It had three deadbolts. All engaged.

One had a tag attached.

“DO NOT OPEN. NO MATTER WHAT IT SAYS.”

I laughed nervously. “You think it’s some kind of prank?”

Sanj shook his head.

I stepped closer. The locker was vibrating slightly. A low, almost inaudible hum. Like a washing machine mid-cycle — except it wasn’t running on power.

We stood there a full minute, listening.

Then something inside knocked.

Three times.

Slow. Deliberate.

Sanj backed up immediately. “We need to call this in.”

“I’m not calling anyone,” I said. “It’s probably a rat. Or air pressure. Or… something stupid.”

He looked at me like I was mad.

And I was, a little.

I unbolted the locker.

The metal was warm. Not just warm — hot, like it had been sitting in the sun, except it hadn’t.

I opened the door.

Empty.

At first.

Just a shelf with a folded jacket. An old Dictaphone. And a plastic folder labeled: “No. 17 – Holloway.”

Then something moved.

At the back of the locker — hidden in the shadow — there was a mirror.

But it didn’t reflect me.

It showed a different room.

Dingy, yellow-lit. A single mattress on the floor. A pile of notebooks. On the wall, something written in black marker:

“DO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE IT.”

Then the light in the locker flickered.

And the mirror went dark.

Sanj was already halfway out of the shed. He told me later he’d felt something in his head — like static crawling under his skull.

I closed the locker. Tried to convince myself we’d seen an old prank. A trick mirror. Something explainable.

But here’s where it gets worse.

I took the plastic folder.

I don’t know why.

Curiosity. Stupidity. Both.

Inside were printed police reports — all unofficial, all unlogged. Each one stamped “Internal Only.”

Most were missing persons cases. All unsolved. All from the last 25 years. Some names I recognized from the news. One stood out.

Case 98/2217: Eleanor. 17. Last seen near Holloway.
“Reported hearing voices behind the walls. Psychiatric history unclear. Vanished from inside locked flat. No forced entry. No witnesses.”

Inside the file was a drawing. Done in pencil, childlike. It showed a tall, thin figure with no face, standing inside what looked like a metal locker.

Same one I’d opened.

On the back of the drawing, someone had written:

“It never speaks first. Don’t answer it. Don’t acknowledge. Don’t open the door again.”

The next day, I tried to report what we found.

Management told me Unit 14 had been condemned years ago after flooding. No one was renting it. No access had been given. The entry logs showed it hadn’t been opened since 2007.

They told me to “bin anything inside” and move on.

Sanj quit two days later.

Said he couldn’t stop hearing knocking.

I tried to laugh it off, tried to forget.

Then, last night, I got home and found a single item in my hallway.

A Dictaphone.

Not mine.

I pressed play.

There was only one sound.

Knocking.

Three times.

Slow. Deliberate.

Then a voice.

My voice.

“You opened the door. You let it see you. Now it’s waiting.”

I haven’t slept since.

And this morning, I heard a knock at my front door.

But when I looked through the peephole — there was no one there.

Just a mirror.

And it didn’t show my hallway.

It showed that room again.

That mattress.

That writing.

“Do not acknowledge it.”
