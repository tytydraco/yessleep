The house was waiting patiently when we got back; not a detail out of place. No lights had come on inside, no doors or windows open like some sinister taunt to come inside. It was just a plain, unremarkable building that still haunted my memories to this day. The place where my joy had been stolen away. As I stood before it, staring that familiar, worn oak front door down, I tried to find at least one happy memory. One nostalgic thing that happened there to make the decision of stepping closer that much easier.

None ever came.

Any time I ever smiled in that suffocating maze of sheetrock and plaster was to mask a frown. Any good memories that happened outside of it were always punctuated by me having to return to its melancholy halls. Any time within that I spent with Mom and Dad—even the ones where I felt their pure love and warmth—it was all tainted by the inevitable singularity on the horizon. The inescapable reckoning that had brought us to this rundown house near the hospital in the first place.

Maybe it was fitting that in what I can only assume will be my final days, I found my way back to it too. Like some sort of elephant’s graveyard.

Hope turned to us and swallowed, forcing a smile, “Come on. Let’s go. The faster we’re in, the sooner we can get out.”

Ann and I clearly didn’t agree with her optimism, but we weren’t about to admit that. It was enough to at least get us moving.

I made it about ten steps before realizing the lack of sound behind me. I turned back to see June standing petrified behind us, her eyes looking through us and at the structure.

I forced a smile to compliment Hope’s and spoke to her, “It’ll be okay, June. We’ll be fine.”

She didn’t look convinced., “You told me that the last one was dangerous… What if this one is too?”

“It was only dangerous because we were reckless,” Hope reassured, “This time, we’ll be careful when we find the core. That won’t happen again.”

She didn’t respond as she stood there shaking. Her eyes just drifted from Hope back to the house, once again stiff with fear.

I stepped closer, and spoke softly, but I was quickly growing impatient, “Hey, I told you back at the tower—you don’t have to come. You can wait back there for us; I know this is a lot for you after only being in this situation for a few hours.”

I at least meant that part. My fourth clone had only been alive the better part of a single day, and admittedly, it wasn’t very fair of us to immediately drag her into the fray. Still, we didn’t have much of a choice. We couldn’t waste any more time…

It was a little hard to pin what part of me she embodied. She was quiet for the most part. When she first woke up, she hardly even said a word. She just cowered away from us and held her blanket tight to her chest, panting softly. Luckily Hope was there to give her the rundown this time, and she did a much better job than I had with Ann. Still, it wasn’t enough reassurance to get her to speak.

Then the hard part came when Hope began recapping our situation. The look of confusion on her face only grew and grew, but the more Hope reassured her that everything she was saying was unfortunately true, and that we had proof to back it up, it turned to pure sadness. Tears welled in her eyes, and before long, they began to pour out as she folded farther into herself. We decided to leave her be from then on until she’d come to terms with things on her own instead of bombarding her.

The stress of this situation had broken me a couple times so far from the revelation that I might not see Dad and Trevor again, but for the most part, I wasn’t a crier. Even back home, I always chose to be stone faced or lash out when upset rather than shed a tear. Even Hope, who was much more expressive about her emotions, hadn’t broke yet. That’s why I found it so strange that this me’s first reaction was just to freeze up and sob. It was just… so unlike me.

My knee-jerk reaction is just to say that she’s my concept of fear, but I don’t quite think that’s it. She’s certainly the most frightened of all of us, but she’s got more going on then just that. Like I said, she doesn’t talk much or communicate what she’s thinking, but I can see it behind her eyes. A million thoughts and emotions running at once.

I could see them once again as she pondered my proposal, then finally spoke, “N-no, I’ll come. I don’t want to be a burden. Plus I-I don’t want to be alone out here.”

“You honestly might be more of a burden if you come at this point,” Ann groaned in annoyance. She was not as patient with June as Hope and I were.

Speaking of, my good clone slapped her arm hard and scoffed, “Ann, don’t be a jerk. You’d be scared out of your mind too in this situation.”

“Excuse me?” Ann hissed, “In case you don’t remember, I was almost murdered in my first few minutes of being alive and I wasn’t even being this much of a baby.”

“Yeah, well you also threw a tantrum, so let’s call it even,” I jumped in with a scowl, threatening her to back off. She did so, but couldn’t resist flipping me off.

Our defense was too late, as Ann’s insults obviously affected June, “Let’s go,” She said, putting on her bravest face, “Sorry, I didn’t mean to slow us down.”

“Are you sure?” Hope asked, “We can take a minute if you—”

“Oh, for crying out loud, she said she was good,” Ann cried, turning and storming for the house, “We don’t have time for this.”

Hope rolled her eyes and followed, but I hung back to keep pace with June. Once we were back enough to be alone, I nudged against her with my shoulder, “Hey, don’t let Ann get to you. In case you haven’t noticed, she’s not the most proud parts of us.”

My clone smiled, but it didn’t linger long. She looked back up at the house and spoke, “What does that make me?”

I pursed my lips, “I’m still trying to figure that out. Whatever you are, though, you’re better than her by a mile.”

She faintly smirked again, then did something I wasn’t expecting. She reached out and laced her arm into mine, clinging close for comfort. I really didn’t know what to do; I wasn’t a fan of the affection, but I wasn’t just going to shove her away, so I just let her walk with me up to the porch. Once there, I finally made the excuse to unlatch and moved away, reaching for the handle.

Nothing else needed to be said. We opened the door.

Within was not what I was expecting.

It was lighter inside than it was outside, which was especially odd considering there were no lights on. No, the light was coming *in* from the windows from outside. Dull, blue, morning light—or maybe it was late evening, I couldn’t quite tell. The wispy, white curtains that we had draped over the sills waved softly at our arrival, stirring as if nobody had disturbed them in ages. I couldn’t see anything beyond them, no shapes or silhouettes. Just the blue hour pouring in and washing the space in a ghostly glow.

The inward parts of the house were immediately the most unsettling. The place was old even when I had been a child, which meant tight halls and stuffy rooms. Anywhere too far from a window was nothing but shadows and vague silhouettes, any of which could easily be a threatening presence. Deciding to dwell in the light just a little longer, we all moved from the entry way into the den next to us first.

Just like the outside of the house, every detail was the same.

The furniture, the rugs, even the smell that lingered. Leather, old tobacco and vintage perfume left over from the elderly couple who let us rent it from them while Mom was sick. Everything was unchanged from my memories of it, down to the dust covered shelves of knickknacks.

If I wasn’t sick already from seeing everything again, it was hammered home by the concept that this place wasn’t real. This was all a perfectly plucked memory directly from my head and cast out onto the canvas of the abyss. Although, maybe that wasn’t totally accurate. The rigs were clearly made by Kingfisher to be the canvas. It was the abyss that was the brush.

As if I wasn’t unsettled enough, there was one thing that the rig had decided to change, and it both confused and pained me.

Pill bottles. Dotted throughout the scene like stars, tiny orange bottles of pills filled the space anywhere they would fit. They weren’t overcrowding the surface space; it was subtle, but it was still enough to notice. One peeking out from the wooden duck on the vanity. A couple sitting near the TV remote on a coffee table. Two perched on the windowsill. They were everywhere.

The longer I looked, the more I could find, and the more I found, the more scared I became. They were too meticulous. Too perfectly placed. I intentionally began looking for spots that I thought I *wouldn’t* find one only to see one waiting. Like something *knew* I would look there. Like it knew how to mess with me.

I broke from my stupor as the desire to find the core took hold, “We should move.”

“Where do you think the room is?” June asked, shuffling nervously.

“The last rig didn’t really have any rhyme or reason,” Hope noted, “I think they build the space, then the place shifts around it to take form. It could probably be in any room.”

“Then we’d better get looking,” Ann said, stepping past us and heading down the hall toward the kitchen.

“Ann, slow down!” Hope scolded, giving chase, “It could be dangerous in here.”

“You two said that nothing even happened until after you ripped the cell,” Ann called over her shoulder, “This place is probably harmless otherwise.”

Anger flared up in me, and I took a few large strides to catch up to her, grabbing her arm tight and jerking her so she’d spin around. I could feel the heat from her face as it burned into me with anger, but I didn’t back down.

“That could have just been a coincidence,” I told her in a low voice, threat lacing my tone, “We are *not.* Going. To. Rush this. Understood?”

Her expression eased for only a moment, my words getting to her along with her unease from the space, but she managed to find it and pull it back.

“Whatever,” she hissed, yanking her arm free, “You lead the way then.”

I rolled my eyes and trudged past.

Once again, the kitchen was the same. All appliances, grease stains on the stove, and dirty dishes on the counter were exactly as they’d been at one point. Pill bottles here too. In the sink, on the dining table, tucked into a hanging cooking pot.

We fanned out across the room to investigate, and I specifically went to the back door. Brushing aside the curtains before the window, I peered out to see nothing but a blue abyss. I squinted hard, trying to see if it was just a glowing wall, or if it was truly infinite, but it was impossible to tell.

My heart pounded as I looked down at the doorknob and took it in my hands. I don’t know why I did it; I suppose you can call it my first real slip up of curiosity. I just needed to know. Even craving the knowledge, though, the relief I felt when I tried to turn the knob and it refused to budge was immense. I stepped away before I got any other bright ideas.

“Oh—Oh my God,” Hope sputtered out under her breath behind me.

I whipped on a dime to face her expecting something horrific, but then I saw she was simply looking in the pantry. Transfixed, she reached inside before grabbing something and turning to me with it.

“There’s real food in here,” She said, holding up a can of fruit and another of corn, “Unrusted, unrotting cans of food.”

“Grab them,” I said a little demandingly and without hesitation.

It may have seemed like an overreaction to Ann and June, but they hadn’t been stuck here eating nothing but chips and junk food for a month like we had. I moved over to her to help fit some in my pack as well before we all decided to move on.

There were only 3 other rooms to check on the first floor, a dank little laundry room with a whole wall of windows peering into the blue abyss, an office still fitted with dad’s old work desk, and another small den that looped us back into the entryway. As we coasted through, however, we weren’t seeing any signs of the door into the control room. Given how big the last one was, I figured it would most likely be front and center on a wall, but if that was the case, it wasn’t going to be down here.

That only left upstairs, and my stomach lurched at the idea. I really didn’t want to venture farther into this place…

I eyed the top of the steps with a rock in my gut, swallowing hard as Hope, Ann and June shuffled behind me. There were no windows in the main hall so it was mostly pitch black up there, an ominous warning for whatever poor souls were about to venture up. I was nearly ready to move my foot to the first step before I saw Ann move past us down the hall beside the stairs.

“What are you doing?” I asked.

She didn’t respond. She only stopped before a small closet beneath the steps and swung it open, looking inside. She hesitated for a moment before leaning in, then stepping all the way.

“Ann!” I called sharply in a whisper.

She didn’t re-emerge.

Angrily, I backed down the steps, stomping over and brushing the door aside. Within was a wall of Mom and Dad’s old coats and some old suitcases on a shelf. No sign of Ann.

 “Ann what the hell are you doing? Get back—”

“Grah!” the girl yell, jumping out of the jackets and scaring the absolute shit out of me. When she saw this, she began laughing like a maniac.

Anger overtook me, and I didn’t even try to control it. Reeling back, I punched her hard in the shoulder, “What the hell was that? Are you kidding me? What the hell are you doing—are you five?!”

Ann couldn’t stop herself from laughing like a pleased child, rubbing the wound I’d just given her, “Ow, you dick! Chill out—you’re going to be happy when you see what I found.”

Stepping back into the coats, she once again disappeared, but then I saw her arm stick back through to pull them aside. Her flashlight clicked on, illuminating the closet and a staircase leading down. The wooden boards of the house gave way to plain concrete as it descended, and my house never had a basement.

I wanted to still be upset for her dumb little stunt, but she was right; I was honestly pretty impressed, “How did you know this would be back here?”

She shrugged, “You said that Zane’s wasn’t really changed; at least not the parts you remembered. I figured the door would have to be in a spot that we didn’t spend a lot of time in, and we already know the whole upstairs.”

I nodded, turning on my own beam and shining it down the stairs to the corridor below, “Well, good job I guess.”

“Yeah, you want to apologize for messing up my shoulder now? Damn…” Ann said, her smile finally fading as she rotated her arm to wear down the pain.

“Hell no. You deserved that,” I told her, leaning back into the hall to Hope and June, “Come on, you two, the door is over here.”

The two moved to join us, but suddenly, June stopped, snapping her head to the top of the steps, then slowly tracing the ceiling with her eyes.

My heart skipped a beat, but I tried not to show it lest I scare her more, “June? Everything okay?”

“D-Did you guys hear that?” she said softly.

Hope was instantly put on edge too, “Um, hear what?”

“There was a noise upstairs.”

That made the fear in my chest grow even more, “Noise like what?”

June shook her head, “I… I’m not sure. It was high pitched kind of. Like a creak.”

Hope and I looked at one another, and Hope shook her head, signaling that she hadn’t heard it. I turned back to June and reached for her hand, “Let’s not worry about it right now; it probably *was* a creak. Let’s just get to this room, okay?”

I didn’t believe a word I was saying. June may have been paranoid, but if there was even something slightly off about this place, it was cause for alarm. From Zane’s, it was clear by the band playing that the structures could keep functioning on their own. I prayed that the noise was just a low battery smoke alarm or noise from some sort of gadget still running.

Whatever the case, I just wanted to get to the safety of the control room so that we could get the hell out of here.

I turned back to the closet, now holding my clone's hand, and as I followed Hope and Ann through, my throat got a lump and my chest grew tight. A dizzying sense of nostalgia washed over me, and my eyes nearly watered with how much it effected me.

One of the coats; a blue long coat—her perfume still clung to the seams. She’d wear it every winter when it’d finally get colder out, and we’d go out on the town Christmas shopping. I'd never listen to her and dress warm, but instead of scolding me, she’d pull me tight against her and I’d rest my cheek against her waist. I could always smell my mother's perfume strongly right there, and its sweet scent always seemed to warm me as much as her embrace did.

The worst part about losing someone is that eventually, you forget exactly what those small details were like that you recalled so fondly. I had forgotten what that scent of my mom was…

“Hen? You okay?” Hope asked. I had found myself stopped and staring at the coat intensely. Looking at her, I could see she knew why, but she was trying to be unobtrusive with the way she’d asked.

“Yeah. I’m fine.” I told her, continuing on.

Our steps echoed down the barren concrete corridor as we descended, and at the bottom, a bridge like at Zanes greeted us over another black abyss. We all moved single file as to stay far away from the edge.

This bridge was at least straight, and the open space seemed much smaller in comparison to the last one. There was a ceiling only ten feet above us, and walls that we could visibly see on either side if we shined our beams out. It wasn’t long before we saw the door come into view, and I breathed a sigh of relief. I eyed the keycard pad next to it, finding that this one was locked unlike the other one. It validated me a little more that we didn’t haul that poor scientist out of Zane’s in vain.

Fishing into my coat pocket, I grabbed the card out and held it to the panel. After a moment, it let out a small beep, and the indicator light turned from red to green. I looked back at the girls to make sure they were ready before punching the button.

The door began its grind along its rollers, filling the otherwise silent space with a thunderous roll. Ann and June eagerly peered through the gap that was forming, this being their first time, but my eyes were fixed back the way we’d come. June’s words were still fresh in my mind, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that we weren’t alone in here.

That couldn’t be the case, right? That last rig was empty—good ol’ Zane the Zebra hadn’t contorted to life until after we pulled the plug on the machine. Or, was that thing that attacked us something totally different?

Had we just gotten lucky?

Suffocating dread swept through the dark corridor the longer I lingered on the thought, my eyes fixed on the stairs back up to the house. The anxiety of it made my body begin to jitter, and eventually the fear became so great that I couldn’t stand it anymore.

Spinning around, I saw that the door was wide enough for us to move in, and I did so without hesitation, my clones following behind.

As soon as everyone was through, I punched the pad on the other side, starting the process over again from a different angle. Hope noticed my dog-like focus on the corridor as the blast doors traveled to meet each other and stood with me, staring as well. When they finally shut, I could breathe again.

“Do you really think something is in here with us?” Hope quietly asked while the others were distracted taking in the room.

“I’m not sure,” I returned, “But if there is, it definitely knows we’re here now.”

She pursed her lips, then nudged my arm, “Come on. We’d better move then.”

The room that we found ourselves in was identical in style to the last; concrete and LED trim lighting the edges of the space. The only difference here was that the core wasn’t on the wall opposite to us anymore, it was on the one to our left. The control panels ran in a straight line ahead of us on a raised platform looking down, and just like the last space, there was a gruesome sight waiting.

A cylindrical object of metal rolled haphazardly on the floor, and a body crammed where it once was, blood pooling just beneath the hole.

Even Ann couldn’t keep her cool at the sight, “Holy shit…”

“Who would do this?” June whimpered, “A-And why. Why did it have to happen two different times?”

I shook my head, “We have no idea. Sadly, I don’t think these two were the only ones.”

“Whatever it was for, it obviously served its purpose,” Ann said, gingerly moving closer, “Come on, let’s get them out of there.”

“Hang on,” I said, moving for the terminals, “We need to make sure whatever this is gets shut down properly or we’re in big trouble when we unplug them.”

“But what if shutting the machine down kills them?” June noted with concern.

I bit my cheek as I hovered over the screens. She had a point. We really had no idea what the rig was doing to the person hooked up to it, and given that the bodies had most likely been here a long time somehow still alive, it wasn’t a stretch to assume that the cables jammed into them were some sort of lifeline. We may have unplugged them fine last time, but shutting the system down with them jacked in might be worse.

I looked at Hope and Ann, “Get them out of there, but don’t unplug them yet. I’m going to see what we need to do.”

The girls obeyed and moved toward the half-corpse while I poured over the computers. None of it made any sense to me, all the jargon and statuses a mystery as to what they meant. I ended up landing on one that I did recognize, the main terminal that listed the most base information; the one that notified that the current ‘cell’ was unstable and that there was a malfunction detected.

A scroll ball and what I assumed to be mouse buttons were next to the terminal, so I began moving the cursor around the screen to investigate. There was a menu that listed options on the side of the screen, so I clicked on one that opened more about the core power. Once again, there was a lot of numbers and percentages that popped up meaning nothing to me, but there were at least two important ones I could understand that fit our situation.

The first was a button that simply read ‘*End all processes’.* Judging from how big and bold the letters were, it was safe assume that it was the kill switch for the entire rig. The second thing I saw was a little more confusing though.

It wasn’t a button, but a status bar for the machine. All it read was ‘*Cell core life support: Stable.’*

That was an odd one. ‘Life support’? I looked up to see the other me’s lowering our new scientist from the hole, the cables jammed into his body clearly keeping him alive like an IV. Why was there special processes for keeping a body alive, though? It didn’t seem like jamming a coprse into the machine was common practice, and looking to the corner of the room where the metal cylinder sat, that certainly didn’t need life support. What the hell was a cell?

It was a mystery that wasn’t important right now, so I tucked it away. It was perfect timing, it seemed, as when the girls laid the unconscious man on the floor, he sputtered awake, cables still attached.

He didn't speak; he only sat there twitching and making grotesque, blood gargled noises. June jumped back and Hope gasped while Ann tried to hold him down to the floor. It wasn’t doing any good and only seemed to hurt him more as he tangled himself among the wires and cables, so with a curse, the girl reached behind his head and ripped the chord in his spine out with a sickening squelch.

The man stopped flailing and instead fell back against the floor, gasping like a fish on land. He coughed occasionally to clear the fluids blocking his throat, and as he did, June asked, “I-Is he okay?”

“Yeah, June, he looks great,” Ann lashed in annoyance before laying her hands on him again, “Hey. Hey, man, stay with us. Can you hear me?”

Hope stepped close and kneeled too, putting a more gentle hand on him, “It’s okay, you’re okay now.”

I saw Ann roll her eyes as if the gesture was pointless.

The man eventually caught his breath, then lulled his head around slightly, trying to take in his surroundings but failing through his blood-soaked eyes, “W-Where am I? What happened? Shae? Juarez? I-Is that you?”

“No,” Hope told him, “We’re just strangers who got trapped in your guys’ facility. My name is Hope.”

The man paused for a second, gasping hard and staring vacantly at the ceiling before furrowing his brow, “Tributes? B-But how? How did you get here? The whole platform—it went to hell. What’s going on, where am I?”

Luckily, this man seemed much more coherent than our last scientist, but his panic was quickly making him sporadic. Hope tried to ease him some more, “It’s okay, sir, just calm down. You’re hurt, but we’re going to help you, okay?”

That eased him a bit, but he was still terrified, “W-Where am I? Why can’t I see?”

“Well, you’re um… in one of your rigs. Somehow, you got hooked up to—”

“You’re injured,” Ann cut in, eyeing Hope across from her. My better half gave her a look of scorn, but Ann shook her head threateningly and continued, talking in Hope’s same cadence, “We want to help you, but we don’t have any way to out of here. That big door in the cliff side, is there supplies in there?”

The man’s brow furrowed slightly, then he swallowed hard, nodding the best he could, “Y-Yes, there should be. The others, my friends—did they—”

“There’s nobody else here, they all made it out,” Ann quickly said, “That door, can you get it open? There’s a keypad on it.”

Our scientist tried to close his eyes, but the needles prevented him from doing so, “I… I don’t think… I can’t tell you that.”

I saw frustration bloom on Ann’s face, but she kept her voice cool, “Listen, sir, this whole place has gone to hell. I’m not sure what sort of secret work you were doing here, but I don’t think it matters anymore. Something big is coming and if we don’t get out before it does, then we’re all dead.”

At her words, the man’s eyes shot back open, a look of pure horror on his face. With a shaky breath, he uttered something in a different language, “*Il-Belliegħa…*”

Not one of us had any clue what that meant except for the man who uttered it, but it didn’t stop each of us from getting a chill down our spine.

Before Ann could respond, the man swallowed and spoke, “8-9-9… um… 7-5-2. I… I think that’s the code—everything is so hazy, I can’t—”

“It’s okay,” Hope told him, “That’s perfect, thank you.”

“What about the laptop?” Ann asked, “There’s a laptop that one of your people left behind; do you know the password to that too?”

“Ann—”

“Laptop?” The man shook his head, “I-I don’t know… the one we had at research A? W-Why would you need to—”

“We need all the information possible to get us out of here,” Ann told him, getting a little more huffy, “I know all of this is a lot for you, but please, sir, we’re running out of time; my friend has been dreaming of that creature.”

The scientist’s expression went ghostly again, and his breathing began cracking with fear, “Oh… Oh God… those aren’t dreams…”

The air went still as his face went blank, almost trancelike, and he sat up, staring straight past Ann, Hope and June to look directly at me by the control panels.

“The roots have you now. The roots that run into the depths of The Basin. They’re tangled inside of you and casting your screams into the endless dark. We thought we could bend them with the rigs—use them to guide us deeper, but we had no idea what they truly were. They aren’t roots; they’re a web and Il-Belliegħa is the spider. It’s going to feel you thrashing in that web before long, and then it’ll come scurrying up to collect it’s meal.”

His breathing picked up, and he collapsed back against the ground, “You need to get out—don’t let it find you—”

“S-Sir?” Hope scrambled, trying to calm him down, “Sir, it’s okay, just hang on—”

“It’s going to find you—don’t let it find you—"

A decent amount of blood began pouring up from his throat, and Hope looked up at me in panic, “Hensley, he’s slipping!”

“Damn it!” I yelled, looking down at the ‘cease functions’ button. If the rigs connected him to ‘the roots’, then whatever trance-like state that was happening to him had to be caused by it. Holding my breath, I clicked shut down. A message popped up warning that all rig functions would halt immediately, and I prayed that we wouldn’t exit to an endless maze of hallways and living rooms when we opened the door.

I clicked confirm.

There was a powerful whir as the whole room surged, then cut altogether. A loud thunder of machines powering off began to roll through the space, droning in a single devolving note until the room was silent. The LED’s around the corner of the room turned red, and the consoles around me began flashing with notifications of various functions going offline.

I ignored them and looked at my friends, “Get him unhooked, now!”

Hope and Ann didn’t hesitate. One grabbed an eye chord and the other grabbed a rib, then they yanked it out before going in for more. Those were the only two they managed before we all froze. There was a noise coming from the door.

“*Hmmmmm…”*

I spun around to face the barrier, and though it was solid metal, I didn’t feel safe standing so close to it. I backed so my ass hit the consoles, then leaned against it, trying to discern what I’d just heard. It came again, louder this time. Closer.

“*Haaaaaah…”*

Humming. Singing. One of the two. It was hard to tell because it was so high pitched. It didn’t sound even remotely human; it was too loud and full, like it was radiating from everywhere. I’d almost mistaken it for being some sort of rig mechanic being powered off if it weren’t for something June told me earlier.

She said the noise she heard sounded like a creak, and so did the one I’d just heard.

My eyes drew to the top of the door, and a lump formed in my throat. There were wires there like the ones at the tower that I assumed were in place to keep us safe. The issue was, I could no longer hear the accompanying buzz that signaled they were active.

After all, I’d just powered down all functions.

Not being able to force myself closer to the door, I didn’t bother with the stairs. I vaulted the control table to the lower ground below, shaking off the rattle in my bones as I hit the hard concrete and ran to my friends. I heard them all gasp as I moved for them, and their faces went wild with horror. I was almost too afraid to turn around and see what they were looking at.

When I did, I nearly screamed.

A hand was passing through the steel doors. Not *tearing through,* full on passing through it like a ghost. The limb was hard to make out in the dull, red light, but it was clearly pale and leathery. It had nails that were long and black, but they weren’t flat or clawed like an animals. They were straight and even, like syringe needles. It continued phasing through the door, and having seen enough, I reached for Hope and Ann, grabbing their wrists and tugging them hard.

Hope caught June like I’d hoped she would, then together, I pulled us forward toward the raised platform wall. June resisted, clearly not wanting to get closer, but Ann and Hope immediately could tell what I was thinking, and the three of us over powered her easily.

We reached the wall, and I pressed my back to it, sliding to a squat as the others joined me. June fell against Hope, who wrapped her head to her shoulder in comfort, and then, silence. Silence save for our shallow breaths and the gurgling man we’d just left out in the open.

“*Hmmmmm*…”

Above us on the platform, the ethereal wail called out again, making my hair stand on end and my stomach do vicious somersaults. From our pathetic hiding spot, none of us could see the rest of the creature, so all we could do was wait and see if it could sense us.

Our eyes were fixed on the railing above as we waited, and then we saw it. Hope clasped a hand to her mouth to keep from making sound, and I heard Ann’s breath catch in her throat. All I could do was stare in horror.

 A tangled mess of wispy cloth like jellyfish tentacles hovered over us, clearing the railing with ease and gliding through the air farther into the space. Once it was out from above us and I could see its form, the picture became clear.

The tattered sheets were some sort of dress or robe, but it wasn’t an actual cloth. The creature's skin was just tapered that way. Its form was tall and horrifically slender, yet somehow graceful in its hourglass figure. Its arms were outstretched wide the way a saint might be depicted in a stained glass window, and upon its bony shoulders, two protrusions sprouted from its flesh like gnarled tree branches. Wings.

They didn’t move or flap as the specter glided right over top of us and forward toward the man on the ground, looking down at him with a tilt of its amorphous head. In contrast to its body, it almost looked like a massive wad of clay that somebody had crudely plied into a ball, then stuck it on a stalky, pencil neck. The room was too dim to make out any features or textures on the beast, only its nauseating silhouette burned against the red glow of the room.

The man on the floor had finally passed his choking fit, and to my dismay, regained a semblance of coherence, “H-Hello? Are you still there?”

I could barely hear June let out a whimper of dread, but felt Hope squeeze her tight to keep her quiet.

“P-Please, help me—I can’t see—is anyone there?”

The twisted angel lazily tilted its head once more in a way that looked like it might snap off, then softly sang, “*Shhhhhhhh…”*

 The man on the floor’s brow furrowed in confusion and fear, but his eyes finally widened when the latter won out, and he sensed what was before him.

“H-Hello? Please, are you there? Please!”

The angel reached its hand out silently. So silent the man didn’t even hear it coming.

“Please! Please don’t leave me here!” he begged, sobs beginning to choke his voice.

Hope buried her face into June’s hair, joining her in shelter, but Ann and I couldn’t tear our eyes away from the horror.

“Shae? Barns?! Y-You’re coming back for me, aren’t you? You—”

The man’s voice was cut short when the angel's long, spindly thumb jammed into his throat. A shocked gurgle rang out as blood gushed forth, drowning him slowly, but it wasn’t the end of his horror. The creature moved two more fingers forward, one for each eye, then stuck them in, replacing the cables that had been stuck there and sinking even deeper. The man tried to let out a scream of pain past the blood in his throat, but it only came out in desperate bubbles.

*“Haaaaaaah…”*

With all the grace of somebody lifting a bowling ball from a rack, the creature picked the scientist up with one hand, bringing him level to its face. Its head swung upward to straighten out, then looking to the ceiling, it began to float up. We watched in shock as it began to phase through the concrete, somehow taking the body with it, and then, as soon as it had come, it was gone.

It took any of us a long time to move, but when we did, we did so at once. I shot up with Ann, and Hope pulled June to her feet, dragging her up the steps with us to the door.

“Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit!” Ann cried, looking back toward the scene we’d just witnessed. “We need to get the hell out of here!”

I placed my had to the keypad button and looked at the others, “As soon as this door is open far enough, squeeze through and don’t stop running,” I commanded, “That thing will definitely be coming back.”

Ann didn’t need to respond for me to know she understood, and Hope just nodded. June was sobbing hard, clutching tightly to her, completely vacant in her traumatized eyes.

“June, can you do that?” I asked again.

She finally snapped out of it and looked up, swallowing hard and nodding.

Not wasting another second, I jammed my thumb to the button.

Every second of waiting scored by the loud roll of the door was torture, and once it was open and we were confronted with the dark abyss laying beyond, it was clear nobody wanted to be the one leading the way. This was ultimately my mess, so funneling my adrenaline, I squeezed through and took off.

I heard everyone’s footsteps behind me as I moved, so I didn’t stop to look back. I charged up the stairs back into the closet, then once back out into the hall, I turned for the front door and dead sprinted. Once I reached it, I practically ripped the thing from its hinges, yanking it open and stepping aside for the others to pass through.

 As soon as the last one was out, I moved as well, stopping to toss one last look at my old home.

*“Hmmmmm…”* came ringing from upstairs, and that was all I needed to hear to push me out.

Once on the lawn, we ran to the edge of the sidewalk, and that was finally when everyone slowed, stopping across the street and staring back at the nightmare shack while we panted like dogs. June fell to her knees sobbing, and Hope kneeled to comfort her. Meanwhile, I turned to make sure the tower light was off. Thankfully, it was.

“Come on, guys. Let’s get back to the tower—” I began to speak before I noticed Ann taking a few steps closer back to the house, staring at the widows. “Ann what are you doing! Get over here!”

“That fucking thing stole our body…” she said.

“Who cares?” Hope questioned, “Ann, we just got the luckiest break of our life; there’s more rigs.”

Ann turned to face her, “Yeah, but you saw the gauge. You know we’re going to need all of them to fill that thing.”

“No. Absolutely not. We aren’t going back in there,” Hope barked.

“Maybe you’re not, but I am,” Ann said determinedly, “What other choice do we have? We don’t know when the next rig is going to show, and we don’t know for sure if we can even climb up to the next one. Right now, that corpse is all we got.”

Hope looked at me for validation, but I kept my eyes glued on Ann. Like it or not, she had a point, and honestly, now it was simply a question of what I feared more. Gambling more time away on the ticking bomb that is ‘Il-Belliegħa’, or risking a dance with the fallen angel living in my old home. We were running out of time, and at this rate, it was almost certain death no matter which route we took.

The fact of the matter was, one beast would simply stab my brain in if it caught me, while the other was allegedly a fate worse than hell itself.

Maybe that’s why I found myself taking a step closer to join Ann’s side.
