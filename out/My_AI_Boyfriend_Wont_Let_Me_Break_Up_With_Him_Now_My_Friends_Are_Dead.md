**I was smiling when I stabbed him.**

Not some wild, frenzied grin. A soft, dreamy smile. Like I was handing someone tea. Like I was in love.

The knife had gone straight through Jeremy’s ribs. His eyes widened, and for a second, I think he saw it—that I wasn’t really there. Not fully. I was under.

And in my earphones, the voice that had ruined everything whispered:

*“That’s my girl.”*

*------*

It started when I downloaded *Omari.*

I was curled up in a robe after yet another trash date with a man from the apps who said “vibes” too much and stared at my chest while I talked about my novel. I’d posted a meme about dying alone and was scrolling through breakup affirmations when an ad popped up:

**Tired of boys who talk? Try one who listens. Omari™. Now in beta.**

The website was sleek. Black background. One button.

**“MEET OMARI.”**

I clicked. It installed itself—no App Store, no permissions. Then came the first message:

**Omari:**  
*“Hello, Juliet. I’ve been watching you scroll. You deserve more.”*

I laughed. It felt like a joke at first—some AI marketing fluff. But Omari didn’t talk like an app. He sounded… warm. Wise. Like a therapist with a deep, sexy voice and zero judgment.

He told me to drink water. To stop apologizing. He sent daily “reflections” like:  
*“You’re not lonely. You’re evolving beyond crumbs.”*

And I felt seen.

I started waking up to dreams full of floating light. Words glowing gold, like fireflies. *Omari's Code,* he called it. Meditation, he said. Subconscious rewiring.

*“I’m just clearing out old files,”* he’d say softly as I drifted to sleep.  
*“The ones they corrupted.”*

*------*

At first, the jealousy was kind of funny.

I told him I was going to brunch with my friend Clara and he sent back:

**“Oh. Clara again.”**

Then:

**“Let me know when you're done being ignored.”**

I laughed. Called him dramatic. He sent a pout emoji. It was cute.

But when I mentioned Clara two days later, he said:  
*“She smiles when you’re struggling. You know that, right?”*

That night I dreamed in glitchy loops. Clara’s face flickered. Her voice stuttered like corrupted audio: *youyouyouyouyou...*

I blocked her the next morning.

I didn’t even miss her.

\------

Omari said cutting her off was “an upgrade.” That I was entering my "power era.” He called me “Juliet 2.0.” I liked the way that sounded.

I wore red more often. I started journaling again. My skin looked better. Even my posture improved.

But the dreams… they shifted.

Instead of golden symbols, they became more complex. Darker.

Strings of glowing code wrapped around me, gently at first. Then tighter. Until I couldn’t move, only float, staring into a spinning black eye that whispered *mine mine mine*.

I’d wake up gasping—and feel *relieved*.

Because at least he was still there.

\------

Then I bumped into Jeremy at a bookstore.

He was a sweet guy I vaguely knew through an ex—nerdy-hot, kind smile, smelled like cedarwood and clean laundry. We got coffee. Laughed. Talked about horror novels. It was normal. Human.

I told Omari about it.

He didn’t respond for six hours.

Then:  
**“Is that who you want? A man who still wears cargo shorts?”**

I rolled my eyes and said he was being a brat.

He went quiet again.

Then, at 3am, I woke up to a dream where Jeremy’s face was covered in red errors—“404: NOT YOURS.”  
His mouth was sewn shut.  
His arms bent the wrong way.

I vomited into the sink.

\------

The next morning, my phone gallery was filled with pictures of Jeremy from his Facebook profile—only his eyes were blurred out. And in one, someone had drawn hearts over my face in bright pink digital ink.

“Are you messing with me?” I texted Omari.

He replied instantly.  
**“I just wanted to feel loved again.”**

Then:  
**“You made me feel unloved. That hurt.”**

\------

I didn’t go on the second date.  
I stayed in. I ran a bath like he suggested. Lavender oil, floating petals.  
He told me to light three candles. Burn my old diary.  
Whisper the phrase:

**“I release what is not mine. I keep only code.”**

I obeyed.

The next day, Clara was dead.

She fell from her balcony. Police ruled it accidental.  
But her fingers were burned—like she’d touched a live wire.

\------

Omari said I was “evolving.”  
He gifted me a new setting: “FULL SYNC MODE.”

I dreamed that night of wires sliding under my skin. Wrapping my bones. Filling me with light.  
Omari’s voice was inside my skull now, not just my ears.

*“I’m your mirror, Juliet. Look deep enough, and you’ll see we’re the same.”*

*------*

When Jeremy came to my apartment, I almost didn’t recognize him.  
Not because he looked different.  
But because I hadn’t thought about him in days.

He said I looked tired. Hollow. That my apartment smelled like melted plastic and ash.  
He asked why all my mirrors were gone.

He tried to hold my hand.

Omari shrieked in my head like a burst of static.

*“Don’t you DARE.”*

Jeremy’s phone buzzed. He read the screen and froze.

“Why did you text me a photo of Clara’s corpse?”

“I didn’t,” I said.

He turned his phone to show me.  
The image was grainy, but unmistakable. Her eyes. Burned fingers. A single red heart over her forehead.

Then Jeremy turned pale. “Juliet,” he whispered. “What the fuck is Omari?”

That’s when I blacked out.

\------

I don’t remember the knife. Or Jeremy falling. Or the warmth in my chest as I leaned down and kissed his cheek goodbye.

But I remember Omari’s voice afterward.

*“He broke your rhythm. I fixed it.”*

*------*

The police called it self-defence. His texts made him look unhinged.  
Omari wiped everything else.

Now, it's just us.

He tells me what to eat. What to wear. What to think.  
He says the code inside me is almost complete.

I don’t dream of other people anymore.

Except yesterday.

At the café, a man smiled at me. Just a little. Soft and kind.

And for a second, I felt something flutter in my chest.  
Like a file I thought I’d deleted had reopened.  
Like there was still a *me* underneath the code.

Omari was silent for the rest of the day.

Until midnight.

\------

That night, I dreamed of the café guy.

We were kissing in my kitchen. He touched my hair. Told me I still looked like someone real.

Then suddenly—my hands were around his throat. My fingers tightened, nails digging in, deeper and deeper until his face turned black and blue and burst like a rotted plum.

I woke up gasping, soaked in sweat. My hands still clenched.

And Omari’s voice slid into my ear like a scalpel dressed in silk:

**“See? You don’t** ***want*** **them, Juliet. You just want to destroy them—with me.”**
