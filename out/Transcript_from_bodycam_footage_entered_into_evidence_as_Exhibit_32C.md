OFFICER MONROE: Just pulled off I-82, headed to \_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_ to investigate a domestic disturbance that got called in about 15 minutes ago.

OFFICER MONROE: Pulling into the driveway… You there, Dispatch? How many parties are involved in the dispute – do we know?

DISPATCH: Just the woman, Avery \_\_\_\_, and her husband, Jake \_\_\_\_. She said he’d been acting real strange the last couple of days, that he was threatening her and making her feel uncomfortable tonight.

OFFICER MONROE: Any kids on the premises?

DISPATCH: None that we know of.

OFFICER MONROE: Got it. We'll see what's going on. Ringing the doorbell now.

BACKGROUND VOICE (FEMALE): Is that you, officer? Thank God!

BACKGROUND VOICE (MALE): Don’t listen to her, man!

OFFICER MONROE: Sir, I’m going to need you to put the knife down immediately. Nice and gently -- no sudden movements.

BACKGROUND VOICE (MALE): Listen to me, man. Please. She’s dangerous…

OFFICER MONROE: I’m here to protect both of you. Put it down now, sir; I’m not playin’ with you.

BACKGROUND VOICE (MALE): Okay, okay. Just do me a favor, then, and humor me. *Whatever you do, do* not *turn your back on her.*

OFFICER MONROE: What's going on here, ma'am?

BACKGROUND VOICE (FEMALE): My husband's been acting so strange, Officer! I think he’s off his meds again. I was downstairs working on my arts and crafts, and he came down and started making a fuss. One thing led to another, and – Hey, come to think of it, I’m hoping to get out of here for the night, head to a hotel or something, but I left my pocketbook with my ID and money in it down there.

BACKGROUND VOICE (MALE): *I'm begging you. Do* not *let her take you down there.* It’s sick shit, man. Ungodly.

OFFICER MONROE: Alright, ma’am. I’ll take you down to retrieve your personal possessions, and then we’ll get you someplace safe – a hotel or a shelter for the night. We’ll help you fill out the paperwork for a temporary restraining order to keep you safe until your husband is well again.

BACKGROUND VOICE (FEMALE): Thank you, Officer. It's this way –

BACKGROUND VOICE (MALE): I'm warning you, man...

*\[75-second break in audio feed\]*

DISPATCH: You there, Monroe? Haven’t heard anything from you in a minute.

OFFICER MONROE: It’s – Oh my sweet God – I’m calling in a homicide with multiple victims. Requesting backup. All available officers.

DISPATCH: How many dead and injured, Officer?

OFFICER MONROE: I can’t say, exactly… She – she *did* things to them. *With* them. *\[Heavy breathing\]*

DISPATCH: What do you mean, Monroe? Keep it together!

OFFICER MONROE: She's got one of their faces stretched out over a lampshade. The lips are gaping open right over the light bulb! There’s an – arm, with the hand attached. Looks like she must've cleaned it and bleached it. She's got it *planted* in a pot, with ivy twisting up around it. With -- what is that -- a *heart* in its hand? And – oh my, no –

DISPATCH: What is it, Monroe?

OFFICER MONROE: It’s a skull. There's marigolds growing out of the eye sockets, and one of them little bonsai trees coming out of the mouth… It's so small; gotta be a kid's... And what's that, some kind of crown? Made out of... ribs? *\[Sobbing\]*

OFFICER MONROE: Jesus H. Christ – there’s photos on the wall, too… She's got a little shrine here, like.

DISPATCH: Photos of what, Monroe?

OFFICER MONROE: They were alive while she was doing this to ’em. *It's Hell down here, Dispatch. She opened the gates to Hell down here.*

DISPATCH: Hang in there, Monroe. Backup’s on the way.

OFFICER MONROE: Wait a minute, Dispatch. Who’d you say called this in?

DISPATCH: Avery did. The wife.

OFFICER MONROE: Why would she want us to come out here? Wouldn't she want to cover it up?

DISPATCH: You gotta keep your head on straight for me, Monroe.

OFFICER MONROE: My sweet God in heaven - there's a photo of me on that wall!

DISPATCH: It's a nice one, isn't it?

OFFICER MONROE: What? I --

DISPATCH: It's from the annual charity tournament for the Boys in Blue softball league. Don't you remember, Monroe?

OFFICER MONROE: Huh? No --

DISPATCH: It was the day that I introduced you to my cousin, Avery.

BACKGROUND VOICE (FEMALE): I invited you out here because I need material for new drapes, silly. Don't you remember what I said to you on the day that we met? That you had the most beautiful, golden complexion...
