For anyone that missed things a few days ago.

“So how do we know when this guy is causing the distraction?”  I text. 

JP laughs, it’s genuine, but dark all the same. 

“The one thing I can promise you, is that when this lunatic does his thing, you’ll know.” Is his answer. 

Everything is still happening so fast, the karmic quicksand that is our situation is dragging us down faster with every passing second. 

Kaz is still looking rough. He’s a living example of how being able to withstand violence isn’t necessarily a good thing. 

 “What is this guy? Besides the obvious. “ I text. 

“He’s on a lot of radars, but to the best of anyone’s knowledge, he’s just some asshole. You’d think the headline would be that he has a  scrap of the ripper in his skull, but it isn’t. 

No one can find anything on him before about 4 years ago. And even then, it’s spotty. 

This might not sound like a big deal, but I’ve never seen someone that the collective efforts of the nosiest pricks on either side of the void can’t figure out. 

Regardless, this guy can do 2 things you need, spill blood and cause shit. “ JP assures me. 

“Do we need to worry about him?” I question. 

“Yes, of course. What part of anything I said was unclear? 

Unstable, unknown, unfriendly. Christ, how much brain did you get left with?

I’m texting you a location. If you get out, I’ll be there. Then we can see what we can do for Leo. “ JP says, dropping the call. 

I hide the phone, but realize it’s been a while since I’ve seen one of the guards or twisted medical personnel walk by. 

The sounds of other entities, caged and tortured , ring through the grim hallway. 

“Kaz, how are things coming along?” I ask, fear and panic rising. 

“It’s going to be a while still. “ Kaz says, punctuating  the sentence with a pained scream of his own. 

I’m going to spoil things, just a bit, what happens next, feels like the end of the world. 

And contrary to popular belief, the end of the world doesn’t start with a whimper, or a bang, but a song. 

Two guards walk into the hallway, human, or close enough. 

Doesn’t make them any less intimidating though. Heavily armed, and in tactical gear that’d be at home in a warzone, they patrol the cells. 

“Subject 248 has escaped, repeat , subject 248 has escaped. Non-lethal force only has been authorized. We must retrieve the asset. “ A voice barks through a military grade walkie-talkie system.

The taller of the two, a man with a caustic looking facial scar, presses a button on a mounted speaker, “ Roger.” He says, looking to his companion and nodding. 

They both draw stout, arcing batons from hip holsters. 

The sound of broken glass, a doorway at the end of the hall is plunged into darkness. 

“Hello darkness my old friend. 
I’ve come to talk to you again. “ A thin, sinister voice half-sings. 

The guards exchange glances, standing firm, almost amused. 

Another lightbulb bursts, barely audible footsteps. 

“Because a vision softly creeping. 

Left it’s seeds while I was sleeping.” The voice gains volume, taking on an eager, almost wavering tone. 

“There’s only one way down the hallway, this dickhead is just trying to shake us up. “ the shorter guard, a man with  red hair and ghost white skin, says. 

Two more lightbulbs give way, there’s fifteen feet or so of visibility, the rest of the hallway is black as pitch. 

“And the vision that was planted in my brain, still remains. “The voice is no longer singing, the ancient song’s lyrics sound like a threat. 

The shorter guard stumbles to the side, hitting the bars of our cell. His companion is confused, and to be honest, so am I. 

But as the man starts to fall to his knees, I see it. 

A piece of jagged steel protrudes from the side of his skull. Blood falls in sheets as the man starts to gibber nonsense, clawing at the metal futilely. 

“Within the sound, of silence.” The voice croons. 

The taller guard attempts to grab his speaker, to radio for backup.  

There’s a moment, where you can tell this man, who willingly chose this evil job realizes how much of a mistake it was. A look of shock as a rough, brutal length of metal, nothing more than a sharpened piece of debris spins end over end, first severing his hand, then the cord of the Walkie-talkie and finally buries itself in his shoulder. 

The part of my brain that loves watching pain and brutality, is being absolutely outshined by fear. 

Now, this may seem dramatic, even confusing. But you need to understand something. The difference between terror and horror. 

Terror, is the fear of the unknown. Horror is the revulsion once it’s revealed. 

Horror, I’ve been modified to love, terror, sadly, I can very much feel. 

 
From the darkness, walks a figure as confusing as the fact my creator didn’t snip out the fear centres of my brain. 

It’s the man from before, of course. He’s wearing torn, bloodstained pants, shirtless, and carrying a military style duffel bag. 

His hands and forearms are covered in so much blood and gore it  looks like he’s wearing gloves. The man’s left hand holds something but I can’t tell what it is.  The shirtless psycho’s body is a detailed map of wounds that tell a story of torture, escape and revenge. 

The man’s body language is half way between  apex predator and drunken schizophrenic. His stroll to the two mortally wounded men is casual but eager, as if he’s savoring every moment. 

“In restless dreams, I’ve walked alone, narrow streets of cobblestone.” The pale figure comments in a wondering tone. 

In an instant he slams the object in his hand into the taller guard’s head. The quarter brick cracks the guard’s skull, and he falls backward, legs flailing like a dying spider as he tries to keep his footing. 


The lunatic drops to all fours searching for something on the ground. I get a good look at him, and see that he’s flensed the tattooed jester’s makeup from his face. Accurately enough to keep the sharp, angled patterns.  His lips are ripped and torn from the oversized ball-gag, completing the clown from hell look. 

“ ‘Neath the halo of a streetlamp, I turned my collar to the cold and damp. “ The mysterious killer mumbles to himself, then his face brightens, as he finds what he’s looking for, a wicked grin causing blood to ooze from his torn lips, “ When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light!” He screams. 

Neither guard is in a state to defend themselves. The clown blinds them with a shard of shattered lightbulb. 

He finishes his grim task, slowly turning toward Kaz and myself. His smile is full of shattered, almost fang-like teeth, his voice though hoarse seems normal. 

“You two the puppet and the ‘Candyman’ ?” he asks. 

“ Yes. “ Kaz says, trying and failing to rise. 

I nod. 

“ I’m Mike. “ The tall stranger says, taking a keycard from one of the dying guards and opening the cell door. 

He throws the duffel on the cement floor, and unzips it. 

“So, You look like ten pounds of shit in a five pound bag, Slenderman. How long is it going to be before you can walk?” Mike asks. 

“ I don’t know, maybe five minutes if I’m lucky. But I’ll be in no state to fight. Who, are you? “ Kaz replies. 

Mike laughs. 

“No fucking clue my guy” He says, rapping his bare skull with one hand, “ There’s a lot of loose nuts and bolts up here, and separating those from all the paranormal horseshit, that’s a task I gave up on a while ago. 

What I do, is kill people. Believe it or not, It gets kind of boring. I’ve always wanted to kill monsters. “

Mike lets the comment hang, bringing out a long purple jacket from the bag. 

“Jesus Christ no. “ He says tossing the garment aside. 

Kaz’s eyes go wide. 

“That fabric is indestructible. “ He comments, wincing in pain as ribs begin to fuse. 

“You wear it then, I’m not walking around here looking like the god-damned joker. 

Actually, let’s trade. “ Mike says taking Kaz’s jacket and shirt. They  hang absurdly off of the man.  

The supposedly indestructible garment sits on the ground clearly too small for Kaz. 

 “So, here’s my dilemma. Your friend says the shit in this bag has enough chutzpah to let my punch my M-card. And all I have to do to keep it , is cause enough of a distraction to let you two get out of here. 

Now, five minutes fighting whatever the hell Pi’s A-team is, that’s going to be risky as hell. “ Mike says, pulling a walking stick topped with what I can feel is a lead plated infant’s skull from the duffel. 

It radiates an energy that makes me walk backward. 

“But sending you two on your way, that’d put a notch in my belt and let me get out of here before the shit really hits the fan. “ He stalks toward Kaz. 

My friend tries to move backward, but succeeds in nothing more than making himself scream. 

Mike taps Kaz’s shoulder with the head of the walking stick, the flesh peels back like wax under a welder’s torch. 

“So, tall, warped and handsome, I’m going to ask you a question, and keep in mind I know the answer. 

When you were talking to Pi, you said you were buddies with the god damn cancer I’ve got stuck in my brain. 

Were you?” Mike asks. 

Every sense I have tells me this person in front of me is just that, a person. But the look he gives Kaz, is as terrifying as anything I’ve seen yet. 

“We could be found in the same circles for a time.  “ Kaz replies, ashamed.

“God-damn it. “ Mike sighs, moving the walking stick, “ Guess you’re walking out of here then. 

But someday, I’m going to want to know everything you know about Demi. Understood ?” 

 “Whatever you ask, just…” As Kaz talks, I see the strangest thing. 

For a moment, Mike’s features and body language change. The voice that comes from him isn’t that of an abused lunatic, but smooth, almost, cultured. 

“Kaz, you have to help me…” The second voice says, panicked. 

Mike’s face contorts, there’s clearly some kind of internal struggle happening. 

Our demented savior grabs the cell bars and begins to slam his face into them.  He stumbles backward, shaking his head. 

“Nice try Jack, but you weren’t the first voice in my head, and you wont be the last. 

Now, you, lil fella. You going to be any use?” Mike asks, regaining what passes for his wits. 

I swap out a hand for one of my blades. The killer snickers. 

“Oh that’s just god-damned adorable. Like a little recalled Muppet or something. “ As Mike talks he begins talking an assortment of various items from the duffel, some, like a pistol and an onyx handled knife, have obvious uses, others though, resonate with a powerful ethereal energy. I have no idea what they do, and I’m guessing neither does Mike. 

Noise from the door on the lit end of the hallway, resonant, rhythmic banging. I can hear hinges start to bend and screech. It’s being breached. 

“Must have had those goons on a heart monitor or something. Thought I’d have had a bit more time. 

  What’s the Eta Tall Man?” Mike asks wrapping a white silk scarf around one hand. 

Kaz rises to one knee shakily. 

“ Another minute or two.” Kaz says shamefully. 

“Sounds like 4 of them, nothing close to human. 

I can keep them busy for 3 minutes, maybe even put one of them down if your friend wasn’t full of shit. But you two need to be making your way to the warehouse by then. Once things start going south, I’m out. “ Mike explains. 

I have no way to text a reply, so I nod. 

“ My thanks.” Kaz says. 

“Just remember your end of the deal when the time comes. For your sake. “ Mike states. 

The door tears off it’s hinges, heavy, trudging footsteps from the far end of the hall. The other trapped entities begin a torrent of screamed abuse and threats. 

Like someone flipped a switch Mike’s body language changes and he walks into the hallway, one hand running the skull topped cane along the cell bars. 

I make my way to the open cell door, keeping an eye on the situation while Kaz begins to attempt standing. 

4 entities, at the back stand two hulking things that look like someone stopped making a werewolf half way through. Mottled, rash covered skin, small patches of long, wiry hair sprouting at random, and faces twisted into a myopic toddlers drawing of a canine visage. 

Leading them is short, thin, feminine looking creature. It’s human shaped with deep purple skin and white eyes. Her fingers split toward the ends, long thin almost tentacle like growths moving like undersea life. 

Behind her, is something ethereal, a grey, smog-like thing that looms above. 

Mike starts to talk, but the leader holds up one strange finger, almost seductively. 

Her eyes start to form black, spinning spirals. She grins, revealing small, pointed teeth. 

Mike stops dead in his tracks, head lolling to one side slightly. 

“Brains over brawn boys. “ the lovecraftian hypnotist says to her compatriots. 

I’m shocked at the clear, northern English accent that comes from the dog-like creature closest to the door. 

“Don’t underestimate him Kim, you saw the mess he left. “ 

“Fair enough.” Kim says, her grin widening, making her look even more like some kind of undersea abomination, “ Clown, I’m hungry.”

Without hesitation Mike takes the stiletto bladed knife  and cuts a thick piece of flesh from his arm and begins to walk forward. 

“Satisfied Peter? 

Clown, bandage yourself before you bleed out and get us all killed. “ Kim demands, smugly. 

Mike wraps his forearm in the white fabric from the duffel. Blood quickly soaks it, but the makeshift bandage does it’s best. 

“Kneel” Kim commands holding out her hand. 

Mike complies, offering up his flesh, his face blank. 

The creature greedily consumes the gift. 

My heart sinks, Kaz manages to stumble and drag himself a few feet to see our last chance of hope enraptured by whatever the hell Kim is. 

Peter laughs, “ Jorge, we’re getting that promotion man. “. The other dog-like thing smiles and agrees. 

As Kim licks the last of Mike’s blood from her Alien fingers, Mike speaks. 

“I’ll take that back now.” He says. 

The man moves fast enough that I don’t see the blade tear the aquatic looking entity open from waist to chin. Just the spray of greenish purple fluid and odd looking innards that hit the ground. 

Mike’s on his feet, bandaged arm elbow deep in Kim’s torso. Some kind of reaction is happening, smoke begins to pour from her hollowed chest as Mike tosses her eviscerated body aside. 

Kim begins to break down, flesh turning into a curdled looking soupy mess. In seconds, nothing remains but a sludgy pile and the last scraps of the fabric from mike’s arm, burning to ash. 

“Anyone who wants to get into my head, is going to need to get in fucking line. “ Mike says to the shocked entities. 

There is a moment of stillness, of silence. Before the hallway turns into a warzone. 

His surprize played out it’s obvious Mike is playing for time. He’s landing painful, unexpected blows, but can’t press his attack. 

He pulls trick after trick from JP’s duffel. A strike from the cane shatters the jaw of one of the dog things, a splash of liquid from a silver flask causes the ethereal creature to back itself into a corner. But they press on. 

Kaz starts to take small, unsteady steps, his torso is still mangled, his skin is loose and unhealthy looking, but the look on his face is determined. 

Mike is losing ground, saved only by the fact that these killers have been muzzled by their leader. 

“We need to leave. “ Kaz says, coughing, as he starts to walk out of the cell. 

   
His first few steps are slow, but I think we can finally get the hell out of this place. 

Everything happening is so beyond us, and our abilities, I feel small, afraid, I need to be out of this place. I couldn’t feel anything less like the weapon I was created to be. 

Kaz trips, as he hits the ground, something in the cell across from us reaches a long fingered, black clawed hand through the bars, grabbing Kaz by the neck. 

I panic stabbing at the wrist of the thing, Kaz struggles but fractured arms provide no grip against whatever fresh horror lies within the cell. 

Mike is violently slammed into the floor then ceiling by the ghost like entity. The impact leaves him bleeding and stumbling like a drunk. 

“Fuck this” Jorge says, one eye torn out at some point during the scrum. 

He dashes toward Mike, low and feral, and grabs the stunned man by the crotch with one hand and shoulder with the other. 

I saw through enough tendons that the thing in the cell releases Kaz. Coughing and sputtering, he begins to limp as fast as he can toward the warehouse. 

I can’t take my eyes off the fight. For a moment, I look at it through the implanted eye. Thinking maybe I can see something to help. 

I don’t , in fact, what I don’t see is what raises questions. In between all of the indescribable patterns of the supernatural, Mike, is nothing. Not the dim streak normal folks are but a void of nothing that stands out like a sore thumb. 

Peter and the ghost like thing try and stop him but Jorge begins to try and tear Mike in half. Rage overtaking even his fear of his demonic master. 

There’s a blinding flash of light in the dim hallway as Jorge ignites. A glass bottle shatters against the ground as the Canine creature drops the Clown. 

It's a brief victory, the thing is hurt and stunned, but already rolling on the ground, smothering the flames. 

“Punch!” Kaz screams from the warehouse door, “We need to move!”

Mike’s life can be measured in seconds, what’s left of my conscience screams at me to help him, but as I look through the door I realize salvation isn’t as close as I thought. That Kaz and I have our own problems ahead. 

Before the warehouse was terrifying in a mundane way. Brutal in a kind of Ed Gein way. 

But the abattoir in front of us, isn’t just some psychopath’s playground anymore. 

Clearly Pi has lost his patience. The warehouse is an evil infused hellscape. Biological looking walls, animated hooks and chains, victims scrambling with garish wounds  it’s like someone dredged up a corner of hell.

And this is what we have to get through. 

Like always, I need your help. Kaz can’t fight, i can’t reach JP, and Mike has his own things to deal with, for as long as he can survive anyway. 

Please, hurry, and everyone give their ideas. Because of all the things I expected, literally going through hell isn’t one of them.
