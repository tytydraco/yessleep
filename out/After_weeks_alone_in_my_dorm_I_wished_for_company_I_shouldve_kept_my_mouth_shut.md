My roommate moved out weeks ago to stay with his guardian, so now I'm alone in a two-person dorm. Everyone else has a roommate (at least from what I know), and it's practically mandatory. But not me, well not after he left.

He was having problems falling asleep. His health wasn't keeping really well, and he often woke up startled at night.. I never had such experiences. Maybe he just needed some help. Help I couldn't offer.

So.. it was around 1 AM on a late Friday night. I was well, half-heartedly studying for some elective I couldn't care less about when I decided to head down to our central dining hall for some water to fill my bottle with. 

The cooler was in there on the floor below.

As I locked the door behind me, I could sense an off-feeling gnaw at me. The dorm that night.. it felt off.

Normally, you'd spot someone grabbing a snack, heating up leftovers, or just pacing the halls and corridors on their phone. But that night - nothing. No footsteps, murmurs, and not even the night guards.

The dorm, it was dead silent. 

When I reached the dining hall, the lights were off. Only a single pale tube-light flickered above the water cooler. I walked in, half-asleep, and started filling my bottle.

All I could hear at that moment was the soft hum of the cooler and the buzzing light above.

That's exactly when I heard it.

A loud, metallic *clang* that echoed from somewhere deeper in the hall - sharp, sudden, like a tray flung across the kitchen floor. I was paralyzed for a moment.

The wet bottle slipped from my hand and hit the floor with a hollow thud, rolling a little before settling. There was no one there.

I didn't even bother checking where the sound came from. Just snatched the damn bottle from the floor and bolted outside toward the stairs, heart pounding.

As I rushed back up to my floor.. I could swear I heard manic footsteps pace just a few feet behind me, trying to match my pace. Every time I slowed, they slowed too.

As was *law*, I didn't dare to look back.

I turned into the hallway on my floor, breathing heavily from climbing the stairs. Almost on my knees, as I stopped by to collect my breathing, I saw something.

At the far end, near the exit where the lights barely reached, stood a thin figure just inside the darkness. Perfectly still, facing me.

It didn't move, nor did it make a sound. I didn't either.

I backed toward my room without breaking eye contact. I could swear I saw it begin to pace towards me. The keys almost slipped from my hand but I managed to get in before it could get closer.

In another blink before I entered my room, it was gone. Like it had never been there. I was surely seeing things.

I slammed the door behind me. Standing by my desk, I chugged some water to calm myself down. Maybe I was just sleep-deprived. Maybe the silence was getting to me.. I didn't know.

Either ways, I needed to sleep. I killed the lights off and called it a day as I slipped into bed. For the first time in weeks, the empty bed by my side felt rather uncanny to look at.

I prefer staying alone, but that night I really hoped someone would drop in. (Bad thing to ask for, reflecting on it now)

Eventually, after tossing around for a bit, I must have dozed off. It didn't last long though. At around 2:33 AM, I was yanked out of sleep by a violent banging at my door.

*"Please! Please let me in! Help me!"* 

A voice screamed. It was desperate, panicked - like someone was being chased. The knocks came at an unnatural speed, just as if someone was trying to tear the door apart.

I shot up, heart in my throat. I waited, listened, and it didn't stop.

*"Please! Open... Open the door!!"*

It sounded so real. So close. I got up hesitantly and slowly opened the door.

There was no one there. Not a soul in the hallway. 

At first I thought maybe it was some clever prankster, just someone messing around late at night for kicks. But the layout of the hall didn't make sense for that. 

There were no corners to duck behind, no rooms close enough to run into unnoticed. If it indeed was someone, I should've heard their trailing footsteps or at least them turning around a corner.

But there was nothing. Only silence.

I knocked on a few nearby doors, still half in disbelief. No one answered. Either they were out cold or didn't want to get involved.

Eventually, I left my door slightly ajar and decided to check on the door just adjacently opposite to mine. The one that belonged to Kent, who I didn't really get along with.. and didn't know much about. 

We had just exchanged about five words in total. I didn't like his vibe, really off-putting.

I hesitated for a while, hand hovering mid-air, but then I knocked. Light at first, and then again, louder. 

After a few seconds, the door creaked open, and I didn't expect that.

He looked groggy as hell.. like I had just pulled him out of a coma, and he stared at me, clearly annoyed. 

Before I could say anything, I noticed someone behind him in the dim red light from his nightlamp. It was guy, maybe his weird roommate, sitting upright with his knees drawn in, arms wrapped around.

A few books lay open on the floor in front of him, but he wasn't reading it. Just staring at me.

His eyes didn't move.. they looked dried and sleep starved, like he hadn't been sleeping for weeks. He didn't even blink.

And there.. there was this *faint* smile to his face - just subtle, but way too still, almost mischievous. 

Everything looked off. Maybe he was a stoner.

I looked back at Kent. *"Was that you?"* I asked. *"The banging.. the yelling!? Don't act .. come on. Just admi-"* He cut me through bitterly, *"Gosh... just go to sleep.. I don't know what the fuck you're on about.. just.. just go away"*, behind him, his roommate, slowly tilted his head.. still locked onto me - eyes wide and frozen in place.

*"What about your roommate? What is he onto?"* at this point of time Kent just blabbered away, groggy and agitated - not making sense of what I asked *"I dunno.. mate you .. fucking weirdo come on just.. just.. get lost"* and shut the door to my face. 

I could hear my door slightly tug back from the wind as the door closed. But it felt *too timed*.

I stood there for a second, staring at the closed door, fuming quietly as I proceeded to head to my room. It had to be that guy. Kent's weird-ass roommate. Probably some late-night psycho-prank they thought was hilarious.

*"Fucking freaks"* I muttered, slamming my door shut.

I did wonder why nobody else seemed to hear or complain about the loud banging on my door. Could it be that only I heard it?

I shut the door and locked it. Hard.

I lay in bed trying to get some sleep as I pulled the covers over my face. My thoughts wouldn't shut up. Something was terribly wrong.

I turned over, punched my pillow into shape. Rolled again. I felt my head throb.

Then I noticed it - a faintly metallic, almost musty smell. Like rusted iron mixed with dust and something bitter.

And that's when... I saw them. Two eyes.

Stark white - wide and slightly red-veined.. staring at me from the far corner of the room, just above where the closet met the wall. Unblinking, still, and watching.

I froze. I didn’t move. Didn’t breathe. Just stared back at them.. caught in a deadlock.

They didn’t shift. Didn’t blink. The longer I looked, the more real they became not some foul trick of light, not some reflection.

Then in a blink, they vanished.

And before I could even register it, I heard a horrid giggle sound behind me.

Low yet sharp - like someone trying not to laugh but failing miserably. Like it hurt to do it.

I snapped behind, almost falling off the bed. By the wall, just beside the thermostat, stood a figure, its hands feeling the wall.

Thin and tall - its limbs looked too long, like they’d been dislocated and stretched. Its skin was dark, almost black, but patchy, like cloth pulled tight over flesh and lit ablaze.

Its mouth was stitched shut. It tilted its head toward me, and then lunged.

I barely managed to leap off the bed. Its hands closely missed my right leg as I ran for the door.

I slipped once on the damn floor mat, adrenaline deep into my veins. I could feel it right behind me, too close.

It grabbed at me again, catching my ankle just as I reached the door. I kicked blindly and yanked myself free.

I threw the door open and stumbled out into the hall. The moment I crossed the threshold it stopped and the door slammed shut behind me. Hard and fast.

I didn’t go back. I didn’t even look back. I just sat at the top of the stairwell with my knees to my chest, and waited for morning to come.

I must've dozed off by the stairwell. Or maybe I just blacked out from exhaustion. 

When I opened my eyes, sunlight was streaming in through the glass blocks by the landing. 

The dorm was alive again.. doors opening, people moving about. I waited a bit longer before going back to my room.

My room was the same. The bed, the walls, that damn thermostat; all fine. Nothing out of place. 

I checked every corner and I couldn't find anything weird. Maybe my brain had finally snapped under stress. 

Maybe the figure was just a bad dream. Everything after that prank.. that stupid prank. I decided to confront Kent.. or *his roommate.*

So I knocked on his door again. He looked slightly more human this time, though still annoyed I was there. That shady freak wasn't in.

*"Where's he?"* I asked. *"What are you talking about?... Who?"* he asked, agitated.

*"Look, I really don't know what happened last night. I didn't sleep well.. I had a bad dream - all because of that freaky roommate of yours. Where is he? That pranks-"*

Kent cut me off, growing pale.. ***"What roommate?"***

I stared at him, confused. *"That sicko on the floor... reading those books.. staring at me, sat by your bed?? Whatever. that freak."*

Kent blinked slowly, closing the door shut behind him. *"I don't have a roommate."* he said.

I laughed. Not because it was funny.. it was a nervous laugh. *"No.. no.. seriously. That guy.. who was that?'* 

*“I’m not messing with you,”* Kent said, eyes a little less defensive now. 

*“This is a single. I picked it up because no one else wanted it.. there were rumors about this senior who used to live here… obsessed with occult crap, went off the rails.. got himself killed. You know how rumors are.”*

He paused. *“I’ve... always lived alone.”*

We stood there in silence for a bit.

Then he scratched the back of his neck and mumbled, “Hey, uh… if you’re ever up for it, I dunno. Maybe we could split one of these doubles? I’ve been thinking about moving anyway... don't feel like staying here anymore.”

I didn’t say anything right away.

But yes, I nodded.
