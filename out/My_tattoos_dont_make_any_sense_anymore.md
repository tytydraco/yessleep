\[PART 1\]

A few months ago I got some cool tattoos. I explicitly remember going to the tattoo shop and getting these tattoos. One of which being of is of a clock with rose quartz surrounding the clock. I feels like it still makes sense but not all the way. I also got a tattoo that says "PYE = 3,15".

I woke up last week and though to myself as I was looking in the mirror "we don't use rose quartz for clocks?". But I forgot about it quickly and moved a long.

The day after I woke up again only to notice that my other tattoo with the pye constant doesn't make sense anymore and everything looks smaller. Like everything, it just looks smaller somehow but I cannot explain it.

A few hours ago I went out with this girl, we have been dating for a while now. She saw my tattoos and started laughing.

"What the hell is pye?"

"It's pye?... the constant, you know from school when we learned about wheels and stuff?"

"Well that's not right. Sure we use pye but it's 3,14 and not 3,15. It's "PI" not "PYE", with a P and I. Did you ask for that tattoo whilst drunk? If so then you could sue the artist because they should've be allowed to tattoo people whilst they are intoxicated."

"Well no I wasn't drunk. I didn't drink that day. And I get what you mean but it isn't right, like it feels wrong to spell pye that way. Also, do you feel as if things are smaller now somehow?"

"Smaller, smaller how?"

"I don't know, I can't explain it but it just feels smaller, stuff that are round looks smaller, not by much but I can tell they aren't as big as before."

"Oookaay and I can tell that this won't go anywhere. Don't fucking ask me out if you're going to be high out of your mind on some fucking drug like this."

"What do you mean?!"

And then she just walked out on me, she was really mad and I feel bad but like... I wasn't mad. I was just telling her that things didn't feel right to me.

Anyhow, I got home and tried to forget about it. Now, an hour ago, my ex shows up and asks if we can talk. She has tattoos as well. She asked me how many planets we have continuously in a really nervous fashion and then left.

I didn't quite get it, she showed me her tattoo of two planets, both of which looked identical but she kept saying "where are they, where is it, why aren't they doing something about this??!". I don't get what's going on and I feel lost. She left just now and for some reason I trust what she said but I don't get what she meant. It felt real but I didn't get it.

I will keep you guys posted, need to barge my mobile collective again.
