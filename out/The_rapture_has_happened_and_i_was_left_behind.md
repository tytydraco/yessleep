The rapture has happened, and I was left behind. All my life, I questioned the existence of a god. I sinned repeatedly, grappling with the idea that there couldn’t be a god—at least not the one that Christians described. I thought I was right. It happened yesterday while I was working my cashier job at the local grocery store. Suddenly, I was blinded by a light emanating from the sky. As my eyes adjusted, I realized the sky was no longer its usual blue; instead, golden rays enveloped everything in sight. It was breathtaking. In that moment, I knew what was unfolding. A being descended through a crack in the sky—some sort of man-like creature draped in a pristine white robe that radiated an aura of superiority. It was God. I chose silence, mesmerized. I ran outside, unable to look away. Co-workers, friends, strangers—millions—began to float toward the being. I remained anchored to the ground. Then, the being spoke: “My children. Come witness your spiritual bodies in my kingdom. This day has been foretold since my word was created. The rest of you are not my children. Those who remain will face the punishment I leave for you. Blasphemers, murderers, rapists. Ye who remain shall surely go to Lucifer.” Tears welled in my eyes. What kind of god was this? I felt an overwhelming urge to shout, “Why us, God? What did you expect? You gave us a book—that was it! What kind of king are you?” For a fleeting moment, I could have sworn He looked down at me specifically. I turned and walked back into the store, standing amidst the chaos. I knew more painful emotions were yet to come, but I was determined to survive as long as possible.

A month has passed since that day. My parents are gone. My brother is gone. Everyone. Now, embers of some kind of fire rain down—little bits at a time. I’ve contemplated ending my own life, but I refuse to succumb. I will live as long as I can. I vow to anyone reading this: I won’t die by my own hand. I’ve begun to wake each morning with strange carvings etched into my skin. This morning, it was “Woe to those left behind.” I can’t make sense of it. What does it even mean? As I write this, riots and looting dominate the news. Is this what God wanted? To sow doubt about His existence, then watch us turn on one another? If He’s still watching, I hope He sees the consequences of His actions. Children are dying every day. I will update this journal each month.

Two months in: The fire has intensified with each rainfall. My house is the only one on my block untouched by the chaos. It seems there were a lot of Christians running this country. Everything is in disarray—pure anarchy. I met a woman who was stuck in the rain. I let her in, treated her wounds, and offered her shelter. She accepted. You wouldn’t think there could be happiness amidst this despair, but the rain has become a norm, and she and I have found a rhythm, living as we did before the rapture. Her name is Misty. I plan to start updating on our food supply each month; crops are nearly impossible to grow in this fire rain. For now, we have enough to last a year if we ration wisely.

Three months in: The fire rains persist daily. Between downpours, I check the roof. A few weeks ago, we found sheet metal and reinforced our home. It should withstand the flames. Misty and I have grown closer—I feel a connection with her, but it frightens me. If something happened to her, I don’t know how I would cope. The rioting and looting have slowed, mainly because there’s nothing left to steal. The fire has decimated wildlife, so hunting is futile. Our entertainment has become board games. We discovered a stash of guns and food, ensuring we’re relatively well-off—enough provisions for up to two years if we’re careful.

Seven months in: My phone broke, and I haven’t found a replacement. Everything has deteriorated. We are the last people left in town, though raiders have passed through occasionally. The only thing keeping me sane is Misty. A while back, she kissed me, and we’ve been together ever since. It feels reckless to care for someone in these dire times, but perhaps if I’m careful, it will be alright. I managed to get a radio working and have been trying to broadcast a message for help—a plea for a community we could join. So far, there’s been no response. The rain has ceased, and we’re unsure why. Misty and I are honing our skills with weapons, just in case. We have about a year’s worth of food left—maybe a year and a half if we ration well.

Five years in: I just found a functioning phone. If God is still watching, I want Him to end my suffering. If the devil is, I hope he does too. Misty is gone. Our child, Sean, is gone. He was only three years old. Why, God? What did we do? We did nothing. What a terrible king you are. How are my parents? How is my brother? Where are the souls you took? Damn you, God. If I can reach heaven, I’ll find you and confront you myself. Listen closely, God: I have a Beretta M9 aimed at my temple. I’m coming for you, you liar. Misty, I’ll see you again. Just wait for me.

I’ll make a new post when I’m done with this. If anyone sees this, good luck. Keep surviving. Maybe you’ll see me emerge from this darkness and end it.
