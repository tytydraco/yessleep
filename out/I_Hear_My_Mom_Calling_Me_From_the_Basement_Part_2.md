I’m writing this from my closet.

I don't know where else to go.  
When the footsteps reached my bedroom door, I did the only thing I could think of — I slipped into the closet and pulled the door shut behind me, trying not to make a sound.

I’m still not sure if it saw me.

For a while, it was just standing there.  
I could hear its breathing — a wet, ragged sound, like someone struggling to suck air through waterlogged lungs.

The air inside the closet is hot and stale. I can smell old laundry, dust, my own sweat. Every breath feels too loud, like it’s echoing off the walls. I pressed my back against the far corner, squeezing myself as small as possible between the hanging coats.

Then it spoke.

Not a knock. Not a whisper.  
It spoke, low and broken, right outside my door.

"Let me in, sweetheart. I'm so cold."

It sounded wrong. The words hit the wrong notes in my ears, like someone playing a familiar song on an out-of-tune piano.  
The voice had a shape to it, if that makes any sense — thick and heavy, like it was trying to force its way under the door and wrap itself around me.

I pressed my hand over my mouth to keep from making a sound.  
Tears stung the corners of my eyes, but I didn’t dare let out even a sniffle.

After a long moment, the door handle jiggled.  
Softly at first, then harder.  
Like it was testing how much pressure it would take to snap the lock.

I don’t know why — maybe some leftover instinct — but I started whispering a prayer under my breath.  
I haven’t been religious in years. Neither had my mom, really.  
But right then, it was the only thing I could think to do.  
The words felt shaky and unfamiliar, like trying to walk a path I’d forgotten.

Eventually, the rattling stopped.

Now... it's quiet.  
Too quiet.

I want to believe it’s gone. I want to believe I’m safe to come out.  
But I can feel it.

Something is still out there, just beyond the door, waiting.  
I can see its shadow through the gap at the bottom — a thick, unmoving smudge that blocks the hallway light completely.

The closet is getting colder.

The thin fabric of my pajama pants clings to my skin, damp with sweat. My hands are trembling so badly I almost dropped my phone while typing this.

And worse — when I strained to listen a second ago, I heard something else.

Another voice.

From the direction of the basement.

Faint... but this time, not calling for me.

It was calling to something.

I couldn’t catch the words. Just the tone — low, urgent, almost pleading.

Whatever it said, the thing outside my closet heard it — because just now, it started moving again.

But not like footsteps this time.  
It’s dragging itself.

Slowly, heavily, across the floorboards, as if its legs don’t work properly.  
There’s a sticky, scraping noise with every pull.  
The sound of something too heavy, too broken, trying to crawl toward me.

Closer.

Closer.

The closet door creaked just now.

I can see the edge of the handle shifting slightly, almost imperceptibly.

I’m holding my breath so hard my chest hurts.  
My heart is pounding so loud, I'm sure it can hear it.

I don’t know how much longer I can stay quiet.  
I don’t know if it’s waiting for me to scream — or if it’s just playing with me before it forces its way inside.

If I survive this... if there’s even a chance... I’ll update again.

But if you don’t hear from me —  
if this is the last thing I post —

Please.

Don’t answer when the basement calls you.
