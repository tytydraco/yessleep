The moment she walked into my office, I knew there was something off about her. It wasn’t anything overt or easily identifiable. If anything, Emily looked ordinary—late twenties, dark hair pulled into a neat ponytail, dressed in a simple blouse and jeans. But there was something in the way she moved, the way she smiled, that set my nerves on edge. I’ve been a therapist for over fifteen years, and I’ve learned to trust my instincts. They’ve never failed me before.

"Hello, Dr. Collins," she said, her voice calm and composed as she extended her hand.

“Please, call me Rose,” I replied, taking her hand. Her grip was firm, her skin cold.

She settled into the chair across from my desk, crossing her legs with a practiced ease. Her gaze never wavered, and her smile remained fixed in place—polite, friendly even, but devoid of warmth. I felt a faint chill in the room, though I knew it wasn’t the temperature.

Emily was referred to me by a colleague who believed she needed help with anger management. The notes I received were brief, almost too brief, but they suggested she was struggling with deep-seated issues related to control and detachment. Nothing unusual, at least not on paper. But now, sitting in front of her, I had the distinct impression that Emily was far more complex than her file suggested.

“So, Emily,” I began, folding my hands in my lap. “What brings you here today?”

She tilted her head slightly, as if considering the question. “I’ve been told I have anger issues,” she said with a small shrug. “But I don’t feel angry. Not really.”

I nodded, noting her response. “Tell me more about that. When do you feel… off?”

She paused, her eyes narrowing slightly. “It’s not anger,” she said slowly, as though she were measuring each word. “It’s more like… frustration. But even that doesn’t quite fit. It’s like… everyone around me is playing a game, and I’m the only one who knows the rules.”

There it was again—that unsettling feeling creeping up my spine. I leaned forward slightly, my interest piqued. “What kind of game?”

Emily’s smile widened, but it didn’t reach her eyes. “A game of control,” she said softly. “Of power.”

Her words hung in the air between us, heavy and charged with something I couldn’t quite identify. I’ve dealt with patients who have control issues before, but this felt different—darker, more calculated.

“How do you express this control?” I asked carefully, watching her closely.

She seemed to consider this for a moment before responding. “I test people,” she said simply. “I push them to see how far they’ll go before they break.”

A chill ran down my spine, but I kept my expression neutral. “Can you give me an example?”

Emily’s smile remained fixed as she spoke. “There was this girl in high school. Her name was Sarah. She was perfect—always happy, always smiling. It annoyed me. So, I decided to see how much of that happiness was real.”

I made a note on my pad, my heart beating a little faster. “What did you do?”

“I spread rumors,” she said, her tone so matter-of-fact it was almost eerie. “I sabotaged her friendships, made sure everyone turned against her. It was easy. And when she finally broke down, when she was crying in the bathroom all alone… I felt nothing.”

I stared at her, my pen hovering above the paper. There was no remorse in her eyes, no sign of guilt. Just a cold, detached curiosity.

“And that was the first time,” she continued, her voice steady and calm. “The first time I realized how much I enjoyed it.”

My breath caught in my throat, but I forced myself to stay composed. This wasn’t the first time I’d dealt with a patient who showed signs of psychopathy, but there was something about Emily that felt different—more dangerous.

“How did that make you feel?” I asked, trying to keep my voice even.

Emily shrugged again, as if the answer was obvious. “In control. Powerful.”

“And did you ever do anything like that again?”

Her smile widened, and this time, there was a spark of something in her eyes—excitement, perhaps. “Oh, yes. Many times.”

Session Two

I barely slept the night after that first session. Emily's words played over and over in my mind, like a broken record. There was something wrong with her—something deeply, fundamentally wrong. But I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. All I knew was that she had enjoyed hurting someone, and she had no remorse for it.

When Emily walked into my office for our second session, she seemed more relaxed, more open. Her smile was less guarded, though no less unsettling.

“How have you been since our last session?” I asked as she took her seat.

“Good,” she replied, her voice cheerful. “I’ve been thinking a lot about our conversation.”

I nodded, leaning forward slightly. “What have you been thinking about?”

She tilted her head, a thoughtful expression on her face. “About control. And power. About how much I enjoy having it.”

There it was again—that creeping sense of dread. But I kept my expression neutral, urging her to continue.

“After I realized how much I liked that feeling,” she said, her voice growing softer, “I started looking for other ways to get it. To feel in control.”

“And how did you do that?” I asked, my pen poised over my notepad.

Emily’s smile widened, and this time, there was no mistaking the excitement in her eyes. “I started choosing my targets more carefully,” she said. “People who wouldn’t be missed. People who deserved it.”

“Deserved it?” I repeated, trying to keep my voice steady.

She nodded. “People who were cruel, or selfish, or just… annoying.”

“And what did you do to them?” I asked, though I was almost afraid to hear the answer.

Emily leaned back in her chair, her gaze fixed on me. “I killed them,” she said, her voice soft, almost tender. “I killed them because it made me feel powerful. Because I wanted to.”

The room seemed to grow colder, and I felt a wave of nausea wash over me. But I forced myself to stay calm, to keep probing.

“Can you tell me about the first time?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

Emily’s eyes lit up, and she leaned forward slightly, as if she were sharing a secret. “The first time was with my neighbor. His name was Mr. Thompson. He was an old man, lived alone. He was always watching me, always trying to talk to me when I didn’t want to. He made me uncomfortable.”

I made a note, my heart pounding in my chest. “What did you do?”

“I waited until one night when he was outside, smoking a cigarette,” she said, her voice growing more animated. “I knew he had a weak heart—he always complained about it. So, I snuck up behind him and startled him. He turned around, clutching his chest, and I just… watched. Watched as he gasped for air, as he fell to the ground. Watched as the life drained out of him.”

I swallowed hard, my hands trembling slightly. “And how did that make you feel?”

Emily’s smile was wide, almost childlike. “Powerful. Like I had control over life and death. It was… exhilarating.”

My mind was racing, trying to process what she was telling me. If what she said was true, then I was sitting across from a serial killer—a woman who had killed for pleasure, for control. And she was telling me about it as if it were the most natural thing in the world.

“What happened after that?” I asked, my voice shaky.

“I was careful,” Emily said, her tone returning to its calm, measured cadence. “I didn’t want to get caught, so I waited. But the feeling… the need… it didn’t go away. So, I found someone else.”

“Who?” I asked, dreading the answer.

“A colleague,” she replied, her voice growing softer. “Her name was Lisa. She was always so smug, always looking down on everyone. I couldn’t stand her.”

“How did you…?”

“I made it look like an accident,” Emily said, cutting me off. “We were working late one night, and she mentioned that she had a terrible headache. I offered her some aspirin, but I swapped it out for something stronger. Something that would stop her heart.”

“And no one suspected?” I asked, my throat dry.

“No one,” Emily replied, her smile widening. “It was so easy. And after that, I couldn’t stop.”

Session Three

By the time our third session came around, I was terrified. Every instinct I had was screaming at me to report her, to tell someone—anyone—what she had confessed. But there was a part of me that hesitated, a part of me that wanted to understand her, to figure out what made her the way she was.

Emily seemed to sense my unease as she entered the room. She greeted me with that same disarming smile, her eyes twinkling with some secret amusement.

“How have you been, Rose?” she asked, taking her seat.

I forced a smile, trying to ignore the tremor in my hands. “I’ve been fine, Emily. How about you?”

“Oh, I’ve been thinking a lot,” she replied, crossing her legs and settling into the chair. Her tone was light, almost casual, as if we were just two friends catching up.

“Thinking about what?” I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.

“About our conversations,” Emily said, her eyes locking onto mine. “About control, about power. About how much I enjoy it.”

My pulse quickened, but I forced myself to remain calm. “And what have you come to realize?”

Emily leaned forward slightly, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. “That it’s not just about the killing,” she said. “It’s about the game. The thrill of the hunt, the satisfaction of knowing I’m smarter, quicker, better than they are.”

I felt a knot tighten in my stomach, but I pressed on. “What do you mean by ‘the game’?”

Emily’s smile widened. “It’s like chess,” she explained, her tone almost playful. “Every move is calculated, every step is planned. The trick is to stay one step ahead, to anticipate their moves before they even realize they’re playing.”

“And what happens when they catch on?” I asked, unable to keep the fear from creeping into my voice.

Emily’s eyes glittered with amusement. “They never do,” she said softly. “That’s what makes it so much fun.”

A shiver ran down my spine as I realized just how dangerous she was—how meticulously she planned everything, how she viewed her victims as mere pawns in her twisted game. And yet, there was something almost intoxicating about her confidence, her certainty. It was as if she truly believed she was invincible.

“And what about your most recent… game?” I asked, choosing my words carefully.

Emily’s expression darkened slightly, and for the first time, I saw a flicker of something in her eyes—something that looked almost like fear. “The last one was different,” she admitted, her voice losing some of its playful edge.

“In what way?” I pressed, my curiosity piqued.

“She fought back,” Emily said, her tone flat. “She wasn’t supposed to, but she did.”

I felt a surge of unease. “Who was she?”

Emily hesitated for a moment before answering. “Her name was Abby. She was a waitress at a diner I used to go to. She was… too happy, too carefree. It irritated me.”

“And what did you do?”

Emily’s eyes grew distant as she recounted the details. “I followed her home one night. I waited until she was alone, and then I approached her. I was careful, as always. But something went wrong. She saw me coming.”

“And she fought back?” I asked, my heart pounding in my chest.

“Yes,” Emily said, her voice tight. “She fought back harder than I expected. She scratched me, bit me. I didn’t think she had it in her, but she did.”

“And what happened then?”

Emily’s gaze hardened. “I had to kill her quickly. It wasn’t as satisfying as I wanted it to be, but I didn’t have a choice. I couldn’t afford to let her live.”

A cold sweat broke out on my forehead as I realized just how close Emily had come to being caught—how she had managed to escape by the skin of her teeth. And yet, despite the danger, she seemed almost disappointed by the outcome, as if the challenge had only added to her frustration.

“It wasn’t the same,” Emily continued, her voice tinged with bitterness. “There was no thrill, no satisfaction. Just… necessity.”

“And how did that make you feel?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

Emily’s eyes locked onto mine, and for a moment, I saw a flash of something dark and primal—something that sent a wave of terror coursing through me. “It made me angry,” she said softly. “Angry that she ruined my game, angry that she made me feel… vulnerable.”

My breath caught in my throat, and I realized just how dangerous Emily truly was. She wasn’t just a killer—she was a predator, a hunter who thrived on the thrill of the chase. And now, she was sitting across from me, telling me her darkest secrets as if they were nothing more than a casual conversation.

I knew I had to do something, but I was paralyzed by fear—fear of what Emily might do if she realized I was onto her, fear of what she was capable of if she felt cornered. And yet, I couldn’t just sit there and do nothing.

“Emily,” I began, my voice shaking slightly, “have you ever considered… stopping?”

Emily’s smile faded, and for a moment, I thought I saw a flicker of confusion in her eyes. “Stopping?” she repeated, as if the concept were foreign to her.

“Yes,” I said, my heart pounding. “Have you ever thought about what might happen if you stopped playing the game? If you walked away from it all?”

Emily stared at me for a long moment, her expression unreadable. “No,” she said finally, her voice cold and distant. “I’ve never thought about that. Because I don’t want to stop.”

A chill ran down my spine, and I realized that there was no reasoning with her—no way to convince her to change. Emily was a monster, pure and simple, and she had no intention of stopping. Not until she was caught, or until she found someone who was strong enough to stop her.

And I knew, deep down, that it wasn’t going to be me.

Session Four

By the time our fourth session arrived, I had made up my mind. I had to report her—I couldn’t keep this to myself any longer. But as I sat in my office, waiting for Emily to arrive, a nagging sense of dread gnawed at the back of my mind. I couldn’t shake the feeling that she knew what I was planning—that she had somehow anticipated my every move.

When Emily walked into the room, I could tell immediately that something was different. Her smile was still there, but it was sharper, more predatory. Her eyes glinted with a dangerous light, and I felt my pulse quicken with fear.

“Hello, Rose,” she said, her voice dripping with false sweetness. “How have you been?”

I forced a smile, my hands trembling slightly as I gestured for her to sit. “I’ve been well, Emily. And you?”

“Oh, I’ve been wonderful,” she replied, taking her seat and crossing her legs. “I’ve been thinking a lot about our sessions. About what you’ve been trying to do.”

My heart skipped a beat, and I felt a wave of panic wash over me. “What do you mean?” I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.

Emily’s smile widened, and there was no mistaking the malice in her eyes. “I know what you’re thinking,” she said softly. “I know you’ve been debating whether or not to report me. But I wouldn’t do that if I were you.”

A cold sweat broke out on my forehead, and I struggled to keep my breathing under control. “Why not?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

Emily leaned forward, her eyes locking onto mine with an intensity that sent a shiver down my spine. “Because I’ve been watching you, Rose,” she said, her voice low and menacing. “I know where you live. I know where you work. I know everything about you.”

My blood ran cold, and I felt a wave of nausea wash over me. “What do you want?” I asked, my voice trembling.

Emily’s smile was razor-sharp. “I want you to keep playing the game,” she said simply. “I want you to keep seeing me, keep listening to my stories. And I want you to remember, Rose… I’m always one step ahead.”

A sense of dread settled over me like a suffocating blanket, and I realized just how trapped I was. Emily had me in her grip, and there was no way out. I was just another pawn in her twisted game, another victim waiting for the inevitable.

And as I sat there, staring into the eyes of the monster across from me, I knew that I was in way over my head.

Conclusion

That night, I couldn’t sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw Emily’s face, her eyes glinting with malice, her smile dripping with venom. I knew I had to do something—I couldn’t let her continue her killing spree. But the fear of what she might do to me, to my loved ones, kept me paralyzed.

The next morning, I made a decision. I would report her—anonymously, if necessary. I couldn’t live with the knowledge that I had done nothing while a monster walked free.

But as I sat at my desk, preparing to make the call, a knock at my office door made my heart skip a beat. My blood turned to ice as I realized it could only be one person.

“Come in,” I called out, my voice trembling.

The door creaked open, and Emily stepped inside, her smile as cold and predatory as ever. She closed the door behind her, her eyes locked onto mine with a deadly intensity.

“Hello, Rose,” she said softly, her voice dripping with false sweetness. “I just wanted to stop by and see how you were doing.”

My hands trembled as I forced a smile, my heart pounding in my chest. “I’m fine, Emily. Thank you for asking.”


Emily’s smile widened, and she took a step closer, her presence suffocating in the small office. The air seemed to thicken, and I could feel the walls closing in around me.

“I’ve been thinking a lot about you, Rose,” she continued, her voice smooth and silky. “About how much I enjoy our little talks.”

I swallowed hard, trying to keep my fear from showing. “I… I’ve enjoyed them too, Emily,” I lied, hoping to placate her.

Her eyes glittered with amusement. “I’m glad to hear that,” she said, her tone laced with mock sincerity. “Because I was starting to worry that you might not want to play the game anymore.”

My heart pounded in my chest, and I could feel the panic rising. “Of course I do,” I replied quickly, forcing a smile. “Our sessions have been… enlightening.”

Emily’s smile was sharp as a blade. “Good,” she said softly. “Because I wouldn’t want anything to happen to you, Rose. You’re too important to me.”

A cold shiver ran down my spine, and I knew, in that moment, that I was in grave danger. Emily was threatening me—there was no doubt about it. But there was something more in her eyes, something darker and more sinister than I had ever seen before.

“I have to go now,” she said, her voice as sweet as honey. “But I’ll see you soon, Rose. Very soon.”

Before I could respond, Emily turned and walked out of the office, closing the door behind her with a soft click. I sat there, frozen in place, the terror gripping me like a vice.

I knew I had to act fast. Emily’s threat was clear—if I didn’t continue to play her twisted game, she would come after me. I couldn’t let that happen. I couldn’t let her have that power over me.

With trembling hands, I picked up the phone and dialed the police. My heart raced as I explained the situation, recounting everything Emily had told me, everything she had confessed.

The officer on the other end of the line listened carefully, his voice calm and reassuring. “We’re going to send someone over right away, Dr. Collins,” he said. “Don’t worry, we’ll take care of this.”

But I wasn’t reassured. Even as I hung up the phone, I couldn’t shake the feeling that Emily was always one step ahead—that no matter what I did, she would find a way to stay in control.

The next few days were a blur. The police interviewed me multiple times, and I provided them with all the information I had. They launched an investigation, but there was little they could do without concrete evidence. Emily had been meticulous in covering her tracks, and the lack of physical evidence made it difficult to build a case against her.

But I knew the truth. I knew what she was capable of, and I knew that as long as she was out there, no one was safe.

I started receiving anonymous letters—threatening, taunting. I knew they were from Emily, but there was nothing I could do. The police couldn’t trace them, and Emily’s visits to my office had stopped. She had gone underground, disappearing without a trace, but the letters continued.

And then, one night, I heard a noise outside my window—a soft, almost imperceptible sound that sent a jolt of fear through me. I tried to convince myself it was just my imagination, just the wind, but deep down, I knew.

She was watching me. Waiting.

I moved out of my apartment, changed my phone number, tried to disappear. But the letters still found me, no matter where I went. I lived in constant fear, always looking over my shoulder, always waiting for the moment when she would strike.

But Emily never came. The letters eventually stopped, and for a time, I allowed myself to believe that it was over—that she had moved on, found a new game to play.

But I was wrong.

One night, several months later, I received a call—a woman’s voice, soft and familiar.

“Hello, Rose,” she said, her tone dripping with malice.

My blood ran cold, and I felt the world tilt beneath me. “Emily,” I whispered, my voice trembling.

“It’s been a while,” she said, her voice as sweet as ever. “I’ve missed our talks.”

“What do you want?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

Emily laughed—a sound that sent a shiver down my spine. “I just wanted to let you know, Rose… I’m always one step ahead. Always.”

The line went dead, and I sat there, frozen in place, the terror gripping me once again.

I knew then that it would never be over. Emily would never stop. She would always be out there, watching, waiting. And there was nothing I could do to escape her.

I was her pawn, her plaything. And no matter how far I ran, no matter where I hid, she would always find me.

Because that was the game. And Emily always won.

It’s been years since that last phone call, but the fear still lingers. I moved to a different city, changed my name, started a new life. But no matter how hard I try to forget, the memories always come back—the memories of Emily, of the monster who took pleasure in destroying lives.

Sometimes, late at night, I hear her voice in my head—soft, sweet, and laced with malice. I see her smile, feel her eyes on me, and I know that she’s still out there, somewhere.

Waiting.

And I know that one day, she’ll find me again. Because that’s what she does. That’s who she is.

Emily is a monster. And she’ll never stop playing the game.
