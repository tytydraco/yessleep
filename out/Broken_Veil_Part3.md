Warning: >!Blood!<

I pulled up to the curb outside the station just as Paul stepped through the doors, jacket slung over his arm. He paused when he saw me, then grinned. 

“My favorite chauffeur.” He joked as he climbed in. 

“Where to?” I replied 

He shut the door and pulled his phone out, turning it toward me as I eased back into traffic. “Alright. Gab's team got this address from the trace.” The map loaded slowly, then settled. 

“West side,” He said. “Commercial zoning mostly. Offices, storage, a couple light industrial spots. Some residential pockets mixed in.” 

I glanced at the screen, committing the route to memory. “Could be anything, then.” 

“Exactly,” Paul said. “Businesses. Rentals. 
Someone’s old office space.” 

Or a house that doesn’t get visitors, I thought, but didn’t say. 

We headed out of downtown, the buildings thinning and spreading apart as we moved west. Traffic eased. The city felt looser here, less watched. 

I caught him up on Ethan's map as I steered us through the turns. 

“Same dead ends,” I said. “Same places where things stop making sense.” 

“That’s enough to get someone’s attention,” he said. “Whoever is behind this.” 

I nodded in agreement. 

“Whoever they are, they were watching him for a while. That takes planning. Doesn’t feel random.” 

“No,” I said. “It doesn’t.” 

As we crossed deeper into the west side, the buildings grew taller, more utilitarian. Parking garages and old businesses stacked concrete on concrete. 

Paul grabbed the radio. “Dispatch, this is Reddick. I’m requesting any available unit nearby this address to keep a tight patrol and standby for assistance. Possible suspect contact." 

The acknowledgment came quickly. 

"Just in case." He added. 

"Good call." I said. 

We turned down a narrower street, flanked by aging office buildings and fenced lots. 

The address led us farther than I expected, into a stretch that felt barely used and forgotten. I slowed the car as we approached the destination. 

“Well,” he said, brow furrowing, “That’s not a house.” 

The building sat back off to the side. Faded lettering was painted high on the brick. A radio call sign and a channel number, sun-bleached but still legible. Temporary fencing surrounded the property, sections bowed and patched like no one had bothered to finish the job. Windows were dark. Some boarded. Some intact. 

“This place still active?” Paul asked. 

“Doesn’t look like it.” I said. 

“Then why would anything trace here?” 

We parked a short distance away, both of us sitting still for a moment.This wasn’t what either of us had pictured when we punched in the address. 

Paul exhaled slowly. “Alright. That changes things a bit.” 

I adjusted the brim of my hat as we stepped out, the sound of the car door closing echoed once. We stood there for a moment, studying the building, the fence, the other buildings. The lot had several, some two stories like the old radio station, and a parking garage off to the corner. At the far end of the lot looked what appeared to be a door that led down underground. Utility closet perhaps. 

I rubbed my fingers over the bristles of my beard. Whatever had brought us here wasn’t obvious. 

We checked our gear before we left the car, Paul clipping the radio to his belt and tossing his jacket onto the seat. I adjusted my belt too where my short-barreled revolver was holstered, then rolled up the cuffs of my button up shirt. 

We crossed through the gap in the construction fence, our shoes crunching on gravel and old leaves that had collected where no one bothered to sweep anymore. Orange plastic fluttered weakly against a bent post, tapping in the breeze like it was trying to get our attention and failing. 

Paul eyed the front door as we approached. “Place looks like it’s been waiting for a wellness check.” 

I huffed a quiet chuckle.
“Let’s hope it answers better than most.” 

The door wasn’t locked. 

That stopped us both for half a beat.
Paul looked at the handle, then at me. 
“That’s either convenient… or a problem.” 

“Only one way to find out,” I said. 

I pushed the door open. 

The air inside was stale but not rotten. Old dust. Dry carpet. The faint musky smell you get from an aging building that hasn't seen use in a long time. Our footsteps echoed briefly down a hallway that opened up into what had once been the main floor.
The first level looked exactly like what it was: a radio station that had shut its doors mid-life and never came back. Cubicles with sun-faded dividers. A reception desk with a cracked laminate top. Someone had left a coffee mug on a filing cabinet beside a desk. A baseball cap hung on the corner of a chair like its owner had stepped away for a smoke and never returned. 

“Knock knock.” Paul muttered. “Looks like nobody's home.” 

“Yeah,” I said, “Abandoned in time.” 

We moved room to room. Old broadcast offices. A small break area with a dead fridge. Nothing disturbed. Nothing spoke to being currently occupied. If someone had packed up, they’d done it a long time ago. 

Then we found the elevator. 

Paul pressed the call button instinctively. 

Nothing happened. The indicator above the door was dark. 

“Figures,” he said. “Stairs it is.” 

The stairwell smelled different. Colder. Concrete and dust. Our steps echoed tighter here, the sound snapping back quicker, more contained. The further up we went, the less the building felt like a workplace and more like a shell.
The second floor doors opened onto something that didn’t match the first. 

Most of the space was empty. 

Not stripped violently. Just… cleared. No desks. No chairs. No personal clutter. The walls were bare except for faint rectangles where furnishings had once rested. Even the floor seemed unremarkable, just the same carpet as the bottom floor. 

Paul slowed. “Do you hear that.” 

“Yeah,” I said. 

We followed the hum. 

It was faint, easy to miss at first. A low electrical presence, steady and patient. It led us toward the far end of the floor, where the main broadcast room had been. 

The original radio hardware was still there, mixing boards, racks of analog gear, dials yellowed with age. It had been cleaned, dusted, maintained. Cables ran where they should. Indicator lights blinked softly. Someone had brought it back online. 

And then there was the new stuff.
Industrial computer towers. Rack-mounted units stacked cleanly along the wall. Thick cables fed into them, bundled and labeled, disappearing into conduits that hadn’t existed in the station’s original design. Small lights glowed faintly. No branding. Just matte metal cases with cooling fans whispering steadily. 

This wasn’t hobbyist gear. 

“That doesn’t belong here.” I said quietly. 

“No,” Paul agreed. “And it’s not cheap.” 

I stepped closer, careful not to touch anything yet. The contrast was wrong. Old broadcast equipment kept alive, cables re-run to support something newer. 

Paul scanned the room, hand resting near his sidearm. “You still thinking kidnapping?” 

I hesitated. 

“I think...” I said slowly, “Someone’s been involved a lot longer than we have.” 

The hum continued, steady and unconcerned. 

Whatever this place was doing, it wasn’t abandoned. 

A laptop sat at the edge of the table near the humming tower like it had been forgotten.
Not tucked away. Not secured. Just there. Closed, thin layer of dust clinging to the lid. Not enough to suggest years. Weeks, maybe. A month at most. 

“That’s odd,” Paul said. “You don’t just leave something like that.” 

“No,” I said. “You leave it if you expect to come back.” 

I lifted the lid. 

The screen came alive instantly. No boot sequence. No login screen. Whatever had been running hadn’t stopped when the laptop was closed. It had just... waited. A dark interface blinked once and settled into place, lines of text and overlayed graphics filling the display. 

Paul let out a quiet whistle. “Still powered after sitting around this long.” 

The power cable hung off the side of the thin device and ran off into the mass of cables at the floor, plugged in somewhere. 

The first window was simple. Clean. No names. No identifiers. Just timestamps and coordinate data noted down in neat columns. Longitude. Latitude. Altitude. Movement vectors. 

“This looks like GPS tracking.” Paul said, leaning closer. 

“Yeah,” I replied. “But anonymous. No personal data.” 

No phone numbers. No carrier data. Just dots on a map. 

I scrolled. 

One highlighted coordinate made my hand pause. 

Then another. 

Then another. 

“Paul." I said quietly. 

He followed my finger. 

The old quarry. 

The mountain pass. 

Beneath them dozens of time stamps with coordinates. The entries were brief. Minutes. Seconds. Others lingered for hours. The system didn’t care who they were. Only where they’d been. How long they stayed. How close they got. 

“This isn’t about people,” I said slowly. “It’s proximity. How close they were to.. something.” 

I clicked into another directory. The interface changed. The screen dimmed, replaced by a grid. Faint, translucent lines dividing the area into large square quadrants. The background was dark, grayed out, with pulses of light blooming at different quadrants. 

Small readouts updated in real time. 

Resonance variance.
Harmonic deviation.
Signal coherence: unstable. 

Paul frowned. “What the hell does that mean?” 

“I don’t know,” I said honestly. “But it’s not all GPS data.” 

There were waveforms. Frequencies. Whatever this was “listening” to we didn't have a clue. 

One quadrant pulsed brighter than the rest. 

The forest. 

The same region we’d been circling for years. 

Then Paul stiffened. 

“Derrick.” 

Another point lit up. 

Closer. 

Much closer. 

I leaned in, reading the coordinate overlay.
It was nearly on top of us. But its elevation was underground? 

My eyes dropped to the timestamp. 

Ten minutes ago. 

I felt my stomach tighten. 

“That’s when we entered the building." Paul said. 

Neither of us spoke for a moment. 

The equipment hummed around us, steady and patient. The building didn’t creak. The air didn’t shift. Nothing obvious had changed. 

And yet... 

Paul straightened, hand moving unconsciously toward his weapon. 

We listened. 

The hum was still there. 

But the room felt… Ominous. 

The laptop chimed softly. 

Another update. 

The underground quadrant pulsed brighter.
Somewhere beneath our feet, something had just moved. 

Paul turned away from the laptop and scanned the room, eyes tracking the walls, the ceiling, the corners where old cables vanished into conduit. 

“Do radio stations usually have sub levels?” he asked. “Basement storage?” 

“Maintenance tunnels,” I added. “For the utilities. Especially with older infrastructures.” 

I closed the laptop but didn’t unplug it. Something about leaving it running felt… Necessary. 

We made our way back down the stairs and found the sub level access tucked into a corner. The door opened with a dry scrape of metal against concrete. 

Cold air spilled out. 

Not a draft exactly. More like the building exhaled. A narrow hallway lead to another doorframe with no door. Beyond the threshold, a stairwell descended into shadows. Concrete steps, narrow and steep, with a handrail bolted directly into the wall. Old light fixtures ran along the ceiling. We flipped the switch, the third one was dark. One of the working ones flickered. 

Paul clicked on his flashlight. The beam cut cleanly down the stairwell, stopping short of the bottom. 

“Tunnel access,” he said. “Or maybe a dungeon.” 

I smirked despite the eeriness. He smirked back, brief and tight. 

“Call it in?” he asked. 

I hesitated. 

If this was a kidnapping, we were about to step onto someone else’s turf. If it wasn’t… I wasn’t sure what we were walking into. 

“Yeah, just in case.” I said. 

Paul nodded and keyed his radio. “Unit 3, this is Reddick. We’re checking a sublevel at our location. Stand by for support.” 

Static answered back. 

Not interference. Just… flat. 

Paul repeated himself, with the same result. He frowned at the radio, gave it a tap and a shake. 

“Probably the building.” 

“Probably,” I echoed. "We need to go down though. We don't want them to get away from us." 

I clicked on my light and we started down. 

The air grew cooler with each step, heavier somehow. The smell changed too, less dust, more damp concrete and old wiring. 

We reached the bottom. The stairwell opened into a wide concrete corridor. A heavy steel door stood open. 

The corridors beneath the building were old, utilitarian arteries of the city. Concrete walls stained by decades of moisture. Pipes ran along the ceiling in parallel lines, some wrapped in insulation, others bare and sweating. Thick cables were bolted into brackets, disappearing into the walls toward neighboring structures. 

It wasn’t quiet down here. 

Water moved through pipes beyond the walls. Somewhere ahead, something dripped, slow and rhythmic drops. Our footsteps echoed just enough to give the space shape. Old warning signs clung crookedly to the concrete: AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY, HIGH VOLTAGE, NO ADMITTANCE. 

Paul walked a step ahead of me, flashlight cutting through the dim, catching junction boxes and faded stenciled numbers on the walls. 

“This place must tie into the whole block,” he said. “Utility backbone for all the structures.” 

“That’d explain the maze.” I replied. 

We rounded a corner and stepped into the main service tunnel. It was wider than the others, and the ceiling raised up several feet. Side corridors branched off at regular intervals, dark gaps leading to unknown places. Small light fixtures buzzed faintly in a line on the wall. Enough to see, but left blankets of shadow where the light faded. 

"Stay close." I said in a low voice. 

"Roger that." Paul responded as he shuffled closer to me. 

Then we crossed the threshold. 

The sound stopped. 

Not faded. Not dampened. Just gone.
The hum of the pipes vanished mid-breath. The drip ahead of us cut off like a switch had been thrown. Even our footsteps changed. They were muted, wrong, like they were being absorbed before they could exist. 

I stopped without meaning to. 

Paul did too. 

The sudden change was a shock but I couldn't put my finger on why my senses recognized it. 

All I could hear was my own breathing. Too loud. Too close. Paul’s came through beside me, muffled. 

“This isn’t...” he started, then stopped. 

Our voices didn’t carry. They didn’t bounce. They just… Existed, briefly, and died. 

The hair raised on my arm and my heart started racing. I finally realized what this was. 

"Back to back, now!" I barked 

Paul landed squarely against my back and we drew our firearms. 

"What is this?" He asked, a ring of fear in his voice. "What's wrong with the sound?" 

"This is what happened right before..." My thoughts caught up with my mouth. "All of them." 

The beams of our flashlights swept the tunnel, stretching as far as they could before being swallowed by darkness on both ends. No movement. No sound. 

Every instinct I had screamed that we were being watched. 

Something moved. A shuffling noise. 

It came faster. 

Paul shouted. His voice sharp and panicked. 

The thing leapt out of a side tunnel in a blur of motion, four limbs and fast. It went for Paul’s chest and missed by inches, its momentum carrying it past him. A claw caught his side instead. 

Paul went down hard on his knee, gasping. 

I fired two shots after it. 

The gunshot sounded wrong too, flat and muted, like it had been wrapped in cloth. The flashes lit the tunnel in harsh white for two brief seconds. The thing recoiled, not injured, just surprised, then vanished back into another side corridor with a skittering retreat that made no sound at all. 

“Paul!” I grabbed him, hauling him upright. 

“I’m hit,” He said through clenched teeth. “Not bad... I think.” 

I didn’t wait to find out. 

“We’re moving,” I said. “Now.” 

We headed for the main service entrance behind us, weapons up, lights sweeping. Every side tunnel felt like an open threat. 

The thing kept pace with us. 

Not behind, but flanking the sides.
A shadow would flicker in the corner of my eye. Then nothing. 

It was stalking us. 

And Paul was bleeding. 

We stayed in motion. 

That was the only thing keeping the panic at bay. 

Ahead of us I could faintly make out the exit under a dim light. The tunnel seemed to stretch on forever, the silence pressed in harder the longer we walked. Every sound we made was wrong. our breathing muted, our steps dull and swallowed before they could travel. 

There was only one sound that didn’t belong to us. 

It came and went, just at the edge of the shadows. A scrape. Something brushing concrete. 

Paul was still upright, still pushing forward, but his steps had shortened. He favored his left side now, one hand pressed tight against his ribs. I stayed close, matching his pace, light sweeping the tunnel entries as we passed them. 

“It’s herding us.” he muttered. 

I didn’t argue. 

The sound came closer. 

This time we saw it. 

The darkness beside us peeled open, and the thing launched itself from the corridor, all limbs and momentum. Paul reacted on instinct, spinning and firing three quick shots. The muzzle flashes lit the tunnel in violent bursts. White, then black, then white again. 

All three missed 

The creature twisted mid-jump. 

I dodged aside almost tripping myself, felt air move as it sailed past, close enough that I caught a glimpse of its shape: Angled head full of teeth, a mix of flesh and fur with large claws. I fired as I turned, arm snapping up in sync. 

The shot landed. 

This time the sound was different. 

It let out a sharp, broken noise that made my ears ache, something like a shriek with feedback. It hit the far wall, rebounded and vanished into the shadows again. 

Paul laughed once, breathless and disbelieving. “You hit it.” 

The sound didn’t follow us right away this time. 

But Paul slowed. 

Noticeably now. 

We were close enough to the exit that the light was stronger, spilling into the tunnel in a dull yellow wash. I could finally see his hand when he pulled it away from his side.
It was soaked. 

“Paul..." I said.
He took two more steps, then stopped. Leaned heavily against the wall. 

“Yeah,” he said quietly. “That’s… worse than I thought.” 

Blood pooled on his shirt and down his belt, dark and spreading. I knelt, pressed my hands against the wound without really thinking. It stained my fingers immediately. 

“Stay with me,” I said. “We’re almost out.” 

He shook his head. 

“I really hit the wall this time, didn't I?” He said with a pained laugh. 

I looked toward the exit, then back at him. 

“Don’t talk like that.” I said. 

“The radio won’t work down here,” he replied. Calm. Too calm. “You know that. You need to get topside. Call it in.” 

“I’m not leaving you.” 

He grabbed my wrist, slick with his blood. His grip was still strong. 

“Derrick,” he said. “If you stay, we both die.” 

The scraping sound came again. Distant, but near enough. 

Paul met my eyes. “Go.” 

"No!" I nearly shouted in his face. "I'm not losing you too." 

I braced up under his good side, he groaned and gritted his teeth as I hoisted him up and practically carried him forward and up the stairs, his feet stumbling and grunting in pain alongside me. 

The moment we crossed the threshold, the noise of the city rushed back in. Traffic, wind, a distant car horn. It felt obscene after the silence. I set Paul down quickly but gently and stepped forward, scanning the area left and right. Clear. 

The radio crackled in my hand. 

“Officer down, I repeat, officer down. Westside commercial block, Service entrance. Need medic and backup ASAP!” 

My hands were still wet. 

For just a second, the sounds around me faltered. Like someone accidently paused a video, then pushed play again. I turned back and my heart dropped through my stomach instantly. 

Paul was gone. The door hung open. 

"No..." I barely breathed and ran back inside. 

The tunnel was loud again. Pipes hummed. Water dripped. Sound returned like nothing had ever happened.

But Paul was nowhere. 

Only streaks of blood remained, smeared across the concrete, dragged away toward the far end of the main tunnel. Long, uneven marks that disappeared into the dark. 

I shouldn’t have gone back in. 

I knew that even as I raised the flashlight and revolver, even as my legs carried me forward before my mind could catch up. Training said wait. Survival said run. But I went in anyway. 

The beam cut through the tunnel in long, trembling strokes. Pipes. Walls. The same branching corridors. Everything had returned. Water dripping. A distant fan rattling. The low hum of power somewhere deeper in the structure. 

Normal. 

Wrongly normal. 

I followed the blood. 

It led me halfway down the service tunnel before it simply… stopped. No pooling. No smear fading out. No turn into a side corridor. 

Just an abrupt end, like someone had lifted him straight up and carried him through the concrete itself. 

I stood there for a long time, staring at the last dark mark on the floor, waiting for something, anything, to explain it. 

Nothing. 

The tunnel stayed quiet. Empty. Whatever had been down there was gone. 

I backed away slowly, every step heavier than the last, until I turned and made my way out. When I emerged into the open air, the afternoon light felt unreal, washed pale by cloud cover and exhaustion. 

My legs gave out. 

I slumped against the concrete wall beside the access door, revolver still in my hand, flashlight dangling uselessly at my side, still on. The adrenaline drained all at once, leaving my nerves trembling. 

Sirens wailed in the distance. 

They were coming fast. But all too late. 

I made my statements. They listened, blankly and unbelieving. Someone brought me my hat... I didn't even realize It had fallen off. 

Following that evening I was put on leave. They said take time to rest and recuperate. Leave didn’t feel like rest. 

It felt like being removed from the board mid-game and told to wait while the pieces kept moving. 

I made coffee out of habit. One cup. Always one. It went cold every time. I’d sit at the table, stare into it like something might pop out, then forget it was there entirely. 

The apartment was too quiet, even with the TV on. By the third day, I stopped pretending to rest and stayed up late with the lights on. All of them, every room. 

I was called back into the office. The station smelled the same as it always had. Old brick, stale coffee, disinfectant that never quite masked either. Fluorescent lights hummed overhead, bright and unforgiving. It should have felt welcoming, but instead the atmosphere seemed to reject my presence. 

I sat at a table that wasn’t meant for the innocent. No files. No fluff. Just a recorder, a legal pad, and two people who already knew the version of the story that made sense to them. 

Internal Affairs didn’t raise their voices. 

They didn’t have to. 

They asked about the radio station. Why we’d entered without a warrant. Why there was no request logged, no backup on site when things went bad. They asked about Paul. How close we were, how long we’d worked together. They asked about Ethan. 

Personal connections. 

Judgment calls. 

A pattern. 

I answered everything straight. Calm. Professional. Stuck to the facts. I tried to convince them of the leads, the clues, the... Thing...  But every answer seemed to circle the same drain. No physical evidence, no witnesses, an officer lost with no body, no suspect. 

Just a story. 

When they were done, one of them folded his hands and spoke carefully, like the words had edges. 

"Pending review, you’re suspended. Badge and firearm turned in. We’ll be recommending further action once the board evaluates..." 

Fired. 

They didn’t say it, but the intent was there. 

I nodded. What else could I do? 

My phone buzzed while I stood outside the station, staring at the steps I've walked up and down for years. 

It was Gabs. 

"I heard what happened.
I’m really sorry, Derrick. This isn’t right.
You didn’t imagine this. You’re the best detective we’ve got, and everyone in the department knows it.
I think it’ll work out. I really do.
If you need anything… I’m here." 

I read it twice. Her words should have felt comforting, but I felt nothing. 

I tried to type something. Then deleted it. 

The pub was a few blocks from home. Close enough to walk. Far enough to feel like leaving something behind. Same place I’d gone after long shifts, back when a bad day meant paperwork and not an empty tunnel where a man had been standing moments before. 

I took my usual seat at the bar. 

“Scotch, on the rocks. Make it a double." I said. 

The bartender nodded. Rocks. No questions. He slid it over and moved on like he knew this was another one of those nights. 

I didn’t drink right away. Just rested my hands on the glass, feeling the cold seep into my palms. The place was alive in a way my apartment wasn’t. Low voices. Laughter from the corners. Glasses clinking. A game murmuring from a TV I wasn’t watching. 

Sound behaving the way it should. 

I was halfway through the glass when someone sat down beside me. 

Didn’t announce himself. Didn’t crowd me. Just close enough to share the bar’s narrow strip of space. 

“Whiskey, please,” he said. “Neat.” 

The bartender didn’t hesitate and slid his glass over. 

I turned my head just slightly. 

He looked ordinary. Not forgettable, just unremarkable in a way that felt deliberate. Calm posture. Hands steady. The kind of presence that didn’t attract attention. 

“So, here to numb the pain or... Drown out the silence?” he asked. 

He rolled the liquid around in his glass then took a noisy sip. 

My absent mind froze on that last word. 

“You followed the right trail,” he said. “Most people don’t.” 

I shifted uncomfortably on the stool. "Who are you..?" 

He ignored me. “What happened out there was real,” he said. “Your instincts weren’t off. The problem is the answers don’t fit cleanly into a who.” 

Or a what. 

He didn’t say it, but the thought was there. 

“I just wanted you to know you weren’t chasing ghosts." He went on. "You were just chasing something people don’t know is there.” 

He reached into his jacket and set a card on the bar between us. 

Blank except for an address. No fancy logo and title. No explanation. 

“If you want the parts you’re missing,” he said, standing, “Here is where to find them.” 

He paused, then added, quieter: “Or you can finish the drink and pretend the world still works the way it did last week. No one would blame you.” 

He left without waiting for an answer. 

The bar filled the space again. Laughter. Glass. Voices overlapping just enough to blur. 

The card stayed where it was. 

I stayed late into the night. The glass sweated onto the bar long after the ice had melted away. The scotch thinned out, watered down and lukewarm but I kept my hand around it anyway. The bar emptied in stages. Voices faded. Chairs went upside down on tables one by one. 

At some point the TV went dark. 

I became aware of how quiet it had gotten only when the bartender said he was locking up and it was time to head home. 

The card was still where he’d left it. I hadn’t moved it. When I finally picked it up, it felt heavier than it should have. 

I knocked back what was left of the drink. It barely burned. 

Outside, the night air was cool and sharp. I stood there for a moment, the bar’s door closing softly behind me, car horns distant somewhere across the city. 

For the first time since the tunnel, since the silence, I wasn’t running on instinct or reaction. 

I had a direction. 

Whoever was watching... they had answers. Real ones. Not guesses. Not theories pinned to corkboard. 

I looked at the card once more and slipped it into my coat pocket. 

I pulled out my phone. 12:34 am. Late but just maybe.. 

I dialed Gabriella. It rang and went to voicemail. 

"Hey Gabs," I said a little more cheerful than I felt. "Thanks for the message the other day. I really appreciated it." 

I paused 

"Listen... I'm not done with this. Not yet. I can't..  Not after Paul..." I paused, "Maybe sometime I'll have something more I can bring you. Maybe just a coffee with that apple pastry you like. But don't worry about me.. I'll be fine.. I'm still on the hunt."
