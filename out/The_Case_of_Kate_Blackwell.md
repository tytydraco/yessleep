[WHIRRING OF RECORDER] 

DET. RYAN SNOW: This is Detective Ryan Snow with the Charlotte Police Department. Interrogating Kate Blackwell for the murder of her four friends in the Appalachian Mountains. Suspect had somewhat of a mental breakdown during first attempt at interrogation and was placed under watch starting yesterday.

Ms. Blackwell, you told me the other day that you're at fault for the death of your friends. Care to elaborate for me? 

KATE: I... I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I'm so sorry about your hand... 

DET. RYAN SNOW: It's fine, Ms. Blackwell. You were clearly having an episode. Is that normal behavior for you? Have you had episodes where you've... Bitten people? Or violently attacked them?

KATE: No, sir... I just... It followed... It followed me... 

DET. RYAN SNOW: What followed you? 

KATE: You... Wouldn't believe me... 

DET. RYAN SNOW: Try me. 

KATE [SNIFFING]: The thing... The thing that killed Sonja... Killed Jasper... It killed all of them... It was... It was in the cabin the... The whole time we were there... It was watching... Us... 

DET. RYAN SNOW: Ms. Blackwell, the only things found in that cabin were the bodies of Luke and Jasper... There was no one or... Thing that could kill anyone in that cabin. 

KATE [SNIFFING]: It doesn't matter... It's still all my fault... I just... I just didn't want to be alone...

DET. RYAN SNOW: Alone? You mean when you all went off to college? 

[SILENCE] 

DET. RYAN SNOW: Please speak your responses to my questions for the recording. 

KATE: Yes. 

DET. RYAN SNOW: Ms. Blackwell, why did you talk your friends into going on this trip to the mountains?

KATE: I just... Wanted us to spend a week together before we... We went our seperate ways... We all chose different colleges to go to and... I just wanted to spend time with them before... Before it all ended... I didn't... I didn't know... That would be the last time I'd spend time with them... Ever again... 

DET. RYAN SNOW: This... Thing that you say killed them, when did you realize it was in the cabin? 

KATE: Three days after we got there... It was in the attic... It was waiting for us to use the Oujia Board... It was Luke's idea... 

DET. RYAN SNOW: I recall a Oujia Board was extracted from the crime scene. You're saying Luke wanted to play it? 

KATE: Yeah... Sonja and I didn't want to... But Luke talked her into it and... And then Paul and Jasper joined... I didn't play... I didn't want to... 

DET. RYAN SNOW: Why not? 

KATE: I don't believe they actually work... I'm a believer in most things, but nothing like those... But... They still freak me out... I used to like watching horror movies and... Oujia Boards... What they're used for... Always made me uncomfortable... 

DET. RYAN SNOW: What happened when they played it? 

KATE: The typical questions... They asked if there was anyone there... Who they were... How'd they died... 

DET. RYAN SNOW: Did they get answers?

KATE: Yes... But I thought Luke, Sonja, or Paul were messing with the planchette to scare the rest of us... I stayed away, but watched... I wasn't buying anything they were saying... But then... Jasper asked me to ask a question... To prove it was a bull... I... I asked it what I was thinking of at the moment... 

DET. RYAN SNOW: Did it answer?

KATE: It... It said... It spelled out... 

[FAINT CREAKING NOISE AND EITHER RYAN OR KATE SHUFFLING IN THEIR CHAIRS] 

KATE: It spelled out... Regan... I was thinking of Linda Blair from the Exorcist... 

[FAINT CREAKING SOUND]

DET. RYAN SNOW: Apologies, mind if I turn up the heat a bit? I think there might be a draft. 

KATE: Okay... 

[SOUND OF DET. RYAN SNOW GETTING UP FROM THIS CHAIR AND WALKING TO THERMOSTAT WHILE CREAKING NOISE CONTINUES AND KATE SHUFFLING IN HER CHAIR]

DET. RYAN SNOW: What happened next? 

[DET. RYAN SNOW RETURNS TO SEAT] 

KATE: I was freaked out, but... I shrugged it off as... Everyone messing with me... And that it was just a coincidence... I mean... There was a Oujia Board in that movie and... They knew I liked horror movies... So... It was just a lucky guess to me at the time... But... Things just got worse after that...

DET. RYAN SNOW: Worse how? 

KATE: After I begged them to finish playing... They said goodbye and put it away... We went to bed and... The next few days... Just got worse and worse...

DET. RYAN SNOW: Worse how, Ms. Blackwell? 

KATE: At first it was small things... Things we put down would be in a completely different place when we walked away from them... Lights would be turned on or off when we thought we already messed with them... Food went missing... The noises... The voices...

DET. RYAN SNOW: Voices? 

KATE: It was... It was saying things to me at... At night... It was telling me horrible things about my friends... It said... It said Luke was cheating on Sonja... That Paul only hung out with us because he wanted me to be his girlfriend... That Jasper hated Sonja ... [SNIFFING] That... That Sonja... Wanted nothing to do with me anymore... It said they were all going to abandon me... 

DET. RYAN SNOW: Did you tell them you were hearing these voices? 

KATE: Only after... After... We started fighting... 

DET. RYAN SNOW: Fighting? 

KATE: It... It was... Talking to everyone else at night... Sonja kept demanding Luke give her his phone... Jasper told Paul to stop bugging me when I wanted to be alone... I tried to block out the voices... But that made me stay away from everyone... They were getting upset at me for pushing them... Pushing them away... [SNIFFING] When... When it was my idea we go there... That I'm the one who booked the cabin... And was ignoring them...

[KATE BEGINS SOBBING] 

DET. RYAN SNOW [CLEARS THROAT]: Ms. Blackwell, I understand you're upset. But if you didn't kill them, then I need to know what happened. Did you kill them? 

KATE [SOBBING]: Would you believe if I said no? That it was that... That thing! That it drove us all insane and took us out one at a time! I didn't do it! I swear! I loved them! Don't you understand? I loved them! I tried to stop it! I tried! I tried so hard! [SOBBING]

DET. RYAN SNOW: Okay, okay! Ms. Blackwell, please, calm yourself! If it wasn't you and this thing that was in the cabin did it, why did it try getting you all angry with one another?

KATE [SNIFFING]: I don't... I don't know... To mess with us? It wasn't until Sonja finally got Luke's phone... That things started... It was our fifth night and... Sonja got a hold of Luke's phone while he was in the shower... She got Paul and Jasper to... Figure out how to unlock it... That's when she saw the texts... The photos... They got into a huge fight when he came down from his shower... Paul, Jasper, and I tried to calm them down... But they just kept shouting and he... Luke... Luke ended up slapping me... 

DET. RYAN SNOW: Luke slapped you? 

KATE: It... It was an accident... I... I mean he was going to hit Sonja, but... I pulled her away to get her away from him... And he hit me instead... That's when Sonja demanded I take her home... That she wanted to leave right then and there... I didn't want her to stay with Luke, knowing he was getting violent, so... We packed up our stuff... Paul and Jasper were trying keep Luke away from us while we packed... It was around midnight when we were ready to leave... When... When... 

[SILENCE] 

DET. RYAN SNOW: Ms. Blackwell?

KATE: I looked out the window just before we were about to step out... And... I saw... I saw the land lord... 

DET. RYAN SNOW:.... The... Land lord?

KATE: I saw her... The first day we arrived... She owned the three cabins where we were staying... She was in her house... Just watching us... I had waved but... She just closed the curtains... She was out there that night... That night Sonja wanted to leave... She just stood there... She just stood there... Like a statue... She wasn't moving...

[SILENCE] 

DET. RYAN SNOW: The land lord was? Mrs. Larson? 

KATE: Yeah... I reserved the place online, so I never spoke to her... I told everyone she was out there... She... She had a knife... We tried to call the police, but there was no service... Paul and Luke went out to see what she was doing... She... She stabbed Paul and when Luke got him inside... They said she slashed our tires... We patched Paul up as best we could... We took shifts to keep a look out for Mrs. Larson...

DET. RYAN SNOW: Did she ever leave? 

KATE: It was Luke's shift when she was gone... He told us she'd gone back to her house just before dawn... Our spare tires were slashed when we went to our cars... Our phones still had no service... We tried going up the nearby trails to see if we could get any bars... It was getting dark and we still couldn't get anything... We went back... It... It was waiting... The Ouija Board was on the coffee table... The planchette was on HELLO... Everything is... Is a blur after that... 

DET. RYAN SNOW: Is that when it starting killing everyone? 

KATE [SNIFFING]: Yeah...

DET. RYAN SNOW: Ms. Blackwell, I'm having trouble with all of this. 

KATE: I... I told you that you... Wouldn't belive me... 

DET. RYAN SNOW: Not just that, Ms. Blackwell. Not only do I think you made up this thing that killed your friends, but I think you also made up seeing Mrs. Larson. The reason I say that is because the original owner of those cabins, Mrs. Larson is dead. The place was taken over by a vacation rental company after no next of kin could be found. 

[SILENCE]

KATE: What...?

[DOOR TO ROOM SWINGS OPEN] 

DET. RYAN SNOW: Hey, this is a restricted room! 

MRS. MAYFIELD: Mayfield, attorney, I represent the Blackwell family. Ms. Blackwell will not be answering any more questions detective. She is under my jurisdiction now. 

DET. RYAN SNOW: God damn it, rich kids... You're free to go Ms. Blackwell. 

[CHAIR CLATTERS AS DET. RYAN SNOW GETS UP AND STARTS WALKING OUT ROOM] 

KATE: Detective! 

MRS. MAYFIELD: Ms. Blackwell, you don't-

KATE: The guest book!

DET. RYAN SNOW: What? 

KATE: If you don't believe me... Read the guest book... We all wrote in it... Even the thing from the attic... Read it... They took it from me when they found me...

Log book of Det. Ryan Snow
Case #2798: the Appalachian Murders
Description of enclosed evidence: One bloody, torn up, blue and green guest book retrieved from suspect. 

Kate Blackwell has been released on bond and placed on house arrest as investigation continues. I have retrieved the guest book from evidence per the request of the suspect as a means for her to prove her innocence of the death of her friends. Guest book was all that was found on suspect's person when she was found wandering side of road near mountains where the incident took place. 

Suspect was covered in blood both her own and matching that of the victims'. She was found dead of night wearing nothing but large white T-shirt and shorts by teenagers taking a night time joy ride. Suspect and victims were reported missing when suspect hadn't updated her parents on her well being for five days. Victims' families also reported group missing after several missed calls and unread texts.

I have obtained all persons' involved's phones and will evaluate the backlogs of their time spent in the mountains. Oujia board the suspect spoke of was burnt and planchette is missing.

I will interview all who have connections to Ms. Blackwell to understand why she may have killed her friends. First, I will review all the evidence, beginning with the log book. Most pages have been torn out. The earliest entry being from April twentieth, nineteen ninety-six.

Entry in guest book from April 20, 1996: This place is absolutely [REST OF BEGINNING ENTRY WAS SCRACHED OUT AND SOMETHING ELSE WAS WRITTEN] God help you if you stay, they're watching us! Stay away! Stay away! [PHRASE 'STAY AWAY' FILLS UP REST OF PAGE]

Entry is rather concerning and I will need to dig deeper into it during my investigation. For now, my sole priority at the moment is to read through the logs during Ms. Blackwell's stay.

I shall update within this log should I find anything of value to this case within the guest book. 

Whether Ms. Blackwell is at fault for the deaths of these young people or not, there is something deeper going on within those mountains when it comes to those cabins. And I am determined to understand what it is.
