Well, I appreciate everyone enjoying my last experience! It’s kinda weird having thousands of people read something scary that happened to me. But, like I mentioned, it’s not my only one.

I’ll probably stay a little broad moving forward, since I already said we’re based in Nashville, and the more details I give, the easier it’d be to narrow down which company I work for.

We offer a lot of services, one being storage. We’ve got around 20,000 sq. ft. of warehouse space for clients between houses, estate jobs, interior designers, or anyone who needs to store things for a while.

If you’re ever short on furniture, work for a moving company for a few months. Clients get rid of enough stuff that most of us have fully furnished apartments with nice furniture all for free.

However, in storage, if someone stops paying, we can’t just keep their stuff. Legally, we have to post public notices and auction the contents to recoup the loss. It’s a headache and rarely happens - but one was different.


A little over a year ago, we held one of those sales. It was big. Because we price everything cheap, every single item sold. Rugs, TVs, a dining set, random boxes of dishes - literally an entire home’s worth of furniture. Even a massive and ugly grandfather clock.

My manager said it’d been in storage longer than he’d been employed. The warehouse manager, the only guy still around from back then, remembered unloading it off a truck but had never seen it unwrapped until that day.

It stood about seven feet tall, shaped almost like a coffin, carved from dark wood gone nearly black with age. The clock face’s yellow finish was rubbed down to the raw wood beneath the numbers 2, 4, and 6. At the top perched a wooden bird with the body of an owl but with the head of a raven. Its wings outstretched, talons gripping the frame, and its head tilted unnaturally straight upward. The back panel was scratched with Roman numerals. Seemingly random, uneven, carved deep, like someone had pressed a knife into the wood by hand.

At the sale, a local antique collector bought it. We loaded it into his van, and he drove off.

Three weeks later, it was back.


We didn’t even see who returned it. One morning it was just sitting on the loading dock.

Security footage showed the collector pulling up just after 3 a.m. He swung open the van doors, shoved the clock out, and peeled off so fast one of the back doors flapped open.

We still had his contact info, so my manager called him that afternoon.

He answered, whispering like he didn’t want someone, or something, to hear.

“It shouldn’t be working,” he said. “I tried to fix it to sell, but the parts are so old I couldn’t. Then it started going off… and every time it went off, something unexplainable happened.”

He wouldn’t explain further. He hung up.

We checked the clock. No ticking, no pendulum swing, definitely not working. Just standing there. We wrapped it up and left it near the front of the warehouse until our manager could figure out what to do with it.


That night, the alarm system tripped at 2:46 a.m.

My manager met the police at the warehouse. No sign of entry. But when he checked the footage, the motion alert came from the aisle where the clock sat.

The video showed nothing moving - except the clock’s hands, slowly spinning forward before stopping dead at 2:46.

Weird, because we’d definitely wrapped it the day before.

The next morning, it was sitting there unwrapped, still stuck at 2:46. The pendulum had obviously swung, and all the hands were resting over the rubbed-out spots on the face.

Later that day, it chimed.


Over the next few weeks, things escalated.

The next time it chimed again, it was at 2:46am. Our cameras caught the warehouse lights flickered on and off in sequence - like they were following something invisible as it walked under each fixture. As one light came on, the one behind it turned off, tracing a path down the aisle.

It stopped at the clock.

The final light, the one directly above it, was the only light shining and still on when we arrived the next morning.



A few nights later, the office phone rang at 2:46 a.m.
Obviously, no one was there.

The voicemail caught nothing but static.
Our receptionist swore she heard a voice beneath it whisper, “Don’t… move it… again.”

The call traced back to the warehouse manager’s extension. That warehouse phone hasn’t ever worked as far as I’m concerned.



One weekend, a long-haul crew got back late from an out-of-state delivery. They parked around two in the morning to unload before heading home.

D, one of our movers, was folding pads near the clock when it chimed. Right on schedule - 2:46.

Startled, he looked at the clock where the sounds came from. He said the carved bird on top wasn’t wood anymore - it was real and alive. Its head turned toward him, eyes glinting like wet glass. Feathers rippled. Then it cawed.

D bolted. Didn’t even clock out. We followed his lead.



The final straw came that Monday.

The security feed caught motion again - 2:46. The clock’s glass door swung open, then slammed shut so hard the whole thing toppled over, falling behind a stack of pads.

An hour and forty minutes later, new motion triggered - in the office.

When the cameras switched on, the clock was standing upright beside my manager’s desk.




That’s when he finally snapped.

He told us to get rid of it - legality be damned. “Throw it out back!”

It was heavier than before, easily three hundred pounds, and whatever was inside shifted like something solid. Like a heavy rug shifting inside a large box.

We loaded it onto the liftgate and dumped it into the dumpster behind the warehouse.

When it hit, the body cracked and a plume of fine black dust poured out - like smoke. It bellowed out fast like it was trying to escape.




If it weren’t for the footage, I’d swear it was all a prank.
But we saw it.

After the dump truck hauled the clock away, we noticed a broken piece of the back panel lying on the ground.

It had Roman numerals carved into it. But this time, they were obviously freshly done.

That grandfather clock had something going on with it.
Luckily, nothing else happened with the clock.

But this isn’t the only time our warehouse cameras have caught something they shouldn’t have seen.
