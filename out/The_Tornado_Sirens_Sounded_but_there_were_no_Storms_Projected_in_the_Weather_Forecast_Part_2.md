Day 14 Time: 19:22

Before I begin my retelling of today's events I wanted to give an update on how things have been going for the past 14 days. When I posted my original story I had a few messages from commenters. This was unexpected, because I thought for sure the internet was done for. Anyway I wanted to address some of the comments to start. One commenter asked about my Dad. When I woke up 12 days ago I was very much out of it. I was mainly worried about my ailments, which have been getting better as the days go by. This makes me think perhaps the bomb was not nuclear in origin, since I would be long dead by now with the massive amounts of radiation. Anyway, I did not look for my Dad, I knew he would be dead, and I could not bring myself to face that brutal reality. Maybe it was selfish, maybe it was stupid. At the very least it gives me some form of hopeful ignorance. Another commenter asked if we were all in the same world. This confused me, is that even possible? If so, how did I move from one to the other or more likely how am I communicating with another? Either way it's not really important to me. What is important is finding my family. 14 days without my wife and child is killing me. It's getting dark, the sirens are lowering their wails, and the Howls are getting loud again. Onto today's events:

I woke up today to the sound of banging on the large metal door that would bring truckloads of fireworks into the building for the various number of customers excited to shoot them off for the holidays. I sat up from my makeshift bed, made of cardboard and duct tape and covered by a blanket I found in one of the offices at the back of the building. The bandages I had applied the night before sloughed off and my patchy singed skin clung to them and fell onto the bed. I winced in pain as I peeled off what still adhered to my somewhat clean, smooth skin. I got to my feet, the banging still hadn’t stopped.

“HELP! I NEED TO GET IN! THOSE THINGS… THEY’RE COMING FOR ME!” screamed the person outside.

My heart skipped a beat and I shuffled to the side door as fast as I could. I opened it slowly and as I went to peek my head around the corner to where I presumed the banging to be coming from, it stopped. My eye’s had barely adjusted to the light when they landed on where I thought the banging was coming from. There was nothing there. I just saw the metal building glinting with the orange, smoke-covered sunlight. I stepped outside my feet landing on the gravel walkway that stretched all the way around the building. I peered over to the large, loading door, all I saw were two large dents. I walked all the way around the building about two more times, I never saw any signs of life that wasn't human. All I noticed was the ever increasing volume of the tornado sirens. My stroll around the building was the first time I had actually taken in the horrifying sights that beset me. The bombs had certainly done a number on the area. The grass was singed to the dirt and would crunch as you walked over them, it felt like walking over autumn-fall leaves. The trees no longer swayed in the wind, the leaves haven’t come back, they simply laid on the ground, lifeless. The trees were scorched black and cracked from tip to trunk. They were all bent towards the city, the direction the shockwave took, they were nature's road signs.

I used to love adventuring in the woods on our farm. My brother and I had forts we’d play capture the flag with. I would sneak through the trees and win every time. The trees were natural cover, but now… nothing can hide.

I noticed the buildings, nothing stood but those with concrete foundations and steel support beams. The houses were completely destroyed, simply piles of broken furniture, appliances, and sheetrock. Before the bombs fell you’d never know if someone had a basement but now, that's all that stood between the piles of dilapidated architecture and the concrete foundations. Some fireplaces and their accompanying shafts stood tall, some crumbling still and some half the height they used to be. White picket fences turned black and mailboxes lay in the streets, with owners' names still imprinted onto the side.

I finally finished my patrol of the warehouse, and went back inside. I walked down the hall that held the building's offices. I turned into the bathroom and unlatched the first aid kit on the wall. I cleaned my hands and wounds with the isopropyl alcohol, reapplied bandages to my body, and took some pain meds. I couldn't get my mind off of the morning’s activities. What was making that noise, what made those dents in the door, and who was screaming at me? What wanted inside so badly? My mind raced with possibilities, but I kept coming back to the same idea. The people, at least they looked like people.

I don’t know what happened when the nukes dropped but it changed the people that inhabited the area before. I ran into one of them, the day I woke up under the car. I had just gotten out from under the car and myself to my feet. They were just standing in the middle of the gas station parking lot, looking at the ground. She had long black hair and a clean, flowing dress with flowers on it. She turned around and spotted me. When I saw her face I was so creeped out. I couldn’t understand why though, she was activating a part of my brain that alerted me to danger. She was very pretty but she was wrong. Her eyes were larger than life, like a cartoon character. They were too far apart and her ears were so little. She still looked like a person but my uncanny valley sensors were going off the charts. Her arms were longer than they should’ve been, as were her legs. What really confused me was her skin, it was so smooth… and clean. Her dress was too. I thought, for a split second, I was dreaming or she was a ghost. She took a step forward. So did I, backwards.

"Hello?" My voice cracked. "Are you okay? I... I think I'm hurt. Can you help me?" She didn't respond, only stared at me with a blank expression. We were stuck in lockstep—I stepped back, and she stepped forward.

I swallowed. "What’s your name?"

She blinked. Too slowly. Then, almost like she was guessing, she said, "Michael."

My stomach tightened. ‘Did she just say her name was Michael?’ I thought to myself. She must have noticed my confusion, my hesitation, the flicker of fear on my face.

"Claire," she corrected. I stepped back again. She matched it. "Katy." Her mouth moved, but her voice… shifted. Each name came out in a different tone, like she was cycling through voices that weren’t her own. I turned and walked faster. Her footsteps followed.

"What’s your name?" she questioned. I didn’t answer. My pace quickened. "What’s your name?" The words sharpened, like a needle dragging across a broken record. I ran.

"WHAT’S YOUR NAME? WHAT’S YOUR NAME? WHAT’S YOUR NAME?"

As I sprinted down the cracked two-lane road, I risked a glance back. She was still walking. Still coming toward me. But she never gained on me.

I’ve encountered more since then. They go through a catalog of names before they land on one they like, I presume. They always walk to you and ask you your name. I never answer them. They also always have something wrong about them; fingers too long, arms too short, eyes too big, ears too small, skin too smooth. None of them have wrinkles, they’re always clean, and they never know their own name. Maybe though, through more human interaction, they’ve learned. Learned how to plead and lie. Both very human qualities.

If it was one of those things, I needed to leave, that’s what I did. I found an old duffle bag in one of the back offices and emptied the first aid kit into it. I unplugged the laptop I had been writing on and threw it in there as well. All I needed now was a weapon. If the people could talk more eloquently now, who's to say they can't catch up to you as well. I don't want to know what happens when they reach you, best not to let that happen. The only “weapon” I could find was a metal pipe. I also threw some fireworks and fire sticks into the bag, perhaps I can do something with those later. I softly laid the bag onto my back, ensuring the straps don’t dig too much into my shoulders.

The knowledge of the city I was trapped in was limited, I’d only ever driven through it. I knew, however, there was a Walmart nearby. I needed food and more supplies, maybe even an improved “bed” and backpack. On the way I know there is a military surplus store, I had stopped by a time or two to reminisce on my army career. I knew what I’d need. One last look at the place I called home for a time, the empty shelves, the cold concrete floor, the echoes of last night’s paranoia. I stepped outside. The world met me with silence. Not true silence, but the kind that lets you know something is missing. No birds. No distant hum of life. Just the wind, tugging at the ruins.

The road ahead was cracked and pitted, lined with cars frozen in time. The doors were left wide open, their seats stripped to the frame by the shockwave. Some had remains inside, slumped over steering wheels or lying half-spilled onto the pavement. A few had been burned, the blackened remains fused with the seats. I couldn't bear to look. I had never been deployed in my four years of military service, I’d never seen a dead body. Either way the city loomed over me, waiting. As I clambered on, I saw a sign in the distance, it read:

“Entering Evermore City Limits”

The sky shifted from a bright mid-day, to a dull, purple evening. The surplus store wasn't far away now. It sat to the side of the riverwalk. I could hear it before I saw it, the slow, sluggish trickle of water now reeked of metal and rot. Before the world went to hell, this had been, what i presumed, the heart of the city, a place for tourists, late-night drunks, street musicians and overpriced beer. Now, it was a different kind of place. The buildings here were half-collapsed, the windows shattered. Some of the old riverfront restaurants still had tables set up inside, waiting for customers that would never come. The water was dirty, broken glass and bodies tangled in the shallow areas and wooden boards floated down the stream. Finally I saw it, “McCready’s Tactical Surplus Store”. I pushed through the wooden remains that were once a door and stepped over the bodies of dead shoppers.

The smell hit me immediately, the air was stale, and a faint odor of gun oil still hung around. The pegboards behind the counter were still full of gear, and the aisles were stocked with various implements. I knew what I needed. I climbed over the counter and grabbed an M-4 off the wall, below it a box of ammo sat there. I took a few boxes of 5.56 and placed them on the counter with the rifle. I picked out a swiss-army knife and placed it there as well. The back wall of the store was lined with backpacks and rucksacks. I walked over and pondered my options. This was so easy, everything I needed was here. I was so happy, the odds were finally turning in my favor. I should’ve known this fallen world would whoop me back into shape.

I had finally picked out what I needed. I pulled a large rucksack off the pegboard wall. I stuffed everything from my duffle bag in the largest interior pocket. That's when I heard it. A breath. I thought at first it was just the wind, but it was too quiet. That's when I heard a voice.

“Hello? Is someone there?” the person whispered, “One of those things is here. It going to hurt me”

I dropped the duffle to the floor and the rusty pipe fell from my grip with a loud crash. They sounded like a child, a little girl. How could a little girl survive out here, in all this… mess.

“Hi. Yes. I’m here. Are you hurt? Where are you?” I asked.

“Hello? Is someone there?” the little girl repeated, “One of those things is here. It going to hurt me”

“Hey. I’m here, you're okay now.” I said, her voice was coming from the back of the store, perhaps towards the restrooms or the staff area. I walked in the general direction of where I heard her voice.

“What’s your name?” the little girl asked sheepishly.

“Hey honey, my name is…” I stopped myself. I knew what was happening. As I rounded the corner into the staff area, I saw it. A tall white man with long greasy black hair, brown piercing eyes, and a smile that stretched sadistically across his whole face. His smile struck me, his teeth were pearly white but crass and jagged.

A light, on the ceiling, flickered on and off, casting him in an ominous glow. He asked again,

“What’s your name?” this time he said it in a deeper, more sinister voice.

I began to back up, toward where I had left my rifle. He began walking towards me. I brushed my hand on the countertop desperately grasping for the gun. The man didn't match my movements this time. All the others would perfectly match them as if they were mirror images. This time, he stepped up onto the counter, his legs stretching monstrously to reach. I heard his bones crack as they extended to the counter. When he perched the surface he marched towards me on his hands and feet. I hopelessly turned around and ran to get the gun. The man stepped onto my hand and dug his heel in hard. I yelled and jerked my hand back. I fell down and shuffled back. He jumped off the counter to catch me. I backed up into one of the aisles. He crawled towards me, his elbows were bowed out towards me. He asked,

“What’s your name?” this time in a high-pitched boy's voice. “What's your name?” he asked in a raspy old man’s voice.

He grabbed a hold of my lapel and pulled me close to his face, “What is your name?” His breath was cold and had a metallic smell.

I felt around on the ground desperate to find something to fend him off. My hand grazed over the metal pipe I had dropped before this eerie encounter. I gripped it in my hand and smashed it over his head. As the pipe connected to his skull… there was no resistance. One would think the skull of a human wouldn't give so easily. But it was soft, the pipe sank, collapsing into his head as if it were nothing but a fragile shell. He staggered back, his face slumped to one side. He began stumbling towards me again and mumbled,

“WaHt es YOur Nayme?”

He dropped to the ground, I bashed him a few more times, just to be sure he was dead. I’m still not sure these things can die, but what's a man supposed to do? I got to my feet and stumbled over to the rucksack I had previously packed with my valuables, If you’d call bandages and fireworks valuables. I lightly placed the rucksack on my back. My wounds were getting better but they were still very tender. I shuffled to the counter, acquired my rifle with its accompanying ammo, grabbed the knife, and perused the shop a little more. The only other implements I scavenged from that store was a canteen I could fill with water once I found a way to purify it, and tan combat boots and green range gloves. Finally I felt as though this store had put me through enough for one day so I left, I was headed to Walmart.

I kept my pace steady, ears sharp for any sound that didn’t belong. My M4 stayed low, ready. There were no signs of movement. No voices. This concerned me. All I heard was the wind, rattling the remains of a city that hadn’t quite finished dying yet. I crossed the bridge that was between me and Walmart. The water below was thick and dark, reflecting the twisted skyline in shattered fragments. Something floated near the banks, bodies, or at least what was left of them. I forced myself not to look, all though I knew this would become a thing I'd have to become more comfortable with seeing. The streets leading to the Walmart were a maze of abandoned cars, shattered windows, and items left behind in a hurry. A baby stroller tipped onto its side, a suitcase burst open in the gutter, a cell phone lay face-up on the pavement. Its screen cracked, a single missed notification still glowing. It was pitch-black now, but there it was, the glowing letters in the distance were unmistakable. Walmart. The sign still stood, its letters flickering against the night like dying embers. Ahead, shadows shifted beyond the overturned fencing. A glow of firelight. Voices. Laughter. And the crackle of a radio, clinging desperately to an old song. I crouched behind an overturned shopping cart, heart pounding. People. Real people. Or at least, they looked real. I inched forward, muscles tense. The firelight revealed them. Dirty, tired, wrapped in mismatched clothes, but talking. A small camp, right there in the ruins. Above them, the broken sign loomed, flickering against the dark:

“ OME N”

Not Home & Garden anymore. Just Omen. And maybe, that wasn’t an accident.
