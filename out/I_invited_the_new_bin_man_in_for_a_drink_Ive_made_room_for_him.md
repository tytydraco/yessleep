Whale fat – that’s what they used to make lipstick out of. The good stuff. This tastes like hurt feelings and impossible property ladders. It tastes like emojis.

Movement then. Outside.

The first time he went through my bins I nearly had him with an ironing board. A new guy. Didn’t even look up when I threw it. Glad he didn’t, glad he didn’t see me like that. You’ve got to be careful what you show, haven’t you?

And now I’m putting on makeup. Harder than I remember. Sitting here on YouTube, taking instruction from a stretch-faced embryo with a nose ring and a fringe. I wore my dungarees the *first* time round.

He’s quite deep in there, rooting around. The *temptation* to open the window and scream that there’s way more in here…I’ve made room for him too.

We’ve been in a game for a while now. Turns out you can’t just recycle anything. We live in a world where we can clone a sheep, print a gun and watch TV on a phone as the car parks itself, but everything and anyone around us would burn if we dared try and recycle the top film of a spaghetti carbonara for one. Almost invisible - but he’ll find it. Sniffs it out. Like a ferret. A sexually-magnetic ferret. His jaw muscles tense as he plucks each offending item – even his face has biceps. Nice to give them a little workout.

I picture him out there – *what I’d like to do to him*.

Trying to draw the eyebrows on now. Animating my face. Picking an expression I’m likely to wear for 80% of my day. But what if he *does* come in? It’s hard to show your genuine delight and surprise at something if you first have to disappear to the toilet to draw it on. What do I do if –

He's knocking. HE’S KNOCKING!

I can see his unmistakable shape even through the frosting. I left him a note - he’s doing a great job, better than the last few ever did, he should stop in for a drink - I’ve made a path to the kettle and everything.

He wouldn’t mind all this. This mess. It’s part of his job, isn’t it? Probably already saw me in the paper - I’ve hundreds in the attic, next to where I keep Mum. It’s been a few months since this last article, but – look, such an unflattering angle of the back garden. An easy headline, isn’t it? *Hoarder*.

He knocks again.

Never show them *anything*, Mum always said. When she went, must be a few months ago now, and I locked her away up there – I don’t know, I just don’t like things going out anymore. The journalists must’ve got themselves some drones or something. Mum would’ve hated that. She’d have been glad they didn’t find her. Without her face on.

I will go to the door.  Just got to move a few things around first.

I’ve already made some space by the couple of guys – Mum freaked them out.

She was right, Mum. She always was.
