Elliott and I had just finished a job for our boss. It was a simple errand; make a drop off and collect payment for a rare treasure that a collector had an eye on. It was something we had taken care of many times as employees in the antiques and rare collectibles industry. Once the rare item was safely in the proper hands, we headed to a local diner for some food. The two of us had just finished eating burgers, fries, and some pie when Elliott looked at his phone.

“It’s the boss Spencer. He wants us as soon as possible.”

“Cool. Let’s go.”

The sunset was just starting by the time we left the diner, and it made for a spectacular sight. The two of us eventually arrived at a private airstrip where there was a jet waiting for us. I saw our boss’s black sedan parked a safe distance away, and I pulled up alongside it and turned the car off.  By now the desert air was much cooler than before as we stood face to face with our boss, Carlton. A slight man with impressive eyebrows in his early 40s, he greeted us with a smile while his driver Nash, a well build guy in his 30s, politely nodded at us. Carlton was the head of one of the most respected firms in the country that dealt with rare treasures, antiques, and items that had been lost and were in need of locating.

“Well done on the job today boys.”

“No problem. So what are we doing here?” Elliott asked.

“Our friends up north were finally able to give us the location of The Grizzly’s treasure.”

A ripple of excitement went through the air. David “The Grizzly” Green was a prominent crime boss who died in an impressive shootout with law enforcement about 25 years ago. Before he went out in a hail of gunfire, it was widely rumored that he stashed a fortune in gold somewhere. Much of the fortune had been improperly taken from its rightful owners, and there was a longstanding legal claim on it.

“Really? After all this time?” Elliott whispered.

“Indeed,” Carlton nodded. “Some old associate of his just died and when going through his estate they found a map to it.” He held up a thick piece of paper to show us. “And according to this, the land it’s on no one technically owns. And we’ve been contracted to recover it by the people it belongs to.”

“No kidding?” I asked.

“Indeed. And I don’t need to tell you the recovery fee is massive. That’s where we’re going on the plane. We’ll go over the location in detail when we get there.”

“Nice,” I said.

We boarded the plane, strapped ourselves into the comfortable leather seats, and took the short flight. When it landed, we disembarked and saw that the arid desert of Arizona had been replaced with the crisp greenery of Montana in early October. There was still a small, but fading amount of daylight that made the mountains and pine tree peaks visible. Different than the desert, but just as impressive.

“Alright,” Carlton said as we all got into a waiting truck that had been arranged for us. “The word is the treasure is hidden under a log cabin where there is a labyrinth of caves. I have the directions to where there is an underground passage, and that should take us to what we’re here for.”

“But going in at night? Shouldn’t we have special equipment?” I asked.

“Correct. Always thinking Spencer. That’s why I like you. We already took care of it. Jackets, flashlights, knives, and bottled water in backpacks. Now it’s only a short drive from here, and once we find it, then we’ll gear up and head in.”

The drive was indeed short; a quick trek down a dark, quiet, pine tree lined road that wound around until it stopped at a seemingly abandoned log cabin. Elliott and I strapped on backpacks while Carlton and Nash did the same. Once we were all fitted with gear and had flashlights in hand, we slowly approached the cabin.

“According to this, there should be a secret tunnel located in the back sunroom under the floorboards. The path should eventually lead to where the treasure is hidden,” Carlton explained.

Without further ado, Nash slowly opened the door to the cabin. Its hinges were rusty, and it opened with a loud squeal. Not that there was anyone around to hear it. The cabin was in the middle of nowhere, with nothing but the mountain far off in the distance to see us.

We entered one at a time, our high-powered flashlights illuminating the ruined cabin. It might have had rustic charm once upon a time, but now everything was old and faded.

“The only thing missing is the guy with a hockey mask and a machete,” I said as I slowly walked around the cluttered and broken remains of the living room.

“Come on Spencer, where’s your sense of adventure?” Nash chuckled.

“My sense of adventure is just fine. I just prefer to leave the scary movie tropes for my time off.”

Everyone laughed as we carefully walked through what had once been the kitchen and dining room to the screened-in porch. Despite everything, it did give us a superb view of the moon, which was a perfect crescent in the crisp night sky.

“Ok,” Elliott began. “The passage has to be somewhere here in the floor.”

We all murmured our agreement and began prodding and stepping on the floor to find something out of place. After a minute, Nash stepped on a section that gave off a loud creak. That was our cue to immediately start tearing out sections of the thick rug covering the floor. When I yanked a particularly thick section that brought up a cloud of dust and the thick smell of mold, a trapdoor in the floor was visible.

Elliott immediately grabbed the metal rung attached to the trapdoor and tugged. It easily opened, and a blast of cold air hit us as we found ourselves staring into a deep tunnel.

“Alright,” Carlton clapped his hands together excitedly. “Let’s go.”

Our flashlights revealed we were walking into a long passage built off the structure of an interconnected series of caves. No doubt used by smugglers for a generation. Once I stepped down the wooden steps that led from the cabin into the earth, I tugged my jacket tighter around myself and we continued on our journey.

We’d been walking for about a half hour when I smelled it. The pungent odor of rot. And it wasn’t long before we were face to face with the source, a man lying face down on the passage floor. Despite the smell, the body was still very much intact, and he was wearing what could only be described as hardcore hiking gear. There was no doubt the guy had been here very recently. But from what I could see, his gear and the exposed flesh was covered in what looked like a thousand rips. Almost certainly the result of an animal attack or an animal finding the remains. Maybe both.

“Come on.” Carlton whispered. “We’re almost there.”

“What happened to him?” Nash asked.

Carlton shook his head. “I don’t know.”

Each of us stepped over the body in turn and continued walking down the tunnel. Then the ground began to incline, and we started to climb as the path twisted and turned through thick rock walls that were gnarled and twisted.

But then, our path began to even out and we found ourselves looking at a small opening in the rock wall. When we walked through it, we were in open air again. The cave had opened up onto a ledge overlooking an open field that was located between a cluster of pine trees. In the middle of the field was a cluster of sharp boulders that took up most of the space.

“Ok. According to this, the suitcase with the goods should be hidden under a giant flat slab of rock in the middle of the field,” Carlton said.

The four of us slowly approached, and we did indeed see the giant flat rock. The natural light was actually pretty good here, so with the addition of our flashlights, we could see a lot. From the angle we were at, I could make out the faint outline of a battered old suitcase sitting right underneath the rock. The problem was that we could also see the rock wasn’t empty, as there were three giant sleeping grizzly bears on top of it.

The sight caused each of us to go silent for a moment. The idea of going in there with grizzly bears, any one of which could devour me without a second thought, made me sweat.

“What do we do boss?” Elliott muttered while watching the sleeping bears.

“No problem,” Carlton said as he shrugged off his backpack and took out several large pistols. The sight didn’t phase us, as we all knew that sometimes you couldn’t be too careful in this business. We’d all narrowly escaped more than a few sticky situations in this line of work.

Carlton handed one gun to Nash and gave me the other before turning to Elliott. “You go in and grab the suitcase. These two will make a diversion if need be, but that shouldn’t be necessary. I can tell these bears are hibernating, so you should have nothing to worry about. But only if you’re game for it. If not, no one would blame you.”

Elliott had been through far worse than this, so I wasn’t surprised when he nodded. After taking a deep breath, he slowly climbed into the open space, taking care with each step while the three of us watched. Despite the chilly air whipping through the clearing, I was sweating. Each step I was half expecting one of the bears to wake up and roar with a vengeance before charging at Elliott. As I held the gun ready, the handle quickly became slick thanks to my sweaty palm. All we could do was watch Elliott get closer with every step, which took a painfully long time.

When he finally reached the giant flat rock, he slowly ducked down for a moment while he fished for the suitcase. Two of the bears had their backs to him, but one was sleeping with its head facing Elliot, and I had no doubt that with it being only a few feet above him, Elliott could probably feel it breathing. When he finally tugged out the suitcase and stood up, I held my breath. Fortunately, the bears did not move a muscle, and he began to walk back to us. I was careful to never let the bears out of my sight, but they were definitely hibernating. They hadn’t even made a sound.

Moments later, Elliott returned to us with the suitcase in hand. When he finally climbed back up the ledge and there was a barrier between him and the grizzly bears, he sat down, panting and sweating.

“Well done, Elliott,” Carlton nodded approvingly while handing him a water bottle that he downed in a few quick gulps. “You’ll definitely get a bonus for this.”

“Thanks boss.”

“We’ll take a brief rest before we leave. Since you have already done more than your share of hard work today, Nash will carry the suitcase the rest of the way. All you have to do is stay ahead of us with a flashlight. But first let’s look at the spoils.”

He bent down and gently zipped opened the suitcase. It unfolded easily, and the gleam of what was inside was stunning in the intense glare from our flashlights. Gold bars, jewelry, and coins were stacked thickly on top of each other.

“Not too shabby,” Carlton nodded. “Not too shabby at all. We’ll give it another minute or two and then get out of here.”

After Elliott rested, Carlton collected the guns back before Nash carefully picked up the suitcase and Elliott and I led the way back to the cabin. In what seemed like no time at all, we were climbing back up the stairs to the cabin’s trapdoor. Once we were back out in the fresh air and the suitcase was loaded into the back of the truck, Carlton shut it with a satisfied click.

“Now all that’s left is to take it to the appraisers and lawyers when we get back home. When we return, you two can call it a night. Well done again both of you.”

“Thanks boss,” Elliott said. “That was fun, let’s never do it again.”

Carlton laughed. “No doubt. I’ve never cared for bears either. I’ve always been more partial to wolves myself.”

With that thought, we all hopped in the truck and headed out of there. Everything was quiet until we got to the area where the plane was supposed to be waiting for us. We were about three miles away when Nash began to drive over a ridge overlooking a stretch of grass. Nash was about to say something when there was a loud crash, and in the blink of an eye, I felt the truck being hurled onto its side and all four of us were scrambled around while yelling profanities incoherently.

“Everyone alright?” Carlton asked once we had all extracted ourselves from the truck, which was badly dented and lying on its right side, which was a little too close to the edge of the ridge for comfort.

We all muttered we were. I was a little dizzy but nothing too bad.

“What happened?” I asked Nash.

He shrugged. “I don’t know. From the corner of my eye, I saw some shadow come out of the woods back there and moments later, I felt the impact like it hit us.”

“That’s insane,” Elliott muttered.

“Agreed,” Nash said.

“Well we won’t be able to use the truck to get us the rest of the way. So we go on foot. Spencer, grab the suitcase. And since I don’t like the looks of these woods, both of you take one of these,” Carlton instructed Elliott and myself as he produced the two pistols again.

He didn’t need to explain himself because I didn’t like the vibe in the air either. What had just happened didn’t seem normal. So I grabbed the suitcase and had a weapon at the ready just in case. For what exactly I didn’t know, but it sure beat not having a weapon.

The four of us walked in complete silence, with the wind occasionally howling at our back. As unnerving as being alone in the chilly night air for miles was, it beat having to worry about random people finding us with a fortune in gold. So the quiet had its upside. We kept close watch on the dense pines surrounding us on all sides and we steadily followed the road to the private air strip. With my watch, I was able to steadily keep track of our progress as we walked one mile, and then two.

As more time passed, I was able to recognize the area we had first arrived in. But that sense of partial relief didn’t last long, because just as I was starting to shake off the adrenaline from the truck being knocked off the road, I heard something. Voices in the distance.

We all immediately stopped and listened, our weapons at the ready and the suitcase clutched tightly in my free hand. The voices were not loud, or particularly close, but they were human sounding, and any human voice this far out in the middle of nowhere at night was something to pay attention to.

But the creepy part was that there had been no signs of footsteps or any other indicator of human activity. It was like a random sound in the woods that comes out of nowhere. The sweat began to dribble down my neck as we stood there. I had no idea what was going on, but I didn’t like it one bit.

After we didn’t hear anything for another minute, Carlton gestured for us to keep going, but to keep an eye on what was behind us as we did. Which was fine by me. So the walk continued on for what seemed like a painfully long time. At least once, I swore I could hear the sounds of someone, or something following me. But every time I turned around, I saw nothing.

When the sight of the plane on the private airstrip finally came into view, I had never been so happy to see a plane. And from the sighs of Elliott and Nash, I could tell they felt the same way. Our pilot opened the door to the plane’s cabin to greet Carlton, and that was the exact same moment there was the sound of rustling in the woods less than a mile away, and I could just barely make out the sound of a laugh. It did not sound like any laugh I had ever heard before, as it sounded too high and almost inhuman.

“Get in the plane,” Carlton hissed at us.

He didn’t need to tell us twice, as all three of us immediately hustled up the steps behind him, slamming the door shut behind us as we climbed into the plane’s cabin.

“And please get us out of here, NOW,” he commanded the pilot.

He didn’t need to be told twice either, because he hastily went back to the cockpit and within moments, was easing us down the runway and out of there.

Nash, Elliott, and I quickly strapped ourselves into our seats and prepared for takeoff. Relief was starting to flood back through my system. But just as we reached the end of the runway and were beginning to take off, I looked through the window and saw that the space where our plane had been was now occupied by several humanoid type figures, who were just standing there watching our plane leave. Since darkness was rapidly consuming the area, all I could make out was their general shape, which looked vaguely human but not quite.

Once we were off the ground and out of there, I turned around and saw Elliott on the other side of the aisle. He was watching me, and from the look in his eyes, I could see he had observed the same thing. Nash and Carlton were sitting straight ahead, simply relieved to be out of there and enjoying the plane’s steady ascent into the air back towards home. Good for them.

At some point I dozed off on the flight back home. Elliott woke me up when we landed, and we both happily went home and crashed. Carlton was able to return the treasure within the next few days, and we both received our cut of the finder’s fee by the end of the week. It was nothing to sneer at. I never did figure out who or what was following us that night, but I’m happy we never have to go back there again.
