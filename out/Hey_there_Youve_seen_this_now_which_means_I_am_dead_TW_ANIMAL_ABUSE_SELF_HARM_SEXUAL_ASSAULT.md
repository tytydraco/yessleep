Perhaps you found me by the lake. It is quite a beauty at night. You should visit it. I think with the ethereal glow of the Milky Way on its horizon, the calm waves of the crystal lake are to have a soothing effect, almost hypnotic. One can only feel tempted to be one with the waves. If you’re reading this, then you have read the little note in my pocket. You have read that I have left this letter in the secret drawer on my desk. What do I say, life was never quite the way I wished it would be. I wished for Mom and Dad to live long, happy lives. I wished Charlie to have all the treats and joys a golden retriever could have. I wished my sister, Ella, to grow into a doctor dad always wanted her to be. But now they’re all gone. I wish I could forget the way he mangled up Mom and Dad. How he threw their limbs at me to taunt me. How I wished I could tear away the handcuffs and murder him. But oh, I couldn’t. I did not have the strength in me. Why my family? More importantly, why me? Why did he let me live after making me witness the horrors? The crimes he committed against my family. The suffering my family had to go through. I wish this upon no one, not even my worst enemy should suffer this hell.  
I am sorry Sara. I am sorry for letting you down this way. I know I promised you a bright future and a loving family. I am sorry to have left you. I couldn’t take this any longer. After witnessing my parents getting butchered, being forced to watch my sister get raped, and being forced to ingest my own dog, I can’t. It’s too much Sara. The feeling that I couldn’t do anything but watch is eating on me. It’s gnawing on my flesh, bones, and soul. I can’t take this. That is why I am going. I am going to meet them and apologize to all of them. I don’t deserve to live. I had a happy life but now, I am worth less than a slug.   
I am sorry. To everyone that looked up to me and looked after me. I am sorry but I have to go now.   
To the bastard who caused all this, I’ll be waiting for you in hell. And you bet your demonic ass I will make sure the eternal inferno burns you that much more.   
  
  
  
This is the letter we found, from the poor boy’s room. He was only 18, yet forced into such torment. Reports on his background suggested his name was Dereck. Dereck Cooper. We found the remains of what we assume to be his parents in the kitchen- each body in 21 pieces. It would take days to assemble their bodies. His sister’s body was in his bedroom, brutally raped and disfigured. Perhaps what was most disturbing was two plates in the Cooper’s dining table, on which was what we later found to be Dog meat, cooked like a steak. One plate was empty with hints of the meat, while the other was half-eaten. We couldn’t find the dog’s corpse. He has taken his life two days after the incident is presumed to have happened. The killed must’ve found it a convenient place. The Cooper’s family home was an expansive ranch. One villa and a barn. About 12 acres of terrain which blend into the nearing forest, one they call the Silent Whispers. We found his body by the lake which is in the forest. It seems the boy stayed with their remains for a day or two, unable to process the grief, but finally engulfed by it decided to take his own life.  
  
A rather gruesome case in our calm and lively town of Springwoods.
