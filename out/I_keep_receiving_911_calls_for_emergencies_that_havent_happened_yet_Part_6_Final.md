My mind was racing, I did not have much time as I considered what to do. First, I had the pressing matter of escaping the facility. I had to leave and find M, I had to find out what he knew. While plotting a means of escape, I got another message on the phone. I read the message and saw a longer message than normal, it looked like instructions,



“You might want to write this down and follow these steps exactly, write fast since the message won't stay on the phone very long. Open the door in exactly one minute and fifty-two seconds after this message is gone. Turn right and go toward a maintenance closet, there will be a tunnel connecting it to main access concourse. Ignore the steam and any exploding pipes, that is just some cover for you. Don't take too long since if it dissipates a group of about a dozen guards will see you and likely catch you if you are not fast enough. Keep heading down the main path and take a left to find an employee locker room. There is a hazmat suit that will help disguise you and security credentials in case anyone asks. Head to the main bulkhead and place the phone on the power junction and wait for the door to open, there might be a hissing sound that is normal. Head out the main door and move along the North East Road to get to the path to building two. I will be waiting for you and your decision at the top of the watch tower.”



I finished writing down the instructions just as the message vanished. I looked at my hastily scrawled copy and remembered I needed to start counting. I did not have a stopwatch and obviously my phone wouldn't work so I counted and hoped I would get it right.



At the moment I reached one minute and fifty-two seconds, I threw the door open and ran. I moved per the instructions that I had tried to commit to memory in the brief time I had. I was moving as quickly as I figured I was supposed to be moving and I reached the main access path. I almost fell back and suppressed a gasp of surprise as several armed guards were visible on the other side of the path. Something was wrong, there was supposed to be some sort of steam cover. I tried to carefully step back around the corner but I heard a voice yell out to,



“Stop!” I was about to run back the way I had come from when that same voice turned into a scream as I saw several pipes around the guards head explode in unison. He was enveloped in scalding steam that burned him so severely he fell down into an agony induced sort of coma. I had no idea if he was alive but I did not have time to check. The other guards had heard his shouted warning and were on alert. I took the opportunity to flee down the corridor.



Sure enough when I reached the locker room it was empty of personal and a single hazmat suit was draped over a bench near the back corner. I put it on as quickly as I could and pocketed the key card that was with it as well. I found the main bulkhead door and placed the phone near the power junction and the hissing sound was almost immediate. I did not like the sequence of other sounds that began to carry through the machinery but I had no time to worry about it, so I moved on.



I hustled toward the main exit and guards were still moving about, but no one seemed to question me as I moved out. When I had almost exited the building, I looked back and felt a pang of guilt. I had to know what was really going on, but could I really endanger all these people? I did not know what M was really capable of, but I thought that maybe I should at least warn someone. I decided to approach the front desk and speak to the receptionist on my way out. She looked confused as I approached, no doubt wondering what a high-level scientist, at least according to my fake credentials, was asking of her.



“Yes, can I help you sir?” I recognized the voice immediately, it was Kylie Burke, the same woman who I had received the emergency call from about the fire I had prevented.



“Yes mam, I need you to deliver a message to Doctor Bianca Sinclair.” I wrote a quick message in my notes telling her about the danger to the facility and that they should evacuate and get everyone out of there as soon as possible. I folded the note and gave it to Kylie Burke and asked her to deliver it immediately. She looked confused but I did not have time to explain so I shouted,



“Now! That is an order.” And she took the paper and left with a scared and apologetic look. I felt bad for yelling at her, but unfortunately it had become a matter of life and death and time was not on our side. I needed enough time to get out of there without a commotion, so I couldn't tell her directly of the threat. I hoped by the time Bianca read the note or Miss Burke did, they would know about the threat and hopefully start getting people out of the building in time before whatever M had planned occurred and the whole place was blown away.



I rushed out of the building and toward the path leading to the watch tower. I could see it in the distance, beckoning me to my fate and whatever answers the enigmatic M had in store for me. I reached the base of the tower and I heard alarms sounding in the distance back at the main building. I hoped those were evacuation sirens. I started ascending the tower and I felt a familiar thrumming of energy and a static charge that made my teeth hurt. It felt like I was moving the wrong direction in snap shots that are arranged out of sequence. I knew that meant he was close. Reaching the top of the tower I saw him with his back turned looking down at the facilities grounds.



“There you are my friend; I knew you would make it. A little bit late but that’s okay. I think I owe you an apology. I’m sorry, I had to know, I had to know that you would make the right decision. You were a variable, but I had faith you would do the right thing. Isn't that what you are here to do now? The right thing?” M turned to face me and the black hood was down and I looked at the face of the man at least where a normal face should have been. What I saw in place of a face was a kaleidoscope of unnatural colors and hues not natural to this plane of existence and it made my eyes hurt. The wrongness of his entire being was palpable. He did not exist in this place or time, yet here he was an impossibility made possible.



I had no idea what to do or say, my mind had gone blank. I managed to think back to the one question I had been asking myself this entire time.



“Why me? Why was I the one you contacted?”



He gave a chuckle which was partly phased out by some unseen force and rendered half of it silent. He spoke once his voice returned.



“Right place right time, I suppose. That phone was on me when I was atomized. Somehow it can back as well, but it became unstable and I could not hold onto it anymore. When I woke up from the blast I tried to call 911 and get emergency services down to the building, that was when I realized I couldn't. I had been blasted out of time and reappeared in this, unstable form.” He held out his arms and I saw the odd array of impossible glimmers of half reality radiating off of him. He continued,



“The phone reached someone or something, but as it did it became more unstable. It started reacting to the temporal energy I was surrounded by so I had to get rid of it. It was too dangerous to just leave with anyone so I took a chance. When I saw you drop your phone down that flight of stairs, I used the moment to switch phones with you.” M pulled out a phone that looked just like the one I had been carrying, but after he threw it to me and I booted it up I realized this was my original phone. I had been carrying his phone this whole time and this device had apparently traveled through time. He watched my confusion and made an approximation of laughter again and continued,



“So not really a specific reason, though I will say you did not disappoint. As soon as you knew what was happening you did your best to stop all the death you could. That is an admirable quality, which is why I trust that you will continue to try and stop the things yet to come. This foundation, Hope for the Future, it has a rot that will lead it and the rest of the world into damnation. I know, I have seen it, both the way it begins and ends.” He took a step forward and held out a hand, gesturing to the building below and the entire foundation grounds.



“We had good intentions to start, if we were able to utilize this technology to tap unharvested resources out of time we could have a potentially endless supply of energy. That was the plan at least, until the intentions of the board had changed. Due to the machinations of the warmongers, the scientists that worked with defense contractors and only saw the way this could be adapted to military use; the scope of their plan for my research was shifted.” He seemed to trail off and looked off into the sky above. I was about to ask him to continue when he spoke again,



“I saw the thing that they will do, if left to their own devices. I have seen what they will enact with my life's work if they are allowed to. They wanted to try and transport living being thru time. I explained the potential harm in sending a living being backwards or forwards in time. Do you know what they end up doing?” He spun around and began raving,



“They recruit children and brainwash them while accelerating their growth rates using the device, to make soldiers that could be manipulated from birth and grow so quickly that it would give them another limitless resource besides energy.......people. They use this temporal manipulation to create a large army of these child soldiers among other atrocities. My own son gets taken and forced into the same program. He dies shortly afterward. My wife tries to put a stop to the foundation, but she is silenced as well.” He paused and spat on the ground and looked back at me intently and the horrible visage grew even worse.



“That’s not all.” M said while watching me recoil at his previous admission.



“Their plans devolve further if they are successful. The future becomes a dystopia where the foundation controls nearly all the levers of power and essentially becomes the main force behind the government and the nation's military. They rule almost unopposed and delve into even more unethical practices. All this being enabled by their exploitation of my life's work, the temporal transmitter. It is still intact and they will eventually manage to reactivate it and when that happens........." He trailed off again, clenched his fist and resumed,



"Before that happens, they must be stopped and the only way to ensure they are is if the entire rotten tree is felled.” His visage took on an eerie quality as he stood there staring intently at me while he declared his homicidal plans.



“In a few years they change the state of the world, in a few decades their manipulation ends up leaving the world a war-torn and blasted hellscape. They deserve a death far worse than what I am providing them.” I took an involuntary step back at the horrific implications of what he was saying. If that was what the future had in store, we were all in real trouble. I agreed that the device needed to be destroyed, along with his research but condemning everyone that worked there seemed a step too far.



I summoned my courage and stepped forward, asking him,



“What do you need from me? Why do you need my help or think I would help you kill all those people?” He pointed at me and said,



“You have a choice, you can decide. I know that in tough decisions you can make the hard call, well you have to make the call now, kill hundreds to save billions. You already set this in motion. When you placed the phone on the main power junction you sent a remote bundle of temporal energy into the device's main generator. When this is triggered, it will annihilate the building and everyone in it. It is all controlled by the phone, I had to abandon the phone because the energy it contains is harmful to me now. Yet it still contains great power beyond receiving message from out of time, power that I had to entrust to someone. I needed someone I could trust to do the right thing, that someone is you. You have to save us and save the world. All you have to do is dial 911 and........boom!”



A genuine smile spread on his tortured features and it looked the worst by far. I returned his gaze and asked him,



“Why not destroy the device and let the people go, why do they need to die? You cannot know for certain that everyone who works there is corrupt or would even be able to do any real damage without the device and your research.”



Instantly he snarled and responded,



“No, I have seen what they can do, what they will do. Even the most mundane of workers, all of them bow to power and tacitly endorse the monstrous regime with their inaction. They all have to die. Now make the choice!”



I had no idea if my message had been headed or what the status was on people evacuating the building. I saw a lot of vehicles moving about but still too many there. I couldn't do this, not now. I shook my head and just said,



“No, I can’t do it. I won’t, not everyone is guilty of what you say they did or what you say they are going to do, you can’t know for certain that given another way they would not do better and be better. I will help you destroy the machine but I won’t kill those people.”



M’s thoughtful regard for my response faded into a dour scrutinizing look that seemed multiplied by the shimmering distortion around his horrible features.



“You are making a mistake; they have to die. Quick and painless now, which only you can afford them. Or slow and painful later if I have to hunt them all down like I have been doing especially for the turncoats who betrayed me and stole my work on Project Echo.”



I stood my ground and tried to get him to focus on me, but my plan had failed and he saw through the ruse as he looked out and saw people fleeing from the building.



“What did you do!” He screamed at me and the crackling distortion around him intensified.



I obliged his question,



“I warned them, I am not on their side or yours. They can escape and you can destroy the machine and they can’t recreate it, at least not as far as we know. So, you don’t need to kill them. You can still walk away from this; you don't need to keep killing.” I watched his response and tried to tell if I had gotten through, but a moment of thoughtfulness was replaced by a snarl of anger and he lashed out again.



“It was that bitch Sinclair, wasn't it? I should have killed her when I had the chance, but I thought she would get hers when the building is annihilated. You don't know her like I do, you can’t trust her. She will kill you as soon as you become inconvenient to her just like she did to me.” I was concerned about what he had said about Bianca, but whatever her story, she and the rest of the people there deserved to live. They could not all be killed for a crime they had not even commit. I reiterated my intent,



“I warned them to evacuate, I told her and she knows about you now. The other directors want you dead but she is different, she is trying to get people out of there now. Give her time and wait and I promise I will help destroy the device. Just let them go.”



I saw immediately that he was shaking his head,



“They cannot be forgiven, I know what is in their hearts and minds I have seen their actions, people do no change like that. If they are capable of that degree of evil it is because it is already in them. I wish you had seen through the lies. I wish you had put the rest of the world ahead of these liars and monsters. Now I will have to make it right, I will have to stop them permanently.” He moved forward toward the ladder and I stepped in front of him,



“I can't let you go after them, not anymore. I will not let you keep hunting and killing these people.” M paused and looked me up and down and smiled,



“Are you going to stop me from doing it? We all know how that went last time.”



I tried to stand firm but he was right, whatever energy was fueling him made him nearly immune to damage and he had beaten the hell out of me last time. I had to do it though; I had to stop him. I planted my feet and held up my hands. Before I could perceive him moving, M was next to me. He grappled me and twisted around in an effortless motion that allowed him to leverage my weight easily.



I was promptly hurled off my feet into a heap on the edge of the tower nearly falling off the edge. I pulled myself back in the nick of time as a stomp leveled at my head crushed into the towers railing. He began pummeling me into the ground just like before. I knew he would not hold back; he had no more use for me, he was going to kill me. I had one last chance I rolled hard to my side as his fist slammed into the area where my head had been. I grabbed the phone from my pocket and gripped it in both hands and punched him with it and the blow connected. He cried out in pain and surprise. There was an odd distortion of energy upon contact. I considered that maybe the phone did have some strange ability to affect his powers.



He struck back and knocked the wind out of me with a punch to the gut. I thought I heard my ribs breaking. I was running out of options and knew I might die so I tried something desperate. I stood up near the edge and help up a hand to taunt him into attacking, he obliged and charged at me but I held up the phone dove to the side and whirled around to catch him unbalanced. I threw the phone at him and he instinctively caught it and I leapt forward while he was vulnerable and jumped and drop-kicked him straight off the tower. There was a long torturous, buzzing scream and then a horrible crunch and when I looked down, I saw that the phone had disrupted his abilities enough for gravity to finish the job. After coming back to life through time and space, Rolland Merrick was once again dead.



I slowly descended the tower, my body aching with the effort. I saw the ruined form of Merrick on the ground, the phone was on his chest and had survived the fall somehow. I reverently picked it back up and turned it over in my hands. This thing had saved my life but I still did not know the full extent of its bizarre abilities. My revere was disrupted when I saw a car approaching. Bianca and a group of the foundation's security disembarked. She walked up slowly and gasped when she saw the ruined form of Merrick on the ground. She gingerly stepped around him and spoke to me with a faint smile on her face.



“The building has been evacuated, but it looks like you handled it.” I nodded grimly but did not respond, I was to lost in thought. I got in the car with Bianca and we drove away to a safe location. Bianca and I got out of the car and she asked me about what happened. I told her everything that had happened and she was shocked by the outcome but seemed happy that I was okay. I asked her what she would do next and she was thoughtful for a moment and told me,



“Now that Merrick is dead the foundation will be more responsible with his technology to ensure this does not happen again.” My mind wandered back to what he had said about what happens in the future and I knew there was one more thing I had to ask her,



“What are you going to do with that device? It is clearly not safe and the damage it could do is catastrophic, maybe we should destroy it.” Her smile vanished and she considered her next words and spoke again,



“Merrick has created a marvel that can serve us all, with the foundations leadership we can seize the future and give hope to everyone.” As I heard the speech I had finally decided on what I was going to do. I had made my choice.



I took the phone out and looked at Bianca and smiled,



“Yeah, I heard a story about that once. I think I know the ending. This device, all that seeing the future or getting calls from it and all this mess. It is too dangerous for people to meddle in.” Bianca looked confused and tried to reassure me,



“Well, you can trust us, don’t worry we will not make the same mistakes.



I looked back in the direction of the facility, now safely evacuated and likely waiting on the orders of Bianca and the board to resume their work. I smiled, looked down at the device in my hand, dialed 911 and hit send.



There was a mushroom cloud sized explosion visible in the car windows behind us and it rocked the car and nearly sent us off the road. Bianca looked back horrified at what had happened and then looked to me with a confused and angry expression.



“I know you won’t, no one will ever again. Whatever the intentions, no one should hold that power and no one should know the future.”



After it was all over I returned home. I faced no reprisal for my action against the foundation. Maybe they had disbanded after the incident or maybe they are still working towards a similar end. I don't know but at this point I would rather not know anyway.



I do not receive the calls anymore on the phone. Both my original and the trans dimensional phone are finally, truly dead. I was fired from my day job for not showing up thanks to all of my misadventures, so I am in a tough spot now that it is over.



Since I need a new job after all this madness I figure maybe I will get a job as a 911 dispatcher. After all I have some experience on the job. Whatever the case I am glad I don’t know what will happen anymore, no one should have that burden and no one should be able to alter fate.



Take care and stay safe.
