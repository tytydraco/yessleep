I have nightmares almost every day. Of every kind. Disgusting and visceral, bombs exploding and war, classic horror kinds, public humiliation, impossible stressful tests, computer breaking, good ol' running from wild animals and so on. 

I thought I've seen it all. Well. 
This one began on a summer day. Me and my chemist friend stumbled upon this unsupervised kid in a yellow garment. ~6 years of age, big brown eyes. I was reluctant, but my friend approached and spoke.

The kid was smelly, but enthusiastic to hug us. I was uncomfortable, but reciprocated warmly. It was apparent they were neglected. I sensed my overly rational friend's energy changing. 

I remained detached and mentioned social services sensing their thought of acquiring a random kid. But their intention kept solidifying the more this kid jumped and talked. There was something off about child's speech. Some impediment like cerebral palsy, but different. I didn't think much of it. 

My friend finally decided they will adopt and treat kid's condition whatever that was. I was weirded out, but sure, some people are just more parental and less busy than I am I guess. Their bonding was fast and natural, the kid was delighted. I wished them luck..

Several years later I've met the two again and... I had no words for what I saw. So the "kid" haven't grown, but actually shrunk in size. Their limbs were nothing, but shriveled skin appendages dangling from the sides of the body as they were sitting in this advanced metal baby carrier.

Their neck was almost as thick as the body.
On top of it there was pale a bald head always facing the ceiling. The mouth hole with no lips stretched through almost the entire jaw. Nothing was left of a kid's natural profile. Flaps of flash closing and opening to breathe. Barely remaining and obviously not functioning ears, nose and eyes. 

The kid bent their weird neck like a reverse swan and my friend fed the mouth with a straw. No human voice was remaining to even have a speech impediment. Just soft pain filled moans. 
I reasonably asked what happened. 

And my chemist friend described how they were medicating the child through the years in so many ways, but the condition just kept worsening. I knew that was some fucking horseshit. It was the medicine, always the medicine. Side effects appeared, and we're treated with a stronger self made medicine until... this. But it wasn't the most disturbing part. 

It was actually the love. I saw how the friend had devoted their life to this, physically carrying this barely alive body, caressing the deformed head and knowing exactly every tilt of it meant. 
And the child was just so trusting. Left with no chance to have a moment without suffering. 


I was so disturbed and enraged... instead of ignoring this mild weirdness they have made it their mission to fix it. And oh my god this is just my mother trying to treat my transsexuality.

I was young. It was a minor easily fixable issue. But thanks to her "not letting me make this mistake" and letting herself make one billion of them I was forced into conversion. Something so inconsequential like a "different gender" turned into a multi year nightmare and lifelong deformities. Thank you for your love 👍
