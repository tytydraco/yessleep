I suppose this is the part where I admit I ignored the signs.

When the Musée des Civilisations de Lyon offered me an internship, it felt like divine intervention. I was twenty-six, living off instant noodles and toothpaste, fresh off a master’s in antiquities with no prospects and barely enough coins to do my laundry. I can’t tell you why they chose me—me, of all people—for such a coveted opportunity. But they did. And I wasn’t about to turn it down. This wasn’t just a job. It felt like a turning point. Like the hinge on which my life might pivot.

I left quickly. I didn’t have many attachments to sever, and even fewer possessions to pack. I didn’t own a car, or a bike, or even a public transit pass. So I walked. It wasn’t far, and I’d made the journey many times before. The museum had always drawn me in. Its corridors had shaped my very being; its archives were where I felt most alive. I knew Lyon well; its crooked medieval alleyways, its pale Renaissance façades, its bone-deep feel of elegance and grit. The city had once been the silk capital of Europe, long before it became a battleground of revolution. It had fed popes and poets and prisoners alike. It remembered everything. It never slept. Fuck New York, this was *the* city. 

Lyon’s past was tangled, which made it perfect for someone like me. I had grown up worshipping history’s leftovers. I haunted the museum in my youth like some sort of acolyte. Was probably pale enough to resemble a ghost, too. The oil paintings, the crumbling statues, the glass cases of bronze pins and broken pottery; they felt more like family than the one I’d left behind in Italy. They didn’t talk over me, didn’t ask questions. I knew their origins. Their dates. Their stories. And they, in turn, made me feel clever.

So when I arrived at the museum that morning, full of nerves, I thought I’d be spending the next year sorting catalog numbers and filing accession reports. Which was fine. Better than fine, actually. I had just started sketching the floor plan from memory when Monsieur Lefebvre—my supervisor, old friend, and the museum’s head curator—took me aside.

He led me out to the terrace, through the long-limbed garden tucked along the museum’s eastern wing. The air smelled of lavender. He placed a hand on my shoulder and crouched down beside me, unusually solemn. Then he pointed to the horizon, toward something I hadn’t noticed before: a building. Or rather, a shape. A silhouette etched into the far-off haze.

Even from that distance, it looked old. Ancient in a way that felt theatrical.
  
"Do you see that?" He said.

"I do."

"That is Château Leblanc," he said. "More importantly, that is the realm of Mademoiselle Juliette Leblanc."

I knew that name. Juliette was one of the last remaining figures of France’s old nobility; what scraps of it had survived the revolution, anyway. After 1789, the aristocracy had mostly been dismantled. But in Lyon, heritage still held weight. The city had always been something of an exception; less flashy than Paris, more ancient than Marseille. Its history tended to linger, you know? 

She also happened to be one of the museum's top patrons. 

“She’s requested a protégé,” Lefebvre went on. “She claims to have discovered something—something remarkable—at a site near the château. She asked specifically for someone from our staff. And she's chosen you.”

I quirked an eyebrow. "Expenses paid?"

He laughed. "Frugal as ever, my girl," he said, a twinkle in his eye. "All expenses paid."

It felt surreal. For the past few years, I’d been digging into Lyon’s lesser-known occult history; its strange, winding flirtation with alchemy and Hermetic philosophy. The silk merchants of the 17th century were rumored to conduct private rituals in their gardens; the printers in Saint-Jean once smuggled forbidden texts from Rome. I’d started the research in Paris, down in the catacombs, but all the trails led here. To Lyon. And now, somehow, to her.

Just as soon as I had arrived at the museum, I was leaving. The better part of my childhood was dreamt dreaming about this museum—it's rising walls, it's antique flourishes—and here I was, leaving it bereft of the many improvements I had in mind, in favor of a chateau which stood as large in presence as it did in size. I felt some sort of way about it. Excited. Sad.

I should state this now; my loyalties are to the museum. Nothing else. No*body* else.






I arrived at dusk the next day. By carriage, if it matters. I think it does. Dusk was settling across the Rhône Valley. Lady Leblanc's hired valet would only take me so far up the path to the château before he refused to go any further; tradition, he said. People had traveled to Château Leblanc by carriage since the Middle Ages. So I boarded the carriage and it rumbled all the way up to the rather simple iron gate that guarded the estate. The driver unlocked the gate, let me inside, locked it behind me, and then shuffled off, tight-lipped. I approached the front door and knocked.
  
One. Two. Three.

It opened. Just a sliver. A mousey young woman stared through the gap. She was slight and pale with brown hair pulled into some approximation of a bun. She opened the door fully and used her arm to gesture me inside.

The château was enormous, pale, and cold even in June. There were no servants, only a tall man in a dark coat who took my suitcase without speaking to me.

And then there was Juliette.

She was beautiful. She wasn't old, and yet she had an ancient air about her, timeless like parchment. She had inky black hair, folded into a neat braid which fell over her shoulder. And her eyes were heavy-lidded, perhaps weighed down by her thickly laid mascara, accented by darker eyeshadow; this was the unique makeup favored by the former French aristocracy. Anywhere else, it was just makeup, but on her, it was an inheritance. 

She stood at the top at the sprawling staircase which seemed to take up half the room, and when her eyes met mine, she smiled, and descended, the carpet eating and then releasing her footprints. She was tall, much taller than me; I'm five-five, and she easily had half a foot on me. Her dress was unusual, tailored in a way I couldn’t quite place. It looked expensive, but old-fashioned. Maybe handmade.

“You’re admiring the stitching,” she said, her voice soft, almost amused. “It’s Chevalier’s work. She is my steward, tailor, cook, and closest friend.”

She gestured behind me. I turned and saw the brown-haired girl again, standing quietly by the door. She gave a short bow.

I wasn’t sure what to say. “This is a beautiful home,” I offered.

“Thank you,” she said. 

We made for her study. She led me to an elevator, which she affectionately called an ascending room. It looked like something out of a 1900s photograph: wood-paneled, with brass gates that closed like a theatre curtain. We rose in silence to the top floor, where the air turned sharper, colder. Her study was tucked into a far corner.

It was... certainly studious.

Glass cases brimmed with wet specimens. Vials and jars with parchment labels that looked like potions. The room had a very deliberate aesthetic. I didn't take her for a scientist, but it seemed she had yet more secrets to reveal to me. A false backboard in her dresser led to a smaller room with a desk and inkpot, and not much more in the way of furnishings. 

"Is there a reason your study is so out of the way?"

She shrugged, an anachronistically casual gesture. "Whim, mostly."

We spoke at length about the dig site. Or rather, she spoke. I listened. I still didn’t understand what she wanted with me. I was an intern. Inexperienced. She had access to world-class experts. What did she hope to gain from me that my superiors couldn’t offer?

Eventually, I asked.

"I must inquire, my lady," I began. "I am a young intern, with minimal knowledge in archaeology; as I'm sure you know, I was a journalist for much of my life. What..." I stumbled over my words. "What need could you possibly have of me?"

She looked at me curiously, for so long it became uncomfortable. "Surely it has not escaped you that you are the only woman on staff at the museum?"

"I am not actually employed, I—"

"Perhaps I was not comfortable with men in my chǎteau," she said firmly. Flat and final. 

I stammered, cheeks heating up. "I— I didn't mean to offend—"

Her gaze softened. She leaned in and patted my cheek affectionately, her fingers unnaturally lithe, nails sharp and long, painted red. "That's okay, my dear." She stood, dusting off her gown. "Besides, we have much more important things to discuss."

She walked me back down the stairs, speaking casually about the estate and the weather, until we reached the guest wing.

My room was lavish. Gilded sconces. Velvet curtains. I had grown up in the slums of Lyon. This place might as well have been Versailles.

“When you wake tomorrow,” Juliette said from the threshold, “we’ll visit the dig site.”

She paused.

“I’ll have Chevalier bring your linens. Rest well, Daisy.”

Before I could respond, Juliette flitted away. It struck me, then, how otherworldly she seemed; not merely beautiful, but uncanny in a way I couldn’t name. Still, I remained rooted to the spot, my eyes trailing the path she’d taken long after she vanished around the corner. It wasn’t until a featherlight tap stirred my shoulder that I turned, startled.

Chevalier stood, holding a folded garment in her hands. She extended it to me. "Your linens, my lady."

"Thanks," I said. "And you can call me Daisy."

She blinked. Her composure faltered, just slightly, like I’d committed some transgression. I opened my mouth to say something else, but she bowed her head and excused herself first, vanishing down the hall like a ghost before I could speak again.

I changed into the linens, pale and thin. The hem did not begin until just below my collarbone and above my breasts. I thought it was strangely revealing. I noticed, then, that the cloth pooled at my feet. This nightgown, too, was tailored for a woman of immense height. This nightgown was Juliette's. It felt inappropriate, wearing another woman's clothes. Nonetheless I slipped under the covers to retire for the night.

I woke at what I believe was two in the morning, long before the dig site opened. I closed my eyes. Stared at the blackness until I opened them and now it was three. I had my quota of tossing and turning before I rose, slipping my cold feet into the house slippers I had been provided, and exiting my chambers.

When I arrived, Juliette told me to make myself at home, so I figured now was the time to take her up on that. I wanted to explore. I wandered aimlessly, the way a child might wander a cathedral, with awe and faint trespass in each step. I found the dining room, the kitchens, the lonely salons. Lavish spaces dedicated to idleness and indulgence, filled with furniture no one touched. Strange how many rooms went unused, while my siblings and I—six of us—had once been packed into a single bedroom like sardines.

I made my way upstairs. The second floor held the servants’ quarters, and Juliette’s own suite. I hovered near her door for a moment, caught by some impulse I couldn’t name. The thought of waking her stirred something foolish and bright in me—something I swallowed down just as quickly.

Instead, I turned away. I returned downstairs, to the foyer. To the right side of the room was the elevator we had entered before.

I glared. Glared some more. 

The elevator groaned as I stepped inside. I hadn’t noticed it before, but just beneath the button for the ground floor was another: down, which was to be expected, except that it was faintly illuminated, indicating it could be pressed. I paused, glancing around as if someone might stop me, then did just that.

With a reluctant shudder, the lift rumbled to life.

The stone walls visible through the gate were damp, marbled with moss and lichen. It was the kind of stone Lyon is built on; old Roman foundations that once held up aqueducts, forums, and catacombs. After five long minutes, the elevator heaved to a stop. Its gate slid open with an echoing groan.

A narrow corridor stretched before me. A wall sconce, still lit, illuminated the darkness until the light ended and the next sconce illuminated the remainder. I could not see an end. I walked for yet another unreasonable amount of time, and then came to a... I don't know. It was a vast, circular room, with adjacent hallways spitting off from it. One such hall curved sharply and led to a heavy door.

I pushed it open.

Let me be clear: I am not someone given to hallucinations. I don’t have episodes. I don’t drink. I don’t touch pills. I’ve never even been prone to dreaming. But what I saw in that room—I know what I saw.

It was a person.

But... not. Well, it was a person. A homosapien, as far as that designation went. It was terribly emaciated, veins bulging, chest concave. Its skeleton seemed too big for its skin. It was bound by rope to the corners of the operating table it lay on, beside a table of syringes and vials. It could have been anything. I approached it. I poked it. The skin squelched and broke, caving in, and it screamed. A raw, shrill sound erupted from its chest; inhuman, rattling, endless. The pipes above shook with the force of it. I stumbled back, then turned and ran. Back through the corridor, into the elevator, up to the second floor, through the hallway, and finally to my chambers.

She couldn’t have heard me. There was no way. Her quarters were two floors above ground. That thing, whatever it was, was buried beneath stone and soil. There was no way.

For half an hour I lay there, whispering reassurances into the dark. I wasn’t calm, not really, but eventually I went still. Drifted. Not asleep. Not quite awake.

Then knocking.

My door creaked open.

Soft footsteps padded in. The mattress dipped.

“Daisy,” came her voice, low and silken. “Daisy.”

I let my eyes flutter open slowly, pretending to stir. Juliette smiled down at me, gentle and radiant.

“Breakfast will be ready within the hour,” she said. “You may borrow anything from the wardrobe.”

I nodded, and she vanished.

I chose one of her spare dresses. It smelled faintly of cedar and lilies. At breakfast, the food was oddly chewy, dense in a way I couldn’t place. I tried to eat, but I kept glancing at her. At her hands. Her mouth. Her eyes.

I couldn’t stop thinking about the thing I’d seen, but even more, I couldn’t stop thinking about Juliette.

I’m in my chambers now. We leave for the dig site in an hour.

I don’t feel safe here. But I have to know what she meant for me to see. What this place is. What she is.

I’ll write again when I can.

Wish me luck.
