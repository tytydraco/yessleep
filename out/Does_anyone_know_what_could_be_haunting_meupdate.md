Smashing the mirror was a very, very, very bad idea. 

After the events of the other night, I went to speak to the old woman who originally sold me the mirror.  I walked my dog again, round to her house and knocked on the door. I must have been there for 10 minutes just knocking until one of her neighbours came out weilding a watering can.

"Are you looking for Maria?" The man with a small moustache asked 
"Yes, do you know when she will be back?"
"Uhm no, im watering her plants" he gestured to the watering can "she aadly took a nasty fall and broke her hip last week, shes at (not saying name for privacy reasons) hospital if you want to visit her" 
"Thank you!"
I ran home, put my dog back in the house and drove to the hospital. I had no idea what I was actually going to say. Hi I bought a mirror off you and now my life's a living hell! I asked for her room, and walked up to it. I waited outside the door for a second, hesitant to go in. It felt so wrong, but I really was desperate. 

The room was small, plain and smelt chemical. In the bed, was a small, frail frame of Maria. She turned to me, with a confused look on her face. 
"Are you a doctor?" She asked. She sounded even weaker than when I had spoken to her before.
"No, not exactly. I uh, well I bought a mirror of you and" her face dropped. 
"I'm so sorry" she shook her head, and played with the thin hospital sheets. I walked over, and took the seat by her bed.
"Look, that was never supposed to be out for sale, my son, uh" she shook her head again. "I told him everything in the attic was to go, i forgot that the mirror was there. I swear i'd never put the burden of adaline on another person"
"Adaline?" I asked
she smiled Softly. 
"Yes, my late husband arthur - he, he brought the mirror home one day. And then she begun to appear. I'm sure you know the story" I nodded, as I saw her looking at my partly healed scratches. 

"Well, arthur put her in the attic, and thats where she stayed, until one day - I. oh God I cracked the mirror. She got out. And Arthur, he thought he thought he saw little ginny - our granddaughter - in the river by our house, he said he saw her little blond hair under the current" she teared up, wiping her eyes trying to keep it together. I reached out, squeezing her hand.she gave me a warm smile. 
"He jumped in after ginny, to save her. But he never came out" she was crying by now  the memory of poor old Arthur was making my own eyes prick. 
"It was the reflection of adaline, Ginny was in the house the whole time" she shook her head silently. "I got it fixed, and didn't go in the attic ever again" 
"My advice to you, is lock it up. Dont risk her getting out.the crack was enough for her to slip through. God knows what would happen if it broke " my heart dropped to the floor. I felt my face pale, she saw it too. 
"What? What happened?" She looked worried. I just stared at her. She knew. 
"Run. Get out of there now.move as far away as you can." She paused, and her eyes went wide. Her face fell, and she started to cry again. 

"I'm sorry, its too late. She's here" I looked around frantically. I could hear her laughing at me. So I ran. I ran out of there not looking back until I reached my car. I just sat in the parking lot for a bit, thinking it over, soaking in the information I had just received. 

Defeated, I returned home and I just sort of tried to continue on. Maybe the old woman was wrong. But I begun to notice little things again. I was doing the washing up after dinner that following evening and when I turned around all the pots I had put away were back out on the side. The tv turned on at stupid times in the early morning and she is still in the mirrors. Except she's everywhere now. She's in my closet peeking out. In the reflections on my car. I've realised she's following me now. 

Last time she got destructive only when we acknowledged her and feared her. So, I tried my best to ignore her. We can't afford to move again, and I really don't want to have to so, I tried to put up with her. 

She followed me to work, knocking my coffee over my lap, shredding my freshly printed documents and turning off my computer. She almost got me fired, by hiding my notes and sending paper upbthebtable while my boss spoke. She's there in the reflections of the fridges in the local supermarket, throwing tins across the store, laughing in my ear as she does so. The worst thing is, Lily can't even see her. She thinks she's gone. 

Adaline knows what she's doing. She's using them to hurt me. I see her around, leaning over my son, reaching out to my girls. Her hair covers her face, but I can still see her sick little grin underneath. She copies mollys laugh, she laughs into the night, thudding around. She bangs on the walls, she scratches and bites me when I do manage to sleep, and hides my things. She's pushing me to my limit.  

Last night, we were watching tv, when I saw her running back and forth behind me from the vase. I kept seeing her pausing, waiting for me to react. The tv switched off with a click. I rolled my eyes and leaned for the remote, I was getting used to her crap, when Lily sort of yelped. I spun round, she had a tiny gash on her cheek. Her blonde hair was down over her face, eyes wide with fear staring over my shoulder. She looked so small and weak. I'll never forget that look, as its the last thing I'll ever see of her. The vase came flying through the air, smashing full force into her, knocking her down. 

I knew I had to leave, I pulled Lily up, she was unconcious but breathing, and rest her on the sofa. There was crimson everywhere, her soft hair dyed red. I desperately called 911, whilst the lights flickered, and doors slammed. 

"Mom? Dad?" I heard madison coming downstairs. 
"Madi please go back upstairs, lock you and your siblings doors please" I tried to keep the fear out of my voice, I was trying not to cry. 
"Dad? Whats going on" she called. Her voice was wavering. 
"I love you sweetheart, okay? Please just go" 
I heard her retreat. I grabbed my phone, it wasn't working, I was smearing blood over the screen, when it cracked in my hands and went black.
I jumped up, the neighbours could help me. As I stood up, glass begun to rain down on me. Every mirror, window, ornament exploded around me, and I yelled out. I heard the kids crying and screaming upstairs. At the top of them, I thought was molly, and I was almost crushed with fear as I bolted up to get her. But it wasn't molly. The kids rooms were wide open, and she was stood there laughing. I didn't want to see what she had done, I got a sinking feeling, and just knew. 

The girl who's been haunting me has long black hair and a pale blue dress. Her eyes are black, her face is cracked like a porcelain dolls, she has an evil little grin thats too large for any face, and she is trying to kill me. 

I left, driving as fast as i could. she wants me not them i told myself. I banged on the neighbours door, screaming at them to call the police and then I left. I was on the news, you probably saw me, caught on my neighbours doorbell camera, covered in blood and hysteric, crying and shaking. They really think I did that to my wife? They think I did that to my family? I should have protected them. I should have left sooner. The photo they used was of us on our holiday to Spain. My children smiling joyously, eyes sparkling, faces smeared with ice cream i had treated them to. Lily hugging them together, she was looking up at me, love in her eyes. Behind the camera was me, soaking up the beautiful moment together. It was my favourite picture. I pulled out the mini one of that same picture that i keep in my wallet. On the back is a heart lily drew with a matching "i love you" I would give anything to go back to that moment, we were all so happy. I clutched that picture and sobbed. 

I'm on the side of the motorway, typing this on my work computer. I just want someone out there to know I'm innocent before I get dragged away and put in prison. But she's still here, laughing at me in the backseat, with her evil little grin, and blood stained dress, taunting me with mollys laugh.
