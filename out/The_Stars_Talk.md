My name is Joshua, and I am the son of the famous, now missing, Dr. Samuel. But truth be told, he was never much of a father to me. His work always came first, and I was just an afterthought.

Even so, I can’t deny that he was brilliant. A genius, even. I grew up in his shadow, always compared to him, always expected to follow in his footsteps. I hated it. I hated the way people looked at me, expecting me to be something I wasn’t.

But Mom always told me, “You are not your father. Don’t think that you are. You are you.”

Kind of corny, to be honest. But it kept me from drowning in the disappointment of not being as smart, as brilliant, or as important as my father was.

His disappearance was a surprise to me, and devastating to my mother. Financially, we were fine. My father’s books still generated endless income, ensuring we never had to worry about money. But that wasn’t the point.

For all his flaws, my mother loved that man.

And even though I never wanted to admit it, I was affected too. He may not have been much of a father, but no one just disappears without a trace.

No one knew where he went or why.

He disappeared a year ago, right after finishing his so-called project, something he claimed would help us discover more about the universe.

Personally, I never bothered investigating whatever he was working on. Until now.

Back then, I had school to worry about, and even if I wanted to understand, I couldn’t. Whenever he got into that thinking mode of his, he'd start mumbling to himself, long, complex words that meant nothing to me. Science mumbo jumbo. But Mom humored him, always smiling and nodding, even though I could tell she was just as lost as I was.

Despite everything, my father had already retired, believe it or not. The constant book sales meant we could live comfortably, his work was a staple for college students, or as I liked to call them, poor suckers forced to buy his books.

I shared the same fate as them, of course. Different field, same bullshit.

After he retired, he converted the garage into his personal lab. We didn’t even own a car, so it wasn’t like anyone was using the space. I thought, maybe, just maybe, this meant he would finally spend more time with us.

I was wrong.

Instead, he just holed himself up in that room, tinkering with something, some machine he never talked about. I’d bring him food from time to time, and he’d thank me without looking up, already lost in his work again.

The machine itself looked ridiculous, like an old communicator but with oversized antennas, a dish, and a telescope attached to it. A complete mess. But knowing my father... Maybe it was something special.

After months of the same routine, the same dull weekends, the same quiet days, one day changed everything.

Mom had gone to the grocery store, it was close by, and I was lucky enough to have no classes that Saturday. Just a lazy afternoon, scrolling through mindless garbage on my phone.

Then I heard it.

A scream.

Not just any scream, my father’s scream. Loud. Raw. In pain. Desperate.

I didn’t think. I jumped out of bed, sprinted down the stairs, and nearly kicked the garage door open.

And there he was. Kneeling. Clutching his head. Still screaming, that horrible, gut-wrenching sound.

The machine beside him was humming steadily, but I didn’t care. I shoved it aside and grabbed my father, trying to shake him out of it, to do something.

But it was useless. Panic gripped me. My hands trembled as I pulled out my phone, calling Mom. Come home. Now.

She was already on her way. Good. But even over the phone, she could hear him, the scream still filling the house, rattling in my skull.

“Call emergency services,” she said, her voice sharp and frantic. “I’ll be there soon.”

I threw open the garage door, and the sound spilled into the street. Neighbors started coming out, alarmed. Old Man Tom was the first to approach. He had been in the military once. A tough man, unshaken by most things.

He tried to talk to my father. Tried to reach him. But it was no use.

Dad’s scream never wavered. His voice strained, cracking, the sound of his own pain cutting into him like knives.

I called for emergency services, my hands shaking so hard I nearly dropped the phone.

By the time the paramedics arrived, Mom was already running up the driveway. She was haggard, breathless, her eyes wild with panic. When she saw Dad, she became a nervous wreck.

The paramedics had to sedate him. Even then, his body shuddered from the effort of screaming.

They carried him onto the stretcher, his face pale, mouth still slightly open like he wanted to keep screaming but his body had finally given out.

Mom went with him, but before she left, she turned to me. “Stay here. Secure the house. I’ll call when I know more.”

She had that look in her eyes. The kind that meant I would be in serious trouble if I even thought about leaving.

As the ambulance pulled away, Old Man Tom stood beside me. He exhaled slowly, shaking his head.

“I know this isn’t the right time, kid… but I saw your father’s eyes.” His voice was low, uneasy. “Whatever he saw… it scared him. I had a friend once. Same look. A look of someone who’s seen something they weren’t supposed to.”

I didn’t know what to say. I just nodded. Tom patted my back and walked off, leaving me standing there in the cold.

I don’t know how long I stood there. Eventually, I went back inside, locked the garage, and sat in the living room. Wishing I had gone with them.

The next day brought a new kind of dread. Not just fear, but something heavier, something that sat in my stomach like a stone, making me feel sick but never enough to actually throw up.

I hadn’t slept. Mom and Dad were still at the hospital, the one just outside town. I knew the place. I planned to visit them after checking the house.

Mom had assured me that everything was fine. The doctors said Dad’s reaction was similar to PTSD, though they still had no explanation for how he could have developed it.

And Dad?

He was fine, too.

Mom let me talk to him over the phone, and when I heard his voice, I froze.

He was laughing. Joking. He sounded… happy.

“Don’t worry, son. Nothing to concern yourself with. Come visit me and your mother later, alright? Now listen to your mother, okay?”

Then he passed the phone back to Mom. But when the call ended, something didn’t sit right with me.

It was his tone. It was a voice I hadn’t heard from him in years. When I was a kid? Sure. But as he became the scientist he was, that warmth disappeared.

And now, after a night of screaming like he was being ripped apart, he sounded like the father I barely remembered.

I needed to see him for myself.

I locked up the house, did what I needed to do, and ran out the door. The bus stop wasn’t far. I barely felt the cold as I waited. I just needed to see him. To know that it was really him.

Entering the hospital only made my anxiety worse. I walked straight to the front desk, asked for my father’s room, and didn’t even bother with the elevator. I took the stairs, two at a time, barely noticing the burn in my legs. My mind was too busy racing.

I didn’t knock. I just opened the door.

And there he was. Joking. Laughing. Smiling.

Mom was peeling fruit beside him, feeding him pieces between their conversation. Dad was smiling. Not just a tired smirk, not a distracted nod, a full smile, teeth showing.

It was so rare that I almost didn’t recognize it. The moment I stepped inside, they both turned to look at me. I hesitated. For some reason, I felt awkward as hell.

Then Dad chuckled, shaking his head.

“Look at this guy! I’ve never seen him move with purpose, and now he’s doing it for his dear old dad!”

Mom slapped his shoulder playfully and motioned for me to come closer.

I walked in, hesitantly, still trying to process what I was seeing. I must have sat there for minutes, maybe hours. Just listening, watching, unable to believe it.

Dad was… acting like Dad. Not Dr. Samuel, the scientist. Not the man who spent years locked in his garage, lost in his work. Just Dad.

And I didn’t know if I should be relieved or terrified. I had wanted this side of him to return for so long. I thought it was gone forever, buried beneath years of research, of obsession.

But even if I wanted it back, badly, desperately, something about it didn’t feel right. Even if I tried to believe it.

It’s funny how things work out.

Just when I thought my father had truly returned, it was all a lie.

Or maybe… maybe he just did it to soften the blow.

But honestly, it would have been easier if he had just cursed me out, spat in my face, and disappeared. That would have made sense.

Instead, he gave me three days.

Three days of being the father I had always wanted. Three days of giving my mother a happiness I hadn’t seen in years. For three days, he was just Dad. No science, no experiments, no talking about the machine, just with us.

I almost forgot the years of distance. I almost believed it. Then… that conversation happened.

Mom was already asleep when I saw him outside. He was standing in the yard, motionless, staring at the sky.

I almost laughed. Dramatic much, Dad?

I went downstairs to call him out for his ridiculous pose, but the moment I stepped closer, I saw the tears.

Tears streaming down his face.

I froze.

"Da... Dad? What’s wrong? Why are you crying?"

He wiped his face quickly and turned toward me with a sad, quiet smile.

"Joshua… I’m sorry. I’m so sorry for not being a good father to you."

Before I could even respond, he pulled me into a hug. I stood there, frozen. Awkward. Unsure. I didn’t know how to react, but I hugged him back. After a few moments, I just… guided him inside.

That was the last time I ever saw him.

The next morning, Mom’s screaming ripped me out of my sleep. I shot up, heart pounding, my brain still trying to wake up. I could hear her hysterically calling Dad’s phone, over and over, shouting his name.

I ran straight to their bedroom. She was sitting on the edge of the bed, clutching his phone with both hands, her fingers digging deep into her own skin.

Trembling. Sobbing. Whispering “no” over and over.

Dad was gone, panic set in as I tried to make sense of the situation. I did my best to calm her down, but nothing worked.

I was getting nervous and anxious. My own heartbeat hammered in my ears as I ran through the house, searching every room, every hallway, every damn corner. Nothing.

Dammit.

I sprinted outside and ran two blocks to my aunt’s house. It was too early in the morning for me to be banging on their door, but I didn’t care.

Uncle opened it, his eyes barely awake, and before I could even catch my breath, I blurted everything out.

Surprisingly, my words came out clear enough for him to understand. His face hardened instantly.

He turned his head and shouted inside.

“Janice, we have to go. Jena’s in trouble.”

Aunt Janice was half-dressed, hair a mess, but the moment she saw me, she connected the dots instantly.

She didn’t even put on shoes. Just grabbed her slippers and ran after us back to the house.

That was a year ago.

I remember that day etched into my mind. And still to this day I feel it like a weight in my chest, a bitter, lingering ache that never fades.

Things have settled now.

But Mom? She was never the same.

Aunt Janice visits more often, keeping her company, keeping her from completely falling apart. But I still hear her crying in her room at night. No matter how much time passes, it never really gets better.

Remembering those moments stirs up a mix of emotions.

After Mom finally calmed down that morning, Uncle handed me a letter.

I have never been so angry in my entire life as I read it.

Jena,

I’m sorry. But I can’t. If this continues, I don’t know what I will do to myself.

Don’t look for me. Take care of Joshua.

I left everything to you.

Samuel.

Goddammit, why?

After some time, after the police were notified, after the reality of it all began to sink in, I finally made a decision.

I had to go to his lab. I had to know.

Why was he screaming that night?

Why did he suddenly change?

Why did he do this to me? To us?

I took the keys from my parents’ room and walked to the garage, gripping them so tightly my fingers ached.

The moment I unlocked the door, I braced myself for what I expected to see, the mess we left behind when we rushed him to the hospital. But the second I stepped inside, I knew something was wrong.

This wasn’t the mess I left. I flicked on the light and there it was.

Dad’s machine or what was left of it. Smashed. Broken. Scattered across the room in pieces.

Shards of metal littered the floor, some embedded into the walls, others crumpled like he had ripped them apart with his bare hands.

Papers. Books. Notebooks. Torn, their pages ripped out and thrown everywhere. I picked one up, flipping through it, only to find the words slashed through, pages missing.

And then I saw the blackboard.

A bucket and brush sat discarded below it, dirty water dripping down the surface. Every equation, every calculation, wiped away.

The walls too, soaked, scrubbed clean. The ink and chalk forcefully removed, leaving behind only the faintest, broken traces of what was there.

I stood there, staring at the destruction.

And then… I remembered.

The night before he vanished, when I saw him standing outside in the dark…

I never noticed his clothes.

I never realized they were wet.

He did this.

But why?

Why why why why why.

I walked through the wreckage, my eyes scanning the mess, trying to make sense of it all. That’s when I saw it, an object lying on the floor.

Even though it had been ripped from the wall, I still knew what it was.

A CCTV camera.

I froze. Staring.

For a full minute, I didn’t move.

Then, without thinking, I turned and hurried upstairs, straight to my room.

Mom, in her paranoia, had cameras installed all over the house for security. She thought it would make us safer.

And the only way to access the recordings was through my computer.

I sat down in front of the screen, hesitating.

My hands hovered over the keyboard, fingers trembling.

I had to know. I had to figure it out.

What happened, Dad? Where did you go?

I was hoping, praying, that I would find answers.

I pressed the power button.

The screen flickered to life, the familiar Windows startup sound ringing in my ears.

But my heartbeat was so loud, so deafening, I could barely hear it.

The screen flickered. My father appeared, stepping into the lab.

Something was wrong.

His face was blank. His movements were mechanical. He wasn’t rushing. He wasn’t panicked. He was calm. Too calm.

With slow, deliberate precision, he started tearing everything apart. He dismantled the machine piece by piece, dumping its components into a bucket of water.

Then he took a scrub brush and a bucket and started erasing the blackboard, washing the walls, removing every trace of his work.

Finally, he sat on the floor.

Tearing up the papers.

One by one.

Meticulously. Carefully.

No emotion. No hesitation. No sound except the ripping of paper.

I leaned closer to the screen, my breath shallow. Then, something shifted.

He stopped.

Slowly, he lifted his head and turned to the camera.

My stomach dropped.

For a long moment, he just stared.

Without breaking eye contact, he walked toward it.

Closer.

Closer.

Until his face filled the screen.

He whispered.

“Joshua, I…”

He stopped.

A flicker of pain crossed his face. He shook his head.

Then he grabbed a chair, reached for the camera…

Static.

The feed went dark.

I sat there, dumbfounded. Shocked.

More and more questions flooded my mind, but I was still too afraid to click on the 9th video. The one where this all started.

So instead, I clicked on the 8th one.

The video where he finished the machine.

I still remembered that day. How excited he was when he came out of the lab. How, at dinner, he wouldn’t stop talking about it. About the possibilities. The discoveries. What it could all mean.

I had just tuned him out. Mom, as always, humored him, entertained him.

I clicked play. The video loaded.

There he was, checking everything, adjusting dials, pacing excitedly.

Then, the machine turned on.

A humming sound, soft but constant.

Dad’s face lit up.

But it wasn’t just a smile.

It was a grin.

Something about it made me uneasy.

A strange, creeping feeling crawled under my skin as I watched.

I never thought I would feel jealous over something as stupid as a machine.

But in that moment, watching the way he looked at it, I realized…

He had never looked at me that way.

The video ended after a while, cutting off when Dad left the garage. And I was left sitting there.

Feeling bitter. Disappointed.

A tinge of anger swirling inside me, dragging me down like an anchor.

With a sigh, I finally clicked on the 9th video.

I watched.

From the start, it was just him, entering the garage, checking his work. Every step, methodical. Focused.

Then, he pulled the machine to the center of the room.

And turned it on.

For a while, nothing happened.

I could see the frustration building on his face.

The machine wasn’t working.

He glanced back at his calculations, muttering to himself, adjusting the knobs, tweaking the settings.

The only sounds from the feed were the steady humming of the machine and the soft tapping of his feet as he paced back and forth.

And then…

A sound.

A ring.

It was strange. Unlike anything I had ever heard.

The best way I can describe it? An echoing sound.

Dad’s expression changed instantly. A rush of happiness. Relief.

He kept adjusting the knobs, tinkering, his excitement growing as the echoing sound became louder.

I didn’t have to turn up the volume, I could hear it perfectly.

And yet, the more I listened, the more it felt wrong.

It made me sick.

The sound crawled into my skull, like something pressing down on my brain.

I wanted to turn it off, my hand reaching for the volume button.

But I couldn’t.

I needed to understand.

I don’t know how Dad could stand it. He was still focused on the machine, completely engrossed.

Then,

Silence.

A deafening, unnatural silence.

Then Dad clutched his head.

And screamed.

My screen glitched.

And suddenly,

My vision went black.

A rush of voices, hundreds, thousands, all speaking at once, overlapping, cascading into my ears like an avalanche.

It was too much.

It hurt.

It felt like my head was being scooped out with a spoon.

And then, within the chaos, one voice cut through the noise.

Deep. Powerful. A voice that seemed to shake reality itself.

"Be quiet."

Then I saw. Flashes of people. Our people. Worshipping the sun. Kneeling before it, arms raised in devotion. Then, the people disappeared and only the sun remained.

And I felt it. It was looking at me. Even though I had no eyes to see it, I knew. It was watching.

A shadow flicker making me turn, I saw him. Dad.

Standing beneath the sun, his face twisted into a grotesque grin. A grin so wide it looked like his face was splitting apart. He was staring directly at the sun.

His eyes bleeding. And he was screaming. A loud, screeching wail.

Suddenly, the sound multiplied. Other voices joined in. Shadows gathered.

My vision shifted next. I was no longer looking at him.

I was looking at the sun. Directly at it. My eyes wide open.

The ringing sound from earlier blasted into my ears at full force.

I couldn't move. I couldn't blink.

But a voice snapped me out of it.

"Joshua!"

A voice. My mother’s voice. A jolt of force ripped me back to the real world. I gasped, my body shaking violently. Arms were wrapped around me, Mom. Aunt Janice.

I was screaming. And I hadn’t even realized it. The sound slowly died in my throat, my voice hoarse, my throat burning. Mom grabbed my face, tilting it toward her.

Tears streamed down her cheeks. She stared into my eyes. she hugged me. Tight. I could barely move. My throat hurt too much to speak.

Aunt Janice called for Uncle. I barely registered his voice. He was saying something about calling EMS.

I watched him rush out of the room after aunt screamed at him to get water.

To this day, I still don’t know what happened. I don’t know where my father is and when I finally worked up the courage to watch that video again…

There was nothing.

No ringing.

No sound from the machine.

Just my father.

The steady hum.

Then his screams.

Just the moment he collapsed.

No matter how many times I replayed it, that’s all that was left.

The days passed, and life went on for me and Mom, but this time with more company than we had in years. My cousin made sure to drag me out more, and my aunt spent more time with Mom than ever.

But now… Now, whenever I step outside…

Whenever the sunlight touches my skin and I look up the sky…

I feel something. And I don’t know why, but I smile. Even though I don’t remember doing it.

And then, one day, Mom laughed and said:

"You know, you could hurt your eyes staring at that bright yellow lightbulb in the sky like that."

She chuckled. And I did too. But I don’t remember when I started looking and deep down, I was shaking.

I just don’t know if I should be afraid or if I’m waiting for [something.](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuietCornerTales/)
