I work nights as a security officer at a Level II trauma hospital in Texas. It’s my second job. If you’ve ever worked nights in a hospital, you already know—this is when the worst things happen. Shootings. Drunk drivers. People dying suddenly and loudly.

But none of that prepared me for what happened last week.

Our hospital has a separate behavioral health building across the street. If a patient needs to be escorted there, we don’t take them outside—we go through an underground tunnel from the basement. The tunnel is long, concrete, and barely wide enough for a wheelchair. There’s no radio signal down there, and the lights are motion-activated. They turn on above you, then shut off behind you as you move forward.

It feels like walking into a mouth.

Around 2 a.m., the ER called for a security escort. The patient was an elderly woman—early seventies—already in a wheelchair. Her name was Kayla. She didn’t look at me so much as through me. Just stared, unblinking.

The tech watching her handed me the paperwork. Kayla had called 911 claiming “a man dressed in black” was trying to convince her to kill herself. Police responded, found no one, and brought her in believing she was hallucinating.

Nothing unusual so far. We get this kind of stuff all the time. 

We headed down to the basement and into the tunnel. As soon as the lights flickered on, Kayla started humming.

“Tiptoe through the window…”

Over and over.

About a quarter of the way down—right by the morgue—the tech suddenly stopped and said she forgot Kayla’s belongings upstairs. Policy says patient belongings can’t be separated from them. Against my better judgment, I told her I’d wait. With Kayla as she ran and grabbed her belongings.

She disappeared back into the darkness. The lights shut off behind her one by one.

Kayla stopped humming.

Then a door slammed.

Hard.

There are only two doors down there—the entrance to behavioral health at the far end, and the morgue door right beside us. The sound came from close. Too close.

Kayla slowly turned her head toward the morgue.

Then she screamed.

“THE MAN IN BLACK WANTS ME TO KILL MYSELF.”

I nearly jumped out of my skin. When I asked her what she meant, she raised her arm and pointed at the morgue door.

It was unlocked.

It should not have been.

I told her I’d lock it to make her feel safer. She nodded slowly… and smiled.

As I walked closer, I heard movement inside. Metal scraping. Something heavy shifting.

I drew my taser and opened the door.

Cold air hit me like a punch. Fog filled my vision.

No one inside.

When I turned back, Kayla was smiling wider than before.

“He chooses you now,” she said.

Her voice sounded… wrong. Like it wasn’t meant for human ears.

The tech came back just then, and I told her to watch Kayla while I checked inside the morgue.

Everything looked normal—until something fell behind me.

One of the freezer compartments—the broken ones—was cracked open.

I yelled for whoever was inside to come out.

The door opened slowly.

A leg emerged.

Then a man.

He was at least a foot taller than me. Maybe more. Extremely thin. Pale. Bloodshot eyes. He wore a black suit that looked old and torn, like it had been buried. His smile stretched too far, like his face didn’t quite fit it.

Kayla started laughing from the hallway. Loud. Uncontrollable. The kind of laughter you hear in psych wards.

The man stepped toward me.

I fired my taser.

Nothing.

Fired again.

Nothing.

He looked down, pulled the prongs out of his chest like lint, and dropped them on the floor.

I ran. Locked the door. Got everyone out.

Police responded. My supervisor came too.

When we went back, the man was still there. Still smiling.

He didn’t resist arrest. Didn’t move. Didn’t speak. Just stared at me the entire time.

As they walked him past me, he leaned close and whispered:

“You’re next.”

That was a week ago.

He made bail.

And now I feel like I’m being followed. Not constantly—just enough to notice. Footsteps that stop when I turn around. Reflections that don’t quite match.

Last night, I caught myself humming.

If anything else happens, I’ll update.
I just needed someone to know.

UPDATE: Something from the hospital is inside my house

I didn’t plan on posting again so soon.

After I made my first post, a few people suggested stress, sleep deprivation, or trauma response. I wanted to believe that. I needed to. I took a couple nights off work, stayed home, tried to reset.

That’s when things got worse.

The first night after posting, I woke up at exactly 2:17 a.m.

I don’t know why that time matters, but it’s burned into my head.

My bedroom was silent—too silent. No AC hum. No distant traffic. Just that heavy, padded quiet you get right before something bad happens. I lay there staring at the ceiling when I realized I could hear breathing.

Not mine.

It was coming from the hallway outside my bedroom.

Slow. Steady. Like someone standing still, breathing through their nose.

I didn’t move. I didn’t grab my phone. I just listened.

After maybe thirty seconds, the breathing stopped.

Then I heard footsteps moving away—slow, deliberate—down the hall toward the living room.

I jumped up, turned on the lights, cleared the house like I’d been trained. Every door locked. Every window sealed. No signs of forced entry.

Nothing.

The next morning, I found mud on my kitchen floor.

I live alone. I hadn’t gone outside since the night before.

The second night, I dreamed of the tunnel.

I was walking through it again. Lights snapping on and off. Only this time, Kayla wasn’t in the wheelchair.

She was standing.

Smiling.

Pointing past me.

I woke up mid-scream, heart pounding—and realized I was humming.

“Tiptoe through the window…”

I don’t remember learning the words.

Yesterday, I called the police department to ask about the man. Off the record. Just to ease my mind.

They told me something that made my stomach drop.

When they ran his prints, nothing came back. No record. No ID. No history. They assumed he was transient or undocumented.

Here’s the part they didn’t put in the report.

When they tried to photograph him during booking, every picture came out blurred.

Every single one.

Like the camera couldn’t focus on him.

Last night, I finally saw him again.

I was brushing my teeth, staring at myself in the mirror, trying to convince myself I wasn’t losing it.

Then I noticed something behind me.

Not a reflection.

A shape.

Tall. Thin. Standing in the dark hallway behind my bathroom door.

He didn’t move. Didn’t smile.

He just stood there.

Watching.

I turned around.

Nothing.

But when I looked back at the mirror, written in the steam on the glass were three words, scratched deep enough to leave marks:

YOU SAID YES

I don’t know what that means.

I don’t know when I said it.

All I know is I can hear footsteps again as I type this—and this time, they aren’t stopping when I turn around.

If I don’t update again, and someone finds this account later, please remember one thing:

The man in black doesn’t make you do anything.

He just waits until you agree.

th him…

Don’t ask what he wants.

Because eventually, you stop saying no.

I won’t be posting again.
There’s nothing left to update.

And someone’s humming in the hallway.

FINAL UPDATE: I Was Wrong About When It Started

I thought this story began in the tunnel.

I don’t think that anymore.

The footsteps stopped three nights ago.

At first, I felt relief. I slept through 2:17. No humming. No hallway light mysteriously on. I woke up calm—clearheaded in a way I hadn’t been since before the morgue.

That should have scared me.

On the second quiet night, I noticed my phone alarm didn’t go off. When I checked it, the alarm had been turned off manually.

I don’t remember doing that.

Yesterday at work, my sergeant pulled me aside. He asked if I’d been down in the basement recently outside of my scheduled rounds. He said someone had been accessing the tunnel late at night using my badge.

I laughed. Told him that was impossible.

He didn’t laugh back.

According to the logs, my badge has been used every night this week at 2:16 a.m.

I was home. Asleep.

They showed me the footage.

The camera in the tunnel doesn’t record well—low light, bad angles—but you can still see movement. A tall shape passing through pools of light. Long strides. Familiar posture.

My posture.

The face never shows.

I went home early.

When I got there, the front door was locked. Chain on. Deadbolt set.

From the inside.

That’s when I smelled it.

Cold air. Sterile. That sharp, metallic scent you only notice after you’ve spent time around the dead.

The morgue smell.

It was strongest in my bathroom.

The mirror was fogged, even though the shower hadn’t been used. Written in the steam—this time carved deep enough to crack the glass—were the words:

YOU’RE DOING SO WELL

Underneath it, smaller:

HE NEVER HAD TO ASK YOU

I stood there longer than I should have, staring at my reflection.

It blinked a half-second late.

I heard humming behind me.

Not from the hallway.

From my own throat.

I don’t know how long I stood there. When I finally checked the time, it was 2:17 a.m.

I didn’t remember going to sleep.

I don’t remember standing up.

I just know that somewhere between the tunnel and now, I stopped waiting for him to follow me.

Tonight is my last shift at the hospital. I put in my notice this morning. No two weeks. No explanation.

Before I left, I checked the behavioral health records one last time.

Kayla was readmitted last night.

Different hospital. Different county.

Same complaint.

She told police the man in black had stopped bothering her.

She said he’d found someone else.

If anyone finds this account later and wonders why there were no more updates, here’s the truth:

I don’t think the man in black follows people.

I think he practices them.

And tonight, when the humming starts again, I’m afraid I won’t be able to tell where it’s coming from.

Because it already sounds like me.

UPDATE (6 months later):

I don’t remember deciding to come back here, but this account was still logged in when I opened my laptop tonight, and that feels important. I don’t work security anymore—I don’t work at all—but I still wake up every night at 2:17, only now there are no footsteps, no humming, no shadows, just a feeling like something has already finished checking the rooms. I moved twice, changed my phone number, stopped telling people where I lived, and it didn’t matter. Last week, a hospital two counties over reported an elderly woman who called 911 claiming a man in black was asking her to kill herself; when I saw the bodycam clip circulating internally, I realized with a cold certainty that the voice calmly speaking to her from off-camera was mine. I don’t remember being there. I don’t remember leaving. But sometimes I catch my reflection practicing a smile I haven’t made yet, and tonight the hallway light turned on by itself for the first time in months, which I think means I’m being needed again.
