I’ve seen some things, from zombies coming back from the grave, to people disappearing without a trace. This town I’ve been investigating recently has some weird shit going on in it, and I set out to catalog it and bring it to light after encountering the strange happenings of this town on a routine missing person case that the cops had turned down. I’m a private investigator, and my latest case has led me to a town that won’t appear on any maps or a GPS, and for all intents and purposes, shouldn’t exist.

When I arrived here I sought help looking for the missing girl, who’s name I will not go into due to privacy reasons, and was met with a single lead on her. The family who tasked me with finding her was a family who used to live in the town. They were a nice family, but one who seemed to know more about the situation than they let on, and a family that seemed dysfunctional enough that my first instinct was that the daughter had simply run away to return to her childhood home. So, against my better judgment, I took the job and made my way to the town on the longest ride of my life.

I’d been on the road for a few hours, about an hour away from where the family had said the town was, when I spotted something that caused me to halt and pull over. A car was parked on the side of the road with the doors open and a trail of blood leading into the woods, but this wasn’t the car that had the missing girl in it (I double checked), this was a random person who, if not for the blood, I would have assumed was camping or fishing somewhere. Now, some readers who are more familiar with horror movies than I might have booked it out of there and never looked back, but my sense of curiosity and hope to help whoever owned the car overtook me, causing me to leave my car and go into the woods.

The first thing that I noticed was the carvings. On each tree closest to the blood trail, there was a certain type of carving on it, which immediately made me think this was the work of some crazy cult, almost causing me to turn back there, but I pressed on into the woods after loading my pistol. The carvings continued for almost a mile into the woods before the blood trail tapered off, and in the moment, it did not strike me weird at all that a person could have enough blood to leak that long of a trail, or that the woods had suddenly gone quiet as I reached the end of the trail.

I heard screaming coming from a few hundred feet ahead, causing me to draw my pistol and run towards the noise, stumbling upon a horrific scene. Entrails were strewn between the trees and a woman’s head sat on top of her body, screaming and wailing for help, as if her head was still attached to her body, and in the middle of it all, I saw a well dressed man. That’s the best way I can describe him, as it was hard to focus on his face and see details, I knew he had a face, as I could see it, but when I tried to see the details my gaze would just slip away to something else. The only other thing of note was how pristine his clothing was despite being in the center of a massacre, with only his previously white gloves covered in blood.

“Who the fuck are you?” I shouted out, aiming my gun at him and preparing myself to take another life, only receiving a chuckle from the man.

“Are you Miss Kimbers?” the man responded, causing me to stop. How did this murderer know my name? A million thoughts raced through my head as my hands began to shake, causing me to lose grip of my gun, and in an instant it was gone before it hit the ground

This was enough for me to turn around and start running, hearing only the cackling of the man behind me as if he was only a few feet away, and he might have, I didn’t stop to check. I shot out of the woods and into my car, locking the doors and turning on the car, ready to drive away, when I saw something in the passenger's seat. A crimson envelope, addressed to me with the return address only listed as “The Mayor’s House”. This didn’t stop me from turning right around and driving away, back to where I came from, in order to collect my thoughts.

Hours later, I pulled into my garage and took the letter inside to read it. The letter was written in red ink (I hoped it wasn’t blood) and used my full name, causing me to shudder.

*Dear Francine Adeline Kimbers,*

*It was lovely meeting you for the first time, although it won’t be the last time. You ran away before I could welcome you to our lovely town, though I could understand as most outsiders don’t understand our culture and are afraid of it, rest assured, the woman is fine and in my care, I simply was trying to help her recover from a hiking incident.*

*You are important to us for reasons you don’t know yet, and when you return to our town, you will be welcomed with open arms. If you want to know more about the girl you are looking for, search only for the one who went missing before her, and don’t give up. You are more capable than you know, and only in completing your search will you realize it.*

*Best regards,*

*The Mayor*

I closed the envelope and sat in awe, feeling a rush of emotions. The only clear thing in my mind was that I had to go back, and this “Mayor” was luring me in. I could have turned back then, but instead I took the bait and prepared for my second journey to [Suncreek Colorado](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ec2fzw/the_zombie_apocalypse_comes_every_night_in/).
