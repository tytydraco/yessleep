I want to feel something again.

The trees are bare, I watch them from my window. Their limbs dance in the wind, limbs too thin, like the arms of dying men, like the elbows of the sick. Too many limbs, dancing their sickly dance, painting me with their moving pattern. I have become a canvas.

I cough into my arm. It’s that time of year again, nearly winter, and many of us are coughing. A couple walks by hand in hand, and for a moment they are on my chest, because the sun is low. Their shadows bleed onto me and for a moment they are walking hand in hand across the street and in that same moment they are walking hand in hand upon my chest and on my wall. The man lets go of her hand and coughs into his fist. Out of sight now. I envy the couple. I want to be in love. I want to know that feeling, any feeling. O, but I do know one feeling. It’s the only feeling I can recall, because it’s the last feeling I ever felt. It lives in my head like a memory, and when I want to, I can conjure it up like the spirit of a dead horse. Sometimes I do just that, just to feel one thing. Anything.

Fear. Suffocating fear. I look for it now and bring it to the surface. My heart matches the speed of its gallop. I stagger and stumble and fall backwards to the floor and I hug my knees and shake. I make a sound, an unconscious sound, a trembling monotone note, the hum of the damned. I’m transported back through time and suddenly I’m on that dirt road in Nowhere, North America.

My ride is now a cloud of dust on the horizon. Goodbye joy. Goodbye another life. Goodbye to so many things, all of them existing in that cloud of dust like an unreachable galaxy. It’s dusk, the sun just a red streak below a purple sky. Ahead of me is a house, a quiet, comfy home. The lights are on and there’s an ax lodged deep into a stump of wood beside a woodpile. It’s my parents’ house. I know it well. I’ve contributed to that woodpile. I bet that the bottom of the stack could have been mine. The crickets own the night, they play the same song on their endless arena tour. It’s a fan favourite.

I’ll admit that growing up in the bucolic countryside had its luxuries. The clean air, the smell of earth, the sights. Each window was really a painting, and the painting moved when I moved. The people were kind and neighbourly. It was quiet and peaceful and perfect. Everything a teenager didn’t want. I left home early, only sixteen years old. My thumb took me all the way from Nowhere, North America to Everywhere, Earth. I was a ramblin’ man, a hobo king, a rebel and a bum. I got into drugs, fights, bad situations, good situations, all kinds of situations. My life was saturated and beautiful. I was a walking outlaw, I’ve heard songs about me. I left that peaceful, comfy home and never looked back. I chose to live rough, in the weeds.

I got a phone call one day. I’m not sure how they got my number, but my father called me up. I hadn’t spoken to my parents in several years, I had almost forgotten that I *had* parents. Lies. My father’s voice then, and I was telling Janet to shush, but she was naked and tugging on my sleeve. I told her to shush, but she wouldn’t. I put a finger in my ear and listened to my father. He sounded sick. He was sick. He begged me to come home.

All the way from Everywhere, Earth to Nowhere, North America. It took weeks and a handjob to get there, but I finally did. I arrived. I thanked the driver, Tommy was his name, and tapped the hood of the car. He drove off, and I’m there again now, since I conjured up my fear. Tommy was a dust cloud on the horizon. The sky was a deep purple and there were lights on in the house. But I had lied. There was no ax lodged deep into the stump by the woodpile. That was wishful thinking. Goodbye ax. Goodbye woodpile.

I walked up the steps feeling a little uneasy. I attributed the feeling to not being in that place since I was a teenager. I threw that life away, I didn’t want it. But my father was dying. Brain cancer. A baseball sized tumor, he said. One would think you’d be able to see it through the skull. I spoke with my mother since his summoning call, and she had said that it affected his behaviour. It put pressure on the part of his mind where feelings reside. He’d cry for no reason at all. He’d laugh like a child at a fly on the wall. He was a carousel of painted horses. The horses went by these names: Anger, Suffering, Pleasure, Malcontent, Melancholy, Indignation, Repulsion, Shame, and Fear. What I would do to ride those horses now. Only one is available to me. I’m saddled in, giddyup.

Before knocking I glanced to the side, towards the lawn and the woodpile and the lonely stump. It wasn’t fair for them to bring me back there. It wasn’t fair that my father was dying. It wasn’t fair that I’d have to give up my life to take care of my mother.

I jumped off the horse. I unhugged my knees and let my note drop. I sat on the floor, in a shaft of light. The wall behind me was a canvas and in it my father danced. His frail, sickly limbs waved back and forth, his knobby elbows bent and twisted. In his bony hands he held an ax. It came up and down. Rain, like blood, began to tap on my windows, and it painted the scene with gore.

I wish I could feel anything. There is something in my brain that’s suppressing it all. The blunt end of an ax. There’s a scar above my eye, it’s where my fear resides. My painted horse. It beckons to me, and I climb aboard. I hug my knees and begin my hum. I tremble. The crickets are an almighty orchestra. I knock on the door, the door back home, the door to coziness and comfort. I wait. Goodbye laughter. Goodbye sweet bliss. Goodbye, mom. Goodbye, dad. No one answers. I let myself in. It’s not uncommon in the country to leave the doors unlocked. There’s a trust involved. I let myself in, and I’m still there. I can never get out. The wall is a canvas of abstract art. It’s smeared red in a complex pattern, the paint still wet. The floor is where to dip your brush.

My father greeted me with a half-smile. One side of his face remained in a palsy frown, but the other side of his face was so alive and exuberant. He must have been very happy to see me because he practically erupted with lunatic joy. Goodbye love. Goodbye trust.

His arms were as thin as my thumbs. They were long and skeletal. Weak. His legs were unstable stilts, shaking under his weight. He held his arms up above his head, and in his hands, an ax. My mother lay at his feet, an open sack of spilled tomatoes, her eyes like pits, dead and glaring, admiring the art on the walls. Goodbye faith. Goodbye sweet lullaby.

I turned around and stared out at the world through the still open door. A dirt road in the bucolic country side. Nowhere, North America. Home. No more. The crickets hit a crescendo, it was all I could hear. And then I turned back to the horror I faced, and my father was right before me, exalted, insane, a man possessed. His feeble arms had wondrous strength, for he brought the ax down, blunt end first, and it got me right above the eye. Goodbye feelings.

I did not fall unconscious. My vision blurred, and my right eye watched through a red veil. The artist came in for another stroke but I knocked him aside. I wanted to scream because the ride was out of control, the carousel was spinning too fast. The family I left. The family I always knew was there if and when I needed them. The family I would have returned to eventually. I swear I saw someone else in the house. The puppeteer. In the shadows of the laundry room someone stood there smiling at me, but my vision was blurred and it might have only been a hanging shirt. I turned back to my father who was still within the grips of his frenzy. He wasn’t really my father then, he was a tumor. My father was at its mercy, and it did with him what it willed. His limbs danced above his head and I calmly plucked the ax from his broken looking fingers. He was agitated and scratched at me. He called me a whore. My father.

I walked through the front door and gently closed it behind me. My father did not follow. I descended the stairs of my childhood and in the purple night I swung that bloody ax into the stump where it belonged. I sat down in the grass, a front row ticket to the cricket show, and I hugged my knees and joined their song. The song was called The Hum of the Damned. It was a hit.

I got off the horse. I don’t know why I put myself through that sometimes, but I can’t go too long in this apathy. Even fear is better than nothing at all. It was all stolen from me.

The sun is down, my wall is bare. I am bare. Maybe tomorrow there will be more dancing, or couples coughing. Maybe tomorrow I’ll envy the dog who sticks his curious muzzle in the rat infested drainage pipe. Maybe tomorrow I’ll go for another ride. For now, I’ll sleep.

And in my dreams, I’ll feel.
