Hi, my family is being victim of some kind of curse or whatever, any help is appreciated.

It's been a few weeks since three people in the family disappeared, in fact two people disappeared, the other died. The two relatives who disappeared were my maternal cousins, Lucas and Ariana, and the one who died was my paternal aunt, Katia.
Anyway, I'm not going to beat around the bush too much, I miss them, but that's not the focus. My mother, my father, my brother and I live in my house. By the way, my name is Lúcia. We have a huge rectangular painting on one of the walls in the dining room, which is the room in the house where a lot of family members come for lunch on the weekends, on those typical family lunch days, you know? This painting is a photo of fifty people in my family, in reality there are no longer fifty, there are 47.
And yes, the people who are no longer in the frame were the same ones who disappeared/died, but not because we took three other new photos without them, obviously not. They simply disappeared from the picture five days before anything happened to them. I hadn't noticed the first two people, but when Aunt Katia was no longer in the photo I thought it was strange. I went back the day we took the photo to remember if it was really there, and it was.
I told my parents, who told the rest of the family. Yesterday everyone came here, but there was no happy lunch, just fear. We met to understand the entire situation, but we had no concrete conclusions. At the end of the day everyone left and asked to notify them if someone disappeared from the picture. I hope not.

Robert, my mother's nephew, is no longer in the picture. My uncle Herry was holding him; now, he has simply disappeared and Herry has his arms lowered, as if Robert had never been there. My aunt is desperate, she couldn't believe it when we called her and came here to see for herself. I could feel the pain she felt when she looked at the painting looking for her son; the sparkle in her eyes disappeared. He returned home and is taking great care of my cousin. I sincerely hope nothing happens to him.

I really didn't want to be saying this, I didn't want to have to report this again. Robert, my 8 month old cousin, died. He was such a smiling boy, so naughty, so young. He died choking on his own swallow. We received the news a short time ago.

Someone disappears from the picture and five days later disappears or dies. But the time before someone disappears from the photo is indeterminate, which makes everyone feel like they're walking on eggshells every day. I looked in several places about people who disappear in a photo, but I didn't find anything verifiable, it's just that it's the kind of thing that happens in urban legends. I don't know why this is happening. Why us? I've never seen anything like this happen to anyone. Are we the first victims? Damn, I just want this to end.

I miss you, mom. I tried to burn that painting, but they stopped me; They said it was the only way to know who will be next, but I can't bear not meeting you there, or here.
My mother loved to dance. We have an empty room with a mirror covering the entire wall just for her. Whenever something happened that made her sad, happy, angry... she was there dancing, and that's what she was doing every day since she disappeared into the photograph. On the last day she was in the room again, she asked that no one stay in the room with her, she wanted to dance alone, for the last time. I was in my room praying that nothing would happen to her, meanwhile she was already on the floor, with a pool of blood on her head. She had slipped, missed her step, hit her forehead on the mirror and fallen.

Another person disappeared from the painting ten minutes ago, my father and brother are desperate. I always hated it when someone worried about me, but now I can't just say “it's okay!” or “I’ll take care of myself, don’t worry.” Because I know that something will happen to me, I will disappear from the world like I didn't even disappear in the photo.
I will say goodbye to the world and hello to mom.
