I don't know where to begin with this, nor how to write my experience in a way you won't think I've gone insane. I really need help and this might be the only way to truly get it.

Well... I might as well start with the moment I moved to my new house, in early December of last year, it was as idyllic as I had imagined, my grandmother knew the owner and got me a killer deal for a tiny home on the mountainside. I worked a part-time, half an hour's drive away in an office building, and I live in Colombia so picture real estate as less of a nightmare; especially with older houses like the one I had purchased with all of my savings and a loan to boot.

Now envision it, a two-story brick house; the windows and walls are framed in wood, rustic style, with walls painted white and the loveliest green pastures surrounding it, just for me and my partner to live in, one of those houses people have in fairytales, even I was surprised by how cheap it came to be.

On the first day, we arrived along with the truck and began turning the house into a home, hanging family pictures on the walls, and cleaning out the dust from the bedrooms became my mission, as my partner helped the moving crew bring in the furniture.

I was alone in the main hall of the second floor, passing the broom through the wooden floor to prepare the way for when they brought up the beds... when I saw something that didn't quite belong.

I fished it out from the rubble and dust with my fingers... it was a strand of hair: long, black and lusciously straight, flowing from my hand as a puzzle.

You may not understand why it bothered me so much, but here lies why; In Colombia, particularly in the region I was born in... naturally straight hair is a rarety. Furthermore, the previous owner of the house was an old, bald man who, as far as I knew didn't have a daughter or any family for that matter.

After a few hours, I simply forgot about the matter... I wish I hadn't.

By the time dusk came, everything was in its proper place, the house, illuminated with a yellow hue of the light coming from inside, looked serene, welcoming and cosy as my partner and I looked at it from afar, admiring it before settling in to prepare dinner.

...That's when I saw something odd, something passing through the north-most window; a black dash that obscured the light but by a second, I blamed my eyes, a passing bird perhaps. I pointed it to him, but he simply laughed it off as I kept fussing about it, we played pranks like that to each other all the time, please don't put it against him...

By the time we went back inside, we were laughing together, this was the beginning of an exciting adventure for us both.

...Or so I believed.

A week went by and nothing huge changed, we were acclimating to the new routine and I had just finished next day's lunch for the both of us, I was standing at the kitchen counter, packing up both meals neatly when I felt... watched? no, that's not right, it wasn't passive, it felt like being chased.

I looked up, expecting to see the familiar darkness of the empty corridor... but... there it stood.

It looked like a little boy, or a least it was the size of one, its face made it look no older than 13, and its skin was white as paper and somewhat fuzzy as if it had been covered in the frost inside of a freezer, and the hair on his head was black, straight, oily and unkempt... and the strangest of details were his ears... which were elongated and pointy.

I stood there quietly looking at the diminutive creature, half-expecting him to disappear. blaming my mind, my eyes, this could not be in front of me, these things weren't real...

And then it opened its mouth slowly, intently, and when I saw its organic shark-like teeth I realised this wasn't some prank my senses were pulling on me, I had the most primal urge in my stomach to flee... that thing wasn't human. In a panic, I threw a bowl at it... but I only heard the metallic sound it made as it hit the ground.

Then... a laugh.

It sounded like an old man's, not belonging to the body I had just seen...

My partner didn't believe me, neither would I to be honest... don't take me for a fool, I'm a very rational person, I checked for gas leaks, for some sort of poisoning inside the house, but nothing came from my search... for a time I shrugged it off as a machination of my bored and tired mind...

but things kept happening.

Somedays I would wake up with my hair dread-locked together around an object taking the whole morning to get it out. This frustrated me because I thought I was doing it myself... a result of stress.... I believed.

Other days I would find a room around the house trashed, and I would clean that room only to find it in the same state but a few moments later. It's gotten worse. So there are now rooms in the house that I keep under lock and key, but nobody uses them so... why bother riding them up over and over again?

One evening, I arrived home from work... and decided to wait outside until my partner came home, too afraid to go inside... my mind was playing tricks of me, I was now certain, I didn't want to be alone in that house.

I waited there... in the darkness... thinking of the excuse I would use once he appeared and asked why I hadn't entered the house.

That's when I felt a pair of tiny hands wrap around my leg and pull on me with immense strength, the sort that I'm fairly certain a child shouldn't be able to conjure.

I felt my upper body hit the grass and my hands instinctively tried to prevent me from getting dragged, to no avail, I was damaging my nails as the tiny creature snatched me further and further from the house with the same ease one would move a trash bag.

I could see its black hair, its long ears, feel the bony fingers that would better suit an elderly man grip my leg with crushing strength... I was petrified with fear.... and then I finally pulled myself together enough to scream.

I had never screamed for my life before, and it's a feeling I can't quite put into words, the air leaving my lungs as I'm certain is the only thing I can possibly do... as my blood feels cold as iron in my veins.

And finally, after I was a fair distance away from the house, a glimmer of hope, a flashlight approaching...

A neighbour was walking his dog nearby and when the sound of the footsteps approached, the creature ran away with that same maniacal laughter... as if, to it, this was some sort of sick game that gave it pleasure.

I cried there for a moment, convinced I had gone mad... before the neighbour, an old man with kind eyes, helped me to my feet. And told me something that shook me to my very core.

"What was that thing? was it a skunk or something like that? it looked enormous!"

I thanked him and he accompanied me home... I felt the tiniest relief from what he said... 

No, I'm not crazy.

...It's real...

Whatever that hellish thing is, it's not a machination of my mind.

Someone else saw it, it must be!

I'm not mad, that's why I'm writing this.

Someone out there must have experience with creatures like this one, that hunt my life, I'm willing to try anything, please, people out there... 

Help me defeat the duende that hunts my home.
