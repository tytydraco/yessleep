I’m not sure where else to turn, so I’m posting this here. Maybe someone can help me make sense of what’s happening, or at least tell me I’m not losing my mind. It all started about a month ago, and since then, things have only gotten worse.

I live in a small, old house on the outskirts of town. It’s nothing fancy, just a cozy place I inherited from my grandparents. I’ve always felt safe here, surrounded by memories of family gatherings and warm summer nights. But lately, that sense of safety has been slipping away, replaced by a creeping dread I can’t shake.

The First Signs
It began with the noises. At first, it was just faint whispers in the dead of night, like the wind rustling through the trees. I told myself it was nothing, probably just the house settling or my imagination playing tricks. But the whispers grew louder, more insistent, as if they were trying to tell me something. I’d lie in bed, straining to make out the words, but they were always just out of reach—a maddening murmur that kept me awake for hours.

Then, things started moving on their own. I’d leave a book on the coffee table, only to find it on the kitchen counter the next morning. My keys would disappear from their usual spot by the door and turn up in the bathroom sink. I thought maybe I was being forgetful, but deep down, I knew something was off. It was as if the house itself was shifting, playing some twisted game with me.

The Feeling of Being Watched
I tried to ignore it, to go about my daily routine as if everything was normal. But the feeling of being watched was inescapable. I’d catch glimpses of shadows darting in the corners of my vision, always gone when I turned to look. The air felt heavy, charged with an unseen presence that made my skin crawl.

Desperate for answers, I set up a camera in the living room, hoping to catch whatever was causing these disturbances. For days, nothing happened. The footage showed only the quiet, empty room, bathed in the soft glow of the lamp I left on. But then, one night, I saw it.

The Figure
I was reviewing the footage from the previous evening when a flicker of movement caught my eye. At first, it was just a blur, a smudge on the screen that could have been a glitch. But as I watched, the blur coalesced into a shape—a figure, translucent and wavering, standing in the center of the room. It was humanoid, but its features were indistinct, like a reflection in a rippling pond. The figure seemed to be looking directly at the camera, its head tilted as if in curiosity.

My heart pounded as I stared at the screen, unable to tear my eyes away. The figure lingered for a few seconds before dissolving back into the shadows, leaving the room empty once more. I replayed the footage over and over, trying to convince myself it was a trick of the light or a fault in the camera. But the more I watched, the more certain I became: something was in my house, something not of this world.

Digging into the Past
I decided to dig deeper, to see if there was any history of strange occurrences in the house. My grandparents had never mentioned anything unusual, but maybe there was something they didn’t know. I spent hours at the local library, poring over old newspapers and town records. What I found chilled me to the bone.

Decades ago, before my grandparents bought the house, it had been the site of a tragic accident. 
A young woman had lived there alone, and one winter night, she vanished without a trace. Search parties combed the area, but no sign of her was ever found. 

The case went cold, and the house sat empty for years until my grandparents moved in.

The article included a grainy photograph of the woman, and as I looked at it, a shiver ran down my spine. There was something familiar about her, something I couldn’t quite place. Then it hit me the figure in the camera footage. The shape, the posture it was her.

A Plea from Beyond

That night, I lay in bed, the weight of this revelation pressing down on me. If the spirit of this woman was haunting my house, what did she want? Was she trying to communicate, to tell me something about her disappearance? Or was there something more sinister at play?

The whispers returned, louder than ever, and this time, I could almost make out the words. “Find me,” they seemed to say, over and over, a desperate plea from beyond the grave. I squeezed my eyes shut, willing the voices to stop, but they only grew more insistent.

Suddenly, a cold hand gripped my ankle, yanking me down the bed with terrifying force. I screamed, thrashing against the unseen assailant, but my limbs felt heavy, as if bound by invisible chains. 

The room spun, and a wave of nausea washed over me as the whispers crescendoed into a deafening roar.

Just as quickly as it began, the assault ceased. I was alone again, trembling in the darkness, my heart racing. The air was still, the whispers gone, but the sense of dread lingered, thicker than ever.

Time Is Running Out

I knew then that I couldn’t ignore this any longer. Whatever was in my house, it was growing stronger, more aggressive. I had to find out what happened to that woman, to uncover the truth behind her disappearance. Maybe then, I could put her spirit to rest and reclaim my home.

But as I sit here typing this, I can’t shake the feeling that I’m being watched. The shadows in the corners of the room seem to pulse and shift, and the whispers have started again, soft but persistent. “Find me,” they say, “before it’s too late.”

I’m not sure what that means, but I fear that time is running out. For both of us.

What do you think? Has anyone experienced anything like this? I need advice, or at least some reassurance that I’m not alone in this nightmare.
