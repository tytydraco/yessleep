Hi there! Welcome to The D.A.Y.C.A.R.E.! We are so happy you accepted the position of Lead Teacher! We are really looking forward to your first day. It has been a rough few months since our last Lead Teacher….well…. Moved on. I would love to tell you more about our facility, however we require that information be disclosed during your orientation. The children we care for are quite unique. But! Since you have already signed the nondisclosure form, it is imperative we complete orientation and get the waiver, and the no-responsibility injury severance package signed as well so we can proceed with the full hiring process! So let us get you into orientation! How does this coming Monday the 18th work for you? I hope it works well. There are some rules that we will explain when you arrive but it is absolutely imperative that you memorize these simple and basic rules and follow them exactly upon your first day. So, here they are!  
  
1. I will be waiting in front of the main door. It will be firmly shut behind me. Calmly park and walk to the main door. If I am not in front of the firmly closed door, drive away immediately. Get out of sight of the building and call the emergency number listed at the top of this page. Do not park. Do not stop driving. They will know what to do.  
  
2. Upon entering, we have a very sensitive child who will be watching. Wave to her and smile to show you are not a threat. Keep waving and smiling until she walks back into her room. You must do this each day you arrive.  
  
3. Do not under any circumstances explore the facility alone without (at the very least!) another lead teacher. I would prefer you only venture into the facility with a long term Handler rather than a teacher. Safety precaution, of course, since you are new.  
  
4. You will hear very strange noises. Pretend they do not exist and try very hard not to jump and absolutely do not scream.  
  
5. We have a tiny escape artist who may greet you upon arrival. She is mostly friendly and not really…. problematic so we allow her to go on her adventures as she wishes. If you see her, you may generally engage her however you would like. However, she is currently teething. DO NOT let her bite you. If she does, run for the office immediately, hopefully you make it in time for the… medicine you will need.  
  
6. It is not a far walk to the office but just to be safe, ignore any children who seem to be peeking around door frames just far enough away to be vague. Do not encourage her. She gets so much worse if she gets a reaction, especially from a new…. audience.  
  
7. The lights may seem odd or make you dizzy at first. Do not say anything about it. Keep your thoughts to yourself or you could upset some of the children. Actually, this rule should be a general warning to keep your thoughts and questions to yourself until you have completed orientation.  
  
8. Keep a serene smile upon your face and your voice quiet and light while in the hallways. Once we reach the office and the door is shut you may relax and speak freely.  
  
That is it! Follow these simple rules upon arrival and things should go quite well for your first day! I know you are probably confused at the rules but I assure you, things will be thoroughly explained. We are all so excited to meet you! Have a wonderful weekend!
