Hello fellow Redditors,

Long time reader, first time posting on this sub. Everyone I know knows that my favorite holiday is Halloween. Or it was, and if you’d been through what I have, you’d hate it, too. While you see your date as June 30th, for me, as you may have guessed, it's October 31st. on every device, clock, and anything that shows the date, except for my phone, God knows why, it says today is October 31st. That’s how I know the actual date. 

This all started last year in October. I was looking at stuff at Spirit Halloween, and this “Countdown to Halloween” calendar, with rotating numbers, and themed like the movie “Trick or Treat” caught my eye. I thought it looked cool, so I added it to the rest of my stuff and paid. 

For a week or so, I was doing good with ensuring the number was accurate. Consequently, time moved as normal. On October 17th, I forgot to change the date when I slept that night. On what should’ve been the 18th, which my phone said it was, every other device in the house said it was the 17th. The day played out the same as the day before. I couldn’t believe it! I could change the date to whatever day I wanted, less than 99 days before Halloween (it only had two numbers).

 With my phone helping me with what the actual date was, I played around with different dates. I couldn’t go to any big holidays, seeing the farthest I could go back was July 24th. I did go back to my sister’s birthday in September once or twice, otherwise, I just played around with dates. 

I did this until Halloween arrived. I wanted Halloween to be the right day, so I set my calendar to 0. My first Halloween was normal. I took my younger siblings trick or treating, went to a party after, etc. It wasn’t until the next day, November 1st, that it became a problem. 

Unlike before, the only numbers on the device were the two zeros. since then, I’ve been going through the same day, over and over. When comparing it, I would say its closest to the movie “The Map of tiny perfect things”, because even if I stay up until midnight, which it's about to storm, no matter where I am, I’m back in my bed on the morning of October 31st. it seems to have a small radius, only going as far as 40 miles, seemingly because everything I did the first time around, the party, trick or treating, etc. happened in that radius. I feel terrible for my family, and everyone else within the 40 miles. 

You might be wondering why I took so long to get help. Well, other than being stuck in the same day, I can still keep updated on what’s going on through my phone. But, a few days ago, after getting back from the 200-something time trick or treating, there was a note attached to the calendar. Here’s what it said:

*Halloweens good and fun, 
But over and over not so much.
Find a solution before a full year has passed,
Or this problem will forever last*

This was scary on its own, but the next night, when I was at the party, someone dressed as Sam, the character from the calendar, stared at me the whole time. This hadn’t happened in any other loops.

Do any of you guys have a similar problem? I figured if anyone knew how to fix this, it would be reddits community of no-sleepers! With all the crazy experiences I’ve read on this sub, surely you guys could help me before it’s [too late?](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/14sfzs0/ive_been_stuck_in_halloween_2022_for_almost_250/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1)?
