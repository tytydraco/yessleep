All of this started 48 days ago.
I was passing a homeless man in a hurry because i was late for work.
He was a tall old man somewhere between 65 to 70 years old.
He looked like he had been homeless for sometime now.
He had a long, like really long beard that was dirty white. 
He had ripped cardboard sign. On it with messy handwriting was written 
,, Please spare some spare change ,,.
I was practically running to the door when he pulled my purse. 
I quickly turned around because i thought he was trying to steal it.
He let go of my purse then pointed at his sign.

- I don’t have cash on me right now.- that was a complete lie but like i said i was already late for work and didn’t want to get fired. I turned to the door and as i was ready to pull the door handle he pulled my purse again but this time i slapped his hand and went in to the building.
When my shift ended i went outside, he wasn’t there anymore.
I went into my car and started driving, i got a notification on my phone. It was my doorbell camera.
 As i turned to look at the road i saw him.

I slammed on my brakes as fast as i could. When i looked again there was literally nothing.
At home when i walked into the door i saw him in front of me, i screamed.
My husband came rushing in asking whats wrong.
When i looked back there was no one again.

- There was a man here i i i saw him!- i said practically screaming.
- There is no one here except me- he said weirded out.


The following 47 days were the same.
I would go to work. He would be there for a split second and he would disappear. Drive home. See him.
Come home. See him.
Even in my dreams he would be there.

I have had the same nightmare for 48 days straight. The nightmare would be of the day i first saw him.
You might think i am overdramatic, but he isn’t and doesn’t look like a normal man. His eyes are hollow and the ripped cardboard sign is poking out of his stomach. He is covered in blood. 

His long beard from dirty white turned bloody red. 
I think that i’m actually going insane.
I can’t keep going on like this.
I want to go to work without having to see his hollow eyes and his body covered in blood. I just want to be and feel normal again.

Maybe i should have just gave him the freaking money and maybe I wouldn’t have to be going through this.
My husband wants a divorce. I’m on the verge of being fired and am expecting it any second. My whole life is ruined.

My husband will get everything in the divorce and i’m probably going to end up in a mental hospital after the trial.
I’m so sad and lonely well almost lonely. At least i have the homeless old man and his hollow eyes keeping me company even if its just for a split second.
