I’d been dreaming about this moment for years—finally, a studio of my own. In 1960s Hong Kong, the streets buzzed with life, the neon lights casting everything in a strange, electric glow. Sai Wan was the perfect spot for it, too. A modest studio tucked away from the bustle, with just enough foot traffic to keep the business going. I had spent years under the thumb of an overbearing boss, saving every penny, and now, here it was: Ho’s Photography Studio.

The studio was small but neat. Downstairs was where the magic happened—the camera, the lights, the backdrops. I’d hung my best work on the walls, each framed photo a little piece of pride. The upstairs held a changing area stocked with borrowed wedding dresses and tuxedos for couples to use. It was a good idea—practical, even. Not everyone could afford to rent expensive outfits for a single photo session. That little touch had made me popular with couples, and things had been going well.

But that night, I was tired. Too tired, really. It had been one client after another, and by the time I turned the “Open” sign to “Closed,” my feet ached, and my mind buzzed with exhaustion. All I wanted was to pack up, go home, and collapse into bed.

That’s when I heard it. The soft chime of the doorbell.

I glanced up, my heart skipping a beat. A couple stood in the doorway, hand in hand, silent.

“We’re closed,” I said, forcing a polite smile despite the fatigue pressing down on me. “Come back tomorrow.”

But they didn’t leave. They just stood there, gazing at the photos on the wall, their fingers intertwined. The woman pointed at one, smiling faintly, and the man nodded. They seemed lost in their own little world, as though I wasn’t even there.

A flicker of annoyance flared in me. I walked closer, more firm this time. “I’m sorry, we’re closed for the night. Please, come back tomorrow.”

The woman turned to look at me, her eyes wide and pleading. She clasped her hands together as if begging me, while the man gave me a small, apologetic smile.

I hesitated. Something about the way they looked at me softened my resolve. They seemed... different. I wondered if maybe they were mute or hard of hearing. There was something almost childlike about their expressions.

I sighed. “Alright,” I said, relenting. “But we’ll have to be quick.”

Their faces lit up instantly, and they nodded in gratitude, bowing slightly.

I walked over to the camera setup, busying myself with adjusting the tripod and checking the lighting. I was fiddling with the focus when I turned to tell them we were ready—and that’s when I saw them. They were already sitting in front of the camera, perfectly posed, without me hearing a single step.

My heart gave a strange lurch. I blinked, trying to shake off the sudden wave of unease. They were just... quiet. That’s all. I must’ve been too tired to notice.

“Alright,” I said, clearing my throat. “Hold that pose.”

The camera clicked, the sound unnaturally loud in the quiet room. They moved gracefully between each pose, their expressions soft and peaceful, like they’d done this a thousand times before. They didn’t speak, didn’t gesture for guidance—they didn’t need it.

Something about the way they moved unsettled me. Too smooth. Too practiced.

The air grew colder. A chill crept through the room, so subtle at first that I almost didn’t notice it. But by the third or fourth shot, I could see my breath misting in front of me. I shifted, uncomfortable, rubbing my arms.

They just kept smiling.

After five or six photos, I lowered the camera, relieved. “Is there anything else?”

The woman stood, her movements slow and deliberate. She pointed to a photo on the wall—a wedding portrait I’d taken months ago, with a rose garden as the backdrop. Her eyes were soft, almost sad, as she looked at it.

I glanced at my watch. It was late. Too late. But then the man joined her, nodding eagerly, both of them gazing at me with that same pleading look.

I hesitated again, feeling the weight of their silence pressing down on me. My instinct was to refuse, to send them away. But something in their eyes... I couldn’t say no.

“Fine,” I said, with a sigh. “But we have to hurry.”

They bowed, smiling gratefully, and hurried up the stairs to the changing room. I stood there, listening, waiting for the sound of footsteps on the creaky wooden steps.

There was nothing. No sound at all.

A shiver ran down my spine. I shook it off. It was late, that’s all. My mind was playing tricks on me.

A few moments later, they returned. The man wore a black tuxedo, his face beaming with joy. The woman, now dressed in a flowing white wedding gown, looked radiant, but there was something else in her expression—a sadness that seemed too deep for words.

I set up the rose garden backdrop and started taking pictures, snapping shot after shot as they moved into each pose effortlessly. The chill in the air deepened with every click of the camera. My breath fogged up in front of me, and I could feel the cold seeping into my bones.

But the couple didn’t seem to notice. They just smiled.

By the time we were done, I was trembling—not just from the cold, but from something I couldn’t quite name. I lowered the camera and exhaled. “That’s enough for tonight,” I said, trying to sound casual. “If you want more, you’ll have to come back another day.”

The woman nodded, but her eyes lingered on the wedding dress. She touched the fabric gently, her fingers trailing over the lace as though it was something precious she didn’t want to let go of. The man, too, glanced at the dress with a soft, wistful expression before they both bowed and headed back upstairs to change.

I started preparing the invoice, my hands trembling slightly as I wrote out the details. When they returned, the man took the pen and carefully wrote down his name. I handed them the slip of paper and told them to come back in three days for the photos. They bowed one last time, and I watched as they slipped out into the night, the door chime ringing faintly behind them.

I realized then that I was holding my breath. I let it out slowly, feeling the strange tension in the air lift as the door clicked shut.

Three days later, I developed the photos. They were beautiful. The couple looked radiant, glowing with happiness. Each shot was perfect—almost too perfect. There was something unnerving about the stillness in their faces, the way they looked at each other, so full of love and... something else.

I planned to ask them if I could hang a few of the shots on the studio wall. They were perfect for my portfolio.

I stepped out for lunch, heading to a local cha chaan teng. As I sipped my milk tea, flipping through the newspaper, something caught my eye.

A photo of a couple.

My stomach dropped. It was them. The same couple.

The headline read: Tragic Accident Claims Young Couple.

I felt the blood drain from my face. My hands trembled as I read the article. They had been on their way home after the young man proposed. A car crash. Both of them died instantly.

The date of the accident was the same night they’d come to my studio.

But... they’d died hours before they walked through my door.

I pushed the tea aside, barely managing to keep myself together as I threw some money on the table and rushed back to the studio. My mind was racing, panic clawing at my chest.

I stormed into the studio and pulled out the invoice the man had signed. My hands shook as I unfolded it. The name—it was the same as in the article.

I stood there, staring at the slip of paper, my heart hammering in my chest. They were dead. They had been dead the whole time.

The photos. The studio. The silence.

My breath came in shallow gasps as I grabbed the photos from my desk. Without thinking, I rushed to the back, fumbling for a copper basin and a box of matches. My hands were trembling so badly I could barely strike the match. I watched the flames flicker and then grow as I dropped the photos into the basin.

I muttered a prayer, my voice shaking. “Please, take these photos and don’t come back.”

I grabbed a handful of joss paper and threw it into the fire, the smoke curling into the air in thin, wispy tendrils. “Please,” I whispered, “take these for your journey. Please don’t come back.”

The photos curled and blackened, disappearing into ash.

And then there was silence.

I stood there for a long time, staring into the dying embers, wondering if that would be the end of it.

Or if they would come back for their final photograph.
