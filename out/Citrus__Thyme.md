As I sit in the frail wooden chair, eyes locked upon the boy, I feel, for but a fleeting moment, that maybe there is a chance what we are doing is wrong. But, with the firm grip of Zachary's hand upon my shoulder, I remember; who am I to deny the will of God? I take a deep breath. She always appears with this scent, like citrus but with a note of something more earthy that I can’t quite place. I squeeze the hand on my shoulder.


The boy looks scared, which is disappointing. We spent the last week feeding him all the finest fruits from the orchard, stripped back his working day to nine hours, and allowed him to read for thirty minutes a day. And what for? For him to face this moment a coward? 


This is not how he was raised. I and all the other maids raised him to face this moment with courage and dignity, with respect for our traditions. The way God intends. Not with tears streaming down his face, eyes puffy and snot on his upper lip.


He takes one small, slow and laboured step after another. The other maids begin to chant slowly and quietly to themselves, sat in their wooden chairs behind us, as the men stand silently in formation along the isle, completely nude, the scarred, oddly healed, and in some cases bright red and pulsating area where their genitalia should be distracted a few of the maids and they fumbled their words. 


The boy let out a soft sob as he realised it was only a couple more steps before he would meet Her. He turned to the audience and locked eyes with me. “Mama” he mouthed, I flipped my hand up in a motion that told him to get on with it already, one final muted, yet guttural sob exited the boys agape, mucous filled maw as he stepped up to the altar. 


As a maid I am not allowed to know who She is, where She is from or really anything other than She takes one offering from each litter I and the other maids produce. Normally a strong, tall and preferably uncastrated male, however the only finite prerequisite is that they are 12 years old to the day and male. However much to God's disappointment I am the only one who has been able to successfully and continuously bear males. Each season I have been in Zachary's care, I have produced one and sent another on their way. This success rate keeps him wrapped around my finger, I worry not for food, toiletries or books to read, and I only have to tend to the crops once every fortnight. I am truly blessed by my womb, I move my hand to my stomach as I think this, it hurts to touch and I recoil slightly at my own action, hoping Zachary didn’t realise. 


As she- I would call her a woman though I can’t be certain that's what she is,- reaches down and grabs the hand of the boy with her long, tendril like fingers, he looks up at Her in disgust. I have never seen Her face, she is too tall to get a glimpse of it, and her protruding, swollen stomach distracts me. The way the skin was so tight in places that her rib cage rippled against the skin, in some places you could see the white as the skin stretched thin over bone, and in others it was red and diseased, oozing puss and blood. The stomach was of such a size that it amazed me her scrawny legs could carry such weight, they were no wider than a pencil, but too long to comprehend, sometimes it would take a full minute to observe her legs from foot to pelvis.


She bends down and speaks into his ear, all of her hands are on him, probing him, feeling him. The maids cease their silent chant and hum, as She lets out a high pitch wail that slowly grows in volume. I join the humming as she reaches the crescendo, the boy's ears are bleeding already, I knew he was weak. 


As the boy falls to his knees, trying in vain to cover his ears as all Her arms and hands and tendrils hold his arms out stretched, raising him in the air, a mock crucifixion. The life simply leaves his body and She triumphantly screeches as the husk of the boy shrivels like spoiled fruit, arms still out stretched, head leaned to the side; if he weren’t so small and pathetic he’d make a good scarecrow for the fields.


As the arms and tendrils retreat, the husk falls to the floor and She contorts her body enough to fit through the side door. 


Zachary walks confidently up to the husk, brushing his hand along the smooth genital regions of all the men as he did so, one particularly sickly looking man twitched, resulting in Zachary squeezing his groin until the man collapsed to the ground. As he retrieved the husk and held it up to the crowd, the chanting resumed. It would be another year of bountiful fruits in the orchard, another year of great prophecies being foretold to us through Zachary. 


I force a smile, though the growing pain in my stomach pulsates, it's tender to the touch and last night I found it leaking a bright, viscous green liquid that smelled faintly of citrus and thyme.
