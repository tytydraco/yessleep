Sometimes you bury pieces of your past so deep that you experience genuine shock when they're all dug back up. It's a well-known and studied phenomenon - particularly when concerning childhood trauma and I suppose some part of me *always* remembered what happened at Maplewood Springs Elementary School, but not quite enough to stop me from eagerly going back to my little town and all that comes with it. 



I had a stable job as a college professor and a half-decent life in a major city not too far from my aforementioned hometown when my dad fell ill and I took the decision to move back home temporarily to care for him. He insisted he would be fine but after Mom passed a few years back he's been on his own and if ever there was a time for me to be a good only child it was now. Naturally, I still needed money and therefore work so I went ahead and offered to help out at the elementary school I went to many years ago, and thankfully I was offered a position teaching that year's grade 5 class of students. Adapting from adult learners to this new challenge probably wasn't going to be easy, but it was a year-long assignment and really only a means of making money whilst away from my career proper. 



Barely three weeks had passed before I heard it for the first time. On a Friday afternoon, a few minutes after the 12 o'clock bell had rung out across the hallways and playgrounds, a *second* bell stole my attention away from the monotony of my fifth peanut butter and jelly sandwich of the week. It only did so for a second, though, and more out of surprise than anything else before I put it down to some malfunction and carried on chomping away. 



Making my way to the staff room to put my Tupperware back, I walked by the cafeteria and whilst peering into the glass window pane noticed young boys and girls sitting with their heads down intently scribbling onto notepads, whiteboards or simply scraps of paper. Was there a talk of some sort going on that I hadn't been told about? Either way, I noted it and told myself I'd pop in on the way back from the staff room. As soon as I walked into the aforementioned room and before I even tuned into the ongoing conversation between Mrs Caldwell and Mr Parker, the existence of something just... wrong in that room hit me with ferocity. "Justin didn't hear second bell" whispered Mr Parker before Mrs Caldwell said in an even more hushed tone "Oh his poor parents, such a tragedy". "Uhh, what are you guys talking about?" I butted in, rude and frankly uncaring. And with two softly spoken, almost apologetic sentences, all of it came back to me. 



"Didn't you go to this school?"



...



"*Don't you remember?*". 



It was as if those words provided a key to unlock a long forlorn chamber buried deep inside my mind. Because all of a sudden, I *did* remember. 



Remembered *Him*. 



You see, the second bell at lunchtime rings out every second Friday. Most of the time it serves no real purpose, has no tangible function. Besides, I suppose, the mass fear it inevitably causes as the time nears. Every year or so, though, it means that a child has been chosen. Whenever the second bell rings, every child at Maplewood Springs Elementary begins to draw the same *thing*. A stick figure with no discernible features whether by realism or design except a stream of red flowing from where its two eyes would presumably lie. The drawing never changed. Age, artistic ability, hell, emotional state - none of this played the part you might imagine in these drawings. Every blank canvas was spoiled with the exact same drawing. We called him Mister Smudge. 



As kids, we knew the bell meant the inevitability everybody feared when one of us didn't hear it. When one of us didn't draw. Sometimes they'd follow everybody else's lead and simply pretended all was well. Other times they just sat there, expressionless. Every now and then they cried and screamed till they couldn't anymore. We weren't told much as kids but figured most of the story out amongst ourselves over the years we spent at the school. Just as sure as the rising sun, the misfortunate child who couldn't hear the second bell - who couldn't draw that ever-familiar figure - vanished the same night. Always with an all-too-late drawing of Mr Smudge tucked underneath a cold pillow. 



Most times it'd be someone from a different grade who I'd only known in passing. One year it was a kid I'd hung out with a couple of times. And one time, it was me. 



Looking back at that abandoned old memory with fresh eyes and feelings hurts. It felt like a massive spotlight had been shone on me and all I remember doing was staring up at my kind old teacher beside me - looking for comfort in those sympathetic eyes - and my heart sinking when all I found within them was pity and despair. Even revisiting the memories of that day and those following it anew, much of what happened next remains a blur. Given how a fair chunk of my life practically didn't exist before coming back here, I'm not sure how much of my memory I can trust anyway. 



I remember being bundled into the back of my dad's old station wagon with him driving and my mom in the passenger seat. A large suitcase was lying across the seating beside me and they spoke in a tone quiet enough that I couldn't make anything out. Tired and confused, I closed my eyes to the sound of our struggling engine and the empty night. 



My next memory past that point - even after those of my adolescence in Maplewood Springs have dumbfoundingly returned - isn't until my 18th birthday. I've come to conclude the "lost" memories accounted for the period between the beginning of elementary school and the moment I became an adult. Although, for all the answers I have found in recent times, my whereabouts during the years I lived between the car memory and my birthday remain beyond my knowledge. 



And so - circling back from the coffers of my mind - there I stood in that staff room. Fragmented. Someone who belonged, deeply, and yet was a stranger at once. I needed to find out who I was. *Am*. What happened to me. I needed to talk to Dad. Thankfully, no child was chosen on that Friday and I managed to slip away from work a little early. I'm not quite sure what implored him to open up to me on that afternoon and not any of the countless times we'd talked and texted in my adult life (he'd visited with Mom a few times a year too), but I learned the full story that same Friday evening. 



Five years before I was born, my older sister Tabi was taken by the figure in the drawings. By Mister Smudge. My Dad wept as he explained the burden that Maplewood Springs has held for many generations. How those who came long before us thought it'd be better for Mister Smudge to be kept within our small locality, to be provided for, to be satiated. That it'd be better for the outside world this way. It was a lottery of the most dire proportions, and everybody held up their portion of the hardship if and when it came. But my parents couldn't do it twice. Tabi broke them in a way imperceptible to my pre-elementary-school mind, and so when their only remaining child was chosen they looked into the maw of all the pain the school, the town and Mister Smudge had already brought them and turned their backs to their duty. For better or worse. He explained that he didn't think it to be possible, that each and every chosen boy or girl and their families were bound to the very fabric of our town and would remain so until the town was no more, but that inexplicably they had gotten me out. We hadn't been turned around and ended up back in town like some of the other who had tried, nor had we encountered any number of other unlikely scenarios others experienced foiling our escape. We made it all the way to my Uncle's in the city, apparently, where we lived together until both of my parents had to move back to Maplewood Springs to take care of their own folks. I still have no surviving memories of my grandparents, but this place has the nasty habit of weaponising the ties that bind. That's why I'm here too, after all. 



My Dad ended his winding set of revelations with a gut punch. An extra child has been taken each year since I was supposed to be the one who vanished. My parents' choice and our escape turned the town's horrifying yet quietly accepted sick tradition into something that instead grew worse with time. Something that festered. 



And now, he'd brought me back to right that wrong. 



The burden that fell on his shoulders and his parents' before him now finds itself weighing down on me. 



Maybe it’s too late. Maybe the window for fixing this closed many years ago. *I’m just too old* is the phrase running around my head. But something within me tells me otherwise. That he still seeks me. That I can satiate him. *I can keep the outside world safe*



The next time Mister Smudge comes looking for somebody, I'll be looking for him too. 



His loose end.
