I wasn’t supposed to be out that far.

That’s the first thing I need to say, because every bad decision after that started with me thinking, It’s fine. I know these woods. I’ve hunted them on and off for years. I know the pull-offs. I know where the game trails braid together. I know which ridges get wind-swept and which pockets stay cold all day.

But my usual spot had two trucks parked at the entrance and fresh boot prints going in. I don’t “share” a section during rifle season. Not because I’m territorial—because I like going home.

So I drove deeper. Took a logging road I’d never bothered with. Parked where the service got thin. Walked until the quiet felt right.

The day started normal. The kind of normal you don’t appreciate until it’s gone.

Frost on low grass. A faint smell of sap when the sun hit the pines. My breath hanging in front of me. Squirrels making a big deal out of nothing. The occasional distant tap of a woodpecker like a metronome.

I was working along a shallow draw when I saw the first sign that something was off.

It wasn’t tracks.

It was trash.

Bright, wrong-colored trash that didn’t belong in the woods. A crushed energy drink can. A torn granola bar wrapper snagged on a branch. A strip of duct tape stuck to a leaf like someone had tried to patch something in a hurry.

At first I thought, Idiots. People do this every season. They treat the woods like a backdrop and then leave their life behind when they get bored.

Then I saw the tent.

It was tucked back in a little clearing between two leaning pines, far enough from the trail that you wouldn’t stumble into it unless you were paying attention or you were already looking for it.

The tent was half collapsed. One pole snapped. Rainfly bunched and twisted like someone had grabbed it and yanked. Sleeping bags dragged out onto the ground, unrolled and muddy, like the people inside never got the chance to pack.

And there were no people.

I stopped at the edge of the clearing and let my eyes do a slow sweep before my feet moved.

Cooler lid open, but food untouched. Camp chair tipped over, but the stove still neatly placed on a flat rock like whoever set it up cared about it being level. A lantern on its side with no shattered glass. A small fire ring with half-burned wood still stacked like it had been arranged and then abandoned mid-thought.

The whole thing looked ransacked… but not looted.

Like someone had been in a hurry. Like someone had made a mess with a purpose.

I stepped in, careful where I put my boots. I didn’t want to stomp all over whatever was left of the story here.

A phone lay near the tent door, face down, screen spider-webbed. Next to it, a small pile of stuff—keys, a lighter, a folded map. The kind of things you drop when your hands stop working the way they’re supposed to.

“Hey!” I called, loud enough that it should’ve bounced.

Nothing answered.

I moved closer and crouched near the tent. I didn’t touch anything. I just leaned in enough to see inside.

Sleeping pad still laid out. Backpack half unzipped with clothes spilling out. No blood. No obvious sign of a fight.

But the dirt at the tent mouth wasn’t right.

There were drag marks, yes—two long parallel grooves leading out toward the trees like something heavy had been pulled away.

And beside those, pressed deep into the damp soil, were hoofprints.

At first glance, they looked like deer tracks. Split hoof, teardrop shape, the usual.

Then I leaned in a little more and my stomach did that slow dip.

The hooves were wrong.

One side of the split was deeper than the other, like the animal had been walking with uneven weight. And the edges of the print weren’t clean. There were faint ridges, almost like… fingerprints, if fingerprints were crescent-shaped and belonged to something that had learned how to press down deliberately.

I told myself it was mud cracking. Or the tread of a boot overlapping. Or the imprint of a broken branch.

But my brain wouldn’t let it go.

Because right at the end of one of the tracks, like a detail someone added on purpose, there was a thin line dragged through the dirt.

A single, straight groove.

Like something had used the tip of a nail.

I stood up slowly, scanning the woods again.

That’s when I heard the rustling.

Right in front of me. In the brush on the far edge of the clearing.

At first it was soft—leaves shifting, a twig bending under weight.

Then it stopped.

And I realized I wasn’t hearing random movement. I was hearing something that had moved and then… waited.

I raised my rifle and aimed low, not at the brush itself but where something would step out if it decided to show itself.

“Hello?” I said, and my voice sounded too thin.

The brush moved again.

A deer stepped out.

Normal at first glance. A doe, medium-sized. Winter coat thick. Ears forward. Eyes wide and glossy in that way deer eyes are when they’re trying to decide if you’re danger or just weird.

It stood at the edge of the clearing and stared at me.

That’s not unusual. Deer freeze, then bolt.

This one didn’t bolt.

It held eye contact for too long.

Not a couple seconds. Not ten.

Long enough that I became aware of my own breathing. Long enough that I started to feel annoyed, like it was being rude.

Then it took a step forward.

Slow. Measured.

I kept my rifle up. I didn’t shoot. I’m not proud of that, but I couldn’t make my hands do it. Something about the deer’s stillness made it feel less like an animal and more like… a person pretending.

It tilted its head slightly.

Almost curious.

Then it blinked.

And the blink was slow. A fraction too slow. Like the skin had to think about how to close.

I backed up one step, keeping the rifle on it.

The deer didn’t follow.

It just watched.

My brain kept trying to force it into a normal box. Sick. Used to people. Starving.

Then I looked past it at the woods beyond.

Between the trunks, in that thin, shadowy space where distance turns into a blur, I saw something pale flash.

A shape.

Gone in an instant, like it had leaned out and then leaned back.

I couldn’t tell if it was a person. I couldn’t tell if it was another animal.

But the deer saw it too.

Because the deer’s eyes didn’t move. The deer didn’t flinch.

It just kept staring at me like it already knew what I was about to do next.

I didn’t like that.

I backed out of the clearing without turning my back fully, and then I did the thing I should’ve done the moment I saw the drag marks.

I left.

Not sprinting. Not panicking. Just moving briskly through the trees until the clearing disappeared behind me.

I told myself I’d get to my truck, get service, call it in as an abandoned campsite, and let someone else with a uniform and a radio handle it.

But I’d walked farther than I realized. And the terrain between me and the logging road wasn’t a straight line. It was a mess of little ridges and deadfall and low spots that all looked the same when you weren’t paying attention.

By the time I hit the first recognizable marker—an old blaze on a tree where someone had marked a trail years ago—the light was already starting to slant. Not dark yet, but that late afternoon angle that makes the woods look deeper.

I checked my phone.

No service.

Of course.

I kept walking anyway, trying to reverse my path, trying to stay calm, telling myself: Just get back to the road. Worst case, you spend a cold night and walk out at first light.

I’ve camped plenty. I had a small tent in my pack. A little stove. A headlamp. Enough to make it a rough night, not a deadly one.

It’s not the idea of camping that scared me.

It was the feeling that something had stepped into my route the moment I left that clearing.

It started as little things.

A soft crack behind me that stopped when I stopped.

A bird exploding out of a tree, frantic, like it had been startled from underneath.

Once, I caught the faintest whiff of something sour and wet—like leaves left in a bag too long—then it was gone and I told myself it was swampy ground.

I didn’t see the deer again.

But I kept thinking about those hoofprints with the ridges. The nail-drag groove. The way the doe blinked like it was copying the movement.

When I finally decided to set up camp, it wasn’t because I wanted to. It was because my internal compass—the one you don’t realize you’re using until it starts failing—was beginning to slip. Every direction started to look plausible. Every tree looked like the last tree.

I found a relatively flat spot on a slight rise, away from thick brush, and started clearing sticks.

I kept my rifle close. I set my headlamp on a rock so it would throw light outward instead of blinding me. I moved quick but not sloppy.

The woods were quiet in that way they get when the day animals settle down and the night ones haven’t started yet. A pause. A held breath.

As I clipped the last corner of my tent, I heard it.

A voice.

Not close. Not far.

Somewhere to my right, beyond the trees.

“Hey.”

I froze.

I didn’t answer right away because I didn’t trust my own ears.

Then it came again, slightly louder.

“Hey. Over here.”

It sounded like a man. Like someone trying not to scare me. Like someone choosing words carefully.

Every hair on my arms stood up.

Because I hadn’t heard any other hunters all day. No shots. No distant talking.

And because the voice didn’t carry the way voices do in the woods. It didn’t echo. It didn’t bounce. It sounded… pressed. Like it was coming through something, not from a throat.

“Who’s there?” I called.

A pause.

Then: “You can help me.”

“I’m not coming into the brush,” I said. “If you’re hurt, call out. I’ll come to you if I can see you.”

Another pause.

Then the voice softened, like it was trying a different angle.

“I’m cold.”

I stared into the trees, searching for movement, for a silhouette, for a flashlight beam.

Nothing moved.

No crunch of footsteps.

Just that voice.

Then, behind me, there was a soft sound.

A hoof on leaf litter.

I turned.

The doe stood at the edge of my campsite.

It hadn’t made a sound approaching. It was just… there.

My headlamp lit it in a clean circle of white. Its coat looked darker in patches along its ribs, like it was damp. Its breath didn’t show.

It stared at me.

Up close, it looked even more normal and even more wrong. The proportions were right. The face was deer face.

But the stillness was too deliberate.

Deer don’t stand like that. They flick. They fidget. They shift weight.

This one held itself like it had practiced.

The voice from the trees said, sharper now: “Don’t ignore me.”

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t take my eyes off the doe.

It took a step closer.

Then another.

The rational part of my brain tried to shove itself forward. Don’t let it get close. Don’t touch it. Shoot it if it charges.

But my body did that stupid freeze thing again, where you’re waiting for the moment you can explain it away.

The doe walked right up to the edge of my tent footprint. Close enough that I could see the texture of its nose. The damp shine on the nostrils. The little flecks of dirt at the mouth.

It looked at my hands.

Then it looked back at my face.

And then it leaned forward.

Like it expected contact.

Like it wanted me to touch it.

I don’t know why I did it. Maybe because I was trying to prove to myself it was just a deer. Maybe because it felt easier to deal with an animal than a disembodied voice in the woods.

I lowered my rifle slightly and reached out.

My fingers were inches from its forehead when I noticed the skin.

At first I thought it was the headlamp playing tricks. Headlamps can make fur look like it’s moving when it isn’t.

But this wasn’t an illusion.

The deer’s skin shifted.

Not twitching like muscle.

Sliding.

Like something underneath was repositioning.

The fur along its brow rippled, and for a second the direction of the coat looked wrong—like it was running against itself.

I stopped my hand midair.

The doe didn’t flinch. It didn’t pull back.

It leaned closer.

The skin on its neck rolled under the fur like a thick knot traveling along a rope.

I took a step back.

The doe followed, slow.

The voice from the trees snapped, loud enough to feel:

“Don’t.”

One word. Flat. Commanding.

I backed up again, my heel caught a tent stake, and I stumbled.

The doe’s eyes stayed locked on mine.

Then the skin around its jawline bulged.

The jaw stretched—not like a deer opening its mouth to bleat.

It stretched like rubber.

The corners of its mouth split slightly and then sealed again, as if the skin couldn’t decide what shape it was supposed to hold.

A sound came from its throat.

A wet click.

My stomach turned.

I brought my rifle up properly. “Back,” I said. “Back.”

The doe’s head dipped.

Its shoulders lifted.

The fur along its spine rose… and then it wasn’t fur anymore. It separated into thin strands, peeling, revealing something pale and hairless beneath.

Skin too tight over ridges that hadn’t been there a second ago.

It was like watching something wear a deer from the inside and realize it didn’t fit.

The front legs bent.

The joints shifted.

Bones popped softly, muffled by flesh, like cracking knuckles underwater.

Its chest expanded and the deer stood taller.

Not rearing like an animal.

Standing like a person learning how.

The head stayed deer-shaped for a moment longer, eyes still fixed on me, and then the face began to change.

The snout shortened. The mouth split wider, stretching sideways, exposing something dark and wet inside.

Teeth slid into view—small at first, then longer, more numerous—like they were being pushed forward from behind.

The voice in the trees whispered close, like it brushed my ear: “He’s right there.”

I spun toward the sound—

And that was the mistake.

The thing hit me like a tackle.

Not deer-fast. Heavy-fast. A body thrown with intent.

It slammed into my chest and drove me backward into my tent. Poles snapped. Fabric tore. My back hit the ground hard enough to knock the air out of me.

My rifle went sideways. I lost grip for half a second.

The thing’s weight pinned my legs.

Its breath hit my face—hot, damp, wrong. It smelled like wet leaves left in a bag too long. Like a swamp.

It clicked again, wet and rapid, and lowered its face.

Its mouth opened too wide.

Up close, the teeth weren’t neat predator teeth. They looked grown and replaced over and over. Uneven lengths. Some broken. Some new.

It bit at my shoulder.

Pressure first. Then tearing heat.

I screamed and drove my elbow up into its throat.

It didn’t grunt. It didn’t yelp.

It just… adjusted.

Like it wasn’t surprised.

I shoved the rifle barrel between us and pressed.

Its teeth scraped the metal with a sound that made my own teeth hurt.

It lifted its head, and for a split second, I saw what it had become.

Still deer-shaped in the broad sense, but warped. Too long through the torso. Too narrow at the hips. Patches of coat hanging like a jacket half removed. Underneath: pale skin with darker mottling, like bruises under the surface.

And the eyes were still deer eyes.

That somehow made it worse.

Because they weren’t wild.

They were attentive.

It watched my hands. It watched the rifle. It watched where I was going to move next.

The voice in the trees said, calm now: “That’s right.”

I turned my head just enough to shout, “WHO ARE YOU?”

No answer. Not a footstep. Not a laugh.

The thing leaned down again.

I fired.

The shot was so loud in the tight trees it felt like getting punched in the ears. Muzzle flash lit the canopy for a blink. Recoil slammed into my bitten shoulder and pain flared white.

The bullet hit the thing in the chest. I saw it. Dark fluid sprayed and spattered the torn tent fabric.

It didn’t fall.

It jerked like something had startled it, then sprang off me with an angry click and landed on all fours, balanced, and stared like it was offended.

I scrambled backward out of the collapsed tent, boots slipping on torn fabric and leaves. My shoulder burned. Warm blood ran down my arm and soaked my sleeve.

The voice in the woods sharpened: “Don’t run.”

I didn’t listen.

I got to my feet and ran anyway.

No direction. No plan. Just adrenaline and the certainty that staying was dying.

Branches whipped my face. My pack bounced and pulled. My injured shoulder screamed every time my arm moved.

Behind me, I heard it move.

Not a deer bounding.

Something heavier, pushing through brush with purpose.

And I heard clicking again—fainter now, but more than one rhythm, like it was being answered.

I ran until my lungs burned and my legs went numb, and then I tripped.

I went down hard on a slope, rolled through leaves, hit something solid with my hip. Pain shot up my side. The rifle clattered a few feet away.

I crawled for it, dragging myself with my good arm.

A shape moved between the trees ahead.

The doe-thing stepped into view.

It wasn’t fully upright now. It was hunched, spine arched wrong, like it had tried standing and decided it didn’t need to.

Its mouth hung slightly open. Saliva dripped. It breathed in a slow, wet rhythm that didn’t match any animal.

Behind it, deeper in the trees, I saw the faint glow of my campsite light through trunks. A little beacon.

The thing tilted its head toward it, then back to me.

Like it was deciding whether to finish me here or drag me back.

I raised the rifle with shaking hands and aimed at its head.

For a moment, it just watched me.

Then its skin rippled under the patchy coat and its face tightened. The mouth narrowed. The snout lengthened a hair.

Like it was trying to remember how to look harmless.

Like it was trying to become a deer again.

My finger tightened.

I fired again.

This time the thing jerked sideways and vanished into the brush with a tearing crash.

I didn’t wait to see if it was wounded or pretending.

I got up and ran downhill until I hit water.

A creek—cold, fast—cutting through the woods. I splashed into it and followed it, letting the sound cover my movement, letting the water take my scent the way my grandfather taught me.

Behind me, over the water, I heard rustling.

More than one set.

And the clicking came again—multiple, faint, like a conversation.

I kept moving until the trees thinned and I saw a strip of gravel road through the brush.

The logging road.

My truck was there, exactly where I’d left it, like it didn’t care what the woods did to people.

I dragged myself out of the creek and stumbled to the driver’s side. My hands shook so hard I dropped my keys once and had to grope around in the mud to find them.

I got the door open and climbed in.

The heater blasted cold air for a second before it warmed. I sat there breathing, shoulder throbbing, ears still ringing.

Then I looked up.

Across the road, between two trees, the doe stood watching.

Normal again. Fur smooth. Body right. Head tilted slightly.

It stared at me for too long.

And right before I slammed the truck into gear and tore out, I saw the skin along its neck ripple once under the fur.

Not like an animal twitch.

Like something underneath shifting into a better fit.
