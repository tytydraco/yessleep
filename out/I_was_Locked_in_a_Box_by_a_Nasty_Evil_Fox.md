Have you been locked in a box? Have you been trapped by a fox? I have, once, been locked in a box by a nasty evil fox. He had eyes that watched me like a hawk, that nasty evil fox.

I was a child once, playing with blocks. I was running around my house, padding around in my socks. Then the doorbell rang, and my mother greeted that nasty evil fox. 

He always did things unorthodox. He always showed up at 7 o’clock. He always brought in mail from the mailbox. That nasty fox always brought in mail from the mailbox.

Yet I had already brought in mail from the mailbox! Ever since I was first locked in a box, I would grab the mail from the mailbox. I would grab the mail before it was 7 o’clock, but he’d always come inside with more mail, that nasty evil fox. 

He would set the mail at the table, that evil fox. My mother would then read all the new mail from the mailbox. That fox would pull out all the stops, to keep her reading the mail from the mailbox. 

He would turn to me, his teeth jagged like rocks. He would turn. He would smile. He would beam, that nasty evil fox. He would then pull out a dress for me, a frock. He would grab me as I kicked and screamed, and he would stuff me in that frock. 

No matter what I did, I could never outfox the fox. I would hit him with pots, or hide amongst my socks, but that nasty fox always put me in that frock. 

The dress was the color of the inside of an ox. Startlingly red, and dripping wet, was the color of the damnable frock. Please stop, I would scream, but no matter what words I cried I never escaped that nasty evil fox.

I always knew what happened, after I was stuffed tightly in that frock. The fox would grin and yip, happy that it was time for the box. Once I was in my frock, he would smile, and he would take off all his clothes, until the only thing on was his socks.

What was I to do, then, stuck in my frock with a fox only in his socks? There was nothing I could do, then, watching a fox get closer to me while only in his socks.

Then came the box.

I would be led to the living room, where I was once happily playing with my blocks. He would tug me along by my hand as I desperately tried to run, that nasty evil fox. He pulled a box out from nowhere, and he would place it down amongst my blocks. He would then grab me while I stood there, shivering, in my bright pink frock. 

The box was so small, no bigger than a spot of the good old chicken pox. There was no way I could ever fit inside that box. Yet I was grabbed and pushed, and I managed to fit all the way inside, pushed there by that evil fox. 

The box always choked my body, yet the Fox never cared about how I felt. Inside, with my frock all bunched up, I felt pressed against a thousand little rocks. My legs were above my head, my arms wrapped around my feet, my knees behind my chest, as I had been pushed around inside that cripplingly tiny box. 

Then, I would feel that nasty evil fox. He would push himself inside with me, and I would be pressed into all the corners of that oblong box. The box had a lock, and I could always hear it click shut. From there, a paradox. I would feel hours go by, from 8 o'clock to 9 o’clock. I would know the hours had passed because of that tiny lock. It would click open then, and I would try to escape the box, but that nasty fox would laugh and once more shut the box. 

It was only after twenty-six chimes of that lock, that the fox would attempt to remove himself from the box. From there, he’d grab me from the back of my frock, and pull until I was always out of the box. 

His smile was no longer full of rocks, no, he looked content standing there in just his socks. He would then put back on his pants, before crawling for the door, going straight through my blocks. He never took the box with him, as it instead became one of my blocks. It no longer had a lock. 

Before leaving, he would knock. The sound shook my mother from reading the mail from the mailbox. She would never greet the fox, after he had knocked. Instead, she turned to me, and wondered where were my socks.
