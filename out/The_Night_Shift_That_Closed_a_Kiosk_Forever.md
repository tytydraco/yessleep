In Serbia, between Belgrade and Niš, there was a kiosk called “Girosi kod Brata.”
Two of my friends worked there, and if you looked it up on a map, you’d think it was some kind of mistake.

But it wasn’t.

One road.
Fields as far as the eye could see.
No houses. No lights.

The nearest town was almost 50 kilometers away.

That kiosk had no right to be there.

Two of my friends worked night shifts there—Milica and Katarina. Five years. From 4 p.m. to 5 a.m. Every night. Alone. If you’ve ever worked nights in the middle of nowhere, you already know what kind of hell that is.

At first, nothing looked wrong.

Then the system started glitching.

Orders began appearing out of nowhere—deliveries logged under names none of us recognized. Not foreign. Not local. Just… wrong. Like names that almost made sense, but didn’t.

A week later, the owner received emails from the suppliers:

“Deliveries completed last Thursday.”

It was impossible.

Last Thursday, the kiosk had been closed all day. We were celebrating a religious holiday. Everybody knew. The factories knew. The gate was locked. No electricity. No staff.

They called inspections. Police, too.

They came.
Looked around.
Shrugged.

“Nothing suspicious.”

That’s when Katarina stopped laughing about it.

One night during her shift, she felt it—the cold pressure on the back of the neck that tells you you’re being watched. She checked the windows. Nothing. Fields. Darkness.

She locked the door and checked the security monitors.

One camera showed a figure standing far out in the field.

Too far away to see details. Too still to be an animal.

It wasn’t moving.
Not swaying.
Not shifting its weight.

Just standing.

Looking directly into the camera.

Her hands were shaking when she pulled the metal shutters down, just so she wouldn’t have to see it anymore.

The moment the shutters hit the floor, every camera froze.

The screen went black.

No footage saved.
No error message.
Just… gone.

The next night was Milica’s shift.

Around 2 a.m., she heard something land on the metal roof.

Then another impact.

Then scraping.

Heavy. Slow. Like something pacing above her head.

She locked herself inside the supply closet—the one with the tiny hole in the door where the handle used to be. She crouched there, barely breathing, watching the darkness through that pinhole.

That was when she heard the knocking.

Calm.
Polite.
Three knocks.

Then a voice.

“Milice.”

Her boss’s voice. Kristijan’s voice. Perfect. Even the tone was right.

“Open up. I heard the noise. Are you okay?”

Her heart almost stopped.

With shaking hands, she checked her phone and texted him:

Where are you??

Twenty seconds passed.

Outside, the knocking continued.
The voice kept talking—reassuring, familiar.

Then her phone buzzed.

I’m at a club with my girlfriend Ana. Why?

Kristijan wasn’t outside.

Whatever was knocking kept using his voice.

Milica stayed inside that closet for hours. She didn’t scream. She didn’t cry. She didn’t move. When the knocking finally stopped, it was already morning.

She climbed out through the bathroom window and ran.

Didn’t lock the door.
Didn’t look back.

They both quit the same day.

A week later, the kiosk shut down. Nobody would take the night shift. Inspections came again. Same result. On paper, nothing ever happened. Panic. Exaggeration. Stress.

They never told me everything.

They didn’t have to.

That place is still there—dark, empty, sitting 50 kilometers from anything that matters.

Waiting.

For the next night shift that will never come
