there is a house in Ajo Arizona, up on the mountain side, that used to exist! It was called the BunnyHouse. And before it burned down it was being renovated. And I am glad it's gone!

Okay i should explain who i am before i tell you about the BunnyHouse! So I am Nate, a freelance house flipper, former employee at the DesertHome Company. And before this company went defunct we had one last job!

So a young lady called DesertHome Company to renovate a house! She bought it from an unknown seller and it was quote “too bunny oriented and a little creepy”! at the time my boss Randy didn’t know what the fuck that ment but said “don’t worry miss we will take care of the bunny problem”.

So then Me, Randy, two other guys one named Scott the other Chris drove to the BunnyHouse! While driving up the mountain I saw a shiny light out from the desert mountain range! But when we arrived at the BunnyHouse we saw dead Bunnies stapled to the exterior walls of the house.

And if that weren't creepy enough. The interior was full of bunny memorabilia there were large realistic bunny statues at the corners of each room, the wall paper was full of bunnies in different poses, the carpet although faded also had bunnies on it, and there were fucking paintings of famous bunnies like bugs bunny, peter rabbit, peeps, nasquick!

Overall it was the most freakiest fucking house ive ever seen! Plus it smelled like death, which we thought was because of the bunnies stapled outside! But nonetheless we first removed the stapled bunnies and throw them into a fire that we started, it fucking stank. Then we proceeded to remove the bunny antiques and put them into a storage unit. Before then completely gutting the house of what bunny things were still attached.

Before we then left for the day. As we were driving back to Ajo we heard a scream Scott said “did y’all hear that”? Chris said “uh yay dumb ass” Randy yelled “will you too stop fighting” before Randy went to go see what that scream is!

While we waited in the van for Randy.we thought we could hear noises from outside our van they sounded like someone was jumping. We could hear the thumps get louder and closer but then they stopped. And after they stopped randy came back

I asked Randy “what was the noise”? Randy said “shut the fuck up”! and we continued to drive back to Ajo.

That night I couldn't sleep! I kept hearing thumping noises outside my window. I live in a one story house so it felt quite scary! And when ever i looked out my window i didn’t see anything but could still here the fucking jumping! And then i realized something what if those noise where inside my fucking house!

I immediately locked my bedroom door and the noise stopped! But somehow that was far scarier! The next day as me and my coworkers were driving up to the house I saw the shiny thing again!

I ask Randy “hey Randy i think i see something can we go check it out” Randy said “no we are getting this house fixed up today” and as we got to the house! Randy got out of the van and yelled “you’ve got to be fucking kidding me”!

As some as we heard Randy yell, Chris ran out and asked Randy “hey yo Randy what happened”? Randy pointed to the house! Apparently the door was stolen! After Randy controlled his temper he said “I'm going downtown to a new door so, stay here and fix up the house”!

And the randy left! Scott then asked me “hey nate do you want to go see what that shiny thing was”? I said “wouldn't randy be mad at us”? Scott said “not if we get back before he does”! And criss said “i’ll fix up the house while you're gone”! So me and Scott walked to the location of the shiny thing!

I will not lie it was a fucking pain to get there. Because it was a long fucking hot walk but when we got there. We noticed it was an old ford pick up truck. And inside there was a box that smelled like shit! And as we were about to open it.

We heard a scream that sounded loud and echoing so we turned and saw a long dark cave! Me and Scott immediately ran back to the house, not wanting to be caught by whatever that thing was!

And when we made it back we saw Chris lying on the floor exhausted from the damn Arizona heat! We felt bad so we placed a fan next to him. but then that fucking smell came back and it smelt worse.

So I will not lie, we almost quit working on the house when Randy came back with a new door! And when he saw Chris lying on the floor he shouted “what the fuck is going on here”? Me and Scott said “he had a heat stroke”!

Randy yelled “great we're down to only three people now”! After that an Ambulance came to pick up Chris and I then noticed that he had scars under his sleeves! After we replaced what we removed we drove home!

While we were driving another scream was heard. And instead of checking for the noise Randy floored it! We said “randy chill out”! Randy yelled back at us “shut up you don’t understand what it is”!

When we got back into Ajo. me and Scott were having a conversation. Scott said “hey  Nate do you think Randy has been a lot more scared lately”? I said “ yeah he i think he saw what was in the cave”! Scott said “if he did we should probably not go back there”! I said “i agree”

The next day as we were driving to the house I noticed that the shine from the ford pick up truck was gone! When we got to the house we noticed there was nothing wrong with the exterior! But the interior was completely fucked up!

It has claw marks, and blood stains, and holes in the walls leading to a closet! Upon seeing this Randy just fucking lost it he just let out the most animalistic scream! He began yelling ‘god fucking damn it why must my life fucking suck”!

And then he stormed off to his van. and left me and Chris behind to clean the house! As we were trying to clean up the house I had a creeping suspicion of seeing what was in the closet! So when I opened it I saw nothing but smelled death!

So I went back to cleaning up. But then Chris said “um Nate i see a BunnyMan”! I ran to Chris and I too saw a BunnyMan! I don’t know if that was a costume or an eldritch monstrosity! But I saw a large bunny with human proportions! But then it left and Randy came back!

Randy apologized and said “look i’m sorry that i lost my cool it’s just if we don’t flip this house right we might go bankrupt”! Me and Chris said “we understand how about we get a drink”!

So we went to a bar! and as we were there i must have gotten drunk because i woke up in my house while it was destroyed! I don’t know who destroyed it because when I woke up I heard a scream from my bedroom! I was still hung over so i thought it would be smart to go investigate it and when i opened my bedroom door!

I saw nothing in there but a broken window! and a circle of dead rabbits i gagged and passed out! When I woke up I heard the van honking! I got dressed while still hung over and went to the van!

Randy was saying “good it was a mistake to listen to you guys and it is our last day to renovate the fucking house”! As we drove to the house neither me or Chris talked! In fact he was more drunk than me.

As we got to the house Randy said “okay guys i am going to buy some furniture to replace what broke so please make sure nothing bad happens”! Me and Chris said “sure thing Randy”! And Randy left. I told Chris “hey Chris can you look out and see if the BunnyMan”? Chris said while drunk “sure”

I went into the closet to see if there was anything. It smelled worse than before! But I noticed scrape marks on the floor! I realized this was a hidden door! So I began pulling at it! And it finally opened!

And when I opened it up I saw something that changed everything! There were fucking corpses  in this house and whats worse was some were still alive! I also saw a huge hole in the middle of the room! One of the people crawled up to me and asked “kill me please”!

I was about to leave the house when I heard Chris scream. I knew that the BunnyMan was back! I knew I couldn't leave the way I came in ! so without thinking i jumped into the hole! Surprisingly I didn't break anything. But that's because I landed on other corpses! I could hear the BunnyMan scream!

So I ran down the pile of dead bodies and down a long corridor! and suddenly I could feel the once smooth concrete floor become rocky and unpredictable! As I kept running I could see a bright light! When I made it out I saw the ford pick up truck. So that ment that the cave i found earlier lead to the fucking house!

And as I got out of the cave someone grabbed me! I saw who it was! It was Randy! He pulled me into the van! I saw Chris heavily scratched up! Randy ask me “what the fuck is happening Nate”? I told Randy “a BunnyMan was killing people and almost killed us”!

As we took Chris to the hospital. An officer questioned saying “care to explain what was happening”! I told him “there is a BunnyMan who has been killing people in that house up the mountain”! The police officer turned pale as he called a swat team on that house!

After that, the swat team was about to get there! when they saw the BunnyHouse had burned down before they could find out what happened! And nobody could find the tunnel at all! And all the bunny memorabilia was stolen from the storage unit!

It’s been years since that happened! Although Scott and Chris recovered! They still are not their old selves, Randy still is unemployed, and I still can hear the thumping  and screaming at night! But at least there in the neighboring town of Maricopa Arizona!
