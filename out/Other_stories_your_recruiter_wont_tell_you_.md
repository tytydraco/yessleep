The support of my last two posts have been amazing, thank you guys so much. I’ll go ahead and dive into my next story. 

So this story isn’t mine personally, but it is the story of a Sgt (I’ll refer to him as J) that I used to work with in Germany. The story takes place in Kansas, while J was on a night land navigation course with his unit. 

J had completed the course and was told to walk between the points to make sure other soldiers were okay and not having any medical emergencies. It was almost 2300 and the time limit was almost up. While J was walking through the woods he heard a soldier call out to him 

“Hey man, you got any water? I’m dry.”

The voice suddenly breaking the silence did make J jump but he laughed it off and responded. 

“Yeah, Jesus you scared the shit out of me” 

As J was getting his water bottle out of his backpack he realized that there was no response to what he said, which was odd. When he stood up and held up his water bottle he looked to where the voice was coming from and didn’t see anyone, no light, no silhouette, nothing. He called out but to no response. 


Well that story looks short as fuck so I’ll add another one, hope y’all are ready for a double header. 

This next story comes from my time in Germany. My entire army career I have been an MP (I’ve tried to keep it a secret because we don’t get a whole lot of love) but it is pretty important to this story. And our SOP (standard operating procedure) says that whenever we come across an unsecured door (unlocked or propped open) we have to call another patrol to us and clear the building. 

It was another mundane midnight shift, and I was struggling to stay awake. I decided to check the main event center building. I walked around the building checking all the doors, I got to the last door on the back and lo and behold it was unlocked. I called the other patrol over (it was J from the last story, this was the same night he told me the land nav story) and we start clearing the building. 

It started out normal enough, a little eerie because it was 0330 in the morning. So to fill the silence of us walking around we started telling scary stories to try and freak each other out, he told me a land nav story, I told him the story of me shooting a skin walker back home. Then we got to the kitchen. 

We entered the kitchen and it was hot, like the rest of the building was warm but the kitchen was fuckin HOT. As we looked around the more everything looked wrong. There were handprints on the windows, all the drawers were open, even the ovens were open. We found the source of the heat, one of the open ovens were on. We turned it off and kept looking around trying not to bump any drawers closed. 

We moved onto the basement and holy shit my watch read 0333, I was NOT trying to fuck with any ghosty shit. But we had to do our job and keep clearing. As soon as we got to the bottom of the stairs we started to smell rot, we both assumed the worst and drew our sidearm and started very loudly and clearly announcing ourselves (we were supposed to be doing that the whole time but this building was often found unsecured with no one inside. 

“Military police, if anyone is down here make yourself known”

As soon as the words left my mouth there was very loud, heavy steps from the floor above us. I’ll admit that I froze, then I looked over to J and he nodded up towards the ceiling and I understood the message. I turned back around and started to go back to the stairs, announcing myself multiple times to a silent audience. 

We got back up to the first floor and cleared it a second time, and couldn’t find anyone so we decided to clear the second floor and same story, don’t find or hear anything. J says that we still need to clear the basement, so we go back to the basement stairs. This time as we got to the bottom we don’t smell anything, no rot and no air freshener covering up the smell of rot. 

We cleared the basement with no incident and cleared from the building, we reported no incident only because we couldn’t figure out what we would tell dispatch. The whole situation just leaves me questioning reality.
