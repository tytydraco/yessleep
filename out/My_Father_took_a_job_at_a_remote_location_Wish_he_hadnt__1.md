Bedtime stories are my favorite. I am 23 now, but still every now and then my father would tell me the same old horror stories he encountered decades back, which now I know were not stories.

“You wanna hear the stories tonight?” said my father. I, a 23 male, home on a holiday from work, was excited as I used to be since my childhood. We had dinner, and after that the stories began.

He had a diary where he noted it down too. He began to read it:

Money is important. It’s 1993 and I still don’t have a good job. Maybe I should take up the night shift for equipment handling on that remote hilly area. While working, I’ll find something else.

Sept 2, I decided to take that job, my first day at the job. The facility is pretty big, situated on a hilly road, with forest covering it from everywhere. The washrooms are outside the facility, some 2 mins walk, weird I thought. I entered the facility and met Jake and John that are my partners for the night shift. We were of the same age, so we got along pretty easily. We were introduced to our manager, who showed us the whole facility and what should we monitor. Pretty straightforward job, I said.

The sun is going down, and its almost completely dark here. My manager gets up to leave, but before that, he turns towards us and says:

“We have a rule here. Don’t go outside at night. You wanna pee? Pee in your bottle. Wanna take a dump? Do it on a piece of paper, but don’t go outside.”

Saying this, he left.

We were pretty surprised, and the fact that we can’t go to washroom sucks. Till 3 in the morning, things went by in a pretty normal way. Suddenly, Jake comes to me and John, who were chitchatting near one equipment we were monitoring.

“I wanna pee”, he said.

John and I looked at each other, thinking what should we do.

“Just pee in some bottle man”, said John.

“Nah, I’m going out.”

The doors to the facility were big and heavy, requiring to press a button to lock or unlock.

In a sense of urgency and care, we decided to join Jake, just in case.

Jake pushed the button, the doors opened in a very creaky noise. A wave of cold air grasped us. Outside, there was no light, no sound, just empty forest and darkness with cold winds. We three started walking towards the washroom, located a little downhill. We could only hear our footsteps, while the forest was silent. But it was nothing which would cause us to get scared. We reached the washroom, Jake got inside. While waiting for him, John and I chatted about the computers, and how it is developing so fast.

Suddenly, the already silent forest felt more—Silent.

Jake came outside, with an irritated voice, said

“Why the hell you guys were laughing?”

We both were stunned. Nobody laughed, and we heard nobody laughing too. Jake refused to believe, irritated started going back and we started following him. While the facility was not far away and we could see the lights from the road, dim in the night, something was not feeling right. Suddenly, John and I heard someone laughing behind us. Someone who is a child, 10 yo at max, but the laugh was evil, like it was mocking us, challenging us to face it. We both looked back, but there was nothing there, just a road and a cliff, where you can easily jump off and die. Jake looked back briefly, unaware of anything. John and I, picked our pace on our way back. Jake asked me what happened, but I just grabbed him and started walking, faster.

And then, we all three heard the laughter.

It was loud, scary, evil, it made the hairs on our neck stand up. And it was just BEHIND us. We heard footsteps that were not ours. The facility was just in front of us, we opened the door and quicky closed it. John and I could swear we saw red eyes staring at us from the darkness while closing the door.

While we were relieved of being inside the facility, the doors suddenly opened, and someone came inside.

It was JAKE. The actual Jake. He took his time to smoke inside the washroom, and was cursing us for leaving him behind.

The one that came with us back, was not JAKE.

And then suddenly, we heard someone laughing inside the facility.

The doors are no more working, we are trapped now.

Our life is in danger.

My father was sleepy, and he said he will tell me the rest tomorrow. But I know one thing, the facility is not too far away from me. I need to go there.
