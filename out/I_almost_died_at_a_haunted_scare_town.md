Last year, i went to my brothers baseball tournament for the weekend. I personally don't enjoy baseball. I am just forced to go.

My friend Sarah, who also had a brother on the team went on a walk with me during the first game. We knew we would be there for the rest of the day, so we decided to explore around the fields. As we were headed toward the ends of the fields, we saw an abandoned park.
 

We checked it out. As i'm looking around my friend wondered off. She comes back to me screaming to follow her. I follow, kind of eery about what she could have possibly found. 

 I saw 3 buildings, All in a circle, Made of wood. They were falling apart and covered by plants and trees. They all had different labels as if they were stores. Such as "Salon" "Guns" "Doctor". The middle had a church. It looked like a little haunted town. 

As we walked along, We discovered a Open door. The rest were locked. We as soon as i swung the door open i found a cage. It had what looked to be animal feces and blood. I was startled.

But what i was more startled by was the bear trap. What was the doing here. It was almost as if it was set up to capture a human who would open the door. We were scared. 

We turned around to leave. As we turn around we see a red light coming from one of the buildings. It was a camera. I was fearing for my life at this point. As we try to leave we discover more bear traps. We decide to explore more. 

We find another open door. No bear traps this time. It had a mattress on the ground and food. Like someone was living there. I look at the mattress. Blood. I look around making sure not to step inside. I see a chainsaw. I freeze. I immeditly closed the door and looked to my friend. 

We both in silence walked away to were we came in. Through the trees and past the park. As we are walking back we see someone who worked at the fields. He saw that we were walking back from the park. He approached us. 

 "Hey, Did you go near that park?" us: "Yea" "You really shouldn't be near there" us: "Why" 

 "Me and my friend who worked here went up there. We found an abandoned haunted houseright near it. We opened a door. he stepped on a bear trap and he lost so much blood he almost died. When we called 911 the owner had already showed up. I don't know what he had in his bag or what he was planning to do to us. 

He said he saw us on his camera. It's really really not safe in there. The owner got questioned by the police but nothing ever happened. It's not safe at all kiddo"

Us "Oh okay we won't go near there again" We walked all the way back to the fields were our parents were in silence. We never talked about it again. Moral of the story don't explore abandoned places and trust your gut.
