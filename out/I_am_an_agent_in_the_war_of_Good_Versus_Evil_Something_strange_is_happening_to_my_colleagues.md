My name is Shay, and I am an agent in the war of Good Versus Evil. I work tirelessly and selflessly to fight the demons and monsters that threaten the mere existence of humanity. It’s a job not without significant risks. That’s for sure. However, I sleep soundly every night knowing that I’m doing my part to help keep the world just a little bit safer.

Well, truth be told, I might be exaggerating just a bit when I say the word ‘agent’. Technically speaking, I work in a weapons factory that manufacturers holy weapons that the actual angels and soldiers use to vanquish the evil entities. I’m more what you would call an….’assembly specialist’. At least that is what my cool boss Gary says to me.  

So, what is it that a heroic assembly specialist does? Well, I help assemble parts on a complex assembly line for a weapon that is instrumental in the Good fight. For security purposes, no individual ‘assembly specialist’ knows what the completed weapon looks like. We just assemble small parts that fit together at later stages of the process. The only thing that I know about the completed weapon is the name attached to it. 

**It’s called PROJECT HALO.**

I wasn’t exaggerating though when I said that my job comes with significant risks. Several of my co-assembly specialists near me have recently been replaced suddenly. The replacements came in without warning and we never heard what happened to the replacements’ predecessors. I’ve never in my life worked somewhere with such frequent turnover. 

Take for example, Samantha. She used to work right next me on the assembly line of Good. Working next to people that you like always makes coming to work every day a real joy. That’s why when Samantha was suddenly replaced, it was a shocker for me. They even got rid of her special chair they had purchased for her to accommodate her slightly overweight form.  

My boss Gary said all the turn-over was due to burn-out. I supposed that was possible. The rumor though at the water cooler was that demons had been targeting workers at the facility to disrupt manufacturing. 

Gary didn’t seem too worried about it. Whenever me or anyone else brought up to him our concerns about this or anything else, he would listen and smile with his impossibly handsome and cool smile and nod sympathetically. He told me not to worry. That definitely put me at ease.

Gary even joked to me in the section meeting that was attended by everybody that he promised he would not let me end up hurt like Jake over in section C. Jake suffered from a congenital issue that impaired his ability to walk without a cane. Gary then limped as he walked to the center of the room and spoke in lisp and said, “I promise, buddy. I will protect you!”. 

We all laughed. Even Jake after a moment. After all, it was all in good fun. A close-knit crew of workers in it together for the good fight. Gary just had a way with people. So cool and smooth. It really was a pleasure to be working there. 

Despite every hardship and all the turn over, we were able to keep high spirits. In fact, one day, out of the blue, Gary came by my station to show me something interesting. He showed me a clip of Wendy from Section B. It was a picture of her from college in which she entered some bikini modeling contest. She would be so embarrassed if she knew I saw this. We both said “Nice” and fist bumped each other.

Unfortunately, a week ago an attack hit one of the managers from Section L. It happened right outside the facility in a brazen attack by demon sympathizers. The manger, Mrs. Astrid, was severely injured by the attack. I only saw a flash of her as she was wheeled through the entrance in an emergency stretcher. Apparently, the demon sympathizers wrote “Revenge!” in blood across her car. 

I couldn’t believe that such a thing happened to the beautiful Mrs. Astrid. It was somewhat alarming an attack happened so close to the facility, but I didn’t let it deter me. I kept my stiff upper lip and carried on, as my great grandfather would say.

One thing though that does still scare me is the thought of running into the mega demons called The Vexatio. These demons are the demonic assassins that target the weak and cowardly. They were used to infiltrate weak points in the ranks of the army of Good. Their method of killing involved using their sharp teeth that protracted unnaturally outwards from their mouth to saw through their victims. Their attacks always accompanied by a saw-like sound and a shrill electronic scream that haunts any unfortunate souls that happens to hear it and live.

“You speak Dragonese, damn that’s awesome…”, Gary said to me one morning before we started our weekly meeting. I saw him come to the office in a brand-new European sports car. I figured it was beyond the means of most people but Gary must be doing really well for himself. Maybe he’s privately wealthy and does this work out of a sense of duty like me. I certainly don’t do it for the meager sum Gary is, according to him, begrudgingly forced to me. 

“Dude that is so awesome. Man, you better watch out, that is a powerful skill. People like that are the first to be killed over in Operations. I would keep that to yourself, buddy”, Gary said.  I don’t know how it came up exactly but I mentioned that I had a skill for picking up languages. I supposed I was just trying to impress him. I told him how I acquired the demonic language Dragonese from a very brief study as a hobby.  

“Wait, do you think I could be useful to the Good fight outside of assembly?  Gary, I would do that in a heart-beat, if I could. Could you do a recommendation for me to Operations?”, I asked. I was legitimately excited about the possibility of contributing more to the fight for Good.

“Yeah, sure thing. Tell you what. Why don’t you wait and sit on this information for a few days so I can make a few calls. I’ll take care of everything”, Gary said flashing one of his cool smiles. Damn, the guy can do no wrong.

This was actually happening, I thought. I was going to be an actual agent! I was so excited that I just can’t sleep that night when I got home. Tomorrow I would hopefully be speaking to a member in Operations and could start my training.

I was just about to fall asleep when I heard something. A scratching noise just outside my bedroom window, followed by a metallic whirling saw-like sound and a haunting electronic scream.
