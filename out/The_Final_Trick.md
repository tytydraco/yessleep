“So what’re you doing for Halloween tonight?”

I glanced around my new living room.  Everything seemed alien, furniture crowded by stacks of boxes, sitting in a house I’d been in less than twenty-four hours.  Still, I tried to keep my voice light when I answered.

"I should be unpacking, but after being on the phone all day getting utilities swapped over and turned on, I think I’ll just chill.  I have internet now, so there’s that.  Um, what about you?”

“Oh, me and Maddie are just going to a party at her brother’s house.  I wish you were here to go with me.”

“Yeah.  I wish you were here with me.”

A pause, and then.  “You know I want to be.  We’ve talked about this.  When I finish this fellowship and the lease is up on the apartment, we can figure out about me moving out there.”

“Sure.  I’m not trying to fight about it again, or anything.  Just miss you.”

“Miss you too.  With what they’re paying you, I understand you had to go ahead and move, but I…look, Maddie’s calling and I have to go, but I’ll text you later tonight, yeah?”

“Sure.”

“And try to have some fun, okay?  Go explore your new town, or at least watch a cool movie.  It is Halloween after all.”

**\*\*YES\*\***

\*\*\*\*

I was nervous as I waited for the stream to start.  It had been a lot of money, even with my signing bonus and future salary, but didn’t I deserve it?  A little treat, a little memorable something to cheer myself up or at least distract me for a few hours?  I’d been toying with the idea since I got the email the week before, but after talking to her…well, I didn’t have a party to go to, but maybe I could still have some fun.

I wasn’t sure what to expect, but when the video came on, I was looking through the eye of a camera at what looked like a man dressed in a black hooded cloak and a woman dressed in a tight black cat costume.  Both were wearing masks, and when the perspective shifted to one of the others’ camera, I saw the last person was dressed like a plague doctor, with a long beak jutting out from underneath a wide-brimmed brown hat.

“Hi Mike!”  The man in the cloak waved at what must be the Cat’s camera.

The plague doctor’s voice was softer and higher, and I wasn’t sure if it was a man or a woman underneath.  "Hey, man!  Happy Halloween!”

The camera switched back to the Cloak so the Cat could greet me.  “Are you ready to have an awesome time tonight?”

A prompt popped up on the bottom of the screen.  I couldn’t talk or text to them directly, but I was supposed to routinely get chances to answer questions or decide what they did next.  This prompt said:

*\*Ready to begin?\**

I clicked **\*YES\*** and over the stream I heard an odd, warbling ghost noise after a second.

*\*Oooooo\**

In response, they all gave a laugh and cheer.  I saw the Cat’s full lips curl into a smile under the edge of her mask’s delicate black and pink nose.

“That’s what I like to hear.  We know this is your first time as a Nighttripper, so we’ll start out slow so you can get used to it.  First off, we’ll do a little light trick-or-treating for candy.”  She laughed and the others joined in.  “I know, I know, it’s supposed to be for kids,” she patted her butt and shook her black tail with her hand, “but we look awesome, right?  Who would deny us a little treat?”

Laughing as I watched them, I felt my initial discomfort and anxiety washing away.  They all seemed nice enough, and this was all super-weird, sure, but what wasn’t weird these days?  Maybe it would be a memorable experience if nothing else.

The camera view kept swapping periodically between the three of them as they left the circle of light where they’d started the stream and headed down a dark, neighborhood street.  I wondered where they were at.  Their accents sounded American, and the neighborhood did too, but then I’ve never really been anywhere farther than Canada, and that looks the same anyway.  I wished I could ask them more questions or talk to them directly, but I knew that wasn’t allowed.  The rules had said it was limited to this form of guided communication where I got asked questions and tell them things to do at certain points.  Just like…

The Cloak turned to the camera.  “Okay, Mike.  So here’s your first choice. Do we go with the house in front of us, to the left, or to the right?”

*\*The house in front, left, or right?\**

**\*\*Right\*\***

*\*Oooooo\**

Cloak nodded.  “Cool, you’re the boss.”

They went up the walkway and onto the front porch of a nice brown brick house with the lights on and rang the doorbell.  The Doctor rang the bell a second time and then they waited patiently, taking turns grinning into the camera and laughing quietly until the door opened and a middle-aged man looked out with bemused surprise.

“Trick-or-treat!” They all said in unison.

The man stared at them a moment and then gave a smirk.  “Little old for Halloween, aren’t you?”

Cat stepped forward and giggled softly.  “Halloween is for everyone.  Now won’t you give us just a little something sweet?”

The man blushed a little as he gave an awkward laugh and brought out a basket full of candy.  “Yeah, sure.  I mean, if you’ve been a good girl.”

She gave a throaty laugh.  “Not a day in my life.  Especially not tonight.”

The man blushed more as he gave all three handfuls of small chocolate bars.  “Well, extra candy for you then.”

I was dying laughing by the time they walked back to the street, and they were breaking up as well.  Clearing their throat, the Doctor looked at me then.

“Do you want us to go back to the same house again, go to a different house, do something spooky?”

I frowned at the screen as the prompt popped up.

*\*Same house, different house, or spooky time?\**

What did that mean?  And why go back to the same house?  To fuck with that guy?  He seemed nice enough, and it’d be awkward if they went back again.  Still, did I want to see more trick or treating, or…

**\*\*Spooky time\*\***

*\*Oooooo\**

The Doctor clapped his leather gloved hands together in appreciation.  “Good choice.  Let’s get into something interesting.  We’re going to head to another location.  Should take us about twenty-five minutes.  When we’re there, we’ll start the stream back.  So go take a bathroom break and grab some candy, because you won’t want to miss this!”

The screen went dark, and in the black glass, I could see myself staring back.

\*\*\*\*

When the stream started back, they were standing next to a rusted chain-link fence.  In the distance, I could see the moonlit silhouette of several large buildings.  Taking out a flashlight, Cat illuminated her face for a moment before sweeping her light back across decaying brick and rusty metal doors as she spoke.

“This is Stonebrook.  Or it was.  Long time ago it was a school, and the rumor was that it was haunted.  Except unlike a lot of bullshit, this place really \*was\* haunted by something, and one night, a lot of people died.  Now it’s…well, it’s an abandoned dump, but its still super creepy, right?  And maybe something still lives in there.”  Her lips twitched into a coy smile.  “Do you want us to go inside the fence?"

*\*Go inside the fence at Stonebrook?\**

**\*\*YES\*\***

*\*Oooooo\**

Cat clapped excitedly as Cloak started pulling back a section of chainlink for them to enter.  A couple of minutes later, they were walking around the darkened, overgrown lawn of what had probably once been a nice school.  As they approached one of the buildings, Cloak looked back to me.

“Should we go explore the inside of this place?”

*\*Should we go inside?\**

I was about to click **\*YES\*** when the Doctor spoke up.  “Hey, man, I don’t know about that.  Walking around out here is cool and all, but going inside?  I don’t want some burglary charge or to get bit by rattlesnakes living in that shitpile.”

Cat frowned at him.  “You know the rules.  If Mike wants us to do something, we do it.”

The Doctor nodded, his beak bobbing nervously.  “Sure, I get it.  But I really am spooked about it.  I…I’ve heard about this place, man.”  He looked at me through Cloak’s camera.  “How about something else, huh?”

Cloak snorted.  “How about we go on to the gym since you’re being such a bitch about it?”  He grabbed the Doctor by the arm and started pulling him toward the larger building deeper into the campus.  “Mike, you might not know this, but the killings mainly happened in there.  We were going to save it, but how about we send the big, tough plague doctor in to bust those ghosts right now?”  Cat cackled and took his other arm as they pulled him up to a set of double-doors.  I could see a coil of discolored cut chain on the ground nearby, and…then the prompt changed.

*\*Send the Doctor into the gym alone to seek the Ghost?\**

I felt the hard grin on my face as I stabbed the button on my mouse.

**\*\*YES\*\***

*\*Oooooo\**

Cat laughed as she yanked open the door with a squeal of protesting metal.  “In you go, Doc.  Five minutes and we’ll let you out.”

The Doctor made a protesting squawk as he was shoved inside, the door swiftly closing behind him.  The camera shifted to inside, and while all the cameras would automatically switch to night vision when needed, even that did little to penetrate the dark.  Breath shaking, the Doctor moved forward through what looked like a large room filled with scattered tables and chairs, as well as dark stains on the floor and flaking remnants of old police tape.  Muttering “this is bullshit” under his breath, he made his way to a partially open double-door on the other side of the room and leaned through it enough that I could see what might have been a large gym stretching out into the dark, though it was strange, because the floor didn’t look like a court, but an open hole in the ground that the Doctor was exploring with the small beam of his flashlight.

“What…what is that?  Is it like a pool or something?”

“You’re nobody til somebody lovessssss yooouuuuu”  The warbling, echoing voice seemed to come from everywhere, and when the Doctor began to scream, I had no doubt he or she was really terrified.  Running back the way they came, the Doctor started beating on the door, yelling to be let out.  Outside, I could hear the Cloak’s laughing response.

“Got two minutes left, champ.  Be brave.”

Behind us…I mean him…I could hear the sound of something moving.  Maybe something coming up out of the pool or trying to push past the door.  My heart was pounding, and I was torn between wanting the thing to come and feeling trapped with the Doctor if it came.  Another distant scraping squeal as the far door moved, and the Doctor was frantic now, crying and pounding on the door to be let out, that he’ll do anything, just let him out.

A soft sound behind, this one closer.  And then the door opened and the view switched to Cat’s camera as the Doctor ran out into the night, not stopping until he had barreled through the fence and was on the sidewalk outside the school.  Cat and Cloak couldn’t stop laughing as they followed, and when they reached him, Cat looked at me with mock shame.

“Sorry he’s such a baby.  We’ll make it up to you.  Time for a trick, baby!”

*\*Trick?\**

**\*\*YES\*\***

*\*Oooooo\**

Cloak pointed to me.  “My man!  We’re going to another spot.  Back in thirty to get our trick on.”

\*\*\*\*

When the camera’s eye opened this time, they were back in front of a house, though this one seemed more secluded than the one earlier in the night.  The Doctor’s camera showed Cat grinning at me as she gave a small wave.

“So this is where things start getting fun.  For this trick, we’re going to ring the doorbell.  If they answer and don’t give us candy right away when we ask, they get a nasty trick.”  She laughed as she waggled her fingers theatrically.  “Sound good?”

*\*Treat or trick?\**

**\*\*YES\*\***

*\*Oooooo\**

She blew a kiss into the camera.  “That’s my boy.”

\*\*\*\*

The woman who opened the door looked to be in her mid-thirties, and was pretty in a bland way.  Her expression was already hardening as all three said “treat or trick” in unison.

“Look guys, nice costumes, but my candy’s for kids.  If you want some so bad, just go down to the…”

Her words were cut off as Cat lashed out with a knife across her throat, spraying blood into the camera’s lens.  The woman’s eyes bugged out as she stumbled forward as though to grab Cat, but the Doctor lifted their foot and kicked her back through the doorway as all three of them started to roar with laughter.  They ran away into the shadows then, carrying me with them through the dark as I stared in shock at what I’d just seen.

It had to be fake, of course.  Had to be.  A staged house and location to give someone a thrill and a scare.  That’s where the money was coming in.  Actors and props and all that.  Made sense that they charged a lot.  Still, it had looked so real, and…

“Still with us, Mike?”  The Doctor’s voice was steady now, no trace of the fear from earlier in the night.

*\*Ready to continue?\**

My hand was sweaty on the mouse.  Did I want to respond at all?  And should I continue if it was going to be more fake killing?  Could I risk missing out on the opportunity to see it, to be a part of something this unique?  What if it \*was\* real?

I laughed to myself as I hit the button.

**\*\*YES\*\***

*\*Oooooo\**

Cat cheered.  “I knew you wouldn’t leave us!  Are you ready for another trick?  This one might get real nasty, so if you can’t handle it, we won’t blame you for chickening out now.  It’s up to you.”

*\*The final trick?\**

Biting my lip, I clicked **\*YES\***

Cloak nodded.  “Back in about an hour.  Hope you’re ready!”

\*\*\*\*

The next hour was the longest of my life.  I felt guilty, of course, but not as much as I’d expected.  It probably was all fake, and if it wasn’t…I was seeing into something most people couldn’t even imagine.  Getting to participate in something that most people could never do, at least not without risking going to prison.  And even if it was all real, how would they link it back to me?  And if they did, I could reasonably say I thought it was all just a Halloween game.

It was perfect.

When the screen lit up, my heart was pounding hard.  This was Cloak’s camera, and Cat and Doctor were looking at me from the shadows of what looked like another porch.  When Cat spoke, her voice was low and velvety.

“This time, it’s just a trick, but no candy involved.  We’ll go in and play with them for a good long time.  Bleed them out when we’re done.  And you’ll be there for all of it, I promise.”  She licked her lips, a thin sheen of spittle left in her tongue’s wake.  “Are you ready?  Do we go in?”

*\*Are you prepared for the Final Trick?\**

Every part of me was tensed and ready as I slid the mouse into position.

**\*\*YES\*\***

*\*Oooooo\**

*\*Oooooo\**

I looked around.  What was that?  An echo?  It’s like I heard the ghost noise outside my…
