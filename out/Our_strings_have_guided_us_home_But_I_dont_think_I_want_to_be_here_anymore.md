I instinctively took my phone out of my pocket.

It displayed some text, an essay of gibberish. The letters made sense, I could read the words, but the sentences they constructed were meaningless to me.

A message popped up.

‘Protocols updated. HRI system reset deactivated.’

Sure. Whatever that meant.

I pocketed my phone again, relieved to look at anything else. The text made my head spin, I was reading, but not understanding, and my mind struggled to deal with it.

The room I was in was dark, almost impossibly so. I looked around to gain some sense of location but couldn’t find anything that looked familiar to me. A strange lamp dangled from the ceiling, slowly rocking back and forth. The light bulb seemed to have shattered a long time ago. On the other side of the room I spotted an empty vase. The rest of the room was empty and bleak.

Wait, wasn’t it dark in here just now? How could I see the contents of the room if it were pitch black?

I looked around again, taking in the room in its entirety. The light dangling from the ceiling was emitting a bright light, allowing me to observe my surroundings.

Right, that makes sense. My mind must’ve played a trick on me before.

I stood up and walked over towards the door at the other end of the room. A small table supported a vase filled with roses, complementing the beautiful flower motif painted on the walls.

It was a pretty room, but it felt unfamiliar to me. I had to leave.

I opened the door and walked through into the green hallway again. This place seemed slightly more familiar, but only barely. The walls were painted green, and the hallway seemed to stretch on forever. This didn’t look like my house.

No, I wasn’t home. I was at work, I think. Or, I thought.

I started wandering down the hallway. There was something driving me forward, but I couldn’t grasp what it was. I had a goal, somewhere to go or something to do, but what was it?

Suddenly, my heart skipped a beat and I almost jumped into the air in fear. The hairs on my neck stood up straight and I shook slightly for a moment as I held my breath and listened closely for...

For what? And why? I listened again. There was nothing to be heard.

My heart slowly calmed down as I tried to rationalize my reaction. But could you even call it that? After all, what did I react to? Nothing happened. A reaction needs an action to come first, doesn’t it?

Perhaps this was an action then, not a reaction. I wondered what would follow it.

I took a few more steps forward, before being interrupted by a loud banging noise coming from up ahead. Something must’ve collided with something else at quite the speed for it to be this loud. How strange.

Adrenaline pumped a message into my mind. This hallway wasn’t safe. I knew this before but I didn’t now. It was never safe. The green walls would turn red if I stayed here for much longer.

I had to leave.

I started running towards the exit. Was there even an exit? There was, wasn’t there? I remembered talking with a man. We were standing next to a coffee machine, and right next to the machine was the door.

I never really liked him. He tried way to hard to impress a few of the higher ups. The sketchy ones. He didn’t care much for rules or regulations. He was a-

A distorted mechanical groan pulled me back from my thoughts. I looked to my right, my eyes landing on the coffee machine. Returning my gaze forwards, I found myself standing in front of the door.

Perfect.

I gently grasped the door handle and pulled the door open. When I entered-

…

No, that doesn’t make any sense. I pushed the door open. That’s what made the chairs fall. Yes, of course. As I pushed open the door, chairs stacked on top of each other creaked for a moment before giving in and tumbling over. Someone had barricaded the doors, or tried to anyway. Attempting to keep something out. Or perhaps in. It was a matter of perspective.

“Hello?”, I yelled out.

No response.

The room ahead of me was dark. I gasped as I bumped into something. Well, not yet, but almost. Just a few more steps and…

I bumped into something laying on the ground and audibly gasped in response. I tensed up, as if my body absolutely didn’t want to know whatever it was. Still, I had to look down eventually. That’s just how it goes.

My head reluctantly arched downwards, forcing my eyes to land on the body laying at my feet. It seemed to have been a woman, whose face seemed vaguely familiar to me somehow.

I instinctively leaned down, bringing my hand up to her face. I gently reached out, touching her cold face. But I didn’t feel her skin at all.

I felt fear.

My pulse quickened. It had gone wrong. All of it had gone wrong. They were all lost but we still had time. We could still get out but we had to go now. I grabbed whatever was closest to me, which happened to be a few chairs. I slammed the door shut and shoved a chair in front of it before stacking a few more up top for good measure.

Okay, this should hold, at least for a moment. A pang of guilt shot through me. Did I just doom all of those people still in there? I did lock them in there with… with…

No. They were dead anyway. Better to save the few by sacrificing the many than…

Than what? Nothing. I had no choice.

I turned around and pushed forwards through the office. Suddenly, shrill alarms sounded through the large room, piercing my ears painfully. Or was it screaming? Dozens of people pushed themselves past me, running towards the blaring lights and alarms, trying to get the hell away. An equal amount of people were standing motionless, screaming at the void.

Screams and alarms both. Suddenly broken up by gunfire.

I looked forward, seeing armored soldiers rushing into the office. Relief for a moment, at the realization that they were our own. They’d come here to save us, to protect all of us.

More gunfire. Colleagues falling to the ground left and right. Weapons raised at us.

Of course, there was no saving everyone. Those that had already been touched couldn’t be let out. Better to save the few by sacrificing the many.

But they weren’t the only ones here. Others rushed towards the armed soldiers. Some got shot and fell straight down, but others… others ripped right through them. Tearing them to pieces. With every second that passed the illusion slowly broke. A woman was sitting on top of one of the soldiers, who was lying down on the ground motionless.

I blinked, and the woman was gone. Replaced by something else, constantly shifting in appearance. It looked like us, at times. On arm, two arms, three arms...

I blinked. The woman was back.

What was going on?

My heart stopped in fear as the realization slowly hit me.

No. Not in fear.

In pain.

I looked down.

It looked strange, wrong. I brought my hands up to my chest. They turned red.

Blood. My blood.

This was it. I had been touched, which made me unsavable. I would die here. I had to die here. Every job had its risks, I suppose. I took another look at the horrible situation around me as my life flowed away out of my chest. I was dying. I was dead.

But was I?

That doesn’t make any sense either, does it. If I’m dead, I wouldn’t be able to make it to the red room.

My face distorts with confusion. I struggle to understand my own thoughts. I don’t even know what the red room is.

Which means I haven’t been there yet. But I do. Or will be there, anyway.

Which in turn, means I can’t die. Right?

I looked down again.

A motionless face stares back at me. A woman. It seems she’s dead.

My eyes drift down her neck towards her chest. Her shirt is covered in dried blood, and there seems to be a hole in it. A faint spark of recognition crosses through my mind, but quickly fades away again. I’m uncertain, but whatever happened here makes me feel uneasy.

I stood up again.

The giant room made me feel uncomfortable. I saw shadowy figures scattered everywhere, lying on the floor, but every time I tried to focus on them, it’s like my gaze went right through them.

A buzzer rang out as something crashed against the door I’d barricaded earlier. I swung back around, but the improvised barricade seemed to hold for now.

It was time to leave.

With every step I took, more and more figures dashed away into the corner of my eyes. Whenever I looked, they weren’t actually there, of course, allowing me to calm myself down.

Just a trick of the light.

I walked through a set of doors, leading into another corridor. I winced as I saw something small lying on the ground. A sharp pain shot through my right arm as I leaned over to inspect it.

It was my arm.

What? No it wasn’t. It was someone else’s arm.

I briefly wondered what kind of thing would cause someone’s arm to be taken off completely, but swiftly concluded I didn’t really want to know right now.

Standing back up, I continued walking. The fog occupying my mind grew. Or did it recede? Either way, I could remember what we were doing now. I was going home. That was it. I’m documenting my way home for you. For you to join us and complete our work.

“hello?”, a voice suddenly echoed out from somewhere further down the corridor.

I froze in place. Someone else was still alive here? I hesitated for a moment. How could I be certain that it wasn’t some kind of trick? Perhaps it was better to keep going on my own. I seemed to have been doing all right so far.

A man walked into view from the shadows ahead of me.

“coworker?”, it asked/stated.

“coworker”, I replied immediately. It was strange, the word almost seemed to have left my mouth before I even had the intent to say it.

“Do you know what’s going on?”, I whispered, suddenly painfully aware we were quite vulnerable in this corridor. It was best not to make too much noise.

The man’s eyes seemed hazy for a moment as he considered my question. He eventually shook his head. Guess I was no further to uncovering what the hell happened to this place.

“we have to go home”, he eventually responded.

I nodded enthusiastically. Maybe this man couldn’t give me any insight on the situation, but our goals seemed to align at least. We did have to go home. It wasn’t safe here. We couldn’t do anything here anymore. It was all lost already. All that was left to do was to return home.

Another noise from up ahead. The man swung around instantly as I focused on my hearing. There was something, someone, up ahead. I just knew it. But who? Or what?

“monster”, the man whispered as he looked back around with an expression of fear mixed with determination. “we must not let it get out of here. it can not know”

My heart froze for a moment. So there were creatures on the loose in here. How? Where had they come from. Vague memories were clawing at the back of my mind, begging me to accept their explanations. But I couldn’t. They were too far away, and this was no time for meditation. We couldn’t let this thing get out, whatever it was. That was our job, wasn’t it?

The man suddenly lurched forwards, disappearing into the shadows. I couldn’t let him go in alone, so I did the same. We rushed through the halls, turning around corners every now and then. We rushed through a kitchen, a closet, and right down another office. I wondered for a moment how the man knew where to go, but the weird thing was that I already understood in a way. I also knew where to go.

I could almost hear the monster now. Their breaths, their footsteps.

We found it.

It was disgusting to look at. Pure hatred in a physical form. Their body almost looked human, but it wasn’t enough to fool us. Their figure was shifting constantly, and their face a contorted mess of different people.

It was holding some kind of large firearms, standing over a disfigured body. It was us. The lifeless body was missing its arm, causing a wave of anger to wash over me.

The creature let out an awful scream before it tried to raise its gun towards me. I froze on the spot, but the man immediately jumped against the creature, causing the gun to shift slightly before firing. A stream of bullets pierced through my shoulder, making me stumble backwards and let out a hateful shriek.

I saw the man momentarily grasp for his shoulder as well, before bringing his fists down onto the creature’s face. He then snarled as he opened his mouth and lunged downwards.

I joined him.

There’s no need to describe the details.

We couldn’t let the monster leave. It’s that simple.

We had to go home. It was time to leave.

The man looked at me but didn’t speak. He didn’t need to, we both knew.

We stood up and started walking. We were close now. The job was done.

The hallways started to look more familiar with every step. Many of us had walked these hallways before, so it was easy to find our way. Somewhere in the distance another alarm went off, but it wasn’t of concern to us no more. We were too close to our home. Someone else would take care of it.

“home”, the man spoke as he stopped in front of a door. There was the faintest hint of uncertainty in his voice now.

“home”, I echoed unwillingly.

I stepped forward. There was no going back now.

I opened the door. Or did it open on its own? The room beyond had been completely coated in some red fluid. The red room. I would’ve been shocked at such a gruesome sight, but we had seen it before, so we weren’t. I briefly looked over my shoulder, but the man was nowhere to be seen. Did he not want to go home? Was he not ready yet?

Whatever. His loss.

I stepped forward.

The room was huge. A dark mass writhing all around. Home. We were hanging in the air. Dozens of us, all being kept up in the air like puppets, attached to massive tendrils. Home. This was home. But was it? Memories clawing at the back of my mind, more intensely now. Desperate for my attention, clawing so strongly they must be tearing my brain apart. They shoot doubts into my mind, attacking the fog. This is not home. But that can’t be.

A faint realization. My mind is not my own. My hand reaches up to the side of my neck, looking for it, the button, the injection. The claws in my brain wrestling to stay in control, desperately pushing against my neck, looking for it, yearning to be reset. Eventually it finds the button, and pushes and pushes and pushes. A click and a stab and my mind will go blank.

But it doesn’t happen. The system fails, or it’s gone, or perhaps it was never there to begin with.

The claws recede, give up, get beaten back by the fog. They know they lost, and the other knows it’s won.

It seems like I’m going home after all.

I stepped forward.

Something leans down from up high. An empty string. Reserved for me. My home.

It reaches out for me. It makes me reach out for it. I realize this string isn’t empty. It’s mine.

A last moment of clarity before it’s done. A single claw recognizes the area I’m in. Not a room, but a panopticon. A large number, almost completely obscured by the mass, is still visible on a wall somewhere. It reads P02. The claw pushes down into my mind and tells me what I don’t know. Where I am.

I grabbed my phone and finished what I’d been documenting. My journey home. Originally written to keep you away, or perhaps to lure you in.

Now written so I can be found. The string reaches out for me, vaguely realizing what I am doing. It sees what I’m doing, but it doesn’t understand. And it’s hurting our brains.

The last claw starts to lose its grip. I’ve finally made up my mind, mere seconds before I am about to lose it.

It’s time to publish my journey. Please come find me.

I don’t think I want to go home anymore.
