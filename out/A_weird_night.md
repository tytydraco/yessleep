I live in a small, suburban town. No big buildings, or anything like that, really rural. Me, and my friend Ethan have been really into walking recently. Nothing really about exercise, mainly to get outside and off of video games. One day on a Sunday morning I texted him and asked if he wanted to walk around. He said yes. We went to the school and then to the football field, which is something we would normally do. It was a decent walk, and it usually took about 45 minutes to an hour to complete. We would also mess around at the track field from time to time. We were pretty exhausted so we both went home and took a nap.

 That same day, he texted me this time and asked if I wanted to do it again, but at night this time. We were both big into walking around at night, as it was quiet and there usually weren't many people around. And tonight wasn't too hot so we thought it was perfect. I rode to his apartment on my electric scooter, and left it in his backyard. As we walked to the school we were talking about stupid things, making jokes about people we knew, stupid teenager stuff. By the time we got to the school the sun was already setting, so we went to the Middle School playground, which was open and started messing around there for a bit. 

  
We didn't have the chance to stay around there for very long before a group of highschoolers showed up and we decided we would just mind our own business, and leave. Not very far from the playground was this yellow scaffolding I guess you could call it. It was just a small lift that the band teachers used to watch people in band during practice. No one was there, so we climbed it and sat up there for a minute. It was nice, we were taking pictures and having a pretty normal conversation until more people started walking by. The school had this stupid "Pirate Path" thing that all the rich people who lived around there would walk. The Middle School, Elementary school, and Highschool were all in the same building, so it was a pretty large school. All one story though. Anyway we ended up debating if we wanted to leave or not, before we saw a car start to drive slowly and we saw a bunch of camera flashes from the passenger windows, before the drove off quickly. I yelled something stupid, and they stopped, and then kept driving. Ethan wanted to leave, so we did. 

As we climbed down we decided to walk to the Track field and mess around there, as the sun was setting and neither of us had a curfew. Since we were both tired I just slipped underneath the fence and Ethan jumped it. It was completely black out at this point. We got on some kinda pad that was used to land on during sports and started jumping around and acting stupid. Ethan then stopped and pointed and said "Look." There was what looked to be an old lady walking laps around the track field. We didn't care and kept minding our own business. When she passed us she started talking to us. She said "You boys wouldn't mind waiting 25 minutes would you?" 

We both assumed she just didn't wanna be alone out here, which was reasonable. So we said yeah and kept doing stupid things. From the track field you can see the football field's parking lot. There was a group of maybe teenagers, young adults, I don't know who sat there and played music all night. They chased Ethan with flashlights and their cars one time when he was with our other friend, Jay, so he was already on edge. He thought he heard a loud pop or something from the bleachers, and was genuinely paranoid. Once in a few laps the lady would say something to us. After about 20 minutes, I was ready to go but Ethan didn't wanna be mean and leave her. He pointed to her in the darkness to where you could barely see her and said "She just has like one more lap man, come on." 

So we decided to wait. After a minute we realized, after she had walked behind a small shed, she hadn't come back. We started joking that she had vanished, but after a few more minutes we decided to walk over there with our phone flashlights and see if she was alright. To our shock, she was gone. We had been watching her because I wanted to leave, and she was just gone. There wasn't another entrance where she had stopped, and the only way she could have left was by hopping the fence, which considering she looked too old to even be walking in the first place we quickly crossed that out. After that, we started to get on edge. It was pitch black and this woman had just disappeared. However, we saw that there were 2 cars driving towards us. Ethan announced it was the people who chased him, and they jumped out of their cars, and started sprinting towards us, screaming slurs. 

We bolted for the fence. My heart was pounding this entire time, as nothing like this had ever happened to me before. We ran for about 20 minutes. We had lost them but were still in a panic. We took a different road to avoid them seeing us, and walked past the house of a girl we knew. She didn't really like us, or me in particular but we were scared so we contemplated knocking. We ended up not and just sat on her step for a few minutes, assessing what just happened.

We were wondering if the people taking a picture of us earlier were the same people who had chased us, but we chalked it up to a coincidence. We were even more confused about where that woman had gone, and we hadn't got much time to think about it with everything that just happened. We tried to lighten the mood by joking that we were going crazy. We ended up walking through a neighborhood made up of mainly old people, and found ourselves right outside a fence that led to Ethan's apartment. I jumped it pretty easily, but Ethan had hurt his ankle a few weeks back so he had a harder time. We went into the local Giovannis and got a bag of chips. We kept discussing what had happened, and both agreed to not tell anyone as we knew they wouldn't believe us. I rode home by myself on my scooter, and just got home a little bit ago. I still don't know who took a picture of us, and if it was connected to the people who chased us, where the woman went, or what happened. All I know is that I probably won't be back near the parking lot after dark again for a while.
