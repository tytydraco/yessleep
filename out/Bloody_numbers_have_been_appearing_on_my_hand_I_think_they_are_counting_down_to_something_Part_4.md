I waited for hours at a time in between sessions of doctors and assistants coming into my room/cell and running diagnostics on me. Always taking blood samples and generally working around me but not acknowledging my questions about who they were and what the hell was going on.

All of the people working in the room would not identify themselves and I had no idea what organization these people were really from.

The lead doctor had been in several times to check on the progress of whatever work they were trying to accomplish. I had managed to overhear a whisper referring to the man as Doctor Stillman.

I asked him again when he had come in to check on the latest blood test,

"What is happening to me? Where is Cassandra? Did you take her as well?"

I could not read his face behind the protective gear but there was a distressing pause and he finally responded.

"We are not sure, this is a novel process to us. We only just discovered this particular strain and it is quite aggressive. That is why we have had to take such direct and immediate action to quell whatever trouble this thing could cause. I am afraid that is all I can tell you at the moment. Unfortunately for you and a few others, the cause and cure for this affliction has to be discovered at any cost. The rights of a few people may have to be trampled on slightly, for the greater good."

I asked again, disturbed by the answer, more so the non answer to the other part of my question.

"Where is Cass? Did you take her as well? What are you going to do?"

There was silence and Stillman looked at his watch and turned to leave. Before I could shout the question again he looked back at me as he was leaving the room and cut me off,

"She was likely contaminated by your last encounter with her. She is being looked after by our staff and monitored for symptoms, but anyone who comes into contact with these things cannot be allowed to roam free."

He walked out of the room and the staff departed with him, leaving me alone with the silence and despair of the situation. I felt guilty and sick. I had cut Cass when I tried to leave and no I had gotten her sick too. What were they going to do to her?

As I began to spiral I felt the wave of heat in my blood rise again. I tried to calm myself down but it felt like something was going to break free from my skin. I strained against my restraints and this time as I writhed I felt an odd sensation of quiet come over my mind and the room was still.

Then a creeping whisperer was heard in the back of my mind. I froze as I realized it was speaking to me.

"One...of....our.....blood.....leave.....now...."

My mind raced and my skin prickled at the ominous voice speaking into my mind. Even if I wanted to follow the instructions of the creepy voice, I had no means to break out.

I suddenly felt like I was not alone in the room, yet the door had not opened. I heard scratching on the glass of the only window and saw a disturbing outline of a figure through the shrouded glass. Then I heard a terrible wet squishing sound, like someone wading through muck and grime and even worse things.

I tried to move and couldn't. Then I felt sick, very sick. I felt a bulge welling up in my throat and before I stop myself, I spat out a gob of blood that land near my hand and to my surprise and horror it started to move! I felt a bit of pain and heard a hissing sound and then was amazed when my range of motion had increased.

I felt the restraints loosen and then fall off completely and I heard the ragged sound of breath coming from something in the room that did not sound like it possessed human lungs.

I was free but too scared to move. I started to think maybe I should not leave. Whatever this was could be too dangerous to be let out. But I thought of Cassandra and everything that had happened and I felt the urge to leave again, to find her and get her back. The compulsion overrode my fear and concern and without looking at the disturbing figure in the room who had set me free I burst out of the room in a run. I had managed to knock the door down in my flight.

Despite being barred from the outside I had managed to break it down with minimal effort and as I sprinted thru the hall, my ears started to ring and my conscious thought began to fade to the point where it felt like I was dreaming.

I kept moving and as the feeling became so distant I thought I would fall asleep on my own feet, like I was fully in auto pilot to my own body. I dimly remember two scientists trying to stop me, worse still I remember how much I seemed to enjoy the taste of their blood and the feeling of tearing them apart.

Yes it was a vivid nightmare, but the nightmare was only beginning.

The sound of a blaring alarm knocked me back to my senses and I looked down at the medical gown I had been wearing. It was torn and covered in blood. Before I could react in the proper horror to the scene before me, the voice in my head spoke again.

"We....are....not....here....she.....is....not....here........bring.......us.....together......soon......go"

I had no idea what I had done or what was happening. I only knew that the voice was right and that Cass was gone. The path behind me was covered in blood and I knew it was not my own. I had done something monstrous, but I did not care just then. I only knew I had to leave, I had to find her.

I left the building in short order and stepped out into the morning sun.

The light reflected off the bright sheen on my skin that showed the bloody mark resembled a four now. Four days left to find Cass and find a way to stop whatever was going to happen to us.
