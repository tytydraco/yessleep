I should have realized something was wrong when they offered me thirty dollars an hour to deliver food.

Now, six months into this hellish job, I still tell myself that. But back then, staring at my maxed-out bank account and the eviction notice on my apartment door, thirty dollars an hour felt like a godsend. The only condition was that I couldn't quit for three years. Three years of guaranteed pay would have solved all my financial problems.

The interview was brief. Really, very brief. A woman named Cassandra sat across from me. The office smelled faintly of disinfectant, and there was another, indescribable odor—something organic, with a hint of decay. She didn't ask about my work experience or references. She simply pushed a contract onto the table and pointed to the signature area.

“The pay is very good,” she said in a flat, professional tone. “This job is demanding. You'll encounter some seemingly unusual situations. Follow the rules strictly, and you'll be fine. Are you okay with that?”

I signed. Looking back, I can't believe I signed without even reading the pay terms.

On my first day at work, I arrived at the warehouse in the east of the city. It was a massive concrete building with no windows, only a steel door. The fluorescent lights inside blared, making my teeth ache. A supervisor named Marcus Bain handed me an insulated delivery bag, a company phone, and a small red booklet.

“Read this,” he said, tapping the booklet with his nicotine-covered fingers. “Read every word. Carry it with you at all times. Follow the instructions strictly. No improvisation. No shortcuts. No exceptions.”

The booklet was titled “First-Class Courier Delivery Procedures Manual.” The cover was made of some kind of leather, unsettlingly warm to the touch, as if it had just been taken from a living creature.

“This is ridiculous,” I muttered, flipping through the densely packed rules, each one more outrageous than the last.

Marcus grabbed my wrist. Despite the damp, stifling heat of the warehouse, his hand was icy cold. “Eric, right? I need to make this clear. This job pays so much because it’s abnormal. You signed a contract. You can’t quit for three years. So you only have two choices: either follow the rules and keep your job, or ignore the rules… well, I haven’t seen anyone ignore the rules in six months. I don’t know what happened to the last one. None of us know.”

Before I could respond, he released my wrist and walked away.

For the next hour, I sat in my car reading the manual, my stomach tightening with each page. The company slogan was embossed in red on the inside cover: “We deliver for any living thing.” I thought it was just a marketing gimmick. I was wrong.

My first order arrived at 2:47 p.m. The company phone rang, and an address appeared on the screen: St. Agnes Hospital, 13th floor, Room 000.

I pulled up the building information. St. Agnes Hospital had been abandoned for fifteen years after a patient murdered three nurses and a doctor before hanging himself in the pediatric ward. This hospital only has twelve floors.

I opened the brochure and found the section labeled "Hospital—St. Agnes," my hands trembling.

The instructions were very clear:

1. Park your car on the loading dock at the back of the building. Never use the main entrance.

2. Enter through the service door. The door is open. If the door is locked, leave immediately and report to the dispatch center.

3. Use the stairs to go to the second floor (do not use the elevator, even if it appears to be working).

4. On the second floor, find room 666. Knock thirteen times. Wait silently for thirty seconds.

5. Find room 333. Knock thirteen times. Wait silently for thirty seconds.

6. Return to the stairwell. You will find a new staircase leading upstairs that wasn't there before. Don't be surprised. Don't look back at the corridor you just left.

7. Go up this staircase. It will be completely dark inside. Do not use a flashlight or your phone's light. Walk steadily upwards. You might hear breathing sounds that aren't yours. Keep going.

8. You'll feel a noticeable drop in temperature. When you see your breath condense in front of you, you're almost there.

9. At the end of the stairs is a door marked with the number 13. Open that door.

10. Place the delivery bag on the floor inside the threshold. The floor might feel strange under your feet—soft, warm, and slightly pulsating. This is normal. Don't investigate it.

11. Put the bag down and leave immediately. Don't look into the room. If anything speaks to you, don't respond. Run down the stairs as quickly as possible.

12. Once you reach the second floor, the stairs behind you will disappear. Leave the building immediately.

I read the instructions three times, hoping to understand something. It still didn't work. The delivery bag contained only one meal: a nearly raw steak, soaking in blood. The smell made me nauseous.

The St. Agnes Building looked like a tombstone. The lower floors were covered in graffiti, several windows were shattered, and shards of glass glistened in the dim afternoon light. I parked my car in the loading area as instructed, and the silence became suffocating the moment I turned off the engine. No birdsong, no traffic noise, nothing at all.

The back door was unlocked, as expected. The rusty hinges screeched as the door opened, echoing in the empty hallway. A stench hit me—mold, decay, and, beneath it all, the smell of rotting organic matter I'd detected in Ms. Cassandra's office.

I switched on my phone's flashlight, illuminating the darkness, and found the stairwell. Peeling paint was everywhere on the walls. As I climbed to the second floor, I swear I heard footsteps moving upstairs, the sound perfectly synchronized with mine.

The second-floor hallway stretched endlessly in two directions. The emergency exit signs flashed a sickly yellow. I first found room 666. Its door was painted black, unmarked except for a brass number that seemed to gleam in my flashlight beam.

I knocked thirteen times, my knuckles echoing like gunshots in the silence. After the thirteenth knock, I heard something moving inside—a massive object, dragging itself across the floor with a wet, scraping sound.

Thirty seconds felt like thirty hours. I stared at the timer on my phone, watching the second hand tick by, while the thing behind the door continued its slow movement, drawing ever closer.

When the timer showed thirty seconds, the thing suddenly stopped moving.

Room 333 was at the end of the corridor. I walked towards it, only to find my footsteps no longer echoing. The sound seemed to vanish into the surrounding air, as if the hospital had swallowed all my noise.

I knocked thirteen times on the door of room 333. This time, the response was completely different. A child's clear, bright laughter echoed from the room. Then, another child's laughter joined in. Then a third. Soon, dozens of children's laughter came from behind the door, their voices layered, distorted, and rising in pitch until they finally merged into a piercing scream that made my ears ring.

I ran back to the stairwell as instructed, following behind without looking back, even as the laughter reverberated through the corridor like a living thing.

The stairwell door slammed shut behind me, and I found myself in complete darkness. My flashlight was still on. I could see the beam cutting through the air, but it illuminated nothing. The darkness swallowed the light like a black hole.

Then I saw it: the new staircase leading upwards. I could see it because it was deeper than the surrounding darkness, like a negative space in the void.

I put away my phone and began to climb upwards in the darkness.

From what was probably the fifth floor, the sound of breathing filled the air. My breathing was slow and rhythmic, like some enormous creature drawing air into lungs that shouldn't exist. It came from all directions, from above, below, and even from inside the walls. I continued climbing, one hand gripping the railing, the other clutching the takeout bag tightly.

Around the twentieth step, my breath began to condense into mist. The temperature plummeted. My fingers went numb. My breathing grew louder and more rapid, as if the source of the sound sensed my approach.

Something brushed against my shoulder, cold and damp, feeling like fingers made of ice water. I suppressed a scream and continued climbing.

A door suddenly appeared before me, marked with the number "13" in brass, emitting a faint, sickly glow. I flung it open.

The floor immediately felt off. The brochure had warned me, but the reality was completely unexpected. The floor was hot, almost feverish, vibrating slightly under my feet in rhythm with my heartbeat. The touch was like stepping on bare, untreated muscle tissue.

I dropped my bag and ran, afraid to look into the room, though I glimpsed something large and pale moving in the darkness outside the threshold.

As I ran down the stairs, I heard wet chewing sounds from upstairs, accompanied by groans—groans that could be ecstasy or agony. I ran until I reached the back door and rushed into the loading area before stopping. The sun was setting, and the city was returning to its usual hustle and bustle.

The phone buzzed. "Delivery confirmed. $87.50 has been deposited into your account."

I sat in my car for twenty minutes, trembling, before finally being able to drive away.

The second order that made my impression came three days later.

At 11:47 p.m., the phone rang. Blackstone Castle, door-to-door delivery.

I opened the brochure with trembling hands and found the relevant section.

1. Head to the warehouse stables. Yes, we have horses. Choose the gray mare named "Patience." She knows the way.

2. Load the goods into the saddlebags. The castle cannot be reached by car. You must ride a horse.

3. Follow the path behind the warehouse. It will lead you through the woods. The entire journey will take approximately forty minutes. Do not stray from the path.

4. You may see figures in the woods. They will call to you, and sometimes you will recognize their voices. Do not respond. Do not look directly at them. Pay attention to Patience's ears.

5. The castle gates will open. Ride through the gates into the courtyard.

6. The well is located in the center of the courtyard. Dismount, but do not tether Patience. She will wait for you.

7. Approach the well. You will hear various sounds coming from it—voices, music, and laughter. These are echoes of the castle's history; they are harmless.

8. Throw the delivery bags into the well. You will not hear the bags hitting the bottom. This is normal.

9. There will be a response from the bottom of the well. It could be talking, singing, or screaming. Don't try to understand what it's saying. Don't look into the well.

10. Return to Patience immediately. She will gallop back to the barn. Hold on tight and don't look back at the castle.

11. If you see lights on in the castle windows, ride faster.

The barn and stables are behind a door I hadn't noticed before, marked only by a small horseshoe. The air inside smells of hay and horses, a surprisingly normal, almost comforting scent.

There are four horses in the stable, but only one is gray. As I approach, Patience looks at me with her deep, intelligent eyes. I open her stable door, and she neighs softly, pressing her nose against my chest as if in sympathy.

"You've done this before, haven't you, young lady?" I whisper.

She hums, seemingly in agreement.

The offering is simple: a covered pot, radiating warmth and the aroma of herbs and meat. Whatever was inside, it was for someone who still preferred a hot stew.

The trail began, as described in the brochure, as a narrow dirt road winding into the dense forest behind the warehouse. As soon as Pattynes ​​stepped onto this path, the city lights went out, and we were surrounded by thick trees, unable to see even the stars.

Pattynes ​​moved with steady steps, her hooves softly pressed down on the soft earth. My gaze remained fixed on her ears, watching them turn, listening to the sounds of the surrounding forest.

Ten minutes into the ride, the first sound came.

“Eric?”

It was my mother's voice. My mother, who had died of cancer two years ago.

“Eric, baby, where are you going? Come here. I miss you so much.”

My eyes welled with tears, but I kept my gaze focused on the horse's ears. The voice came from the depths of the woods to my left.

“Please, Eric. Don’t you want to see me one last time? I’m right here. Look at me. Just once.”

Patience pressed her ear to my head and quickened her pace to a jog. The voice followed us, growing more desperate and more urgent.

“You left me to die! You weren’t there when I needed you! You should at least look at me!”

These accusations pierced my heart like knives, because some of them were true. I had missed the last few days of her life; I hadn’t returned until the very last week, stuck in another state, working a job I was going to lose anyway. Guilt gnawed at me like a living, breathing thing.

But I didn’t look at her.

Other voices joined my mother’s. My ex-girlfriend, my high school best friend who had moved away, and my father, whom I hadn’t heard from in five years. They were all calling to me from the darkness, some pleading, some accusing, and some just sobbing in pain.

Patience started to jog, and I gripped the reins tightly, burying my face in her mane, trying to block out the voices. I glimpsed figures moving through the woods, their gait unsteady, their limbs clumsy, and their faces slightly elongated.

Thank goodness, the forest had finally come to an end, and we had reached a clearing.

The castle stood before us, like a decayed tooth. Three of its four towers had collapsed, and ivy completely covered the walls, as if the forest were slowly swallowing it up. But as the brochure had said, the gates were open, the rusty iron doors twisted into various shapes.

We entered the courtyard, our pace gradually slowing. Moonlight filled the courtyard, bright enough to cast clear shadows. The well, a circular stone structure with an iron roof, stood in the center of the courtyard.

I dismounted, my legs trembling, and carried the delivery bag toward the well. Before I even reached it, sounds rang out. I was already halfway there.

First came laughter, the elegant, clear laughter of nobles at a banquet. Then came music, a string quartet playing a complex Baroque piece. People spoke languages ​​I couldn't understand, their voices mingling and overlapping. The sound of horses' hooves on pebbles. The cries of children. Women singing lullabies. Men shouting commands. The clanging of swords. Someone praying in Latin.

It was as if all the sounds that had ever occurred in this place were simultaneously emanating from the well, compressed, superimposed, merging into a chaotic symphony—it should have been unbearable, but for some reason, it wasn't. It was almost beautiful.

I walked to the well and held the delivery bag to the opening. The well was pitch black, as if a void was pulling at my eyes, forcing me to look deeper.

I released the bag.

There was no sound of the bag falling to the bottom. It was as if the echoes of history were playing back, growing louder and more frantic.

Then, a voice answered me.

A voice from the abyss, speaking an ancient language. It wasn't speaking to me; it was speaking through me, and I could feel its sound vibrating in the soft tissues of my bones, teeth, and internal organs. Its meaning It passed through my consciousness, reaching a primal part of my brain, a place that understands hunger, darkness, and the patience of those who live forever in the abyss.

It was saying thank you.

I ran back to Patience, and out of pure fear, I smoothly mounted her. She needed no urging, turned, and charged toward the gate, her hooves sparking on the cobblestones.

As we galloped through the gate, I made a mistake; I glanced back.

Every window in the castle was filled with light. Candles, torches—the whole building radiated a warm glow, brimming with life and celebration. I could see shadows moving behind the glass; people were dancing and dining.

In the highest window of the last remaining tower, a figure watched us. It was incredibly tall, and even from this distance, I could see its head was oddly shaped. Too narrow, too long, and wearing something on its head, like antlers.

It raised an arm, as if waving, or perhaps offering a blessing.

Patience galloped faster than any horse I'd ever seen before, the forest on either side fading into a blur of darkness. We only slowed down when we saw the lights of a warehouse ahead.

I'd just dismounted when my phone buzzed. "$134.50 has been deposited into your account."

Before the theater delivery, I'd done two months of normal deliveries, or rather, the normality of the job. An order was left on a doorstep; no one answered, but the door opened automatically thirty seconds after I left. A midnight delivery to a cemetery, placed on a specific tombstone, with singing in the distance. A package was handed to a taxi driver who didn't say a word; I looked at him for five seconds and couldn't remember what he looked like.

But all of that was manageable. Terrifying, but manageable.

The theater delivery was different.

2:17 AM, phone buzzing. Theater District subway station, platform 7.

The section about this delivery in the brochure is longer and more detailed than the others, with appendices and footnotes in different handwriting, as if several deliverymen have added warnings over the years.

1. The Theater District subway station has six platforms. Platform 7 is only open between 2:00 AM and 4:00 AM. You must complete the delivery within this timeframe.

2. Enter through the main entrance on 7th Street. Station staff will not assist you. This is normal.

3. Purchase a token from the machine. Tokens are required; debit cards are not accepted. The machine only accepts cash. Insert exactly $2.75.

4. Go down to Platform 1. Walk to the end, which is at the tunnel entrance. There is a door marked "Employee Only - Platform 7." This door will be open during delivery hours.

5. The stairs behind this door are deeper than usual. Count the steps. If there are more than 127, you've gone too far. Return to the top and start again.

6. Platform 7 is empty. It is always empty. If you see anyone else on platform 7, leave immediately and report to the dispatch center. Do not deliver goods.

7. Walk to the center of the platform. You will see a bench that is different from the other station furniture. It is older, ornately decorated, made of dark wood, and has brass fittings. Place your delivery items on this bench.

8. A train will arrive in three minutes. This train is not on the timetable and is not a regular subway train.

9. There may be passengers in the carriage. Do not make eye contact with anyone in the carriage. If they talk to you or gesture to you, do not respond.

10. The doors will not open. This is intentional. Passengers will take packages from the bench in some unknown way. You do not need to know the specific method.

11. After the train departs, wait a full sixty seconds, then return the way you came. Do not run. Running will attract attention.

12. Deliveryman J.M.'s tip: Trains sometimes stop at the wrong spot. If the door coincides with where you are standing, close your eyes and count to thirty. Don't open your eyes, no matter what you hear or feel.

13. Deliveryman D.R.'s tip: I heard someone calling my name in the train car. I accidentally responded. Three days later, I heard the same sound coming from my closet. I moved. I suggest you strictly follow the rules.

The package was a white cardboard box, sealed with red tape. It was heavier than it looked, and the contents made a wet, slippery sound when I picked it up. The box was cold, colder than a warehouse freezer.

At this time, the subway station was deserted, save for the buzzing and flashing fluorescent lights. The ticket booth attendant was an old man reading a newspaper, and as the pamphlet said, his gaze never left the paper as I passed.

The automatic ticket machine mechanically swallowed my banknotes and spat out a brass token that looked like it came from another era. The token bore an unfamiliar subway system logo; the metal was warm in my palm.

Platform 1 was deserted, the tiles gleaming under the glaring lights. I walked towards the end of the tunnel, my footsteps echoing, each echo accompanied by a new sound—another set of footsteps, slightly out of sync with mine, coming from a direction I couldn't discern.

A door marked "Employees Only—Platform 7" stood out starkly against the concrete and steel of the station, for it was made of wood. The wood was a deep, almost black color, carved with symbols that were almost unbearable to look at.

Behind the door, a spiral staircase descended, the walls on either side pressed tightly against the floor. I counted each step aloud, my voice weak, swallowed by the enclosed space.

"Twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine…"

The air grew colder and more oppressive, carrying the smell of metal and electricity.

“Sixty-three, sixty-four, sixty-five…”

I heard music coming from above or below—I thought, jazz, the kind played in underground bars during Prohibition.

“Ninety-nine, one hundred, one hundred and one…”

My phone died at step one hundred and twelve, plunging me into darkness, with only the intermittent flashing of the emergency light.

“One hundred and twenty-three, one hundred and twenty-four, one hundred and twenty-five, one hundred and twenty-six, one hundred and twenty-seven.”

The bottom door was modern, like other emergency exits in the subway system. I pushed it open.

Something was off about Platform 7, but it wasn't immediately obvious. Its dimensions were wrong. Too long and too narrow, the ceiling too high. The color of the tiles on the walls was wrong too—a deep burgundy that no urban planner would approve. And it was eerily silent, as if the platform were in a mysterious space where sound couldn't travel normally.

The bench was in the center of the platform, just as described. It had a rustic beauty, like furniture in a mansion, not a subway station. The brass fittings gleamed, and the wood was intricately carved with patterns—I thought they resembled vines, or perhaps snakes.

I placed the white box on the bench and stepped back.

The wait was agonizing. My watch showed 2:34 AM. I still had time, plenty of time before the delivery deadline, but every second felt like an hour. The silence was oppressive, making my eardrums ache. I began to perceive my breathing and heartbeat with unusual clarity.

At 2:37 AM, I felt it first, then heard it—a vibration in the air, the change in air pressure making my ears ring. Then came the sound: the distinctive rumble of an approaching train.

The train emerging from the tunnel wasn't modern. It was old, incredibly old, like a relic from the early days of the subway. The carriages were made of dark wood and brass, bathed in warm yellow light. Through the windows, I could see the passengers.

My blood froze instantly.

The passengers were dressed in clothing from different eras. A woman wore a 1920s-style modern dress. A man wore a Victorian-era suit. A child wore tattered clothes from the Great Depression. A soldier wore a World War II uniform. They sat or stood, swaying slightly with the train's movement, each staring intently at me.

Something was off about their expressions. Not obviously, not in a way I could articulate, but something felt off—their proportions, their expressions, even the rhythm of their blinks.

The train slowed, slower and slower. For a moment, I even thought it would stop right in front of me, the doors right in front of me. Just as I was about to cover my eyes, the train suddenly moved forward three feet and stopped.

The doors didn't open. But passengers by the windows pressed their hands against the glass, their handprints condensing into fog on the cold surface. Some laughed. Others stared intently out the window, their gazes focused and heavy. The feeling sent chills down my spine.

In the car closest to me, a woman mouthed something to me. I couldn't hear her through the glass, but I could read her lips: "Can you hear me?"

I turned my face away, my gaze fixed on the floor, my hands clenched into fists at my sides.

Something was knocking on the window. A rapid, urgent knock, as if trying to get my attention.

I didn't turn around.

More knocking came from several windows, the intermittent rhythm sounding almost like Morse code. Then came voices, somewhat muffled through the glass but still clearly audible, all at once:

"Look at us."

"We just want to talk."

"Don't be so rude."

"Eric? Eric, is that you?"

The last voice made me shudder. It sounded like my mother's voice again, but distorted, as if coming from a broken speaker.

“Eric, darling, I’m right here. I’ve been waiting for you. Look at me. Just this once, please.”

I tried not to look up, my eyes burning. I silently counted down the seconds, trying to block out the sounds.

The white box on the bench was gone. I didn’t see it disappear, I didn’t hear it, it was just gone.

The sounds stopped abruptly. The train jerked off, slowly at first, then gradually accelerating until it disappeared into the tunnel on the other side of the platform. The rumble faded into the distance, and I was once again alone in absolute silence.

I counted to sixty, each number feeling like a small victory. Then I walked. Not running, though my instincts screamed at me to sprint back to the door, up the 127 steps, across the station, and into the city night, where the air had never tasted so sweet.

I had just reached the ground when my phone rang. “$203.75 has been deposited into your account.”

I probably have one or two more stories to tell, but more orders have come in, so I'll be back.
