I saw a therapist for eight years. Let’s call him Dr. P.

He came highly recommended—people said he was sharp, analytical, didn’t sugarcoat things. That sounded like exactly what I needed.

At first, I admired him. He had a way of making me feel like he understood me completely, like he could see through my thoughts better than I could myself. His approach was firm, sometimes dismissive, but he framed it as “challenging my thinking.” I figured he knew what he was doing.

But as the years went on, something felt off.

It wasn’t any one thing—it was little moments. Times when I left his office feeling more uncertain, more dependent on his approval than when I walked in. He questioned my memory often. If I recalled something a certain way, he would shake his head and say, “That’s not how it happened.”

He had this way of planting doubt, making me wonder if my own thoughts were unreliable. He contradicted me about things I was sure of—delayed diagnoses, shifting explanations, making me feel like I was misinterpreting my own experiences.

And then there was the phone call.

I had been venting about my stress, how I always felt on edge, like I was waiting for something bad to happen. I told him I’d been checking my phone constantly, expecting bad news even when there was no reason to.

He gave me a strange look. Then he smiled.

“Funny you say that,” he said. “Because you missed a call earlier.”

I froze.

I hadn’t told him that.

I pulled out my phone instinctively, heart pounding. There was a missed call. Unknown number. No notification. Just sitting there in my call log.

I hadn’t heard it ring.

I looked back up at him. He just watched me. Smiling slightly.

I stammered something about spam calls, but my skin was crawling. How did he know?

“Just something to think about,” he said.

That night, I woke up to my phone ringing. No caller ID.

I answered without thinking.

Silence.

Then, in a voice I swear was his:

“You need to learn to sit with discomfort.”

The line clicked dead.

I didn’t sleep after that.

I tried to tell myself I had imagined it. A stress-induced hallucination. Maybe I had dreamed the whole thing.

But then I started noticing other things.

Small details that shifted. Conversations we’d had that he remembered differently—but only in ways that made me question myself. Once, I swore I had told him about a dream I’d had, but when I brought it up later, he smirked and said, “You never told me that.”

Another time, I referenced a childhood memory he had once dismissed as distorted. He leaned forward and said, “But what if it was real?”

It was like he was rewriting my past.

I started recording our sessions—not for legal reasons, just for my sanity. I needed to hear what was real.

But when I played them back, I swear some things were missing.

Moments where I knew I had reacted—long silences instead. Or strange audio glitches, like something was cutting parts out.

And then, something that made my blood run cold.

One night, while reviewing a recording, I heard myself speaking—except I didn’t remember saying those words.

A full minute of audio where I calmly said, “I trust you. You’re the only one who understands me.” I repeated it several times. 

I never said that. I would never say that.

I left therapy soon after.

But it didn’t end there.

When I told him I was taking a break, his whole demeanor changed. He wasn’t cold anymore. He smiled, acted friendly. Too friendly.

“Oh, of course,” he said. “Just remember—I don’t provide therapy notes. But if your new psychologist needs anything, they can always call me.”

That night, I unplugged my Alexa. Turned off my phone. I didn’t want to hear from him ever again.

But thinking about him was impossible to stop.

Because he knew too much. Not just about my traumas, my childhood, my fears—he knew my patterns.

He knew the way I second-guess myself. The way I latch onto certain thoughts. The way I look for meaning in things that shouldn’t mean anything.

And now, as I sit here typing this, I wonder—did he know exactly what he was doing?

Did he know that even after I left, his words would stick in my brain like a splinter? That I’d replay them, over and over, long after I stopped seeing him?

Did he know he’d live rent-free in my head, long after I stopped paying him?

Because I think he did.

And just now—as I wrote that last sentence—my phone lit up.

No notification. No ringtone.

Just a missed call.

Unknown number.

I think he’s still watching.

And this time, I’m afraid to answer.
