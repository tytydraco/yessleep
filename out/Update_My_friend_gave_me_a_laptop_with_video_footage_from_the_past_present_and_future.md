The videos my friend gave me were stuck in my mind. Every little detail gave me shivers. The worst part was that I needed to watch the rest of them. But first, there was a long insect squirming around in my head. There was tingling, I shivered every time I felt the tingling shift. I vomited once. I went to the hospital and stayed there until some professionals asked me questions, then used a dark ball to get the insect out of me. I asked if they could just cut the insect in half, but they said it was like a tapeworm. Cutting it would result in there being two of it. After all was said and done, I was told nobody would believe me if I spoke of any of it, then I was let out of the hospital unusually quick.


After I got back home, I started watching the rest of the videos. In a video titled March_27_2017.mp4, the camera operator walks along a dirt path in the middle of the night. There was a flickering white light in the distance. As the camera operator approached it, the audio cut out. As they inched even closer, the light shined without flickering. Up close, it was a transparent glowing orange and yellow orb. I had seen it in the other videos, and it was stunning and calming as ever. What was it? Why was it so important? Like, I get it. It exists. But I wanted to know the significance of it.


I clicked out of the video, then scrolled down to some random day in 2025. I clicked, then the video loaded. It began with a view of a drive along a road between two endless fields of grass. The camera panned to the passenger side window, where a black orb with a gooey appearance floated alongside the car. A chill ran down my spine. It was so realistic, I couldn't put weight on the idea of the video being a scene from an unreleased film.


The orb floated into the car through phasing through the window. Then the camera turned to the windshield, which the orb phased through. It hovered over to the hood, then sunk itself in. Seconds later, there was an ear puncturing bang, followed by a cut to video of water from a firehose being used to extinguish a car fire. The thought of anybody having died made my heart sink a little. There was no proof this was from the future, but it did show me how much of a monster the dark orb intended to be. Although I wish there was some context to why the orb did what it did, it was a monster.


Every one of the following videos showed the orb doing terrible things. Possessing those in relationships only to sour the terms by doing unspeakable things, possessing people in the middle of the night to leave them in a fetal position on the ground, cornering people onto bridges until said people chose to jump. They were all harrowing. I started skipping videos, only for the ones I chose to watch to be just as creepy and horrible. Eventually, I just scrolled right down to the second-to-last one. It was dated July 29, 2026.


The video began with the camera operator filming CNN as it played on a TV. A helicopter camera west of Chicago's skyline was focused on a dark patch of sky above Lake Michigan. The dark patch deviated from the calm blue of the rest of the sky, and was terrifying. All of my insides dropped. This was the future? The headline at the bottom read, “UNKNOWN DARK PATCH OF SKY APPEARS ABOVE LAKE MICHIGAN".


The camera operator got up, then went up to their window. The sky was clear blue. They sped outside, and, in the direction they were facing, the dark patch could be seen above the homes and trees. It was so vast, dark, and beyond creepy, the pit inside me grew stronger. The camera sat on the dark patch for five minutes, zooming in and out, then the video ended. I sat back in my seat. There it was… and it was too realistic to have been staged or edited… and it was far from looking at all AI generated. I was more confused than terrified until I recalled those agents who stormed my home. Fuck. I was eager to watch the final video immediately.


The final video was dated September 30, 2027. It began on a road lined up with shops. Some were boarded up, others had shattered out windows. The sidewalks and road were empty, and dozens of black dots erratically moved about in the sky. Is this the culmination of the dark orbs? None of this made any sense in the first place. There was no way this was real. It had to have been a series of leaked fakes created by the government as a training test or something. I clicked out of the video, then shut my laptop down. I went on to do something more upbeat, instead of watching stuff I wasn't supposed to watch.


For the following couple of nights, I had nightmares about the dark orb. It would be chasing me through an endless field, and it always caught up to me. Then it would touch me, giving me a cold stinging. I'd wake up in cold sweats every time. On the first night, I was sitting up on my bed, wondering how I was supposed to prepare. I knew nothing about the orbs. How was I supposed to protect myself other than hide in the mountains? On the second night, I decided a late night jog would calm my nerves.


In the middle of my jog, an ominous growl came from behind me. I turned my head back. It was the fucking orb, floating still, a couple of feet above the sidewalk. I froze up. Then the thing hovered towards me, which was when my heart sank to the point where I had to run. The damn thing was real, in all its inexplicable weirdness. What was it made of? How did it exist?


I sprinted along the sidewalk, glancing back only to see the damn orb continuing to hover after me. Adrenaline rising, I took a left at the next sidewalk, glancing around for an out. Unfortunately, nowhere seeme safe enough. It was just a quiet suburb. While sprinting for my life, I called the police, telling them a wild coyote was loose. I mean, what would they think if I told them the truth?


As I continued running, a man was about to walk by me in the opposite direction when he stopped, looking on in confusion before backing up and turning back to run away. Seeing the look of fear on his face was validating, although gut wrenching. I picked up my pace, but my body went cold. Next thing I know, I'm lying on my couch, staring up at the ceiling. All the lights were on. I sat up, then glanced around. What happened? What was I doing here? Some amount of time went by and I was unconscious. A little pit formed in my stomach while I got up on my two feet, glancing around in confusion.


A transparent orange and yellow orb formed a couple of feet away from me. It was beautiful and gave me a deep sense of mental comfort. I hadn't felt it in two years. It was like a heavy weight was lifted, and it was euphoric. If it wasn't for the comfort, and the fact I had seen the orb on video, I'd be freaking out and calling my doctor to talk about hallucinations. My brain was being forced to trust what I was seeing was real.


Then, I swore I had an auditory hallucination. Somebody uttered my full name, sending chills down my spine that were then alleviated by the same telepathic influence calming me down. There was a hunch the orb was trying to communicate with me in a way I could understand. I was in disbelief I was seeing it in front of me. I was still going to call my doctor, but the hunch grew stronger. It was the orb. What the fuck? The thing spoke to me again.


“Yes, I'm transferring my own thoughts to you.”


My stomach sank. This angelic orb had full control over my mental state. That was a terrifying thought to have, and the orb didn't make that thought go away. The only thing I could do was respond.


“What's… going on, exactly?”


“You should not have been roped into this. I will prevent your life from going down a path many others have.”


“What are you talking about?”


“It's best you stay out of this. You have no control over it, and it isn't even guaranteed anything in the last five videos will happen in this particular reality. You being brought into this at all is the fault of your friend, Jessica.”


“Why would she bring me into something I wasn't supposed to?”


“When people want to find something to believe in, they'll believe in anything. Sometimes they end up being right. I have confronted her, but she told me her life was in a different place.”


“I’m guessing a place it shouldn't be in?”


“You want your friend back. You want closure on the past couple of years. Do you have an idea of how I can ethically help? I’m able to transfer thoughts, memories, and feelings.”


“Well, you can give her my memories, but don't make her feel exactly what I felt or anything. Just the memories.”


“Alright, done.”


The orb vanished. With it, the deep mental content vanished as well, leaving a freezing pit of sadness and dread behind. It was like falling into a deep hole. I called my doctor. We scheduled an appointment for next week. I have no idea how he's going to take this information in. He'll either take it as me hallucinating, or me confusing dreams with reality. Then again, I do still have that USB.


The next morning, I got a knock on my front door. Answering it, I saw Jessica. Tears were running down her face. A rush of euphoria washed through me. She was actually here! Jessica wrapped her arms around me and apologized for leaving me alone. I smiled.


“It's… well… I’m excited about you being back!”


She pulled away, smiling. “We should get a coffee or something. I can explain everything. Then we can go back to talking about popular music and stuff.”


“Yeah, for sure!”


I thought I had more time to recount, but I just got an urgent call from my boss. I'm going to leave it here. I'm sitting here wondering how any of that even happened. It was weird, but I'm going to try to focus on other matters, since I clearly wasn't supposed to know anything about whatever any of that was supposed to be anyway. I'm so happy my friend is in my life again.
