I work the night shift at a small, 24-hour convenience store. It's usually quiet—until a few weeks ago. That night, I was restocking the shelves when a young woman burst through the door, her eyes wild with fear. She was barefoot, her clothes torn, and she whispered frantically about "the music." I could see her arms, covered in fresh cuts and old scars, the telltale signs of self-harm.  Before I could call for help, the lights flickered, and a haunting melody filled the air. It was an old, scratchy tune, like something from a dusty gramophone.

The woman grabbed my arm, her grip icy. "They're coming," she hissed. "When the music stops, they'll take you." She pointed to the clock. 3:33 AM. I noticed her fingers trembling, bloodied from the fresh cuts she had inflicted on herself. It was clear she had been trying to cope with something far beyond my understanding. I tried to reassure her, but her panic was infectious. The music grew louder, and I could hear footsteps—soft, almost shuffling—approaching the store. The woman screamed and bolted to the back room. I followed, heart pounding. In the back room, she cowered behind a stack of boxes, eyes fixed on the door. The music abruptly stopped, plunging the room into an oppressive silence. I heard the bell above the entrance jingle as the door opened, followed by heavy, deliberate footsteps. I peeked out and saw shadowy figures moving through the aisles, their shapes distorted and inhuman.

The clock ticked loudly. 3:34 AM.

One of the figures turned its head, and though its face was obscured, I felt its gaze pierce through me. The air grew colder, and I could see my breath in the dim light. I heard a soft, whispering chant, like an ancient ritual. The woman beside me started to mutter, her words nonsensical but desperate. She clawed at her arms, reopening old wounds in a frantic effort to ground herself in the terror.

3:35 AM.

The figures moved closer, and the chant grew louder, more insistent. The woman stood suddenly, her eyes blank and unseeing, and walked toward the figures. I tried to stop her, but an invisible force pushed me back, pinning me against the wall. She reached the figures, and the chant stopped. A deep, resonant voice echoed through the store. "The music has chosen."

 The figures and the woman disappeared, leaving me alone in the silent, cold store. The lights flickered back on, and everything seemed normal, except for the lingering chill and the faint echo of the haunting melody. I could still see the bloodstains on the floor where she had stood, a stark reminder of her desperate attempts to fight off the unseen horrors. I've since quit that job, but every night at 3:33 AM, I wake up to the sound of that old, scratchy tune, and I know they’re still out there, waiting for their next victim. My sleep is plagued by nightmares of shadowy figures and the chilling melody. I've started to notice scratches on my own arms, wounds I can't remember making, as if the terror of that night is manifesting in my own actions. Each morning, I find myself in a daze, the faint echoes of the music lingering in my mind. I've tried talking to friends, to therapists, but no one believes me. They say it's stress, a coping mechanism, but I know better. The music is real, and it's a curse I can't escape. Sometimes, in the dead of night, I feel the urge to harm myself, to carve out the fear that seems to have taken root inside me. I fight it, but the compulsion is strong, as if the music demands a sacrifice. I keep a journal now, documenting every occurrence, every scratch, every note of the melody that haunts my dreams. I'm scared of what might happen if I give in to the urge, if I let the music take me too. But the line between reality and nightmare is blurring, and I don't know how much longer I can resist. All I know is that the music is waiting, and it's only a matter of time before it chooses again.
