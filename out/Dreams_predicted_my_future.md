It happened during the Christmas season of 2024. A strange thing had been happening to me for a long time. Something like déjà vu, but in reverse. Sometimes I saw something that hadn't happened yet, but I didn't know if I was dreaming, if it was my imagination or something else, I just saw my life that hadn't happened yet (this is impossible to describe exactly, and if it doesn't make sense to you at all, it might be because this entire text is translated by Google Translate). Well, when I "woke up" from this "dreaming", I didn't remember it at all. It's like I only remember it when I have it.



What was more interesting was when I experienced déjà vu. I was 100% sure that this moment had happened before (sometimes I was so sure that I almost started shouting "This has happened before!"), but I didn't know when, because it wasn't in my "normal" memory.



As I wrote at the beginning, the fateful moment happened on Christmas Eve 2024. When almost the whole family was having lunch/dinner, I experienced another déjà vu. But this one was not like the others. Now I was much, Much, MUCH more sure that this moment had happened before. And then I finally remembered. I had seen this moment *BEFORE* in my "dream". As I write this, I have goosebumps just like I did then, because my "dreams" really did predict the future for me all the time.



I have another case that "scares" me to this day. When we were at a school camp in the countryside a few years ago, I saw with my own eyes the place from my very long dream (it was a long dream even then). I had something like déjà vu, but this was not just for a few seconds - I had it the whole stay. I can't describe the place exactly, but I have a very brief and imprecise description here: a green wire fence in a square, on one side the fence stands on a hillock made of something like concrete pavement (I understand that this name is completely wrong and strange, but I don't know a better way to describe it), there are chickens inside. I don't know exactly what else was in that place, but this is the main thing. Well, and by the cottage where we were staying, there was exactly this place, except without the chickens. But that's not all. My classmate, who was in the room with me, also had the exact same "déjà vu". Is it even possible for two people to have the same "dream" or déjà vu?!



So, these were probably my most interesting cases and experiences with my déjà vu and strange dreams. You may be asking: "Why am I even writing such a post?". Well, I want to "confide" in you about these cases and experiences so that I'm not "alone" in this (I know I'm not).



So this was my first post on Reddit with extra quotes "" and (probably) some weird words because I wrote this all in Google Translate.



So, have a good day, and bye.
