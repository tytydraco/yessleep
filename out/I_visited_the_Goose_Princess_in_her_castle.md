I ran out of the bank, desperate to get my rent paid on time. I only had 20 minutes left - nothing to worry about with my aggressive driving!

But as I looked up from my phone to spot my car, something hard smacked the back of my head. I keeled over, waiting to see if it would strike again.

“Hey! What the…”

I stood up just in time to see a goose squawking loudly as it wildly flapped away. But the goose was not alone. It had an accomplice. I felt an aggressive tapping on the side of my leg. Something was trying to get into my pocket.

What was happening… “Wait! It has my wallet!” I screamed. I tried to chase the second goose, but it flapped away like the first, with my wallet clutched tightly in its beak.

I ran back into the bank to Sharon, the teller who had handed me my cash.

“Sharon! You’ll never believe what happened,” I started. “A goose just stole my wallet! You have to help me. That was the $800 I needed to pay rent. Is there some kind of insurance policy? Anything you can do to help? That was the last of my money.”

“I’m so sorry Jay, but you signed the paperwork. Once you walk out of the bank, there is nothing we can do.”

“I’m just so confused,” I responded. “Those two geese acted together.”

Sharon rolled her eyes. “Jay. Didn’t anyone tell you about the geese around here? They aren’t like normal geese.”

“Why would they be any different from any other geese?” I asked.

“Clearly you are new to town. I’m not the one to tell you the full story, but if you’re going to live in Pineville, try to keep a watchful eye to the sky. The geese are watching you.”

I became even more bewildered. “What do you mean? Why would they be watching me?” I asked.

“Again, I’m not the one to explain. But maybe I can interest you in a loan? For $800?”

I took the loan so I could pay rent, then called my friend Bill.

“Hey, Bill! You have some explaining to do. You're the one that convinced me to move to this wretched town. You’ll never believe what just happened to me. I was attacked. By two geese! They stole my wallet.”

“Wow Jay, It sounds like you've been Goosed! Welcome to Pineville!”

“I got… Goosed? What is that supposed to mean?”

“Exactly as I said. Did you get a close look at them? Were the geese wearing green goggles?”

“Green goggles? Getting Goosed? I wasn’t looking at their eyes, Bill. It had my wallet! Can you meet me at the bar and please tell me what on Earth is happening?”

“Sure, I’m free this evening. If you really want to know, I’ll tell you all about the Goose Princess. Let’s meet at 6:00?”

“The Goose Princess? What? Okay, never mind. I’ll ask you later.  See you at 6:00”

I drove to my landlord, paid my rent plus a late fee, and then made my way to the BlueSky bar.

Bill was 15 minutes behind. I made sure to finish two beers before I dared start the conversation.

“Okay, Bill. The story of the Goose Princess. This better be good. I can’t believe those geese robbed me!”

“Alright. Here goes. Once upon a time in a far away city…”

“Once upon a time?” I interjected. “What is this, a fairy tale? I wasn’t lying to you earlier. Those geese actually stole my wallet!”

“I’m not so good at telling stories, Jay. I don’t know any better way to start it, so can you please just listen? Okay. Once upon a time in a far away city, there was a beautiful young woman. Nobody knows why, and don’t ask her because she won’t tell you, but she left everything behind and moved to Pineville.”

“But there’s hardly anything to do here!” I exclaimed.

“Like I said, it’s better not to question it,” said Bill. “But once she arrived, she did need to make some money. She quickly found a job as a server. Here at this bar, in fact.”

“But she never actually worked here for more than a single night. An unruly man entered about 30 minutes into her shift, laughing about something he hit in the parking lot. After a while, she made her way to the bar and talked to the bartender, where she discovered that the man had run over a goose, and that he had last seen it limping behind the corner of the building.”

“She listened in shock, then ran outside looking for the injured goose. Apparently the bartender warned her not to leave. That if she left before her shift ended, she would be fired on the spot. She didn’t care.”

“She went around the corner of the building and found the goose, which was curled into a ball and lying under a vent that was blowing out hot air. The goose was bleeding. One of its wings looked broken. She reached out and touched the goose, expecting the worst. But to her surprise, it let out a long, sad whimpering squawk that broke her heart to pieces. She shed a tear, then scooped it up and placed it comfortably in a blanket in the back of her car.”

“The vet said it wouldn’t make it. That the cost was too high. That it was only a goose. But she wouldn't have been able to forgive herself if she let that poor goose die. She brought it home instead and spent the entirety of the next day researching what geese eat. Then she scoured the neighborhood for delicious grasses and berries, hoping to nourish the goose back to health.”

“Shockingly, the goose began to recover. She made sure its wing was set properly and it eventually learned to fly again. The woman and goose became best friends. She named it Wilfred.”

“Potential boyfriends found it strange that she had a goose as a pet, and to be upfront about it, she changed her name on dating apps to ‘The Goose Princess.’ From that point forward she stopped using her real name.”

“For many years she lived a normal life, except for taking Wilfred with her around town. She became curious about the daily routine of geese, and so she designed goggles with a built-in video camera that fit snugly on Wilfred’s head. After that, she could see everything that Wilfred did.”

“But that’s exactly when tragedy struck. At this point, the Goose Princess had been dating the same guy for a couple years, and she was the happiest she had ever been. But one day while watching the video camera from Wilfred’s perspective, she saw a couple kissing under a tree at the park. Wilfred normally avoided people, but this time it flew up close to them - as if Wilfred knew them. And as Wilfred flew even closer, she realized, to her horror, that her boyfriend was sitting on the bench, kissing a woman that she had never seen before.”

“Devastated that he was cheating on her, she broke up with him immediately. She never wanted to see him again. ‘I don’t understand, I didn’t do anything wrong!’ he had pleaded.” 

“‘Don’t lie to me!’ she yelled.  ‘I saw it all, thanks to Wilfred!’”

“The soft tears that initially streaked down her face didn’t compare to the ones that followed. The ones that came after that awful text message. ‘Wilfred! I got him! No-scoped him with my shotgun just a few minutes ago. Going to fry him up on the ol’ charcoal grill. That will teach him to stop spying on me!’”

“She didn’t want to believe it, but as the hours and days passed and Wilfred still didn’t return to her, she had to accept the truth. Her beautiful Wilfred, that spectacular and amazing goose that she had rescued, was gone. Dead. All because of that evil man she had once thought she loved. It was that day that her heart truly shattered and turned cold. It was that day that her trust in humanity ended. It was that day that she truly became the Goose Princess.”

“If you think her obsession with geese ended then, you would be very much incorrect. Her obsession only grew. The very next day, she sat at the park, watching closely as geese tiptoed around her. She observed their flight patterns, mating habits, and feeding conventions. The Goose Princess, herself, stooped close to the ground, crouching and squatting in ways only familiar to wild geese.”

“She returned to that park, day after day, until she became one with the flock. Tip-toeing and squawking and honking like the rest. A goose-like grin spreading from cheek-to-cheek at every passerby. Even then, we should have recognized her for what she was.”

“Bill!” I responded.  “Can you please stop right there? This is absurd. How does this relate to those geese who robbed me in broad daylight?”

“I’m getting there, Jay! As I said, the Goose Princess lost all of her trust in humanity when Wilfred was shot. She wanted to make people suffer for the sadness they had created and for the sadness in her heart. For their sins against humanity and their sins against love. She took that whole flock of geese at the park and trained them. She fitted them all with those spooky green goggles with those little micro-cameras. She saw through their eyes. The eyes of the flock. She didn’t just see through the flock, she *became* the flock. And the flock began to do her bidding.”

“She spied on people. She judged their sins; imagined or not. It was easy to train a goose. At least it was for the Goose Princess. A fat wriggling worm, a ripe reddened berry, or a handful of seeds was all they needed before submitting to her. They would fly where she wanted them to, spy on whoever she wanted them to, and steal whatever she wanted. Even the smallest of transgressions, she reasoned, justified a visit from her flock. As her small fortune of jewelry, wallets and other trinkets grew, so did her desire to punish as many people as she could.”

“That castle up on the hill. Nobody really knows how she acquired it, but the previous owner was admitted to an asylum. Rumor has it that he clawed at his ears until they turned bloody; lest the geese squawk at him in his nightmares. The castle abandoned, the Goose Princess moved in. Nobody questioned it, too afraid that they would be met with the same fate. Now it’s her castle. She sits up there managing her flock of geese.”

“She loves those geese. They are her family. More so than any person could ever be.”

“That castle is actually real? The Goose Princess is there, right now?” I asked Bill.

He sighed. “Yeah. She’s there, as she has been for the last 20 years. She still occasionally comes to town, but be very careful if you interact with her. Chances are high that you will get a visit from her flock.”

I got up. “Okay, I’ve heard enough. I’ll go confront her myself. I really need that $800 back,” I explained.

“Don’t do it Jay! That's a horrible idea!”

But I was already gone, making a beeline for the castle to get my wallet back. There was only one property that fit Bill’s description. 

30 minutes later I was parked outside of its gated entrance. Four geese, two on each side, seemed to be guarding it like sentries.

“Get out of here!” I yelled at the geese as I banged on the gate. I wasn’t really expecting it to budge; and it didn’t. But the geese flew away.

I climbed over the gate instead and followed a winding path to the castle.

The Goose Princess was already standing outside the main entrance as I arrived - surrounded by her four guardian geese.

She spoke first. “Look who we have here! Welcome home, my Silly Goose.”

“Hey!” I replied. “I’m just here looking for my wallet. One of your geese stole it from me and I was told to look here.”

“Yes, and that is why you are my Silly Goose,” she said. “Come inside.”

“I don’t want to bother you, I just want my wallet back.”

“You have already bothered us. Come along inside. Please don’t make us wait.”

The Goose Princess turned around and walked through the main entrance of her castle. The four geese split into two pairs and stood guarding the doors. It was only then that I realized that all of the geese were, in fact, wearing green goggles.

I stood motionless, on the verge of leaving, but before I could turn back, another group of four geese landed behind me. They squawked and hissed loudly, urging me towards the castle. They watched my every move as I entered the large wooden entryway.

I walked along a corridor, and then into a large open room. The first thing I noticed was an enormous mosaic goose, taking up the entirety of the large wall furthest from me. It was done with so much precision and detail that it would be considered a masterpiece at any art gallery.

Below the mosaic goose was a long table with enough seats for at least a couple dozen people. There were three people seated.

“Are you impressed, my Silly Goose?” she started. “It took me two years to create that. Wilfred. My first friend of the skies, taken from us in such a horrific manner. Come join us for dinner. I’d like you to meet my Good Goose and my Bad Goose.”

A woman and a man who were seated at the table looked up. “Welcome, Silly Goose!” they said in unison.

“Can everyone please just call me Jay? I’m just looking for my wallet. Then I’ll be on my way.”

All three of them just sat there and laughed at me.

“He really is a Silly Goose!” exclaimed the man. “You came all this way to retrieve a wallet, but now you are part of the flock.”

“I am not part of your flock!” I exclaimed.

“Not yet,” said the Goose Princess with a smirk.

“Both of them came here willingly. Good Goose sold his watch collection to pay for some of the repairs around the castle. And Bad Goose. She was on the run after a murder conviction and came here for refuge. But whether willingly or not, everyone who visits me joins the flock.”

“I forgive all of their sins. Only humans can sin, and a goose is not a human. I forgive all of your sins, Silly Goose.”

“Great! If I am your Silly Goose, can I have my wallet back?”

“What need does a goose have with a wallet?” she asked. “Come sit!”

Dinner did look delicious and I resigned myself to sitting at the table.“Dig in! All of this was donated by local restaurants. The geese pick up food for us every evening.”

The food tasted great, and when we were all done, the Goose Princess stood up on top of the table and uttered a singular loud squawk. The four geese standing guard flew away and called out to the rest of the flock, which descended upon the castle.

Thousands of them poured in through the entryway, the windows, and from other areas of the castle.

“It is quite a coincidence you joined us today, my Silly Goose! We are having a celebration this evening.”

“A celebration?” I asked, but she ignored me.

Instead, she stood on top of the table and began squawking, honking, and clucking like a goose. It must have meant something, for every single goose in the castle was alert and staring at her with their utmost attention.

The closer they crowded in, the more uneasy I became.

Some of the geese seemed to talk back, as if asking her questions. She answered them all in that odd goose-speak.

Even Good Goose and Bad goose had a few things to say. All completely unintelligible to me.

But then the goose princess looked at me. “Don’t worry, you’ll learn how to speak over the next couple months. It is a simple, but deeply expressive language. If you could do me a favor now, follow Gregooselina upstairs and grab my laptop. It’s a bit too heavy for their beaks.”

A large goose in the back gave a guttural grunt.

“What are you waiting for? I need that laptop!” she exclaimed.

Too scared to do anything else, I got up and walked over to Gregooselina, who led me upstairs to a room. A laptop was sitting on a table. I grabbed it and returned downstairs.

“Thank you Silly Goose! Turn it on and cast it to the screen. I have some diagrams to show the flock.”

I opened the laptop and did as she asked. A large projector screen lowered itself in front of the mosaic picture of Wilfred, and an aerial view of Pineville filled the screen.

The Goose Princess spoke a few clucks.

The geese erupted with enthusiasm. Good Goose and Bad Goose were on the edge of their seats.

“We are going to need your help Silly Goose. We need 680 hand-written letters. One letter for every household in the city. We are giving everyone a chance to join the flock!”

“We will deliver them all at once, at 6:00 PM tomorrow. Right after everyone gets home from work and is sitting down with their families for dinner. It’s the best time to receive the good news!”

“We used the money we found in your wallet to buy paper, envelopes, and pens. You will find them in the 3rd room upstairs.”

“Follow Gregooselina to your room and get started. Beakson and Mallory will work with you. Make sure to uncover the ink so that they can put a goose-print on each letter.”

“Do I have any say in this, at all?” I asked, in my constant state of befuddlement.

She just laughed. “No, you really don’t. Get to work. I’ll need them all done by 5:00 tomorrow. That gives you about 19 hours.”

I sighed and went back to the doorway where three geese were waiting.

Gregooselina led the trio as they marched me back up the stairwell and into a long hallway. I was nudged into the third door on the right, and found myself in a surprisingly cozy room.

Inside was an ornate desk, with large stacks of paper and envelopes. A pack of brand new pens sat on top of the paper. Beakson and Mallory had already started inspecting each item, and squeaked at me as they nudged some unopened ink pads.

I opened one of the ink pads for them and sat down at the desk.

Mallory picked up a piece of paper with his beak and clucked, drawing my attention to it. It was a pre-written letter. I realized that I was supposed to duplicate it word for word, 680 times.

Fortunately it was a short letter.

It read: “The Goose Princess invites you to join her flock. We offer the freedom of the skies and welcome all with open wings. Your human failures and sins will be forgiven. If you refuse, we kindly allow you one week to leave Pineville.”

I got to work. I gave up any hope of getting sleep as the hours dragged on and the geese squawked at me to work harder.

As I placed the completed letters in the envelopes, the other geese placed their feet on the ink pad and stamped them.

At sunup, I heard a knock at the door. It was Bad Goose.

“Good morning!” she said. “You are doing well. You have been accepted by the flock!” 

She placed a delicious looking plate of food on the table. “Don’t worry Silly Goose. You are safe with us here. She has great plans for us!”

I shuddered at her words, but accepted my fate. Pretending to be a goose for food and lodging wasn’t the worst deal I had ever been offered.

But as I finished writing the letters throughout the day, I couldn’t help but wonder what her so-called “Great plans” entailed. What did she want with the entire city?
