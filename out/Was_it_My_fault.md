I don’t know when it started.

Maybe it was always there. Waiting. Growing inside me, like a disease I refused to acknowledge.

For as long as I can remember, people have blamed me for things I didn’t do. The missing money, the broken window, the ruined dress at the wedding—somehow, it was always me. No matter how much I swore I was innocent, the accusations never stopped.

At first, I fought back. I used to scream, cry, **beg them to believe me.** But after a while... I just stopped. What was the point? No one cared. No one ever asked for my side of the story.

So, I did the only thing I could. I **accepted it.**

"You broke the vase!"  
*"Yeah, maybe I did."*

"You ruined my life!"  
*"I guess so."*

"You're a monster!"  
*"Maybe I am."*

I stopped defending myself. I took every punishment without a word, every slap, every insult, every locked door. The beatings became routine. The bruises didn’t hurt as much when I started seeing them as **trophies.** Proof that I had survived another day.

And the strangest part? **I started enjoying it.**

I know how that sounds. But there was something satisfying about it. Something... **right.**

It wasn’t the pain itself. It was the **question on their faces.**

They hit me, screamed at me, demanded explanations—but it didn’t change anything. Their **loss was permanent.** The torn page, the shattered glass, the missing piece—**they couldn’t get it back, no matter how much they punished me.**

And that’s what felt good.

Maybe it was the way they looked at me when I didn’t scream anymore. The way their anger turned into **fear.** Or maybe it was how, in those moments of pain, **I was in control.**

At some point, they stopped punishing me altogether. They just... ignored me. That should have made me happy, right? That’s what I wanted.

But it didn’t feel right. Something was missing.

That’s when I realized: **I needed the pain.**

No, not my pain. **Theirs.**

The suffering. The fear. The way they **twisted inside** when they didn’t understand why I was smiling.

I started making little problems. **Small ones at first.** Tearing a page from my sister’s homework. Swapping the sugar for salt. Moving things around just enough to make them question their own sanity.

Then, bigger things.

A shattered mirror. A missing pet. An accident that wasn’t really an accident.

And every time, when they turned on me, demanding to know why I did it, I just smiled.

*"I hurt you for a reason."*

And the best part? **They would never know why.**

They could give me pain. But I knew the truth. **They were the ones suffering.**

So now tell me...

**Whose fault is it?**

Theirs?  
For punishing me without asking questions?

Theirs?  
For letting me take the blame for things I didn’t do?

Theirs?  
For failing to protect me?

Theirs?  
For abandoning me when I needed them most?

Theirs?  
For not realizing the damage was already done?

That's my fault :)
