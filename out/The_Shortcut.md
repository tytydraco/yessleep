True story.
In the summer of 1994, the mountains still belonged to the old world.

No roads. No electricity. No phones. Just the stone-built homes of our village, carved into the highlands of the Atlas Mountains/Morocco, surrounded by forest, river, and silence.

That summer, I was seven years old.

Every year, my father would take us from the city back to the mountains to spend a month with our family. Our village was so remote, we had to leave the car in the last place the road could reach and continue on foot — or on donkeys — for another 7 kilometers through rocky trails.

Back then, that place was magical. Wild. Honest. Full of cousins and freedom.

There were four of us that day — two boys, two girls — all about the same age. We ran through the village barefoot, played in the river, climbed trees, and laughed until our stomachs hurt. Everything felt safe. The grown-ups never worried. Kids belonged to the whole village, and no one locked their doors.

One day, we wanted canned tuna. Not the kind made at home — the special kind: shiny tins of tuna mixed with tomato. It was a treat. We begged our fathers for a few coins and decided to walk to the next village to buy it.

It was a 45-minute walk, but we didn’t mind. We knew the shortcut.

The shortcut was our secret path. It cut through the woods, crossed a shallow river, and twisted through trees most adults didn’t bother with. We felt like explorers, slipping through the green world where only kids belonged.

We reached the shop. We bought our cans. And, as always, we played — chasing each other through trees, skipping rocks on the river, forgetting the time.

By the time we started heading back, the sun was already low.

Still, we weren’t afraid. The forest was familiar. The path was ours.

But something had changed.

The air felt heavier. The trees, taller. The usual sounds — birds, buzzing insects, the wind — were gone. Just silence. Thick, unnatural silence.

Then we saw our village in the distance. The rooftops peeking out beyond the last stretch of trees. Home was close.

And that’s when I turned around.

There, standing just behind us in the forest, was something white.

At first, I didn’t understand what I was seeing. It looked like a person — tall, thin — but it wasn’t walking. It was floating.

Not flying. Not drifting in the wind. Just… gliding.

It had no face. Just a blank, pale head, smooth like polished stone. No eyes. No mouth. No expression.

But somehow, I knew it was a woman. Or once had been.

I stopped. My mouth went dry. My heart went silent. “Mmi-s nnigh,” I whispered. What is that?

My cousins turned. One screamed. The others followed.

We ran.

We ran like we had never run before — past trees, over rocks, tripping, slipping, gasping for breath. The forest blurred, but the terror behind us felt closer with every step.

We didn’t look back.

When we reached the village, the sun had dipped behind the mountains. The stone walls of our home were cold. The house was empty — everyone else was at our grandfather’s.

We slammed the wooden door. Lit the gas lamp. Locked ourselves in.

And then… silence.

No one spoke.

We didn’t cry out loud. We cried in silence.

Four kids, curled up in the corner of a dim room, shaking, pale, too afraid to move. Holding our tuna cans like they were shields. Listening for any sound that would tell us it had followed us home.

There was nothing.

But the silence itself felt like a presence.

We stayed there until someone finally came looking for us.

We never really explained what happened. Not fully. We just said we got scared in the woods. But the truth stayed between us.

Because deep down, we all knew what we saw.

It didn’t move like a person.
It didn’t feel like one either.

Now I’m thirty-six.

The village has changed. There are roads now. Electricity. Streetlights. Satellite dishes on rooftops. You can even hear the hum of engines and see the glow of TVs through windows.

But I still can’t spend the night there.

I go during the day, visit family, drink tea, smile. But when the sky begins to change — when the shadows grow long — I leave.

Because no matter how much the village changes… the forest hasn’t forgotten.

And neither have I.

Some shortcuts lead you home.
Others take you somewhere else.
And some things… wait for you to come back.
