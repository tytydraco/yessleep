Hey guys, I’m not sure if this is the right place to be telling this, however a buddy of mine told me about this forum, and I thought portraying my account through words may help me. If you guys have any questions or comments about my experience please leave them below, I would love to discuss.

My name is Pat and recently I have been struggling to cope with an experience I had when I was a kid. Its impact has been considerable, and ever since I have struggled to speak of it. I know as well as you do, that we have all experienced moments in our life that are unexplainable, and it seems that no matter how hard we try to make sense of it, nothing can seem to shake the eerie and chilling feeling that comes with recalling those memories.

There have been few moments in my life where I seriously felt like what had just happened to me would haunt me forever, but on this fateful evening so many years ago that unfamiliar feeling flowed through me for the first time.

If I can recall correctly I was around six or seven years old, and had just started to really understand the nuances of life and the fears that every human suffers from. From a very young age I was adventurous and enjoyed exploring and learning about things most individuals would consider stupid or mundane. Stories of horror and the macabre were to me at this age nothing but fiction, however, it still seemed to intensely peak my interest.

My perspective on the plausibility of such horrific events taking place was no different than my perspective on the plausibility of my mother’s plants forming mouths and singing Green Day. I truly believed that the stories that pulled me towards the edge of my seat would stay in their books, internet forums, and movies but after visiting my grandparents, everything I believed and understood changed for good.

My father grew up in a small town in the far north sector of Minnesota. His town sat approximately 90 miles from the Canadian border, and was said to be in the “Heartbeat of Minnesota’s Iron Range.” His town sat in the mining heavy part of the state, and the nature surrounding it was stunning. I have been back a few between adolescence and adulthood, and am always struck by how dense the forest is, and how empty the town seems. Having grown up in one of the largest metropolitan areas in the nation, such a small and empty town brought upon me an uneasy feeling.

I was used to traffic, noise, the hustle and bustle of people, and the ever present sight of development. However, to me it seemed as if this town had been built, and then just left to fend for itself against the power of nature and time. The buildings looked old and outdated, and the residents of the town were the same.

My dad used to tell stories of his childhood in this town, and to this day, I don’t know if those were actual events or just figments of his imagination. These stories belonged in a book, as each was worth its own weight in gold.

For example, my dad liked to tell the story about how when he was young, in his backyard was a stump that he liked to sit on. One day as he was relaxing on the stump, most likely deep in thought, he heard a noise behind him and saw a cat just out of reach, perched on the fence. As he stared at it, the cat began to make strange noises.

Thinking it was nothing my dad spun around and got comfortable again. As sudden as a strike of lighting, there was a sharp pain on his head as he realized in horror on his head was the cat, claws deep in his scalp. He remembers  screaming and flailing his arms in an attempt to get it off. His mother rushed outside, drawn by the sound of his screams, but by then the perpetrator was long gone.

It was stories like these that I grew up listening to, so when something strange happened to me the first time I visited his hometown, I had prepared myself but not enough. Here is my account: *take it as you wish.*

**My Account:**

As I feasted on the cheerios in my bowl, my parents told me that they would be gone tonight, and that we were going to be spending the evening with our grandparents. My older sister, sitting next to my younger brother, asked my parents what time they would be back. My dad said they weren’t sure yet, but that we would probably be sleeping by the time they arrived home.

As I finished off the last few cheerios that floated in my bowl, I thought about what adventures would foretell me today, smiling as I finished the remaining cereal and stood up from the table. After I changed into what my mom liked to call my "outside clothes", I went with my older sister out into the dense forest that surrounded my grandparents house.

The silence of the forest was oddly peaceful, and brought me into a state of pure enjoyment. The rays of sun peeked through the canopy above us, laying blissfully on my face as my sister and I wandered through the trees that surrounded us on every side. The air was surprisingly cool and still and combined with the old tall trees, created an ever more peaceful environment.

After a while my sister and I retraced our steps back to my grandparents house, taking off our shoes before opening the back door, welcomed by lunch on a Styrofoam plate.

After lunch, with boredom kicking in, I wandered downstairs to the basement and began to scrounge through the various boxes that were stacked in every corner. As I dug through piles of miscellaneous items, I became slightly disturbed as I began to notice that each box had an abundance of clown related paraphernalia.

These clowns looked oddly sad, and as I looked around me I realized each wall had multiple paintings of men dressed as clowns. There were also shelves with clowns and ancient dolls propped up, smiling at me eerily.

I didn't like the cold, trapped feeling I was getting from this room, so I closed up the boxes I had just dug through and turned off the lights before bolting up the basement stairs.

As the afternoon rolled by, I was called to the living room by my parents, stating they had an exciting announcement for myself and my siblings. I listened as my parents told us that we would be going to a small theme park nearby with our grandparents while they were at dinner. I jumped up and down, yelling yes over and over again. My brother squealed, clapping his hands together, as my older sister laughed at our display of joy.

When the sun began to disappear under the horizon, my parents said their goodbyes to those of us staying behind and headed out the front door. Shortly after my parents left, my grandparents packed myself and my siblings into their car and off we were on another adventure.

As we drove, my thoughts wandered and the clowns that seemed to have watched me as I dug through my grandfather’s boxes. Along with the basement, the rest of the house gave me an uneasy feeling. It was hard to pinpoint, but I knew in my subconscious something within the walls of the house was wrong. The rooms, aside from the living room, were cold and uncomfortable.

With the lights off I could almost imagine something waiting for me in the dark, crouched around the corner with a bone chilling grin on its face. I tried desperately to shake the thought as we neared the parking lot adjacent to the theme park, and as the lights and sounds of excitement emanating from the attendees filled the quiet night, I finally began to relax.

The theme park wasn’t inherently big, but it was enough for a six year old like myself to enjoy. I loved the thrill of roller coasters, that sudden empty feeling in my stomach mixed with adrenaline was the perfect source of dopamine for a six year old like myself. With a full stomach and a heart bursting with joy, I finished my fifth ride in a row on what I now deemed was my favorite roller coaster and then set off to find my grandparents.

As I made my way through the crowds of people, I saw that some of the people around me had stopped and were blankly staring in my direction as I passed. I tried my best to ignore their gaze, but with each passing moment I felt as if there were more and more eyes. The crowd was intoxicating, and I was beginning to sway. The claustrophobia painted an image in my mind of myself in the garbage compactor from *Star Wars: A New Hope* doomed to death by a rudimentary hydraulic press. With panic settling in, I lifted my head and scanned the crowd in front of me hoping I would see any sign of a familiar face.

Just left of the center was a girl with half of her face showing, beckoning me towards her. She had her left arm lifted and was partially turned around with one visible eye trained on me. I squinted to make out her features against the chaotic background of the crowd, and felt a rush of excitement when I realized it was my sister.

I leapt towards the first visible gap in the crowd and pushed myself towards my sister's direction. *I wonder if this is what traffic feels like,* I thought as I waited for an open space to slide through. As I pushed through the last row of strangers, I came to where I had seen my sister standing and abruptly stopped when the spot she had been occupying was now empty.

In a panic I looked left and right, wiping tears forming in my eyes with the back of my hand. Through my blurred vision I saw my sister standing a little ways from me and was then struck by a wave of chills.

She was standing up straight, stiff as a board with her arms glued to her sides. She was staring at me blankly, an unnaturally big smile pasted on her face. In a robotic manner she lifted her left arm and raising one finger signaled once more for me to follow her. I no longer felt the excitement I had when I first saw her, and was instead hesitant to move in her direction.

Desperate to reunite with my grandparents though, I decided I needed to follow her and as I waited for the crowd to break slightly I saw my sister slowly turn around and then break into a sprint, disappearing from sight. Her second disappearance felt like a punch to the gut, and I doubled over from nausea.

*THAT’S ENOUGH! WHY DOES SHE THINK THIS IS FUNNY? THIS ISN’T FUNNY! I just want a warm shower and some cold ice cream. I just want to find them*, I thought as my breath returned to a regular pace. I turned to my right and started walking. There was no plan I was following, I just needed to move and get away from the crowd so that I could try and formulate a coherent thought.

Directly in front of me was a snack stand, with metal tables and chairs adjacent to it. I crossed the uneven concrete and dropped my weight into one of the metal chairs. *How can I contact grandma and grandpa?*  I thought, *I don't even know their phone number. I do know Papa's though, and I think I can remember Mama's*. My rescue plan came to me all at once, and I stood up from my chair and walked towards the open window of the snack stand.

"Excuse me sir" I said quietly, the voice of my dad saying *Don't Talk to Strangers* audible in my head.

"Hey there lil fella, what can I help you with?" said the old man as he leaned out the window, a welcoming smile visible on his wrinkled face.

"Do you have a phone? I lost my grandma and grandpa and I don't know where to go. I am very lost."

"Of course I do. Would you like me to call them? I can put it on speaker phone for you."

"Uh, yes please. I don't know my grandparents phone number though. Can I call my papa instead?"

"Sure thing, come inside the stand. Let's get you away from the crowd." he said, turning around to unlock the door on the side of the small stand. I hesitated but stepped inside and was instantly comforted by the familiar smell of fried food.

"Thank you sir, I don't know how I lost them. It happened so fast." I whispered, staring at my shoes while I stood awkwardly against the counter behind me.

"Don't mention it Kiddo. You see, I have a few grandchildren myself, so I know how worried your grandparents and parents must be right now. What's your name son?"

"Patrick sir, but you can call me pat."

"Well it is very nice to meet you Pat. What is your dad's phone number, let's call him and get you home." he said, still smiling warmly at me.

As he entered my dad's phone number and the line began to ring, I took in deep breath of air, attempting to slow the flood of emotions building within me. After two or three rings, my dad's voice broke the silence.

"Hello? Who is this?"

"Hi, my name is Walter Schumacher, I have your son Pat. I run one of the snack stands at the forest hills amusement park. He came to stand and explained to me that he was lost and needed to call his parents. I could sense he was upset and since I have some grandchildren myself I knew he needed to be someplace safe."

After a moment of silence my dads voice echoed through the phone, "Mr. Schumacher, thank you for finding him. There is no feeling like knowing your child is lost, I know you have probably experienced that before."

After Walter told my parents his exact location, and they had conveyed that location to my grandparents, I was treated to a warm hot dog and a bag of Cheetos, courtesy of my new friend.

With the last bite of the hot dog headed to my stomach, I looked up to see my grandparents quickly walking towards the stand, my sister and brother by their sides. Walter opened the side door and walked me outside to my grandparents who immediately scooped me up and held me for a moment before setting me down.

Turning to Walter, my grandmother said, "Thank you so much for finding Pat and keeping him safe. I'm Jenny Andrews and this is my husband Dan."

"Mr. and Mrs. Andrews, it's so very nice to meet you! Pat seems like a great kid, and I just couldn't let him go back into that crowd all by himself. Too many possibilities for danger." Walter said, reaching down to tousle my blonde hair.

"We were so worried about him. We have been looking everywhere for him. No one saw him and we couldn't seem to pinpoint where he was. The call from his mother felt like the grace of God, you sir are a lifesaver!"

"It's my pleasure, I love kids and am always looking to help."

Walter turned his face to me and as I looked up at him he said, "Enjoy your night kid, be safe and don't run off anymore." I laughed and nodded before stepping towards my grandma.

She put her arm around my shoulder and pulled me towards her hip.

"What do you say Pat?" she said briefly motioning towards Walter.

"Mr. Walter, thank you for helping me. The free food was delicious. You helped me a lot."

Kneeling he said, "Pat, you don't need to say thank you. If you were my age and in my shoes you would have done the same thing. But don't worry you have a long ways to go before you get to my age. Be safe kid, have a nice drive home."

Walter stood, shook  my grandparents hands, and then headed back towards the shack door that stood slightly ajar. As he walked back into the shack, and shut the door behind him, my grandmother turned to me and with sad eyes said,

"Pat, we are so sorry we didn't stay with you. I hope you can forgive us. Your parents weren't happy to find out we had lost you. We feel so responsible." with an air of confusion she said "Your grandpa and I still don't understand how no one saw you."

"But Grandma," I said, "Stace saw me just  a little while ago. She kept running from me, but I just couldn't seem to catch up!"

I felt anger again as I looked at my sister who stood next to my grandpa, an honest confusion and worry visible on her face.

"Pat, your sister has been with us the whole time. You might have thought you saw her in the crowd, but she was glued to my hip the whole time."

"No she wasn't, she stopped twice and beckoned for me to come. She just kept smiling at me like she wanted to scare me more than being lost already did! The first time she just stood there and I lost sight of her, but the second time she turned and sprinted away into the crowd. I hate Stace." I said glaring at my sister who looked even more perplexed.

"Pat you sure you saw me" my sister said, "Grandma is telling the truth, I was with her the whole time.""But you were there, I SAW YOU!"

Tears were now starting to form in my eyes, the image of her unnatural smile was all I could see. I tried wiping the tears away, but they had already broken their seal and were pouring down my face. My grandma wrapped me in her arms and hugged me until the heaving sobs had subsided.

"Pat", she said "Let's get home. This whole event was exhausting, it's been a long night. How about some ice cream when we get home?"

"Yes grandma, ice cream sounds great. I'm sorry for getting lost. I'm also sorry for saying I hate you Stace. I guess I was just seeing things." I then lowered my head and went silent.

"Pat, don't blame yourself. We forgive you, just glad you are back in once piece. As for your sister, it was probably the fear and anxiety that caused you to see her. She wouldn't mess with you like that." grandma said, turning to face my sister.

"You forgive him, right Stace?"

"Of course I do grandma, he is just a little kid." she smiled at me before saying, "I know he doesn't mean it." her statement ending with a wink in my direction.

"Thank you Stace, thank you grandma and grandpa. Can we go home now?"

"Of course we can, off to the car we go!" my grandpa said in a harmonious  tone, as he pulled the car keys out of his pocket and picked up my little brother to lead the way to the car.
