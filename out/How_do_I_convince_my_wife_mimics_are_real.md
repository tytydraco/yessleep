I have a serious problem and I'm hoping y'all can help me.

I'll start by saying I've been reading nosleeps for a long time, the otherworldly and strange have always been something that piqued my interest. Let's just say I love spooky shit. My wife on the other hand does not, which is fine. She keeps me grounded, I keep things interesting, I talk, maybe even a little too much, she listens, albeit skeptically, and round and round we go.

But now I think something strange is happening and I can't really trust her to take me seriously. That is why Im hoping y'all will tell me if I'm letting my imagination run wild or if there's a serious problem here.

Let me rewind a little, we met awhile ago right before the pandemic. I still remember the exact moment I fell in love with her, I was sitting on the edge of her bed when she threw her arms around me from behind hugging me deep and I felt time stand still, my heart filled with warmth and I knew I would love this woman for the rest of my life. So I bought a ring, proposed, she said yes, we decided a stuffy expensive city was no place to enjoy life and we started looking at Zillow to find a place back east. We found the most beautiful and strange little house tucked away in the Appalachian mountains. After a video call with a realtor and an offer above asking price we somehow got the place even though the housing market was insane so we packed up and drove across the country to our new home.

I love the Appalachians, they are a different kind of mountain with a different kind of forest and I grew up camping as a boy scout in them. Did you know they are older than the rings of saturn? I'm not joking, look it up, isn't that awesome!?Â  There are plenty of cool things in these woods too, our land is on the side of a mountain and has plenty of little creeks and animals, even some of the bugs are cool once you get used to them. There really is no other way to describe this place than magical. As I mentioned I love nosleeps and creepypastas so I wasn't going to be no fool, I nailed some horseshoes above the doors, prepared to ignore weird noises outside at 3 AM and we made a lovely home together, to be honest the idea of seeing something unexpected was pretty exhilarating to me too.

Things have been great, we even had a little black kitty show up at our door. She is the calmest sweetest cat ever. My wife who has always been amazing with animals named her midnight. After a few days of feeding her and evenings with her watching us cook dinner through the glass door with those sad little kitty eyes we let her inside. We took her to the vet to get her shots and get fixed, they shaved her to do the surgery and she had a long curvy scar on her stomach and a little green tattoo. Apparently the tattoo thing is common and how some vets mark that they've been spayed.

"Oh I think I remember scarring this lil' one, hand slipped and she started gushin'. Ya do so many of these out here every few hundred ya flick ya wrist the wrong way and dun make a clean cut, it dun happen much but hey ain nun perfect" said the vet in a thick mountain accent.

"Look like them stitches held huh sweetie" he cooed at the kitty.

My wife and I both have tattoos and I have a few bad scars so in my opinion this just made her fit in better with us. We decided she would be an indoor/outdoor kitty and so we let her out and in whenever we see her, she's actually really good about coming in every day before it gets too dark, which is probably because I always giver her some of our dinner.

Sorry for rambling, I'm just excited about my life. I'm from Baltimore and my family weren't the kindest of people. As a result of my upbringing I had some issues when I was younger with doing and selling the type of drugs you end up on in Baltimore.

I got off the junk and I still can't believe this is my life so I run my mouth a little too much because of how grateful I am. I know every day is a gift and I don't worry about acting that stupid again so long as I celebrate with gratitude and remind myself that I don't have to live life like I'm in danger all the time anymore. It's really terrible what living life fighting to survive does to your perception of the world, but I've been healing more and more each day.

It's not that I have anxiety in the traditional sense. I am not jumpy by any means, but I have trouble sleeping without having a gun next to my bed. My wife is so kind and helps me understand that things aren't as dangerous as I perceive them to be, but that's exactly why I need this sanity check. I can be a bit overprotective due to my brain but this just feels different to me so let me know what y'all think.

Last night we were asleep in our bed and I heard a really strange thud come from downstairs. I woke up groggy and crusty eyed, my wife was holding me lovingly like she does on chilly nights, so I gladly assumed the cat jumped off a chair or something and went back to sleep.

Later I heard another thud and I was still sleepy. As I was muttering something about her being lucky she's a cute kitty to myself I stretched my legs and felt my foot press up against a warm furry lump.

*Oh shit*

I immediately sat up and grabbed my cell phone to turn on the bedroom lights. After a few frantic seconds of opening apps and cursing myself for not buying a smart switch the lights turned on. I saw that Midnight was in fact there curled up squinting angrily at the unexpected illumination.

My heart stopped, something else was making the noise.

Softly, I shook my wife awake and held my finger to my lips then whispered "stay here there's something downstairs."

*Thud*

She kept quiet, staring at me with wide worried eyes but shook her head yes.

I slipped out of bed and grabbed my gun. As quietly as I could then started to sneak my way down the stairs, wincing as I stepped on the second to last step and an elongated groan lurched into the darkness.
Just as my eyes were fully adjusting to the moonlight I heard another thud around the corner and and felt my heart pounding in my chest.

I turned the corner and nearly let out a yell as I saw midnight staring up at me with the moonlight glowing in her eyes. I sighed and tried to calm myself down, luckily I don't have an itchy trigger finger. She must have slipped by me when I was coming down the stairs. Gingerly I crept around in the darkness, looking in each room but I couldn't find anything strange.

"It must have been something outside I can't find anything." I called up to my wife as I bent down to pet the kitty.

"Yeah I saw the raccoons out yesterday, maybe they are up to something? And midnight is just laying here, she doesn't look freaked out at all so I'm sure it's fine"

"Good point"

*Wait what*

I froze mid pet

It was the middle of the night and as I mentioned I've read a lot of nosleeps so my dark house in middle of the night brain started racing with thoughts of mimics and skin walkers. I mean we are in the Appalachians, could they have gotten past my horseshoes? could they even turn into pets?

I stepped back, slowly inching away as the thing meowed softly in protest to the lack of petting. It seemed like midnight, it even meowed like her.

Which could only mean one thing.

I felt my body go cold with fear.

I turned and walked briskly up the stairs, I knew if I seemed too alarmed that the thing laying with my wife would attack. Sure enough my wife was sitting on the bed with a black cat.

"Come with me to the bathroom, slowly, leave the cat" I said sternly, pointing my gun at the ground but ready to use it if I needed.

The cat stopped licking itself and stared at me blankly from the bed.

"What do you mea.."

"Just do it!" I snapped.

She scowled with worry and slid off the bed, as soon as we got to the bathroom I closed and locked the door.

"Midnight was downstairs" I said.

"What do you mean she was on the be-"

"No! She was downstairs, I saw her."

As I said this I heard the scraping of claws start at the bottom of the bathroom door.

"Babe, she was on the bed with me" she sighed.

"I know."

"Then how..."

*Bam*

The door rumbled as a small creature jumped against it.

I backed away from the door pushing my wife toward the wall as I saw a furry black paw slip under the crack for a moment.

"There were 2, 2 of them babe, they look the exact same, I saw them both how the fuck could there be 2, it must be...."

The scratching started again, accompanied by a small familiar "meow".

"What are you talking about?" she said staring at me intently.

"It's got to be a... a mimic."

The scratching grew louder at the door and I could hear hissing and a snarl, a smile slowly grew over her face as she stared at me for what felt like ages.

My stomach dropped and my spine went stiff as the scratching halted and I heard a gutteral growl from outside the door.


My wife burst out laughing.


"Babe, you must have gotten confused, you have to quit reading scary stuff before bed, listen to how worried midnight is" giggling as she unlocked the handle and started to open the door.

"No!" I yelled and reached forward as the door swung open, 2 cats Stood near it, tails swaying staring at one another.

"Shit!" She gasped as she was startled out of her laughter.

She rushed over to stand between the cats before I could say anything.

"We must have let another kitty in by accident" she said as she stooped down petting them each with one hand calming them both down.

...It made sense, more sense than a mimic cat I guess.

"But they look so similar" I protested.

"Honey they're black cats, they all look the same, hell they're probably siblings."

...This also made sense.

My face flushed and I felt foolish, but something still didn't feel right.

I felt a stone form in the pit of my stomach as I started to get angry, I hate it when she laughs at me when I'm trying to her something is not okay.

As embarrassed as I am to admit it we got into a huge fight, about her not believing me, about my past and how it drains her, about how she loves me but if I keep having episodes like this then she has to leave for her own safety. We rarely ever fight but when we do my trauma responses are what it's always about. I have never heard her mention leaving before though and she is not the dramatic type, I know that she was serious.

We went back to bed and things have been normal for the past few days, but I haven't been able to shake the feeling that the cats are too similar. 

When I feed them they meow the same, they curl around my legs the same, they even sit at that fucking glass door staring at me together. I have had cats before, no cats are this close. When I was living my life rough I knew the difference between worry and when my gut was trying to tell me something real, and trust me something is very wrong here.

I decided I had to find out for sure.

That's why this morning I grabbed the first cat I could and combed through the fur on her stomach.

I found the scar and the green tattoo, it looked just like that day at the vets office.

*This must be little midnight* I thought. 

My palms got sweaty as I wrestled the other one and held her tight.

With my hands trembling terrified that she would turn into some monster and attack me, I managed to comb through her fur.

And that's when I saw it.

A long curved scar on her stomach, and a little green tattoo.

I couldn't believe it but I've checked them both 3 times now and they are the exact same, there is literally not a single detail different between them. The same tattoo sure but the exact same scar? It just doesn't make sense any other way.

So tell me nosleep, how do I convince my wife mimics are real? Because I'm laying here with four glowing eyes staring at me from the foot of my bed, and I'm scared to let myself fall asleep.
