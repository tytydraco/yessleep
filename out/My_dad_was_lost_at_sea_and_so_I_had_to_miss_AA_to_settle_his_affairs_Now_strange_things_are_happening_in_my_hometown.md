Let me start off by saying the ocean and my father make me feel the same way. 

My mother drowned when I was barely out of diapers, and her loss left my father a volatile, alcoholic bastard. Then, when I was the ripe old age of twenty-four and we were supposed to be healing and moving on, both he and the ocean made me a widower.

I tried to tell myself it wasn’t my father’s fault. Even in the absence of an apology, the guilt of being at the helm of that boat when the sea turned over like a slumbering monster must somehow torture him.

I forgave that man for so much. It wasn’t fair that I survived and Sally didn’t. Fuck, it wasn’t fair that *he* survived at all.

Existing without my wife in a town I hated felt like sitting still in a burning house. So I left, and for three years I never looked back. It was hard at first. I fell into the same vices as my father, but I might have eventually rebuilt my life if my sister hadn’t called.

It started when my work buddies invited me out for drinks, which I declined in favor of sprinting to my car. City traffic meant time was limited, and I hadn’t missed a meeting yet, just as the court ordered. My hard earned six-month chip was so close, I could almost touch the proof I wasn’t just a huge pile of shit and wasted potential.

A shrill ring from my coat pocket nearly made me drop my keys, and when I saw the caller ID, my stomach sank. 

Jenny never called. We texted occasionally, but after I got arrested for the final time, it was too much energy for either of us.  
  
“Hey, Jenny,” my voice came out tight. “I-Is everything-” 

“Dad’s dead.”

“Oh.”

She told me he took his boat out in the middle of a storm the night before and it washed up that morning in pieces. The coast guard wasn’t hopeful that his body could be found with how rough the seas were.

After losing Sally, I couldn’t take hearing his voice let alone the sight of him, but now William Briggs was gone. Time ran out to salvage anything, and I had no way to prepare for how much that hurt despite the conscious choice I made to let that timer run out. He was never going to see me make something of myself, even after all he did to ruin me.  

“I need your help going through the house.” Jenny sounded tired. “Pack his things away.”

My throat tightened. “Shit, Jenny, I can’t.”

“What do you mean, you can’t?” Her words carried an edge that made me flinch.

“I mean, I have work and Betty doesn’t travel well…” I trailed off. Those excuses sounded hollow even to me. Jenny, having never left the trenches of our hometown except to deal with me, was not impressed. 

“Are you kidding me? Who the fuck is Betty?” 

“Oh, um, sorry. I forgot to tell you. She's this cat I found.” I didn't add that she was what stopped me from jumping off a bridge. “You know, to give myself responsibility or whatever.” 

My sister’s weary sigh reverberated in my bones. “Billy, I hate asking you to come back. I really do. I’m sorry. I…have a lot going on and I need help.”

“You and Dave having problems again?”

It took her a moment to answer with a quiet, “What else is new?” 

Jenny wasn’t the crying type, but unlike me, she hadn't given up on our Dad. No surprise her dipshit husband gave zero shits about her grief. Jenny was raised by the decorated sea captain our father was before our mother drowned. I wished I knew that guy. Maybe if I had things would be different.

The last thing I wanted to do was return to that godforsaken town, but Jenny wouldn’t ask me to come back unless she was desperate. 

“I can’t.” My attempt to be final about it was a feeble wheeze, and Jenny’s rage permeated through the speaker as she ground out,

“You owe me for what you’ve put me through.” 
  
I had no grounds to fight her on that, humiliating though it was. It sucked to be reminded of how recent my latest fuck up was, and how Jenny, like always, showed up when I called. 

“Okay,” I finally breathed. “I’ll be there.”

There was no sign of my father’s body over the few days I took to prepare. I packed up Betty and a few other necessities, and the three-hour drive back to Hell on Earth commenced. 

As the city gave way to trees and crop fields, it was impossible for me not to be reminded of all the times Jenny made this drive to get me out of trouble. All while pursued by a flood of passive-aggressive calls and texts from Dave.

Betty was content as could be sitting in the passenger seat. Despite being a street cat, not a great many things bothered her. It made me feel like more of an ass using her as an excuse not to show up. 

I opened the top of her mesh carrier and she purred, happy as a clam within it as we passed the old, water stained sign that read, *“Welcome to Fisherman’s Bay”* in faded font with a peeling mermaid lounging beneath. 
 
Fisherman’s Bay was as gray and bleak as ever, but if you asked Jenny, she swore up and down that the sun made a regular appearance through the storm clouds that blanketed the town. Surely it had to, but I never remembered seeing it. Sometimes it felt like this place warped itself depending on whose eyes it was filtered through. 

Even with my windows rolled up, the faint stench of fish managed to force its way through my air filter. I drove through the shops and I slowed the car to a crawl when I saw the state of the police station. 

The entire front of the building was covered by an absurd amount of paper, and upon a closer look, they were missing posters. So many, they overlapped, the top layer shriveled by the perpetual dampness in the air. 

“What in the world?” I whispered. In a town of only 2,000 people, this amount of loss was substantial, but vandalizing a police station wasn’t something I thought the people here had in them. 

The door to the station opened and an officer went to work scraping off wads of posters. He must have sensed my staring, because he looked over his shoulder at me with a glare that said it was in my best interest to move along.

So I did and tried to put it out of my mind. This place wasn't my business anymore. 

Past the houses, swaths of rocky cliffs and pine trees, I took the main road down to the ocean side. I had to steel myself with a deep breath at the massive expanse of water that stretched endlessly into the horizon.

I promised myself I wouldn’t panic. I would help my sister with our father’s affairs and then be back in the city by the end of the week. I’d never step foot in this town again.

I pulled up to my childhood house to see Jenny pacing around on the porch. Her dark, curly hair fell around her shoulders as she waved to me. 

My dormant memories stirred, and for a moment, Jenny was no longer an adult, but a chubby teenager in overalls. The circular window at the top center of the house was where I often watched her and my dad's front lawn screaming matches.

It all came back so clearly, Jenny’s knock on my window startled me back to the present.  
I zipped Betty back into her carrier and exited with her.

“Hey, Jenny.” I got out and we stared at each other for a few seconds. The last time I saw her in person I was bruised, drunk, and frankly, a total asshole. The finality of her disappointment when she posted bail hung over us both. 

She cleared her throat and diverted her gaze to the carrier.

“I thought the cat didn’t travel well,” she said. 
 
“Yeah, I just didn’t want to come.”

Her lips thinned as if she were contemplating something to say, but, after a second of deliberation, drew me into a quick hug that felt like a bear trap. She was always physically strong, but working on commercial lobster boats had given her muscles her teenage self could only dream of.

“Thanks for showing up,” she said as she pulled back. “I couldn’t do this without you.”

I eyed the house, my chest tight. “Yeah, sure. It’s just weird to be back here.” 

“Don’t worry,” she said. “It’ll only take a week tops.” The reminder eased the anxiety, but only slightly.

“How are you holding up?” I asked. 

“Shitty, but what can you do?” She shrugged, then followed my line of sight to the house and back. “You can stay with me and Dave, you know. You don’t have to torture yourself by sleeping here.”

“It’ll get done faster if I’m here,” I said. “Besides, it’s bad enough I’m back in this hellhole. Last thing I need is to be another reason you kids are fighting.”

My hope was to make her laugh, or at least lightly exhale through her nose, but before she could react, the front door swung open. 

“Jenny!” Dave shouted, “Jenny, is your brother here yet?”

I glared over Jenny’s shoulder as Dave descended the steps to stand next to her. His beady, far apart eyes peered at me from beneath furrowed brows. “William.”

“You know it’s Billy, Dave. William was my dad, but good to see you as always,” I said. 

Dave was a few inches shorter than me, but wider with more muscle. A beard clung to his cheeks, scraggly and probably peppered with his last few meals. An uncharitable observation, I know, but a good chunk of the walnut between his ears contained far worse thoughts about me. 

Dave caught sight of the cat carrier and scoffed.  

“The hell is in there?” he asked.

“My emotional support cat,” I said.

Dave’s upper lip curled. “Let’s get this over with.” He turned and immediately trudged back into the house.

I looked at Jenny. “What's his problem? He feeling okay?”  

“Can we not do this, Billy? We’ll only be here for a little while longer.” She pressed a key into my hand and gestured for me to follow her inside. “But we’ll be back over the week as much as we can. It’s just…hard. You’ll see what I mean.”

Jenny wasn’t kidding. If I thought the anxiety was bad as I crossed the threshold, the state of the inside unearthed a long-buried sorrow that was far worse. 

What I remembered to be a pristine living room was littered with trash, empty alcohol bottles, and old clothes. A pile of boots, caked with mud and sand lay in a stinking pile by the door, and upon entering the kitchen, a mountain of unwashed dishes towered in the sink. The dishwasher was running and Dave prepared the next batch.

“He lived like this?” I kicked at a pile of beer cans.

“See why I needed your help?” Jenny smiled sadly and leaned her hip against the cluttered kitchen island. “He stopped letting us come over after you left. He’d come to us, but towards the end…he seemed happier.”

“And he didn’t leave a note?”

Jenny shook her head and I went upstairs to put Betty in my old room. As I passed the door frame, I paused when I caught sight of the permanent marker lines documenting mine and Jenny’s heights. They stopped with me at age four and Jenny at age twelve. It was the only remaining touch of my mother other than a few photos probably buried beneath a pile of filth somewhere.

My room was empty save for my old bed and a few boxes. Posters of metal bands and horror movies once covered the walls, but time had stripped them down to the faded blue wallpaper beneath. 

I opened Betty’s carrier and to my surprise, she didn't come out. Instead, she huddled in the back of the carrier in a tiny black ball, the slitted pupils of her yellow eyes wide and on guard.

It was as if I were looking at a different cat than the one I came here with. Betty was the most trusting living thing I’d ever met.

 The night Jenny bailed me out, she padded up to me like we were old friends, and in a world full of weirdos who did nasty things to cats, I couldn’t justify killing myself and leaving her on that bridge. There wasn't an ounce of that confidence now. 

“It’s only for a week,” I assured her. “Then we never have to see this place again.” 

I reached in and rubbed her cheek with the back of my fingers. She leaned into my touch, but still refused to come out. 

I decided to let her be, and closed the door to rejoin Jenny. We cleared off the couches and threw away tons of garbage and old clothes riddled with holes. Jenny went back and forth between me and the kitchen. She spoke softly to Dave, who hadn’t left the sink.

He turned his head and something about the way he looked at her made me stop what I was doing. Resentment radiated from him. He murmured something else to her that made her step back and rejoin me.

“Trouble in paradise?”

“It’s been rough this season. Not many lobsters or fish have been coming in.” It was a dismissal, but I caught her watching Dave anxiously when she thought I was preoccupied. 

I didn’t know what else to say. In a perfect world, I’d tell Dave to stop being an asshole, but Jenny didn’t appreciate other people fighting her battles for her.

I decided to keep quiet and continue my work on the bookshelf, when a photo fell out of one of the binders I grabbed.

“Oh, hey.” I picked up the photo and showed it to Jenny. It was of me and an old friend of mine I hadn’t heard from in years. Our pinkies and pointer fingers were raised and our band tee shirts on proud display. “It’s Jesse and me.”

“Huh. I forgot about that. You two used to be pretty close,” Jenny said. 

“We had a band, remember? Dog Piss on the Rocks.” I chuckled. “I remember when we got our ears pierced. Dad called me so many slurs.” 

“He was pissed to all hell.” A nostalgic smile tugged at Jenny’s lips. “You know, Jesse married his husband a while back,” she said.
 
“Jesse finally came out?” I was surprised. I always knew, but Jesse carried so much shame I never thought he would. “That’s awesome! You think he’d mind if I reached out? I’d love to catch up. Who knows, maybe we can get our band back together.” 

Jenny said nothing, but her smile fell and lines formed around the corners of her mouth.

I frowned. “What?”

“Jesse’s been missing for the past two months,” Dave said from the sink, ignoring Jenny’s weary look. “And he’s not the only one. You've had to have seen them coming into town, there’s missing posters everywhere. Just last week, they found a lobster boat with no crew.”

I noticed Jenny winced as Dave continued,

“Sheriff blames a lot of it on this being a coastal town full of clumsy drunks, and what that doesn’t explain is always an ‘ongoing investigation’.”
 
“Oh.” I was so taken aback there wasn’t anything else I could think to say as a million questions ran through my mind. I looked at Jesse’s image and wondered if he was one of the faces plastered on the police station. In hindsight it was safe to say he was my best friend at one point, although we never officially said so. It just kind of was. “Do they have any leads? On anything?”

“No, but in my opinion I don’t think the sheriff is doing enough,” Jenny said. “The only thing we know about Jesse at least, is what his husband said. Apparently, he was having some sort of mental health struggle. Claimed he was hearing voices. He didn’t take any money when he left, and his cards haven’t been used. As far as the police are letting us know, it’s like he’s vanished into thin air.” 

“Wouldn't be surprised if someone threw him in the harbor,” Dave said.

“Dave, come on,” Jenny said. 

“What makes you say that?” I asked. 

“Look, being gay is all well and good in the city, but something is going on here that's got people on edge, and when old, drunk fishermen get scared, they act out. Especially when the weirdos are causing a scene.”  

I stared at the photo for a little while longer. It was my own fault for not knowing sooner. I ran away from this place and shut down any attempts Jenny made to update me over the years.

“You don't know that, and accusing our neighbors of murder isn't helpful,” Jenny said. “For all we know, he could have taken off.”

“Maybe, but this place has been stuck in time for decades. The town is dying. Boats have been coming back with less and less fish and lobster, and that's when their crew doesn’t disappear. That's why we're selling the house.” 

“Hold up.” I looked at Jenny, bewildered. “You're selling?” 

“I haven't decided that, yet.” She shot Dave a pointed glare. “I'd like to mourn my father before I make any big decisions.” 

“Don't I get a say?” I said. 

Dave mumbled something from the kitchen. I asked him to repeat himself and he shoved the dish back beneath the water with more force than necessary. “You abandoned everything here, and you think you deserve a say?”

“Christ, Dave.” Jenny stood up, mortified. “You promised me you weren't going to do this.” 

“Oh, don't start with me, Genevieve,” Dave snarled.
 
“Who is Genevieve?” I asked. No one called my sister by her government name, let alone her husband. 

Dave ignored me and said to Jenny, “You're naive if you think he's going to be any help sorting this mess out. He's just going to monopolize all your time. He does that enough three hours away! Always calling you to clean up the mess he’s made of his life! It’s not your job to be his mother!”

“Hey, I'm here for my sister!” I stood up as well. “William Briggs was our dad! We're the only ones who should get a say in what to do with his shit!” Jenny put an arm out in front of me. 

“You weren’t here! Your father declined so fast, and you didn't give a shit!” Dave turned to face me fully, but he wasn't squared up and ready to fight, he looked exhausted. 

“No, I didn't give a shit,” I said through clenched teeth. “That man is the reason my wife is gone.” 

“The ocean is the reason Sally’s gone,” Dave said. “The boat capsized, Will. Shit happens.” 

The accident flashed before my eyes, and I was there all over again: lost, terrified, surrounded by angry, black water, and Sally's name burned into the back of my throat. 

I crossed the space between us before I fully registered it, and shoved Dave against the sink so hard the mountain of dishes rattled. 

“While *I* buried an empty casket, *he* bought a new boat like nothing happened!” I said. “And I'm sick of everyone making the same excuses for him!”

“Billy, quit it!” Jenny’s fingers twisted in my collar and she pulled me back so hard I stumbled backwards. 

“I can't deal with this.” Dave abandoned the dishes and grabbed his keys off the island. “I'm going for a drive.” He rubbed his temples, his eyes screwed shut in what had to be pain, but he recovered quickly. “I need to clear my head.”
 
“What?” Jenny released my shirt in time to see the front door slam. She raced to the door and threw it open to Dave getting into their truck. “How am I supposed to get home?”

“Have your brother do something useful for once!” The engine roared, and Dave sped away. 

Jenny sighed, pinched the bridge of her nose, cursed under her breath. 

We cleaned in silence for a little while longer before Jenny asked me to take her home. I tried my best to behave, but only got to the end of the road before I pressed my luck.
  
“I really don’t know what you see in that guy,” I said. 

“Don’t.” Jenny refused to look at me, her arms crossed over her chest. 

“I always thought you'd end up being a lesbian.” 

“How does it feel to be able to just say things with no thought or fear of consequence?”
   
“What? Dad's dead! It's okay to be a lesbian now! Dave makes you miserable!”

“You both make me miserable!” Now Jenny looked at me, and part of me regretted never leaving well enough alone. “Yes, Dave can be an asshole, but he's got a point about how much I enable you! Every time you call, it’s three hours to clean up whatever mess you’ve gotten yourself into.” She shoved herself back against the seat, determined to go back to ignoring me.

I risked a glance at her. She looked like she was two seconds away from opening the door and tuck-and-rolling. It was probably a good opportunity to shut up and let her cool off. 

“You know,” I said, rubbing the back of my head, “I’m in AA. Six months now.”

“Oh?” The bags under Jenny’s eyes seemed to darken. “Is that supposed to change anything?”

A strangled noise escaped me at the audacity. “Well, shit! A little support and encouragement would be nice!” 

“Do you know how many times you’ve told me you were in AA only for me to get a call that you’re in some sort of trouble?”

“Yeah, but I was lying all those times before!”

“Oh? So you admit you’ve lied to me!”
 
“N-No, that’s not what—”

“But because you decided to pick a bar fight and were forced into a program by a court of law, I'm supposed to trust you?”

“At least acknowledge I'm trying!”
 
“I peel you off whatever surface you’ve passed out on, hold your head over a toilet so you don’t drown in your own vomit, pull you out of fights *you* started because your dickhead coworkers think it’s funny, and all while you tell me, ‘Oh, Jenny, this is my wake-up call. I swear this is the last time you’ll have to do this.’ How many times am I supposed to let you piss on my leg and tell me it’s raining? It’s bullshit, Billy!”

“Gross, and it's not bullshit! I’m sober,” I said.
 
Jenny raked a frustrated hand through her curls. “Look, for once can you not be a thorn in my ass? I know I have fucking issues, but the last thing I need is for you to make your snide little comments about the state of my marriage. If you stick with AA, I’ll be proud of you, but until I see a real, genuine change, excuse me for not throwing you a party.”

“You know what?” I pulled into her street and stopped the car in front of her house. The driveway was empty, which meant there was no risk of Dave getting any satisfaction over what I was about to say. “Dave also has a point about you not being my mother! I don’t need you to lecture me about how much of a fucking failure I am!”

Jenny’s eyes widened. “I *never* said you were a failure.” We sat in tense silence for seconds that stretched longer than they should have, until Jenny opened the passenger door and got out. “You know, you keep trying so hard to destroy yourself, but Sally isn’t the only person who loved you.” She shut the door and I was left gripping the steering wheel and staring straight ahead.
 
“Well, I would have had my chip if Dad hadn’t picked the worst possible time to off himself,” I muttered as I threw the car into drive. “Fucking senile bastard.”   

I drove back to the house with music blaring over the radio in an attempt to drown my thoughts out since booze wasn’t on my coping roster anymore. Thunder rumbled in the distance, and tall columns of storm clouds rolled in from the ocean. By the time I got back and laid down in my old room, rain battered the roof. 

Betty curled up into the nook of my arm. I forced myself to focus on resting so I could get out of Fisherman’s Bay as soon as possible. It was a herculean effort, but eventually my eyes drifted shut.

“You and Sally should come see the stars out on the water,” a deep voice said.  

My eyes shot open to see a man standing in the corner of the room. Shadows obscured his face and shoulders, but two pinpricks of green glowed from where his eyes should have been. I recognized him even without his face. I knew his voice in the way a rabbit knew the distant howl of a coyote. Just his height alone made me feel small and helpless. I attempted to open my mouth, but no muscle in my body obeyed me. My father spoke again from the corner,

“There’s nothing like it. It’s the least I could do since I missed the wedding.”

“Oh, Billy, we can finally map out the constellations like we've been wanting to!”

My eyes swiveled in their sockets to my bedside and my heart broke all over again. Within a mane of wild, bright red hair, was the soft, lovely face of Sally. I rallied against my body, but it was my tomb.

*No, God, please. No.*

Sally continued to sit at my bedside, none the wiser. The thud of my father’s boots brought him directly behind my wife. His face was still drenched in darkness with only those sickly green pinpricks dissecting me. He reached out a massive hand towards Sally’s shoulder and I wanted to scream. 

“I know I haven’t been the best parent,” he said. His hand came closer and I prayed the searchlights of his eyes would snuff out before he took her from me again. “But I want this to be a new start. You and your sister were so strong for so long when I lost your mother. I’m so proud of you both.”

Sally smiled. My father’s hand came down on her shoulder like an executioner’s axe. The moment they made contact, I sank into the mattress. My sheets swirled over me and pushed me down until I was no longer surrounded by fabric, but frigid, salty water.

My hands clawed for the surface and the long, broken shadow of our family boat. The current shoved me back and forth, but by some miracle, my head broke the surface and my nails scraped the boat’s exposed hull.

I called for Sally. Salt burned my lungs and nose. Water crashed over my head. She was nowhere to be seen. A vast stretch of tumultuous, black tides was all there was. The feeble light of the stars caught the crests of waves and glinted like hungry teeth as it  I continued my desperate search. 

I paused my efforts when something illuminated beneath me. I brought my attention down to the depths. My breath rattled in my ears as two circles of pale, green light opened beneath me like colossal trap doors. I had no idea how far down they were, but they encompassed the entire accident site.

In my conscious mind, I suppressed what I saw that night. I coped by doubling down that it had been an accident, but the green lights lurked in the back of my mind since the day I lost my wife. 

No amount of alcohol could scrub the stain on my psyche clean. 

I never told a soul. I didn’t even believe myself, but in my dreams, the lights always waited for me.  

I stared into them and had the horrifying thought that they saw me the same way the apparition of my father had: helpless and paralyzed.

 A body sank towards them, one I hadn’t seen until whatever floated below us lit up the dark ocean. The current and sheer terror allowed me to do nothing but cling to the capsized boat and scream Sally’s name until my throat went raw.

A jagged cut of green and blue opened beneath the circles. Dots and lines of more colors flickered to life between the points. My wife passed the event horizon of the waiting maw.

 I was looking at a face. 

The circles flattened into nothing, followed by the teeth fitting back together like puzzle pieces and the sea was pitch black once more.   

My eyes shot open, and I sat up. Cold sweat made my shirt cling to my skin, and my heart beat itself against my ribs.

“It wasn’t real.” I clutched my face and repeated the phrase. We were out there for hours in hopes of rescue, and by the time the coast guard found us, I was in the brink of hypothermia. I reminded myself of all this, because if that thing was real….

Betty butted her head against my arm, and like a child reaching for a security blanket, I held her against my chest. My fingers ran over her soft fur, and her purr vibrated against my ribcage and soothed my rapid heartbeat. 

After I got my breathing under control, I blindly grasped around my pillow for my phone and opened my encrypted folder. I put all pictures containing Sally in there shortly after the accident. Her smile greeted me, her existence limited to my photo reel, forever twenty-four while I had already been without her longer than I was married to her.

I needed a cigarette. I opted to throw on a pair of pants and my jacket to head to the back porch. Nicotine wasn’t something I indulged in often, but my nerves were so rattled, sleep wasn’t happening any time soon. 

The rain came down in sheets from outside the porch awning. The abyss of the ocean loomed just a short walk down the jagged shoreline, and it sent an uncomfortable chill down my spine. I flicked my lighter on, when a faint voice gave me pause.  

Over the surf, rain, and thunder, I swore I heard a woman sing, but her voice didn’t rise above the storm, it blended with it to create something alien and haunting.

The longer I listened, I found it came from the ocean itself.

What came over me next is difficult for me to describe. The best comparison I can think of is the fungus that infects insects and takes over their bodies. My feet moved towards the sound, even as rain soaked me to the bone and a primal part of me tore at the fabric of my being as if it were an animal caught in a trap. 

Her song wove into the folds of my brain and manufactured euphoria that dulled everything else. I was still aware of how dangerously close I was to the edge of the drop off, but the song beckoned me still closer. 

I inched towards the cliff’s edge, and the song grew louder. The claw marks my nightmare scored across mind faded with every crescendo and fall, but I wasn’t healed. The alcoholic in me knew a temporary fix when he felt it.   

I strained my eyes. A woman sat on one of the rocks out further into the sea, but that was impossible. The current would have swept anyone who tried to swim out there into oblivion. 

Her downturned face was obscured by curtains of long hair that hung over her breasts and down her back. She ran her fingers through a strand while she sang. Her hips were where my enchantment turned into disbelief.

 Her pale skin faded into obsidian scales that began where her inner thighs would have touched. A wave crashed behind her, and the rest of her tail slid out of the water and wrapped around the rock. No matter how many times I blinked or rubbed my eyes, the mermaid remained. 

She went silent. 

I stayed frozen in place as her head lifted. Luminescent green eyes found me across the water with the precision of a predator. I recoiled so fast, my foot slipped and the ocean rushed up to meet me.

Cold. It was so cold. I panicked. The current’s power was far beyond me. I thrashed as hard as I could. The waves smashed me against the bluff like a ragdoll over and over. It was only a matter of time until I was ground to a pulp, or dragged out to the open ocean.

I stopped struggling. What was the point? I was born here and I was going to die here. Maybe Jenny would put my face next to Jesse’s, the two of us mere blips in a wall of missing people Fisherman’s Bay devoured.
  
A steel grip looped around my chest and dragged me effortlessly against the tide. My body broke through the top of the water and sharp rocks stabbed into my back. My lungs convulsed and seawater splattered out of my mouth. I barely registered a great weight on top of me as I shivered and sputtered.

When clarity returned to me, the mermaid filled my vision. Her eyes were a mimicry of my nightmares, but her red hair, despite the night and being weighed down by water, blazed like a torch.

“S-Sally?” I wheezed out.

She caressed my cheek, and lowered herself. Her torso bore down on mine and the heavy weight of her tail pinned my legs. I couldn’t fight. Neither my body or my heart were strong enough. I tried in vain to tell her to stop, but all I managed was a wet gasp. 

Our lips touched, and the taste of brine and putrid fish invaded my senses. Something cold and slimy forced itself from her mouth and slid over my tongue and down my esophagus. My body convulsed and I tried to turn my head away. 

Everything in me rejected the intrusion, but she gripped my chin in a vice there was no hope of breaking. 

My arms flailed in a pitiful rebellion that was swiftly put down by the mermaid’s strength. Whatever she forced inside me spread and overtook everything in a wave of agony. My scream was muffled by the mermaid’s mouth. I wanted it to stop. I begged for it to end, but the violation was inescapable. 

She didn’t pull away until I went limp.
I wanted to crawl out of my body, because something filthy poisoned every nerve ending and muscle fiber. The mermaid’s needle-like teeth flashed from behind her lips as she spoke. 

“Stay,” she commanded. Behind her teeth, everything was black and moist like rot. 

Her weight lifted, and I heard a splash over the ocean’s low roar. I sat up, but the mermaid was nowhere in sight. 

I’m back in the house now, typing this and sending it into the void before I convince myself that this was somehow another nightmare. I feel stupid and insane, but the chill of the ocean suctioning my clothes to my body tells me I know what I saw. 

Could Sally really still be alive? Did the lights in the water the night of the accident, I don’t know, do something to her? Change her? She told me to stay, but as much as the mermaid was the perfect replica of Sally, her kiss made me feel defiled and…pliable. 

All thoughts and memories of my life in the city are blanketed in a haze I can't clear away no matter how hard I try. All there is for sure, is Fisherman’s Bay.

I’ll write more as the week goes on. I don't know why, but I have to. I have to. Someone who isn’t in this town, someone who still lives in reality needs to know what I know because something in me is broken and will stay that way until I find out for sure what happened to my wife. 

So please. Help me.
