Don’t upvote this. Don’t reply. Every single interaction shifts my reality a little further, and I don’t know what happens when there’s nothing left to shift.

I know how it sounds, but I’m not joking. I’m writing this because every time someone responds to me online, my apartment changes. Small at first, the couch cushion flipped, a mug rotated handle-out instead of in... but now it’s impossible to ignore.

I should stop typing. I should stay offline entirely. But I’m terrified of forgetting. I’m terrified that if I stop documenting, the changes will become permanent, and no one will know. I need someone to know what’s happening. That’s why I’m posting.

It started two weeks ago. A coworker texted me “ok” at 9:03 p.m. I checked my phone at 9:04 — and when I glanced toward the kitchen, the clock was gone. Just gone. Screw holes in the wall where it hung, nothing else. It was at that moment that I made the connection of the odd changes possibly being connected with interaction with me via technology. I thought I was losing it.

Curiosity made me test it. I made a throwaway account and asked strangers to comment. Every single reply shifted something. A picture frame rotated forty-five degrees. A dining chair slid closer to the door. My toothbrush multiplied — now there were two of them sitting in the holder, both damp, both streaked with the exact same bit of toothpaste.

That’s when I stopped. Too risky.

Then my girlfriend, Sam, started texting. Hundreds of messages over two hours.... I know that's excessive, but we were already in a rocky place before all this happened. She hates when I don't respond right away (I know, kind of toxic, but that's another issue that I'm not worried about at the moment). I didn’t respond. I couldn’t. I knew if I opened any reply, anything she said could trigger another change. But ignoring her only made her panic, and the notifications kept piling up.

When I finally braved my phone to silence the notifications, my apartment had transformed. The living room rug was draped across the ceiling, stretched taught and thin like a skin. It shouldn't have been able to stretch like that without ripping. The couch was flipped upside down, and the fridge had somehow moved into my bedroom, humming against the wall beside my bed. The outlet itself that the fridge was plugged into was stuck firmly into the side of my bedframe. I have no idea how it was even still running. The worst part was the faint sound of drawers slamming, again and again, even though every single one of them stood wide open.

She didn’t know what she’d done. I never replied. 

I haven’t told Sam. I can’t. I can’t risk her texts again. I haven’t called my brother either. I want someone close to notice if I disappear, but I can’t let them trigger more changes.

I tried documenting the pattern. The changes aren’t random — they depend on the volume and timing of the interactions. One comment by itself makes small shifts. But a flood of activity all at once causes reality to unravel faster. That’s why Sam’s barrage of messages nearly destroyed my apartment in one night.

And it’s not just objects anymore. Yesterday, after three upvotes on a test post, I walked into my bathroom and didn’t recognize my reflection. It was me, but out of sync, half a second behind my movements, grinning when I wasn’t.

I’ve started keeping a notebook, recording every interaction and every alteration. But the writing is changing, too. Last night I opened the notebook and the ink from older entries had rearranged itself into a single sentence: KEEP GOING.

I don’t know why I keep posting. Maybe I need proof, maybe I need witnesses, maybe it’s a cry for help. But every comment, every upvote, every interaction accelerates the chaos. I can feel the apartment.... no, the space around me, reacting. Objects rearrange while I’m typing. My chair just scraped an inch across the floor on its own.

I see Sam’s notifications still coming through. Thirty new messages. I can’t answer. I can’t risk it. I won’t. My hands shake as I type. The light outside my window hums louder, pulsing in sync with my heartbeat, though my apartment is on the fourth floor and no streetlight should be that close.

I know it’s coming. The longer I post, the more changes will occur. I don’t know if the changes are permanent, or if they’re even bound to my apartment. I don’t know if reality itself is starting to bend around me.

But if I disappear tonight — if my reflection becomes someone else entirely — maybe you’ll see this and understand. Maybe someone, somewhere, will see the warning.

Please, whatever you do — don’t reply. Don’t upvote. Just read and remember.

I checked my reflection one more time tonight — and it was smiling at me.


 I'm going to do everything in my power to make this a single post. I can't chance any more online presence. If things get too crazy and something happens that I have no choice but to tell the world, I might make an update... 

If things somehow calm down and all of this stops, I'll let you know too. In the meantime, please keep quiet on my posts. It could be harmful to the very fabric of our reality if you don't.

Update

I shouldn’t be writing again. I swore I wouldn’t.


But this morning proved I don’t have a choice.


The hallway outside my apartment isn’t the same anymore. The EXIT sign at the end  (the one I’ve walked past every day for two years) now glows with four letters: STAY. The cover isn’t bent or cracked. It looks like it’s always said that. Like I’ve been the idiot reading it wrong this whole time.


My neighbor’s door is gone. Just gone. Smooth drywall where it should be, like the building had sealed itself overnight. Yesterday I heard him yelling through the wall at his TV... football, I think. Tonight? Silence. When I pounded on the plaster, my knuckles didn’t echo. They just… stopped, like the wall swallowed the sound.


I've had more interaction than I had hoped for from my experience that I have shared. Every interaction online seems to shake the apartment a little further. The bathroom mirror was on the floor when I woke up, propped neatly against the couch. Except the reflection didn’t match. In the glass, the living room behind me looked… normal. Furniture in place. No stacked chairs, no humming fridge in the wrong room. Just the way it used to be. When I moved to touch it, the reflection lagged half a second behind.


The closet door opens to reveal a pile of objects I don’t recognize — yesterday it was jackets and shoes, today it’s five mismatched kitchen chairs stacked impossibly like a tower.


Sam messaged me again yesterday: “What is happening?” Three words. I stared at them for ten minutes, shaking, refusing to open the thread. The unread notification on my screen glowed like a warning light.


I couldn’t resist checking her socials, though. On Instagram, she posted a story of her cat climbing onto the counter. Cute. Normal. Except behind her, every single cabinet was upside down, nailed to the ceiling. Perfectly aligned, perfectly shut. She didn’t notice. Nobody in her comments noticed either.


I wanted to scream at her through the phone. I wanted to tell her to leave, to get out, but I didn’t dare send a word.


My brother tried calling last night. I didn’t answer. His voicemail came through anyway. I pressed play.


It wasn’t his voice. It was mine. A whisper: “Keep going.”


Because apparently, what I needed was a motivational speaker version of myself living in my brother’s phone.


Against every instinct in my body, I called him back. He picked up on the second ring.


“Hello?” His voice was normal. Sleepy. Familiar.


“Don’t text me. Don’t call me,” I said. “Something’s wrong. Every time someone reaches out, things change here. And now it’s spreading. I saw it in Sam’s apartment. I think you’ll be next.”


He laughed — short, nervous. “You sound insane, man.”


“I’m serious,” I snapped. “My neighbor’s gone. His whole apartment is gone. Don’t reach out again. Please. Just... pretend I don’t exist.”


A pause. Then: “You need help.”


And then the line… changed. His voice crackled, deepened, slowed down like a tape dragging.


“Keep posting.”


I hung up so hard I dropped the phone. I haven’t called him back.


The notebook I was using to track the changes is worthless now. The pages rewrite themselves overnight, ink spiraling into circles and symbols I don’t recognize. They layer over each other until the paper looks burned. I tore one out last night and stuffed it in the trash. This morning, it was taped to my ceiling — directly above my bed.


I didn’t put it there. And unless I’m sleep-floating like a goth Mary Poppins, I don’t know who did.


Even the small, stupid things are getting worse. I left a plate in the sink. When I came back, it was stacked neatly with three identical plates, each with the same crumb in the same spot. My toothbrush is still multiplied, but instead of two perfectly used copies sitting side by side, tonight, there were nine. At this rate, I’m going to have enough dental equipment to open a practice.


The kitchen lights blink at odd intervals now, sometimes in staccato bursts like they’re laughing at me. The microwave door refuses to close properly, and when it does, it clicks open on its own, like it’s testing boundaries. Even the fridge seems to hum a little louder, vibrating in a rhythm I swear matches the number of new comments on my original post...


The air smells wrong now, like melted plastic and iron. The shadows don’t just bend anymore. They reach. I saw one stretch over my shoulder as I typed this, its hand-shaped smear hovering an inch above my keyboard.


And yet, I can’t stop writing. The pull is unbearable. It doesn’t feel like I’m choosing to post anymore. It feels like the post is choosing me. Like the story is using me to spread. And judging by the comments and upvotes from my first post, the story seems hungry.


And maybe that’s the point. Maybe this isn’t about my apartment at all. Maybe it’s about dragging as many of you into it as possible.


So if your lights flicker tonight... if you catch your reflection lagging behind your own movements, or if you hear your voice whispering from the dark — don’t say I didn’t warn you.


And for the love of God, don't interact.
