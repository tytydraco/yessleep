Don’t upvote this. Don’t reply. Every single interaction shifts my reality a little further, and I don’t know what happens when there’s nothing left to shift.

I know how it sounds, but I’m not joking. I’m writing this because every time someone responds to me online, my apartment changes. Small at first, the couch cushion flipped, a mug rotated handle-out instead of in... but now it’s impossible to ignore.

I should stop typing. I should stay offline entirely. But I’m terrified of forgetting. I’m terrified that if I stop documenting, the changes will become permanent, and no one will know. I need someone to know what’s happening. That’s why I’m posting.

It started two weeks ago. A coworker texted me “ok” at 9:03 p.m. I checked my phone at 9:04 — and when I glanced toward the kitchen, the clock was gone. Just gone. Screw holes in the wall where it hung, nothing else. It was at that moment that I made the connection of the odd changes possibly being connected with interaction with me via technology. I thought I was losing it.

Curiosity made me test it. I made a throwaway account and asked strangers to comment. Every single reply shifted something. A picture frame rotated forty-five degrees. A dining chair slid closer to the door. My toothbrush multiplied — now there were two of them sitting in the holder, both damp, both streaked with the exact same bit of toothpaste.

That’s when I stopped. Too risky.

Then my girlfriend, Sam, started texting. Hundreds of messages over two hours.... I know that's excessive, but we were already in a rocky place before all this happened. She hates when I don't respond right away (I know, kind of toxic, but that's another issue that I'm not worried about at the moment). I didn’t respond. I couldn’t. I knew if I opened any reply, anything she said could trigger another change. But ignoring her only made her panic, and the notifications kept piling up.

When I finally braved my phone to silence the notifications, my apartment had transformed. The living room rug was draped across the ceiling, stretched taught and thin like a skin. It shouldn't have been able to stretch like that without ripping. The couch was flipped upside down, and the fridge had somehow moved into my bedroom, humming against the wall beside my bed. The outlet itself that the fridge was plugged into was stuck firmly into the side of my bedframe. I have no idea how it was even still running. The worst part was the faint sound of drawers slamming, again and again, even though every single one of them stood wide open.

She didn’t know what she’d done. I never replied. 

I haven’t told Sam. I can’t. I can’t risk her texts again. I haven’t called my brother either. I want someone close to notice if I disappear, but I can’t let them trigger more changes.

I tried documenting the pattern. The changes aren’t random — they depend on the volume and timing of the interactions. One comment by itself makes small shifts. But a flood of activity all at once causes reality to unravel faster. That’s why Sam’s barrage of messages nearly destroyed my apartment in one night.

And it’s not just objects anymore. Yesterday, after three upvotes on a test post, I walked into my bathroom and didn’t recognize my reflection. It was me, but out of sync, half a second behind my movements, grinning when I wasn’t.

I’ve started keeping a notebook, recording every interaction and every alteration. But the writing is changing, too. Last night I opened the notebook and the ink from older entries had rearranged itself into a single sentence: KEEP GOING.

I don’t know why I keep posting. Maybe I need proof, maybe I need witnesses, maybe it’s a cry for help. But every comment, every upvote, every interaction accelerates the chaos. I can feel the apartment.... no, the space around me, reacting. Objects rearrange while I’m typing. My chair just scraped an inch across the floor on its own.

I see Sam’s notifications still coming through. Thirty new messages. I can’t answer. I can’t risk it. I won’t. My hands shake as I type. The light outside my window hums louder, pulsing in sync with my heartbeat, though my apartment is on the fourth floor and no streetlight should be that close.

I know it’s coming. The longer I post, the more changes will occur. I don’t know if the changes are permanent, or if they’re even bound to my apartment. I don’t know if reality itself is starting to bend around me.

But if I disappear tonight — if my reflection becomes someone else entirely — maybe you’ll see this and understand. Maybe someone, somewhere, will see the warning.

Please, whatever you do — don’t reply. Don’t upvote. Just read and remember.

I checked my reflection one more time tonight — and it was smiling at me.


 I'm going to do everything in my power to make this a single post. I can't chance any more online presence. If things get too crazy and something happens that I have no choice but to tell the world, I might make an update... 

If things somehow calm down and all of this stops, I'll let you know too. In the meantime, please keep quiet on my posts. It could be harmful to the very fabric of our reality if you don't.
