This is my confession.

Not the kind where I'm turning myself in—though maybe I should. But when everything goes to hell and the sky catches fire, someone's going to want answers. So here they are.

Two pieces had to fall perfectly into place for all of this to happen. Funny how that works—quite literally every event in your life, whether impactful or mundane, stems from this perfect chain of dominoes clicking down one after another. I mightn’t be sitting here with my headphones on to drown out the muffled screaming if I’d never gotten that diagnosis.

Stage IV pancreatic cancer. The doctor delivered it with that perfectly calibrated tone they must teach in medical school—sympathetic but detached, like they're reading you a weather report about your own death. Movies get it wrong. There wasn't any ringing in my ears, no slow-motion moment where the world went silent. 

Instead, everything sharpened into painful focus—the antiseptic burn in my nostrils, the rough corduroy armrest under my fingertips, the garish colors of the BMI chart mocking me from the wall. It was like the world cranked up its intensity just to taunt me: *Better pay attention now, because soon you won't be seeing any of this.*

Two years to live, they said. Treatment would cost two hundred and eighty thousand dollars if I wanted the Whipple procedure. No insurance, of course. I left that office planning to grab a slice at Pietro's and then walk straight into traffic.

Just as I was polishing off the crust, my phone rang. Turns out it wasn’t all bad news that day—mum was dead. All that alcohol had finally caught up with her, and the wicked old bitch had keeled over on the bathroom floor The attorney paused after telling me, like he expected tears or questions. When I said nothing, he dropped the second bombshell: she'd left me the house.

Standing there on the sidewalk, phone pressed to my ear, I did the math. My childhood home was a rotting pile of weatherboard garbage on the outskirts of Driftwood—a town that died when Peabody Coal pulled out and took all the jobs with them. These days it survived on hog farming, the slaughterhouses so close you could hear the pigs screaming every morning. Safe to say, nobody would be scrambling over themselves to buy up mum’s old house. 

But—and this was a strong but—the land *could* be valuable. Sat overlooking a creek, almost three acres, the only shit heap in what was actually the nicer part of town. If I sank my savings into fixing it up, maybe I could sell it for enough to tick off a few bucket list items before buying a one-way ticket to Switzerland. Those euthanasia clinics looked like IKEA catalogues in their brochures, all clean lines and peaceful colors. Seemed like a better way to go than what the cancer had planned.

The house looked exactly like my nightmares remembered it. Perched on weathered stilts like the skeleton of some ancient, broken stalk—it slouched against the muggy Alabama sky, paint peeling in long strips like diseased skin. The front steps had collapsed years ago, forcing me to climb up using the emergency ladder—still sturdy, probably the only thing Maggie maintained, given how often she'd drag me up it after I'd try to run away.

The cypress tree in the front yard was massive, its dead branches stretched toward the house like it was trying to grab hold of something. That night, Dad polished off a six-pack, shook me awake, and told me to follow him. I was half-asleep when I grabbed my coat and went outside. He set up the ladder, tossed a rope over one of those dead branches, and told me to hold it steady. Then he stepped out into empty air.

I held the ladder like he’d asked, staring up at him as he swung there. I don’t know why I didn’t move or yell. I just stood there, doing what I was told. Eventually, I got cold and went back inside to wake Maggie. I was six years old.

When they cut him down, they left part of the rope. It’s still there, a ring of black rotting into the branch. Nothing grows in that yard anymore—no grass, no weeds, nothing. As if the world died with him.

Standing on that warped porch, key trembling in my hand, twenty years of carefully buried memories came rushing back. The endless hours kneeling in the corner, praying for forgiveness for being born wrong. The hunger—God, the hunger. Three days without food if she caught me "standing like a boy" or speaking too deeply. The dresses she'd force me into, scratchy fabric against skin stretched tight over visible ribs. "Pretty girls don't eat much," she'd say, watching me push food around my plate. "Pretty girls are delicate."

She never hid her disappointment that I’d come out a boy. Told me so every day. Therapists now love to explain it as trauma—how years in that cult, the Brides of Christendom, had warped her so badly that she couldn’t shake the doctrines. When the religion you’re raised in worships the miracle of girls and treats boys like a obscenity, you end up with a runaway ex-zealot for a mother who shaved your head so the wigs fit better, dressed you in pink, and once beat you with a belt because you waddled out of the bath naked as a child, and she couldn’t handle the sight of your penis.

If I wasn’t so desperate for the money, I’d have burned this house to the ground.

Movement caught my eye from the house next door. An old man sat on his porch, methodically cracking pecans with hands that looked like twisted roots. His chair's rhythmic creaking carried across the dead space between our houses. Something about the sound made my skin crawl.

"Afternoon," I called out.

He looked up slowly, hands never stopping their mechanical motion. *Crack*. Shell fragments falling like dead insects. *Crack*. Eyes too large in his sunken face. *Crack*.

"You're Maggie's boy," he said. Not a question. His voice had a strange, hollow quality, like it was coming from somewhere much deeper than his throat.

"That's right. Just here to fix up the place and sell it." I put on my best, dimple-cheeked smile. It worked better on women, but men weren’t invulnerable either. "I'm not planning to stay long."

He nodded once, a jerky movement that reminded me of a praying mantis. "That's for the best." *Crack*. "Some places don't take kindly to being disturbed." *Crack*. "Some places should be left to rot."

Before I could respond, he gathered his bowl of shells and disappeared inside. The screen door closed with a sound like a rattling exhale.

If I'd been smarter, I'd have turned around and left that house to its ghosts. But I needed the money, and besides—what's the worst that could happen to a dying man?

I know better now. God, do I know better.

The first week, I threw myself into repairs. I told myself it was because I was eager to get it over with, that the sooner I finished, the sooner I could enjoy whatever little remained of my life. But the truth is, keeping busy distracted me from a series of unsettling events that put my teeth on edge. I started with the basics—testing circuit breakers, replacing rusted pipes, tearing out water-damaged drywall. The foundation needed work where water had seeped in through cracks in the basement walls. Every repair revealed another problem underneath, like peeling away layers of diseased skin to find rot beneath.

I re-learned the house's sounds: the groan of old timber settling at night, the whisper of wind through loose siding, the skitter of mice in the walls. But there were other sounds too—ones  I wasn’t sure I heard at first until I stopped dead, holding still. Sometimes they stopped immediately, as if afraid of getting caught. Other times I caught them red handed. The soft shuffle of footsteps upstairs when I was alone in the basement. The creak of floorboards behind me, always behind me, stopping when I turned around. Once, I swear I heard humming—an old hymn my mother used to sing while brushing my hair, back when she still thought she could mold me into her perfect daughter.

Then I straight up started seeing things.

The first time, I was stripping wallpaper in the dining room. In the mirror's reflection, I saw a glimpse of something behind me. I froze and every hair on my body stood to attention Three minutes passed, maybe more. I told myself it was nothing, but eventually, I couldn’t help it. My eyes dragged upward, slow and jerky, tracing my reflection until I saw her.

A woman in a white robe stood in the doorway, her face corpse-pale and twisted into something that might have been a smile. When I spun around, the doorway was empty. But the air had gone cold, carrying that sickly-sweet smell of decay I'd noticed on my first day. I’d thought it was dead mice in the walls. Maybe I was wrong.

It lasted maybe a second or two, then she was gone.

It happened again while I was replacing a broken window. Movement caught my eye—that same white robe, disappearing around a corner in a flutter of fleeting white. I remember standing there, hammer in hand, heart thundering in my ears. Eventually, I’d called myself a pussy enough that I goaded myself into action. I followed, but the hallway was empty. Empty, except for wet footprints on the hardwood floor that vanished even as I watched.

Mum liked to do that, sometimes. Walk around the house at night, wet from a dip in the creek. Memories, that was all. These were memories.

I told myself it was stress, lack of sleep, maybe early symptoms of the cancer. I spent hours googling the effects of pancreatic cancer—maybe it had spread to my brain and invaded my temporal or occipital lobes. Maybe they were childhood recollections made manifest.  I'd wake up at odd hours, heart pounding from nightmares I couldn't quite remember. That's what I was doing at 3 AM on a Tuesday—standing at my bedroom window, trying to convince myself that the shadows in the corners weren't moving.

Movement caught my eye from next door. The old man—Darcy, I'd managed to weasel out of him during one of our run-ins—was in his backyard. The moon was nearly full, casting everything in sharp relief. He was dragging something. Something wrapped in plastic.

Something person-shaped.

I pressed myself against the window, breath fogging the glass. Darcy dragged his burden across the grass in a hobbling, lopsided gait. He reached the treeline and disappeared into the darkness, plastic sheeting catching the moonlight one last time before being swallowed by shadow.

I tried to shake off the creeping feeling, told myself I was being ridiculous, that the cancer had already started messing with my head. But then again, better to be safe than sorry. I dialed 911.

The operator listened with unnerving patience as I stammered through my report, telling her about the neighbor dragging what looked like a body into the woods. She asked for his address. I gave it to her. Silence, then the sound of keys tapping. She asked for the address again. I gave it again.

 ‘Sir,’ she said, her voice oddly flat, ‘we don’t have any listed residence at that address.’

‘Huh?’ I hissed, bowing down quickly beneath the windowsill. Darcy had emerged from the treeline, body-free, trudging back across his lawn and heading for the house. ‘I’m looking right at it. Next to Maggie Treyhan’s old place—’

‘Old Maggie Treyhan’s place?’ the voice repeated. ‘Is that you, Lionel?’

I cursed. I hated small towns.

‘Right,’ I said. ‘And the neighbour, Darcy, I’m not sure what his last name—’

“You gotta be confused,” she replied, the southern drawl in her voice almost amused now. “There ain’t no house next to Maggie’s. And who’s Darcy?”

“Darcy,” I repeated, still bewildered. “Darcy Beauregard. Old guy. Blue eyes. Tall. Thin?”

“I know everybody who lives in Driftwood and passes through, and I ain’t ever heard of no Darcy Beauregard. And Maggie don’t have any neighbors, hun. She’s surrounded by swamp.”

I tried again, my voice rising in frustration. I could *see* the house. I’d *talked* to the man. I begged her to send someone, but it was like talking to a wall. Then, suddenly, she went completely silent.

I stood there, saying “hello? hello?” over and over for nearly a minute, thinking the call had dropped. Then, she picked up again, as if nothing had happened.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

Confused, I repeated the same story. The same problem. And once again, she cut me off.

“Old Maggie Treyhan’s place?” she asked, voice thick with that odd familiarity. “Is that you, Lionel?”

I couldn’t explain it, but something felt horribly wrong. Either she had short-term memory loss, or she hadn’t remembered a single word we’d just said. A wave of cold fear washed over me. I hung up without saying another word, my hand trembling as I stared at the phone. I couldn’t shake the sense of doom gnawing at the pit of my stomach.

Something wasn’t right about this place.

I told myself I was just tired, that maybe it was all in my head. But it took the sun rising before I finally managed to get any sleep that night.

Over the next few weeks, I developed a nightly routine. Every evening around 3 AM, I'd station myself at my bedroom window, watching Darcy's house. Like clockwork, every other night, he'd emerge dragging another plastic-wrapped shape across his yard. Sometimes the packages were longer, sometimes wider.

Sometimes they'd twitch.

The lack of sleep started getting to me. I'd catch myself staring into space, losing chunks of time. The cancer wasn't helping—my skin had taken on a yellowish tint, and the pain kept getting worse. But I couldn't stop watching. I had to know.

The house seemed to feed off my deteriorating mental state. The woman in white appeared more frequently now, always in mirrors or reflections. Sometimes I'd see her standing at the end of my bed, her robe moving in nonexistent wind. Once, I woke to find wet footprints leading from my door to my bedside, stopping just inches from where I slept.

I started getting chemo at a clinic in the next town over. That's where I met James. He was there for lymphoma, but you'd never know it looking at him. Tall, built like he spent his pre-cancer days permanently fixed to a squat rack, with these incredible eyes—forest green with flecks of gold, like sunlight through leaves. We got to talking during treatment, and one thing led to another. Nothing serious, just casual meetups when we both had the energy. He was a nice distraction from the horror show my life had become.

One night, I was at my usual post by the window when Darcy emerged with his latest package. This time, though, he stopped halfway across his yard and looked directly up at me. Our eyes met. I didn’t move, couldn’t move, and couldn’t breathe— then, so slowly as though mindful he might startle me, Darcy pressed one finger to his lips in a shushing motion. Then he continued on his way, disappearing into the trees like nothing had happened.

A threat? I wasn’t sure.

I started asking around town about Darcy. The responses were *wrong*. People would either deny knowing him or, more disturbing, their eyes would glaze over mid-conversation. They'd blink and start over from the beginning, as if someone had hit their reset button. Even showing them Darcy's house didn't help—they'd look right through it, like it wasn't even there. *‘You mean the swamp?’* they’d ask, backing away from me slightly as though I’d lost my mind.

Maybe I was. I thought of a way to check.

I've always been good at getting people to like me. It's not exactly a skill I’m particularly proud or ashamed of, it’s simply an effective tool. Being charming and manipulative has gotten me far in life. I used every trick I knew on Eloise, the town librarian—flirting just enough to seem interested without being creepy, playing up my tragic backstory, the whole nine yards. I let her run her chubby fingers through my hair, winked at her, told her to enjoy it while I still had some. It worked. She let me into the archives after hours.

The archives were housed in the library's basement, a maze of metal shelving and cardboard boxes that smelled like mold and forgotten things. Eloise had left me with a ring of keys and strict instructions to lock up when I was done. "Just don't stay too late," she'd said, touching my arm. I knew I could’ve had her right then and there if I wanted. Shame I didn’t swing that way.

I started with the most recent photos, working my way backward through Driftwood's history. The Harvest Festival was the town's biggest event, documented religiously since its founding. At first, I wasn't even looking for Darcy—I was trying to learn more about my mother, about this town that seemed to breed darkness like mosquitoes.

Then I saw him.

2010: Standing at the edge of a group photo, same gaunt face, same hollow eyes.

1995: Behind the carnival booth, watching children play ring toss.

1982: Judging the pie contest, that familiar unsettling smile.

1967: Loading hay bales onto a truck.

1943: In uniform, but not quite right—the clothes seemed to hang wrong on his frame.

1921: Standing beneath the same dead cypress tree where my father would later hang himself.

1896: The photograph was sepia-toned, edges crumbling, but there was no mistaking him. Same face. Same eyes. Not aged a day.

My hands were shaking so badly I could barely hold the photos. This was impossible. The man I'd been watching drag bodies through his yard was over 130 years old. The same man who'd stood beneath my window making shushing gestures had watched my great-grandparents grow old and die.

I grabbed the most recent photo and ran upstairs, nearly colliding with Eloise at the desk. "Look," I said, jabbing my finger at Darcy's image. "This man. Tell me you see him."

She squinted at the photo, then at me. "See who, honey? That's the Hendersons and the Mackey family at last year's festival."

"No, no—right here." I was practically pressing the photo into her face. "Next to the cotton candy stand. Tall man, thin, hollow eyes."

She looked again, but her eyes seemed to slide right past where Darcy stood. Then something strange happened. Her expression went blank, like a television switching off. She blinked once, twice, and smiled as if we'd just started talking.

"Can I help you find something in the archives, sugar?"

I tried showing her the older photos. Same result. Each time, that blank look, that reset. I started grabbing people as they walked by, thrusting the photos in their faces. "Look at him! Why can't you see him? He's RIGHT THERE!"

A teenage boy backed away from me. "Mom," he called out, "there's a crazy man..."

I was spinning in circles now, waving the photos, my voice rising to a shout. "He's in every picture! Every goddamn festival for over a century! Why can't any of you SEE HIM?"

But their eyes would just glaze over, sliding past the impossible man in the photographs like he was made of smoke.

Security finally showed up—Brad Murphy, who I remembered from high school. We shared a cigarette once behind the science shed, shortly after his girlfriend Stacey Anaham drowned in the Chisholm river. He took one look at me, sweat-soaked and wild-eyed, and reached for his radio. "Sir, I'm going to need you to calm down."

I shoved the 1896 photo in his face. "Tell me you see him, Brad. Tell me I'm not crazy."

That same glazed look came over his face. When it cleared, he was already reaching for his handcuffs. "Sir, you need to leave. Now."

They escorted me out into the parking lot. As the doors closed behind me, I heard Eloise’s cheerful voice: "Welcome to Driftwood Public Library! Can I help you find something?"

I sat in my car until my hands stopped shaking, the stack of photocopied pictures scattered across my passenger seat. The sun was setting, painting the sky the color of a fresh bruise. And there, in my rearview mirror, I saw him.

Darcy was standing on the sidewalk, watching me. Our eyes met in the reflection. He raised one skeletal finger to his lips.

I watched him turn and walk away.

That's when I knew. I couldn't ignore this anymore. That night, when he made his regular trek into the woods, I was going to follow him. I needed to know what was out there. Needed to know why no one else could see him, why this town seemed to forget him every time his name was mentioned.

I needed to know what he’d been feeding.

So that night I waited by the window, and sure enough, Darcy emerged, dragging that body-shaped back after him. I had to hurry and took to the stairs two at a time to reach the front door. I’d dressed in dark clothes and had a backpack waiting by the front door with a variety of tools and contingency measures.

I jumped the fence into Darcy’s backyard. The yard was pitch black, save for the faint glow of the moon cutting through the trees. I had no plan, no real idea what I was doing, but the sense that I was being drawn somewhere pushed me forward.

The ground beneath my feet was uneven—slick and treacherous—and the dense thicket of trees and overgrown brush tangled around my legs as I fought my way through. The sound of my feet crushing dead leaves echoed too loudly in the stillness of the night, but somewhere in the distance, there was something else—something I couldn’t quite place at first.

It sounded like a woman. His latest victim, perhaps?

At first, I thought I was hearing things, but the voice seemed to grow clearer the more I moved. Muffled, as if behind a wall, or trapped somewhere deep in the woods.

Then, I saw it—a structure in the distance, almost hidden by the undergrowth. The faintest hint of light glinted off something metallic. A storm cellar, deep in the woods.

The storm cellar doors were ancient iron, crusted with rust that flaked off blood-red in the moonlight. I hid behind a thicket of nearby bushes, waiting, breath shallow. Darcy finally emerged alone, and took a moment to seal the storm cellar door shut with an iron chain. He then shuffled back through the forest towards his house. I waited until his crooked form was long gone. My hands shook as I approached with the bolt cutters I’d packed. The metal chain snapped with a sound like breaking bones.

The steps descended into darkness. The air grew thicker as I descended, carrying a sickly-sweet perfume that reminded me of funeral homes. Beneath it was something worse—the metallic tang of blood and the putrid scent of decay. And it was hot. Sweltering, like stepping into a sauna

The basement was *wrong*. Not just the obvious wrong of the blood-slicked floor or the surgical implements arranged with loving precision on steel tables. It was wrong in a way that made my eyes hurt trying to process it. The room seemed to stretch and contract like a breathing thing, walls rippling with shadows that moved independent of my flashlight's beam.

Then I noticed the collections.

Glass cases lined the walls like a grotesque jewelry store display. Eyes floating in preservation fluid, arranged by color like paint swatches. Strips of skin stretched on frames like tanned leather, sorted by tone and texture. Hair of every shade hung like silk curtains, each strand perfectly cleaned and styled. Teeth gleamed in velvet-lined boxes, organized by whiteness and shape. Fingers, whole hands, ears, lips—all preserved, all labeled, all arranged with an artist's eye for beauty.

In the center of it all stood a vanity mirror, ancient and ornate, its surface black with age. Then something moved in its mercury reflection.

I saw her before I turned around. The thing that called itself Levina.

She was beautiful and horrifying in equal measure, like a Renaissance painting left to rot. Her form seemed to shift and flow, never quite settling on a single arrangement of features. One moment she had porcelain skin and ruby lips, the next her flesh was translucent, showing the borrowed muscles writhing beneath. Her eyes—God, her eyes—they changed color with each blink, cycling through her collection like a carousel of stolen beauty.

She wore what I first thought was a dress, but as my flashlight beam caught it, I realized it was skin—dozens of patches of human skin stitched together with surgical precision, each piece chosen for its particular shade and smoothness. Her hair was a tapestry of different colors and textures. She'd opted for blonde that night—the mane of pale silver stark in the dim light of the room, a tastefully blended array of hair plucked from an untold number of skulls.

She stood before her mirror, delicately attempting to attach a fresh pair of lips to her face. They didn't want to stay—the flesh was too fresh, still dripping. I watched in horror as she painstakingly stitched them into place with a curved needle, humming tunelessly through her new mouth.

That's when I saw the name carved into the mirror's frame: LEVIATHAN.

"Stop!"

Darcy's voice cracked through the basement like a whip. I whirled around. He stood at the bottom of the stairs, more alive than I'd ever seen him. His leathery face was twisted with open pleading. Shuffling as quickly as he could, he positioned himself between me and Levina.

"You’re Maggie’s boy alright," he grunted, his voice gutteral. "Only the blood of Christendom could see me, boy or not. You don’t know what you’re doing here, son. Don’t think you’re bein’ a hero. She has to stay here. She has to stay *contained*."

Levina had turned from her mirror, her borrowed features arranging themselves into something like curiosity. A dimple appeared in her right cheek, then migrated to her left. Her eyes—now sapphire blue, now honey brown, now emerald green—fixed on me with predatory interest.

"She's imprisoned here," I said, my voice stronger than I felt. "Look at these chains, these—"

"Imprisoned?" Darcy laughed, but there was no humor in it. "Boy, those chains aren't to keep her in. They're to give her something to pretend to be *bound* by. As long as she has her games, her collections, she stays willingly."

"You're insane." I started backing toward the stairs. "I'm calling the police, the FBI, someone—"

"Like you did before?" His eyes were pleading now. "She makes them forget. Makes them all forget. It's our arrangement. I bring her what she needs, and she keeps me hidden, keeps us both safe. Keeps everyone safe."

"Safe from what?"

"From what she’s capable of if you let her out.’

“Why? Who—\*what—\*is she?”

“Somethin’ old. Somethin’ hungry.’

I think I understood what he meant. The girl, the creature, was looking at me now with open curiosity. A jerking, childlike interest with a tongue that wasn’t hers running along a bottom lip she’d just sewn onto a face of stolen features. I felt it in the air. This darkness. This warping, twisted foulness that shouldn’t be. I felt sweat trickle down my spine.

"I made a deal," Darcy continued. "Promised to be her curator, her collector. Keep her satisfied. She wants the very best. Jealous, see, envious of all those pretty people out there. She's given me two centuries to perfect the art of selection. The perfect eyes, the finest skin... like a jeweler choosing diamonds."

"I'll leave," I said, backing toward the stairs. "I won't tell anyone. I promise."

Darcy's face softened with genuine regret. "I'm sorry, son. I truly am. But like I warned your mother before you—best to let some things rot."

Movement caught my eye—a doorway I hadn't noticed before, darkness spilling from it like ink. In that darkness, I saw pieces. Dozens of corpses in various states of decay, twisted and broken, discarded like empty gift wrapping after Levina had taken what she wanted. The rejects. The ones that weren't pretty enough.

I knew in that moment, that was gonna be me.

So when Darcy lunged, I was ready. He’d been ancient for two centuries now, and it showed. He acted like a man who was used to taking his victims by surprise, had seldom ever won them over through sheer strength alone. I swung the bolt cutters hard, caught him in the temple. The sound of splintering skull echoed throughout the room. He crashed into a shelf of specimen jars and landed in a broken, bloodied heap. Glass shattered. Preserved eyes rolled across the floor like marbles, their delicate surfaces splicing against glittering shards.

The sound Levina made wasn't quite a scream. It was deeper, older—like metal tearing, like the death rattle of something vast and ancient. She fell to her knees among the broken glass, desperately trying to gather the ruined eyes. Her face cycled through expressions of grief that belonged to a hundred different people. She cradled each damaged eye like a beloved pet, her borrowed features twisting with childlike anguish.

Then she turned those ever-changing eyes on me, they spelt my death. She stood, I backed away. Hit a wall.

"Wait!" I held up my hands. "Please. Let me explain."

She paused, head tilting at an impossible angle.

I remember standing there, terror flooding my brain, words forming on my tongue. And I remember looking down at Darcy, now dead, thinking about how old he’d been, and how long he’d lived. Then I thought of my cancer, eating away at my pancreas and my guts, worming its way up my spine and spreading its tendrils of apathetic destruction across my brain.

And wasn't that fitting? My whole life had been one long exercise in dying slowly. A father who hung himself rather than face what he felt for me. A mother who tried to starve the boy out of me, who dressed me up like her personal doll and called it love. Foster homes where I learned that survival meant being whatever people wanted me to be. Fifteen years working shit jobs, living on cigarettes and dollar store food, watching my youth slip away one minimum wage paycheck at a time.

The universe had been trying to kill me since the day I was born. Now it had finally succeeded, and here I was, face to face with a chance to make a pact with the devil.

And just like that, it came tumbling out. The most silver-tongued, tailor-made bullshit I’d even spun, sliding off my tongue like liquid mercury, sweet and poisonous. I looked into those eyes that morphed between brilliant gem tones and an all-consuming black, spilling my heart out to the patchwork demon that lived in the storm cellar. I told her I’d been watching her secretly for years, that I was jealous, envious of Darcy to have her all to himself. That I couldn’t stand seeing him bring her such inferior specimens. That she deserved better, that she needed someone who understood *true* beauty.

Throughout, she crept closer, movements liquid and wrong, like a spider pretending to be human. In her hands, she clutched a pair of ruined green eyes, glass fragments still embedded in their surface.

"And if you make me like him,” I continued, fighting every instinct to run. “If you make me like him—if you give me long life like you gave Darcy—I could stay with you forever. Bring you the most exquisite pieces."

She considered me with that childlike intensity, head tilted too far to one side. I nodded toward the ruined eyes in her hands.

"You want green eyes?" I whispered. "I know where to find the most beautiful green eyes you've ever seen. Like sunlight through leaves. Let me prove myself to you. Let me be your new curator."

That caught her attention. It was odd. An dark expression flashed across her mangled features, and I understood. Jealousy. Envy. She’d couldn’t stand the thought that somewhere out there, there existed a pair of eyes more than the dozen she’d carefully preserved. I could use that against her. Woman, creepy storm drain creature—all the same. Scratch away at their insecurities, and you could get anything you wanted.

‘Would you like that?’ I pressed, stepping closer. ‘Would you like even prettier eyes?’

Then she smiled—an emotionless, hungry thing that revealed black gums. And she nodded.

I texted James that very night. Told him I was sorry for pushing him away, that the fear of dying had made me crazy. Asked if he wanted to come over, maybe talk about us.

He arrived wearing that gentle smile I'd once found so charming. His eyes—those perfect green eyes—caught the moonlight as he walked up my front steps.

"I'm so glad you called," he said.

I let him in.

That was three months ago. I jump every time I go down into that cellar and see James’ familiar eyes peer out at me from the dark. I stare into their familiar green haze each time Levina wraps her rotting arms around my neck and presses freshly stitched lips against my own. I think she knows I have a soft spot for them. She hates that. It makes her jealous.

So there you are. My confession, my truth, my damnation—whatever you want to call it. I've been digging through old records, piecing together Levina's origins. She’s been down there a while. I think my dear dead mother was mixed up in it somehow—I found a box of those white robes the Brides of Christendom freaks like the wear, hidden up in the attic. When you actually start to look into them, loads of freaky shit starts to surface. I’ve tried asking Levina when she’s in a particularly receptive mood—I sourced her some great hair the other day, a natural redhead. She doesn’t say much—or at all, really—but she gets real excited when I mention the Church.

But honestly? I don't really care about any of that. Not anymore.

The cancer's gone now—Levina's gift for my faithful service. She's teaching me her art, though I doubt I'll ever match her skill with a needle. Sometimes, in the deepest part of night, I catch glimpses of what she truly is behind all those borrowed pieces. Something vast. Primordial. A hunger that could swallow the world.

I know she'll get out eventually. Murphy's law—anything that can happen, will happen. When she does—well. May God be with us all. She's keeping herself contained for now, content with her pretty trinkets and her games of dress-up. But one day she’ll get bored, drive herself crazy with envy thinking of all the people up there, living lives she can’t have. And if she can’t have them, she’ll take them.

But I've made my choice. A chance at decades instead of months. As I’ve proven, there’s very little I wouldn’t do for that chance.

I have to go now—there’s a girl two towns over I’ve had my eye on. I’ve been following her long enough that I know her routine—not that she notices. Nobody ever notices me anymore. She has the most amazing collarbones. Levina's going to love them.

Judge me if you want. I'll be too busy living to care.
