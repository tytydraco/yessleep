It's over, Reddit. It's finally over.

I did something so incredibly stupid, but it had to happen. I went to my house for C's birthday (without a plan, mind you), and I still can't process what went down. I wish I could say it ended in a dramatic show or a spectacle beyond words, but it was a quiet, mostly bloodless affair. I also will apologize for the change in writing style, but I don't think I can write it the way I have been.

J drove me over and waited in the car because I didn't want her getting hurt, and she gave me a knife and wished me luck. I walked in, and the scent of blood hit me train-style. It was coming from the kitchen, so I went in there. According to her, I screamed like a banshee, but I guess my mind blocked it out.

Mom and Dad were seated, hands on unopened gifts, blood running down from their torn-out throats. I know I hit the ground, and the sight still haunts me. That's when I heard singing. Not any sort of eerie nursery rhyme or lullaby, just "Singing in the Rain," followed by "I'm Always Chasing Rainbows."

C was at the head of the table, the one that faces the windows. Gore stained her mouth, but her eyes were bright and shining. She looked like a bloody combination of the two of us. Half her hair was gray-is pale blonde, half black. One eye was light green, the other brown. Her dress was sewn together from different dresses we had, and her face....was wrong. It was as though someone had cut individual pieces off us and stitched them onto someone else. Neither her nor me.

The only true part of her that remained was the big, pastel pink bow in her hair. When she spoke, her voice was almost her own. Still the same, soft monotone I'd grown up with, but she spoke with my inflections and pronunciations. As she went on, multiple voices overlapped, and everything we said is burned into my memory.

"It's my birthday," she said with a sweet smile. I remember wanting to scream at her. "Say it."

"H-Happy birthday?" The words were choked, but she didn't care. She laughed and picked me up, moving too fluidly for a human, and dumped me in a chair near her. "What did you do?"

"Oh, you know. A thing here, a thing there." Her lips split apart in an eerie mockery of enthusiasm, and the effect was worse than any horror movie.

"What did you do to my sister?" I asked.

The copycat shook her head and shrugged. I know she looked sad for a second, but that was covered up quickly. She began to eat some cake, just scooping it into her mouth with her bare hands. She didn't focus on me, and I don't know if I should be grateful for that or not. She continued to eat as though her life depended on it, maybe it did, who knows? After a while, she stood up to limp over to the sink, and her ankle snapped when she put it down. As she lifted her leg up, the shattered bone mended before my eyes. She washed her hands and sat back down.

C pulled a chess board out from a chair and set it up, giving me the white pieces, and we began to play. I'm rubbish at chess, but I did my absolute best. There was a moment that made me laugh despite the absurdity of it all. When I got my pawn to her side of the board, she picked it up and ate it. As horrid as the crunching sounds were, it was something she'd joked about doing forever.

"Why do humans eat?" she asked sometime into the game. "Why do birds caw? Why do we laugh and cry and scream and hate and love and rejoice? Does anyone know?"

"I don't," I admitted, and she hummed and shrugged. "It might just be how we are."

"L-A-M-E! Lame," she said, giggling. She turned her mismatched eyes on me and ate another piece, one of her rooks. "Humans are so boring. You get sad too easily. This body, this host, she did dare to fight back, you know. Even now, I can feel her clawing away at me. It sucks. She really needs to stop, I can't think straight."

"Good!" My words came out hot, and she blinked and popped a bishop into her mouth. "Let her go!"

"Nah. She's mine now, mine forever."

"Why?"

"Why not? Her mind was enough. More than yours would ever be."

"Why copy? Why hurt everyone? What is wrong with you?" I finally snapped.

She shrugged. "It's funny."

"I hate you so goddamn much."

C rolled her eyes, knocked over my knight with her queen, and said, "She was real happy to let me in at first. Said it was a dream come true. She didn't understand how long it would take to get to you, but hey, I was just starting out, too."

"What are you?" I asked.

"A demon, duh." She acted like I was stupid for asking. "You humans always think demons are these scary, soul-sucking creatures. Some of us just wanna have fun."

"What's your name?" I asked, moving my pawn.

She stuck her tongue out at me and scoffed. "I'm not that dumb."

"Fine. How old was C when you possessed her?" That was a question I'd been scared to hear the answer for.

"Pretty young. I'm bad with ages," she said, and I had begun to hyperventilate.

How much of C did I really know? How much of her was copied? Those thoughts still plague me.

The copycat paused and tilted her head to the side. She grabbed my king and ate him, then stood up again and ripped the hair bow out. She pinned it in my hair and patted my head, and I could watch as she went to the door and looked back at me.

"Goodbye, Tessie. I'll miss you lots." She saluted and left.

It's been a few days, and I'm still in shock. C is long gone, my parents are dead, and I'm about to drop. All I could do was grab my cat and go out to J's car. She and I stayed in her room all day, and I'm going to live with her until I can go to college and get a decent job. I know I need to get the cops involved, but I can't bring myself to pick up the phone. We have no camera or anything, no proof I didn't go mad, no proof my sister was the one to.....

My mind keeps replaying those final words over and over and over. Why did she speak in my sister's voice?
