I park in Spot 16 every morning. It’s back near the exit, far from the chaos of the kiss-and-go lane where other parents double-park, pile out of their cars, and turn the whole place into a zoo. I hate that mess. Spot 16 is safe. Out of the way. Traffic’s always lighter there, too. It’s been my spot for years now, and it makes things feel... right.

But today, Spot 16 was taken.

It was the first thing I noticed when I pulled into the lot, my fingers tightening around the steering wheel as I saw the red SUV sitting there like it belonged. My stomach twisted, and for a second, I thought about waiting it out, but there was no time. The line of cars behind me was growing, impatient. People pulling in, jamming up the lot, horns already blaring. The usual chaos.

I circled once, heart thudding a little harder than it should have. Spot 15 was too close to the crosswalk. Too many kids darting out like they owned the place. Spot 17 was right next to that big oak tree, where birds shit all over your windshield. No thanks.

And then I saw it—Spot 13.

I’d always avoided it, though I couldn’t really tell you why. Something about it just felt *wrong*. It wasn’t in a bad location, not really. Three spaces down from 16. But I never parked there. Call it a gut feeling. Or maybe it was the number. Thirteen has a way of worming its way into your brain, convincing you it’s unlucky, even though you know better. Superstitions die hard.

But there weren’t many options, and I didn’t want to cause a scene by driving around the lot like an idiot. I sighed, told myself it was fine, and pulled into Spot 13.

The second I turned off the engine, I felt it. Like the air had changed. Heavier. My chest tightened. I leaned over to kiss my son goodbye, my hand shaking a little as I said, “Have a good day, buddy.” He gave me a quick smile and ran toward the school entrance. I watched him until he disappeared inside. That uneasy feeling lingered, gnawing at me.

I locked the car and walked toward the office to sign some paperwork for the PTA. But with every step, I couldn’t shake it. Something felt wrong. The day was off, like I was walking through thick, invisible mud. I kept telling myself it was just because my routine had been thrown off. Spot 16 was my spot, after all, and there was a reason I parked there. Routine keeps things in order. Keeps me in order.

When I came back out, the lot had emptied. Most of the parents had cleared out, their cars gone, leaving only a few scattered vehicles. I headed toward my car, Spot 13 in sight. But something was wrong.

My car wasn’t there.

I stopped, blinking in confusion. I was looking right at Spot 13, but it was empty. Completely empty. My car was *gone*.

I walked up and down the row, my pulse starting to race, scanning every space. Spot 12—no car. Spot 14—nothing. I checked Spot 16, even though I knew it was still occupied by that damn red SUV. I circled the lot again, my stomach tightening with each step.

It was like the car had vanished.

I felt the panic rising, so I headed to the security office, my hands shaking as I explained what had happened. The guard was calm, almost too calm, like he dealt with this sort of thing every day. “What spot did you park in?” he asked, flipping through his clipboard.

“Spot 13,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady.

He frowned. “Spot 13?”

“Yeah. Near the second row. Right next to Spot 12.”

He looked at me with confusion in his eyes, his fingers tapping the clipboard. “Ma’am, we don’t have a Spot 13.”

I stared at him. “What?”

He shook his head. “There’s no Spot 13 in this lot. It skips from 12 to 14. Always has.”

I stood there, my heart pounding in my ears. “But I *parked* there. I know I did.”

He scratched his head and looked at the lot through the window. “Maybe you got the wrong row. Happens sometimes.”

I rushed back out to the lot, heart slamming against my ribs. I knew I hadn’t made a mistake. I *parked* in Spot 13. But as I walked through the rows again, that uneasy feeling gnawed at me like a warning.

And then I saw it.

My son’s backpack. It was sitting on the curb, right where he must have dropped it when he got out of the car. I picked it up, the dread now clawing at my throat. His backpack shouldn’t have been there.

I looked back toward the school. The parking lot was completely empty now. My car was still gone.

And so was my son.
