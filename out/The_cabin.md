There were six of us when we started.

Me, Josh, Lina, Amir, Val, and Nico. We’d been planning the hike for weeks—up in the Rockies, two days in, one day out. We’d all done tougher hikes before, but we underestimated the weather. Bad call. The blizzard came in fast, cutting off the trail and blinding us.

We got lucky—or so we thought—when we found the cabin.

It was half-buried in snow, tucked under a slope of pines. No path leading to it. No power. But the door creaked open, and inside was dry wood, old furniture, and a fireplace. Like something from an old movie.

And in the back room, on the table, was a journal.

Entry One: 

> If you're reading this, you got caught too. Don’t trust the voices outside. They’ll sound like people you know. They’re not. We tried to eat rations first. Then the dogs. We made it 12 days. Then James disappeared.



We all thought it was a joke. An edgy prank journal left by campers. Josh laughed, but Lina didn’t. She said the handwriting didn’t look fake. Amir pointed out there were no animal tracks outside. No birds. No wind either, like the snow was pressing in around the cabin.

That night, we heard knocking.

Not on the door. On the walls. Like someone tapping with their fingers. Nico opened the front door and shouted into the snow. Nothing. No echo. Just thick, unnatural silence.

Entry Two: 

> It took Sarah last night. She stepped outside to pee. We found her boot. Just one. The prints circled the cabin four times before disappearing. Something’s out there. It doesn’t come in, but it’s watching. Waiting.



Val didn’t sleep that night. She kept staring at the window, swearing she saw a shape in the trees. She said it looked human but wrong. Too thin. Too tall. Its head tilted, like it was listening.

Then Josh vanished.

He went to get more wood from the back shed. He was gone five minutes. When we found the shed, the door was open. Inside was a smear of something dark on the snow. Not blood. Blacker. Thicker. His flashlight was lying upright on the ground, still on.

Entry Four: 

> It mimics their voices. James said my name last night. But James is dead. It’s getting smarter. It’s always hungry. I tried not to look at it. But I saw it once, in the reflection of the window. It has no eyes.



We’re three days in. Rations are low. The storm hasn’t let up.

Last night, Amir said he heard Josh whispering to him. Saying he was cold. That he was alive, just outside. Val tried to block the door, but Amir pushed her away. We had to hold him back.

Lina found something scratched into the underside of the table:

> "Eat or be eaten. It feeds on starvation. It waits for the weak."



Val’s fingers are turning blue. Nico won’t talk anymore. Lina’s feverish. And I swear the cabin is smaller than it was when we arrived.

Then Amir found the skull.

He was trying to dig through the snow by the shed when his shovel struck something hard. It wasn’t a rock. He brought it in—this bleached, twisted thing. It looked half-deer, half-human. Antlers curved like branches. Hollow eye sockets, with long teeth in a jaw that didn’t belong to any animal we knew.

He said he felt warm holding it.

We begged him to leave it outside. He refused. Said he felt stronger. Less hungry. That night, he sat by the fire cradling the skull like a trophy.

Then, he started talking in his sleep. Muttering in a language none of us knew. At one point, he stood in front of the mirror and tried to wear the skull like a mask. It didn’t fit—but he jammed it over his face anyway. We had to stop him. Lina cried. Val threw it into the fire.

It didn’t burn.

Entry Six:

> It wants a vessel. A body to wear. It can’t come inside unless invited. But once it finds a host… it doesn’t need to knock. I heard Sarah’s laugh in my own voice. I think it's inside me now.



That night, Nico disappeared.

And Amir is still staring into the mirror.

I don’t think it’s Amir anymore.

Entry Seven 

Val was next. She started talking to herself, pacing the cabin. Then one morning, she was gone. No door opened. No window broken. Just gone.

Lina tried to hang on, but her fever took her mind. She started talking like Amir. Same words. Same pauses. The same grin. I woke up and found her standing over me, whispering, "It's not so bad if you just give in."

I ran. Locked myself in the pantry. She scratched at the door for hours. Then silence.

Entry Eight:

I haven’t seen anyone in two days. I think I’m the last one left.

But he’s outside. Amir. Or what’s left of him.

He knocks sometimes. Just once, every hour. Sometimes he uses Josh’s voice. Or Lina’s. Once, he spoke in my own.

"It’s safe now. The storm is over. Come out."

I know it’s lying. But the worst part is... I’m not cold anymore. I'm not hungry. I feel... light.

I caught my reflection in the glass. My eyes looked darker. Not just the color. Like they were deeper. Like something was looking out through them.

The knocking’s getting louder.

I can’t write much longer. My hands are shaking.

He’s at the door.

He’s saying, "I know you're tired. Come see your friends."

I don’t want to be alone anymore.

I’m going to open the door.
