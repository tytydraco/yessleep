When he greeted me like an old friend, I realized I had never told anyone at work who I was.

“Hi, is the REDACTED company on this floor?”



“The REDACTED?” The receptionist thought for a second.



She pulled out a large book and started flipping through the pages.



“REDCATED…REDACTED. Oh yes, it is on this floor. It's the new one. Just down the hall to the left.”



“Thank you.”



The hall had the typical bright white fluorescent lighting and equally white walls with nonsensical paintings hung on them, as if trying to make the place look as unwelcoming as possible.



The office space was differentiated only by rows of desks and computers that were cramped on top of one another.



Was I there too early? It was a Monday at 9 a.m., in mid-April, not a typical out-of-office day.



I walked along the rows, staring down at the desks. All the monitors and keyboards were covered with a thick layer of dust.



“Hello?” I called out.



“Hi!” Someone called out from the back.



I looked over. A line of hair poked out behind a monitor.



I rushed over.



A short man with thick glasses and a military haircut extended his hand.



“Jake, right?”



“Um, yeah.”



“I’m Daniel. Nice to meet you, Jake. You must be the new hire.”



He looked awfully familiar.



“That’s me.”



“Not the warmest welcome, huh?” He laughed.



“No, where is everybody?”



“Most of our team is remote, and the others are staying home. You know, no one wants to get back after the weekend.”



“But that means we have it all to ourselves,” he laughed softly. “You can sit in front of me; that seat is empty.”



It was as dusty as any other.



“You can log in to any computer. The login is your first name, followed by a dot, and then your second name. Don’t forget to set up your password afterward.”



“Okay. Is Oscar coming in today?”



“No, but don’t worry about it. Oscar will send the tasks over.”



“Do you work under him, too?”



“No, no, but we always get a little intro about the new hires. I work in IT. I set up your account,” he smiled and stared at me, not breaking eye contact.



It was good that there was someone to guide me through the tasks, but did it have to be this guy?



I logged into my computer, but there was no Teams or Slack.



“What do we use for messaging?”



“Oh, we use Sensis, it's an amazing encryption app, much better than the others. We also don’t use email.”



I opened it up. There were messages from Oscar. He didn’t have a profile photo.



Oscar sent over an Excel sheet with a notepad attached specifying what I had to do.



I stared at it for a few seconds, biting my lip. I had worked at remote companies, but never anything close to this.



What other choice did I have? I spent all my savings trying to get this job.



Daniel was looking at me from his desk.



“It’s a little weird out here, but at least it’s calm. I usually finish my work early. I’m sure you will, too. We can hang out after and get to know each other!”



I fake-smiled.



The task was fairly trivial. Mostly creating some charts and tables. I finished in less than an hour.



I sent it over to Oscar.



“Wow, quick,” Daniel said.



A chill ran down my spine.



“What?”



“Nothing, nothing. I can just see when someone sends a message. You know IT.” 



I stared at him. He tried to ignore me, frantically typing something on his computer.



A message from Oscar came.



Another Excel task.



My throat started to dry out.



A strange silence filled the office.



Daniel was not typing anymore. I could see his stupid glasses peeking over the screen.



This couldn’t be real. I had to be making it up.



I messaged Oscar asking for an intro call, wanting to see his face.



Only now did I realize I hadn’t seen it before.



Oscar read my message. 



Daniel wasn’t staring at me anymore.



He started typing. The three dots appeared next to Oscar’s name.



“Sorry, I’m not in a place where I can video call. I’m sure Daniel can answer all your questions!”



My mind started spinning. I needed to wash my face.



Daniel stared at me as I got up. He looked like a dog that tore up your favorite shoes.



I turned and began walking to a random door.



Which one was the bathroom again?



I didn’t know and didn’t care.



As I opened the door, I heard Daniel screaming behind me.



My heart sank to my chest.



All over the walls were pictures of me from different ages.



Most were from my social media accounts, but some haven’t been posted anywhere.



They were straight from my mom’s photo albums.



I stumbled back.



Daniel was there to catch me.



“Get the fuck off me,” I screamed, pushed him, and started backing away.



“Jake, Jake, please, it’s not what it looks like.”



“What the fuck do you mean. Who are you?”



“I’m Danny, Danny REDACTED from REDACTED middle school, remember?”



That name sounded so familiar.



“Wait, wait, Danny REDACTED from seventh-grade math?”



“Yes!” Danny screamed out, “You remember!”



He opened his arms to hug me.



“No, you fucking weirdo.”



“Did you really think Oscar was real?”



I hit a wall behind me.



“They never existed, Jake.”



Danny didn’t wait, ran over towards me, and hugged me.



I pushed him off and punched him hard in the face.



He fell to the ground, and out of his pocket fell a knife.



My hands began to shiver.



“Okay, you want it the hard way.”



He picked up the knife and began getting up.



I didn’t wait and sprinted from the office and down the staircase.



On my way down, I heard Danny running behind me.



Adrenaline flowed through my veins.



I didn’t stop until I was six blocks away.



There, I called the police. They came by quickly.



Danny was no longer in the office.



The office was rented under a fake name. They found an automated response script on Jake’s computer. The file was named “Oscar”.



The police attempted to track down Danny. His last address was his mom's house.



She said she hasn’t seen him in years.



I have not been able to sleep since that day.



Nightmares of the room and Danny have haunted me ever since.

Since I no longer had a job, I had to move back in with my parents.

As I’m writing this post, I got a message from an unknown number.



It says: “You look as beautiful as you did on the day you ran away from me.”
