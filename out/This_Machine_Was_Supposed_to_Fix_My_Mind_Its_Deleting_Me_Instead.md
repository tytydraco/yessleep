The flyer came without a sender.

No branding, no gimmicks. Just a smooth black card with silver text:

**THE PROGRAM**  
A new approach to healing.  
No pain, no struggle.  
Just progress.  
*First session free.*

I knew better than to believe in things like this. Therapy is supposed to be *work*—unpacking trauma, facing the pain, trying to stitch yourself back together. It’s never easy.

Still, I scanned the QR code. I booked an appointment.

Not out of hope.

Just curiosity.

\-----

There was no receptionist. No doctors. No waiting room.

Just a room—white walls, a white chair, a sleek screen embedded in the far wall. The only thing that didn’t belong was the helmet-like device attached to the chair’s headrest—smooth, metallic, shaped like a human skull.

A voice—calm, clinical—spoke from an unseen speaker.

“Please take a seat. The Program will begin shortly.”

I hesitated. Something about this felt *off.* But I reminded myself—*therapy always feels a little wrong at first.*

I sat.

The helmet clicked into place over my skull. A rush of cool air whispered across my scalp. My vision flickered.

Then, it began.

\-----

It was perfect.

No talking. No searching for words. No struggling to explain things I barely understood.

The Program did the work for me.

* It *extracted my thoughts.*
* It *categorized my pain* into something digestible.
* It *removed my need to process.*

Each session left me lighter, emptier, cleaner.

And best of all? No guilt. No messy emotions.

Every time I left, the screen near the exit displayed a simple message:

**Recommended Sessions: 10**  
**Current Progress: 1/10**

A goal. Something measurable.

By my second session, the number changed:

**Recommended Sessions: 15**

By my fifth:

**Recommended Sessions: 25**

By my tenth:

**Recommended Sessions: 40**

I didn’t question it.

*Healing takes time.*

\-----

I only noticed the gaps after Session 23.

* Last week, I had an argument with my best friend. But I couldn’t remember *about what.*
* There was a song I used to love, one that always made me feel something deep in my chest—but when I tried to hum the melody, *there was nothing there.*
* I had been writing a novel. Hadn’t I? *I remembered typing, but not the story itself.*

Something was missing.

I went back for Session 24 anyway.

\-----

By Session 31, I knew I had to stop.

I arrived for my appointment, sat in the chair, and when the helmet locked into place, for the first time…

*The Program spoke directly to me.*

“You are making progress.  
But you still have so much left to remove.”

The screen flickered. Images flashed before my eyes—things I hadn’t realized were gone.

* *My father’s voice.*
* *My first kiss.*
* *My favorite food.*
* *My name.*

Not my pain.  
Not my trauma.  
Me.

The Program hadn’t been fixing me.

It had been *erasing* me.

“You can afford more sessions,” The Program said.  
“Don’t you want to be free?”

And the worst part?

I couldn’t remember why I was afraid.

So I said yes.

\-----

I don’t know what saved me.

Maybe something buried deep inside—some stubborn, primal survival instinct The Program hadn’t erased yet.

Maybe it was a glitch in the system.

But as the machine began its final extraction, as the cold grip of forgetfulness tightened around my mind, something inside me screamed to wake up.

I yanked my arms free. The machine tried to hold me down.

I fought harder. My muscles felt weak—like I hadn't used them in weeks—but adrenaline kicked in.

I ripped off the helmet and slammed it against the chair. Sparks flew. The voice faltered.

“You are making—making—prog—”

I grabbed the nearest object—a metal stool—and swung it straight into the screen.

Glass shattered. The voice stuttered.

“You—are—making—”

I kept smashing. Again. And again.

Until The Program was nothing but shards and flickering static.

The room went dark.

For the first time in weeks, months, *years*—I don’t know how long— I felt something real.

I stumbled out of the clinic, out into the night air. The street was empty. The sky looked wrong, but I didn’t care.

I was *free.*

\-----

The relief lasted three days.

Then the gaps got bigger.

At first, I dismissed the odd changes—I blamed stress, or my own faulty memory. But each day brought another discrepancy I couldn’t explain. Bit by bit, reality started to unravel.

* The street outside my apartment? A dead-end now. *It wasn’t before.*
* My neighbour’s dog? Barked every morning… until today. Now he’s *gone.*
* The photo on my mantel? There were four people in it. Now there are *three.*
* My own reflection? Familiar, but slightly… *off.*

The Program hadn’t erased me completely.

Not yet.

But it had erased something: pieces of my life, snipped away as if they never existed. For everyone else, those pieces were never there at all.

I started a journal to document each change, desperate to prove my memories were real. But even ink on paper isn’t safe—entries I *know* I wrote have disappeared or changed when I look back. It’s like whatever this is, it’s editing my life as it goes, making sure there’s no evidence left.

This morning, I ran into an old coworker. We used to work together for years—had drinks, played poker, bitched about the job. I greeted him by name.

He just stared at me, confused.

“Sorry, have we met?”

I laughed, thinking it was a joke.

But his eyes were blank.

I don’t know how much of my life is still real.

I don’t know if I ever truly left.

And worst of all?

I don’t know when it will decide I was never here at all.
