Part 1: Two weeks ago I came from from work, exhausted per usual. A long week of being a door to door vacuum salesman (yes, I know, unusual) but it pays the bills for a single guy who doesn't have anything or anyone to spend his money on rather than his car and PC build; I started to experience something quite unusual, at first I thought nothing of it that I was just hearing things, or possibly seeing things due to sleep deprivation but. If only I'd figured that out sooner, I'm writing this to you with the strongest sense of urgency, so I'm sorry if it seems I'm rambling on a little scattered brained. I am completely out of options, I no longer can think of any way out but to reach out online so you don't make the same mistake I do, there isn't much time left. 

You're probably wondering, what the heck is this guy going on about well I'm in more than a panic, every atom in my body is terrified, every hair, every fiber of my being.

Every time I close a door, something tries to get in. It all started two weeks ago , did I say that already? I met this lady, my usual customer type, single mother who I can pitch my amaaaazing wonder vacuum to,

"Your house is just going to get cleaner by this thing sitting in your living room ma'am!"
 
I said my same old line enthusiastically ending my friendly pitch. But this was different, I was nervous for once in my life, because I could feel her nervousness (I've always been that way) She looked like she made a mistake by talking to me, by opening the door to her home, something in her eyes told me, she'd let something out as crazy as it sounded. I searched her soul for a spark, something, say anything... Until finally, she spoke. 

"I'm so sorry, but now it's with you"

"Excuse me ma'am, what?" The door to her beautiful Spanish type home creaked closed as he stared at me in sorrow. 

I had many questions, was she waiting for someone to come knocking at her door? Was she mentally ill? Something just told me, you ever have a gut feeling? I had a bad gut feeling, no, a really, really bad gut feeling. But naaaaah you know what! I shook it off, she's a crazy lady I'll move on to the next house.... I never spoke to another human being that day, every house I knocked on, no one answered, and the closer I got to a door of any kind, the stronger the sensation of feeling like I'm being followed grew.

I began to question my senses, what's wrong with me, what's going on?
That was until I got home that night.

The moment keeps replaying in my head, I threw my bag down on the floor after barging through the front door, took off my golf shift & dress pants combo that seemingly has became a staple for me, time to do the ol' bathroom routine, oh. I left the front door open, silly me. I closed it..

Moments later I found myself staring at a doorknob that I swear to you was wiggling from the moment I closed the door, for about 5 minutes. I didn't know what to think man, am I going crazy? Okay let's map this out, I'm feeling like I'm being followed, and now someone's trying to get in. I grabbed my pistol, made sure there was one in the chamber (My memory sucks) and crept to the peephole in rhe door, I couldn't tell you what's worse. The doorknob still wiggling slightly and someone being there behind it, or no one being there. Want to guess which one I saw? Nothing. Nada, zip, there's no one there and it's still moving. 

I backed away slowly from the door, and told myself I'm just losing my mind. Too many vacuums... So I made myself a cup of water, a little snack, and after plummetting into the couch in the den for a few hours I decided it was off to bed, mind you the front door is on the other end of my townhouse, but I do have to pass by it to get to my bedroom which is in the hallway directly to the left of the front door as you walk in. Still jiggling, still shaking, no changes what so ever, I stared at the door handle for quite some time before I decided I need rest and headed to my ever so elegant bedroom (it's a mattress on the floor and a small dresser) 

You're not going to believe me... The moment I shut my bedroom door behind me... The handle starts to jiggle. But this time I swear it's slightly different, more intentional, faster, barely louder. 

I hear something else, I lean in closely.
I hear whispering.
