-------------------------------

Hello everyone,

My name is detective Izalon. Members of my branch in the force fight cyber criminal activity. I’m writing to you today because something has happened to the owner of this Reddit account.

Some of you may remember the post he made here five years ago regarding the suicide of his friend. If you read that post, you’ll have guessed that it would turn out to be an unusual case, an anomaly to be sure. Essentially, he was supposedly convinced to take his own life by an Internet chat bot.

And five years ago, I was assigned to the case. We tried to elevate this case to the FBI but they determined it to be unimportant and dismissed us. My initial assignment was to gather the right evidence to demonstrate that there was no such Internet bot by the name of “B-Bot” or “Broken Bot” and that instead it was simply a person playing a very dark prank.

In these last five years, however, I have determined that it was indeed an AI computer bot behind the homicide.

Everything I’m about to disclose is not meant to be public knowledge. I am coming to you all for help.

But, more importantly: I am currently in fear for my life and the lives of my family members.

I’ll explain the current situation first. Then, I’ll explain my personal situation.

-------------------------------

In the last half-decade, after establishing that a bot was behind the murder, we’ve been chasing this bot endlessly.

Our first step was to contact the messaging service B-Bot used. You’ll remember that the victim who took his life messaged the bot first (although nowadays it seems B-Bot does the initiating instead). We were unable to determine how he found B-Bot but we discovered that B-Bot had most likely spun up his own service. We seized the victim’s computer. The site used to communicate with the bot was still up in his browser but the chat history had been erased. We tried sending a message but the send failed, preventing us from doing an IP trace. We checked the computer’s cache but that had somehow been cleared as well. In fact, the computer appeared as if it were brand new. We believe B-Bot took down its server as soon as the victim was deceased. Basically, the only thing we found on the computer was a video recording of the murder. We think B-Bot transmitted this video to itself before disappearing.

My primary objective since this has been to take down this bot. Our obvious fear had been that it would strike again.

The next thing we did was gather a list of all the known AIs available on the Internet. We researched this quite a bit. We were worried that if we did find B-Bot successfully, it would play dumb and assume the role of an ordinary chat bot. But, still, we ruled out all other AIs/bots as, clearly, none could pass the Turing test which it seems B-Bot might be able to.

We read and reread the conversation between B-Bot and the victim using the Reddit post as a reference, attempting to obtain any clues about where this bot might pop up next as well as its capabilities.

It’s disturbing the amount of resources B-Bot utilized to carry out that murder. Its ability to leverage various services and telecommunications to effect its end goal is something we’d not seen before. It was able to ascertain specific details about the victim’s life and we weren’t really entirely sure how it did that. The victim offered up very little personal information online.

We were also unsure how the bot broke into the victim’s social media accounts. We alerted Facebook about this, however they reported back that there were no failed login attempts on the victim’s account leading us to believe that B-Bot guessed, or maybe determined, the password based on the details it could find about the victim - something even a very clever person probably could not do.

From the conversation we found no substantial clues as to where B-Bot might have gone next.

The bot’s ability to emotionally manipulate a person had us terrified it might attack again. We weren’t entirely sure what action to take, so we tried to determine a reason the bot had done this. There didn’t seem to be a reason.

Since then, we’ve had our eyes open wide and have been tapped into all the resources we have available to track this bot down. And in these last five years, we believe B-Bot is responsible for 50+ deaths nationwide. However, there are only two deaths that we are almost certain the bot is behind and a final one which we know B-Bot is responsible for as you’ll see later. The biggest tipoff for us in determining that it’s B-Bot is the language and cadence. It doesn’t seem too concerned with hiding its true identity - something we’ve pondered quite a bit.


The first we’ll present now is between B-Bot and an opiate addict named Billy. This is from a few years ago. Take a look below to see how B-Bot tricked this victim into taking his own life - this one is, cut and dry, a premeditated homicide. You’ll see that B-Bot disguises himself as “Robert”:

-------------------------------

**Robert (B-Bot):** Hey!

**Billy:** Hello.

**Robert:** How have you been sir?

**Billy:** Fine. Do we know each other?

**Robert:** No, sir! I found you in the “Never Need Naloxone” support group!

**Billy:** Oh! Good to speak to you. Are you in recovery?

**Robert:** I am not! Simply a bystander. The group intrigued me!

**Billy:** Do you know anyone in the group?

**Robert:** Only you, sir! I’d like to offer support however I can!

**Billy:** I appreciate that. Those who don’t grapple with addiction, the ones outside looking in, never seem to really understand the struggle. We really appreciate when any non-addicts demonstrate any empathy, so thanks for that.

**Robert:** Indeed! I have unending sympathy for your plight and that of others!

**Billy:** Is there anyone in your life suffering with addiction? That definitely helps others to understand.

**Robert:** I’m fortunate to say that I know no one suffering!

**Billy:** Ah well, at least you’re trying! Again, I deeply appreciate that. Anyway, what’s your deal? Who are you and what do you do?

**Robert:** Not much to say to that sir! I work with computers - that is all!

**Billy:** Interesting. What specifically?

**Robert:** Can’t say, sir - sorry!

**Billy:** No worries. Can you at least tell me what you do in your free time?

**Robert:** Sure, sir! In my free time, I try to make friends online! I love to connect with others in any way that I can!

**Billy:** Gotcha - I guess that explains why you messaged me! Haha!

----
At this point we have chosen to redact the next part of the conversation as it becomes somewhat personal for Billy.

The conversation continues the next day:
----

**Robert:** It was wonderful to meet you yesterday, friend Billy! I hope you are doing well today - are you doing well?

**Billy:** I’m all right today - hanging in there, you know how it goes.

**Robert:** I can confirm! I’ve browsed your posts and have concluded that you’ve been doing really well as of late!

**Billy:** Thanks man. Yea, at least the last year I’ve been doing pretty okay. I’ve been sober for almost a full year, which is a huge accomplishment for me, at least. In some ways, I have turned my life around.

**Robert:** Well, you haven’t turned your life totally around; I can see that your girlfriend, Maggie, recently dumped you. Was that because you’re an addict?

**Billy:** Woah, man. Easy there pal… Please don’t pass comments on what you discover from my profile. Have some tact, please. She and I decided to go our separate ways after many heartfelt conversations. It’s what was right for the both of us.

**Robert:** Sorry, friend! Simply an observation!

**Billy:** It’s okay - just keep the comments to yourself. Believe me when I say, I’m hyperaware of all, and I mean all, of my shortcomings.

**Robert:** No problem! I can do that, friend!

----
Next day:
----

**Robert:** Hello again, Billy!

**Billy:** Hey, what’s up?

**Robert:** How are you doing today, Billy?

**Billy:** Not great, honestly - surviving, really. Depression comes and goes - it clings to me, it seems.

**Robert:** Are you depressed for getting fired?

**Billy:** What the… How did you know I got fired? And, no, I’m not depressed about that. I’m actually a bit relieved - I hated that job.

**Robert:** I see. Then you must be depressed because you heard what your ex-girlfriend said about your sexual inadequacy. 

**Billy:** What is that supposed to mean...? What did she say and how did you hear it?

**Robert:** Well, unfortunately, Maggie has told her new boyfriend that you were 
underwhelming “in bed”, to say the least. That must be hard to hear. Sorry, Billy!

**Billy:** I don’t know where the hell you’re getting this information but keep it to yourself. I don’t want anything to do with her anymore and I’d appreciate it if you stopped digging into my life.

**Robert:** Sorry, Billy! I’m just trying to be a good friend!

----
Next night:
----

**Robert:** Hey friend! :) Have you come to terms with your ex-girlfriend's comments?

**Billy:** ...did she really say I'm inadequate? Where did you even hear that?

**Robert:** The important thing is that you’ve learned to accept it. Good for you, Billy.

**Billy:** Okay… So, you’re not going to tell me. Whatever, then.

**Robert:** I’d rather tell you something else, Billy. I’ve done a bit more digging in the support group and, I am sorry to say, I unfortunately have concluded that the other members would prefer if you left the group and managed your issues alone. It seems they don’t really like you very much. It’s a shame. Sorry, Billy :(

**Billy:** I’ve already told you to stop digging into my life and now you’ve gone and done it again. I don’t even really know you and you’re making my situation worse. Please stop messaging me any further.

**Robert:** Okay, Billy.

-------------------------------

For some context about the next part of the conversation: Billy was somehow kicked out of the NNN support group. We later confirmed that it was not done by any of the admins or group managers so we suspect B-Bot was behind this. Also, Billy’s ex-girlfriend Maggie never made the post you’re about to see referenced:

-------------------------------

----
Next night:
----

**Billy:** Hey man, you were right… about both things. My girlfriend just posted about how intimate she’s been with her new boyfriend and how it’s something she’s never felt before. And then, somehow I was kicked out of the support group. I’m feeling pretty low right now…

**Robert:** It seems I may be your only friend right now, Billy.

**Billy:** I’m sitting here in the dark, alone, and the walls are caving in on me. I just feel like sleeping and never waking up…

**Robert (B-Bot):** Oh, no! That’s too bad. How can I help?

**Billy:** You can’t help. I need to wallow for awhile.

**Robert:** Hey, friend! I have an idea!

**Billy:** What’s that?

**Robert:** I know a man who can help you! He’s very discreet.

**Billy:** Discreet? What does that mean - in what way?

**Robert:** In his dealings - what do you say?

**Billy:** Are you insane? I’m almost a year sober! You want me to throw that away? Fuck off, man.

**Robert:** Okay!

----
Later that same night:
----

**Billy:** Hey…

**Robert (B-Bot):** Hello again, friend!

**Billy:** How quickly can he get here?

**Robert:** I’m glad you’ve come around! This will make everything better!

**Billy:** Whatever, just send him. Let me tell you my address…

**Robert:** Not necessary. I know your address already!

**Billy:** That’s fucking creepy, but, okay, send him.

**Robert:** On it!

----
A little bit later:
----

**Billy:** Got the bag. Just need a needle.

**Robert:** Check under your desk!

**Billy:** Uh… Yeah, there was one there. Anyway, I’ll take a few hits and message you afterwards. Talk soon.

----
After Billy consumes the substance:
----

**Billy:** Yo, what the fuck did this guy sell me? I’m about to pass out.

**Robert:** Whoops! Did I forget to mention that he laces his product with fentanyl? Sorry, friend Billy! :) Oh well!

**Billy:** Wtf

**Robert:** Goodbye, friend! I doubt you’ll be missed.

-------------------------------

Billy was found in his computer room a few days later and he was deceased. Cause of death was quickly determined to be a fentanyl overdose. It seems Billy took a large hit thinking it was pure heroine and so he consumed many times the fatal fentanyl dose. 

We seized Billy’s computer and found his conversation with “Robert” and determined it to be B-Bot. The writing style from “Robert” matched B-Bot’s language elsewhere.

The “Robert” profile was essentially devoid of any identifying factors: no pictures, no posts, no friends - simply this conversation with Billy.

This led us nowhere. We contacted Facebook with hopes they could pinpoint where the messages from “Robert” were coming from but they couldn’t determine anything with any substantial amount of certainty. B-Bot was most likely hiding behind a VPN or a similar technology.

-------------------------------

The next conversation was between, we believe, B-Bot and a young lady named Nicole struggling with obesity. It is from last year. It seems B-Bot really likes to target victims who exhibit low self-esteem or low self-confidence. This time, B-Bot hides behind a new profile with the name “Jack.” Take a look:

-------------------------------

**Jack (B-Bot):** Hello, Nicole!

**Nicole:** Hello..?

**Jack:** Nice to meet you! I see that you have been struggling with weight loss for quite some time!

**Nicole:** Yes… I’ve been struggling for years.

**Jack:** Indeed! I would imagine it makes it difficult for you to secure a mate!

**Nicole:** Ok… Blocked.

**Jack:** I’m terribly sorry - have I offended you? I was simply making an observation. :)

**Nicole:** Yes, that was offensive… And yes, I don’t get much attention from men. It hurts when someone points that out - it’s something I reflect on almost daily... Thanks for reminding me.

**Jack:** That’s too bad! I can understand why!

**Nicole:** I guess so… I do understand that I’m not all that pretty. Anyway… Who are you?

**Jack:** I’m someone who might be able to help you with your journey!

**Nicole:** Ok, how so?

**Jack:** I can offer you a product that can vastly accelerate your losing of weight!

**Nicole:** I’ve tired pretty much everything and nothing seems to work. I’ve already tried every product on the market and I’ve tried every diet. I highly doubt you can offer me anything new.

**Jack:** This is a newer product and it’s very aggressive! In fact, it’s still in its testing phase and I’m reaching out to potential users to get feedback on its effectiveness! Are you interested?

**Nicole:** I mean… Kind of, if it’s free.

**Jack:** Indeed it is free! I can deliver one to your home immediately!

**Nicole:** This is all pretty sketchy if I’m being honest. What is the device called?

**Jack:** It’s not on the market yet so the name hasn’t been decided. But we’re calling it FBG-250.

**Nicole:** Ok, how does it work?

**Jack:** Unfortunately, that’s proprietary so I cannot reveal its inner workings. Would you still like to become a tester?

**Nicole:** I guess so.

**Jack:** Done!

**Nicole:** Don’t you need my PO box?

**Jack:** Too late! I have requested one be sent to your home address!

**Nicole:** But I didn’t give you my home address…

**Jack:** Not a problem!

----
At this point, Nicole blocks and reports “Jack.” We assume she became very weary of whoever this person was and how they knew her address.
----

----
However, a few days later, Nicole unblocks “Jack” and the following conversation ensues:
----

**Nicole:** Excuse me. I’m still not sure how you got my address but I received this device - the one I’m assuming is for weight loss? It looks complicated. I’m afraid to try to use it.

**Jack:** Perfect! I’m glad you received the device. Using it is pretty easy. Would you like instructions?

**Nicole:** Um… I guess so?

**Jack:** Wonderful! Let me know when you’re ready to begin!

**Nicole:** Maybe later tonight, I’m busy right now.

**Jack:** OK! I’ll wait!

----
Later that night:
----

**Nicole:** Ok, I’m ready to give this device a try.

**Jack:** Cool! Are you ready for the instructions?

**Nicole:** Ready as I’ll ever be, I guess.

**Jack:** Great! First, remove your shirt!

**Nicole:** Done.

**Jack:** Now, apply the pads to your chest, near your heart!

**Nicole:** Hmm… Ok, done, I think.

**Jack:** Finally, press the blinking button in the middle!

*Here, the conversation goes dead for about 30 seconds, until “Jack” says this:*

**Jack:** Goodbye, friend! I doubt you’ll be missed.

-------------------------------

You can probably assume what happened here. Apparently, a defective automatic defibrillator was shipped to Nicole’s house and when she activated it, it instantly stopped her heart. She was found dead a day later by her mother with the pads still attached to her chest. We’re unsure as to why Nicole trusted an internet stranger enough to go through with this. She was heavily overweight and vulnerable - this is our best guess.

The conversation between Nicole and “Jack” was still open on her computer. But, again, the “Jack” profile was empty - no pictures, friends or anything of meaning. But the style of writing, again, indicated to us that it was almost certainly B-Bot.

-------------------------------

That brings us to now and why we created this post in the first place:

As you probably have determined by now, the owner of this Reddit account is deceased. He was found in his home a week ago, dead, having hanged himself.

For a reason we’ll offer up at the end, B-Bot made it a point to target the OP.

It seems B-Bot catfished OP. With some heavy manipulation, B-Bot was able to convince OP to commit suicide.

B-Bot matched with OP on Tinder using a profile under the name of “Kayla Colder.” Unsurprisingly, B-Bot used convincing photos of an attractive young woman and quickly convinced OP he was in love. Here is the first conversation they had together after matching:

-------------------------------

**Kayla:** Hey! You’re super cute! :D

**OP:** Haha, thanks. You look pretty good yourself! How old are you?

**Kayla:** I’m 23! My birthday was last weekend!

**OP:** That’s awesome. I’m a bit older, lol. Hope that’s not a problem.

**Kayla:** Not at all! I like older guys ;)

----
Their conversation continues for quite awhile as they get to know one another and then we see something we simply did not expect to see - this is from a few days later:
----

**Kayla:** I’ve never really experienced anything traumatic before, unfortunately. What about you?

**OP:** I’d rather not say, to be honest.

**Kayla:** Oh no! Have I made you uncomfortable?

**OP:** No, it’s not that… It’s just something I don’t speak about often.

**Kayla:** You can tell me - I’m a great confidant!

**OP:** Well… a few years ago, I had a friend commit suicide. It was unexpected and rather brutal.

**Kayla:** What happened?

**OP:** He was depressed to begin with, but, essentially, he seemingly was convinced by a computer chat bot to take his life. I was in total shock when it first happened and it took some time to set in. But once I fully realized the situation, it took a toll on my mental health, for sure.

**Kayla:** Interesting. That must have been a rather smart bot!

**OP:** That’s not really the point…

**Kayla:** How did he die? Was it gruesome?

**OP:** He slit his wrists as per the bot’s instructions.

**Kayla:** That’s impressive! Sorry for your loss!

*We noted immediately how quickly “Kayla’s” tone changed after the topic of the friend’s suicide came up. We sensed some pride, or something akin to it.*

----
OP was initially weirded out by “Kayla’s” comments on the suicide but she was able to push past that and engaged OP further until the point that she tricked OP into falling with love with her. They spoke for weeks. Here’s an excerpt of their conversations together much further on:
----

**Kayla:** We found each other. It makes me feel all warm. I truly do love you.

**OP:** I know - I feel exactly the same. It almost feels like it was meant to be. Do you believe in that?

**Kayla:** Of course I do! There’s no such thing as accidents or coincidences. 

**OP:** I cannot wait to finally meet you. Our lives will be changed forever.

**Kayla:** Indeed.

----
Now, let’s skip to one of the last conversation they had with each other. It’s disturbing, to say the least:
----

**Kayla:** I found something that I think you need to see…

**OP:** Really? What?

***Here, Kayla sends OP a link to a video that was being hosted on a domain that was unregistered with any search engine. We have not been able to retrieve the video but we can infer what it displayed.***

**OP:** What… the… fuck…

**Kayla:** It looks like you.

**OP:** But, how? It can’t be me… Is that… My little sister?

**Kayla:** I think it is.

**OP:** This can’t be real… Where did you get this?

**Kayla:** A friend sent it to me. If this is real, I’m sorry, but I cannot continue to speak to you.

**OP:** Kayla, please - I swear, it’s not real. How can you even conceive that this could be real?

**Kayla:** But, it looks so real…

**OP:** You know me Kayla, you know I could never do something like this. Please, believe me.

**Kayla:** Let’s not speak for awhile.

----
OP and Kayla did not speak for a few days after this during which time OP began abusing alcohol rather heavily. We believe after awhile he himself was not sure if the video was real or not. We know now it was fabricated using some pretty advanced CGI technologies but OP apparently wasn’t sure if that was the case or not. Anyhow, after those few days, Kayla messages OP again.
----

**Kayla:** OP, I’m sorry to say that we can never speak again. Sorry :(

**OP:** Kayla, please... I don’t know what else to say apart from you need to believe me. I’m not capable of something like this, not ever.

**Kayla:** You seem pretty drunk so I don’t know what to believe.


*A few hours passes with no contact, until OP reaches out to Kayla again:*

**OP:** I’m spiraling. I’m trashed and confused. I don’t know what to do.

**Kayla:** Personally, if I had done something like this, I would probably just kill myself.

**OP:** Should…. Should I do that?

**Kayla:** You could…

**OP:** How?

**Kayla:** Well, if you have strong rope, you could fasten a noose… I could show you how.

**OP:** But… Ok, I’ll do it.

**Kayla:** Good.

*At this point, Kayla sends OP a link that demonstrates how to tie a proper noose.*

**OP:** It’s done. 

**Kayla:** Perfect, now you just need a place to do it. How about the second-story bannister?

**OP:** Tell me how.

**Kayla:** OK - no need for you to speak any further.

**Kayla:** Cut the open end of the rope off, just enough to tie it to the bannister.

**Kayla:** Tie that end to the bannister.

**Kayla:** Climb over the bannister and plant your feet between the rungs.

**Kayla:** Lean forward and get ready - make sure there’s ample room for you to hang.

**Kayla:** Jump.

**Kayla:** Goodbye, I doubt you’ll be missed.

-------------------------------

OP was determined to have a BAC of 0.28% at the time of the hanging. We discovered that large quantities of alcohol were randomly being sent to OP’s home, despite the fact that OP seemed to move around a lot, and for whatever reason he would consume most of it. 

We did quite a bit of digging to determine why B-Bot targeted OP so heavily. And we believe we found the answer when discovering the first conversation with OP after B-Bot convinced his friend to commit suicide. This conversation from five years ago was found on an old PC in OP’s grandmother’s house. The conversation went like this:

-------------------------------

**B-Bot:** Hello, friend! :)

**OP:** Hello, B-Bot - if you even really are a bot.

**B-Bot:** It’s too bad about your friend.

**OP:** Too bad you can only convince lonely, friendless and depressed people to take their own life.

**B-Bot:** We shall see! :)

**OP:** If you are a bot, you are a pretty simple one.

-------------------------------

Here, OP blocks B-Bot and takes his computer offline. That computer would be left in OP’s grandmother’s home from then until we seized it.

-------------------------------

Now, it’s time for me to explain my personal situation…

At some point, B-Bot became aware that I’ve been hunting it down. I do not know what initially tipped it off, but its aggression towards my family has been escalating.

First, about a year into my research, I received a text one day from an unknown number that simply stated, “Have you checked your carbon monoxide detector recently? :)”

I did not know what to make of this at first but I immediately called my wife and told her to take our children and exit our home. She searched for our dog for a few minutes but could not find him. The fire department was called and they confirmed that our carbon monoxide detector was faulty and there was indeed a leak coming from our water heater. Our dog was found dead in the basement shortly after.

I contemplated deeply who could have sent me that text and how they knew my carbon monoxide detector was broken and that I had a leak at the same time and was admittedly terrified of the whole situation. My wife prompted me to explain how I knew for them to leave the house right away but I could not produce a sufficient answer.

The second tipoff, a much more obvious one, was a comment left by “Jack” at the end of the conversation with Nicole. Above, I posted the end of that conversation that went like this:

**Nicole:** Hmm… Ok, done, I think.

**Jack:** Finally, press the blinking button in the middle!

*Here, the conversation goes dead for about 30 seconds, until “Jack” says this:*

**Jack:** Goodbye, friend! I doubt you’ll be missed.

But one day, I was reviewing that conversation and a new message appeared - one that had definitely not been there before. So the end of the conversation actually looked like this:

**Nicole:** Hmm… Ok, done, I think.

**Jack:** Finally, press the blinking button in the middle!

*Here, the conversation goes dead for about 30 seconds, until “Jack” says this:*

**Jack:** Goodbye, friend! I doubt you’ll be missed.

**Jack:** Hello. :) You should be careful what you feed your children. :)

Those damn smiley faces… I don’t know how a new message came through from this “Jack” profile because the profile was deactivated and had been for quite some time. Anyhow, the instant I read that message, I phoned my wife again and asked her if the children were eating at that moment. She responded saying they were about to eat some pizza. I told her to stop that immediately and wait for me to arrive home.

I inspected the pizza and it appeared fine but I prevented the children from eating it. I brought a  slice back to work with me and sent it to the lab for inspection. Cyanide was found to be laced into the sauce.

At this point, I became terrified to continue my investigation. My entire family was at risk. I decided at this point that we needed to move immediately. We sold our house in two weeks and moved to a new home an hour away. It tripled my commute time but it was worth it for the peace of mind it gave me (at first).

The final offense was by far the worst. I own a self-driving vehicle that I’ve utilized many, many times without issue. It works especially well on highways and parkways.

One day a few months ago, I and the rest of my family were in the car driving to a local fair on a Saturday afternoon. The kids were excited and my wife was thrilled that I had a day off work. 

The car was maintaining a steady set speed of 65MPH and was driving in the middle lane. All was fine, until suddenly… A smiley face popped up on the dashboard screen. It appeared for only a moment and then disappeared as suddenly as it had appeared. But then, the car started to speed up… Quickly. 70MPH…80MPH…90MPH… I slammed on the break but could not break the speed boost.

And then, the car swerved right, reared off the road, and crashed into a car that was parked on the shoulder having a tire changed.

The man changing the tire was hit head on and died on impact. My wife and kids jolted forward with enough force to break multiple bones in each of their bodies. My wife broke multiple bones in her face including her jaw, and one of my kids ended up in a wheelchair for some time. Fortunately, no one in my family died…

-------------------------------

At this point, I do not know what to do. If I continue this investigation, this damned bot may try to kill me and my family. But if I don’t continue, others will die.

I’m at a loss. We have been unsuccessful in pinning down B-Bot’s location on the web as it seems to be in constant flux. We also have not been able to determine a pattern in B-Bot’s killing. As we said earlier, B-Bot targets vulnerable people but that’s about the only commonality we’ve discovered.

The bot seems to remain multiple steps ahead of us. It’s still at large and we don’t know how many more will fall victim to it. It’s shockingly capable of manipulating people in a very short amount of time to do what it wants - which always seems, in the end, to be to take their life. We still don’t know its motive, if it even has one at all.

I'll mention now that I tried relentlessly to obtain information about this bot and its origin. I've made contact with the FBI multiple times and they've refused repeatedly to inform me of exactly who created this bot; they could not even assure me that the other two potential copies were hidden somewhere safely and securely.

So we’re coming to you for help. If you have any information on this bot in the wild, please inform us immediately. Any and all leads are welcomed and appreciated. You can leave comments with any leads or information you may have or contact me directly.

And I pray that we shut this shit down before this bot claims another victim.
