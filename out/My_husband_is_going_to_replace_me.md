Our 15th wedding anniversary is next week, Jack and I’s, and I think he will be celebrating with someone else. No, not someone, *something.* 

We met in our senior year of college and married just a year later. It was the perfect love story. Another year after that we bought our first house and nine months later came our oldest daughter. A couple years later, the twins came. The past 10 years it has been the five of us living what I thought was an idyllic, picture perfect life. I stayed home with the children, putting my all into raising them. I gave everything, I’m still giving everything, for this family. My babies, they’re not to blame. My angels. They have no idea who their father really is. I didn’t even know until yesterday. And now I need help, urgently, while I still have a chance.

Anyways, yesterday Jack forgot his laptop on the table when he left for work. It was open, and it dinged with a notification. I don’t know why I looked, I’d never gone through his things before, but some little voice in my head told me I needed to this time. It was an email notification from a “DW Corp” with a “Payment Confirmation” subject line. 

We shared a bank account and I would have seen any recent transactions, but this did not sound familiar. 

I sat down and opened it. It only said “Payment of $30,000 received. Your order has been shipped.”

I had a million questions, namely where could he have gotten that much money. The most upsetting thing, however, was that he had kept this from me. Whatever it was, he hid it. We never lied to each other, we were open and trusting. I wanted to vomit. I didn’t let myself though, I stayed in that chair going through every email, every file, every text. I scoured that computer until there was nothing left untouched. What I found disturbed me, frightened me. 

Basically, the thirty grand is just the down payment. For what? For a robot. A lifelike, AI, “your perfect fantasy spouse”. Not only that, I was able to log into his account on the company’s website and there was a picture of me. I realized  it wasn’t me though, it just looked like me. He had designed this thing to look exactly like me. But why? Why make it exactly like me when he already had me? I knocked it onto the floor and it cracked, the screen went black. I apologized profusely when he got home but didn’t mention what I’d seen. He seemed annoyed and didn’t speak to me the rest of the night. Or the next morning. Today.

He left early this morning, I have no idea where he’s gone. An hour ago a delivery van pulled into our driveway though and asked for Jack, they had a package for him. I offered to sign but no, no it had to be delivered to the person named on their sheet. They would come back later. Maybe I’m being too paranoid, maybe it’s nothing. Maybe it’s an elaborate prank. Maybe he’s going to murder me and replace me with the perfect version of myself. I don’t know what to do but sit here and wait like usual for Jack to return home. I hope this is all settled before my babies are home from school. Just in case. And I hope I’m here to greet them when they do get home. If it’s not me, I hope they would be able to tell.
