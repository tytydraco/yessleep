This story is about an innocent mistake that most people make. The names are all different but the details are the same. I know not everyone has the time to read it to the end. That’s fine. The key takeaway is simple. Never, ever let a stranger borrow your phone to take a picture. Just don’t fucking do it. Please. You’ll soon see why. 

My little family of four woke up early one morning to go to the beach. My daughter and I had this running bet. Every time she slept in her own bed, she got a surprise, you know, a reward for being good. The first night it was ice cream, then a donut, then a toy. I was running out of incentives because she kept fulfilling her end of the deal. So being that it was the weekend, and the weather was nice, I thought it would be cool to get some sun in before the tourists arrived for the holiday.

Our plan worked like a charm. We got to the sand and pitched a tent in a quiet spot away from commotion. The waves lapped aimlessly against the shore. The water was crystal clear. Sofia built sand castles with pink plastic buckets and Joey gave the seagulls his best t-rex impression. The memory of Emma stretched out in a two-piece is burned so hot it’s like it’s branded. I loved those trips if for nothing else than to stare beneath the cover of my long sleeve SPF-shit swim shirt. I felt about as lucky as any other man in the world. Life was good. 

We stayed there a little while. I thumbed through a book. Em scanned her phone. The kids joined forces to build a moat which kept (some of) the tide away. Eventually, foot traffic picked up along with the opening of a couple shops on the boardwalk. We got ready to leave. I knelt down go corral the toys when an unfamiliar voice called out - 

“You have a beautiful family,” he exclaimed. “Truly. So blessed.”

I turned around to find my wife facing a stranger. 

“Oh. Thank you!” She chirped back. “Yes… I think so too.”

We sat there a bit in awkward silence. He smiled. We smiled. He was older, maybe in his sixties or seventies. He wore black slacks and a white shirt, with one of those odd gray golf gaps that perched like a beret. He seemed ordinary enough. Friendly and all that jazz. He just wouldn’t go away. 

“Oh. You should take a picture. You’ll want to remember this gorgeous day,” he quipped. “Family memories are so important. I keep albums for all my grandchildren.”

Emma’s ears perked at the suggestion. 

“Oh yeah, you know Matt, we really haven’t had a good one in ages.”

I hung my head in solemn agreement. 

“Guess you’re right.”

She groaned.

“My cell’s dead. Can you use yours?”

I rummaged through my bag and handed it over. The man quickly gave it back.

“Locked.”

I entered the code.

“Okay!” the stranger cheered. “Kids, smile like you mean it! Parents, too! Happy days! Say… tangerine!”

We laughed.

“Tangerine!”

And that was it. The entire encounter lasted about five minutes. The stranger delivered my phone and shook my hand. I thanked him. I threw it in my bag, gathered our stuff, and got the kids ready. We jetted to the car and beat the worst of the traffic back home. The rest of the day flew by with usual activities. Gymnastics and lunch with grandparents and birthday parties. One moment faded into the next and the topic of the odd stranger got lost.

The photo, however, came up again around dinner time. 

Emma needed head-shots for work and remembered to remind me (hah) to send her the beach shot. I pulled out my cell and went through my messages. I couldn't find it at first. That's when I found something unfamiliar. There was one sent text to an unknown number from that same morning.

"Hey, hon.."

I pulled up the conversation history. A picture loaded. The four of us cheesed back at the camera from the shade of our umbrella. Luke had a bucket on his head. Sofia put two fingers behind her mom. I scanned through my other texts and there was nothing else out of the ordinary. But it was still, you know, weird. 

My first reaction was to call the number. I dialed once and got a busy signal. I hung up and dialed again. Error message. I dialed a third time, got up, and started to pace. 

“What?” Emma asked. “You alright?”

I knew she wouldn’t take it seriously. It was quite a leap at that point.

“This is going to sound weird.”

“What?”

“I think this guy texted himself a picture of us.”

She stared at me for a second. I stared back. Then she laughed. 

“Dude,” she gasped. “Why? Why would anyone do that? We are not that interesting.” 

I called the number again. This time it didn’t stop ringing.

“I know I sound paranoid. But, really. Look. I didn't send this text message and it's on my phone. The number is legit, like, it’s got our area code and everything.”

Emma rolled her eyes.

“Maybe he did it by accident,” she sighed. “He was old. He probably doesn’t know how to text.”

I wanted to press the topic. I hated the idea that someone could have access to my phone. I think anyone would. But it was late, and she was skeptical, and we only had minutes to talk before someone wanted a bottle or a juice or a snack or an episode of their favorite show. I pushed it to ‘Matt's future queue’ and fell back into routine. 

The storm brought both kids into our bed sometime around midnight. I woke up to find my daughter climbing over my already snoring son. Sofia snuggled up beside me as rain pattered against the windowsill. I couldn’t say no. The kid had cuteness on her side and she hated bad weather. At least I wouldn’t need another surprise. I held her tight, and just as sleep seemed like it might be a possibility, the doorbell rang. 

My heart skipped a beat. 

We live pretty deep in the woods. Our nearest neighbor is about a mile away. My house isn't exactly the type of place you might expect a late night visitor. Sofia stared at me wide-eyed in the dark. My wife didn't stir. We waited in silence. The bell rang again. 

I got up out of bed and looked for something clean to wear. I found a shirt on the floor and some socks in the hamper. I gave the baseball bat behind the dresser a good long look before deciding against it. Sof whined nervously.

“Stay here.”

I could tell that she was scared. I guess that sort of put me into super-parent mode. Dad the hero. Dad the protector. A whole lot of ego and not much else to back it up. I grabbed the bat on the way out and whispered back.

“I’ll be okay. Stay with Mama.”

The hallway outside our bedroom led to a staircase in front of the door. The bell rang again. I picked up my pace and hurdled down the steps as our visitor found the brass lion knocker attached to the frame.

**Bam. Bam. Bam.**

I took a breath and looked through the peephole. 

The woman on my porch looked to be about twenty to twenty-five years old. She was blonde and pretty with hoop earrings and smeared makeup. I looked at her for a little while longer before doing anything. There was something about her eyes. She looked confused, or high, or something. So I kept the door closed.

“Can I help you?”

She knocked again. Then again. And again and again until the door shook and blonde hair thrashed back and forth across her face.

“Hello?” I shouted. “Hey! Can you stop?”

The knocking ceased.

“Oh. Hi.”

“Hello.”

“Can I help you?” 

She paused. She smiled.

“Yes. I want to take a picture of you.”

My lungs deflated.

“What the fuck? No.”

She smiled. 

“Please?”

“What are you talking about?” I snapped. “It’s the middle of the night. What are you doing here?”

She frowned.

“You let HIM take a picture.”

I didn’t answer. She rang the bell again. My blood pressure jumped.

“I’m going to need you to get the fuck off my property. Now. I’m calling the cops.”

She smiled. She stared at the little hole in the door for a full minute or two. Then she walked away silently. 

As if nothing had ever happened. 

The moment shook me. It took a while for the adrenaline to wear off. I thought about calling the police. I wondered what the hell to even tell them. I locked the doors and searched the rest of the house. I calmed down a little bit when it was empty. I went back upstairs to check on my family. Emma was stretched out with one arm around each kid. Thunder rumbled through the windows. They slept through the whole thing.

I pulled my phone from the charger. I wanted to message a friend for advice. That's when I noticed a new text. Just one. A picture of me standing in my boxers.

Someone was watching through the back window. 

“See you soon,” it said.
