[Part Three](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ik6haa/comment/mbqqpw0/)

Liam is already asleep by the time I settle in to keep watch. I don’t know how he managed it so quickly—my mind is too wired, too full of everything that just happened. The Employee Lounge. The training video. Low Stock.

I shift against the cold tile, hugging my knees to my chest. It’s only been one night. That should be a relief, but it isn’t. It feels longer. Feels like we’ve been down here forever.

I glance at Liam, curled on his side a few feet away. His face twitches slightly in his sleep, but otherwise, he’s still. The exhaustion must’ve hit him hard.

I don’t know much about him. Just that he used to be a Wiresmith back in Scrapper territory—one of the few kids who knew how to reroute the Store’s broken security panels, repurpose old hardware, wire traps. People who knew how to make things work.

And for the first time since getting here, I feel a little less alone.

I exhale, forcing my shoulders to relax. I should be greatful. Most people don’t get a second chance. If Liam hadn’t pulled me away, if I had stared at that screen a moment longer—

I shudder. I don’t want to think about it.

Instead, I focus on the hallway.

It’s too quiet. The air feels thick, like it’s waiting for something.

I don’t know how long I sit there, listening to the silence, before I hear it.

A noise.

Distant. Faint. Metallic.

I freeze, breath catching in my throat. I don’t move. I just listen.

It’s coming from behind the walls.

Not footsteps. Not voices. Something else. A mechanical shift. The low groan of metal flexing, sliding. It doesn’t sound like the shelves when they move—it’s smoother. Like something adjusting itself.

Like something inside the walls.

My stomach twists.

I don’t wake Liam. Not yet. Not when I can’t be sure of what I heard. Maybe it was just the vents. Maybe it was nothing.

But I don’t sleep.

Not after that.

I woke up a few hours ago to Korynn shaking my shoulder, whispering that it was my turn to keep watch. She didn’t say much else, just rubbed at her arms and mumbled something about needing to sleep. I wonder when’s the last time she slept. 

Now she’s passed out next to me, and I guess it’s my turn to stare at these boring-ass walls and try not to think about how we’re still here.

I should introduce myself, huh?

I don’t know how much Korynn has told you. Probably not much. We barely know each other.

I’m Liam.  I’m what my faction has decided to call a  Wiresmith. I know how to rework power lines, hotwire security panels, bypass old system locks. That’s how I ended up here—I got too curious, started picking at something I shouldn’t have. Then I vanished.

That was three days ago? Maybe…

You know what’s the worst part?

I’ve seen kids come through here. Seen them sit in that room, eyes locked on that screen. Seen them turn. And I couldn’t do anything.

Not until Korynn.

And now we’re both stuck here.

Great.

I sigh, running a hand through my hair. I don’t know what the hell we’re supposed to do. We can’t go back. We can’t go forward.

I glance over at Korynn, still fast asleep.

She’s been posting here, right? Asking for help?

I guess it’s worth a shot.

Liam woke me up a few minutes ago. I woke up feeling like I barely slept at all. My body aches. My head is heavy. But at least nothing… happened.

Liam is sitting against the wall, arms folded, staring at the ceiling. He glances at me when I shift. “Morning.”

I snort. “If you can call it that.”

There’s no morning here. No sun. No way to track time, except by how exhausted we feel.

“We need a way out,” I mutter, rubbing my eyes.

Liam hums in agreement. “Got any ideas?”

I hesitate.

“Actually… someone mentioned something in the comments.” I sit up, my pulse kicking up slightly. “They said to look for a vent.”

Liam’s eyebrows lift. “A vent?”

I nod. “The Store has an air system, right? If we can find an access point, we might be able to get out of here.”

Liam considers this, his lips pressing together. “Yeah,” he says slowly. “Yeah, that makes sense.”

We exchange a glance.

This might be our only chance.

If anyone knows anything about the Store’s ventilation system—please, tell us.

This hallway is a dead end. If there’s a way out, we need to find it fast.

We’ll update when we can. Also, before I go... I am seeing your comments, I just for some reason can't respond to them, I will try to respond to them in a post later. Fort now, keep monitoring that website - i think it could give us some answers.
