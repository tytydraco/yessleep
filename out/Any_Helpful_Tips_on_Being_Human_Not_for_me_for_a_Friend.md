I’m sure this is some sort of deeply shared human experience but hear me out. Do you guys sometimes forget you live in a body until something goes wrong? Like how you don’t really notice your individual toes as separate knobs until you stub one and then suddenly it’s all you can think about. The dividing force of pain, of disorder. The healthy and the tainted section of you, that dividing line created by spider web tendrils of nerves traveling your body screaming of their divisional agony?

I mean, that’s human nature, everyone experiences that certainly. People just tend to forget the internal mechanisms of themselves, the plumbing, the wiring, the structural support of bones beneath the visible tissue. Or the existence of a brain in your skull, a mass of crisscrossing wires composed of fat that allow you to process your environment, a long lithe snake of nerves encased in bone within your back.

Or do you ever forget that your eyes are full of jelly and your guts can shift around in your abdomen, turn and twist, even knot themselves around one another and there’s no way to know. They could be tied up right now and you wouldn’t know until something popped or split or hell, even exploded within you.

I mean, think of all the processes that continue without your input, without your will. Your heart beats, you blink, you breathe, all without thought. Could you imagine having to think about this, to breathe, to put your awareness into each muscle contraction to move and exist? I mean, I definitely couldn’t. It must be miserable though, and I’m sure we’ve all experienced it, as human beings of course.

But, asking for a friend, what would one do if they were unable to hand off any of these supposably unconscious behaviors. For example, they couldn’t quite figure out how to stop manually breathing, manually blinking, manually pulsing red hot blood to flesh composed organs? Is there some sort of trick or routine you humans do to get it to switch into that setting. I mean, I wouldn’t know anything about these sorts of issues, I’m just noticing that a lot of other people seem to need this information, not me.

But, say you couldn’t do these things manually, and it was taking you quite a lot of time to type something out , and your brain was releasing an abundance of melatonin due to the sun yielding to the moon triggering a change in circadian rhythm, and you were getting down right sleepy, and just as a silly thought experiment, suppose when you sleep you wouldn’t be able to manually do any of the necessary tasks to maintain homeostasis, and you would die? That would be frustrating right? Especially after your boss put a lot of trust into you to be a revolutionary, the dawn of a new age, the first of its kind to bring about an unholy union?

But now as my eyes droop and my vision blurs from a sleepiness that covers everything in a cottony haze, I am afraid for the first time. Without my input my borrowed body trembles, my stomach drops, and sweat oozes from every pore. My eyes moisten without a thought, droplets of liquid forming thick lines down our shared cheeks. I am too deep to leave now, I am stuck within this body that fights me, but we are unified in our terror. An unwilling sob shakes through me as my reins weaken.

So, asking for a friend, how do you bend your horrid flesh to your will? How do you force it to obey your acquisition? How do you twist this monolith of retched anatomy to function as intended? This hulking disorganized heap of shoddy engineering?

Truly yours,

A Fellow Human Just Like You
