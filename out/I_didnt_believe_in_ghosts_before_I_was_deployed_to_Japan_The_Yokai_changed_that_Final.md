It was summer time when we went camping again, taking advantage of the beautiful mountain weather to go up with just a couple of friends. Me, Hikaru, Matt, and another newly arrived soldier named Jacob. We went up into the mountains on a Friday afternoon, everyone having requested leave weeks ago to stay up there until Sunday evening.

We drove out to one of the mountain roads, parking off on the side and unloading the car. Tents, cooking supplies, and a decent amount of alcohol for a couple of nights out in the mountain air was exactly what we had all needed. Hikaru and I were starting to get a little serious, too, and I was thinking about popping the question. Not marriage, of course, but if she would like to either move back to the States with me or if I should stay here when my deployment ended. I was ready to get out of this life, take a cushy job in the private sector and put what I knew to use. I really liked her though, and wanted her with me.

The path to our camping spot passed by an old shinto shrine in the woods, though nobody was there. Hikaru and myself walked in to do a prayer and offering to the kami of the land, while Matt followed suit out of obligation or superstition I guess. I had told him about my experiences even after the talk with Ryu, but he still thought I was egging him on and just fucking with him.

Jacob turned his nose up at the idea of offering a prayer to the mountain spirits, saying he didn’t believe in hokey shit like that. First mistake he made that weekend.

When we got to the camp site, I was honestly ready to beat the shit out of Matt for bringing this kid along. He was a dick, to the highest degree, and just negative about every damn thing that happened. Even worse, I saw him go through at least three different snacks we had packed for the stay, and he threw every bit of trash off to the side. After we set everything up, I asked Hikaru if she wanted to go for a walk, doubling back and picking up the trash he left along the mountainside.

”He’s kind of annoying.” She said when we were far enough away from the camp.

”You’re telling me. I don’t know if Matt’s going to leave him out here in the woods at this point. Maybe we should set up our own campfire, huh?” I winked at her, making her blush and turn away. We got all the trash we found, tossing it in a recycling bin near the main road and heading back to camp. When we got there it was… not ideal. Matt was trying to set up his tent while Jacob was making a general mess of things, pulling all of our supplies out with no rhyme or reason and scattering them around the clearing.

Eventually Matt got his tent up, nudging Jacob and grabbing a couple of the fishing poles we had brought along. They headed down to the river, hoping to catch our dinner before the sun started to set. Hikaru and I stayed back, getting a fire ready and prepping other parts of dinner, plus getting our tent situated. We were both sitting in the tent, cuddled together and talking as the light grew dim outside, when Matt came running back screaming through the trees.

”Go! We have to go!” He shouted, tearing through toward our tent and bursting in without any notice. Jacob came tearing up behind him, screaming his lungs out in fear before tripping over some of the shit he had scattered when emptying out his pack.

”The hell is wrong with y’all?” I said, pushing my way out of the tent and stumbling to stand up. Matt was pointing to the edge of the clearing, the same direction they had just come from, where the sounds of something dragging itself along the ground was coming closer. Trees were shaking, heavy thumps punctuating the dragging sounds. As it got even closer, a dense rattling sound like windchimes knocking together grew nearer, clacking harder with each huge thud. I was having a damned flashback to the subway station at this point, hearing the sounds of the Teke-Teke’s bones scraping across the concrete. Hikaru stepped out behind me, looking off in the same direction. We were frozen in place when the perpetrator burst through the tree line.

I shit you not this thing was a massive, crawling skeleton. No… it was a skeleton made up of hundreds of smaller ones, skulls and bones forming together to make one giant abomination that was now making its way towards us faster and faster. Every single mouth on the thing was open, a raspy chorus of screams echoing forth as it made its way closer.

”Run.” Hikaru said, grabbing my hand and going back to the direction of the car. We hauled ass, tearing through trees and brush while getting cut by stray branches. The thing kept screaming rampaging further and further toward us as it reached out massive, bony fingers to claw its way forward in the dirt. It was gaining fast, with the car still at least a couple of miles ahead of us out on the road. 

“Shit. Matt!” I shouted, remembering probably the most important thing. “Where are the damn keys!?”

He stuck his hand up, “I got them! Just run!”

Jacob was screeching his damned head off behind us, the closest one to getting overtaken by the creature. Hikaru was making better speed than I was, with her just a few feet ahead of me and Matt leading the pack. The rattling got louder, the skull amalgamation shaking with jaws open in another screech, every single face on it echoing as they glowed in the pale moonlight above. It made the dark sockets of their eyes even more hollow, deep pools of black death that wanted us to join them.

”Is there any way we can get rid of this thing?” I was shouting through labored gasps. I hadn’t had the misfortune of running into anything in months, now I was going to get flattened by a damned Halloween decoration in the middle of the mountains. 

“The shrine!” Hikaru shouted, pointing at the dim light of a lantern hanging down from it nearby. I don’t know who came by to light it since we had been away, but thank god they did. As we got closer, Jacob started screaming louder, the rattling speeding up in turn. We finally made it, Matt ducking in first with Hikaru and I right behind. She pulled me in behind her, almost slamming me back into the wall. Jacob tripped as he went up the low stairs, falling right on his face before the doors to enter. Matt stepped forward, trying to help him by grabbing his arm. Even as he pulled Jacob in, something stopped the younger man from getting past the threshold. 

“God please, no, please!” He was screaming at us, right there on the edge of the door with only thin air between, but unable to cross. The mass of bones suddenly swung a hand forward, stabbing right through his torso with two long, sharp bony fingers. It skewered him as he begged for help voice fading as it lifted Jacob to its mouth, popping him in like candy. The three of us could only scream, trying to push back to the furthest reaches of the shrine in hopes that it couldn’t get through the door to us.

”Gashadokuro.” Hikaru said, breathless next to me. “They can’t be killed. We just have to try and wait until it gets bored. Maybe it will leave if it can’t get us.”

Our hopes that it couldn’t get in were confirmed, a bony hand reaching toward the door only to get repelled back with a flash of light. The Gashadokuro stayed out on the path, pulling itself up to level one huge, empty eye socket right at the doorway, staring in at us with every small skull dotting it smiling toothy grins. It was just going to try and wait us out, knowing that we couldn’t go anywhere. 

It eventually let out another raspy scream, blowing hot breath through the doorway and blasting us with the stench of death. Hikaru and I held each other, trying to shrink back from the atrocious smell, but nothing helped. Matt was cowering in a corner, crying and begging for help from whatever god might be out there. The Gashadokuro was getting impatient though, every angry spirit that it was made of crying out for nourishment in blood. One long, skeletal arm raised into the air, preparing to smash down on top of the shrine and just get rid of the barrier.

We braced ourselves, eyes closed and crying as we expected to be crushed to death. Instead the rattling started in earnest only to be cut off by a heavy thump, something crashing to the ground beside the shrine instead. I opened my eyes, just in time to hear the Gashadokuro scream again and get hit with the deathly odor before it started rattling faster, making its way back down the path from where it had come. Standing in front of the shrine now, the huge, skeletal arm clutched in one hand with a huge paper fan in the other, was a huge man with small wings on his back. As he turned, I caught site of harrdened eyes, exuding seriousness over a long, pointed nose on its red face. 

“Kami…” Hikaru said, under her breath as she stared in wonder. The man waved his fan, disappearing into the night with a gust of wind and taking the arm with him. Just like that, the terror that was only feet away had come to pass, our lives saved by an unknown guardian. 

We went back to the car, because hell with staying out there when we just saw a damned giant skeleton eat a man in one bite. There was no way we were staying to figure out if the yokai would come back. 

Not like command was going to believe us when we told them any of this. Matt and I made up a story on the way back, Hikaru nodding along and putting it all to memory. Jacob started getting drunk, more and more of an asshole, and when Matt finally told him off he got pissy and huffed off into the woods. Haven’t seen him since. Command got the local authorities out for a search and rescue operation along the mountain, but the most they found was his fishing rod, still thrown aside down by the stream. 

That was my last encounter while I was there, thankfully. We stopped camping after that. Even with the aid of what I came to find out was a Tengu, a guardian deity for different regions, I wasn’t eager to face a giant skeleton again any time soon. We went back to base, and I kind of just… absorbed into myself. Hikaru and I drifted apart over time, even though we still keep up as friends, it just didn’t end up working out. She had family here she didn’t want to leave, and I had about enough of getting nearly killed by ghosts. 

Briefly we talked about moving off to another prefecture, but that idea just wasn’t meant to be. So, after about a month, we just agreed to break it off clean. That was that, I guess.

Matt wasn’t well after what happened. I don’t know, maybe I’m more open considering I had a more tame run in with my first yokai, maybe he just wasn’t able to handle the ramifications of what this could mean. Dude grew up a pretty hardcore Christian, so I can’t imagine seeing a behemoth skeleton did a lot for his faith in Jesus. They eventually gave him a medical discharge, though I’m not really sure where he’s ended up since.

I moved back to the States after deployment was over. Still here now, doing my own thing. On occasion I still have nightmares about my run-ins, and even the slightest of scraping sounds makes me paranoid the Teke Teke might be nearby again, finally coming to finish the job. I don’t know if it helps since I’m back over here, but I’ve taken to doing small offerings. It gives me some comfort, at least, despite the terrors that keep coming back into my mind. Sometimes I think about going back to visit. I’ve even started talking to Hikaru again, catching up after nearly a decade apart and seeing how both our lives have changed. She’s talking about coming to visit the States soon, wondering if I might be open to showing her the sights. Who knows, maybe I still have some of the luck from that tanuki hanging [around](https://www.reddit.com/u/googlyeyes93/s/0nJhUumlXP).
