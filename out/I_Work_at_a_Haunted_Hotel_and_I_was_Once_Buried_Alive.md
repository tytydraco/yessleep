Don't get me wrong, I love my job, and now that I've been adopted by the owner so I could inherit the hotel, I couldn't be happier. But along with the awesome comes inevitable danger. 

This hotel is a sanctuary for spirits. Unlike common misconception, spirits are creatures born of pain and suffering, and they feed on fear. They’re also hunted by vipirits, who are creatures born of hate. With our setup, spirits live in safety and are free to scare our guests who’ve paid for a thrilling experience. It's a win-win-win situation for everyone.

During my work here, I've been attacked by a disgruntled [tenant](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/18011dv/i_work_at_a_haunted_hotel_and_its_more_dangerous/), held at gunpoint by [criminals](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/187lmda/i_work_at_a_haunted_hotel_and_the_tenants_saved/), and nearly killed by a [vipirit](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/18xqn01/i_work_at_a_haunted_hotel_and_a_spirit_risked_its/). After that vipirit attack, Mrs. Coriz, the owner and my new mother, began teaching me the ancient art of banishing them. With an engraved wooden stick in one hand and a mace-like object in the other, I mimicked her demonstration as I recited the words. Mrs. Coriz said I was doing well for a beginner but I would need to practice on an actual vipirit. I told her I never wanted to meet one ever again.

Unfortunately, my wish didn't come true.

One day, after my shift, I got into my car and began the weary drive home. Despite how great my job was, working from 7pm to 7am can drain you. And today was an especially busy day. I blasted the radio to keep myself awake, and I frowned at the strange lyrics of a familiar song. 

It turned out, those lyrics weren't the radio, or even a song. They were the words of my hijacker.

I only realized that after I felt something sharp press against the back of my neck. I froze, my breath static as my wide eyes watched a white vine slither forward and turn off the radio.

A vipirit.

My banishing weapons were in the trunk. 

I was going to die.

“Drive my directions,” it said.

“What d-do you want?”

“I will tell later. I don't going to hurt you.”

The sharp tip digging into my neck said the opposite, and my frantic mind whirred as I followed the vipirit's instructions. If it wanted to kill me, it would have done so already. It needed me for something, and I was pretty sure I knew what it was. Access to spirits.

Once we reached a deserted field of tall weeds, it said, “Stop. Get out.”

Eyeing my phone with desperation, I turned off the engine with a shaky hand and stepped outside, the sharp object still pressing into my skin as the vipirit slipped out after me. It pushed me against the car and brought its weapon forward. A fork. 

It could have held a feather against my neck and I'd have abided. These creatures were violent, unstable, and could lift my car with me in it and throw us into space if they wanted. I guess this one didn't want to draw attention.

“Why d-did you bring me here?” I asked, looking around nervously.

“To talk.”

“About what?”

“Safeness.”

I gulped. “S-Safeness?”

It lowered the fork. “I don't want eating spirits. Microwaves give more fill. D'autres comme moi come against me for that. I need safeness from them. Your hotel.”

“You … huh?” I was completely befuddled. “Microwaves?”

“Yes. Better fill. Deliciosa. I don't hunt again.”

“And *who* is against you for that?”

“Like me. They hunting me. Kripya. I need safeness in your hotel.”

“Other vipirits are after you?”

“Da.” It dropped the fork and its vines drooped in apology. “Scusami tanto for scaring. I do because I need you listening. Pakiusap, help me. I am scared.”

I frowned, skeptical. This wasn't a situation I'd have ever imagined. If only vipirits had discernible faces, I could make out an expression. Mrs. Coriz told me they were unpredictable, and this could very well be another ploy to gain access to the hotel and devour every spirit there.

Then again, if it did, the protection around the hotel would prohibit it from leaving. It would be stuck there until Mrs. Coriz discovered its massacre and banished it. Either this vipirit was stupid, or it was telling the truth.

Not wanting to make dangerous decisions, I managed a tight smile and said, “That's cool you found an alternative to spirits. I'm not the boss or anything, so, let me call Mrs. Coriz and let her know.”

It made a strange croak, reached into the car with one of its vines, and pulled my phone out. “Shì de! Call now!”

I nodded, trying to hide my discomfort as I waited for an answer. “Hello, Mrs. Coriz?”

“I'm busy, is there an emergency?”

“Yes. Um, I'm with a vipirit. It says it's being hunted by other vipirits because it feeds on microwaves instead of spirits and it needs sanctuary.”

“I see. Is it able to talk?”

She was as stoic as always and I couldn't make out her reaction. “Yes.”

“Put me on speaker.” I did, and she said, “I understand you need sanctuary.”

“Ndio, in your hotel,” the vipirit said, taking the phone from me.

“And I understand you feed on microwaves now. Does that mean you no longer hunt spirits?”

“Never anymore. Promising.”

“Very well. We are fully booked, but I have been working on an extension in the basement. If you are okay with an unfinished area, it's yours.”

I stared at the phone in shock, but the vipirit made a croaking sound again. “Shukran! I am very happy!”

“When will you drop by so I can adjust the shield?”

“Now!”

“Then have my employee drop you off at the back door.”

“No, I come alone.”

I looked at it, tensing up. “I c-can drop you off, it's not a problem.”

“No.”
 
Before I could say anything else, it reached between the long weeds and pulled out a ratty blanket, which it proceeded to wrap me up in within a second. I gasped in shock, which only gave it an opportunity to stuff cloth in my mouth.

I squirmed and screamed as it picked me up, and I doubled my frenzied efforts when I saw what else was hiding in the weeds. 

A grave.

My heart ran amok as I thrashed and pleaded, but the vipirit had no qualms about tossing me right inside. I looked at it with despair and betrayal, my panicked breaths wheezing as the dust made me cough. The only thing that scared me more than heights was getting buried alive.

“I come alone,” the vipirit said, hovering over me as it spoke on the phone. “If I safe, I tell where to finding employee.”

I shook my head frantically, mumbling, and my stomach dropped when I heard Mrs. Coriz say, “Very well.”

Very well? It was going to kill me!

“I understand you want to ensure your safety, and that is the hotel's priority,” Mrs. Coriz continued. “Just keep the phone with my employee so I know they are alive.”

That wasn't going to help me, my location wasn't shared and I couldn't speak!

“Okay,” it said, and I flinched as it tossed the phone at me. “I come now.”

With my panic reaching a crescendo, I released a flood of incoherent words at Mrs. Coriz. 

“Don't worry,” she said, “Once I have the vipirit settled I will come for you.”

In between my manic mumblings, I recoiled as the vipirit threw a slab of wood on top of me. It stopped an inch away from my nose as it rested on a ridge dug around the perimeter. A second later, the wood creaked under a heavy, dull thud. The outside sounds disappeared. My rioting pulse and stuttering breaths echoed within my chamber.  It was over. I was officially buried.

“Relax, take steady breaths,” Mrs. Coriz said. “You will be safe soon.”

I wheezed out a sob, trying my best not to go into a full-blown panic attack.

“Take steady breaths along with me,” she said, still stoic as ever.

“I am here,” a voice said from the distance on her side.

“Good. Hurry, come with me.”

The action on the other side of the line was a good distraction, and I closed my eyes and focused on their conversation.

“I have adjusted the shield on this back exit,” Mrs. Coriz said as a door squeaked. “Come inside.”

A door swung shut, and I could hear Mrs. Coriz chant under her breath. 

“Pardon?” the vipirit said.

“I was checking the shield’s durability. Alright, this is the basement area. I am planning on dividing it into extra rooms, but for now it is all yours. I apologize for the lack of light, but the window on the door does let in the sun. I will also arrange for a microwave to be installed.”

“Teşekkür ederim! You are very kind!”

“You are most welcome. And I must comment on your varied vocabulary. You must be well traveled.”

“Yes. One hundred years I go här och där. I learn little of all.”

“That is impressive. I'm sorry you won't be able to travel as much anymore.”

“I have safeness. That is important now.”

“I'm glad to hear it. Are you satisfied with this setup?

“Hai!”

“Wonderful. May I please know the location of my employee?”

I held my breath as I listened, and my heart dropped as it gave the wrong location.

I yelled and wheezed, my panic resurfacing. This vipirit was not only a liar, but also really stupid. I bet it wanted to send Mrs. Coriz on a wild goose chase while it ate all the spirits and ran away. Instead, it was now stuck in our hotel, and once Mrs. Coriz discovered its true colors, she was going to banish it. But what about me?

“Thank you,” Mrs. Coriz said. “I will leave you to rest. By the way, the shield protecting you from other vipirits will also inhibit you from leaving this basement.”

“What?” the vipirit asked, panic in its tone.

I paused my struggles, panting. It apparently was arrogant enough not to expect a fault in its plan.

“No, sæbr kon!” it cried out as a door slammed. “Let me out! I will tell truth of employee place!”

“I don't need your help.”

My wide eyes darted around the dark as I listened to the vipirit curse in various languages. Did Mrs. Coriz have a plan to rescue me?

“Are you above ground?” she asked me.

“Imm-imm,” I mumbled, sniffing.

“Are you in a bunker or a basement?”

“Imm-imm.”

“Buried?”

My voice cracked. “Imm-hmm.”

This was going to take forever. I was going to suffocate to death before she found me.

“Hyperventilating won't help us. Take steady breaths. Do you know where you are?”

“Imm-hmm.”

“East of here?”

“Imm-imm.”

“West?”

“Imm-hmm.”

“Did you drive for more than fifteen miles?”

"Imm-hmm."

After a few more questions to narrow down my location, Mrs. Coriz said, “I'm sending Wd. Layl to find you.”

My eyes widened and I mumbled in anxious disagreement. 

“i appreciate you caring more for the spirits than your own life, but I can't leave the hotel. Don't worry, she is big enough to handle a stray vipirit or two. I will stay on the phone with you.”

She began walking me through her routine, and I appreciated the distraction from my thudding heart, sweat-soaked clothes, and grim thoughts. I knew spirits traveled fast, but Wd. Layl had a lot of ground to cover, both vertically and horizontally.

Five minutes later, I heard, “There you are!”

I jumped and looked towards my feet, glimpsing three of Layl’s fifty eye stalks shining a pale silver. 

“It seems she has found you,” Mrs. Coriz said. “I will see you soon.”

Mrs. Coriz hung up, and I stayed still, my pulse racing with relief and anticipation. The wood creaked and bounced, and I took a deep, tearful breath as it was pulled away. Wd. Layl lifted me up and unraveled me, and I gagged as I yanked the cloth out of my mouth.

“Thank you,” I rasped, looking at her with gratitude as I wiped away my tears.

“I wish I could hug you, sweetie,” she said, frowning in concern as she towered over me. “Are you alright?”

“I'm okay now, just shaky.”

“Those vipirits are getting worse. We never wanted you or Mrs. Coriz to suffer.”

“We're okay, but you should get back to the hotel before a vipirit finds you.”

“Okay, I'll see you there, sweetie.”

She ducked back in the ground, and I walked to my car. Despite trembling like an autumn leaf, I managed to drive back to the hotel, where Mrs. Coriz greeted me with my first hug.

“I'm glad you are safe,” she said.

"From now on, I'm sharing my location," I said, leaning my head on her shoulder.

"That would be a wise start." She pulled me away from her hug. "You also need to practice banishing vipirits so that they stop targeting you. And now you have a vipirit to practice on.”

My eyes widened in realization and I smiled. “I do! Oh, this is perfect!”

She smiled back as she led me to the rear door to the basement, and I felt a delicious sense of satisfaction as I saw the vipirit through the window, its white flickering with fear.

Revenge had never tasted so sweet.
