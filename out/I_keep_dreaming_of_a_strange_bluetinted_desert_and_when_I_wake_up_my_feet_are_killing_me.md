How many nights was this now, collapsing on my bed into instant sleep only to immediately awake in a forest of cold gray sand dunes? As soon as I recognized the dream I knew that tomorrow I would wake with aching legs and the kind of exhaustion that comes with over a week of no sleep.

But I *was* sleeping. 

How else could you explain this desert, with its cool, tightly packed sand that doesn’t stick between your toes. Or the pitch-black sky that hangs like a blackout curtain across the horizon?

How would you explain the faint blue hue that blankets all that the eyes can see, providing perfect vision in a sunless world with nothing to see? 

Easy. It is a dream. 

In this dream I am a barefoot wanderer whose only companions are the footprints I leave in the sand. Footprints that never seem to fade no matter how many nights pass. They stretch on behind me as far as the eyes can see, disappearing over dunes I have already forgotten in my exhausted daze.

I walk, because it is a dream and in order to see it to the end, I assume I must push forward. I am driven by one desire: to sleep again, and nothing more. I do not care where this dream leads. Quite the opposite in fact, there is black ball of dread that forms in me each time I think of what lies ahead or look to the blackness past the horizon.

Last night I made fair progress, I think. It feels like I’m in the dream longer each team I visit it, yet I sleep and wake at the same times each day.

Also, my legs are very, very sore. 


Last night was more of the same. I am keeping this journal for myself in hopes of perhaps piecing together some sort of meaning to my leg pain, but it is difficult to read such uneventful accounts without falling asleep at my desk.

So last night, I tried something different, and although nothing came of it, I would still like to share what I did.

To begin with, I must note that normally I try not to look into the blackness around the desert. That one quote from that one guy always paws at me when I so much as glance at it. "If you gaze long into an abyss…” I think it starts.

But last night I did gaze, and long. What stared back at me was exactly what I expected: the color black. Nothing moved, there were no secret corridors or dots of light. I couldn’t even tell if what I was looking at was a flat wall or a bona fide sky—and yet…

I felt that quote, deep in my soul. As my toes crunched cool sand and I choked in the ever still air, I felt what man most fears to feel. And it was gazing back at me with an intensity than I could have never imagined.

A dream. Just a dream. There is nothing beyond the black curtain. This is MY dream, and MY mind, and I tell you now: there is nothing to be afraid of. Nothing at all.

Except sore legs. And boy, are my legs sore.


Last night was eventful. Finally.

I walked as I always do through the stale unmoving air of the blue-tinted desert but this time, I was not alone.

A figure appeared before me with his back to the top of a hill, dressed in black as the clichés go. His cloak ruffled and billowed beside him in the unmoving wind, and his face was twice covered—once with a black hood and again with a white featureless mask.

“Old one” it said and I, having recently celebrated my 30th, immediately took offense.

“Your journey has been long.”

I waited, aware that this was the first honest to goodness event that had happened since this dream began, hoping for some clarity or an offer of reprieve. Perhaps he would tell me to leave? I only needed him to show me the door…

But the figure did not speak. He only stood there and watched.

I cleared my throat and spoke

“I do not wish to be here. I would like this dream to end. I want to sleep.”

The figure’s mask shook and all around me a clicking sound echoed. 

“Indeed” it stated, “then walk.”

And the figure was gone.

I walked to where he was standing, halfway atop a dune and saw that he had left no footprints in his coming and going. Instead there were only two feet in the sand there, both facing toward the top of the hill.

I crested the dune, and my breath caught in my throat.

*Just a dream*.

Below the hill was a deep valley of unchanging sand but in the center was something terribly familiar that I had never seen before…

*A dream, a dream, a dream.*

…a single pitch-black pyramid, massive in size and missing its topmost piece.

Instead, atop its crown sat a large ball of blue light, of the same shade as the tint that permeated the entirety of the desert. 

I saw that pyramid below me, and its walls made of the same blackness as the horizon around me and I knew one thing: my dream is almost over.

And then, I woke up. 

Yes, in case you are wondering, my legs are sore. Extremely so.


I reached the pyramid. 

It seemed much further than it was, and I was helped along by the incline—I slid down it on my ass, screaming the whole time. If there are any predators in the desert, they now know where to find me. Or maybe they don’t. The dead air seemed to kill my voice, and prevent it from traveling—I think.

The remaining walk took what I assume are a few hours although it is nearly impossible to tell in the dream. Upon reaching the base of the beast I met with the cloaked man once again, still wearing his white mask. He said:

“You have arrived at last, Ancient One. Now we ask you, please, judge us.”

“Judge you?” I asked, incredulous “Why? Is this one of those dreams where I recall something bad I did and tried to repress?”

The man’s mask shook again accompanied by that echoing clicking sound.

“Judge us, as only one as old as you can” he said, and then he was gone. 

The spot where he had been standing once again had only one set of footprints, and they faced toward the pyramid.

Now dear reader, the rest of the dream was spent walking the entirety of the pyramid and touching every inch of the wall in hopes of locating a door. I have no idea how to get into this thing. Perhaps I should climb it, and enter from the top? I can only think of how sore my legs would be after…

After I made my way around the entirety of the structure, I looked back toward the path I’d walked. My footprints were still there and above them was the large hill I’d slid down, complete with a long, twisting, ass-width line.

I turned my eyes above all this, towards the blackness above me and around me and when I did, I flinched. There was nothing there to see, no movement, no creature and yet I suddenly felt like a mouse looking into the mouth of a lion. A mouse wading above a gaping shadow just beneath the surface of the sea. And the wall that stood between me and it was slowly crumbling.

That woke me up.
