Have you ever seen a turkey that was as big as a human, or was it a human that was as small as a turkey? Oh wait, I remember now: it was a hybrid of a turkey and human. Quite frankly, I don’t know how that abomination could exist, but apparently it does; at least according to a young man by the name of Trent. Now Trent has volunteered his recounting of his encounter with what he calls “Turkey Man”. I’ll leave it to you to judge the veracity of his account. 

Trent recalled that night to me with some trepidation. He stated that he was camping out in the woods with some friends. They were playing airsoft against his friend’s older brother and friends. About a quarter mile separated the two camps. The middle ground was marked by a stick with some turkey feathers they found. The night was cold with a dry breeze that weaved between the trees. Trent and his team had secured a few victories in some skirmishes, but could not capture the enemy camp’s flag. He said from the afternoon until the evening he saw nothing out of the ordinary; just some teenagers having fun. Once the sun had set below the treetops, odd occurrences started. 

Trent had eaten a campfire meal alongside his friends when they heard something strange off in the distance. Trent’s friend Will dismissed the noises as his brother and friends, but Trent wasn’t so certain. The smell of smoke hung heavy as they waited for any sound, without so much as a cricket chirp. (According to Trent, the noise had come from a different direction of the other campsite). His unease was momentarily forgotten when Will teased him about his current crush. The camp returned to the normal noise of fire and chatting soon afterwards. 

Will was about to add some wood to the campfire when they heard the noise once more, closer this time. It was close enough to distinguish it as a turkey call (which sounds like a gobble). Will and Trent remarked that the turkey must have been what they heard earlier. Isaiah wasn’t so sure. He didn’t hunt so he thought it sounded a little off. The other two shrugged and went back to cracking jokes. This did little to assuage Isaiah of his worry, but he reluctantly joined them.

Some time later once the chill had started to sink into each boy, Will said it was time for action; a midnight raid on the enemy camp.  This got Trent excited while Isaiah was more wary. Isaiah was sent to scout along the trail that connected the two camps. Trent headed to follow the dried creekbed that led near their camp to surprise the enemies with a flank. However, before they could make for their assigned missions a loud crash came from next to their camp. They jolted in surprise at the sudden sound that shattered the silence. What followed was a loud “gobbling” from where the crash occurred. The boys froze, their breath caught in anticipation. The “gobbling” echoed again growing louder—closer.

“Wait, did just hear ‘gobble gobble?’” Trent	asked in confusion.

“Must have had too much ‘Root Beer’,” Will snorted.

As Trent was about to snap back, they heard something running, the rustling of feathers accompanied by dried leaves being crunched and twigs snapped underfoot.

“What the hell?” Isaiah stammered.

“After it,” Will shouted, “I think it's Lance or one of his friends! They stole the flag!”

Trent ran after the noise and slipped down the bank of the creek.  He crouched on one knee to steady his airsoft gun. He flicked on the flashlight affixed to the barrel and scanned the creekbed. Their flag lay about twenty feet from where they had planted it.

“It is them,” mumbled Trent. 

He resumed his search, looking for the perpetrator of the failed theft. His flashlight beam came over something curled to the side of the creek bank. Trent strained his eyes to try and get a better look despite the dimming light from his flashlight.

“Is that a turkey?” he wondered aloud.
At that moment the creature unfurled from its curled position. It stood upon two thin legs. It had a pot belly that was speckled with feathers and dark splotches. The short, oddly angled arms clung to the side of its feathered chest. A wattle hung low from its spindly neck (Trent was despondent at this point of his retelling and required several breaks to recount it fully). Its head froze Trent mid-breath. A sharp beak glistened where a mouth should’ve been. Feathers smothered its small rounded ears. Its eyes stared, irises like pinpricks. Looking into them Trent knew that it wasn’t one of God’s creations (his words). The beam of light dulled and started flickering as Trent was shocked still. The flashes caused the creature to let out not a “gobble” but scream. Trent vomited from the overwhelming sense of dread and disgust. As his body seized upon the ground in the fading light of consciousness he saw it flutter away deeper into the woods.

Trent was pale and unresponsive to my prodding. I assisted him up, guiding him towards the door. He’d said all he could so I allowed him to leave. I do hope the medicine dulls his memory of that night.
