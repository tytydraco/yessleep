 I think I made a mistake reading my grandfather’s journal—and I don’t think I was meant to finish it.

My grandfather passed away five years ago. Last night, my mother brought his notebook up over dinner, saying that in his will he had requested she read through it once more.

Derin, my brother, asked her, “Why bring this up just now?”

She replied, “I wanted Jake to read it. I remember certain things—and when I reread it, entire months weren’t cataloged, even though I remember reading them.” She looked at me. “So, Jake… would you mind?”

*Date: 10/13/93*

Every morning when I wake, the room around me grows ever more nuanced.

Is this my thirtieth entry this month—or my three-hundredth? I don’t remember. Nonetheless, I am compelled to write my observations.

Leroy, the man across the street, came to the door again asking if he could borrow a rake.

Mandela received the Nobel Prize.

The news said there’s going to be a big storm on the 15th.

April.

The bartender at Mitchell’s keeps complaining about a newcomer.

Wh—why is there an entry from April here?

I checked—Mandela *did* receive the Nobel Prize on October 13th, 1993.

Aside from that, the next entry makes… less sense.

*Date: 10/14/93*

I’m alone today. Barbara took the kids to their grandmother’s.

I knocked over a painting. Inside the frame was a landscape repeating into endless hills. A man in a black fedora and coat stood atop the second hill, his eyes veering toward the cloudy horizon.

A man knocked on the door today. He claimed he was looking for a woman.  
He said he saw her walk inside.

Mitchell’s. A new man is in town. He keeps glancing at me.  
I walked up to him and struck up a conversation.

A reasonable man—no older than thirty-four. He carried a faint, irrefutable scent, one that was unmistakably his own.  
The bartender approached us and asked the man where he was from.  
“A small town by the name of Lecit.”

I spoke with my mother a moment ago and asked if she had moved any pages around.  
She asked, “Moved pages? Of what?”  
I left the room after arguing with her about asking me to read the journal.  
The next entry reads—

*Date:*  10/16/93

The neighbor’s tree crushed his car. A branch snapped and broke through a window of his house.  
He is sitting on the porch, writing in his notebook, periodically looking across the street.

Looking at my now-crushed car. —Damn thing.

The man from Lecit came to his house. He carried a briefcase. I asked what was inside, and he said it was “business-related.”

I talked to my mom and asked her about the perspective shifts in his journal. She looked at me, one eyebrow raised slightly, and asked, “Why are you even reading his journal?”

I think I should give some description of my grandfather—at least as much as I remember.

He was born in 1964 and died in 2021, at the age of fifty-eight. He was tall, though I don’t remember his exact height. I don’t remember his cause of death—and that feels wrong. What I do remember is that he was always honest, always kind.

—The handwriting begins as my grandfather’s and slowly shifts into my own.  
Mom had us meet our new neighbor today. He seemed nice.

But he was… different.

He invited us inside and offered us some kind of tea. He poured something black into it. Said it was “something he picked up from the store.”

Either way, I no longer feel ill like I have these past few days.

2022.  
February thirteenth.

I don’t recall writing this.  
Actually, I wouldn’t even have had the journal to write in—at least not if the date is correct.

I called my brother and asked if he was fucking with me.

He replied,  
“Grandpa’s old notebook? What are you on about?”

*Date:*  10/15/93

I had a strange dream last night. It felt as though I was inside the painting downstairs—as if I were trapped in an endless limbo. It felt real; too real.  Today is the day of the storm.

My wife is worried sick and asked me to board up the windows. While I was doing so, I saw a man standing across the street on the sidewalk. I don't remember going outside, yet by the time I went back in, he was gone.

The storm is set to arrive around three. The kids are in the basement preparing, and as I ponder, I look through the now-boarded windows, waiting for the gale to arrive.

I set the journal down a moment ago, but it slid off the table, taking a vase with it. The power has gone out, and we are now using candles in the basement.  (The rest of the page is torn off.)

I looked all around the house today for that paper. I'm assuming he just threw it away. Anyway, I asked Mom about the painting and whether we still have it; she replied, “The one with the sailboat? It should be in the basement. So, tomorrow after work, I will look for it. If I find it, I want to get a good look at it.

I’ve been trying to remember more about my grandfather—specifically, his cause of death—but I have nothing so far. I feel like I shouldn't ask because I’ve been talking about him a lot lately, and I’m starting to make Mom sad. It’s also just something I feel I should already know.

*Date:*  11/2/93

Haven’t written in this in a while. Almost forgot you existed.

I’ve been having recurring dreams—people whose faces I can’t make out, yet they tell me I’m supposed to know them.

Barb and I went to the dealership and bought a new car.

I looked back through some previous entries in this journal. I found them on the opposite end of the book.

The painting is now hanging in the hall.

I found the painting in the basement. It was inside a trunk, wrapped in rags. Beside it was a ballerina music box—and the bottom half of an entry dated October fifteenth.

It reads as follows:  
As the storm falls upon our heads, I can’t help but feel a tightening in my chest.

Rain seeps through a crack in the window. A thin trail forms along the floor, creeping toward me and my daughter.  
With the water comes a stench—like rotting meat left out to ferment.

A painting falls into the spreading puddle.  
A sailboat.

I flip the painting over. The canvas immediately begins to soak through.

—Ballerina head.

Lightning strikes a tree outside the house.  
Glass shatters.

The rest of the journal is nothing but empty pages.

But I was fixated on what *“ballerina head”* meant, so I went back downstairs and retrieved the music box. I wound it.

Nothing happened—except the tune sounded wrong. Off-key. Warped.  
I turned the key the opposite way.

It popped open.

Inside was a small vial filled with black goo. I watched as it swirled, its color seeming to consume the space around it.

I put the vial back into the music box, closed it, and finished writing these notes.

Every time I think about the vial, a pit opens in my stomach.

The painting in the hall is watching me.
