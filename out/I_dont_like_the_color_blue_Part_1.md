My backpack slammed to the floor with a sagging thud. It was over, for now anyways. Falling face first into my bed with a sigh of relief. The warm setting sun peaking through my only window was like a pat on the back. It was summer again. I rolled over and faced my idiotic posters I've drawn over the years. How to train your Galactic Plasmoid, Honey, I Froze the Cat and who could forget, Please help me, I have Spider Hands.

When I was younger I always wanted to be a block-buster movie cover artist. It's silly I know, but I just loved coming up with dumb movie titles and drawing what I thought the film poster might look like. It was about five thirty and I could smell mom's famous, or rather infamous spaghetti surprise. I could audibly hear my younger sister and brother moan when they caught a whiff of it. I remember grinning like some scummy front door salesman, scamming someone out of twenty bucks.

It wasn't that bad really, sure my friends never wanted to come over for dinner after they had it, but I didn't mind. It's an acquired taste, I thought. Just then my Walkie Talkie crackled to life. "We still on man?", Hank quickly buzzed. "That's a big 10-4 good buddy.", I affirmed. This was my last summer in the little town and I was going to make the most of it. My mom got a great job offer halfway across the country, and you know how it goes.

Ron and Hank had been my best friends my hole adolescent life. Always standing up for me and taking my side, even If I might have been fibbing a little some times. You couldn't ask for better friends. That was how we kind of fell in together. I was the new kid in town and I had just lost my best friend Pongo. I remember a lot of the other kids making fun of me when I tried to explain that something took him from our back porch. They just laughed and said that of course he was taken, Mr. Hands is always hungry.

They where right. We had only been in town for two days and my dog was already gone. It was Pongo's birthday the day before and I bought him a brand new blue collar complete with Scooby-Doo style tags. It took me four weeks to save up for his gift and I was so excited to give my best friend something brand new. I still remember every moment of the night he was taken by Mr. Hands.

Laying in my race car bed, getting really fast Z's per second, only bolted awake by the distinctive sound of a yelping bark. I knew it was Pongo and he was upset at something. I rubbed my eyes and rolled out of bed with all the grace of a bag of marbles dropping to the floor. I knew my parents where out late at some sort of business dinner, but my folks where really cool and let me stay home by myself. It's not like they where going to be out all night anyways. It was only about eight forty when I glanced at the little nightstand clock I had.

Rubbing my eyes and looking out of my second story window I could see Pongo was pacing back and forth looking agitated. Our new house was an old one, and the backyard porch light was pretty weak, only able to pierce a quarter of our yard. I thought that Pongo could just use some words of encouragement, because he slept in the house last night and this was his first night in the backyard.

I put on my rubber rain boots because they where quick to shove on my feet, and made my way downstairs to the back porch door. I noticed that the sliding glass door was locked, and I being very young, didn't quite understand how to open it. Still drowsy, I knocked on the glass and tried to alert Pongo to my presence. He only glanced at me for a moment before turning back to face the cloaked backyard.

His whimpers and yelps slowly became growls and sharp barks. I stopped mid knock and tried to focus on the dark shadows that seem to creep in around our yard. We where the last house near the old woods. A fact I loved about this house when we had just moved in. I thought about all the adventures I was going to have back in those dense trees. A connotation now I don't look back fondly on.

And that's when my eyes got a slight view of something, odd. An arm slowly pierced the cover of darkness creeping its way slowly towards Pongo's last bastion. I froze, it was so long, with multiple joints, even as a kid I had a feeling that arms don't grow that long, fingers that bony. I wanted to scream but nothing came out, my right arm still frozen mid knock. All I could do was widen my eyes.

Suddenly with a violent jerking motion the arm sprang into swift motion, like a frog's tongue catching a fly. Pongo yelped as the hand fully wrapped around his torso. The sound of the snapping noise reverberated off the trees. Just like a frog, it snapped back into the sinister darkness. The last thing I heard was the jingle of his dog tags in the darkness as they became more and more faint.

I was still frozen with terror at the back door when I heard our front door knob turn. In that moment I thought that the thing was coming to get me too. I broke down in tears, unable to hold back the torrent of emotions that where being so tightly controlled up until this point.

My mother threw herself though the living room, turning with such a hard right at the corner, I heard her brand new heels snap right off. "What's wrong!?", as her hole body wrapped around me like a warm blanket. Through my cries, I could only blubber out, "Pongo", "H-He's Gone!" My dad loved Pongo just as much as I did, and quickly pulled out an old flashlight from the junk drawer.

Swiftly he unlocked and walked out onto the back porch overlooking a sea of darkness and clicked on the light. "Pongo?", my dad called. He started to walk into the darkness when I called out to him in an unknown vocal power I never knew I had. Swiftly he turned back to me and ran back up the steps, "What is it, Sammy?", his eyes looked more worried about me in the moment.

I'm sure you can fill in the gaps from there. No one believed me except Ron and Hank, defending me at any chance. Hank was the first one to stand up for me, saying, "I believe you Sammy, I read in a book that all kinds of things aren't discovered yet!", "Who knows what's out there!?" It wasn't until I started to get bulled physically that Ron made himself known. He was a little older than us and his dad always taught him to stand up to bullies.

Ron was easy going and quite a joker, but if push came to shove, shove would have to deal with Ron. Being bigger and stronger than us was a real asset back in those days. Nobody messed with Ron. Hank started to grow into his own too after a while. I guess his family's military blood started to kick in. But he was still a dork at heart. The years started to roll by, and we've been friends ever since.

Now I have a little sister and brother and Hank always had a little sister, but she's about our age anyways. Hank just calls her his little sister because he was born six minutes earlier, he's a good brother though. I still think about Pongo all the time, even taking it so far as to look in the woods back behind our house every time I get the need to. I know I'll never find him, but part of me just can't let go. Seeing your best friend be yanked out of your life, right in front of your eyes will do that to a person I guess.

I don't even know what this thing looks like, not really anyways. That's why I started drawing. I thought if I could just draw what it looked like, It might not be that scary anymore. I think I got pretty good at the arms and hands of the thing, but I have no idea what it even looks like past the twenty third elbow. So it was time for me to evolve into a nerd too.

I remember asking Hank if he knew anything about urban legends, or creepy monsters one day in the tenth grade. Hank squealed so excitingly I thought the roof of his head was gonna pop off like a cartoon character. Turns out Hank loves monsters, and Ron loves watching scary movies and laughing at the bad effects. I guess I'm interested by proxy as well. The more I could learn, the better, I remember thinking at the time.

Hank told me I should head down to the local library and see what I could find out. And after a week or so of procrastination, I went. Our town was pretty small, and you could bike through the hole thing in an afternoon. If I had to guess, maybe around 2,000 people in all. Everyone knew every for the most part. Looking back, it really was some of the best years of my life. Getting free ice cream from the local shop, because your dad was friends with the guy who owned it, the baker throwing you a fresh muffin on your walk to school. It's not like that in the city, and really miss the sense of community.

I remember opening those huge double doors to the old library. It looked more like a church, if you ask me. Gothic architecture, gargoyles and of course, stained glass windows. "Yes young man?", "How can I help you?", came politely wafting over the large wooden, hand carved desk. Ms. Bigsbee was the sweetest old lady in town and loved to run charities and bake sales when someone needed a window fixed or some town project needed funding. I would say little old lady, but she was a bit on the rounder side.

"Oh, Ms. Bigsbee, I didn't know you worked at the library.", her eyes adjusted for a moment and a smile worked it's way across her face. "Oh, Sammy, almost didn't recognize you, your getting so big!" I was fifteen at this point and Ms. Bigsbee would babysit for us every now and again when the need came up. "Never thought I'd see you interested in books at such a young age!", she smiled with a slight playful giggle.

I smiled bashfully and coughed a little. "I'm looking for books on urban legends or, like, monster stories, and stuff." She frowned a little but then picked up the smile again. "Ahh, typical boy behavior, I suppose.", "Well your in luck we just got some of them goose'n' bump or whatever you call'ems." She could see the strain on my face and knew instantly that, that wasn't what I was looking for. "No, not like that stuff, like real old books and stuff." I was using my movie and TV knowledge to it's fullest. I remember any time there was a monster or creature you needed to beat, you always looked at some old dusty book or tome.

"Oh I think I understand, so like something more like town folklore, right?" I shrugged with a confused smile, "Yeah, I think so, I'm kinda new to this hole library thing.", I chuckled. Ms. Bigsbee smiled and quickly stood up, "You know, I think we might have something like that, I think it might be in the back with the town records, just wait here a moment while I have a gander." I nodded and smiled with hopeful eyes.
