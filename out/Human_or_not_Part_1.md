I woke up blindfolded tied to a chair. They had tied up my hands and legs so I couldn't move. I didn't know where I was exactly but I knew it had to be one of their offices.


"So Jason, You finally got caught. You've been giving us a lot of trouble lately you know?" said a female voice in front of me.


"Where am I and who are you?" I asked 


"I'm gonna be the one asking questions here , We both know [what you did](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/2TATCeC2jA) so let's cut to the chase. Where is the pendrive?" the voice said.


"Do you really think I'm going to tell you? I don't even know you are , One thing I can tell you is that pendrive had some really interesting stuff on there" I replied.


"You don't have to make it any harder for us or you Jason. Just tell me where it is and we can be on our way" the voice said.


I started laughing hysterically, There were other noises from behind me which made me realise there were more people here than I thought.


"If I tell you where the pendrive is , You'll have no use of me anymore and will dispose of me. Won't you?" I questioned back.


"It didn't have to be this way Jason" the voice said before I heard footsteps coming closer.


**BANG**


There was suddenly a banging sound , There started to be noises of panic around me.


**BANG BANG BANG**


The banging sound started getting louder and louder . The noise around me started getting higher.


I took the opportunity to make my chair fall. Finally my blindfold fell off my face.


I was in a white room surrounded by people with guns. They seemed to ignore me and discuss something else.


There was suddenly another loud sound followed by the sound of a huge metal thing dropping.


"SHOOT HIM" commanded the voice.


There were a lot of gunshots fired then. I couldn't see what they were shooting at because I was still tied to the chair. The sound of gunshots were soon replaced by screams and the smell of blood.


"Are you alright Jason?" a familiar voice called out to me. 


The footsteps of the person got closer and soon I was able to see his face.


"Tracey?" I cried out 


Tracey then started untying me. "I received a [message](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnnaturalUniverse/s/S8Mi1gDd2E) saying you were in trouble ,so I came to help" he explained.


"A message by who?" I asked him


"I don't know , They called themself DS" He replied . The ropes were finally untied and I could move freely.


"Now let's get out of here, Uh ignore the bodies" he said to me.


The room was filled with blood and dead bodies. It was truly a massacre.


We started leaving through the doors Tracey broke through. But we were quickly intercepted by more armed people. 


"This way!" I exclaimed running the opposite way of where he came from. He started following me.


"Where does this lead?" He asked


"I don't know , Somewhere where there aren't armed people trying to shoot us hopefully" I replied.


They were right behind us , We kept running then I noticed a weird hallway with red vines. It had a metal door with a panel.


We ran in and then I pushed a button on the panel which made the door close.


"We're safe for now huh" I exclaimed 


"No......Look behind you" He said in a terrified voice. 


I turned around and saw it. At the end of the hallway, The thing I barely escaped from last time was looking at us. Except it had grown 2 arms now , The flesh monster had arms and a huge red and black eye in the middle.


"Another unnatural huh" Tracey exclaimed.


"No......It's human" I replied.


"THAT THING IS A HUMAN?" Tracey said while looking at me with shock.


"Well it was , I'll explain later." I replied 


"What is it supposed to be then?" He asked


"It's name is Dave , Spare the rest of the details for when we are out of her-"


Dave started charging towards us before I could finish my sentence.


"I'll take care of this" Tracey said before enlarging his left arm and throwing a punch towards it. 


"NO-" I screamed


Too late , He had already punched it. It crashed behind me into a wall.


"What do you mean NO? We'd be dead if I didn't punch it" he exclaimed 


"We need to get to the other side of the hallway NOW" I said as I started running


"Why are we running?" Tracey asked about halfway through.


"Just look back!" I exclaimed.


Dave was getting up on its feet , While it had 4 arms now instead of 2.


"WHY DOES IT HAVE 4 ARMS NOW?" Tracey screamed while running.


"It absorbs impact and grows , That's why I told u NOT TO PUNCH IT" I replied.


"A WARNING BEFOREHAND WILL BE APPRECIATED" he said to me furiously.


Dave started charging at us again , Faster than before. Tracey and I finally made it to the end of the hallway and through the door. 


"I can't reach the button to close the door , It's too far away!" I cried out.


Tracey then stretched his left arm to hit the button. The doors closed just before Dave could make it in , He crashed into the door but wasn't able to break it.


"It should keep it out for sometime" I said while finally catching a breath.


"Now what is that?" Tracey asked in the same tone as when he saw Dave.


I turned around and realised that Tracey and I were not the only ones in the room.
