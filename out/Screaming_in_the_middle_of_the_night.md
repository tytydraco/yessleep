Hi, i wanted to share this experience here because it left me really scared and i dont know if i was just crazy or what. And im not sure who to talk to about this all so maybe someone here has expreienced something similar.

This summer me and my family went to our grandparents cottage to stay for the holiday.

Its a 50 year old cottage in the middle of nowhere. Theres a few other cottages there but theyre our distant relatives cottages and they dont often go there.

Its a 40 minute drive to the nearest store and the city is an hour away, so its very peacuful. Also I live in the northen europe so everywhere you go its just forest lmao.

Theres three buildings. The cottage where my family sleeps, a shed and a cabin where i stay alone. The cabin is small and doesnt have a bathroom so my family leaves the cottage door open for the night so i can use the bathroom etc. 

My family wanted to stay at my great grandmas summer house for a night because shes very old and could use the company. Also its not very far away. Only a 20-30 minute drive.

I didnt go because, idk i didnt want to and if i did go i would have to wake up very early and i thought that i could use the alone time. (dont call me an asshole, i did go visit her lol)

So my 2 younger siblings and my parents left and i was alone at the cottage, it was normal. I showered, used the sauna, cooked. Whatever you do at a cottage.

I went to bed around 12am, left the cottage door open and slept in the cabin because all my stuff were there.

I woke up around maybe 3am? I had to use the bathroom, i was thirsty and tired. 

I go to the cottage, pee and go to kitchen. 

As im filling up my glass and drinking water theres a sudden scream. And it continues. 

It sounded like a woman screaming for help, and it was sounded like it was very near. The screams were the same almost every time. Just screaming and calling for help repeatedly.

I tried looking out the window to the road but i couldnt see anyone. 

I got chills and felt so paranoid i hid under the kitchen table to hide. im not sure why, maybe so whatever was attacking that woman didnt see me, tho i dont even know if she was being attacked. It sounded like it but im nit sure becouse i didnt see anything happening when i looked to the road.

I was debating on what to do, 

go to the cabin to get my phone and call 112? Maybe go help her? Hell no, i thought. 

What if its a trap? I read somewhere that kidnappers lure victims to help a person screaming to then kidnapp them. But why tf would someone do that here, in the middle of nowhere at 3am???

It went on for so long, at least 20 minutes or more. I was calming down and at that point i was so annoyed i wanted to go tell that woman to shut the fuck up, people are sleeping. Its almost 4am. 

Then it stopped, so quickly. It was so quiet and unsetteling. 

I felt like someone was watching me, but brushed it off, i was just paranoid. Maybe my mind was playing tricks on me. Yeah i lost it, i got crazy and started hearing things. That was it.

I went to lock the front door and then i hid in the bathroom for the rest of the night. 

I guess i eventually fell asleep and when i woke up again i just stayed there untill my family came back.

When they finally  did i went outside with my parents and explained what happened last  night. Both of them are very logical and never believed in paranormal things. But they were weirded out by it, which didnt help at all to make me feel better.

Nothing like that has ever happened there, my mom stayed there countless times since she was a baby and never experienced anything like that. My dad tried to tell me i was hearing things and it was because of my anxiety or something?? They also made me promise not to tell my siblings, bc theyre very sensitive to stuff like that.

We only stayed there for one night before we left and that nigth i stayed in the cottage.
