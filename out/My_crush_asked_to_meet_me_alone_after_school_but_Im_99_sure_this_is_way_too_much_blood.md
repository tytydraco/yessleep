You know how that first crush stays on your mind like a swarm of bees, especially if you’ve had an intense encounter? It was the first time in my life that I was quite literally unable to stop thinking about something no matter how hard I tried. My powerfully positive emotions stuck to the overwhelming negative ones like two sides of the same coin. That, [combined with the police interrogation about her boyfriend’s stabbing](https://redd.it/1681ksi), left me overwhelmed and very confused about my first time experiencing an intimate physical encounter with the girl who dominated my thoughts. 

I didn’t know how much of it was normal, but I was quickly losing faith in the concept of ‘normal’ as a construct.

I tried to catch her eye during the following school day, but she was a master of making it seem like things had gone back to the way they were before, where I often doubted whether she could actually see me.

After 1,913 conversations with her in my imagination, I had given up believing that she would ever talk to me again. I told myself that it was for the best, that it was really *me* who didn’t want to talk to *her*, and that I was above the mind control that she was playing. 

When school let out, Penny passed in front of me. Without meeting my eyes, she raised an index finger with black nail polish and beckoned me forward. I immediately obeyed.

“Don’t walk *next* to me.”

“But-”

She sighed. “I’ll explain everything once we’re down by the river. Until then, we can’t be seen walking together, it’s too dangerous.”

The idea that we were sharing another intense moment, that a chance might arise where I could actually *protect* her, sent my head spinning. I’ve never tried crystal meth, but I doubt it’s far removed from the feeling of a potential intimate connection with your first teenage infatuation.

She stopped and turned around when we were alone in the place where I’d stabbed her the day before. “Do you want to tell me about the cops?”

“Huh?” 

Penny folded her arms. “The police showed up at your house yesterday, correct?”

“Oh.” I had been *really* worked up about that not very long ago, but had since just kind of forgotten. “Yeah, I guess they did.”

Her face fell. “James, I’m so, so sorry. I didn’t think it the ritual would affect Brent’s mind so much, but…”

Since my mouth was too dry to speak, I just raised an eyebrow.

“Brent didn’t exactly get all As his senior year. Or Bs. Or… Cs.” She looked at her boots and squirmed. “I didn’t start dating him because of his brain.” 

Then she gazed up at me, her chin low and dark, brown eyes wide. For just a moment, that look made me forget what breathing was.

“And… I learned the hard way that it’s one of many reasons I should have *stopped* dating him.” Her shoulders fell. “I told him as much, and that’s when he started…” Penny wiped her eye. “Anyway, it looks like his mind was so sensitive to the connection that he isn’t able to talk normally.” She sighed. “What did the police say?”

I scratched the back of my head. “Well, at first I told them that I didn’t know who he was, and they immediately knew I was lying. It was uncanny, they just cut right through my bullshit like a chainsaw through a stuffed animal.”

“That’s a really weird comparison, James.”

“Penny, we’ve established that my mouth operates with zero intervention from my brain while I’m around you. Anyway, they weren’t buying any of my nonsense, so I broke down and told them the truth. They believed that even less.”

“Did you say my name?” she gasped. 

“No,” I scoffed. “I would jump at the chance to fall under the bus for you. Isn’t that how Brent made you like him?”

She flashed a melty look that I didn’t understand. “No, I don’t think the idea would ever cross his mind.”

“Huh.”

Penny held this strange eye contact that confused me before brushing a lock of hair behind her ear. “So… then what happened?”

“I think they got kind of annoyed of my story about enchanted knives that could curse people from long distances, and they just walked away before I was finished. Look, this whole thing has been very confusing for me, and…”

Penny had pulled off her long-sleeved top and was standing before me in just a black bra.

“Um.” I told myself not to stare, but of course my dumb ass didn’t listen.

“I need you to get inside of me again, James,” Penny whispered as she extended the damn knife. 

“NO!” I leapt back.

“Just right here on my arm. No worse than last time.”

“Absolutely not,” I shouted, waving my arms in a protective gesture. “No. Penny, the POLICE are after me! It’s my senior year, my entire life is ahead of me! I don’t know exactly what I’m going to do with my future, but I *do* know how to fuck it up. And that involves knives, lying to the police, and continuing to stab people that I don’t want to stab!”

She was kissing me before I saw her cross the distance between us. No shitting, I actually stopped feeling gravity. 

I don’t remember the conscious choice to stop kissing. All I know is that my lizard brain was sad we weren’t doing it anymore and wanted to give Penny whatever she needed so she’d keep going.

My first solid thought was that the blade was going into her biceps. “Oh God damn it, you made me do it again!” I shouted.

Penny rolled away from me, her face twisted in pain. She lay against the ground for a few seconds, panting. 

But there was no blood.

Icy fear settled into my stomach. “Penny,” I whispered, “*what did we do*?”

Still gasping, she scrambled to her shirt and pulled it over her head, leaving her hair sticking in every wild direction. Despite the fear, I couldn’t help wondering if that’s what she would look like waking up next to me in the morning.

“We did something big,” she explained in a steady but urgent voice, folding her arms close around her ribs. “James – you need to understand. Can you listen to me very, very carefully?”

That fear roared in my chest once more. Every single emotion I felt around Penny was cranked to eleven, and I hated myself for wanting more. 

Penny placed her cold hands on my cheeks and bored her eyes into mine. “Brent got home from the hospital this morning. That’s why we needed to do this now, because his right arm is the one he uses to hit me. He’s figured out enough to know what’s happening, so we have to act fast.”

She drew a deep breath.

“He’s coming for you. The only option now is to take this knife to his house and [get him first](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).”
