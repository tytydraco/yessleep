After that night, Kay and I did become friends, best friends even. However, the death of the child gave us two different goals. Kay believed the child had to die because we angered god. The death of the child inspired her to attempt the Sisyphean task of pleasing this mad god.  It hurt her over the years. Her hair grew small strips of gray. Her eyes had crow’s feet before she was 18. She always smiled, lighting the room, but if she was a candle’s flame she was one gust away from disappearing forever. It hurt to watch.

The death of the child erased my trust in our god. I wanted nothing to do with him.  But I couldn’t break free, physically. So, I broke free virtually. I bypassed the parental block on my phone, and the whole wide world was at my fingertips via the internet. That’s where I learned about you people, dear reader, and what the outside world believes. I want to say this brought a great sense of enlightenment to me, but it made me depressed, anxious, and to be honest self-centered; I spent a lot of time on Twitter.

I amassed more knowledge than anyone else in my group, even the adults blocked about 99% of the internet on their phones but none of this knowledge made me happy or a better person. I became a fraud, a wise, self-centered deviant who explored all corners of the internet at night and pretended to worship this strange god in the morning. I believed I was getting away with it as well until it was time for discipline.

At our tiny private school, occasionally the secretary would come in and announce she needed students for discipline. That meant students had done something wrong and now they needed to be punished for it, anything was allowed for punishment. Discipline came at random. How could you know if you did something wrong with rules such as talking without permission, or being too loud at lunch? How could you ever know if you were safe? And do you think the teachers stopped taking notes once class was over? No, if they saw you commit any disciplinable action at church or even in your neighborhood you can be sure it was reported.

Before discipline, it was another lazy day in American history class. Our teacher sat on the far right and watched clips of his beloved Dallas Cowboys. We left our books open, notebooks on our desks, and pencils in our hands as we talked to one another in case Mr. Foyer told us to quiet down and actually do work.

Chatter and mischief filled the room. Students bounced from desk to desk gossiping and scheming. Who did what to who and where?  Guys untucked their uniform shirts. Girls pretended to be annoyed with guys’ flirtations. I freely scrolled through my phone. This was our playground. Understand, Mr. Foyer was a terrible teacher, but his lack of interest in teaching gave us freedom. So much of our lives was monitored not there though.

Mrs. Dana stepped into the room.

Without a word spoken we sat in our seats. I felt smaller. The room felt tighter. I could not read my classmate’s minds, but I knew what they were thinking. They were thinking the same thing as me.

Was it my turn to be called?

I could feel our previous sins in the air.  They came down on us like an itchy antique blanket. Every action we had done previously was questioned. Why were we up without permission? Why were we talking without permission? What did she see? Was it my turn to be called?

Mrs. Dana was a pretty woman and so sweet, so much of the time. She was also the woman who announced who would be disciplined today. She exhibited professionalism and grace unlike so many of our authority figures. Great smile, beautiful brown skin, and a reassuring voice, until it wasn’t. When she was not asking us to rise to be tortured every sentence she said almost always ended in a laugh. This was the woman who helped us find our ways on the first day of class, who would compliment any fashion decision we made that still followed our strict dress code. I know she was a shoulder to cry on for Kay.

Mr. Foyer rose from his seat, “Alright, class I told y’all to settle down.” Of course, he hadn’t told us to settle down earlier but like many of the adults, Mr. Foyer was a coward and refused to look like he was doing anything wrong.

I’ve read people’s comments to cult leaders; “How could an adult be a part of hurting a child?”

If you asked Mrs. Dana, I think she’d say, “You turn the switch in your head that thinks off. You follow a script.” We all saw her do it with astonishing results.

“I need to call a couple of students in for discipline,” she said in a dry authoritarian baritone in front of the whiteboard at the head of the classroom. An American flag hung in the left corner and a Christian flag in the right.

Mrs. Dana scanned the classroom. Her gaze was not still and patient like normal. Her eyes wandered and were expectant. Maybe, this wasn’t the part she had to turn off but was the part that was finally free. Did she enjoy that?

I always felt she would say my name. I always felt guilty. Still do. There’s always another sin isn’t there? I went over mine in my head and wondered if a teacher was there observing me when I thought I was alone.

“Toni, Jake,...” She didn’t bother with last names. We knew who everybody was, small school. It was always the same kids and I was clever enough to hide my flaws. My name was seldom chosen.

“Jez, Canaan...” It was almost over. I never got called so I shouldn’t get called this time.

“Assayria, …” Reflexively, I found myself thanking my god again under my lungs for keeping me safe for… “Sath.” I didn’t move. It felt too real and too cruel. I grabbed my desk and looked straight ahead at the whiteboard at the front of the class. It blurred and became hard to read. Random facts about American presidents were on there and all smudged together in my view. My heart was running, speeding. Of course, I didn’t look at any other student there was too much shame in having my name called.

“Come on, let’s go.” Mrs. Dana said and melted into her role as a villain. There was no bend in her voice. How could she be so resolute considering what they could do to us? That was her faith I suppose.

“Sath, get up,” she commanded me now. Each child was in line. I was the only one still seated.

“Go on up now, Sath. Take your medicine,” said our teacher Mr. Foyer. He’s still in the cult to this day. Most teachers leave and come back or die shortly after leaving. Not Mr.Foyer he is a short pathetic man who went along with this cult because he’d go along with anything that patted his ego.

I rose from my seat and followed. We were like a funeral procession or ghost children who could not acknowledge one another. We walked in the empty halls past the lockers into the main office and spread out around it. We circled a single chair, the one piece of furniture in the office, and cringed around it waiting for the principal to come to deliver our punishment and state our crimes. Many of us visibly cowered. My chest pulsed, the girl beside me cried quietly, and the boy beside me keep saying ‘fuck, fuck’. It’s odd, I don’t even feel comfortable saying their names now. I would never tell you who cried before they were punished or who said one of the bad words. There was a certain code we all lived by. What happened in discipline, stayed in discipline. The waiting was not the worst part.

And yet, I felt we were waiting a long time. And the fear in me was subsiding. Could I really be that lucky that discipline was canceled today?

Mrs. Dana pretended to busy herself around her desk. She held a folder of whatever our crimes were and smacked it against the desk.

“Where is Principal Fredrick?” she asked the air. She then turned to us and the glimmer came back in her eye. “Maybe he’s giving everyone mercy today?” And I could see she wanted that. She didn’t want to see us hurt. I’ll never forget how her smile stretched from cheek to cheek because it contorted right after.

“Oh, Principal Fredrick,” she said and the sternness returned. Then came the fear. I never knew someone could stand so still.

Principal Fredrick appeared at the end of the office. Seemingly, out of nowhere. His eyes were closed. Shut tight. They reminded me of the effort an honest kid puts into closing their eyes while playing hide and go seek. His black suit and tie were soaked. I assume with sweat because that’s what his face was covered in.

“Principal Fredrick,” Mrs. Dana said as we scattered, not bold enough to leave the room, but bold enough to squish ourselves into corners of the small office. Something was not right. This was not normal discipline. “How’d you get here? There’s only one door.” Mrs. Dana looked behind her as if that would confirm this magic.

“Yes,” Principal Fredrick confirmed and then touched his chest and moved his fingers across his wet, white shirt until he found his tie and adjusted it. “Yes, uh normally. I have- -” he sputtered and tears ran down his face.

“Principal Fredrick?” That’s all Mrs. Dana could do, repeat his name dumbly.

“I looked through a door I was not invited to go in,” he cried without remorse. With a freedom I have never seen a man cry with. Like a newborn’s baby cry. He stepped forward and behind him, I saw the impossible. A grey wooden door that had not been there before.

Principal Fredrick strode forward. Tears flowed down his face and made his cheeks glisten. Snot poured from his nose into his mouth which polluted every word he said.

“I have been told Sath must go through the door,” He opened his eyes and his two eyeballs dropped out of their sockets. They plopped down. They thud like rocks. Eyes do not thud like rocks. Nor could they just fall out of a face. One rolled forward and the other backward. One crashed into the door and sounded like a marble hitting solid oak. The pupil faced us, faced me.

Everyone in the room screamed. We were brainwashed in our cult to witness so much of the unordinary, bizarre, and evil. But this was out of the ordinary. We froze. I think someone pissed themselves beside me. Every kid in there cried freely.

“I apologize. I apologize.” The Principal said. “I saw something I should not have seen so I was given another pair of eyes. Where is Sath?”

“Where is he?” the principal asked and dropped to his knees. No one answered. Thank everything, no one answered. On his knees he slid forward and groped and sniffed, grabbing the first kid he felt and pulling them close to his nose.

“Where is he? I can smell him,” he said.

“Sath go in the door,” Mrs. Dana asked. She still had kindness in her. It was a request.

I shook my head at her, a desperate and pleading no.  The other one of Principal Fredrick’s eyes stopped rolling and landed at my feet. It was not an eye. It was more like a rock expertly painted to imitate an eye.

“Sath, for us please,” Mrs. Dana said. Principal Fredrick pulled at another student, gave them another sniff, and disregarded them against the wall.

Again, I shook my head no.

And that set her off.

“Get off the wall and go in!” she screeched.  A demonic, ear-drum popping, and vocal cord-violating screech.

Maybe she was as scared as I was then, and her scream to me was the plea of someone who was trying to save her own life.

I do know one thing though. She followed her faith. She believed with 100% certainty that she was doing the right thing. She rushed to me, clapped her hands, and screamed.

“He’s here, Principal Fredrick. He’s here,” she yelled and Principal Fredrick leaped on me. His knee slammed into his own eye on the floor

*CRACK!*

It exploded with more vigor than a bug under a foot. It burst open on my legs and feet.

“The door, Mrs. Dana. The door!” he bellowed. And Mrs. Dana ran for it. Opened the door and closed her eyes. She refused to look where she damned me to go. I clawed for anyone. The other kids deserted. Their screams echoed off the halls. Principal Fredrick squeezed me tighter. His wet arms constricted against my throat. I wanted rebelell against all I was ever told then. I wanted to kick an adult. Bite an adult. I wanted to free myself. But I couldn’t… Maybe, it was my home training. I just couldn’t. I don’t know how Principal Fredrick felt during the ordeal and for some reason that concerned me. He was crying when he picked me up and he kept crying.  The last thing I saw before Principal Fredrick tossed me inside was Mrs. Dana stepping on his other eye.

*CRACK!*
