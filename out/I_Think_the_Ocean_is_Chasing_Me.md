I realize how crazy this sounds, and coming from someone who’s a thalassophobe I probably just sound paranoid, but I know its happening. The ocean is chasing me, and it’s getting worse.

I’ll start by saying that I’ve always been afraid of large bodies of water. One of those kids that pictured a great white shark in the deep end of the YMCA pool. As I got older my rational mind developed, but no amount of rationality could convince me to enter the ocean. Even video games like Subnautica or SOMA are nearly unplayable for me. Humans evolved to live on land making even the weakest fish infinitely stronger than me once I’m in deep enough. Any wild body of water past a certain size and depth is a portal to a nightmare dimension filled with monsters.

Important? Sure.

Do I personally want to explore/study it? Hell no.

 Which is why a month ago when I had a dream about my bed surrounded by ocean, I was terrified. I woke to the sound of thunder with my groggy eyes vaguely taking in the dark black and purple of a night sky. It wasn’t until I noticed the far more horrible noise, the lapping of water against my bed, that my eyes shot open.

I sat up and saw the vast expanse before me. An uncrossable desert of black water moved beneath my bed, it’s agitated writhing drawing my eyes to the sky and the line of rolling black that approached. The growing violence of my beds motion was making me sick and despite not wanting to my dream self was drawn to the edge of the bed. There I gazed into the rolling ink that my bed floated on. It was too much and I threw up something that vanished into the cold water, devoured.

I heard a splash to my other side and flung myself in that direction, too fast. I felt the bed rock under me and my weight went too far over the side. For an eternally dragged out moment I hung over the water, every muscle in my body fighting the inevitable, the slow ripples from the splash colliding with the side of my bed.

Then I fell onto my apartment floor. I didn’t hurt anything, but my heart was pounding so hard I thought it might tear itself apart. I had soaked my sheets in sweat and every time I closed my eyes I thought about that black water and decided to stay up the rest of the night. Despite it being a little after three I wasn’t tired anymore.

Looking back, that was the first sign that something was happening. I didn’t think anything of it at the time but now I see it for what it was. The catalyst for the events to come.

**Event 2**

A few weeks after the dream, I was over at a friend’s house for our weekly ritual of watching bad anime together. It was just four of us tonight laughing at something called “My boss got reincarnated as a gorilla and needs to become an apothecary to save the world”… I think. An episode started where they had to go to a beach and the gorilla boss was dominating at volleyball when I thought to mention the dream. After hearing the story, they took the time to make fun of how goofy it was for someone who has never left the Midwest to be that afraid of the ocean.

We laughed and the conversation moved to where we should eat for the night. There was a Chinese buffet down the road that we all already knew we were going to go to. The question was just a formality. They knew us and we sat in our usual spot. Our plates were irresponsibly overloaded and with my other hand carrying a soup bowl of sauce I had to make a drop-off at the table before I could get a drink.

My friends were already at the table and digging in by the time I got back, and I set to work as soon as I was in the seat. The food was amazing as always but before I could go up for another plate, I always finish my drink and I always get water, because health is a lifestyle. I was prepared to down the glass so I could get back to my war against General Tso's, so I didn’t notice until the water hit the back of my throat that it was off.

It was loaded with salt. I spat it back into my cup where it splashed across my face and down onto my shirt and the table. Some of it had worked its way down my windpipe and sent me into a coughing fit where I almost spilt the rest of the glass trying to both cover my mouth and return it to the table with the same arm. My friends asked me if I was going to make it and the dirty look I was going to give them faded as I saw their faces. They were laughing a bit but more concerned and surprised than someone playing a prank like that would’ve been. One of them was grabbing a handful of napkins for me while the other helped contain the spreading water.

I hoarsely made the, “I have a drinking problem” joke and grabbed some napkins myself to help. I kept waiting for one of them to crack and tell me they had got me, somehow. I hadn’t left the table and despite being pretty deep into my food I wasn’t blind. The cup was right in front of me, I would’ve noticed if one of them had poured a couple teaspoons of salt into it and stirred the drink until it dissolved. I didn’t use ice but the water that came out of the machine was pretty cold. The more I thought about it the more confused I got. At the time I thought it must’ve been the machine, and it must’ve been pretty messed up because there was also a grittiness between my teeth. It felt like I had taken a trip to the beach.

I poured out the water and got a diet sprite instead. My second helping was just as good as the first and by the end of the third plate I was so full I was about to vomit and wasn’t thinking about the rough start to the meal anymore.

Nothing else happened for the rest of the night. Despite finding this odd it wasn’t until a week later that I figured out what was happening. That the ocean was coming for me.

**Event 3**

A week after my incident at the buffet I was making a trip to the grocery store when the event that convinced me the ocean is after me happened. The store was close enough I preferred to walk even if it had rained pretty bad earlier and was still sprinkling a bit. I prefer bad weather anyway, so I didn’t think twice about throwing on a poncho and heading out the door. It’s a little under a mile for me to walk to the store and back and I take the same route every time.

The trip there was uneventful but a little damp. There was a large puddle right outside the neighborhood that took up the whole path. The water didn’t look too deep, so I decided to cross it rather than go around. I tried to take slow steps to keep the water from splashing into my shoe but, despite my care, I walked the rest of the way with wet socks.

I picked up my usual at the store with a little extra treat for later and got on my way back to my apartment. It was coming down a bit harder and I upgraded my stroll to a speed walk. It didn’t take long for me to make it home and encounter that inconvenient puddle again. My socks were already wet and I was so close to home that I didn’t bother slowing any.

I was about halfway through when I stepped onto ground that wasn’t there. My foot traveled straight past the other and I dropped into the hole up to my hip. I felt like screaming as I quickly scrambled out but the water was so cold it sapped the air out of my lungs. I dropped my groceries and pushed with everything I had to get out. I swear that the solid cement path under my foot bowed like a tarp over a pool but it had enough substance I got my knees underneath me and I made it to solid ground.

I checked out the path and right where my foot had gone there was nothing but deep dark water. I didn’t want to get too close but couldn’t help staring, trying to piece together what could have possibly happened. I haven’t ever seen a sinkhole, but I thought maybe one had opened up while I was at the store. Is that even possible? I figured I would see some sign of that, and how had it filled with water so fast?

I didn’t want to test my luck but some of my groceries were starting to float near it and I really didn’t want to go back to the store. Anti-social tendencies drove me forward and I walked around to the opposite side of the bags giving the hole a wide birth. I was already soaked, and I figured that it would be safer to spread my weight out as far as possible. Like how you cross thin ice, but I couldn’t lay on my stomach, so I spread my knees and hands as far apart as I could while on all fours. I was as far back as my arms could reach and I pulled most of the items back to me in the bag. Some of the smaller items had floated out over the hole but they were still close enough for me to brush with my fingers. I reached and waited for them to come just a bit closer so I could pull them in.

That’s when that horrible bowing feeling happened again. Like the ground under my hand thinned to saran wrap before it just disappeared entirely. It didn’t crumble away, it just vanished, and I was left hanging there over black, dark, deep water. I hung there like my dream, an eternal moment of terror that defied the laws of gravity. In that moment I made out lights in the water. Flashes of so many colors, like deep sea fish make. It outlined something so terrible that my mind couldn’t commit its’ shape to memory. My breath quavered and I think I whimpered without meaning to. Cold lead filled my stomach and dropped it to a pit.

My knees grew weak, and I felt myself drift forward when some deep and primal instinct took over and filled me with more energy than I’ve ever had. My arms wheeled and my muscles were driven beyond my control to get me away from this horror as fast as possible.

I flopped back into the puddle and scrambled back before getting to my feet and getting away from whatever was happening here. I stopped at the edge and looked back, all my groceries were gone, just vanished into that abyss. I ran the rest of the way back to my apartment, shut my door, and managed to make it to a trashcan to vomit. I didn’t want to look at the toilet yet, too much water.

I tried all day to take my mind off what happened but every time I closed my eyes I saw those horrible lights. The shape kept changing, never quite what I had seen, like my mind couldn’t comprehend it but needed to process the thoughts. Like a poison that needed to be broken down before I could heal.

The next day it had dried up and I needed to go back to the grocery store. I took the same path and when I got to where the puddle had been I looked for the holes that should be there. It was a solid path. No holes. Nothing but asphalt.

I feel like I’m going crazy. After that I came back home and started writing these things down. I just want proof, or maybe I just want to gather my thoughts. I don’t know, I have no idea why this is happening to me, and I’m growing more anxious with each event. I’ll keep things updated if anything else happens.

**Update 1; Event 4**

I’m sitting here still draped in just a towel typing this. I thought that I would be safe inside my apartment, but I know I’m not anymore. It’s only been a few days since the last update and this time I think I almost didn’t make it back. These events are getting worse and I don’t know how long it will be before something happens to me.

I was taking a night-time shower, already a pretty vulnerable position to find yourself in, when I started to have an ominous feeling. Like something was watching me or something bad was about to happen. I started looking around for whatever could be causing it but only saw the shower curtain and tile walls. That feeling hung with me though and only got stronger as I continued my shower.

I started thinking about water, then large bodies of water, then the things that live in those bodies of water, and by the end managed to make myself so nervous that I washed my face with my eyes open to keep from closing them too long. I hadn’t done this since I was a kid who decided it would be fun to watch The Ring at 2:00 in the morning. I don’t think I’ve ever recovered. By the end I was more than eager to shut off the water and get on with my night.

I stepped out and let out a yelp. It wasn’t just that the linoleum floor had bowed in at my weight, but that ice-cold water had seeped in from around its edges and splashed onto my foot. I couldn’t do anything but stand there and stare at it. Water ebbed in and out of the gaps around the tile and that’s what my eyes hung on. Terror locked my muscles.

My phone was sitting in the other room charging. I was stuck. I didn’t dare try to cross the tiles for fear of falling through. The idea to crawl along the toilet and counter like some ultimate version of the floor is lava came to mind, but why would they be any more stable than the tile? Besides, I couldn’t pull myself away from that flowing water.

Noises began to rise over the hum of the bathroom fan. The sound of waves came to my attention, growing louder and more insistent with each lapping surge. I became aware of a slight rocking under my feet. A slow but noticeable rise and fall, an unsteadiness that began to make my stomach feel queasy. I sat down and grabbed my knees to my chest to try to calm down. It was then the power went out.

I don’t know how long I was like that, sitting in near absolute darkness, but it must’ve been hours. I felt that sickening rise and fall from the rocking of waves against the walls. Worst of all were the lights I could see shining under the further loosening tiles. They started off barely visible but gradually became brighter until they had to be right under the floor. That terrible glow that I had seen a few days ago in the puddle was here.

At the sight of those lights a primal part of my brain screamed to run, to abandon the ocean and flee to dry land. A source of terror so deep that it’s been carved into the mind of every generation after to keep them from this monstrous place. Wherever it is, we were never meant to come back.

I started to hear new noises. A slap then a horrible wet slithering only separated by the thin plaster and tile of my bathroom. My mind went to videos of squid and octopi exploring mollusks. Looking for any crack that they could slide themselves into and devour what was inside. I covered my ears and rocked back and forth.

Ice froze my stomach further with every splash, every rocking wave or jostle from that monster, every shimmer of indescribably beautiful and horrifying lights. One noise cut through all the others. I let out a short sharp scream at the knock on the bathroom door. I hadn’t heard the front door closing; my roommate was home. I called for him to come into the bathroom which he had a few questions about, but when I insisted he must’ve heard the pleading in my voice.

As the door creeped open I fought back the urge to jump across the floor and slam it shut. The image of sea water flooding in and that horrifying bioluminescence waiting for me filled my mind. Imagining finally seeing its form up close sent a sharp thrill of fear through me and I found myself clutching at my chest. As the final bit of door slipped past the frame a shuddering inhale filled my lungs. I squeezed my eyes shut and waited, but the icy water I expected never came. My roommates arm slipped into the bathroom and flipped on the lights, gave me a wave and a finger gun, and began to slide out.

Before his arm had even left the door I was over the tiles and at the door clutching the doorknob just in case the floor dropped out from underneath me. I grabbed my towel from the back of the door and nearly collapsed into the hallway. I’ve never been so happy to feel my apartment’s shitty carpet before. Once I was back in my room I sat down and started typing this right away.

There’s no history of mental illness in my family, I’m not crazy, I was scared of the ocean but now I’m terrified of it. I think I’ll show these posts to my roommate tonight so he knows what’s going on, why I’m acting so weird. I came up with a quick excuse about the bathroom being flooded, the lights being off, some of the bathroom tiles being dislodged. He didn’t buy it. I doubt I’ll get anything but made fun of from showing him these but it’s worth a shot. Now that I’m thinking about that stuff, I think I’ll tell my parents I love them, just in case. I’ll keep this updated, maybe someone will know what’s going on.

**Final update**

It happened. As I sit here in my bed, the vast ocean reaching the horizon on all sides, a part of me still hopes this is a dream. My eyes opened to black clouds approaching, my ears caught the horrible waves, my mind broke under the realization. My bed floats on agitated water, perturbed by the oncoming storm. This doesn’t feel like a dream though. The usual bizarre motivations and movement are lacking this time. I pinched myself until I bled and I sit here still.

But I remember how to wake up. Though this doesn’t feel like a dream and I don’t think it’s a dream I need to believe it is. The sanity I have left in this hell is the only thing keeping me together, but I feel I’ll have to let it go to do what I have to next. I’ve looked over the side a few times now, the same one I accidentally threw myself off all those weeks ago. I looked long enough to see those horrible lights deep in the darkness. It’s waiting for me down there.

Oddly enough my phone still works…slowly. If having signal out here wasn’t just the cherry on top of the insanity sundae. I’m typing this up to let everyone know but also to say I’m sorry I didn’t tell more of you what was happening. You’ll know once this is posted I suppose. I love you all and wish I had more time with you. I’m sorry.

I’ll wait until the storm is here then post this. If I’m going to die in what, in my opinion, is the absolute worst way to die, then I’m going to see one last storm before I go. My hands are getting shaky now and I’m having trouble typing. I think I’ll stop for now. I’m just going to sit a while and try to relax before I take a little dip.

The storm is here
