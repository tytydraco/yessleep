  

I never thought that finding a mobile phone would lead me down such a terrifying path. It was a cold and dreary day when I stumbled upon the device, lying in the alleyway behind my apartment building. I picked it up, thinking I could turn it into the authorities or at least try to find the owner. But when I turned it on, I realized that this was no ordinary phone.

There were no icons or apps on the screen, just a black background and a strange symbol in the center. It looked like some ancient symbol, one that I had never seen before. When I tried to turn the phone off, it wouldn't respond. I tried to take out the battery, but there was no way to open the back of the phone.

That's when the weird things started to happen. At first, it was just small things, like my TV turning on by itself or my fridge opening and closing on its own. I chalked it up to my imagination and tried to ignore it. But then, the really strange things began.

Late at night, I would hear whispers coming from the phone. At first, I thought it was just my mind playing tricks on me, but the voices grew louder and more insistent. They were speaking in a language that I didn't understand, but their tone was unmistakable. They sounded angry, almost demonic.

I tried to get rid of the phone, but it wouldn't leave my possession. Whenever I tried to throw it away or leave it somewhere, it would always end up back in my pocket. It was like the phone was attached to me like it was a part of me now.

The worst night was when I woke up to find a figure standing at the foot of my bed. It was tall and thin, with long arms and legs that seemed to bend in unnatural ways. Its face was obscured by shadows, but I could feel its malevolent gaze upon me. I tried to scream, but my voice was caught in my throat. The figure reached out a long, bony finger and touched the phone in my pocket. That's when I passed out.

When I woke up, the phone was gone. I searched everywhere for it, but it was nowhere to be found. That's when I started to feel a strange sensation in my head. It was like something was trying to push its way into my mind, like an invasive thought or memory. I tried to resist, but the pressure was too much. I felt myself losing control, losing myself.

That's when I saw the figure again, standing in the corner of my room. It was holding the phone, and its eyes glowed with a sickly green light. It spoke to me in that same demonic language, and I knew that it was trying to possess me. I tried to fight back, to push it away, but it was too strong.

I don't know how long I was under its control, but when I finally came to, I was lying in the alleyway where I had found the phone. It was lying beside me, still glowing with that sickly green light. I knew that I had to get rid of it, to destroy it before it could harm anyone else.

I tried to crush it under my foot, but it wouldn't break. I tried to throw it against the wall, but it bounced back like a rubber ball. It was like the phone was indestructible, imbued with some kind of dark magic.

That's when I knew that there was only one thing left to do. I picked up the phone and threw it as hard as I could into the nearby dumpster. 

I heard it clatter against the metal sides of the dumpster, and then there was silence. For a moment, I thought that was it. I thought that I had finally rid myself of the cursed phone and everything would go back to normal. But then, I heard a strange noise coming from the dumpster. It was like something was crawling around inside, something that wasn't quite human.

I hesitated, unsure of what to do next. Should I leave it there and hope that no one else would find it? Or should I try to destroy it once and for all? In the end, my curiosity got the better of me. I cautiously opened the lid of the dumpster and peered inside.

At first, I didn't see anything out of the ordinary. Just a pile of garbage and debris, and then something moved. It was quick, almost too quick for me to see. But I caught a glimpse of a thin, bony arm reaching out to grab the phone. The figure pulled the phone back into the shadows of the dumpster, and then everything went silent once again.

I knew then that I had made a grave mistake. I had unleashed something dark and sinister upon the world, something that I couldn't control. I tried to walk away, to forget about the phone and everything that had happened. But it was too late. The figure was following me, watching me, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.

For days, I lived in fear. Every time I turned a corner or heard a strange noise, I knew that it was there. Watching me. Waiting. And then, one night, it finally caught up with me.

I was walking home from work, trying to ignore the feeling of unease that had been gnawing at me all day. I was almost home when I heard a noise behind me. I turned around, but there was no one there. Just an empty street and the sound of my own footsteps.

That's when I felt something cold and hard press against the back of my neck. I froze, unsure of what to do. And then, I heard its voice. It spoke in that same demonic language, a language that I could almost understand now. It told me that I was its puppet and that I had no choice but to obey.

I tried to fight back, to resist its hold over me. But it was too strong. It had complete control over my mind and my body. I was its plaything, its pawn in a game of darkness and terror.

For years, I lived in its shadow, always on the run, always hiding from the light. I knew that I could never escape it, that it would always be there, waiting for me. And then, one day, it finally caught up with me. It pulled me into the darkness, into a place where there was no light, no hope, no escape.

I don't know how long I was there, lost in the darkness. But then, I saw the light. It was small, almost imperceptible at first. But it grew, slowly and steadily, until it was a beacon of hope in the midst of the darkness.

I followed the light, knowing that it was my only chance at salvation. It led me out of the darkness, back into the world of the living. And when I emerged, I knew that I had been changed forever.

I was told that I had been in a car accident.

I was in a coma for six months.

But now I'm awake

The phone was gone, but its legacy lived on. I was haunted by its memory, by the memories of all those who had fallen under its spell. But I also knew that I had a duty, a responsibility to warn others of its dangers. To keep them safe from the darkness that lurked within its circuits and wires.

And so, I tell my story, hoping that it will serve as a warning.
