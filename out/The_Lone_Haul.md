I used to be a trucker for a living. It wasn’t glamorous work, and it wasn’t for everyone, but I enjoyed it for a while. I would settle in with a big cup of coffee and a few audiobooks, and set off cross-country. You got to see a lot of places, sights, people. Things too, sometimes. Weird things you can’t explain. The reason I stopped hauling was because of one of those things.

In the fall of 2010, I was driving Northeast to D.C. I had made a stop in Knoxville for lunch and got to talking with a local guy. He was nice enough, and happened to drive to and from D.C. pretty regularly. I mentioned that the brakes on my truck weren’t doing too well and he told me about a shortcut that bypasses the mountains. I didn’t want to take any chances with my brakes on a high grade decline, so I decided to give it a go.

When I got to a tunnel entrance in the middle of nowhere, it was dark out. The tunnel was dimly lit, only a few lights lined the ceilings. I was in a large forest, incline of the mountain to my left and a river to my right. The tunnel ahead had a faded height clearance sign that said “10 Feet - 6 Inches Clearance”, which was about 3 feet too short for my truck to fit. The instructions never said anything about a tunnel. That was always the risk with getting directions from non-truckers. You don’t have to worry about mountain grades, clearance heights, or tight roads when you drive a sedan.

I had no idea where I was, and none of my regional maps of Tennessee, Virginia, or Carolina had this area on them. To top it all off, my phone had no service, not even emergency service. My radio hadn’t gotten any responses on any of the channels I tried, either. I was nervous, turning around was going to be dangerous and time-consuming. From the looks of it, it was going to be at least a 5-point turn. As I turned my cab lights off and my eyes adjusted to the dark, I could see inside the tunnel. It looked like there was a man standing there, looking at me.

The way I had pulled off the road pointed my headlights away from the tunnel, so I was out of luck on getting a better look inside until I straightened up the truck. I backed up and began to pull forward and turn slowly. As the headlights illuminated the interior of the tunnel, I saw nothing. There didn’t seem to be a man after all. I didn’t want to wait and find out if I had imagined it or if it had just moved, so I began my slow and methodical U-turn.

I turned hard to the left, pulled as close to the tree in front of me as I could, put the truck in reverse, and began to cut right. As I looked out the window to look in the tunnel, I could see the man. He was back, and closer.

I knew I wasn’t imagining things this time. It was still hard to make out any defining features, but I could definitely tell it was a man. He was about 50 yards away from the cab and didn’t move. I was struck with fear. I made sure the doors were locked and kept my eyes on him. I cracked the window a little bit so I could yell at him.

I shouted, “Hey, you’re freaking me out! I’m trying to turn around so if you aren’t gonna help, get lost!” The words echoed down the tunnel and the figure didn’t budge. A little more unsettled, I rolled up the window and pulled out my pocket knife, blade out, onto the seat next to me. I started backing up, and went to put the truck back into first when I saw the figure again outside the window. He was closer again, this time only about 40 yards away. I felt the trailer begin to slip; I hadn’t taken it out of reverse and I had backed a tire off the road. I slammed on the brakes to stop before I hit the tipping point.

Very carefully, I put the truck into first and pulled forward again. Point 3 of the turn. I checked the side view mirror as I came to a stop again. The words “OBJECTS IN MIRROR ARE CLOSER THAN THEY APPEAR” read across the bottom of the mirror below the man, who looked to be about 20 yards away now.

I put the truck into reverse. My heart was pounding. I began to back up the truck, almost losing grip on the steering wheel from the sweat on my palms. I never took my eyes off the figure as I got closer to it by backing up. The wheel slipped from my hand, and I briefly looked forward to regain my grip and check to see if I could finish the turn and pull away.

I had just enough space to turn and pull away. I was almost free and on my way.

Then I heard the passenger door handle get pulled.

I froze. I couldn’t move, paralyzed with fear. In my peripheral, I could see the figure. I could feel its gaze. Muffled through the window pane, I heard “Hhhhhhhhelllp. Lossssst.” in a strange, unnatural inflection that almost sounded like my own voice.

I broke out of my stupor and switched into gear, pulling away as fast as I could. These roads were very curvy and so I couldn’t go as fast as I would’ve liked.

I didn’t feel relief until I saw a few streetlights and the illuminated “OPEN” sign at a gas station. I pulled into the station and finally opened the door to make my way inside.

There were two attendants inside, a middle aged woman and a younger man. Both were watching me as I walked in the door, and the woman spoke to me. “We saw ya drive by earlier and hoped you’d be back soon. Figured ya couldn’t get through the tunnel with a truck that size. Maps are over yonder.” The woman pointed at a metal display containing maps of various regions in the area.

“Thanks, that’s the last time I take shortcut advice from someone who doesn’t drive a truck.” I walked over to the maps and realized something is making me feel on edge. She had said they “hoped” I’d be back soon. Do they know something about whatever it was that I just saw?

I turned around from the map stand and before I could say anything I saw the figure again. It’s outside, standing by the back of my truck. Staring straight at me. I couldn’t see its eyes or any defining features, but I just felt that it was staring at me.
The woman spoke up. “It seems ya got yerself a hitchhiker. Looks like ya made it here in just the nick a’ time. They don’t like light or when yer with other people.”

I diverted my gaze to the woman. “...they? What do you mean…who are they?”

“Lotsa folks got different names for ‘em. Heard lots of names for ‘em, but we just call ‘em shadows. They disappear when there’s light and they seem to attach to folks and follow ‘em.” She looked outside at the shadow. “You gotta be careful ‘round these parts. They don’t usually make it into cities since there’s too much light, but in dark areas where even moonlight can be hard to find…well, they do pretty well if ya aren’t prepared.”

“Well…what do I do? How can I get away from it? And….what if I can’t?”

The man crouched behind the counter to grab something. “We can help with that.”

The woman nodded “Yep, we got some stuff ya can use to get it away from yer truck. Then ya just haul ass outta here and don’t come back at night. They stick to the same area mostly but if they can track ya down and yer nearby they’ll follow ya. As fer what happens if ya can’t get rid of it, usually folks just disappear. Sometimes they just act real funny, not remembering a lot and seem kinda out of it for the most part. They don’t ever really get better. Eventually, they disappear too. Most folks think they feed off of ya somehow, and some eat slower than others. But anyways, we got a business to run, and dealin’ with outta towners like yerself ain't cheap.”

She nodded to the other man, who went through a door behind the counter. She hit some keys on the register, then looked up at me. “Map’ll be free, but the help’ll cost ya. Hundred bucks. Ya need anything else?”

I was already low on funds for the trip and wasn’t sure if I could make it the rest of the way with a hundred dollars less. What other option did I have though? I reluctantly got out my wallet and paid. “Nothing else.”

“Alright, if yer ready go over to the door. We’ll make sure it’s gone with ya and send ya off.” She opened the door behind the counter. “Alright, turn ‘em on.”

I saw lights coming from all angles of the gas station and even the grassy patch on the other side of the road. It was brighter than daylight outside. My truck was completely lit, not a shadow in sight. I noticed that the woman was now next to me at the door with a flare in one hand and a giant flashlight in the other. “Alright, now let’s get ya outta here.”

She opened the door and walked out, but I hesitated for a moment. My head was spinning and there was a giant pit in my stomach. I had seen some weird things before but nothing like this. After a moment, I built up my courage and suppressed those feelings. If I wanted to get out of this I needed to do what I was told. I followed the woman.

We examined both the outside of the truck and the cab interior. “No use checking the trailer, they can’t pop the lock and squeeze in.”

I started up my truck and the man was now outside with the woman, giant flashlight in tow. I rolled down the window and thanked them, pushing down the thoughts of my nearly empty wallet. They just nodded and watched me pull out. I didn’t see them turn off the lights, they probably wanted to leave them on for a while just to be safe.

I barely got to D.C. and only could do it by skipping a few meals. I did buy a few flashlights the next time I stopped and kept them in the truck. I never saw any signs of a shadow after that. Once I finished the trip home, I quit trucking and sold the truck. I didn’t even drive it to my house, I was too nervous it had somehow followed me all that way. I usually feel safe, and usually don’t worry too much about it.

Sometimes, I remember that I’ve forgotten. I remember everything about that experience vividly, except for the drive to the gas station. Once I started driving, I don’t remember how long it took to get to the station, or even getting out of my truck. It’s like a shadow was cast over my memories of the drive. Those are memories I’ll never get back. And honestly? The shadows can have them.
