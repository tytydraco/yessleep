Hey Siri, could you please take notes ? Is it working ? I think it’s working. Anyway, so these are just some personal notes to myself, so that I can keep track of the noteworthy things in the house I’m driving to go check out, and maybe make it more attractive for the potential clients that might buy this house.

Rumor has it that some poor girl got mutilated pretty badly in that house by her crazy neighbor, that neighbor since long has moved away from the neighborhood, perhaps I can put a spooky spin on this so that I can market it for the horror fans ? I mean there seems to be a bit of a craze for that at the moment.

The land that the house is sitting on has been owned by many different people throughout the years, the earliest I could find was that there was a small farm here around the late 1500s and has later been rebuilt several times, the current house was built during the 1950s. According to my research, it was built on the same exact spot as the original main house, and it has then been owned by several different people over the years, whom has only stayed a year or two before moving out again.

*car horn honking for 10 seconds* bastard, don’t you know how to drive you idiot, it’s green! no no no no, don’t add that Siri, oh well I guess I’ll have to edit that later, anyway, so as I was saying, the property seems to have been owned by a family by name of “Good” at some point.. hmm where have I heard that last name before… I really can’t remember.

I’m coming up on the property now I think, it has a long gravel road with fresh gravel, though the iron bar fence looks like it needs a fresh coat of black paint, it shouldn’t be too difficult, other than that the front yard so far seems to be kept in pretty good order, grass is neatly cut, there are a few apple trees, some rose bushes and a big walnut tree, Jesus that looks so big, I wouldn’t be surprised if it was planted sometime when the original owners of this property had it, still looks well kept though.

Oh there is an old man working in the front yard as well, I better go talk to him to see if I’m actually in the right place, this house almost seems too nice to be for sale.

*car door slams and car alarm chirps*

-Excuse me, hey there, heeellooooo, Hey!

-Aah sorry madam, are you the new owner of this house ? I’m your next door neighbor Jeffery, I promised the previous owners that I’d keep the garden fresh here, and I do enjoy working in the gardens.

-Ah no, sorry my name is Lisa, I’m what you’d call a house flipper and I’m just looking over the house and seeing if there is any improvements I can do to make sure that it sells.

-very well then, it would have brightened up this neighborhood to have such a pretty face as yours as a neighbor.

-are you flirting with me ? Because I’ll tell you..

-I can assure you madam that I am most certainly not flirting with you, I am far to old for such things, no, the only things I would possibly flirt with are the roses over there, aren’t they beautiful ?

-oh, sorry about that… Anyway so is this 83 Laurier road ? I just want to make sure that I am at the right place.

-yes you most assuredly are, and this have been a lovely chat, but I have to finish up here before it gets dark madam, you see, the roads can get a bit devious to navigate when it gets dark here.

-ah, thank you, that might be good to know, I can add that to the list of possible fixes, maybe I’ll look into putting in some street lights, thanks for the talk… Jeffry was it ?

-yes, Jeffry, and have a lovely day Lisa.

*rapid steps on gravel* so, I have to keep in mind that Jeffry seems polite, but I couldn’t quite place his accent, British maybe ? He sounded far too.. what’s the word… Posh ? To be from the south at least, ah, the house looks amazing, but the wind boards might need a good scrub. Other than that from the exterior it seems like this will be an easy sell.

*snapping photos*

*steps on woods*

The front porch looks decent, where did the owners say that I could find the key to the door again? Ah, right under the gnome *wood cracks and a loud gasp* oh my, looks like we need to add some floor boards to the list, they look to be in a lot better condition than they seem to be. At least I found the key *lock clonks, door creaks* oh we definitely need to open some windows, the air in here smells stale, and dear god that wallpaper, it’s absolutely awful, we definitely need to replace those with something more modern.

I’m currently walking in from the main hallway into the living room, I guess the previous owners really didn’t want to leave much behind for the next person, there just a small wooden table, a couch, the fireplace looks to be in good order, but there is a bizarre painting hanging on one of the walls, it looks to be of an old lady, wearing clothes that was all the rage a couple of hundred years or so ago, it gives me a kind of creepy feeling, which keeps growing the longer you look at it, should fit in perfectly if we’re gonna go with the main plan.

*cracks open two windows*

There, much better, the dust in here really isn’t good for my lungs, oh well, on to the kitchen, the windows really let in a lot of sunlight in here, it’s very bright, walls painted white in here, a small island in the middle, stove looks brand new *creak* but the cupboard doors might need their hinges oiled or something, oh there is a vase of roses on the dinner table, they do look really pretty, Jeffry certainly knows how to take care of flowers, but it makes me wonder if he has access to this house, or if the previous owners just thought they looked pretty enough to put there, it’s a nice decoration either way.

Next up is the laundry room, walking in here the air feels a little bit damp, seems to be a little bit of mold creeping up the walls, I don’t think that’s much to worry about, we can fumigate it and later air it out, other than that the washer and dryer seem to be never have been replaced since the house was built, we should upgrade those to new ones, energy efficiency is always a really good selling point.

There are a few other rooms here, according to the plans, a bedroom with easy access to a bathroom, and a general storage room, both are currently empty, one idea might be to get a bed for that room and a workbench for the storage room to make it look more livable.

There is a very welcoming creaking in the wood in the stairs as I go up to the first floor, the hand rails seems to have been heavily used but still keep up well maybe some wood polish would work nice here, looking quickly at the rooms up here seems to be the same story as the bedroom and storage room, nothing really to note, though the master bedroom is quite large and have plenty of room for activity in it..

Alright, that’s about it for the notes, up here, we might need some curtains for… *creak* AAAAHH!! *slam*

*uuhh*

*uuuhhh* my head *scambles and rustles*

Shit, the screen of the phone broken, cracks and splintered all over, can’t see anything, it’s so dark in here now, I must’ve passed out when I fell through the floor I don’t even know if you’re still dictating this Siri, but it feels better to talk at least.

*groans* ah, *short inhale* I think I sprained my ankles or something when I fell, it hurts to move around, but I don’t think I’m too badly hurt..  I can smell something burning, and there is a light glow coming from one of the rooms, I’m going to try to get over there in case I ripped through some electrical wires and it started a fire.

*pained groaning and limping*

*whispers* holy shit, did someone break in while I was passed out !? The fireplace is lit… and now that I look around, what !? The entire living room has changed, there are more paintings on the walls, there are tables and a big sofa, a rocking chair and… there is some activity outside, I can only see silhouettes, they look human, they are dancing around a fire, throwing some liquid in the air and showering in it while they dance around. I’ve got a sickening feeling in my gut from watching this *floor creaking* I’m trying to be quiet and sneaking, I feel like I need to hide, I’m going to try and hide in the washing room.

*rapid breathing* holy shit, shit, shit, shit,shit *whimper*. There is a man in here, he is chained to the wall, he is missing his left leg at the knee and he is bleeding heavily from the wound, he also seems to have some metal clamping device attached to his skull, with what looks like a drill bit sticking into his right eye, it’s slowly rotating into it, like it’s trying to literally drill out his eye out of the socket *heaving* oh the smell in here is just awful, but he does seem to still be breathing, I’m going to go see if I can get some help, maybe there is something in the storage room that could be useful.

*door slowly creaking* I’m now sneaking over to the storage room, slowly making my way through the kitchen and the living room, *door handle jingles* huh for some reason I expected the door to the storage room to be locked… it is very dark in here though.. there is a strong smell.. almost a bit like drain cleaner.. I don’t think that could be used to clean the wound on the man. Oh this will be useful, I found a hacksaw, at least I can cut the chains that is holding him there, and maybe stop the drill… we still need something disinfecting though,

Ah a towel, I’ll get some water in the kitchen and at least I can maybe stop the bleeding *door opening and closing* *water pouring* alright let’s sneak back to the washing room, you can do this Lisa, come on, don’t freak out, almost there *smack* ugh…

-*demonic voice* Silly woman you have no idea where you have ended up huh, oh you will learn not to stick your nose in other peoples business…

*static white noise*
