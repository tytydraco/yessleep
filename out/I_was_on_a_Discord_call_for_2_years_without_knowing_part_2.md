It felt like this psycho was running in circles around my house for hours before they stopped right in front of the bathroom door where I was hiding. Holding my breath, I grabbed my hair dryer from the cupboard and grasped it as hard as I could. It seemed like the only thing I could use as a weapon.



“Don’t come in.” I muttered under my breath. “Please, don’t come in…” My voice was shaky, my arms were trembling, my vision was blurry.  


I shouldn’t have said anything because he started banging on my door, screaming. I put all my weight on the door, praying that it would end soon. Tears dripped down my face as I put all my strength into blocking the man from entering. A few minutes ago I was in my room, excited for a nice, restful weekend. Now I'm contemplating whether I will wake up tomorrow.



“Get out!” I shouted.



The man kept screaming.



And screaming.



And screaming. A blood-curdling scream that made me wonder how my neighbors didn't here anything.



It felt like an eternity went by, each slam on the door crashing onto my stomach. I then felt a sharp pain surge through my body for a split second.



Until suddenly, it all stopped.



I remained still for a bit, holding my breath and curled up into a ball. My body shook in fear. My mind was blank, ringing in my ears.



“This is the police!” I heard from a distance.



I heaved a sigh of relief and sprinted to the door where 2 police officers were waiting outside. Looking around, the trace of the man was gone. All except for the handprints on my window.



I tried explaining everything to the police officer. How I was on a Discord call for 2 years without me knowing. How this man threatening me and my family. How he ran after me and almost hurt me. How he has been stalking me. Everything.



I showed all the messages to the police and they asked me a few questions. Specifically how the fuck the Discord call went for 2 years without stopping. Or how the call kept going even after turning my computer off every night (something that was practically impossible). I couldn’t explain any of these things to them. 



The police got the personal information of the account and tried to track its IP address. The weird thing is that there was no record of the account anywhere on the internet.



No location.



No email address or anything to base how the account got made.



It was as if the account was never made in the first place. The messages were still there though. What was going on?



The police offered to scan the premises to find any information that they could use to track this man, but there wasn’t much to go off of.



They took a sample of the man’s saliva from the window and told me that they would conduct an investigation as soon as possible. Unfortunately, they couldn’t do much else right now. I gave them my phone number and they left me alone for the night.



As soon as the police left, I felt sick to my stomach. The feeling that I was being watched became even worse than before. And what’s even worse was that I had practically nothing to prove it.



I scoured the internet for anyone who had similar stories to mine, but no one seemed to have one. Was I finally going crazy from trying to over perform in my job? I guess I just had to wait until the police got back to me.



Obviously I didn’t sleep a wink that night. In fact, every time I closed my eyes, I could see that man’s grin staring right at me, his body shaking uncontrollably from the other side of the window. The longer I closed my eyes, the clearer his face was to me. Little did I know, things were about to get even weirder.



As the next day came, I felt like my existence began becoming more…hazy? As if I was losing touch with reality. It's difficult to explain, but it wasn't anything I had felt before.



I was exhausted and wanted to sleep, but I physically couldn’t. It felt like something was taking over my body. Like if my conscience was being pushed away by something every second. It felt like that man’s face was trying to take over my body. My soul. I had to focus just to stay in my own body. 



Looking at myself in the mirror, my face was pale white with chapped lips and massive eye-bags. I took a paracetamol to hopefully feel better. Medicine should help….right?



“Maybe I just need a walk.” I thought to myself. Thank god I didn’t have work today at least. It was a Saturday. Maybe I was paranoid? 



As that thought came into my head, I heard my phone buzz. Jumping into the air in fear, I crash my head on the towel rack above me. It really fucking hurt, didn’t wake me up in the slightest either.



Checking my phone, it looked to be the police officer I had given my phone number to last night. I grabbed my phone and accepted the call.



“H-hello?” I replied, barely able to utter a word.



“Jeez, you alright? You sound dead.” It was the police officer from last night.



“Yeah.” I said. “Just…feeling a little odd, that’s all.”



“That’s normal after yesterday.” He cleared his throat. “Are you able to come to the police station right now? We found some info that-“ his voice stopped for a moment. He sounded nervous, uncomfortable. “That you may wanna hear…” he managed to say.



My heart stopped for a second. I checked the time: 7pm.



“I-I’ll be there in 15 minutes.” I stuttered.



“Be sure to brace yourself.” He said. He sounded distressed. “I’ve never seen anything like this before.”



The fuck is that supposed to mean?
