We know more about space than we do about the depths of our own ocean, at least that's what they say. I'm not sure who “they” are, or if there is even any truth to it. What I do know, is that what we found down there doesn't belong here. What I have seen, can never be unseen. It has changed me... forever. 

 

The salty cold spray splashed against my face as we pulled the cage over to the dump area.  A mix of The Dropkick Murphys, ACDC and Metallica blared from the deck mounted speakers as the rigging groaned under the weight of the haul. The cage, once in position, was flipped and opened, dumping 300lbs of Alaskan king crab onto the sorting table.  

“Get sorting greenhorn!” Yelled Cobb, the deck boss. Cobb was a big man in his early 40s, he was built like a linebacker and had the disposition of an irritable grizzly. Apart from the captain, he was the oldest, most experienced crabber on the ship. 

I nodded and stepped up to the table to begin digging through the mass of bright red legs and claws. Jimbo, a short wiry man and the only other deckhand on the ship, joined in and we began sorting by size and sex. The females and the undersized crabs are separated to be released back into the sea, while the legal-size males are dropped down a chute to the live well below the deck, where they would be stored until we returned to port.  

Being a crabber was never something I planned on doing. After graduating high school and disappointing my parents by refusing to go to law school like they had always planned, I decided to go traveling. I bummed my way around my home state of Texas for a while before making my way north, and then even farther north. I had originally come to Alaska with a friend who had promised me a career in the oil business. Unfortunately, that had fallen through, as most of his plans did. I found myself broke, jobless, and homeless in a cold and unforgiving climate. I could have called my parents for help, but my pride wouldn't allow it. I had set out to make it on my own and that is exactly what I would do it. I spent the summer working odd jobs here and there but never found anything stable. I was wiping tables at a bar in Unalaska when I met Captain Larsson.  

“You like working here?” He asked as he watched me prepare to clean up a puddle of vomit on the bar floor. His voice was deep and carried a hint of a Scandanavian accent. 

I looked up at him and shrugged, “Not really, but I need the money.” 

He was a tall man with broad shoulders, I guessed he was maybe late 40s to mid 50s. He had a head of shaggy blonde hair streaked with gray and a short beard to match. He nodded, “You look like you can handle hard work” He said looking me over, “I happen to be in need of a deckhand. Ever thought of being a fisherman?” 

I shook my head, “No, but I never planned on doing this either. How's the pay?” 

“Better than you’ll make here.” He said, glancing around the bar room. His eyes fell to the vomit on the floor, “And you won't have to clean any more of that, unless you make it yourself.” 

“Where do I sign up?” I asked.   

He smiled, “Come to the harbor tomorrow morning, we’ll get you sorted.” He finished his beer and headed for the door. 

“Wait.” I called after him, “Which ship is it?” 

With a slight glance back over his shoulder he called back, “The Horven.” 

Weird fucking name. I thought. 

 

“Wake up kid.” Said Jimbo, giving me a shove. “We got 50 more pots to haul in, no time for daydreaming.” 

I nodded and went back to work. The rest of the day went on the same as usual, haul in the pot, dump the catch, sort the crab, stow the pot. Captain Larsson was right; it was hard work, repetitive hard work, and damn was it cold. After four weeks at sea, you’d think I'd be used to the cold. But my warm Texas blood refused to acclimate to the frigid climate. 

“Incoming.” Yelled Cobb. 

The pot was pulled up the side of the ship and swung over to the dumping area. 

“Looks like we got a hitchhiker.” Said Jimbo, as he looked over the pot. 

“A hitchhiker?” I asked, trying to see what he was talking about. 

As the pot was spun, in preparation for dumping the haul, I saw what he was referring to. Clinging to the side of the pot, its tentacles in a writhing mass, was a giant pacific octopus. Hauling up an octopus wasn't exactly uncommon, but they were usually caught inside the crab pots. I hadn't heard of one riding a pot up on the outside, but there it was. It had an unusual color to it as well. I mean, everyone knows that an octopus can change its color, but this seemed different. It was a sickly gray color with odd purple veinlike designs covering its body.  As we approached the pot, I noticed something else. There was something clutched in the grip of the tentacles. 

“What the hell kind of octopus is that?” Asked Jimbo. 

“Biggest one I've seen.” Said Cobb. “Greenhorn, pull it loose and toss it overboard.” 

I nodded and stepped forward, “Hey guys, its holding onto something.” 

“Yeah, the cage.” said Jimbo, “Come on Evans, just get it done.” 

I reached out, preparing to pry the odd colored octopus from the pot. Suddenly it let go and dropped to the deck at my feet. I leapt back in surprise, causing the others to burst into laughter.  

“Shit, I got it.” I said, as I reached down for the limp creature. 

“Is it dead?” Asked Jimbo as he stepped over to look down at it. 

“It doesn't matter.” said Cobb, “Just toss it over already.”  

I tried to lift the huge octopus but kept losing my grip. The thing had to weigh a hundred pounds or more, and its limp slimy texture made it almost impossible to handle. 

“Move over.” Said Cobb, as he bent and hefted the limp creature over his shoulder, “Fucking greenhorn.”  

As he carried the octopus to the starboard edge of the deck, it dropped what it had been holding on to. I walked over and picked up the object, looking it over. It was a large egg-shaped stone, cracked open down the center. I turned it over in my hands, it was lighter than it looked. As I investigated the crack, I noticed it was hollow with jagged purple crystals within it. The crystals seemed to glow with an inner light, a soft, beautiful light. 

“AHH! HELP!” Yelled Cobb. 

I looked up to see the octopus’ tentacles wrapped around Cobb’s torso, its head bobbing around on his shoulder Jimbo and I rushed over and began trying to pull the tentacles free. 

“GET THIS FUCKING THING OFF!” Yelled Cobb, “ITS BITING ME!” 

We tried and tried but we didn't have enough hands, every time we got one tentacle free another took its place. Luckily the captain and Ramirez, the ship’s engineer, had seen the commotion and came running. With their help we managed to pull the creature off of Cobb and tossed it overboard. 

“Ahh!” Groaned Cobb, holding his shoulder.  

Captain Larsson rushed over to him and pulled his coat aside to inspect the wound. There were two large gouges, where the beak had taken out chunks of flesh. 

“Ramirez, Jimbo, get him inside and patch him up.” He turned to look down at the stone as it rolled across the deck. His brow furrowed as he studied it, “Evans, toss that thing overboard.” He said pointing to the stone. 

“What? Why?” I asked. 

The captain gave me a stern, uncompromising glare, “Do as I say, now.” 

I nodded, “Yes, sir.”  

The captain returned to the wheelhouse as the others helped Cobb inside. I walked across the deck and picked up the stone. When I had seen that it was full of crystals, I thought that it might be worth something. Me being broke, I could have used all the extra cash I could get. I glanced up to the wheelhouse and saw the captain watching me, so I made my way over and hesitantly tossed the stone back into the ocean. As I did, I looked back to the wheelhouse, the captain gave me a nod of appreciation. With a slight hesitation, I nodded back. With nothing else to do on the deck, I decided to head inside and see how Cobb was doing. 

“I'm fine.” Said Cobb as Ramirez packed his wound with gauze. 

“I know that.” Said Ramirez, pushing his glasses up on his nose. “But I still want you to stay inside and rest. I can help the boys finish up the haul for the day.” 

Cobb sighed and shook his head, “It's really nothing, the damn thing surprised me more than anything.” 

“No kidding.” Said Jimbo, “I mean, I know they can bite, but who ever heard of an octopus attacking someone like that?” 

Ramirez nodded, “It can happen, usually only if they are threatened. What did you do to it?” 

“No idea?” Said Cobb, “I thought it was dead, one minute it was completely limp. Next thing I know, the thing is squeezing the hell out of me and trying to gnaw my arm off.” 

Ramirez shrugged, “Well, whatever set it off, it took a serious bite out of you, my friend. But you're patched up for now.” 

Cobb started to get up from his seat at the dining table, “Alright, let's get back to it.” 

“No.” Said Ramirez, “We got this, you take it easy for now.” 

Cobb looked from Ramirez to Jimbo, then to me, “What do you say greenhorn? Can you try not to be a fuck up for once?” 

I sighed and nodded, “Yeah, Cobb. I can handle it.” 

“I’ll keep an eye on him.” Said Jimbo. “You just rest that arm.” 

And with that, Jimbo, Ramirez and I headed back out to the deck to continue hauling in the few remaining pots. A few hours later, after the last pot was stowed and the others went inside to the bunkroom to check on Cobb, I decided to head to the wheelhouse. 

 Captain Larsson glanced at me from behind the control panel as I opened the door. He took a puff on his long-stemmed pipe, filling the wheelhouse with the aromatic smoke.  

“Storms coming.” He said, looking back out the front facing window.  

I removed my hood and took a steadying breath, “Captain, I...” I paused. 

“What's on your mind Evans?” He asked, still looking out the window. 

I cleared my throat, “The stone, I was wondering why it bothered you so much? You took one look at it and...” I trailed off, feeling foolish for even bringing it up. 

“I've been a fisherman in one form or another for going on thirty-five years. I've never been married, never had any children, at least that I know of.” he grinned and winked at me. “I've had good seasons and bad seasons. I've seen good men die young and bastards live to old age. I've lost friends and found new ones. And I've done it all out here, on the water. The sea is all I've ever known, and its likely I'll die out here one day. Through it all, there's only one thing I've ever truly trusted.” He turned to face me, “Instinct. A captain has to know when it's time to turn the ship around to avoid a storm, or when to go for one more haul. A captain must trust his instincts, his gut feeling. Because when it's all said and done, it all rests on his shoulders. Do you understand?” 

I nodded but didn't speak. 

“When I looked at that thing,” Said the Captain, “I felt a deep and powerful dread come over me. I don't know what it is or where it came from, but I tell you now boy, there's an evil about it.” 

Thunder rumbled in the distance. 

Just then, the wheelhouse door opened, and Ramirez came in. He was a heavy-set man with a kind face. 

“How's Cobb?” Asked the captain. 

“He’s sleeping.” Said Ramirez, “I was going to change his bandage, but I figured I'd just let him rest.” 

Captain Larsson nodded, “Fine, just make sure you change it first thing in the morning.” 

Ramirez nodded, “Will do.” He turned to me and smiled, “You did good today greenhorn.” 

“Thanks, I'm trying to pull my weight.” I said. 

“You're doing just fine, Cobb only picks on you ‘cause you're new. Next season you’ll be best friends.” Said Ramirez, as he slapped shoulder.  

“If he doesn't kill you first.” said Captain Larsson. 

Ramirez and I laughed. 

After another ten to fifteen minutes of small talk about the season, and what we would be doing when we got back to port, I was getting pretty tired. I told the two of them goodnight and headed for my bunk.  

The bunk room on The Horven was a small, cramped space, consisting of three sets of bunk beds along one wall. Cobb, who usually sleeps on the bunk above Jimbo, had lay down on the spare bunk and was out cold. Jimbo was snoring loudly from his usual spot, which would normally bother me. Tonight however, I was exhausted. Nothing would be keeping me up, or so I thought. As I lay down in my bunk, I heard the boom of thunder in the distance. I listened to the storm in the distance, growing closer and closer. Eventually the rocking of the waves lulled me to sleep, despite the booming thunder, and Jimbos snoring. 

Suddenly I was jarred awake by a heavy metallic thump. I looked at the clock on the wall, it was nearly 1:00, I had only been asleep for about an hour. I climbed out of my bunk and switched on the light to see Cobb lying in the floor, his body shaking violently. 

“Shit! Ramirez, Jimbo, somethings wrong with Cobb!” I shouted shaking them both awake. 

Ramirez jumped out of bed and rushed over, “Fuck!” he exclaimed, “Looks like he's having a seizure.” 

“What's going on?” Asked Jimbo as he sat up in his bunk, rubbing his eyes. 

“Cobbs having a seizure. Go get the captain.” Said Ramirez, “Evans, help me move him.” 

“Oh shit. Okay I'm on it.” Said Jimbo jumping up and rushing to the door. 

I knelt down next to Ramirez, “What do I do?” I asked. 

“Help me move him onto side and grab his pillow. Shit, he’s burning up.” 

After we carefully rolled Cobb onto his side, Ramirez slid the pillow under his head and raised his chin. Cobb continued to seize for around a minute before falling limp. 

“Is he dead?” Jimbo asked from the doorway. 

The captain pushed him aside and knelt down beside Ramirez. 

“No.” Said Ramirez, “He’s unconscious.” 

“Should we move him?” I asked. 

The captain shook his head, “Let's give him a couple minutes, make sure the seizures are over.” 

We all sat in silence for the next few minutes. I think we all hoped that Cobb would just wake up and be fine, but that didn't happen. 

“Okay.” said Ramirez, “I think he's done. Let's get him into his bunk.” 

After lifting Cobb’s limp body into his bunk, Ramirez bent down and examined the wound on his shoulder. 

“Oh shit.” he said, after removing the bandages. 

“What is it?” asked the captain. 

Ramirez stepped back from Cobb's bunk, revealing the wound. The flesh around the bite mark was swollen and discolored. There were dark lines running out in all directions from the wound, which seeped a dark oily substance. 

“My god.” Muttered Jimbo, “Is he gonna be alright?” 

Ramirez shrugged, “Its clearly some kind of infection, but I haven't seen anything like it before.” He turned to the captain. “We need to get him back to port. All we have out here is ibuprofen, he needs a doctor, antibiotics. He needs more than I can do.”  

Ramirez ran his hands through his hair, clearly stressed. Aside from being the engineer, he was the ship medic as well. He took his responsibility of taking care of the ship and the crew very seriously. 

The captain put a hand on his shoulder, “I know you're doing what you can, I can't ask for more than that.”  

Ramirez nodded, “Yes sir.” 

The captain turned to Jimbo and me, “Evans, you stay here with Ramirez and Cobb. Jimbo, to the wheelhouse with me. We’re headed for Dutch Harbor, and I need coffee.”  

And with that Jimbo and the captain left. Ramirez and I sat there in silence for several minutes. Cobb's breathing grew labored as the ship rocked back and forth. Ramirez bent over Cobb and pulled open his mouth. 

“What are you looking for?” I asked. 

He turned to me, “I'm checking to make sure his airway is clear.” 

“I thought swallowing your tongue during a seizure was a myth.” I said. 

“It is, but he could still be choked if he...” Ramirez trailed off. 

“What?” I asked.  

He glanced at me, “Somethings wrong with his tongue.” 

“I thought you just said...” 

“Just shut up and come look at this.” Ramirez said interrupting me. 

I stepped over and looked into Cobb's mouth. Something was definitely wrong. Cobb's tongue was swollen and covered in lines, like scars. 

“What the hell?” I asked, “Were those there before?” 

Ramirez Shook his head, “No, I don't know what this is. The lines are too symmetrical.” 

He was right, the lines ran from the back of Cobbs mouth down to a central point on the tip of his tongue. And his breath, Jesus it was horrible, like rotting fish. 

“Ramirez.” The captains voice called over the intercom, startling us both. “I need you in the wheelhouse.” 

Ramirez looked at me, “Are you good here?”  

I nodded, “Yeah, I think so.” 

“If anything changes, anything at all, you come find me.”  

“Right, I got it.” I said, trying to sound confident. 

Ramirez patted my shoulder and left the bunkroom, leaving me alone with Cobb. The next half hour was pretty uneventful. Cobb slept, his breathing ragged and labored. I sat on the bunk next to him, waiting for someone to come and tell me what was happening. I was beginning to get bored when all of a sudden, Cobb started choking violently. I jumped to my feet and leaned over him, not knowing what to do. He coughed and sputtered, dark saliva flying from his lips.  

“Cobb, Cobb!” I shouted, “Fuck, I'm going to get Ramirez. Just hang on man, he’ll know wat to do.” 

I ran out of the bunkroom and up to the wheelhouse, my heart pounding in my chest. 

“Ramirez!” I shouted as I flung open the door. But he wasn't there. 

“What's wrong?” Asked the captain. 

“It's Cobb! He’s coughing and choking, I don’t know what to do!” I said, my breath coming hard. 

“Shit.” Said the captain before turning to the intercom, “Ramirez, get back to the bunkroom now, Cobb needs help.” 

“Where are they? What's going on?” I asked. 

He turned back to face me, a worried look on his face, “Engine room, something's wrong with the ship. The engine has power, but she won't move. We’re dead in the water.” 

“What do we do?” I asked. 

The captain stood up and threw on his coat, “I’ll head down to the engine room and see what I can do. You head back to the bunkroom; Ramirez may need help.” 

I nodded and we both left the wheelhouse. This whole situation was wrong. Of course, accidents happen. People get hurt or sick, the ship has problems, but... this was something else. I could feel it, like the captain said, instinct. 

I entered the bunkroom to find Ramirez, alone. 

“Where's Cobb?” I asked. 

Ramirez whirled around, “Jesus, Evans. You scared the hell out of me.” He shook his head, “I could ask you the same thing, what happened?” 

“He was here when I went to find you. He started choking on something. I didn't know what to do, there was some stuff he was spitting up, dark stuff.” 

“What kind of dark stuff? Was it blood?” Ramirez asked. 

I shrugged, “I don't know. I don't think so.” I thought for a second, “I think it was black, and had chunks in it or something.” 

Ramirez studied me for a moment, “Whatever it was, we need to find him. He has a fever; he could be delirious.” 

I nodded and we left to tell the captain and Jimbo what was happening. 

 

“Gone?” Jimbo asked, “What do you mean gone? Where could he go?” 

“We’ll find him.” Said Captain Larsson, “Ramirez, you and Jimbo stay here, get my ship moving. Evans and I will search the ship and find Cobb. One of us will come get you when we do.” 

We all agreed, and the captain and I set out to search for our missing crew mate.  

We swept the upper and lower deck, the wheelhouse, the latrine, the dining area and back to the bunkroom. The Horven wasn't a large ship, but still there was no sign of Cobb anywhere. 

“Could he have fallen overboard?” I had to shout the question over the raging storm.  

We had gone back out to check the decks again, thinking that maybe we had missed him among the nearly 200 crab pots. 

“If he has, then he's lost. We’ll make a few more passes before we start thinking that though.” The captain shouted back. 

We started to make our way back inside, when I noticed something. The chute that we used to drop the crab down to the holding tank had a cover on it that usually stays closed when not in use. The cover was pushed to the side, leaving a gaping portal down into the tank. 

“Wait.” I called out, “Captain the hold.” 

The captain turned to see what I had seen. 

“Shit!” He exclaimed, “If he fell down there, he could be seriously injured.” 

We rushed over to the controls for the holding tank's large hydraulic door. The door groaned as it opened. The deck lighting illuminated the inside of the tank as the door opened wider and wider. I feared I would see Cobb's limp and broken body in the tank, being feasted on by thousands of large hungry crabs. But... I was only half right. Cobb was there, his flesh ripped and bleeding from the pinchers and claws of the large crustaceans, but he was still alive. He turned to look up at us, a large crab shell in his hands, his mouth was ragged and torn as he chewed the shell along with the meat.  

“What the fuck?” I exclaimed, stepping back from the door. 

The captain stood his ground, “Mr. Cobb, I need you to come with me. You aren't well.” 

He just stared back, unblinking as the freezing rain pelted his face. Dark blood flowing from dozens of open wounds. All the while, continuing to chew. 

“Cobb!” Shouted the captain, “Get the hell out here now!” He leaned over to me, “Go get Ramirez. Tell him to bring some rope.” 

“Rope?” I asked. 

Captain Larsson met my eyes, “I’ll not have this man loose on my ship.” 

“You think he's dangerous?” I asked. 

“Cobb was dangerous before he went mad. Now, I don't know what to think.” 

I nodded, “Yes sir.” and rushed off to get Ramirez. 

As I ran, I kept seeing Cobbs's face in my head. His face... it just looked wrong, like it didn't fit right anymore. What the hell was happening to him? I didn't think an octopus could even hurt a person, let alone give them some kind of infection. Whatever was happening, I would not be returning for another season on this ship. 

I entered the engine room to see Ramirez scratching his head. 

“We have power, I don't understand what's happening.” He said pacing back and forth. 

“Ramirez.” I called, “We found him.” 

After explaining how we had found Cobb and the state he was in, Ramírez's face went pale, “Madre de Dios.” He muttered. 

Jimbo tried to smile, “You’re joking right? You have to be joking.” 

His smile fell away when he saw the look on my face.  

“Theres more.” I said, “The captain said to bring some rope, he thinks Cobb may be a threat.” 

“What kind of threat?” asked Jimbo. 

I shrugged, “I don't know, but I think he's right.” 

Ramirez nodded, “I agree. If not to us, he’s clearly a danger to himself.” 

And with that the three of us left the engine room and headed for the deck. Ramirez found a large coil of thick nylon rope on the way. It was clear to see that the two of them didn't like the idea of tying up their friend, but what choice did we have? Something was very wrong with Cobb's mind. 

When we stepped out onto the deck, we saw no sign of the captain. We approached the holding tank door, still standing wide open, afraid of what we might find inside. But, apart from a half-eaten crab on the deck, there was no sign of Cobb either. 

“Where are they?” Asked Jimbo. 

“I don't know, dammit! They were both right here!” I shouted in frustration. 

Ramirez put up his hands in a calming motion “We will find them. Let's just stick together and search the ship.” 

We did exactly that, we scoured every inch of the ship and dammit there was no sign of either of them. After the search, the three of us sat down in the wheelhouse. Jimbo had his head in his hands. Ramirez just sat there silently, lost in thought. 

“Guys?” I said breaking the silence, “What do we do?” 

Jimbo took a breath and shook his head, “I don't know man, the captains gone, Cobbs gone. I don't know what's happening, but they are gone. I just want to go home.” 

“Look we don't know if they are gone, maybe we search again?” I suggested. 

“Wake the fuck up man!” Jimbo shouted, “They're gone. Something happened to them, and I don't want it to happen to me!” There were tears in his eyes. “They were my friends, but I won't die out here!” 

Ramirez stood up, “Okay, that's enough!”  

With the captain and Cobb both gone, Ramirez was next in command. Not that Jimbo and I were much to command. “Look, I think you are both right. Evans, I want to find them too. I care a lot about both of them, but I think Jimbo is right, something isn't right here.” He thought for another moment then said, “Whatever happens, the ship still needs fixed, so that's what I'm gonna do. Jimbo, I want you on get on the radio and call for help. We are pretty far out here and I'm not sure we will be able to reach anyone, but we have to try.” He turned to me, “Evans, search the ship for the others. It's possible they fell overboard, but if they are here, find them.”  

I nodded, “If they're here, I'll find them.” 

“And I’ll get to work trying to reach someone on the radio.” Said Jimbo, taking up position at the radio. 

“Alright.” Said Ramirez, “I’ll head below and see if I can figure out what's going on with the ship.” 

With the others tending to their duties, I headed off to search the ship yet again. Only this time, I didn't get far before the shit really hit the fan. 

 

I had just finished checking the dining area and latrine again and was about to head into the bunkroom when I heard Jimbo's voice over the ship intercom. 

“Evans, there's someone on the upper deck.”  

Finally, I thought. I had begun to fear that the missing men had fallen overboard, maybe our luck was turning.  

I stepped onto the deck and peered through the pouring rain, but I couldn't see anyone. I turned back to face the wheelhouse where I could see Jimbo looking out at me. I gave him a shrug. 

“He was at the bow, all the way out. I can't see him now.” said Jimbo, his voice tinny over the intercom. 

I wanted to ask him who was at the bow, I found myself hoping it was the captain and not Cobb. But I figured that at that distance he wouldn't be able to tell anyway. I made my way down the narrow path between the stacks of crab pots to the end of the bow, and still, I didn't see anyone. 

“Shit! Evans, He’s on top of the pots.” Jimbo sounded panicked.  

I looked up just in time to see someone jump across the pots overhead. Whoever it was they were damn fast. I began to feel less like a man searching for his friends and more like prey being stalked by some unknown predator. I turned and started back towards the wheelhouse. 

“Evans!” Jimbo's voice was growing more panicked, “Jesus, he’s...” His vice cut off abruptly.  

The nearest intercom speaker had gone silent, I could still hear Jimbo's voice coming from the speaker further up the deck, but with the storm raging around me I couldn't make it out. 

“Jimbo!” I shouted, fear taking hold of me. 

I ran for the wheelhouse, hearing the rattle of the crab pots above me as the unseen person pursued me. My heart pounded harder and harder with each step. Suddenly, I lost my footing and slipped. The cold hard floor of the ships deck rushed up to meet me. I tried to catch myself, but my hands slid forward on the slick metal. My chin slammed into the floor, splitting open and rattling my entire skull. For a moment, I was too stunned to move. 

When I finally climbed to my knees, I could feel the warm blood flowing from the gash on my chin, but that wasn't all.  I could taste it too, I spat the warm coppery fluid onto the deck and saw a few shattered teeth among the mess. 

“Fuck.” I mumbled painfully. 

I realized, I could hear Jimbo now. His voice racked with fear, “Evans, Ramirez! It's not Cobb anymore! Someone help me!” 

I stood on shaky legs and started toward the wheelhouse. I was still seeing stars, but Jimbo's panic spurred me on. “I'm coming!” I shouted.  

But, when I got to the wheelhouse, it was too late. The door had been smashed in, and Jimbo was gone. 

 “God Dammit!” I shouted in frustration. 

I rushed over to the intercom and called for Ramirez, “Ramirez, where are you? Jimbos gone, someone took him, I think it was Cobb.” 

I waited for Ramirez to come to the wheelhouse, praying I wasn't alone now. But he never came. 

After another ten minutes of calling for help, from Ramirez, the coast guard, God, anyone who would listen. I decided to head for the engine room, maybe he was still there, maybe the intercom was busted. I didn't know what to do, I just couldn't stay there. Before leaving the wheelhouse, I took the fire axe from its glass compartment. Whoever took Jimbo, even if it was Cobb, they wouldn't get me without a fight.  

I started down the stairs, axe in hand. I'm not a very big man, and the axe felt heavy in my hands, but I’d swing it for all I was worth if I had to. As I was about to enter the engine room, I felt a presence behind me. I froze, my grip tightening on the axe handle, but I wasn't fast enough. A pair of strong hands latched onto me from behind. One of them wrapping around and pinning the axe to my chest, the other clamped over my mouth stifling a scream. I squirmed and fought but couldn't break loose. 

“Calm yourself boy.” Came a hushed voice, “we may yet get out of this.” 

I calmed and he released me. When I turned around, I saw the last person I expected to see, “Captain Larsson.” I exhaled feeling a sense of relief, I wasn't alone. 

“Where have you been?” I asked, “We thought you fell overboard.” 

“I did.” He said in a shaky voice, “Cobb came after me like a mad man, swinging wildly. I tried to fight him off, but he was too strong, too primal. I ran, tried to get away, but the bastard chased me. His teeth chattering like he wanted to take a chunk out of me. I tried to make it back to the wheelhouse, but he tackled me over the side. I must have hit my head because I woke up hanging off the side of the ship, my leg tangled in the rigging and soaked to the bone.” 

“God, Jimbo was right.” I muttered. 

The captain nodded, “Whatever happened to him, he’s changed. When I finally managed to pull myself back aboard, I saw him. He’s not human anymore.” 

“What do you mean?” I asked. “And how did he get back on board?”  

“I don't know how he got aboard. But I saw him break down the door to the wheelhouse, I tried to get there but my numb fingers couldn't move fast enough to get the rope untangled from my leg.” His head dropped as he spoke, clearly disappointed that he couldn't protect a member of his crew. 

I looked him over; he was absolutely drenched and shivering violently. I was amazed he was alive, let alone on his feet. 

“I tried to get there too, but I fell. We tried radioing for help, but I don't think anyone heard us. And I don't know where Ramirez is, I was on my way to the engine room when you found me.” I explained. 

The captain nodded, motioning for me to give him the axe. "Good man. I’ll take the lead from here; you just stay close. I won't lose anyone else tonight.”  

I didn't argue. I handed over the axe and fell in behind him. I was just glad I didn't have to face whatever was going alone. 

As we approached the engine room door, the captain ducked low and motioned for me to do the same. He carefully turned the handle and pushed the door open, being as quiet as the squealing hinges would allow. We stepped inside and were greeted with a scene straight out of a nightmare.  

Cobb was there, but Jimbo and the captain were right, he wasn't Cobb anymore. His back was to us, but I could see enough. His hair had mostly fallen out, his head swollen and misshapen. His arms had lengthened, nearly to below his knees and his flesh was the color of a rotting corpse. 

Jimbo and Ramirez were there too. Their bodies wrapped up in a mass of black slime-like webbing that covered the walls of the engine room, like massive, bloated flies in a spider's web. I could see chunks of flesh missing from Ramirez's body, yet somehow, he was still alive. Jimbo squirmed and fought against the webbing when he saw us, his eyes pleading for mercy. 

We watched on in horror as Cobb stepped to the back of the room and knelt down, bowing his head in supplication as the octopus climbed out from the shadows behind the ship's engine. The creature had grown massive since the last time we saw it; its size dominated the engine room. 

“Holy shit. Is that...” 

“Yes.” breathed the captain. 

“It can't be.” I whispered, “Its huge.” 

“It is.” 

 The creature crawled over to the black webbing where Jimbo had been cocooned. 

“Jesus!” I gasped, “Its eating them alive.” 

 But before it could start in on its fresh meal the captain stood and began shouting and banging the axe against the wall. 

“Leave them alone, you bastards!” He shouted, before turning to face me. “Go to the wheelhouse, get the life raft and get away from this place.” 

“What? No, I'm not leaving you here.”  

“I won't leave my men to suffer. Now go!” 

Cobb had turned to face us. He looked even more terrifying now, dead skin hung loose on his face and his eyes bulged from their sockets.  

“Damn you boy, go now!” Yelled the captain, “I’ll hold them off.” 

He gave me a shove out of the engine room, then slammed the door behind him. With no other option in sight, I ran. I ran as fast as I could to the wheelhouse and found the inflatable life raft. I was about to leave the wheelhouse when the radio crackled.

"Horven. This is the cargo ship Weston. We are always out from you yet, but we are coming. You men just hold on." 

I snatched up the radio transmitter to respond, "Weston. This is The Horven, please hurry. I don't know how much longer we can last." 

But there was no response, only static. I tried a few more times but still got nothing. I made my way out onto the deck, then hesitated. Could I really leave the captain and the others here? The life raft had a distress beacon on it, I was sure that the Weston would see it, even through the storm. Maybe I could find a weapon and help the captain fight them. Yes, I thought. I would help the captain; we would save the others.  

I began looking around for something, anything I could use as a weapon, then I heard it. A wet, broken, gargled voice from behind me.  

“G... Gr...Grreeeennhorn.” 

I turned to see Cobb, standing at the top of the stairway. He had a large gash across his chest and shoulder, which oozed dark purple. I think he tried to smile, but the loose flesh didn't move with whatever was underneath. 

“Oh God.” I breathed. 

“N... Not y...yett.” Said Cobb, in his grotesque voice. 

He lunged for me. I tried to back away, but I slipped again. I fell hard onto my back, kicking out at Cobb. My foot made contact with his face and knocked more flesh loose, he hissed and sputtered as I continued kicking but I couldn't get him off of me. His long arms reached out and clamped onto my shoulders, pulling my face closer to his. I punched him as hard as I could, causing him to grunt in pain but he never slowed. In a last effort I reached out and took hold of the loose skin on his face. With a mighty heave, I ripped it away, causing him to howl in pain and me to shriek in terror. Underneath the dead skin was mottled gray flesh lined with purple veins, just like the octopus. He was left with a gaunt featureless face under a swollen and bulbous head.  

I screamed and screamed as his mouth opened, what was once his tongue was now a writhing mass of tentacles which reached out and wrapped around the back of my head, pulling me closer and closer to certain death. I fought and fought but could do nothing but watch as inch by inch my head would be pulled into Cobbs waiting jaws.  

Suddenly there came a wet thwack sound. The tentacles around my head tensed once more before falling limp along with the rest of Cobbs body. I scrambled back away from him to see the fire axe buried in his head. 

“Why the hell are you still here?” Asked Captain Larsson.  

I jumped to my feet, “The others?” I asked. 

The captain shook his head, “Nothing to be done. Get the raft inflated, now. It's coming.”  

I grabbed the life raft and pulled the cord, the raft self-inflated in a sudden whoosh of air. 

"There's a ship on the way. The Weston, they said they were still a ways out but they are coming." I told him. 

"Good. Let's get the raft in the water. That thing will be here any second." 

“Wait.” I said, “Can't it just follow us into the water?”  

The captain smiled. “There is no us boy, I'm staying.” 

“Are you crazy? You can't stay here.” I said. 

He looked out to sea for a moment, “Did I ever tell you the meaning of the ships name?” 

“The Horven?” I asked, “Its Scandinavian, right?” 

He nodded, “Thats right. Back in Norway, my grandfather would always tell me tales of the old myths and legends. Tales of hero's and monsters. The horven was always his favorite, mine too I suppose. But the horven has another name.” 

“What name?” I asked. 

 “Kraken.” 

I shook my head in disbelief, “No. That's just a story...” 

He put his hand on my shoulder silencing me, “Maybe it is just a story. Or maybe, by naming my ship after the beast, I cursed us all. Either way, it's here and I’ll not leave while it lives.” 

“But...” 

“No, Evans. My mind is made up. Take the raft and go. If I kill the beast, I'll have avenged my crew. If it kills me, well, I’d like to think that at least someone made it out alive.” 

I studied his expression, “You don't think you can beat it, do you?” 

He looked down at his leg, blood pouring from an open wound and shrugged, “I'll give it hell all the same, maybe keep it busy long enough for...” 

Just then something wrapped around my ankle and began pulling me across the deck. I looked to see the huge octopus climbing its way to the top of the stairs from the engine room below. I screamed in pain and fear. The tentacle gripped my leg so hard; I thought it would crush the bone. Captain Larsson rushed forward and with a swift chop, severed the tentacle. We rushed to the life raft and tossed it into the sea below. I held the rope tight, keeping the raft from drifting away. 

“Captain, I can stay, I can help.” I said. 

He smiled warmly and put his hand on my shoulder, “Live a good life, son.” And with that he shoved me backwards off of the ship and into the waiting lifeboat below. 

The waves quickly pulled my raft out to sea, away from The Horven. I managed to get one last glimpse of Captain Larsson, before the waves took me away. A flash of lightning lit the scene as he swung the axe amidst the flailing tentacles, again and again. He screamed in rage as blood flew from the massive creature, and then I was carried away. 

 

I was only at sea for a few hours before the cargo ship Weston came along. Their captain had heard our distress call and came looking for us in our last known location. After getting me some dry clothes and a blanket, they asked if there had been any other survivors. I thought about Jimbo and Ramirez, if they were alive, they were probably infected with whatever changed Cobb. I thought about the captain, I hoped he had survived, but didn't think he had. If he didn't manage to kill the creature, he’d be in the same shape as the other two. 

“No.” I said after a while. “There was no one else.”
