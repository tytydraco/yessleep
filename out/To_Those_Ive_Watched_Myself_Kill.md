You know, for as much hate everyone has to give it, I love stormy weather.  
  
Pouring rain and seething wind tend to keep people inside, and the lightning scares off those who don’t mind getting wet. A few cars here and there sure, but they hide the faces of their passengers, and the danger usually keeps most of them off the streets anyways. A clear, quiet road gives me the perfect opportunity to walk down the center, far from the sidewalks, and the water hides the tears. I rarely go outside, but on days like these I can hardly stand to miss the chance to.  
  
“Why does that man have to be doing his yard work right now?”  
  
I try to run but my legs aren’t nearly as fast as my thoughts are. A version of me standing next to the stranger, knife in hand, threatens his life as he begs for mercy.  
I slit his throat with no remorse.  
  
My eyes well up and briefly blur my vision, enough for me to make my escape.  
  
I don’t remember exactly when it started, but I’ve been having these visions for as long as I can remember. A kid playing with his toys gets beaten half to death. A girl running to catch the late bus struggles as my hands wrap around her throat. A man setting up a picnic gets shot in the head. Mirrors of myself, against my despondent pleas, massacre innocent people before they disappear and leave me reeling from events that never occurred. It used to be manageable, but now I see them everywhere. Lining the streets with blood while fueled by rage that’s not my own.  
  
My breathing settles as my heart calms down. Thank god no one was there to notice.  
  
As much as I try to keep these thoughts to myself, my emotions still get the best of me. As much as I’m forced to, I can’t bear to see people get hurt, and some of the more gruesome murders make me throw up. It’s been a long time since I’ve tried to ignore these thoughts, because fighting them usually makes them stronger. But even still, I force myself to walk. To talk. To make some sort of effort to function in society and desperately cling on to the idea of a normal life.  
  
An old lady makes her way across the street. I don’t even pay attention when I push her in front of the truck.  
  
I know you won’t believe me, but I’ve never held any intention of hurting anyone in my entire life. I couldn’t kill the spiders that nearly gave me a heart attack as a kid. The last thing I’ve ever wanted to do was lay a hand on anyone who’s walked this earth, but despite yearning to see the beauty of a peaceful day, I’m my own worst enemy. I know my thoughts will never let me be.  
  
A boy running to catch up with his sister falls over. I stand, towering over him as my foot hovers over his head and he braces for impact.  
  
Nope, that was it. Not even a flood could hide me as I crumble to pieces in the middle of the road. The look of a concerned passerby stares while the sounds of the blaring car horns try to force themselves into my already screaming head. I sprint off as fast as I can muster while my mind runs a loop of the worst moments of my life.  
  
You know I can still see the scars? Right? As much as it drives me insane to let you know, I still remember the beatings, the fear, the hatred, and the pain. The overwhelming helplessness as you made sure I’m aware that you hold all the power. That you’re so strong and I’m so weak. That no matter what I did or how much I tried to keep you off your edge, that you had the ability, no, THE RIGHT to do whatever your blackened heart desired. That no matter the bruises, the broken bones or even the lost teeth, I had deserved it, cause how could I disobey the one who made me?  
  
“She's been dead for how many years yet she refuses to die”   
  
I don’t particularly enjoy the memory of the day you died. You had been drinking, like usual, and you were letting your hands tell me all about how bad your day was. Unfortunately for me, you got a little too carried away, didn’t you? Maybe the pool of blood must've struck a nerve, but for once you might've thought you had taken it too far. Hit my head a little too hard. You hesitated, and for a brief moment, I saw my life flash before my eyes. Maybe it was the adrenaline talking, or maybe I couldn’t get enough oxygen in my brain, but for whatever reason, I happened to notice that you were standing quite close to the end of the balcony, noticed no one was passing by. Noticed that for the first time in my life, I was no longer in control of myself, and merely watched myself push you off that god forsaken ledge.   
  
Everyone believed my side of the story. They never really liked you, did they? Maybe they knew the truth, but thought you deserved it. It was never really a secret what you did behind closed doors. Yet for all you did and all the ways you made me suffer, I’ve never gotten over the guilt, and you’ve never let me hear the end of it. That for a single, fleeting moment, you broke me. You got me to give up my humanity, even if it was to save myself.  
  
The door hushes the screaming gale as it closes behind me. The floorboards creak as I walk past the broken T.V. Even faces on screens trigger me now. My room is cold and dark, yet oddly comforting. The bed eases me into my nightmares and I spend the next twelve hours of my life reliving the past. I contemplate ripping my eyes out. Days go by without me realizing and I ignore my starving body pleading for food.  
  
For as much as it’s hell to stay awake, and as much as it breaks me to witness the death of those still alive, I can’t bring myself to quit. I can’t bring myself to let you win. For I know that all the horrors I witness are not my own, that your darkest desires are not mine, and that they’ll never be realized. That no matter how many times you try to make me snap, I’ll never lash out. You’ll never satisfy your anger ever again.  
  
I smile, knowing my hands are not your own.
