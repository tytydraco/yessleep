Sanya wasn’t the type to overthink things. She was practical, grounded, and not exactly the kind of person who would lose sleep over some weird dream. So when the strange dreams first started—the ones where she felt someone lightly pushing her while she slept—she did what any reasonable adult would do: she ignored it.

“It’s probably just stress,” she told herself. "Or maybe I had too much caffeine." I mean, who hasn’t had a dream about being gently shoved by some invisible force? People dream about all sorts of things, right? Like showing up to work without pants or finding out your dog can suddenly talk. Totally normal.

But then it kept happening. Every night. The same thing: a push. Not a punch or a slap or anything exciting. Just a gentle, irritating nudge. Like someone was standing next to her bed, tapping her shoulder and saying, “Hey, hey, wake up! Just kidding, go back to sleep.”

Naturally, she ignored that too. “It’s just my brain being weird,” she thought. “Brains do that.” She was great at rationalizing things. That’s what normal people did. Especially when the alternative was, you know, actually considering the possibility that something supernatural was trying to mess with her.

But then the pushing started to get… more demanding. It wasn’t violent. Just… persistent. Like a needy cat at 3:00 AM pawing at your face. Whatever was doing the pushing wasn’t going to give up until it got whatever it wanted. 

Still, Sanya ignored it. She was on a roll now. This was what sane people did: ignore their problems and hope they went away. 

Except there was this other thing. The feeling that someone was staring at her. Not just casually glancing her way—no, this was full-on, burning-a-hole-into-the-back-of-your-head kind of staring. At first, she thought it was just paranoia. “Get a grip, Sanya,” she told herself. “You’re not that interesting. Who would be watching you?”

But then, it didn’t go away. It followed her. Everywhere. Like a really clingy ex-boyfriend or that one co-worker who keeps showing up uninvited to lunch. The pushing at night. The staring during the day. It was getting ridiculous.

Still, she ignored it. Why stop now? She was practically a champion of denial at this point.

Until one night, when the gentle push turned into a shove, and the staring felt like someone was trying to laser-eye her brain out of her skull. She woke up gasping for air, drenched in sweat, her heart pounding so loud she was pretty sure the neighbors could hear it. She glanced at the clock. 3:00 AM. Because of course it was 3:00 AM. When else would creepy stuff happen?

“Alright, fine!” she muttered into the darkness, more annoyed than anything. “What do you want?”

The silence that followed was louder than any answer could have been. Classic. And then, just as she was about to roll her eyes and go back to sleep, she felt it—a cold breath on the back of her neck.

Her whole body froze. “Nope,” she thought, with the clarity of someone who had officially had enough of this nonsense. “Nope, nope, nope.”

Without even looking behind her, Sanya grabbed her pillow, blanket, and phone and marched straight out of her room. She didn’t care if there was some creepy ghost thing waiting to give her a jump scare. She was done. If this invisible shover wanted her bed, it could have it.

Sanya settled on the couch in the living room, bundled up in her blanket, and popped in her earbuds. 

The next morning, she woke up to sunlight streaming through the windows. No pushing, no staring, no creepy breath on her neck. She stretched and smiled. Maybe whatever was haunting her had finally gotten bored and left.

Then she saw it.

A note, scrawled in messy handwriting on the coffee table: "You ignored me for weeks. That was rude. But thanks for the bed. It's much cozier. See you tonight."
