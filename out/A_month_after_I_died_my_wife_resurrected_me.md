That’s only the cherry on top of the terrifying situation in which I find myself.

This story isn’t about me. It’s about my wife. It’s about the price she had to pay to resurrect me.

This year, on November 1st, I died. There was a car collision. I actually remember it. It is, perhaps, the most vivid memory of my entire life. There’s almost nothing on this earth quite as terrifying as remembering your own death. Almost.

When I woke on December 1st, I was in my bed. What do I remember from November? Nothing. I ceased to exist, and then I existed again. I don’t remember an afterlife. That, in itself, was enough to break my mind. Maybe souls exist, or maybe they don’t. I have no idea. I only know that it took a psychological toll to suddenly find my soul (or whatever you might call my ‘essence’) had returned to its body. In addition, my body had surprisingly not decomposed.

Anyway, I’m getting side-tracked. That isn’t the story I need to tell.

“Robert?”

My wife’s sweet voice was the first thing I heard. I tentatively opened my eyes to see her kneeling beside our bed, clutching my hand in hers.

“Emily?” I wheezily croaked. “I… I…”

“Good morning, my love,” She sobbed, leaning in to kiss me repeatedly.

“How?” I whispered.

That was all I could muster. What else was there to say? I don’t think Emily had expected me to remember my death. She seemed apprehended by my question, but she quickly composed herself.

“It wasn’t your time,” She feebly responded. “I saved you.”

“Emily…” I said. “I died. I remember dying.“

“No, you…” Emily fumbled for a lie. “You were hanging by a thread, and-“

“- You’re lying, Emily,” I interjected. “I stopped existing. There was nothing. I know I died. I felt it. And something tells that a lot of time has passed, so how am I alive?”

Emily’s lip quivered, and she looked away from me. I stared at her, awaiting an answer. I’m not sure how long we spent in that state of silence.

“What is today’s date?” I asked.

Emily finally looked up at me, face covered in tears.

“December 1st,” She whispered.

“December 1st?!” I yelled, incredulously. “I don’t… That doesn’t… How can that be? A month? A whole month? What did you do, Emily? How am I back on earth? How is my body in one piece?”

Emily wiped away her tears, leaning forwards and resting on my chest.

“I found a way to undo what happened,” She finally replied.

My wife wouldn’t tell me more than that. She left me to, as she put it, ‘wrap my head around things’. I spent hours staring at the wall, contemplating what Emily might have done, but I’m not an imaginative man. I couldn’t possibly have managed to conceive the horrors that had unfolded in order to return me to the land of the living.

When I eventually made my way downstairs, after showering and getting dressed, my wife was sitting on the sofa. She smiled and pointed at a pizza box on the coffee table. It was from my favourite takeaway.

“Robby,” Emily said, trying to stifle tears. “I know you’re scared. I’m scared. But I can’t tell you how I brought you back, okay? I just… I just need you to understand. After you died, I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t… see a way forwards without you. So, I found a way forwards… with you.”

I wanted to say something, but my heart melted at the sight of my beautiful wife, the pizza box on the table, and our favourite film ready to play on the TV. You see, I had come to terms with the concept of death, but I was intoxicated once more by the allure of life and love. Even though I hadn’t existed for the past month, I had missed Emily. I had missed life. I decided that maybe I didn’t need to know ‘how’ I had returned.

That first night was perfect. I didn’t even notice the small details that would later concern me.

The next day, as I was eating breakfast, I came down from the high of the previous night.

“What about my parents? Your parents? Our friends?” I asked. “I can’t hide in here forever. How will we explain this to them?”

“I haven’t figured that out yet,” Emily sheepishly admitted.

And that was when I first noticed it. I noticed the slight paleness of my wife’s face.

“Are you unwell?” I asked. “You should eat something.”

“I’m fine,” Emily assured me.

“I haven’t seen you eat anything since yesterday,” I said. “What’s wrong with you?”

“I’m fine, Robby,” Emily reiterated. “I’m… used to not eating. Grief will do that to you.”

I wasn’t entirely convinced, but it seemed like a reasonable explanation. I felt guilty. She’d spent a month carrying the burden of losing me. I had the luxury of simply ceasing to exist.

That night, however, I woke at 2am to the sound of a car starting. I looked out of the window and saw Emily drive away. She returned an hour later and silently crept back into bed. I pretended to be asleep. It seemed a better idea to discuss things when we’d woken up.

“Where did you go?” I asked.

Yet again, Emily was not eating breakfast, and she looked even paler than the night before.

“We needed milk,” My wife replied.

“At 2am?” I scoffed.

“From the petrol station,” She explained. “It’s a 24-hour shop.”

“The milk could’ve waited,” I replied.

Emily was lying. There was absolutely no doubt about that. What was she hiding?

Suspecting that my wife might repeat her early morning trip, I had the idea to plant my iPad on her backseat and track it from my phone.

I was correct. A little after midnight, when Emily started her car, I tiptoed downstairs, waited for her to pull away, and slipped onto the driveway. I started up my car and tracked her at a safe distance. She did not travel far. In fact, when she drove into the centre of the city, I thought, for a painful second, that she might have been telling the truth. I felt like a terrible husband for doubting her.

But she did not park at the petrol station. My app showed that she had parked near a nightclub. My wife hates nightclubs. She hates staying up past 9pm. Even if we were to ignore the fact that I died and came back to life, this still would’ve been a suspicious situation. That being said, my mind never, for a moment, leapt to the concept of an affair. I felt she had proven her love by, well, resurrecting me.

I parked a few streets away from her and travelled on foot, tracking my iPad’s location. I found her Ford Focus in a deserted car park, but I couldn’t see her. So, I hid in the bushes and waited in the dark.

The lights and noise of the city had been comforting, but this empty car park, lit by a solitary lamppost, was eerily dark and silent. There was something unnatural about the car park. It was shrouded in a thick mist.

Emily emerged from a back alley with a young, handsome man. I assume she found him at the nightclub. I was nauseated. He leaned in to give my wife a kiss, but she shoved him back. I was on the precipice of leaping from the bush and revealing my location, but something petrifying happened.

My wife changed. Her pupils vanished, and her eyes turned black. With vice-like strength, Emily clutched either side of the man’s horrified face and squeezed. I don’t know how to describe what I saw, but I will try. It has plagued my dreams for the past week.

The high-pitched scream that emanated from the man’s mouth was the most haunting sound I have ever heard. His arms and legs flailed helplessly as his body began to shrivel away. His flesh sagged, clinging tighter and tighter to the ghastly outline of his skeleton with every passing moment. It was as if I had seen the young man age a lifetime in mere seconds.

Emily released what was left of his face, and her eyes returned to normal, though her flesh was just as pale. The worst thing is that her victim, for some reason I do not fully understand, had not yet perished. He lay on the cold tarmac of the car park, futilely gasping for air with his wheezy, deflated lungs. His fragile skin was barely able to stretch across his bones. I believe I even saw the outline of his heart beating beneath his shirt. That macabre image seems to be permanently etched onto my eyeballs.

The man’s face was a nightmarish apparition. It was no more than a skull coated in papery flesh. His eyes were glazed over. If they were the window to his soul, then his soul had most certainly been absorbed by my wife.

His arms and legs were broken and twisted in ways that I can only imagine must have been agonising. Eventually, the man’s incessant writhing ceased. With unnatural ease, my wife carried his corpse to her vehicle, dumped the crumpled mess into the trunk, and drove away.

I didn’t go home. I’ve been living in my car. Whatever my wife did to resurrect me, it exacted a vile toll. I’ve conducted online research, but I can’t find anything on the subject. I assume she feeds on the essence of others to sustain herself.

Should I go home? I can’t run and hide for the rest of my life. I think I have to stop her.
