I’ve been having this weird dream lately…

It was hazy at first, flashes of images that fade upon waking, but it’s become clearer in the last week. It feels more real, like a memory more than a dream. Sometimes I wonder if I’m even dreaming at all.

It starts with the town.

I’ve never been there before, but I know the way. I arrive on a rainy day, and I know that I’m looking for someone. I don’t know who she is, but in the dream, I know that I know her, and I know that she’s here, in this town, somewhere.

I go to a motel. The sign is bright, red letters flashing VACANCY in the hazy rain. The parking lot is empty, and I run from my car to escape the downpour. I get soaked anyway.

The worker looks at me strangely. Like he’s been expecting me, but also like he’s surprised I’m here. He checks me into a room, and my search begins.

I spend five days in this town, and the rain doesn’t stop.

On the first day, I walk the main street with a photo of the woman I seek. I ask everyone who will look at me, have they seen her? Do you know where she is? They turn their eyes away, refuse to answer. Some don’t care to look, others refuse to. They know, and I know that they know, but I can do nothing about it.

That night, I find someone standing outside my room. They’re staring up at the dark sky, the rain trailing down their face. When they catch me looking, their expression remains even. “You can’t see it yet. But you will.” They leave before I can ask what it means.

On the second day, I find a church. The doors are open, but no one is there. It’s damp and cold, no warmth or comfort here. The rain batters the stained-glass windows, depicting images of women crying into their hands. A wet trail leads to the altar, still soaked with rainwater. When I leave, I turn to look one last time. A figure stands at the altar, and the doors close behind me.

That night, I find a pamphlet about the lake. I didn’t know there was a lake until now, but it’s always been there.

On the third day, I go to the lake. It sits at the end on a winding trail, a basin around which the town is built. There are docks, but no boats, and through the haze of rainfall, I can’t see the other end. The sound of the rain is loudest here, battering the lake and tearing through the trees. In that noise, I think I can hear the sound of crying.

That night, the motel clerk watches me from the office as I return to my room.

On the fourth day, I see the lighthouse. It stands on a cliff above the town, abandoned. I climb the steps to the top, listening to the rain screaming outside. At the highest point, I look out at the town below, a blur in the haze. I stay here until it’s dark, and before I leave, I look up. I still can’t see it, but when I reach my hand upwards, I swear it brushes something wet and wiry.

The dream takes me away before I learn what it is.

On the final day, I don’t leave my room. Despair has crept in like the rain soaking through everything I own, filling my like water filling a bottle. I won’t find her, I think. She's gone forever. I came for nothing, and I will leave with nothing. When the sun sets, I step outside into the rain, and I look up one last time.

I find her.

The woman sits in the sky, a titan looming above the town like a monolith. Long black hair hangs down from her colossal head, the ends wet and wiry. The sound of her sobbing is loud in my ears, now that I see her, louder even than the downpour. Hands cover her face, and through her fingers, tears fall like rain.

Someone catches me looking. My expression remains even when I say the words.

“You can’t see it yet. But you will.”

That’s where the dream ends. Every time, on the last word, that's when I wake up.

“You can’t see it yet. But you will.”

“You can’t see it yet. But you will.”

“You can’t see it yet. But you—”

The phone call wakes me early. My ex-wife has gone missing. Outside, the rain starts to fall.

They can’t find her. But I will.
