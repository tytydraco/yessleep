A guy walked into my retro gaming shop, carrying a small cardboard box. “Got some of my brother’s Nintendo 64 games to sell,” he said.

“I’m excited to see them. Just got a quick question for you. I’m not accusing you of being a thief or anything, but for legal reasons, I’m required to ask—do you have your brother’s permission to sell his games?”

“Uh…he actually disappeared over twenty years ago. He’s been declared legally dead, his old games were just sitting around in the basement. My parents said that I could sell them.”

“I’m really sorry,” I said. I couldn’t help but wonder if he was making the whole thing up. I had become jaded over the years. You wouldn’t believe the sob stories people come in with to try to get more money. There was this one woman who came in nearly every year, attempting to sell some worthless PC games, telling me that her baby had died and that she was trying to pay for a funeral. Either she was the unluckiest woman alive or an unimaginative liar.

“I appreciate that,” he said as he started unloading the box. He had a nice collection: *Super Mario, Mario Kart, Donkey Kong, Mario Tennis, Zelda: Ocarina of Time, GoldenEye 007, NFL Blitz, Madden NFL 2000, Army Men: Sarge’s Heroes, Tony Hawk’s ProSkater 2*. Nearly all of them came with their boxes and manuals, which made them much more valuable.

Then he pulled out a loose, emerald-green cartridge from the bottom of his box. I heard that Nintendo had offered emerald-green cartridges to publishers but was almost positive that no one had ever chosen that color.

After looking at the label, I was even more confused. It was titled *Desert War*. 388 N64 games had been produced; I hadn’t played all of them, but I can tell you with 100% accuracy if a given title was an actual game. I was certain there was never a game called *Desert War*.

I looked at the label closely, which depicted two soldiers in WWII-era uniforms facing off in a desert landscape. It looked legit—there was the ESRB rating in the lower left-hand corner (T for teen), the Nintendo logo, and the official Nintendo seal of quality. The only thing strange was the publisher’s name: Sceletorum Games. I had never heard of them before.

I turned the cartridge over and examined its back—everything checked out. I decided to Google it, wondering if I could have somehow forgotten about the game. No results. The game simply did not exist. But somehow, I had it in front of me.

“You remember where your brother got this?” I asked. I thought this might be an elaborate hoax, that the guy was going to tell me that this was a one-of-a-kind game worth thousands.

He shrugged. “Can’t tell you, think he did most of his shopping at GameStop.”

“Do you remember playing it with him?”

“I don’t, actually. Don’t remember ever seeing him play it. He must have got it shortly before he disappeared.”

“It’s very strange. I can’t find any mention of it online. I can do more research on it, ask some friends who might know about it, and make you an offer in a few days.”

“I’ll take 20 bucks for it. I live rather far away, so it’s probably not worth my time coming back here.”

I accepted his offer, telling him that on the off-chance the cartridge turned out to be valuable, I’d share the profits with him. I’d been in this business for twelve years, and this was the strangest thing that had come through my doors.

\*\*\*

After paying him, I headed to my office, inserted the cartridge in my old N64, and turned it on. There was no splash screen, no menu. Wasn’t prompted to press start. Instead, I was popped directly into a desert. I was by a small oasis, surrounded by sand dunes. Reminded me a bit of Shifting Sand Land from *Super Mario 64,* but the graphics in this game were way worse. Probably on par with those of the 1992 DOS game, *Wolfenstein 3D*.

I wasn’t controlling a soldier, but a teenager dressed in a black t-shirt, cargo shorts, and a backwards baseball cap. There wasn’t much to do in this world—couldn’t scale the dunes, climb the palm trees, or even go swimming in the oasis. The controls were limited—I could jump using the A button, but couldn’t punch or even crouch. As I was walking by the water, a skeletal hand reached out and dragged me under.

There was a cutscene of the kid falling through murky water. Suddenly, the screen turned black. I thought the game had crashed, but a few seconds later it came back on. I was in some cave. Before me was an enormous skeleton wearing a green wizard’s hat decorated with stars and crescents. There was a slingshot nearby, and I tried to move over to it, but my character wasn’t responding to the analog stick. No matter what button I pressed, nothing happened. *Must be another cut scene.*

The skeleton slowly walked over to the kid, grabbed him, lifted him up, and bit his head off, a fountain of pixelated blood spewing from his neck.

Another cut scene. This one just of the skeleton’s white face against a black background, laughing maniacally. I tried pressing every button, but nothing happened, he just kept laughing. After waiting for five minutes, I restarted the console. I expected to be back in the desert, but instead the laughing skull was back on screen. I turned it off.

I thought I knew what this game was. It was some gag gift that some studio put out. They probably made fifty or so of these cartridges for the employees to give to their friends and family. They’d think they would be the first to play some exciting shooter, but instead they got to be eaten by a skeleton.

*This could be valuable. Very valuable*. I just needed to uncover the story. I sent emails to some of my friends who had worked for Nintendo and several other major studios. I was certain that one of them would know the story behind this cartridge.

\*\*\*

Before I went to bed that night, I checked my email. To my surprise, no one had any information about the game. I decided that tomorrow, I would unscrew the cartridge and look at the printed circuit board. My new theory was that it was created by a hobbyist. In that case, its PCB would look very different than an actual game’s PCB. The Nintendo 64 wasn’t a very developer-friendly console, but it is possible—not cheap, not easy, but possible—for someone to create a homebrew game. I wondered why someone would go to the expense for such a crappy game, but some people are crazy.

In my sleep, I returned to the landscape from *Desert War*. But it didn’t look like an N64 game. I could see each individual grain of sand and feel the wind in my face.

As I was trying to climb one of the dunes, a skeletal hand emerged from the sand and pulled me under.

The next thing I remember was being in the skeleton’s lair. He was standing about ten feet away from me, wearing the embroidered sorcerer’s hat. He was not some pixelly character from a 90s game, but appeared lifelike (well, as lifelike as a skeleton can look). He began making his way slowly over to me, blood dripping from his mouth.

Unlike in the game, I could move. I ran over and picked up the slingshot. There were three small pebbles by it. I shot one at his face. Just missed. Reloaded and fired another. It hit the skeleton in his chin, but he didn’t even slow down. I aimed the last one at his hat. When he was swooping down to pick me up, I fired. It was a direct hit.

Next there was an 8-bit cutscene, like something from an 80s arcade game. The skeleton was chasing his hat through the cave. “Congratulations,” the screen flashed as virtual confetti fell. “You have completed the first level.”

I woke up, trembling and soaked in sweat. *God*, I thought, *that was a weird ass dream*. You’d think that someone who worked in my line of work would often dream that they were in video games, but I didn’t. In fact, that was the only video game-related dream I remembered.

\*\*\*

I  headed into the shop around noon. My colleague, José, was already there when I arrived, staring intently at his laptop.

“You’ve seen the news?” he asked. “Some jogger found the body of a kid at Lake Laurel at like 4 this morning.”

I shook my head.

“It’s crazy. She found a skull in one section, and when the cops showed up, they found the rest of his skeleton like 30 feet away. There’s some speculation that it’s the body of Jason Statler, he was a 14-year-old kid who disappeared from his bedroom in 2002, less than a mile away from the lake. You remember when that all went down?”

“I don’t, didn’t move here till ’06.”

“It was nuts, man. I went to the same school he did—Paly, Palo Alto High School. There was talk that there was a serial killer. I was in 9th grade then, and my parents basically put me under house arrest, couldn’t even walk to school on my own. But there were no other disappearances, so people slowly forgot about it. No trace of him was ever found. Until today.  Since all that’s left of him is a skeleton, they are going to try to use dental records to make a positive ID.”

“Jesus,” I said. I wondered if Jason’s brother was the guy who came in yesterday. That would be one hell of a coincidence.

I headed to my office and unlocked the door. I thought had left the cartridge in the Nintendo overnight, but it had vanished. I searched my office for about ten minutes, thinking I may have misplaced it, but couldn't locate it.

I went back out. José was still watching the news broadcast on his laptop.“Hey,” I called. “Did you take a cartridge from my office? Game was called *Desert War*”

He shook his head. “Haven’t been in there. But that title does sound vaguely familiar.”

On his laptop screen, they were showing a grainy photo of a boy wearing a backwards baseball cap and a black t-shirt. Like the character in the game. *Another coincidence?*

“Hey, turn that up,” I said.

The voice of the reporter filled the room: “…received word that an examination of dental records have confirmed that the body found early this morning is that of Jason Statler…”

“How’d they not find him sooner?” José asked me. “You’d think that lake would have been the first place they’d check. And even if they didn’t, it’s a popular spot.”

I shrugged. “Who knows? Maybe someone dumped him there recently.”

“…we have also received an additional update from the sheriff’s office,” the reporter continued. “A distinctive hat has been found near the body. They are asking that if you have any information about the owner of this hat, to call their office at once.”

A photo of a green hat, embroidered with stars and crescents, came on screen.
