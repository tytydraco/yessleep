When I woke up, I wasn’t scared. Confused, sure. But scared? Not me. If anything, I was a little apprehensive as I picked up my head from a matted lump of grass. The forest around me was quiet, the kind of quiet that usually makes people uneasy, but I don’t scare easy. Large black crows sat like gargoyles in the treeline above me, standing sentinels bearing witness to whatever happened the night before. I’ve been on these trails too many times, pushed through too many grueling miles to let a little silence get under my skin. Still, waking up naked in the middle of the woods? Not exactly how I planned to start my day.  

My first thought: How the hell did I fall asleep out here? My second thought: Why am I naked?  

The details were hazy. I remembered running, the air biting at my face, my breath fogging the trail in front of me. And then – flashes. The woman running. The woman in the tree. Her pink hat. The way her body twisted into the branches like the woods had claimed her as their own. I remembered running harder, faster, my pulse pounding in my ears. I remembered the trees shuddering as night came. The birds, the branches, and the feeling like I was completely alone, yet surrounded at the same time. After that? Nothing.  

But hey, weird things happen on the trails. Maybe I slipped, hit my head, got a little too into the zone. Happens to the best of us. I ran the Concordia 250 miler once – I saw some weird shit over the course of those three days – visions of people I knew in contorted shapes along the brush line. Visions of animals doing unnatural things. At points, the clouds in the sky formed faces that seemed to scream at me. All this pushed me harder though – and, as I lay there, I think the same thing must have happened last night. I mean, I am running like 60 miles a week – while working full time. Ultra life isn’t for everyone, obviously.   

Then I saw them – my clothes.  

They were hanging neatly from a low branch, like someone had carefully draped them there. My shorts, my shirt, my socks – everything. Even my blue Brooks hat, perched high above, just out of reach, like it was mocking me.  

I laughed. What else was I supposed to do? The whole thing was ridiculous. Some asshole must’ve stumbled across me, passed out and thought it’d be funny to mess with me. Trail runners can be weird like that. Or maybe I did it myself and forgot. Endorphins do crazy things to your brain. Things get wild on the trails.

I dressed quickly, the fabric cold against my skin. My legs felt like lead, my joints stiff, but I brushed it off. Just another day in the life of an ultra-runner.  

Back home, I decided to take a break. Not because I was scared – don’t get it twisted –  because I deserved it. Even I need a recovery period now and then. I spent my days scrolling through Instagram, where my feed was blowing up. Pictures of my gear, the trails, captions that sounded like me but not quite. Some of the pictures included my selfie – but, it didn’t look right. Might have been the lighting – something about the trees. It was weird.

**The trail always gives back to those who grind. #KipRunsFast #NeverStop #LostAndFound #KeepRunning**

Oddly poetic for my usual tone, but whatever. Maybe I’d written them during one of those long-run hazes. My followers loved it, anyway. They ate that stuff up. #KipRunsFast, baby.  

In my downtime, I looked up missing runners, trying to find the woman on the trail who became the woman dead in a tree that day. That shit is crazy – there are a lot of ladies who go missing (no offense females). Maybe don’t run by yourself? It was hard to know if any of these were her, right? All the stories and news bulletins read the same – the cops said she probably got lost, maybe fell into the river.  

I went over the day, went over my Strava to trace my trail. From my memory and from my data – it was a day like any other – until it wasn’t. Whatever – the next couple months went by and by summer, I was back at it. Hitting the trails, winning the races. The mysterious posts stopped – so, it must have been I had prescheduled some. Life was normal, and I was back, baby.

That’s when Jenna showed up in my life. 

She was new to the trails, eager to learn, the kind of runner who looked at me like I was a god. I wasn’t planning on mentoring anyone, but her enthusiasm was infectious. I thought this was my way to give back to the community – give back to the ladies. Change my karma in case that creepy bitch was out there someplace. Plus, it didn’t hurt having someone to remind me how good I am at what I do.  

We started running together. Jenna was slow, but she listened to my advice like it was scripture. I told her about pacing, hydration, mental toughness. She hung on every word. I didn’t tell her about what happened a few months ago. No need to freak her out. No need to look like a freak myself. 

Then, one day, it happened again.  

We were deep in the forest when Jenna stopped. “Do you see that?” she asked, pointing. Her voice was shaking.  

I followed her finger and froze.  

It was her. The woman in the tree. Only she looked worse this time. Her pink hat was barely visible under a layer of moss. Her limbs hung at odd angles, her head tilted, her empty eyes fixed on us. Vines and leaves grew through her ribcage and encircles her white bones that showed through the shredded gear.  

Jenna screamed. “Oh my God! Kip, what is that?”  

“It’s nothing,” I said quickly. “Just... a trick of the light. These woods play games with your head.”  

She wasn’t buying it. Jenna turned and bolted, crashing through the underbrush. “Jenna, wait!” I yelled, but she was gone.  

I ran after her, but the trails weren’t cooperating. They twisted and doubled back, leading me in circles. It was happening again, and I started freaking out. I tried to talk myself out of it – running and pausing to try to hear Jenna in the woods. The trees seemed closer than before, their branches reaching out like they wanted to grab me. The air felt heavy, like it was pressing down on my chest. The black crows returned, watching from above. They started to caw at each other, and I swear they were shit-talking us. The wind picked up, whipping up dried leaves and grass, dirt and debris. A cloud blocked out the sun, and the air grew cold.  

When I finally found her, she was huddled in a clearing, her face buried in her hands. “Jenna,” I said, stepping closer. “It’s okay. You just panicked. Happens to everyone. It’s these moments – when you’re spent, that you have to dig deep. Otherwise, find something else, sweetheart.”  

She didn’t respond.

“Jenna?”

Her head shot up, her face pale, eyes wide and unblinking. But they weren’t looking at me—they were looking past me.

I turned.

And there I was.

Hanging in the tree.

My mind rebelled, refusing to process what I was seeing. It wasn’t me – it *couldn’t* be. The face was mine, the lucky blue Brooks hat tilted, but it wasn’t real. It wasn’t real. This was another hallucination. Another trick of the trail. The forest messing with my head, like it had so many times before. I clung to the thought like a lifeline.

But the longer I stared, the harder it was to believe. The body swayed gently, like it belonged there. Like it had always been there. The vines weren’t just holding it — they were growing through it, wrapping tighter with every passing second. My chest heaved, and I stumbled back, the air suddenly too thick to breathe.

“This isn’t real,” I muttered, laughing — a sharp, hysterical sound that didn’t feel like mine. “This is some kind of hallucination. Endorphins. Dehydration. You’ve been through worse, Kip. Snap out of it.”

But the forest wasn’t letting me go.

The crows screamed above, circling in a frantic, mocking dance. The wind howled through the branches, carrying whispers. My phone buzzed in my pocket, and I fumbled for it, desperate for something – anything – to anchor me.

A new post.

The picture was of me. Not the me in the clearing, but the one in the tree. The caption read:

**I’m still here. The trail never ends. #KipRunsFast#KipRunsForever#NoWayOut**  

“No,” I whispered, my knees giving out as I sank to the ground. My hands shook as I tried to delete the post, but my fingers felt numb, useless. The screen blurred as tears filled my eyes.

Jenna’s scream pierced the air, snapping me back. She bolted, crashing through the underbrush, her footsteps fading fast.

“Jenna, wait!” I shouted, but my voice was weak, swallowed by the forest.

I didn’t follow her.

I couldn’t.

My legs refused to move, my body rooted to the ground like the trees around me. I looked back at the figure in the tree, and this time, I didn’t see it as separate from me.

It *was* me.

The realization hit like a punch to the gut, the weight of it pressing down on my chest. My mind raced, searching for an explanation, a way out, but there was nothing. No logic, no reason. Just the forest, alive and hungry, claiming what it wanted.

The crows cawed again, and I laughed – quiet at first, then louder, the sound raw and unhinged. If the forest wanted me, it could have me. What was the point in fighting it? What was the point in running?

And then, as I hung there, a strange feel came over me. Like, a chill. A runner’s high maybe? The forest wasn’t punishing me. It wasn’t even hunting me. It was *welcoming* me. I was part of it now.

The trail never ends.
