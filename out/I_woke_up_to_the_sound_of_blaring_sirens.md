I woke up to a strange sound. The sound of a siren whaling. I looked at the clock. It was only 2:36 am. I only just went to bed at 1:00. I'm still tired from the night before. I pulled an all-nighter with my friends partying the night before. I just needed sleep. I tossed and turned for a while. It's about 2:45 now and I can't sleep. The siren just kept getting louder. I decided to pull a pillow over my head. But the siren just kept getting louder.

I'm done with this. I sat up in my bed and looked around for something. I saw my window. The moonlight was glimmering in the window from the crack that my curtain wasn't covering. I looked at it; debating if I should go and look out of it. Maybe whatever was making that gut wrenching sound was outside. I am debating looking outside. What might happen? I eventually gave in. I looked out the window. But nothing was out of the ordinary? Everything was normal. The grass, the trees, even the old beer cans I have yet to pick up from the party. 

I wandered around my room for a while. I looked at the clock again. I've been up for just over 20 minutes trying to just get this sound to go away. The sound just wouldn't go away. It was getting deafening at this point. I could barely even hear myself think. Luckily I found some old noise canceling headphones. They were broken though. But it at least blocked some sound. The sound was still super loud and was still irritating my ears. 

It was 2:59 am and I decided to just get out of my room. Get somewhere different. As I opened the door my grandfather's clock chimed. I really regret getting that clock, it always chimes at the worst possible times.
I didn't even notice but. THE SOUND STOPPED. IT WAS FINALLY GONE! I probably would have gone deaf if that sound went on any longer. But something felt off after I opened the door. I got a shiver down my spine as soon as I stepped out of the room. I look around. I looked to my left then I looked to my right. Then it registered it looked like a humanoid figure was to my left. I wiped my head back around to see it but it wasn't there. And there was nothing to my right either. There was nothing wrong. I must be so sleep deprived I'm hallucinating. I really need sleep. 

I walked back into my room and closed my door. I was facing my door after I closed it. And I feel a hot breath on my neck... and something wet and slimy dripping down the back of my neck too. I turned around slowly. Absolutely terrified. I look up to see a tall dark shadowy figure towering over me. Suddenly everything went black. At least the sirens stopped.
