Look, I get it. Clowns are creepy. I’ve heard it all. “Clowns are childhood trauma in face paint.” “Clowns are demons with balloon animals." Blah blah blah but for me, being a clown was rent money. I didn’t choose the clown life, the clown life chose me, well after I got fired from my last job.

So yeah, I was Chuckles. Full-time party clown, part-time existential crisis in oversized shoes.
And this? This is the story that made me hang up the rainbow wig forever.

It was a Saturday afternoon in July. Hot as Satan’s jockstrap. I was already sweating before I got the costume on.

Client name: Meredith something-or-other.
Location: Suburbs. Big-ass house. Think "we-own-a-peloton-in-every-room" rich.
Gig: “Just entertain the kids for an hour or two! Make ‘em laugh! Do your little jokes!” Meredith said on the phone, like she was talking to a Roomba, not a human being with feelings and clown shoes.

I show up in full Chuckles gear—red nose, flower that squirts water and pants that are part tripping hazard, part fire hazard.

Meredith greets me at the door like she’s smelling spoiled milk.
Her: “You’re... the clown?”
Me: “I sure hope so, otherwise I just made a huge mistake in the Walgreens parking lot.”

No laugh. Just a sigh. Rich people don’t laugh, probably due to the fact they have a stick lodged up their ass like some ventriloquists jalapeno.

I shuffle into the backyard, expecting to see thirty screaming kids high on sugar.
Instead, I see... six kids. All sitting completely still.
Staring at me. Unblinking. Like Children of the Corn but in Baby Shark T-shirts.

Me (trying to salvage the vibe): “Heyyyy kiddos! Who’s ready for some chuckles with Chuckles?!”

Nothing. 

One kid blinked. 

That’s it.
They just stared.

I tried to just ignore the creepy kid vibes and get the show rolling. 

Started with balloon animals. Usually a hit.

Me: “Alright, who wants a doggy? Or a sword? Or... whatever this lumpy thing is, I think it’s a giraffe with anxiety!”

Still nothing. Not even a giggle.

Then the littlest girl with pigtails, big eyes, sippy cup of what I assumed was juice just walks up to me and tugs on my pant leg.
Her (whispering): “Do the scream.”

Me: “...Huh?”
Her: “The scream. The one the other clown did.”
Me: “Other clown? There wasn’t supposed to be another clown.”

She nods. The others are still staring.

Her: “He screamed and screamed and screamed. Then he went in the shed and he didn’t come out.”

I laughed, awkwardly.
Me: “Well that’s one way to exit the industry, huh?”

She didn’t laugh. She just sucked juice from her cup with the loudest sluuuuurp I’ve ever heard.

So naturally, I go ask Meredith.
Me: “Hey, weird question. Did you guys, like... hire another clown recently? One that maybe screamed a lot and... uh, went into a shed?”

She sips rosé and barely looks up.
Her: “Oh, right. Trevor, or Travis. Whatever. He left. The kids didn’t like him.”

Me: “Did he... ever come back out of the shed?”
Her: “What? I don’t know. I’m not a clown tracker. Are you going to juggle or not?”

Me: “Ma’am, I juggle with dignity. Which I have... just barely.”

I go back. The kids are now drawing in the grass with sticks. Not normal things like smiley faces or flowers. No. These are... sigils. Circles. Symbols that looked like IKEA instructions for summoning a demon.

The little girl, let’s call her Lilith, for reasons that will soon be apparent, hands me a drawing.

It’s me.
Not normal me.

It’s clown me, on fire, bleeding black goo out of my eyes and screaming.

Me: “Okay. That’s... not going on the fridge.”

I try to distract them with my signature move: The Giggle Cannon. Basically, a confetti popper I modified to shoot mini marshmallows. It usually gets at least one kid to lose their mind with joy.

I aim. Fire.
BOOM.
Too loud. Too smoky.
The confetti spirals down in the smoke, and when it clears—
There’s someone else standing in the yard.

Another clown.
Taller than me. Silent. Greasepaint running like it’s melting.
Eyes too wide. Smile way too big. Like, split to the ears big.
He just stands behind the kids.
No one reacts. Not even Meredith.
Just me. Sweating and questioning my clown based life choices.

Me: “Okay, who’s... who’s your friend?”

Lilith: “That’s the scream clown.”

The Scream Clown raises one gloved hand and slowly points at me.
I swear I felt every hair on my body do the wave.

Me (trying not to shit my oversized pants): “Nice makeup! Real spooky! I love the whole ‘murderous mime from hell’ thing you got going on”

Then he opens his mouth.

He screams.

Not like a person scream.
It was static.
It was old ass TV static mixed with nails on a chalkboard and the sound of a train wreck wrapped in crying.

I passed out. Like, hard. Just full on cartoon fainted, complete with the goofy ass shoe squeak and everything.

I woke up in the shed.
It was dark. Cold. Smelled like sadness and dry erase markers.
There were scratch marks on the walls. A rainbow wig on the floor. A torn red nose in the corner and painted on the inside of the shed door, in big smudged letters:

“NO ONE LEAVES LAUGHING.”

I screamed. Real human scream. Not as cool as the Scream Clown, but it got the job done.

I kicked the shed door open and stumbled into the backyard.

Everyone was fucking gone.

No kids. No Meredith. No tall Scream Clown.
Just a deflated bounce house and a lone sippy cup still dripping red juice on the grass.
I quit that day. Haven’t worn the costume since.
Sometimes, when I’m driving and the radio fuzzes out, I think I hear that static scream in the distance.
Sometimes I see drawings taped to poles in town. Crayon drawings of clowns on fire.

I tell myself it’s just PTSD.
I tell myself Trevor probably got a new gig.

Sometimes, when I sleep, I dream I’m back in that shed and the door doesn’t open.
