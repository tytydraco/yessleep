My first case was at the beginning of winter in 1975s.

I woke up in a hole, stacked by ugly and rotten bodies.
I got up in spite of the great shock of the brain that pulsated like burning iron over my head, I instinctively remembered that it produced it; a robust object, the only thing in my mind.
I arose with difficulty, I fell several times, the reason, the mud of biomass that covered the ends of the pit, managed to get out by stacking several bodies, if it were not for the above described the landscape that before my eyes spread, would undoubtedly be, the Nirvana, but those frondos pinos hid something arcanus, something diabolical.


The cold perforated my skin, I continued walking along a narrow and drizzle path until I saw a cabin, it was careless, but sturdy, the light that passed through the windows was of a clear ocre, look at the door, there was nothing out of common, except the metal caller with a diabolical figure of bronze. After hitting for 2 minutes a gentleman in good clothes spit


- What do you want?


-I need a map of the voice zone with slight agitation


- They're stacked, you can pass while I'm looking for them if you think it's an indifferent voice.


As the melody of a tocadiscus playing jazz entered, he broke the tension of the atmosphere, note that this man, who was about 45 years old, possessed a vast collection of skeletons of hominids, among them an interesting one; Homo habilis.
When he found the map he turned to me with his hand stretched out in a friendly gesture


-I'm sorry I didn't introduce myself. I'm Vance.


- No problem, James.


James-I see you're interested in hominids- Vance-I'm an anthropologist-


James-Interestingly, I see that your collection is immense, from where you get so many skeletons--


Vance-Al it seems a lie, of this forest, exactly at these points (pull the map from the pocket showing the points)-


At that moment I realized that one of the dots indicated the place where I woke up.


James-Do you know any tradition of the ancient tribes of this place?-


Vance-As you ask, in an excavation I found this (he lifts a tool still like a hammer hammer), it is related to the myth of the Homo Anomale


Vance-In 1853 in Siberia, explorers are believed to have found a cave with varied remains of unknown hominids, their state of putrefaction indicated that they had died no more than 1 month ago, when studying their brains they realized that they were similar to Homo sapiens, that indicates that their intellect is similar to ours, but different in physical morphology.


Well, it's too late, I've got a room left if you want to spend the night.


After thanking him and deciding to spend the night, I headed to the room with heavy heart...


I woke up maniacated, around me I noticed medical parafernalia,


Vance-It seemed curious that somebody in the middle of the night knocked on my door to ask about a map and a tribe, I know they're kind of crazy, but, that's their nature, are you a researcher?-


When I heard those words, my mind came back to why I was here, the contusion had left me disoriented, but something I could not forget, the case of the cannibal community, across the United States several common pit had been discovered without an apparent reason, it was concluded that some community practiced cannibalism in remote places, the only thought that crosses my mind is


James- Do I still have the gun in the hook? Extremely desperate voice
