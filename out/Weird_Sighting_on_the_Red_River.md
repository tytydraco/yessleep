  One of the guys in my friend group has a huge area of private land that his family owns that is up alongside the red river, bordering Oklahoma and Texas. They use it as their primary hunting spot, but outside of hunting season it’s usually abandoned. One weekend, he offered for me and a few other guys to go camping just to give us something to do. The trip ended up being four of us college guys who drove out there around four in the afternoon, bringing a large tent with us. There was no phone service out there and we didn’t have any four wheelers or anything, so the earlier portion of the evening was pretty much filled with us doing stupid activities like shooting soda cans with BB guns, and chopping trees with an axe.

  In all honesty, we were asking for trouble that night. Two of us knew the area pretty well unlike the others. We decided to pick a spot in between the feeder and the pond, assuming some deer or other wildlife would walk by in the middle of the night, we would use that as an opportunity to scare the others. We started to pitch our tent later in the night using the light from our truck’s headlights as it was already dark outside. We planned to stay up late to capitalize on the scare, but ended up falling asleep very quickly.

  Of course we had our weapons next to us for protection if anything came up. The axe we were playing around with earlier, and two BB guns. We practically were invincible with these “military grade weapons.”

  Forty-five minutes went by, and I was shaken awake by one of my friends. They were all awake already, and before I could say anything they held up the notion to stay quiet. I thought they were just trying to scare me or pulling a prank, but I could clearly hear footsteps crunch in the leaves around the outside of our tent. I looked around and when I noticed everyone was accounted for, then I got nervous. The steps didn’t sound right, but they also didn’t sound immediately alarming. Just… disturbing. There was just no rhythm to them, it was just random bursts of steps then nothing. There were moments where whatever it was seemed interested in our tent and moments that it didn’t. Eventually it went away. It got really silent for a minute, like, really really silent. The silence you wouldn’t hear out in nature.

  Eventually one of the guys broke the silence saying we should go investigate. It’s stupid, but adrenaline rushes are no joke. Before you judge us too hard, we used the buddy system, which is virtually an indestructible tactic.

   We slowly took a step out and turned our iPhone flashlights on and shined into the trees. We didn’t see anything. Causing all of us to jump suddenly we heard a strange noise coming from in front of us. It sounded almost as if someone was trying to talk while inhaling. 

  The second we heard the noise all of our bodies went into panic mode, without exchanging a word we decided it was time to get out of there.

   Leaving all of our stuff behind, we darted to the truck which was not too far off. We struggled in the panic to get into the truck and hit the ignition. The truck lit up and we hit the lights, only to see a being in front of the truck. The second we saw it all of us started shouting.

 I don’t even know how to begin to describe it. It was a, I don’t know, squad? There were like 8-12 people that were just STANDING THERE. Their clothes didn’t look modern or traditional, they looked like… I don’t even know it definitely wasn’t cloth or anything I’ve seen.

 We backed that whip up in such a panic that the back of it hit a tree; breaking the tail light off and giving the tailgate a massics dent. We got the car in drive and drove past them and got out of there. For a good minute it was all of us just talking over each other to try and figure out what just happened.

  We went back the following day, this time with his dad and in the daylight to pick our stuff up. Our stuff had obviously been rummaged through but nothing was stolen or broken surprisingly. The land is now for sale. I don’t know what the hell I had witnessed. 

  We were advised not to go back, but geez we’re curious. We aren’t going to do anything rash, but we are considering maybe taking my drone and flying it out there. Maybe spot a vehicle or something? It’s pretty far off the nearest road. Either those people live out there or they drove something into there. 

  Nothing makes sense at all. For one we didn’t hear footsteps of a group, just one singular individual. I don’t know, I have absolutely no idea.
