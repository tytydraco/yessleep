[PART ONE](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/17luwmr/i_tried_using_a_ouija_board_to_find_my_longlost/)

As we waited on the bench, I thought about offering to run over to one of the nearby convenience stores to buy Ashley something to drink. But the shooting pain in my swollen arm put my teeth on edge. And the thought of going anywhere that night without her by my side petrified me, so we just sat there in silence.

After fifteen minutes, Ashley started talking: “It wasn’t supposed to be like this, it wasn’t supposed to be like this, it wasn’t supposed to be like this…” She kept muttering that to herself, over and over again, almost like the bizarre chant in the park. I didn’t know what to say and the truth was she was scaring me.

“Ash, go easy, man,” I said, the words foreign to my own ears. I felt cumbersome like an eight-year-old walking across the carpet in her mother’s stilettos. “Ash, you’re in shock, just chill out.”

“I’m not in shock. I’m not. Listen, you have to listen to me now, okay? What I did back there won’t hold that thing off for long. I’m lucky I picked up the smell before it got close enough to trap us in those woods. But there’s no outrunning that thing. In about three to five hours, it’ll be loose and it’ll come for you.”

“Me?” I cried, my eyes slits. My head now ached as I grew uncomfortably sober.

“Just listen to me, Carla,” she said, deliberating. Desperate to achieve my undivided attention. She had already bandaged up her lacerated thumb with a handkerchief and was applying pressure. It wasn’t much blood shed, and I knew the little she’d lost had nothing to do with her current weakened state.

Ashley resumed: “You have to cleanse your house before it reaches you there. I’ll show you how.”

“Hold on a sec,” I interrupted. This was all too much. “It? Before it reaches my house? You mean that enormous anatomy model in the forest back there?”

“Yes,” she said, her eyes incandescent in the night, giving me the thousand-yard stare. “I mean that thing that chased us out of Lisgar Meadow Brook. Its name is Leantoir.”

“Leantoir,” I said, feeling the word in my mouth. Its very utterance putrid on my tongue.

I then bit my bottom lip, the gears grinding inside my skull. “How do you know so much about all this? What was that with the – the flower thing and Christmas tree twig back there? All that chanting and stuff. All that gibberishy stuff. I mean – what –”

Ashley’s bombastic sigh startled me, shutting me up. I could see her eyes shine with tears, her mascara smudged, her makeup now as darkly shambolic as my own. She then muttered her despairing refrain: “It wasn’t supposed to be like this…”

“Stop! Stop saying that! It’s as if…”

I stopped myself midsentence; another possible connection clicked inside my brain.

“Why did this thing appear while playing the Ouija board?” No answer from Ashley. “Why did it appear after I asked about Russell?” Again, no answer. “What does this – that thing, Leantoir – have to do with Russell?”

Not meeting my gaze, Ash’s head quivered from side to side as if she had abruptly developed Parkinson’s. “It – it –”

“…Wasn’t supposed to be like this?” I finished for her, glowering at the side of her head. “It has nothing to do with Russel,” she said, her head still wobbling. She was a bad actor.

“Don’t bullshit me, man. Tell me, right now, what the fuck does that thing have to do with my brother.”

“Look, Carla,” she pleaded, gesticulating wildly with her good hand, desperate to change the subject. “You need to listen to me; the Leantoir is never going to go away, now. You must - ”

“Tell me what that thing has to do with my brother, right now, Ash.”

Clearly licked, Ashley gave another, quieter sigh, before closing her mouth. Her pink lips forming into a battered pair of rose petals before nodding her head. Reticent but resigned, she said, “All right, I’ll tell you.”

She then told me how, six years ago, her mother had ordered her to go into my daddy’s bathroom, the next time I had her over to the house, and to take something of his. Something physical. A strand of hair. A nail clipping. Anything of his physical – *guh!* – essence. Her mother told her to do this, five or six times, and each time Ashley was over, she “forgot.” The truth was, she was both scared of being caught and creeped out by her mother’s request.

Her mother, confronting her about her repeated failure of this errand, told her she needed to do this because my father was a bad man and needed to be banished from the city. She assured Ash that neither Russell or I would be effected by what she planned on doing. Now the fifteen-year-old Ashley Greyson felt invigorated – willing to complete her mother’s task. But there was just one problem: she knew how much I loved my father. (I always had been a daddy’s girl, my mother always being so fussy and prude, always trying to put me in dresses and pink since I was an infant; whereas my father always treated me like a first son, which is what I wanted.) And in her own way, Ash loved my dad too. Russell McCullough Senior might have been brash, bawdy, and more like your tipsy uncle at Thanksgiving than an ideal patriarch, but he was a good man: always volunteering to help for school field trips, when he could get time off work, always telling lighthearted jokes, taking all possible slights at his expense in jovial stride. While he might have been the butt of a few lighthearted jabs, and more than a little uninformed on social issues of the day, everyone, with the exception of Ashley’s mother, apparently, loved him. That was Russell Senior. Russell Junior, on the other hand – at least as far as Ashley Greyson was concerned – he was a different story.

Ash could still recall the time Russell, my parents and I, were invited over to the Greysons’ for a barbecue, celebrating her dad Landon’s promotion to vice president of the bank. As the night drew darker, most of us were outside in the backyard, parents on the patio sipping wine and chatting in the light of the tiki torches, kids splashing around in the pool, playing Marco Polo. That was except for my brother Russell and this little punk who lived down the hall from us, this snot-nosed little know-it-all named Tanner Kipling. The two of them decided to hang back inside the house, with all the lights turned off, having excused themselves to go to the bathroom. They decided to steal up the stairs and sneak their way into Ashley’s bedroom. Presumably, the allure of the taboo, of a girl’s bedroom, was too enticing for them to resist. While in there, they had quite the time: popping the heads off her Barbie Dolls, jumping on top of her bed, tearing through her diary, scattering her underwear and training bras across the carpet floor. No doubt laughing and giggling like they had front row seats at Yuk Yuk’s.

I had never heard about this. Not even a passing reference to it. The only reason she’d even caught the little bastards was that she saw movement from her window and rushed out of the pool, dripping wet. Apparently, it was my turn to be Marco and I’d had my chlorine-soaked eyes closed. When she tore into her room and found them, they giggled and beat a hasty retreat, leaving her room in tatters. Never offering even a token apology. She just felt so humiliated. So violated. Remembering this incident, understanding her mother meant to cast a hex on our family, Ash opted instead to glom a tuft of hair from Russell Junior’s comb the next time she was over at our apartment. And that, according to her, was how my brother vanished. How he was eventually spirited away by that walking obscenity – by the Leantoir.

“But, I don’t understand,” I interjected. “If all this is true than why did you agree to do the séance with me tonight? Especially after I told you I wanted to try and contact my brother.”

No answer to that. Just a thousand-yard stare. Likely, she didn’t know either.

I moved on to the more pressing question: “Why did your mother do that? Any of that? Why put a hex on my dad? Or anybody.”

“Come on, Carla,” she muttered, addressing her lap. “You know.”

“No, I don’t, Ash. What the heck did my father ever do to her?”

“It wasn’t him. It was you. All of you.”

I tossed my head in disbelief. “What?”

“It’s because you’re trash. I’m sorry but I’m not sorry. You are. You’re all so common. You’re  from the sticks or the ghetto, or wherever you moved from, driving property value down. Filling up the cul-de-sacs and streets with your cousins’ station wagons and pickup trucks every weekend, having keggers, keeping the neighbours up. Polluting the air with rye whisky and backyard-grown cannabis. I mean, I didn’t understand it when my mother told me. I was just a kid, how could I? But I get it now. My father was a banker – a man on the rise from a good family with a wife and three kids. He graduated with distinction from Western. My mother went to Brown for economics, she worked as a college professor before she had me. So how is it fair that your dad, some beer-swilling hoser from Ancaster, who works at McDonald’s, can afford to live in the same neighbourhood? Can send his kids to the same schools? How is that equitable?”

Ashley’s injurious speech struck me like a cold slap in the face. An angry heat crept up my nape. I glowered hard at her, my fingernails digging into the blue plastic beneath my legs. I wanted to tell her she didn’t know what she was talking about. That my daddy worked two jobs to get us that apartment. That Russell, my mother and I weren’t trash. That my dad worked at Burger King, not McDonald’s. But, then I thought about the bags I’d huffed before meeting her. Not to mention the booze and crank I’d stashed away at home. Suddenly, all the distinctions that I felt elevated my family above the dealers in the stairwell in the old public housing tower seemed as minuscule and dismissible as the difference between a Big Mac and a Whopper.

“That’s pretty big talk for a witch,” I settled on as a retort.

Ash clucked her tongue. “There are people like you everywhere in Aakoziwin,” she elaborated. “Folks hiding their income, understating their assets so that they can move into public housing and acquire government benefits they’re not entitled to have.”

I sunk my chin into my chest. None of that had been true when they put that hex on us six years ago. But I knew all of that was true about me and my father now.

“I thought the problem was that we didn’t have enough money, Ash. Not that we pretended to be poor.” Another toss of her hair.

Another cluck of the tongue. Like I was a gnat she couldn’t quite swat away. My anger waxed white hot. *Fuck you, you bitch.*

“So, your mother wanted my daddy dead? For the Leantoir to kill him?”

“No, no, no. Not exactly, no. The Leantoir isn’t a killer per se, just a very persistent pursuer. It doesn’t always bring death, but despair. In the old days, it used to bring pestilence and ruined farmer’s crops. Your dad was only chosen by my mother because he was the head of the household. If he got chased off, it stood to reason that the rest of you would follow.”

I let that pass for the moment and asked her why the two of us had ran out of Lisgar Meadow Brooks and why she needed that incantation if this thing is so easily evaded. She told me she didn’t know what it would do, having been summoned by the Ouija Board. Also, there was no telling which of us it would attach itself to. Regardless, she and I were pretty certain it wouldn’t attach itself to her. I now suspect that incantation wasn’t to drive the creature back, but rather to protect herself, rather than the both of us.

The bus arrived and we both got on. Ash explained the protective spells through furtive whispers in my ear as we road through the city.

After she’d gotten off at her stop, leaving me on the airy, rumbling bus, I kept ruminating on that one question: Why had Ashley agreed to the séance tonight? She must have known there was a chance we would summon that being from the nether world, or wherever. Especially with that special planchette she’d used. If she and her mother dabbled in the dark arts, why wouldn’t she be especially careful not to antagonize the spirits? Did she do it because she knew, worse comes to worse, she could protect herself? That this might be an opportunity to place a second hex on my head, driving me permanently out of her life? Or maybe it had been so long since she’d dabbled, she was just over-excited and lost her head. Or maybe she felt guilt over Russell’s disappearance and wanted to genuinely help me track him down. Perhaps all of the above. Perhaps none of the above but something in between. None of these answers are ones Ash would own up to. And it hardly mattered now.

By the time I arrived home it was two in the morning. My father had made his way from the broken, beer-sodden La-Z-Boy to the floor, a fresh puddle of regurgitated Molson and Chef Boyardee sloshing mere centimetres beside his head.

I’d memorized the ritual – the defensive spell – Ashley had taught me: whenever I felt the presence close by, clutch a spring of holly close to my chest and clear my thoughts of all fears and mortal wants. She gave me a few sprigs of the stuff and advised that I plant some around our property. She also suggested I try using ivy to ward of drunkenness in the home. Not sure if that’ll ever take here.

Sleep an impossibility, I stayed up long enough until I picked up that horrid stench. The thing never appeared, perhaps it couldn’t enter here, but the smell announced its presence all the same. I was now certain Ash wasn’t telling me everything. Perhaps, she never had. I felt lonely then, lonelier than ever, reflecting on how I didn’t know my oldest friend as well as I had thought I had.

Despite the smell, I didn’t bother performing any of the defense spells. Instead, I stood from where I had been sitting cross legged on the floor and strode into my bedroom, sensing something tailing close behind but neither hearing nor seeing anything.

From underneath my mattress, I produced a half spent yellow tube of adhesive, squirted a line inside a brown paper lunch bag, and inhaled until the base of my skull began to hum.

Once I was done inhaling fumes, I stole the last of my daddy’s whisky from the magnum bottle below the sink and choked down the burning liquid until the walls started to move. My stomach flipped, seeing the Leantoir, the horrific skinned creature with the horse head instead of an arm, standing in the apartment foyer, hunched for the low ceiling. I didn’t hear it come in. I didn’t see it before. I had no prior indication other than the fetid, maddening odour. Poor Russ, I thought. That thing must have absolutely terrified him. My mind then tortured itself with all the scenarios of how he might have died, how that could have happened without his body ever being found. I pacified those thoughts with another pull off the whisky.

I realized then that it wasn’t meant to kill me. It wouldn’t do a thing to me. It would just always be there. In some form, following me, razzing me with its hideous appearance, bringing misfortune. That I’d never get used to looking at it. That I’d never be happy ever again.

And so, I commenced to drinking. Drinking until I was numb, and the walls danced around me. Drinking until I was sick. Alcohol, it was the only thing to make the creature – its appearance, its smell – its presence anywhere near tolerable. I would need to do this every day. Every night. Getting high and drunk, chasing the Leantoir away with ethanol and ephedrine. Until I was numb bordering on nauseous. Until I’d rendered myself unconscious.

But that was no different from before. Now at least my despair was in front of me, instead of being invisible and all encompassing. Now I had a source – a target for my plight. I finally had someone to blame. Ashley Greyson. The one who’d left me behind to be devoured. I wasn’t going to plot out my revenge. Nor how I was going to extirpate this demon from my life. I had someone to blame for my misery. And that was [enough.](https://www.reddit.com/user/snickeringhaystack)
