I’m an older woman with a demanding job and a family to take care of. I don’t have the time to remember every little thing, and people have described me as scatterbrained. But I can still remember what my brother did the spring I turned ten, down by the leaping river, and how it started everything else.

That's not just a name I invented, every kid in town called it that because if you stood on the biggest rock and bent your back at the right angle, you could leap to the other side and grab the elm tree branch like a jungle chimp. I should make it clear this wasn’t the kind of venture you just took up any other Saturday. Most of us kids were petrified by the sharp stones that pointed through the river's surface like teeth and the rushing rapids that didn’t care how many years you had left to live. Looking back, it really was a stupid risk for even stupider kids. 

But in the spring of 1987, that didn’t matter to my brother Elijah. The only thing that mattered was that Kevin Fackleman told him that he was too chicken-shit to make the jump, which of course was war talk for any fifteen-year-old with a pulse. He told Kevin to meet him at the river at ten that night, and then they’d both see who was a “chicken-shit”. 

Naturally, he tried to keep this a secret from me. I was eleven years old and somehow hadn't grown out of being the family tattletale. I don’t think I ever would have found out if I hadn’t snooped in on him packing up his backpack.

“Why do you need the bug killer?” I asked, Elijah dropped his equipment and rushed to close the door. I was still small and quick at that age, so I was able to rush inside the room before he could reach the handle. My brother spun around as I scrambled behind his bed. “Go *away*” he hissed, probably wanting to kick himself for leaving his door open. 

“What are you doing?” I asked, brushing over his words. My brother narrowed his eyes. “Aren't you supposed to be doing homework? I’ll get mom and you’ll have to skip dessert”. My face fell at the thought, but as simple as I was, I still knew one good trick.

“Nah, because if you get mom she’ll ask what you’re packing up for, and then she’ll yell and yell and ground you for a week” I whined with slight pride, typical for a brat. Elijah was quiet for a second, then sighed. 

“Fine”. He grunted, picking at the acne that plastered his left cheek. 

Once he could tell I was all ears, he told me everything, about how “that jerk from my gym class” had given him a dare, and how he was gonna show him wrong once mom and dad had gone to bed. 

“Lemme come with you. I wanna see.” 

My brother turned away. He zipped up his backpack, slung one of the straps over his right shoulder, and turned his head back to me. I could see a firm “no” in his eyes as he made his way to the door. Just before he turned the knob, his shoulders slumped. 

“You’re gonna tell mom and dad, aren't you.”

I didn’t say anything. I could guess where things were going, and was glad.

“You can come. Get packed up and meet me outside in three hours. Bring your flashlight, mine’s already a little flickery.”

I smiled. You have to understand I was at the age where an adventure with teenagers was about the coolest, most mature thing I could experience. Imagining how angry my parents would be only made it more exciting. Still, one question remained: what if I fell asleep before the meeting time? After all, my dad was the only one in the house with an alarm clock. “What if I’m late?”

Elijah didn't say anything, but I could sense his implication that there was no way that would happen.  
And to his credit, he wasn't wrong. We left the house sometime at 11 pm, and that was that. It hadn’t been terribly easy for me with my clumsiness and fear of any resulting noises, but Elijah held my arm down the stairs and whispered promises that “this door doesn’t creak, remember?”. 

I remember standing outside the front door with the whole night sky in front of me and nothing but the sound of crickets, and suddenly becoming aware of how small I was. If I had been smarter, I would have seen how stupid I was being and gone back inside. But I was eleven years old, and the chance to see something so exciting up close seemed impossible to pass up.

My brother was soon several feet ahead of me, and I stopped looking around into the night so I could run to his side. Judging by what I heard from older kids around the neighborhood, terrible things could happen in the night. I thought of such things and hugged my brother’s arm. He barely seemed to notice. 

A few minutes later, I asked him if “this Calvin guy will let me watch you jump? Will he send me back?”. Almost reluctantly, Elijah turned his head to me. 

“His name is Kevin, and he won’t. Dudes like him always want more attention. He’ll think it’ll be funnier if you see me chicken out.” he said plainly. I smiled hopefully. “You won’t though, right? You’ll prove him wrong.” I grinned at the thought of a bully in our already rowdy area learning some shame. My brother’s eyes turned back to the road, and he said nothing. The crickets sounded quieter after that, and the moon seemed to stare. 

Just when I thought we might be getting lost, we saw the house my brother said belonged to this “Kevin” kid. He walked up to the driveway and made me stand at the border while he went further. I stared at a white chalk drawing on the gravel.

Elijah raised the flashlight to one of the windows, and a circular ray shone on the blinds. A few seconds passed, and I heard my brother utter a word I knew mom would scold him for. Was the light not coming through? Would I miss out? Please God, don’t let it be, I thought.

Like an answer to my little prayer, the front door slowly opened, and out stepped a figure around the same size as my brother. Kevin! Elijah swerved his flashlight in his direction, and even from a distance I could see a smile below the hand shielding his eyes. I doubt my brother returned it. 

Kevin went up to Elijah and gave him a good punch on the shoulder. I thought my brother would push him away, but he just stumbled back a little. Both boys ran up to the driveway border, and I could see that Kevin was more prepared than either of us. His backpack was practically swollen, and he had a look of eased confidence that seemed unnatural for someone in his position. Didn’t he know the night’s importance? 

“Who’s the kid?” he asked, side-eying me like I was a fly on his arm. “She’s my sister, Chrissy.” my brother answered, and to subtract some embarrassment, added “It was the only way she wouldn’t tell my mom. She wants to watch.” Kevin grinned, and I knew my brother had been right about him liking an audience. 

“Cool, we’ve got a whole gang. Let’s get going” he said. I was more than ready to take off, but first, he turned to me. 

“Hey, don’t start cryin’ if your brother backs out, alright? One of my dad's friends had a farm near the river, and if he hears us, I’m *dead*?” he ordered slowly, as if he didn’t expect me to understand otherwise. He turned his back, and just like that, he and my brother were on their way. 

I walked behind them, glaring in Kevin’s direction, and for the rest of our journey I stayed completely silent, just watching the other two. Older kids were still something of a mystery to me, and I was both intrigued and somewhat uneased by how my brother changed when around Kevin. He had never been like the brothers I saw on TV, how everyone tells you a brother is *supposed* to act, but there was always something I could rely on with him. He would never get *too* mean, would never do anything beyond a petty insult or pinch on the arm. He didn’t have the same emotional restraint at the moment. It seemed every time Kevin opened his mouth, Elijah wanted nothing more than to spit out every curse in the book.

I couldn’t exactly blame him. Kevin seemed pretty intent on telling him details my brother couldn’t care less about (who frenched who behind the gym, how silly he thought my brother’s Greatest American Hero shirt looked), seemingly unaware of my brother’s grimace. Or maybe he did see it. Maybe that was part of the fun.

After what must have been an hour, we found ourselves at leaping river. The last ten or so minutes of our journey were through a sprawling field with no houses in sight, and I felt we were rookie explorers of new terrain. I’d been here before (childish boredom breeds exploration) but the night made everything otherworldly and lush and unsure. When the river had come into view, this became all the more clear. 

The river, which I *had* seen before out of sheer curiosity, seemed like an animal now. Not just any animal either, but one of those dark pythons that you would thank God for never seeing outside a National Geographic issue. Actually, this was worse. Pythons are relatively slow creatures, and those nasty little teeth reside in the mouth. The river was fast as hell, and as I listened to that water rush, I felt like I could touch the sharp rocks I knew were lurking *everywhere*. 

As we walked over leaves and discarded junk from those before us, I could feel my excitement starting to heighten. It had been present before, but now it was almost painful. We were *so close*. Any minute now, the jump would be made, Kevin would hang his head in shame, and I would practically be a big kid just for being there. 

And then, we found it. The three of us stood next to that big rock we knew Elijah would be jumping from, and I couldn’t help but feel at its cold surface. I wanted something to ground me. Otherwise, I thought, I might just jump out of my skin.

“Second thoughts?” I heard Kevin ask, rudely snapping me back into focus. My brother chuckled, and it sounded more like a growl, if you can believe it. Even in the dark, his eyes shone with something I didn’t like. He seemed even more youthful in his disdain. 

My brother crawled up on the rock, and once he stood on top I forgot about everything else. He took deep breaths, shook his arms slightly. Even though I knew the river wasn’t coming any closer, that water sounded louder and louder in my head with every passing second, and with every little thing my brother was whispering under his breath. 

I thought of Sunday school, of the little paper doves we made after prayers for the needy. In that moment, I wished with my whole heart for *all* my doves to be returned, so I could erase “for the starving”, and write in “for my brother”. I knew it was a selfish thought, a sin, but I didn’t care. 

“Please god, don’t hurt him” I whispered, clutching the pointiest part of that cold stone like a lifeline. 

He jumped. 

For a second, it seemed like something kept him in midair, between the rock and that beckoning tree branch. Of course, that couldn’t have been the case, but it was my perception. I must have been taking some sort of mental snapshot, for how else could I still so vividly remember the water under his feet and how his hands stretched out like a cat’s? Again, the moon seemed to stare. 

And then, he made it. Against the worst images I had in my mind, he made it. He grabbed onto that branch, and just…hung on. The only sound louder than the river was his breathing. Now, the flashlight had been set down, and I don’t know if I could fully trust my eyes alone in that darkness, but I believe my brother was crying. It wasn’t the running-for-the-hills sobbing you saw on crappy soap operas or whatever else my mother would curl up to at night, but I *swear* the tears were there. I think they shone a little in the moonlight. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Kevin smiling. 

“Damn, pretty good for a chicken-shit!” he said with a laugh. I felt some awkwardness from hearing a word like that, said like it was nothing, but I reminded myself that I was an honorary big kid now. As Elijah made his way to the ground, the way the tree was structured making it fairly easy, I told myself that I could handle anything. I looked at Kevin, and felt a smirk forming. 

My smugness didn’t last too long. Kevin made his way onto the rock (his sneaker nearly pushed my hand away) and stood like he had something to be proud of.

“Now it’s my turn, alright?” he called out to Elijah on the other side, seeming to have forgotten about that nearby uncle of his. It dawned on me that Kevin wasn’t the type to feel too bad about losing a bet, particularly with someone he didn’t respect. The fact that he’d been proven wrong didn’t even seem to phase him. As he got ready to jump, I couldn’t help but feel let down. 

There was less apprehension at Kevin’s attempt, seeing as how I’d already watched my scrawnier brother make the leap. He and I both watched the other boy jump, and I could faintly hear my brother click his tongue in annoyance. I could already guess the remarks he was sure to make on the trip back home. Kevin grabbed onto the branch, and unlike Elijah, there was no shaky breathing or possible tears. He just hung there, smiling like an idiot. He didn’t even *sound* scared. 

“Hey Eli, it isn’t that hard, see?” he said, swinging his legs around just to show off. “Got yourself all worked up over nothing, didn’t ya?” he added. He chuckled to himself, and I realized that this was nothing to him. Jumping the river may have been a challenge to kids my age or someone skin-and-bones as my brother, but someone as currently comfortable as Kevin must have had enough school sports and roughhousing to make something like this a leisure. This was all about him. I only served as an audience member, and my brother’s only purpose was to be a comparison. To be worse. 

As Kevin’s laughter rang on and on, I began to fret. Kevin might have made up his uncle just to scare me into being quiet, but still, an angry adult is an angry adult. I picked up the put-aside flashlight, and shone it toward Elijah. He gave an irritated squint, and then stared back at Kevin. That look in his eyes…it put a horrible feeling in me, to see someone so filled with loathing. With every laugh from Kevin, it was like something was growing inside him. As he looked up at the boy on the branch, that youthful hatred returned to the surface.An idea had formed.

With some primal noise I’ve never heard since, my brother pushed Kevin into the rushing, teeth-stone filled water. 

If my terror hadn't seized me the way it did, I may have taken notice of how easily he went down. Again, Elijah wasn’t strong by any means, but Kevin must have been so lost in his own glory that his body was caught off guard. With no more than a push and a jab to his arm, he fell into that river and got his jaw struck by the nearest rock. Any fears of nearby adults instantly vanished, and I yelled bloody murder. I screamed and screamed and screamed until my throat stung, and it was still dwarfed by the noises Kevin was making. 

He was gasping, crying, and screeching all at once, his voice carrying a feeling he shouldn’t have known at that age. As I stood there like a cornered animal, I once again remembered Sunday school. We weren’t taught much about hell, but our teacher had reluctantly told us, very briefly, about those screaming people and their torment. As Kevin’s cries surrounded me, I could think of no other comparison. 

I looked at my brother, and saw him standing *just* close enough to where he could pull Kevin back up. As tears clouded my view, I hollered out to him. 

“Elijah!” I wailed. No response. He just stood there, looking down at Kevin gripping the same rock that had struck him the way a blade would. He was swearing more than ever through his crying, using words I didn’t even know. I heard him call out for his mother. That’s something my mind will never blur. 

I yelled again. “What are you doing?” “Pull him out!” “Are you stupid?” I cried, even though I knew idiocy wasn’t the culprit here. How could he have pushed him? How could he just *be* there, and not cry as I did? I saw something in my brother that my young mind couldn’t read. In retrospect, it couldn’t have been anything else but silent victory. 

People, especially kids, usually aren’t terribly clever in moments of panic. Perhaps this is why I grabbed the flashlight, crouched down to where the grass met the water, and reached out my free hand. The water coursed under my arm, the sound combining with everything else and pushing me to cry even more. 

“Kevin!” I shouted. He looked at me, and I gasped to see the blood dripping from his chin. It just kept coming, like foam from the mouth of a rabid dog. Up close, I could see his eyes were manic and had a puffiness around them. I knew he was the same Kevin from before, but he looked more like some wounded animal. “Kevin, please hold on! I’m gonna pull you…” 

I couldn’t finish my sentence. Someone was looking at me. 

I slowly gazed upwards, and just as I figured, my brother had turned his stare to me. For a second, I thought the very worst, but I soon realized he wasn’t gazing at me with any contempt. 

He looked at me, as I was with my quivering hand and screwed face, and then at that merciless river. But he wasn’t planning any harm to me. He seemed uneasy. He could always see, especially now, how small I was. Too small and weak to not fall in.

“Chrissy, step back, alright? I’ll pull him back up” he said. He had to shout to be heard over Kevin’s crying, and he *still* sounded too calm. I shook my head, and his eyes narrowed. “Chrissy, step back. Now.” He sounded so firm, and on a night like this, I wasn’t keen on taking chances. I slowly withdrew my hand and ambled back several steps. I stared at my brother and Kevin, thinking of one last prayer for the night. 

“Please god, make him keep his promise” I whispered. 

I saw Elijah crouch down to where Kevin could hear him better. I heard the faintest of words, but couldn’t make any of them out. After a while, Kevin quit screaming, and his cries turned softer. I saw nodding. Then, after there was nothing but pained whimpers, my brother took hold of Kevin’s arms and hauled him out. It looked awfully hard, but still. My brother was true to his word.

Once Kevin was on dry land, I expected him to sock my brother in the jaw. It would have been the *least* he deserved. But instead, he just stood there. Just held himself, and wept. He didn’t look at either of us. 

Then he ran. Just took off like a rabbit into the score of trees, not looking back even once. The sound of his footsteps faded, and it was just me and Elijah under that staring moon.

I fell backward, and curled into myself. I shut my eyelids so tight it hurt and hoped that everything would be gone when I opened them. I wanted everything to be gone. The river, the grass under my skin, and especially Elijah. 

As I hugged my knees, I imagined how lovely it would be to open my eyes and be back home. Yes, I would be in my room, with a pillow under my head instead of a dirt patch. My stack of Ramona and Little House books would be waiting for me, the Growing Pain's poster near my mirror would show those made-for-tv smiles, and my brother would somehow be worlds away. 

I got lost in my vision of home, trying to make the walls and furniture seem real enough to touch. It became so hypnotizing that I didn’t take heed of Elijah’s jump and footsteps until his hand was on me. I recoiled, unable to look at him or even speak. I felt him rub my shoulder. As you can probably imagine, such gentleness was baffling. 

“Chrissy, just breathe, alright?”

His voice was so low. Was he really trying to comfort me *now*? I tried to shake his hand off, still not daring to meet his eyes. I was too weak, as per usual. He kept breathing at a methodical pace, as if there was an invisible counter over our heads. I followed his example. He still terrified me, but I would have grasped onto anything at that moment. 

In, out. In, out. In, out. 

*In, out. In, out. In, out.* 

As I lay there exhaling with his arm sloped over me, my brother began to repeat himself. “Everything’s okay” he muttered over and over. His voice took on a rhythm of it’s own to match my breathing. He hugged me, and I finally gave in. 

“I won’t tell anyone” I whispered, my voice like a long shudder. I had made this kind of promise many times before, but this time I truly meant it. It was less a fear of consequence, and more of a deep guilt. Maybe my first. Somehow, just *being* here felt like I had carried out everlasting sin. 

My brother helped me to my feet, and I could see he wasn’t looking at me either. His eyes seemed glued to the grass and dirt under his feet. He picked up the flashlight, and we started to walk away from that river. Little by little, the sound of that rushing water grew faint, until it was completely muted. I found myself pushing my brother's arm forward a little. Going home, wanting home, needing home. 

“Chrissy?” 

I looked at him, *his* eyes still downwerds. There was a meekness to his voice, a shame that ran deeper than mine. 

“Y’know that book you wanted for Christmas? Ozma of Oz?” he asked.

My eyes began to sting again. Was he making fun of me? He must be, I thought. He’d always given me a bad time at home for my doll obsession, and he just couldn’t resist it here either. I wanted to turn around and punch him right where that rock had hit Kevin. I just might have tried, if it weren’t for what Elijah said next. 

“I, uh, got some cash last week from mowing the lawn, I think it should be enough to buy you one of those”. He looked at me, and he gave me a look I couldn’t recall seeing in him before. “You’d like that, right?”. He said it like a question, but I could tell it was really a command. 

And yet…

He sounded softer then usual, even softer than when he was getting me to stop crying. Like all the air had been taken out his lungs, and he was only now getting bits of it back. And yet, he still wanted me to know he would buy me that doll. 

“Yeah, I’d like that” I mumbled, a mix between sore and thankful as I thought about my brother giving me that Barbie. I already had one at home, but I had lost her only dress months ago, and the dog had left a score of bite marks on her legs. A quick curl Barbie would be shiny and new, and I would *keep* her that way. 

Once more, I looked up at Elijah. He wasn’t facing downwards anymore, and he seemed to be walking with more purpose now. I took particular note of his eyes. I could tell something was turning over behind them. Something was leaving.

I'll write more some other time, when I feel ready to. Thanks for reading.
