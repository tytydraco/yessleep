Tonight felt like a scene from a nightmare. During my watch, unsettling noises—moans and what sounded like a child’s giggle mixed with someone gargling—echoed from below deck. My investigation led me to a horde of small, shadowy creatures, no taller than 1.5 feet. They had scaly bodies and webbed hands and feet, their faces shrouded in darkness. Their eyes, reflecting the lantern light, sent a chill down my spine.

When confronted, these creatures seemed confused by my presence before quickly overpowering me and fleeing with our supplies. They vanished into the ocean, leaving me stranded and helpless on deck.

I rang the bell to alert the crew, but the damage was already done. We’ve lost valuable provisions, and these creatures’ connection to the sea troubles me deeply. Tomorrow, we must inspect the ship thoroughly and devise a plan to recover our supplies, if possible. What are these creatures, and why did they target us? This mystery weighs heavily on me, and I fear what other secrets the sea might be hiding.

Today, our inspection uncovered even more unsettling evidence. We found small, smooth black crystals hidden throughout the ship. These crystals are perfectly round and as black as night, exuding an unsettling aura.

We’ve collected and secured them, though their origin and purpose remain a mystery. I’ve instructed the crew to handle them with care. The ship’s log provided no answers, but I plan to consult experts or port authorities who might offer insights into these eerie objects.

The crew is growing increasingly anxious, and I share their unease. I fear these crystals may be linked to the creatures we encountered. I am determined to uncover their significance and ensure the safety of the De Zeewolf and her crew. For now, we remain vigilant, hoping these dark crystals do not signal further misfortune.

The early morning watch brought a scene of horror. I arrived to find three of our guards severely injured, their bodies covered in deep, painful bite wounds. The sight was deeply unsettling, and the men’s suffering was palpable.

Scattered around them were the same black crystals we discovered earlier. Their presence at the scene deepens the mystery. I have ordered the crew to secure the area and summon the ship’s medic. Their condition is dire, and we must act swiftly to provide aid.

As we secure the ship and investigate this attack, I remain vigilant for any further threats. The connection between the crystals and the attack cannot be ignored. I will document every detail and seek answers to this disturbing puzzle. The safety of the crew and the integrity of the ship are my top priorities.

The black crystals continue to defy explanation. Despite our efforts, they remain wet to the touch, regardless of exposure to fire. Their persistent moisture and strangely salty taste add to their enigma. Even the simplest tests suggest they challenge normal understanding.

The ship’s surgeon is intrigued but cannot offer a definitive explanation. The crystals seem intrinsically linked to the sea, which only deepens the mystery surrounding their origin and purpose.

I’ve documented every observation and am preparing to seek the wisdom of experts at the next port. Until then, we remain on high alert. The crew’s anxiety is mounting, and I share their concern. These crystals, with their eerie properties, may hold the key to understanding the strange events we’ve encountered. We must tread carefully as we continue our journey and uncover the truth behind these ominous artifacts.
