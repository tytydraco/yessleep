I was returning with the coffee my client requested when he burst out of the room, nearly knocking me over.

I leapt to one side, miraculously keeping the coffee from spilling. He charged straight toward the exit. Damn it, drama like this kept happening whenever my receptionist wasn’t around to help.

I swiftly placed the coffee on the nearest surface and ran after him.

“Julius!” (\*Not his real name).

He was emanating rage so tangible, I could almost see it smoking off his back.

He yanked the clinic door open and sprinted off.

I gave chase to the lift, but the lift door closed in my face.

I contemplated running down the stairs, but doubted I could reach him in time.

So I returned to the clinic, hurried towards my office. I needed to call his emergency contact, to try to keep him safe.

I opened the door, and came to an abrupt stop.

Julius was still seated in my office. He seemed calm, collected, with no trace of the rage he was emanating just a few moments before.

“What…what?” I stared blankly at Julius, then at the exit I just saw him leave from.

“You’ve a twin?” I was grasping at straws. I hadn’t seen anyone else enter my office. But then again, a twin could have snuck in while I was making the coffee.

“No, that was…” Julius hesitated. Then he sighed.

“I think you should take a seat,” he said.

Was I in a movie? Weren’t those words typically said by the police or doctors to people before they delivered bad news?

I took a seat anyway.

“Remember when we were talking about parts?”

I nodded. We had been discussing the different parts that each of us have, different parts of our minds that form who we are. There are protective parts, angry parts, insecure parts, and so on.

“Well, I talked about how I had an angry, aggressive part, who would sometimes take over, and whenever that part of me took over, I would lose control,” he continued.

I nodded again. “And we talked about you having a conversation with that part of you, to better understand that part’s role, beliefs, and so on,” I added. “What about it?”

“Well, while you were making coffee, I talked to it. Told that angry part of myself that it had to go.”

That wasn’t part of the plan. The goal of our therapy sessions wasn’t to get rid of any parts. It was to get to understand each part’s perspectives and experiences, to eventually integrate them. I was tempted to mention that, but that was not the issue at hand.

“Wait, okay, and?” I asked. I had a feeling I knew Julius’s answer.

“And so he left. That was him, that stormed out.”

“So…a part of you just…took shape. Took on a physical form and stormed out. Is that what you’re saying?”

Julius nodded and my heart sank. He was either hallucinating, deluded, playing a prank on me, or maybe I was hallucinating.

Maybe we both were hallucinating. I did see a Julius storm out, while this Julius sat right here in my office.

“Hey Julius, I know it’s still April, but if this is some April’s fool prank, I must say-”

“It’s not,” Julius cut in curtly. “When you talked about parts, I thought you understood.”

“Understood what?”

“My condition. My situation. That I have different parts of myself, and that they have their own lives and bodies.”

I bit my lip. I considered pressing the emergency button. I stared him dead in his eyes and saw the shining conviction in them. Cold sweat prickled at my neck.

“Parts therapy is just a form of therapy. It’s just a therapy that takes into account the multi-faceted nature of our mind. It addresses the many sides to our personality and self. I…I definitely did not mean actual separate people.”

“But in my case, that’s just what it is.” “If what you’re saying is true…”

“It is true!” Julius let out a frustrated sigh. “Watch this.”

“Hey Mopey,” he said. Mopey was his nickname for the sad, depressive part of himself. “Mopey, get out of my body now. Please. Just show her. She’s got to know you exist. Please, you have to make her believe me.”

Nothing happened. I smiled gently, trying to wipe any trace of awkwardness from the situation.

“Hey, Julius? It’s okay. Everything's -”

“Shut up, he’s coming out,” Julius snapped.

I stifled a sigh. Then blinked. And rubbed my eyes. Blinked again.

Julius was splitting into two. Right in front of my eyes. For a heartstopping moment, he resembled a pair of siamese twins, with two heads, four arms stuck to one lower half. Nausea roiled in my stomach. Then a pair of legs stepped out from the existing pair of legs.

“WHAT THE FUCK?” I yelled. My first swear word in front of this client. Or rather, these clients. I stared at the two men staring back at me.

The Julius that had stepped out from the other Julius looked exactly like him. But his shoulders were hunched, facial features pulled down in a look of abject misery, and he stood as if about to collapse from exhaustion.

“All right come back in,” Julius 1 said to Julius 2. Julius 2 paused for a long moment, looking down at the ground. Then, before my horrified fascination, he slowly lifted one foot, then the other, and trudged back into Julius 1.

I slumped back in my seat. “Holy…son of a mother. What’s going on?”

“I’ve lived like that all my life. I’ve different parts of me. Sometimes they take over what I call my main body, and I’m out of control. Other times, they simply step right out and do whatever the hell they want.” Julius breathed out a long sigh. “It’s such a relief finally telling someone about this. You have no idea the crazy shit, the lengths I’ve had to go to to hide their existence. ExistenCES,” he corrected himself.

“So…yeah…uh huh…” I said, my brain trying to make sense of it all. I wanted to run. To slap myself awake. I tried to rationalise what just happened. I couldn’t find any explanation.

Enough had happened in my life for me to know that the world wasn’t always as it seemed. Stranger things have happened in life.

“So, you have parts that can leave your body. And walk away. In physical forms. How does that even work? I mean, matter isn’t lost or created, right? How did you get enough flesh to form another body, and…does your brain multiply too? I-”

“I have no idea. Never tried to find out. Don’t want to end up in a lab.” Julius’s brows knitted, and a sly, cruel smirk seized his mouth. “And if you ever try to tell anyone, I’ll kill you.”

My eyes widened. I stood up, ready to run.

Julius’s face softened. “Sorry, I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean that. That was Darius.” Darius was the name Julius gave to what he called his “murderous part”.

It was similar to his angry part in that both were based on rage. But while his angry part liked to yell and throw tantrums, Darius, on the other hand, was cool-headed. He liked to take his time creating meticulous, intricate plans involving murdering those who displeased him.

It was one thing being told such things when you assumed someone was talking about a part of themselves, a dark side of their personality. It’s another when you realise they’re talking about an actual being that could step right out of them and rip your throat out.

“Uhm, tell Darius that well, I uhm, I won’t tell anyone about this…this condition. But if he keeps threatening me, well, then confidentiality is moot, and-”

Julius snarled, and a head leapt out of his head. For a stomach-turning moment, he had two heads. One with a cold, twisted smile, and another that was contorted in fear.

The fearful looking face shut its eyes, and grit its teeth. Then the second head got sucked back in, and they merged with an uncomfortably wet plop.

“I’m so sorry. I’ll try to keep him under control,” Julius said.

I choked down the nausea that arose.

I should have quit. I should have quit for good. Never should have come back. I should have just travelled the world, doing odd jobs or something to survive. Why the hell did I come back to be a psychologist?

“You can’t hurt her,” Julius hissed. I assumed he was talking to Darius.

I shut my eyes, and let resignation wash over me. Then I opened my eyes, and calmly sat down again.

“I see,” I said. I had reached my breaking point. Just like the past times when I had reached this point, something in me just shut down. The fear morphed into a heavy resignation. My shoulders slumped.

“So, now we got to get the angry you back, right?” I asked. “Have they ever escaped like that?”

“No, I’ve never told them to leave. But they have come out at inopportune times. Usually they know better than to come out with witnesses around. And they definitely have never appeared in front of more than one person, much less charged out into the streets.”

“So…others have witnessed this before…”

“Yes. But they tend to think that they’re losing it. You know? Especially since no one else was around, and I insisted nothing had happened.”

“Ah. Uh huh. Okay. Well. Welp. Okay.” I just sat there, mind grinding to a halt.

“We’ve got to get Darren back,” Julius said. Darren was the name he gave to his angry part.

What’s this “we” business, was what I wanted to say. But instead, I went, “Yes. We’ve got to get him back. Then work on integrating these different parts of you, not getting rid of any of them, so that you can, well, you know, not…have people jumping out of you.”

Julius frowned. “I came here to get rid of them. I don’t want to be sad. Or angry. Or murderous. Or insecure. I want to just be happy. At peace.”

“Nope,” I said, all my psychologist decorum gone. “Not possible. Not healthy. Not a single soul on Earth can claim to only ever be happy and at peace. Nope. Emotions are important. Each part of us serves a purpose. Exists for a reason. Blah, blah. The healthy thing to do is to help all parts live together in harmony, integrating into an adaptive whole.”

“So, you want the murderous part of me staying in my personality?” Julius asked.

I shrugged. “It’s scary, but many people have murderous parts. Our other parts usually help keep them in check.”

“I…” Julius looked like he was about to argue. Then his eyes lit up. “I know where Darren will be!” He pulled out his phone, and began typing feverishly. “He likes to go to this rage room when he’s angry. He likes to smash things.”

“Well…if you go there, what’s people gonna say about there being two of you?”

“Twins, of course. Like you said.”

“And triplets, if another of you emerges?”

Julius grinned. I frowned. He seemed to be enjoying this just a little too much.

“Please help me get him back,” he added, looking pleadingly at me. I considered terminating our therapy on the spot, and going home to take a nice long bath.

Then I sighed. “I’m charging by the hour.”

A very long story short, after a lot of bargaining, pleading, tears and whatnot, Julius got Darren back.

I honestly thought that I had a chance at having normal therapy sessions with Julius after that. That I could just ignore the fact that his parts could take on physical bodies.

By the next day, I knew I was wrong.

Julius showed up at my office, though he was booked in for next week.

“He’s gone,” was the first thing he said.

“Who?” I asked, dread pooling in my gut.

“Darius.”

Of course. Of course the one to escape and go MIA would be the worst possible one to do so. The murderous one.

“Do you know why?”

“He said he needed to be free. That he didn’t want to be integrated. He wanted to stay his own person. He didn’t want to be tethered to me anymore.” Julius shut his eyes. “I think he wants to kill people.”

“And why didn’t he start with you?” I asked. “Not being cruel, just curious.”

He shrugged. “Maybe he’s afraid that if I’m gone, he will be too.”

“Ah, okay.”

We were silent for a while. “Any idea who he’ll go after first?”

“You.”

Of course. Of, fucking, course.

“I didn’t even do shit to him,” I protested anyway. I didn’t care if I was being unprofessional. This situation was way out of my depth. “Can I just terminate our therapy and be done with him too?”

I know, I know. I wasn’t being kind. But I’ve been through a lot in my life. Too much, for me to want to put up with more of this stuff.

Julius smiled sadly. “I wish it were that easy.”

A chill ran down my spine at the way he said that. “You know something about his plans?”

“He has many. I’ve seen his mind. He has mapped out 47 possible ways of killing you. And about as many for all the different people he’s thought about killing.”

“Murdering,” I corrected.

“Murdering,” Julius agreed.

“I’m going to the police,” I said.

“And saying what?”

“I’ll just…” I trailed off. What the hell could I say? If I mentioned Julius at all, this Julius would be locked up. The murderous one would still be free.

And how was I going to explain any of this stuff to the police?

“I’m going overseas,” I said, with a firm nod.

Julius’s eyes lit up. “That would work! I have our…my passport. He has none. He can’t leave the country.”

“Uh huh!” My heart lifted. For the first time, there was a very simple solution to my problems. And it was an attractive solution. I got to go on vacation, while avoiding a murdering asshole.

“What country does he hate?” I asked. “Just in case.”

“I don’t know, anywhere without fancy hotels, I guess. I know his preferences.”

“Uh huh. Okay see you. I’m booking a flight to…wait I’m not gonna tell you. Just in case, you know?”

“I know,” Julius said. He paused. “I’m sorry I roped you into this. I’ll…I’ll try to get him back. So you can come home.”

“Sure, sure,” I said, distractedly. I was already booking my first flight. I would take a few connecting flights, just to make sure it was harder to be tracked. Who knew, maybe that Julius would steal the passport. Oh shit.

“Hey, do me a favour, get back home right now. Grab your passport, lock it somewhere Darius wouldn’t be able to access. Okay?”

Anxiety filled Julius’s face as he realised what I was worried about. “Yes,” he said, and turned to leave. “Goodbye, and sorry,” he said again, at the door.

“Not your fault. Not really,” I said.

Well, all that happened 2 months ago. For two months, I was basking in nature, far, far away from my country.

But I just flew home yesterday. Julius had texted, told me he had found Darius, convinced him to rejoin him in the same body.

I could finally come home, but well, I didn’t really look forward to it. It was fun, vacationing indefinitely.

But I needed to work, and my clients were waiting.

I’ve just unpacked and loaded up the laundry, and already I’m thinking about future therapy sessions with Julius.

Okay, there’s the doorbell. I think my pizza’s here.

Okay shit. First of all, shit.

It wasn’t pizza. It was Julius. He said he wanted to check on me, see how I am. That he had an important thing to share with me, that it couldn’t wait for office hours.

But I never told Julius my home address. How the hell did he find me?

And he seemed…off. Like he had plastered on a hollow smile that could fall off any moment.

I didn’t open the door, of course. But he’s still there. He’s not calling out my name anymore, but when I checked the peephole 5 minutes ago, he was still outside, smiling emptily.

I’m creeped out. Maybe I should call the cops.

I’ll give it 10 more minutes. If he doesn’t leave, I’ll call the cops.

Okay what the hell just happened? The pizza guy came, the actual pizza guy. I couldn’t open the door. Julius was still outside. But I needed to tip the delivery guy, get my pizza. I yelled at him to leave it at the door. Julius took the pizza from him, and said something to him that I couldn’t make out through the peephole.

The pizza guy reared his head back, as if attacked, then turned and walked rapidly away. Whatever Julius said had really freaked him out.

“Hey, this is unacceptable,” I called out. “I’m calling the cops.”

“Go ahead,” Julius said, in a cold, cocky tone. “Do that. You’ll see what happens to Kayla. And Julie. And your parents.” (All fake names, I need to protect them)

He then proceeded to read out their addresses.

“Oh,” he added after, “I think Kayla’s about to head out to walk Puffy”.

My breath caught in my throat. Was he monitoring them? Did he have surveillance cameras? I pulled up Kayla’s contact, ready to call her.

“Warn them, and they die,” Julius announced cheerfully.

It was like he could read my mind.

I didn’t know what to do. Every cell in my body tingled. I felt an irrational urge to fling the door open and strangle that smirk off his face. I wanted to call the police. But I couldn’t be sure Julius couldn’t get to my best friends, to my parents, before help arrived. What if…what if his other parts were out? Working for him?

“I’m not opening the door,” I yelled.

“If you say so,” Julius mocked in an oily, knowing tone.

I strode to my bedroom and slammed the door shut.

I need to warn them, that’s for sure. How could I do so, warn my friends and parents, without him knowing? How was he keeping track of them?

I should have made up emergency code words or signals with them. I had thought about that, after watching one too many horror movies, but hadn’t actually gotten around to that.

I saw the text from my receptionist then.

“Hey, I gave the police your number, they will be calling you soon. I’m sorry. It’s bad news. Your client, Julius, was found dead in his home. And his entire family was dead. They think he might have pulled a murder suicide.”

I felt the blood drain from my face. My legs gave way and I collapsed to the ground. I stayed there, like a puddle of bones and flesh, for a long time.

Julius was dead. His entire family was dead. Then this was…this was Darius. I had suspected that, but…I didn’t expect him to really kill off Julius. And the entire family.

My stomach twisted painfully, and all I could hear was the sound of my heart thudding away.

Julius. I hadn’t helped him. I had fled overseas, left him to deal with his murderous part, all on his own. Now he was dead.

Fuck. I had caused his death. His family’s death. Indirectly, but still. His blood was on my hands too.

I took in a few deep, slow breaths to calm my hammering heart. Then I crafted a message to my best friends and my parents.

“I’m in extreme danger from an unstable, dangerous client. You are too. He threatened to kill you. He’s monitoring you right now. In real time. I’m calling the police soon. But he will try to go after you. He may send others after you. The moment you see this message, get yourself somewhere safe. Call the police. Get all the help you can.  I love you. I’ll deal with this, and I’ll explain more when this is all over. Stay safe.”

I hesitated. I wasn’t ready to send it out.

I grabbed the kitchen knife, wrapped duct tape around the handle, and tried the grip. The duct tape provided better resistance. I read somewhere that many people got cut when they tried to stab others, because their hands slipped. The duct tape surface ought to help with that.

I locked my bedroom door, went into the bathroom, and locked that door too.

Then I sat down to complete this post. Because well, if I die, I want everyone to know what happened to me. The real story.

I picked up the phone to dial the cops, and Darius hollered from the doorway. “Don’t do it! Once you do, you’re done. I will kill you, and everyone you love.”

I thought for a moment that my neighbours may come to my rescue. He was loud. But then I remembered - they are overseas.

Okay. I just sent out the message. I’m calling the cops now.
