Hello everyone! I've been going through a really rough time lately. I don't browse reddit too often but after me not having an outlet to talk to anyone I figured I might vent my frustrations on here.

I've been on a bit of a horror binge recently. I don't think I'd have the guts to actually watch or read something, therefore hearing and watching a youtuber explain a horror story to me creates a safe environment and firm suspension of disbelief. Youtube story tellers allow me to appreciate the concept of horror without being too scared if that makes sense.

Albeit one story has begun to bother me a lot, despite the format. I don't remember who made the video, nor what it was called. 
It's a story told through the diary of a 11 year old girl named Amy, who lost her right eye when she was little, until one day she's able to suddenly see again.
At first it obviously seems like a miracle, but given it being horror, it takes a really dark turn when she begins to see organic matter, such as meat and plants with a faint red glow, and incredibly malicious writtings on the walls (I wish to not repeat what the writings say).

Given that her right eye is not physically there, she doesn't have a way of closing it, so it becomes very evident that the things she sees are fucking her up a bit. At one point she tries to stab herself with a needle, only to realize the needle is just uselessly scratching away at her empty eye socket

Every diary entry becomes more bleek and sad.
It was one of her last diary entries that kind of traumatized me.

"December 24th 1995

Dear Diary.

I asked my dad what a slave is. Dads face was weird. Dad said slaves are people who have to work even if they dont want to. Mom says to clean my room so I am a slave.
Dad asked me why I want to know. I did not say why. 

Today I found a eyeball"

I know it may seem really weak but for some reason that almost made me cry, really angry too.
Directly following the diary entry, the youtube video suddenly became a lot louder, not like a scream or a loud noise, as in the person in the video started yelling the script with an echo reverberating through the room. After about a 1 second the video became really quiet, the yelling being replaced by whispering, which then got replaced again by the yelling. 
That bullshit had me through the fucking roof. I immediately turned off the video with tears still rolling down my cheeks, being so startled that I didn't even hear what he was saying.

Looking back at it, I regret that because I kind of wished I could have shared the video to report it and not hearing the and of the story really had me contemplating the entire week. Searching for the video in my history showed no results. 

For the first time ever I got to understand what people mean when they say they feel watched after watching or playing something scary. 
Yes, I have gotten scared of random noises at night after watching something scary, but this feeling of something staring at me was (and still is) new.

Hearing all those bullshit things about how "you're actually being watched when you sense you're being watched" also did not help my mental state. I don't believe anything supernatural is happening. I'm a very "matter of fact" kind of person and I know it's all my brain playing tricks on me yada yada yada.

Tbh I'm just hoping I get to talk with someone about this or turn this into something pleasent.
And ffs if you know anything about that video i need you to hmu. The video was at around 50k views. It was one of those slideshow type creepy pasta story tellers. I'll make an update once I feel better.

Wish me a swift recovery.
