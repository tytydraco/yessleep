Christmastime is always extra special in the town of Clearview. Nearly every house in town is decked out in lights and tasteful holiday decorations—none of those inflatable Santas.

Even the shops in town get in on the magic. *Greenamyer's Chocolates* gives out free samples to passersby, and *Barb's Books and Self Storage* serves hot chocolate on tap. By the first week of December, anyone you pass on the streets of Clearview greets you with a "Merry Christmas!".

But like everything else in Clearview, there are a few Christmas traditions best enjoyed with caution. Most notably: the carolers.

They always come around at night, the evening of the first snowfall.

The rule for the carolers is simple: listen, but don’t look.

I never knew why. But whenever the carols drifted up the street, Mom and Dad would close all the blinds, shut the curtains, and call me into the living room. There we’d listen as the singing drew nearer, their festive voices swelling, seemingly on top of the house itself.

My parents smiled and bobbed their heads to the music, keeping the mood light. But the way their eyes flicked toward the covered windows told a different story. They understood something I didn’t.

Years passed. I got older. The routine changed. Eventually, they stopped calling me into the living room at all. Now they just shouted from down the hall that the carolers were coming—expecting me to shut my blinds, keep quiet, and wait for them to pass.

One year in high school, though, curiosity finally won.

I heard the carols floating through the falling snow, sweeter than ever, drawing close to my front door.

And that was when I decided: what harm is there in a little peek?

I crept to the window, a tingle running down my spine. Positioning my eye right against the molding, I parted the curtain a fraction of an inch—just far enough to see through.

I could hardly take in the scene before me. The heads of the carolers snapped in my direction, their mouths still moving in unison. Their eyes were locked onto mine, beckoning me outside. Beckoning me to join them.

Without thinking, without resisting in the slightest, I unlatched my window, opened it and stepped outside in my bare feet.

It wasn't until my feet were planted on the front lawn that I noticed any details about the carolers themselves. They were huge. At least eight feet tall, and wider than a normal person. Only their heads were exposed above their large cloaked bodies. Their eyes never left mine as they sang.

They were arrayed in rows, but each row was set back a good distance from the one in front of it. From the first caroler to the last, It was the entire distance of our front lawn.

I stood there for a moment in stunned, though rapt attention, until they stopped singing.

Seconds later they began a new song—slow, hauntingly mournful.

*God rest ye merry gentleman let nothing ye dismay…*

My feet carried me to the rhythm of the music toward the first row of two carolers—one a man, the other a woman. I couldn't stop, I couldn't slow down. The only conscious movement I could make was a slight turn toward one or the other of the carolers.

*Remember Christ our savior was born on Christmas day.*

I was drawing closer. The woman's face was friendlier than the man's so I headed towards her, unsure what I was being drawn into.

When I was mere feet from the woman, both cloaks dropped to the ground revealing two empty doorframes.

Well… almost empty.

While the man's door (which I could only look upon as I drew nearer to my own) was completely empty, the one I had chosen featured a long blade at head height running from the right side. I tried to turn out of the way as I drew nearer to the blade, but I couldn't.

The best I could do was shift my head slightly away, the blade slicing into my cheek as I walked past.

The pain of my fresh wound snapped my mind to my mistake.

The song was a clue… "God Rest ye Merry ***Gentleman***"—I should have picked the man.

I couldn't even wipe the blood dripping down my cheek as I continued my walk forward, toward the next row of singers.

They started up a new song.

*Silent night, holy night. All is calm, all is bright.*

The carolers were all holding candles. Perhaps that was it? Was I to look for the brightest candle?

I scanned the row, but could find no discernable difference in the brightness. My heart was racing as I drew nearer to the singers. I had little time to make my decision.

Then I noticed it. One of the carolers wasn't singing at all. She stared like the rest, but her mouth was shut.

I turned toward her, sure I had made the right decision. And as the cloaks dropped, I was happy I did. The other doors didn't feature a knife like the previous one had. Rather, each of the other doorways glowed as flames lapped through them into the snowy air.

But I walked through my door in safety.

Then the next song started.

*O come O come Emmanuel, and ransom captive Israel.*

*That stands in lowly exile here, until the son of God appears.*

Five carolers stood in a tight row, while the sixth stood a few feet to the left of the rest.

*Standing in exile? That must be it. But was it too easy?*

I anxiously scanned row of carolers before me for any other possibilities, but ultimately resigned myself to the *exiled caroler.* And it turned out to be the correct choice.

As I turned to see what was in the doors I had avoided, but I could see nothing but utter darkness through the empty frames.

There was one more row. If you could call it that.

One lone caroler stood, nearly at the street, his arms stretched out toward me.

A new song started up, mostly from behind me now.

*We wish you a merry Christmas.*

*We wish you a merry Christmas.*

*We wish you a merry Christmas.*

*And a happy new year.*

There were no choices to make. My legs carried me forward toward whatever was in store behind that final cloak.

The singing continued as I approached. But this time, the cloak never dropped. The woolen material brushed against my face as I passed through.

All went dark and silent.

The next thing I knew I was in my room with a wrapped box sitting in my lap.

I took a minute to collect myself, and clean the blood off my face. And though I wasn't sure I should, I sat back down and unwrapped the box.

Inside were two items.

The first was another box, this one wooden. It was locked, with a large keyhole in the front.

The other was a set of caroling robes.

And the following December, just as the first snow was falling, I felt the urge to try them on.
