**I had been warned.** Warned of the consequences of my actions, the consequences of my words, and the consequence of my heart. But I had been too fucking stupid to pay attention. Too consumed by my own desires, too focused on my own ambitions, I had strolled down a path that had led me to one helluva shit sandwich.

I had been in love. It had been like a fire in my veins, the thought of her consuming my every waking moment. I was sure with her, I could do anything. We were going to be unstoppable, nothing could hold us back. But I had been wrong. 

When we called it quits, the fire in her eyes had been different. It had been burning with hatred and pain, pain I had caused. I knew, in that moment, I had thrown myself off the deep end. I had signed my own death certificate.  For she had cursed me. Cursed me with a fate worse than death. Cursed me with becoming something loathsome, something repulsive. Cursed me with transmogrifying into a pile of excrement. 

At first, I didn't believe it. I figured she had just spoken in the heat of the moment and her words held no weight. Boy, was I wrong. As time went on, I could see the change happening. My skin was shifting to a greenish-brown hue, my bones starting to dissolve into jelly, my mouth stretching as if something was trying to escape. People screamed at the sight of me, nauseous at the transformation. 

The transformation had become irreversible. I had become a beast of burden, a loathsome creature that had once been a man. I called out to her, begging her to break the curse, to have mercy on me. But her heart was hardened, not a spark of humanity in it. 

With no other option, I hid away, praying to God this transformation would end. But it never did. My limbs became shit, my torso seeping excrement, my eyes turning a dull yellow unable to do nothing but watch as I slowly became a mound of shit. I was becoming a prisoner in my own body. As the transformation moved into its final stages, I knew I had but moments left on this Earth. 

And yet, in the midst of all this shit, I still remembered her. I remembered the love we had shared, the plans we had made. I remembered the warmth of her embrace, the sparkle in her eyes. I remembered the smell of her hair, the sound of her laughter. I cursed her for cursing me. I cursed her for not understanding the power of her own words. But it was too late. 

Soon I shall cease to exist, my story told only by the memories of others. People who whisper of the man transformed into a pile of excrement by a cursed love. I fear that soon I shall be forgotten, that soon I shall be but a lesson for generations to come. 

So before I am no more, I write this as a warning. A warning to all those who comes after me. A warning of the consequences of love, of the consequences of passion, of the consequences of words. Understand what you say, for it can bring about a fate worse than death. **A fate I have suffered, and all for a moment of love.**
