The first few shots were free. The first taste always is.

But addiction—true addiction—demands sacrifice.

I didn’t realize it at first. My body functioned on a loop, repeating the same steps: wake up, eat, stare at the walls, call the clinic. But after my last appointment, when they injected that cold fire into my veins, the routine changed.

Now, when my body dialed the clinic, the receptionist’s voice was different—smoother, more expectant.

“Your payment is due.”

My body hesitated. My lips parted, but I didn’t know what would come out.

“I don’t… have the money.”

I didn’t say that. But I heard it in my voice. Felt the rasp of my own breath as it pushed the words out.

The receptionist sighed. A long, slow exhale.

"There are other ways to pay."

My body didn’t ask what they meant. It simply nodded.

And that’s when the hunger started.


---

It wasn’t hunger like before. Not the dull emptiness of a missed meal, not even the deep ache of starvation. This was a hollowing. A void gnawing through my ribs, burrowing into my marrow, whispering in a voice that wasn’t mine.

At first, my body just stood at the window, watching. Shadows stretched unnaturally along the walls, too tall, too thin, bending like they had bones that weren’t meant for walking. Their faces—if they had faces—twisted and writhed, mouths splitting open too wide, revealing teeth like shattered glass.

They whispered to me, clicking and chittering in a language I couldn’t understand.

I wanted to believe it was the psychosis. I wanted to believe the drug was warping my perception, that none of this was real.

But my body responded to them.

It whispered back.

"I’ll do what’s needed."

And so it did.


---

The first time, it was just a wallet.

Some drunk, stumbling out of a bar, too wasted to notice the thing wearing my skin as it followed him down a quiet alley. My hands moved without hesitation, sliding a switchblade from my pocket—when had I started carrying that?—and pressing it to his ribs.

"Give me your cash," my voice said, low and cold.

The man muttered something, barely able to stand. He didn’t resist. He just dropped his wallet and backed away.

My hands trembled.

Not from hesitation.

From pleasure.

Something in me—something deep and dark and wrong—shuddered in delight. My throat vibrated with a chuckle, low and wet, a sound that didn’t belong to me.

And then I felt it.

Something shifting beneath my skin.

Like fingers pressing outward from the inside of my ribs.

The shadows behind me twitched, stretching, curling in anticipation. I wasn’t just paying my debt. I was feeding them.

And they were still hungry.


---

Stealing turned to hurting.

Hurting turned to taking.

By the time I blinked back into awareness, my body was standing in a dimly lit apartment, staring at a bloodied handprint smeared across the wall. My fingers twitched, aching from use. My mouth was coated in something thick, metallic.

The hunger was gone.

In its place, a sick, perfect satisfaction.

I didn’t want to know what I had done.

I didn’t want to know whose blood was drying beneath my fingernails.

But the shadows swayed around me, whispering, You did well.

And deep inside, trapped behind my own eyes, I knew—this was just the beginning.


---

The next time my body dialed the clinic, it wasn’t to ask for an appointment.

It was to beg.

My voice was hoarse, ragged. "Please. I need more."

The receptionist chuckled softly.

"Good. That means it’s working."

I felt myself sinking further. Drowning inside my own flesh.

"Just one more," my body pleaded. "Just one more dose."

The line crackled.

"You know the cost."

And my body nodded.

It understood.

It was ready.

Inside, I screamed.

And the shadows laughed.
