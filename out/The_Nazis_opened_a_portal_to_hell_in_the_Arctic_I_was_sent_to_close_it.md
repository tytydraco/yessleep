The sun was setting over the horizon as she brought me another drink. A pretty waitress, dark skin, long black hair tied back in a ponytail, flowers around her neck. I was having trouble deciding which was more beautiful, dusk over the ocean or her. My entire mind was telling me it was the latter. After everything I’ve been through though, I couldn’t get the nerve to ask for her number, even as she flashed a coy smile at me and turned to walk away. 

Everything was perfect. The sunset, the drink, finally being on a damned vacation after working my ass off for the collective these past two decades… not a worry in sight.

Except I could hear this nagging sound. High pitched ringing, right below the surface of my mind. It was constant, wouldn’t leave no matter how many times I tried swatting away an unseen bug. Oh hell…

I woke up, my phone ringing off the damned hook with that one dreaded word showing me exactly who was calling- work. Letting out a groan, already missing the beach and pretty girl bringing me drinks, I picked up and hit the green button.

“Yeah, what’s up?” I asked, knowing that it was probably going to be some more insanity. Never a day off in this line of work. 

“There’s a car waiting for you outside. We need you to come in ASAP.” The voice on the other line was short and to the point. 

“Another tear?” I tried asking, knowing there wasn’t going to be any answer but pushing my luck anyway. Their only response was silence. Checking the screen, they had already hung up. “Of course, good talk.”

Even though I didn’t want to, I rolled out of bed, standing up and stretching before pulling curtains aside to look out. There, waiting on the street, was a black SUV, lights on just waiting for me to step out and get in. God, I hate it when they pull this secretive government agency bullshit. It’s so… melodramatic. Hell, the HQ is only a couple miles down the road, I could easily get there within a few minutes if they just asked me to. Instead they have to send these stupid cars that make it look like I’m going to get kidnapped with a bag over my head to never be seen again. 

Just for the hell of it, I made them wait while I grabbed coffee and got dressed. Hell, the driver is probably getting paid by the hour, they should thank me. It’s not like Collective higher ups are going to give a damn if I’m a few minutes late anyway, right? Not to mention it’s three in the damn morning, so my restful sleep and nice dream got interrupted. I at least need some coffee as compensation.

The driver didn’t say anything to me as I got into the car, just started driving me towards downtown. I sipped my coffee as we went, curious about what kind of fresh hell the Collective was calling me in for at this hour. Think I’m going to demand some vacation time after this, no matter how small time the job may be. I’ve earned it, dammit. Especially after all that I’ve done with the Cognizant program and closing up these damned dimensional tears. God, please don’t let this be another Tear. A reality Aberration that’s come through to our world, that I can deal with. A whole Tear in the fabric of reality though, I’ve only got so many of those left in me before they take me out for good. Hopefully they at least give me a good team for this one if that’s the case.  

The Collective HQ was a tall, unassuming building in the middle of downtown. A little sign on the front had it labeled as a marketing agency, though I have no clue if there was any marketing business run out of the upper floors. Hell, I have no idea why the building is so tall. Everything that we worked with in the Collective was underground, in a massive network of tunnels and sub-basements right below our feet. This place stretched for miles, and held unspeakable horrors from the Aberrations that we had put away in years past. If this place ever came under attack or fell in some way… well, humanity isn’t far behind. In our universe, at least. 

The driver parked on the curb, still not saying a word as the doors unlocked and I stepped out. Humid, hot air rushed past me as I quickly walked towards the building, pushing through the double doors and making my way across the lobby to the elevator. The usual spot, sub-basement four, lit up as I scanned my badge on the elevator console. 

A brief hum and stutter, then the elevator was heading down. It opened into the same off-white, fluorescent lit hallways that I’ve been seeing for the past twenty years. Hell, I don’t think I remember a time before the Collective at this point. Just endless chases to close Tears and capture Aberrations. The hallway was almost always empty here, despite the constant bustle that this place has going on. After a few minutes of walking alone, I finally saw an older man standing outside one of the briefing room doors.

“Agent Harker, good to see you again.” Ronald, the old man, stuck out a hand to shake. I took it, giving one good grip before letting go and following him into the room as he started speaking. “Though I’m sure you can’t say the same. Always some new shit show when we have to call you in.”

“Interrupted a nice dream I was having.” I grunted, taking a seat at the small table and opening the folder he threw down in front of me. For a second I thought the pictures inside were black and white, but after starring for a moment I realized I was looking at a bleak, icy landscape. “So where are you sending me?”

“Arctic.” Ronald said, sitting down across from me. “We have a hell of a problem. Pardon the pun.”

Scanning over the file I started to put together what he was talking about. Arctic research base, studies in occult powers that opened a Tear between dimensions… Jesus, the Nazis?

“Been a while since I’ve seen these bastards involved in anything. How the hell was a Nazi base still holding out in 2025?” I asked, looking up at him.

“Honestly I’m as surprised as you are. We only just found out about this place from a defector that showed up on our doorstep. Said there’s been this faction of the SS out there since before Hitler, apparently they just holed up and didn’t leave after he decided to have himself a little lead snack down in that bunker. Kind of became their own thing, looking for ways to bring him back through unnatural processes.” Ronals said, leaning back in his chair and lighting up a cig. “Sure as shit, they found a way, too.”

“You’re fucking with me. I’m hunting down Hitler?” I asked, looking up at him from the files.

“If only it was just that. God, what a clusterfuck.” Ronald shook his head now, leaning forward and taking a long drag off his cigarette before going on. “They opened a portal to hell, Harker.”

“Oh, come on.” I said, pushing the file away and rubbing my eyes. It was way too early in the morning for shit like this. “So this isn’t just a Tear we’re dealing with but a straight up hellscape.”

“Yes, and it’s spreading. The longer the portal is open, the more ground it starts to cover. Currently it’s infected a five mile radius from the base. Thankfully they put the damned thing in the Arctic instead of somewhere on their home turf at the time.” He replied.

“How long has it been open for that it’s taken up that much space?” I feel like I already knew the answer. “And how long until it spreads beyond the wastes out there?”

“It’s been a week according to our source.” He said, another long drag on the cig. “And according to calculations, we have a month before it starts creeping towards the shores of Greenland and Northern Canada. So we’re on a major time crunch.”

“Oh hell.” I muttered, to which Ronald let out a dry laugh.

“Quite literally, yes.” He responded. “You’ll be going in with a three person team. One occult specialist, Vera, will be able to close the portal through a ritual. The other two, Pitt and Marcus, will be your muscle and demo experts. I’ve also given approval for the defector to go with you as a guide. Her name is Selene. Quite a nice woman, surprisingly, said she always wanted to get out of the cult but had no way to escape until now. Watch out that she doesn’t double cross you.”

“Think she will?” I asked, eyeing him. Ronald usually had a good nose for things like treason and betrayal, but I also knew he had a history of being soft on pretty women. From the picture of her in the file, she was definitely in that category. Early thirties, long dark hair, deep green eyes, and a soft face that had definitely been through some shit. With any luck, she was telling the truth and just wanted out of the hell hole she escaped from. Worst comes to worst, she dies with the rest of them when we close the portal.

“I certainly hope she doesn’t. She could be a valuable asset.” He said, stamping out the now spent cig in an ashtray on the table. “Speaking of assets, nothing leaves this place, understood? No liabilities. No survivors.”

“Woah, woah. Hold on. You said this was basically a compound right, families and stuff? You know I don’t kill kids. Not doing it.” I said, starting to stand up and looking him right in the eyes.

“You don’t have to worry about killing any kids. How do you think they opened the portal?” He said, getting up and opening the door for me. I just stared at him for a moment, dumbfounded. All he could do was nod, closing his eyes and brushing his hair back while reaching in his pocket for another cig. “Yeah, ask her about what happened on your way there. It’s… well, I don’t use the term ‘fucked up’ lightly, y’know.”

I left the room, heading downstairs to the armory where I could pick out whatever weapons and ammo might be needed for the situation. To my surprise, the rest of the team was already waiting down there. Vera, a woman my age with dark auburn hair and slender frame, gave me a wave as I walked in. We worked together before on a Tulpa case down in New Orleans years ago, and I’m pretty sure she saved my ass more than once on that trip. The others, Pitt and Marcus, looked like the number 10 standing next to each other. Pitt was tall, wiry, with a big bald spot beginning to show on his head even though he was barely past his thirties. Pitt meanwhile was one of those guys that looked like he was heavyset, but was really just an insane amount of muscle disguised by his build with a massive bushy beard to match. They were taking guns and explosives off the walls, stuffing them into tactical bags as preperation. I made my way to Vera for a rundown on what they had so far.

“Got the essentials?” I asked. She just nodded in response, tossing me a jar of clear liquid.

“Holy water. I’ve already put in an order for all our ammo to be dipped and consecrated while they’re at it, too. Ronnie give you the run down on what we’re after already?” She replied. 

“Nazis, a hell gate, the frozen tundra of the arctic… I’ve played Wolfenstein before, we’ll be alright.” I sighed. She just chuckled.

“If only it was that easy.” She said. 

“Look, if we run into Mecha-Hitler then I’ll worry.” I joked, half-flirting with her. I tried to stay away from inter-work relationships but she was… wow. Not much else to say there. Her smile was dazzling. 

“Think you two can wait to fuck after the mission is over?” Pitt shouted across the room. I flipped a middle finger at him as Vera just laughed, turning back to her work. In her tac bag I saw the usual arsenal for fighting off the unholy- holy water, a couple of crosses, and quite a few old, dusty books with strange runes on the front. Likely Aramaic, used for casting the rituals to close the portals. Or open them, if that’s something one was stupid enough to try. 

“Where’s the defector?” I asked, looking around now. My question  was answered almost immediately, she was sitting next to one of the far walls, staring straight ahead as if there was nothing going on around her. Poor woman had that vacant, thousand yard stare that I’ve seen so many times on these missions after something bad has happened. “Jesus, she looks rough.”

“Yeah, she’s been through some shit.” Vera replied. 

We continued preparing in relative silence, gathering weapons, ensuring we had everything possible we may need to face the threat of hell we were walking into. After about two hours, we were ready. Heading up to the roof, a chopper was waiting for us, ready to fly us over to the airport for the long flight ahead. It was a short ride, everyone sitting in quiet as the hum of the blades above drowned out any attempt at conversation. When the airfield appeared, a cargo jet was waiting for us, already loaded with comms equipment so we could report back to HQ as needed for backup or just to send updates. We loaded in, taking off not long after. We all sat, saying nothing as the ground was left far behind, the relative safety of home with it. 

“So… you were a Nazi?” Marcus asked Selene almost point blank, breaking the silence as we flew. Pitt let out a laugh as Vera just groaned.

“Don’t antagonize her, Marcus. She’s the one guiding us when we get there.” I said.

“No, it’s fine.” Selene replied. Her voice was soft, quiet. A slight tinge of a German accent underlying her English. “I was born as one of them, yes. Now, I want all of them to burn.”

“Hell yeah, I’ll drink to that.” Marcus said, raising a small flask. Vera smacked it from his hand, spilling an unknown spirit all over the floor. “Hey, that was my only one!”

“You’re about to go on a very dangerous mission where all of us are risking our lives. You can handle being sober until we make it back alive. Jesus…” Vera scolded him, making him turn bright red under the bushy beard. She turned back to Selene, “What made you want to get out?”

“I grew up hearing all about the glory of the Reich, being told that we were the ones who were going to restore power to this world.” She started, sitting forward with a sigh. “Do you have any idea what it’s like growing up and never seeing the sun? It’s cold up there. We were told we could never go outside, never let the corruption of the world in. We were told we had to stay pure for the day the Fuhrer returned.”

“Oh, here we fucking go…” Pitt whispered, grabbing Marcus’ flask from the floor and tipping it up to his mouth for any dregs of alcohol he could manage. 

“When I was twenty I was chosen. I was one of the ones who would keep the Fuhrer’s legacy alive, even after he had been gone for decades. Through some of our scientists, I was given a child, a beautiful daughter I named Annaliese. She was strong, beautiful. I raised her to be kind and caring to those around her. She was the only warmth I ever felt in that cold compound. So long as she was near me, the light of a thousand suns paled in comparison. Then… then they took her from me.” She said, eyes going cold as small tears began to form in the corners. “These… these bastards. They held me back as I screamed and clawed at them to let me go, let me take her from there. I saw them lead her into a circle with the other children and slit her throat, spilling blood onto the gateway. They traded her life for power, without ever thinking that she could be destined for greater things…”

She broke down crying now as Vera moved over to put a hand on her shoulder. Choking back tears, Selene continued.

“I swear that I will slit their throat myself.” She whispered now, tears ending as she came back to being cold and detached. “They have taken the only sunlight I’ve ever known. I shall make them feel the cold absence of the sun for eternity in return.”

“Fuck. That’s metal.” Marcus let out a low whistle as I kicked him in the shin, shushing him in the process.

“Estimated arrival in five hours.” A voice came over the plane comms. 

“Alright. Everyone get some rest and be ready to go as soon as we reach the destination, got it?” I said, getting nods from the rest. I sat back in the hard seat, closing my eyes and leaning my head back, letting the hum of the wind outside lull me to the last peaceful sleep I may ever get.

—

“Holy shit, look at that.” I could hear Pitt shouting as the plane went through turbulence, shocking me awake in my seat. I rubbed sleep from my eyes, shaking my head as the weight of exhaustion tried to close them again. Pitt shouted again, “Harker, seriously. Come over here and look!”

“Yeah, yeah, on my way…” I said, getting to my feet and desperately trying to stay steady as the plane lurched to one side.

“Oh hell, it’s coming at us!” Marcus shouted, diving past me back to his seat. 

“The hell are you talking about?” My question was barely out before I got to the window and saw for myself. “I’ll be damned.”

A massive creature was flying right beside our plane, at least the half the size of the cargo jet we were on. It was… well, I don’t think there was any way it was friendly. Long, leathery wings, held it aloft, flapping in the cold air. It’s head was vaguely human, with a pointed, reptilian snout that ended in slits. A jaw full of sharp teeth was set under, but the biggest thing that stood out was twofold- eyes that looked like they were at the same time black as soot and blazing with fire. Atop its head were massive, curling horns that looked like they could easily gore through a horse and keep going if it chose to. I swear it looked directly at me before diving at the plane again, side swiping it with a massive, humanoid hand that ended in sharp claws. We could hear metal tear as it breached the hull, sending the plane careening off in the other direction for a moment. 

“Everyone hang onto something, we’re going down!” The pilot came over the PA with a warning right as the demon made another swipe, this time cleaving the wing straight off of the plane. Alarms began blaring as we quickly began to tip forward, gravity taking hold as pilots desperately tried to keep us steady. I could feel the plane trying to spin, keeling one way as the demon let out a screech that could be heard over the wind and blaring alarms, full of anger, pain, and hatred all at the same time. 

“Strap in!” I shouted at the others as we all dragged ourselves to seats. Working against multitudes of G-forces that were trying to throw me every way possible, I managed to get back into the seat and pull the belt over my body. There was nothing else I could do but close my eyes, grit my teeth, and pray we didn’t end up as a bloody smear on the ice outside. The howl of the demon came through the hull again, telling us that even if we made it out of this there was more to contend with if we just wanted to survive.

Sounds of wind mixed with the alarm as we spun faster and faster. One of the others, I think Pitt, started making retching noises as we went down, spewing up whatever little food he had in his stomach alongside the alcohol. I held on tight, trying to ensure my body wasn’t too tense because it would only make the impact even worse when we finally hit the ground. 

“Alright, we’re coming in hot. I’m going to give them a little surprise though, I can see the base!” the pilot said over the comms before another ungodly sound of metal tearing interrupted him. The plane pulled to one side, leveling out for a brief second before we could feel ourselves drop through the air once more. Just for a moment, there was peace. The next moment we were all jolted by the impact as the plane hit the ground, throwing debris everywhere.  

I was knocked out, though only for a few minutes, I think. When I awoke the alarm was still blaring, but Vera was standing above me, desperately trying to undo my seatbelt and pull me from the wreckage. Looking around, I could see the others all still alive, working to get their equipment from the quickly burning wreckage as flames began to catch. I got my wits about me, walking out of the downed plane and seeing where we crashed. 

The moment the arctic cold hit me I was ready to throw myself back in the flames. The others walked out beside me, looking at the small building we had crashed maybe fifty feet from with just one double door on the side as an entrance. We looked back to see the pilot clambering out of the cockpit, heading our way as we heard the hellish screech from above. That thing was coming back around, looking for any survivors that it could tear apart with those wicked claws.

“Don’t worry about equipment, we need to get the hell away from that thing!” I shouted, pulling a pistol from my side and starting to run for the doors. The rest got the idea, including Selene, and broke out into a desperate spring towards the bunker entrance. We all hit the door at once, trying to force it open as the demon came diving from above. As Marcus and Pitt pushed against the iced-over mechanism on the door, I pulled back, firing a shot at the demon to try and distract it. The pilot did the same, running off a few feet to try and distract so the rest of us could get in. “No, don’t go to far!”

My warning didn’t come nearly fast enough. Before we knew it, the pilot was gone, spirited into the air while sharp claws dug into him. The demon was carrying him in the lower claws where its feet were, and when it got up to a decent height above us, it made sure we knew what our fate would be if it got claws on us too. The damned thing grabbed the pilot by both feet, taking one in each hand, and pulled apart like he was a fucking wishbone, tearing him clean in half down the middle. Blood rained down, steaming in the cold arctic air before painting the icy tundra below in a terrible splatter.

Hell with this. I made my way to the door, giving it a few good kicks to break the ice loose on the mechanism before it burst inward, warm air rushing out to meet us as the demon began to dive back down in our direction. We all ran in, throwing the doors closed behind us just as the demon crashed into them, almost coming right through if not for its enormous size.

We wasted no time running further in, straight down the staircase in front of us to get the hell away from not only the freezing cold, but the thing that was now bashing at the door, desperately trying to get in so it  could tear us apart just like the pilot. After two flights of stairs going straight down, we stopped to catch our breath, everyone letting out massive gasps as we struggled for air. Safe, if only for a moment.
