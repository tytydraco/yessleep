Recuring dreams are something I’ve always been fascinated by. Since I myself have experienced this phenomenon countless times, I’ve become quite invested in them. There’s a few different subreddits and communities dedicated to this topic, and a lot of people shared some interesting things. The ones that especially fascinate me are the accounts of those who claim to dream the same or similar things; and in this instance it’s a place that I and others refer to as ‘the Dreamscape Halls’.

Before reading any further, it’s crucial I make you aware of the risks associated with this. I won’t pretend to fully understand why, but there is some evidence to suggest that those who learn of this phenomenon can go on to experience it themselves. If you’re familiar with the SCP foundation and it’s lore, then this is similar to what they call a cognitohazard: something that can spread simply through knowledge of it’s existence. To me it’s also sort of like when you buy a car and start to suddenly notice that same car everywhere; like your horizons have suddenly broadened. Just please be aware that by reading about this, that means it may also happen to you.

If you’re still here, then I hope you know what you’re agreeing to.

Over the years I’ve browsed many websites, subreddits and personal blogs related to dreams. The mention of the dreamscape halls are few and far between, but I have found several people who have reported having them. As far as I can tell, there are not a lot of commonalities between them, but there are overlapping descriptions which seemingly are reported time and time again.

Most start by describing the dreamscape halls as an expansive, seemingly never-ending maze of hallways and rooms. Usually, these halls take on aspects of a retro, early 20^(th) century hotel with polished wooden floors, black and white photographs and décor reminiscent of western Europe pre-World War 1.

Many describe these dreams as incredibly vivid, and almost always with the dreamer being lucid and in control of their own actions. Some have even sworn that these dreams feel more real than reality itself. The dreamer is almost always struck by a subtle fear which lingers throughout the duration of their dream. They describe feeling unnerved, apprehensive and reticent to act.

“Mike” was the first person who ever described his experience to me, and one of the main reasons for my eventual passion in researching the topic. When we spoke, he said it had been a few years since last he dreamt of it, but claims the memory was as vivid as the day it happened.

His initial memory of the event was finding himself in an unfamiliar room. He wasn’t laying down either, he just said one second he was laying in his own bed, and the next he was standing in this place which he had no recollection of arriving in.

Around him was the rationalist boutique-style room of what appeared to be an early 1900’s hotel. Shimmering wooden floors were covered by several Tuscan rugs with ornate spiraling patterns. The pewter walls were adorned with a good dozen black and white photographs of men, women and groups of people with impassive expressions.

Mike turned to inspect the room, and found a window behind him covered with gossamer, cotton-Chintz curtains. He moved towards them and opened them, finding a window behind it, but something wasn’t right. There was nothing beyond the window; just a black void which seemed to stretch infinitely in every direction. Mike described the void as almost ‘flowing’ outside; like the entire structure he found himself in was submerged in an ocean of crude oil.

He thought about opening the window, but says it didn’t seem like a good idea. Instead, he approached the closed door which was marked by the number 709 hanging above the peephole. Mike glanced through the eye slot, seeing nothing but an empty hallway beyond. After another few moments of inspection he took a deep breath and opened the door.

Outside the room he found a hallway with auburn carpeting which spread a significant distance in both directions. He said both hallways had to have been at least a few hundred feet long. On his left, he spied a separate perpendicular hallway about one hundred feet away. The vicinity was eerily silent, devoid of any of the sounds of the usual sounds one would expect from a hotel such as plumbing or ambient occupant noise.

Mike had no idea he was dreaming by this point; and said he believed wholeheartedly that he had somehow just awoken in this unfamiliar place that was starting to make less sense by the minute.

He began walking left down the hall, stepping as carefully as he could to try and minimize any noise he produced. He passed two other doors on his right and left which were marked as room 707 and 708. He paused and listened, but heard nothing from either of them. He thought about knocking on one of them but ultimately decided against it.

He continued moving past several more doors marked with correlating room numbers. In the distance he had steadily begun hearing a rhythmic noise which sounded like the ticking of a clock. He reached the opposing, adjacent hallway a moment later and paused to glance down it.

The hallway looked near identical to the first, but about 40 or so feet down the corridor the architecture seemed to morph. Mike walked towards it, and felt his confusion grow with every step. He described the hallway as ‘beginning to twist like a corkscrew’. There was a 20-foot section which just looked as though someone had twisted the building in opposing directions several times before setting it back in it’s initial position.

As he got near, he realized it was far stranger than that. The pictures on the wall also seemed to have been elongated and twisted like the walls they hung upon. He said the pictures showed people with elongated mouths and widened eyes among other unnerving features. Something about it felt foreboding to him, and so he turned back.

As he did, the door on his right suddenly rolled open. Mike froze, with his heart beating a million miles a minute. He heard and saw nothing from within. He eventually mustered the courage to approach, finding a stairwell on the other side. He stepped inside, and glanced down. He said it extended farther than he could even see. He glanced up, and found the same to be true. He compared it to when you stand between two mirrors and see the sort of infinite reflection effect. Both directions just seemed to go on forever.

Suddenly he heard a loud bang below him like someone slamming a door. He flinched and glanced down once more, but didn’t see anything. He said then that he was struck by this overwhelming sense of impending doom. Without even really thinking he began running up the stairwell.

After a few floors he found a door that looked different than the others. Rather than grey slate it was an oak wood finish, looking like it was plucked right out of a homestead cabin or something. He felt drawn to it, and grabbed the handle to fling it open.

Sure enough, inside was what appeared to be the family room of a quaint cottage. A fire crackled in the fireplace, while the taxidermy heads and pelts of several animals hung on the walls. Mike closed the door behind him as he heard footsteps approaching from below. He backed away slowly, and heard something reach the door outside.

Mike said next thing he remembers is falling out of his bed in a stark panic. In a haze he glanced around as his eyes struggled to adjust to the light. He felt quite confused, but soon breathed a sigh of relief when he finally realized all of it had just been a dream. Though, he admitted that the vivid dream continued to linger in his mind after that.

That was the first I’d ever heard of the dreamscape halls, but it was far from the last. After Mike posted his experience on a public forum, he had others message him to attest to their own similar experiences.

I spoke with several of these people myself, and a lot of them shared with me similar accounts to Mike. Most of those who shared their testimonies seemed unnerved by the experience, and didn’t know what to make of it. I think it was both comforting and worrying that they found others who had experienced the same type of phenomenon.  

Another user ‘Valerie’ and I began communicating quite a lot from there. Just as with Mike, she too had dreamed of this odd place, and her story was equally as fascinating.

She recalled her first experience to me in much a similar fashion as Mike had. She suddenly had found herself in an unfamiliar room, but unlike Mike, she described the setting quite differently. She said it looked like some sort of lab, complete with porcelain drawers, cold metal countertops and polished linoleum floors. Several oxygen cylinders sat on one wall with various other mechanical apparatuses she later identified as IV stations. On the opposing wall were four stainless steel sinks with various beakers, measurement cups and Erlenmeyer flasks within.

She didn’t recognize the place, and even now swears she’d never seen it before in her life; at least not one that looked exactly how she described it. There were no windows in the room, but there were two doors on the same wall but opposing ends of the room. She approached the one on the left, but found it was only a storage closet with cleaning supplies.

The second door on the right opened up into a hallway, and once she stepped out her confusion only grew. Contrary to the lab she’d awoken in, the hallway was comprised of wooden floors with Persian rugs running down the center. In both directions the hall seemed to span several hundred feet.

Valerie paused there, feeling the anxiety spike within her. The area was eerily silent, but again, she too seemed to gradually notice the sounds of ticking in the distance. With no real direction to go off, she decided to simply walk down the hallway to the right. She spied other doors lining the hallway as she walked, but she didn’t feel comfortable knocking on them or calling out to anyone.

Aside from her own footsteps and the distant ticking, she said the environment was unnervingly silent. There were Victorian portraits upon some of the walls like those used before the invention of the camera where wealthy families would commission an artist. She didn’t recognize any of the people within them, but noted how they seemed painted in a manner that made their eyes seem to follow her.

Soon after she came to a 4-way intersection with paths branching both ways. She said she very much got the vibes of this being some kind of hotel, but noted how weird it was to build one in a sort of grid formation like that. Both perpendicular halls seemed to also stretch for several hundred feet at least, and that only added to her confusion. Like Mike before her she had no conscious memory of how she had arrived at this place, and her trepidation grew with each passing minute.

One of the doors on the left-hand hall was propped open, and she decided to approach it. As she got near, she said she smelled a delicious scent wafting from within. She peeked inside, and found it to be an empty room of what looked like someone’s apartment. The oven on the far end was turned on, and inside sat a batch of steadily baking chocolate chip cookies.

Despite the clearly furnished flat, she found no one residing inside it. The room was well-maintained and tidy, but no sign of an actual resident was apparent. As she meandered further in, she noticed an adjacent door cracked open on the far side. She didn’t know how to explain it, but she said she felt drawn to it in some inexplicable way. A cold breeze seemed to somehow sift in through the crack, causing a visceral chill to run down her spine.

As she reached it, she carefully cracked the door open. Inside she found several rays of light beaming in from beyond. The room was bathed in a soft white glow which emanated from at least a dozen different holes at various locations around the room. She couldn’t determine what the source of them was beyond, but all of them seemed focused on a single point in the center of the room.

Some sort of twisted podium stood in the center, surrounded by polished linoleum floors and a group of upturned plastic chairs. The podium was little more than a twisted hunk of some kind of glimmering metal, but embedded within it was hundreds of polaroid photographs. Valerie looked over them, but said at the time she didn’t find them very significant. Despite that, she said there were 3 images which stuck in her mind.

The first was a pair of large iron towers, with one of them burning and seemingly in the process of disintegration. The second was an object in the sky which appeared as little more than a scattered group of burning debris, like a plane which had exploded mid-flight. The third was a balding man with a moustache bent over a work bench with a scowl on his face and various tools sat out before him.  

Valerie was glancing them over when suddenly she was waking up in her bed. Much like Mike before her, she described it as being there one second and then just being back in her bed the next. She said the significance of what had just occurred was not evident to her then, but as the years went on and the dreams happened again, she began to realize what was happening.

She reiterated that this dream was around 1999, and it took until 2001 for her to make the first connection from the photos she’d seen. As we all know, in September of 2001 the world trade center in New York was attacked by hijacked airplanes. Two separate airplanes crashed into both towers which erupted into flames and collapsed soon after. Valerie remembers being horrified as she watched the events unfold, but her perspective was a bit more befuddling than most others. One of the images broadcasted on the news, was a near identical image to that which she’d seen in the photograph from her dreams.

She first wrote it off as coincidence, as most of us probably would. The idea that she’d been given some sort of premonition seemed far too outlandish for her to believe, but then it happened again.

On February 1^(st) of 2003, the Columbia Space Shuttle reentered the earth’s atmosphere and suffered a catastrophic failure. The resulting incident caused the craft to erupt into flames, killing all 7 astronauts on board. The imagery was haunting, and the photos which displayed a flaming mass of debris plummeting from the heavens matched perfectly to the photo that Valerie had seen in the Dreamscape Halls.

Seeing abstract images of towers burning or flaming debris in the sky could potentially be explained away through other means. Valerie assumed she’d just seen them from a movie or something, but then remembered the 3^(rd) photograph of the man. She still remembered him as clearly as the time she’d dreamt of him, but had never been able to identify him. Then 2 years after the Columbia disaster, she got her answer in the worst possible way.

In February of 2005 a man by the name of Dennis Rader was arrested, but most probably know him by his pseudonym: BTK. Bind, Torture, Kill was the acronym for which it stood. He was a serial killer responsible for the deaths of at least 10 people between the years of 1974 and 1991. As soon as Valerie saw the images circulate in the media, she knew what she had experienced was much more difficult to explain that in just being dream.

It was her accounts that really piqued my curiosity in this subject, and led me down the path of interrogation for myself. Over the years I managed to communicate with several others who attested to similar experiences as Mike and Valerie have. In time a small, clandestine community formed around this mystery, and led to the moniker which most call them today: The Dreamscape Halls.

Accounts vary quite a bit from person to person. Some claim to have only had the dreams once, and some have them nearly every time they sleep. Some have seen things similar to what Valerie described with the photos, but others claim to have seen different, and much more worrying things. The consensus seemed to eventually culminate with the idea that these dreams could offer visions of the future if they were properly navigated.

One regular poster “John” posted in our forum one day that he and his family had decided to move after one of his dreams. He was an English national living in Japan, and claimed to have seen a photograph which depicted a wave of water decimating a city. In the photo he was apparently able to identify debris which pinpointed the area as the same town he was currently living in.

Some reading this may be too young to remember, but everyone thought the world was going to end in 2012 due to the Mayan calendar ending. John was very much a believer in this theory, and thought that his dreams were warning him of catastrophe, and so he decided to take the hint and get out of there. It’s difficult to say whether he was right, but in 2011, Japan was struck by a Tsunami which killed nearly 20,000 people. It could’ve been just another coincidence, but by this point in my exploration these “coincidences” were really starting to add up.

Dreams which reveal the future may seem like a ludicrous idea to many, and I’ll admit, I held to that notion for quite a while. I’ve always done my best to walk the razor’s edge; trying to genuinely entertain notions some may deem ridiculous while also maintaining a reasonable dose of skepticism.

To me, the mark of an intelligent person is to accept that we cannot currently explain the universe and all the phenomenon contained therein. Knowledge we take for granted in the modern age may have been considered voodoo only a few generations ago. As our knowledge and understanding of existence expands, so do the questions.

Now, you may be thinking that if there’s potential to learn about the future from these dreams then it sounds like a good thing, right? For awhile I believed that too, even after hearing several different people’s frightening experiences with them. However, it must be noted that this is far from a risk-free endeavor.

People in the community used to warn of the hostile and terrifying beings that they encountered. One of the most commonly mentioned was what the community called ‘The Hat Man’. Some may have heard of this being before as it’s grown in popularity due to several different communities making reference to it. People with sleep paralysis, along with schizophrenics and people who abuse medications like DPH have often also claimed encounters with this entity.

The Dreamwalker community described it similarly; a dark humanoid entity comprised of shadow with what appears to be a wide-brimmed hat upon it’s head. Most attest to feeling a near-paralyzing sense of fear upon seeing it, but few actually mentioned it trying to harm them physically. The consensus seemed to be that it would simply stalk you throughout the halls, and most would wake up before it got them.

Another popular being is one called the Void. It’s essentially just a mobile dark blob which shifts and slithers around, seeming to consume all in it’s path. Luckily it’s pretty slow, but most community members agreed that you should never let it touch you.

The Knight was another commonly mentioned one; a medieval suit of armor which shambles about the halls and seems to follow dreamers but only when they aren’t looking. Several have said they’ll see it in one location, then round a corner and find it already waiting for them in a different room.

Some believe this is a guard of the Dreamscape Halls, and seeks to vanquish any who trespass within. The idea of a medieval knight in a new-age hotel doesn’t make a lot of sense to me, but enough commenters attested to it that I figured there must be something to it.

The Red One is potentially the most terrifying of the lot. It’s described as a crimson-colored humanoid entity with a plethora of curled horns protruding from all over it’s body. Those who wrote about it say that it’s fast and agile, with a seemingly innate hatred for any found roaming the halls.

There are several others as well, but these were among the most commonly mentioned and encountered. It also must be noted that tragically, many users of the Dreamwalker forum passed away unexpectedly during my time observing. It was the same every time it happened, where the person in question who simply go to bed one night and never wake up. Nobody knows for certain whether it was related to the Dreamscape Halls, but once again, we find the coincidences continuing to mount.

I regarded this entire enterprise as little more than a curiosity for a while. I’ve always been fascinated by the spooky and unexplained phenomenon of our world, and this definitely fits into that category. Honestly, I regarded these accounts as an interesting collaborative fiction project in the vein of SCP or the Backrooms, but then I experienced them for myself.

The first thing I remember was suddenly becoming conscious, standing in a room I did not recognize. There was a freshly made bed behind me, with all the other normal furnishings one might find in a pre-modern hotel room. Like the others before me, I had no memory of how I arrived at this place, and at the time I had no recollection of the Dreamscape Halls whatsoever. For whatever reason, the thought simply didn’t occur to me, leaving me with a sense of dread for this unfamiliar place I had awoken in. It’s really hard to convey the unnerving sense it gives you, and I suppose the best thing I can compare it to is severe amnesia. If you’d have asked me my name in that moment, I doubt I could’ve even told you.

The vicinity was silent, devoid of bumps or knocks or the standard sounds one might associate with a hotel room. No hum of the air conditioning, nor sounds of the plumbing system; just silence.

Eventually I made my way to the door and opened to find a hallway beyond. In both directions the halls extended further than I could even see. There appeared to be no one else around, and so after debating internally for a few moments I turned left and began to walk.

Along the corridors I found photos and portraits of people and landscapes, but none of which I recognized. Before long I came to a branching path which split off in both directions. This struck me as odd as like I mentioned before, building a hotel with four intersecting pathways was a head-scratching construction choice that didn’t make sense to me even then.  

Things made less sense the further I travelled. There was this unnerving sense in the back of my mind that something was following me, but every time I glanced over my shoulder, I saw nothing. After several minutes of walking, I stumbled upon a room that looked different from the others. The borders of the door were lined with a unique trim that looked distinct from the others. The handle to the door felt unusually warm as I grabbed it, and with a deep breath I pushed it open.

On the other side I found a room littered with papers and manilla folders all around the room. I counted 5 separate computer setups placed on desks around the room with a menagerie of wires spider-webbing the floor. The monitors all displayed static which really didn’t make much sense. It looked like the long-neglected den of some crazed hacker, but there was no occupant present.

Beyond the main room sat the bedroom which stood in stark contrast to the previous. It was well-kept, perfectly normal and even looked as though it had been recently swept. The bed was made, the dresser drawers were closed and the ceiling fan devoid of dust. The only thing off about it was the mirror in the corner of the room.

It was draped with these weird, tendril-like structures like the wet roots of a tree. The mirror also had some weird properties to it. As I stepped in front of it I noticed it was reflecting the room but not me. I could see my own body just as normal, but somehow the mirror couldn’t.

Around the perimeter of the mirror were several polaroid photos stuck into the rim. Most of them were damaged to the point of being unrecognizable. Some were burned, others afflicted with water damage and crumpled, but there was one which was untarnished.

It showed what appeared to be a young boy overlooking a cliff. As odd as it may sound, it almost reminded me of the Lion King where they stand on pride rock and overlook the prairie. Only in this photo, down below there was only flames and death. There wasn’t much detail I was able to discern, but it looked like a landscape ravaged by war.

As I studied the photo, a sudden clunk caused me to lurch back away. Something out in the hallways had slammed violently into some part of the structure. I scrambled back to the door, and as I peered beyond, I felt my heart freeze in my chest.

Down the corridor I spied an entity standing motionless about 100 yards away. It’s frame was obscured, bent and twisted like the gnarled trunk of an ancient tree. The arms which protruded from it’s torso appeared infused with roots and branches. It’s “head” was little more than a bowl-shaped basin, like an arboreal hollow gouged and erupted into a vulgar attempt at life.

As I stared, I spied tendrils similar to the roots emerge from it’s back. They moved like eels sprouting from an oceanic ravine, slamming into the walls and piercing through them like drills. The thing began lumbering towards me, and although I hadn’t a clue what it was, I knew I had to run.

The halls became more warped the further I went, spiraling and breaking apart into things more akin to islands floating on an obsidian sea. I leapt and clambered further as far as I could, until I couldn’t go any further. After turning another corner I found myself face to face with the chasm. It was like the hallway just cut off, leaving another section of the building on the other side. There had to be at least 50 feet between the two sides.

I glanced down into the void of nothingness, but also the building which extended upwards and downwards further than the eye could see. The entire construct was colossal in a way I don’t think any person can appreciate unless they have viewed it for themselves. As the thing continued advancing behind me, I was certain this would be my end, but then I woke up.

With frantic breaths and a racing heart I suddenly found myself lurching awake back in my own bed. It took several minutes before my memories came back and I began to reckon with the experience I had just perceived. A sense of calmness eventually descended upon me, but it was eclipsed by that of a pervasive anxiety which crept over me like thousands of swarming ants.

  
It was too profound to be a simple dream, and that thought continued ringing in my head. This was well into my escapades with those who had experienced the Dreamscape Halls, but this was the first time I’d seen them for myself. It also brought forth a newfound fear when I finally understood how this thing spreads.

In the following years I continued having periodic dreams in relation to them. I found more photographs which did seem to hint at future events as Valerie had claimed. And much like with John, I even once used the dreams to avert potential catastrophe in my own life. I was supposed to be at work one day in the midst of a blizzard, but ended up calling in sick as a result of what I saw in my dreams. There ended up being a 16-car pileup on the highway with 9 people losing their lives that day. I can’t say for certain I would’ve been amongst them at the time, but it did happen on the same highway I used to get to work, and once again, the coincidences continue to mount.

There’s been at least a dozen instances of me getting premonitions of future events, or at least that’s how I have interpreted them. Unfortunately, it’s proven difficult to surmise their meaning until after the event has occurred. Of course, due to the fact that these are dreams I do not possess any solid proof. I don’t expect people to believe me, I just wanted to post my account to see if anyone else has experienced anything similar.

Also, for those reading who might find the idea of dreams which tell the future enticing, I have a brief word of warning for you all. Obviously, being able to tell the future can be enormous in terms of one’s own potential benefits, but these dreams are not without risks. As mentioned, there’s been several worrying accounts of people dying in their sleep which may or may not be related to the Dreamscape Halls, but there’s something else too.

I swear something has latched onto me. Either that or my own mental health has started degrading severely. I’ve seen it and felt it’s malicious presence. It’s little more than a shadow which lurks on my peripheries. I’ll catch glimpses of it sporadically- usually at night, and when I do, I know it’s time to move on. For years now I’ve been moving from place to place, staying on the road and never settling anywhere for too long, but I’m tired.

I don’t know how long I can keep this up, but I don’t plan on giving into it either. I just wanted to put this out there for anyone who may be interested, and maybe someone has experienced these dreams too. Just please be aware; for those that seek forbidden knowledge, there is always a price to pay, and some of us have had to find that out the [hard way](https://www.reddit.com/user/zachariusfrost/comments/1h9z4sm/my_third_novel_is_available_now_in_paperback_and/).
