I live with my dad in a small, rural house. We don’t have streetlights or neighbors close by, just an endless stretch of trees and silence. At night, our living room glows with the faint flicker of an old lantern on the table. My dad likes to sit on the couch late, staring at the static on the TV. It’s one of those old boxy sets without a remote. He claims the noise relaxes him.

Last night I woke up thirsty. It was late — way past midnight — and the whole house felt heavier than usual, like the air itself was pressing down. I crept down the stairs to the kitchen to get a glass of water. The faint buzz of the TV static hummed from the living room. Dad was still there, sitting in his chair.

I filled my glass at the sink, still half-asleep. When I turned back, his chair was empty.

I figured he’d finally gone to bed, but as I started back up the stairs, I froze. He was at the top of the staircase, standing perfectly still, snoring loudly.

My dad doesn’t sleepwalk. He’s never done it once in his life. And yet there he was — eyes closed, body rigid — blocking the way to my room. Between us, on the middle steps, was something strange. It looked like a shadow, but not like any shadow I’d ever seen. It was like a thin line running across the steps, shimmering and dark, as though it belonged to a different world entirely.

I called his name. My voice echoed back at me, like it had bounced off a wall. He didn’t stir.

The static from the TV was suddenly louder, right next to my ear even though the TV was across the room. I couldn’t stand the sound. Instinctively, I went back down and switched it off.

When I turned around, my dad wasn’t at the top of the stairs anymore. He was at the bottom, standing just a few feet away, eyes open this time — and glowing red.

Every nerve in my body screamed at me to run, but instead, without even thinking, I reached out and turned the TV back on.

The static roared back to life.

He stepped closer. I backed away until my shoulders hit the kitchen wall. His hand reached out — not to me, but to the TV. He pushed his arm straight into the screen like it was water. There was a wet, squelching sound as he pulled something out.

I don’t know what it was. My eyes wouldn’t focus on it, like my brain refused to process what I was seeing. It dripped. It shimmered. He looped it around his neck. Without a word, he turned and walked slowly back up the stairs.

Black liquid oozed down from each step where he’d walked, spreading across the floor toward me. It wasn’t just dripping — it was moving, creeping toward my feet.

I leapt aside, trying not to let it touch my sandals. But when I turned toward the front door to run, the door was gone. In its place was just a black silhouette of where the door should’ve been. Even the lantern on the table was now only a black cutout of itself, still casting light but no longer there.

Upstairs, my dad lifted whatever was around his neck and began swinging it side to side. Wherever it touched, the walls, the stairs, the air itself — everything disappeared.

I panicked. I ran to the TV. Static roared. My hands plunged into the screen like it was pulling me. And then I fell.

Silence.

I woke up in my bed, breath shallow, heart hammering. Relief washed over me — it was just a nightmare. But when I opened the curtains, the world outside wasn’t right.

The sun was black. Not an eclipse. Not clouds. The sun itself was pitch black, a burning void radiating daylight across the earth.

I opened my bedroom door.

And there was my father. Standing in the hallway. Holding that same impossible thing in his hands. Watching me.

I had crossed the threshold.

I thought it was over. I was wrong.
