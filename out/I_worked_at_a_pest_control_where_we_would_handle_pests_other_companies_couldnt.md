It was a hot summer day and I sat down in the shade to watch the rest of the crew pack up their gear and head home. It was almost 6pm and most people were finished for the day. I was one of the two last people at our office, we only had two people working there. The other person, my partner, was packing up his gear after having finished all his pest control rounds. Once he was done, we would transfer the samples into the secure trailer and leave the office. We would drive to a controlled release site and wait for the people to place orders.

There were a few cars still scattered around. I can't remember what they were. I grabbed the samples and went out and closed the door behind me. The samples were in small transparent plastic bags and there were six of them. Each grader would bring back four samples in case there were any problems. I tucked them under my arm and walked back to my brother in law's car and got into the back seat. My brother in law helped me put everything in the trunk and said he would get me some water.

I took out my iPad and started working on the initial report. I only had a few suggestions on the report but I wanted to fill it out as well as I could. When I logged into the secure server I waited for it to load, which usually takes a few seconds. This time I waited for over a minute and it still hadn't loaded. After another twenty seconds I made a mental note of it and went to email my boss and remind him about the problem. As soon as I sent the email I was summoned to the office for an urgent meeting. I put my iPad away and went inside.

"Jack, good you're here. We have an important meeting today and you will be playing a role in the meeting. We came to be aware of the situation before the meeting and there wasn't much time to plan. We trialed various methods and this is the best one available to us. It's one that our leaders used in similar situations in the past. We haven't tried this method before but it should work.

"We want you to go to the sample site now. You will find six samples there. Bring them back here and leave them outside the door. After that you will need to go to your house and make sure to turn off all the air-conditioners and close all the windows. Your house is the release site for the samples. We will be sending them to different locations to minimise the spread.

"We asked you not to leave the place. If anyone asks you who you are and where you have been, tell them you have work. That's all."

I didn't have time to ask questions or even think about what to ask. I was in the car and headed to the release site. I was wearing a long sleeved shirt and trousers so I didn't need to wear a mask for the samples. I drove really fast to the house and got out of the car. I ran to the house and jumped into the front room. I saw several bags on the floor. I took a bag and jumped out of the front room again. I ran to the car and put the bag inside. I got back into the car and started driving as fast as I could.

I didn't know what to do. I couldn't leave any of the samples. In the end I decided to throw it all in the trash can. It's not that hard to get to the trash can because I am already in the house. I jumped out of the doorstep and ran to the trash can. I put the bag inside and closed the lid. I waited until I heard the car starting up. It wasn't going to be enough time.

I looked around and didn't see anyone so I decided to run to the neighbors and knock on the door. I was going to tell them we had a rat in our house. I didn't know how long it would take them to come and do something about it. It seemed like they weren't home though because I hadn't heard any yelling or anything. I tried reading the name on the mail box but I wasn't sure what the house number was or which was which. So I ran to the house the right number on the mailbox and knocked on the door.

I waited for someone to answer and no one did. I knocked again and said we had a rat in our house. I heard a few people laughing at me and realised I was embarrassing myself. I started walking back to the car but stopped and turned back around. I walked up to the door and started knocking. When I knocked there was no response so I started banging on the door. I thought it was going to be open so I could go downstairs and throw my job. It wasn't going to work because of the broken windows.

I decided to climb over the fence. The tall grass was a little above my ankles and I remembered that fact. I stopped and took a few steps forward to the fence and picked a few of the plants away with my arms. I hopped over the fence, the tall grass gripped my ankles. I ran as fast as I could back to the car. I got into the car and drove home as quickly as I could. I went inside, went upstairs and shut all the windows.

I couldn't have left it at the trash can. There were too many cars parked outside and the trash cans were too close to the door. Everyone would have thought it was weird for the trash cans to be so close to the door. Nobody would have thought to look inside. I went downstairs to check the samples. I picked them up on the way down and put them on a table. I threw some water at my face and washed my face and head. I looked at the bottles and knew there was a problem. They were too full. The lab had set up the maximum number of samples by mistake. I couldn't bring them back.

I looked around the kitchen and thought. I came up with a solution that allowed me to bring the samples back with me. I went down the stairs and out of the house. I made it to the trash can in less than a minute. I looked around and waited for more time to pass. I opened up one of the samples, as quietly as I could, and spilled the contents on the grass by the trashcan. I opened up the next sample and spilled another half of its contents on the grass. I was about to open the second last one but before I opened it I saw a car parked outside my house. I knew it was someone coming to check if the rat was outside my house or if it was inside. I stretched out my arm and threw the third and last one into the trashcan. I put the bag into the car and headed back home.

When I got home I started the air-conditioners again. I made a mental note that I would have to check the temperature control settings on them. I would have to make sure to set them to set fifty degrees lower. They would have to be set at thirty degrees to stop the air from cooling down the plastic bottles so much.

I went to my work and put on my mask. I went to the trashcan and pulled out the bag. There were eight tablets in the bag. I didn't want to think about what was in the other two bags. I threw them into the bag too, making sure there were no holes in the bag and I sealed it. I took the bag with me to the back room. I set the bag onto the table and covered it. I did the same with the other samples in the other bags.

It was almost time to go home. My hands were shaking because I hadn't eaten anything. I decided it would be best if I got home as soon as possible because I doubted my stomach could handle the delay. I put my mask on and searched for the remote to turn the air-conditioners off. I couldn't see it that well so I knocked on the wall. No one answered. I knew the boss was around somewhere.

My legs started to feel weak and my arms started to shake. I crawled over to a chair and grabbed the remote. I was about to turn off the air-conditioners when I heard the boss in the room with me. I pushed myself up and stood in front of the man. He asked me why I didn't turn off the compressors. I had been apart of this company for years. I knew better than to say something like that to the man in front of me today. I told him I was just turning it off. He sighed and told me I needed to do a job before I went home.

I panicked. I didn't want to do the job. I couldn't do the job. I had chemicals and stuff inside the house. I told him I couldn't work when I didn't know when the chemicals would kill me. He said it would just scare the customer to see a pest control guy with a face mask outside. I had to take the job.

I remembered the stuff I had in the trashcan so I went to grab it. I was curious to see if it really worked or if it was just to scare me.

I took the trashcan out of the back room and into the kitchen. I didn't want to leave the door open because I was afraid a pest would get in. The smell of the rat was growing stronger and stronger. In the second trashcan was more of the liquid. The liquid that I had spilled on the grass.

I took it out and poured it over the rat. The rats eyes immediately opened and flicked side-to-side. The rat looked towards me. I felt like I was about to be eaten. I quickly left the room and shut the door. The rat was behind me and I was struck with fear as I thought of it following me with all that speed. I stopped and turned around. About half the liquid was on the floor and the other half on the rat. I didn't think the rat would be able to jump that high.

I slipped on the liquid and fell to the ground. I could hear the rat growling behind me. I crawled on my hands and knees through the whole kitchen. I turned around and saw the rat flicking its tail. I jumped up to my feet and ran back to the front door. I turned around and almost tripped over the rat. It turned towards me and I screamed. I started running away from the rat. I ran into my house, I ran through the room, I ran down the stairs.

I made my way down to the basement and locked the door. The rat was there too. I locked the door and thought of how I would get away from the rat. It tried to get down the stairs but could jump up the stairs easily. It was demonic, angry and it wanted to eat me. I thought of how it shot acid at its prey and was in contact with its prey's fluids. It might be able to use its acid on me. I could smell a dark burgundy smell. It had the smell of the rat but it was mixed with the smell of death. It was a great deal harder to breath when it was near me with the smell that it had. It was always brighter and clearer when I was near this rat. I looked through the cracks of the door and saw the rat was close above me. It was on the other side of the door. I ran over and reached for the door knob. I pulled it and the door opened. I opened up the door and the rat jumped down the stairs. I closed the door and locked it. I could hear it scratching on the door. I knew that it would be able to break through the door in less than a minute.

It scratched at the door and made its noises. I closed my eyes because I heard the sound of wood being broken open. I opened them after a few seconds and couldn't breathe. I knew the rat was in front of me. I could see it. I knew then what I had to do. I ran to a corner behind the furnace and hid myself in the shadows. The rat came closer and closer. I covered my head with my hands because I didn't want to know if my eyes turned red. It walked over to the furnace and sat down. It looked back and forth from me to the furnace. I felt like I was being watched from across the house. I looked up and saw the rat was in front of me. I fell to the ground but the demon was on top of me. It was leaning over me. I thought of what had happened to the men before me and tried to run away.

The demon made a loud noise and a sharp pain came down my face. I saw a burning pain shoot to my eye. I closed my eyes and opened them in pain again. I saw the demon only from the left side. What was left of the rat was on the other side of me. Its head was burnt. I saw the demon shine in the light and I could hear it growl. It stepped on my head and pinned me under its foot. I was dazed from the pain. In the corner of my eyes I could still see the demon. I looked up and saw its elongated teeth. It slowly bent down and came close to my face. It began to consume me and I lost consciousness.

…

I woke up and opened my eyes. I saw the room was dark. I tried to stand up and my leg hurt. I reached down and my leg was bloody. I looked over at the furnace and saw its legs on fire. Its body was burnt to a crisp. I turned towards the stairs and saw that a part of the wall was burnt as well. I started struggling over to the stairs and grabbed onto them. The pain got worse. I couldn't make it to my bedroom. I crawled on the ground from one place to the other. It took me longer than expected to get up the stairs. The floorboards were burnt at the top. At the top of the stairs was a hole. I reached over the hole and wheeled myself over to see what was below. The roof was completely burnt away. Before I was in the streets looking at the destruction and destruction that happened during the fire. I saw a human body burnt to a crisp. The ground was harsh underneath me. It was dark. I tried to walk but I couldn't. I reached out my arms and legs. I could feel the ground below me. I reached over and grabbed onto one of the nails sticking up. I pulled myself to the top of the house. I stayed where I was crouching at the top and listened to the apartment's balcony boards broke and split. I climbed over to the other side and looked out and saw the burnt staircase.

My house began to smoke and I climbed on top of the house and did not feel safe. A body was on the ground. I climbed onto the balcony and felt the wind move through me as I moved. I was tired and tired of this life. The sun began to beat down on me. I knew now that I wasn't the only one who survived. I knew there were others who survived. The fact was I really didn't want to know who they were. I knew it would be people from the city. None of the pest I exterminated were human. I knew I would have escaped the city and tried to kill them. I knew I would have caused more damage in the city than any fire. I didn't have anything, I didn't have anything to eat or drink. I knew I wouldn't keep staring and looking for any survivors. I sat in the windowsill like I did when I left the house.

I leaned over the side and looked down. I reached out and told myself I could survive. I crawled to the right and reached my hand down and grabbed onto a ladder on a tree. I pulled myself up, but my leg was injured badly. I moved while my body was sliding down the wall. I tried to ignore the pain and move. I reached back up and grabbed the windowsill. I pulled myself to the top of the house. I couldn't care about what I had done or what I hadn't done. I dropped down and twisted my leg. I got to the top of the house and it was painful. I didn't care about what I was doing. I was angry at the life I had.

…

I was sitting outside of my house, keeping an eye on the house and watched the people I exterminated on the way to the fire come out and the cops were late or didn't show. There were about three or four men left. These men were trying to put out the house fire. There were two young teens and an older man who was pushing a wheelchair with a kid in it. The younger teen was holding a woman, who was crying and making noise. The older man was pushing the young teen back. The teen yelled out and tried to push the wheelchair over to the house. The older man was telling him to stop. The older man was trying to push the wheelchair away. He stumbled and fell onto the wheelchair. I realised the situation was to complicated for me to handle so i decided to give up trying to find the survivors and instead fed myself to the demons.
