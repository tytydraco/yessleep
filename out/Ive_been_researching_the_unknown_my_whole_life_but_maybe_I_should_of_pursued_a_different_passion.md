The year was 1974, and I was a dedicated researcher with a passion for the unexplained. My name is Dr. Jonathan Hartman, and I had spent years studying paranormal phenomena, searching for concrete evidence of extraterrestrial life. Little did I know that my pursuit of truth would lead me down a dark and treacherous path.

It began innocently enough, with reports of unexplained timeloss incidents in a small rural town. Residents claimed to have experienced hours of their lives vanishing without a trace. Intrigued, I packed my bags and set off to investigate, armed with my trusty notepad and camera.

My first encounter was with an elderly woman named Mrs. Miller. She spoke of an afternoon spent gardening, only to find herself indoors hours later with no recollection of how she got there. Her confusion was palpable, and the lines etched on her face spoke of the genuine terror she had experienced. 

My next interview was of a middle-aged man named Mr. Jenkins who recounted a harrowing experience of which he claims he was abducted, he spoke of having vivid images of bright lights and strange beings standing around him on some sort of operating table.


One evening, after a long day of interviewing witnesses, I retired to my dingy motel room. I laid in bed, my mind racing with thoughts of the unknown, I finally fell asleep somewhere around 1 am. Shortly after I found myself abruptly awake at precisely 2:22 am. A crimson glow filled the room, casting eerie shadows on the walls. Paralyzed with fear, I could only watch as the light pulsated, its intensity growing with every beat of my heart. I tried to scream, to move, but my body remained frozen, completely under the control of an unseen force.

Then, as suddenly as it had begun, the red glow vanished. I gasped for air, my body drenched in sweat. It was as if the room had returned to its ordinary state, devoid of any traces of the supernatural. Had it all been a hallucination? A trick of my sleep-deprived mind?


a few nights later, as I sat alone in my poorely lit motel room, poring over the testimonies I had gathered, I was startled by the sound of footsteps above me. My heart raced as I realized there was no upstairs in this motel. The ceiling continued to creake in a barrage of pitter patters, until the footsteps grew louder and heavier and began to thud more and more distinctly.


Summoning every ounce of courage, I cautiously stepped outside, my eyes scanning the rooftop,  Silence enveloped the air, broken only by the distant chirping of crickets. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary, until I focused my gaze on the treeline that bordered the motel yard. Then I saw it, I froze in fear, my eyes locked onto the figure standing amidst the treeline. It stood just beyond the veil of darkness, bathed in the pale glow of the moon. As my gaze settled upon it, a chill ran down my spine, for the creature before me resembled no earthly being

The creature's head  bore an uncanny resemblance to a baby barn owl, yet its body was sleek and slender, lacking any trace of feathers. The skin, a sickly pale hue, seemed to emit a subtle luminescence, casting an otherworldly glow upon its form, its large round eyes glowed unnaturally.
It possessed an unsettling stillness, as if it were studying me just as intensely as I was studying it. It stood there, almost statue-like, exuding an air of malevolence that permeated the surrounding air, suffocating me in its presence.

As I stood transfixed, my gaze locked with the unearthly being in the treeline, a sudden urge to blink overwhelmed me. In that brief moment, my eyes closed, and when I opened them again, it was as if an eternity had passed.

The darkness of the night had dissipated, replaced by the soft hues of a dawning morning. The once eerie treeline now bathed in the gentle light of the rising sun. In the blink of an eye, hours had slipped away unnoticed. The darkness of the night had yielded to the gentle embrace of morning light.
