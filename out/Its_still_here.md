It's still here…

I keep waiting to hear my mom's key in the lock, for her to open the door but all I can hear is the quiet hum of the fridge and my own heartbeat. I'm still standing in the doorway, the light from my phone is casting a weird glow on the floor. If I wasn't so scared, I'd almost laugh at how ridiculous I look. Simply sitting and staring at the couch as though it will swallow me whole.

Occasionally, I notice a slight movement, a ripple in the shadows, as though something is shifting its position.

I was able to turn on all of the lights in the room, yet somehow that corner is still dark, as though the light just reflects off of it. My stomach churns with fear.

The logical part of my brain is saying, "There's nothing there, it's your imagination," but the other part is yelling, "Get out. Now. Don't look back."

I tried calling Josh, but it rang once and went to voicemail. I don't know what he saw, I just remember his eyes going wide, the color draining from his face. I've never seen him that scared. And now he's not responding. Is he in worse danger than I am now? Did he bring something back with him, too?

The minutes crawl by like hours, and the silence is agony. I don't know when I first started hearing it, but now there's this faint scratching sound, like fingernails across fabric. It's coming from that dark corner way behind the couch, from that area I'm trying so hard not to see.

My fingers tremble as I write these words, but I continue to write so others can know what was done to me.

I take a step forward but my feet are glued to the spot in concrete. Each little shuffle on the carpet is thunderously loud in the silence. My breath catches in my throat… What if it pounces on me as soon as I get close? But I need to know I'm not imagining things and something is actually huddled there.

I inch closer and closer to the couch, heart in my throat. The scratching stops. The silence that follows is even worse, because it means whatever's there is listening. Waiting.

My phone buzzes in my hand. It's a text from Josh.

My heart misses a beat, and I nearly drop the phone. The message reads: *"I'm so sorry. Don't look at it."*

My blood runs cold. Don't look at *what?* I glance over at the couch. Almost against my will, I shift a few inches to the side to get a better view.

I think I discern a shape of something low to the ground, something crouched with limbs twisted at unnatural angles. It's so dark that the shape appears to draw the light into itself, like a black hole.

I take a slow, trembling breath. My phone buzzes again, another text from Josh: *"If you see it, don't move. It hates when you notice."*

My heart pounds in my ears. I clench my teeth, stifling a scream. Now I know I'm not losing my mind. Whatever Josh saw in that hotel, whatever followed him or us back… it's real.

I don't think I can outrun it. If I turn my back on it, I don't think I'll reach the door. My only hope is that my mom will be home soon, but a cold fear whispers that even that won't be enough. I don't think I'm really going to do this, but I hold up my phone and turn the flashlight on, pointing it straight at the couch.

That's when it moves.

It's a slow, deliberate movement, as if it's crawling deeper into the shadows. I can't discern a face, I don't even know if it has one. My knees buckle, and I slap a hand over my mouth to stop myself from screaming. I've never felt pure, utter terror like this before in my life.

I don't know what will happen next, how I'll get through this night, or if my mom will find me when she gets home. I only know that if I stop writing, I'll lose the tiny bit of courage I have remaining. Maybe posting this is a cry for help, or maybe it's a last record of what happened here in case something goes horribly wrong.

All I can do is plead to whoever's reading: if you find yourself with faint scratching on your door after you've gone somewhere you never ought to have gone, if you see a shape looming in the corner of your eye…

Run. Or pray. Because I'm not sure anymore that we can outrun what we carry back with us.
