I stood there shaking as the hulking figure swung my cell door open, echoing a resounding clang as metal hit metal. I barely had the time to breathe before he opened my cell door and hit me, his fist feeling like a block of concrete was thrown at my stomach. His cold dead hands grabbed me and pinned me against the wall, before opening his mouth wide and began to speak:

“You are not a valued customer, sound is not allowed.” The Guard said plainly, his mouth a dark abyss from which the words floated out from. Dropping me to the ground, the Guard lowered himself to meet my gaze, morphing his mouth into a smile shaped void and echoing: “Shhh!”

Seemingly satisfied with himself the Guard turned his back to me as he went to leave, which is when I swiftly struck him in the head with the rock I found earlier. As the guard fell forwards with a heavy thud I used both of my hands to steady my grip on the rock, hitting him again and again. 

Standing above the body I was fighting against the urge to throw up, the mangled mess of the guard’s head was too much for me to look at. Inspecting him from the neck down however, he truly did seem like this place’s security as he wore a uniform akin to police in the real world. Still it was obvious this was a fake uniform, just slightly off enough in its details to make me unnerved. It's almost as if this place exists to fill in a gap in reality; some cheap placeholder for when the real world stops making sense, something that was quickly thrown together in the hopes no one would notice the difference.

Aside from a keychain I found nothing else of note on the Guard’s body, so I hastily left the cell I was and immediately looked into the cell to my right, as I am certain this is where the voice from earlier came from.

It seems I was right, as in the far corner of the decrepit cell there was a woman trying to press herself into the corner, almost as if in hopes she would be invisible there. Upon noticing it was me who stood in front of her and not the Guard her eyes widened in surprise, yet she remained unmoving. 

In a hushed tone I asked the woman: 

“Are there more?”

After some silence she hesitantly answered:

“I don't know, I… I’ve only seen one guard here, always him…” Her voice trailed off, barely above a whisper.

“What do you know about this place? Is there a way out?” I asked, hopeful she would know something I don’t.

“If there was, do you think I would be here?” She responded harshly, anger quickening in her voice. “Is the interrogation over now? Can you let me out of here?” She continued, getting more agitated by the second.

I was at a crossroads. While I did want to release the woman from her confinement I just couldn’t trust her. There are too many things in this place that act like people only to try and kill you seconds later. I needed to be sure that she was a human being.

“What’s your name?” I began, further questions on my mind.

“Veronica.”

“Where were you before this?” 

“Driving to my niece’s birthday party. I stopped to get gas and next thing I remember I’m here.” She responded, her face conveying pain as she remembered about her family.

I didn’t have much to go on, but her response calmed me a little. Her demeanor seemed normal, she didn't twitch, and most importantly her mouth actually moved and mouthed the words she was speaking as opposed to just echoing out her voice. If she truly wasn’t human she was good at pretending to be one.

With slight apprehension, I moved towards the cell door, and opened it. If I am wrong about my decision I will find out now. Instead of being attacked however, Veronica quietly began sobbing. Trying to keep her noise down as she lowered her head, avoiding my eyes.

“Sorry…” she sniffled. “I’ve just been stuck here for so long that I thought I’d die here.” She continued, trying to hold back her tears.

As we started walking down the hallway, there was a feeling of optimism mixed with fear in the air. The hallway beyond the cells seemed to go on forever, the cold pale lights casting a sickly flickering light above us as we progressed through it. Veronica followed closely behind me, our footsteps echoing against the concrete floor. Every sound we made felt too loud, like we were one badly placed step away from attracting more of those guards to us. 

There wasn't much conversation between us. I didn’t want to risk any more noise than necessary and she seems to be on the same page. Beyond that though, what would I even say to her? Everything I could think of saying to her would get outweighed in my mind for either being too stupid or unnecessary noise, so I remained quiet.

After some time we reached the end of the hallway, an old rusty ladder ascending into darkness above us. The metal rungs were cold, simultaneously feeling slick and coarse on my hand. It seems like they don’t even know how to make ladders here, as the rungs had awkward and uneven spacing between them.

Turning to Veronica I whisper, “Ladies first.”

She gave me a look. “Absolutely not. Do you really think I’m going to climb up a ladder I can't see the top of before you do?”

“Fair enough.” I responded defeated, before grabbing a rung and beginning our climb.

Reaching the top of the ladder, I began pushing on what seemed to be a trap door. It wasn’t locked, but the amount of resistance I faced told me something heavy was on top of it. Pushing on the door with more effort, it creaked loudly as the door gave way and light flooded in from above. As I hoisted myself up I offered Veronica a hand.

Looking around we seemed to be in another room, this one built more like a warehouse and filled with cardboard. Stacks upon stacks of cardboard went all the way up towards the ceiling, like makeshift walls. Some of the boxes had barcodes, some had the same slightly off writing present everywhere in this place, and some… some had images of people. Just average people's faces, their facial features etched onto the cardboard boxes themselves like some morbid form of art.

One of the faces was looking straight at us.
