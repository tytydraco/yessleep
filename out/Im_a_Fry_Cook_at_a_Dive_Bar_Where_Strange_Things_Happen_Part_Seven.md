After Henry came back from his shift I told him about my dream. He told me that everyone has those dreams when they first start to learn rituals. Apparently they are prophetic which makes me nervous, because mine was…disturbing, to say the least. He told me to remember it as best I can. If we can figure out the meaning of my dream then we can prevent whatever it is predicting. 

  
The next few weeks Henry and I got down to business. We expelled as many monsters as we could without having to sacrifice too much. A few cuts here, a few burns there. We wanted to draw out whoever was trapping these creatures in our bar. So we kept going until they tried to stop us. We didn’t have to wait long…

  
One night after work, Henry and I were laying on the couch drinking beer and studying his book. He had pretty much become my roommate at this point. My couch and living room was covered in his dirty clothes and dirty dishes. He was a little dirtier than I liked but I never minded too much. I knew if I asked him to clean it he would without any issue. My feet were resting on the table. I was careful not to kick any of the ranch and chicken bones onto the floor. Henry sat crisscrossed facing me so I couldn’t see his book. 

  
“What deity do you call for fire based rituals?” His eyes met mine as he glanced at me over the top of his book. 

  
My fingers drummed the whiteboard I was holding as I tried to come up with the name. I looked around the room as if something in my living room would tell me what this ancient, all powerful, god or goddess would be. I was just stalling for time, hoping that Henry wouldn’t notice that I had no clue.

  
“Come on, Levi. You know this one.” 

  
I groaned and rubbed my temples. “Fuck man…I-I don’t know…” I thumbed the cap off the dry erase marker. It flew off with a loud pop and the cap disappeared under the table. “Shit,” I muttered as I took my feet off the table and blindly reached under the table to feel for the cap. When I finally found it I made a triumphant, “ah ha!”

  
I sat up and glanced at the TV. I could see the living room reflected in the black screen. I felt confused as I saw Henry’s face. It had a look of terror plastered on it. I glanced over at him and jumped back. A figure stood in front of Henry. A long, black, tattered cloak seemed to whip and twist in a nonexistent breeze. Its hood was drawn over its head which shrouded its face in darkness, but based off of Henry’s pale complexion it was horrific. It floated over him as it reached its hand out. It reached out towards Henry who seemed to be paralyzed with fear. As its hands touched his chest they seemed to just pass through his body. My friend gasped and his eyes grew wider. His face went red and then blue as the monster squeezed the breath from his lungs. He desperately looked over at me with bulging, fearful eyes. I noticed his body was rigid as if he was frozen in place. I stupidly stared at him for a few seconds before springing into action.

  
I pulled out my pocket knife and began to carve into my arms. I felt my hair raise on end as the air around me became electrified. I reached out and touched the figure with the intent to banish it back to wherever it came from. I was surprised when my hand passed right through it. My hand boiled and blistered as it passed through the figure. The creature was so cold that it made my hand burn. I pulled away and took a few steps back. Henry’s face was beginning to turn purple and I could tell he was passing out. I remembered learning about these monsters. We can usually touch ghostly creatures when performing rituals. It’s like an extra bonus thing we are able to do because of the deity’s power. There are a few exceptions however. One of them is when the summoner uses a two day ritual to call them. These are extremely dangerous and hard to complete. You have to stay awake for the full 48 hours and cause yourself constant pain. This comes with the benefit of making the spirit you summon unable to be touched but able to touch others.

  
Panic had fully engulfed my brain at this point. I couldn’t think straight as I watched Henry finally fall unconscious. I know he had told me how to banish these creatures but I couldn’t remember. My brain was so overwhelmed that I wasn’t able to come up with a plan. Everytime a few ideas began to form, they were pushed aside by the screams of panic.  The static that seemed to zap my skin periodically finally pushed an idea into my head. I didn’t know if it would work but I thought it was worth a shot. I gave my command for banishment to the deity in the foreign language. My hand touched Henry’s shoulder and I mentally begged whoever was listening that this would work. I felt my body absorb the electricity as it traveled to my hand. My hand closed around the air as I watched my friend blink out of existence in front of me. The cloaked figure seemed confused as it stood there looking down at the empty couch. It hung there in the air for a few minutes working out what I had just done. Then it turned to me and a scream caught in my throat. It’s face shifted constantly. First it had one eye, then four, then two, then twelve. Its mouth changed shape, getting too big, too small, and sometimes disappearing. Just watching it made me nauseous as my brain constantly tried to pin down its features. But the harder it tried, the worse the distortion got.  


I was surprised when I realized I was flying backwards. The thing had grabbed me by the neck and was pushing me across the room before I could even register it. I felt my back slam against the wall as it squeezed my throat. My lungs began to burn, begging me for air. My body kept trying to suck in oxygen to avail. As if not comprehending the situation my body began to move on its own. My hands grasped at the decrepit arms that pinned me to the wall. They harmlessly passed through only feeling burning cold as they did. Every desperate kick was like sinking my legs knee deep into liquid nitrogen.I struggled so hard that I heard the crashing of glass as pictures were thrown from the wall. I became exhausted as my body expended what little air it had. My struggling became weaker and weaker, my vision began to blur. I felt the pressure building in my head to the point where it began to hurt. I fought for my consciousness as I desperately looked around. I tried to focus but my panic was running wild and clouding my thoughts. I caught a glimpse of a nail that is sticking out of the wall where a picture had fallen. It brings my thoughts to focus enough for an idea to crash into my mind like a runaway train. I reached out and gritted my teeth as I forced my arm hard onto it. The pain of my skin ripping was practically unbearable. I had hoped that I was carving the symbols correctly. Even with the burning pain of my ripping skin; I felt unconsciousness creeping embrace over taking me by the second. By the time I was done, oblivion lapped at my consciousness like flames under a new log on a fireplace. It threatened to over take me as I spoke the words for the ritual of banishment. I prayed it would work as I placed my hand onto my chest.

  
I felt as if my body was ripped apart. Every nerve in my body felt like it was being rubbed against a cheese grater. I closed my eyes and screamed as the overwhelming pain hit every part of me. Then all at once…the pain was gone. The pressure around my neck vanished and I took in gasps of breath. The air felt like fire traveling down my throat and burning my lungs. I coughed as if my body was trying to prevent me from taking in fresh air all at once. The pressure against the wall was gone. My feet were solidly planted on the ground as wind whistled by my ears. The heat of the sun on my face was only interrupted by the cold air that wafted passed me. I couldn’t hear anything past the roaring of the wind. I hesitated to open my eyes. I didn’t know where I had ended up and I was scared to find out. I took a deep breath and peered out from between my eyelids. My hand went up to shield my eyes from the blinding sun as I took in my surroundings. A wave of nausea overtook me as I realized I was looking down at the ground from hundreds of feet in the air, maybe even thousands. Below me was red earth with green shrubs with trees haphazardly scattered along the endless expanse. I turned around realizing I was standing on a plateau. My eyes searched the flat terrain for any sign that the monster had followed me, but it was nowhere in sight. I sighed with relief and slumped down into a sitting position. The banishment ritual sends the target to the plane they belong on. There was no specification on the location that they would get banished to on their plane. I hoped that meant I could use it as a sudo teleportation spell. Either that or I’d be really embarrassed for the last few minutes of my life.  


I began to walk around the plateau, looking for a way down. My feet and clothes were covered in orange clay and dirt by the time I realized I was stuck up there. The oppressive heat started to overpower the refreshing wind that had been able to cool me off before. I sat on the edge of the plateau and watched the sun go down as I contemplated banishing myself again; but I was lucky enough not to end up in the middle of the ocean the first time. Knowing I might not be so lucky next time, I decided against rolling those dice again. There was always the chance a hiker would come by tomorrow. I didn’t know where I was, but it looked like the place that the outdoorsy types would be. 

  
As night fell, so did the temperature. After gathering some of the dried brush I tried to start a fire. Rubbing two sticks together is harder than I thought. I ended up getting a sharp rock and carving symbols into my arm. I lit the pile of sticks on fire and huddled close to it to keep warm. Looking back…I was lucky I didn’t light up the whole damn plateau.

  
I spent the night staring up at the night sky. I hoped that Henry had better luck where he ended up. At some point I fell asleep and was woken up by the sound of voices. I scrambled to the edge of the plateau so fast I almost fell off. There were two hikers walking below me. I yelled and waved until they looked up at me. They were able to get in contact with the authorities or rangers or whatever. Eventually a helicopter came to rescue me and brought me down off the highland.

  
The search and rescue team, as well as the police questioned me about how I got up on that plateau. My lack of climbing and hiking equipment must have had them pretty stumped. I definitely ended up on some sort of “Strange Search And Rescue Stories” video on youtube. I pretended like I was disoriented and confused, but I don’t think the cops bought it. With no identification I couldn’t prove who I was which made it pretty hard to convince them to take me home. Eventually they let me go and I had to find some way to get home on my own. Of course that was hard because I didn’t have any money. I spent the last few days hitchhiking across the country. There were a lot more generous people than I thought there would be. I’m currently sitting in a cafe in missouri. I managed to swipe a computer from one of the people who drove me here. I feel a little bad about it but I needed it more than he did. I want to get in contact with Henry as soon as I get home. I hope he’s okay. I also hope that the monster that attacked us is gone when I get back. It seems like it can’t track me because I haven't seen it recently. I’m still working out a plan to get rid of it if it does show up. If I can manage to get ahold of Henry or get his book, I might be able to figure out what to do.
