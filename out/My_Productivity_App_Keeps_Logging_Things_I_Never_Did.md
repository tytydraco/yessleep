I shouldn’t have been awake when I found it.

It was 2:14 a.m., and I’d just spent an hour scrolling mindlessly, promising myself, again, that I’d finally fix my sleep schedule. That’s when I saw the ad.

“Boost your focus. Track your life. Never lose a single minute.”

The app was called Chronicle, and something about its slogan hooked me. I’d tried a million so-called productivity hacks before: time blocking, bullet journaling, those planners with cute stickers. None of them ever worked.

But this app promised something different. It claimed it could track my schedule automatically, even when I wasn’t logging anything. It said it knew what I was doing, even if I didn’t tell it.

It sounded too good to be true… but at 2 a.m., half-delirious, I downloaded it anyway.

It opened to a sleek black screen with a single glowing question:

“Do you agree to let Chronicle monitor your activities?”

I tapped Yes.

At first, it was amazing. When I woke up the next morning, Chronicle had already built a timeline:

* 7:48 – 8:16 a.m.: Showering  
* 8:16 – 8:34 a.m.: Making coffee  
* 8:34 – 9:42 a.m.: Scrolling TikTok  

It was eerily precise. I hadn’t entered anything. Yet somehow, it knew exactly when I stepped into the shower, how long I stayed in the kitchen, even the black hole of wasted TikTok time.

The strangest part? I felt… comforted. As if I wasn’t drifting anymore. As if my life was being watched, recorded. Even the meaningless in-between moments suddenly felt like they had weight.

I started using it obsessively over the next few days. Chronicle filled my life with crisp little entries and, for the first time in years, I felt like maybe I wasn’t wasting everything.

Then came the first anomaly. Thursday night.

I woke up groggy, throat dry, and reached for my phone. Chronicle had already logged the night:

* 11:42 p.m. – 1:11 a.m.: Sleeping.
* 1:11 – 2:07 a.m.: Standing outside neighbor’s window.  
* 2:07 – 6:44 a.m.: Sleeping.

I blinked at the screen. Standing outside my neighbor’s window?

My neighbor, Claire, is an older woman. We barely speak. Why the hell would I be standing outside her window at one in the morning?

I laughed nervously and assumed it was a glitch. Maybe Chronicle had misread something, like me getting up for water. I almost deleted the app right then, but some dark, gnawing curiosity kept my finger from pressing uninstall.

Instead, I decided to test it.

The next night, I stayed awake on purpose. I sat at my desk with a Red Bull, Netflix playing softly in the background, making sure not to move. Around 2 a.m., I finally checked Chronicle.

* 12:07 – 1:59 a.m.: Watching Netflix at desk. 
* 1:59 – 2:41 a.m.: Standing outside neighbor’s window.

My stomach turned. I hadn’t moved. I hadn’t even gone near my front door. But Chronicle insisted I’d spent 42 minutes outside Claire’s window.

I locked the door. Closed all the blinds. Tried to convince myself I was just being paranoid. 

Monday morning, Claire was waiting for me in the hallway.

“You were out late last night, weren’t you?” she asked, frowning.

“No,” I said, my heart pounding.

“Because I could’ve sworn…” She trailed off, shaking her head. “Never mind. Sorry.”

She shuffled back into her apartment, but the way she looked at me made my skin crawl.

I opened Chronicle again. The entry was still there. Black text on a white background, carved into reality:

* 1:59 – 2:41 a.m.: Standing outside neighbor’s window.

After that, the logs only got stranger.

Saturday:

* 3:12 – 3:47 a.m.: Digging behind communal trash bins.

Sunday:

* 2:23 – 3:02 a.m.: Watching someone sleep.

It didn’t even say who. Just… someone.

Every time, the memory was gone. I’d been asleep, or awake, in my apartment the whole time. But Chronicle logged those missing hours with unnerving precision.

I tried recording myself at night with my phone’s camera. The footage showed me sound asleep in bed the entire time. No movement. No interruptions. And yet, when I checked Chronicle…

* 1:44 – 2:19 a.m.: Standing on the edge of the highway overpass.

I stopped sleeping.

I stayed awake until my vision blurred, terrified that if I closed my eyes I’d wake up to another entry… another life I didn’t remember living. My skin went pale. My eyes bloodshot. Coffee didn’t help. Neither did alcohol.

But Chronicle never stopped. It filled my nights with horrors I couldn’t explain.

* 2:01 – 2:53 a.m.: Kneeling in the park, whispering.
* 3:17 – 4:02 a.m.: Scratching the locked basement door.
* 1:36 – 2:11 a.m.: Standing motionless at the intersection, watching cars pass.

I showed the app to my friends, desperate for reassurance. Most of them thought I’d been duped, that Chronicle was some elaborate ARG or viral marketing stunt. But when they tried to download it, it was gone from the App Store.

One night, I made a mistake. I decided to confront it. If the app said I was outside Claire’s window again, I’d go there myself. Prove it was fake.

So when Chronicle logged the entry—

* 1:58 – 2:41 a.m.: Standing at neighbor’s window.

I grabbed my coat and ran downstairs.

The night air was cold, the apartment complex silent. I crept toward Claire’s window, heart hammering. Her curtains were drawn tight, but inside I could see the faint glow of her TV.

And then, as I stood there, my phone buzzed. A new entry appeared.

* 2:12 – 2:13 a.m.: Watching yourself.

I froze. Slowly, I turned my head. Across the parking lot, in the shadow of the dumpsters, a figure stood. Tall. Motionless. My shape.

It didn’t move. Just stood there, holding a glowing rectangle in its hand.

My phone buzzed again.

* 2:13 – 2:14 a.m.: Smiling.

The figure’s face split into a smile I could feel in my bones, too wide, too knowing.

I ran back inside, locked the door, and didn’t come out until sunrise. That was three weeks ago. Since then, I’ve tried everything.

Deleting Chronicle. Factory-resetting my phone. Buying a new one. Nothing works. The app always comes back. No icon. No sign of installation. Just there, waiting, the next time I unlock my screen.

And the entries keep getting worse.

* 3:01 – 3:44 a.m.: Practicing with the knife.  
* 4:11 – 4:59 a.m.: Standing at the bedroom door, watching yourself sleep.  
* 2:22 – 2:58 a.m.: Digging again. Almost ready.

Almost ready for what?

I don’t know how much longer I can take this. I’ve stopped eating. I don’t leave the apartment. My friends stopped checking on me after I scared them with my rambling.

But tonight… tonight was different. Chronicle logged something I can’t ignore.

* 1:44 – 2:13 a.m.: Writing confession.
* 2:13 – Present: Posting on Reddit.

And as I type these words, my phone buzzes again. One last entry slides into place, with the inevitability of a headstone:

* 2:14 – End: Becoming [permanent](https://www.reddit.com/user/salty_Astronaut77/).
