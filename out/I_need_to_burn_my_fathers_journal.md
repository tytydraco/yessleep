*July 22nd 1987 I almost had that bastard! I chased him through the bush from the latest scene. That twisted cunt probably thought that he could distract me with another twisted horrific mess, but I didn't let em get to me. I charged the bastard. There was nothing left for me to do, I had already failed little Dennis. The tree's flew past me, dust flying up from our chase. Still I kept my eyes locked on the bastard I wasn't gonna let him get away and I wasn't gonna take em in either. Not after what he'd done. I ran and ran till I came to the billa bong, I pulled my service revolver and followed his trail in the dirt after the bastard started to loose me in the brush. I knew the billa bong growing up and I knew that the freak was almost trapped, following the trail I turned a corner. I fired every shot I had in frustration and anger. There was no possible way he could of gotten away and somehow he did.*

My Dad wrote that as the final entry in his journal following the case of the Gold stone killer. Normally I wouldn't to share this kind of stuff, but after the recent find I just don't know what to do anymore. For anyone unaware, there was a recent story on the news. Construction workers digging a new pipeline unearthed the skull of a lost child, the long speculated third victim of the Gold stone killer, Louise Gran. Apparently DNA analysis confirmed it.

*August 13th 1985 Darius and I left the servo the moment we got the call over the radio. Shit was repeating apparently. Forensics have finally found something and hopefully it'll take a load of my back and get the captain to step back. I got back to the scene wanting to fuckin solve the case and not loose another one. Jim from forensics stepped forward and what he had for me was blood. Fuckin case was twisted, I didn't want to presume the worst. Of course the evidence wasn't looking good.*

The internet largely agrees that there was five victims of the Gold Stone killer. When I first got the journal I started doing some research into the killings and with my research I thought that there were only four killings. Until I went back to my fathers journal and an almost empty page at the back of the book I didn't see before.

*Researc****h****ing. Looking cas****e****, victim victim. chi****l****d kid child killed dead attack murder murdered.

It was scrawled all over the page. Incoherent and rambling. I know my Dad didn't write this page. So I revised my my idea of just how many killings there were. I wanted to be done with the journal, the story of the Gold Stone killer all of it. Everything! But I couldn't put it down I opened it again and I looked through the pages not  really knowing what I wanted to see. Eventually I found something, a page written by my father and shared with something.

*There is something wrong with this Journal and maybe I should burn it. My Dad never found the Gold Stone killer and now I don't know what to do with his journal. The news has surprised me and now this book is scaring me. Maybe he's still out there, maybe my could have done more. There's just too many maybes.*
