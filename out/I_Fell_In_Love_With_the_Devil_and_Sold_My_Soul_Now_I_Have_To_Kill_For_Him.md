I am not a man now, but something more. I have ascended from Hell, in a new position of power. The internet is something I'm getting used to. I have enjoyed laughing at "memes", whatever that word means - reading stories from folks about their issues they've overcome - and it is those people who've inspired me to tell my story of how I became the king of hell.

Now I know what you're probably saying? How is the king of hell writing on the internet? Simple, I took a visit to the mortal realm and hired a guy to set it up for me.

I remember the day it all began fondly, and so I shall enchant with you with my tale - enjoy:

I sit amongst the passengers on a bus in hell. I look around, a bunch of tough guy convicts, and then there's me, Guy - A very feminine looking man with a smooth face, short in height, and could legitimately pass as a woman. I look down at my black and white prison jumpsuit and move my shaggy hair out of my eyes. 

I sit next to a window and lean against it, no thoughts in my head, I know why I'm on route to eternal damnation. One of the passengers eyes me, confused,” So what’s your story? Murder? Robbery? Jaywalking?”

“I did a bit of everything.” I answer, not looking at them, still leaning, waiting for the fire's of hell to scorch my body endlessly.

Humored, the sinner laughs, “I see. Well, cheers then.” It was a good distraction, welcome even. Time passed quickly on the bus, each passenger wondering when it would stop and when the torture would begin.

Somehow I managed to make my lips smile. "Thank you..." I whispered.

What would it feel like? The fire is something no mortal can describe, I brace myself nervously - Legs shaking.  No. Don't think about it. Don’t. In trying to not think about it, I thought about it, and the thought left a bitter taste in my mouth. My mind is numb and blank as the bus continues to drive, until suddenly it stops dead in its tracks. Which was odd because outside of the window, it, even though it was hell, didn't appear to be the intended end. The passengers start to murmur, wondering if this is where they’re meant to be dropped off. They are all nervous, as am I. But it doesn’t look anywhere important where we are. It's just the middle of nowhere. Strange. Although this is hell, so maybe this is it? I don’t know, I’ve never been here before.

Looking down at my feet, I brace myself for what’s to come.  I'm paralyzed. My heart racing, thumping, thumping - it hurts.

The bus driver speaks up over the radio, static-ie but could be heard clearly, “Someone’s in the way of the bus. Wait, they're approaching..” They pause, dumbfounded, “It’s…” The dread mounts collectively, “The Devil?”

Huh? The Devil is here? What for? Is this our punishment? To be dismembered by the dark prince? I took a deep breath. It barely succeeded in filling the anxiety rising in my brain, an empty space of premature pain - Painful to think about. How much is this going to hurt? I can't communicate right now. No, I can't speak. I’ve become a lonely show with no supporting cast.

The bus door opens, and a man enters - Who must be the Devil. The Devil towered over everyone, a large beast of a man - He has a relatively narrow waist, a V-shaped torso, a wide chest, and broad shoulders. His face has a sharp jawline, and his chin is broad. His face is well-defined. His hair is curly and red - his curly hair forming little devil horns - and his eyes are dark and sunken and painted in black. He resembles a punk rocker, and he wears a large red fur coat like a pimp, a white shirt with an obscure band's logo, and leather combat boots. The Devil looks around the bus like a predator scanning for prey. Everyone is silent, stunned in fear, before his eyes land on me. He smiled at me, his fiery eyes lighting up as he approached me. 

“There you are.” The Devil’s voice was charming, sexy even. He had a way of drawing you into the dark side, the sin, the fun - It was a guilty pleasure to listen to.

I watched him come for me. I was understandably confused, nervously smiling.  With every step he took, the bus shook; it was almost like an elephant’s stomp in terms of sound. The Devil’s fur coat smacked the other passengers in the face. I think he seems to be too generous, something's wrong. I looked back down at my legs, attempting to hide by making myself small - but it was of no use. I looked up and the Devil waved, but I wasn't sure how to respond, so I greeted him - waving awkwardly. My anxiety was once again in full swing, and all I could hear was my beating heart.

He smiled broadly and held out his hand. I took it and felt his warm, rough skin - like the hands of a farmer. He looked at me with his wary, expressionless dark eyes that were endlessly brooding. My body grew hot - His effect on me. I shook my head nervously.

Before I could do anything, the Devil and I were already off the bus. I look around. Hell was filled with tones of red, and of the purest, sweetest red, there shone out from the innumerable hosts of the damned. The evil of sin manifested in the natural landscape was like some new disease that had taken hold and spread unchecked. It just looked wrong. Still holding my hand, the Devil had my full attention. Holy shit, the Devil is holding my hand! I pursed my lips and he winked at me.

"Ok..." I mumble, "Whatever you want with me, just make it quick."

The Devil pulled me in close, grabbing me easily, like I couldn't have made it easier for them if I tried, “I’ve been waiting ages for you, my dear.” Huh? What? Hearing that made me lighted, and I began to faint. I drop, but he catches me, holding me even closer than before. I'm blushing—suddenly very embarrassed. Our eyes met - I froze as I saw the incredibly handsome man looking back at me - His gaze burnt into my brain, my gaze displaying my longing for him - both lost in each other's gaze - creatures of sin and passion.

“Are you ready?” He murmurs. His voice oozed sex, I wanted to hear him speak more.

"Yes..." I smile awkwardly. His large build was comforting, I pressed my face against his chest.

My mouth is becoming dry, my breathing slow, my thoughts are irrational and hormone driven. He glares at me with fiery eyes shining like a warm fireplace on a pitch black night in winter.

Hoisting me over his shoulders with ease, my god his strength was something to marvel at - he flew with his demonic wings, scaly and pointing. Scared, I close my eyes, trying to get used to the idea that I'm with the literal Devil. It was a weird but exciting reality I was in. I swallowed, feeling really worried since he left. His eyes are fiery, full of hope, and his directness is a weapon he has mastered. Nothing can match it.  I don't want to start crying from being overwhelmed by every emotion, but I feel that I'm getting close.

When we land, the Devil lets me down gently onto the ground. I hesitantly looked at him, his handsome face making sure I was safe. His eyes shot a hot flame within me. I wanted him to touch me - my mind racing through every fantasy -  my heart skips a beat. I'm in front of a large gothic mansion with blood spewing from the very tasteful fountains. I will admit that the blood fountains do add a nice contrast to the rest of the outside. Very nice, very nice.

"Well, let's go, shall we?” His voice is sharp.

Together we walked into the mansion, his tight muscular butt was pure sex appeal. His voice is low, “You’re very important to me, I want you to know that.” I fidget hearing that. Why am I so special to him? My face grew hot again, I looked like a tomato. Oh, where did it all go? My confidence? My anxiety level went up ten points. I’m so pitiful. I looked at him in shock, not a single thought going through my head like an orange cat. Compared to him, I was the size of grapenut. He was bigger in every way - and trust me, I wanted to explore every inch of his chiseled body like I was Indiana Jones.

The mansion's interior was comforting, but off-putting; fitting for the king of hell. The wallpaper was a deep crimson, accented by the gold fringe surrounding the windows and door frames, matching the gilt-framed mirrors. The furnishings were rich, heavy, and black. The carpets were also black; the rugs, blood red. Flickering candles were positioned on every table and surface. They burned their light unsteadily with an angry sound. Their wax melted down over the hardwood floors, turning into a shiny red-gold layer, which would soon be replaced by more. 

Eventually, we reached a locked room - In the dark, cautiously, lost in deep thought, the Devil opened the door.  It dawns on me that this room is why he wanted me so badly. The Devil reassures me before we enter. As we entered the study, displayed upon the wall like a sword being honored, was a rusted chainsaw. Clearly, the saw part was never replaced, meaning it would take longer to cut something. The Devil blindsighted me when he pulled me close in a tight embrace and buried his nose in my hair. He stroked my back softly, getting lower and lower with his hands. I almost couldn't take it. I had to say something, “What’s with the chainsaw?” I stammered.

He responded with a cynical smile, “It’s why you aren’t burning for eternity right now.” he whispered into my ear. He pressed his lips to my neck, kissing me gently, comforting me. I can smell him, he smelled of bourbon and charcoal; it became my favorite scent from then on.

“W-What do you mean?” I stuttered. I shriveled in his presence.

He cupped my hips and tilted my head to his - kissing me on my lips. A small moan came out and it felt as if my chest melted, like he unleashed Pandora's box. I hear how horny I sound. Do I really sound like that? He pulls away, still hovering over my lips, just barely touching, “I’ve been having a burnout with my creativity lately.” The Devil sighs as if he were reminding himself of the good ole’ days, “You know, I make movies and shows about all sorts of stuff: a sitcom about a family with a mysterious third parent that is a living doll that touches the kids, an interactive kids show about a man in a bear suit in a cellar, and cartoons about an apple teaching kids about various lessons.”

He runs his hand through my hair - His voice, wrapping me in desire, “However, while I am successful, I have lost the spark that makes my content worth watching; I want to explore the rawest emotions with the biggest punches pulled.” He commanded me with his edge, like flirting with a knife - dancing with the Devil under the pale moonlight. “I want to show the gruesome nature of humanity on film to create the greatest profits.” He wanted darkness - To bathe in it, to be surrounded by despair, it was intoxicating for him. But should I do it for him? Whatever it is. Or maybe I don't like darkness? It's a little gloomy sometimes. Do I like the dark? I don't know, I don't know.

Confused, I asked, “What kind of film?”

Bluntly, he says without hesitation, “I’m making a snuff film.”

“Oh.” I'm stuck in my place, frozen like a statue.

“Yep.” He walked me over to the chainsaw, “It is the most profitable type of film in existence.” His voice is soft, calm, which contrasts with what he just said. “Only I, Lucifer Morningstar, am capable of producing the greatest, most ultimate murderin’ murder film in history, and by God will I do so.” He boasted proudly.

I was frozen in fear. He took a deep breath and spoke quietly, “Personally, I find gore funny, but probably not for the reasons you think. I love seeing how fragile the human body is and how easily it can break. I see blood every day, and it usually makes me feel more alive and aware. Gore is money. Gore is horror. Gore is God. Gore is me.” 

The horror of the situation took over me, my body spasmed as worse, unimaginable scenarios came to my mind, “I’m assuming you want to be your star?” I whispered shakily, “Right?”

“You are the perfect candidate for this. I've waited a long time for you to arrive. I need you. Please.” His voice has a soothing sweet sound, the calm before the storm.

I mustered up the courage to speak, “Can we talk it over a drink?” he rested his head on mine, “If you wish.”

And before I know it, we’re in his mansion’s bar taking shots of whiskey. I take a shot, “Okay, I'll do it.” The Devil smiles sweetly at me.

“Great.” He took another shot of whiskey.

I feel safe around him, but he is the Devil, so I have to make sure one rule is in place. “On one condition.” I had to get this to be in the contract.

“And what is that condition?” The Devil put his hand on my shoulder casually. He gently kissed my hair.

“You can't kill me.” There, there it is. The no-kill rule.

The Devil takes a shot again, “That’s it?”

“Yes.”  I hope I made the right decision. He’s the most desired thing, the ultimate bad boy, and here he is - Acting like my boyfriend. I’ll kill for him. I’ll do it if it means I get to keep being his toy. 

“You're a smart person, you know”? I blushed when he said that. His touch; it heals the soul and burns what good remains at the same time.

The Devil’s eyes light up. We shake hands and fire erupts from it. Suddenly, a dog collar appears around my neck. The Devil adjusts it drunkenly, “It suits you.”

I look at his demonic yet human-like hands around my neck, “You think so?”

The Devil finally gets it to how it wants it, “I do. There’s no turning back now.”

I look at him, grinning softly, the smell of liquor on his breath, “No turning back”

Leaning into the whisper, the Devil murmurs in my ear, “My punishments are gonna be so fucking awful for you. So fucking awful.”
I can't resist him any longer. I grab the Devil and bring him for a kiss - He responds the same, and suddenly the two of us are intertwined, our body’s wrestling for control. He tasted like cigarettes and alcohol, his tongue was rough compared to mine - Before I knew it, he had me pinned to the wall, and he took me with such force - my lips on his. My tongue tried to join his - leading to an erotic battle for dominance. His erect penis rubbed against mine. The Devil picked me up and plopped me onto the bar’s table - He unbuttoned my jumpsuit and I got an erection unlike any other. He aggressively pulled down my pants and underwear, I felt a rush of excitement go through my entire body. He spread my legs apart, grabbing my left shoulder as he steadied himself for insertion. I was both scared and aroused by how large his member was.

He took a quick glance at my face as he entered me, he began to thrust, his hips moving rapidly, each time going deeper inside. I wanted to feel everything, his body, every single move - He had to put his hands on my face as he was about to come. He did it forcefully, I felt his warm wet semen fill me up. The sensation was incredible, it was like nothing I’d ever felt - I wanted more, the feeling was perfect, I wanted more of it, I felt empty without it. My heart was beating so hard, I felt like I was going to pass out.

When we were finished, I was out of breath. But then I remembered I would be living with him, so I asked, “So, uh, where do I stay?”

The Devil was busy putting back on his pants, then he pointed to himself, “With me. I can’t lose track of you, you’re too important to me.” He was infectious with that stupid smile.

In slightly altered perception, we both make our way out of the bar and into the hallway. Stopping at a door after only a few minutes of walking. The Devil is standing in front of a red door, dripping with blood. He turns to me.

“Ignore the blood coming from the door, it’s made from heathen wood. It just does that.”

I shrug, “I wasn’t going to say anything, but yeah, the blood door seems like something that would be disgusting.”

The Devil softly laughs, “Hell is weird like that.”

I laugh along too, “I can see that.” The Devil opens the door.

The bedroom was disturbing. In the center of the room lay a large four-poster bed. The posts were made of iron, forged into the likenesses of demons' heads. Their faces were leering, open mouthed with large, black fangs dripping red saliva. The four-foot-tall statues of the demons were set apart by a red drapery hanging from the posts, separating the bed into two rooms. The drape was heavy and was made of an ungodly mixture of human hair and entrails. The sheets covering the bed were also stained with entrails and hair. But on the bed lay a dog.

The Devil, upon seeing the dog, goes from drunk macho man to a child, “Charlie, how’d you get in here? You silly dog.” It is very clear this is a bedroom from hell. Contrasting the horrible scene, the Devil plays with his dog. “Who’s a good dog? You are, yes you are.” Then - Like a lightbulb popped from his head, “Yep. I have something for you~!”

The Devil walks over to the bedroom closet, he opens it and pulls out a brown tan-ish suit with a white collared shirt and black tie. But that’s not what’s eye-catching - What’s eye-catching is the mask The Devil is holding: a mask of the character ‘Max Headroom’ with the rubber blond hair, white sunglasses with black tints, and a large toothy smile. “So, what do you think?”

“That’s for me?”

The Devil proudly looks at the costume, “You betcha! I made it myself. Do you know how hard it is to sew a suit that won’t burn immediately in hell? Very difficult, but thanks to my awesome genius and my superiority with just about everything, I got it done.”

“I mean, it’s nice and all, but can I even wear it? I died in this, so aren’t I stuck in this, like, forever or something?” I ruffled my prison jumpsuit to emphasize my point.

The Devil calmly smiles, it's a gentle one, almost beautiful, “Nope. And even if that was the case, I would just make you wear this over your outfit anyways, because I put a lot of effort into this, okay? Do you even know how hard it is to find a decent sewing machine in hell?” The Devil sets down the costume on a nearby stump table. He came back to the bed and petted the dog again.

Feeling pretty good about this relationship, I asked a simple question, “What would happen if I left the mansion?”

The Devil’s demeanor changed - Angry, controlling, he got up from the bed and held me in place, “Who do you think will accept you? Who do you think will let you be a part of their life? He'll not be kind to sinners, especially your type.” He poked my chest.

Thinking quickly, I answered, “I don’t know, your dog, maybe?”

“My dog? Okay.” And with a burst of energy, he threw his dog to the floor and stomped it to death. Those sounds, oh that poor dog, it never leaves you. He turned to me, a different person, and said expressionless, “The only person in your life is me. You got that?”

I stammered out a bitch sentence, “H-How could you do this? To your own dog?”

“I’m the Devil, bitch! Motherfucking Lucifer Morningstar is the name.” He laughed, “Now, it’s been a long day, get some sleep, we’ve got work to do tomorrow.” And with that he left the room, not even picking up the corpse of his dog.

What have I gotten myself into?
