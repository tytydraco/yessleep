The past two days have been…something. I never knew what “safety” was growing up, but I knew it felt like my Nana’s open arms readying to brace for my uncontainable excitement. My Nana was your stereotypical Italian grandma. Always making sure you ate, rosary on the doorframe, believed God sent angels to those suffering, and subtle racism when she doesn’t mean to be racist. She was a typical grandma and I wouldn’t have had her any other way. My Nana was, and still is, a huge importance to me. It’s been a year since her death and I’m still not over it. I don’t believe she is dead. I know she is always with me, but…I wouldn’t expect her to keep calling my phone. 

I heard of stories where families receiving birthday voicemails and texts from deceased family members. These were discovered to be automated messages scheduled by the deceased person, but those five minutes of confusion would be followed by a moment of grief. I find the concept of automated messages to be insulting. One day I am dying in the inside because of my Nana’s death. The next day I am moving on in life. At the end of the day I receive a “Happy Birthday” message from my Nana; thus, plunging me back to day one. It’s like a band-aid on a cut only for me to trip and reopen the wound. I HATE AUTOMATED MESSAGES!!  It’s a painful “bing” reminding me who I can’t go to whenever I don’t feel safe. I would text my Nana when my depression episodes came. My Nana would always send me groceries so she knew I was eating. She’d pray over me when I bang my toe against the bed frame. My Nana made me feel safe, heard, and important….

I tried calling her one day. No answer. I called again. No answer. “No problem, Nana is probably handling a tax appointment”, was the thought going through my head. I called one final time and left a message. “Hey Nana, I’ve been needing to go visit you. I’ve been busy with work and an issue that pop up. I wanted to go visit you today, but you might be busy, so I’ll stop by later on today. I love you, Nana.” I never said “goodbye” when hanging up because to me it feels like the end. I was turning the streets corner to my house when my stomach had a sinking sensation. Something was wrong…and it was my Nana. She was in the hospital on a ventilator. Being the Covid Pandemic at the time, I knew her being on the ventilator was a sign of inevitable death…. I handled my Nana’s death very weird. I couldn’t process that fact that she was dead even when I was lifting her coffin into the church. I left the reception early because “I had work in two hours”. I didn’t attend my Nana’s burial because I refused to see my Nana being buried. My Nana would always go to church and I told myself I would take her to church one more time and never take her out. To me, if I didn’t see my Nana be buried then she was never really dead. If I didn’t see it happen, then it never happened. 

In hindsight, I should’ve went to her burial because maybe then my Nana wouldn’t be blowing up my phone. It started two days ago on her death anniversary, that’s when her first call was made. I was astonished, yet shuttered, at the sight of my Nana’s contact ID popping up on my phone. Hesitantly, my hand reached out for the phone. Before I could answer the call, it ends. I wasn’t really “disturbed” just “why the hell did that happen?” I’m a rational person, so my brain didn’t jump to “holy shit it’s a ghost!” I assumed it was someone receiving her old phone number as their new phone number, so I ignored the missed call. An hour later, her ID contact photo appears again. This time the phone vibrates fiercely. And I mean “fiercely” because the vibration woke me up from my deep sleep. I couldn’t get to the phone in time due to my half dazed state. To be honest with you guys, if I did answer it in time I would’ve told the guy to fuck off and stop using my Nana’s phone. And to be more honest, I’m glad I didn’t answer the call. I don’t want to know that the world moved on from my Nana when I haven’t yet. 

The number sent a text message…. It reads, “[Says my name], please answer the phone. I’m sorry I missed your call.” 

I am sort of at wits end as I’m typing this. The phone calls have yet to cease since the text message. There are voicemails being left behind by my Nana. My phone has been at 1% percent for the last hour. It’s like my phone won’t die unless I pick up my Nana’s call and I don’t want to answer my Nana’s phone call because what if this is the last time I ever get to talk to her?
