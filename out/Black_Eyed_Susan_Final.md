The cracked pavement of the streets became dirt roads as I carried on in the vague direction of where I remembered the bog to be. I had to wipe tears away from my eyes while I drove. They constantly welled up.

 

I looked over at my haul of weapons, looking so out of place on the seats of this cute little car. Heather’s parents, after much pestering, let me use their chainsaw once or twice when we would go help out on their farm; and I stole my grandpa’s hunting rifle many times. It had been a lot of years, but I felt just confident enough that I could at least fundamentally function them if I had to. But I still had no idea what was coming. As far as I knew I would be wading into hell itself.

 

I got to the old Lightbody Ranch, now decayed and completely overgrown. Like the earth was reclaiming it. Then I saw the wall of trees. The beginning of it at least. I got the car as close as it would go before I would worry about it sinking, and then I gathered my equipment and stepped out. Strapped the rifle to my back, and haphazardly stuffed the chainsaw and other tools into a backpack I had sitting in the back seat; the blade sticking awkwardly out from the top.

 

The fog was denser than any I’d ever seen. Beneath it, countless tall slender spires all bunched together. It didn’t take long for the old familiar smell of perfume and death to penetrate my nostrils. Similar to how the town smelled now, but so much stronger. The ground beneath my feet began to squelch instantly, like the bog had expanded.

 

I had no idea where I was going… There was no way for me to know… I just went forward. I could barely even see the ground anymore. Just grey among black.

 

A tree came into view. A tree, with an old ribbon tied around it. Suddenly I was reminded of how scared I was last time, and that fear began to creep into me now. I was hoping to block it out with adrenaline and my single-minded dedication to finding my best friend, but it got in. I was terrified. A million times more since I didn’t have Em with me.

 

I began seeing shapes in the fog, just like last time. Figures slipping in and out of view. Only the faintest shapes. The cross shapes. They reminded me of everyone I just saw staring at me in town. It gave me the same dread. I was more alone in this place than I had ever been before, but I did not feel alone. I felt watched.

 

Wading through the vast sinking mud was hard enough without all this shit strapped to my back. Now it was truly nightmarish. I fell over many times. Nearby got stuck for good on multiple occasions. That sensation of hands grabbing me and pulling me down into the mud was consistent. It felt like dozens of hands now.

 

I trudged through the unforgiving and deathly cold marsh for hours. Lost all feeling in my toes. Finally I found my way to some solid ground. I collapsed on it and allowed my body to begin producing breath at a normal rate again. My muscles ached and throbbed, I tried wiggling my toes and after a few minutes I was able to. Eventually I looked up, expecting to see that giant hawthorn tree we saw last time, but it wasn’t there. This was a different place. I don’t know why, but I had a feeling I needed to find that tree again. But how?

 

I did see the symbols though. Those inverted triangles with the line through the bottom. “Earth” and I suppose that made sense now. They were carved into so many more trees.

 

All I could do was keep moving forward as consistently as I could despite the constant disorientation of the fog. I tried my best. I walked and I walked in what I thought was a straight line, only I began seeing things repeat. The same stump, the same tree, the same flowers. I went in a circle. The figures kept appearing in the distance. The crosses. It felt like they got closer every time I’d see them. Every time I saw them, it became clearer what they were. Even though I knew already.

 

I tried taking a different path, but it didn’t yield better results. The scarecrows inched closer and closer, while never appearing to move. Then I stepped on something. I nearly rolled my ankle. Instinctively I looked down and it looked like a small die at first, but it was a bead. A letter bead, from Em’s friendship bracelet. The letter ‘A’, either from ‘Lila’ or ‘Heather.’

 

I scanned the ground looking for more and amidst the fog I was able to see the faintest glimmer of white in the dark browns and greens and greys. I walked over and picked up an ‘L.’ She must have been leaving these like breadcrumbs. I saw another in the same direction. Now I finally had a path.

 

Another ‘L’, then a few meters away, an ‘H’. The flora got denser as I progressed, and the scarecrows crept closer, but never close enough that I could see their faces. Every now and then I’d hear the distant sound of a twig snapping. I had to try really hard not to scream.

 

I continued on and found a clearing. I didn’t see any letters at first, but I looked up and… There it was. The hawthorn tree. I finally made it back here, the long way.

 

My mind was cast back to the first time we reached the tree. Em said she saw something. She said something was wrong with it. I didn’t really see it… I thought I might have, but I wasn’t sure… Now though, there was nothing wrong with it. To me it was just a tree. I got close this time. I looked hard into the mess of leaves and branches but… Nothing. All I could see was another letter dropped near the base. I walked over and snatched up an ‘E’.

 

Was that it? I wondered. Is the tree somehow the destination? I looked all around the roots, looking to see if maybe there was a hatch or something. A hidden entrance to some kind of underground… I don’t even know what. But I saw nothing, so I went back to scanning the area.

 

Sure enough, another letter past the tree. Maybe the tree wasn’t important after all. Maybe it was just a kind of landmark, I thought. I carried on and picked up an ‘A’. I felt like I was getting close. Wherever I was going, it couldn’t be far from the hawthorn tree.

 

As I moved forward, picking up another ‘L’, I noticed the fog dissipate in front of me to reveal an enormous natural wall of rock and vines. It stretched on for all I could see, and I couldn’t see the top of it. Some kind of vast fault creating a massive cliffside. I scanned it over and over, hoping to figure out what I’m supposed to do now. No obvious entrance to anything, certainly no way to climb it, so I cast my eyes down once again, hoping the letters would guide me.

 

A few meters away, I didn’t see one letter as I expected; I saw all the remaining letters, dropped in a pile at the foot of the cliff. This was the end of the line.

 

I didn’t understand, there was nothing here. Just a cascade of earth and rock like the rest of the wall. But then I looked harder. Behind this one thicket of vines and roots, there was the tiniest gap between the rocks. This little area was camouflaged.

 

I thought about using the chainsaw, but I didn’t want to draw attention. Not just yet. I reached my hand in and pulled at the vines. They were very stubborn. I tore and I ripped, eventually making some headway and I could see there was indeed an entrance to something behind here. Thin, impossible to find. I wouldn’t have seen it in a million years if the beads weren’t laid out right at the foot of it.

 

That wasn’t the only thing I found. As I pulled my hand back from the mess of vines, it was covered in blood. Rich, dark, crimson blood. The vines bled as I ripped them. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing, but I had no time to think about it. I had to get in there.

 

As I stuck more of my body inside, forcing my way through the vines and squeezing between the rocks, I noticed that the rock on my right side could move. I pushed and it slid open with minimal resistance. Then I got my whole body inside. I couldn’t believe it. I made it. I found something no one had been able to find in decades. I was here. I could find Em.

 

I instantly could tell what this place was, or at least what it used to be. I could see by the long cavernous hallways, the hanging overhead lights, and the wooden support beams. At some point in history, this was a mine. I pulled out the rifle and got it ready. I was in the mouth of hell now.

 

This place was wrong. The fog wasn’t inside but the feeling of it was. A million invisible tiny particles floating by, dancing off my skin, being breathed in through my nostrils. My heart rate was already elevated but now I could feel it all through my body, I could hear it deep in my brain. Thudding, pulsating, low droning booms making my temples flex, reverberating throughout every inch of me. My vision got narrower as I walked inside, the edges turned to static and bright flashing storms of colour that weren’t really there. It felt like a migraine. Was it the cocktail of adrenaline, anxiety, and physical exertion causing my body to shut down; or was it this place?

 

The long hallway broke off into many rooms. Each one crudely labeled in smudged and faded sharpie on basic paper stickers now yellowed and decayed. Some labels overwritten multiple times. I knew I had to check all of these rooms, as much as I didn’t want to know what lay inside.

 

The first doorway on the left read “Admissions.” I led with the gun and walked inside. Just a few empty cots. There was a clipboard on the wall with a list of names, ages, and eye color. I didn’t want to took at it too closely, but the most recent name was Emily Knowby. I rushed out and moved to the room on the right.

 

“Garden.” This room was unusually sanitary and sterile. Akin to a makeshift college science lab. Full of multiple glass cases with soil and various plants, and little water spritzers above them. I didn’t want to take too much time but I had to look a little closer. Some of the plants inside looked strange. They looked squishy, veiny, some had little tufts of hair. Most of the plants in the soil weren’t actually plants. Just little wet mounds of mulch and… blood. Some had more than that. Some looked more fleshy. I think there might have been a tooth in one of them. I wanted to wretch. I couldn’t fathom what those were. I didn’t want to know. I moved on.

 

The next room on the left read “Gynoecium.” I didn’t know what that word meant. Inside looked like another thrown together lab. There were test tubes and beakers, and more specimens behind glass. These specimens looked bizarre. Like oversized seed pods, but they were bleeding. Seeping red, like the vines. My mind couldn’t comprehend it.

 

I really didn’t want to keep going. My legs were made of lead. It took every ounce of willpower to move them forward. A sense of ultimate dread filling my entire being as I neared the next room. I wiped the tears from my eyes and read the words on the label. I wish I hadn’t. I didn’t think it could get worse, but it just did.

 

I tried to un-know the words. I begged myself, I begged the universe, I begged gods I didn’t even believe in for the chance to un-know those words. But there they were. “Maternity Ward.”

 

I glanced inside… It was everything I was afraid of and so much worse. The sound that escaped my mouth was not of my own volition. A row of cots, most of them full. Oxygen masks on their faces. Various tubes hooked up to various places on their bodies. Their bellies…

 

I couldn’t see their eyes. Thank god I couldn’t see their eyes. None of them moved. They must have heard me but none of them acknowledged me. They were frail, ghastly, their arms were practically bones. They didn’t even look remotely alive, but they were breathing. All of their skin was pale and grey, with squiggled red, blue, and green veins all over… Those piles of fleshy mulch I saw, was that the product of this? I collapsed to my knees and frantically covered my mouth because I had to scream. Over and over.

 

One final impulse ripped through my head. One final command that cut through all the horror I was facing. “Get Em. Get out.” I leapt to my feet and stormed onwards. Only a few rooms left. I didn’t look at the labels, and I blocked out the contents inside. I was reduced to base instinct alone. I took in no information other than “Is Em in here?” All I know is I saw bodies, and I saw flowers, and I didn’t see Em.

 

I passed two more rooms, but as I looked into the third, my tunnel vision broke. I saw her. I found her. She was laying on another of those cold metal tables. Our eyes met. She looked so tired.

 

“Lila?” She uttered weakly.

 

I almost walked right in before I noticed the two men standing over her… One I knew instantly. Dom. So much anger surged through me, so much hate, so much pain; but not enough to take away from the shock of the other face… I’ve seen his face before. I’ve seen it numerous times in news articles, all my life. Was it actually him? It couldn’t possibly be, but here he was. I was staring into the eyes of Darren Barbeau.

 

A look of shock covered their faces, but after a moment Darren smiled. “My little flower.” He muttered in a deeply inhuman and hollow voice. I couldn’t let the shock get the better of me. I couldn’t freeze. I couldn’t allow myself to break. My final impulse took over once again. I raised the rifle, pointed it at his head, and shot.

 

His head tore apart like confetti, exploding into a firework of gore. A sea of crimson with streaks of yellow-y green phlegm painted the wall behind him. His body collapsed to the ground. Dom lunged towards me and I shot again, getting him in the throat. He went down instantly, gurgling and choking on his own blood. He tried to speak, but couldn’t. Good. I had no desire to hear what he had to say. Why and how he became a part of this, for how long, what he did to Heather and why he chose her... I decided his death was more important than those answers. So they would die writhing in pain alongside him.

 

I grabbed Em. Her body was weak and she wasn’t able to put any weight behind her movements, so I swung her arm around my neck and pulled her to her feet.

 

I walked her briskly out of the room, but when I turned to head back down the long hallway, I was face to face with the scarecrows. Almost a dozen of them, blocking my path. Their arms weren’t outstretched anymore, and I could clearly see their faces now. Flesh, patched into burlap, formed into a misshapen sack of a head. Some had parts of actual faces. Others just had generic smiley faces stitched on. Some were more sophisticated looking than others. Some almost looked completely human.

 

I looked to the adjacent room. It read “Black Eyed Susan.” I REALLY didn’t want to know what was in there, but we had no choice. I moved Em and myself inside, walking us backwards.

 

I looked to the doorway, letting go of Em and raising the rifle towards it. Waiting for them to approach. But they didn’t. I don’t think they were aware enough to attack. They just moved, and watched, and waited.

 

I almost felt relief when they didn’t approach, until Em screamed the most horrific scream I’d ever heard. I turned around and saw her looking behind us into the room. I didn’t want to look, but I did.

 

Rows of chairs on opposite sides of the room, all filled. More people, unmoving, with tubes running in and out of their bodies, except these ones were very different. There were so many more tubes, all pumping in liquids of various colours and consistencies. It also didn’t take long to realize these people were not human. Not all the way. Their flesh was patchy and incomplete, and they also had some kind of film all over it. Almost like a translucent cobweb or something. Their faces were wrong in every conceivable way. These were the scarecrows. This is where they grow. This is where they imbibe.

 

They look more advanced than some of the ones I glanced at in the hallway. They’re getting better, they’re getting closer to the real thing. They just have trouble with the faces. I had a feeling these were the products of the maternity ward. The ones that worked. These were his hybrids.

 

That wasn’t the worst part. The worst part was what all the tubes led to. At the back of the room. It all fed into one more… body. I hesitate to refer to it as a body. Sure it had arms and legs and a torso, a feminine form, but… The head.

 

Maybe at one point it was a human head. But whatever had been done to it made it impossible to see as such. I couldn’t help but move closer to try and discern what I was looking at… I knew this was Black Eyed Susan. Not the man. Not Darren Barbeau. This was what it was all for. This was the catalyst. This was what made all his delusion into reality.

 

Its head, from a distance, looked like the head of an actual black eyed susan flower or a sunflower. Colourful petals all spread out in every direction from the black center. Looking closer… The petals were skin. The face was carved into pie slices, peeled back, and hung on wires to mimic the petals. Beneath the petals… The place where you’d find the sunflower seeds… Eyes. Dozens of human eyes. Every eye from every victim. And I could see the pupils dilating as I got closer.

 

Everything that Darren Barbeau “learned” from the eyes of his victims, the secret of life, now rests inside her. And it’s being pumped into all these “people” and god knows what else.

 

“No. No no no. Oh god. It can’t be.” Em began to cry uncontrollably. I thought it was just because of the horrific sight before her… But it was worse than that. So, so much worse. It took me a minute to notice what she noticed. I almost wish I didn’t. On her left wrist… A friendship bracelet.

 

I fell numb. This was too much to process. Too far beyond my comprehension. Em collapsed, crying and screaming until her voice went hoarse. I wept silently and unmoving. I didn’t have any more breakdowns left in me. I was broken. My heart, my spirit, my will, all of it gone to dust in an instant.

 

I put the rifle down and took off my backpack, setting it on the ground and pulling out the chainsaw.

 

It took two pulls of the cord for it to turn on. It was loud but I didn’t hear anything now. I just stared. Stared into the dozens of eyes and they all stared back at me.

 

“I love you, Heather.”

 

I raised the saw above my head, then plunged it into the mess of eyes. They popped and squirted and shredded like plump grapes. Pouring and spraying and oozing all over the room, liquids of every colour. I couldn’t stop. I carved and I carved. I severed every cord. I turned the head to mush. I couldn’t let a single eye remain. The eyes that fell to the ground intact, I squished under my shoe.

 

The rotting perfume scent intensified and overwhelmed my senses, I could see it in the air escaping from the holes I carved. It looked like glitter. The colour storm on the edges of my vision crept in and enveloped me. The dark cavernous walls began to pulsate with vivid scarlet and cerulean hues. My focus pushed and pulled. Every motion created a colourful haze in its wake. The room spun and my legs fell out from under me. I turned my body and reached for Em but she looked a mile away.

 

I looked up and the ceiling melted away into a void more vast than anything I had ever experienced. The glitter floated into the void and shimmered like stars. The colours wove in and out of those stars. Beautiful deep blues, vibrant purples, and cosmic greens lit up the void. So impossibly big, and I felt so impossibly small. All sound cut out. Only the slow, thumping heartbeat in my ears remained.

 

The universe was showing itself to me, and it was beautiful and horrible. I laid there gazing for what felt like a lifetime, into the endless cascade. I felt trapped in my own body, all I wanted to do was reach out and join the stars; but a shape formed in front of me, blocking my view. I heard external sounds and felt vague, fuzzy sensations across my face. I didn’t want to leave this place, but it all came into focus. The shape became a face and I recognized it. The sounds became words and I recognized them.

 

“Lila! We have to go, now!” Em’s voice said, sounding 100 feet away. I remembered by purpose. My eyes focused on her face and I came back to earth. The ceiling returned but the colours didn’t stop.

 

The first thing I saw after Em’s horrified face, were the people sitting in the chairs. They weren’t sitting motionless anymore. They were shaking violently. Uncontrollably. Em tried to pull me up but she was still weak. I made it to a knee.

 

I heard a pop, and I turned my gaze towards it. One of the shaking people now had a bright oozing hole in their shoulder. Another pop and I saw something on their body quickly pustulate and burst a six-inch hole into their abdomen. I heard more cracking and popping behind me, along with violent inhuman screams. Two more pops. One on the kneecap and the entire leg burst off. One on the face taking half of the head with it. Vines and tendrils began creeping out of the holes, wiggling and writhing.

 

Another body caught my attention. Its eyes began to bulge unnaturally. Pushing violently out of its skull. It screamed. Then hard, barbed tree branches shoved the eyes all the way out and hooked downwards. Two more branches came out of the ears, and a final one emerged from the mouth. It looked like a barbed, wooden hand. The tree-like hand then clenched around the face it had emerged from and began pulling it inward. Like sticking your hand through a sweater sleeve and pulling it inside out. What happened to the body as this occurred… I can’t begin to describe, but I vomited.

 

Sharp green needles protruded from another one’s mouth, pushing out and replacing its teeth. Its lips ripped open to create a mouth three times as wide. The top half of the head snapped back 90 degrees. I geyser of red and milky green followed.

 

Vines and branches ripped through another’s abdomen so sharply and violently that the entire bottom half of their body was severed. Another had spider-like branches protrude from the sides of their ribcage underneath their arms, then clasp around their torso and rip it open like a Christmas present.

 

I could only guess that without Black Eyed Susan, the hybridization became unstable and was violently rejected. They were all being viciously torn to shreds by the atrocity of their own biology. And yet, through it all, they refused to die.

 

Bones cracked and popped, flesh tore and burst, a chaotic mess of serpentine protrusions flailed in every direction. The room spun. The deep scarlet haze; the pulsating walls in rhythm with my throbbing temples; the cacophony of pained, inhuman screams; I couldn’t imagine hell looking any other way.

 

Em pushed me to leave, but I had to do something. I couldn’t leave it like this. They needed to die, and this place needed to die. I gave Em the saw, and I reached into my bag for the spray can and the lighter. If anything can kill them, it would be fire.

 

I didn’t waste another second. They all lit up easy. Their grotesque, mutilated bodies shook and screamed in the wall of orange flame. The writhing severed pieces inched towards me in whatever way they could, but they went up too. Em and I ran to the door. The scarecrows in the hallway began to jitter and ooze fluid. I sought to put an end to all of them when I was grabbed and tackled by the headless body of Darren Barbeau. Of course he lived. Of course he wasn’t human either.

 

He held me down and clawed at my face. The hole in his neck began to bubble and expand. I could see something being savagely forced through it. Birthed from it. Violently and painfully. As it squeezed its way through, I could see it was another head. A primitive, undercooked attempt at a head. No skin, no lips, no eyes, no eyelids, just muscle tissue over wooden skull, with branches and barbs protruding from almost every inch.

 

It stuck its fingers in my mouth and pulled at my jaw. I tried to bite down but the force was too strong and I felt a pop as it began to dislodge. I didn’t feel pain so much as intense discomfort and panic as a part of my body wasn’t where it was supposed to be. I looked into the cavernous black eye holes on the messy bleeding skull.

 

It tried to speak, but before it could figure out how to articulate words, the chainsaw came ramming through it, then shot upwards, cutting it up the middle leaving both halves splayed apart. The various multicoloured liquids drenched by face. I shoved him off of me and spat his fingers out of my mouth, while his body spasmed and flailed like the others.

 

One of the scarecrows grabbed Em as I was getting back to my feet. This wasn’t just any scarecrow, though. It looked closer to human than any of the others and… The clothes… The long mess of bright orange hair… This scarecrow was made to look like Heather. And it did. It looked so much like her, except for the face which was just another burlap smiley face stitched on. My heart couldn’t break any more. I was livid. This mockery of our best friend. The desecration. The way it tricked us into all of this, this entire trip. I couldn’t stand it.

 

I pushed it back and lit it up. It stumbled backwards into the others, and they collapsed in an inferno. They didn’t have the basic survival instincts to run away from the flames, they just burned. Barbeau stirred. His hand began to reach out, but he too was caught in the blaze. We only had a few seconds to move past them before the entire hallway was lit up. I pushed Em forward and then I had to make a leap. My pant leg was singed but I made it. Maybe all the caked on mud helped.

 

We stumbled quickly towards the exit, trying to outrun the smoke and flames, but I stopped at the maternity ward. I wanted so badly to be able to do something, but they were so far beyond my or anyone’s help. They were corpses. All I could hope for was that the smoke would get through the oxygen masks and take them quickly before the fire did, and their suffering would end. Em pulled me away and we continued on. The flames spread slowly across the vines and leaves that were strewn along the ceiling and walls. The smoke spread so much faster.

 

Our pace quickened as our lungs constricted. I expected to hear more screams as the fire spread but… I didn’t. We ran through the vines at the end of the tunnel and fell out onto the grass. Immediately we could breathe again. Still coughing, almost passing out, but we made it. We were free. The nightmare that had plagued us for decades was at an end.

 

Em and I slowly caught our breath and rose back to our feet. I looked at her and she looked at me. Then she lunged towards me, wrapping her arms around me tight. I just got my breath back, but it was taken out again. This time I was okay with it. She sobbed into my chest; I could feel her tears soaking into my shirt. I wrapped my arms around her too. I couldn’t think of anything to say, and I don’t think she could either.

 

We slowly made our way back; I saw the Hawthorn tree in the near distance. Sunlight began to beam over the horizon and the fog appeared to be thinning. The pain in my jaw began to rear its head, but I managed to kind of pop it back into place temporarily. It hurt a lot.

 

The horrors of this night seemed to be over… Except… As we got closer to the Hawthorn tree, something didn’t look right.

 

We both saw it as we got closer. Something was wrong. Something was so wrong. Em recognized it from last time. The tree looked… Wet. But it hadn’t rained. Then the tree started warping. Moving. Pulsating. It wasn’t just my vision distorting this time. As we got closer, the wetness became more clear. It was blood.

 

The tree was bleeding, and it was breathing. The blood soaked into the ground beneath it, softening it. Now even the ground began to breathe, and we began to sink.

 

I felt hands pulling me down once again except now… I could see them. There really were hands. They were everywhere. Hands, and other pieces of bodies. Not solid, but solid enough. The disposed remnants of failed experiments. Liquifying in their own endlessly pumping blood. Still alive. There was no bog. They were the bog. Em managed to find a stable piece of ground, but my legs were caught. I was going down. It was past my shins.

 

The bark of the tree looked moist and fleshy and it began to open. A big 7 foot tall vertical slit formed in the center of the tree. The sides curled outwards, and beneath it was a wall of bleeding flesh. Beneath that wall, a hand pressed against it. Then another hand. Then another. I saw what this was. I saw it inside the mine. This was the gynoecium. If the maternity ward produced those scarecrows, what did this produce?

 

I sank up to my thighs now. The hands reached and tugged at my arms and torso. Em tried but she couldn’t get to me. One of the hands within the tree pushed through. Steam rose into the sky, and a body began to climb out. The body was hairless, shiny, and coated in some king of translucent slime. But the face was unmistakable. Darren Barbeau.

 

As his torso rose over the threshold, it didn’t give way to a bottom half. The flesh continued into a big mound. More arms and legs sprouted from the mound. A dozen or more. More heads. More bodies. All molted together. A big tangled spider web of parts, but even the parts weren’t right. I saw a mouth on one of the feet. I saw an ear in the middle of a torso. I saw eyes coming out of a shoulder. Everything was wrong. This wasn’t how it was supposed to be. Killing Black Eyed Susan sent everything into madness.

 

I was unable to look away from the grotesque sight before me, but then I heard the chainsaw. Em started it, and was carving through the mud around me. Shredding hands and tendrils to pieces. I saw teeth and parts of bones flying all over. The sinking eased up and I was able to climb a few inches.

 

The mess of limbs, bodies, and heads stumbled out of the curtains of bleeding flesh without end. With every movement it made, it revealed more. Em screamed. Not a scream of terror this time, but a scream of rage and desperation. She ran towards it with the chainsaw in hand. I continued to slowly pull myself out of the mire.

 

All I could see were pieces flying, and the now familiar sight of waves of red and spurts of pale green ooze spraying and popping and exploding. It rained upon me. Every single mouth on the abomination was screaming, but Em didn’t stop.

 

I managed to pull myself completely out, and I ran over to Em. I grabbed her from behind and pulled her back, then turned to face the creature myself. Or what was left of it. Now just a quivering pile of bloody pieces.

 

A mouth in the middle of a stomach began to open, looking like it was trying to speak.

 

“Little-“

 

I flicked the lighter and sprayed a ball of fire into it. The pile lit up and screamed. Then I sprayed all around the tree. It took time. It pulsated and it oozed more and more blood, but it went up. I saw the hands in the mud violently shake and fall apart.

 

We staggered back and watched as it burned. Both of us were coated head to toe in all sorts of putrid mess. Smoke filled the sky, but the fog faded, and the sun was fully shining. It was finally over. I reached for her hand and she held it once more.

 

We waded through the forest and the marsh, no longer feeling the pull of the liquid flesh, and came out on the other side alive. We found Em’s car right where I parked it and we left.

 

There wasn’t a lot of conversation as we made our way back into town. We were both just too tired. Our sanity had been stretched beyond its limit and we had no idea how to process it.

 

We stopped at the motel, and I had the best shower of my life. We got changed, trashed our old clothes, and hit the road. I thought about staying at the motel. Resting a while. But we needed to get out of this place.

 

Em decided to go see her father again before she left. I was very hesitant, but he seemed to be doing better. Everyone did. The fog was gone. He didn’t appear to recall anything of our interaction last night, nor did he care to bring up anything else from the day before. They parted ways amicably. Em kept it together well.

 

We left the town and a massive weight lifted from my chest. We were on our way home. Eventually, Em broke the long incredulous silence.

 

“I’m sorry, Lie. I’m so sorry I dragged you into all this.”

 

“No.” I interrupted, but Em continued on.

 

“It was so selfish after all these years to make you come up here. To bring you into all my sh… problems. I almost got you killed! Or worse! I don’t even know…”

 

“You couldn’t have known. How the hell would you have ever known? It wasn’t on you. Don’t do that.”

 

“I can’t… I can’t stop thinking about it. It’s all that’s in my head.” I could hear Em about to break down. I wasn’t far off either.

 

“I know. I can’t either. Let’s just… not talk about it right now, okay? We only have a few hours left together and…”

 

“You’re right. I don’t want this to be how we… end things.”

 

“Yeah…” I responded, solemnly. I realized I really didn’t want this to end.

 

“Lie?” Em asked.

 

“Yeah?”

 

“Can we do your playlist? I just feel like mine is a bit much right now.”

 

I laughed for the first time since this all started. Things weren’t back to normal… I don’t think they would ever be… But we could be okay, just for right now.

 

She continued, “And, before we stop talking about it… Just… Thank you for saving me.”

 

It was a long trip back, but it didn’t feel long. All the things weighing on our minds made time pass quickly, even though we tried not to think about it. There was no shut eye, we didn’t even bother trying.

 

Before I knew it, Em pulled up to my building. We both got out, I gathered my bags, and we stood on the sidewalk. Neither of us felt ready to leave the other. Especially me. So, I persuaded her to come up to my apartment and have a coffee for the road.

 

I knew my place looked like shit, but I also knew Em never cared about all that. She spent lots of time in my shitty place as a kid. More importantly, after everything we went through… Who cares? It was difficult to care about anything anymore. I made her the coffee… There was still so much to say but I didn’t know how to say it.

 

“How long am I allowed to park out front there?” Em asked.

 

“Oh… Uh… You’re not.”

 

“What? Shoot! Lila!”

 

“I’m sorry! I didn’t think about that. You’re probably fine though. If you hurry, you’ll be fine.”

 

“Good lord, okay… Okay I guess I should go.”

 

A silence hung in the air for a moment.

 

“Yeah… You probably should.” I responded. I really didn’t want her to go. I didn’t want to be alone, and I didn’t want to be without her.

 

“Okay… You’ll come over or something soon, right?” Em asked, hopefully.

 

“I will. We’ll… We’ll make it work.”

 

“Good…” Em started making her way towards the door. “Thank you… For everything. I’m gonna miss you.”

 

“Yeah I’m gonna miss you too… Get home safe and everything, Em…” I uttered, awkwardly. Trying not to let the sadness or desperation show.

 

Em smiled a half smile and opened the door.

 

“I-“ The word escaped from my mouth, but I cut myself off before finishing the sentence. Em let go of the door and turned back to me.

 

“I don’t… want you to go.” I muttered. She looked at me silently, expecting to hear more. So I had to say more, even if I couldn’t form the thoughts correctly. Even if I might say too much.

 

“I need to say… I never told you… There’s so many things, and so many times I wanted to but I… I was afraid of things changing. I was afraid you wouldn’t…” I was stammering and stumbling. I couldn’t believe after all this, I still couldn’t just come out and say it. “I just don’t want to be apart. I don’t want to be alone. Especially after all this shit. And I… I can’t let you go without telling you, because I almost lost you and I just can’t-”

 

Em closed the distance between us, and without saying a word she leaned in and kissed me. I didn’t think my heart could take any more surprises, but this last one I welcomed. Pain shot through my dislocated jaw and I couldn’t have cared less. When she pulled away, she had tears in her eyes. I could feel them on my face. She must have seen how flustered I was because she laughed a little through the still flowing tears and caressed my cheek.

 

“Me too.”

 

So the trip didn’t end. I decided to get back in her car and we drove all the way to her place. I ended up staying for two weeks... What happened during those two weeks is ours to keep, and ours alone.

 

We talked to Em’s dad over the phone. Didn’t tell him about any of that, but he did tell us some things. The odd behavior in Willow Bay and some other surrounding areas did not go unnoticed. Tests were done and there was determined to be what they called some sort of bio weapon unleashed. An “aerosolized hallucinogenic drug” as they called it. Making everyone who breathed in enough of it prone to suggestion and vivid hallucinations.

 

I went back and forth about that. Certainly, that’s what happened to the town. That’s what hid in the fog. I figured that much already. But how far did that drug go? I would love to believe that everything I experienced that night was merely the product of excessive hypnotic drugs. The worst trip of all time. Then the earth I live in would make a lot more sense. I knew the bog was real. I knew the mine was real. I even knew the experiments were real. But the monsters… the scarecrows… the flesh… It would make sense if they weren’t real. I was expecting to see them, so I saw them. Classic hypnosis. But, every time I take a bite of food and my jaw clicks, I can’t help but doubt. It would be too easy.

 

I’m with Em again now. Its been four more weeks and I just moved the last of my stuff in. We’re doing well. We have nightmares almost every night, and crying fits every few days, but having eachother to hold on to makes it all bearable…

 

So that’s the story of Black Eyed Susan. Of Darren Barbeau. Of the untold and unthinkable horrors lurking in the dark. Beyond the edge of perception, comprehension, and sanity. Mine’s just one tale, of one little corner of the world. You might not know it, but your corner might have a monster in it too. Stay safe, everyone. Tell the people you love that you love them. I have to get back to Em now, we're planning a trip to somewhere cold. We might not end up going though, she’s been nauseous these past few days. So we’ll see.
