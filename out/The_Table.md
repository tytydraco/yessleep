A woman wakes up in a dark room with her hands in front of her like she’s gripping a steering wheel, and her body is tensed up bracing for an impact she will not feel. Just a second ago she was in her car and swerving into a tree, now she is at a table sitting across from a man she does not recognize. The same look of confusion and panic is on the other mans face. It dawns on her that the stranger is also unclear about what is going on. They are both seated in a comfortable chair with nothing else in the room but a wooden table dividing them and an overhead light giving just enough visibility to see each other and nothing beyond that. A third figure steps out from the darkness and stands at the table. He is nicely dressed in a suit and his face is just barely visible in the shadow.

“I am here to inform you that you have both died. Two completely separate incidents, but you are both dead none the less. From this point on we will decide the afterlife each of you are destined to. There are only two options available, you may know them as Heaven and Hell, but really there is only eternal paradise or damnation. One of you will be damned forever, and the other will have bliss until the end of time. You both get to decide who is destined to go where, but it has to be agreed upon by each of you. I have no say in the decision, I am only here to assist the decision you decide upon.”

The man speaks up first. He is wearing a black button up shirt with a white clergy collar, resembling his time as a priest on Earth. He was fifty-eight years old when he had a heart attack at his breakfast table, collapsing and dying in front of his sister just before they were about to leave for church. His name was David. 

“This hardly seems fair!” He exclaims in an outburst. He hasn’t fully grasped the situation he is in and is looking for any answer he can find for validation in his own thought of the afterlife.

“It isn’t fair. But where is it written that all things must be fair? Everything was not fair on Earth, so why would it be any different here after your death? People were born with mental and physical disabilities every day, but you never questioned if it was fair, you told yourself it was part of Gods plan.” The man in the middle said this with a tone of voice that spoke as if everything was factual. 

The priest reclined further into his chair and his eyes stared at the table in disbelief. It was becoming more real to him with each passing second. He looked up and asked another question; “Who are you?”.

“I do not have a name that you will know me as. I am the neutral commentator that answers all questions you may have. I know everything about you and the life you have lived. I am all knowing. I appear to you in a way that is exactly as you would perceive me. Some see the Devil, some see God, often times I am a human figure without a distinguishable face.”

At this point the woman decides to speak. She was twenty-six years old, went by the name of Becca and was beautiful in a way that doesn’t gain the attention of everyone, but is subtle and recognized by people that know her. She lived a simple life with no real goals, but big dreams. Her life now revolves around being a mother and was on her way to drop her seven year old daughter off at school.

“Oh my god! What about my daughter?! What about Katie? What happened to her?! Is she okay?!” She asked as tears began to well up in her eyes. 

The man spoke without changing tone from before. “I am speaking to her now and explaining the same things I have said to you. She is no longer your daughter and was only tied to you before through birth. From here on she is just another soul that will reside in what you call Heaven or Hell”.

At this thought the woman broke down into tears and could only focus on the loss of her daughter. Nothing else going on around her seemed to matter and she could barely get out the words when she asked, “Why isn’t she here with me? Why are we separated? We were both in that car! She was right there with me!”

“Who you are placed with at the table is decided by time of death. There are only two people for each table. This man died four seconds before your collision, and was going to be sat across from whoever on Earth was the next to die. You were sitting in the front seat, so you died first. Would you have preferred to be sitting across from your daughter, deciding who will suffer and who will not?”

David was still in shock and now he was also feeling disgust. “How could you do that?! Make a mother and daughter decide their own afterlife?!” 

“There is no favoritism or reason behind who is sat across from each other, except for time of death. I have seen a mother and her unborn child both die during labor, both sitting across from each other. The baby could not speak, so the mother was in full control of their destinies. Would it comfort you to know that when a baby dies, they often are sent to damnation? Many people, having the singular vote in this situation, decide to save themselves. Few people choose for the baby to go into heaven, and those that do tell themselves they are doing the right thing. But is it the right thing? You don’t owe the child any favors, and your decision will not be judged or have any consequences. The soul of a baby has not had a chance to sin or give a reason to be tortured for eternity, but it has not earned paradise just for the sake of being born.”

The man and woman both looked at each other in silence, but sharing the same thoughts. The thought that this was madness. It was sickening. They had no way of knowing such a vile task would greet them after their death. To break the silence, the man in the middle spoke up. 

“There is no time here, nor is there a time limit on when your decision will have to be made. You are free to discuss anything and everything you both would like to help make the decision easier on yourselves. There are people that have discussed spending eternity here in this room, but the loneliness and boredom eventually sets in. The darkness around you becomes very mundane. We have these surroundings to keep the full focus on both of you, without providing any distractions. After over one hundred years of the same company, you run out of anything to do and say. The weaker of the two usually gives in first and settles on going to Hell if it means leaving here. There is no need to eat, sleep, or drink after death, so all you will be doing is this. You can start justifying your reasons for Heaven whenever you like.”

For the first time in his life, David was unsure of everything he ever thought he knew. He devoted himself to the church and whole heartedly worshiped Jesus Christ as his lord. He had his moments of doubts in his faith, but the doubts were erased and his faith was quickly restored when he found that one of his previous prayers had been answered. His prayer for his mother to make it through the cancer that had developed and was told would take her life. He prayed for God to rid her of cancer, to make sure she was healthy and whole again. During the time of her treatments is when he started to doubt his religion that he had believed since the time he could think for himself. David questioned why a loving God would allow a church going woman that was nothing but good to be cursed with this cancer. He almost stopped going to church, but when he had almost given up, his mother was free of the cancer in her body for good. He saw it as a sign from God. It was all a test of his own faith. This told David that the Lord knew the entire time that his mother would be okay, but he wanted to see if David would lose his love for God. He then saw how weak he was in that moment and almost gave up everything he believed in. He decided to strengthen his relationship with Christ by following the path to becoming a priest for the Roman Catholic Church. He shared his story with many other people that found themselves questioning their own beliefs. He felt like this was where he belonged and loved preaching. He was passionate about sharing his faith with others and was always willing to talk. But in this moment, David was completely silent.

Becca was still coming to terms with the loss of her daughter. She wasn’t thinking about her own passing, only focusing on how for the first time in her life as a mother she was unable to comfort her child. She knew that Katie was scared and confused, and she wanted nothing more than to be with her wherever she went. She wondered if there was a way to know what was happening with her daughter right now and asked, “Who is Katie with right now? Who is sitting across the table from her?”. She asked this with tears running down her face.

“His name was Bryan White.” The man in the middle spoke.

“Can you tell me about him?” She asked

“I can tell you everything you want to know. He was a thirty-four year old police officer with a family of his own. A wife, a daughter, and a son that he loved very much. His death came abruptly while he was on the job.”

Becca took a little comfort in knowing that her daughter was with what seemed to be a kind hearted man. If he had a family of his own, it would be harder for him to condemn a child to eternal damnation. She also believed that because he was a police officer, he would have the natural compassion to help other people.

The man spoke again. “Do not let your daughters fate sway you on which way to go. The time you spent with her in life is nothing compared to the eternity you would potentially be without her in death. All the love that you feel now will slowly dissipate over the course of thousands of years. And after one thousand years, there will be hundreds of thousands more where your mind will be occupied by other things. If you go to Hell, you will forget her within a days time. The suffering will be far too great. You will not be able to focus on anything else. If you are to go to Heaven, your memory of her will slowly fade into nothing. You will forget her appearance, times spent together, and eventually even her name.”

This brought Becca no comfort at all. She couldn’t imagine even being capable of forgetting her daughter for just one second. She had never felt a love so strong as the one she felt for Katie, and didn’t think was possible to lose such a feeling. Even though the man at the table told her not to dwell on this, she couldn’t help but to think that she wanted to be wherever Katie went. 

David now decided that this decision process needed to begin. He had spent too much of his life driven by the goal of achieving eternal peace, and he was always terrified of the idea of Hell. While he was alive, he never considered that he would end up in Hell. He always told himself that he would follow the path of a holy man and do whatever it took to be with God in Heaven. Even during the time of questioning his faith he didn’t stop to think about his possibility of burning forever in the depths of Hell. David never imagined he would be damned, and he wasn’t going to start imaging it now either. So he spoke to Becca for the first time since they woke up together in this room. 

“In my life I was a priest, devoted to worshiping the Lord and doing all that was right with him. I spent every day in his graces and spent countless hours reading his word. Were you religious as well?” He asked her, hoping they might have common ground to stand on with each other.

Becca answered, “No, I never was. My parents never went to church, so I never saw it as an interest growing up. I had curiosities, but I never tried to learn more. I didn’t think about it really. I just went on with my life.” She said all of this through sniffles and tears that just seemed to puddle in her eyes now. She was slowly pulling herself together, but not hurting any less than before.

The man in the middle spoke again. “Religion plays no role here. You are both equal in that aspect. None of the religions on Earth matter after death, because none of them are of any importance. Every God is a false representation of hope and an answer for questions of creation or the laws of nature. The idea of questioning creation would not exist without creation itself. Human consciousness realizes that there must be a point of creation and an end to all things. These do not exist. On an infinite scale measuring time, all things will happen. Among those things is a planet that is home to beings able to think and comprehend. The small brains of a human can not comprehend the truth, so they created a simple answer for what they were searching for. God.”

David feels disgusted and wronged by what he is hearing. He felt the warmth of Gods love in church. He knew by his prayers being answered and the miracles happening every day, that there was a God that loved him. He could not accept that this was a lie, when almost everyone he knew was so confident in their faith. How could a false religion build itself up to something that was worldwide and believed by so many? How could all the churches in all the nations be preaching about something that wasn’t true? To be told in this moment that this was what came after death still did not fully resonate with him, but he had to accept the situation he was in regardless. He made a choice in his head that shocked even him when he spoke it out loud.

“As a man that tries to always do what’s right, and attempts to put others before myself, I am willing to go to Hell. If the Heaven we are sent to is not the one of Jesus, then I do not belong there.” 

The man in the middle interfered here, “You think that by sacrificing yourself to damnation that you will somehow be saved. You are hoping that the willingness to send someone else to paradise instead of yourself is enough to save your soul as well. I know exactly what you are thinking David. You do not wish to truly do this, you are hoping that your courageous act will keep you from suffering. That will not be the case. The fire will burn for you just as hot as it burns for everyone else that resides there.”

David was caught and he knew it. He did think that there would be some kind of redemption if he were to willingly send himself. He thought being a hero would have some kind of reward. He began to truly be afraid.

“Does this change your decision?”, the man in the middle asked David.

“…Yes”, he replied timidly. 

With everything David knew before now meaning absolutely nothing, he felt vulnerable. He felt completely lost and helpless. Becca started to see this, and started to understand that they both truly were equal in death. She started to grasp the reality that no matter what was said between them, they would both be just two humans that did not want to become tormented souls. How is anyone supposed to come to a conclusion on such a permanent commitment? How could this possibly be resolved?

Becca switched her focus to something else. Faced with all of what was going on, she couldn’t help but wonder what her daughter would have grown up to be. Katie wanted to be a veterinarian. She always loved animals and especially loved their two dogs at home. Two dogs that are now left without someone to care for them. Becca lived out of state from the rest of her family and wasn’t close with her neighbors. She wondered how long it would be until someone went and checked on them. She started wishing she spent more time making friends or strengthening her bond with current acquaintances. She poured herself into being a good mother with every fiber of her being, with no focus on her own personal life. Becca had never been close to her family after moving out to live on her own. When Katie was born, it seemed to pull her even further away from them. Katie was a part of this new life, in a different state, with a man that the family did not know. They slowly dwindled away and out of Becca’s life completely. They surely would not take care of the dogs left behind. She decided to ask a question, uncertain whether she would receive an answer.

“If the accident didn’t happen, what would have happened to Katie? I mean…what would she have grown up to do with her life?” She asked while looking up at the man. His face still hidden in shadows. She could see that he had the features of a man, but could not distinguish them. 

“The accident was always bound to happen. There is no account where it does not occur. Everything is predetermined. There is not another timeline where this does not happen, because only the one timeline exists.”

David expressed anger in his voice after hearing this. “So are you saying we never had any free will?!”

The man at the side of the table is unshaken by David’s rage. His tone of voice remains the same regardless of what he says. “You do have free will. Everything you did was done by your own accord. The past, present, and future all exist as one whole piece. It is a dimension you cannot see or feel, but it exists to me as an entity that can be read. I see it all as one big object that does not change. Just because it is said in advance what will happen or what you will do, does not mean that you weren’t capable of doing it by your own power. I know what will happen, the same way that you knew the sun would come up every morning. It is just the nature of things, and you did not question it. The same can be said about time. I see it all as one object created out of every moment in time to form a spherical shape. I can view it all as a whole.”

This provokes a thought in David’s mind. If everything is predetermined, then the choice made in this room is already known as well. He asks, “So then you know what will be decided in this room already?”

“I do.”

“And what is the answer? Where do I end up?” David asks, really only concerned for his own eternity. 

“You will know sooner than you expect.”

Becca feels the obligation to ask a question that most people always wonder. The question that most of us say we will ask when we meet whoever greets us after death. The question that some decide they have the answer to already. “So what was the meaning of all of it? What is the meaning of life?”

The man gives an answer that nobody wants to hear. “There is no meaning. There is no purpose. Everything just is. It is common for humans to assume that because they are alive there needs to be a reason for it. But the truth is, there is no reason anything exists, other than that you do.”

David replies with a question that just occurs to him. “Then why do a Heaven and Hell exist? What’s the purpose of it?”

The response from the man is blunt. “Once again, there is no purpose. It just is. It’s the way it has always been. Before humans, there were other beings that lived. There are beings that live now that are unable to be perceived by Earth. Eventually all things on Earth will die, and there will be another planet that supports the same kind of life. Earth will not even be remembered. Everything you have ever known will turn to ash.”

This is all too much for David to comprehend at the time. The information is overwhelming to him. Everything he thought he knew before seems so microscopic in comparison to the truth. “Why do you do this? Why give us a choice in what happens when we die? It’s hardly a choice at all! Why now, do we get to control where we end up forever?”

“You were brought into this life without your consent. You had no say in whether you would be born or not. You were forced to live, without a choice of whether or not you wanted to. Now is your chance to decide. Think of it as a second life. This time you are capable of deciding for yourself what happens next.”

“But who would willingly choose Hell? Why would anyone choose that when given the chance of Heaven?”

Becca softly speaks up “Has Katie made her decision yet?”

“She has.”

“Oh God, where did she go?!” Becca begs for an answer to soothe her. She is hopeful yet terrified of the answer. She doesn’t know how she will react to whatever news she is given. Regardless of what she was told earlier, she still perceives herself as the mother of Katie, and has attached her decision to the placement of her daughters soul.

“Hell.” Said the man without a change of expression.

Becca breaks down into tears worse than before. Her stomach is aching with pain and her heart feels like it will burst from her chest. She has never felt pain like this before, and can’t imagine anything worse. She screams out “Send me with her! I can’t let her go alone! I’m her mother!! Why did you send her to Hell?!”

“I did not send her to hell. I told you before, the decision is your own. She made her choice to go to Hell.”

Becca cries out in pain and is barely able to speak. “Why would she do that?! Why?!”

David sits silent, also wondering why she would choose it. He is curious to hear the answer, praying to himself that it provides help in his own decision to be made. Praying to nobody, but it is all he knows.

The man at the table explains the situation of Katie and why she would choose such inferno over salvation. “She was easily persuaded. The mind of a child assumes that adults know best. They are innocent in mind and often assume that adults are good natured. She was not able to grasp the outcome of her decision. She could not comprehend what eternity means, let alone what Hell will be like. She was told that it wouldn’t be so bad, and that the man had to wait in Heaven for his own family to join him. When finding out that this man had a family, she felt wrong denying them the ability to be together. He also told her that she would meet you there in Hell as well.”

“Why didn’t you stop her?! Why did you let him tell her that?! He lied to her! I’m not in Hell!” Becca was beyond upset. She couldn’t control her emotions. 

“He did not lie to her.”

The realization of what was said hit Becca and David at the same time. The answer to where they would go became apparent in that moment. David felt a relief, while Becca felt nothing. David looked at Becca and felt sympathy towards her. For all of this to happen to her was terrible. For a short moment he almost decided to let her go to Heaven instead, but that moment came and went very quickly.

Becca wasn’t thinking straight but in her heart she knew what her choice was going to be. She couldn’t turn away from her daughter. She couldn’t abandon her in a time where Katie was more afraid than she had ever been. She couldn’t stand to think that she could go on to Heaven and be happy in a world without Katie. She had made up her mind. “Send me to Hell.”

The man at the table has still shown no emotion, he was just a presence that provided facts. “I know that you have made the decision with full knowledge of the consequences. This is the choice you have made, do you stand by it?”

“Yes!” Becca bursted out loudly through her flowing tears. “Yes, just let me be with her!”

The man then asked David, “Have you decided to go to Heaven, and allow her soul to be damned?”

David spoke quickly, ignoring the weight of what was happening and only feeling joy. “Yes! I do!”

“Then it is done.”

In an instant a pillar of fire appeared in front of David, engulfing Becca entirely. He could see her eyes widen and mouth open to let out a violent scream. A scream using every bit of oxygen in the lungs all at once. It was a loud shriek that was gone within a second but echoed in the room after the flame left as quickly as it came. In that short moment, she felt more pain than she thought was possible. Every nerve in her body was consumed by a heat with a temperature hotter than one thousand suns, but instead of burning the nerves it will continue on forever, never dulling. It’s a suffering that cannot be registered by anything felt before. It is a torment felt on a level that only exists in Hell. In that single second, Becca completely forgot about Katie.

A light started to shine into the room from behind David. It was coming through a doorway that wasn’t behind him before. He could see that there was a colorful crystal like ambiance coming from inside the door. There were colors he had never even seen before. It was the most beautiful sight he had ever witnessed, but he sat still in his chair. He felt no delight in what happened, and grief started to settle into him. Witnessing what happened to Becca had frightened him in a way that filled him with guilt. He felt like it was his fault that she would be condemned to the fate of enteral agony. 

“I…I change my mind. I will take her place.” David barely got out, not believing what he was saying. He didn’t want to take her place, but he didn’t want her to suffer either.

“It has already been done. You cannot change your decision now.”

“But she doesn’t deserve that! Nobody deserves that!” 

“No. But nobody ever questions if one deserves never ending ecstasy. They only focus on the punishment given, nobody ever questions what they did to deserve unending pleasure. What did you do in your life where you are worthy of such a reward? Do you think your short time on Earth is deserving of what you have earned?”

David didn’t move. The lights sparkled in front of him along with a sound of what could only be described as angels harmonizing. As he stood up to walk through the doorway, he hesitated. How could he be happy after all he had learned? How could he walk among people that sent infants into those flames? A serial killer could have sat at that table with a newborn baby and had no second thoughts about what choice he was to make. They were going to be in the same place as him after he spent his entire life helping others and being obedient to God. How could this be the way things turn out? A father has sat at that table with their son, forced to make that unholy decision. A doctor has sat at that table after years of helping people, forced to decide if the person across from him was worth saving. There is no combination of people that make the decision right. A murderer may feel regret for their actions in the past, and decide that they should be the ones to burn, but even their sins of the past do not grant them such suffering as Hell. There is no justice in what took place. There is no reasoning behind it. It just is.

David was about to step into the light when he turned around. The table was gone. There was no more light. The all knowing entity was gone. He stood still looking into the doorway. His only option was to walk through, but he couldn’t bring himself to do it.
