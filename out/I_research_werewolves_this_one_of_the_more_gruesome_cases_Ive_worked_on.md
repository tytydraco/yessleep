You read the title right. I’m a werewolf researcher, well, the proper term is lycanthropologist. For years me and my colleagues have been called crazy and demoted to mere pseudoscientists when presenting our finds, but now we have irrefutable evidence of our claims. People are finally starting to open their eyes to the strange creatures we share our world with. But I’m getting ahead of myself, you’re not here for long talks about science are you? You’re here for the gruesome accounts of my experiences with these animals. Unfortunately, there’s not a lot of stories like those, a lot of the time we just end up examining tracks or blurry pictures or yell at someone who thought it would be funny to dress up as a werewolf and run around in the dead of night. But you’re in luck, for there’s one story I think you may find interesting.

It was near the beginning of my career, I was only a young man, in my late 20s. It was soon after we managed to prove the existence of lycanthropes and were now allowed research sightings that had been sent in. The most recent call had led me to an elderly couple who lived in a small rural village, saying that they went on holiday and left their daughter to housesit for them. But when they returned, the place looked like it had been turned upside down with the daughter nowhere in sight and a particularly awful smell coming from the basement. They called the police, but when they described what they found, they were directed to us instead. They didn’t seem to happy about that, as when I first arrived and tried to question them, they started yelling at me for turning a potential crime into some “conspiracy theory bullshit.” I somehow managed to calm them down and get them to answer my questions. They gave me their daughter’s description, information about her background as a hunter, and that the whole reason that they had her housesit was because of a rise of breaking and enterings in the area. Then, reluctantly, they let me inside.

They certainly weren’t lying about the state of this place. The first thing I noticed was a door ripped off it’s hinges and left lying in the middle of the hallway, the doorway it was previously attached to led to a guest bedroom which was as equally torn up as the rest of the house. I walked past the living room and down the hallway towards a dresser that had been pulled down, its glass panels and what seemed to be fine china sets now shattered and spread across the floor. I noticed that something must’ve cut itself on the shards as they were covered with old dried blood and there was a trail of it leading to a door on the left. Judging by the sign saying “let’s eat!” I assumed it was the kitchen and stepped in.

A horrible stench hit my nose as I was treated with a site I won’t forget for a long time. Whole cabinets were torn off the walls and thrown across the room, knives were strewn about plastered with blood, as was the floor, the walls and in some parts, the ceiling. The stench got worse as I got closer to a door in the far corner, the basement. I opened it up and was met with the mangled corpse of a half woman, half wolf, her lifeless eyes staring back up at me from the bottom of the ladder in a frozen expression of terror, maggots peeling out her lips and nostrils. She’s been here for a while. Some glass shards and kitchen knives were still wedged in her back and she was covered in large gashes. Self inflicted, guessing from the blood on her claws. Despite what some films may have you think, a lycanthrope’s transformation is long and tortuous for both the mind and the body. Her last shred of humanity was terrified of what she was becoming, but her fear was replaced by an animalistic one, so rather than act rationally, she was probably attempting to pull off her new, fur laden skin. Surprisingly, this isn’t enough to kill a lycanthrope, they’re very durable creatures. The physical toll of the transformation and the pure fear she was experiencing was too much for her heart, and it gave out while she was trying to find a dark space, the wreckage likely being caused by her being disoriented by the bright lights. This is all knowledge that I’ve learnt since then, at that moment, I had no idea what to do. 

I left the house in a state. I told the couple their daughter was dead, but to not bother looking at her body. I lied to them and said she passed peacefully and painlessly and told them people would be here to pick up the body later that day, then they can look at her, the lights in the morgue would flatter her more than a dim lightbulb in a dark, dank basement.
