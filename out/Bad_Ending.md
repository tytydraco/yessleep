The sky was deep blue. No other person in sight. No clouds whatsoever in the sky. But even though the sun was shining bright the road was fade and dark. 

There was complete silence when all of a sudden a quite whisper came up. After looking around there was no person in sight. The whisper was not understandable in the slightest. The whisper sounded like a something talking gibberish while using a lowered voice.

After a while the whisper stopped. A feeling of unease came up aswell as a feeling that somthing bad will happen soon. The end of the road is still aeast a couple miles away so just keep walking was the only solution.

Going on step by step was familiar. Having walked this road a couple thousand times was so familiar that not noticing anything different this time was impossible. The feeling is not describable to someone who wasnt walking this road that often. A feeling only someone with the same experience would understand.

Sometime later the whispering started again this time louder and more penetrating than the last time. It was hard to relax knowing nothing close could cause this whisper. Even the voice was different, it was deeper. But the gibberish was the same as before.

Bearing this whisper for a long time is unfathomable. Its like having a hive full of humming bees near. But it is worse than being stung by the bees. Just a continuous humming with no stop or pause.

After slowly becoming accustomed to the continuous humming it started fading and became more quite. With the whispering fading a feeling of unease came up again. But that wouldnt stop a person walking this road.

This road is in the middle of nowhere. Just a plain grass field going on for tens of miles. There is no tree, flower or any sign of life. No sane person would choose this road or atleast stop and turn around after a mile. 

The feeling of unease got worse and the intuition of a sane person would tell them to run and hide. But only sane people would react that way. But knowing this road its already too late to turn around at this point. 

This is road is like a seperate dimension cut from the rest of the world. Its only connection would be the beggining and end. Everytime you walk here it seems like you never have been here before... like a new experience. 

While thinking pressure puts on an eye. It was like an icy touch so unsettling. This feeling will cause any person goosebumps. 

The "thing" touching one eye wouldnt stop. Its been sometime since it started but still it feels like torture. The only option is to keep going step by step. 

Suddenly the pressure increases and the feeling hurts even more. The pressure slowly fades as suddenly a sting in the eye comes. Where was it coming from. What was it causing. Those feelings keep someone in this situation sane but now a slight sting appears on the other eye. Many people would rather die than experience this. The sting lets someone feel as each layer of the eye gets peeled off. The nose starts bleeding and a beeping starts in the ear.

Some might not fell it anymore but now the nails of both hands are being ripped out. After the nails on the hands, the nails on the feet are ripped out too. One by one. 

In this mortal state someone might feel weak. But even with that feeling there is no other option but going on step by step. 

Seeing the end of the road after a long keep going was the best. Going for a run to escape this torture will just extend the way one need to go. 

Just before reaching the end the feeling stops. The pain in the hands, feet and eyes stop. 

But after setting feet on the next road just before releasing a sigh, the returning feeling of unease proclaims one more go.
