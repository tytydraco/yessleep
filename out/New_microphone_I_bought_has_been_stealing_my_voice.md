A couple of weeks ago, I (m 20) was thinking to myself, I am a drop out college student and don’t want to keep going to my daytime job, so why not go into acting. I do some searching for some auditions I can do and think, I have to get a microphone so I seem legit. I didn’t know what I was looking for, but I was looking up “microphone for sale” on google and see what’s in my price range. 

I eventually found a microphone marked as rarely used on Facebook marketplace for only a hundred bucks. I looked up the model and the reviews for this type of microphone and found that it had great reviews and was selling for 3,000 bucks normally. I grew suspicious and decided to message this person asking hey is this still available? I was surprised to see after I sent the message that they almost immediately replied with a yes. I ask if they can get me a picture of the microphone that wasn't shown on the price listing. This would mean that I would have more confidence that I wasn’t getting scammed. Surprisingly I got a picture that seemed legit. I said “I’d be willing to buy it and would like to meet up maybe at a Walmart nearby my hometown and I can pay in cash.” He agreed and we set up a date for the weekend at around noon.

After that interaction, my first thoughts were, “He probably doesn’t know what he was selling, but not my problem, I’m gonna get my acting career on the map.” We meet up and he’s really sweaty and seems really stressed out. I was hoping that what I was getting wasn't stolen. He handed me the microphone in a cardboard box and I handed him the money. He acted weirdly throughout the whole thing, especially since he didn’t speak the whole time we met. It felt like we were doing something illegal when it was just me buying a microphone.

After I got the home, I immediately opened it up and connected it to my PC. I opened up OBS and did a few test recordings. Everything was working properly and the sound was crisp. “Heck yes I am going to be so famous” I thought.

I immediately began joining multiple discord servers and giving my auditions to all sorts of projects: main characters, side characters, main antagonists, even just background character white noise. Every performance I sent off, I felt I was getting better and better as an actor.I only stopped when I lost my voice and water couldn’t even get my voice back. After hundreds of auditions my voice was ready for a rest and turned off Discord. Now all that I needed to do was wait for the auditions to come back with a rejected message or a callback/acceptance message.

The next day I woke up and I was feeling terrible, my throat still hurt, but didn’t think anything of it since I had been auditioning all night the night before. It was nothing some ibuprofen and some water won’t fix. I hop on Discord and after a few hours and multiple messages from multiple project directors, mostly rejections unfortunately, my voice still seemed very hoarse. I thought to myself, “Man I really destroyed my voice, I gotta pace myself next time.” I had OBS running in the background in case my voice came back. I then get a private call from my friend (f 28) and I put her. We talk about how I am trying to do acting and how her breakup was going. 

I then had to leave for the bathroom so I told her I would be right back. I was only there for a few minutes and heard a voice I didn’t recognize. I didn’t really hear what was being said since it wasn’t a very clear voice. It didn’t help that the walls of the bathroom and my room were thin as hell. The voice sounded like an older man who was around my moms age. I thought to myself, “is my friend already moving on with another guy and an older one at that?” I come back and ask her who that guy was. She asked me who that guy was, as it was on my end and not hers. I confusingly say “I’m on my own, your telling me that wasn't on your end?” She then tells me no and that she’s also on her own. I look around to make sure there was no one around, looking out the window and into the hallway of my apartment. There was no one. I tell her to look around and make sure she’s safe since its just her. She looks around and agrees that it would not be stupid to come in as it’s broad daylight where she’s at. I get worried and say that I gotta go and that id hop on a call with her later and leave the call. I decided to reluctantly go to bed, but I had the idea of putting OBS in recording mode so that way, any sounds that might be taken in Discord would get recorded and I could get a police report going the next morning. 

That night I was hearing multiple voices, one of which I could have sworn was my own. I had not been known to sleep talk so I got really scared. I woke up and with my flashlight on my phone I flash who I would expect to be some sort of intruder or animal or something. The light flashes and there is nothing. The only thing that’s there is my PC with OBS and Discord still running. I turn off the recording software and look at the video and audio. To my surprise there is no voices and no person joining the lobby. There’s no way, I know what I heard. I turn off the computer and try to go back to sleep. That’s when I hear the scariest thing I’ve ever heard. I hear the discord entrance sound and In my own voice I clearly hear, “your not going to find me.” I turn around and the computers still off. I run out of my apartment in terror and call the police. They come by and they take a police report. They suggest I try to get some sleep and maybe try to sleep elsewhere. I had a bad voice then but now it’s gotten worse. I had not recovered and was now starting to have issues speaking in normal sentences.

That brings us to today. I have also been hearing multiple voices coming from the computer, even when the computer is off. I’ve made multiple bug reports to Discord, but have been told there’s no problems. I’ve been told that I might need to get out more, but I know what I’ve heard. I don’t know what else to do and I’m running out of ideas on how to get my voice back so I can do some more auditions. I don’t want to throw away the computer or the microphone but it’s one of the only things I can think to do right now.
