Clap for the Dogman

The Dogman followed me home from a hike earlier this year. It stalked me and even tried entering my home. I am not an avid story teller but this is my best recollection of what happened:

My friend Alex and I went hiking on 6/18/23. Series of trails near Mount St. Helens in Washington.

It was a 12 hour day. We both had supplies and food for 2 days in case it was needed. When we left we knew how dangerous the trip would be.

However, you had no idea how much evil we would bring home.


The first few hours of our hike were standard. We took a couple breaks to pace ourselves. Alex was not an experienced hiker. On one of our bathroom breaks i heard a scream.

Alex came running back to the trail, fear stamped on his face. 

“What happened” I quarried.

“I saw something”

Upon questioning him it was revealed he saw something I had too. The Dogman.



A few day later back home was watching TV. It was almost midnight, and I was about to go to bed. I then heard a terrible howl coming from outside.


I had heard something once before. I knew it was the dogman. I saw it. It was 8 feet tall. Glowing eyes. It had the shape of a wolf standing on its hind legs. Instead of paws at the end of its front legs were terrible claws.


I was terrified, almost paralyzed. But remembering what my grandmother taught me i pulled my hands apart and placed them parallel to each other. With a sudden movement and clasped them together in a violent manner. Again. and and Again. 

I heard a terrible shriek and the sound of running. I knew the creature had been averted.

The noise scared away the stalking Dogman. Every night I am fearful it will return. So I clap three times scare away the dogman.


I was curious if this is a known defense against the dogman so I began researching it online. Even googling “dogman clapping” brought up results of those claiming clapping will scare it away. Some even as recent as last month.


I knew this verified my encounter and made me believe that the only way to scare away the dogman is to clap for the dogman.


This is when the horror starts. 


I sought comfort in Dogman related forums across the internet. Se even here on reddit. Anytime I mentioned how I used clapping to scare away the dogman people would either mock me or ban me.

I realized there was a pro-dogman cult that was trying to hide the simple way to defeat Dogman. Even the offical subreddits and top youtube channels have been infected.


Just writing this post puts me in danger, Reddit will ban me for exposing their complicity in this. And many subs will ban you just for commenting here. 

But

We MUST stand tall. Dogman can be defeated.

Just clap.


Thats right. 



Again so we can all hear you
