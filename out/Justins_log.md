Tuesday 9/10/1999

Today me, Jake, Tyler, and John are going camping this is going to be one helluva trip before college.  
We are all in the truck we are hyped out of our minds Tyler says we are going to get wasted I've never been big on alcohol, but I might give it a shot.  
I noticed someone or something outside of the car staring at the road I told John but he laughed and said it's all in my big noggin, but I know I saw it or am I actually going crazy who knows?

Wednesday 9/11/1999  
We had a big bonfire and we told a scary story, I swore I saw something black darting around the trees   
but everyone laughed at me I got pretty embarrassed after that so I stopped talking, I didn't get any sleep last night it felt like someone staring at me all night, they are curious about my log but I refuse to share.

Thursday 9/12/1999  
Today John went to use the bathroom and he has not returned, I'm worried about him everyone seems to be relaxed about the situation but I'm still on edge I'm going to go look for him if he doesn't come back in a couple hours...  
  
Friday 9/13/1999  
It's around three in the morning and I'm looking for John everyone stayed back so its just me lazy sons of bitches, while I'm taking my sweet ass time I'm going to explain why and where I get this time to make these logs, I write before bed or when I get time for some writing or when something interesting happens, I'll keep you updated.
