It started out with me just dawdling around near my car. I was just getting back from picking up some groceries from Target. I finished putting the bags behind my backseat along with some of my artwork. Just as I shut the door I felt the tip of a gun held to my forehead.

  
“Get in the car, disobey and I shoot.” a man's voice rang from behind.

  
I eagerly followed his instructions. Most people would dread being held hostage. I, however, was thrilled for the company. You see, I'm an extroverted person with an introvert’s lifestyle. Being able to get close with ANYBODY was a blessing for me. Even if I might die, I could at least interact with my captor. 

  
I made my way to the driver's seat. My captor slid to the seat behind me. He still pointed the gun at me. I buckled my seatbelt in, he did not. I silently prayed we wouldn't get into an accident on the way to his destination.

  
“So, where you want me to take ya?” I asked him. 

  
He barked out the address. I won't be telling you it for privacy reasons, but it was an old abandoned parking garage.   


  
I looked at the rearview mirror. My captor was wearing a black hoodie to match his black pants. He wore a plain white mask, no doubt acquired from the nearby Michael’s. Next to him was a black duffel bag, probably filled with cash.

  
I started the car.

  
I broke the silence in the car. “So, what's in the bag?”

  
“A rare african bird called noneofyabuisness.” He snapped back.

  
“Oh, you watch Family Guy too?” I recall the scene that quote originated from. It was from that old guy who was planning to catch kids. It was really dark once you thought of it, but the producers made it funny.   


  
“Shut up and drive.”

  
“I'm doing that right now”

  
Awkward silence ensued.

  
“So, you go on Reddit much?” I inquired

  
“No” He spat out

  
“Oh, well, you like scary stories?”

  
“Sure, why?”

  
“Do you like them long or Short?”

  
“Short”

  
“Then you NEED to go on this subreddit called-”

  
“I dont go on reddit, i just told you that.” He interrupted.

  
Awkward silence ensued. My captor looked mildly surprised that he had a brief conversation with his hostage.

  
“Shocking isn't it?” I spoke.

  
“What?”

  
“Usually your hostages beg for their life, yet I'm not.”

  
“You planning something?”

  
“No, just letting you notice that I respect you.”

  
“...”

  
“You know, I actually like this.”

  
“You what?”

  
“Yeah, probably because i'm codependent or something, that's why i call myself ‘codependent Caden’”

  
“I'm not sure that's how codependency works.”

  
“Oh, okay. Names Caden by the way.”

  
“You already told me.”

  
“What's your name?”

  
“Dude, I'm not giving you my name.”

  
“Oh, right, the whole ‘hostage getaway driver’ thing.”

  
Awkward silence ensued.

  
“Hey, I just noticed your bag is on my paintings.”

  
I usually put my paintings in the backseat of my car to separate them from groceries and such. I heard my captor quickly move his bag to the floor of my car. A slight gasp escaped his lips.

  
The style of my paintings are usually described as macabre by most folk. For example, the topmost portrait depicted a family at a table, devoured by a eyeless and noseless man. The one below showed a woman with a face that could only be described as “ragged”. The bottommost art piece displayed a man, covered in deep pus-filled gashes on his head. 

  
“What the fuck?” The captor exclaimed.

  
“I take it you like them?” I responded.

  
“...”

  
“The baby behind you likes them.”

  
This prompted my captor to turn around. Where he gazed upon my sculptures.

  
I don't feel safe putting my delicate sculptures unsecured in the backseat, so I place them in the very back of the car. This particular sculpture was made to resemble a baby doll. Unlike a toy baby, it had several wires emerging from its skin like reproducing porcupine parasites. I painted the sculpture to look like it was bleeding from the mass emergence.

  
He briefly screamed in shock at my creation. I love pranking people.

  
“Relax, it's just a sculpture!” I reassured.

  
“Fucking deranged psycho!”

  
“Relax, I never kill people!”

  
“Creep.”

  
“I thought you said you liked horror?”

  
“...”

  
I halted the car, causing the man to tighten his grip on the gun.

  
“We're already here.”

  
He then realized he forgot to pay attention to his surroundings during our conversation. 

  
“What the FUCK?!”

  
“You're finally home, Jake.”

  
“How the fuck do you know where i live?! And my name?!”

  
“Where *your parents and* you live.” I corrected.  
“Fucking stalker!” he shouted, before shooting me in the head. My brains and flesh instantly coated the windshield. He swiftly retrieved his duffel bag, and rushed inside his house.  


  
As I hear him unlock his door and dash inside I try to chuckle through my blasted mouth.

  
I can't wait to see Jake's face when I show up at his door unscathed. I can't wait to see his face when his parents welcome me into his house. I can't wait to see him discover me in his family portraits altered to include my face in them. I can't wait for him to realize memory, records, history, even reality, has been rewritten to include one monumental change:

  
I am Jake's brother.

  
I'm still out in my car writing this. I have already recovered from my cranial obliteration, though the windows are still covered in dried flesh. After I send this, I will enter my new family’s house. 

  
And if you see this Jake, know this:

  
Thank you for holding me hostage. I wouldn't have got to be part of your wonderful family if you didn’t.
