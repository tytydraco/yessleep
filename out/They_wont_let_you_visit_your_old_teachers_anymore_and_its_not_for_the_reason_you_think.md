When I was a kid they used to let you visit your teachers as an adult. I remember being a child and seeing these grown adults I’d never met before come into the classroom and hug the teacher and tell us all that if we were super successful we could be just like them someday and own our own RadioShack or something. It’s one of those things I never really thought about after graduating but it’s kind of cute, right? I just remembered it at Christmas recently, asked my nephew about if that kind of thing happens anymore. 

“Well no,” this kid snorts in a smarter-than-thou tone, “thats so dangerous. What, they just let random grown men wander into your class and it’s a good faith thing that they won’t shoot someone or touch someone or-“ 

I stopped him. “Yeah, man, it wasn’t like that back then. We didn’t think about that stuff. It was just cool. It was nice! It got you out of a lecture sometimes, I don’t know. I don’t like that tone by the way. Denise, get your kid a damn…how to have manners book or something. Manners for dummies.”

Denise stops looks in from the kitchen. “You’re probably the only person in history that doesn’t immediately know why that’s a stupid idea though. To still let the old students visit, I mean.”

And this conversation went on for a while, whatever, none of this matters aside from that initial recollection. It’s a recollection that wouldn’t leave my mind. Why can’t I just do that? Why can’t I just go visit my old school and see my old teachers? Like yeah, whatever, the concerns are valid but I don’t think it’s worth taking away that magic moment for the kids. I thought “you know what? Let’s do it. I’m going to go visit my old teacher and I’m going to tell the kids all about my job and I’m going to prove that it’s possible to still do it.”  So I drove up to the school. And they didn’t let me do it.

What’s the point of being 27 and middle class in a dead-end middle of nowhere town if you can’t show your teachers how fit and tall and not homeless you are? I asked the front desk clerk at the school

“so like… can I see her in the breakroom then?”

“We can call her and see if she wants to talk to you after school ends, yes.”

“But I can’t go in there right now and see the kids?”

“No…you can imagine why we have to take these kinds of precautions.”

“Nono yeah I get it. I totally get it…”

Long awkward pause before I come back in with

“And I’d never do anything like that, for the record. I wouldn’t…you know. Don’t worry about that I’m good”

“I’m going to call her now. Please sit down.”

I obey her orders and find myself sat in a tiny chair surrounded by accolades won by the school. I search for my graduating year and find nothing. Fair enough, it was a shot in the dark anyway, I didn’t pay attention to sports even then.

“Sir?” The desk clerk calls. I stand up.

“Mrs. Debbins wants to speak to you.” She holds the landline phone out for me to grab. I walk over to her and grab it. 

“Mrs D?” I excitedly answer. Mrs Debbins was always one of my favorite teachers. She was a hard ass but knew when to crack jokes too and really cared about her students, which felt rare at the time of course. I knew she’d be happy to see how not dead I was. 

“You’re being watched and so am I. Walmart dumpster. 10 pm. Be there.”

And she hung up. Hearing her voice, someone I hadn’t spoken to in ages, it filled me with joy. But what she said…I mean what do I even do with that? Genuinely? I stood confused, handing the phone back to the clerk. I looked around briefly to make sure I wasn’t on some hidden camera show. And then I got in my car and drove home.

I’ll go to the dumpster tonight and see what the hell happens lol. Maybe I’ll update you guys if it’s noteworthy enough. Hope this was interesting I guess. Weird stuff.
