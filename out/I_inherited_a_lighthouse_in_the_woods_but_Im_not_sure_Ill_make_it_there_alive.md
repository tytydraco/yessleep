[PART 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/16427gn/i_inherited_a_lighthouse_in_the_woods_and/)

The wood was a blanket of darkness. Tall trees reached to the sky, their branches stealing the narrow shafts of moonlight. I navigated with my lantern alone. In it, I burned my letters of safe passage. I hoped I’d brought enough, but even now, a half hour into the journey, I felt my bag emptying faster than expected. 

Not good.

My heart thrummed as I moved through the brush. There was a single path to Gloomfall, a narrow trail that was rarely traveled except by my family and those like us. It’d lead me to the lighthouse, to safe haven, but only if I could find it. 

“Lost?” said a voice.

I wheeled about, raising the lantern and squinting into the murky shadows. “Who’s there?”

Laughter met my ears. Playful. A shape appeared, something bipedal and canine. A dogman. I drew back, pushing my lantern forward as if to prove a point. “This grants me safe passage. You can’t harm me.”

More laughter. The dogman dropped onto all fours. It was the size of a small bear, and as it neared I saw its long teeth gleaming in the lantern glow. “You’ve safe passage so long as you carry that. It’ll run out before long.” It lifted a human-like hand to its teeth, picking at them with a black claw. “I can wait.”

Fucking hell. 

I didn’t have any silver on me, which meant even if I could fight this thing, I couldn’t kill it. I’d left before considering what I was walking into. Foolish. Stupid. Now I was paying the price. I felt my bag around my shoulder, crunching the letters in my grip. There were fewer than I thought. 

“You’re going to be waiting awhile,” I lied, trudging on. 

The dogman didn’t answer. Its padded feet moved through the brush behind me, softly passing over dead leaves as it sniffed at the air. Sniffed at me. My palms clammed up, and I readjusted my grip on the lantern. How far did I have to go?

Too far.

I still hadn’t found the damn path. 

“You’re right to be afraid,” said the dogman. 

“That so?” I glanced over my shoulder, but I couldn’t see it in the dim light. It was moving just beyond my vision. Out there, in the dark. 

“Your old man was just the beginning. Things are shifting here. Wheels are turning.”

“You’re a Nameless Haunt,” I told it. “What would you know?”

It snapped its jaws, and I stumbled in surprise, almost extinguishing my lantern as I fell. More laughter. This time, howling. “And you’re a fucking coward. Nameless Haunt or not, I’ll have your heart in my teeth by the end of the hour. Bet on it.”

I got to my feet, fishing in my bag for a fresh letter to light aflame. *Probably sooner,* I thought. *Where the hell is this path?*

Wait.

There, up ahead. A winding creek. I'd walked along it ten years ago when I first left Gloomfall. If I followed that stream, it'd lead to my family’s land, and the lighthouse that sat upon it. 

I jogged toward it. My chances of survival just went from zero to slim, and I considered that a welcome improvement. 

“She’s next, you know,” the dog man said, rising up on its hind legs. It had to be seven feet. It kept pace with me, its jaws salivating while its cold eyes buzzzed with hungry anticipation. “Without your old man, the girl’s as good as dead.”

I grit my teeth. If only I had some silver, I’d have run it through that monster’s ribs already. But I didn’t. All I had was my lantern and my wits, and my lantern was already doing all it could. “You’re well informed for a Haunt,” I muttered, doing my best to sound diplomatic. “Something as well connected as you probably knows what killed my old man, don't you?"

More laughter. Howling. It kicked up stones along the creek bed as it bounded around me, and I did my best to shield my lantern from any errant debris. If it knocked it out of my hand, even accidentally, the dogman would die. That was the law of the land. But I’d still be left without a lantern, and that meant I’d end up dead soon after.  

“Something funny?”

“I’ve just forgotten how long you’ve been gone. You never met him, did you?”

I frowned. “Met who?”

The dogman stepped in front of me, its eyes gleaming. “The Stick Man,” he snarled. “He’s on his way to Gloomfall now. He’ll be killing your sister while we speak, I expect.”

I searched his eyes, but I saw no hint of laughter behind them. No hint of  a lie.

I ran. 

My feet pounded over the stones of the dark shore. I rushed down the edge of the creek, wondering how much further until I’d make it onto our land, onto safe haven. *Too much further,* I thought hopelessly, *she’s already dead.*  

Images played in my mind, images of a shadow crouched over my sister, its long limbs playing over Harriet’s corpse. In its skull burned two cinderlight eyes. I'd seen it in my dream. In the omen. 

“No!” I shouted.

I doubled my efforts, my lungs scorched like a furnace. The dogman ran at my side, his powerful legs kicking back stones as his teeth snapped near my ear. “About time for another letter, don’t you think? That one’s almost out!”

“What?” I glanced down. The letter was still fresh–

My world span. I tumbled, slipping on a wet stone. I rolled in a shower of pebbles and came to a groaning stop, hating myself for being so gullible, so stupid. 

My hands shot out. I felt desperately for my lantern, but the moonlight was so faint beyond the twisting canopy. Too faint. 

“Looking for this?” said the dogman.

“Please!”

I heard something whistle through the air. I reached out, desperate to catch it but in the dark I couldn’t see my hands in front of me. Glass shattered. My stomach plummeted, my hands rushing to my side and feeling the warm metal of the lantern’s frame. Its broken glass. 

No. I couldn't give up. 

I could still use this. I’d just need to protect the flame with my hand. Frantic, I dug into my bag and fished out a letter, but before I could light it, a rough paw gripped my throat. It lifted me into the air. I coughed and sputtered. My legs kicked, spasmed under me as I tried to beg for my life. 

“Told you I’d have you between my teeth,” the dogman snarled. He snapped his jaws near my ear. “Question is, which end do I start with? Sometimes I like to listen to the screams for a bit…”

My mind reeled. I punched, clawed at the dogman but he was too big, too powerful and even if I had a shotgun he wouldn’t stay down without silver. 

“Puh… puhlease…” I gagged, choking in his grip. 

“Don’t beg,” the monster said. “Desperation tastes pathetic–”

It dropped me. I fell to the stones, gasping for air and I fumbled around lamely, still light-headed from the lack of oxygen. Letters. I needed to burn another letter. I reached for the bag, and as I did I heard a yelping sound. The dogman. It was crying out in pain. 

Why?

No. I couldn’t worry about that. What I needed now was safe passage. I lit a fresh letter aflame, placed it in the lantern, and breathed a sigh of relief. That’ d buy me another few minutes.

Now, where had the dogman got to?

I lifted the lantern, squinting into the murky black. 

Another yelp. Something wet, slick, to my right. The sound of something tearing into flesh. More yelps, more canine whines. I stepped forward hesitantly, approaching the sound, unsure I wanted to see what was out there. The dogman wasn’t a powerful entity. He was considered a Nameless Haunt, a wandering phantom of the wood that did the bidding of other, more terrifying creatures. Still, as Nameless Haunts went, dogmen were fierce monsters, and anything that could threaten them was a creature to be feared.  

“Hello?” I said uneasily to the dark. 

A scene unfolded in the faint lantern light. Blood. Blood coated the stones of the creek, flowing between my feet, and all of it came from the same source. The dogman. It lay in front of me, its hindlegs still kicking limply as it gasped its final breaths. I brought a hand to my mouth, stifling a gasp. In its neck was a silver machete.

I took another step forward. There was a shadow beyond the dogman, standing above it. The shadow grunted, heaving the machete from its neck in a spray of red, before resting the blade on broad shoulders. I raised my lantern. I painted the newcomer with my glow, and my heart nearly stopped beating. 

The shadow was tall. Much taller than I remember, and its hair had grown into thick black tangles. “You…” I breathed. It was all I could think to say– no words could express the hurricane of emotions, of rage, pain and hatred I felt in that moment. 

“At long last,” my brother smirked. “The prodigal son [returns."](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCryptid)
