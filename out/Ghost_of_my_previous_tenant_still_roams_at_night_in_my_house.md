This happened to me when we have moved to a new place in Kalyan, Mumbai, India. We've rented a place there and our neighbour Nisha was gone at market that evening, what she told me after she came back was really painful and horrifying.

I waited for Nisha to get back from flee market, it was almost 7 but she haven't turned up yet. I felt something strange, it was like I didn't want to know what happened to Rani but on the other hand I had this curiosity of knowing how our previous tenants lived and left...

Reyan and I went to the garden, he played with other kids, I watched him slide down from an orange colored slide. Sky was already dark and blue, some early stars were shimmering in the sky. 

"Maya!" I heard from behind, Nisha was there with one huge bag of veggies and she had Shruti in her other hand. She was walking towards me, I quickly got up to help her with bag, she had plenty of veggies the bag almost felt like 10kgs, "Reyan, let's go home, come..." I called Reyan who was now playing in sand, his clothes were dirty and his hands too. 

We sat in our living room, sorting out the vegetables, Nisha was breastfeeding her daughter, and I asked her, " Do you know about the previous family that lives here?" 

She looked puzzled at first and than she said, " Yes, did Uma aunty told you about Rani?" She asked, her smile fading. 

"Yeah but she didn't told me what happened to her! I asked her she just left me!" I said in mild frustration. 

"Rani and her family lived here before you, she was a good friend of mine but she suffered from a mental illness, she had catatonic schizophrenia, she started hallucinating that someone wants to kill her, one day when everyone of her family was at work, she burned herself alive..." Nisha said, her face turning blue, " I saw her body-" she continued," she was like coal, black and stiff, her eyes vaporized, and she died right there in that bedroom-" she pointed at Reyan's bedroom, while she was telling me this, I saw a very strange emotion on her face, suddenly she wasn't pretty Nisha but someone else, someone in Misery.

My heart missed a beat, why didn't our owner tell us about it? Someone died in the very house we are living with a son and he didn't thought it was important enough for us to know it?

I ran into my kitchen and grabbed a bottle from fridge and handed it to Nisha, she sipped some and said,"I had to go to  therapy after that, because it really took a toll on my soul... I was feeling numb and didn't feel like eating anything, I took medicine for almost 4 months and all that happened, during my pregnancy!" 

"Oh... I'm sorry, I shouldn't have asked you that... I'm so sorry -" I said. I really felt guilty of bringing all those memories back to Nisha. I didn't meant to hurt her feelings. 

I dont know what to say now, so I stayed silent, looking down at my feet, "Maya, it's fine, it's just all that visuals came as flashback to me when I told you this... But trust me this house is safe..." She said. 

I stayed silent for a while, to process what she said, I know the house is safe, " I don't believe in ghosts if that's what you are trying to say..." I said her in disbelief, she smiled at me. " Okay, that settles then, I'll leave now, will see you tomorrow!" She pulled Shruti from her breast to her shoulder and patted on her back, took her phone and keys from the table and left. 

I went to the kitchen, and washed the tomatoes, Reyan was watching TV, I made tomato saar and rice for dinner. By 9 Siddharth came, was bit cheerful then yesterday because his designs were finalized today. We had dinner together and he told me about how he designed a particular product and how he was praised by the leads. 

Later that night after doing the dishes, tucking Reyan, I pulled out my diary and started writing about today.

I got to know something about this house, it has been through a very gut wrenching tragedy, a girl named Rani killed herself due to some mental illness. I felt sad for her when Nisha told me about it. 

How can a mental illness take life? I mean I've seen people commit Suicide in depression but never heard someone commit Suicide in schizophrenia. 

How she'd have felt while burning? Whole body on fire, no one to rescue or turn down the fire, how much guts that'd require to do a person something like this to himself? I'd never do such thing, I'd do the easiest way, either drown or jump from the highest point so the pain doesn't feel.

What if her spirit still wanders here? She was mentally ill she didn't know why she was doing what she was doing, then her soul might still be wondering this house, maybe not every night but on particular no moon or on the day she died? 

How she'd have looked before burning? Was she beautiful? Was she mediocre like me? And how did she burns herself? Petrol? Who keeps petrol in house? Maybe kerosene because it's still used in old stoves. What she'd have felt while burning that matchstick? Fear? Or excitement?  

What would I feel? Holding the matchstick when I have kerosene all over my body, will my hand tremble to let it go? Will I ever let it go?  And if I let it go would I dare to still stand while burning from foot to head? I'd scream on top of my lungs, will try to get anyone's attention to free me from this agony, put me out of the misery, Id run tearing all the clothes and even the burned skin because that'd hurt so much. 

Maybe I'd die the instant I drop the matchstick, not by burning but by the shock of what I've done to myself. I couldn't do something like this to myself, no way. I have a kid to raise, a husband to love. Why would I think that?

I looked around it was already 2 in morning, the howling had already began, I got used to that howling, it doesn't scare me anymore. I closed the diary and laid down next to Siddharth, he was snoring as usual, I turned the lights off and tried to sleep. 

The silence was hurting my ears, only thing creating sound was Siddharth soring beside me, I looked at the ceiling fan and tried to sleep, I kept looking at the fan blindly, and slowly I felt like I kept the Gas on, because a burning smell of oil or empty vessel touched my nose, I got out of bed and ran to kitchen to check if I've turned the gas off. It was off. 

Maybe someone in neighbourhood burned something. I went to living room, pulled the curtains of the balcony, and went back to bed. Sleep wasn't coming my way easily, I tried till 3 but no, so I got up and went to living room and turned on the TV. Shuffled through the channels but nothing was playing, I turned it off and just lay down on sofa, trying to sleep there.  

I felt it again after some time, the burning smell, this time it felt like it was coming directly from the living room. I panicked and ran to our bedroom, took the blanket and closed my eyes, I felt like she was there... Rani.
