Hello people of Reddit this is my story of my NDE 
( my first time posting forgive me for misspelling,ect) 


Timeline : 2017-2018

I was around 18 at the time and in a GED Program inside of a high school , the bell rang and it was the end of the day . I had a few pills and a friend (At the time…) that lived a few minutes away so I called him and we linked up . We were at his house in the back patio listening to music,  rolling up some blunts  , talking shit (normal stuff) . 

We sparked the first blunt and I popped 4 pills and killed the blunt (these were strong ass pills they give to people with cancer) , I was already fried from the first blunt , we went inside and played a few games of uno for about 20-40 minutes while I was battling  keeping my eyes open head bopping going in and out while trying to play uno lol , we then went back outside to get fresh air cause I was feeling weird from all the pills I don’t know why but we sparked the second blunt and killed that shit too . Around this point I was beyond fried (uncomfortable type shit ) I felt like I could barley breath everything kept spinning , my body started light twitching uncontrollable.

I remember my friend was trying to go back inside so I wanted to go back in and get water and bread maybe to help . 
I got up from my chair and was walking to the sliding door to go inside and remember starting to feel lightheaded then I fell to the floor hitting my head on the concrete and went into a full blown seizure body shaking , foaming out my mouth (from what my friend said )  . At this point I believe I overdosed from those pills . 

All a sudden I remember just being above my body like a 360 view/ceiling fan . I was staring at my body in shock trying  to understand what’s happening at first I thought I was dreaming or just tripping balls but then I started seeming my friend push my lifeless body around trying to wake me up I heard his voice calling my name and asking if I was straight/good but couldn’t feel a thing . Everything felt so weird as if time didn’t exist where I was at . I started to float up in the sky as I was looking all around trying to process what I’m viewing his voices start to echo and then get quieter and silent . 

It started getting dark and I remember trying to scream but I couldn’t make any noise. The only thing I could do was talk with my inside conscience voice . I was in all kinds of stages mostly in denial but this was happening and I couldn’t do anything about it . I was so scared as it was getting more darker and darker it felt like my conscience inside voice was fading away as well . I remember telling myself this is really happening I’m really dying I couldn’t do anything like I wasn’t in control anymore. 

It was my last attempt I didn’t want to die I started asking god , the universe, whomever it may concern for another chance that I didn’t want to die like this that I would change my life and never do hardcore drugs again that I wanted to experience life create a family and enjoy life . Then everything went black quiet life was nothing it felt non existent .
I thought this is the end …. 

When all a suddenly I started hearing my name being called far away from my friend I gained my 360 vision again I was so high in the sky i started getting closer and closer to my body it was like I was an asteroid flying/crashing fast back into my body Boom !!! I was back in my body I jumped up from the floor and grabbed my friend and asked if I was alive he looked at me crazy and was like “bro you tweaking “ I told him I just died and explained him everything that I even heard what he was saying and doing to my body . At first he couldn’t believe it but after awhile with more details he was as shocked as I was . 


This was my story of when I had a NDE overdose . Please don’t do drugs it’s not worth it . I stopped doing drugs since this day i been clean for 5 years  (I only smoke weed ) . 
I even created a family and I’m doing much better in life now .
Ever since this day I’m still kinda scared of death is it just the end non existent forever.. 
was my words heard by god/universe/someone..
I guess I won’t know until it’s my time …
