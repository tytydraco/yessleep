I want to share my story here. I think it may be a warning for those who are gluttonous for a peek into their neighbours' windows.

Here are [screenshots of our chat](https://imgur.com/a/kDikCDO) and below is text transcript

Me - I can't get through either - 09:22 AM

\*Cleomaniac1 started a call\*

As Cleo dialled for a group call, we saw Derek finally answering. But the relief was short-lived. All we could hear were gruesome cracks and the sound of someone with a high-pitched, inhuman voice muttering chilling words.

"Tasty," the voice whispered, followed by a sickening slurp. "I won't return," the voice growled, filled with malice and hunger. "I will find you all." Cleo's screams filled the call.

As the call abruptly ended, we were left with a haunting image burned into our minds. The image of Derek, torn apart and devoured by a being so terrifying that we couldn't even comprehend its existence.

From that day on, we lived in fear, knowing that there are things in this world beyond our understanding. Things that hunger for us, that crave our flesh and our souls. And we can only hope that we never cross paths with them.
