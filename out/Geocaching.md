I never liked the woods.

Even before all this, they made me uneasy, it was the way sound doesn’t travel right out there, how everything feels alive but you can’t see what’s moving.

Jim loved it, though. He’s one of those people who can’t sit still, always chasing some new hobby. Last spring it was metal detecting, before that it was drone photography. This time it was geocaching, it was finding hidden boxes other people leave in random places and signing your name inside.

“Like treasure hunting,” he said, grinning as if that word would make me care.

But I hadn’t cared about much since Max died.

Max, our golden retriever, who’d been with us since before the wedding. One day he was fine, the next he was gone. A seizure. No warning.

After that, the house felt hollow. Every noise made me expect to hear claws on the tile or his collar jingling. Jim noticed how quiet I’d gotten and tried to help the only way he knew, by dragging me outside.

So when he said, “Let’s do a few caches this weekend,” I agreed. It wasn’t about the game. It was about him trying.

We drove out to an old trail near Lake Marvin. It was late afternoon, that soft time of day when the trees look painted in gold. Jim had a hiking bag, a shovel, and his phone open to the app. I followed behind, trying not to think about how much this path looked like the ones Max used to love.

The first cache was under a log, a plastic box with stickers and some trinkets. A toy car. A marble. Nothing special.

The second was hanging from a branch inside a metal tin, half-rusted. I signed my name because Jim asked me to.

By the third, the light was fading. The woods went from warm to shadowed so fast it made my chest tighten.

“Maybe we should head back,” I said.

“Just one more,” Jim answered. “It’s showing up nearby. Says it’s buried, probably one of those bigger ones. Maybe it’s cool!”

He sounded like a kid. I didn’t want to ruin that.

The GPS arrow blinked green when we reached a huge oak with roots that looked like twisted ropes. Jim crouched beside it, brushing away leaves.

The dirt gave way too easily. He didn’t need the shovel; his hands sank in like the ground had already been loosened.

“Someone must’ve just been here,” he said.

When he hit something, the sound wasn’t metal. It was soft.

He pulled up a canvas bundle, tied with a strip of leather, the kind of thing you’d expect to see in an old war movie.

Jim untied it. Inside was a map, hand-drawn and shaky, showing the same trail we were on but with one difference. About half a mile further in, near the edge of the lake, was a red “X.”

Next to it, faint but legible:

CABIN — DON’T FOLLOW AT NIGHT.

He laughed. “Someone’s really going for atmosphere!”

“Jim, it’s getting dark.”

“Come on, we’ve come this far.”

We followed the map. The trail narrowed, roots and branches snaring our ankles. The deeper we went, the quieter everything became....no crickets, no birds. Even our footsteps felt swallowed.

The cabin appeared like a shadow among the trees. Small. Leaning. Its roof half-collapsed, walls the color of ash. One window boarded up, another cracked open like an eye.

Jim stepped onto the porch. It moaned under his weight.

“This is amazing,” he whispered.

I stayed on the ground, flashlight trembling in my hand. “Let’s just look from outside.”

But he was already inside.

The smell hit me when I followed, it was wet wood, mold, and something sweet, like rotting fruit. The air felt heavy.

The cabin’s interior was almost empty except for a table, a broken chair, and the remains of a fireplace. On the table sat another bundle, same canvas, same leather strap.

Jim untied it before I could speak.

Inside were bones. Small, delicate. I recognized the shape immediately.

“Those are—”

“I know.” He dropped them, stumbling back. The little skull rolled across the floorboards and stopped at my boot.

Before I could move, something shifted in the corner.

At first, I thought it was a trick of the light, just the shadows moving with my flashlight. But then I saw eyes. Two of them. Low to the ground, reflecting the beam.

The thing crawled out slowly. Its skin was pale, the texture of something long soaked in water. Its limbs bent wrong, jointed too many times. But the worst part was the face.

Because it wasn’t a stranger’s face.

It was Max.

Not exactly, just wrong enough. His muzzle too long, eyes too human, teeth like they’d been filed flat.

“Jim,” I whispered. “Do you see that?”

He froze, his lips moving but no sound coming out. The creature tilted its head, mimicking the way Max used to when we called his name.

Then it spoke.

Not barking. Not growling. Just a low, wet whisper:

“Stay… stay…”

That broke something in me. I grabbed Jim’s arm and dragged him outside.

We ran. I don’t remember the path or the branches cutting my face, only that sound behind us, it was the same voice, calling, breaking, shifting tones. Sometimes it said my name. Sometimes it cried like an animal.

When we reached the car, Jim fumbled the keys. My hands were shaking so hard I nearly ripped the handle off the door. We didn’t speak until we were miles away, headlights cutting through the dark highway.

“Did you—” he started.

“I don’t want to talk about it.”

He nodded. His hands on the wheel were streaked with dirt.

When we got home, I went straight to the shower. The smell of the cabin clung to me, mildew, earth, sweetness.

As I scrubbed my hands, I noticed something under my nails.

Black soil. Damp.

I hadn’t touched the ground.

That was two nights ago.

This morning, when I went to feed the birds outside, there was something sitting on the porch. Wrapped in canvas. Tied with leather.

I haven’t opened it.

But I swear, as I brought it inside, I heard a soft sound from somewhere beneath the floorboards—

A low, familiar panting.
