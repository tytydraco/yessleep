 This was the thing that almost cost me my life.

It was January 2019, maybe around the 14th, and my team was funded with the chance of being the first people on Earth to explore the Mariana Trench.

When I first heard the offer, I jumped at the mention of getting it, before we were even picked, we had already begun to pour thousands of dollars into research, and by no one’s surprise, we were picked.

My team was spending days and nights, sitting there, testing the capabilities of miniature submarines, this was the first thing that exploded our performance.

With the increase of funds, by a couple of weeks, we had come up with the first real prototype, we tested it, and it did decently. Managing to go down around half the depth of the whole trench.

Though, we wanted to go deeper, to reach the bottom.

I wish we had just stopped there.

Finally, the time had come, and we made the first-ever submarine, that could handle the pressure and depth of the Mariana Trench.

One person, who had been fond of this project and regularly brought it up, wanted to be the first to do it. So, we all voted and brought up safety concerns, but in the end, he could go.

The next weekend, he had gone into the sea.

He was never seen again, all that remained was the submarine, which we had been able to connect with and bring it back up to shore when we couldn't get in contact with him.

The seats were soaked in blood

The family of the victim even tried to sue us, but we had shown them the documents he had signed, noting that if something happened, we would not be liable for any damage or death that occurred.

This drove me to the brink, I *needed* to know what happened down there, I constantly looked at the pod, it elevated my heartbeat, and all I could think about was the submarine. 

“*Where was he?*” I thought

When I had reached my breaking point, I got the submarine ready, no one knew what was happening, everyone tried to seal it off, and get it out of their heads. 

*Not me.*

I got inside and dove inside the Trench, I had brought a Pistol just in case, we don’t know what was down here, it could be far worse than anything else we had ever seen. 

I had gotten to the bottom, I turned on all the lights, and I drove around in the sub.

The sounds were unsettling, and terrifying,  like the roars of a lion, only longer, and higher pitched. 

After a couple of hours, I was sick of it.

*Nothing was happening.*

The ocean heard me. I heard thumping around the sub, I looked out the front window, and two, beady eyes stared back at me.

I paused and just looked. I was frozen, it was like it was holding me there, I was frightened beyond belief.

It got closer, and the light inside the shuttle showed me what it looked like, it was a long, thin body. Like humans, it also had a sharp smile, as wide as a knife. It had grey, tattered skin, and broken chains crossed around his arms. 

For a few moments, we just stared at each other, then, it disappeared. Though, it wouldn’t be gone for long, as it sounded like something was drilling, and trying to get inside the sub. I could do nothing, I had to wait, and I got out my pistol, and sat there. 

“Get out.” I heard, and I slowly started to turn all around. My eyes landed on the window, small cracks were starting to form. I quickly hurried to check the water pressure.

“What the?” This shouldn’t have been happening, we had done more tests before this, the water pressure down here couldn’t just change by itself, or did something else change it?

“Did you do this?” I yelled at the top of my lungs, and a quick knock on the pod answered.

“Did you kill the man that was inside here before?”

Two knocks followed.

“Then what did?”

A whisper filled my ears, “It.” 

“Get out.”

I looked out the window once again, the cracks were beginning to get larger, and larger, I had to go back to the surface.

It took me around 30 minutes to get back up, I wasn’t scared, just, in shock. 

If we hadn’t tried to do this, maybe that thing or *things* wouldn’t have killed that man, maybe it wouldn't have tried to kill me. After a while, some people wanted to go down there, and see what happened themselves as well. 

They didn't come back.

No matter how hard we tried, more and more people from the scientific community wanted to see the Mariana Trench, and some came back, fortunately. Though, they acted like I did, just shocked.

However, one person said they saw something other than the skinny one. Let’s call it the controller. 

They said they saw a large man, heavy built, and it had hundreds of tiny eyes, throughout the body, what seemed odd to me, is that they couldn't see down here, *how and why would they need eyes?*

They said this one was also pale, with a more blueish tint instead. There’s a forum about it somewhere, not sure though. Many odd things are still undiscovered down there, though I *can* wait till they find them out. If they can come up to the surface and are angry with us…

*I hope I didn’t wake these things up, it might be the worst mistake of my life.*

*It might be the last…*
