I wasn't going to write again so soon, but I am just so angry right now. I know if I go home now I am going to start a fight. You know your life is pretty shit when you would rather be sitting in a rundown diner writing about your childhood trauma on Reddit than at home with your husband, planning for the impending arrival of your firstborn. I'm sure Mags is out there laughing at me, even if she has no idea why.

Johnny wants me to quit my job. It’s not like it's a great job or anything— just a couple days a week teaching kids down at the school how to use finger paints— it just feels like the last thing I have that is truly mine in this marriage. I don't get the sense that this is an argument I am ever going to win, not when he keeps bringing the little one's health into it. I tried telling him that my work isn't anything to worry over and it ain’t gonna hurt the kid, but well he is Johnny so he’s always bound to be right eventually. He threatened to call my mom and everything, says my family can’t lose another Max. I’m going to have to quit. At least that should free up some more time for me to write. Hopefully, I will be able to update a bit more often. 

Fuck Mags, I hope you'll never find these. I miss you I should have gone with you, but it's far too late for those kinds of thoughts. Johnny is right I am going to be a mom soon so it's time I get my head on straight and lay those silly dreams to rest.

Losing my Mags that Halloween broke something in me and my parents knew it. Gone was their bubbly little girl and in her place was a melancholic monster made from nothing more than skin, a bit of hollow bone, and a violently descending desire for starvation. 

I grew moody, started throwing tantrums that put my rowdy toddler self to shame. In all senses of the word I was regressing, it worried my mother sick as the pounds melted off my already gaunt frame. Seeing photos of myself from that time I can honestly say that I looked awful. I was barreling towards my seventh birthday, but I barely looked older than four, my skin had a horrid gray tinge and my hair remained greasy no matter how many times my mother tried to scrub the slick film from my limp curls.

I had taken to the world with my teeth, refusing all but the most bland foods in case Mags was eating something good, I didn't want to miss those little hints of hope from her mouth. I learned later that the proper term for my condition is pica, but my father just called it “the devil’s appetite”. He was convinced some creature had taken root in me to make me crave all those horrible things, all the sand and dirt, the cotton pads and soap. Most of it wasn’t even edible, it made me feel sick to the soul all the time. 

The only bright spot for him in my long months of suffering was that I was more amenable to church than ever. The sermons were watery and contrived, spoken by lying tongues onto the wet ears and open wallets for fools like my father. I had no love in my heart for them, we would find a better church eventually, or at least a more honest one where I could distract myself from the vitreous being spoken with the pretty-eyed pastor's daughter. I only went to church in those days for the commune crackers. They were dry as all hell and tasted like drywall, which made them the perfect thing to fulfill my ever-waning desire for regular food. I would gorge myself on as many as I could sweet talk the church women into giving me. It disturbed some of them, a child so eager to devour the body of her savior. They knew my hunger was not inspired by respect for His sacrifice but by a deep-rooted craving for His flesh, or anyone's flesh.

My nightmares were constant. Visions of a creature with a thousand faces that could have been my Margret wreathed in a righteous light. To her left sat a small figure, it might have been a boy around my age but I could never quite make out his features, or maybe I didn't care to. After all, how could one boy compete with the ethereal draw of my Maggie? She sat at a table full of the most beautiful delicacies— rich blood-red suckling pig with its bubbling skin, bone white potatoes drizzled with earthy gravy, and plague green peas arranged like gems in a crystal bowl— it was everything I craved but could never have. The creature was always crying as its face shifted between features, sometimes round blue eyes pinched in at the corners and dragged across the waxy contours of her face until they turned dark and thin with long spidery lashes then back again. Her hair moved from bouncy waves writhing like a nest of snakes into short pin curls, to the limp tawny rope of a hanged man's noose. 

She was gorgeous. She was my only friend and I had abandoned her at the table.

She would put some other hands out reaching for me while others grasped at her face trying to keep it in shape— she had so very many hands in those dreams— reaching for me, asking me to join her in her feast. I tried to run to her but my body was wax soft and melted in place like gum on the sidewalk. It took me years to get a step closer and by the time I reached the table the sticky strands of the flesh I left in my wake would snap back into pulling me back into the gaping maw of the waiting dark.

I would wake up bone tired and wet with tears, with no voice to call for my parents let alone the energy to make the trek to their room on my stick-thin legs. I was starving but every worldly food tasted like ash on my tongue when I recalled the banquet in my dreams. The inedible was better. The flavors were brutal, coarse, and metallic. Mostly it corroded my tongue to eat what I did, but I got used to the rich salt of the blood that would seep from my open sores. Indulgence hurt but at least it had a taste.

The only respite I had in those many months was our shared sensations, slick sweetness that I drank up greedily. I wonder now if she may have been going through the same troubles. If she might have forced herself to indulge in the good things for the simple knowing that even if she could not taste it, I would. I never thought to ask her, but I suspect that may have been the case. I should have done better for her, overpowered my repulsion to eat the home-cooked meal in front of me every night so she could enjoy it in my stead.

My parents tried to force me to eat, punching either side of my stubborn jaw until the sliver of my mouth was wide enough to force a fork in. I regret my actions in hindsight, but back then I saw no other escape than to scratch and claw at them until their blood caked under my nails and they undid straps to that stupid wooden dining chair. I would trash and pull until the skin at my wrists and hips wore through and the chair tipped over. I can almost understand why my dad might have thought me possessed. I can only imagine how scary it was to see his once meek little girl in a fit of trashing convulsion on the dining room floor screeching about “the angel” and some girl named Margaret waiting for her at the banquet.

The worst night came at the end of summer. I had successfully deterred my parents' attempts to feed me for over a week, choosing to only indulge in bits of charcoal that my father had forgotten to take from the fireplace. My father caught me in my room gnawing on a bit of the stuff that I had hidden under my stuffed animal pile. It wasn’t the first time he had caught me eating something untoward but I could tell that something about my continuous rejection of him and my mother’s attempts that week had driven him to the edge. I could tell he was about to snap, his face was turning red and the vein went from a slow throb to a rapid, grotesque pulsing as though it was about to burst. He had tears welling in his eyes. He was going to hit me. I felt an apology lodge itself in my throat. It threw itself against my voice box, thumping over and over and over just beneath my collarbone until the dam just broke. I retched everything in my stomach: a meager couple of teaspoons of blackened sludge shot through with bits of what might have been hair.

I saw my father’s hand swing towards my face when it just stopped. An eerie calm washed over him and the rage was just gone. There was no anger in his eyes, no hatred, just a far-off indifference. It was as if my father’s soul had left his body to make its own decisions. I started screaming, sobbing trying to apologize. I promised I would try to be normal and forget all about my strange indulgences. He didn't hear any of it. He moved in absolute silence. His dull, doll-like eyes never left the piece of coal in my hands. He picked me up and carried me to the kitchen as I fought him with every ounce of my quickly draining strength, afraid of what came next. I felt every step he took as it threw my brain against my skull, slow punctuated steps that shook the foundations of the house. 

When we reached the kitchen he walked straight past the dining chair, my mother tried to reason with him but his face never changed. He laid me on the linoleum floor and panned my arms with his knees. I couldn't lash out at him, I couldn't move, I couldn't think with his weight crushing into me. 

He pinched my nose with one hand and drove the other deep into the pan of a casserole my mother had prepared scooping out an oozing fistful of the stuff. He slammed his open palm against my mouth with a force that made my jaw ache as he mashed the scalding slop against my lips. Eventually, my lungs couldn't take anymore and I was forced to open my mouth to take a gulp of air. The hot sludge was lava in my mouth seeping into the weeping sores on my tongue and filling my veins with a caustic pain. I gagged trying to take in air. I felt some of the food lodge itself in my trachea causing my whole body to seize. He wouldn't move his hand from my mouth but I needed air so with no other choice, I slammed my jaw shut with the tip of his fingers still in my mouth and swallowed.

I fucking enjoyed it too. I tell myself I didn’t have a choice but I am not sure that's true, because deep down I remember wondering what he would taste like. How his bones would feel crunching between my teeth.

My mom may not have been the greatest parent but she always had my best interest at heart. I will always be grateful that she came to believe my acting out was due to my isolation because if I know one thing to be true in this life it is that I surely would have starved myself to death if she hadn't. 

She made her proposal the day after the incident as I was working through the last couple of ounces of baby fat that stood between my ravenous hunger and auto cannibalization. We were sitting at the dining table and she was bandaging my father’s index finger. The feeling of its rubbery flesh between my teeth was still fresh in my head, and I realized that the hunger was gone. I had transcended it and come out the other side blissfully unneeding.

She told me I was to start attending a real elementary school, complete with other children, designated snack times, and group lunches. 

Being surrounded by so much life kick-started my appetite, in time I forgot all about my silly hunger strike, the restraints on my dinner chair, and the taste of my father's flesh. For the first time in my life, I had new social pioneers to explore. It was early September when I finally found her. Or more accurately, she found me. I was in Ms.Nelson's first-grade class, a better reader than most thanks to my mother's attentive lessons, and completely and utterly socially inept. I didn't have many friends, but I could more than hold my own academically and because of that, there was much talk of moving me to a higher grade level. It is important to know however that this type of move was largely frowned upon by developmental specialists as it often exacerbates social ineptitude in “gifted” students. At some point long before I was born, the teachers at my school had decided that the best way to help kids like me acclimate was not to move them right away but instead to pair us up with students from the upper classes so we would have a built-in friend if and when we did make the change. 

The teachers spent weeks building my interest in this “new friend” only to be met with my increasingly lukewarm interest. I didn't really feel I needed to meet anyone new. After all, I had made twenty-seven more friends in the first two months of school than I had in the previous six and a half years of my life. Who cared if I wasn't close with anyone in particular, they let me join their games at recess and I could always find someone to bum a snack off of at lunch. They made me make the unwelcome intruder a thank you card with little hearts and flowers. I hated her already.

I was happy. Why did anything have to change?

 I wanted so badly to prove to the teachers that I didn't need to be torn from my new sense of normalcy. I decided I would reject this girl, and be so mean that she left crying for her mommy. 

Then she walked in that hideous, collared, yellow-and-white-polkadot, daughter-of-a-preacher dress with that shit-eating grin on her face and a little bag full of pink and green taffies to share. 

She didn't look quite how I imagined. I thought she would be taller being two years older than me, a bit more unkempt with a wild mane of hair and sticky hands. In all the ways I had imagined her she was, well for lack of a better term, wild. In my head, she was everything I wasn't. Free to run through the forest barefoot and dance on a traffic street. Free to eat whatever she liked and talk to whomever pleased her. She certainly wasn’t supposed to be trapped in a stuffy life with strict parents and pressed linen undershirts. Those were my troubles, not hers.

She was none of the things I thought she would be, but despite every minute disappointment I had in being wrong I realized that she surpassed my imaginings of her in every way. She was missing one of her front teeth, and lisped a bit when she spoke, her hair was cut to a short bob that bounced around just under her chin when she shook her head. It fell in shiny light caramel, almost rosy pink waves that stayed in shape no matter how many times she tried to mess it with her hands. Her eyes were dark and round with heavy lids. She had huge black irises like a cow’s which made her look perpetually sleepy. 

Before I could even try to give her my half-assed card, she had snatched it from my hands and crushed me in a suffocating hug.

“Josie! You're my Josie!” 

And I was, I always was.

She told me later it had been the card that made her recognize me, the little hearts in the same pink gel pen I had used to write those first notes. I wanted it to be more than that. I wanted to know if she had dreamed of me the way I dreamed of her. If she had that same horrible hunger from missing me. But she didn’t, she just didn't, I guess the universe always liked Mags a bit better than me. She never had those heartbreaking nightmares, or if she did then she didn't think I needed to know. Maybe our meeting was even more monumentous to her. It was really and truly her first time seeing me. I can almost understand why she thought whatever brought us together was honest-to-god magic. I mean she only ever got the good parts, or maybe it just took longer for the rot to reach her. That Halloween was our first, and if not for what happened during our last Halloween together, I would be inclined to say it was our best.
