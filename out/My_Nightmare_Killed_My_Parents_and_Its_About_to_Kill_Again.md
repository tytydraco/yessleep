It almost got me on the fourth try—the nightmare. It got so close that it succeeded in tearing the first and second layers of skin away from my back with one powerful swipe. I managed to cross the threshold and wake up before it could kill me, but it had never gotten that close before.



Each time I escaped, I was greeted by a piece of it in the real world after I turned on the lamp. The creature always disappeared moments after the light revealed it to me, though.



First, the foot protruding from the void in the closet. It had five dark, clawed toes and was somehow. Second, the hand (just as dark and clawed with five digits) curling around the nightstand beside my bed. Third, the wet tongue poking through the bedframe behind me. That night, I thought I might not see it. When I turned the lamp on, nothing caught my eye.



*Where is it?* I thought.



Then I saw it out of my peripheral. A bright red tongue that, by my guess, must have been at least a foot long. Like the foot and hand, it disappeared right after I noticed it as if it had never existed in the first place. While I believed it wasn’t real at the time, the experience nearly gave me a heart attack. It couldn’t begin to compare to the eyes of the fourth night, though.



After waking up and shaking off the imaginary pain of having the skin ripped off my back, I shifted to my right side so I could turn on the lamp. I was tempted to cower in the darkness for all eternity, but my parents taught me to face my fears head-on, which is why I never slept with the light on. (Plus, I still thought the monster was a figment of my imagination.) I went to press the switch, but something stopped me. It was a sound—breathing, breathing that came from below me.



I looked down, and that’s when I saw them. Peeking out at me from beneath the bed, a pair of bright, yellow eyes. Luminous and unblinking, they gazed into my soul, locking me in place. My finger was mere inches from the lamp switch, but I could not press it.



*What are you doing!? Move! Just press the stupid switch!*



I yelled, no, screamed at myself to slam it down and banish my nightmare back to where it came from, but I couldn’t. All I could do was focus on the eyes and its breathing.



The eyes were terrifying enough by themselves, and the breathing wasn’t any better. It sounded like the breathing of a fat man who had just finished sprinting for a mile straight with a clogged throat. Yeah, that was it. The thing sounded like it was struggling to breathe. Though its calm, unwavering eyes begged to differ.



I don’t know how long it took me, but my finger eventually pressed the switch, flooding the room with light, and forcing the head to retreat beneath the bed. After a few minutes, I mustered the courage to check underneath it. I knew nothing would be there, and I was right. The nightmare was just that, a nightmare.



Part of me kept trying to convince myself that it was something more, but I pushed the feeling aside. I told myself that everyone gets bad dreams from time to time. Granted, I didn’t know any other fifteen-year-old kids plagued by recurring nightmares, but I was sure they existed. I didn’t believe in the paranormal, and besides, after the creature disappeared, there was no evidence to suggest it had ever existed in the first place.



I knew I could have told my parents. They made it clear that I could talk to them about anything. But they worked so hard and were always so busy. I didn’t want to burden them with something that wasn’t even real.



Still, though, I was sick of the nightmares. So I came up with a plan. I decided that if I had the same dream the next night AND saw a piece of the monster again, I’d tell them. In hindsight, I wish I had told them even one night earlier. I doubt it would have changed anything, but maybe it would have. Maybe, just maybe, if I had told them, they’d still be alive.



The next night, I drifted off to sleep, praying for my nightmare to be a thing of the past. 



My prayer went unanswered.



The nightmare started the same as always, with me standing in a corridor flanked by walls of thick, black mist extending upwards into the void. At the end of the dark, concrete path in front of me about 500 yards away, there stood a doorway of light.



What was a relatively short distance on paper felt miles away in the nightmare. On the bright side, this wasn’t one of those nightmares where my legs felt like they were moving through molasses. I could run at normal speed here. On the not-so-bright side, so could the monster, and its “normal speed” was a whole lot faster than mine. I never knew how far away it started behind me. I wasn’t allowed to turn around. Even if I could have, though, I doubt I would have been able to.



In the first nightmare, escape was easy. If I had to guess by its scream, the thing had started more than a mile behind me. It wasn’t fast enough to make up the disparity, even with me stumbling twice.



When I fell asleep the next night and realized I was in the same dream, I assumed the situation would be identical. Turns out, I was a total idiot. The creature started closer that time. I wasn’t sure how much closer, but I knew things were different based on the location of its scream. The third time, it started closer still. The fourth time followed the same pattern, leading to the whole “getting clawed in the back” thing.



Unsurprisingly, there was even less distance between us in this nightmare. Common sense dictated that I had zero chance of escaping, but fear is a powerful motivator. When I felt those claws rake into my back, I felt pain far greater than any I had experienced before. You know the pain you’d feel as a little kid after scraping your back on one of the tube dividers of a fast-food restaurant’s playplace? Imagine that times a million.



The monster and I were forced to wait for the imaginary starting pistol. After a few seconds, it fired. There was no audio or visual cue, just an internal sense that now was the time to run. So I ran. I ran like I had the other times, no faster no slower.



The route was simple. No frills—no gimmicks—no cheap tricks. Nothing between me and reality except space. In the back of my mind, I knew it was hopeless, but I had to try. 400 yards, then 300, then 200, and finally 100. The light became brighter and brighter. Somehow, the creature hadn’t caught me yet.



*Did it stumble?*



I started to think that I had a chance. In the end, it was only false hope.



Its claws pierced my back and shot through my chest. I screamed. There was a roaring fire in my body that could not be extinguished. I would have passed out from the pain, but it was a nightmare. I couldn’t have been more passed out than I already was.



The thing lifted me into the air, leaving my feet dangling above the ground. It pulled its arm back, bringing my ear to its mouth. It roared again, though it didn’t sound like it was out of rage. It sounded like something else. It wasn’t taunting or scaring me. It was… thanking me? That was the last thing I remember from the dream.



I woke up to a burning sensation in my chest. Turns out, pain from a dream can follow you to the real world, albeit to a much lesser extent. Still hurt like hell, though.



*All right. What’ll it be this time?*



I already knew what its feet, hands, tongue, and eyes looked like.



*Ooh, maybe I’ll see its chest or something. Lucky me!*



I flicked the lamp on right away. I don’t know why I was less scared that time. Maybe I was high from the pain. Well, the fear wasn’t gone for long.



I saw it at the foot of my bed, and not just a piece of it. I saw the whole thing, and it put the fear of God in me. It stood roughly seven feet tall with long, gangly arms extending just past its knees. Except for its yellow eyes, crimson tongue, and off-white fangs, its entire body was black. No, not just black. It was dark, darker than darkness itself somehow. I expected it to retreat like it had the other four times after a few seconds of being in the light. But it didn’t. It just stood there, staring at me. That is, until its wiry form made its way towards me.



Still convinced it was a figment of my imagination, I closed my eyes.



*It’s not real. It’s not real. It’s not real.*



I waited until ten or fifteen seconds passed, and I opened my eyes to see it standing in front of me. It had put a grin on its face, or as close to a grin as it could make with that misshapen mouth its tongue hung out of. It reached out, but I didn’t move. If I was going to overcome my nightmare, I couldn’t run away. I locked eyes with it as it caressed my face.



I expected to feel nothing. Instead, I felt…warmth. Its hand was warm. I could feel its palm touching me, careful to avoid scraping me with its claws. I threw myself backward into the wall.



*It’s real? It touched me? No, there’s no way. I’m hallucinating.*



That settled it, I'd tell my parents in the morning.



The creature lowered its hand. It stared at me with a look of betrayal, turned, and walked away. I thought it would slink into the shadows in the closet and leave me be until the next night. But it passed right by them. It went up to my bedroom door.



*What’s it doing?*



The monster answered my question a second later by throwing itself into the door and knocking it down. It stared down the hall, and then it thundered towards my parents’ room, rattling the picture frames along the walls despite its light build.



Time passed in slow motion.



*What’s happening? Is it real? It’s not real. It’s real. There’s no way. It touched me. It broke the door. I’m still dreaming, right? No, it’s real!*



The creature broke down my parents’ door. “Dad!” was all I had time to yell before the screams started. Mom screamed first, then Dad, then the monster.



I chased after it. It was a stupid thing to do. I should have hidden myself somewhere and called the cops. That’s what my parents would have wanted me to do. But I ran down the hall anyway. I don’t know what I thought I could do. I just had to do something.



I catapulted myself into the room and skidded to a stop. My eyes locked onto my nightmare. It was facing away from me. When it heard me enter the room, it turned back to look at me. It smiled again. Then it crouched down and slid under the bed, merging with the darkness.



Then I saw my parents. I’ve spent hours trying to write down exactly what happened so you all could understand exactly what the godforsaken creature is capable of, but I can’t bring myself to do it. I’ve tried laying it all out. Really, I have. But each time I try, their piercing screams fill my ears, and the metallic scent of their blood assaults my nose. I can never write down any of the details. I’m sorry for that. The best I can do is say that the scene made it seem like the monster hated my parents more than anything in the world.



The rest of that night/day was a blur. I would say that it didn’t feel real, but that’s not quite right. I knew it was all real, it just felt like I was watching a movie of my own life from the back of the theater.



I cried for a while, the police came (a neighbor called them), they made sure I was okay and asked me some questions, and then they took me to my best friend, Matt’s, house since I didn’t have anywhere else to go. I think the cops said some detectives would be around the next day to talk to me, and then they left.



His parents were more than willing to let me stay there, especially after the officers gave them the rundown of what happened. I had told the cops the honest truth, but I’m pretty sure they told my friend’s parents it was a robbery gone wrong rather than a bloodthirsty monster that came from my nightmares. Can’t really blame them, I guess. I wouldn’t believe me either.



For the rest of the day, I hung out with Matt. He was feeling awkward around me, but he tried not to look at me like I was a wounded animal. I appreciated that.



I eventually went to my temporary bedroom and flopped onto the bed. I was exhausted, but I still tried to stay awake until sunrise despite the hope that I was creature-free. My parents were the targets, but what if the thing stuck around and decided to go after other people? I had tried this tactic once before, and it didn’t work. Something forced me to fall asleep. This time was the same. I couldn’t stay awake past midnight.



To the surprise of literally no one, the nightmare was back. Same corridor—same invisible, inaudible starting pistol—same roar—same doorway of light. Luckily, the monster seemed to start around the same distance as it had in my very first dream, so I escaped without too much trouble.



When I woke up, I saw it—a foot with five clawed toes protruding from the closet, just like the first night. My parents weren’t enough. The thing wanted more.



My parents died because I didn’t take the threat seriously. I refused to make the same mistake again. I turned the light on, sending the creature back to its hell hole, and I got to work.



Long story short, I borrowed my friend’s backpack and a pair of his clothes (his clean laundry was still unfolded in the living room), some non-perishable food, and some money from his dad’s wallet. I left a note apologizing and promising to make it up to them if I could. I didn’t give them many details on what was going on. I just said I needed to make sure they were safe.



Then I ran away.



And here I am, writing this post behind a McDonald’s and posting it thanks to their free wifi. Last night, which was also my first night “on the run,” I slept in a long-abandoned farmhouse on the outskirts of the city. It was a rough night, especially since I saw the thing again when I escaped the nightmare, but I guess that’s just my life now.



If I can't find a way to get rid of the creature before its “due date,” I’ll probably just jump off a bridge or something. Sorry for having such a defeatist attitude, but I think that might be the best option. Even if I got as far away from civilization as possible, who’s to say that the monster wouldn’t keep running until it found someone to kill?



I can’t let something like that happen again. Maybe suicide wouldn’t solve anything. Maybe the creature would just latch onto someone else. If it does, I hope it latches onto someone who’s better equipped to deal with it.



Thanks again for reading this. It felt good to get it off my chest.
