Working in India as a cameraman is neither high-paying nor respected. It’s a freelance gig that chews you up and spits you out. You’re expected to lug heavy equipment through chaotic interviews, invisible even to the journalists who love celebrating themselves. Precision becomes muscle memory after a while.

But yesterday’s interview?  
I wish it had never happened.

It was supposed to be a major piece: a prime-time debate on the rights of sex workers, after the horrific case of Maya Kumari — a sex worker raped despite refusing her client. We were freelancing for *Trident News Network*, a name that people associated with fearless journalism. My boss, Vikram Desai, was the face of the 9 PM broadcasts. A national hero on camera.  
Off-camera? He was a different man altogether. A coward. A cruel, spineless man who treated us like pests.

We arrived at a sprawling smart bungalow, equipped with guards and housekeepers, a place far grander than we ever imagined a "sex worker" would own. As we set up the equipment, the staff treated us with unnerving hospitality — offering us food, drinks, making us comfortable. It almost felt like we were being fattened up for slaughter.  
When we asked about our interviewee, they simply said she was "preparing."

At 8:50 PM, she entered.  
Nama Sen.

It’s hard to explain the effect she had. She was *beautiful*, yes, but there was something beyond that — something ancient, something *terrible* wrapped in human skin. The way she moved, the way her eyes scanned the room... It wasn’t natural. It felt like the air grew thicker around her.

Even Vikram, arrogant old bastard, shifted uncomfortably when she sat down across from him.  
The cameras rolled at 9 PM sharp.

"Welcome to Trident News Prime Time," Vikram began, oozing fake charm. "Today, we have a special guest: Nama Sen, the face of beauty and the voice for workers in the field of pleasure."

Nama smiled — a wide, knowing smile. "Namaste," she said warmly. "Thank you for having me. I hope tonight we can shed light on what life truly means for someone like me."

Vikram wasted no time, itching to corner her. "So, tell us, what really is the life of a sex worker in India?"

Her reply was unexpected. "Fulfilling," she said, her voice musical and strangely hypnotic. "It's a world where money, fame, and power are within reach — if you learn how to survive."

Vikram frowned slightly, sensing that things weren’t going the way he’d planned. His mask slipped a little. He asked, "Would you care to elaborate what makes this… *fulfilling*?"

Nama leaned forward.  
"For twenty years, I've built an empire. Satisfied one client, then another. Word of mouth is everything — in my world and yours."

Around me, my crew exchanged glances. The live chat on YouTube exploded with emojis and comments, ranging from admiration to outrage.

Vikram pressed on, his voice tinged with venom. "You seem proud. Would you say your experiences have shaped your character... and your involvement in fighting for Maya Kumari?"

And that’s when the real story began.

Nama’s face darkened slightly, but her smile stayed. "My past…" she said, "makes me nostalgic."

She told us about her mother — a housemaid in Kolkata, abused by her employer, raped under the guise of gratitude for a roof over her head. A man who posed as a struggling journalist.

Nama was the result of that abuse.  
And the cycle continued.

By the time Nama was eight years old, her father began visiting her room at night.  
Multiple times a day.

Her mother, broken and sick, didn’t live past thirty-five. Nama’s father, meanwhile, grew into an influential journalist — exposing corruption and gaining fame. When he remarried, he threw Nama into the streets to cover his sins.

She survived. She thrived. She built an empire.

"And sometimes," she said, her eyes gleaming, "I wonder if he ever got what he deserved. If his new family ever knew what a monster he was."

As Nama spoke, I noticed something else: Vikram was sweating. Not the casual nervousness of an interview going sideways — *but real fear*. His hands trembled slightly. His foot tapped under the table.  
He knew something.

"Very well," Vikram said, forcing a smile. "One last question: Don’t you regret the childhood you lost?"

Nama chuckled.  
A hollow, chilling sound.

She leaned in close to the mic, looking Vikram dead in the eyes.

"No, *Dad*. How could I regret it? After all, you made me strong. You made me a queen."

The silence that fell over the room was absolute.

Vikram’s face turned ashen. His mouth opened and closed like a fish gasping for air. For a few seconds, he just sat there, utterly exposed in front of a live national audience.  
And then he abruptly ended the broadcast.

We packed up in silence. Nobody spoke. Not even the helpers, who now watched us with strange, almost mocking smiles.

Vikram refused to make eye contact. He stumbled out of the bungalow, pale and broken.

The next morning, the news broke.

**Vikram Desai was found dead in his apartment.**  
Cause of death: Suicide, they said.  
He had hung himself from the ceiling fan in his study, in a room filled with awards for "Fearless Journalism."

His family — wife, daughters — had been asleep in the other rooms.

But here's the thing that chills me even now:  
In the footage we reviewed later, as Vikram sweated and stuttered, there was a shadow behind him.  
Not cast by any light or person in the room.  
It moved with a life of its own, closer and closer to him as Nama spoke.

I sometimes wonder if it was guilt that killed him.  
Or something... else.

We still have that footage.  
I wish we didn't.
