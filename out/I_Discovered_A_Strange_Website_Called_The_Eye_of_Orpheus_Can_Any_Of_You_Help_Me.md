Hey! I've got something bizarre to share with you guys. Recently, I stumbled upon an intriguing site called "The Eye of Orpheus." I'm curious to know if anyone here has heard of it or had any experiences with it and could help me with some issues.

It all started a few nights ago when I found myself lost in one of those random internet searches. It must have been around 1:30 in the morning. Amidst links and strange pages, I came across this peculiar site. The homepage was minimalist, with only a title in majestic letters, "The Eye of Orpheus," and a search bar. The letter "O" in "Orpheus" had a pupil drawn in the center.

Next to the search bar, there was an option to "search" and something similar to Google's "I'm feeling lucky" button, but in this case, the displayed title on the button was "our favorites." I decided to click, hoping for some doodles or something. To my surprise, the page returned several live streams, each labeled with strange names like "*Dream Cycle #37*" or "*The Silence of Morpheus.*"

Intrigued, I clicked on one and was directed to a live stream of a dark room. There was no sound, but the image quality was incredible. It was a room with dark walls, some furniture like a wardrobe, a desk... In the center of the screen, a person was sleeping soundly. The angle was perfect, showing details of the surroundings and the individual's face. It was a woman, around 25 years old, blonde hair covering half her face. Her duvet rose and fell as she breathed.

I was even more surprised when I noticed that, next to the video, there was a comment section. Viewers were discussing details about the person's sleep, as if they were "evaluating a performance." It began like this:

**Dreamer22**: Hey, guys! Anyone else enjoying Dream Cycle #37? This stream is awesome, man!

**NightObserver99**: Dreamer22, you always find these interesting dreamers. I'm also keeping an eye on Morpheus's Silence. He's having an intense nightmare tonight!

**Dreamer22**: Haha, you guys and your intense nightmares! Dream Cycle #37 is in a beautiful garden. Seriously, it makes you want to step into the screen!

**RumbleEd2045**: Dreamer22, NightObserver99, do you really think these dreamers have any control over what happens? Don't you realize they are just puppets in a sinister play?

**NightObserver99**: What are you saying, RumbleEd2045? This is just for fun, man. Relax!

**RumbleEd2045**: Don't fool yourselves, my friends. Morpheus's Silence is approaching something dark. Darkness isn't just an absence of light; it's an entity that feeds on dreams.

**Dreamer22**: Hey, RumbleEd2045, this is getting kind of bizarre. We're here just to watch and have fun, not to hear your crazy theories.

**RumbleEd2045**: Dreamer22, you still haven't realized? We are all being watched by something beyond dreams. Darkness isn't just an absence of light; it's an entity that feeds on dreams.

**NightObserver99**: Man, this is getting boring. Let's keep the conversation light.

**RumbleEd2045**: You don't understand. You are blind to what's happening. Dreamers are not alone. They are being used as portals to something beyond.

**Dreamer22**: This is madness, Ed! I'm done with this conversation. This isn't cool.

**RumbleEd2045**: Giving up won't save you, Dreamer22. Darkness has noticed you. Be prepared for something beyond your darkest dreams. The Eye of Orpheus is just the beginning. The end is near.

*Dreamer22 left the conversation.*

I couldn't understand; maybe I caught the topic halfway through. The connection of the stream fluctuated, some static on the screen and interference before displaying "Stream Ended." I thought I was going crazy, but I could swear that for a moment I saw something in the mirror on one of the walls, which was right in front of the "Camera," a lightning struck just before the video ended, and the reflection seemed something...something...I don't know, strange, it had no camera, it was an eye, staring from inside a wardrobe, I assumed, I couldn't see the face, but it was thin, very thin and bony, deep dark circles under its eyes.

After 5 seconds, autoplay took me to the next video, a stream titled *"Somniferous Resolution #46.*" This time a child was sleeping, in a crib-shaped bed, decorated room, hugging a teddy bear.

The comments continued to unfold, but now I was completely intrigued. I ignored the disturbing previous conversation and focused on the new stream. The camera was positioned to show the child's entire room. Some lights entered through the curtain cracks.

I could understand that some streamers record themselves sleeping; you can find that even on Twitch. But children? This was really strange, and unfortunately, I could already imagine the kind of people that would attract...I looked at the comments.

**WhisperingShadows77 \[host\]**: Hello, viewers of "Somniferous Resolution #46." This child is about to reveal something beyond your sweetest dreams. Get ready.

Other participants joined the conversation, expressing excitement or skepticism. I, on the other hand, kept observing. The child slept peacefully, but my attention was drawn to something more subtle. At the "edges" of the footage, even if just a few small pixels, showed a wrinkled, irregular surface, and if you paid close attention, you could hear oscillating breathing in the background.

**WhisperingShadows77 \[host\]**: As they say, "the devil is in the details" hehe.

The connection started to fluctuate again, but before the stream ended, the boy started getting restless, his eyes opened, and he looked straight at the screen. His eyes widened, and he began to scream. Those subtle "edges" projected forward, revealing arms, advancing from where they were, and then the image disappeared.

Sound began to return, and a chilling whisper echoed through the stream. It was a soft laugh but loaded with a sinister presence.

**WhisperingShadows77 \[host\]:** I think we had some technical difficulties. See you tomorrow.

Shaken by the disturbing experiences on the site, I decided to close the browser and try to forget it all. After all, it was just the internet, right? I got into bed, turned off the lights, and closed my eyes, trying to erase the images and sounds I had witnessed.

Sleep was troubled; I tossed, turned, had some dreams that left me uncomfortable, with something chasing me, as if I were the boy in the stream. I woke up with the pillow soaked. Morning came with weak sunlight that barely illuminated my room.

The feeling that it was all just a virtual nightmare began to calm me. However, as I was about to leave the bed, I noticed something strange. The closet door was slightly ajar, and something seemed to be inside. A wave of shivers ran down my spine, and my heart started beating faster. Cautiously, I approached the closet, going through the corner, so that "thing" wouldn't see me. I opened it suddenly, ready to hit or run, but what I found was a blouse hanging on the hanger, its folds combined with poor lighting had taken me off guard, and I convinced myself it was just my imagination. However, as I got ready to leave, I noticed something even more unsettling. On the mirror, written with a dark and viscous substance, was a message: "Dream Cycle #57"...

Fear returned with full force; perhaps my paranoia was not unfounded. While panicking, trying to check every room, I turned on my computer, and what I saw was a small notification, a message in my DM:

**WhisperingShadows77**: Hello, intruder. It seems you also like to observe others. Welcome to Dream Cycle #57, your exclusive and personal stream. Don't close your eyes.

I locked all the doors after making sure there was no one else here. I changed all my internet passwords and am formatting my computer. I really would like to know if any of you have ever been in contact with this site before or something like it, and if you can help me, I am scared, and I just saw a small dialogue, just two messages in the public chat of the Eye of Orpheus, but that took my sleep and soul out of my body:

**SangueNaLua:** Hello, folks, Dream Cycle #57 is open, looking forward to another night with our restless boy.

**WhisperingShadows77**: Glad you enjoyed it, I'm keeping an eye on him now, and I can't stop having new ideas...
