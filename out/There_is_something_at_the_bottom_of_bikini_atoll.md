On July 3, 1946, Harry S Truman gave the green light for operation crossroads, a nuclear weapons test conducted at Bikini Atoll to supposedly investigate the effects of nuclear weapons on warships. Two experiments were set up, Able and Baker. Able used a fat-manesque nuke called Gilda, named after some old 50’s movie. 

The bomb didn’t do much damage to the warships, sure most of them were contaminated with nuclear debris but nothing noticeable happened on the surface. However, the ocean floor sustained heavy devastation. Displacing several metric tons of sand and dirt creating a rather large crater. The second bomb in the Baker test was similar and was known as Helen of bikini.

 It further deepened Bikini Atoll into the nuclear wasteland we know today by extending the nuclear waste into the oceans. It also deepened the crater made by the previous bomb. From that dug out an unfathomable horror peaked it’s eerie head into our world. Laying the foundations for Armageddon.

However, the end will not come from a Lovecraftian sea monster, or a forgotten race of sentient fish people, or even a beacon that leads a gigantic fleet of aliens to our solar system. Something so intrinsic to human endeavor as the apocalypse shall not be affiliated with anything so cliché, so obvious and simple, something so human. The cause of our eventual downfall will be a little TV show called SpongeBob SquarePants.

It all started when I got a message, I was working at Nickelodeon studios, the one in Burbank, as a janitor. The year was 1995, when the studio was making classics like Ren and Stimpy and Rocko’s modern life, three years before the end. I was down on my luck with money. Recently fired and with bills stacking up I went to the newspapers for an answer. Low and behold I got a job cleaning after the guys who made childhoods.

Entering the building for the first time was complete sensory overload. Walls were plastered with orange splats, cut outs of cartoon characters were at every corner, and the furniture, man the furniture was stripped right out of a Dr. Seuss book. Big winding arches of blue plastic and zigzags that held tables. A real maximalist style that present day companies severely lacked. The place also radiated some sense of child like wonder. It felt like I was walking around a toddler coloring book if the toddler was good at drawing. It was a nice place to work in, which is what I’m saying. Then after about a month and a half, Almighty Neptune came.

A moss-filled Colosseum stood before me, and in it lay a throne covered in barnacles. The man sat on this throne was seemingly made of pure white marble. The little light that reached this ethereal palace gave this figure a harsh shadow that roughly outlined the geometry of his face. It made him look angry. Maybe he was looking back on it. I was intruding on his territory. A mere mortal showing himself to a god.

I stood there for seconds scanning the area around me like a foreigner in the slums of a country. My adrenaline shot up and I screamed but what came out wasn’t a high-pitched call of distress. What came out was bubbles. I was underwater. Somehow, I was underwater for what seemed to be a couple of minutes, yet I did not drown. Flailing my arms up and down I found that there was no heavy resistance in movement the way you would usually move in water. 

Looking around, experimenting with movement, hearing any possible signs of life other than that statue. I knew it was watching me, I knew it was angry, I knew a whole lot of things in that situation, the most prominent one was that I was screwed beyond everything we knew about anything. I tried my best to evade any image of this towering monstrosity that watched my every move. My life came to me in pieces. Disjointed but connected in a way. I was going to die here.

He was gone, taking the little light that was here with him. The moment I looked away from this thing it just vanishes away like it never existed. Then music. A sort of ambience that only fine dining places have. An orchestra playing a composition from the eighteen hundreds. There was the sharp noise of violins, The booming and tip taps of drums. What really caught my attention was the overpowering tooting sound. The main instrument that was leading the melody of the entire composition. A trumpet or a saxophone, some brass instrument. It pierced through my ears leading me to something behind the throne.

A massive pit was the source of the music. Cartoonishly large, jagged shapes that lost it’s clear definition the deeper you investigate the hole.

 I don’t know why I jumped in. Everything was so loose and wavy like I was back in 1987, doing L.S.D. in a Macdonald’s drive through.

The fall didn’t feel like a fall. It felt like I jumped over a porch step. The next thing I know I was greeted with large grey cylinders, the size of skyscrapers. There wasn’t any definition in this tube-shaped building, no windows or doors of any kind. A smooth surface all throughout.

The music was louder now but it was still far away from me. The large cylinders that laid around me were echoing this sound making it seem as though it came from every direction. I was lost in a cacophony of confusion. What would happen to me in this void beneath the sea. What would happen to me? My answer came in the form of a squirrel. Hurrying in its scurry movements, it stopped its journey and faced it’s eyes towards mine. A galaxy was in those eyes. 

Then it continued to move. I followed suit moving quickly to match the squirrels speed. Left and right in a broken zigzag pattern. The path was anything but straight forward. We were running in circles but there wasn’t a definite way to confirm that, there wasn’t anyway to mark our previous location because every cylinder looked Identical to one another.

I glanced back and I saw fish. They were as large as elephants, and they were charging towards me. We were being chased. I picked up the pace a lot more to the point where I was almost behind my furry friend. A few lefts and a handful of rights later we were out of the field of metal tubes. Then it stopped. Looking back, I saw the fish hiding behind their metallic abode, peaking their bulging eyes at us, staring.

The music was close now. Every step made it louder and louder. The squirrel was on my shoulders; the only sense of comfort I had in this winding world I found myself in.

Just a couple of steps to go and I’ll reach the song that plagued me so. A small hill was left on our list of obstacles and each inch I climbed was a small victory for me. It was a rough couple of steps. When the floor is made of coarse sand your feet start to sink a little but, in this case, it was more than a little. It almost swallowed my whole leg. Soon enough my entire body was engulfed in sand. First my leg, then my torso, and finally my neck. My body felt every tingle of this, sending signals to my brain to stop, but I can’t. The music was so beautiful. It grew louder than it ever did. It was coming from the ground now.

A banquet. I was seated at the farthest golden, jewel-crested chair on a dark mahogany table to the left. There were about thirty to forty seats total. Some were occupied by a race of gelatinous, translucent figures with exposed brains and floating eyeballs wearing silvery cloaks. Some were hard looking, the way a crab looks when it’s been boiled for a couple of hours, with fangs coming out of their eye holes and tongues growing out from their eyebrows. Then a gorilla. He looked quite dapper with his velvet coat and top hat. Along with his diamond monocle.

A projection manifested itself to my right side. The ones that theaters use for old timey movies, I was glued to the screen so to speak. A series of photos were shown every five seconds or so. They had pictures of me. Way back when I was a kid. Still none the wiser of all the grotesque things in this world. A picture of me at the water park, a picture of me graduating high school, a picture of me and my father. Then there were pictures of someone else’s life. 

As the pictures went on the colors of each of them became less saturated with color. Each one duller than the other until there wasn’t any color in the pictures. They had the same subject, people in normal situations. Then they had pictures of soldiers, generals, and government officials all around an oval table, all of them pointing at me. Pictures of people with hazmat suits entering what looks like grey water. Submarine telescopes were around them waiting for the men to descend to their deaths.

That picture lingered longer than most of them. Every detail popped out of the screen. So much so that I could almost hear the ocean’s waves crashing along the shores. By then I was no longer entranced with this little picture show. I glanced around me, and every figure on this table was just staring at the projections. Everyone except the gorilla. The sheer amount of swagger and potency of his properness was enough for me to infer the fact that he was the host of this event. A meeting between multi-universal beings. He tipped his hat to me, raising his eyebrow and holding a V-shaped grin.

“Well, well, well. I’ve been expecting you Mr. You surely are one illusive man to follow.”

He spoke, though he didn’t open his mouth, he spoke like a radio show host. He didn’t even walk like a gorilla. He was walking upright with no hint of any sort of stumbling. As if he was merely a man in a gorilla costume. I tried to speak but only bubbles escaped my mouth.

“I’m sorry for the indignity of your arrival. The chauffeur didn’t arrive on time, so I had to make a little request to the boss. You may ask me any questions of the nature of your visit.”

Tapping my fingers on the table in a fit of nervousness. I was sitting with my legs apart and my head down in contemplation. I didn’t even think about all the weird things that happened today. I was working my shift mopping up floors and cleaning toilets and next I was talking to a gorilla in a clean velvet coat. There wasn’t any connection to any of the occurrences that happened today. It was all just a string of weird random things on top of weird random things.

 I really didn’t have any choice but to follow any semblance of normalcy in this place and that lead me here. Retracing my steps from this day was a task that involved a mountain of focus, but I pulled through. I wasn’t going to follow along with anything anymore. I got out of bed and rubbed my eyes, then I took a shower and commuted to work. 

An old man with a raggedy beard and a hook for a hand sat next to me on the bus. He asked me where the sea was. I ignored him. I arrived on the job at about nine to nine thirty A.M., and I went to the break room to grab myself a cup of coffee. I worked until my shift was over and took the bus. I sat on my couch for a while and then I drifted to sleep-

“No Sir. This is no dream. This place is just as real as any place you’ve ever been in. With its charms and less favorable parts. This is no hell either nor a twisted rendition of heaven or any depiction of the afterlife. You are very much alive. The reason for your visit is beyond your comprehension and frankly is far beyond ours. It simply just happened I suppose.”

“Look at the screen sir. You’ll understand everything once you’ve seen this image. Every moment has led up to this point.”

Upon looking I saw a soft looking blob in the middle of a large crater. The blob had a bunch of holes plastered on every surface of it. My eyes were stuck. Tears came out.

“You see Mr. you are so very lucky. You’ll witness the exact moment where your species will evolve into something newer, more efficient and whole. No need to breathe or eat or drink, or sleep, no need for any meaning whatsoever. You will exist and that will be enough for you. Your physical, mental, and psychological limitations will be a small piece of the past. Every member of your race will undergo these changes and soon you will no longer consider yourselves human.”

Dead is what he meant. We would all die.

“No, No, No sir. Dying is a small part of the process. A mere nexus to a greater plan, and it will all be voluntary. All we did was show you a speck of what’s going to come. You will see us very soon.”

My gaze was broken from the image, and I could finally look around. Every where I looked was a metallic man. They all had the same design. A thick brown suit with a copper helmet with a dark black glass panel for a face. The only light in the room came from the projection so only a handful were shown to me, but I could tell that there were more.

“Very, very soon.”

The projector stopped. Black covered my eyes.

I was sitting on my lazy boy. My very expensive and very wet lazy boy. I was just as wet if not even more.

A dead squirrel wearing a velvet suit was lying on my hand. I chucked it out the window upon noticing the creature.

Everywhere I looked there was something strange. A pirate here and there with the same question, where is the ocean. A bulging eye appeared every time I glanced at a corner. I came to work, and I saw a brightly colored sponge wearing a boxy white shirt, brown shorts, and a red tie. Incredibly comical. I went to every library I could dig up any strand of information that could lead me to any form of answer. I got what I was asking for. 

Bikini Atoll was the genesis of it all. The bombs made something come out and it has quietly influenced our history. Increasing political tension and multiplying hate and scorn for us to destroy ourselves with the same weapons that disturbed it’s slumber. I believe SpongeBob is the latest of its efforts. Infecting the youth with this virus.

Now I’ve quit my job. I’ve been living as a homeless man for a while now, typing this on a stolen phone. I still have those weird things happening around me. I probably had a weird aneurysm of some sort; it probably wasn’t real. If it was It will continue. I don’t know how long but it will continue until every single one of us has been swallowed by the water.

If anyone is around Burbank please give booze to any homeless guy you see. One of them might me.
