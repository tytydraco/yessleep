My limbs were stiff when I finally crawled out of my haven. I won’t describe what was left of Lucas, only that it was very little and very spread out. As much as I tried to avoid it, I had to step through puddles of blood to get out of my hiding spot. It soaked deep into the soles of my shoes. I moved as quickly as I felt safe to the front of the store, avoiding broken glass that had spread as far as the back hall. I saw my GM first, Finn, bent over the make-line. Blood dripped down between the grates that we slid the pizzas across. The one he had been working on was crushed under his breathless chest. I didn’t know Finn well, and I looked away quickly. I wasn’t sure if I should be looking. I didn’t want to. There wasn’t anywhere to hide in the front of the store, and my hope that Bels survived shrank even further. Then I saw her brown braid peeking out from the front side of the oven, strewn across the floor, and my heart fell. I balanced on the delivery counter as I stumbled around the corner. I had no prayers. I've never been religious. But I still clung to some desperate hope.

The corpse lay with one arm tucked under the torso and crusted pizza sauce dripping down its cheek onto the unforgiving tile floor. A metal pizza pan had fallen onto it from the oven, and it dipped like a spoon into the blood collecting in the gaping hole of the corpse’s chest. A couple of pizzas had collected on and around it with nobody to box them. Bel’s always did that. My eyes scanned the body. I didn’t cry like I thought I would, not at that moment at least. It didn’t feel real enough to cry. But as my eyes scanned over ~~it~~ her, I noticed a smear of red covering the cheek with a wet and rough texture. The monster had licked it, and I didn’t even know if it was pizza sauce or Bel’s blood. I watched as a cricket crawled over her face. It slipped into the gaping chest, struggled a little, then drowned in the red bath. Something started rising in my throat. I threw up in the trash can as quietly as I could and then slid down onto the ground, wishing silently that I had died alongside my coworkers.

After sitting for a while with my back against the wall, I stood up and forced to return to the corpse. I reached down and swept Bel’s hair away from her face. Her pink earbud was still hanging onto her, shuffling songs by Ashnikko. With shaky hands, I took it and tucked it into my pocket. I collected a token each time I lost a friend over the next six months. Bel’s was the first of many. I pushed down the relentless feeling that we were nothing but shiny black crickets running from one end of a dirty tile floor to avoid death only to meet some other brutal end.

I only remember a bit of the Shakespeare I learned in college, but some famous lines from *Macbeth* have always stuck with me.

“Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,

Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,

To the last syllable of recorded time;

And all our yesterdays have lighted fools

The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!

Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player,

That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,

And then is heard no more. It is a tale

Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,

Signifying nothing.”

And my friends really did die for nothing, as I would eventually learn.
