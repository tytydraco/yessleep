It was mid-August, but the early morning and thick overcast provided a prominent chill this Thursday.  Dave Compensated with a long-sleeved shirt, sweater, and windbreaker combo; his wife would not let him leave the house with anything less. The semi-hot coffee in his Styrofoam cup slowly steamed into the crisp morning air as he leaned against his Ford pick-up waiting for the busy line of crabbers to launch their boats.  He peered into the coffee he had picked up from the local convenience store, “Delilah’s” just 10 minutes earlier. Although the store advertised the brewed coffee as “Best coffee in town! Freshly Brewed!” the coffee seemed to have a burnt taste, indicating it had been sitting out on the burner for at least a few hours. Nothing cream and sugar couldn’t fix, even though he preferred it black. Nevertheless, he savored the taste as he pulled another sip from the thick Styrofoam cup.  Dave felt a thin layer of coffee cling to his mustache as he drew the cup away, one of the few issues that came with such a fashion choice, but having a mustache, or “stache” as his son’s referred to it, really suited his aging face. 

He looked into the crooked side view mirror to help guide his windbreaker sleeve and rub off any excess coffee. As he wiped the remnants of coffee away, Dave admired the remaining spackle of black hair not only in his now fully grey head but also in his mustache. *Christ*, he was not only feeling old but also looking the part.  It was at least better than his friend and neighbor Bill Hatchers who lived across the street from him.  Bill was around the same age as Dave but had lost what was left of his hair about 8 years ago. *Ain’t that a bitch*, Dave had thought at the time.  

A squeal of old brakes pulled his attention up from the mirror. A truck and trailer was pulling out from the launch and Dave was now next in line to go. He popped the Styrofoam cup’s plastic lid back on and pulled himself inside the truck onto an old patchy bench seat. The launch of the boat had not gone as smoothly as he would have hoped, but isn’t that what everyone thought when pulling such a maneuver?  The awkward sharp curve in the boat launch approach did not provide any favors either when pulling around to back in, but Dave managed to pull it off as he had done many times before.  After successfully launching his boat, he parked the pickup in one of the many elongated parking spots nearby in the adjacent gravel lot - if you can call spray paint on loose gravel a “parking spot”. He didn’t bother locking his old pick-up next to other empty trucks in the lot, as neither did anyone else that morning and started his way down to the dock. 

The thick rubber brown boots he was wearing crunched on the gravel as he walked toward the dock, and then moved to a soft thud as he transitioned onto the dock’s surface where the boat was tied onto one of the many silver cleats. Dave bought the 18-foot aluminum boat from a friend of a friend down in Seattle about 10 years ago.  On his way back from the purchase he had also bought the Yamaha outboard engine, from somewhere more local, when he got back into town the following day. The boat itself had a single bench seat closer to the bow and a single swivel chair sticking out near the stern closest to the motor, for easier steering.  This left a decent amount of room in the middle of the boat for gear, a cooler - and in the case of this morning - crab pots.  Although the boat had no name painted on the side of the aluminum shell, Dave had referred to his tiny vessel as “Radar”, after his childhood German Shepard that accompanied him as a boy. Dave liked this name not only due to it being his late dog’s name but also thought the name suited the boat great for occasions such as this one.  The name itself gave good luck when looking for *just* the right spot to drop crab pots. 

He swung his leg over the side of the boat, being careful not to clip his boot on the crab pots stacked neatly between the bench seat and the swivel chair. He wouldn’t dare be seen falling into the boat or even worse, out of the boat, in front of the audience that was amassed at the top of the boat launch waiting their turn this morning. Dave swung his other leg into the safety of the boat and settled onto the cracked leather chair, placing his coffee in a crudely made cup holder attached to the rim of the boat. He then turned to pull back on the old, frayed rip cord on the face of the Yamaha engine.  With the first few attempts, the old engine sputtered, came to life, then died. The outboard motor could definitely use replacing. *Next year*, Dave Thought. Although he had been saying that now for the past two. 

The squawk of seagulls was starting to become louder and more evident as the morning started to warm even with the gloomy overcast. He yanked again on the rip cord, and this time the engine sprang to life, drowning out the above seagulls. Looking up, Dave threw up a wave to the old man patiently waiting to back in. With little effort, Dave swung the boat outward facing toward open ocean, then slowly drifted Radar out of the launch area. 

Brimmer Bay, or “Brim” as locals in the area call it, is one of the last places in Washington to open for Dungeness; and due to this, Dave never wasted a season.  This was his 33rd year as an active participant in the recreational crabbing season and he always made time for opening day, even in choppy conditions like this.  As he slowly moved out of the vicinity of the boat launch, the wind slightly picked up, as he pulled away from shore. Along with the wind, tiny swells and white caps were slapping the boat and kicking up sea spray which stung his already cold red face. 10 minutes later, farther out now, the waves seemed to die down a bit, giving Dave the go-ahead to throttle the 50-horsepower engine for some speed. The 50-horsepower engine was not necessarily “overkill” for a boat this size, but it definitely had some get-up-and-go when met with the right conditions. 


After 30 minutes or so, Dave’s field of view started to fill with a collection of red, white, orange, and yellow buoys which floated lamely along the top of the dark murky water, marking the first of the crab pots that early morning risers had set out before he had arrived. He began to throttle down as the cluster of buoys began to thin. The speed of the boat slowed as he passed the final remaining markers. 
Red, yellow, red again, and then nothing.  
He continued on for another five minutes until he could barely see the last red buoy he had passed.  “What do you think, Radar?” Dave asked aloud addressing the boat as if it were his childhood dog. But Dave knew - this was **the** spot. 

He killed the sputtering engine, and almost complete silence replaced the noise in his eardrums outside of the faint sound of seagulls in the distance and the small waves against the aluminum hull. This quiet could only be found when one was far enough from civilization. Dave relished it immensely; he even made the point of leaving his cell phone in the cab of his truck as to not distract him while he was out that morning. Dave took a swig of the now lukewarm coffee and placed it back into the crude cupholder.  He did not know, but that was the last he would be sipping the coffee this morning as what lay in a bucket in front of him would kill his appetite. He pulled over a sealed orange five-gallon bucket that read “Home Depot” and broke open the seal of the lid. The smell from what was piled in the bucket almost knocked him back.  
The refrigeration from the past two days should have dampened some of the smell, but the salmon carcasses smelled as if they were never frozen at all, and in fact, were in the later stages of rot. 
Now that Dave thought about it, had he even plugged the garage freezer in?  It had sat mostly empty this summer as he had otherwise no use for it.  He had unplugged it in July in an effort to be more “green” but in reality was just an effort to save some pennies on the power bill he probably wouldn’t have missed anyway. Cursing his past self, he began to flex his hands into his Gore-Tex gloves. 

As he reached into the now open bucket to start filling the bait box of the first pot of the day, something caught his eye off to the starboard side of the boat (or in other words, his right) about 10 feet away. A thin stream of small bubbles was streaming up through the ocean depths and breaking on the surface of the water. This was not unusual to see out in the bay like this, as it can happen from a lot of different factors, but what was peculiar about this was that it was not a continuous stream in one spot, but a few different streams coming up in different lengths sporadically in an area about three feet wide. Dave allowed himself a 10- or 15-second gaze at the phenomenon before he started back on his work. As he again started cramming the bait box with the remnants of what used to be salmon, he began to hear what sounded like a small dribble coming from the same direction as the bubbles. The sound reminded him of a faucet that was ever so slightly turned on leaking into a sink or bathtub, a steady dribble. He stared up again from the bait box. 

What was there now was more than a few thin lines of bubbles. It had now graduated into a growing number of bubbles coming up in a larger area, these slightly bigger than what he had seen before. 

“What in the world...” he muttered standing up from the bucket. Dave was not what you would call a tall man, but the new vantage point and angle allowed him to see better through the reflection of grey clouds on the dark ocean water. Standing up he had noticed now that the area in which he saw the bubbles was occurring in a much larger radius than he initially had thought.  The area had to have been at least 8 feet in diameter and growing. Not only that, but was the slow dribbling noise getting *louder*? Dave craned his neck without moving his feet to not rock the boat and lose his balance. Behind him, a newly discovered crop of bubbles was quickly forming just a few feet away from the other side of the boat. The look on Dave’s face had now changed from curiosity to dumbfounded, not yet scared but damn well nervous. With that, it only took Dave a second or two to decide that maybe this was not **the** spot after all.  

He sat back down on the cracked leather swivel chair, removed the Gore-Tex gloves from his hands, and felt back for the rip cord, unable to take his eyes off the collection of bubbles slowly growing around him. The area of disruption was starting to overlap where his boat stayed floating on the water. As the bubbles hit the bottom of the hull of the aluminum boat, the sound that was a slow dribble was beginning to grow so loud that it was all he could hear, the faint squawk of the seagulls and small waves he could no longer hear. His hand found the rip cord and tugged on it meekly to find tension in the line. Dave then took his eyes away from the unveiling scene around him, looked back at the engine, placed his other hand atop it to use as balance, and then yanked back. The engine came to life with a small sputter, which he could not hear, but felt with his hand on the engine, and due to the small line of cooling water jetting from the exhaust port indicating it was on. The noise from whatever was happening around him was now so loud that it reminded Dave of buzzing cicadas that he had heard as a kid when visiting his aunt Laurel in Arizona.  The cicada buzz used to be so loud that it would drown out the cheap Mexican landscaping that his aunt would hire during the heat of the summer. 

He looked up from the engine toward the shoreline that seemed so distant and tiny. *Why had he come out so far?* He thought regretfully. The distance from civilization no longer comforting Dave in the slightest. 

With that thought, he faced forward and throttled the engine. The initial sudden lurch forward knocked the coffee out of his cupholder onto the floor of the boat, and almost nearly spilled the still-open bucket of bait just at his feet. Dave did not seem to notice. 

As quickly as the boat lurched forward, it immediately stopped. The Yamaha engine had almost certainly died. “SON OF A BITCH!” Dave shouted. 

The noise grew impossibly louder still and the amount of bubbles hitting the aluminum hull began to vibrate the boat. The water around Radar now looked like it was coming to a boil. The vibration gave gooseflesh down Dave’s bundled-up arms and legs. 

Dave was no longer messing around. With fierce determination, he spun around toward the engine, snatched up the rip cord in his right hand, and jerked **hard** like his life depended on it. This time no stream of cooling water shot out of the exhaust port, indicating it was on, but Dave wasn’t looking for the stream of water from the exhaust port, he was distracted with what was now sitting in his hand. The frayed line that was the ripcord had snapped away from the Yamaha engine and dangled dumbly out of Dave’s hand that clutched the knob. Dave stood unmoving with a look of cold disbelief.  

It took a moment for his brain to kick back on. Snapping back into reality, Dave began looking around wildly in all directions for **any** indication of life. Looking for a boat to wave at frantically for help. But he did not see any boats. 
*Where was everyone?* 
He knew it was early, but this was opening day!  There had to be others out on the bay.  
Although there were others out that day, Dave did not know that soon after departing the boat launch, the older gentleman whom he had waved to, backed his large trailer and boat directly into the dock with such force that it dislodged the dock for any other would-be crabbers that morning. Later, the old man would blame the curve that led down to the boat ramp, saying “That it should not be so sharp!”. This reasoning would not ultimately save him from the fact he would be paying to repair the dock, but others did agree with his statement. That singular boat launch was the most popular not only due to its convenience but also because it was the *only* one serving the general public in the area.  You would have to drive 45 miles out of Brimmer Bay to the adjacent harbor of Awhauktoo Bay to launch, which many folks ended up doing that day.  One individual even remarked Dave was “one lucky fuck” as they watched the sole crabber drone out into the bay that morning, disappearing to a dot as they made plans to drive to the adjacent harbor.   

Dave patted down his faded jeans for the familiar lump, feeling for what he already knew wasn’t there, his cell phone. Radar was not equipped with a radio, it wasn’t used enough to garner such a thing, but Dave could not help thinking about how stupid he was to not bring anything except his fucking wallet and crabbing license. The mounting frustration came out as a loud “FUCK” almost involuntarily from Daves's mouth.  He was stranded. 

The now completely enveloped boat was jostling back and forth, making it impossible to stand without the chance of falling overboard.  Dave could imagine a fasten seatbelt sign popping up above him as he sat back down, a captain coming over the intercom, “Sorry folks, we are going to be hitting unexpected turbulence.  Please fasten your seatbelts for your safety until we turn off the light”. Dave braced himself on the engine and rim of the boat, waiting for whatever was to come next. 

The vibration and hum chattered his teeth. Dave clamped down hard trying to prevent his jaw from moving. Off to the right of Dave, a dim blue-gray glow could now be seen emanating from where the original batch of bubbles had sprung up earlier. At first, it was about the size of a small dinner plate, but as it grew brighter it also started expanding. The water slowly stopped bubbling and was now steadily churning as the surface tension of the water kept breaking repeatedly as if a submarine were rising from the depths. The noise from the bubbles was replaced with a low-toned hum that resonated with both the boat and Dave’s tense body. The slow-growing blue light was now the size of a large transit van, the hum so loud it began to blur Dave’s vision, making his eyes water.  With morbid curiosity and fear, Dave leaned over the side of the beat. Squinting hard Dave had a hard time discerning what was now only 10-15 feet below the water’s surface. The confusion was not only due to his blurring vision but also because what he saw made no sense. 

Large Interlaced silver rings spun below the boat. Multiple rings rotated counterclockwise and clockwise independently at a slow gentle speed. Inside of the rings appeared to be a cube-- no, a sphere *within* a cube, that was glowing with a bright blue light. Dave could not tell, but the rings seemed to have something etched along the outside of the bands, something not in any language he knew.  The low-toned hum seemed to be emitting directly from this object that lay below the boat. 

At the outer edges of the blue light that emanated from the sphere, Dave saw what had to be a large fish moving in and out of the edges of the light. Dave leaned further, his face catching licks of the roiling water, and tried to focus his vision as best he could. A large silhouette was cast in the glow of the object. The shape of the dark silhouette looked more humanoid than fish-like, although it had tendencies of both. Its elongated appendices jutting out from its unmoving body, bobbed in and out of the glow as they moved with the current. Dave could swear whatever this thing was, it could see him. He saw no eyes or face, but he **knew** it could see him. This was not a fish moving in and out of the light, but a person with impossibly long arms and legs. The head of the being did not look like a single head but something larger, the silhouette was dark, but he could swear the large oval-shaped head was staring directly at him.  Dave was frozen, staring at the creature in horror and amazement.  He tried pulling his head away, but his body was no longer obeying his mind.  A new noise had popped up, something coming from what seemed to be the creature. A loud moan was being broadcasted directly into his head, along with the hum from the object. The moan pitched up and down continuously sounding ancient and guttural. The moan seemed undecipherable, but in Dave's mind, a small phrase began to repeat. 
“WE HAVE COME, WE HAVE COME, WE HAVE COME, WE HAVE COME”
Dave could not move his fixated gaze but could open his mouth to scream. His eyes now streaming with blood as he was forced to stare at the horror below.  

Without notice, a beam of light shot up from the rings and hit the left half of his face. The intense burning sensation slapped him from his gaze. The sudden jolt of pain seemed to grant his freedom of movement. Quickly reeling back from the scene below, he reflexively brought his hands up to his face, throwing him off balance.  Stepping back to catch his weight, his brown boot caught on the stacked crab pots. Dave started to careen down toward the edge of the boat, thinking for one second that he might be heading toward the dark water. Instead, his head clipped the side of the boat, knocking Dave unconscious and strewn beside the crab pots. 


It was dark when Dave came too. The feeling of opening his eyes to complete and utter darkness disoriented him, but his vision slowly began to adjust.  
*Had he dreamt of the events?* 
That thought slowly started to fade as he felt his face and recoiled from the touch. He was badly burnt. On top of that, he seemed to have limited vision out of his left eye. He stuck out his hands in front of him, closing his right eye he could barely make out the digits extending from both hands. The eye ached, but not as bad as his head and face.

A new thought came to him, *was he closer to shore or had he moved farther out?*  Pondering this, he sat up. 

He couldn’t tell from his surroundings; it was too dark to see the shore. He knew his better half had to have called the Coast Guard by now, but if they were looking for him, they weren’t looking in the right spot.  No lights shined on the horizon, no helicopter blades whirred, no boat engines rang in the distance. The only noise he could hear was a faint low-pitched hum. 

What *was* prominent to his dazed senses was an awful smell, the salmon from earlier that morning. Stomach turning, half from the odor, and half from the concussion he most certainly had; he threw the whole bucket into the water, which seemed to swallow up the worst of the smell. 

He dragged himself onto the bench seat rubbing his temple, avoiding the burn covering his face. 
*What was he to do now? Sit and wait?*
Dave was not too fond of that idea, but he almost certainly would be forced to do it. He scanned the horizon again, looking into the air for a helicopter, a plane, or anything at all. Would they be looking at night? He didn’t know. Dave couldn’t even see the stars that night due to the morning overcast persisting through the day and now into the night. 

Dave turned his focus to the low subtle hum that seemed to be a faint version of the hum he had heard earlier that morning. It no longer seemed to be emitting from the water below him. The surface lay almost perfectly still in the cool night, vastly different from this morning. The faint hum seemed to be coming from above him. Dave looked straight up. Squinting, he could barely make out the twisting of rings some 50 feet above. A frog caught in Dave’s throat and an involuntary whimper tried to escape his lips. 

Dave remembered now; *we have come*. He stood to his feet. 

“WHAT DO YOU WANT?!” Dave shouted, “WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT?!”. Dave was no longer scared; he was mad dog angry. If he was to die, he would not die a coward. “YOU PIECE OF SHIT, WHA-”. 

Blue light began to glow from the object above.  The low-pitched hum exploded now, almost as loud as it had been before. The blue light formed into a circle, then slowly started to funnel down to the boat below. 

Dave froze, tensing up. He pictured the creature silhouetted in the dark water from earlier. The long arms and legs extended out from the dark shadow that looked up from the depths. Dave’s eyes shot down to the boat, scanning the items he brought along that day. He needed a weapon.

The funnel of light halfway down now, he scrambled around on his hands and knees, frantically looking for what he always brought with him. His hands found the small pouch tucked under the bench seat closest to the stern.  Ripping it open, he brought out a small pocketknife used for cutting line or small rope. Not the most ideal weapon, but it would do. He stood back up looking into the light. 

The light was almost touching his head, Daves courage began to wane. He shrank from the light almost touching his face. Feeling desperate, in a last-ditch effort, Dave decided to do the unthinkable, he dove off the edge of the boat. 

Dave closed his eyes waiting to meet the embrace of ice-cold water, but it had not come. He slowly opened his eyes; the blue light now fully enveloped him. He was staring down at the boat. His body was not moving toward the water but moving slowly up and away. He spotted the pocketknife he had pulled out laying useless in the shrinking boat below.

 A loud moan began filling his ears, pitching up and down, mixing in with the low-pitched hum. Dave hysterically screamed out, “PLEASE, WHAT DO YOU WANT?! GOD WHAT DO YOU WANT?!”

The loud moan projected a phrase into Dave’s mind as it had done before, and this time, he heard a voice along with the phrase. A loud guttural moan bellowed into not only his mind but his whole body. 

**“YOU”**

The light blinked out; the low-pitched hum was gone. 

Dave was gone. 

Radar sat idly on still water. A slight breeze now swaying the boat ever so slightly. The sun began to crest the horizon as the early morning dawn filled with the first rays of light.  The horizon slowly transitioned from darkness to a soft shade of blue. In the distance, the faint sound of a helicopter’s blade whirred.
