I'm never buying hotdogs from the corner store on my street again.

It was a normal Wednesday night. I had been at work most of the day and arrived home around 10:00pm. I was exhausted, so I decided to watch some TV on my couch with my dog Snoodles. She is one of those little white mutt dogs. Many people call her ugly but she's my baby. I was watching TV for a couple hours, around 12:30AM I began to get hungry. I hadn't gone shopping because I've been so busy with work, so I had no food in my apartment. The only place that's open is a corner store about a block from my house. I go to this store fairly regularly and nothing odd has ever happened. It was a nice night out, so I thought I would walk there to get a snack before bed. I left my house and got to the store about 10 minutes later. I was walking around the coolers when they caught my eye, a pack of 8 hotdogs. It brought me back to my childhood, nice summer days eating hotdogs while laughing and playing with my brothers. I walked up to the register to pay for my food, the cashier wasn't paying me much attention until he saw the hotdogs. He gave me a strange look, but I didn't think much of it considering I was buying hotdogs at 1:00 in the morning. I left the store and started walking back home. 

   When I unlocked the door to my apartment, Snoodles began to growl at me. She never does this, so I started to get a little worried. I thought she had to go outside so I placed the hotdogs down on the counter and took her out. When I got back the hotdogs were on the other end of the counter. I didn't remember putting them there, but I figured the exhaustion from work was getting to me. I grabbed the hotdogs and ripped open the package, once again Snoodles started to growl from the other side of the room. This is when I started to think something was wrong. I got a plate out, poked some holes in the hotdogs and threw two in the microwave. I set the timer for a minute and a half. About 15 seconds in a ratchet smell filled the room. At 1-minute Snoodles started to bark directly at the microwave. I tried to tell her to quiet down, but she wouldn't. 

   Then, I got a knock at my door. It was 1:20am, no one ever knocks on my door that late, or really ever. I look through the peep hole, and it's the cashier from the corner store, with a really weird smile on his face. Then, I realize I never locked my door. I rushed to lock my door, but it was too late, he was already in. I tried to ask what he was doing here but all I could get out was "Wha" before he pulled out his knife which had the handle of a hot dog. The microwave is at 52 seconds now, when I felt the blade rip through my shirt, down to my stomach. I tried to scream, Snoodles was barking like crazy but still hasn't moved, but before I could fully scream, a hot dog was shoved down my throat. One of my hotdogs, right from the package. It was cold and wet. I started choking. He didn't stop there, before I knew it, I was getting a hot dog shoved into my stab wound. The same thing happened four more times. Stab, hot dog, stab, hot dog, stab, hot dog, stab, hot dog. I was laying there, helpless, choking on a cold, wet hot dog, bleeding out. The hotdogs didn't stop the bleeding. He was standing over me, a crazed look on his face, covered in my blood. Only 10 seconds left on the microwave. The cashier slowly makes his way over to the microwave. 5 seconds left. He makes his way there. 2 seconds left. He reaches for the handle. 1 second left. The microwave goes off.

   I wake up in my bed. I go to work. It's a normal Wednesday night.  I had been at work most of the day and arrived home around 10:00pm. I was exhausted so I decided to watch some TV on my couch with my dog Snoodles. Around 12:30am, I got a strange craving for hot dogs. The only place that's open is the corner store about a block from my house.
