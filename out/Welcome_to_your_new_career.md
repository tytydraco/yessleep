The megaphone echoed across the massive 20,000 square foot warehouse. Racks filled every aisle, stacked so tightly the space felt smaller than it should have been. Every row looked identical. I remember thinking that if I took a wrong turn, no one would notice.

The rest of us stood around, bumping shoulders, waiting for instructions that never came. The job listing hadn’t said much.

CALL HERE

It felt like a scam.

But I needed the money.

The call connected immediately.

The moment it did, the light in my room dipped—just slightly, like someone adjusted a dimmer switch. The shadows along the walls thickened, corners growing deeper than they should have been.

“Hello! Thank you for your interest in working with us,” the AI voice said brightly. “Please note: once this interview begins, the call cannot be disconnected.”

I pulled the phone away from my ear.

“This includes hanging up, powering down, or damaging the device,” it continued. “Attempting to end the call will not be effective.”

I stared at the screen.

“Why would I damage the phone?”

“You can’t afford to replace it,” the AI replied immediately.

My throat tightened.

“Let’s begin,” it said. “Question one.”

Do you remember the last time someone depended on you?

As I hesitated, the darkness in the corner of the room seemed to firm—no longer just shadow, but something with shape, like the absence of light was being held in place.

“…Yeah.”

“Answer recorded. Congratulations!”

The dark mass adjusted. It didn’t spread. It shifted, as if responding.

“Question two.”

If you were locked in a room with no light, would you stay where you are… or try to find the exit?

The shape separated itself from the corner.

It stood.

Facing me.

“I’d try to find the exit,” I said.

“Excellent choice!”

The figure moved.

Not closer.

Closer enough.

The floor creaked beneath it, though its feet never quite touched.

“Final question,” the AI said cheerfully. “Please answer promptly.”

There is a stranger, a coworker, and someone who trusts you.

As the words left the speaker, the figure stretched its arms outward.

The darkness responded.

It peeled away from the walls, flooded across the ceiling, poured over the floor. The room collapsed inward, swallowed whole. Lamps died. Screens went black. The last traces of light vanished until only the glow of my phone remained.

You may save one.
You may discard one.
One will remain.

The figure’s hands reached through the dark, fingers unfurling as if they were pulling the room closed.

I couldn’t see anything else now.

Just the phone.

Just the screen.

“Failure to answer,” the AI continued calmly, “will result in automatic assignment.”

My arms shook as I lifted the phone.

I turned it slowly.

The light crept across something inches from my face.

There was no expression. No eyes. Just a suggestion of features, pressed close, waiting. The darkness around it didn’t move. It didn’t need to.

The loudspeaker crackled.

“WELCOME,” it boomed.

“Your shift has begun.”
