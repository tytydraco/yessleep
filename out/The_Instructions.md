They say every artist starves at some point—mine just happened to be in a literal sense. My last painting hadn’t sold, my student loans were hatching into dragons, and I was down to my final cup of instant noodles when I saw the listing.

Live in assistant needed. No experience required. $1,200/week. Room and board included.

The job ad was nestled between escort solicitations and nanny gigs on an obscure art community forum. The username was simply Jonas, and his profile picture was a swirl of blurred colors that looked vaguely like a melted face. That alone should’ve been enough to make me scroll past. But broke people do desperate things, and desperation eats up suspicion like firewood.

I messaged him. Within minutes, I got a reply.

You’ll do. Come tonight. Midnight. Bring nothing but yourself.

That should’ve been the second red flag. But the way hunger churned in my stomach, it was more like a green light.

The gallery sat on the outskirts of town, in that weird no-man’s land between industrial warehouses and abandoned train tracks. I biked the three miles from my apartment because my car had died two weeks ago. Every pedal rotation felt like a countdown.

The building didn’t look like much—sand-colored brick, no signage, no lights in the windows. Just a narrow red door with a lion’s-head knocker and a flickering streetlamp hovering above like a curious god.

I knocked once. The door opened.

No one stood there.

I hesitated, then stepped inside.

It wasn’t a gallery. It was a cathedral for madness.

Art lined every wall, floor to ceiling. Not in neat, curated grids but piled and layered portraits slashed across each other, ornate frames crowding cracked glass, sculptures fused into impossible amalgams. Some pieces looked ancient. Some pulsed faintly, as if they breathed.

On a high-backed chair near the center sat a man in a dark green robe. He didn’t speak. He only nodded

That was my welcome.

The first night, I slept in a small upstairs room lined with velvet and empty frames. There was no bed just a mattress on the floor and a note pinned to the pillow.



**Sleep before the moon passes the third quadrant. Do not enter the viewing halls between 3:01 and 3:33 a.m. Under no circumstances should you touch the porcelain bust in the east wing.**

**–J.**

I thought it was some kind of twisted artist prank.

But I followed the instructions.

That first week was easy. I dusted shelves, logged inventory, and polished statues that looked back at me when I wasn’t looking. Jonas never appeared again, at least not in the flesh. I got my payments via wire transfer every Friday at noon. The number never changed: $1,200 on the dot.

I figured I’d lucked out. Weird, yes. But not dangerous.

Not yet.

The changes began subtle. Little things.

One night, the sculpture I’d dusted an hour earlier was gone. Another time, I caught my reflection blinking out of sync. The east wing always seemed a few degrees colder than the rest of the building. I told myself it was old pipes, bad insulation. That I was imagining things.

Then came the second note.

**Prepare the gallery for overnight occupation. Your first vigil begins tonight. Do not permit the silence to grow too loud. If the lights fail, light the red candle. Do not pray. Do not speak. Do not close your eyes unless you must.**

**–J.**

It was written on the back of a torn canvas, the ink so fresh it smudged under my fingers. That night, I did what he asked. I brought a sleeping bag to the central gallery, placed the red candle in the middle of the mosaic floor, and sat in silence.

At 3:12 a.m., the lights went out.

I lit the candle.

And the eyes in the portraits opened.

I stayed frozen, breath held tight, trying to pretend it was still some elaborate performance art experience. But then the bust in the east wing began to weep. Its porcelain face cracked in slow, inching fissures, and from inside the cracks, small whispers poured like smoke.

That’s when I knew something was deeply wrong. Not wrong in the quirky rich-eccentric way. But wrong like something ancient had sunk its teeth into this place, and I’d walked right into its belly.

I left the gallery floor at dawn. The eyes were closed by then, the candle melted to a red puddle. My hands trembled as I peeled back the velvet curtain to return upstairs.

 

Another note waited on the mattress:

**Very good. You’re learning.**

**–J.**

 

That was Week Two.

Each day after that brought new instructions. Sometimes benign rearrange the collection in this exact pattern, burn this sage bundle in the northern hallway.

Other times, stranger sit beside the broken sundial and whisper your birth date backwards, draw your own self-portrait without a mirror.

I did what I was told. Not out of curiosity, not even because of the money.

Because I had the feeling that if I disobeyed, the gallery would notice.

And the gallery didn’t forgive.

The worst came on my third overnight vigil.

A new instruction waited:

**If the radio plays music, do not sing along. If the ash doll smiles, leave the room. If you feel warmth behind you—run.**

**–J.**

 At midnight, the radio an antique tube contraption I’d never seen before clicked on by itself. Soft jazz floated through the space, warped and staticky. I sat still, willing myself to be numb.

At 2:47, the ash doll smiled.

I didn’t move fast enough.

She stood five feet tall, carved from scorched wood and lacquered bone dust, perched on a pedestal beneath a skylight. I’d thought she was harmless. Just another eerie sculpture. But when her mouth twisted into that lopsided grin, the lights snapped off again.

The candle wouldn’t light.

And I felt warmth at my back.

I ran.

 I don’t know what chased me. I don’t remember much of that sprint, just the thrum of my heartbeat, the pressure of something breathing too close, the way the walls shifted behind me, refusing to be familiar. I didn’t stop until I locked myself inside the basement utility closet, surrounded by old paint cans and jars of insect wings.

When I emerged at dawn, the gallery was calm.

But there was a new addition near the front entrance: a painting.

It was me.

Sleeping.

The ash doll crouched at my side.

I should have left. Packed up and never looked back. But fear and inertia are strange bedfellows. The money still came. Jonas still didn’t appear. But his notes became more frequent.

And then the final one arrived.

It was written on parchment. A checklist.

**Tonight, you will perform your last vigil. Follow the instructions precisely.**

**Lock all gallery doors by 11:45 p.m.**

**Light three red candles in the shape of an equilateral triangle in the main chamber.**

**At 12:03 a.m., wind the grandfather clock backwards three times.**

**Speak your full name only once.**

**If you hear knocking, do not answer.**

**If your phone rings, do not answer.**

**If Jonas arrives, do not speak.**

**Keep your eyes closed from 3:00 to 3:17 a.m.**

**Do not sleep.**

**Burn this note after reading.**

**–J.**

I burned the note.

I followed every step.

Except one.

 

At 3:04 a.m., I opened my eyes.

I don’t know why I did it. Morbid curiosity? A test of control? But for unknown seconds, I looked.

The gallery was full.

Not of art.

Of them.

Things wearing the gallery’s contents like skin. Figures stitched from sculpture limbs and canvases, masks for faces, frames for ribs. And at their center stood Jonas or something shaped like him.

He didn’t move.

But he smiled.

And then I blinked.

They were gone.

When morning came, a package sat by the red door. Inside was my final paycheck. $5,000 in crisp bills. And a sketch.

Me, asleep. In my new apartment. The ash doll by the window.

That was three weeks ago. I haven’t seen or heard from Jonas since. But every night, at 3:04 a.m., I wake up gasping.
