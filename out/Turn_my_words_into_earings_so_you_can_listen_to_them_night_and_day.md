My best friend Peter is originally from the country side of Lamia, Greece. Him and his parents would often visit the country. I liked when Peter would tell me stories about the country. Peter had a cousin named Theodora for short Dora, Dora had a best friend named Helen, Peter was madly in love with Helen, obsessed. Peter would lie to his parents about how much he missed grandma and the village just to see Helen again. Even though they weren't an item, Peter and Helen would text minimum 3 hours a day, to the point of Peter rejecting girls from our city, "*there is someone else*" Peter would say.

Eventually Dora visited Athens and brought Helen with her. I didn't know much about Dora, I mostly asked Peter about his progression with Helen, like an avid reality show watcher. But Dora knew a lot about me, when all of us hanged out, Dora (4 inches taller with long black fringe bangs) pulled me aside and kissed me, it was my first kiss, so was Dora's. On the flipside Peter and Helen's date didn't go well. Helen prefered another guy from the friend group, John whom she just met. While me and Dora are laying on the sand twirling each other's hair, John comes and asks Peter if its ok for him to make a move. You could see 100 different emotions on Peter's face. Peter has been waitting for this moment for years, he has been texting Helen for 3 years, only for her to choose John instead. Let's say things did not go well. Eventually Peter and John made up.

Me and Dora keep in touch to this day. We share nostalgia and innocence from our youth. 4 years later (adults now), Helen finds me and follows me, both on Facebook Skype and Instagram. Helen had changed, she was sporting a blue bob haircut and her profile pic was a scandalous cosplay of the blue haired girl from Evangelion, her description said "*studying Japanese, hoping to move to Japan one day*". At the beginning Helen was telling me how wholesome she finds my relationship with Dora, she asked me what is our status ? I said "*just friends*". After that, the conversation turned sexual, and for the next 7 months me and Helen would sext each other and even mutually masturbate over Skype. I didn't tell Peter.

Helen dms me "*I'm going on a trip with my family, we will stop by the Athens mall, it's a chance to see each other in person*". Without hesitation I headed to the mall. When our eyes met she jumped on my arms and fell on top of me. We both caressed each others' heads, time froze, laying in the middle of the mall floor for 2 minutes without caring about the rest of the universe. We found an elevator that was rarely used and we made out for a few minutes and she carried on with her trip. I watched her leave like a breeze in the wind.

A week later, Peter tells me about 2 free tickets for a thrash metal concert, the openers are John's band. The timing couldn't be any better, I sure needed to blow some steam off after my secret meeting with Helen. During the concert a black patron joinned. You never see black guys at thrash metal concerts. Everyone dabbed him up, people were buying him drinks, passing joints to him, he was getting as much attention as the band on stage LOL!!! His name is Adonis, large messy afro, peace sign tshirt, with jean shorts, he's a flute player for an orchestra, he came from the countryside to perform. He is one of those "*music is life*" type of guys, he likes checking music regardless of genre. I told him "*I love the country, which countryside are you from?*" He replies "*outside of Lamia*".

My face went like The Rock's eyebrow raise O\_\_o. Thank god Peter was nowhere near Adonis when he said that, Peter is scared of black guys. I get near Adonis I lower my voice while looking around "*do you know an Helen with blue hair?*". Adonis replies "*Maan, Helen is trouble, run away dude, she likes to tease guys, she does this thing, she likes to pretend she didn't see you and sits on your lap, she knows how to get her little ass cheecks between your dick to get you rallied up, then she says 'oh sorry, I didn't notice you sitting there', she steals boyfriends from other girls, only to dump them a day later, guys have gotten into fights over Helen, nobody likes her, she is a menace, no wonder she wants to move out of Lamia*" end quote. I wish I payed attention to what Adonis said, the only thing I was thinking was "*yeah, he knows Helen allright*". I ask Adonis when is he planning to go back to Lamia, he says he can't afford a hotel room he is going to a 24hour McDonalds for 5-6 hours to catch the first bus back to Lamia. I say "*sleep over to my place dude".* Adonis accepts excitingly.

After the concert Peter is helping John's band get their gear in the van. Peter comes to me "*are you seriously inviting HIM to your house?*", I tell Peter "*yes Peter, I'm inviting a human person to my house*" but in my head I'm thinking he is my ticket to see Helen again. Since there wasn't enough room in the van for all of us, me and Adonis catch the midnight train. I tell Adonis "*I want to come with you to Lamia and see Helen but I'm broke right now*". Adonis replies "*don't worry I can buy you a ticket*". Then we both started chanting TRIP TRIP TRIP until the other passengers shooshed us. Back to my place, I ask Adonis to play the flute, he told me he doesn't travel with one, he uses one at the orchestra. I set up the couch for Adonis and I head to bed. 10 minutes later Adonis comes to my room with a pillow and a blanket "*I can't sleep in the couch*", so I offer the bed and I lay on the couch. 10 minutes later Adonis comes over to the living room "*I feel trapped in the bedroom*". We lift the bed matress, we bring it to the living room. I tell Adonis "*if you don't like the matress in the living room, there is nothing else I can do".* Then Adonis puts a blanket over his head and starts crying. We barely slept 2 hours.

The next morning we go to the bus station, Adonis buys me a ticket 23euros (Jesus), single route no return, I felt like it was a message that I have to buy my own return ticket, there are limits to kindness I guess haha. My budget is 30euros, I have a wiggle room of 7euros. Lamia is a 4 hour trip, I felt like I teleported there, I slept the entire way. Adonis didn't sleep, as soon as we arrived he went home, no good luck, no goodbye, nothing.

Helen tells me to meet her at a crepe shop, she eats a crepe, we go behind a church we just chatted, it was still daylight and kids were playing nearby. Helen says "*nobody can see us holding hands or kiss, not even the little kids, nobody can learn about us, that is the problem with this shitty fucking village, tiny village big mouths".* I apologise, then Helen scolds me for coming to Lamia with Adonis, "*people know you came, you can only come to Lamia in secret and only when I tell to, if I don't go out tonight, people will think we are fucking, do you understand what you have done?".* I reply "*I'm sorry I caused you so much trouble, I love you*". 22:30 we go to a popular bar, I met Helen's 2 friends Sotiria and Eleftheria, they scanned me head to toe with their looks. And for the next 90 minutes, we sat in complete silence while all 3 were glued to their phones messaging each other. It was so obvious the were messaging about me. I said how about we put the phones down. All 3 replied is synchrony IM TALKING TO MY MOM. Like a lie they are used to saying. Afterwards me and Helen went behind the church and we went 2nd base. It was time for Helen's dad to pick her up.  
\- Can I come over to your place ?  
\- Remember 4 years ago when I came to Athens and there was a situation with John ?  
\- Yes.  
\- I never told my parents, things didn't work out with Peter. They still think I'm dating Peter, it's a great excuse to visit Athens every now and then.  
\- Do your parents know how Peter looks ?  
\- No.  
\- Then introduce me as Peter.  
\- You met my brother at the mall, I told you not to. He knows you aren't Peter. That little dipshit, it's such a fucking snitch. My dad is waitting, goodnight.

So, I am all alone in a village I know nothing about, 1am at night. My only option was to call Adonis, he picked me up with his bike, we arrive at his home. Adonis' home is a majestic hotel deep in the country, with their surname plastered all over the place like a mini Trump-tower. But Adonis doesn't live in the hotel, he lives in a tiny shed next to the hotel really trashy. The shed had multiple graffiti on the outside, and inside was just a matress on the floor in the corner, a chair and a desk, no photos, electronics, books or musical instruments. But I had no other option. This was not the time to sus his room. I asked Adonis how are we both going to sleep in a single matress? Adonis said he just woke up he is good. I told him I'm really tired, I'm sleeping right away. Ok.......................................................................................................................  
I WAKE UP IN SHOCK ADONIS IS NAKED AND HIS HAND IS INSIDE MY PANTS GRABBING MY DICK, I SCREAM, HE TRIES TO COVER MY MOUTH, I PUT MY FOOT ON HIS CHEST AND PUSHED KICKED HIM, WE WRESTLE, I GRAB HIS HEAD AND I KNEE HIS HEAD MANY TIMES, I DROOL, I BITE, I SCRATCH, I PANIC. \*The door bursts open\*.

Adonis' Dad "*How many times I told you, to not bring anymore \*homophobic slurs\*, in my house ? How many times ? You \*homophobic slur\* get out of my house NOW!!*!". He slapped my back on the way out really hard. I ran. Adonis was not part of an orchestra, he did not play the flute, not only he could afford a hotel room in Athens, they had a 2nd hotel in Athens which he worked at. Adonis was not a music guy, Adonis loved fucking straight white boys. In a regular club Adonis would get zero attention, but a metal concert is the perfect breeding ground for his scheme.

I walked for 6 hours towards the Lamia center, within those 6 hours, the only vehicles I saw, was 2 tracktors heading the opposite way, they were probably going to work, at one point I had to scare off a pack of stray dogs with a stick, they were blocking the road. The sweat is making my wounds burn, I have a bruised back, busted lip, and many scratches on my neck, shoulders and arms. When I reached Lamia I drank an entire litre of orange juice. Helen finally picks up.  
\- Why did you call me so many times yesterday ?  
\- Listen Helen, I seriously need your help right now.  
\- Today ? I can't, my parents are really mad at me for failling classes, I need to pretend to study all day today.  
\- Can't you find an excuse ? Like walking to get air. Please I feel like I'm dying right now \*sob sob\*.  
\- Maybe another day, I can't leave my house today.  
\- Another day ? I don't know if I'm ever coming back to this place, I traveled all the way here and I'm in need of serious help right now, a stranger would help me, you aren't even studying you are pretending to study.  
\- After getting home so late yesterday, I have to save face today. Bye bye

I took the bus back to Athens, Peter called me "*DID YOU FUCK HELEN? TELL ME RIGHT NOW DID YOU FUCK HER?".* Dora saw me in Lamia. She wondered why I didn't come to speak to her, she asked Peter if I was upset with her. Fuck the only person I didn't want to see me in Lamia. I told Peter "*just let go man, it's been 4 years let go*". Peter since then for the last 10 years has held a grudge on me, he keeps harassing me, when I walk on the street he stops his car honks and yells insults, the other guys don't speak to me. He has come to 2 of my jobs created a scene and asked the manager to fire me. I had to adress the police in a different county, police said you have to complain to the local police. I told them, he has relatives in the local police. Peter eventually dated Helen, their relationship lasted 3 entire days.
