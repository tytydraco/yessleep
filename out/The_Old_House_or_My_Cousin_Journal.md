Last spring, my cousin Danny went missing. No one in the family is sure why. He lived across the country from us, in Donegal. The only thing I've been able to get a hold of us is his diary. I've transcribed it here.  It's been months now and I just don't know what to do, that's why I'm asking you. Maybe we can figure out what happened, because I sure as hell can't.

March 21

I recently discovered an old house while exploring the countryside. It has clearly been abandoned for years now, probably from around the Famine, if I had to judge based on first impressions. Then I entered the building and found it not quite empty. There was a television resting on a chair, the seat growing mold and legs covered by lichens, the plug draped over it. I found that odd, but kept exploring.

The house is divided in two rooms by a thick wall of stacked stones held in place by cement. The front room I presume to have been simultaneously the kitchen, the living room, and the dining room, while the back was probably the bedrooms for parents and children. I found a small straw doll in there, clothed in bits of rag. No beds though. Probably removed when the original occupations left. Unsure as to why the television and chair are there. Shall have to go back tomorrow and investigate more.

March 24

Went back today. Spent yesterday being lazy after a long day at work. Used today to unwind further, taking a walk before returning to the house.

The house itself, it sits in an old field I often passed by while walking, one which I’ve always noticed is conspicuously empty despite every other field housing sheep and cows. I assume it’s because it’s unowned. So when I decided to walk over it I assumed that it would lead to no trouble. Not much has changed since my initial visit, but I think mice live there. Heard noises.

March 31

Mice absolutely live in the old house. Not only was the cord knocked off the telly, I found a dead one. It was lying on its side. Almost thought it was a toy. There was a small blood stain around its mouth. I tossed it outside for something to eat. I assume the mouse died from something in its throat. Inspected the telly. Covered in dust, so I brushed some off. Screen seems brand new, but the plug bothers me a little. The TV must have come from America, so why’d someone bring it to Ireland? Don’t think they had adapters when it was built.

Checked the fireplace. It’s unclogged. I could see the sky through it. It was a grey day.

Weirdly, I’m starting to like this old house. Feels rather charming. I might come back tomorrow.

April 2

Wasn’t able to visit the house yesterday. Instead had to go into work because someone called in sick. I’m a little bitter over it, but not sure why. It’s just a house, not even somewhere I could live. Probably hasn’t been lived in since the Famine.

But then, why is the telly and chair there?

April 5

Strangest thing happened today. While visiting the house, I decided to sit down and relax, feeling tired. As I closed my eyes, I must have drifted off to sleep for a few hours, because when I opened them again, it was dark outside. But when I checked my phone the battery was the same. Only the time had changed. Resilient little battery, but it’s never done that before. Before leaving, thought I saw an indentation in the fireplace, but didn’t check.

April 9

Checked fireplace. There was an indentation there, covered by a grate. I lifted it. There’s an empty hole inside, deep. Dropped a stone down it. Didn’t hear it hit the bottom. I'm guessing some kind of tunnel was dug here or collapsed, but cannot figure out why.

I almost looked with the flashlight of my phone, but stopped. Suddenly felt watched. Replaced the grate. Before I left, I decided to check the television again. Weird. The reflections in it seem warped. But I did see something move in it, outside the window. I think somebody’s watching this place.

April 12

Came back, with a golf club. A five iron. Big and heavy. Gotta make sure nobody is watching me. I was exploring the field when I stepped on something.

It was a dead mouse. Almost thought it was the same one, but decided that wasn’t possible. I’d dropped it in front of the door, and this mouse was about halfway across the field. Tried to find some mouse prints nearby but didn’t. Just wanted to try and find the bugger’s nest. Not even sure what to look for.

April 14

That house is starting to spook me. When I went back today at about 1 (not even sure why I am anymore) the chair had been moved, TV still on it. Both were in the middle of the front room. The plug was wrapped around one of the legs. I don't know how that's possible. Someone else must be visiting. TV screen was broken, so could see inside. Nothing interesting, but thought I saw the movement in the fireplace in the reflection.

There's something else. While checking out the back of the house, I heard something. It came from the fireplace. I checked it. There was air coming out of it.

There is air coming from out of the grate.

It felt cold and musky. I... I don't know what to write here. How far down does that hole go?

Not the only thing that happened. When I stood up, I realized it was night time. Checked phone to find it was midnight. I left immediately.

I don't want to go back.

April 15

I still don't want to go back to that house.

April 16

I didn't go back to the house.

April 17

Saw house in dream. Grate was off the hole. It was so dark...

April 17

Found myself walking along the trail to the house. Don't know why. Ran home immediately. Thinking of calling family for help.

No, they'd not take me seriously. Never did. Going to look into any bits of folklore.

April 17

Nothing in folklore. Not one solitary reference to the house. Something is not right there. Keep feeling watched, but always from its direction.

April 18

I swear, I haven't been back to the house since the 14, but there's fresh mud all over the front step. Almost like big boot prints, but totally solid, without any grooves or patterns. Someone must have broken in.

April 19

Woke up at midnight. Sounds from outside the window. I looked, but nothing was there. Still hear them. They sounded distant and hollow. It came from the direction of the field.

April 19

I went back to the house. I didn't go inside, just stood at the edge of the field. Looking.

April 20

Last time I'm going back to the house, because the more I think on it, the more I don't think those shadows were in the right... hard to describe, but the way the shadows have been bending in that place doesn't make sense. Like they aren't cast by sunlight.

April 20

Back from field. House still there. Not going back now. I'm finally done with the damned thing.

April 30

I've been having horrid dreams lately. About the fireplace. I keep seeing the grate moving off of the hole and sliding along the floor toward me. Then it stops. Then it flies through the air. Then there's heavy thumps and dust is rising from the floor with each one.

Dreams don't end when I wake up.

April 31

I went back to the house. Again. Why? I shouldn't be doing this, something is wrong with the damn thing. But I have to, though, don't I? I have to because... I just have to.

I reached the door. Almost went inside. But heard noises on the other end. Didn't run. Just listened. Sounded like the clicking of teeth or stones. Heard that dragging noise.

Wind was cold, not the air.

May 1

THERE'S SOMETHING IN THE HOUSE.

That was my cousin's last entry. He's been missing since May 2. He'd been taking days off work very frequently, and at times were becoming combative and irritable. I don't understand why. I went searching for that house as well, but couldn't find it. I did find the field it was probably in, but nothing was in there except for heather bushes and lots of grass. I did, however, find a crushed dead mouse in a boot print. Looked to be about his size.

I found his journal beside his bed. It was on the floor, face open, partially covered by one of the thrown blankets. It looked like Danny was in some kind of fight, but no physical evidence of what started it.

I will not be returning to that field anytime soon.
