I hooked the mallet on another belt loop and slid the stake into my pocket. Then, I choked down the pain meds. The bitter aftertaste almost made me wretch. After unwrapping the chocolate bar, I took a bite but it turned to ash in my mouth. My appetite was nonexistent, and I felt weak and nauseated. I just wanted to go home to my bed and forget this ever happened. The thought of leaving right then and there entered my mind. It would only have taken me an hour or so to walk home.  



“Thomas!” Mr. Baumann called from the broken basement window. The chocolate bar fell to the ground when I jumped in fright. “Come down here, I want to show you something.”



The sick feeling in my stomach intensified at the thought of going back down there, but I obeyed and made my way back to the scene of the crime.



Mr. Baumann held up the man’s arm and said, “See?” The man had a swastika tattoo reminiscent of the armband Ulrich was wearing in the photo. Honestly, I didn’t think it was out of place for a homicidal maniac to have a Nazi tattoo, but Mr. Baumann seemed to think this was supporting evidence in defense of his monster story. I said nothing.



Mr. Baumann dropped the man’s arm and looked off towards the candle lights from further in the basement.



“Wait here,” he said as he made his way to that room of horrors. He took his time but when he walked out, he took off his hat and ran his hand through his hair. With a long exhale, he retrieved a pipe and book of matches from his coat.



The smell of the pipe smoke was actually an improvement over the smell of death that permeated the air. Mr. Baumann blew out a big gray cloud.



“I believe this servant of Ulrich’s was abducting live victims for his master to feed on. And when Ulrich was through with them, this foul creature would torture and dismember them. God rest their souls,” the old man said as he made the sign of the cross.



The torture and dismemberment was obvious, but once again none of it proved the existence of vampires or Ulrich. However, I didn’t have the strength to protest. 



“I truly am sorry Thomas. It was recklessly foolish of me to send you down here. I must admit in my old age and desperation, I have gotten sloppy,” he said, unable to look me in the eye. The old man took off his garland of garlic and moved towards me. “You will need all the protection you can get.”



I weakly submitted and allowed him to adorn me with the garlic talisman. I was starting to feel like a casualty caught up in the paranoid delusion of a demented old man. A tinge of anger or maybe even hatred bubbled up, but I let it go. I had to think straight for the both of us.



“Mr. Baumann, I really don’t think there are any vampires. We need to leave, sir. Please,” I pleaded.



“Well, since we are here we should have a look around. If you're right then there is nothing to worry about, and I will give you the rest of your payment,” he said.



I forgot about the money. I almost didn’t care about it anymore, but then the thought of how much trouble I just went through crossed my mind and I decided to take it. 



“Fine, but please let's just hurry. My mom is gonna freak out when she sees me covered in all of these bandages,” I said.



The steps groaned loudly as we made our way back upstairs. Mr. Baumann had me take one of the candles, and I used it to light the others as we went room to room.



“So, does vampire hunting pay well?” I asked, just trying to break the awkward silence.  



“My papa was a cobbler and he taught me the trade. He was also a jaeger, a hunter. Though, he didn't want to teach me that. One night, I followed him, and once I had seen the truth with my own eyes, there was no going back. He had to train me then,” Mr. Baumann said in a somber voice.

 

“The incredible, Mr. Baumann. Cobbler by day; vampire hunter by night.” I said snarkily.



“Americans don’t have any need for cobblers, so I worked in shoe factories. It was close enough,” he said playfully. 



We made our way into the front room of the house and Mr. Baumann walked up to a window. All of them had been boarded up from the inside.



“Give me a hand,” he said, and together we started prying the boards off. A thick, oppressive darkness clung to the window. Someone really had painted the windows black after all. “Does this not seem strange to you, Thomas?”



“Yeah it’s strange, but my first thought isn’t vampires,” I replied.

 

“Since when did you become the expert?” he said with a grin. I avoided his smile; I wasn’t in the mood for games. We split up after that, searching every room, and I continued to light the candles I came across. Even with all the candle light illuminating that wooden corpse, the house still did not feel right. Like something could jump out at you from every shadow.



To my relief, our search was seemingly fruitless. The rooms were covered in decades of dust, and all that remained in them was what was left of the old rotting furniture.



“Well, Mr. Baumann, that’s it there’s nothing more here, can we please just leave now?” I begged. But the old man paid me no mind as he shined a light up at the second floor ceiling. 



“Aha!” Mr. Baumann exclaimed as he hopped up and pulled on a string. A rickety old set of steps came tumbling down from the ceiling revealing a passage to the attic. A breeze that sent chills down my spine poured out and down the steps. Vampire or not, I got a really bad feeling about it. 



We made our ascent, and when we reached the top Mr. Baumann surveyed the room with his flashlight. Cobwebs as far as the eye could see, hanging from the rafters like banners on a castle. The cold air was unsettling too. We were in an uninsulated attic in the middle of summer. That room had no right being that cold. And I swear there was a light mist that gently obscured the floor. But nothing could have prepared me for what we found next.



Sitting upright against the far wall, was a coffin. My heart fell into my stomach. There’s no such thing as vampires; this couldn’t be real. Mr. Baumann made a shushing gesture and retrieved the stake from his coat. I did the same. We slowly and cautiously approached the vessel of evil.



The old man stood in front of the casket, and steadied his breathing. It wasn’t some cheap wooden box. Light slid across the coffin’s immaculately polished surface, revealing the intricate details of its craftsmanship. Runes and symbols I had never seen before peppered its surface. The air was still, and time seemed to slow down. Mr. Baumann moved his hand to grip the lid. He turned back to me and nodded. I stood as ready as I could be.



He flung the coffin open; the old man jumped back in surprise. He scanned it up and down with the light, then turned it to the other corners of the attic. There was nothing there.



Suddenly, there was movement in the rafters. The light shot upward, darting from beam to beam. 



“What do you see?” I asked, voice trembling as I looked over my shoulders.



Without warning, a flurry of black shapes, wings beating furiously, descended upon us. They flew in all directions, and some escaped down the steps. I grabbed my chest. My heart felt like it was ready to explode. Can 16 year olds even have heart attacks? Relief finally came as I watched the bats disappear back into the shadows.



“We must have missed something. He may have another lair,” the old man said. “Perhaps we can find a clue as to where it might be.” Mr. Baumann did not wait for me, he immediately set out back down the steps to continue his search. 



This old man has completely lost it. Another lair? As if one wasn’t preposterous enough? I can’t believe I allowed myself to be a part of his sick fantasy. I’m just going to ask Mr. Baumann to pay me and then I’m gone. 

 

BANG!



I jumped as the lid of the coffin closed by itself. I looked back and watched the flame of the candle dance on its reflective surface. A shiver ran down my spine. This is madness. Forget the money, I’m leaving.



As I made my way towards the steps, a bat flew past my head towards a corner of the attic. There was a dull thud. I held my candle out towards it, but the light did not reach. Inch by inch, I moved closer to the steps, afraid to run in fear of what I may provoke. For a moment I swore I heard breathing; deep and ominous breaths. Then, the floorboards started creaking; loud heavy footsteps crescendoed toward me, but still I saw nothing. The hair on my skin stood straight up, as if there was a charge in the air. And then I saw him. As if materializing out of thin air, he began rapidly manifesting. It was Ulrich. Or rather what Ulrich had become.



The once well groomed blonde hair was now long and silver, and gleamed like moonlight. His glowing eyes were almost indescribable; entirely inhuman. But they pierced right through me, and rooted my soul to the spot. I was paralyzed, and by more than just fear. The commanding presence of his attire was unreal. He looked like a spectre from the year 1945, and he carried with him a dull echo of the suffering of millions, whose lives are accounted for by numbers in a history book. His ghostly pale flesh split open with a hiss, revealing his razor sharp fangs.



He outstretched a clawed hand toward me, like he was casting a spell, and I felt this huge sense of pressure beating down on me, like the air itself was made of stone. My head bent forward; the garlic around my neck rotted instantly, sending black goo down my body. I wanted to scream but I could do nothing. I was like a fly caught in a web. 



Ulrich glided towards me, as if his feet never touched the ground. My neck fell into his hand effortlessly, and he raised me into the air. The candle and stake clattered on the ground below. His nostrils flared as he sniffed the air around me. Whatever he smelled, it did not make him happy. He hissed again and brought me to his eyes. His fury was incredible to behold, I could hear him yelling at me just with his glare.



BANG! BANG!



Foul black fluid splashed across my face, as something ripped through the side of Ulrich’s head. Mr. Baumann was standing on the steps with his hand pointed towards Ulrich. The barrel of his pistol quickly exhaled a thin wisp of smoke.



“Run, Thomas!” The old man shouted. Ulrich dropped me and I crashed to the floor, dust flying everywhere from the impact. Ulrich swayed, and stumbled backwards. I got to my feet and ran towards Mr. Baumann.



Together we raced down through the house, towards the exit. Candles flickered and died as we ran by them. Doors slammed and glass shattered. Nightmares can’t even compare to the horror we had uncovered, and should our feet fail us, we too would be extinguished. We reached the backdoor and Mr. Baumann ripped it open. Light poured into the room, but it was not the warm reception we had hoped for. Gone was the safety of the orange sun, and in its place was the pale moon that mocked us from the heavens, basking in our misfortune.



A deep and guttural sound cut through the nightsong of the insects, and took shape into malevolent laughter. Ulrich’s eyes burned in the shadows; moonlight glinting off his fangs. 



“Baumann! It has been too long!” The monster said joyfully. “My, look at how you have aged.”



“It is over Ulrich. You thought you had come for me, but it is I who has come for you!” Mr. Baumann roared. But Ulrich simply laughed.



“I assure you Baumann, I did not come here for you. It's a small world,” he said with an unnerving grin. “And while I have enjoyed our little reunion, please allow me now to reunite you with your father…in hell.” 



Mr. Baumann unloaded his pistol into the darkness. The muzzle flash illuminated the scene with each shot, but when the dust settled Ulrich was nowhere to be seen. My ears rang, as I started backing up towards the door.



Mr. Baumann's face twisted in pain. He gasped, as a claw exploded out the front of his right shoulder. He yelled in a way I’ve never heard a man yell before, or since. Ulrich materialized behind him, and bent his head down to the old man’s ear.



“But first, I will make you watch as I kill your apprentice. Like he killed my servant. Eye for an eye, Baumann,” Ulrich said with a laugh. He pulled his claw back through Mr. Baumann’s body and the old man crumpled to the floor.



Before I even had a chance to react, Ulrich was already upon me. Once again he lifted me into the air by my throat. The other hand held up to my face, as his nails extended into short blades.

He pressed one to my cheek and dragged it across my face. The sanguine drink wept from my wound onto his nail, and he wiped it against his tongue. I prayed for the first time in my life. I didn't know how to, or if I did it right. But if there was a devil, then there had to be a God too, right?



Ulrich drew back his claw, and slashed deep across my chest. He hissed and released me immediately. I fell backwards, and watched as the monster retreated clumsily into the shadows. His arms held up to shield his face. I looked down to see the crucifix swinging freely from my neck. Mr. Baumann got to his feet, and plucked the cross from me. 



“Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name,” Mr. Baumann recited with powerful conviction, as he held the crucifix before him. He advanced on Ulrich and the vampire hissed in agony, unable to bear the sight. His skin sizzled like bacon, but the smell was like burnt road kill. When Mr. Baumann had the creature cornered, he pulled out his stake. “Thy kingdom come, thy will be done!” Mr. Baumann raised the stake above his head, and brought his hand down with righteous retribution. 



But Ulrich parried the old man’s attack with his claw, nearly severing Mr. Baumann’s arm in two. Mr. Baumann cried out; his arm dangled at his side like a broken tree branch after a bad storm. The stake hit the ground, and rolled over to my foot.



“Thomas, you must finish it!” Mr. Baumann yelled as he continued to hold his ground against the abomination.



This scene plays in my mind over, and over again. Everyday since then I have thought about this moment. Thought about how I would do it differently. How I wish I could go back and change things. God forgive me. 



I got to my feet, and without hesitation, I ran. I ran right out the door, never looking back. You probably think I’m a worthless bastard, or some kind of monster. I agree. I hate myself for what I did. I could have saved Mr. Baumann and countless other lives. Well, this is what I did instead. 



“Thomas!” I could hear the old man calling as I rounded the corner to the front of the house. I don’t think I have ever run faster in my life. I ran in the street clinging to the safety of the street lights, as if they would somehow protect me. The suburb was like a maze. Every street looked the same, and it felt as if I was running for hours before I finally found the main road.



As I ran to the police station, I swear I could hear the beating of large leathery wings. Shadows stalked the skies above me, and every dog in the vicinity howled into the night. Dear God, what have I done? It was as if I had let loose the floodgates of hell. Please forgive me, Mr. Baumann. 



Before I could even walk into the station, one of the Officers stopped me outside.



“Whoa, whoa, whoa, what’s goin’ on?” he demanded.



“Please my friend is in danger, he’s being attacked!” I yelled with what little strength I had left.



“Where?” he asked, cutting right to the point.



“I don’t…I don't know the address!” I said panickedly.



“Can you lead me there?” he asked. I agreed to guide him back to the mansion of mayhem, and we hopped in his car. Lights flashing and siren blaring, we were there in just a few short minutes. I could see other emergency vehicle lights before we rounded the corner, and then I saw why. The building was set ablaze, like a cathedral from hell. I’ve never seen something burn so violently and rapidly. I’m not sure how we didn’t see the smoke on our way there, perhaps some of Ulrich’s sorcery, but it bloomed above the building as a massive dark cloud.

 

The cop and I exited the vehicle. Almost everyone in the neighborhood was outside, bathrobes and all. I was getting a lot of weird looks. A punk kid covered in blood and bandages, standing with a cop, outside of a burning building. Not the best look. The cop must have got a similar idea because he turned to me and demanded I tell him “what’s goin’ on”. And so I did.



I told my story over and over that night, and a few times after. But I’m getting ahead of myself. First, I was taken to the hospital and my parents were called. You would have thought I was dead, by how hysterical my mom was acting. The cop, regretfully, mentioned “we believe there may have been some murders” on the phone to my mom. She didn’t take it well.



I told the detectives about the man I killed and they kept saying “he may not have been dead” or “it was obviously in self defense”. Either way, I still felt guilty, but they didn’t seem to care. I told them the honest truth about everything. They were very patient, but they would give each other looks from time to time, and I started to realize they thought I was twacked out. They asked if I would mind doing a drug test, asked if anyone in my family had a history of mental health issues, etc. 



They believed Mr. Baumann was a “crazy old man” who paid me to go along with his delusion, and we happened to “stumble upon some trouble”. I defended myself from a “crazy-eyed vagrant”, but his “homeless veteran friend” attacked Mr. Baumann. They likely burned down the house in an attempt to “dispose of any incriminating evidence”. At least that was the story, until they discovered all of the burnt up human remains several hours later. Then the FBI was called.



They found body parts from roughly 30 victims, but Mr. Baumann was the only body to be identified. It didn't take long for the town to become a media circus, making national news. We had journalists and news vans camped outside our house for weeks. It was almost impossible to leave. The day the FBI searched Mr. Baumann’s house, an agent came to talk to my parents. He introduced himself as I hid around the corner. 



“So, we’re still going through everything right now, but we don’t think this Mr. Baumann was anything other than a religious fanatic. From some of his writing we found he seems to really think he was some kind of monster hunter. Which is good, because it aligns with what your boy has told us,” he said.



“How is that a good thing?” my mother asked incredulously. 



“Because it means we have no further questions for him, and you guys can start the healing process,” he said with a gentle smile.



“What about the part…you know…about how he said he killed someone,” she asked in a low voice. 



“I’ve seen his defensive wounds ma’am, he did what he had to. Plus with the conditions of the bodies we found, it's gonna be hard to determine who died of a stab wound. Your boy is lucky to be alive. Not many people survive serial killers,” he said.



“So that’s it? No leads or anything?” she asked irritatedly.



“Well ma’am, this is far from over. Investigations take time, but I promise you we’re gonna do everything we can to get this guy, and any of his friends. Do you want my advice ma’am? Leave town. Move to a big city where you can get lost in all the noise, and never come back. Maybe take your son to a therapist too. You don’t want him internalizing all that trauma,” he said.



And so we moved. I saw a therapist, pretty regularly. She was a nice lady I suppose, but there was no way I could convince her about what truly happened that night. Eventually, I just learned to pretend that I made it all up because my mind couldn’t handle the reality of the situation. Boy, I wish that was true. Even my mother made me promise I would tell people I was “attacked by a serial killer” if it came up.



Mentioning the vampire made me sound “nutty”. So I never spoke of it again, until now that is. I feel absolutely terrible about this, but I lied to my wife too. Once we moved in together it was harder to hide my quirks. I had a list of rules, and there was no negotiating them. Among many other rules, there was no answering the door unless I had approved the person (especially at night), no inviting anyone in without my approval, no leaving the house at night, and no revealing our address to anyone. Our relationship almost didn’t make it because she thought I was a really controlling boyfriend, but then I broke down and told her I was “attacked by a serial killer”. 



I wish I could have told her the truth. I wanted to share it with her so bad, so I didn’t have to deal with it alone. But I couldn’t do that to her. It’s like what Mr. Baumann said, “once you know the truth there is no going back.” Or something like that.



My kids grew up with these rules, among others, so they have adapted well to my weirdness. I really have a great family, that’s why it pains me to keep the truth from them. But I’m gonna fix it. For a while, things were as normal as they could be; life was pretty good. I was paranoid as hell but it was always false alarms. Stuff I could laugh off later. A car that was behind me for too many turns, or a mystery caller with the wrong number. Stuff like that. Until he found me. 



I was helping my son get ready for school one morning; he must have been only 8 at the time. His room was a mess, unsurprisingly, and we were on a scavenger hunt for his socks. He was always a happy light hearted kid, which made it even more unnerving when he hit me with this.



“Dad, do you get scared at night?” he asked. The question caught me off guard.



“Well…I suppose so. You know, sometimes. But there’s really nothing to be afraid of,” I said.



“Is that why we’re not allowed to leave at night?” he asked inquisitively. I figured he’d ask about all the rules eventually. But I still didn’t really know the best way to handle it. 



“Well, why do you want to leave the house at night anyway?” I asked with a smile. Doing my best to deflect his question. 



“My friends say it's weird. That we’re weird,” he said quietly. I walked over to him and put my hand on his shoulder.



“I’m sorry buddy. I know it all seems weird now, but you’ll understand when you’re older. You just have to trust me for now.” I said.



“Dad…I get scared at night too,” he said in a haunting tone.



“Why buddy?” I asked.



“Because of the man with the big teeth.” he said in almost a whisper. I sat down hard onto his bed. There’s no way. After all these years, it couldn't be. I think for a time, I even believed I made it all up. 



“What…what do you mean?” I asked, trying to compose myself.



“At night, the man with big teeth stands outside under the streetlight and waves at me. And sometimes…sometimes he’s right outside my window.” He said almost in tears. My son’s room was on the second floor. I got goosebumps, and stood up. My head was swimming. I could barely think straight. 



“When was the last time you saw the man,” I demanded.



“A few nights ago, I think,” he said as the tears now began to flow freely. Either some creep has been stalking my son or…or Ulrich has found me.



“Why didn’t you tell me sooner!” I almost shouted.



“I don’t know,” he said each word between big sobs.



“Shhh, it’s ok. I’m not gonna let anything hurt you, buddy,” I said, wrapping him up in my arms.



“I drew a picture of him,” he hiccuped, as he broke free to rummage around his room. He grabbed a drawing and brought it to me. Time froze and I was transported back to that house all of those years ago. Reliving each second of it in my mind. It was Ulrich. There was no mistaking it. He was real and he found me. And nobody was going to believe me.



I really couldn’t afford it but I had to move and get my family out of there. They were pissed and confused, naturally. My wife even threatened to leave me, but when I told her a man was stalking our son she started to come around.



We moved to the other side of the country. I figured the further we moved the longer it would take him to find me. I knew he would never stop. Time must be meaningless to an immortal like him. Chasing me for the rest of my life would just be a fun little distraction for him. Something to kill a few decades, then he could move on to something else.



He had no real reason to come after me, other than the sport of it. A sick game. Virtually no one knew he existed so why not torment the one person who does know? But it's not me I was worried about this time. Ulrich knew what he was doing. He was sending a message. The Bat is back in town, and he has a score to settle. And he was going to come after me by any means, including going after my children.



That was ten years ago. Ten years of looking over my shoulder and jumping at the sight of my own shadow. Peace of mind has been a rare commodity for me lately. I only ever truly feel safe at church. Whether I’m paying attention to the sermon or not, I know that’s the one place he won’t dare go. I became more active in the church because of it. And that meant my family did too. It was a great distraction, while it lasted.



Earlier this week, I was volunteering at the vacation Bible School program we do every summer. The little kids spend the whole day learning about Jesus, playing games, and eating snacks. While the older kids, like my son, help out coordinating the activities. It's kind of like summer camp, but it's at our church and everyone goes home at the end of the day.



My son and I were overseeing a water balloon fight, which was supposed to be a reenactment of the battle of Jericho. We had the kids blow a cheap toy horn, then my son knocked down a “wall” made of cardboard, revealing more kids behind it, and the two sides opened fire upon each other. My son was caught right in the middle of the bombardment. This was one of those stupid little distractions that I lived for. Wholesome time with my family at church. What could go wrong?             



During all the chaos, I heard the chugging of an old engine, followed by the screeching of tires. A disgusting rust bucket, formerly known as a van, pulled up in front of my church. It had “murder van” written all over it. I started to feel uneasy. As I made my way to the side entrance of the church, I heard a door slam and the car peel out. My feet felt like they were made of lead, and every step thundered in my mind. When I got inside, I found Greg at the front holding a box. Greg is an overly enthusiastic church member. He’s really bad at reading the room. 



“Hey, Tommy, perfect timing!” Greg said cheerfully. “A gentleman showed up here, asking about you. When I went to go find you, he just dropped this package on the floor and left. I probably shouldn’t say this but he looked kinda spooky.” 



I took the box from Greg without saying a word. There wasn’t anything on it, no address, nothing. I shook the box, it was pretty light and something bounced around inside. I removed the tape and pulled out a black envelope. Its contents fell onto the table. A little iron figure of Christ. It still had some of the burnt wooden cross attached to it. This was Mr. Baumann’s crucifix. Or what was left of it. 



“Oh, that’s so neat!” Greg said with a dumb smile on his face. He picked up the figure and started rubbing the soot off of it with his shirt. 



I wanted to collapse on the spot. Greg droned on about something, and I left reality. The walls of my mind came closing in. I couldn’t restart my life again. I can’t. My kids would never forgive me. My life, everything I’ve built up for over a decade is here. I’ve been running my whole life. I just want peace. 



I’ve barely slept since that day. I haven’t even gone to work. Thank God for PTO. I’ve spent the last several days researching vampires, and looking for other people online who have had encounters. I’ve been to many forum sites. It's mainly been a lot of wackos and people into roleplaying, but I have made up my mind.



I’m not going to run anymore. Ulrich isn’t going to stop until one of us is dead. So I’m going to confront him. We all wage war with our pasts, but tonight I’m going to finish it. For Mr. Baumann. For Mr. Baumann’s father. And most importantly, for the sake of my family. I may be a worthless pathetic human, but I will do anything for them. Even slay a vampire. Or die trying.



I sawed off the leg of an old wooden chair and fashioned it into a stake. I’ve been practicing on a makeshift dummy made of pillows in my garage. The first few stabs I missed completely. Not a great start. It took me ten more tries to actually stab the stake through the pillow. When my wife caught me I just told her I was “practicing self defense.” To which she asked, “With a chair leg?” I replied with, “Anything can be a weapon.” She left without saying anything else.



I used what remained of the chair to make a new crucifix, and I attached Mr. Baumann’s little iron figure of Christ to it. It wasn’t as well crafted as Mr. Baumann’s crucifix. Far from it. But it felt right. I went to a Catholic church to have a priest bless the cross. He seemed a bit confused, and I didn’t help the situation. At first I tried making up some bogus story that it was meant as a gift, and he reassured me that it wasn’t necessary for a priest to bless it. So, I told him I’m actually a vampire hunter and I “need all the help I can get.” He stared at me like I was crazy, then quietly prayed over the cross. I joined him. He sprinkled some holy water on it for some added effect and wished me luck.



Greg is a really nice guy, if not a little annoying, but he really came through for me today. He works at the DMV, and using the camera footage from the church, he looked up the “murder van’s” plate number. He found an address only 15 minutes away. I went to go check it out after leaving the church, and what I found was an all too familiar scene. Technically, it wasn’t an abandoned building this time. But it sure as hell looked like a “vampire’s lair”. You know what I mean, Addams Family looking haunted house. And the windows were completely blacked out. Ulrich should really learn subtlety.



When I got home, I ate dinner with my family. My last meal, maybe. It was just meatloaf but it was the best damn meatloaf I’ve ever had. I told my wife how great it was, and she rewarded me with a kiss. My family swapped stories about their day, and I listened to every single detail of the mundane lives of my teenagers. I enjoyed every second of it. I wish I had spent more time listening to them. More time doing what I wanted to do with them, instead of living in fear of my mistakes. My failure.      



I still couldn’t bring myself to tell them the truth. And my heart breaks knowing this may be the last time they see me, or I them. I write this now because I need someone to know. It's been burning in me for years, and if I die tonight so does this story. Mr. Baumann deserves more than the fate I left him to, and now people will know how bravely he fought at the end. 



Part of me hopes maybe my family might find this, and it might help them to make sense of everything. If you see this, I’m sorry. And I love you so much. I’ve made a lot of mistakes, but my family was not one of them. If I make it, and Ulrich is defeated, I’ll post my update here. Take care and don’t be fooled, monsters walk among us.
