The incident I'm about to describe happened November 7th 2013. Enjoy my recurring nightmare. I have pictures if anyone is intrested

My father Ryan Williams was hit and killed by semi after a mechanical failure caused his inability to come to stop before the car crossed the highway. That was in April of 1995. Flash forward 2 months, and I was born. A fatherless son, to a scared teenage mother.

When i was 9 my mother met my step dad (who was a major prick then but were good now) and moved to where he was raised. This part begins 12 years ago when I was right about to start my senior year of high school (fall of 2012). I went to a small school in the middle of kansas the type of area where literally the GPS doesn't work on most roads. My family lived on a farm, over a mile from the closest neighbors.

 We didn't have crops ourselves only my Uncle does the farming side since grandpa Mike passed on Halloween 2004 (freak accident he got trapped under the hydraulic bed of a grain truck and subsequently got crushed). My step dad moved his business (he's fixes welders and generators) to a shop that he had built in the backyard. The same dirt mound grandpa passed away moving was were the shop now sits, not important just really cool to me. I didn't have a ton of friends due to  social issues, but I did have a plan.

 In order to try to live up to my real dad's name, I enlisted in the army pulling MOS 11 X-Ray op 40 after scoring a 92 on the ASVAB. I'm not sure if that means the same but then it was Infantry with ranger option. I went to Kansas City, did all the physicals, signed a plethora of paperwork, and got swore in. My parents were extremely happy with me for what seemed like the first time in my life. I hit the weight room like crazy to help prepare (I had ran cross country for 3 years but wanted to make sure I was strong as well) I starting playing football (love of the game, hated most of the team though but feelings were definitely mutual). One day at practice, before the first game even, we we're doing Oklahoma drills. My blocker missed his assignment, and I got absolutely rocked by the 2 free defenders (I played fullback/tightend on offense, and corner/ outside linebacker on defense). In fact, I was rocked so hard I couldn't get up right away. Turns out I had gotten high low'd at full speed by 2 guys that were much larger than I (that's where your legs get taken out one way and your top half gets taken the other). I was then made fun of by my teammates, coaches, all who saw and limped my way back to the locker room dealing with the worst pain in my hips I've ever felt, simultaneously wearing the badge again as the weird kid that just couldn't do what the guys did, the outcast who never fit in. 

Jokes on them, because my mom's a nurse and immediately knew it was worse than just a hard hit. I had an MRI the following day to reveal I was born with (or developed at a young age I guess) femoral atibular impingement in both hips (my femur on both sides has flat spots instead of a round head) which caused both hips to have partially popped from their sockets. It didn't take  long to recieve the news that my freshly started football career was over, so much love for a game I would never get to taste. When my recruiter from the Army had heard the news, he absolutely shattered what had been my lifelong goal, I was no longer eligible for enlistment, said that I wouldn't be "able to carry my duties up to my previous potential, let alone uphold their standard" via text message at that. 

No more  football, no more army. I knew wasn't going to get into college the traditional way, my GPA was below par due to me just not doing homework, no one's fault but my own. However I passed every test, so I continued to be moved along. Upon realizing that I had nothing to continue school for, my principal (Mr. Goodheart, I will always miss/love that man for everything he did for me) suggested I get my GED. He called my mother, and made arrangements for me to take the test, even coming out to the farm to drive me there himself. I took the practice exam and missed 1, so I didn't have to take classes or anything. the official test was just a few days later. Again I missed 1, to this day I wish I knew what it was. Turns out that kind of score gets you 1 semester free at the local community College. My mother could be proud again, I technically had a graduation and was going to go to college. I figured since I wanted to be in the army so badly, I would take law enforcement as a career path. 

Knowing that I was never wanting to just be "another cop" I decided to take psychology as well. High hoping to beome a dectective, then possibly a profiler for larger more heinous crimes. Things for a couple months seemed pretty awesome. Then I met a girl named (let's say Ann) Ann and I worked together at a restaurant waiting tables, I had never been good with girls due to the whole exile the weirdo kid thing (it's whatever now, I get it) so I was super nervous when I finally got the courage to ask her out. You couldn't believe my joy inside when she smiled and said yes! 

We went out, got dinner, walked around a lake that was in town, just talking. We decided we wanted to watch the conjuring (it just came out on DVD) so we went to Walmart to buy it. After making the purchase we ran into some of her friends, who she stopped to chat with. One of them accidentally let slip that Ann was indeed pregnant with a previous flings baby, like maybe 6 weeks, pretty early. She looked at me with sorrowful eyes and said she understood if I wanted to drop her off and forget about it. However, as a guy on my first real date I told her it didn't bother me really, as long I didn't have to worry about the other guy trying to kill me, she assured me it was fine and the date continued. We went back to her dorm room, where we watched the conjuring, talked about everything we saw in the future, cuddled (that's literally it perverts), and eventually we fell asleep. 

I awoke Saturday morning in a panic, I looked at my phone, and saw I was going to be late for work. I had to drive back to my parents (which was about 30 minutes north) to get my works clothes and shower. Everything felt awesome, I finally had direction, a plan, it was all falling into place. That was, until I went to cross the main highway 3 miles south of where my parents lived.

 I don't remember coming to the intersection at all, but according to the police report I had pulled my 1992 buick century across the highway at 20 mph after briefly stopping at the sign. I must not have seen the fully loaded pick up, complete with grill guard, and a cattle trailer with 3 bovine passengers moving at approximately 70mph. The only thing I remember was right after, I took my seat belt off leaving my bloody thumbprint on the button, but didn't have the strength to get the door open. I thought "just get out the window" as they had all been shattered, and made my move across the seats. No quicker than my initial move, I got extremely dizzy and lost conscience sprawled out across the bench, reaching toward the broken passenger window. 

 
Everything was an instant shade of black, darker than then when you're in a cave with no light. It felt like swimming in water that I couldn't see, feel, or even hear. Inside of a vast nothingness that seemingly had no end, I was stripped of my senses. I couldn't remember exactly how I got there, but I knew inside my soul by the growing, nauseating pain of realization that I had died.

At first, pure disbelief washed over me. I was just there, how could I have died? Not even ten minutes ago I had the window down, music up, the November sun on my skin, and the cool fall breeze whipping through my freshly gelled hair. That's when I remembered taking my seatbelt off and attempting my escape from that tomb of twisted metal and glass. I was then angry, angry at myself for letting us die, angry at world for it's abhorrent unfairness, and angry at whoever hit me. (I know the report says I rolled through the stop sign, but it's never sat right with me for 4 reasons.)
 
1.i learned how to drive on that very road, my parents always preached extreme caution when it came to that highway. 

2. It's not necessarily a "blind" crossing but it is on an incline right after a dip if you look to the west where the oncoming truck was coming from 

3. I never wanted to die just like my father had, I absolutely used what little maturity i had when i was behind the wheel out of fear of sharing the fate of the man i had never gotten to me. 

4. The report also stated i wasn't wearing a seat belt, which would be completely implausible thanks to my one memory and a bloody thumbprint.) 

Sorry back to the abyss, I tried to wrap my mind around this revelation, thinking about all i had left behind, realizing I would never get the chance to finally make my parents,  and family proud. Grief had started to replace the anger, my insides no longer felt the trembling rage of my teenage angst. Instead the trembling slowled turned into static nothingness, growing into an overwhelming sensation of the life that i had wasted. I went to wipe the tears from eyes when i figured out i couldn't feel my face, at this same moment i did feel something though. It was the feeling of the equivalent to a baseball bat to back of my skull, i focused on the pain, and felt it again, this time accompaniedby a sound. BOOM! The first thing i had heard since the song that was playing at the intersection.

 (ironically it was seether's aptly titled "Fine Again" , I'll always hold that song closer to me than anyone else, wish I could tell Shaun Morgan this story. And before you ask I learned what song was playing because after we removed the head unit the CD was stuck in it, I put into a diffent car and it wouldn't stop skipping on the part where he says "and I'm not scared now, i must assure you, you're never gonna get away" instant goosebumps the moment the speakers crackled out the words, just thought you would enjoy that tidbit, this is the first time I've written this and I'm breaking up the memory with a fun fact so I can breathe again.)

BOOM! A third time! In words that will probably only make sense to myself, I swam upwards toward the thunderous sound until I saw a pinhole of light. The smallest light in an existence of blackened shadow was the brightest I had ever seen. I fought as hard as I could towards it, willing the body I couldn't feel towards my beacon in the sky. As I got closer the percusssionary sound was joined in by a metallic clicking that I could not place. BOOM! CLINK CLINK! What could that be, I thought as more pain erupted from back of head. I pressed onward through the stream of confusion, and relentless waves of pain. I kicked the feet I couldn't feel, and reached out with arms I couldn't see, not knowing what else to do I prayed to God. Just let me see the source behind this light, I have to know what that sound is, please. I got closer, like looking into a peephole, and that's when i took one final empty breath, thanked God for hopefully answered prayers, and plunged myself from the abyss of shattered dreams, and a life cut short, into the speck of light.

I bolted straight up, gasping for the oxygen I just been so desperate the feel. With the air rushing rushing into me, so did the gravity of the situation, accompanied by the symphony of pain erupting in a crescendo from seemingly every part of the Orchestra that was my body. At first I thought I only managed to pull myself from that abysmal purgatory, and into waiting arms of Satan himself. His many hands wrapped around me, forcing me back down. I screamed from the pain, the sound resonating from inside of me bared a similarity of someone figuring out how to use their voice for the first time. I screamed until my throat cracked, ending in a raspy  blood speckled cough. my final battle cry before facing Lucifer, and his band of demons, I turned to face the composer of my eternal torment. 

It wasn't an evil teifling, who's jealousy and pride landed him the role of King of Hell, there wasn't a band of demons ready commit atrocities at their front man's will. It was a very suprised doctor, and a group of wonderful nurses. The light that I had seen, was not a peephole set alight by the fires of what could've been. It was the surgical light above the operating table. "What's going on, what happened" I choked out as they laid me back down. "You've been in an accident, you're in the hospital, a lot of people didn't think you'd make it" 

I immediately asked the question that was burning inside of me. "What's the boom click sound?" "You have a pretty significant crack on the back of your head, we need to put more staples in" I have no idea how those capeless heros are able to immediately stay calm and do their lifesaving work when half gone college kids bolt up from dead but they will always have my gratitude. "What happened to me?" I repeated trying to understand the current circumstance. "You were hit by a truck crossing a highway and they airlifted you here son" to this day, I apologize to the people I owe my life to for the only response I said before losing consciousness again. "But I can't die, not like that. That's how my dad died" and I was out.....

Almost 11 years later, I'm still here. I'm married, with 4 kids and a permanent limp. Funny enough, the people hit me did not have valid paperwork, and were never seen again after they left the hospital. The driver had a sore neck, and other a broken arm, unfortunately 2 of the beef gods in the back lost their lives and for that I am sorry. I'm as good as what I'll ever get with it, I've come a long ways. I always have the scars from where the glass ripped through arm, shoulder, from where the doctor's had to insert a chest tube to drain the fluids from my lung (fun fact, it really hurts when a meaningful but absent minded nurse kicks the drainage box over and pops the stich, pulling the tubing out 6 inches from your chest cavity like an angry, girthy, spaghetti)

However, I don't think my head has healed quite right at night it comes back with a memory, or a dream where I'm trapped there again but this time I can't get into the peephole. Then when I finally do I just bolt awake and have to go the rest of the day acting like I'm fine but other than that it's pretty cool with me now. Just wish i didn't relive it every night.
