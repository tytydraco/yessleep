It was just a rock.

Yes, it came from space.

But still, just a rock about the size of a bowling ball.

Oh, but it wasn't the rock they cared about.

More like what was on it.

The first discovery of extraterrestrial life caught the attention of everyone around the world.

A single-celled organism.

One like they'd never seen before.

It fell in our neighbors field on the outskirts of town. I remember the loud crash that woke me up in the middle of the night and I looked out my window to see glowing lights that looked like pictures of the aurora borealis I had seen. 

My little brother stirred in the bed opposite mine, frightened by the noise, and I went to him, comforting him back to bed. When I was certain that he was asleep once more, I got dressed and snuck my way down the stairs, making sure not to make a sound. 

I had made it down the steps quietly until I reached the last step. 

It groaned beneath my weight piercing the night's silence. In the moment it had seemed deafeningly loud as my heart pulsed in my ears rhythmically. 

Thump. Thump.

Thump. Thump.

Thump. Thump.

I was standing frozen, afraid of the punishment I'd receive for trying to sneak out so late. 

When I heard my father's hitching snore reach my ears once more.

Relieved, I tiptoed over to the door and slipped on my shoes.

The night was cool, as the cold wind blew through my clothes riddling me in goosebumps.

I walked into my neighbour's field over a little hill and down into a natural dip in the land. There was a craterous hole at the bottom and the light was emanating from within. I walked up to it and saw a meteorite. 

Strange flowers grew around it, black and glimmering like onyx but soft to the touch like felt. 

I heard an animal softly whimper and looked up to see a raccoon. Its molten skin matted in its fur grotesquely. Appendages were growing out of its side. They were almost insect-like or at least that's the closest thing I could compare them to. It was like nothing I'd seen before.

I ran back home afraid I'd be blamed for what happened to that raccoon, afraid of being punished for sneaking out.

The next morning my neighbor woke up and found the meteorite. He called in the local authorities, but before they came, my family and I went over to investigate what was going on. I acted oblivious to what was happening, but when we made it over there, I genuinely didn't have a clue as to what was going on anymore.

A baffling jungle of unrecognizable plants and trees had grown around the crater overnight.

Twisting trees that wound around themselves colored navy blue and magenta. Wild flowers grew everywhere. It was like nothing I'd seen before. It all had a shimmering quality to it like oil in water.

The police had been just as baffled. One officer took his cap off in astonishment, scratching his scalp. His partner turned and called something I didn't hear into his radio.

News spread quickly and a crowd was rapidly forming. The officers were trying their best to hold everyone back behind the makeshift perimeter they had set up. Reporters were shoving their way to the officers, trying their best to get any information they could get their hands on.

Not even within an hour of the police being present the military showed up. The site was evacuated and completely closed off. They blocked off all the roads leading out of town and enforced a lockdown until further notice.

The next morning, when I looked out my window, they had installed a dome over the crater and a makeshift lab near it. I went into town with my Dad for groceries, and it was clear people had been put on edge by the sudden lockdown and military presence. I overheard some people talking about all the missing pets lately.

My mom made stew that night. I still remember how delicious it was. How I miss that stew. My brother was eating beside me, shovelling every morsel into his mouth at rapid speed, sending bits flying everywhere. I got a chunk of beef to the forehead and graciously threw one back at him.

“Watch it you two.” My father announced in a serious tone 

“Cause that means war.” He looked so happy as he threw chunks of beef at us. My mother was quick to scold all three of us. She wasn't angry despite her trying to seem like it and they both smiled.

Their smiles, their happiness and warmth. 

I think that's what I miss most about them. 

God, I had no clue how lucky I was.

We heard a loud wooshing sound. An orange hue began to glow outside filling the night air. My parents rushed to the window as my brother and I followed them. The strange plants that surrounded the crater filled our neighbors field. Men in hazard suits were burning them down with flame throwers.

“It's probably some invasive species they're trying to contain.” He theorized although uncertainty filled his voice. 

In that moment everything changed for us. This thing rushed out of my neighbor's house. There was a human body in there although I don't think it could be considered human any longer. It was an amalgamation of multiple different parts, none of which were of earth in origin. His eyes were extended from his head like a snail's. Appendages protruded from his mouth that looked like insect mandibles. They stretched his mouth open unnaturally. He crawled on eight legs like an arachnid. He had a tail like a scorpion although this one was made of flesh. His body was covered in something resembling green moss, and beneath it, I could see that it was adorned in a flexible carapace.

It jumped onto the first soldier as the other lit them both ablaze. Although I don't think it affected it in the slightest, as it then attacked the soldier who had set him on fire. It stabbed its mandibles into his head, holding it in place as an appendage protruded from the thing's mouth and into the soldier's eye socket.

It drained the man's head of its contents, reducing it into a shrivelled husk.

My father pulled my brother and me to the basement in a frightened hurry. We stayed down there all night listening to the gunshots and screams. Huddled in the corner as the orange hue of fire outside came in through the small basement window.

When we awoke to sun cresting over the hills the world had gone silent once more. My Father was the first to leave when he confirmed it was clear we joined him outside. Everywhere I could see the land was burned. Black and Grey. Soot and ash. Bodies were everywhere. Men and women, soldiers and scientists. Torn apart by an abominable force they had wrought upon themselves when they had foolishly attempted to control it.

My Father led us to his old, beat-up square-body, and we headed to my Aunt's place in town. When we got just outside of town there was a military blockade. 

It stood there completely abandoned. Not a soul in sight.

We moved past the blockade and were greeted by the aftermath of chaos. The air was heavy with the smell of burning meat and hair. Shattered storefronts, broken windows and walls, cars overturned, blood pooled in the streets.

It was as though in the middle of the night hell had broken loose in the small town.

My aunt met us in front of her house, before she quickly hurried us inside. As we unpacked our things, my brother let out a sigh of despair as a tear ran down his cheek. I asked him what was wrong, and he told me how he forgot his favourite little teddy at home.

I promised him I'd get it back for him.

That night, while everyone slept, I snuck out and hopped onto my bicycle, heading back home, fueled by my stupidity, unable to fully comprehend the gravity of the danger I was putting myself in.

As I grew near to my house I began to see them, vaguely painted against the starry night sky. 

Large spiralling towers like termite hills. There were three or four of them.

The surrounding area had completely changed now adorned in the stranger flora that was once exclusive to the crater. I found my house covered in abnormal vines that looked as though they'd been carved from jade.

I retrieved my brother's teddy bear without any problems, but as I left my house, I heard a noise coming from deep within the unusual thicket. My curiosity was piqued, and against my better judgment, I went to investigate.

I found the old research lab amidst the wild bramble. Completely overgrown, its sides were torn open, dried blood painted the interior walls in a brown, copper-smelling muck. I heard it again, a low growling. I looked for the origins of the noise and found it. 

Cats, Dogs fused into an ungodly mass, spider-like appendages shot out of its tumorous body. A cat's head was at the helm of the mass, thousands of little black eyes dotted its face. 

It leaped down at me from the ceiling. Charging towards me at a rapid speed. The exit door hung loosely in its frame. I scrambled to get through crawling under the hanging door. Moments later the beast slammed into the door and wall, bending it inwards. I ran to my bicycle as I heard it break through.

I could hear it getting closer and closer as I peddled as fast as I could. I heard it right behind me, I swear I felt its breath on my back. I peddled harder as I put more and more distance between me and that thing.

I snuck back into town through a hole in the fence. I got to my Aunt's only to find the place empty. I looked everywhere for my parents 

And I finally found them.

They were standing before a pit, fire danced deep within it. The air was thick with that smell again. 

The smell of burning meat and hair.

The remaining soldiers, desperate to avoid another attack, dragged everyone out of their homes in the middle of the night and tested them for the organism. 

My baby brother tested positive, along with my Aunt.

They were both shot on the spot. 

Their bodies were thrown carelessly into the burn pit.

My mother was on her knees before the pit, an awful, wailing song emerged from the depths of her soul as she was held by her husband. 

Her shirt was caked in the blood of her son as little flowers grew from his blood.

Black like onyx.

Soft like felt.

I never got to say goodbye to him or my mother, never got to tell them how I loved them. I'd give anything to hold them again. To have them look at me the way he used to, like I was their whole world. 

The next morning I found my Father sobbing. Unable to take the death of her Son, my Mother took her own life.

It was over and I’d never see them again.

We left town not long after and we've been walking since.

We've seen entire cities turned to ruin.

Millions of lives lost.

We never looked back.

Forwards always forwards.

As I finished speaking, the fire’s reflection danced against the Russian's face as his eyes bore into me. It was cold, as the wind whistled by shifting the flames. My father and I had walked until we'd reached somewhere perpetually cold in the hopes that it would stop the scourge of mankind and so far it had worked. We'd been here for months without any trace of the scourge when the Russian and his Gimp had shown up one day. As they sat across from me now, the Russian in his neat military uniform adorned in gold medals, a false crown sat atop his head made of the strange bramble found in the scourge's flora. The Gimp was the opposite, dressed in tattered rags, a filthy man whose gaunt face was caked in grime. The Russian spoke beginning his tale of how he'd ended up here.

The Russian and The Gimp's Tale

“Your leaders underestimated the scourge. They were vain and thought themselves powerful enough to harness it. That is where they failed, they allowed it to spread and when they failed to contain it, your people turned against them. Your governments fell to the scourge. Your cities were swallowed by it. There was a power vacuum and my country sought to retake your land, to bring it under our glory. We dropped everything we had against the scourge, along with other countries. 

Bomb after bomb dropped.

 We thought our efforts were successful and we began our conquest.

I remember when we flew over. It stretched over the land as far as we could see. Tall spiraling towers and dense forests of plants like I'd never seen before. 

We thought of ourselves like the first cosmonauts in space, great men conquering a far off land.

We were dropped into the heart of it. We saw beings which had once been human corrupted by scourge into hell spawn. They killed so many of us. 

A week after we'd first settled into enemy territory, we received the last transmission for our home country.

The scourge had risen from the ocean, 

there was no hope,

They lost.

It's been silent since. 

I became king of this land, my men became my people and we took many more along the way. This man was one of them.” He announced at once grabbing the back of the Gimp's neck.

“I ruled over them, rationed the food they caught. They did as I told them or my men shot them. I killed all those who opposed me. Then the scourge came for me too, it killed all those I ruled over and left me nothing but this useless fuck.

You see, I might have been king but that thing is God.”

The Russian fell silent, as he finished the scraps of food we shared and it wasn't long before we went to sleep.

I woke as my father stirred beside me, I opened my eyes and saw the Russian on top of my father. 

He'd stabbed my Father in the neck. 

Blood pooled beneath him staining the snow crimson.

I stood up in a hurry and was promptly greeted by the man's knuckles.

I felt my nose crack and cave in as I fell back down to my knees. I saw the Gimp cowering in the shadows before the Russian struck me once more. 

He kept going as everything around me faded out.

In the morning I awoke to the biting cold and sun in my face. I looked upon my Fathers corpse, too worn down to grieve.

The man had died a long time ago alongside his wife and child. 

He'd been given a rare commodity. In the land of the starving and changed, a quick and painless death was an uncommon mercy.

The Russian had burned down our shack, taken all the food my father had been keeping in his backpack of which he'd used as a pillow and I was left hopelessly stranded in the tundra.

I have nowhere to run. The scourge is approaching. I see its spiralling towers in the distance.

I'm too tired to fight any longer.

I've seen death beyond anything imaginable.

Countless lives lost to a being that could not grieve their memories.

I do not grieve my death, I only hope to relive the memories of my family. 

I've kept my brothers teddy and I will hold my promise true.

I've written my story. This piece of me which will remain when I am gone will be the proof that I was here.

That I existed.

We were doomed the day it fell to earth.

In the end.

We hoped.

We suffered.

We lost.

The day everything changed.
