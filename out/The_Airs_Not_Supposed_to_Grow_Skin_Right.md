It all began with a tingling, like static electricity was spilling into my room from everywhere. Spectral tides teased my little hairs to standing. 

 

Then something spitter-sparked in the corner of my vision. Then it seemed as if the floor had belched up great clouds of glitter, or my ceiling had dissolved and that substance was raining down. 

 

But the glitter wasn’t moving at all, only sprouting twinkling filagree, tracery that stretched and interacted until strange corridors were born, even as my walls dissolved to accommodate ’em. Upon those outlines grew bones, then muscles and veins, all interwoven together. 

 

I had just enough time to see patchwork skin—knitted from all human ages and ethnicities, plus all sorts of organisms I’m not quite sure of—slither into existence and constrict around me before all went dark. 

 

There’s now some kind of resonance in the air, nearly mechanical, that makes my ears want to seal over. I’m posting this as fast as I can, then I’ll call 911.

Update: Okay, I called the cops, and they said they’d send someone to my house, but that was hours ago. I’ll try ’em again soon, I guess.

 

Shining my phone’s flashlight on that which entombs me, I’ve seen apple sized-segments of flesh opening up into amoeba-shaped orifices, beyond which sounds something sub-audible.

Update: I can hear ’em now, whispering in English, Japanese, Spanish, and other languages that at least sound human. Prisoners, all. Hundreds of ’em, maybe. But the English slang that some speak is either archaic or unknown to me. 

 

More disturbing are the bellows and grunts that could indicate evolutionary throwbacks and the various shades of buzzing of what could be extraterrestrials. Such suffering in the air; I can hardly hear my own. 

 

Should I shine my flashlight into the holes between my prison and others? Can I risk drawing attention to myself? I called the cops again and they claimed I was pranking ’em. Let me think on this for a while.

Update: I’ve done it. Somehow, my eyes haven’t dissolved and streamed down my face yet—there are fates far worse in store for ’em, maybe. 

 

I’ve seen It building itself, you see, picking Its victims apart with yards-long, rotating fingers. Choice tidbits—ears, eyes, inner organs, hair, whatever—It incorporates into Its vast Self. The rest, It feeds to ravening shadows—some kind of fucked-up commensalism, I guess.

Update: The entity, with Its constellation network of eyes framed by peacock feathers, with Its long, spiraling limbs built of impossible jointage—The Continent That Slithers—lets the tension build. The orifices between It and me are widening. By the light of my phone’s screen, I see the lines in my palms and the prints on my fingers begin to eddy.

 

What did we ever think we were doing? We learned to love each other and assumed that, ultimately, that would be enough? But what will we be when we’re no longer ourselves? Will enough of our minds survive to recognize what’s been done to us? Will our spirits be reknitted, too? 

 

My phone’s dying, anyway. Two percent charge and fading. This’ll be my last update. Honestly, I no longer see the point of ’em.

 

But, hey, parts of me might visit you soon.
