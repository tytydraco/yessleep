Before you go and get mad at me for going out a long distance into the woods to see something I shouldn't have, I live in an off-grid home close to a national forest. Or I used to, anyway. I had to go about 80 kilometers to one of the cities in my area so that I could type this out, before I go and do what I need to do to beg for forgiveness.

And there's a small town that's on-grid about 24 kilometers away, that which I went to most of the time for seeds to grow my own food, as well as use the smart phone I own to check in on my daughter's family.

But today, I screwed up bad. And the spirits know I frequent that small town, as some of them show up in that town often. So I had to drive and use public transportation to get to the big city to do this.

But I need to tell you what happened. What I saw that I should not have.

It's not just when the sun shines during rain that the fox spirits I heard about hold their weddings. There have been days when the sun shined while snow came down. And today, that's what the weather was like.

I know the fox spirits don't like to be watched when they hold their weddings, but it usually means good luck when a sun shower happens.

I ventured into the woods to get more wood for the fireplace. The trees that I raised for the wood died in their sapling stage, so I'm stuck with getting wild wood until I can successfully grow a tree garden for wood. It was while I was going to the forest that I began hearing some flute music.

The flute music was... music to my ears. Although accompanied by some bells and whistles, I also heard some drumming. I felt like I had to continue.

It seemed fascinating to an old man like me. I wondered just who could be playing such beautiful music in the forest.

Then I remembered--there was sunshine and snowfall at the same time.

I thought that maybe hiding behind a tree would help me not get caught while watching what event this might have been. But from my right, I began seeing shadows of some type. They seemed to be moving in a uniform manner, slow and steady.

They would move in this manner, then they would stop for a few minutes. Then, they would resume their march in this manner.

I began sweating and my heart began to pound. They stopped their march in this way, and as they did, they all turned their heads in *my* direction! I began to worry about what they would do to me if I were caught.

But when they turned their heads in my direction for the 5th time since they appeared before me, I got a clear view of their faces and clothes.

Each of what appeared to be the bridesmaids and groomsmen were wearing kimono, in red and black. The two that I guessed were the bride and groom were wearing kimono that really stood out. I assumed the bride was the one in the white kimono, and that the groom was wearing a blue kimono.

And their faces... They looked strange. Menacing. Almost... demon-like. And the faces were black!

I began to feel my heart pound faster than ever. I was sweating a bit profusely. So profusely I thought my head was gonna turn to ice in this weather.

Then the things that I assumed were spirits went on with their matrimonial march. And then they turned their heads in my direction again.

Sure that I was caught watching them, I began to run. The forest seemed to stretch out in front of me while I was running back from the woods to my cabin, but I summed that up to vertigo even though I normally don't get vertigo.

The menacing faces kept coming into my vision. It was as if I couldn't run through the woods without seeing the faces.

I finally reached the cabin after about 30 minutes of running. I thought for sure I'd be safe inside, but as soon as I reached the door, I noticed something through the window that looked like someone rummaging through the house and my belongings.

Sure enough, it was one of the creatures. It looked exactly like one of the ones I saw in the matrimony.

It seemed to be angry. And it appeared as though it were looking for something. Or someone...

I darted off and jumped into a bush and waited until it came out of the cabin. When it did, it appeared to be looking around, then it darted off somewhere.

It dawned on me that it was going in the direction of the small town I go to sometimes that is on-grid!

I went inside the cabin, hoping that I would be safe inside. I was about to rearrange the cabin to my liking when I noticed a small box on the table, with a note tied to it.

I'll translate for you, since it was written in Japanese.

"You have seen us, and you have disturbed the wedding of Kuni and Tsubishi. You have broken the sacred law, that we are not to be seen during our sacred events. To gain our forgiveness, you must slit one wrist with the knife inside. Let the blood spill, for blood represents the truth of the soul. Do it near the site where you broke the law."

I opened the box that was on the table, and sure enough, there was a knife inside. It looked something like a ritual dagger that I have seen hyper religious folks use, especially when part of a cult.

Taking the box with me, I drove down the road to the small town. The air began to feel heavier and heavier the further I drove. Fear kept setting in while I was driving.

By the time I reached the small town, something felt terribly wrong. I was opting on using my smart phone to write this out, but one of the people in town put his hand on my shoulder.

"Yamamoto-san, you shouldn't be here."

I froze in place. The voice belonged to the owner of the flower shop. Someone who I once saw to get flowers for my wife's grave last year.

"Hey, Sadao, what's wrong?" said one of the children.

"Sadao-kun, an angry bull spirit came looking for you." the florist remarked. "You saw something you shouldn't have. He said to tell you to check back at your cabin if we saw you."

I showed her the box and the note.

"So you picked up what he left there already? Good. I suggest you leave now while you still have time. You can't be here any longer. The bull spirits won't forgive you unless you show them you are sorry for disturbing their wedding."

After that, I took a bus at the stop on the edge of the town. I was only going to use this public transportation to get to somewhere that I could write this. I'm writing this in an Internet caf√© while I sip my last bit of coffee. After I post this, I will head back to the forest where I saw the matrimony, and I will follow the instructions on the note. It's the only way to get the bull demons to see I am sorry for disturbing the wedding, after all.

I might die doing this, so it's best if I leave this message before I go ahead with it. I have no regrets, but the fact that I have to slit my wrist to apologize to the bull spirits scares me still.
