I think everyone is avoiding me and it's starting to freak me out.

So, to set the stage, I'm an average man in his 30s. I work from home. I live alone. Well—like really alone now. I've never been a popular guy. My phone was rarely used to communicate with my fellow man.

Honestly, I never really had an issue with isolation until recently. I rather enjoyed my own company—until it was my only option. A few days ago, I was working at my computer—just some data logging. Pays the bills. I went to submit my documents, but my email wouldn't send.

The company's offices are just downtown, so I figured I'd just walk it down. Some people have already returned to the office after working remote due to "the big sick." I slipped on my shoes and shuffled to the door. I patted my cat, Lucy, on the head on my way out—or I tried to. She ducked me and retreated under the couch. That wasn't like her. I should have known then.

As I walked the few blocks to the office building, I noticed people coming my way sporadically crossing the street before we intersected. I hadn't showered—I didn't plan on displaying myself to the public today. I probably stank.

When I hobbled through the circular rotating door into the office's lobby, the receptionist snapped her attention to me immediately. She looked scared, and her posture straightened. She whispered something into a little earpiece she wore. As I took the few steps up to the counter, she reacted to each footfall with a flinch.

Christ, was she on drugs? Too much caffeine? I wanted to ask her if she was okay, but as soon as I opened my mouth, she turned and sprinted to the back of the room, high heels clicking rapidly on the tile.

I set the folder containing the physical copies of my work on her counter and left quickly to avoid any further awkwardness. I think if I were normal, this is where I would have known something was wrong—but I didn't connect those dots until I got home.

I sat in my recliner, propped open the window next to me, and called for Lucy. She didn't come out at first, so I went looking for her. I dropped to my knees and pressed my head to the floor to search under the couch.

As soon as we made eye contact, she hissed and sprinted out—like she was being hunted. As I sat up, I saw the very tip of her tail go out the window. I live on the fifth floor.

God, I miss Lucy.

I went down to the street to collect her, crying openly the whole way down. When I reached her, she was hanging on by a thread. I knew the injury was fatal and all I could do was comfort her. As I reached my hand out to stroke her, her eyes opened wide. She hissed again and tried to erect herself on broken legs. She scooted away a few inches and finally went still.

I was broken. She was my only true companion, and she spent the very last of her life making clear how much she hated me. I looked up through my tears expecting stares of pity or secondhand embarrassment. What I saw was nothing. Like, actually nothing—no people, no birds, no dogs, no squirrels. There was no sign of life visible around me.

A little freaked out, and deeply saddened, I shambled back up the stairs. I sat down hard in my chair, looked over at the pink unicorn-themed cat bed on the floor, and burst into tears. I sat and cried for a long time. Eventually, I must have fallen asleep.

Dawn peeked in, gently lifting my eyelids. God, my head hurt. The events leading me to the present replayed in my mind, and I sat silently for a while, wishing I had just had a bad dream. I pulled my phone out to see what time it was and if I missed any calls or messages. It was about 8:30 in the morning—and I missed nothing.

I dialed my mom to talk about what happened. She was a busy lady, but she always made time for me. The phone droned some kind of dial tone or error message—the call wouldn't go through. I missed her dearly and needed any comfort possible.

As I slowly wandered to my mother's house a few blocks away, the street was completely empty. It was quiet. There were no morning bird songs. I saw one guy—he was exiting his own apartment building. He happened to turn his head my way, and as soon as he saw me, he broke into a sprint.

I was tired of this and wanted desperately to know what was going on. I chased him. Despite being pretty sedentary, I could manage a hell of a sprint. He ran for a bridge spanning a river, and I stopped at the end and just watched as he continued to race down the vacant road.

When he got to about the middle, he jumped. It looked like he aimed for the rock formation that broke the water's surface. I yelped when he made contact. He nearly disintegrated into a red-pink mist when the rocks met him. I could feel a cold sweat over every inch of my body. Everything was telling me something was wrong.

I ran, hyperventilating, to my mother's front door and pounded on it. There was no answer and the silence remained unbroken. I collapsed to the ground, in the midst of a full-blown panic attack. As I struggled to breathe, I noticed that it got darker.

Dozens of human-shaped shadows lined the tops of each building as far as I could see. Before I could even process what was happening, the sound of meat on pavement filled my ears. Again and again, they broke themselves on the infrastructure. I shut my eyes, cupped my hands over my ears, and wept openly again.

When it fell silent again, the road was full of people again. Not walking or commuting—but twitching, convulsing. Heaps of viscera lined the sidewalks, red everywhere. Limbs, internal organs, and faces replaced pavement in a horrific spectacle.

I'm back home now, trying to post this—hoping it gets out. My Facebook, Instagram, Twitter... all seem like they were deleted. God, please let someone see this. When I’m finished, I’m going to go up onto the roof of my building and have a few drinks.

I'm going to need the lack of inhibition to follow through.
