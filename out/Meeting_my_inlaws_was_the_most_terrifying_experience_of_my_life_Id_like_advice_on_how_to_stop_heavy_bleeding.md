I really wanted to comfort my bleeding fiancée, because I knew her emotional pain probably outweighed the agony caused by her torn flesh. [I was in a shitty state, though, because the pain in my left side made it nearly impossible to stand up](https://old.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/17iaui8/meeting_my_inlaws_was_the_most_terrifying/). 

Damn were-lions, am I right?

“I’m very sorry for your troubles, Lacey, and if you’ll give me a minute or two, I swear I’ll be able to stand again.”

“It’s too late,” Frank breathed. 

My future father-in-law, Frank, was a lewd, overbearing fat man with no sense of personal space or boundaries. Those were all of his best qualities.

“We made them dead,” I huffed, “compared to that, it won’t be a big deal to stop her bleeding.”

“That’s not what he means,” Lacey answered in a gentle voice. “You were right about what you said.”

I lowered my head and continued to struggle breathing. “I’ve been wrong about so many things I’ve said or not said that you’ll have to be more specific.”

“The thing you just said a second ago.”

“My protestation persists.”

“You asked if I become one of them once I’m bitten. The answer is yes.”

I clenched my teeth and forced myself into a standing position. My head spun as I looked around the room and appreciated just how much blood coated the walls.

“So how do we fix it?” I wheezed.

“It’s too late,” Frank repeated. 

My lurking sense of fear, omnipresent since the killing began, reared its head at his words. Heart pounding, I turned to Lacey’s father. “What do you mean?”

When he looked at me, it was with an expression I had never seen before. His eyes glistened over red, veiny cheeks.

“I’ll always love you, Lacey,” he whispered. 

“You don’t have to say what I already know,” she squeaked in return. 

An awkward silence ensued. I was grateful that my balls were itchy, because scratching them gave something for my hands to do. 

“I should go,” she pressed, turning away.

“For argument’s sake, could you pretend I don’t know anything about what you’re saying?” I asked.

“I’m going to become like*them*!” she snapped. “The only way to prevent it-”

“I’ll support whatever you say,” I interrupted.

“Is by dying.”

“Oh.”

The next silence was worse. 

“So that means a lifetime of… this?” I asked, gesturing to the dead were-lions.

“It means that she’s going to kill herself,” Frank answered, his voice haltering. 

My fear spiraled to a bursting point. “WHAT? How is that a reasonable balance of extremes?”

“Our family will never accept me like this,” she answered. “It’s not a good option, but it’s the best one.” Lacey flashed her big green eyes at me. “And more importantly, it’s because I love you, Joseph.”

My jaw fell. “Can you not make major life decisions on my behalf without consulting me first?”

“What is there to decide, Joseph?” My fiancée asked through clenched teeth. 

“I’m big on questioning the ‘killing yourself’ decision.”

She clutched her hair in two giant fistfuls as the blood streamed down her arms. “Would you rather come live with me in complete exile as my family hunts me? Is that preferable?”

“Yes.”

Lacey and her father froze, staring at me like I had nineteen heads.

 Thirteen seconds later, she finally retained the ability to speak. “Why the hell would you want that?”

I gazed at her, confused. “Because I love you, Lacey. I’ll be happier in any life with you than the best possible alternative without you.”

She looked ready to cry. “You’d prefer a life of constant hiding? My family will never accept me, and I’ll never join the Others. Both sides will want me dead.”

I shrugged. “Asking whether I want a life with you is like asking whether or not I’d like my arm torn off. It’s not that difficult to decide.”

SLAM

The three of us turned to face the hallway. The sound had come from a nearby room.

SLAM *bang*

“They’re coming,” Lacey explained, her voice cracking.

“Okay, let me get this straight,” I interrupted. “You’re a family, an ancient family, of were-lion hunters, because were-lions apparently exist. You chose today to tell me, because it’s after the engagement but prior to the marriage, so it seemed like just a lovely balance. But everything got turned upside down when Lacey had to save me from saving *her*, and now you’d rather kill yourself than turn into one of them. Am I right?”

She folded her hands together. “Yes.”

“Great, because I’ve got a plan,” I answered. 

Then I threw a right cross against Frank’s face, hitting his chin with a powerful cracking noise. 

Just then, three more were-lions poured into the room. 

I survived because others didn’t. But that’s the most I have the ability to share for right now. I’ll explain more [later](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).
