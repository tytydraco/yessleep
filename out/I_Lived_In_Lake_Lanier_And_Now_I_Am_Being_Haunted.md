Hello reader. For privacy reasons, I will be referred to as Laurence. And this is a story of when I lived next to Lake Lanier. For context, I am a 5 '6 Caucasian Male and I was 20 at the time when this happened. I was living in a 4 story house. Well, if you want to count the attic as part of the stories, otherwise 3 stories. My neighborhood was peaceful and had lots of good neighbors that usually keep to themselves. I lived with my brother, sister, Dad, and our roommate who did the cooking most nights and helped out with other things. My brother and sister were born 12 months apart and the same year but my sister is usually a year older than my brother till the final month. Now lets get this out of the way so I can tell you my story of how it all began.

It was on my day off during the Summer of 2020. I was driving my younger brother and I to the park that was at Lake Lanier. For privacy reasons, we will refer to my brother as Eli.

"So Eli," I asked him. "Are you ready for some quality brotherly time?"

"Yeah." Eli said, some sort of monotone to his voice.

Don't get us wrong, Eli and I get along very well as brothers. Sure in our childhood we had our little fights and nit picks but we were just kids and it's kinda natural for siblings to have their little disagreements. Eli, while 3-4 years younger than me, was definitely taller than I was. I can safely say 6’0. But He'll always be my younger brother that I love dearly.

"Okay wanna take the fishing poles or the bags?" I asked him.

"I can take the bags." He said, carrying my backpack and some of our snacks.

"Wonderful." I said, grabbing the poles and my phone out of the car before shutting it and locking. If you are wondering, my car is a Chevy Impala 2014. It gets me around awesomely from Point A to Point B. My silver Steed if you will.

Where we arrived, there was a mini beach, a safe area for swimming, lots of picnic tables, and plenty of woods to hike. With me being...well .. me... I never liked to swim in the waters. Why? Lake Lanier is supposedly haunted and many people including professional swimmers lose their lives here. I wasn't ready to be on headline news. I was just here to fish.

"Have any ideas for a spot Laurence?" Eli asked.

"Hmmm.." I was scanning the area and spots around that didn't have too many people. I'm not really a people person to be honest. To some it's me being anxious. But for me, I absolutely can't. Especially when you have kids screaming at the top of their lungs. "How about over there?"

My brother nodded and we walked over in that direction. We have passed a guy who looked to be in his 40s and someone maybe in his early 20s I assumed was his son. They had just caught a huge largemouth bass. It was quite a sight. My brother and I had reached the spot and took a seat, setting up our fishing stuff. I had chosen a night crawler and artificial bait. He resembled a crawfish.

"So you've picked that one?" I asked Eli.

"Yep. It's more realistic than flip flop designs." He had that weird grin and then faced the lake, holding his arm back to cast. I watched him almost flick his wrist to send his line far out. If I had a good guess, it was about maybe 50 feet. I would normally say it's impressive but that was truly incredible. "Try that one out Laurence."

"You're on!" I laughed then took a deep breath, casting out to the waters. Not as far as He did, less. But I gave a nervous grin as I admitted defeat. "That one was rigged."

"Sure it was." He said and stared out at the lake.

It felt like hours when in reality it was minutes. My brother's line started twitching then jerked. He pulled back and started reeling in the line. I got excited and sat my rod down quickly to watch him fight with whatever got the bait. The end of the pole was holding on as it bent downward and once it came into clearer view, He had caught a largemouth. It looked to be maybe 18 pounds. I didn't doubt my brother would lift it. He was stronger than myself after all. He laughed a little.

"Hey let me get a pic! Dad will be amazed!" I picked up my phone that I had left and opened the camera, positioned it to face him. He had a neutral expression like many photos he was in. I'm not one to tell you to smile. Whatever expression you want to use, I'd accept. "Great catch dude!"

"Thank you." He said, looking at the fish.

But as we celebrated his catch and him slowly going through the process of gently and respectfully releasing the fish, I happened to catch something unusual in the distance. I couldn't gauge how far it was, but something... Or someone... Was peeking from behind a tree. Pure black, like a shadow, with 2 white dots that might've been the eyes. Wild hair like a cartoon individual that had been shocked by lightning. It stood there. I had to rub my eyes, squinting. It remained.

"Hey... Eli?" I asked.

"Yeah?" He said. "What's up Laurence?"

"Do you see that? Just ahead." I pointed behind him in the direction of the thing.

"Huh?" He turned around and looked back at me. "No. I do not. Are you ok?"

I will admit I have been feeling very anxious lately. Down. Depression even. I had recently been broken up with by my ex girlfriend of 4 years who we will call Bridget as well as the passing of our family cat Carl. He has been my buddy since I was 10. And for him to suddenly be gone before Christmas, a week before, was hell for me. It was so much weight for me to carry over my shoulders. Perhaps this was my negative emotions playing tricks on my brain? It has to be that...

"Laurence," Eli said. "I know your breakup with Bridget and the death of Carl has been weighing you down. And I can't tell you to shrug it off. But please, try and ease up."

"Right..." I looked at the thing that was still there. Maybe it was grief in the physical form of my struggle to let go. "You could be right. I'm sorry."

"I love you buddy." He said before walking us back to our spot. It was only one more turn of my head before I realized the thing vanished but that's when it began. I clutched my chest and started breathing heavily. My sound got his attention and he looked at me. "Laurence?"

I had fallen to my knees, wanting to cry but nothing came out. The figure didn't disappear but moved. It was now closer. Like maybe the distance of 2 school buses parked behind the other. The figure was more clear to me. Still black as a shadow and those two bright orbs I assumed were the eyes. Even as my vision blurred and I gasped for air, having symptoms of a combination of night terror and severe anxiety attacks, I saw the figure was feminine. So for this purpose, we'll say it's female. She had no mouth or nose. But those eyes were wide. For better description, research shadow people and you'll see what I mean. She walked closer and by some driving force of fear and potentially adrenaline, I got up fast and looked at my brother.

"Eli, we have to go to the car now. Grab our things and let's go. I can't stay here longer." I said and quickly collected our bags, running to the car. I turned back once to see how far he was. The figure didn't seem to stop my younger brother but was advancing towards me still. She was after me. But why?

"Laurence, what do you see? Is your glucose out of control?" Eli called out. But I was already in the car, waiting for him.

I couldn't answer. She was still following. But walking slowly. I could easily outwalk her. She was playing with me. What did she want? I shoved the key into the ignition and cranked the car. Once Eli had entered, I was ready to put the knob in reverse but the moment I touched it, It was to my realization that "She" was already there. I slowly turned my head to my window and saw her staring through it. She tilted her head and waved slowly, dragging her finger down the glass silently. I gasped again and couldn't breathe, gripping the stick shift and trembled before loosening my grip, the world going black and the last thing I heard was my brother calling 911 before I eventually passed out.

I had awoken at the house and Eli was at the foot of my bed. So was my sister Allison. My Dad walked in.

"Laurence, what happened out there?" He had asked.

"Eli... Are you sure you didn't see her?" I gasped.

"Who?" He had confusion written on his face. "It was just you and I in the car. There was nobody there except the ambulance that later arrived and the police."

"It was some shadow..." I stuttered. I had described everything to them, what I saw and the way the figures moved.

"Laurence you're still stressed out and you're most likely having hallucinations from the stress Overdrive." My Dad said. "Just rest for now and you should be better."

"Eli..." I looked at my brother. "What were my vitals? Was I okay?"

"They said your blood sugar was fine and your vitals were good. Maybe it's stress. Please... Relax."

"Alright." I wasn't one to argue unless I felt I was absolutely accused. But maybe they were right. I was overstimulating and panicked over it.

It felt like minutes before I had passed out again. It went from dark to a clear view of the sky. The skies were without clouds and it looked just like the ones you see in very old VHS looking movies. There was a castle sitting on the giant hills. The castle looked quite fancy with a mixture of Transylvania. The camera panned down to show my brother and I in my car driving through the dark woods. Blue skies in the day time but the woods are dark because of the very tall pine trees shading us. It was me being the driver as usual. The trip was quiet. It was going smoothly until I saw the figure again. Only this time is very different. This one's shape was odd. A shorter individual, same weird spikes looking like hair struck by lightning on TV, but wearing a witches hat, all black. Same big bright white eyes. The figure was darting around in the woods stalking my brother and I.

"Hey Eli?" I asked. "Did you see that?"

"See what?" He asked, confused once more.

This was de ja vu. It's strange I even had that memory from the real world. This was a dream. This shadow was a munchkin. But equally giving me those same shudders and feelings of absolute fear as my body forced me to slam on the breaks. But why? Why was I unwillingly doing the opposite of the  natural responses of escaping danger? My hand shakingly reached for the knob and putting it in park, I rolled down my window and stared out, waiting. Waiting for what?

"Laurence?" Eli's voice sounded like it was coming from a distance. He was next to me though. What was going on? His face then slowly distorted and became enveloped in darkness, his entire body becoming a shadow as He ripped his own clothes off, his regular hands becoming clawed. Again, no details. Only darkness. My body was stuck in some sort of trance as the claws dug into my neck as the face formed a mouth. A white one. The eyes looked like scribbled circles. The munchkin had joined in with the shadow that had taken my brother's form previously and opened its mouth to bite down on my thigh. The feminine shadow from reality appeared, ripping my door off and putting her humanoid hand under my chin, turning me to face her. She then opened her mouth to let out a deafening shriek of horror but at the same time felt my soul leave my body as I awoke with a scream.

"Laurence!" Allison came in, shaking me. "Brother what's wrong? Are you ok?"

"Wh-where is Eli?" I asked, eyes looking around frantically. "He hasn't turned, has He?"

"Kid," My Dad walked in. "Eli is okay. You're okay you're okay."

My Dad was a softy. He hugged me and held me. I was shaking. I felt so embarrassed as a male to cry. It was so horrifying. My Dad didn't need me to overdo it. He said It's natural to cry. Usually when I wanted to cry, I had to be alone. But usually Carl would be by my side, kissing me and rubbing against me. He wasn't here. It broke me more. I spoke his name a few times.

"Hey, buddy." My Dad let go. "There's nothing to hurt you. Nobody is gonna hurt you. I promise. You're safe here with us."

"Yes big brother." Allison hugged me. "We're here for you. Bridget is a nobody. Don't let her get a hold of your thoughts."

I turned my head to look at the window. I saw a mother bird with her babies, feeding them a worm. I slowed down my breathing, trying to ease up. It was difficult but eventually I was good again. I felt my phone vibrate on my bedside and I picked it up to see it was a message from Bridget. I shook my head as my heart sank. She texted me again. But what for? I read the message.

"Hey Laurence, I'm checking on you to see if you are okay." Was what she texted me. Wiping my eyes, I texted back.

"Yeah. I'm fine." I gave her a short answer. When I'm upset with someone or don't want to be bothered, I give a short answer. Not even a minute later she responded. It was shown she read it the moment I sent her a text.

"Are you sure? I can tell something was wrong."

"Don't worry about me. What do you want?" I finally texted her. You can say I'm mean for this. But she did kinda break my heart. So, it's fair to me.

"If this is a bad time, I'll come back later to check on you. I just wanted to see if we could call."

"Bridget, why don't you talk to one of our mutual friends? Like Abigail? She's female. Your talk could be something she can help you with."

"Listen, I just wanna talk to you. I've known you the longest and I feel more comfortable with you with what I need to get off my chest."

"Fine."

I was the first to press that call button. It was instagram ringing. 1 ring. 2 rings. Then that familiar sound of the other end picking up. There she was. As much as it hurt to see her, Bridget was still a very very gorgeous woman. She had occasionally changed her hair color but right now it was strawberry blonde. Her emerald eyes behind her cute glasses. It was like looking through one of those scopes that jewelers look through to see if a diamond was real. That's my comparison at least. Her precious face. But instead of her smile, it was her crying. I've only heard her cry once. This was the second time. She was panting and I just looked at her dumbfounded. See, I'm not great at expressing or processing my own emotions. It hurt a bit to see her cry.

"What's wrong Bridget?" I tried to sound sincere. But my own heart break over her was winning.

"He and I had broken up." She cried. I kept a straight face. In my mind, I wanted to tell her 'it sucked didn't it? To have your heart broken? Now you know how I felt' But no. I just nodded.

"I'm sorry. Is this what you wanted to call me about?" I asked her, sighing.

"I miss him so much. I wish things would go back to how they were."

That shattered me all over again and I trembled. Not just from hurt. But anger. Not because he left her. Screw that. She barely knew him for a year for what it seems and she's crying over him versus us knowing each other for 6 years and being together for 4 years? It was inconceivable. But then as she cried to me, babbling some of the same words, my heart stopped as I turned my head to look behind my desk. There was an arm wiggling like a snake. It was waving to me like a greeting and slowly peering out, was the shadow woman. Her head almost touched the ceiling, her own body casting like a real shadow. Her arms outstretched, she loomed over me and I felt myself shake again, like a seizure.

"Laurence?" Bridget calmed enough to get my attention. "Laurence? Hey.... What's going on?"

I couldn't move. Couldn't answer her. My body had its attention towards the shadow woman. Her head rotated slowly but in a taunting manner too. There was nobody to help me. I could see her step out of the wall and walk towards the foot of my bed, becoming 3 dimensional. Her claws on my sheets, leaving visible claw marks. My eyes glued to her, I started sweating and trembling, gasping for air but nothing coming in or out.

"OH MY GOD LAURENCE!" Bridget screamed. This was loud enough for my brother whose room was across mine to barge in and stare in shock. Could it be that he's actually seeing this?

"DAD! LAURENCE IS SEIZING AGAIN!" He yelled. Nope… He still couldn’t see it.

"Eli is that you?!" Bridget yelled. "TELL ME THAT LAURENCE IS OKAY!"

Eli couldn't move. I think he was finally seeing something that I was trying to explain. Dad ran upstairs to my room and stopped at the doorway too. He saw her too. Everyone was at the doorway. The woman was silent as a mouse as she climbed onto my bed on her knees.

The figure moved closer and reached out, dragging her claws across my chest slowly but not making a cut. It was moreso a tease for her while it was a threat for me. It terrified me that these creatures could not be seen by my own family or anyone else. I was too scared to move or call for help. The moment she got closer, I was shaken by my Dad.

“Son, snap out of it. You’re okay, I promise.” He picked up my phone and looked to see I was on call with Bridget. He shook his head. “You’re talking to her again. She’s not good for you. I thought you deleted her.”

I had finally awoken to reality as the creepy woman had left my sight. She was nowhere to be found and by some instincts, I touched myself to make sure nothing was on me. I was fine. No cuts, no signs of having been touched by her. I sighed and looked at the phone to see Bridget did in fact hang up. I was at a loss for words. No disappointment. Maybe… Just maybe… I could get rid of them. Those figures. Once and for all. And as it appeared, they still could not see what I saw. The woman was invisible… non-existing to them… only to me. But why?

Years later, after my last encounter with the phantoms, my siblings had moved out and I remained with my Dad and Stepmom and Stepmom's Mom. With their Dog as the addition to the family, 3 humans and 3 dogs as well as my recently bought 14 fish I call my children, I can say for sure those were my demons. Every one of my worries and thoughts manifested as figments of my imagination into reality. And when I thought those nightmares were over, oh boy was I wrong. I am now 25 and let me tell you more of this.

"Laurence." My Dad popped his head in. "How're you holding up?"

"I'm alright." I said, petting the pawprint some more. "Just having a bit of me time."

"Alright well, if you need anything you can let us know." He left the doorway.

As his footsteps had gone to the living room, I sigh. Surely I didn't feel anything odd. But that emptiness wasn't gonna last long. I got bored and went to the pet store near me. When I arrived there was a strange man. He was just standing there in the shade, just... watching me. I felt my heart stop. Slowly the same feeling I had when those shapes were nearby. Then like nothing short, the feeling quickly subsided. The man only stood there looking quite harmless at first although I couldn't see his face clearly. I decided to just walk to the entrance of the pet store, side eyeing him. He waved at me, keeping quiet. His expression didn't change. I entered the store.

"Hello again Laurence!" It was the store manager Mia. "Where to buy more fish?"

"Maybe," I said back. "Mostly just browsing and admiring this lovely store."

I walked around, admiring all the aquarium supplies they had in store. In front of me were fish medicine capsules. Grabbing a pack, I turned my eyes to see that very same man staring at me, keeping a straight expression. His dark shades are almost vanta black. He slowly smiled, opening the door and I walked off to the back, pretending to look. His boots could be heard very clearly as I stared at some dog treats. The steps were approaching me.

“Hello young man..” He said coldly.

“Hm?” I had turned to look at him but my eyes had to move up to see how tall this individual was. He looked to be… Gosh… 6’8?

“Shopping for fish? How many do you have?” He said, looking at the display with me.

“Uh… 13.” I said, trying not to sound nervous.

“Intriguing…” He picked up a little ornament resembling the spongebob pineapple house. “So…. I can sense you came across the mistress?”

That stopped my heart immediately. Mistress? Who was that? Could it be that Shadow Woman was the mistress?

“Mistress? Uh… how do you know?” I asked.

“I am the Master…” He said, putting the ornament back on its shelf. “Unlucky for you, nobody else can see us for what we really are except you. Right now… your shop owner friend there only sees you.”

“What do you want with me?” I asked. “I don’t know what I did to upset you all.”

“You are full of negative emotions and we feed off of that force. Your anxiety… Your heartbreak… Your sorrows… Depression… It feeds us. The Mistress only appears at your times of worry… So does The Jester and The Brute… and The Hound will sniff you out… and won’t be so patient. He’s hungry.”

“No.. no… I am faking it.” I lied. I was getting really unsettled by this man. He was making me want to run away. I stumbled back and landed on my butt.

“False..” He knelt down and stared me in the face. His white scribbled looking eyes staring at me. “You are in distress. While the other 3 will cause you panic and for your body to go in a state much like sleep paralysis, I can do so much worse. See…. Laurence… You cannot escape us… Nobody will ever believe you.”

I shook my head again and got up, staring at him as he rose back on his feet as well as if to copy me. He gave a light chuckle as a fellow customer walked right through him like He was a hologram. Or perhaps, just a ghost.

"I still don't know why you specifically go after me." I said.

"You fuel our power-”

“ENOUGH!” I shouted at the top of my lungs and collapsed onto my knees. “LEAVE ME ALONE!”

“Hey what’s going on?” Mia ran over. “Is someone bothering you?”

“Yes He’s right there!” I pointed at The Master. He was still there, forming a smile almost out of thin air. He nodded and I could see The Mistress and The Jester and The Brute showing up, staring at me. They slowly stood by The Master’s side, taunting and laughing at me as I began to feel that familiar feeling of helplessness.

“Honey, calm down.” Mia held my shoulders lightly, shaking me. “Eric call 911! He’s not responding!”

What felt like hours, I heard sirens outside. Mixture of police and an Ambulance. Mia stayed by my side as I trembled and the figures turned to walk away, their laughter echoed. Like being in hell maybe. Like the big boss of Hell and his side kicks. I slowly snapped out of it when I was confronted by a police officer.

“Hey son.” He said. “My name’s Officer Brent. I got a call about you seizing up. Are you alright? From what I understand from records, this is not your first time having these episodes. We got the ambulance crew to check on your vitals. Did you take any medication or-”

“With all due respect officer, I am being followed.” I said. “They were right there. 4 figures were-”

“Son, may I see your ID? We’re gonna have to sentence you to a mental institution. You’ve been having these episodes…”

“Officer please! You have to believe me! They are-”

“Enough… Please Laurence….” He walked me out the door and turned my back one last time, Mia watched in disbelief. I was her favorite customer but yet, I could feel that she was very concerned for me. I just wish…. I wished that someone else could see those things and not just me. I prayed that someone out there could see them too and give me an explanation as to why these figures are following me and why me specifically. As much as I hate to say this, why not target the mental hospital?

I had awoken to bright white lights. I found myself sitting in a chair and there was a man in a business outfit, hands folded under his chin as he looked into my eyes. I looked down and found that I was also in a sort of white suit. I looked back up and he greeted me.

“Laurence… My name is Detective Stone… and you might be wondering why you are here.” He took his glasses off and stared at me again. “You are not in any trouble or danger. But they specifically sent me here to talk to you.”

“Detective Stone…” I said to myself as I watched him pull out a note pad and pen. “Why am I here? I wanna go home…”

“I know you do Laurence…” He said out loud. “But I must interview you… You claim to be followed by… shapes?” He clicked his pen open.

“They… wait.. Why do you care if you won’t believe me? None of you do. And I am stuck being followed and leeched off by them…” I sighed. “Why interview me when-”

“Laurence.” He stopped me there, resting his pen on the notepad and leaning back a little on his seat. “You are not the first to admit these sightings. There have been other insane people who have seen these things and experienced the same reactions as you have shown. So, these seizures you have are not normal. Now, we had a patient years ago named Jeremy who had the same exact encounters as you. His whereabouts are unknown. He escaped. So maybe… you have run into him at some point?”

“I don’t know a Jeremy. Never met one.” I said, shaking my head. “I’m sorry Detective Stone. But I am-”

“That’s somewhat good. He’s extremely dangerous and despite how many times I have given the idea to just put the poor man out of his misery, the staff are against it as they wanna avoid lawsuits.”

I had to sit in place as Detective Stone wrote some stuff down and him occasionally looking up at me. This was unfair. I wasn’t just dreaming this. I twiddled my thumbs looking down. I was very nervous. I want to wake up. I want this to be just a nightmare. But no. The smell of these clothes, the texture of them, so plain. Yet so real. Normally in these situations I would try and imagine some scenarios or think of funny stuff to distract my anxious mind. But right now… That wasn’t working well for me. I was blank. My mind was not wanting to think. There’s times Detective Stone would click his pen to help me snap out of the involuntary spacing out.

“Well, Laurence.” He got up. “I got all the answers I needed. They’re gonna take care of you here. I assure you.” 

After our interview had finally ended, 2 large guys guided me to my room and seeing that it was all white with nothing but a bed and window to keep me company, I sat on the bed. I couldn’t believe what was happening. It really hurt that I was separated from my family. Have I really gone mad? Were those figures really just my imagination? Figments of all my heartbreak and trauma? Manifested into untouchable things that only I can see and interact with?

“Child…” I heard that chilling voice again. That same voice from the fish store. I jerked my head and there he was. The same figure.

“You again..” I backed up into the wall. “You heard me being dismissed again… why are you here?!”

“Perhaps I should've made it clear… that we weren't after you…” he tilted his hat low.

“What do you mean by that?” I said, trembling. “You and the others are terrorizing me!”

“You weren't our original target. Jeremy was.” He said.

“Jeremy? Why didn't you say so sooner? And why are you after me?”

“Cause your anxiety tastes just as sweet…”

“I'm done here…” I looked for an escape and ran out the door. I didn't care who saw me. I ran butt naked out that door and out of that hospital. Security tried but I was too much for them. No I wasn't superman or all powerful. I was just thrashing too much like a fish out of water. When all else failed, they called for the police to track me down and subdue me.

“You can't run forever Laurence.” The Master said. “There is no place you can go, no place you can lay low. Wherever you are, I will track you down. WE will track you down.”

I recall those lyrics from this one song I heard. And if you could listen and read them… you'd understand what it's all about. And right now is that moment… that moment of fear for my captor who will go all lengths to try and find me.

After running away for so long, I had stumbled back to that same lake. That same lake I was with my brother at. That same lake where the so-called mistress followed me. I panted and looked around the forest and lake. The sun was setting and there may be no chance for me to survive out here. Especially with how hungry I was. My hunger was interrupted by a sudden fear of being watched. I slowly turned and there stood a figure. Different though. It was a man. He was walking in my direction.

“Hey buddy, you know the sun is setting right? It's not safe for you to be out here. Jeremy stalks these lakes and woods. You gotta come with me kid.”

“Who are you? Are you here to take me too?” I stuttered, looking around.

“I am Issac. And you are in dire need of help. Come. Let's-”

But before Issac could finish, something shot out of his chest. A spike shape. It was a sharpened log. And behind him was a very tall humanoid. My eyes started from the bottom and worked their way to the top. He had on massive boots, black jeans with bits of what looked to be dried up blood, a black trench coat with a blood stained white shirt in view with some holes, he wore fingerless gloves as well. And when my eyes reached to the top, his face was covered by a badly torn cloth of some kind with a face made on it. 2 holes cut out for blank eyes and on the mouth part just a circle. He tilted his head and ripped the spike out of poor Isaac, shoving him aside. I made a mad dash for it again.

The man threw the log with ease at my direction but I was able to dodge it by unknown means. He wasn't running or jogging or even power walking.  Just… walking after me. I screamed for help as the sun was shying away from my view, nightfall coming to make its appearance with confidence. The blue dark night and those lovely stars. If I wasn't running for my dear life, I would've been laying on my back, sharing this night with someone I cherished greatly. To stargaze with them. I had made the mistake of not paying attention and tripped over something. It was still light enough outside for me to see a severed arm. People have died at lake lanier and now I know why. I turned to see the brute having gotten closer and grabbed me by the throat, lifting me up. In his other hand was a large bowie knife. And before he could land the finishing blow, a loud shot ran in the air. And where I could see the eyes, blood began to seep through his mask and out as he dropped me, covering his face with what looks to be a silent scream of agony, hunched over. I backed away and turned.

“Laurence, get over here!” It was Detective Stone. “That's Jeremy!”

“What?!” I looked at him. “That.. that…. THAT BRUTE IS JEREMY?!”

“COME ON KID, I'LL EXPLAIN LATER!” He ushered me to get out of the way as he shot Jeremy again and again, each one going for a different vital point.

“He's not going down…. Detective Stone! Did you bring back up?!” I panicked as I realized Jeremy didn't bend a knee but instead started power walking towards Stone.

“No! I said I'll explain in the car! Come on!” He dragged me by the hand to his classy car. “Let me try to stop Jeremy, stay put you hear?”

And with that, he took off running back in the forest. Gunshots firing and shouting. I waited in anticipation until silence took over. I slowly got out of the car and saw that Stone left the key in the ignition. I could see far enough that it was too late. Jeremy had won this…. Right? No. To my slight joy, Detective Stone ran up the hill, holding his injured arm.

“Detective Stone!” I yelled, running to assist him.

“What the fuck are you doing? Get in the car! You'll get yourself killed!”

“Tell me what's going on… now….” I demanded.

“What you said about those Shadows, I believe you. Those creatures are connected to Jeremy somehow.” He said, looking for more bullets. “Either they are what's keeping him alive or something. But either way, Jeremy has to die tonight.”

Just then, I heard a scream. Oh that familiar scream. Bridget.

“Detective Stone that's Bridget!” I reached for the door handle to open the door and ran around the car.

“Laurence, forget her, we have to leave!” He shouted.

“Yes, Laurence,” It was a new female voice. It was soothing yet filled me with paranoia at the same time. “Just forget the girl.”

I stopped and turned to see The Mistress standing there. She waved tauntingly again. I shook my head and looked at Mr. Stone who showed the reaction that he could see her.

“I'm not leaving Bridget behind! Yes she broke my heart. But I'm not letting her blood stain on my hands or mind!”

I made a run in that direction. Bridget wasn't going to die tonight. I don’t care how much she hurt me. I won't let her die. Jeremy was definitely not going to touch her. I hurt my foot from time to time on sharp rocks and painful pinecones but I tolerated it as I was more worried about her. My ex-girlfriend. But why…. Why did I care so much? I don't know. I wish I did. I stopped when I collided with someone. It was her.

“You have to help me! Please!” She grabbed onto me.

“Bridget…” I said softly.

“Laurence….?” She eased up and looked at me.

“Bridget… I…” I couldn't find the right words. It didn't help either that Mr. Stone interrupted.

“Kid! Get up here!” He said.

“Bridget…. Go…” I said and looked at Jeremy who was lumbering towards us. “Go with Mr. Stone and get help….”

“What are you doing?” She said.

“I'm gonna buy us time.. go….” I pushed her over to the detective. “Just go ok?! Don't waste your life because of me!”

She hesitated but obeyed and ran to him. Mr. Stone wasn’t pleased. Neither was I. But I had to try. As I faced Jeremy, I slowly grew weak and tired. That same feeling I get when those figures are nearby. I trembled and started to seize up, unable to move.

“Good Work Jeremy…” It was the Mistress. She walked right next to him. “We got him right where we wanted him.”

It was a quick jab. What felt like one at least. The Mistress dug her claw into my cheek, drawing some blood. She stared into my eyes and opened her mouth really wide. Unhinged like a snake. This time it was no dream. She really was going to end me. And with that… the munchkin… the brute… and the master… all joined in to take turns. Sucking the life out of me. I thought it was over until I heard a shot ring in the air. I snapped out of it and saw Detective Stone had held a shot gun. I turned back to see a hole in the Mistress who let out a shriek as parts of my life force returned to my body. She began to fade away into black mist. Bang. Another shot that sent the munchkin into a tree, disappearing. Bang. The next shot into the Brute's head who fell on his back and poof. Literally poofed into nothingness. I looked back at the Detective who pumped the shotgun and pointed at The Master.

“Go ahead Detective…” The Master said calmly. “You're down to one shot. I know those weapons pretty well.”

“Yeah? Do you really?” He aimed the weapon at Jeremy. “What if I kill him? Two birds with one stone?”

“Very funny… Jeremy kill him.” The Master pointed and the psycho reached out, walking towards him.

Detective Stone fired one more, putting a big hole in Jeremy's chest. He lowered the gun to see that Jeremy didn't fall. My heart sank. There was just no killing the man… panic took over and I grabbed Detective Stone's wrist.

“Come on Mr. Stone!” I yelled. “We can't bring Jeremy down!”

“Kid go!” He grabbed my hand, opening it, and put his keys in my hand. “Go… take the girl and leave out of here while you still can…”

I looked at the keys and sat in thought. If I leave, those shadows would still stalk me… Jeremy will keep killing innocents who happen to wander into his zone by accident. I looked up the hill at Bridget who was standing there. She seemed to be waiting. I shook my head and looked at Stone.

“This won't fix my hauntings. I'm staying with you.”

“God damn it you're stubborn…” He laughed slightly. The laugh was short-lived when Jeremy grabbed Stone and stabbed his chest, lifting the mask to reveal a human mouth with sharp teeth, biting down on the detective's neck. He choked and shoved a thumb into the brute's eyes.

“STONE!” I held him in my arms when he fell. I couldn't… let him die… I looked up at the recovering giant as he let out a yell and lifted a rock above his head, readying to smash us apart. But my saving grace came when I heard those blessed sirens and flashing red and blue lights. Bridget must have called them.

“Heh… they arrived…” Stone said, looking the distance as SWAT came piling out of an armored truck and officers came to get Stone and I out of there.

“STAND DOWN JEREMY!” One of the SWAT shouted.

Jeremy stood there and reached for something before getting shot at by all the SWAT and some of the Officers who stood guard. I could hear Jeremy's heavy grunts as he was being rained on by the bullets. But even after all that, he didn't bend a knee. That's when I heard an officer shout something and a SWAT tossed some kind of object at the Killer. There was a sudden flash as Jeremy screamed, backing up and falling into the lake. The men shouted in triumph, knowing that the killer would drown. If even the best swimmers drowned in this cursed lake, then who's to say He won't? But we were all wrong. He rose out of the water and yelled.

“Get the boy out of here.” Detective Stone said, limping towards a boat. What was he gonna do?

“Stone! Get your ass back over here now!” The Sheriff shouted. “You're gonna get yourself killed!”

But Stone didn't listen. He started the motorboat and looked at Jeremy. The Killer didn't notice the Detective as he was too focused on us. He drove the boat's blade into Jeremy,  a sickening crunch and squelch as the blades chopped and blended his flesh and organs up like a blender. Once the motor blades stopped, there was a groan as Jeremy slowly sank into the waters… deep deep down…. And like that, Stone hopped out. Officers and Ambulance crew had to get him out. I looked to the left to see that The Master had disappeared for good. At least I had hoped so.

“Laurence…” Bridget held my hand.

“Bridget….” I looked into her eyes.

We had kept our gazes towards each other, not wanting to move. I heard a familiar voice and turned to see it was my Dad and Stepmom. I pat Bridget's hand and ran to my parents, hugging them. I was hurting severely physically but boy was I glad to see my family  again. And was even happier that I was released from the psych ward.

Bridget and I never talked again but we left on a good note. And as I have written this, I am alive and happy and feeling safe knowing that Jeremy will never hurt anyone else ever again now that He was imprisoned to the very bottom of the lake, forever in those depths. Left to become one with that cursed former town. And now that I have recovered, I was excited to tell everyone the story. My story.
