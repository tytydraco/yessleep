I never fit in. I didn't. Girls are supposed to be quiet, obedient. I was punished the most for laughing. Crying was permitted for children, but never laughter. Maybe a little here or there, but certainly not shrieking fits of excitement. It went the same way every time. My mother would send me out to play with the other girls again. The Voices were forgiving, each moment a chance to atone and repent for our prior sins. So she'd send me out and I'd try to be good, I really would, but I'd always take things a little too far. I'd get a little too rowdy in games. I'd get too amused by jokes. The sound came bursting out of me. Whatever restraint the rest of my sisters developed I couldn't seem to. 

At first it was spankings, and then beatings, and when I was old enough I spent a lot of time in the Auditorium. It was a cave a mile into the woods. Dark, terrifying. They'd leave me there overnight sometimes, lower me down and take away the rope. It was wrong to scream but I did anyway. I never learned, not really. I'd get so scared. 

Being there alone was bad. But it was worse when I wasn’t. It was always a bad night when the noises *stopped*. My screams would stop echoing. I wouldn't be able to hear my own breathing or my own footsteps. But I'd hear other noises, a misplaced pebble here, a rush of skin/fur/scale against stone. The skittering as something that wasn't human circled around me. I could swear sometimes I would feel it brush up against me, just a hint of a feeling, hard to know if it was real or imagined. 

Being in pitch black like that, your senses do weird things. I remember how stars in my vision danced and exploded like a kaleidoscope as my eyes played tricks on me.

They'd drag me up in the morning and I'd be so relieved to kiss the dirt. I can remember how the earth felt between my fingers those first moments outside, the smell of it. It's like how eating feels after you've been starving. So real, so alive.

I was sent straight back down once. It had been a bad night. I was exhausted and scared and had scraped my knee on the way up. I sat on the ground and either screamed or cried, inconsolable and immovable. My mothers tried to comfort me but I could not be appeased. They gathered, nervous, quietly conferring, until another mother came from the temple and said something to them and they lowered me back down.

I was not well when they brought me back up. It had been two days without food, and only a few sips of water in the few minutes in between my punishments. I got terribly ill, and I didn't speak a word for nearly a month. My mothers attended to me, but I could sense their quiet relief that I had finally learned. 

But I hadn't. When I was finally well enough to talk the words once again flooded out of me. I couldn't stop talking. That might have been okay, but I also did something which was forbidden: I asked some of my sisters about the Auditorium. If they had been. If they had heard noises, felt things. The mothers got wind of it and so what happened next was my fault.  

Father said so. 

My mothers couldn't decide punishments, nor, I think, did they care to. They only did as he directed. He prayed at length and said he heard from the Lost Voices. They wanted my tongue. My noise made them too hard to hear, and they demanded to be heard. 

My mother took me by the hand into the church, and sat me down in an empty wood paneled room. We drank ceremonial tea and then she left. 

That was the first time I met father. I didn't like him at all. He had hair on his face. He walked differently than my mothers did, smelled different.

It was a quick interaction, though. I could hear him whispering. The room was swimming. He put his hand under my chin and made it clear I was supposed to open my mouth. He lifted a dagger he had always had in his hand, or maybe it suddenly appeared, and he pinched my tongue between his fingers and excised it. The blade was wickedly sharp, I barely even felt it until a second later when the agonizing pain began to bloom. I couldn't even scream, as if my voice had been removed from me along with the tiny sliver of flesh.

The pain was… indescribable. Horrible. It wasn't just my mouth, it felt like my whole body was in pain, it felt like I was experiencing a lifetime of pain condensed into a pinprick of a moment. I fainted. I woke up and my mouth hurt horribly, a throbbing ache that moved in time with my heartbeat, but it was nothing compared to the first cut. 

When I open my mouth now to look at it, it's clear they cauterized it while I was unconscious. It healed well, though I hated the ritual of rinsing my mouth with salt water. It burned like acid for weeks.

I learned my lesson, or maybe it’s more accurate to say the lesson was forced upon me. I couldn't vocalize at all. There's nothing wrong with my vocal cords, medically. I can make sounds now, and even hum on key. But at the convent I couldn’t make a sound. It was at least easier for me that way. I stopped getting into trouble. I was another quiet girl behaving as a quiet girl should.

When I was older, father called me into the church. He explained my punishments as a child were my virtues, that the Voices were simply overseeing a sacred trial for me, and I was blessed by them to not be able to make a sound. He took my hand and told me it was a great honor. I was a vessel. Someday my son would have the Voices speak through him. He told me the Voices had ordained me as his consort.

The ceremony took place in the Auditorium. Before it, my mothers bathed me and anointed me with perfume, combed my hair and dressed me. In black, like the Auditorium. Some of them wept quietly as they worked, silent, eyes wide and full of tears. They left me to have a moment of quiet reflection. Perhaps my last. I had a lifetime of silence ahead of me but never again solitude. I sat, listless. I didn't enjoy living then. Not after I had lost my tongue. The laughter went out of me and so did everything else. 

One of them stayed behind and explained to me my sacred duty. 

It is going to hurt, she whispered. 

I didn't care, not really. I wrote, Nothing could hurt worse than my tongue, on a slip of paper. She looked at me then, thoughtfully, and she nodded. In hindsight, my mothers were not much older than me. Maybe ten years older, at most. Around the age that I am now. I wonder who they were sometimes. Who she was. 

I walked with them in a procession to the cave that night, our candles like fallen stars bobbing among the trees. There were makeshift stairs into the cave, which they used on Holy Days to visit the Auditorium to pray. I descended carefully. We each held a candle. The Auditorium looked so small and unfamiliar to how I remembered it, crowded with women and bathed in light. 

We stood silently. My mothers arranged themselves around me and we waited for a few minutes before my father arrived. We heard him before we saw him. Some of the mothers turned their heads so I know I wasn't imagining it. There was a rush like a hundred whispering voices, each soft but together loud. Indistinct, talking over one another. The mother who had spoken to me earlier was next to me. She leaned over slightly, and in a low voice, barely audible, a voice practiced in a lifetime of whispering, said, We've never heard them this loud. She added belatedly, It's a great honor. 

But it was the pause that said everything. She was afraid.

And then father arrived. He held no candles. He entered the cave and the whispers echoed, bouncing off the walls and multiplying. As he entered the Auditorium the voices split, somehow. It felt like each was bouncing off the walls at a different angle, the way a prism fractures light, each voice now distinct from the others, though not intelligible.

Father walked up to me and snuffed out my candle. He took it and handed it to my mother, with a meaningful glance. He said, “You all know the ritual.”

“Silence,” one of the voices wailed.

My mother seemed to shrink into herself then, clutching both my and her candle.

My father took my hand. “Into the True Church of the Lost Voices,” he said. “The Inner Sanctum. It's an honor not many are given, and none more than a few times in a lifetime.” He led me towards the back of the cave. I could feel the eyes of my mothers on me. Watching. Praying. As we walked the voices changed. 

“Bring her to me,” one hissed.

“Bring her to me,” said another.

“Bring her to me, to me, to me, me…” they chorused.

And suddenly there were a hundred voices speaking in perfect unison. “BRING HER TO ME,” they boomed.

Father's lips never moved. I was shaking like a leaf but his hand clasped mine and I didn't dare to lag behind him. It was almost comforting to have a human presence next to me, although I tried not to think of what was waiting for us in the inner sanctum.

He paused at the entrance, a narrow passageway. He pulled a box from his pocket and presented it to me. I opened it, not knowing what to expect. My mothers hadn't said anything about this extra step in the ritual. I stared at the thing in the box, not understanding. Father smiled, and leaned in and said, “It's yours. I kept it safe for you.”

The box clattered from my numb fingers. It was the shriveled remains of my tongue. Preserved all these years, kept in the temple, or maybe just in his quarters. It hit the ground. I didn't move to pick it up.

He got angry then, and the voices were chanting even more insistently. He grabbed me by the hair and dragged me into the inner sanctum. The passageway was twisting so I banged into the wall twice trying to keep him from ripping my hair out. The stone was unforgiving. I thought I might be bleeding.

The voices stayed outside. It was a surreal experience, the way they faded. It was like the cave was swallowing the sound. I couldn't hear my own breathing, nor his. He let go of my hair but the sensation of being totally alone in the dark without any sensory input was terrifying and evoked my childhood fear. I felt for him and I grabbed his arm, to have something to hold on to.

He spoke, I think, or the voices did, or maybe just one of them. The one in here felt singular. It was loud, powerful. I couldn't tell where it was coming from, but it said, “She's here.”

It paused. “She is not whole.”

It paused again. I could feel father take a deep breath, but if he spoke I didn't hear it.

“NO,” it boomed. “She must be whole. You must try again.”

And then he jerked away from me. I think he was ripped away by something, it was so fast and forceful. The next thing I felt was a spray of something warm and wet. Without father there I turned and ran.

“Try again,” the voices screamed. “Try again.”

I burst into the auditorium and fell into the arms of my mothers.

The one who had spoken to me before, the one who stood next to me, had picked up the box. She pressed it into my hand, clasping hers over mine.

“Amelia,” a voice said, light, feminine, different from the other voices, but disturbingly familiar. “Run.”

And then with a feeling like I had been punched in the throat, I began to scream. It hurt. My throat felt like it was on fire, it felt like I had swallowed broken glass. The screaming made it worse, it was so painful, but after years of silence I was more scared to stop for fear I would never start again. 

And I was terrified. The voices were shattered again, a hundred echoes, each unmistakably angry. The noise was overwhelming. I scrambled for the stairs. It was more like a ladder. I climbed the rungs with one hand, the other clutching the box to my chest. It wasn't ladylike but I didn't care. I did my best not to trip on my skirt which was completely in the way. I got up out of the Auditorium before I turned to look. 

My mothers were all staring towards the inner sanctum. I couldn't hear anything but they must have, down there. One fell, bleeding. Then the screaming started. Human screams, but not as many as you would expect given the number of people. The candles started flickering out as they were dropped. I could have sworn I saw one snuff out on its own, but the scene was chaotic. It could have been a draft of air. 

The room darkened quickly in the span of a few seconds as the candles snuffed out. My mothers hadn't expected me and hadn't followed me up, or even in the direction of the stairs. This wasn't how the ritual was supposed to go. It had taken them by surprise.

The one closest to me glanced up and saw me. She mouthed, Go, and quickly pried the ladder from where it was crudely affixed to the wall. Gravity had mostly been holding in place, but it was a tall wooden structure. She must have been fueled by pure adrenaline.

The ladder toppled and the rest of the lights went out within seconds. I could hear rustling, and weeping, and a couple of piercing screams cut short.

I stood paralyzed for a moment, staring into the void, facing my childhood fear. 

When all the sounds cut out, I turned and ran. 

The cave opening leading to the auditorium was dark. I fell twice before I got close enough to the entrance that the starlight could guide me. I burst into the forest running at full speed.

The night is never really that dark, not even during a new moon. I could see as clear as day after being in a cave. I hesitated as I took the path towards home. There were at best a few girls around my age, but nobody who would know what to do. That had always been father. In his absence one of the mothers, maybe, but they were trapped in the cave. I didn't want to think about what happened to them. So I kept going. The adrenaline only got me so far. There was a dirt road that connected our home to…somewhere else. We got deliveries from outside, I didn't know where. But strangers came with things in their truck every month. I walked it. I walked the road until I hit a smooth road, wider, paved. Something I had never seen before. It stretched to the left and to the right. East and west. I knew that much. And I knew the sun rose to the east so that was the direction I picked. Towards the sun, towards light. I walked and I kept walking. All night. It was a few hours to go maybe a dozen miles. 

In the end I don't know if it mattered. I could have probably sat by the side of the road and been picked up by the same older couple and gotten to town in the same amount of time. But something about the walk was cathartic although it was terrifying. Leaving home was a punishable offense. How far you strayed would have dictated how severely you were punished.

Every step was liberating, but I was at the same time fueled by panic. The look in my mother's eyes when she told me to go. The substance splattered all over my face that I was trying not to notice, that looked black in the low light but smelled like copper.

So I walked and walked, following the dark ribbon of the road as it curved through fallow fields without a building in sight. 

The sun started to rise as I walked. The hum of the insects died down and birds began to call. I heard a loud yet soft noise, like a shout that carried a far distance. It grew louder as it approached. I stood stock still in panic. It was a pickup truck.

I stared, clutching the box I still held. I recognized it as a truck but I hadn't known they could move so fast.

A man got out of the cab pointing a gun at me. I didn't really know what that was either, so it didn't scare me more than I already was.

“The power of Christ compels you,” he shouted, advancing slowly. “I'm warning you, I'm armed, and I don't take kindly to ghosts… oh shit. Mary? Mary, what do those cult girls look like?”

A woman stepped out of the cab as well, rubbing her tired eyes.

“Oh, no, honey,” she said. "What happened to you? Is somebody hurt? Did somebody die?”

I stared, my eyes darting between the man and the woman.

“Holler if you can understand me,” the man said slowly. “What's your name, sweetie?”

I shook my head.

“Do you have a name?” I shook my head.

He took a step closer and I shied away.

“Put the gun down, for God's sake,” Mary scolded. She came up to me and I let her. She was older than any woman I'd ever seen. I thought she must be ancient, but she reminded me of my mothers.

She touched my face, gently.

“Are you hurt?” She asked.

I shook my head.

“This isn't your blood?”

I shook my head.

“Can you speak?”

I shook my head a third time and opened my mouth. She recoiled. “My God,” she said. “We're taking you to the sheriff.”

I didn't want to be in the truck with the man. I shied away when she tried to get me to climb up into the cab. She eventually relented and put me in the bed of the truck, with a stern warning that I'd hurt myself if I tried to climb out while they were moving.

I was fascinated. I stared down over the side of the truck bed and watched the pavement go whizzing by. 

After that it was all kind of a blur. They brought me to town, and it was similar but completely different to home. There were buildings, but some clearly served other purposes than a dormitory or a temple. They were all colors, and made of materials I didn’t recognize.

Mary and her husband whisked me into a building. It was a strange building, all desks and people in brown uniforms. They had a lot of things that I didn’t know what they were.

But from there they took me to a smaller room, quieter and less chaotic, which helped because the noise of so many people talking so loudly made me feel hazy and ill. Mary insisted a woman come talk to me. She stayed with me and would have held my hand, but I needed them to write. I explained what had happened, page after page. The woman took them as I finished them, scanned them, and asked me a continuous stream of questions that I struggled to answer before she asked the next. After a little while she took a stack of my writing and brought it outside. She came back to sit down and I went through my story.

Mary cried when she read about my tongue and how it ended up in the box. She wanted to hug me but she cried so loudly it scared me, and besides which, I was busy writing. I had never been encouraged to write before. I knew how to put letters on paper to form words, the mothers taught us and I used notes to communicate when it was necessary, but there was something about being able to express myself fully in as many words as I chose that - even though at the time I didn't know many - was incredibly liberating.

The sheriff went and rounded up all the girls and brought them to the station. It wasn’t going very well until I explained the noise was too much and they needed to be quiet. My sisters were frightened out of their wits. I think I would have been too if I hadn’t still been in shock. I don’t know if I know how to explain what it was like. People talked so loudly and so freely that it seemed… indecent. It was as if we had been invited into a town of nudists. The culture shock was immense.

None of the mothers made it. This was much more shocking to my sisters than to me, but I had seen what happened. The police officers asked me a lot of questions about what I saw. They didn’t press me too hard, though, and they disregarded most of what I said about the Voices.

It was very chaotic for a time, but it settled. They aren't sure about my past. All I remember is the church, but they don't believe I am blood related to anyone there. They suspect many of us, especially the younger girls, were kidnapping victims. I took the name Amelia. I believe that was always my name, but I don't know for sure. 

I was placed into a foster home while I worked on my GED. I learned how to use a computer and then I took a lot of online classes, which was easier for me. From there I got an associates degree and a job I could do from home, first medical transcription, and then medical billing. I eventually ended up moving out to the country. I bought a small house. I had lived for years in town, happy enough, but I enjoyed being in nature more. I enjoyed the solitude. I do a lot of reading and writing. Sometimes one or the other of my sisters will come visit. Many of them stuck together in smaller groups, going to this college or that, moving to the same city together. But I had always been a little apart. First I was too rambunctious, then too despondent, and finally, in a quirk of fate, too quiet. I enjoy their visits but only for short periods of time. Most of them recovered very well, and seem like very normal young women. They have to readjust to the quietude of my country life when they come here, and even then they are too loud for me sometimes. 

Not long after I first moved to my house, I had a night where the noise cut out. I was washing dishes and I had to double check if the faucet was still running. I was unsettled, but managed to get to sleep and by the morning convinced myself that it was imagined, a daydream or a lingering symptom of trauma.

I started hearing whispers. My TV would have an echo, or I'd put on my headphones and swear someone was talking over my music, but only occasionally, infrequently. Once every few months.

And then one night, I awoke to a scraping noise. I screamed but no sound came out. I lay in my bed, in abject terror, reliving the darkness and the blood and the sacrifice of those many years ago. The darkness felt claustrophobic, like it was rushing in to smother me. My chest was tight. I was trapped in a nightmare I couldn’t wake up from. The silence was oppressive and inescapable.

When I thought I would shatter if I had to take any more, I heard the Voices of the Lost. They whispered to me, secret upon secret in their prismatic tones, all while scraping, twining around the house. The sound was a relief, like a pressure valve had been thrown.

The many voices belonged to one being. It was relieved it had found me. It had been looking for me, all this time.

It had never wanted my tongue, only my voice. Father was a wicked man who used the Voices for his own gain. He twisted their words to his own ends. I had been chosen to carry the Voices, not as a consort nor as a mother.

But it needed me whole.

It visits every once in a while. I don’t know its shape but I know something of its size. I can hear it when it comes, and it’s long; long enough to wrap around my house and then some. The scrapes on my siding extend up to the second story windows. 

I asked to see it one time, and it disapproved. It instead explained its lineage and purpose to me, something neither good nor evil but not entirely benign. I would describe its existence as perpendicular to ours, intersecting but never aligned.

I have my tongue still, in a safe deposit box at the bank, because I don't know how to store such a thing but neither do I know how to throw it away. I could retrieve it at any time. The Voices say if I place it in my mouth, it can restore my voice to me. But I am scared to accept its call, its siren song. I would gain my voice, but with it would come terrible responsibility. I would cease to be Amelia. I would become Lia for a while, as I integrated two beings into one, and the whispers would shroud me like they once did father. But I would become something else after that, something greater than he was, something unrecognizable.

Life is long, and I take pleasure in my simple country life. I even welcome the visits from the Voices. They disturb me less as time goes on; it becomes easier for me to parse the many overlapping threads of our conversations. Sometimes if I listen carefully, I can start to sense something akin to a harmony, not of sound, but of thought. There are ideas that can only be conveyed as a multiplex. The individual thoughts combine and create relationships, higher order meanings.

The longer I speak with it, the more I get a sense of complacency from it. I think it perceives time differently. It does not seem hurried, nor even intent on convincing me. I think it already knows my answer. Not now, not next year, but I think in the future I join it, and lose myself. I become the Voices, no longer lost.
