You have to tell someone what's eating away at you from the inside, at least that's what my therapist thinks I should do.

Instead of doing what my therapist wants, I usually just drink until I pass out, but this time I'm willing to try and do what she wants even though I'm not expecting too feel better afterwards. 

Thankfully, I can go back to drinking if this doesn't work out, the bottles of hard liquor don't really help my mind heal, but they do help it forget a thing or two, which is more than I could wish for.

I'm sure it's better if I stop beating around the bush, so let me start at the beginning.

*I checked my mailbox, in the middle of the annoying bills was something that immediately caught my attention.*

*It was an unusual piece of paper, it looked like a birthday card or greeting card, I never get those, so I was understandably confused.*

*I examined the card, a handwritten message on it read as follows:*

*Hello there friend, nice to meet ya!*

*Even though I'm not here to greet ya!*

*After all, I'm a busy man.*

*Don't worry, for you, I have a truly wonderful plan!*

*Outstanding my trick will be.*

*Frightened, it might make you, causing you to flee.*

*Forever in your memory this night's trickery will be etched, I already told you what I plan to do, alas, you don't understand me yet.*

*I didn't have a strong opinion about it, but I saved the greeting card anyway, It was so out of place that it made me chuckle.*

*Hours passed and night came, It was a normal night just like any other, my brother came over so we can watch a movie and share some family-only weed infused brownies I stashed up for us.*

*Before we could even finish the movie, my brother got a call from his girlfriend, his carefree expression was gone in an instant, it was replaced with a serious look as he ended the quick phone call.*

*He said his girlfriend told him she was pretty sure someone tried opening her front door, she heard the familiar sound of the door handle jiggling.*

*She inspected the door, but no one was there, nonetheless she asked my brother to keep her company for the night.*

*My brother told me he's sorry for cutting our movie night short, but I didn't mind, I'd do the same in his position.*

*He quickly got ready and told me it's better if I start eating the brownies, he won't be back until tomorrow morning anyway.*

*I took him up on that offer and threw him my spare set of keys and told him I'll be waiting for him.*

*My brother left and I started nibbling the brownies, before I knew it I ate four of them.*

*About two hours flew by and I was as high as a kite, getting up was an almost impossible task because I felt like I fused with the couch.*

*Nothing better than going to sleep when stoned out of your mind, so that's what I decided to do.*

*I think say I was asleep for about an hour, but then I was woken up by the front door unlocking.*

*Even though I was still dazed by the brownies, I immediately thought it was weird that my brother already came back here.*

*Groggily, I called out to my brother.*

*No response.*

*I did the same once again.*

*No response.*

*Finally my brother appeared, he awkwardly peeked around the corner, only the top part of his head was visible, his eyes staring blankly.*

*I called out to him once more.*

*He didn't blink, his eyes still stared into nothingness.*

*I used the last of my willpower to break though the potent weed's grasp and get up, slowly I walked towards my brother and yet he didn't move.*

*As soon as I was an inch away from him, he quickly shifted back and disappeared from my sight.*

*Extremely confused, I took a couple of more steps, I was sure my brother was going to jump out and scream "Boo!" like it was some kind of messed up prank.*

*I was wrong.*

*At the front door stood a tall, lanky man wearing a black suit and a purple tie, a purple mask that looked almost claylike was covering his face, the masked looked like a surprised or confused face, the index finger of his right hand pointed at me.*

*In his left hand he held my brother's dismembered head.*

*I felt like the effects of the marijuana were substituted by a different sensation in mere seconds, my body felt like it turned into a block of ice, I couldn't speak, move or think, even breathing was something I could barely manage to do at that moment.*

*I wish I could've been of any more use, but instead of trying to fight off the maniacal intruder, I just stood there, breathing heavily, trying to process what I just saw.*

*The intruder approached me, still frozen in place, I couldn't react in any way.*

*He took something that looked like a sticker out of his pocket, I couldn't even see clearly what it was.*

*He slowly put it on my chest.*

*A second later he crudely dropped my brother's head on the ground and waved at me, then then he swiftly exited my home.*


I told you everything, exactly as my therapist wanted.

Honestly, as I expected, telling you this didn't really help me feel any better.

Maybe because I left out some minor detail, the therapist did say I shouldn't skip anything.
Fine, do you want to know what the intruder put on my chest?

It was indeed a sticker, written on it in bold purple letters was "Gotcha".
