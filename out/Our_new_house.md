It was early Friday morning, I make my way to the kitchen passing the last 10 years worth of belongings packed up and ready for the big house move today.
I feel a sense of sadness mixed with happiness "it's a much needed fresh start" I say to myself and smile, The last 2 years had been the worst of my life and I couldnt wait to leave it behind. 

Suddenly my thoughts are interrupted by the joyful call coming from upstairs, "mummy, mummy" a huge smile spreads across my face! My cheeky little 2 year old Harry "I will be up in a minute darling" I shouted back, "this is going to be fun" I think to myself. 
I'd never moved with a toddler before, I have planned how I would do this for the last month with my husband James, I spent a week helping him pack and helped him bring everything downstairs so he could work with our moving guy Jim to get everything loaded quickly and I would have some much needed one on one time with Harry. 

After a few hours of shopping for cleaning supplies and having McDonald's me and Harry headed to our new home ahead of James, excited but nervous I put the keys into the door and swing it open "wow" Harry shouts, he's now fighting to get out of his stroller "hold on lets get inside first" but he's already got his arms out of the straps and now he's aiming to free himself entirely! 

The rest of the day went by so quickly, working side by side to get as much done as possible, by the time it was 8 o'clock we was all exhausted. I cleaned the bathroom and run Harry a bath "I'm so tired but I have to keep his routine" I say to James who is stood holding a very tired Harry "you know it's OK to just slip from the routine for one night? We're all shattered" I don't even need to say anything my stern look said it for me "ok ok, ill get his pj's ready" James places Harry next to me and walks to Harry's new bedroom. 

I'm woken at 3:43am by a lullaby playing loudly "that's strange, did I not turn his TV off"  I think to myself, I usually turn his TV off when he's been asleep for an hour so it doesn't cause him to wake during the night. 
Half asleep I get out of bed, the bedroom is freezing to the point I can see my breath, I shudder and make my way to Harry's doorway. 
The TV is as I thought off and I can't hear the lullaby anymore so I began to think the exhaustion was causing me to subconsciously hear his lullaby whilst in a light sleep. 

The next week is a flurry of unpacking, arranging items and discussing decorating, our house is a lovely 3 story victorian build, it's got a lot of original features which have been covered by decades of bad paint jobs! 
Sat on the upper landing I began to strip the wallpaper, 6 layers deep I see an old piece of paper fall down, it's orange tones catch my eye. 
Its very fragile, my first thought was it was very old wallpaper until I picked it up and saw faded writing "do not remove" the cursive was spectacular and not something you really see anymore but I assume this was probably a note like handle with care and go about finishing my task at hand. 

I finally reach the original walls, still adorned with hand painted wallpaper, I take a step back and stare in awe at it wondering how many people have seen this in it's original glory rather than old ad faded. 
I'm snapped out my wonder by the stairs creaking, thinking James was coming up to see the mess I'd made but there was no one. "James are you ok" I shout down, silence..... "Hunnie are you OK?" this time the silence was broken "mummy" I froze!  That wasn't Harry's voice and it was coming from his room, I feel the drop in temperature, goosebumps engulf my entire body I feel the hairs on my neck standing up too scared to turn round and too scared to run. 

I feel a small hand touch my leg "mummy" I continue to stare straight ahead "mummmmmmy" the tiny hand is now firmly squeezing my knee, Im stuck frozen unable to move or shout but my arm starts to move downwards towards this unseen hand! My mind screaming to stop but its like my arm is no longer part of my body, I close my eyes tears dripping down my face as my hand touches something ice cold, an electric shock rips through my body and I hear that lullaby loudly in my head. "mummy, my mummy". 

My phone ringing cuts through the static, I Immediately snap back into reality it's James I manage to speak "Hello?"
"it's about time I've rang you 6 times, they don't have hunters chicken is there anything you'd like for tea" he sounds annoyed and I can hear Harry in the background chanting for bananas "oh urh anything really, you pick"
After the boys get home I don't say anything to James I know he doesn't "believe" I try to convince myself I must of fallen asleep on the floor. 

That night in the bath I notice my knee is sore to touch, a small cluster of bruises forming..... Little finger sized bruises.

I see my breath, the water suddenly freezing! The water splashes in front of me "my mummy"
