The first flutter was on a Tuesday.

I was sitting at my desk, staring at a spreadsheet that had long since dissolved into a sea of meaningless numbers, when I felt it. A tiny, bubbling sensation, deep in the lower part of my belly. Like a goldfish gently bumping against the glass of its bowl.

I froze, my fingers hovering over the keyboard. It came again. A soft, insistent pop.

Gas, I told myself. It’s just gas. You had that questionable Thai food for lunch.

But the Thai food had been two days ago, and this felt… different. Deliberate.

That night, lying in the dark of my one-bedroom apartment, I pressed my hand against my stomach. It was firm, a little bloated maybe, but normal. Then I felt it—a distinct, rolling motion, a slow shift of weight from one side to the other. It wasn't gas. Gas doesn't have mass. This did.

A cold dread, thick and oily, began to seep into my veins. I was a thirty-four-year-old man. This was impossible.

The next morning, I went to see Dr. Evans. He was a good guy, pragmatic, with a calming, no-nonsense demeanor. I sat on the crinkly paper of the examination table, my shirt off, feeling absurd.

“So, what seems to be the problem, Alex?” he asked, washing his hands at the sink.

“I think… I think there’s something in my stomach,” I said, the words sounding insane the moment they left my mouth.

He raised an eyebrow. “Something you swallowed? A foreign object?”

“No. Not like that. It’s… alive. I can feel it moving.”

Dr. Evans did his due diligence. He poked and prodded, listened with his stethoscope, ordered an ultrasound. The technician smeared cold gel on my abdomen and moved the wand around, her face a mask of professional neutrality. On the screen, I saw the grainy, black-and-white landscape of my own insides—the shadow of my liver, the pulsing of my aorta, a blurry glimpse of my intestines.

“See?” Dr. Evans said, pointing at the screen. “Nothing there. No blockages, no masses. Everything looks perfectly normal.”

“But I can feel it,” I insisted, a desperate edge creeping into my voice.

He gave me a kind, pitying smile. “Stress, Alex. It can do incredible things to the body. Manifest in physical sensations. I’m prescribing you a mild anti-anxiety medication. Try it for a few weeks, and let’s see if these… sensations… subside.”

I took the pills. They made me feel fuzzy and disconnected, like I was watching my life through a pane of dirty glass. But they did nothing to stop the movements. If anything, they grew stronger. The goldfish was becoming an eel, slithering and coiling in the dark, warm cavity of my body.

And then, it started to grow.

It was subtle at first. The slight tightness of my belt. The way my t-shirts stretched a little tighter across my midsection. Within a month, there was no denying it. A low, hard swell had developed below my navel. A bump. A protrusion.

I stopped going to the gym. I started wearing baggy hoodies, even in the sweltering summer heat. My friends noticed.

“Dude, you putting on a little dad bod?” Mark joked, clapping me on the shoulder at a bar.

I flinched away. “Just a bit of bloat.”

The thing inside me didn’t like being jostled. It would recoil, and then lash out with a sudden, sharp kick that made me gasp. The movements were no longer gentle flutters. They were jabs. Rolls. Hiccups. I could feel its sleep-wake cycles, its periods of frantic activity and its times of unnerving stillness.

I started doing research. Desperate, late-night Google searches in the blue glow of my laptop. "Male pregnancy." "Cryptic pregnancy." "Foreign body sensation delusion." The last one led me down a rabbit hole to a word that made my blood run cold: Couváde Syndrome. A psychological condition where a sympathetic partner experiences the symptoms of pregnancy.

But I had no partner. Sarah had left me six months ago. There was no one to be sympathetic for.

This was something else. Something new.

One night, lying in bed, I felt a rhythmic, fluttering pulse deep inside, right where the thing was nestled. It was too fast to be my own heartbeat. It was a tiny, frantic drumbeat.

Thump-thump-thump-thump.

A fetal heartbeat.

That’s when the whispers started. Not from the room, but from inside my own head. A soft, sibilant voice that wasn't my own.

Warm, it whispered. Safe.

I screamed and clamped my hands over my ears, but it was useless. The voice was coming from in here.

My apartment began to feel alien. The shadows in the corner of my bedroom seemed to congeal into a tall, watchful presence. I started calling it the Watcher. It was there to observe the miracle, or the monstrosity. I was never sure which. Sometimes, from the kitchen, I’d hear the faint, metallic shink of a knife being drawn from a block, but when I’d run in, panting, everything would be in its place.

The voice inside me grew more articulate.

Hungry, it would say, and a specific, bizarre craving would bloom in my mind—the taste of wet charcoal, the salty tang of a battery, the sweet rot of overripe peaches. I’d find myself in the grocery store, staring at a bag of charcoal briquettes, my mouth watering.

They don’t understand, the voice cooed. They are not chosen. You are the vessel.

“Vessel for what?” I sobbed one night, curled on the bathroom floor.

For the new world, it replied, its tone one of absolute, serene certainty.

I was losing time. I’d come to, standing in the nursery section of a department store, my hand resting on a tiny, yellow onesie. I had no memory of driving there. The Watcher in the shadows of my home was now following me out into the world, a flicker of darkness just at the edge of my vision.

I quit my job. I stopped answering my phone. My world shrank to the four walls of my apartment and the growing, living entity inside me. My body was changing in ways that defied biology. My stomach was now a taut, unmistakable dome. My senses were heightened; I could smell the chlorine in the tap water, hear the electrical current humming in the walls. My skin felt stretched and thin as parchment.

I was a man, clearly, undeniably pregnant.

The due date, a concept that formed with inexplicable certainty in my mind, was approaching. The whispers became a constant, guiding narrative.

Soon, the voice promised. Soon you will be empty, and I will be full. The gate will open.

I didn’t know what that meant, and the terror of it kept me paralyzed. What was I going to give birth to? A messiah? A monster? A new plague upon the earth?

The pain started on a Thursday. Not the sharp kicks, but a deep, grinding, rhythmic ache that started in my lower back and wrapped around my swollen middle. Contractions.

The voice was silent now. It was preparing.

For three days, the pains came and went, growing closer together, more intense. I didn’t call for help. Who could I call? An ambulance? What would I say? “Hello, I’m a man in active labor, please send a paramedic and an exorcist”?

On the third night, the storm broke. The pain was astronomical, a universe of agony contained within my body. I was on my bed, drenched in sweat, my vision blurring. I could feel it, the immense, undeniable pressure of something descending. Something moving down, ready to be born.

The Watcher stood in the corner of the room, a pillar of solid darkness. I could feel its anticipation.

With a final, tearing scream that ripped from my throat, I felt a catastrophic, wet release. A sense of profound, horrifying emptiness.

It was over.

I lay there, panting, weeping, waiting for the cry of a newborn or the gibbering of an abomination.

There was only silence.

Slowly, trembling in every limb, I looked down.

There was no baby. No monster. No blood. No afterbirth.

My stomach was flat. Completely, utterly normal. The massive, hard dome was gone as if it had never been.

The physical evidence of my pregnancy had vanished in an instant.

But on the sheets between my legs, there was a single, small object. I reached for it, my hand shaking so badly I could barely grasp it.

It was a small, smooth, grey river stone. Still warm from the inside of my body.

From the corner of the room, the Watcher dissipated, its purpose fulfilled. The voice in my head was gone. The apartment was silent, save for my ragged, broken breaths.

I held the stone in my palm. It was just a rock. Meaningless.

But as I stared at it, a final, fleeting whisper echoed in the hollowed-out cavern of my mind, the last vestige of the presence that had inhabited me for nine months.

The seed is planted.

I sit here now, in a different apartment. The doctors call it a psychotic break, a uniquely elaborate somatic delusion rooted in my schizophrenia, likely triggered by the trauma of my breakup and the loneliness that followed. They say the brain, under immense stress, can manufacture any sensation, any belief. They have me on a powerful antipsychotic. The Watcher hasn't returned. The voice is silent.

They gave me the stone back after my evaluation. They thought it was a comfort object. I keep it in a small wooden box on my dresser.

Most days, I can almost believe them. Most days, I can function.

But sometimes, late at night, I take the stone out of the box. I hold its cool, smooth weight in my hand. And I feel a terrible, undeniable truth.

It’s warmer than it should be. And if I press it to my ear, I can just barely hear it—a faint, slow, and steady thump-thump-thump.
