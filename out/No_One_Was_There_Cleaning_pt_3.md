Lemme start by saying this, I absolutely HATE hospitals; being surrounded by Typhoid Mary's dying of one disease or another, the condescending look the doctor gives you when you dare disagree with their “diet and exercise” prognosis, and, of course, the huge debt-inducing bill that follows if you don't have insurance. My family avoided hospitals like the plague and only went if it was life or death.  “If the bone’s showing, we're going,” my mom would say. To this day I don't go to a hospital unless I'm seconds from death or the issue doesn't go away with a little duct tape or whiskey. Hospital's absolutely suck and I'm pleased to say this story ends with me burning this house of ill to the ground and pissing on the ashes!

Okay, I'll start over. I work at a clean up service that keeps scenes from becoming crime scenes. No body, no blood, no problem; it's like nothing was there. Well, today I got called to go to this abandoned asylum and clean up another cult gathering. Apparently the leader of this cult found out a part of his “flock” had gone rogue and were trying to bring the end times faster, I don't know. It was less than ten days since my last run-in with some cult stuff and, per my boss’s vehement instructions, I'm still wearing the weird pendant he gave me and my co-workers. I was working this call myself since our last new guy died so I planned on being there most of the night. 

The asylum looked like it was straight out of a horror film or some ghost hunter show, three stories with shattered or boarded up windows, overgrown and dead shrubs against and climbing the walls, patches of dead grass littering what used to be a spanning courtyard, the usual. There was a huge steeple with a large cross on the roof with huge open windows surrounding an empty room. I figured there used to be a bell there, like a church bell, and they removed it when the place closed down. I pushed open the front doorway and learned very quickly I was wrong; the bell was sitting in a crater right in front of the entryway, a rope dangling uselessly from the yoke. My eyes slowly scanned up to see the multiple floors above the bell had apparently crashed through before planting itself in the lobby. I shimmied around the bell, careful not to disturb it any more than it already was, inspecting any design on it.

The fall must've been recent since, unlike everywhere else in this room, the bell was clear of any vandalism. It was green, probably from the passage of time, with no design or decoration to it. The face was completely smooth, aside for the scratches from the fall and raised bumps from the rust. I looked up at the rope and noticed the snapped end wasn't cut or worn by time, it was burned and still glowing from the smallest strand sticking out from the weaved threads.

“Howdy,” a cheery man's voice called from the dark.
“Jesus H!” I cried out, jumping back from the bell and dropping my cleaning caddy. The resulting clatter made me jump again as my silicone bristle brush fell out of the bag. “Geez.. Sorry dude, I didn't know anyone else was here.”

“Sorry,” he replied calmly. He stepped closer into the light of the full moon and I got a better view of him as I retrieved my caddy and brush.

The guy looked like he was trying to mirror Charles Manson with dark, unkempt hair and trimmed beard. I swear to the gods, he was wearing a white, linen robe with a golden tie around his waist and bare feet. He walked with his arms still at his sides, his palms facing me, bent slightly at the elbows.

“I heard the door open and I thought maybe Ryder came back,” he continued, watching me with dark blue eyes staring into my soul.

“Who's Ryder?” I asked, glancing back at the door. When I looked back, he was stood right in front of me. I barely heard him move.

“Ryder is the Prophet. He speaks for Pluto.”

“Right, Pluto, cool, so… is the mess here or… is it-?”

“Oh, you're the cleaner he called. He said you would be here.” His voice was way too even, too calm. He turned slowly, said over his shoulder, “Follow me,” and strode back into the dark.

I followed in silence, trying to keep up but he was always just barely in sight. I'd open a door and he'd be just turning a corner or closing all other behind him. The further we got into the asylum, the darker it got. The graffiti on the walls became more and more sparse, eventually replaced by sigils and symbols that looked almost familiar but I didn't stop to look at them properly. Every time I looked away from him, he'd vanish and I'd run to catch up again. I recognized one even by the fleeting glance of running past it. 

A small white dot followed by eight dark circles growing larger in a spiralling pattern, leading to a larger white sun on the center. It looked like the pendant I showed Bossman after the new kid died. My hand snuck up to the pendant around my neck and grasped it tightly, like a lifeline anchoring me to whatever reality I was in.
I followed him through one more door and ended up in a dark room. There was nowhere else to go, and no one else around.

“Hey, guy!” I called, my voice echoing around me. “Where'd ya go?” I turned to open the door behind me but the handle wouldn't turn. A metallic clatter came from the other side, like the door handle fell on the floor, locking me in.

“Crap,” I whispered and turned back to the room, rummaging through my caddy for a flashlight or headlamp. Oh, thank goodness, I thought as I felt the elastic of my headlamp hook around my finger.
I chastised myself for not putting it on sooner as I snapped it into place and clicked the switch on. The room I stood in was a chapel, the cross laid on the floor between rows of pews, replaced on the wall by a large, handmade painting of a solar system. The sun a bright white glow in the center, eight circles of various sizes and colors spiralling out toward a glowing blue speck in the distance. I stepped over the prone cross carefully, glancing at the dead bodies laid out on the pews, each one in similar robes to Manson-Guy. All the pews had blood pooling in carved symbols reminiscent to the ones outside.

There was a stage in the front of the room, a pulpit centered with a small, leather bound book sat closed on it. Unlike everything else around, the book was free of dust and debris so it obviously didn't belong. I lifted the book off the pulpit and stuffed it into my caddy.

“Might as well get started,” I spoke aloud, setting the caddy next to the pulpit and began cleaning up. I took the painting down first, rolling it up and stuffing it in a trash bag. I made an attempt to put the cross back but its size was too much for me to lift alone. I decided to just wear the braces and wall down a bit to make it look like it fell on its own, kinda like the bell. A light dusting here and there, the stage looked like no one had touched it, not even me.

“Now the pews,” I said and turned around to be face to face with that Manson guy. He was so close, I'm surprised we weren't touching. I caught my breath and realized I couldn't hear him breathe, I didn't smell anything outside the musty, abandoned building, his eyes didn't even move.

“H-hey, guy” I stammered, my voice betraying my fear. “ I, uh, I gotta f-finish cleaning up, s-so-”

He cut me off, “Pluto is coming.”

“Y-yeah, I… I know. We d-don't want this place to be so messy when he gets here so I'll just…” I took a step back and stepped around him, his body following me as I walked. Not just his head watching me, no, his whole body was facing me as I moved. I ran into a pew as I watched him, blinked suddenly in pain and when I looked back, he was gone. There was no trace he was even there except his bare footprints in the dust. No footprints leading to them, or away, just sat in the middle of the aisle. I let out a slow, shaky breath and went back to work.

I lifted seven body in a fireman's carry and piled them next to the door. I'll have to figure out how to get the gurney in here around that bell and cart them all out, I thought. But that has to wait until I figure out how to open this damn door. I pushed on it slightly, hoping it swang out as well as in, but no luck. I sighed, resigning myself to what I knew, destroying blood stains and refurbishing things to their decrepit state.

Slathering on the wood mixture, scoring it to look weathered and splintering, I studied the sigils to remember how they looked. One that appeared more than once was an upside down cross with a hollow circle resting on top. It kinda looked like the symbol for female but not entirely. One looked the same but an umbrella-like shape instead of a circle. Another also looked like some football team's mascot icon, some kind of ram head or something. I thought to take pictures but my phone was in my pants pocket and my painter's suit completely covered me so I couldn't reach for it. Guess I have to rely on my memory this time. 
“Alright,” I muttered, “pews are done, cross is… collapsed but explained, blood never happened. Floors just need dusted and I gotta get out of here. Gods, I gotta pi-AHH!”

A sharp, stabbing pain pierced my side, forcing me to collapse on the freshly puttied pew. I looked down to see a dagger sticking out of me, blood staining my painter's suit and sticking the fabric to my skin. 
“We only needed one more,” Manson guy's voice spoke from the dark. “One more life to give to Pluto so he may come back to us and purge the Earth of the unworthy.”

I felt his presence step past me and his body glided to the stage, standing behind the pulpit. His feet barely moved or touched the floor. Ah, great, I thought. He's a ghost. I hated dealing with ghosts, they're such dicks. He raised his hands to the ceiling, thunder crashing outside, as he spoke loudly, this time with actual emotion.

“Oh, great Pluto! We, your children, beg your return! We give you our eight lives so you may regain your reign over the mortal cool! Rise from the pits, join us from the darkness, FREE US I COMMAND!”

I crawled across the floor as Manson begged and commanded, the sudden storm crashing outside. The door got closer with every inch, Manson's screaming getting more and more deranged the further away I got. A glow began to build behind me, casting a faint shadow on the floor below me. I kept my eyes forward and crawled, afraid to look behind me. Just get to the door, I thought. Don't worry, as long as it's still in, you can't bleed-

Shlack! The dagger was ripped from my side and flew behind me with a giant of wind. I dropped my head to the floor and sighed heavily. “Dammit,” I muttered but kept crawling. The door grew larger as I got closer, the glow behind me getting so bright it outshone my headlamp. In the shine, I noticed and remembered the broken door handle. My body grew colder as the sped up blood loss finally hit me, tunnel vision starting to blur in my periphery. Manson's voice sounded so far away as he belted his praise and demands, but I didn't stop crawling.

My parents disowned me, my friends and family abandoned me, I don't have anything outside this stupid job and my stupid apartment. But one thing is for God DAMN sure.

“I,” I wheezed, slapping my hand on the floor in front of me. “Will.” I pulled myself forward painfully. “Not.” My other hand slapped down. “Die.” Pull. “Here!”

I finally reached the door. I pushed on the wood with what little strength I had left, only stressing it enough to make noise but not enough to open. I rolled on my back, staring through the little opening with what little vision I had left. I saw bare feet appear on the other side and face the door. I was delirious but I could tell they weren't Manson's.

“Help,” I wheezed, my vision growing darker despite the blinding glow before me. I looked up at the scene before me just as the door blew open and a pair of hands reached out, grabbed me by the shoulders and dragged me away. The glow emanated from a large, white, ovaloid orb growing in the center of the large room. It moved slowly as my rescuer pulled me away and I saw the beginnings of a dark blue iris turning toward me.
The door slammed shut as soon as I was out of the room and a blasting noise came from the other side. A deep, guttural roar came from behind the rattling door and suddenly my body didn't hurt as much. I stumbled to my knees and, with the aid of the unknown hands around my midsection, I ran toward the door, following their pulling lead until I saw the glowing moon behind the opened door and collapsed bell. A crack of lightning struck the steeple, sparking the lightning rod cross and setting the roof ablaze.

The hands left my body as I shimmied back around the bell and fell out the front door, stumbling down the steps and falling with a wet splat in the mud below. The roar grew louder, the flames creeping down the walls of the building and I scrambled to my feet, the van within my sight. I turned back and saw a woman with white hair in a hospital gown standing in the doorway with the leather book. She stepped down the stairs slowly as a crashing noise came from inside, the roof collapsing in sections, both weakened by the sudden fire and the structural damage from whatever was going on inside.
She walked closer, her body slowly vanishing from her feet up. She stood in front of me, everything below the waist slowly fading away. "Pluto will return to the darkness,” her weak, croaking voice said in the air between us. She held the book out to me and smiled.

I clutched the book to my chest then felt the pendant between it and me. I took it out of my shirt and looked at the aged woman. She only nodded, turned back around and glided back into the asylum, now practically engulfed in flames. I watched as the roars suddenly turned to cries of anguish, the flames rising into the clouds and a blast of light forced my eyes closed.
When I opened them again, all that remained in front of me was a pile of rubble, ash, and an oxidized copper bell. Not even smoke rose from the remains as the rain pelted down on us. I reached down to my side but when I felt where the dagger had stabbed me, all that was left was scar tissue.

My bladder suddenly caught up to me and I relieved myself behind the charred remains of a wall. I wrote this job off as done, phoned Bossman that I was on my way back and drove in silence, the leather book sat in my passenger seat.

No reports of the abandoned asylum suddenly burning down came up in papers or on the news; it's like it was never there.

The ten days eventually passed, but I decided to keep my little pendant with me. A sort of good luck charm. I'm trying to decipher what's in the leather book, if it's of some sort of importance to a ritual or if it has something that can keep Pluto from coming again. But until that happens, I guess I'll keep up whatever I'm doing. Maybe I'll go see a doctor.
