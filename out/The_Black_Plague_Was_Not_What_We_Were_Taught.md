I had found the documents by accident, tucked inside a folio I purchased at a small private estate sale. I believe the seller believed it to be a collection of church and parish financial records from the mid-fourteenth century, horribly dull and mind numbingly repetitive. The outer pages were exactly that, to be completely fair. The inner bundle however had been sewn in separately, using a different thread and stitching technique.

 
There was no catalog reference to the inner pages. Not even marginal notes acknowledging their existence. Someone seemed to had gone to the trouble of hiding them or maybe they never knew they were there to begin with. In academic fairness, both seemed quite improbable.

 
The parchment it was wrote on was very damaged, but it was not beyond repair. The deep stains, water warping, and mold eating through entire lines. I spent a solid boring month attempting to restore the papers using all the techniques I could, and months more reconstructing missing passages by studying old literature and documents to try to fill in any missing spots. 


What follows is not a perfect transcript, but it IS the closest I could manage with my limited knowledge of the 1300s and 1400s unique vocabulary. Below is the text as it appears as closely as I could manage. Rendered in to modern spelling where possible.
 
 

~Oh, dearest friends, harken unto my words, though the folly of our ilk hath doomed us. Forsooth, the prelates and those set above us in holy office speak only in cloistered whispers, and only behind the safety of stone and iron. Unto the people they declare remedies and cause: the air’s corrupt, god punishes us through sickness and strife. Yet to one another they speak in truth, and call it unfit for the common tongue.
 

Mark me, the sickness is not the thing itself, but that which remaineth after it hath passed. A shadow doth walk upon the lands, vast beyond our reckoning and blacker than the sin we are guilty of. It does not rage nor hunger. Yet those that outlive it do sicken and perish, without blade nor bruise to mark them.
 

It moves not as army nor storm, but akin to shadow cast by that which is greater than them twain. Towns fall silent ere days have run their course. Villages swell and darken, and none endure. 


We were bid to bar the gates, and so did we. We nailed the doors of our houses and prayed it would pass us by. It regarded not our prayers nor our plights.
 

I have beheld homes opened without hand or invitation. How the walls did bow inward and how the roofs did fall by thunderous blow. One by one, my neighbors were made bare, stripped of all they were in flesh.
 

Screams oh the screams, yet soon fell silent. For there was naught remaining to give voice. From body of child or breath of woman.

 
In a street I have walked, where there were no bodies to bury. Not because men had fled, but naught remained that could rightly be called man or woman. Puddles of flesh and blood did adorn the cobblestone and roofs; a slaughter only a god could have wrought.
 

The air itself did bruise the senses. Church bells were silenced by silent command. And we were bidden speak only of sin and penance, and naught of the that which walk between the towns.
 

Those who spake its cursed name were taken aside and seen no more. I tremble in recounting. Yet tremble I must, lest this be forgotten.
 

The clergy with their robes and chains of gold, they spoke of airs corrupt and pestilent miasmas. The people did hear, and their hearts were made fearful. But the truth still walked unseen, and it was called by no name aloud. By no name given by God.
 

The beast did not strike as we do. It moved as shadow moves with the shifting sun but yet the traces it left were deathly plain. The groaning of timber and shattering of thatch, the collapse of stone. The death and desolation it brought not as heralds; rather, they were its bestowed gifts. We that yet live made unclean and thus we do sicken.
 

We sought urgent succor in councils, yet each session ended in silence or decree to speak nothing. Friars prayed, prelates nodded, the beast passed ever unheeded. I have seen mothers lift their babes from their chests unto the heavens for mercy, yet the shadow cast itself over whimper and scream alike. They cried aloud, and no answer ever came naught from God nor neighbor.

 
I have writ this with trembling hand for my ink smudgeth with fear and age. I pray that these words endure long after I, though I know not who shall read them.
 

I pray that this cannot be forgotten. We cannot be buried beneath such obscene lies. May the Lord forgive our silence, for we were set in chains of duty and fear.
 

The streets once full of laughter now lay still. The air is heavy with an odor of rot and blight. I see it in my mind still, and my heart quaketh at memory.
 

I know not how long the beast moveth, nor whence it come, nor where it goeth. It passeth, and yet it stays in thought and breath. I beseech thee, mark these words: make record if thou find them. Let not the truth vanish.
 

The scholars of this age shall scoff, the chroniclers write only of sin, yet what I have seen, what I have writ, is the marrow of the corpse of truth.

 
And I, who scribes these words, know the end is near, yet still I write. I write, I write, I write. For to remain silent is to die a silent death.
 

Let none say we did not know, that we did not see. I pray that God remembers us, though we are beset on all sides by horrors beyond us. I hear it in this late hour, the damning claws on the stone. I believe it has arrived. I believe I will see my 
 
 
The text ends there in mid-line, a jagged tear in the page ripping it to the bottom. There is no signature. No dates. Only a dark stain along the edge that prior testing suggested may be blood.

 
At first I assumed hysteria, a frightened mind giving shape to an unknowable disease. But if the author was right, then the plague was never what we assumed it was. The plague may not have been transmitted by the means we have come to believe. And what unsettles me more is not the beast itself, but how thoroughly it seems to have been hidden.

 
I have since searched almost all the archives and papers that I can get my hands on, but can find absolutely no supporting evidence to the claims found here. I will of course continue looking, but I don't believe I will find anything. Whether he was mad and hysterically sick from the plague itself or a lone crier to the truth, truthfully I don’t think I’ll ever really learn.
