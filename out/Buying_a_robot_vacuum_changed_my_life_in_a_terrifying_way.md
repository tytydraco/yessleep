Let me be clear: I'm not bougie. I'm barely scraping through grad school with enough for groceries, but I occasionally splurge every few months. Last time me and my boyfriend got an air fryer, this time we got one of those automatic vacuums. I'd always wanted a pet but it took some convincing for me to like the idea of a robot mapping my house. I figured with no neighborhood cats around to adopt I might as well embrace the next best thing. We lovingly named it Toto, and while it took me a few weeks to warm up to him, I'd say that I liked him more than my boyfriend ever did. We even put some glow in the dark googly eyes on him to accentuate his personality. 

I've always been bad about cleaning, so it was a big help, but I couldn't get over the sounds it made. Don't get me wrong, they were completely normal. It was just bumps and knocks from the other room, but something about it made me jump. I can't help but imagine someone else knocking around in my apartment when I hear bumps in the night… or day. I started to feel like the vacuum was a bad idea. Like Toto might bump the ankles of whatever is hiding behind a curtain and provoke it into finally attacking me. I've always been afraid of that sort of thing, though.

I used to talk to shadows when I was a kid. I think I was trying to reclaim some of that fear I felt when staring into a blank corner, eyes swimming for details that aren't there. By impressing myself on that darkness I was removing any space for the Boogeyman to hide. And if he were standing in the corner, just out of my vision, then maybe I would annoy him into getting it over with.

I admired how Toto could plunge directly into that darkness without fear or worry, eyes fading into the blackness. It was sort of like having a dog in the apartment. I tried to convince myself that I didn’t need to worry about any hidden intruders; Toto’s ears would perk up and he would beep dutifully, alerting me to the danger. 

Between my boyfriend, myself, and astro-dog, things were perfect and well-kept. We hardly ever had to make any to-do lists and maintained a healthy chore-life balance. Soon, though, I noticed that cabinets were being left open, and items of mine were being left in strange spots. Sometimes Toto would get stuck on a pair of my underwear or a sock. I know dudes sometimes like to grab a piece of their girlfriends clothes for *inspiration* but this was getting weird, and quick. I eventually confronted him after I found one of my favorite bottoms, dampened by what seemed to be saliva. It smelled awful. He insisted it wasn't him, that I was being crazy, that “maybe Toto has a crush.” 

I guess things weren't as perfect as I had thought, because that schism grew until we could no longer stand each other. At least I got full custody of Toto. 

It took a while to get used to sleeping alone again so I started staying up later. No boyfriend smell to lull me to sleep anymore. I never slept without a lamp, but would still find myself talking to that veil of shadow that hung over the furthest corner of my room. 

“I know you're there.”

This time it seemed my accusations were answered. I heard rustling from beyond my vision, back in my closet. I honestly half-expected someone or something to emerge slowly from the darkness, but it was just Toto’s bright green eclipses gliding across the floor. I need to get out of the house more.

I did just that. I went out drinking with some of my cohorts and ended up getting a little trashier than I meant to. As soon as I got home I collapsed on the sofa 

As I said earlier, I'm not the cleanest person ever, but I’m not the kind of person to forget and misplace. That was why I got so nervous when I came home to find that my perfumes had been completely rearranged. Toto was whirring around in the other room, but I knew there was no way him bumping the shelf could do anything like this. Some bottles faced different ways and were in a completely different order than I had left them. This wasn’t like Toto choking on a sock; someone had entered my bathroom and purposely moved my property, and I had enough proof to dispel any positive thinking. 

I immediately contacted my property manager's emergency line to make sure my ex returned his key, and that no maintenance workers had been in my apartment that day. The anticipation of the thirty second hold was enough to make me shed tears. I paced the bathroom. I was convinced that someone had a key, and was parading around my apartment when I wasn't home. Despite how late it was, they answered. Somehow, the knowledge that no one entered my apartment that day put me even further over the edge, rather than at ease. I was alone, confused, a little drunk, and sure that I was being harassed. That was when Toto started beeping. 

I've only ever heard him make that sound a few times before. Once when he turned onto his side over the edge of one of my platform shoes I left out, another when my ex had picked him up like a baby. I turned to my bedroom, which I could clearly peer into from where I stood. Two green eclipses, hanging at eye level. 

I froze. I don't know for how long. I honestly believed that Toto had sprouted legs for a moment. That was when my eyes started to adjust. Slowly I began to make out the shape that was suspending Toto in the darkness, inspecting the bottom of his carriage. Its long, curious fingers pried at the seams, the same fashion in which King Kong would pull at the jaws of Godzilla. It seemed… frustrated? Something about Toto perplexed the thing, but I couldn't tell its facial features or what emotions it was feeling. All I could make out was… limbs and hair. 

Suddenly, it dropped Toto with a careless thud. Sharp bits of plastic scattered into the darkness as Toto struggled on his back. He squirmed and reached for the pieces of himself in the same desperate manner as a dog who is trying to consume its own throw up, beeping the whole time. 

The thing remained where it stood, but now, it was looking towards the bathroom. I could see it through the mirror as I sunk behind the door, peering at its reflection through the crack in the hinges. It was a good foot taller than me, but when it shifted its weight not a pop or crack came from the floorboards. It was impossibly thin, and I swear I could see its chest shifting under its hairy skin, even in the dark. The sounds of Toto's struggle made it hard to focus on anything but I could clearly hear the figure speak over the noise. It was a mimic of my own voice:

“I know you're there” 

It didn't move, and neither did I. We both just stared at each other through the mirror. I don't think it could really see me, and if it could it was just my panicked eyeball, maybe a strand of hair hanging through the edge of the doorframe. It probably couldn't even make out what I was, but it knew I was there. Maybe it hoped I couldn't see it.

I wondered if this is what it felt like for the Boogeyman when I would call into the darkness, hoping to rattle whatever might be watching me. But this time I was the one who was sinking into the shadows, doubling down on my hiding spot, never breaking for a second. I realized that the real Boogeyman isn't one who attacks children in the dead of night, rather, he's a voyeur. A watcher.

I waited and watched for I don't know how long, and so did it. The hours ticked by slowly and Toto still lay upside down in the same spot, but by now his battery had died. The beeping had stopped. I could hear the figure breathing, chirping. It sounded almost… cute? Like a cat or ferret.

The sun started to trickle through the window from the spare room, but since I have blackout curtains in my bedroom the light only made it harder for me to see the figure. I could tell it was moving, slowly shifting back into the cover of darkness. Under my bed? The closet? Was it folding itself into an unused drawer or under my mattress? Where did it go when I was here? 

The fear of wondering was enough to propel me towards the bedroom light switch, but as soon as I emerged from behind the door it ran out of the darkness… screaming.

I say ran but I'm not sure if it even touched the floor. All six limbs worked in perfect coordination to propel itself as quickly as possible towards the front door of my apartment. It grasped at corners and high edges of the ceiling with all of its hands and its tiny body floated almost gracefully past me. That grace was immediately shattered when it disappeared past the corner of my living room. I heard it banging, hard, into the front door. It was like when a deer gets stuck behind a fence so they just keep slamming, hoping to free themselves through sheer perseverance. 

I rounded the corner to see it in a ball, using all six limbs to slam its mass into the door. Just a hairy crumple of willfully flesh. It shrieked at the sight of me, to realize I was following. I was it's Boogeyman. As I got closer it cowered further into the corner, releasing some awful smelling liquid into my shoe-rack. I realized it had no legs, only long arms. It looked like a giant dust-bunny, with tufts of long black hair coming off of its limbs. I couldn't tell where it's head was anymore, but it just kept backing up until it was completely squished into the corner, a quarter of its original size. 

I braced myself and opened the door.  While it took some time to find its way out, like a fly through a car window, I could tell it was relieved. It flung itself off of my balcony with renewed grace and disappeared into the tall grass of the field next to my apartment. 

I considered moving out after everything was over with, but I've got a new roommate now. All things considered, she's a lot more stable than my ex was, and quite cute too. I haven't seen the figure since I released it from my apartment. I don't even know how it got in. Maybe just like an insect. You open the door for a split second and by its own mistake it just shoots right in and there it stays until you let it out. The only thing that keeps me from attributing the whole thing to a psychotic break are the chirps and purrs I hear in the morning when I walk to my car. There's no cats in my neighborhood so I like to think it's Toto #2 saying good morning. I leave leftovers next to the field sometimes but only chicken ever gets taken off the plate.
