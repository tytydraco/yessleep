I am a 35 year old man and I stream regularly online. I love online streaming as my job. It's been 6 months and I've stuck to only family content streaming. I feature all my family members too!! Till now, I've featured my mom, dad, wife, daughter - my son never liked my streams, bummer. I guess he doesn't like showing intimate parts of our life on the stream. I do feel guilty about it sometimes, but I make millions through this job. Every job comes with tradeoffs, you know.

TerryBrostar23: "That was amazing!! ðŸ˜² "

Ttttwha55: "I always watch you for stress relief man, great content as always"

Iluvtohack222 : "You should KYS" 

Why would someone say that? It made me extremely angry, then sad. I was never good with people's criticism's. Always took them personally and it ruined my whole day. Like why would someone say something so rude. 

I've heard an online quote "your haters are your biggest supporters". Thinking about this gives me peace. My supporters love me because I give them content no one else can. But there are always haters. 
I mean I know I should never take these people seriously, but sometimes haters take it very far.

This one time, one viewer somehow doxxed my location so I had to shift houses immediately. I usually choose places far away from big cities to avoid unnecessary attention.

I earn in millions so changing houses isn't much of a problem for me. As I said, I'm one of the few people who stream in this genre.

The thing is, I'm running out of content now. 

Yesterday I featured my son! He was the only one remaining from my family to be featured in my streams. He was scared but I eventually forced him to. After all, My chat wanted to see my son featured since a long time.

"Hey champ! You'll do good" I told him right before the stream started. 

"Dad, Is it necessary?" 

"Yes, son. It's our family legacy. Don't you want to be featured too?" I smiled at him.

I turned on the stream.

"Welcome everyone to the stream! Joining us today is my son! Say hi, kiddo!"

"H-hello guys" he stuttered.

"You all really loved the last stream where i did rock paper scissors with my wife! So let's do it again, shall we?" I said

The chat exploded with supportive reactions and emojis! 

We began playing.

"Rock! Papers! Scissor!"

 I lost this round. 

"Rock! Papers! Scissor!"

 I won this round. 

My son got very sad after this, but that's normal. We continued the game.

"Rock! Papers! Scissor!"

I won again! 


Garryrocks54: "IT'S TIME!"
lilyshocks: "DO ITðŸ”¥"

The knife slit across his throat. Then came the blood, the screams, and the silence that follows. 

The chat was exploding with excitement.

*Derrylobster* : "Best streamer around here!"

Anonymous666: "Who will you feature next?"

"TerryBrostar23 donated 200000$ dollars - Here, as promised"

I felt happy. Haters don't matter as long as you have a thousand supporters.
