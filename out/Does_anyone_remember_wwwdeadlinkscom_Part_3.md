[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kbm5ls/does_anyone_remember_wwwdeadlinkscom_part_2/)

Eight hours? What the hell does that mean? What does Ryan have planned? Whatever it meant, I knew that I should have faith in Ryan.

Days had passed. 

In truth, it had probably only been several hours. I was starting to doze off when the sound of alarms blaring made me jolt up right. The sterile white lights in my room shut off. I was dazed and confused. “What the hell is going on?” I thought.

I pushed on the door. It moved slightly. 

To my surprise, Ryan’s trick had worked—the piece of blanket I had wedged in the door kept it from locking. Since there was no handle, I braced myself, took a deep breath, and slammed my shoulder into it. The door burst open, spilling me into the hallway now filled with dark red light.

No time to hesitate.

I tore down the hall, weaving through the sterile corridors, heart pounding like a war drum. I had to find Ryan. Had to get out of here before—

A force yanked me down.

I barely had time to inhale before a hand clamped over my mouth. My body tensed, ready to fight—until I saw them. 

Ryan and Derek. 

I almost felt a sense of relief seeing Derek. His hair, usually neat and tapered, now hung in wild strands, grown out to the tips of his ears. His face, once always clean-shaven, was now covered in coarse, uneven stubble. But I barely had time to take it in. 

My eyes were drawn to both of them staring intently at something around the corner. Their eyes wide, full of terror. They said nothing, only pointed. I followed their gaze to a door, torn clean off its hinges. A massive puddle of blood pooled just beyond it. Tiny droplets disturbed its surface, sending ripples outward.

Drip.

Drip.

Drip.

I looked up.

The antlered creature I had seen before, clung to the ceiling. Its grotesque frame curled in unnatural angles, its maw locked around something. An emaciated figure, draped in a red cloak.

Lifeless.

The moment our eyes met, it dropped the body. The corpse hit the ground with a sickening thud. Then, with an effortless motion, the creature let go, landing flat on its feet. Towering. Looming. Even hunched slightly, its antlers nearly scraped the ceiling. It locked eyes with us.

Then it screeched.

The sound was hell itself. Piercing, raw, wrong. I was too slow to cover my ears. An explosion of pain ignited in my skull as my eardrums ruptured. Warm blood streamed down my jaw. My balance swayed, my vision blurred. The world around me dissolved into nothing but muffled distortion and an unbearable, high-pitched ringing.

Ryan grabbed me, his lips moving, his voice lost to the ringing in my head. I barely made out one phrase—

"We gotta go! Now!"

We ran. Footsteps slamming against the floor, our frantic breathing barely registering over the relentless ringing. The creature was behind us. Chasing. Hunting. The winding corridors did nothing to shake the creature. No matter how many turns we took, no matter how fast we ran, it stayed just behind us—always close enough to hear its ragged, wet breaths and the rhythmic pounding of its limbs against the cold floor. 

But it wasn’t trying. 

It could’ve caught us at any moment. It was playing with us. 

The creature was yanked back by an unseen cloaked figure. In our panic we hadn’t noticed that the creature still had the collar with the chain leash on. It kept running, dragging its handler behind it like a rag doll, the figure slamming into walls and skidding across the floor. Still, it slowed—just enough for us to take our chance.

We threw ourselves into the nearest room and slammed the door behind us. It was pitch black. The air was thick with the scent of old paper. The walls were lined with tan filing cabinets. A heavy desk sat in the corner, barely visible in the darkness. Without hesitation, we scrambled underneath, curling into ourselves, pressing against each other in suffocating silence.

Footsteps, right outside the door.

Slowly the door creaked open. Red light from the hallway bled into the room. Its antlers scraped against the top the doorway, followed by the dull thud of the creature stepping inside. Every movement was accompanied by the dry, brittle clatter of bone shifting against bone. A sickly green light reflected across the walls as the creature stepped inside, scanning the room for us. Each step sent vibrations through the ground, rattling the cabinets. 

We didn’t move. Didn’t breathe.

A cabinet crashed to the floor. I felt all of us jump slightly. Then another cabinet slammed against the wall. 

It was searching.

The ground trembled beneath its weight. Then, the glow dipped lower. Accompanied by two soft pats. It was on all fours. A slow, rasping exhale filled the room. I clenched every muscle in my body, frozen in place. The snout of the deer skull came into view first, peeking just around the edge of the desk. I closed my eyes as tight as I could, thinking this was the end for us when a distant high pitched, inhuman screech tore through the corridors. 

The creature’s head jerked upright.

For a long, breathless moment, silence hung in the air. The eerie green glow that lit the walls vanished, leaving only the red light from the hall. We heard the sound of heavy limbs against tile. Its running echoing off the walls. 

The room was silent once more.

We didn’t move for what felt like an eternity. The air was thick, suffocating, pressing down on us like a held breath.

…

“Daaaaaamn… Saved by the bell much?” Derek’s voice shattered the silence. Ryan and I turned to glare at him. He held up his hands, an exhausted grin pulling at his face. “What? Too soon? Guess I’m the only one here with a sense of humor.” He hissed the last part under his breath, rubbing the back of his neck.

None of us laughed.

With shaky limbs, we pulled ourselves out from under the desk. The room was still dark, still impossibly quiet, but now it felt… wrong. Like something had shifted in the air. The filing cabinets the creature had knocked over had spilled their contents all over the floor. Pages were scattered across the dust-coated tile. Curious, we approached, Ryan and I knelt down to inspect them. Derek went off to check the other cabinets.

I picked up a couple of the empty folders on the floor. They had weird labels that I couldn’t even begin to understand—*Subject: WNDG-00133*, *Subject: JRSYDV-00676*, *Subject: SKNWR-00599*. I hovered over one—\*Subject: MTHM-00266—\*before pulling my hand back. 

I didn’t want to know what was inside.

I looked up at Ryan and Derek. Derek was flipping through more files in another cabinet’s drawers. But Ryan… Ryan was quiet. Too quiet. I turned to look at him. His face pale, his hand was clasped over his mouth like he was about to be sick. I was about to ask him what was wrong when—

“Damon…” Derek’s voice was unsteady.

Something in his tone sent a chill through me. “…Yeah?” He hesitated before speaking again. “I found your file…” I forced myself to swallow. “What—

**U͡N̸A̵͘U̢̢T̷H̸Ơ̢R̴̷I͞Z̴̢E͜D̴͝ ̨͝À͡T̴͞T̷E͟͜M̡P̶T͏̢ ̶̶D͡E͟͜T̕E̡C͝T͘E̢D.̵**

Derek paused, his grip on the paper tightening. He looked up at me, his expression hollow, as if the weight of the words had drained the life from him. His mouth opened, but for a moment, no sound came. Then, finally, in a voice barely above a whisper—empty, resigned—he said:

S̷u̷b͟j̸e͞c̢t įs p̸r̶o̢g͏r͡e͝s̡s̷i͠n̢g a̸t a ͟s̷l͠o͡w̷e̡r̸ r̶a͡t̛e t͢h͝a̡n o̴t̸h̨e͠r ̕t̛e͟s̢t s̕u̡b͡j͟e͡c̸t̢s. *T̷e͜r͟m͠i͡n̨a͡t̸i̸o͢n i͢n̢e̢v̶i͢t̶ąb̶l͟e*.”

The room felt colder. Smaller. Like the walls were pressing in. I felt my pulse in my throat, each beat hammering against my chest. I was on the verge of spiraling. What did they do to me? What did it mean by progressing slower? Why would I have to be term—

"Guys—there’s some sort of dart in here?" Ryan's voice cut through my spiral, confused but sharp. Ryan’s question jolted my memory. 

“It’s a tranquilizer dart.” I said.

“How do you know that?” Ryan pondered, confused—almost sounding suspicious of me. “Cause I’ve seen that thing get shot with one before.” My voice was low. "What?!" Derek and Ryan exclaimed in unison. 

I told them everything—the way it sat, the way it moved, the way it feasted. Derek’s eyes widened. "I can’t believe it’s taken me this long to connect the dots!" "What? What is it?" I demanded. He hesitated for just a second before finally saying it.

“It's a **\[R̵͘E̴͠D̶͝A̶͘C̴̀T̷͠É̵D̸̕\]**.” 

The word sat heavy in the air. "A what?" I asked. "It’s an old N̶a̸t̴i̸v̸e̵ ̸A̶m̷e̶r̷i̷c̵a̶n̵ ████̷█̴█̴█̶█̵. These days, people just lump them in w-wi̸̪̮̐̓t̶̲͝h̸̗̋ ̴̗̓͘c̶̯̓̄r̷̨̺͘y̸̡͗̎p̶̞̈́̋t̴̢̡̓̍ȉ̷̲́d̸̤̥́̕s̶̟͂," Derek explained. Ryan scoffed. "What? Like Bigfoot?! Cause that thing was no fucking joke!" "But cryptids aren’t real," I argued, though my voice lacked conviction. Derek gave me a look. "Then what the hell did you see, Damon?"

I went silent. 

I didn’t have an answer.

Finally, Ryan steeled his gaze. "It doesn’t matter if it’s real or not. It’s here and as long as it still is, we're at a severe disadvantage of getting out of here.” “So what do we do?" Derek asked. Ryan replied with an extremely blunt, “we’ll have to lead it into a trap.” "Yeah… but how?" I whispered. Derek slowed for just a second, eyes dropping to the floor, voice suddenly hollow. “That means one of us will have to be bait…” My chest tightened. The weight of his revelation hit me like a ton of bricks. “Don’t worry, I—”

“I’ll do it.” Derek’s voice was firm.

I turned to him, ready to protest, but the look on his face stopped me. His hands were clenched into fists, his jaw set, but his eyes were full of something else. 

Guilt.

“I’m faster than both of you,” he said. “Besides… I’m pretty sure it’s my fault we’re even in this mess in the first place. If only I hadn’t found that stupid site—” “Derek.” My voice cut through his spiral. “We can’t think like that right now.” Ryan grabbed his shoulder, grounding him. “We need to focus. We’re gonna get out of here, together.” Derek exhaled sharply, nodding. No more hesitation. No more guilt. Just survival.

We huddled close, making out a plan like our lives depended on it—because they did. “We need to put it down,” Ryan said. “Lure it back in here, trap it, and hit it with the tranq.” Derek nodded grimly. “Okay. But who’s stabbing it?” Ryan didn’t hesitate long. “I’ll do it. We’ll pin it under the desk, and I’ll drive the dart into its neck.” He turned to me. “Damon—you’re in charge of the desk. The second it’s in the room, you push.”

That was it. 

No backup plan. No time for doubts.
