When I was a child, one of my favorite things about the holiday season was the elf on the shelf.  The idea that he was making sure I would stay on the nice list really made Santa feel more realistic. 

After my parents passed, my brother didn't show an interest in it. So I decided to take it home and try and recreate the same magic of Christmas for my own kids.

For the past two years, the new tradition has been a success. My oldest daughter, Kayla, seems to love it almost as much as I did.

Like the past years, I dug through the Christmas decorations for the elf. I'd put him on the coffee table in the living room on December 1st.

Continuously calling it 'the elf' is making my anxiety worse. When I was a kid, we decided to name it Jingles. This is because Jingles has these large gilded bells on his feet.

Anyways, I put Jingles out right before I got ready for bed. My wife, Marcy, had already gone to sleep hours before. I then went through my usual routine of going to the bathroom, making sure the outside doors are locked, then turning off the lights. I laid down on the bed, and after only like 5 seconds shit starts getting weird.

Have you ever ripped a shirt? That's the best way i can describe it. It sounded like cloth ripping. I got back out of bed. I thought it was just the dog spazzing out, I haven't had the time to get him fixed yet. 

I stubbed my pinky toe on the dresser, trying not to make a noise and wake up Marcy. As soon as I opened the bedroom door, I knew something was wrong. Brutus, my GSD, nosed the door all the way open and dove under the blankets. I quietly closed the door, got the gun from my safe, and stepped into the hall.

I went down the stairs and peeked around the corner into the living room. 

Dull moonlight filters in through the windows. A dull amber glow is emanating from the coffee table. Pieces of Jingles were everywhere. It looked like he got shot by birdshot..

In the place of Jingles, was something else. A writhing mass of bright red and white tentacles. They kept twisting to keep the same pose I put Jingles in. There were no features, no eyes, no nose or mouth. Just a vaguely humanoid amalgamation, whose appendages ended in a large hook.

I did what at the time I thought was the best idea. There was no way I was going to let that... thing get any closer to my family.  I silently switched the safety off of my grandfather's 1911. 

As soon as I turned the corner to shoot, the tentacles all undulated at once. The speed which it moved... It was already climbing up my leg. I dropped the gun and tried to peel it off. My face got covered and I panicked. I was digging at the tentacles near my mouth for air. They tried to go in my mouth, I bit down hard. The fluid that came out tasted like sour milk, it also gave off a vapor like smelling salts. I fought the urge to cough. The tentacles went up my nose, I could hear popping and separating. Then the world went black.

What I saw next hasn't left my mind since. Maybe im just stressed from work. Maybe the stress is making me hallucinate? I pray to God that it's just stress. Every time I try to sleep, or blink, I see the same scenes again. In my dream, I saw several terrible, grotesque images.
The first thing I saw was the gift of flesh. Two tentacle beings were standing in front of a Christmas tree.  The tree had pure white tentacles in place of ribbon and tinsel. Pieces of festering viscera, gore, and organs replaced ornaments. At the top of the tree, red tentacles formed an undulating star. From the star, a dull red glow emitted that painted the rest of the scene.

The two tentacle beings began chanting, appearing to begin a ritual of some kind. They rose up and became rigid. Simultaneously, they ripped off their left arm. Fluid gushed from the cavity of severed tentacles as they presented their arm to the other. The process repeated, with each appendage being gifted to the other. Finally, the dream ended in one writhing mass under the pale glow.

The second dream began as a void. I was floating in an all consuming darkness, until I heard him. Dreadful wailing began and slowly got louder.In the distance a pale red glow came in to view. A team of reindeer pulled a sleigh into view 

The deer in the 'Rudolph' position was almost rotted completely through. Pieces of hide fell off, and revealed a skeleton underneath. It had three extra legs. The way they twitched reminded me of the tentacles. Every other reindeer was less decayed, hanging, limp in the harness.

In the sleigh, was a convulsing mass of red and white tentacles. Next to it was a bag made of what looked like human leather. It was stuffed to the seams, overflowing with organs and gore.

They stopped when the lead reindeer was right in my face. The red mass of tentacles around it's head undulated at once, releasing a increasingly bright red light. My whole body radiated in pain as I was slowly erased from the scene.

I woke up from these two visions to Marcy shaking me awake. My eyes snapped open. I was in the living room. All evidence of Jingles was erased. Marcy told me she came down the stairs to make coffee, then saw me unconscious with my gun nearby. The way she looked at me... with such concern, just wanting an answer. It broke something in me, I think. I couldn't answer. I didn't know what to say. I hadn't even had time to process what I just dreamed. If only I could stop now.

I walked up the stairs and put the gun back in the safe without saying a word. When I tried to compose myself and come back downstairs, Marcy had taken Kayla to cheer practice. 

I spent the next three hours looking for Jingles or any sign of him. Brutus refused to leave the bedroom. I found a gilded bell in the master bathroom.

I've tried looking for an answer, an explanation, a similarity. I've tried looking here on reddit, but I haven't found anything. I also didn't have luck on 4chan boards either. Please if you know what this is or what what to do, please let me know.

It's now late evening. Marcy hasn't come back and won't answer my calls. I guess that's good in a way. At least they are safe. 

I'm completely on edge, the sunset kept giving me flashbacks to the light. I unplugged all the lights and tore down the decorations. I cant calm down. Those moments, those scenes just keep playing over and over in my mind. I'm not sure how much more I can take. 


Well, if I don't post an update soon....

Stay safe and Merry Christmas..
