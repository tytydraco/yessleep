The Night was heavy with an eerie silence, broken only by the fain whispers of the wind trough the tall pines. I was sitting in a seluded cabin, alone, with a Handgun that had 1 Bullet left. there were four of us who started the Mission, but now I\`m the only one left.

It had all started a Week ago, when our Communication with the other Search Team abruptly ceased. We had been assigned to investigate a series of disappearances in the wilderness of the Tongast National Forest. Do to the potential Nature of the threat, we were all equipped with an automatic Rifle, a Handgun and Flashlights. The other Team had established their Camp around 2,5 Miles to the East of us. The last Transmission we got from them was filed with terror-stricken voices and incoherent screams.

The higher-ups had deemed it a rescue mission, and we packed up our Camp and made our Way towards their Position. We had set out with high hopes and and the firm belief that whatever had happened to the other Team could be resolved. But as we ventured deeper into the dense Forest, the atmosphere grew increasingly ominous, the trees seemingly closing in around us.

When we got to their Camp Site, we found their Tents turned to shreds, their belongings scattered everywhere, and bloodstains on the ground. Something horrific had taken place there, something that defied rational explanation.

As night fell, the Forest came alive with strange noises - rustlings in the underbrush, eerie howls, and chilling whispers carried by the Wind. Our anxiety grew with each passing hour, our flashlights cutting through the darkness like fragile beams of hope. But our hope would soon turn into dispair.

As we made our way deeper into the Woods, we stumbled upon a gruesome sight. The mangled remains of the other Team lay scattered across the clearing. Some of the Bodys were half eaten and impaled on branches of Tree\`s. It was a Scene of unimaginable Horror, and the stench of death hung heavy in the air.

Terror gnawed at me as i surveyed the carnage, but there was no Time for mourning. We had to find whatever had done this and put an end to it. Our Radios remaint silent, rendering us isolated and alone in the hostile wilderness.

We pressed on, even though the darkness made it difficult to discern where we went. It was then that we first heard it - a distant, high-pitched scream that sent chills down our Spines. As the Scream echoed into the Forest, we heard it again. This time, much closer. Then, we saw a white blur dart towards us and threw himself at one of us and tore him into the darkness with it. His Screams of Terror echoing in the night were quickly replaced by the eeri silence of the Forest.

I yelled at the 2 remaining Members of my Team to run. We ran as fast as we could, the high-pitched screams of this... Thing, following closely behind us. It suddenly got louder and when i looked behind me, there were only two of us. 

Me and my last Teammate startet firing Rounds into the darkness, but our shooting seemed to only anger it more. As our last rounds from our rifles were fired, i saw an old Cabin and ylled at my Teammate to run to the Cabin. I got there first and kicked the Door open and went inside. When i turned around, i saw my Teammate running towards the Door. He had a smile of relief on his Face. But before he could get in the cabin, i darted from the Side of the House and took it into the darkness with him. I slammed the Door shut and pushed a wodden drawer infront of it.

The cabin was small, with a rotten matrase, an old table and a Closet. The cabin had no Windows so i wasnt able to look outside. I heard the screams of my Teammate beeing murdered by that Thing echo towards me, and not long after they ceased, I heard something scratch at the Door. I pulled out my Pistol and shot 3 Rounds in the Door. I heard a loud scream and something shuffeling around the Cabin. I fired a few more rounds into the wooden walls around me, until i had 1 Bullet left.

There i sat, in the darkness of the Cabin, my Fingers trembling with the Handgun. I knew i was the last one left, the final witness to the unspeakable horror that fell upon us. I heard this thing scratching slowly at the Walls, as if it knew i had no ammunition left. And i swear i heard it laugh. It laughed at me. It delighted in my suffering and loved my fear.

Then i heard something slam at the Door. BAMM! The Walls started to shake and dust fell from the ceiling. BAMM! Another one. I heard the wood start to crack.

As i huddle in the Cabin typing this, i couldnt help but wonder if the Thing outside was the true Master of this Forest, a primal force that had existed long before humanity ever set foot in its domain.

As i hear the Door break down and a triumphant scream in the Air, i knew i would soon join my fallen comrades, lost to the malevolent heart of the wilderness we dared to challenge.
