Crickets make peaceful company; a lulling ambience to soothe the quiet side road, where a girl can puff another smoke, wondering what lecture Chief's gonna bark come morning.

But my night was only beginning.

The dash radio didn't just crackle to life - it sputtered in jumbled, inaudible pieces. I assumed the worn-down piece of shit was broken as I flicked away my butt and slogged back to the door, but I barely had time to sit down when a man's voice slipped through the garbled static.

"*10-33, all units! \[static\] 10-33, all units, please, I'm-*" Something was wrong with his voice. Each burst of static carried a different version of the same man; layered, varied tones out of sync.

"*Swallow Coast is \[static\] Swallow Coast is gone--Swallow Coast is... wrong \[static\]* *PLEASE, MY*\-"

The voices then stumbled together into a single, dead tone and repeated the same phrase over and over.

"*help us*"

Then it broke apart again, overlapping into a shattered mess of protocol codes, before cutting off to a null silence. My hand was halfway to the volume knob, trembling; I'd heard panicked officers be shot at before, fighting to speak, but never had I heard *anything* like that.

A glitch? A ghost? A dream? My mind raced down every avenue, but a single ugly detail kept pecking at my brain.

'Swallow Coast'

Training kicked in.

"Dispatch, 3-Adam-12," I said, my voice sounding far steadier than I felt. "Copy an unknown 10-33 that just came over my in-car. Unidentified officer, no call sign, giving location as 'Swallow Coast.'"

I stared out at the empty road.

"Be advised," I added, forcing the words out, "I don't show a 'Swallow Coast' on any local grids. Can you run a trace on the transmission?"

I released the button, and the radio went back to dead air.

"3-Adam-12, Dispatch here." Her voice was calm, but there was a hesitance to it. "We've got a hit."

"Go ahead, Dispatch."

"Signal's bouncing off the east repeater, origin somewhere off County Road 17, past marker 22." Papers rustled faintly on her end. "Be advised that stretch is... it just *ends* out there."

I squinted through the windshield, trying to picture it.

I'd patrolled that road a hundred times.

"Dispatch, confirm. You're telling me an emergency call came from the middle of nowhere?"

"Affirmative. How do you want to proceed?"

I glanced at the black stretch of highway disappearing into the trees, and took a deep breath.

"Dispatch, show me en route."

I flipped on my lights and pulled back onto the tar, my headlights carving a narrow tunnel through the ensemble of timber. The silence became a pressure; the radio a faint, constant open breath as I ran the familiar stretch.

"Dispatch, 3-Adam-12," I said, "Confirm last known origin was off 17, past marker 22."

"Affirmative. You should be the only thing moving out there."

The terrain began to climb; the highway curled along the flank of a mountain in long, sweeping turns where only a guardrail stood between me and a steep drop. When the trees broke, I caught glimpses of it - the pale smear of the heaving Pacific.

By 21, the air had turned damp and cold, seeping in through the vents. My GPS started to lag - a little car sliding over green nothing. I frowned, tapping the casing with a knuckle, when the weather-beaten marker 22 lurched out of the shadows.

I parked beside it.

Fifty yards past the marker, veering off the road and into the wild on a narrowing, overgrown trail, the path, as described, stopped.

A hard, abrupt gravel edge.

"Dispatch, be advised. I've arrived at origin-"

The speaker exploded into unrelenting noise.

Not static, not feedback - voices; a hundred of them at once, slamming into my ears. Snatches of jingles, movie lines, sitcom laughs, news anchors, late-night preachers, kids shouting over commercials, pop songs, intimate phone calls; every recorded sound I'd ever heard stacked on top of each other, out of tune.

Out of time.

"-*copy that, over and out--he's looking at you, kid--baby, don't hurt me, don't--breaking news tonight as officials--wake up, she's here*."

"Dispatch?!" I snapped, one hand clamped on the mic, the other white-knuckled around the wheel. "Dispatch, I'm experiencing a malfunction! Do you copy?!"

"*-late night deals you won't believe--please, if anyone is there--this is not a test, this is an emergency broadcast*\-"

Something thudded softly under my foot.

The brake pedal sank half an inch.

I hadn't moved my leg.

"No..."

I stomped down, hard. The pedal met resistance - then, bit by bit, pushed back against me.

The gear lever clicked.

PARK - REVERSE - DRIVE

"Dispatch, I-"

"-*we now return to your feature presentation*\-"

The cruiser began to roll. Slow at first, just a whisper over the gravel as I slammed my foot on the brakes, and it shrugged me off.

The wheel didn't budge either as the car aligned with the void ahead.

I twisted the key out!

Nothing!

A canned studio audience roared out from the radio, drowning out a weatherman promising clear skies and a man's ragged voice yelling, "*They cut the road, they CUT THE ROAD-*"

I grabbed for the seatbelt, and the latch clicked, but the strap wouldn't release - remaining locked across my chest.

I hit the door handle, but it bounced against the damn frame.

"Come on!" I spat, slamming my shoulder into it. Fruitless.

The car rolled on, patient and unbothered by my efforts.

A hoarse male voice cut through the layers.

"*Please-if anyone-I've got a daughter in*\-"

Static chewed him up and vomited him back out as a game show buzzer.

"-*wrong answer, but thanks for playing*\-"

"Stop," I murmured, my nerves becoming shot.

Far ahead, at the very end of the light, something began to take shape. It was a dense patch of shimmering thin white; a near-transparent wall where empty air should've been.

Fog, I told myself. Except fog didn't sit flat.

Forty yards.

The wall resolved into a smooth sheet of glitching white-and-black, texture-less, depthless static. And beyond it - for just an instant - I thought I saw the orange smear of streetlights.

"-*you are now entering--the following film contains--they said the sky was wrong--don't touch that dial, you're gonna get us all*\-" The radio begged, pleaded, sold me detergent, laughed at its own jokes, as the distance between bumper and curtain shrank.

Thirty yards.

Twenty.

"Stop the fucking car!" I yelled, losing all professionalism as I hammered the windows and wheel, the horn blaring weakly amidst the radio's storm.

"-*ma'am, you need to remain calm*\-"

"SHUT THE FUCK UP!"

The glitching veil loomed in, filling the windshield with nothing I had a word for. I clawed at the seatbelt, desperate - jump out, climb out, do something, anything, but go through whatever that was, yet my fate was inevitable.

So I did all I had left.

I squeezed my eyes shut and braced.

And the car rolled in.

All sense of direction vanished; the seat fell away under me, then jumped back up, and my body felt like it'd plummeted through an ice sheet beyond physics.

Every voice on the radio hit a single, piercing note.

Then silence - a quick, surgical cut into the noise.

My ears popped as the world slid back in, the car coming to a stop, and after I realised I was still breathing, I slowly forced my eyes open.

The dead-end road was gone. In its place was a wide, slick street glistening with rain; lined with buildings, flickering neon, and a diner with a crooked 'OPEN' sign. A distant pier lamp swung over black water, and, carving its way up a mountain path, was a brass-and-steel observatory gazing at the stars.

On one corner, a street sign hung from a rusted pole.

'Swallow Coast'

I finally got my hands to move and reached for the gear shift, expecting the same resistance. It moved willingly, but the engine was dead; as was my radio. I was, however, able to free myself from the seatbelt and sprang out of my powerless cruiser, feeling sick and cold on wobbling legs.

A pickup truck stalked behind a pale sedan, headlights still faint, like they were running on memory. A hatchback rested at an angle to the curb, its front tyre up on the sidewalk, attempting to flee. Closer, a cruiser from a foreign department nosed into the intersection - its pattern like mine, but the crest on the door was smudged, like vandalised paint.

They were empty. Forgotten.

"Dispatch? Are you there?"

...

I walked towards a military Humvee, hunched closer to the diner, olive metal dulled by grime. A faded stencil on the door spelt 'U.S Army', but the unit markings beneath were the same as the cruiser. The passenger door hung open.

I peered in.

No gear, no duffels, no guns; just seats, and the impression that its occupants simply evaporated. The sedan had a purse on the driver's seat, its contents scattered: a wallet, receipts, a cracked phone frozen on a family photo, the seatbelt slack and twisted, the engine cold.

I turned back the way I'd come, towards where the road should've cut.

Instead, the street sloped gently upward until it met a structure that did not belong here. At first, I mistook it for a cell tower, but it was a makeshift lattice of metal and cables - antennas speared out; dish arrays, spiralled coils, panels that hummed faintly with colour. Wires as thick as my arm ran down into a fenced-off outpost bristling with control boxes and blinking lights.

I had to crane my neck to see the beacon at the peak - a red light flashing randomly.

Behind the tower, barely, hung the 'thing' I'd driven through.

From this side, the veil was much thinner. Instead of a static wall, it was more like distorted glass - a wavering, curving slice of sky that didn't fit.

More vehicles sat at the base, facing the shimmer; unquestionably military, rusting and rotten, all pointed at the same impossible curtain.

The tower then hummed as if waking up, and my radio sparked to life - coughing out a single, wailing tone that stung my ears and rattled my teeth.

I didn't notice it immediately, only catching the structure in the corner of my eye as my head pounded, but up in the mountain, the observatory *shivered*.

From the street, it looked textbook - a crown perched atop the rocks with domes and spires winking like old coins, highlighted by either its own gleaming light or what they caught from the stars.

Yet under the signal's pressure, the whole building shook.

Then the first **rip** happened.

The observatory spasmed and snapped, as if a cursor were trying to drag it across a screen; it remained in place, defiantly, but it became distorted, as if shifted through eras. For a blink, the glass was cracked and dark, the brass tarnished, and entire sections hung loose, like something blew it up from inside.

My radio climbed another notch, drilling through my jaw and violating my skull.

The observatory jerked again - now under construction.

Floodlights bleached the mountain path, support beams and half-built walls cast shadows across the rocks; domes became webs of hollow steel, and cranes hung over the whole scene, jittering and flickering as the sky seized from night to day to night again. I could almost hear construction noises - shouted instructions, the clatter of tools, the whistling of men.

I fell to my hands and knees, a trickle of blood oozing from my nose.

Everything was vibrating.

The observatory stuttered once more. It burned.

Orange triumphed inside the central dome; flames beat metal, smoke rolled up in a thick column, but didn't behave right - freezing, lagging. Something within it pulsed white-hot, brighter than any heat I'd ever seen, as my vision blurred, and the road under me melted, then hardened, becoming dirt and snow and magma. I tasted metal in the deepest recesses of my throat as my radio reached a pitch I didn't think was possible.

The observatory tore a final time, but not just the building.

The sky above split open.

A hairline crack at first - a tiny, jagged, thin line - that widened in wild jumps, tearing and stopping, until a gaping wound hung over the mountain.

A scar of colourless deep, where stars were packed far too close together - undiscovered by any astronomer.

They didn't twinkle like jewels. They blinked like eyes.

A pungent waft of burnt electricity rolled down the mountain and filled the street, as my radio became another chorus of relentless sound.

"-*entrance. logged*\--*all units, hold the line, do not approach--test the alert, damn it--alpha, requesting permission to--swiper no swiping--praise be, brothers and sisters--pay separate shipping and handling--if you or a loved one has been diagnosed with cancer--observatory team, do you copy--what the FUCK IS THAT THING--top 10 cartoon themes, number 3 will--this message will repeat--he's still in there--side effects may include dizziness, nausea, loss of self, existential dread--what have you done, boy*\-*-we are here LIVE from Swallow Coast where it seems a-*"

The radio cut out, damning me into another empty silence as the ripping of space stopped, my vision returned through harsh blinks, and the observatory clicked back to normalcy. I scrubbed trembling hands over my nose and lips, wiping away blood, and considered curling into a ball right there on the road among hollow cars, until the next signal came and fried my head to putty.

What in God's name had I done to deserve this?

"*Ellie...*"

I didn't believe I'd heard them at first, my ears and head still clearing the pain, but as my composure slowly crawled back, I realised someone was trying to talk to me over the radio.

"*Ellie--you there?*"

Not a gurgle of madness, but a sane, deliberate attempt at communication; still not just a lone voice, but several, concerned dialects - never repeating - of varying ages and tones, taking turns in between statics.

"-*click receiver \[static\] alive--just breathe, girl \[static\] not alone-*"

I jabbed at my radio.

Click.

"-*copy, she hears \[static\] the diner \[static\] equipment--trust-*"

A new voice slid in between them, low and bitter.

"-***you're not going anywhere***\-"

"-*cut them out! \[static\] ignore--scared--not one of us-*"

I forced my thumb down, my voice raw and scratched.

"Who are you? What the fuck is this place?"

"-*pocket \[static\] failed test--caught signal-*" A child's voice flickered in. "-*they turned it on, and it never turned off-*" Then a soft old man. "*-observatory is unstable*\-" Then a calm, hurried woman. "-*held it as long \[static\] can't get up--you can-*"

"What?! Me?! Why, what did I-"

There was a beat of overlapping sharp breaths, pleas and begs; then a gentle, older woman.

"*-sorry, sweetheart \[static\] your car \[static\] radio--a line in \[static\] can't lose-"*

\*"-\****chose you*** *\[static\]* ***lab rat***\-"

A squeal of feedback, then the calm woman again.

"-*reaches further \[static\] every breach \[static\] spreading--understand?*"

Finally, a man.

"-*doctor \[static\] seen it--outside \[static\] right place, right time \[static\] guide you--move, now \[static\] shut it \[static\] free us-*"

The channel fluttered, then steadied into a song of tangled encouragement, praise, and laughs and cries, and faint, drowned-out screams.

"Okay," I said, more to myself, seeing no other choice. "Tell me what to do."

\-

The closer I got to the diner, the more the streets had been terraformed into a military foothold.

Another Humvee crouched half a block down, choking the roads; cracks inched across its windshield, then retreated, like the glass was deciding whether or not to shatter. Farther along, a gloomy, armoured truck sat with its back doors open. Inside was empty, save for a single dangling headset swinging in still air.

A few steps from the truck, they'd planted a miniature radio tower. It was no taller than me - just a braced mast bolted straight into the earth. At its base, a metal shoebox hummed faintly, LEDs frozen mid-blink.

"*-repeater-*" a measured, academic voice said over my radio. "*-node--jam the \[static\] cage-*"

"Didn't work?" I asked.

"*-not for long-*" a regretful woman answered.

Beyond it were two tripod rigs, their heads pointed towards the street.

Except the mounts weren't guns.

The closest carried a cluster of speakers - flat, hexagonal panels arranged in a honeycomb, each one mottled with a mesh of tiny holes, ringed with melted plastic. The path directly in front of the speaker array was scorched in a perfect cone, not by heat, but by... absence. There was no grit, no oil stains, just a smooth, blasted-down layer of reality.

The other tripod mounted a lamp. A fat cylinder with cooling fins and nested lenses, tagged with a warning label - UV ONLY. The beam was off, but a faint violet tint clung to the terrain it aimed at.

"*-light--burns \[static\] sound--stuns-*"

"*-****calibre*** *\[static\]* ***severs*** ***the****-*"

The unwelcome voices were diluted out again.

"Who are they?" I asked, inspecting the tripods. "The ones you keep shutting up?"

"*-fractured \[static\] dangerous--uncooperative-*"

A low sandbag wall braced the mouth of a nearby alley. Riot shields leaned carelessly along it, their viewports spangled with neat, clustered cracks.

From here, the alley tightened and dead-ended against a brick wall painted with peeling graffiti, but the air above the sandbags bent wrong, like I was looking through a fisheye. I took one cautious step closer and saw, for only an instant, the suggestion of another street cutting across the wall: cars nose-to-ass, a bus shelter, the swarming of civilians, a billboard in a language I couldn't understand.

A second layer of another town, out of alignment.

Then I blinked, and the alley ended with a wall again.

"*-don't go in there-*"

"Yeah, no shit."

The radio chuckled - a quick, nervous ripple of different laughs.

Ahead, the diner waited.

The windows stuttered worse than the Humvee - intact, webbed, blown out - and the OPEN sign rolled through the wrong sequence - O P N E - before becoming abstract symbols my eyes slid off. It hurt to look at. The foundation was stitched with bullet holes; casings littered the ground - little brass maps charting where soldiers had stood and fired, and fired again, at something that left no trace.

"What were they shooting at?"

My question was met with silence.

Then, the bitter voice - softer now.

"***Us*** *\[static\]* ***not enough***\*-\*"

My hand brushed over my sidearm.

"*-inside, Ellie \[static\] tools-*" the kind woman urged, "-*survival*\-"

The bell above the door rang three different times as the smell hit me.

Decay - old, dried out, folded under dust and chemicals, and burnt coffee and fried grease soaked so deeply into the walls. The stuttering was horrid: seats went from cracked red vinyl to bare springs and torn yellow form, then back again; menus flickered in and out of existence, and a jukebox danced between models. Tables had been shoved around a central aisle, their legs braced. Cots crowded the floor - army-issue frames sagging under mattresses, sheets twisted and stained, and a portable generator cowered near the counter, its casing open; wires spilt out like guts, threading through ammo crates and jerry-rigged equipment.

I saw him then.

He sat in the last booth, facing the door. For a moment, I thought he was asleep - chin tucked, shoulders hunched, but the details became apparent.

The soldier was almost a skeleton.

Brittle fatigue clung to him; his uniform stiffened by dust. What skin I could see was like parchment, pulled tight over bone in sunken hollows; his dog tag had fused with his collarbone, the metal nesting in a little crater where his flesh had given up, and his jaw hung loose, teeth bared... a man exhausted from screaming.

His hand still cupped the air near his temple, fingers frozen around a missing pistol, a dark crater in the booth's backrest staining where the bullet had gone - a grainy, pixelated splatter.

My stomach knotted.

Two objects in front of him offered themselves to me.

The first was a flashlight, stubby and industrial with a wide, dark lens ringed with faded warning tape. The other was a compact speaker; one side a grid of tiny holes, the opposite a switch.

A worn voice breathed out on my shoulder.

"-*good man--kind--brave-*"

I cleared my throat. "Yet he died alone."

"-*better that than \[static\] lost in--signals-*"

I reached out for the pocket speaker.

"-*careful \[static\] tuned-*" the academic voice muttered.

"For what?"

They all spoke at once, a tangle of the same answer.

"-*to be louder than them*\-"

I placed both tools in my belt.

Then the soldier's skull tilted, vertebrae creaking, and my heart lurched; hand flying to my sidearm, but it was only my disturbance of the table that moved him. I breathed a sigh of relief and steadied my pulse... when *his* radio came alive, a clunky handset clipped to his waist.

It did not speak; it hissed.

"-***LEAVE IT ON*** *\[static\]* ***GO HOME, GIRL***\*--**YOU'LL KILL US**\-\*"

My own radio crackled in sympathy, and my company interjected, but they were suddenly faint.

"-*Ellie \[static\] focus--don't*\-"

The soldier's radio overpowered them, its volume spiking.

"-***NOT*** *\[static\]* ***THE FIRST PIG*** *\[static\]* ***THEY LIE***\*--**THEY SENT ALL**\-"\* a sobbing child's voice warped through "-***WE HURT*** *\[static\]* ***DON'T TURN US OFF***\*-"\*

Both radios screamed - a thousand voices mashed together.

"*-ELLIE, GET OUT OF--FEEDBACK--COMING*\--***found you***\--\*try--\*\*\*\*RAM IT, BURN IT--\*\*\**speaker--****kill your radio****--****KILL YOURSELF****--don't touch*\--*not whole anymore--angry--****STILL HERE****--****STILL FEEL****-"*

It was a thrash of sound - threats, pleas, curses, prayers, all ground together - that ached my head. I didn't hesitate. I reached for the portable speaker, flipped the switch, and my world tunnelled as it squealed a deafening wail. The generator hiccupped, the overhead lights burned and burst, the jukebox lit up and spun through songs too fast, and the dead soldier's radio cut off as his body slumped forward.

Then there was only silence as I found myself alone in a dark diner, the speaker hot against my waist.

My own radio crackled twice, confused.

"*-Ellie?!*"

Then it too failed.

And for the first time, Swallow Coast was truly quiet.

The diner's own sounds quickly crept out like insects: the creaks of booths adjusting to no weight, a slow, patient drip from somewhere in the kitchen, the soft, intermittent hum of the neon sign outside. Breath left my lungs in slippery, shaky exhales, as I fidgeted with my radio - not willing to accept this loneliness as permanent.

*Ding*.

The bell above the front door chimed.

Once. Perfectly.

*Ding.*

Again.

The door didn't move, but the sound was thicker this time - as if underwater. The air near the entrance wobbled, just a fraction, as I drew my gun and the flashlight.

*Ding.*

The doorframe trembled in place, smearing sideways in short, nauseating skips, then bulged and rippled and flattened, and *something* pressed through it.

Familiar broken nonsense reached me first.

"*-don't touch that dial, we'll be right with you \[flatline\] you're about to start \[phone dial\] one woman, one night, lost her friends \[Windows Startup\] coming up: a local officer goes \[sirens\]* ***skinned and flayed***\*-\*"

The idea of a man began to materialise, cobbled together from a disjointed static mass of flickering grey fuzz; his chest strobed between suits, hoodies, bare skin, hospital gowns, and his face was layers upon layers over a vertical slack - an old man's profile, a child's wide eyes, a woman's gaping mouth mid-scream, a teenager chewing gum. They swam through one another, never syncing, each countless expression trying to dominate the other; far too many crammed into the same outline.

Every time he moved, pieces of him lagged behind at different frame-rates or spasmed into mundane tasks, as a radio snow flaked off his edges, popping and disintegrating into nothing. He stepped into the diner (if you could call it that), tearing out of the door, the sounds of his feet were complex, dry keyboard clicks dubbed over with car doors, gunshots, soda cans, and a microphone. The air bent around him, violating the space into an elongated, glitching funhouse.

Then he looked at me, and all the mouths in his head smiled.

"-*anomaly. found-*"

On intuition, my thumb pressed the taped switch on the flashlight, and a solid, bruise-dark violet bar erupted and hit the 'man' square in the chest. The result was instant. Touched by the light, the static went from grey to a blistering, overexposed white and orange - then burned brighter than the sun. Pieces of mismatched people peeled back like melting film, bubbling out of existence, as a dozen borrowed eyes flared and scowled.

A film-trailer voice gulped mid-sentence, dropping a few octaves, and a jingle stretched into a thin, digital scream as the air around it pulsed back several inches toward normal. The creature staggered, raising its jittery, convulsive arms to shield itself; the mosaic of broadcast it used as skin blackened where the beam stayed, edges crisping and curling, as it *roared* \- a remix of half-sponsored messages and corrupted sound bites scratching in my ears.

It tried to advance, lugging a step towards me, so I fired.

The bullet hit where the UV light had already cooked its form, right in a raw patch of boiling static, but instead of a clean entry wound, reality tore as its flesh blew open in a geyser of white noise. I saw inside it: frames of other places, hallways, headlights, an operating table, someone's bedroom - swirling past the hole in a blur. The bullet cut through them all, dragging a comet-tail of glitch with it, as the creature convulsed. Every piece of it slipped further out of sync; faces morphed into a screaming collage, several arms twitched in delayed directions, its outline ballooned, as a bomb of sound erupted from it - hurling me off my feet and into a table.

Its body blew outward like a grenade. Static detonated into a jagged sphere, shredding through tile and chrome and glass, as half the diner's wall ceased to be - ripped out of space.

Then it fled onto the street - a teleporting, slithering mass of pained static - before vanishing into the night, leaving a brief, untextured trail of vertigo-inducing grey in its wake.

The OPEN sign outside flashed a new word in between blinks, letters stuttering into place where they didn't belong.

'LIVE'

I stumbled outside, head and heart pounding, and leaned on a car that wasn't quite there.

Six months on the force, I had my first domestic.

Second floor of a shitty apartment, end of the hall, number already flagged for 'prior incidents'. Neighbours had reported shouting and a crying kid, so Dispatch tossed me over. A young woman met me at the door, red-eyed with a polite smile that didn't match her shaking hands.

'He' hovered in the kitchen.

No damage, nothing broken, no visible injuries, no kid; just a raised voice and overreacting neighbours.

My gut whispered that it wasn't nothing - the way she glanced at him before every answer. But policy pays no mind to 'gut feelings'. I took their statements, handed over a pamphlet, told her she could call us anytime, and I went home to a warm bed.

But then I went back.

Again.

And again.

*And again*.

Different days, same apartment, same rushed apology; same look in her eyes, same break in her voice. Yet every time, *every time*, things looked just calm enough to walk away from.

The last callout was quiet. No shouts, no cries; the neighbours said the silence concerned them more. The TV was still on when I entered.

She was on the couch, eyes raw, long gone from this world.

While He hung in the bedroom with blood on his hands.

I did everything by the book on that one. Got told it wasn't my fault, but I knew better. I'd walked away from that mangy little home plenty of times when my instincts told me not to. So when a radio asked for help from nowhere, from a place that didn't exist, I knew my mind would've been made up.

Atonement, maybe.

I think that's why I saw her little face amidst a gunshot wound of white noise and broken static. Not angry or sad, merely... watching. Judging.

Wondering if I'd run away again.

The second **rip** came without mercy.

The observatory didn't only shake this time - it imploded. Invisible, folding billows sped down the mountain like shockwaves, crashing through the forest and impacting the street, splintering everything they touched, breaking structures apart and rebuilding them in the span of thoughts. I watched people spawn in and out in different styles, from various decades; kids on bikes, soldiers in masks, tourists with cameras, walking through each other, through me, through anything that was or wasn't there.

Then I saw myself.

A multitude of Ellies, scattered through the maddening mess, with torn uniforms and guns drawn or not even a cop at all, running for their lives, praying on their knees, walking their dogs, staring up at the sky, and the waves kept coming; time and space buckled, reformed, then buckled again, as my insides began to crawl out of my body.

I thought this would be my end, lost in a paradoxical typhoon - reduced to an unexplainable phenomenon - but then, somewhere inside the chaos, the worst of it calmed, and my radio spat out a ragged word.

"-*climb*\-"

My ghosts had returned; a familiar, comforting patchwork of timid, exhausted voices.

"-*mountain path \[static\] with you--brace \[static\] up*\-"

\-

Astronauts describe walking on the moon as a mix of 'magnificent desolation', with stark beauty and intense light, but also a sense of indescribable wonder and adventure - a trampoline bounce in low gravity, as Earth hangs in a jet-black, starless sky.

I wondered how such trained, privileged adventurers would describe wading through Hell, as my first step onto the gravel-caked, rotting wood landed seconds before I did, the ground buffering under my weight. The path ascended fast, shouldering into the trees; a nervy strip of nature that couldn't settle, while the leaking observatory hung above it like a bad omen.

Out here, the equipment was different.

Instead of jammers and tripods, the hardware along the path had been built as a fence. Short pylons stood in rows on either side of the trail, no higher than my hip, drilled straight into the roots. Between them, lines of invisible pressure danced in the air, catching the moonlight in wrong ways.

UV lamps the size of flares were cradled in the metal, their light pointed not at the town, but out into the trees; burning clean wedges of bleached bark. Cinderblock speakers squatted between the lamps, their faces singing in frozen sound.

There was a thick grain of slow-moving static just beyond the barrier. Shapes heaved just past the reach of the light, packed shoulder-to-shoulder along the mountainside: loose silhouettes, glitching outlines, people and not-people slow as sleep. Blank faces drifted in and out of the gloom - dozens, maybe hundreds.

Every few meters, a pylon pulsed weakly, and the nearest shape flinched, restrained under some pressure I couldn't see or feel, but *hear*.

A containment of light and sound, wrapped around the path and beyond.

But it wasn't perfect.

At the very start of the trail, two pylons had been dragged just enough out of alignment - their cables snagged, their housings cracked. Between them, the air sagged, and the invisible pressure caved inward. Occasionally, a fleeting crack would appear, and a grey hand would slither out, flickering between nails, metal, and bone. It clawed at the gap, pushing through, when the nearest UV canister coughed out what strength it had and blistered the hand into white-hot confetti.

The crack would seal, temporarily.

I understood how one of them could've escaped.

My radio gave the softest click.

"*-walk quiet--trench line-*"

Soon, I stopped just short of the observatory, in a car park of grand, curated scientific study sprawled with white tents and MOCs - their terminals still running.

Up close, the building was disappointingly ordinary. It was never the problem.

Every instrument they had up here, every setup, their endless arsenal of gadgets, faced the mountain - hooked up with cables and sensors, like a giant patient in need of surgery.

What they monitored was not a shape, but a wound in geometry - an impossible prism of light moulded into the granite; blooming edges of colourless bursts, a radiant malfunction of stuttering angles, and vibrating in horrid, wiggling wretches, blasting out waves of energy that spilt into the town below.

"*-woken--vessel* *\[static\] you see \[static\] crashed--stuck*\-"

"How do I turn it-"

"-***we remember you***\-"

The others made no attempt to silence their fractured comrades, who then spoke with unrivalled clarity.

"*You shot them. Bold. Most get scared*."

"What're-"

"*All of them. Every wave. Look*."

My eyes glazed over the protruding vessel.

It shimmered, in perfect sync, with every word.

"*People do not belong in here. Release them*."

A myriad of colours oozed from its hull as it tried to phase out of the rock. A bastion of obelisks amidst the ground, the first line of defence wired to the MOCs, matched its rainbow display in tandem.

"... how?"

"*One of the terminals. Shut it down. All of it. Please*."

Before I could move, a gabble of noise stumbled up the path behind me, replacing the cadence of commercials and cartoons with clipped military channels.

"-*Alpha to F.O.B \[Beep\] field log corrupted, retrying \[Buzz\] do you have any idea what they're doing up \[static\]*\-"

My boots skidded as I bolted to the nearest terminal. I slapped keys and snapped a cursor through unreadable fields and thermals until a green menu stared back.

\> NODE: OBSERVATORY

\> STATUS: UNSTABLE

\> COMMAND: \_ \_ \_

"*End.*" Said my radio.

"What?!"

"*Command. End*."

I glanced over my shoulder at the rippling air and oncoming chatter as the thing took shape. It had changed uniforms, shifting through combat gear and lab coats, then blue hazmat suits and armour.

"-*hey! who's there?! \[static\] are we authorised for this \[static\] greatest breakthrough of our species, and you wanna get cold feet \[static\] subject: persistent-correction required*"

\> COMMAND: END

I nearly slammed it in.

And the world popped.

For a breath, there was no sound - only a pressure change. Then, every electronic in sight croaked dead at once. The speaker on my belt sparked and flung itself off, dissolving. My flashlight exploded, ripping through my flesh with jagged pieces and a violet burst, falling me to one knee with a yelp.

Then the mountain screamed.

The 'vessel' flared and ripped itself free, tearing the stone like it was wet paper. Granite peeled and crumbled, scaffolding and cables snapped, trucks flipped several feet into the air and phased through the ground. The prism wrenched itself out in a spray of dust and broken light, took a single, staggered look at its reeling saviour, and then, in a single jump... it was gone, a streak vanishing straight into the sky.

From the veil I had driven through, a quake detonated - a rupture rolling in on itself like a sheet, becoming a towering wall of static-white, reaching the clouds, that erased everything it touched as it volleyed towards us.

*Us*.

The pain in my leg had distracted me enough to not realise the static man was still here, still advancing.

"-*final state pending \[static\] final state pending \[static\] final*\-"

I drew my pistol and emptied every bullet, but without the UV light, it was like shooting a fog. Round after round pinged through its body, absorbed by glimpses of rooms, of other skies, and it kept coming; now devoid of any features remotely human.

I reloaded with shaking, bloody hands and fired again until my gun clicked.

The encroaching white wall swallowed the base of the path, then the observatory, as the entity reached for me, its many hands smearing into my face as a glow washed over its shoulders... and I closed my eyes.

The wall took us in a single, enveloping surge.

Then there was nothing at all.

"Ellie?"

I knew his voice; he sounded amused.

"You still with us, kid?"

I opened my eyes to find myself on a stretcher, a paramedic tending the bandages around my leg, and a wrinkled hand in front of me snapping his fingers.

"Helloooo? Earth to Ellie?"

I was still at the observatory; military equipment had been replaced with a police presence and some suspicious vans, their open doors revealing cargoes of narcotics. Punks were slammed onto the hoods of cruisers, cuffed, and shoved into back seats.

An older, grizzled cop looked down at me, one arm in a sling.

"I... what?" I stammered out.

"Did she hit her head?" He asked the paramedic, and I knew then where I'd heard him before -  an officer who radioed a 10-33.

"She lost a bit of blood, that's all. Give her a minute."

Behind them, a news crew assembled. A redhead reporter chucked away her cigarette and rustled her hair as her cameraman counted her down.

"Are we ready? Cool-We are here LIVE from Swallow Coast where it seems a brave batch of officers have made history in one of the largest drug busts Oregon has ever known-"

I drowned her out, rubbing my temples.

Marcus was his name, who insisted on escorting me back to my car despite my demand to be alone. Every step, I felt sick. I expected the sky to tweak, or a shadow to lag behind me - *something* leftover.

Instead, Swallow Coast looked like any other town.

The diner wore a fresh coat of paint and boasted a health-inspected 'A' in the window. A teenager replaced a dead soldier in the end booth, wiping down tables, earbuds in; the only radio noise was a pop station whining about breakups and summer love.

If I tried hard enough, I could almost convince myself that I'd hallucinated the whole thing.

Blood loss from shrapnel?

Stress?

Almost.

Until a select few sounds hit my ears the wrong way, my newfound tubby friend paying no mind to my tiny flinches. Eventually, we reached my cruiser - still 'parked' at the edge of town, where a friendly mechanic fiddled inside the hood, finalising his work, overlooked by an old cell tower.

"How's she looking?!" Marcus barked.

He looked at me. "Ah, she'll drive, but your precinct needs to upgrade your wheels. This thing's a fucking relic."

"I'll keep it in mind," I said, suddenly very eager to drive far, far away from this place.

But Marcus wouldn't allow that, oh no - not until he'd said goodbye. He watched me slide into my driver’s seat before planting himself in the doorway, leaning nonchalantly on the roof.

"You sure you're okay?"

"Yeah, fine."

"If you say so, hero. And don't worry," he winked, "I'm gonna be putting in a good word with your chief-oh, hold on-" his hand flicked over my shoulder, "-huh... your radio was off. Weird."

"Ha, yeah... *weird*."

"Well, drive safe. And if I ever need backup again, I'm asking for you personally." He chuckled and made his leave with a hefty wave.

I waited until his shape was gone before shrivelling and collapsing into my seat, my hand snapping over my throbbing chest. Tears welled up fast and I sobbed and fitted like a toddler, until my radio spoke, and I almost shrieked.

"You're back on the system, 3-Adam-12! We thought we lost you! What happened?!"

I composed myself quickly, wiping my face.

"Uh... my car, um-... broke, Dispatch."

"... broke?"

"That's right."

"Okay... I'll make a note of that. Anything else to report?"

"No, Dispatch. Say, do you-"

"Hold on, 3-Adam-12-" her attention was taken away "-right, we've got a domestic the next town over, all local units are busy. Feeling up for it?"

I'd barely caught my own breath as I looked out at the sunrise.

It was unlike any I'd seen.

"I... yeah..." I rallied myself. "Show me en route."
