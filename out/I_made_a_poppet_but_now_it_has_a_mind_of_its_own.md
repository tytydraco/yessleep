I have always been enraptured by witchcraft. The feeling of having some control in a universe that is so mysterious and unforgiving has always appealed to me, as someone who otherwise felt so inconsequential.

In addition, I have always been obsessed with rules, and lived my life blindly following the moral standards that had been set by people older and wiser than me. But as I grew older and wiser myself those rules began to release their chokehold, and I began to see the world for what it was. It was not a world suited for someone like me. I would never get ahead. I would never find much success. I felt boxed in, a victim of my circumstance, but with my beliefs I thought I could alleviate some of the hardships I faced through my thorough knowledge of witchcraft, and I was mildly successful. I was able to increase my income, luck, and overall circumstance.

I never intended to dabble in the dark side; I always ensured my spells were innocuous. I started to understand that the world *cannot* be black and white in all instances as my rules had previously led me to believe. As I grew, everything around me began to feel scary, unstable even. When you add in the news, Reddit, and everyone on all the other social media sites feeding this frenzy of discontent I began to feel even more discouraged. I began to feel that even with supernatural manipulation on my side, I would never be able to dig myself out of the hole I was born into. And that’s when I began to study hexes and curses.

I should’ve never strayed from my rules. I should’ve never studied these things, and even if I couldn’t have prevented my foray into the night, I should’ve at least done more studying, more fact checking, but hindsight is 20/20.

One night, while walking alone downtown in an effort to simply return home safely from work, I was a victim of unspeakable acts. In the fray I was able to grab a strand of hair, and as someone who, I thought, had thoroughly studied curses, I decided to enact my revenge.

In order to cast a curse you need to be enraged. It can’t be cast in response to a minor slight; in my view, that would’ve been an abuse of power. But this was no minor slight. This was an attack by a vile person that could not go scot free. I tried to put my faith in the justice system, but they failed me, and the perpetrator was found not guilty. He walked free, and he stalked and harassed me for speaking out. I attempted to find protection again in the law and, once again, the law failed me. So, as someone who felt empowered by the cosmos I decided to take matters into my own hands. It was the only thing I could do to feel as though I had some form of protection.

This person met all of my standards for resorting to dark magic. They had broken the rules of our world first, so I felt as though I could break the rules now. They, in my eyes, were depraved, vile, and deserving of retribution. I built a poppet by hand, in their likeness, with their strand of hair. I dressed the poppet in rags. I stuffed the head with thorns to cause headaches. I added mint in the belly for impotence. I wanted unrelenting pain, and an inability to ever commit this type of crime again. All that was left was to breathe life into the poppet to allow it to carry out the curses I had set in motion. But in my frenzy and anger I had forgotten the most crucial step: a death date.

All things that live must die, curses included. Without a death date a poppet lives on in perpetuity, growing wiser, stronger, eventually taking on a mind of its own.

I had never confined it, and I honestly don’t think it would’ve made a difference if I had. My first clue was when the poppet began to move on its own. I questioned it at first; I thought there was no way it was actually in a spot that I had not left it in. I never witnessed the actual movement, so therefore, in my mind, I must’ve put it there and forgotten. And then it began to go missing for days at a time before reappearing, slightly more disheveled than the last time I’d seen it. Even if I’d caught on, I’d have had no way of fixing what had been set in motion on my own. I didn’t have the knowledge to break the curse, and didn’t even know where to begin to look for help. 

The poppet was connected to the person I cursed. It was immeshed, and as it grew in independence it began to take on traits of the person I was most trying to avoid. Left alone for long enough, it began to remove the curses I had placed. The thorns were torn from the head. The mint was found strewn on my bedroom floor. It had effectively removed the curses from the person who, I suppose, it had decided to side with.

Things escalated. I would wake up and the poppet would be perched on my pillow, watching me in the dark. I would hear odd thumps in my apartment, but when I would investigate my doors were still locked and no one was inside. And then I began to see him. The one I’d moved 2,000 miles to get away from, standing just across the street from my apartment building, barely veiled within the shadows, looking, lurking.

Last night I woke up, drenched in a cold sweat. My head was pounding, and the steady thump, thump, thump, coming from my living room only intensified the pain. I held my head in an attempt to quell the headache that continued to intensify while I stumbled out of bed, making my way out of my room. 

When I entered the hall the incessant thumping became clear. I made the short walk down toward the living room, peeking just slightly around the corner to see him sitting on the floor, slamming his head over and over into the wall. I instantly felt that he knew I was there, watching, and he slowly turned toward me, an insane grin plastered on his face, while he continued to rhythmically slam his head into the wall, over and over and over. I was frozen in fear, unable to take my eyes off him, as he rose to his feet with the maniacal grin unwavering. He stared me down while side stepping toward the front door, which he slowly opened and, as he was closing it behind him, whispered into the sliver that remained “I’ll be back.”

The poppet has disappeared. I don’t know where to even begin looking for it, and even if I had it, I have no idea how to break this curse. I am not nearly as knowledgeable as I thought, and I should’ve never dabbled in this magic. But I wanted to come here to ask for help. If anyone knows how I can break this without the poppet I need to know, right now. I think I have until midnight before it comes back for me, and at this rate I don’t think I’ll survive the [night.](https://www.reddit.com/r/cmpaizspooks/s/U9GTpEseBq)
