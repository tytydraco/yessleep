We’ve been through a lot, my family. I wouldn’t be surprised if you had read about some of it. My daughter, Mira Callahan, went missing when she was just six years years old. Brunette, freckles, a gap tooth smile- if you remember the posters?

She also had a stork bite birthmark on the back of her neck. She always hated when people called it a "stork bite" - we told her it can also be called an “angel kiss” -  she said she said liked “fairy kiss” better -  so that’s what we called it, as a family. But “stork bite birthmark” was what was filed under distinguishing features in her missing person’s report.  

That was ten years ago - when Mira went missing. It made national news - got some international attention too. We were living on a small island off the West Coast of Canada - a quiet, tight-knit community - it’s where I was born, where I grew up - nothing like that ever happens there, so it was big news. Also because of what Bly told everybody.

Blythe, my wife, had taken our daughter to the beach for a night swim. I know what tons of people were saying- *Why let her take your little daughter into the ocean so late?* But Blythe said there was bioluminescence. I grew up on that island  -  getting to swim in sparkly water was one of the best parts of childhood summers. If you ever got to do that, you’d know you’d want your kid to have that experience too.

Plus my daughter was obsessed with fairies and swimming in bioluminescence is the closest most people will ever come to feeling like a fairy. I was happy they were going.

But, honestly, the main reason I felt happy about them going was because I thought it would be great bonding time. And I thought the two of them going alone was important too. Bly had been struggling to find ways to connect with our daughter since she was born. She’d had a really traumatic birth - it traumatic for all of us, really- I almost lost both of them. Anyway, it made total sense that Bly was whacked with heavy postpartum depression after that. I figured she’d feel better eventually - and things did get a bit better, but she never really seemed to get past it, and I think that made it hard for her to really connect with Mira. I figured going for this swim would been a great opportunity for them to share some fun bonding time together.

I loved Blythe with all my heart and I couldn’t- *wouldn’t*\- believe Blythe would ever hurt Mira. But after that night… well… I honestly just didn’t know what to think. Nothing Blythe said made any sense. I knew in my heart that she’d never hurt Mira - but… I just couldn’t trust her anymore. 

I don’t think I ever stopped loving Blythe. But not knowing what happened to Mira… not being able to figure it out… have an answer… It almost drove me crazy. Eventually, I knew I had to move off the island.

Blythe stayed though. She always said she couldn’t move - in case Mira came back, she said. She said she didn’t want Mira to come home and find another family in her house. So she stayed. But I left - because I truly believed that Mira was never coming home. 

Blythe was a writer. Not professionally, I mean, but she wrote all the time. She journaled almost every day- that’s what's important - that’s what I wanted to tell you. Because I want to share some of what she wrote.

Because I think I finally know what happened to our daughter. 

*From Blythe’s Journal, when Mira went missing:*

*———————————————————————————————*

I find myself in the police station. I just sit there. I feel my hands trembling as I grip the edge of the table. I can’t let go. I can’t shake the voice in my brain screaming at me to stay calm. I know I need to stay calm. But I can’t. I can’t stay calm. The whole night feels like a nightmare that I’m stuck in. I can’t get out. I’m wildly trying to make sense of things I can’t possibly make sense of.

The buzz of the fluorescent lights above me sound deafening- but at the same time sound far far away. Evans sits across from me, staring at me. Like she’s waiting for me to speak. Did she just say something? I can’t tell. But I know she wants me to talk about tonight. But I can’t. When I try to speak, I find the words catch in my throat. I’ve told the police what happened already and they didn’t believe me. I get that. Would I believe me? *Do I believe me? Have I gone crazy?* No! No, I know I haven’t. 

I find myself pacing. I don’t think telling them what happened again is going to make a difference. I feel frantic energy building in my chest - my head - my limbs. Every bit of me feels like it’s on fire inside- my body feels like it’s going to explode. My thoughts race- tumbling, jumbled. I can’t keep up with them.

I don’t get why I’m here. At the police station. I shouldn’t be here. This isn’t helping. We shouldn’t be wasting time. I need to be out there, looking for Mira! The thought of her- Mira- my little girl- alone- out there- somewhere- I can’t handle thinking about it. I find myself focusing intently on the colour of the interview room wall. Grey. Dingy grey. Years since the paint’s been freshened. I stop pacing - try desperately to ground myself - to feel my body in the room. I can’t lose control. I can’t. I need to stay calm. They can’t think I’m crazy. That’s important. Very important. 

I focus on feeling my presence in the room. I realize I feel cold. I remember my clothes are wet. I haven’t been able to change out of my wet clothes. Wet from the ocean. Wet from our swim. 

I hear Evans asking me about earlier this evening. “Mrs. Callahan? How were you feeling earlier this evening? Before you went swimming?”

Mrs. Callahan. That’s me. I know that. But no one ever calls me that - I feel like she’s talking to someone else. I look to her. Constable Evans. Focusing now on the colour of her eyes. Green. With flecks of brown. Hazel eyes. I’m trying to stay present, but with Evans’ question I’m being forced into the past. Earlier this evening… It feels like an echo. A shadow of reality. So far detached from the world I’m now in, it feels like a fantasy. How was I feeling earlier this evening? 

“Fine.” I say. That one word was all I could push out.  

*Fine*. I had been fine. Not great. But *fine*. That was the truth. I’d been fine, not great, but fine, for a good while before this evening. Years, in fact. But I don’t need to tell her that. 

She’s still staring at me. I know she wants more. She thinks she needs more. That more may bring Mira back to us. But is telling her more really going to help?! I feel fury rise in me- overtaking me. Mira being gone has nothing to do with me! I want to scream at her. Earlier this evening has nothing to do with what happened! But I know screaming that at her isn’t going to help get Mira back. I bite my tongue. I taste the blood in my mouth. Sweet, metallic. I take a breath in, pulling all my feelings deeply inward, holding them like a steel ball inside my chest. 

I close my eyes. And I remember earlier. 

I remember our house, the kitchen, the sound of water splashing against the sink as I wash the dishes from dinner. Dominic comes in. He’d been reading a bedtime story to Mira. As he comes in, he’s smiling. A smile that makes me feel bitter despite knowing that makes no sense. He loves reading to Mira. He loves being a Dad. Getting to read her bedtime stories is one of his favourite parts of being a Dad, that’s what he’s always said. So he’s smiling. He doesn’t understand how his unburdened smile makes me feel like I should always be smiling as easily as him. I know that’s not fair to Dominic. But that’s what I feel. He smiles, and I try not to frown. 

I don’t know why I’m writing all this down. I think, maybe, I’m wondering if Evans was right. Maybe there is something I should’ve been paying attention to. Something that I missed. Maybe something in here, in my memory, is important? I have to comb through it - try and remember it all. 

I ask Dominic if Mira is asleep.

“Out cold,” he says, celebrating with an even brighter smile. He’s always had an infectious smile. It’s what first attracted me to him, years ago. I try to remember that. Let that infectious smile spread to me rather than sting me with guilt. I let myself smile. For a moment, it feels good. The way it’s supposed to. 

I used to smile more. Smile effortlessly. 

What strikes me now is that Mira never knew that me. The old me. The Blythe she knows- the mother she knows- is stressed. Anxious. Easy to temper. No wonder she likes spending time with her Dad more. I should’ve pressed harder to keep my job. Dominic would’ve been better at home. If it was me taking the ferry to work in town every day, would Mira miss me as much as she misses him? Would she run into my arms the way she runs into his when he gets back? Would’ve I taken her to the beach tonight if I wasn’t so desperate to find a way to bond with her? 

But Dominic’s job pays better than mine ever would. It made sense for me to give up my job - stay with Mira. 

I wish we never moved here. To this island. 

But raising her here- near Dominic’s sister, near people he grew up with - it seemed like the best thing for Mira. And she’d have a cousin her age to grow up with. It sounded perfect. I wanted to move here. No one forced me. I didn’t realize now lonely I’d be. How hard it would be. The pressure of keeping her safe. 

Why am I thinking about all this? Because I desperately want things to have been different - so we didn’t end up here - with Mira gone. But I can’t change the past no matter how hard I think about it. She’s gone. 

I need to get her back. I have to focus. This evening. This evening. What happened this evening. 

Dominic read her a bedtime story. I ask him what he read her. 

“That book of old fairytales Rhiannon brought over,” he tells me. “My Mom used to read it to us when we were little. But I forgot how messed up some fairytales are. I don’t think they’re meant for kids.”

That makes me nervous. Old fairytales aren’t lovely and whimsical, they’re scary - the German ones, the Irish ones… “I hope the book’s not going to give her nightmares,” I say.  

Dominic shrugs off my worries. “She’ll be fine,” he says. Then he tells me: “You know, I think she wants you to read to her sometime. She asked why it’s always me. Made quite a stink about it, actually. “Why does it always have to be you, Daddy? Why? Whyyyyy?” 

I doubt this is true. This is probably another one of his attempts to get me to bond with her more. But he doesn’t say that though. He goes on laughing about how he responded- he said something like, “Well, pardon me, your highness, is my theatrical ability not up to your royal standards?”

“Did you tell her you’re much better at it than me?” I know my voice was sharp when I ask this. I couldn’t help it. But I don’t think he noticed because he just went on: 

“I don’t know... maybe you’re hiding some secret Thespian talent I don’t know about,” he teases. 

I tell him I’m not.

He presses: “How can you know if you don’t try?”

I know. I tell him that.  

He pokes me playfully - “But dooooo youuuuu?” - he’s smiling at me as he pokes me. He’s not being mean or anything. 

But I snap. “Don’t push me, Dominic! Ok!” 

I’m too quick putting a dish into the dish rack. It cracks against another one. Stupid. I should’ve been more careful. I lost control. I feel that familiar wave of shame crash onto me. 

Dominic doesn’t get angry though. He hardly ever does when I lose my temper. He’s annoyingly understanding. “Ok. No prob,” he says. “I can do story time. I think she just wants to spend time with you, that’s all.”

I just don’t want to do story time. I don’t get why he doesn’t understand that. I notice the plate now has a chip in it. I must’ve sworn loudly because I see Dominic’s eyes flick to Mira’s room - worried I may’ve woken her up. But he doesn’t say that. He doesn’t chastise me for swearing - for raising my voice. He tries to settle me. “Don’t worry, ‘hun, it’s fine. It’s just a small chip. Still totally usable.”

This makes me feel even worse. He’s treating me like some fragile china doll he doesn’t want accidentally break. Not like his wife. Not like me. I try to keep my tears from falling because I know if I start crying, I won’t be able to stop. And I’m tired of crying. I don’t want to cry tonight. I want tonight to be an ok night. I can tell that’s what Dominic wants too. 

He kisses me. “Everything’s fine. Ok?”

I love Dominic with all my heart, but he doesn’t understand that just saying “everything’s fine” doesn’t make everything fine. I feel my eyes glazing with tears. But I’m not going to cry. I pull away. I tell him I’m going to go check I didn’t wake up Mira. He assures me I haven’t woken her, but I go anyway. I just need an excuse to move. 

I peek through Mira’s door. Her nightlight casts a dim glow across her bedroom. Snuggled in the middle of her bed, surrounded by a mound of stuffed animals - plus numerous cut outs of dancing fairies taped to her wall - she looks like a fairytale princess. Sleeping Beauty. Opposite of the rambunctious rascal I usually get during the day. 

I’m just about to leave when something catches my eye. The curtain on Mira’s window ripples slightly. I cross her room, walking to it as quietly as I can so I don’t wake her. I push aside the curtain to see the window is open. I peer outside. Mira’s window is facing the forest. There are no lights of houses or anything. It’s pitch black. I can’t remember if I listened closely enough. I try to remember, but I can’t. I don’t remember hearing anything strange. A quiet rustle of leaves maybe? I can’t remember. I do remember I slide the window closed and lock it with a latch. 

I go back to Dominic. He’s taken over washing the dishes. 

“She was still asleep, right?” He says. 

I don’t answer. “I told you to keep Mira’s window closed at night,” I tell him instead. 

“It’s a warm night and the night air is good for her,” Dominic says.  

I feel a spike of anger. I think I was angry not because he was being stupid or anything - more because he wasn’t worrying like I was. I have to hold the burden of worry while he seems free of it. It doesn’t feel fair. 

“Anyone can just climb in.” I tell him. 

“That’s not going to- Bly, when’re you going to shake that city brain of yours? No one’s going to- We know everyone on the island.”

“You do,” I tell him. 

I see him hesitate after I say this. Then: ‘Hun, I was thinking, now you’re feeling better... maybe you can try and get out a bit more?” 

“I get out,” I tell him.  

“I mean, meet people. Music nights at the Pub are fun. Or my sisters’s got that book club thing I’m sure you’d be welcome at. You can get to know more people that way. Join the community.”

He’s always pushing me to do more things. As if I don’t have enough to do at home.  

Then the house lights flicker dark - then go bright again. Strange. We get power outages all the time in the winter, when it’s stormy. But it’s summer. And it wasn’t even windy out. 

“A branch probably just touching a line.” Dominic says. 

I agree. I ask if he wants me to finish the dishes. Dominic says it’s fine, they’re almost done. So I tell him I’m going to go for a walk. “Just need a bit of quiet out of the house.”

Dominic says, “Yeah, sure. Where’re you going?”

I don’t know. Just out. I don’t tell him that though. I tell him, “Just down the road. Won’t be long.”

I step out onto the road. Feel the night close in around me. The darkness. No streetlights out here, not like in the city. Just shadows stretching from the trees that loom over the few houses spattered along the road. I pass Dominic’s sister’s house. See her and Beth watching TV - Libby will be asleep, just like Mira. I keep walking. The homes glow faintly, windows warmly lit. Someone’s dog barks a ways off - it’s sharp and sudden, but then silence settles again.

I walk past the houses. Let their warm light fade behind me as I turn onto the narrow dirt path leading into the trees. I can’t see much ahead of me now. But that’s ok. I know where I’m going. I hear the gravel path crunch under my shoes. With each step, the dark swallows me.

I walk in darkness. In silence.

Then I step out from the trees, onto the rocky beach. The sound of ocean waves lap gently at the shore. I can see more here, the beach illuminated by the stars and moon. It’s beautiful. I take a deep breath in. Let it out. The air is cool and salty. But no amount of deep breathing settles the churning in my chest. 

I bend, grabbing onto a stone at my feet- I chuck it into the sea.

I hear a tiny sploosh.

Pathetic. 

Am I looking for some sort of epic, crashing, resounding, noise that will somehow release the pent up energy I’m holding? I don’t know. But I know I crouch to find a bigger rock. I find one, heavy and jagged. I pick it up - it’s heavy enough I need two hands. I pull my arms back - then hurl it out to sea with everything I have. I watch the the rock hit the water with a heavy splash. Except something about it is strange. The water seems to light up where the rock lands. Then the brilliant light trails behind the rock as it sinks to the sea floor.

I kick off my shoes. I gather up the bottom of my dress in one hand. And I step forward. The cold shocks me as my feet make the first plunge into the water. But I continue on. As I move, I watch as each step leaves a glowing trail behind me. The light in the water sparkles as it dissipates. I wade in deeper, until my hand can reach the water. I wave it around me, watching it leave a glittering wake. Dominic told me about bioluminescence, but I’d never actually seen it in person. I watch my hand glide through the water, leaving streams of light behind. It looks as if magic is pouring from my fingertips.

I wade in deeper. I let my skirt drop into the water. Watch it flow around me in the soft, ghostly light. Then I let myself fall backward into the sea, arms outstretched. I hear myself laughing. Floating on my back, I stare up, taking in the endless sky above, sparkling with stars as I feel the sea glittering around me. I feel weightless. Part of everything and yet still totally me in the amazing expanse.

I wave my arms, carving glowing arcs around me - I watch light form around my limbs like wings. I picture myself from afar. A tiny, flickering speck of light in the vast darkness of the sea. Like a fairy flying. 

Miri loves fairies. 

I have to show her this, I think. I find myself excited to show her. I know she’ll love it. I run back home. 

Dominic doesn’t want to come with us. He has to be up for the 5am ferry, so wants to get to sleep. But he’s happy for me to take Mira. I wake her up. It takes some convincing to get her to come with me. She wants Dad to come. 

I tell her, “There’s a special surprise waiting for you at the beach.” 

“What kind of surprise?”

“It wouldn’t be a surprise if I told you, now, would it? Come on, Mira!”

I find her bathing suit. She’s still in bed, so I pull the covers off her. She curls into a grumpy ball. I’m feeling the positive energy I found at the beach draining away from me. Am I making a mistake? But I rally. I know she’ll love it if I can just get her down there. 

“Fine, Mira, I’ll tell you the secret, ok. The ocean is sparkling! It has fairy lights in it!”

She’s excited now. She changes into her bathing suit and I pop her towel over her. 

I never thought that I’d have to describe what this towel looked like to police. It’s a long poncho-style beach towel with a creature faced hood. I told them her cousin Libby had one and Mira had been so jealous so her Aunty Rhi made one for her as well. I could never quite tell if it was supposed to be a dragon, a lizard, or some other sort of monster. It was green and blue. Libby had one in pink and yellow. I always thought they looked a little weird, but the kids loved it. I told the police all of this because they said anything I could tell them was important. 

So me and my little monster head out to the beach. I take my cell phone this time so I light our way with the flashlight. Mira’s always been a little scared of the dark. 

As we’re walking past the houses, I notice the lights inside flicker. Then all the house lights darken. The power’s gone out.

We continue down the dark road. I hope the power will be back when we get home. But there’ll still be hot water in the tank for a warm-up shower for Mira. And we have our camp stove - maybe I’ll make her some hot chocolate. That’s what I’m thinking when Mira says: 

“What’s that?”

“What’s what?” I ask her. She’s looking up into the sky. 

“Those lights,” she says. 

“The stars?” I ask her. 

“No,” she tells me, “they were moving. Right across the sky. They’re gone now.”

I tell her she must’ve seen a shooting star. “Lucky you! Make a wish, Mira!”

Though I remember thinking that she said lights - plural - she probably didn’t see a bunch of shooting stars. But I didn’t think anything of it. We turn down the small path to the beach. 

The next part is exactly what I told Dominic. It’s what I told the police. It’s what I’m still trying to make sense of. This is what happened: 

We were swimming. Mira absolutely loved it. The bioluminescence, she loved it. But she got cold after a bit. So I took her back. Back onto the beach. I wrapped her in her creature towel. She was sitting on the shore- she was right there. I could see her. She was fine. I just wanted a couple more minutes in the water.

I was in the water- showing her my fairy wings- then, I saw something. We both did. Mira saw it too. In the sky. It sounds crazy, but I think- No, I don’t think- I know. I know it was a ship. A space ship. It came down from the sky. Just dropped right down, and hovered there over the beach. It was crackling with light. Lights all over. It took her. They took Mira. 

I couldn’t get to her in time. I watched as she flew up. I mean, she didn’t fly- she was lifted. Lifted up to the ship by nothing. It looked like she was flying. 

It all happened so quickly. 

I tried to get back to her- to grab her- But then there was this humming - then a huge blast of white light. I couldn’t see a thing. Then it was gone. Like it had just vanished into thin air. 

I couldn’t believe she’d just been taken like that. It impossible. I searched everywhere - all along the beach, in the woods - even though I knew she wasn’t there. But I couldn't accept she was gone - just like that. I call Dominic - he calls the police - calls his sister, who calls neighbours. Everyone searches. But she was gone. She is gone. Whoever they were, they took Mira. 

The police think I’m crazy. The look on Evans’ face when she asked me- “Just so I understand clearly, are you saying that aliens took your daughter?” It wasn’t until that moment when I realized that I may not be believed. Of course, I understand  now how crazy it sounds, what I’m telling them. But it’s the truth. I can’t change the truth to make it make more sense to everyone. 

The police take me into the station to ask me questions. They get me to draw what I saw. I tell them I’m terrible at drawing. But they want to see it. I draw the shape - a cigar shape, with lights along the side. I see what they see - it looks like some goofy image from a sci-fi movie. It looks like a joke. 

I know they don’t believe me. 

Worse, I think they think I have something to do with Mira being gone. 

I can’t believe she’s gone. 

But at the same time, it feels like something I’ve been waiting for since she was born. Since I almost killed her giving birth. Since the doctors resuscitated her. I realize that I’ve been living in terror since that day - so acutely aware that she could be taken from me at any second. And now she’s gone. 

Now that she’s gone, I realize I think I was keeping her at a distance because I was afraid to love her. Afraid to love her because I knew I could lose her. I wasted my time with her.

I’m not going to lose her! I need to get her back. I’ve failed her in every other way. I can’t fail her again. Somehow, I have to get her back!

———————————————————————-

I had read that entry sometime in the days following Mira’s disappearance. Search & Rescue, the Coast Guard, and basically everyone on the island, had looked for Mira but there wasn’t a trace of her. I know it seems slimy to read your wife’s private journal but I promise I had never read any of them before this. Even when I was worried about her when she was dealing with her depression - and wondered if reading them could help me help her - but I knew doing that would be a horrible, inexcusable, invasion of privacy. I know it is. But after Mira disappeared, I was broken and I didn’t know what else to do. 

I figured Blythe would write about what happened and I guess I thought maybe she’d write something different. I mean, maybe she’d reveal something she hadn’t told me that could help me understand. I feel terrible about it now - that I didn’t trust her. 

I waited until Blythe was asleep, then I read it. But the story there was the same as what she told me - about the space ship taking Mira.

I still didn’t believe it though. I figured something happened to Mira, and maybe Blythe was dealing with it with this alien story of hers. I couldn’t figure out if she really actually believed it - or maybe she just really really wanted to believe it. I didn’t know what to think at all. 

Like I told you, I ended up moving off the island. It was all too much for me. My sister, Rhiannon, was convinced that Blythe had something to do with Mira’s disappearance. She wanted me to divorce Bly, but I wasn’t going to do that, I just needed some time. A couple months off island eventually turned into years. 

I know Constable Evans thought Blythe did something too. But there was never any evidence to prove anything. I wouldn’t let myself believe Blythe did anything, especially not without proof. But I didn’t think Mira was ever coming back to us. 

I’ve been reading Blythe’s journals again, trying to figure out what happened next. 

There were years of writing about trying to get Mira back. I skimmed all this - seeing if anything important jumped out. She’d been trying to communicate with  aliens. Nothing was working. She wrote about people she’d connected with online who shared their own stories of abductions. A lot of them sounded crazy. There were situations with people on the island - she was pushed away from everyone. People posted on the island forum the things they wouldn’t say to her face -  some called her a “cold blooded murderer” outright - others begged her to “come forward and reveal the truth” - some advocated for “innocent until proven guilty” or others begged pity upon someone who “has clearly lost it”. She read each thing people said about her meticulously. Bly didn’t have any friends. She couldn’t get a job (I knew this because I kept supporting her - but I didn’t really realize how hard that was for her until reading her journals). No one would talk to her at the store - on the street - anywhere. She was ostracized. More than once she wrote about people spray painting nasty things on the house. But she didn’t want to move. She was totally consumed with getting Mira back. She kept replacing missing posters every time the ones posted started to fade. She’d celebrate Mira’s birthday every year - bake a cake and everything. She’d watch our niece grow up like Mira was supposed to - watching each year pass on Libby’s face. 

I’m not going to share any of those those entries though. It’s these are the ones that I want you to read:

—————————————————————-

Mira’s back. 

How am I even writing this? It doesn’t seem real. But it is! 

It’s happened! She’s back! She’s here! 

She’s sleeping now. Snuggled in her bed. In her room I’ve kept clean and ready for her return. It was ready for her. For this day. And today’s her birthday too. A day that’s been so hard for me for so many years - now turned into the best day I’ve ever had! 

I can’t take my eyes off her. I’m sitting by her as I write this. Mira, she’s right there. There in front of me. I’m watching her chest rise and fall as she sleeps. It’s really her. Her freckles, her gap tooth, her birthmark on her neck - all there. I had to check because I couldn’t believe it at first. But it’s her. It's Mira.

But I can’t tell anyone. I don’t think I can even tell Dominic. Not yet anyway. I know I have to- but how?

No one can know. Because they’ll take her away from me. I can’t let her go now that I finally have her again. I have to keep her here. Keep her safe. 

If they know she’s here, they’ll take her. They’ll do tests on her. I can’t let that happen. She has to stay with me. 

It’s her birthday today. Her sixteenth birthday. 

But she’s still a little girl. She hasn’t aged at all. She looks exactly the same as the day I last saw her. 

I don’t know how. She doesn’t either. I don’t think she remembers anything. But she seems ok. She seems fine. 

She was in the woods. She didn’t look scared. She was just standing there. When I found her. 

It’s stormy tonight. A wild wind that’s still blowing. The power went off. I expected it to. But it still shakes me every time it happens. It always reminds me of the night Mira was taken. 

I had just opened a bottle of wine. Was sipping it as I lit some candles around the house - it was late -  pitch dark. I was planning on getting at least half way through the bottle before taking Mira’s cake out of the fridge. The birthday cake I thought I’d be eating alone. A decade long birthday ritual. I’d bought the ingredients for it yesterday. Libby was working cashier at the store. I could tell she knew it was for Mira’s birthday, but she didn’t say anything. She’s not allowed to talk to me. They’re supposed to be the same age - Mira and Libby. Sixteen. Libby’s birthday is exactly a week before Mira’s. They had joint parties when they were young. Libby knew, but didn't say anything.

As I’m lighting a hurricane lamp, out of the corner of my eye, I see something out the window. 

My heart stops. It’s a child - wearing a green hooded monster towel, just like the one Mira had. I think maybe my eyes are playing tricks on me. Am I drunk? I haven’t even had a full glass of wine yet. It’s not Mira, Mira’s not a little child anymore, that’s not Mira. But it is a child. Wearing a towel just like Mira’s. Fury waves over me as I wonder if someone’s playing with me. 

I run outside. “Hey!” I yell. “What are you doing out here?” 

But the kid doesn’t move. She’s just standing there. 

I look around - there are no adults around. Who would let their kid out alone in weather like this?

I approach the child - “You should be inside.” 

Then she turns to me. I see her face. It’s Mira. 

I feel my breath leave me - my limbs abandon me - I fall to my knees.

I watch as Mira walks towards me. Is she a ghost? But she wraps her arms around me. She’s real. Not a ghost. I can feel her arms around me. I hug her as tightly as I can. Tears are falling down my face. 

I look at her again. “You’re back? How?”

Mira looks confused. She doesn’t say anything. The wind is howling around us. I scoop her up and take her inside. 

I ask her where she’s been. She shrugs. She doesn’t know? I watch her walk about the house, looking into rooms. I think she’s looking for Dominic. 

“Daddy’s in town,” I tell her. I still don’t know if she realizes how long has passed. I don’t want to scare her. I’ll let her settle first. Then maybe she’ll tell me something. 

She’s still in her bathing suit and towel. What she was wearing when she was taken. I get her some pyjamas for her to change into. I feel like I’ve travelled back in time. That this is just any other night, a decade ago. 

But Mira’s not her usual chatty self. She hasn’t even said one word. She must be in some sort of shock. Has she been traumatized? What happened to her? I’m terrified to know the answer to this. 

I close all the curtains in the house. I don’t want neighbours seeing her. I am elated she’s back, but I know it’s not right. Something’s not right - she should be older. If people see her - there’s no way they’ll leave her alone. She’s so little. She’s been through enough. She doesn’t need to be poked and prodded by doctors. The media - it would be insane. They wouldn’t leave her alone. No, no one can know she’s back. Not yet, at least. I need time to figure things out. 

I take out her birthday cake. I tell her it’s her birthday today and she looks confused again. I don’t tell her it’s supposed to be her sixteenth. She seems happy to eat the cake though. She eats two huge pieces and goes for another. I let her. “Thank you,” she says. Those were the first words she says. When she says it, she separates the words. “Thank. You.” It sounded a little odd. Like she was remembering how to talk again or something. 

“What happened to you?” I ask her gently. Mira looks confused again. She doesn’t say anything. 

I know I need to tell Dominic she’s back. But I have to figure out how. Right now, I’m just going to focus on keeping her safe. 

I ask if she wants a bedtime story before bed. She nods. 

We go to her bedroom. I ask which story she wants. I point to her bookshelf saying she can choose any one she likes. She pulls one off the shelf. A book of fairytales.

I sit beside Mira. She snuggles in. I feel her head resting on me. My heart feels like it’s going to burst. This is what I’ve been waiting for all these years. I want to cry again. But I don’t. I let myself smile instead. 

I start reading.

“Long ago, in a small village nestled amongst the green hills of Ireland, there lived a young mother named Brigid. She had a beautiful baby boy named Cillian. His hair was as dark as a raven’s wing and his eyes blue as the summer sky. Brigid loved her son dearly and kept him very close, for she knew the old stories… Tales of the Fair Folk who took beautiful human children and left one of their own in their-

Mira slams the book shut. 

“I want to sleep,” she says. 

I tell her, “Yes, yes, you need rest. Get some sleep.” I step out of her room. The way she slammed the book shut, it’s left me feeling rattled. 

I’m watching her sleep now. Her chest rising and falling.
