I’m so angry and afraid all the time and I don’t know what to do about it. 

After what happened with Shadow I feel like a different person. I’ve never been quick to anger, always a tranquil little pond of emotions on the inside. But now there’s this storming thing inside me. It’s a deep pit that goes on and on.

A week ago my childhood dog, Shadow, showed up after thirty years. Only it wasn't a dog, really. Within twenty-four hours he'd possessed both my wife and my mother, and I had fled with my infant son to my sister's house. 

A few days later I brought two experts in the paranormal to the house to try to exorcize or otherwise banish Shadow, but we barely made it out of the house. 

**I didn’t go back until last night.**

Hawthorne and Taryn, the paranormal experts, pulled me out of the house and we drove back to my sister Ellie’s. It was a long, tense ride. We swerved through fog so thick I could taste it as it threatened to swallow us. I was in despair that we hadn’t gotten my wife out, and I think the others were shell shocked by the horror they’d experienced when we confronted Shadow. 

“I’ve never met such a malignant evil,” Hawthorne said. 

“Never. He made us into puppets. Playthings. What the hell? Seriously, what the hell was that?” Taryn said, guiding us between the yellow lines of highway. 

“I think we can rule out demon,” Hawthorne said. “No sulfer smell, no response to any of the tools we brought, completely able to take over bodies it wasn’t inhabiting. I have no idea. He doesn’t seem like a ghost, or any purely physical being either.”

We arrived back at Ellie’s and debriefed her. My son slept through the meeting and when I checked on him later he was still so peacefully asleep. A faint calm of vanilla hung in the room. Whatever I did, I couldn’t let Shadow get ahold of him. 

“I’m not going back in there,” Hawthorne said as they left. “I’m sorry to say that this situation is WAY over my head. Wish we could do more to help, but I don’t think I’d survive my next encounter with that entity.” 

“I gotta agree, much as I hate to say it. If that glass in my hand didn’t shatter we wouldn’t have made it out. I know when I’m beat,” Taryn said, examining the cuts on her hand. 

I thanked them for putting their lives on the line for me and asked them to let me know if their research hit on anything. 

“There’s one thing I noticed,” Hawthorne said. “The entity had a more difficult time controlling you than the others. That must have something to do with your connection and why it’s targeting you. If there’s a way to get through this, I think you’re the only one who is going to be able to do it.”

They disappeared into the night mist with the faint hum of an automotive engine starting and the crackling of tires leaving the gravel driveway. 

I spent the next few days getting my affairs in order. Truthfully, I didn’t expect to make it out of that house when I went to confront Shadow again. If I didn’t come back, Ellie was to take my son and go somewhere that Shadow couldn’t find him. That was the main part, I had to protect my son. 

THERE’S AN ENDLESS PIT RIMMED WITH HUMAN TEETH THERE’S A DEEP PIT HELP I CAN’T STAY HERE HE HAS ME HE HAS MY BODY MY SOUL SOMEONE PLEASE GET ME OUT OF HERE THERE’S A DEEP PIT FULL OF GNASHING GNASHING GNASHING THERE’S NOTHING AT THE BOTTOM GET OUT GET AWAY DON’T LET HIM IN DON’T LET HIM HAVE ME HELP

My wife was trapped with him. I needed to get her out, and my mother too if I could. 

Yesterday, everything was in order. I crawled into my sedan, forced myself into it. It’s hard — I know thirty-seven years is more than some people get, more than most people in the history of the human race have gotten, but it seems such a short time to have lived to now be heading for what I assumed would be my death. 

I forced myself to close the car door, to turn the ignition, to put the vehicle in gear. I had no plan other than to go in there and confront him. 

My mother was in the kitchen, just sitting there with her eyes wide open, not even blinking. She turned toward me and smiled a despicable, tooth-wide, gaping smile, and cocked her neck painfully to its side. I heard a crack. “Welcome home dear. We’ve all been waiting for you. Now just bring Shadow his child and we can be a happy family.”

My lungs felt filled with dread, but I pushed myself onward and up the stairs. 

There, in the room at the top of the stairs, Shadow sat with my wife who stared straight ahead with that same disheartening expression I saw on my mother. 

“No friends now? Did they all abandon you too? You are distinctly unloveable, aren’t you?” My wife spoke, but the sound was deep and rasping. It wasn’t her voice at all. 

“I don’t care what you are. I want you out of this house,” I told the dog. 

He sat there, regal. Other people had always commented on how he was the most beautiful dog they’d ever seen, but I tried to see past that image into how I’d seen him the other day standing over my son. 

“Oh that’s not nice. This is my home now. You don’t want to kick an old dog out into the cold street to whimper and whine in hunger, to shiver in ditches searching for any scrap of food. You’re not that cruel.” Again, it was my wife's body speaking these words. The dog simply sat, staring at me with his dichromatic eyes. 

“You’re not a dog,” I said to it.

“I want your love and adoration. Your devotion. Is that too much to ask? Maybe I should throw your wife down the stairs. Would you love me then? What if I took away the people in your life one by one until I was all that was left. You’d be forced to love me then, wouldn’t you?” 

I tried to see him as he truly was. Behind the mirage of the beautiful dog I made out an animal in the same shape, but covered in decaying skin. I reached for my wife. “We’re going, and I’m taking her somewhere you’ll never find us,” I said. 

She recoiled from my touch. “SAVE ME!” she screamed, even as her body pulled away. 

“That won’t do,” the other voice spoke through her.

"What do you want?" I screamed. 

"Your son." The cruel voice responded.

"You're not getting him," I said. 

"I'll give you a deal then. You were always a smart child. If I have you, I won't need the infant. DON'T DO IT PLEASE HONEY THERE HAS TO BE ANOTHER WAY. I'll let you wife and mother go free, and I won't kill any of your little friends, and all you have to do is give yourself over to me willingly." 

"My wife and mother will be able to go back to their lives? You'll let go of them completely?" I knew I was powerless to stop him. This could be my only way of saving them. 

"I won't need them if I have you."

"And my son?" 

"He was only a replacement. You were always my favorite. Or don't you remember?" 

"I'll do it," I swallowed and felt the lump in my throat. "If you leave the others alone you can have me." 

Shadow walked toward me, rising onto his hind legs. As he approached he no longer looked like a dog, but instead he was a man with a dog's head. His eyes burned, staring into me. He raised up his claw-like hand and put his index finger on the center of my forehead. My head erupted in pain as he pushed that sharp spear through my flesh, then through my skull itself. A wide smile drew across his face. I could feel him inside me, I didn't know how, but as I was frozen he pushed his whole arm into my forehead. I saw, beyond the image he had shown me, that he had stretched himself into something like a narrow hole cut through the air. And this deep pit entered me and I felt filled by its hollowness and its gnashing teeth and its endless grinding bones and its hunger that could never be sated and its hatred of all things living and I collapsed to the ground and lost consciousness. 

"Wake up! Wake up!" My wife was shaking me. 

"What happened?" I asked. 

"I don't know," she said. "It's all over though. I don't know how you did it, but you got him to leave. Shadow is gone." 

**Days passed.**

Life went back to normal. At least, for everyone else it did. 

But since then I have been filled with anger every moment of every day, sitting at the bottom of my gut, burning a hole in me. 

I'll hear a glass being set onto the counter, I'll notice a toy left out on the ground, and it will take everything I have to stifle an eruption. 

*I might have to leave, for their sake.* 

Every time I close my eyes I see a deep black pit rimmed with broken teeth. 

*I black out and lose time.* 

I wake up sometimes, miles from home, with red smears on my hands. 

I know I should be happy that my family is safe, but something in me is broken. Shadow won. Whatever he is, he is inside me, and like it or not he is bending me to his will.
