We fucked like two mad rats in a sock within the confines of the sleeping bag she stole from the Wal-Mart; it was not a good time, but it was something. We jammed our faces into one another, bit, clawed. Making love with Henrietta wasn’t like love at all and it hurt, and it left marks but the warmth of our bodies in the dead of winter kept us alive.

She grabbed my ear like she meant to rip it from my skull and I headbutted her and she gasped, and I gasped and then we were lying there together, sweating and smelling of onions, and the old room around us groaned like it was glad we were done.

I shifted in the sleeping bag—a tight green band of material—and tried to put an arm around her but she shifted from within, ran naked across the bare room and bent to her pile of clothes by the door. She came up, lit a cigarette, and she was cast in a ghostly glow while she leaned against the molding adjacent to the doorway.

“Fucker,” she cupped her free hand to her forehead and rubbed the place directly between her eyebrows with her thumb.

“Fucker? I hardly know her.” I rose up from the sleeping bag, so it shifted to cover only my legs; I sat there on the floor in the black room, watched Henrietta smoke, listened to the old house—beyond that was winter’s night groan. The busted window on the far wall behind me let only a fraction of moonlight in while the trees outside cast spindly shadows.

“Ain’t that the truth,” chuckled Henrietta. She nodded her head against the wall behind her, let go of smoke, brought the cigarette to her lips, and puffed again. “What are you going to do?”

“Huh?” I asked; the cool room forced a shiver from me, and my shoulders danced. “What do you mean? We could get jobs and run away together?” I laughed and knew the answer.

“Hallelujah, I’m a bum,” said Henreitta; she kicked a leg high and tumbled over on her hands and knees and popped directly up, nearer me; cigarette sparks briefly danced. “I’m hungry. You?”

“I don’t know—do you have the cash?”

“Eh,” she shrugged.

Upon dressing, we spoke only in brief smart-assisms; she tugged at my exposed nipple, and I slapped her ass. She handed me the cigarette. The smoke filled my lungs, I closed my eyes, and realized she was right—I was famished.

The house we took refuge in was dilapidated, stripped of copper and any furniture worth taking; the walls were scrawled in graffities by anonymous artists, but in the middle of the night—like it was then—the place felt naked more than that. Like a blackhole. Every movement through the place was amplified by the house’s age and I vaguely recalled how it had sat vacant since the mass grave they exhumed in the forest out back; that was over five years prior. Back when I’d been a respectable member of the community—a technician at the cannery actually—what a life ago that was.

In the dead winter, with the heavy snowfall and the icy ground, it was better to sleep inside; the shelter was gone and there was nowhere to go.

Henrietta, with her willfulness, proposed the old house. It was big and it wasn’t much warmer inside, but I’d go where she went.

Standing in the black hallway of the second-floor landing, illuminated by only the lighter Henrietta held out in front of her, our mouths produced fog-breath. There were no creeps for us to encounter—after all, we were the creeps. We were the poor and rural, the ignorant and the jobless.

In the yard, looking back to the house, standing in the snow, it seemed nearly like a frosted gingerbread house, cut in the black shadows of the forest beyond. We couldn’t eat houses. The hunger grew and I mentioned Taco Bell.

“If you want to walk more than an hour,” said Henrietta, “Too far. I’m hungry now.”

“You do have the cash though, right? I don’t have anything. You took the last five I had for the cigarettes.”

“We won’t go to bed hungry tonight.”

Snow swirls gathered like tornadoes in miniature around our feet in the rush of the wind, and I pulled the throat of my coat closer around me. We took the private drive from the outskirts of town; from the lower elevation of where we stood, the hills looked bleakly dark. Like they might eat us up.

The movements which Henrietta took through the snow-covered ground sent it up like foam confetti—I followed along closely behind her, thought about putting my arm around her but refrained. Her wild hair came off her head like snakes in the gusts that pushed us slanted on the road.

I’d been hungry maybe all my life, but never had it come out like it did on the nights when I was penniless; a spirit or something overtook my body, ached my stomach, made it impossible to sleep. The time that I was as destitute as that was the time that there was a hunger that couldn’t be quelled—no amount of charity could’ve dispelled it, no amount of food or drink or smoke would’ve placated the hunger. No. Everyone had a story; we all did. In the time that the cannery shut down, the tourism dried up; the best job you could hope for was producing effective methamphetamine. There wasn’t a solution in sight; it felt like a personal failure—who knows if it was? Maybe other people were just built better than me? Maybe they just counted their money better. Surely, the measure of a truly moral person was by way of checking their bank account. Of course. Maybe the things which Henrietta said rubbed off on me. Maybe it was a new delusion. Maybe it was reality. All I can be sure of is that I never felt so bitter and cold and hungry as when I was homeless.

The route, a desolate gravel path, twisted through the forest, beyond where yellow police streamer tape remained on the ends of scrawny black twigs which edged either side of the blue-lit path; the road once belonged to a wealthy family and upon walking it then, sliding along the frozen gravel in my sneakers, I vaguely wondered why, with all the money they had, had they not paved it?

We were quiet, save the huff of our breaths, the strike of rocks slipping under our feet as we took the elevation, the laughs whenever we tumbled over and haphazardly grasped after one another in the dark. We ended up with sore knees and shivering words from the cold—our conversations deteriorated into quick and choppy spurts of language: “Watch out!”, “C’mon.”, “Ha, careful.”

When we passed the hill and saw the lights of town, we began the descent; at the corner where the private-drive met a highway, we jogged toward the dull Exxon light high on the end of a pole. Everything was painted in the dark blues and blacks of the night. Then we pushed into the stark whiteness of the store’s fluorescents and Henrietta moved through the aisles like a bandit while I excused myself to the restroom at the rear.

It stank of stale feces, cleaning solutions, and maybe sweat. Tobacco streaks clung to the back wall of the men’s urinal and gave me something to aim at. Upon finishing, I moved to the single mirror and ran the water from the sink and twisted the knob for hot water and ran my chilled hands beneath the rush; I splashed my face, scrubbed the scruff around my neck, and twisted my wetted fingers into my closed eyes. Upon seeing the hand dryer, I sighed and swiped my hands through my hair to dry them. I returned to the mirror, shut off the water, froze to stare at my reflection like it was the first time I’d seen the man there on the other side.

Something was wrong, but not by enough to notice upon first glance; I angled my head over the sink, gripped the basin for support, came directly to the flat surface of the mirror like I intended to press my nose against it, and twisted my expression in different ways to see the man there do the same. I leveled away from the mirror and titled my head.

The man in the mirror relaxed his shoulders while mine tensed. The eyes of the man fell back into his skull to expose nothing but blackness. His mouth opened and a long pale severed finger spilled out from his pursed lips. The object fell from his mouth and an audible sound came when the thing fell into the reflection of the basin.

I flinched, blinked, fervently shook my head.

My reflection remained the same as I was, stiff-looking, and with an expression of fear which startled me further. I shook my head again, danced my shoulders, and puckered my lips to let out a gust of air.

I leveled over to investigate the sink basin; sitting across the pinhole drain was the pale finger, severed at the knuckle where it should’ve met a hand. A long brown nail stood off its end and I lifted the thing pincerlike and held it to the light; it seemed human enough. I rolled my tongue around in my mouth and swallowed and immediately recalled the creature-man I’d come across during that bad trip with green boogers. In my mind, I’d begun to think of him as Fingerman. I recalled the snow-white finger he’d given me, thought often of the trade he wished to conduct. Was this some fourth dimension hopping demon? What a ridiculous thought. A man-thing trading fingers.

Of course, he’d not only been interested in my finger. I briefly brushed the front of my pants with my palm to be certain the dimension hopper had not made off with my manhood. I laughed at myself, caught my reflection in the mirror, laughed at me laughing, and held the finger up to the grim bathroom light, and laughed then at the object itself. I swallowed. Felt mad.

The original finger he’d given me, I’d let Henrietta see; she’d promptly thrown the thing in the trash and said, “It’s probably come from a crime scene somewhere! What the hell do you even want with a finger anyway? You’ve got ten of your own.”

I sat the severed finger on the cusp of the sink basin, held my own attached fingers up to the light, and kept them extended and counted them out carefully. I did, indeed, own ten fingers of my own.

How long ago had it been that Mr. Fingerman visited me? After counting on my fingers again, I surmised it must’ve been a month or more. It was still Autumn when last I’d seen him. Surely, I wouldn’t see him again.

I grabbed the new severed finger and slid the thing into my jacket pocket.

Just then, a series of hard thuds met the bathroom door and I jumped and moved to the braced threshold and placed myself against it like I intended on barring it closed with my body weight.

“Hey!” shouted a voice, “Open up!”

After a few brief moments I whispered to myself, “He’s come to trade!”

More bangs came on the metal door, meaty smacks like with a fist. “Open the goddamn door!” shouted the person on the other side. It was assuredly a human person. Not a nonhuman person.

I unlocked the door, swung the thing inward, and upon pivoting to the side, a red-faced man, perhaps thirty by the brief glimpse I got of him, spilled in through the doorway and slammed into the opposite wall. The man held his shoulder where it met the wall, rubbed the spot, and cussed at me. He’d intended on breaking into the bathroom.

Without waiting to either receive or offer an explanation, I took off through the small gas station, briefly stopped to snatch a Slim Jim, then exploded into the freezing black night, and ran towards the intersection, bolted up the slick elevation of the private-drive; I felt copper in my mouth, and my skin burned from the cold.

Somewhere on the dark path, Henrietta found me, and we took off together like childish incarnate, whooping, hollering, weaving through the long brush which traced the edges of the path.

“You left me!” I shouted through the wind.

“I knew you’d be fine,” said Henrietta, “Besides, I waited for you!”

We shoved each other in the dark till I slid from the ice on the gravel and came to a kneel. She tackled me and I rolled onto my back in the center of the path. She straddled me, cupped my face in her icy hands, kissed me hard so the force from her planted the back of my head to the ground. Upon pulling away from me, her shadow was cut against the night sky the same as the trees and she reached out and flicked me hard enough across the bridge of my nose that my eyes watered.

I toppled her off, clamored to my feet, and ran away while she ran after.

In the quiet house, we took refuge within the room with the sleeping bag, and Henrietta spilled the contents of her own coat. She lifted a box of snack cakes into the light which spilled through the broken window, “Big-Deborah,” she said with a throaty voice. Besides that, she’d thieved three single-serve cereals, two bags of Doritos, and at least a dozen ramen squares.

Upon seeing the single Slim Jim I had, she laughed at me, said I liked a long bit of protein, lit a cigarette, and came fully from her coat—the woman moved to the broken window, peered out into the black forest there. Even more than before, she seemed a will o’ wisp in the dark room, merely illuminated by the cigarette cherry.

I stretched onto the wooden floor on my side like a cat and kicked off my shoes.

Henrietta took to the sleeping bag, ate from her box of snack cakes, and I took up to roost by the broken window, chewing dry Cinamon Toast Crunch. It was pitch black and so silent I experienced several existential moments on the precipice of madness against the dark night; I periodically cast glances to Henrietta where she eventually took to sleep within the green sleeping bag and upon seeing the rise and fall of her shoulders where she slumbered, I looked back to the forest, the spiky pines against the blue cosmos and felt very alone all over again. I sat the cereal aside.

I lit a cigarette by the window, pulled my coat in close around myself, butted my head against the high frame of the aperture. Then it occurred to me—I withdrew the severed finger from my pocket, held it to the moonlight, and revolved it in my hand to examine the exquisite reality of the thing.

While holding the cold dead thing, I cast another glance along the backyard of the great house, saw the tree line, and caught my breath; standing there among the trees was the long pale face of an eyeless creature. It made no noise, merely stared from where it stood, perched against the bark of a pine, mouth agape. It stood so palely in the dark that it seemed to glow, and it refused movement to the point that it was like any other natural fixture of the world.

I swallowed, watched the thing, felt the severed finger against my palm grow sweaty; I shivered.

On the cool winter breeze, I heard it call to me from where it was like with a whisper. “Trade,” it said.

I shook my head.

The thing’s face grew longer, mouth further open like a black vortex. As morbid as the thought was, I briefly knew that if the thing grabbed me, planted its lips on my own, it could suck the life energy directly from my body.

I curled my fist around the severed finger, held it tight, then leveled myself away from the broken window and hurled the thing into the yard somewhere—creaning there on the sill, I scanned the tree line and saw the face was gone.

Shaking my head, I moved to the door of the room which led onto the second-floor landing, locked the knob, and moved naked into the sleeping bag alongside Henrietta.

I slept only in flashes and often, my time on the floor there was spent twisting in a heap, catching half glimpses of the dark room with only partially lucid eyes.

Awakening to a brisk morning in the sleeping bag by myself, I rose up sweating without remembering whatever dreams I had.

Coughing and clogged from the cold weather, I dressed and moved through the great house in the daylight and found Henrietta along the side of the exterior. She fought with a hollow metal drum, partially corroded through the base. “Burn barrel,” she said stiffly, “Help me with it. It’s warped on the bottom.”

I angled for the base while she clamped her fingers around the mouth’s edge and we waddled with the thing, fought with it till we got it up the stairs; then Henrietta walked it into the room we’d made our own and slid the barrel along the floor, creating streaks. Finally, she left it to rest by the broken window.

In helping her with the thing, I’d brought up a coughing fit; the cool weather did nothing but stir up my lungs. I fully cupped my hands around my mouth, hacking like to get rid of some terrible clog.

Something came free from the back of my throat, and I spat on the floor; resting in my cupped hand, caked in my own mucus, was that long severed finger, brown nail and all. I wretched in thinking that’s what tickled my throat.
