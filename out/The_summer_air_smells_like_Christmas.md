This is a 100% true story. I’m looking for some answers here. I am a firm skeptic, I believe in science and logic for everything. So keep that in mind. 

So this happened about 13 hours ago at around 1AM. Me and this girl were driving around in the woods and she mentioned she was native, so I started joking with her about skinwalkers. She kept telling me to not joke about and it wasn’t fake.

Now before this, the closest thing I had to anything “supernatural” happening, was a roll of tape falling off a nail and rolling some stairs, only to find some lights out up there. So I didn’t think anything of it or even that it was real at all.

Anyway, we were driving and we went up this trail (I’ve been up this trail before I brought her, my last time up there was about 2-3 weeks before this, I have a pic of my truck there at the T) and this trail goes about 3-4 miles in before it gets to wild for my truck and T’s off. So we’re driving and she’s talking about how when we get back to town, she has tons of stories but she can’t say right now. 

And i keep joking around turning the lights off, yelling out the window, asking her everything I can about skinwalkers. I don’t even know if the skinwalker thing is related to what I saw, but it’s the only thing that might be logical? I’m grasping for logic here lol

So we get to the top of the road, we turn around at a T in the trail, sit there for about 20 minutes smoking and talking. When we started heading down, I was just cruising. Feet off the pedals. Going about 10-15, just chatting. We almost get back to the beginning of the trail, when we round this corner and I see,
and I’m not joking, I’m getting goosebumps writing this. 

A random, standalone tree with white Christmas lights on it clear as day, not even 15 feet off the trail. Me, being a skeptic, slowed down, and processed it for a second. I didn’t stop because my brain had alarms going off like crazy. I was figuring it was a trap or something. But what blows my mind is the girl didnt see them on our way up and neither did I. On our way back down it was practically lighting up the trail. I instantly got spooked and I just eased onto the gas and drove out of there like nothing happened. Like I didn’t even see it.

What happened? Does anyone have any clue? The road isn’t accessible in the winter, so nobody set it up for Christmas. and the closest property is 4-500 yards uphill through uncleared woods and that isn’t a person’s house, it’s a storage garage. So nobody is running a 500yd extension cord. It’s not a tree hunt or anything. Nothing about it anywhere on Google. Blows my mind.

The whole way back into town, about 45 minutes, I’m just thinking of how these lights are even on, that particular part of the hill has sun for 4 hours at most on the longest day. Solar power? Timer? For who? And why? And why didn’t we notice? Was it off when we first passed? Who put it up? 

If anyone has answers lemme know.
I’m extremely intrigued by supernatural happenings, however, have never experienced anything like this. I want to explore it further, in the safest way possible. Any tips?
