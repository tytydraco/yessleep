I don't know how do I begin, it's a suicide note but the same time it's also my confession. It's been a week now since I've stepped out of my house, it was the night of my birthday. It's not that I don't want to, I'm just afraid to. I wish I could attach some voice notes here as well, so you hear those sounds, of head banging, of muffled screams, of crying. I don't want to get into a great introduction of mine, i mean you'll get a fucking biography about me or maybe even a documentary after they find it was me, so just wait for it. But in short, my name's Peach and I'm a kindergarten teacher at a local school. I haven't been there since the incident happened. Back to the beginning, it was my birthday eve.

After Ethan's working days, i finally met him after months and he himself as a surprise gift came to me so we could finally some quality time together after. The next day it was my birthday, we had a really great party at our home, i invited all my students there. And finally after hours of joy and celebration, everyone left, later me and Ethan cleaned up all the mess and went to our bed to make love and just our stuff yk afterall we met after months. 

In our cozy room, Ethan and I shared an intimate moment with immeasurable closeness, the viagra pills he took made him want to do all the bad things to me, swear I saw it in his eyes, we were lost in each other when suddenly we heard a bang from our wardrobe, right next to our bed. Out of nowhere, three students of mine jumped out of it, and it was the most panic inducing moment I'd everrrr experienced. They looked at us while me and Ethan were in that state for a  few seconds and immediately ran away locking the door from outside.

Ethan instantly fell on me and went unresponsive to my shakes and pulls. I couldn't think of anything else and just got up naked, to chase the kids, but since they locked the door from outside all I did was screaming for them, desperately trying to get them to open it. The phone was outside, I asked them kids to call the emergency but they just laughed outside and thought it was all fun and games. But after about few minutes i realised Ethan wasn't breathing, he was still, now deep down I knew he was dead but I wasnt ready to accept that. Maybe it was the heart attack those kids caused him.

I was crying at the top of my lungs, broken, sitting next to the corpse of my husband, banging on the door asking those pawns of devil to fucking open the door. Finally, they agreed to opened it. Just bc they wanted me to let them out of the house because I had locked the main door, and they couldn't find the keys. I told them to wait and reassured them everything was alright and I was crying because I stubbed my toe on the table. Little did they know what was going through my mind. I told them if they let me out I'll open the main door, and as they opened i immediately i gripped them hard with their  hair, and threw two in my room and banged the head of one and kicked him in with the others and locked the doors from inside.

Im never this harsh, but i was drunk a little that night, I mean a little too much. I was out of my mind now, imagine losing your husband on the night of your birthday, and won't be able to call for help because of some kids thinking it all to be game. It sucks, right? 

And right before the kids started to cry, i taped their mouth shut, they tried to fight me but how hard it'd be to overpower some 8 year olds. I tied their hands together and feets too. I was still naked, like how ethan left me, I was thinking what to do them next, i could've simply called the police and doctors, and let these kids in their hands but no, I wanted them to go through the worst for what they did to me, i swear this wasn't me right now, not their usual kindergarten teacher.

Those mfs just kept screaming for help, but the tape muffled all of it, what a great invention it is. I stayed still for few hours, those kids looked exhausted too, even a blind would see the fear in their eyes. 

It was 3AM, i opened the tapes from their mouth and fed them some sleeping pills, and hid them inside one of my room, far from the reach of anyone to come searching for them. Then returned back to my room, everytime i looked at Ethan i burst into tears, i wished it was me, i hugged him and cried for an hour more, went through every memory of us together and wished hell for those mfs who did this to him. 

Next morning as expected the parents came looking for them, but it was easy to tell them they weren't here, afterall i was their teacher. I came back in and got drunk again, i dont know why but it just felt right to me, to numb and deviate myself from the shock that, later went back to the kids they were still asleep. I opened them and tied them back to a wooden cross taped their hands and feets tight,fixed them vertically to the ground in a semi circle. And thought of injecting some bleach to their neck to shup them up for longer and without having to find the fucking end of the duct tape, i mean when you're drunk its hard to find the end spot of the tape so you can begin peeling it yk. so i got up and brought a syringe filled with bleach, as i entered the trails of bleach followed me all the way in but just as i reached the first kid, Aron, i stopped idk why i did but i just stopped. His eyes widened and the screams burned my ears but i just didn't do that bleach thing.

I just sat infront of them, more specifically i sat near the naked corpse of Ethan that i laid in front of them and started emptying the bottles from the closet, that we, me and Ethan brought together,and heard their prayers, beggings and all that shit they were crying, screaming and saying to me. I can't describe in words, idek. Later i don't know when i fell asleep, but just as i woke up the kids seemed so weak, being their kindergarten teacher i fed them some leftover and slept again.

Its day 7th i guess, 7:32AM and Ethan's corpse started to smell way worse than before, bad enough that a kid vomitted on the legs of Ethan. And yeah, its 7 days now and they're still tied to the same cross same spot in same position haha. I know Aron didn't do this intentionally but still i didn't like it. And the other two ralph and riley, oh poor them, they died, slept or passed out i guess. I didn't even care enough to check on them. I just left out to bring some tape again to not have to see the mfs vomit on my husband's leg again. While i was returning back to them i looked at myself in the mirror, half-dead face, chapped and cracked lips and oh my hair, more curly, messed and dirty than the one on my private area, cherry on the top they're greasy as fuck now. After i was done taping their mouth shut i just looked at those puked out residue of the leftover food in that vomit on the legs of my hubby. I wanted to punish them real good so i just brought the heaviest nails i could get in my house and started to nail their palms to the wooden cross, right in the centre. They must be screaming the top of their lungs but all i heard was "mmmm mmmm" hahaha..i literally laughed out loud while doing all this even though my weary eyes wanted to shed tears. Blood covered the cross, the ground and the hammer i was hammering their hands with. I went for their feet too but the nails weren't long enough to pass their both feets and then the wood, so i left them only with the hands. Oh poor them, crying and must be cursing me too, worst they can curse me is either pig or a trash can haha, that's all these kids can say. Instead they should thank God for saving their feets lol.

It's 9:11 PM, and realizing what I did, I just sat numb in my room, silent, but hearing the crying of two kids from downstairs. Just two, because I guess Riley died, and if not, she passed out for a while. I don't know what to do now; my hands are blistered from digging a grave for my husband in the backyard. It's hurting. And yeah, even today, their parents along with an officer came to check my house and ask me stuff, but I had my main door locked from outside since the last few days, so they had to leave because until now, I made them not suspect me somehow.

But now I just can't deal anymore. I tried dragging my husband to the backyard, but no luck. My hands are hurting, all bloody from popping blisters, my ears can't bear those cries anymore. I just want it all to stop. Not gonna give up 'cause I don't wanna spend the rest of my life in a prison cell in a deep isolation. And heck no to getting publicly beat by their parents and everyone else on the hunt. Even my neighbors are now curious about those missing kids. Seriously, I'm done now, from crying, from those kids, from the corpse, from my thoughts and this blood and gore i do everyday. My brain's messed up from all this darkness. Home feels like a haunted place now, I wanna get over it. Writing this while I'm sitting on the chair  under the noose I set up in front of Aron, Ralph, and Riley. After i finish writing all this I'll just hang myself right here. After they're found I hope their nails will be removed with care and they're set free to their parents, if they're still alive, and please bury me on the left side of aron, just next to him. Because that's how we slept when he was alive, i was always on the left and he's on the right haha, just some past stuff yk.

And by the time you read this I'll be dead.
