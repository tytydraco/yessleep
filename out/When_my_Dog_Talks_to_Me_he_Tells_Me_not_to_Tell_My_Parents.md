I think Max ate my rabbit.

Yesterday morning, the cage was empty. Dad said Carrot must have dug a hole to escape, but I know that’s not true. When I came into the living room, Max was chewing on something. It smelled weird, like hot metal. There were white hairs stuck between his teeth. Carrot’s fur.

When I tried to pull it out of his mouth, he growled. Not like usual, not like a dog. It was a deep, strange sound, like a machine jamming. And he looked at me with a bizarre expression, a kind of almost human smile. Max never smiles.

Last night, he started doing really weird things. I couldn’t sleep. I heard Max walking up and down the hallway, his claws softly scraping the floor. Normally, he sleeps in the living room, but this time, I don’t know why, he was there, pacing in the hallway. He stopped in front of my door.

And I think he said:  
"Clara."

It was just one word. That’s all. But his voice, it wasn’t normal. It sounded like he was trying to talk without really knowing how. Like he was imitating someone. The syllables came out slowly, interrupted by wet, sloshing sounds.

I pulled my blanket over my head, hoping he would go away and that I was just having a bad, overly vivid dream. But he kept going:  
"Clara… I… hungry."

My heart was pounding so hard I could barely breathe. I heard the doorknob turn, softly.  
"Clara… open."

He didn’t push it. After a moment, his claws moved away down the hallway. I stayed frozen until the sun came up.

This morning, I tried to tell Mom, but Max was right next to her, sitting at her feet. He wasn’t doing anything, but he was staring at me, like he was listening to every word I said. When I started to speak, he slowly opened his mouth, just enough to show his teeth.

I didn’t continue.

Mom didn’t notice anything. She just laughed, half-annoyed, half-teasing, saying I looked tired.

Max kept staring at me, even when I went upstairs to my room.

That night, he came back. This time, he opened the door. I don’t know how he did it, but he managed, and when I woke up, he was sitting at the foot of my bed. I could hear him breathing. It wheezed, like something was stuck in his throat.

"Clara… friend…"

His voice was worse than before. Every word was broken, like he was ripping the sounds out of his mouth.

"Friend… you… Max… hungry."

I pressed myself against the wall at the head of my bed, trembling. He stood up slowly, his claws snagging my sheets as he moved. When he brought his head close to mine, his breath smelled awful.

"Clara… you… quiet."

He tilted his head, and I saw his tongue slide over his teeth. His jaw moved awkwardly, like he was trying to smile again.

"Or… them… pain."

This morning, Dad wasn’t here. His car is still in the driveway, but I can’t find him anywhere. When I asked Mom, she said he probably went for a run. But why are his shoes still by the door ?

Max, meanwhile, is in the living room. He’s chewing on something. When I get closer, he turns toward me and drops what he was holding.

It’s a watch. Dad’s watch.

His lips are red.

I ran to my room to write all this down. I don’t know what to do. Max has been scratching at my door for ten minutes. He’s not talking this time, but I can hear him breathing. It’s worse than his voice.

If someone finds this note, just know one thing : **dogs don’t talk. If yours starts to, run**.
