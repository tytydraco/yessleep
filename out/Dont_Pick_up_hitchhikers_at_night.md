It was already a long night. 

I was driving down a straight stretch of road going back home after a long night shift at work. One of the reasons why i like night shift is the eerie calm driving by yourself with no cars passing by you. 

As I went to turn right on the upcoming crossway my headlights caught something. I stopped my car and looked out my window. He was maybe in his 40's, wearing baggy jeans and what looks like a green army coat. He had a bit of a besrd growing on his chin. 

"Hey! Need a ride?!" I yelled at him. 

He turned his head toward my car and smiled. Like it was the nicest thing someone offered him all day. He went around to the passenger side and got in. 

I didn't notice anything creepy about the guy. I mean you hear horror stories about people picking up insane asylum paitents or serial killers but this guy had that fatherly feel about him. 

"Thanks. It was getting chilly out there". He said as he smiles at me and holds out his hand. 

"Greg Stone at your service". 

I smiled back and shook Greg's hand. "John Warner". Greg let's go of my hand and looks out the driver window. "Nice to meet you John. Do you mind if I ask you too take me somewhere?" 

I guess he forgot that wouldb e the reason why i let him in. "Sure where you heading"? 

He coughed and then said,"A couple more miles down the road." I thought that seemed fair enough since my house was in that general direction. As we were driving Greg made small talk. I learned how he was a businessman who got down on his luck and turned homeless. He had no good relationship with his family so they didn't help him out. 

"That's why i always say to people to keep family members close", he says as he sighs. "We're here". I stop the car and look at the house we stopped at. It looked like just your normal two story house except with the gnomes and flowers in th front yard. 

"You mind waiting on me for a second?" Greg asked. "Um this isn't no drug dealers house is it?" I asked because why would a homeless guy be wanting in someone's house. He looked at me with a shocked face then laughed. 

"No no! That's funny! This is just an old friend of mine's place. Just wanted to see how he is doing. This will only take a couple minutes promise". 

With that he went out of the car and up towards the driveway. I watched him knock on the door several times until it opened. I couldn't see who opened it but Greg went inside none the less. 

As i waited I noticed the lights that were on in the house flashing on and off several times. Then all at once the lights turned off. Greg opened the front door and shut it then headed straight to my car. 

As he got in I asked,"so what happened?" Greg turned with a serious face and said,"that's personal nothing else". I just shut my mouth and started up the road. "Mind if I ask you too take me back to where you found me?" 

I was going to glady because Greg was already starting to creep me the hell out. I didn't say it too him so i just drove along to end us on friendly terms. 

As we go back to the crossroad Greg starts to get out of the vehicle. As he gets out he shuts the door then looks at me through the open passenger window. "Since you were nice to me John I'll let you ask me one question". 

One Question? I thought in my head confused by what he meant. Only one thing that bothered me was what happened at that person's house with the lights. 

"What happened up there at that house?" I asked him. 

He sighed as if i asked him something he didn't want to say. "That person you dropped me off at made a deal with me. He broke that deal so i took care of him". Took care of him! "So…so you killed him?" I asked trying to stay calm. 

"Yes". Suddenly it seemed as if his whole entire body was shaking. Suddenly i was seeing a mix of "Greg" and a horrifying creature with horns all around it's body. 

"What…what are you?!" 

"I'm something not from this material plane John. Now that you've seen my form you made a deal with me yourself. The next time someone picks me up I'll be coming for you like you did to that other." 

My hearr was beating really fast. Sweat was pouring down my eyebrows. 

"I can't wait till we meet again". Suddenly the creature was just gone! I quickly sped out of their as fast as I could. 

So now I'm here to ask for your help on how to deal with this creature. And if you can please don't pick up any hitchhikers if you value my life!
