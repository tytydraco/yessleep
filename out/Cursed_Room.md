I picked up this voice recording by an abandoned building I wanted to investigate. I thought it would be a boring old recording, but it turns out that I was wrong. This is what the voice recording had to offer. 

What you are hearing right now is a of what happened in the last moments of my life. My name is Ashley, I'm 13 years old. Even I have no idea if I am alive or not. 

It all started on a normal day when my family decided to go on a festival. I was an only child and hated going outside. I would only go outside for school, and to hang out with my friends. This festival was a dump. I complained to my parents that we shouldn't go since there was no point. I asked them why we were going there while on the car. My mom turns her head around and I was horrified with what I saw. Her eyes were pitch black and her mouth seemed like it was decaying. All she said was "Honey....... If we Dont go here he will get angry". She turns her head around while I'm sweating because of fear in the back of the car. 

When we arrived at the festival, her face was normal again. I thought that I was just being crazy and ignored it. I saw a poster and apparently this festival was named "The Broken World". What a weird name I tell myself. 

The festival actually seemed fun, but for me it was just lame people talking to other lame people. Before the festival ended I go to the toilet to pee when I heard screaming outside. I hurry to get outside as fast as possible then the lights were all closed. The moon wasn't even there anymore. I couldn't see anybody. Everyone was gone. 

My phone came in handy since I used it as a 8 flashlight. I looked around and I noticed that I was inside some kind of room the walls were all black. I begin to panic as I see dead bodies at the corner. 

I hear lightning strike and I was back at the festival. My face was so sweaty that my mom began to worry if I was feeling ok. They decided to go home and when we were driving, I fell asleep. 

When I woke up I was in the same room as before. I tried finding a way out this time, but there was no use. I hear a girl crying somewhere in the room. It turns to laughing at some points and I don't know what to do anymore. 

At about 1 hour ago a man with knives stuck to his bleeding and torn face showed up. He stayed in the corner, his mouth was smiling. My phone died and I can't see anymore. I find a tape recorder which is what I'm using right now. After 10 minutes in the darkness, I began to hear slow footsteps with humming. OH MY HELP M-
