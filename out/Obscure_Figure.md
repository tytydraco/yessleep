Do I believe what I have seen or it's just a dream?

When I was around 7 or 8, I had a childhood best friend called "Lin". As usual, at around 4:00 p.m., I was waiting for her to come by my house since we're neighbors anyway, and it was basically the only way for me to get out of the house. That was our routine almost every day, she would call me from outside, and I’d rush out immediately. So when I heard her calling my name that day, I didn’t think anything unusual was going on. But I didn’t expect her to say what she said next.

"Ly, lyy! I'm home alone and there's a lady inside my house! Come look!"
Her voice didn’t sound like she was joking or trying to scare me. She sounded genuinely shaken. Obviously, I was curious, but I was also confused because she never mentioned any topic like that. So I went to check it out, but slowly. I didn’t want to run into something unexpected, so I stayed low, kind of crouched, since I didn’t want to get noticed by this "lady" she was talking about.

From my POV, all you can see from their door is a table blocking part of the view. I was trying to peek without being seen. Then I saw her, this lady, walking towards us very calmly. She didn’t run, she didn’t rush, she didn’t even look around. She just walked like she already knew we were there. Seconds that feel like forever. She was wearing a bluish-white dress, the exact same color as her legs, which was weird and honestly kind of unsettling. The color was so bright and so clean that it didn’t look normal. Even at my age back then, something in me felt off about her appearance.

As she kept getting closer, my best friend suddenly shouted behind my back, "Let’s go, she’s coming towards us!" I turned around quickly because I could feel my whole body freezing up. I haven’t even gotten the chance to see her face, even though I wanted to, just to confirm if she was someone familiar or not. But deep down, I was also scared to death. Something in me told me that looking any longer was a bad idea, so I ran as fast as I could.

We both sprinted away from her house like our lives depended on it. I remember my heart beating so fast that I could hear it in my ears. The whole time I was running, I kept thinking, How did she even got inside because they have dogs that bark to any stranger that comes in and the doors are locked except that door where we peeked? What if what I have seen was real? And even though I didn’t look back, I could still imagine the sound of her slow steps coming closer. That feeling stuck with me for so long that even now, sometimes I wonder if what I saw was real or if my memory twisted it into something else. But every time I think about it, the fear feels too real to be just a dream.
