My mother has always been a strange woman. Was, I mean.   
  
I never knew her long. She died just a 14 years or so after I was born. I couldn't tell you why. Must've been something or other related to drugs, crime or the marriage of both. What I do know is that she kept strange company and was even stranger herself. I've obviously seen her, but I can't recall what she looked like. I've heard her speak, but I can't remember what she sounded like. It's as if the ghost of her past has gone and wiped my memories of her existential evidence.   
  
Her company, however... I can remember them. Sometimes a big, burly man with scars painted all across his body. Other times, a warm, beaming smile with a mind just as bright; one who could lecture me even on topics I thought I was knowledgeable in. There was even one fellow with a dangerous glint in his eye; like the sheen of a knife rife with intention. I never much interacted with them, what with me being more interested in my books and playing cards than any of my mother's companions. But they all gave me the feeling of being similar; perhaps not in appearance, but certainly of mind.  
  
I guess it just strikes me as strange. How some folk you meet resound with aspects and traits not quite unique to them, but unique in their representation. How one man can lift weights because he wants to be healthy, while another lifts them because he wants to the strongest in the gym. Motivations each to their own, but to each of them indeed.  
  
Myself, I'm somewhat of a sneak. I've never liked social gatherings or small talk or sharing how my day has been. I prefer to stay in my lane and out of the limelight. I suppose that lends credence to my day job: I'm a security analyst specializing is physical access. Breaking into buildings, picking locks, that kind of thing. My entry into places unwelcome to me has always brought a fire to my belly; a fire that traces its kindling to my early years.   
  
I was maybe 9 or 10, up late on a night I had no right to be. That alone always brought some excitement, much to my family's disapproval, but that night it wasn't enough. I had snuck out of the house after everyone else had gone to bed, armed with a set of lockpicks my friend's brother bought for me. I locked the back door before I crept through the front one, closing it behind me.  
  
I was greeted by our front yard, its life sapped by the night. There was a coldness to the air â€” not because of the weather, but by a sort of abscence of it. The atmosphere of the dark unsettled me, but I kept my young pace towards the back.  
  
Reaching the back door, I was returned to comfort. I still had an odd feeling, but that belly fire kicked up and warmed me rightly. I set my pick to the lock and, in less than a minute, it was open. I was disappointed more than anything else. I wanted to learn, but weak locks brought nothing but stagnation. I craved a lock unfamiliar to me; one that I knew would be a challenge.  
  
My school came to mind. It was only a few blocks away. I could walk there, crack the lock, and be back before an hour passed. A good plan, at least to the tracks of my young mind. I snuck back around the house and made my way without spying another soul on the walk. Not that I minded.  
  
The school looked strange in the blanket of night. Familiar but not; the same place I went to daily, but not. But I didn't care much, nor did my lockpick. I set upon the front door with a hunger in my hands that demanded to be sated. The lock fell to my fingers in just two minutes time. Better than at home, but nowhere near ideal. As I turned to walk off, the door behind me lurched open and I was dragged into the building.  
  
My heart nearly exploded out of my chest, but I was faced with none other than the school's janitor. Apparently he was working late that night and was just preparing to clock out. He was shouting about me being a delinquent and a pest with other colorful words sprinkled throughout. I was brought to a chair where I sat with shame, not because of my actions, but because I let myself be caught. I had to get better at not being caught.  
  
The interaction ended with him demanding my name and grade, which I shared. I just wanted to get home and sleep my disappointment away. It didn't end there, however. The next day, the principal called me to his office early in the morning with a sharpness to his voice that nobody ever liked. He was calling my mother and urging her to meet with him alongside her devious child to discuss my "attempt at burglary."  
  
I hoped she wouldn't come. She did. We sat in that office as they shouted back and forth about my imminent expulsion and a report to the police. A fist hit the desk hard before my mother asked me to leave the room. I quietly left and took a seat just outside, in a quaint little chair that smelled of cleaning solution.  
  
A few minutes later, my mom rushed out of the room and took my hand with her eyes directed at the door. I gazed into the office only to find the principal limp and leaning back in his chair, with a strand of drool leaking from his lips. His gaze was turned towards the ceiling, mouth muttering with the speed of a hummingbird's wings, fluttering its nothingness to the apathetic quiet.  
  
He was replaced soon after. They say he suffered some kind of mental break and was deemed completely unfit for work. That's what they claim, at least. I don't know if anyone saw us enter or leave that day, but we were never questioned or brought forward. The problem just faded away into the recesses of the town's mind. I've always been curious about it, but I'm not stupid enough to ask. My mom did something to help me and I suppose I'm thankful.  
  
I guess I loved her, even if it seems I never knew her.
