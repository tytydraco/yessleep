The lights go out.

My computer monitor turns off with the lights, leaving me in darkness.

I take a moment to process what just happened. I was working on an Excel spreadsheet for the corporate job I work remotely, and I can't remember when I last saved. Thirty minutes ago?

*Fuck.*

I bottle up my anger and start making my way to the fuse box, which quickly proves to be difficult considering that it's downstairs in the darkness and I am upstairs in the darkness. I've barely escaped my room before I start to appreciate how hard it must be to live with blindness. I start fumbling my way down the stairs.

I'm halfway down the stairs when I abruptly stop and my blood runs cold. I've just remembered something.

It's daytime.

*It's daytime.*

I barely had lunch an hour ago. My house has plenty of windows, and none of them are covered.

Trying not to panic, I quickly stumble down the stairs. I stop being methodical and walk blindly in the general direction of where I remember the fuse box being. I nearly trip over a chair before I reach a wall. I start running my hands across it and finally find the fuse box.

I tear open the fuse box and sightlessly start flipping switches, praying. *Please let this be a simple power outage.* I'm just starting to fully panic when I successfully flip the main breaker.

The lights go on.

I breathe a sigh of relief. I check to make sure the water is still running, which it is, and make my way over to the window to check outside.

I can see the ground and the edge of the forest around my house, lit by the light from the windows. Everything else is pitch black.

This is not simply the dark of night. This is unnatural. I can see nothing out there. No moon, no stars, no distant lights of the city.

My phone service is dead, along with the internet. I turn on all of the lights in my house and grab a flashlight to go outside. My house is now a beacon of light, and I feel slightly more secure as I step onto the porch.

Walking around my house with the flashlight on, I direct the beam of light across the trees and start calling out, asking if anyone is there. No one answers, which is unsurprising given that I live thirty miles away from the city.

As I walk, I suddenly realize that I'm becoming afraid. I'm not afraid of the dark, so I can't understand why I'm feeling this way. My fear is getting worse the longer I stay outside.

Unnerved, I go back inside. I have few options left, so I'm just going to wait this out. Whatever "this" even is. Hopefully it's over soon.

One week later, and I'm forced to admit that this is not a situation that will end soon. I've tried to tune the radio in my car to find an emergency broadcast, but there's nothing but dead air.

Speaking of dead air, I started to notice recently that the sounds of the forest have stopped. The air is still and no animals can be heard. Even the insects seem to be gone. I've been distracting myself from this disturbing silence by playing music from my phone or games on my TV.

I have enough food to last another month, but I need to start planning a trip to the city. An old backpack I used in college is stuffed with toiletries and random things I might need. I roll up a few old blankets in case I need to sleep in my car and finish up by putting my flashlight down next to the backpack.

I stand outside my front door and look out into the darkness. Not today.

If "today" even means anything now.

---

Two weeks later, I'm jolted awake by a loud crash outside. *What the fuck was that?* Adrenaline is suddenly coursing through my body and I'm not sure what I should do.

A minute passes and I start to calm down. I creep over to the window and try to figure out what the noise was.

It was just a tree that had fallen over. I let out a breath and turn away, trying and failing to fall back asleep.

Over the next few days I think about the tree.

*Are the trees dying without the light? Or was it something else? A coincidence maybe?*

I'll go to the city soon. Not today.

---

The lights go out.

Three weeks in and I'm trying to enjoy a sad mixture of water and cereal when I'm once again enveloped in complete darkness.

My heart is pounding as I use my outstretched hands to make my way to the fuse box. I try flipping the main breaker, and every other switch, but nothing happens.

I know what this probably means and try the faucet in my sink, praying I'm wrong. My fears are confirmed when no water comes out.

I light a few spare candles I had recently prepared in case this happened and think about my next steps.

The utilities have shut off.

I have to go to the city.

I look outside.

---

Four weeks, an entire month, and I finally run out of the water I managed to save. I've been delaying too long and going to the city is now mandatory for my continued survival.

Everything but my water bottle and flashlight are in the car already, so I turn on my flashlight and blow out the candles I was using to illuminate the rooms with. I quickly get into my car and start the engine.

Turning on my headlights reveals the small unpaved road leading away from my house into the trees. Leaves and branches are everywhere. I can see far enough ahead that I can drive safely as long as I go slow.

---

Unnatural fear is creeping in as I drive through the utterly dark forest.

Several switchbacks later, I reach the main highway leading to the city. All four lanes are empty and covered with leaves and branches. It's likely that no one has gone through here since this started.

*Am I alone?*

*Is this what I'm afraid of?*

---

One of my tires blows out.

It's so loud and startling in the otherwise complete silence that I veer off the road. I frantically try to regain control of the vehicle but it's too late. The car plunges into a ditch and I'm thrown against the wheel.

I hang forward in my seat, suspended by my seatbelt, until I come to my senses. *NO! FUCK!* This is the worst possible thing that could have happened. I groan and pull myself from the car to check the damage.

My car is halfway into the ditch, completely stuck.

It's still around twenty miles to the city, and now I have to walk.

I kick a branch. I kick the car. I kick the car a few more times. I scream into the dark, both at myself and at this living hell I've been cursed to exist in.

For around an hour I sit against the car, collecting myself. *This isn't the end of the world.*

I pause in my thoughts.

*Hopefully.*

It's somehow easier to think when you're surrounded by a complete void.

*Once I get to the city I'll find water and possibly, hopefully, other people. I probably won't be able to get back now, so I'll just find a new place to stay.*

*I can make this trip in one day. It will suck, but it will be over soon enough. Just need to get it done.*

*Time to get up and make it happen.*

I grab my backpack, my water bottle, and my flashlight. These are the only things I can reasonably take with me.

I'm angry at myself. I should have known these branches could pop a tire. I could have put on the spare. Hell, I could have driven on the bare wheels if I had to.

I start walking.

---

My anger and regret quickly fade away as the fear begins to creep in once again.

The fear is far more noticeable now. After an hour of walking, the insidious dread has far surpassed what it was like outside my house.

It's getting hard to think.

---

Four hours of walking.

My flashlight darts from tree to tree. I'm trying desperately to contain my paranoia.

I have to make it to the city.

I need a place to hide.

---

I've been walking for half a day.

My fear is physical now. I'm trembling uncontrollably and my nerves are fried. It's more exhausting than the walking itself. I'm trying to think about something, anything to get through this.

*Think about what it was like to not be afraid. Focus on that. This will all be a bad memory soon.*

I stopped looking around everywhere with my flashlight; it's now shining at the ground directly in front of me as I focus on moving my feet. I'll be at the city soon.

*Keep moving. Step over that branch. It's not real fear.*

My energy is running out and I'll have to rest soon. I'll drink some water, possibly eat one of the last-

At the edge of the small pool of light in front of me, I catch a glimpse of something.

I stop moving.

My flashlight is starting to die. I raise it up.

I look.

Terror.

An earsplitting noise breaks the silence.

Terror.

I realize the noise is me. I'm screaming.

Terror.

My flashlight dies. I can't stop screaming.

The lights go out.
