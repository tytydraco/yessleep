am so tired and english is not my native language so please excuse possible grammar errors and stuff like that. I hope that someone can explain to me if they know anything about my current situation. 

It all started a years ago when I moved out of my parent's house after months and months of saving money I could rent a room with 2 other people around my age (21).

The first few weeks were fine, I did all my chores and talked to my family almost every day, though every day I was getting more and more tired looking. It got to the point I was actually sent to the hospital after suddenly falling asleep while I was driving and crashed in a headlight. Even at the hospital every time I fell asleep (or tried to) somehow I always woke up more tired than before. 

I tried everything: changing matresses, rooms, moving out to my current apartment, taking pills, hell I even have changed the whole bed and nothing. It has been afecting my mood and having really bad effects on my relationships with friends and fsmily. Nothing seems to work and I'm desperate, maybe that's why I am asking here you might think and you're not entirely wrong. 

I am desperate but that's not why I write this here. 

It was 3 nights ago, I woke up in the middle of the night, struggled to get out of bed and went for some water. When I got back to bed and started to close my eyes I heard something really weird, like little taps, like a mouse running but bigger. Despite being as tired as I am, I couldn't just let a mouse run freely in my room. When I opened my eyes though, there were other eyes in front of me, not two, not three, there were at least 9 eyes directly staring at me. 

They were attached to what I can only describe as a blob of flesh barely resembling a humanoid shape; and the smell, god that smell. It smelled like dog food and shit. I froze, and I don't know what to interpret of that "face" it had but it had a glance I'm pretty familiar with: it was tired, like it spent hundreds of days without rest. I know that look all too well because that's what I had looked every morning in my mirror since last year.

Edit: I know it started when I moved out because that's when I begun to notice how tired I actually felt every day.  I have also considered the fact that it may have been sleep paralysis, but I understand that it happens when you wake up, not when you're about to go to sleep. Please help I don't know what to do or who to tell about this. Has anyone ever faced something like this?? Could that thing be the reason I just can't rest?? I have many questions and absolutely no answers so any help might be useful.
