I never believed in anything supernatural. My life was ordinary, predictable, safe. That all changed one night at exactly 2:47 a.m.

I was lying awake in bed, scrolling through my phone, when I felt it vibrate. A message appeared on my screen.

“Don’t open the door. No matter what you hear.”

I froze. At first, I laughed. It had to be a prank. But then I noticed the sender—it was my own number. My own number, sending a message to me.

I checked my sent messages. Nothing. No drafts. No scheduled texts. Nothing. 

Then came a soft knock on the door.

*Knock. Knock.*

I didn’t move. The knocking continued, gentle, deliberate. My heart was pounding, my hands shaking.

Another message appeared.

“It’s standing right outside.”

I backed away slowly, my mind racing. Through the peephole, I saw nothing. The hallway was empty. I tried to convince myself it was my imagination, some coincidence, but my phone vibrated again.

“I told you not to open it.”

The knocking grew louder. Heavy now. Almost impatient. And then I heard it—a voice. My voice. Only it wasn’t coming from inside me. It was coming from outside, from the other side of the door.

“Open the door. Please,” it said, trembling. “You’re scaring me.”

I stumbled backward. How could that be my voice, begging, terrified, outside my locked door?

Another message: 

“If you open it, it will take your place.”

I pressed myself against the wall, too scared to move. Minutes passed—or maybe hours. The knocking stopped. The voice faded. Silence filled the apartment. My phone buzzed one last time.

“You survived tonight.”

I thought it was over. I tried to sleep, but I couldn’t. Every noise, every creak of the building made me jump. Every vibration of my phone felt like a warning.  

The next night, at exactly 2:47 a.m., my phone buzzed again.

“It’s learning,” it said.

I stayed in bed, paralyzed. Then the knocking started again. This time it wasn’t gentle. It was desperate. I could hear breathing. Heavy, wet, wrong. And then, once more, that voice—my voice—cried for help. Terrified, real, pleading.

Another message came in.

“It copies whoever listens.”

My hands were shaking as I stared at the phone. The shadow outside the door moved. Or maybe it had been standing still all along. My memories, my fears, my life—it knew them. 

It wasn’t trying to break in. It was trying to convince me, to replace me. My phone vibrated one last time.

“There is only one way to stop it.”

I stared at the message, frozen.

“Open the door during daylight.”

The next morning, sunlight poured into the hallway as I stood trembling in front of the door. My hands shook as I unlocked it. Nothing. Empty hallway. But across from me, in the mirror, someone was smiling. Someone who looked exactly like me.

I didn’t smile back.

And then my phone buzzed in my pocket.

“Thank you for letting me out.”

That’s when I realized I had never been texting myself. It had been trying to warn me.
