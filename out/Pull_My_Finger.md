“Go on, pull it!” 

I looked up from my the book I was reading, to see a middle aged, fat man with goatee. He had his finger close to me and a huge smile on his face.

“Come on!!!! Pull it!” 

He was wearing a washed up grey hoodie with the hood covering his baldness. He had sweat pants on and crocs. Rain was trickling on the ground.

“Come on, man! Just pull it! I need someone to pull my finger!” 

I knew what he was gonna do. He was gonna fart. He probably had someone with a camera off in the distance to make some funny videos. Today wasn’t the day to play around with me though.  

I tucked my book into my backpack and tossed it over my shoulder. This was a beautiful park we were in. I just wanted peace and quiet. 

“Someone needs to pull my finger! Have at it.”  

I took a sip of coffee and finally spoke up. “Look man, I know the gag. You want to fart and have a laugh. It’s honestly disgusting that you are choosing to do this. It’s my only day off.” 

“Someone’s gotta do it” he let out a chuckle. 

“Okay, well go find someone else then. I’m not in the mood.” 

He stared me up and down a minute. This area of New York wasn’t exactly safe. For all I knew, he could have been someone high or just trying to get his YouTube views.

“Couldn’t you just do it? It would help me out?”

“I said no, back off before I call the cops!” I stood up as the big man took a few steps.

“Fine, party pooper.” He turned around and began to walk off. 

After a few moments of sitting alone, I stood up and began to walk back to my apartment. Lightning boomed through the clouds and it sent shivers up my spine. 

I was walking through the park when a homeless man approached me. “Got any money? I’m awfully hungry.” 

“I’m sorry, I don’t. I’d be happy to buy you a coffee and sandwich If you want to follow me to the deli up the road.”

He stared at me as if I insulted him. “Got any money?”

“I’m sorry, no.” I continued to walk. It bothered me I’d offer him a meal and he just wanted my money. His voice spoke up.

“Death is here, death likes to play games sometimes.” 

I didn’t know if it was a threat or if he was high. Drugs have taken over this city. Between that and how expensive it is to even have a small studio apartment like mine, it makes sense why there’s so many homeless people here. 

I sped up my pace because it just felt like I was being followed. I turned my head back and the man sat down on bench and was waiting to ask for money again. Lightning struck again and the rain became heavier. I was getting soaked. 

In front of me again was the fat man who was up to his Tom foolery. He approached a few teenagers who took shelter under a picnic area . I ran to the area to sit until the rain calmed down. 

The man looked at me a moment and turned his head to the teenagers. One was sitting there and smoking a cigarette. They were playing on their phones and laughing loudly. 

The man leaned his arm forward again. “Pull my finger!” For some reason a cold chill crept over me. 

One of the teens laughed and one pulled up his phone to take a video. 

“Yo! We are in the park and it’s raining cats and dogs! This cat came forward and wants us to pull his finger. Don’t ya man!?”

The man stared with a big smile. He repeated his request. 

“Okay then! I’m going for-“ 

That was the last thing he said. He grabbed the mans finger and froze. His friends chuckled at first and stopped when they seen he wasn’t moving. Blood was pouring from his eyes and what sounded like branches snapping appeared to be his bones breaking. He dropped to the ground. 

One of the other teens jumped up from the table to check on his friend. Another stood up and tried to tackle the man before his body went completely limp and fell to the ground. The big man was smiling. 

The teen holding the camera dropped his and grabbed his kneeling friend and dragged at him. They tripped through the wooded area and kept going. One pulled out his phone to call for help. The man turned to me and smiled again.

“Maybe next time.” 

Lightning struck brightly and he was wearing a black robe. He was a skeleton holding a scythe.

I backed up and fell on my butt. Lightning struck brightly again. 

Standing before me was a skinny old man in a black suit. He was wearing a Boston hat and holding onto a black cane. He pulled out a silver pocket watch and made a clicking noise with his tongue. 

“Well, well. I must be on my way. I have…an appointment to get to.” He turned around and let the cane lead him. 

He stopped and turned his head back to me. “By the way, I recommend you quit smoking.” 

He walked towards the path and vanished. 

I could see sirens through the tree line. I ran back to my apartment.
