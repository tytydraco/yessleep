I’m gonna preface this by saying I am not an active reddit user. 

I’ve had my account for a couple years now, but it was mainly during high school to find and share memes with my friends. I think I’ve made like one post and that’s about it. 

I joined this subreddit at the suggestion of one of my friends who helped me put my thoughts together and he said this would belong here - so I hope he’s right.

If my writing is not the best, I’m sorry, I failed English. Twice. 

So please don’t expect too much from me. 



There is a lot I don’t remember about my childhood. I can remember bits and pieces of it. A flash here, and a memory there. A smile, a cake with candles and my sister; Anna. 

Any of my earliest memories featured Anna. She was a year younger than me, and she was my absolute best friend in the whole world. 

I was five when Anna was taken. The last time I saw Anna was seventeen years ago, and still to this day I feel the ache of missing her in my bones. It wrecks me every time I think about her. Sometimes it’s too much for me to bear. A lot of the details around my sister's disappearance remain unknown to me. My mum never mentions her, she never had any pictures around the house. It was like she wanted to forget that Anna existed. Maybe she thought I was too young to remember her. And she’s right. The only time I see my sister are in the flashes of memories I’ll have. Never for too long, and the more I dwell on her memory the more I forget her. 

A friend of my roommate is studying to become a therapist and says the gaps in my memory from my childhood are a sign of CPTSD, complex post-traumatic stress disorder. 

I don’t want to see any shrinks though to confirm her ‘*diagnosis*’, I’m well adjusted. 

So, with this out of the way, let me get into the crux of things. 



My name is Sophie. I am twenty-two years old, and I go to the University of Wollongong where I’m studying to become a primary school teacher. For anyone unaware of Australian school systems primary school is students from five and six (kindergartens) to eleven and twelve (year six). I don’t know why I wanted to pursue a career in teaching. I was never really the brightest bulb in the box and was a terrible student. I hated my own school experience - I remember seeing a brochure for it on my guidance counsellor's desk one day in year twelve and decided that’s what I’d do. 

No real passion for it, but I’m already here so I may as well finish. Not like my debt will go away if I drop out now. 

It’s currently winter break from the university, so no classes, no school placements and those who can go home normally do. Since leaving home I’ve never returned, Mum’s never mentioned missing me, never invites me over so I don’t bother. I should miss her and miss home, but I don’t, it was never much of a home after Anna disappeared. Things are just easier in the dorm room I share with Amelia (my roommate). She’s studying to be a vet which is nice. Something she is visibly passionate about. She’s due to finish her course after the next semester and I’ve got another two years left, so soon enough we’ll have to part ways, but I choose to forget about that and to live in blissful ignorance until all her stuff is packed and she’s gone. 

A deep part of me resents Amelia though. Resents might not be the best word, she actually has found something she’s passionate about. She came to school with a plan and has almost achieved it. It’s a sad and bitter part of myself I like to keep hidden, but I long to find the same passion for anything in my life, rather than just…floating around. Existing. It’s just pointless. Envious might be a better suited word. 



So, with this winter break, Amelia, myself and a couple of her friends who also stay on campus for break tend to hang out. I don’t really know her friends well, and I’m only ever invited due to my status as ‘roommate’, but if it keeps me occupied, I won’t complain. 

The last time they all hung out was a week or so ago at a flat belonging to two of Amelia’s friends. Honestly, time has sort of blurred together while forming this. The only one to keep me tethered to reality is Amelia and my friend Chris. Chris was a boy who I went to school with, he’s the reason I have a reddit account in the first place. And without him, I never would have had the courage to post on here. Amelia and Chris are probably the only friends I have. I lost contact with everyone else from high school. 

Chris wasn’t here for these events, but he knows what's happened and drove up here to keep me sane, from our old town it takes about four hours to get to Wollongong, so him taking the time to drive up here for me is truly amazing. I don’t know what I did to deserve a friend like him. 

Since it's the winter break, we get a month off in between our two semesters. Amelia and I knew this would be my last chance to fully…’*relax*’. We knew when classes start up again, I would be completing a school placement for the rest of my course, working as a teacher's aide for the final stretch of my Uni course. Most of these placements lead to proper jobs by the end, but it is never guaranteed. I'd have to be on my best behaviour, act like a real teacher would act. It wouldn’t be too difficult for me. I’ve never touched any kind of illicit drugs until last week and I’ve never liked the taste of alcohol. The role of deso driver is normally given to me since I’m always the sober one at parties.



Amelia and her friends hung out over a week ago. I was, of course, also invited. It was in her friend Kyle and Danny’s flat. I always wondered how they afforded the flat, it was close to the beaches and the main party strip of Wollongong. Neither Kyle or Danny worked from what I knew, and they were both failing their Bachelor of Art courses, so I figured their parents must be rich or some shit. 

So, there we were, in the boys' large flat, music playing, more people joining until there were five others, excluding myself. No one really paid much attention to me, so I sat towards the window facing the ocean and scrolled aimlessly on my phone, the screen would keep going fuzzy, so I’d have to leave the phone on the windowsill while the picture returned properly. I had like, fifty videos sent from Chris which I had to get through. Each one of course, made me chuckle and respond with the stupid laughing face emoji. My attention was taken as one of Amelia’s friends, Bec started yelling obnoxiously about: ‘getting this party started.’ Which made the other young adults scream in agreement. 



My social battery was nearing the negatives and I’d only been here for half an hour. It was gonna be a long night. 

Bec pulls out the clear Ziploc bag from her satchel, raising it high as if it was Simba and she was Rafiki. The bag looked like it contained dried, green herbs. I wasn’t born yesterday, so I knew it was weed. I don’t really care what others do so I paid little attention to those around the room. 

It wasn’t until Amelia came up to me, her eyes bloodshot and glassy that my attention was put in something other than my phone. She had a dazed and blissed out expression, there was another pang of something similar to jealousy when seeing how free she was. 

“Soph…Babes. You fucking need to try this.” Amelia says, her body wobbling slightly. Inebriated Amelia always made some funny memories. 

“I’m good Ames, you know I don’t like that kinda stuff.” I say back and she loudly ‘Boos’ at me. “Come oooooooon.” She drags on. “You won’t be able to do it next semester and I’m leaving soon so it’d be the last time we can do this!” She pouted. 

I could almost guarantee this wouldn’t be the last time this group got together and got high. But you can’t reason with Amelia when she’s like this. They are all lucky their courses don’t require them to complete drug tests otherwise they’d all be fucked with how much they do this, so Amelia was way off. 

“Maybe another time Ames.” I say finally and she nods and frowns deeper before walking practically stomping away. 

I remember sighing and bringing my attention back to the window, watching the dark waves crashing into the sand.

“Ayyyyy we’re gonna go for a swim!” Kyle says, starting to remove his shirt and I groan. It was too cold for this shit but reasoning with them would be pointless. It was dark and winter and hopefully there’d be no sharks out there because I don’t want to see a remake of Jaws.

 

The group started making their way to the soft sand of the beach and I followed behind dutifully, the cold air bit at my skin and I wish I brought a better jacket. Bec and Amelia walked a little slower, not the full-on sprints that Kyle, Alex and Danny were doing, them stripping off their clothes as they ran. I beat the urge to roll my eyes at them and continued to find a spot to sit. Amelia and Bec both had joints lit as they inhaled the drugs, and they joined me on the beach. Their clouds of smoke, and I laughed softly as my breath started to cloud as well. 

Bec pointed her joint at me, offering it without asking and I shook my head to decline again.

Amelia whined that ‘*I never do anything fun*.’ And it stung a bit that she was right. I was boring. But at least I knew that. Still hurt when your friend confirms it. 

“You know, they’re doing studies of how weed is actually beneficial. Especially if memory loss is involved.” My head turns fully towards Bec, and she grins. Bec was the friend studying to be a therapist, so I guess she would know the newest trials happening in the world of brain science.

“What’s that got to do with anything?” I asked and she smiled politely, joint hanging out of her mouth as she rolled another one. 

She lit the new joint with the old one before tossing the butt of the smoke into the sand to extinguish. 

“You know. Your childhood, your weird, repressed memories…” Bec trails off and I bit my nail nervously. 

“That would…help?” I ask softly and Bec grins. “Honestly, even if it doesn’t help, it's not like you can forget more about your childhood.” Bec responds and Amelia laughs before becoming solemn. 

“What if she repressed her memories for a reason?” Amelia asks softly and I felt a shiver crawl up my spine from something other than the cold ocean air. 

“Shut up Amelia, do you want her to smoke it or not?” Bec snips and I was about to rebut until the three shivering, purple bodies approached us - looking miserable. 

“We’re going back inside.” Danny says, shivering and covering his crotch with his hands and clothes. “Why would you let us do that?” Kyle asks, lips completely devoid of any pink, looking like he just ate a blue lolly with the shade his lips were. 

“Don’t blame us, you’re the idiots who wanted to swim.” Bec retorts and Kyle shakes his soaked hair over the top of us, the water so cold it felt like being stabbed by tiny ice picks. Bec and Amelia screamed, and I just brought the jacket closer to me. 

“Here, you can have this one.” Bec says, handing me the join she just rolled and lit. There was about three quarters left of it and she placed the joint in between my fingers, both her and Amelia watching on eagerly. 

I hesitated. 

I could smell the burnt broccoli scent from the joint and recoiled, but slowly I brought the offending item closer. 

I closed my eyes and took a toke. 



I think I inhaled too much, because there was nothing but pain. It was terrifying. My lungs hurt and my throat hurt. I started coughing so hard I thought I was going to pass out. I felt dizzy and disorientated and like all my skin was buzzing. I could barely hear the laughs from Bec and Amelia over the sounds of my blood pumping in my ears. Eventually the pain subsided but the coughing was still prevalent. 

“Why the fuck would you make me try that?” I asked, wheezing between every word. 

“You’ll be fine. Keep smoking though, you’ll get better the more you do it.” Amelia says with a nod, and I slowly bring the joint back up, inhaling with Bec’s instructions. It was better this time, the coughing not as rough. My body felt like it was humming. I don’t know long weed is supposed to be in your system before you start feeling the effects of the THC or whatever chemical it is that makes you high, we sat on the beach for a little while longer. Until my joint was complete, and we shared the last one that Bec rolled. I felt at peace. I think for the first time in twenty-two years, I had a wave of calmness roll over me. 

Bec was wrong so far about the memories, but I’ve never been so relaxed before.

Or so hungry.

We must have all been on the same wavelength, because Bec and Amelia stood up wobbling as they stood. “Come, we’ll go back inside, they definitely have frozen pizza slabs that would go hard right about now.” Bec says and I laugh as they help me stand.

The dizziness I felt as I stood was something else. The world moved in ways I don’t remember. Up was down and down was up, but there was something familiar about the feeling of dizziness. 

I tried to cling on to the familiar feeling, but it was fleeting. As we got closer to the flat, we could see all the lights were on and the boys were dancing to some unheard music, still in nothing but at least their privates were covered. This time.

The closer we got to the flat, I don’t know. It was weird. I felt like I was on the verge of a panic attack, there was just too much going on. There was a constant buzz in the air, one that I feel like it was always there, humming in the background. It sounded like electricity. I missed the peaceful and calm feeling. Panicked and high is not a good combination. 



Bec and Amelia were the first to go back into the flat, still I hesitated before reaching out to touch the door. And as suspected, the jolt of static arced from the metal door handle, zapping my hand, resulting in my letting out a yelp like a kicked dog.

The zapping had nothing to do with the weed, however. My whole life I’ve been…conductive.

Every door, every bit of metal I will always zap myself. My hair will always retain a static frizz no matter what products I use or YouTube videos I watch, sometimes I’ll even mess with electronics. Chris said I’m cursed, and he never let me near his computer as we were growing up. Which is fair. This is only relevant since the zap was just worse tonight. I swear it left a red mark.

I never thought the zapping had a meaning. Why would it? It happens so often I never pay attention to it. 

But after the events of last week, I know there has to be more to it.

The rest of the night was okay, I ended up having more fun with these five people in one night than I have in the four years I’ve known them. Since I could no longer drive, we had decided to stay the night. I won’t get into the shitshow that was the sleeping arrangements, but I had taken the couch, secluded and away from everyone. Something I desperately needed as the high was starting to wear off and I was getting sleepy. 

I will say this: The first half of my sleep was the best sleep I have *ever* had.

The second half however, well that's why I'm posting here.



It wasn't the sleep itself that left me horrified. It was my dream, then what followed after. It's left me with more questions than answers and I'm sorry. I'm trying to keep my thoughts in order, they keep jumbling up. I'll try and write down what I can remember from my dream.

So, in my dream, I'm sitting in the loungeroom in my mum's house, the one I grew up in. I'm in the middle of watching my cartoons when the TV loses service. This was one of those old TVs every house in the 90s and early 2000s had. Large and box-like. Just like the one we had when I was a kid. 

The tv wouldn't regain the picture no matter what I did. I tried playing with the antenna, moving the ears so much the only thing that would change was the clarity of the sound. 

I tried hitting the top as I'd seen people do in the movies, and still no results. I even asked for mum's assistance, but she ignored me. 

Even my prayers were left unanswered.  

So, I was left to my own devices. The TV would not work, no matter what. All I could do was sit and stare at the static that buzzed around the screen. Flashing a black and white greyscale.

Where this started to get scary was when I focused on the sound accompanying the hum of the static. 

There were whispers coming from our tv. 

And they weren't the voice lines from the show that was supposed to be on. I never changed the channel, so it should have been lines from the cartoons I was missing. 

These voices were horrific. They were deep and raspy. They sounded like my grandfather, who was a chronic smoker. The croakiness and roughness of the voice still gives me shivers just writing about it.

The voice was whispering.

Whispering *to* me!

‘*Come closer*.’

‘*Come closer Sophie*.’

The voice had said, part of me moved back in fear, but the other part of me wanted to move in closer. To listen to the mysterious voice.

‘*Come to us Sophie*.’ The voice continued, and even in my dreams I still felt compelled to shuffle closer. I never noticed until writing this that the voice was saying 'us' and 'we'. As if there were more than one of them.

There was a familiarity around this situation, like I had been in it before. Except last time, I wasn’t alone, and the TV wasn’t talking to me.

‘*Come Sophie, we know you want to.*’ It continues, the voice adding a cheeky lilt to the sound, like it was trying different things to get me closer. 

I had risen to my feet, still unsure about this, and had decided to go find my Mum, surely, she’d know what to do with a staticky TV.

‘*Anna misses you so much Sophie.*’ The voice whispers and I turn slowly back towards the TV ice traveling up my spine, I start moving closer than before.

“Anna?” I whispered, the name sounding foreign, like I haven’t said it for years. 

‘*Anna needs help, Sophie. Will you be a good big sister and help her?*’ It taunts and I could feel tears well up in my eyes at the idea of Anna being trapped and needing me to rescue her. I was frozen. 

“Where is she?” I asked in a small voice, the TV remained silent until I got closer.

‘*She is with us, in here. We will never let her go. Join us, join her. She will suffer without you.*’ The TV practically growls this, still the voice never rising above a whisper. I sobbed.

Where was my Mum? Where was my sister? I was alone, in this room with the TV seemingly getting bigger and bigger. 

“Where is she!?” I yelled louder, moving closer. The deep voice chuckled, there seemed to be different layers to the laugh, like there were multiple voices all speaking in unison.

The laughing got louder and louder until I had to cup my hands over my ears to try and block it out. It wouldn't stop. From what I could see through my teary eyes, I saw the TV's static move around, almost as if it was portraying shapes. I was still close enough to the TV that I could feel the heat coming off the screen and the way my hair was being attracted to it, almost reaching towards it.

I let my eyes clear in an effort to focus on the shapes in the screen, my eyebrows furrowed as I tried to make out the intricate features on the screen in front of me. The laughing seemed to have died down slightly, it was still there and loud, but I could pick up other sounds coming from the TV. Still not sounds from my show, but it was softer, quieter.

It was crying.

It sounded like a child crying.

The shapes started coming together more until they started to resemble a face. A gaunt, thin face with sunken cheeks and hollowed eyes. It was a little girl, and she was crying.

The laughing continues but I paid little attention as I bring my face closer to the TV than ever before, placing my hands on the warm glass.

"Anna?" I whispered and the figure looked up and through the screen and the girl moves closer. Still crying but hiccupping at the same time.  
Anna used to cry the exact same way, hiccupping through her tears. I always found it adorable, so this must have been her!

"-Ophie?" The girl whispers and all the laughter stopped.

"*Anna!"* It was a scream mixed with fear and desperation. There were too many questions to ask and no one who'd be able to answer them! Anna continued crying and reaching for me through the TV.

"I-I'm scared Ophie." Anna whispers and even though I'm crying, a small smile still graces my lips. It had been so long since I've heard Anna say my name. She never could say it right. Funny how all these facts are bubbling to the surface after being buried for so long.



I had so many things I wanted to say. So many things I *needed* to say. But every word was caught in my throat, I couldn't speak. I could only take in the image of my sister, fuzzy and distorted by the static. There was no sound other than the hum from the TV and the hiccupping from my sister. It was so quiet it was a relief. I couldn't wait to tell Mum that I saw Anna again. She would be so happy. Maybe she'd start smiling again.

Any pleasant feelings I were having were stopped abruptly, by a loud scream coming from Anna as a shadowy hand seemed to wrap around her face. She was fighting against it, resisting as much as she could. I punched and smacked at the glass of the TV, begging the monsters to take me instead, to give me Anna back but they didn't listen. Slowly, Anna's features melted away from the screen leaving nothing but empty static in its wake. I wailed, what more could I do? I just hung my head and cried.

My hands were still pressed against the glass, my hands buzzing from the screen. There was nothing to fill the room but the sounds of my cries and the hum of the TV.

After what felt like an eternity, I looked up, and as I did a shadow crossed the screen, so fast and reached out towards me, it was so quick I barely had time to react. A black silhouetted hand seemed to have encased my flesh one, I fought against it as my left hand seemed to disappear within the static, there was a sensation akin to pins and needles, as if I had fallen asleep with my hand in an odd position and the blood was starting to circulate again. I screamed and fought back against the shadow, trying everything in my power to bring my hand back into the real world. I used every bit of strength I had in my body to reef my hand out of the TV. I screamed for my Mum, but she never came to help, I was completely alone with nothing but the monsters in front of me.



After a while, struggling the whole time, I started to feel myself get tired, but I mustn't have been the only one. It felt as if they lost their grip on my hand, because I could *finally* pull my hand out. My hand was red and bruised, but as I backed away from the TV, my hand clutched securely to my chest, there was a loud roar from the box. It was so loud I had to cover my ears again, I could feel liquid sloshing in my ears as the TV cracked right down the screen from the noise.

That was when I woke up.

If I thought the dream was the worst of it, I was wrong.

I think I screamed myself awake, however I woke up, I've never jolted upright so quickly in my life. My heart felt as if it was trying to leave my ribcage, I don't think it's ever beat so hard. My hands were grasping at my chest, and I could feel myself hyperventilating. It felt like water was coming out of my ears, so instinctively I brought my hands up to check, I didn't notice at the time, but there was a light source filling the room, and from the light I could see something way too dark to be water covering my hands.

I was confused and disorientated, the room was filled with a grey flashing light, which, after getting my bearings, I realised was coming from the large flatscreen tv the boys had mounted on the wall.

In all my twenty-two years of life, I have never seen an advanced, flatscreen, smart whatever you call it, TV *ever* produce an old school static screen. These screens died out with the analogue TV; it has been almost a decade since I'd seen a *real* screen go static like this. It was unnerving after the horrible dream I had, as I stood to find the control, I felt woozy, dizzy - like I was suffering with the worst case of vertigo I've ever had. My head was practically swimming. My balance was starting to return, and the search for the TV remote continued. As my back faced the TV, that was when I heard it.



Knocking.

Something sounded like knocking on glass. There was nothing outside from what I could see, but the knocking sounded like it was coming from inside the living room. A horrible idea crossed my mind. One that made ice travelled up my spine and the shiver made my teeth rattle, and it wasn't from the cold.

Slowly, so very slowly, I turned around, bracing myself for what I would see when I looked at the TV.

When nothing was there, I let out a long breath, a sigh I anxiously held in was released and my tense shoulders began to loosen. I started to feel a little foolish, I'm not even sure what I was expecting, but I looked away from the screen to continue the search for the remote control, after what seemed like forever, I still couldn't find it, so I decided to just turn it off at the TV, most TVs had a button to press to manually switch it on or off, so I figured this would be the same.

As I got closer to the large screen, still flashing black and white static, my stomach seemed to drop, like my body was reacting before my mind knew what was happening. As I was about to turn the TV off, I heard the soft hum I've been hearing my whole life, it was quiet and constant, the sound was emitting from the TV, making my hair frizz up, like in my dream.

I needed to pinch myself to bring myself back to reality, but before I could do that, faces flashed across the screen, I screamed and jumped back. This was when everything starts to get fuzzy.

I remember seeing the shadowy figures, like the hand from my nightmare, they looked like they were circling something. I remember them screaming loudly and hearing the high pitch wails of someone in pain.

Something snapped in me when I thought I heard Anna yelling for me. I smacked at the TV, I remember screaming at the top on my lungs, swearing at the figures, bargaining for Anna's life in exchange for mine, but they fell on deaf ears. Could these monsters even hear me?

I didn't know, but my fear was turning into rage.

"*Give me my sister back you fucks!"* I yelled at the screen, I threw the first thing I could grab which was an expensive looking lamp at the TV, I don't know, maybe hoping if I broke it, it would spit my sister out.

They still showed no sign of hearing me, just continued to...eat? Kill? Whatever they were doing to Anna, I moved closer.

"*Anna! Anna, can you hear me?!"* I continued to scream, "*Fuck you! Give her back! Argggh CUNTS!!"* I roared this time.

I don't know when it happened, there was another flash and one of the shadowy figures were right in front of the screen, its hand was outstretched towards me in the real world, before I could step back, his hand connected to my head. I could feel as the long spindly fingers of the creature burrow deep into my head, it felt as if it had cracked my skull open and was poking around in my brain. Its fingers were under my eyelids, in my ears, completely overwhelming me. Scratching at my skull like rats.

"*We still have your sister..."* It speaks directly into my brain, I shuddered but was frozen.

"*This is all your fault."* It whispers harshly. I wanted to know what it meant. I wanted my sister back.

"**We will feed on her for eternity**." Its hand seemed to rip from my head, and I felt my eyes roll to the back as the lights are switched on. I seemed to have started convulsing, I head a couple of people speaking. I couldn't understand everything only bits and pieces, but I couldn't open my eyes. Remembering these now I can sort of put together who said what, but I haven't confirmed this with Amelia yet.



"*What the fuck she broke my TV!"*

*"I'm calling the ambos!"*

*"Did you lace the weed with something!?"*



That's about the last thing I remembered. Next thing I knew, I woke up in hospital. It was three days since the party, and no one knew what happened. Bec swears that the weed wasn't laced with anything and since she grows it herself, I believe her. I also didn't smoke enough to green out and hallucinate.

I've never had a seizure before, I am not epileptic, and neither is anyone in my family. No one has had a history with seizures, mental illness or hallucinations. I had to clarify this with three different doctors since none of them could piece together what caused the seizure, the only thing they could deduce was that my brain had slight swelling, and my ears were bleeding, which was a sign of massive trauma, but no one could figure out why. I didn't want to divulge the certain events that preceded this, but I knew it had to be the reason.

After I was released from hospital Amelia had brought me home to look after me. I knew she felt guilty, and I felt like an asshole because this has created a rift between the friend group. Amelia still accused Bec of lacing the weed and even though I try to advocate for Bec they've both stopped talking.

The next day Chris showed up, all Amelia had to say was that 'I was just released from hospital.' And Chris dropped everything to check on me.

He was given the same bullshit answer I gave everyone, but he saw right through it.

So, I ended up telling him *and* Amelia the whole thing. Funnily enough, I was expecting them to call a mental hospital and accuse me of needing help, but they didn't. They listened. And hugged me. I don't know if they are thinking I'm delusional and are going with it to keep me placid, which they both deny but come on. Who would admit that?



A scary thing that confuses me more is when I heard Amelia's side of things.

She says, she was awoken by Bec because she heard me yelling and was too afraid to check on me herself. I must have woken everybody up since they all seemed to have gotten to the loungeroom at the same time.

They saw me screaming at the TV, then me freeze, start shaking and then collapse in seizures. My eyes were apparently open even though I couldn't see anything, and my ears were bleeding. The TV screen was also black. Apparently, the whole time I was screaming at it, it was never on and there was never a static screen. Turns out I did break the TV but also an expensive lamp that was a family heirloom. Sorry Kyle.

Chris convinced me to post here so I hope someone has had a similar experience, maybe even seen the shadow people in the static. I just need someone to confirm this, because I feel insane.

Over these past couple of days, I seem to have remembered more about my sister and more about my childhood. Part of me wants to try smoking the weed again, maybe it *is* the key in unlocking my memories, I just don't know if I'm game to try it again.

I might also reach out to my mother, and maybe see if anything I'm remember actually happened and hopefully corroborate some of my thoughts.



If I have any updates or you want to know more, I'll keep posting on here, but for now I am done. I definitely need to watch some Disney movies or some shit.

I'm so fucking scared.
