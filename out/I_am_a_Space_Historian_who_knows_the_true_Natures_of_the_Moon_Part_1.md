 

I am X.

I am a Scientist and A historian working as a university teacher. My main job as an archivist is to record the story of multiple missions of humanity in space. 

What all humans now learn in the 21st century is that the early 1940s were simply the darkest times in human history. In 1939, the dictator Adolf Hitler, who was in power in Germany at the time, started a global war to create an idealistic world. And his ambitions came to a failure in 1945. Ever since then, Germany had to live with resentment from all over the world. During that time, Germany was split into west and east. Among them, West Germany worked the hardest to clean up the past, and the winner of the war, the United States, signed a diplomatic exchange relationship with West Germany in 1955.

During the period before the diplomatic American-German Relationship, humanity was craving for something out of this planet, the universe. The Superpowers of the world at the period were the U.S And Soviet Russia, both who were also craving for the way to space. There were multiple theories at that time about the reason why people were heading to space. Philanthropists stated that this was a great opportunity for human evolution, and conspiracy theorists were speaking of doom and insanity that humanity needed a new planet ASAP.

The world believed that Americans would win the race between Soviets relating to the first people to reach space. On April 21st of 1961, humanity woke up to a message from the Soviets, that they had managed to send a Man in a spacecraft to the universe, giving Americans a taste of defeat in their race..

A decade later, in 1970, mankind was now craving to find technology to head to space. The Historical moment of the First man on the moon, Neil Armstrong, happened last year. Which would be a bigger achievement than simply heading to the universe, giving soviets a taste of defeat, and prompting multiple countries across the globe to find their ways to contribute to humanity’s quest of reaching space. 

The Reason why I am telling you this already known fact, is that this entire Neil Armstrong landing on the moon triggered the biggest loss and tragedy for two nations, Germany and the US. It has also prompted the governments of the two nations to never start another mission to the moon.

—

The Americans were obsessed with the moon, starting with their landing on it. And with some thought in mind, There were multiple theories and possibilities of how humans could use the moon landing as a chance to develop space technology.

The Same Year when Neil Armstrong had landed on the moon was when the German Leader came to America in order to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the German and American Relationship. Because of the world’s interests, The two national leaders of Germany and America At That time, had hired multiple scientists to create something in space, the current interest of the human race. 

Project Grauegarten, The Grey Garden Project were first named in 1970, August 3rd.

The Only thing that the public knew by then was that Both Americans and Germans had joined forces to build something on the moon, but that was not the real case here.

The Project’s true purpose was to artificially engineer parts of the moon to be inhabitable by humans and animals without any protective gear on them, the reason why project was started for 2 reasons.

The first purpose was to find an environment where humans could live. Since the Industrial Revolution, as humans built factories, the air in cities has been polluted, and there are fewer countries in the world that can breathe fresh air in cities. Some Geologists suggested that there could be a period that could last permanently where humans will not be able to breathe fresh air. When the government discovered some technology that was used by the Space agencies could ‘quarantine’ things inside, they wanted to test if that worked on the moon and possibly recreate parts of the planet Earth on the moon.

The second purpose was to improve the tourism industry, there were multiple people across the planet that wanted to travel to the space, and the thing about it was that not all of them wanted to be astronauts as their career, but the term ‘travel to the space’ was used to describe their desire to have a holiday on the dark realm of the stars. As such, people were wondering if there could be things like Theme parks on the moon. 

The scale of the project was really big. 

German and American Space agency both sent the following people in their nation on the moon: 5 Astroneers to build the base on the moon and explore the area, 5 scholars (Biologists, geographers, physicists, cosmologists, historians) to record what happens on the moon, 3 Chefs to feed the staff working on the base, 2 Doctors to treat injuries and investigate the effects of human bodies, 2 Pilots for the ship, A translator to translate german and English between the two factions. In total, 36 people were going to the moon. 

The 18 people of each nation had started their basic training to work safely on the moon, they have done multiple test runs and studied multiple facts of the space that are useful. The whole process lasted 5 years, and over the course of 5 years, the president changed in America.

While the rest of the world were doing their business for nearly a half a decade, they were starting to forget the fact that Germany and America was doing a big project to build a base on the moon. Some people who remembered were considered as conspiracy theorists and it did bring some social problems across the society that were minor, but still.

During the training process, there have also been a lot of mishaps in the agencies as well. Some people who were heading to the moon had to be replaced for multiple reasons, their declining mentality, the misconducts on the workplace, and there was a 2 week period in America where Multiple Agents had joined a strike that delayed America to do some work on the space stuff, which would also delay the Germans as well.

To sum up, the road to the moon was a long adventure, but on August 3rd of 1975, exactly 5 years after the Project was announced, Entirety of America had witnessed the space shuttle ‘Creation’, carrying the 18 man ascend to the skies. 

On August 4th of 1975, In Germany. The Space shuttle called ‘Cosmos’, ascended in the german skies. The two nations had celebrated the ascension, the evolution of human technology and wished the best of luck to the valorous 36 who were heading to the moon.

They thought it was mentally difficult to be on the moon for an extremely long time at once, so they planned to shuttle back and forth between the moon and the earth. 

The period on the moon this time is 2 months, the date started from the time of landing on the moon.

Each 15 days, there would be transmission between the moon and the planet via a satellite that would be transmitted to the space agencies of the two factions. 

3 Days after Americans witnessed the ascension of Creation, The American Space Agency Received the first transmission via a Satellite from the Captain of the Creation Crew, The Transmission contained two messages. The First was that all 18 men aboard the ship have safely set foot on the moon, The Second was a message from the German transmission translated in English, which was about Germany’s Intention for a specific Emergency Protocol to be activated when there is no transmission from any of the factions in 15 days.

We sent a message that Americans will obey the German’s Operation when a situation like that happened, and that was the message given by the American Captain on the moon.

15 days Later, on the 22nd of August, we got a transmission from the Americans, in order to test out some of the engineering methods they can use to make the Moon Inhabitable. They wanted Marmottes to be sent to the moon. In Response, The Agency Sent 5 Monkeys and 3 dogs into space in pilot-controlled Aircraft. Another 3 days have passed, we have gotten another transmission from the Americans, Thanking for the Animals, and that they have reached the moon safely.

Another 5 days passed and the President of U.S at that time have decided to announce a new message from the Moon to the public, stating that the Scientists on the moon have discovered a way to live in the Moon in a suitable way, and they will be extending their time on the moon in order to study a way for everyone on planet earth to live in the moon without any artificial help such as Spacesuits.

However, what the public didn’t know, and still don’t know, is that this Announcement was a lie.

On 22nd of August, Morning in American Time, Instead of one transmission, The Space Agency Received two transmissions from the moon to their base of operations on earth. The First Transmission was something that made everyone on the Agency freeze from fear. The Sound of Glasses breaking, Sirens and the desperate screams of Valorous man who headed to the moon were on the file. The Sound of Animal Noises were heard in the background, and there were even sounds of explosions in the background.

The Second Transmission was a message from a member of the moon base. Instead of an message about the situation in the base being calmed and settled, the Agency had gotten a message that could’ve been considered worse than the screams of the first one:

*“I'm Jess D. Wilder, I feel like I'm the only one on this site right now. Before I lost consciousness. I saw the bodies of Americans in front of me, I don't know where they are now.  This message Might not be sent to Earth, but I warn mankind if it does, give up your research on the moon.. The Moon is not a place to create Paradise… Because Hell’s gates already resides on the moon.”*

This sent the entire agency into an emergency state. Once we sent the translated message to the German Space Agency, The Two Agencies had formed an emergency meeting the following day. That was when Germans initiated the German Operation to find out what had happened on the moon.

And while the entire protocol stuff sounded like a complicated operation, the contents of the mission were simple: send more people to the moon to investigate and if possible, recover the bodies of the dead.

On September 1st of 1975, Americans witnessed the takeoff of another rocket in the Space Agency, the shuttle named ‘Explorer’ had 12 people in the ship, their destination was the moon base, and their goal was to follow the protocol of the Germans. On the Following day, Germans Sent the ship ‘Vahalla’ to outer space with the same purpose with the same amount of people. 

The Two Nations held another celebration, as the leaders of the nation said that what they were doing was to live on the moon and expand the civilization we are planning. 

What they didn’t know was that in each 2 ships, everyone was unhappy. They had gotten the Briefing of the mission, and due to the sheer mystery surrounding the events of the moon, this mission was essentially an suicide mission. 

The Captain that led the expedition to find out what was happening on the moon was in the American Faction was a Pilot Named Wallace. F. Smith. Wallace had experience dealing with astronomy stuff at the agency during WW2 As a engineer.

The Supervisor for the Germans during their mission to the moon was an astronomer named Timm Ehler. Ehler was a controversial figure due to the fact that he had been a son of an Nazi Officer. However, controversy towards him being a pro-Nazi was short-lived, as by the time he headed to the rocket, he had announced to cut ties with his Father and live with his Jewish Uncle once he returned to earth after the mission on the moon.

The Two Ships Headed to the moon, While the rocket was heading to the universe, the Passengers had their last prayer on earth.

The people of America Expected for their return in a few months. However, in the 19th of that same month, the space shuttle Explorer returned to Planet Earth with nobody, not even the space agency personnel expecting the return of the Ship, in fact, it was revealed in their documents that over the weeks, they themselves have not gotten a single signal from the moon saying that the People who went to the moon were going to return to planet earth.

The Agency Personnel, including the director, headed to the landing site of the Rocket, and saw The Pilot of the ship, Wallace F. Smith, leave the rocket with shaking legs. Multiple Personnel came to his aid, once he was capable of walking alone, he gave the Director his nametag and his Journal, stating that he will be resigning without any questions asked. He immediately headed to the entry of the Agency, and while everyone was confused at his sudden announcement to resign. Wallace F. Smith borrowed a gun from the security guard that patrolled the building, and immediately shot himself in the head.

Nobody else came from the rocket, except for Wallace. Whose Body was recovered and taken to the morgue as the rest of the Agency took his Last Journal and tried to decipher what had happened out of this planet, since it seemed as if Wallace gave the agency his note as a message to the rest of the planet.

During my investigation with the Moon, one of the acquaintances of mine handed me the last notes of Wallace F. Smith, which would let me have the chance to find out what has truly happened to the two groups on the moon.
