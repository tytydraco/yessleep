There’s a heaviness that comes with certain places. A kind of weight that sinks into your skin, that you don’t notice right away but feel creeping in slowly, day by day. That’s how it was with the apartment. It wasn’t much, just four gray walls in a tired, aging building on the edge of Norilsk.

People called it the most depressing city in the world, and they weren’t wrong. The air here felt thick, like it was clinging to you, and it never really warmed up, even when the sun peeked through the clouds. Most days it didn’t. You lived in a kind of gray, perpetual twilight, where the hours bled into each other, and you weren’t sure if you were waking up or going to bed.

I moved into the apartment because it was cheap. No questions asked, and the landlord didn’t care about anything more than getting the rent on time. It seemed perfect at first: a small place of my own, quiet neighbors who kept to themselves. Too quiet, maybe, but I didn’t mind.

I had been living there for just over two months when I noticed I was out of cooking oil. It seemed like a small inconvenience, but the thought of braving the cold again didn’t sit well with me. The store was a fair walk away, and I wasn’t keen on making the trip.

I remembered the babushka who lived a few doors down. I’d seen her a couple of times, a small, hunched figure with deep lines on her face, always shuffling in and out of her apartment. She never said much, but I figured it wouldn’t hurt to ask. Just a little cooking oil, nothing more.

I knocked on her door, hoping she’d answer quickly. The hallway felt colder than usual that day.

The door opened, but only just. The chain stayed hooked, and the babushka peered through the small gap. Her eyes were pale, milky, like she hadn’t slept in days.

“Do you have any cooking oil?” I asked, trying to smile, but something about her face stopped me cold.

She stared at me for a moment, her gaze flicking past me to the hallway, like she was checking for something. Her mouth opened slightly, then closed, and I thought she might be confused by the question.

“You shouldn’t trust them,” she said, her voice low, almost a rasp.

I blinked. “What?”

She didn’t elaborate. Her eyes stayed locked on mine, sharp and cold. “The neighbors. Don’t trust them. Don’t get close.”

Before I could ask her what she meant, she slammed the door shut, the chain rattling against the frame.

I stood there, frozen, my question about cooking oil forgotten. The words echoed in my head: Don’t trust them.

I turned slowly, glancing down the empty hallway. The doors were all closed, the silence oppressive. I wasn’t sure what she meant, but something about the way she said it sent a shiver down my spine. I didn’t knock on her door again after that.

The next few weeks passed without much incident, but something felt off. I couldn’t put my finger on it, but there was a strange feeling that lingered, like the air in the building had changed. It wasn’t anything I could explain, but there were small things, subtle things.

The apartment, for one, had started to feel colder. The radiator clanged and hissed like always, but the heat never seemed to reach me. I noticed small cracks appearing along the walls, just thin lines at first, barely noticeable, but they spread quickly, like veins crawling across the plaster.

And then there were the bugs.

It started with one cockroach skittering across the kitchen floor. I thought nothing of it at first, just a nuisance, something I could deal with. But then, more appeared. They crawled from the cracks in the walls, their shiny bodies slipping out in the dead of night, disappearing just as quickly.

I hated them. They made my skin crawl. I told myself it was just an old building, and old buildings had pests. But as the days went on, they seemed to multiply, no matter how much I cleaned. No matter how hard I tried to block the cracks, they kept coming.

One night, the sound of scratching woke me. I sat up, heart pounding, straining to hear it again. It was faint but persistent, like something was moving inside the walls. I threw off the covers and crept toward the noise, barefoot, my breath catching in my throat.

The wall next to my bed, the one with the longest crack, was trembling. I stepped closer, leaning in, and the scratching grew louder, more frantic, like something was trying to get out.

And then, without warning, a single crack widened. A wave of black bugs spilled out, flooding across the floor, scurrying over my feet. I stumbled back with a scream, brushing them off, my skin crawling as they scattered into the shadows.

My heart raced as I grabbed my phone, ready to call someone... anyone. But as I looked around, the apartment was still. The bugs had disappeared into the cracks again, leaving no trace behind. Only the silence remained. I didin't sleep that night ..

The morning after, I knew I couldn’t leave the cracks as they were. No one could sleep with the thought of insects slipping through those gaps. I grabbed my coat and headed out into the icy streets, determined to fix the problem.

The hardware store was a short walk, but the cold bit into me harder than usual. As I browsed the aisles, I grabbed some plaster and sealant, just enough to patch up the cracks and hopefully put my mind at ease. I didn’t want to deal with those bugs again.

Back at the apartment, I set to work. The cracks weren’t large, but they were everywhere, snaking along the walls in long, jagged lines. I plastered over them, smoothing out the gaps as best I could. I didn’t care if it was temporary. I just wanted to stop the bugs from getting in. When I finished, I stood back, eyeing the freshly patched walls. It looked better, cleaner even.

But that sense of unease didn’t go away.

I sprayed the corners with bug spray, just in case, and spent the rest of the day trying not to think about it. For a while, the apartment felt normal again, and I convinced myself that maybe I’d gotten it under control.

That night, as I lay in bed, I heard the first creak.

It wasn’t anything unusual at first, just the typical groaning of an old building. But then there was another sound, something softer, like a shuffle of feet or a door opening. I sat up, listening carefully.

The sound was faint, but it was coming from the hallway outside my apartment. I crept toward the door, pressing my ear against the wood. For a long moment, there was nothing. Then, a low murmur, voices.

I opened the door a crack, peering into the dim hallway. Two of my neighbors stood at the far end, near the stairwell. They were talking quietly, too quietly for me to make out their words. It wasn’t unusual to see people here, but something about the way they were standing, huddled together in the shadows, made my skin crawl.

I was about to close the door when one of them turned sharply, his gaze locking onto mine. I froze. He didn’t say anything, just stared at me for a long, uncomfortable moment before nudging the other person. They both disappeared down the stairs without a word.

I closed the door, heart racing, trying to shake off the encounter. People here were strange, sure, but I didn’t think much of it until the next day, when I realized the two neighbors hadn’t returned.

Their apartment door stayed closed, the lights off, and for the next few days, I didn’t see or hear them at all. No footsteps, no voices. Nothing. It was like they’d vanished.

A week later, I saw the babushka again.

I hadn’t spoken to her since she’d warned me about the neighbors, and I wasn’t eager to bring it up. But that day, as I walked past her apartment, the door opened a crack. Her pale, milky eyes peered through the gap, her expression unreadable.

“You’re still here,” she said, her voice hoarse.

I paused, unsure of what to say. “Yeah...”

She glanced around the hallway, then back at me, lowering her voice. “Have you seen them? The ones who leave.”

I hesitated. “What do you mean?”

She sighed, shaking her head. “They don’t leave. Not really.”

A chill ran down my spine. “What are you talking about?”

“They disappear. One by one.” She coughed, the sound rough and wet.

Her words made my stomach churn, but before I could ask more, she closed the door with a soft click. I stood there for a moment, trying to process what she’d said, but it didn’t make sense. People left all the time, didn’t they? It was just a strange, old woman’s paranoia.

At least, that’s what I told myself.

The next day, I noticed something else.

One of the doors down the hall, the apartment where I’d seen the neighbors last, was slightly ajar. Just a crack. No light came from inside, and the air around it felt colder than usual. I hadn’t seen anyone come or go from that apartment in days, and I wasn’t sure anyone still lived there.

I stared at the door for a long time, debating whether to knock or walk away. But something held me back, an odd feeling, like the air itself was warning me to stay away. I backed off, heading quickly for the stairs. As I descended, I glanced over my shoulder, and for a split second, I thought I saw movement through the crack in the door.

Something, or someone, was watching.

Over the next few nights, the building seemed to grow more restless. The cold became unbearable, seeping through the walls despite the heat blasting from the radiator. The lights flickered constantly, plunging the hallway into darkness at odd intervals. And the noises... they were getting louder.

Every night, I heard them: scratching, shuffling, always just outside my apartment door. I couldn’t tell if it was the building settling, the neighbors, or something else entirely, but it never stopped. I barely slept, the sound gnawing at my nerves.

I patched up the cracks again, but no matter how many times I did, they always came back, deeper and wider. And it wasn’t just the cracks. The walls themselves seemed wrong. It felt like they were shifting when I wasn’t looking, moving just out of the corner of my eye.

It was late, somewhere around 2 a.m., when I woke with the need to go to the bathroom. The apartment was quiet, save for the faint hum of the radiator in the corner. I tossed off the covers, still groggy from sleep, and padded toward the bathroom, rubbing my eyes.

When I flipped the bathroom light on, something caught my eye just above the sink. A crack. A new one. Long and jagged, snaking through the wall like a scar that had just appeared overnight.

I frowned, stepping closer. The cracks were spreading faster now. I had noticed a few new ones the week before, but this one felt different. Larger. More menacing.

Then, from the corner of my eye, I saw movement.

A bug, small and black, its shiny body slipping through the crack. I flinched, backing away from the sink. The bug scuttled across the tiles, disappearing into the corner. I stood there, heart pounding, watching as more bugs started to emerge from the crack.

I couldn’t take it anymore.

I turned and hurried out of the bathroom, only to stop dead in my tracks.

In the bedroom, more bugs were spilling from the walls. They crawled through the cracks, pouring onto the floor, their bodies shining in the faint light from the window. There were too many. Dozens, maybe hundreds, scurrying along the walls, slipping under the bed.

Panic rose in my chest. I couldn’t stay here. Not with the walls crawling with insects.

I grabbed my jacket and shoes, pulling them on as fast as I could. My hands shook as I stuffed my phone into my pocket and darted for the door. I had to get out. I couldn’t stay in that apartment any longer.

The hallway felt colder than usual. The dim light overhead flickered weakly, casting long, wavering shadows along the floor. My breath came out in short bursts, clouding the air in front of me as I slammed the door behind me. For a moment, I stood there, heart pounding, trying to catch my breath.

Then, I heard it.

A sound, soft, almost imperceptible at first, like the faint rustling of paper. But it wasn’t paper. It was coming from further down the hallway, from behind one of the apartment doors.

I froze, straining to listen, the sound growing louder with each passing second. My pulse quickened. It wasn’t just rustling now. There was scratching, like tiny claws dragging themselves against the wood.

I turned slowly, my eyes narrowing as I squinted at the darkened doorway ahead. The air felt too still, too thick. Every hair on the back of my neck stood on end. The scratching intensified, becoming frantic, like something was desperately trying to claw its way out.

The door creaked.

It was subtle at first, a soft moan of hinges under strain, but then it grew louder. A slow, deliberate groan that made my blood run cold. My heart pounded in my ears as the door opened inch by inch, revealing nothing but a yawning black void inside.

I stared into that darkness, frozen in place. The air seemed to shift, a strange scent, damp and earthy, wafting toward me from the open door. And then, in the silence, something moved.

A rat emerged...

It slipped from the shadows, its slick, gray body catching the flickering light as it scurried forward. Then another. And another.

In a heartbeat, they were pouring out of the apartment, dozens of them, maybe more. Their bodies writhed together, claws scraping against the floor, their small, beady eyes glinting in the half-light. The sound of their feet, thousands of tiny nails on wood, was deafening.

I wanted to move, but my legs wouldn’t obey. I stood there, paralyzed, watching as the mass of rats surged toward me like a living tide.

And then instinct kicked in.

I ran, my shoes slamming against the floor as I tore down the hallway. The sound of squeaking and scratching exploded behind me, the rats following close. They moved fast, too fast. I could hear them, just inches away..

The hallway seemed to stretch out in front of me, endless and dark. The air felt thick and suffocating, my lungs burning with every ragged breath I took. I could hear my heart pounding in my ears, mixing with the high-pitched squeals of the rats, a cacophony of terror closing in on me.

I turned the corner, nearly losing my balance as I stumbled into the stairwell. I grabbed the railing, half-jumping, half-falling down the stairs. My foot slipped on the last step, and I crashed into the wall with a dull thud, pain shooting through my arm.

But there was no time to think. The rats were still coming.

I threw myself forward, running toward the basement door. It felt impossibly far away, my legs shaking, my vision tunneling as panic flooded my system. The squealing was deafening now, the swarm of rats almost on top of me.

The basement. I had to reach the basement.

I lunged for the door, slamming into it with my shoulder, my fingers scrabbling at the cold metal handle. The door creaked open, and I stumbled inside, collapsing against the floor. I kicked it shut behind me, the echo of the slam reverberating through the basement as I lay there, gasping for air.

I pressed my back against the door, my body trembling with adrenaline. For a moment, there was nothing but the sound of my own breath, heavy and ragged, filling the stillness. But outside, on the other side of the door, I could still hear them. The scratching. The frantic scraping of tiny claws.

The rats weren’t done.

The basement was like stepping into another world. Cold, damp, and suffocatingly dark. The chill hit me immediately, sinking into my bones, and I could feel the moisture clinging to my skin. Every breath I took fogged in front of me, hanging in the air like ghostly wisps. But there was no time to think, no time to adjust.

My fingers trembled as I fumbled with my phone, switching on the flashlight. The beam sputtered to life, casting a weak, flickering light through the gloom. It barely cut through the darkness, like the shadows themselves were swallowing it. The staircase ahead descended into the void, each step disappearing into the black.

I had no choice. I had to move. I had to get away from the rats.

The stairs groaned beneath me as I took the first step, a deep, echoing creak that reverberated through the empty space. My heart pounded harder with each step, the sound of my own breath loud in my ears. The air down here felt thick, almost too thick, like trying to breathe through a damp cloth. It was different from the cold upstairs. It was oppressive, like something was bearing down on me, pushing in from all sides. And then there was the smell, metallic and sharp, almost like blood.

The further I went, the worse it became.

My foot hit the bottom of the stairs, and for a brief second, I paused. I could feel something, a vibration, faint but unmistakable, thrumming through the floor beneath me.

Then I heard it.

A faint thump. Low and rhythmic. Steady.

I swallowed hard, trying to calm my nerves. But the sound only grew louder, its pulsing beat reverberating through the walls, the floor, the very air around me. I could feel it inside me now, an eerie, rhythmic drumming that seemed to echo my own heartbeat.

Each beat felt heavier than the last, pulling me further into the basement, dragging me toward something I didn’t want to face. My flashlight swept across the room in front of me, illuminating more of the basement. The shadows danced and shifted, playing tricks on my eyes, but then... I saw it.

In the center of the basement, suspended from the ceiling, was something out of a nightmare: a massive, grotesque heart. It hung there, pulsing slowly, its slick surface glistening with moisture. Thick, blackened veins snaked out from the heart, creeping up the walls like twisted arteries. They spread through the cracks, disappearing into the structure of the building as if the entire place was feeding off it.

Each beat sent a ripple through the room, the veins tightening and contracting as if they were pumping something through the walls. My stomach churned at the sight, a wave of nausea washing over me. I stumbled backward, my mind screaming at me to run, to get out. But my legs felt rooted to the spot.

What was this? How could this be real?

The air grew colder, the heart’s beat more insistent.

I could feel it drawing me in, the slow, steady thrum filling my chest, suffocating me. My thoughts spun, panic rising. I had to leave. Now. I turned, ready to bolt for the stairs.

But before I could move, something clamped down on my shoulder.

I screamed, whipping around, the flashlight’s beam swinging wildly. There he was, one of my neighbors. His face was ghostly pale, eyes sunken deep into his skull. What scared me most was the eerie calm in his expression. His grip tightened on my shoulder, firm and unyielding.

“The building needs a sacrifice,” he said, his voice low and emotionless, as though he was reciting something rehearsed. “It has to feed.”

His grip on me tightened as he spoke again, his voice a harsh whisper, “We all have to feed it. It’s the only way to survive.”

I struggled frantically, panic surging through my veins. I twisted my body, driving my elbow into his side. He grunted, loosening his grip just enough for me to tear myself free. I stumbled backward, gasping for air. But he wasn’t finished. He rushed toward me, his eyes now wild with desperation.

I shoved him with all the strength I could muster.

He staggered back, his foot catching on a pipe behind him. He lost his balance, and with a sickening crack, his head collided with the rusted metal. He crumpled to the ground, motionless.

For a moment, everything was still. I stood there, my breath coming in ragged gasps, staring at his unmoving body. My mind raced, trying to process what had just happened. But there was no time. The ground beneath my feet trembled.

The basement shuddered.

The cracks in the walls widened, spiderwebbing outward. From within those cracks, something began to pour out: rats. Hundreds of them, their slick bodies writhing as they squeezed through the gaps..

I bolted for the stairs, my legs burning as I ran. When I reached the basement door, my heart sank. It wouldn’t budge.

I yanked at the handle, pounded on the door with my fists, screaming for help. My voice echoed in the empty space, but the door didn’t move.

The rats were coming. I could hear them now, their squeaks filling the air, the sound of their bodies writhing together growing louder. Closer.

I turned and saw them, just a few feet away, their beady eyes glinting in the dim light. They swarmed toward me, a living tide of filth and hunger.

I screamed again, pounding on the door, begging for it to open. I was out of time. The rats were right there.

Just as I was about to give up, the door swung open.

Standing in the doorway was the babushka, her eyes hard and determined. Without a word, she grabbed my arm and yanked me through the doorway. She slammed the door shut behind us, locking it with a swift turn of the key. The rats crashed into the door a second later, their squeals muffled by the thick wood.

“Run and never look back,” she said, her voice cold but steady.

I didn’t need to be told twice. I ran. My legs moved on instinct, fueled by a raw, primal need to survive. I tore through the hallway, my breath ragged, the cold air burning my lungs. But as I ran, a sinking realization clawed at the back of my mind.

I was leaving everything behind.

Everything I owned, everything that had ever mattered to me, was still in that apartment. My whole life, the pieces of who I was, now trapped within those cursed walls. My childhood photos, the ones I had kept in a box under my bed, the ones of my parents when they were still alive. The framed picture of my graduation that had always sat on the shelf. Memories of moments that shaped me, all left behind.

Each object was a piece of me. Together, they were my past, my history, the things that tied me to the life I had lived before. A life I would never get back.

The weight of it hit me like a punch to the chest. But I couldn’t stop. The building seemed to pulse behind me, angry, alive, as though it could reach out and pull me back in if I slowed down. If I hesitated for even a second.

The thought twisted inside me, making my heart ache, but survival came first. The need to live, to breathe, to escape swallowed every other emotion, leaving no room for regret. I had to leave it all behind. All those pieces of my life, all those memories, they couldn’t save me now.

I knew if I went back, if I tried to save even one thing, I wouldn’t make it out again.

I kept running, tears blurring my vision, knowing I would [never return.](https://www.reddit.com/u/HerScreams/s/sqHw64rZiJ)
