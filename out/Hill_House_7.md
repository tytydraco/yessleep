I am documenting what happened because I wanted this story to come out years ago and it was never released. I understand why. After everything I and others endured though, I need it to be out. The reason any of it even happened in the first place is my fault. I was the cause for all of us to be in that house. I write this to warn others to not make the same stupid mistake I made. This is not a dare for someone to find the house. I will not even say the state the house is in. If by some miracle you somehow do find it, *stay away*.

Let me explain. My name is James. Back in college, I was a commuter student. It was an hour drive up to the campus and an hour drive back home. I couldn’t afford on-campus housing and was very fortunate that my parents would let me stay with them. As much as spending hundreds of dollars a month on gas and missing out on making friends sucked, home cooked meals and a private bathroom made up for it more than enough. To get to campus, I had to drive over a bridge. About halfway through my junior year, there was an accident on that bridge. My GPS re-routed me to a path I had never taken before. Instead of my normal hour drive, it was upped to 3 hours. 

About 30 minutes into the drive, I noticed that I hadn’t passed *anything* for at least 15 minutes. No gas stations, no fast food restaurants, nothing. It was just a straight road and grass. At first, I thought I must have just zoned out while driving. That had happened to me a lot since I drove so much. On subsequent drives on the same route while paying attention, sure enough, I would never see anything. Not even another car. Around 2 hours in is when you would be taken back into civilization.

However, there was always one thing that I would pass. The house. It was hard not to notice. Not because it’s the only structure for miles but because of how it looked. It stood out like a sore thumb. For miles, all that could be seen was flat land. The house stood on a hill. The scenery leading up to it was lush greenery; as if Mother Nature herself had been looking after it. The house was grey and falling apart. On the right side of the house, there was a massive hole that bled into the roof. A hole so big that I could only imagine something the size of a meteor could have caused it. The house didn’t even have a driveway. It was like the ground surrounding the house had swallowed the driveway to let people know they were not welcome inside.

I asked my few friends on campus if they had ever seen or heard of the house. They had no clue what I was talking about, but they were intrigued. That weekend, I took them to visit it. Something that I noticed on that trip was the mailbox. I must have been driving past the house too fast to see it every other time. It was slanted and rusty. The only number left on the side was 7. We were all too scared to get too close to the house and made lame excuses like “It’s just too far of a walk and yesterday was leg day.” From there on out though, my friends and I took to calling it “Hill House 7”. We’d share horror stories on what happened inside. Some of my favorites were:

* A husband murdered his wife and ran off with the insurance money. The house still stands because her soul still dwells within its walls.
* Aliens crashed into the house and reside inside. They have learned to integrate themselves into society and live in the busted old house to avoid paying taxes.
* A serial killer tortures their victims in the basement. It’s the perfect place for a murderer. The house is far enough away from society so the screams won’t be heard, but close enough to society to work within it, make a living, and look for new subjects.

If I didn’t have to take the route that passed Hill House 7, I wouldn’t. It always gave me chills to look at or even think about. I never witnessed anything abnormal inside the house, but word spread around campus about the house. My friends were very extroverted people, so I assumed they were the ones to tell others. Stories much worse than the ones we came up with were told. Apparently one girl visited the house on a dare and was never seen again. I never fully believed anything I heard, but I was always curious. I told myself that one day, I would be man enough to enter the house. Years later, I did. I just wish I hadn’t.

After college, I got a job at a small, local news station. I had a Computer Science degree, so I felt upset with the position I was at in life. I felt that I deserved more. My mindset was that I should be working with dozens of geniuses every day. Instead, I was working in an apartment sized office with barely any employees. We definitely didn’t have the budget to bring on any other staff and the size of the building couldn’t handle any more people either. Sometimes it felt like we were canned sardines. If someone called in sick, we’d celebrate having some extra space instead of feeling sorry for them. The staff consisted of the owner (Mr. Yun), Glenn, Mark, Eddie, Jackson, Amanda, Marshall, and myself.

A few years into this job, I remember walking into Mr. Yun’s office to inform him that the toilets weren’t flushing again. He was at his desk with his face in his hands. When he heard his door creak open, his head was pulled up with a struggle as if there were a weight tied to his neck. His face had a look of distraught sewn onto it.

“Everything alright, sir?” I asked. He became stressed very easily. Honestly, sometimes it annoyed my younger self because it happened so often.

Mr. Yun gave a deep sigh then said, “Not exactly. The Halloween story I had planned to be shown is *way* more expensive than I thought. Halloween is in 2 days and we have nothing ready to go as a backup! I have no idea what to do.”

“Can we just take off on Halloween?” I responded.

“And upset the few advertisers we have left? No chance,” Mr. Yun placed his head back in his hands.

Suddenly, I remembered the house. The thought of it rushed to my head like an Olympic runner to a finish line. I pondered on whether I should mention it or not. My rationale to suggest it was that this could be my chance to finally enter it. Being paid to step inside was an added bonus. “I may have an idea,” I stated.

“And that is?” Mr. Yun mumbled through his hands.

“Hill House 7.” Saying its name aloud after all those years sent a shiver down my spine. “Back in college, I found an old, desecrated house. It looked like a professional haunted house or something you’d see out of a horror movie. Rumors of ghosts and spirits residing within the house circulated my campus. Maybe we could do a story on that?”

“You want me to give TV time to an old house?” Mr. Yun scoffed. “My wife is old. You want to give her TV time too?”

“I don’t mean that we find out how the house got into the state it's in. I meant that we record the inside of the house. There’s gotta be something spooky inside that we could spin into an interesting story.”

Mr. Yun sat in silence for a moment before looking up at me. “Do you have a photo of this house? I’m not going to pay the crew to drive to a normal looking suburban home.”

I pulled out my phone and began to scroll back. My phone’s storage had been begging me to put it down, but I was too sentimental to delete anything or download my pictures somewhere. What if I needed them someday? That day proved to me that I was right. After scrolling back a few years, I finally found a photo. I hadn’t seen the house for so long. Just seeing a picture of it shot me from a 26-year-old back into the shoes of my 19-year-old self.

Mr. Yun’s eyes glued to the photo. He didn’t move for a good 45 seconds. For a moment, I thought his constant stress had finally put him in a coma and that I’d have to pull my phone from the hands of a corpse. His head snapped up as he handed my phone back. When Mr. Yun wasn’t stressed, he spoke very matter-of-factly. The picture must have brought him some ease because he returned to his normal speaking pattern, “Take the van. Tell the rest of the crew that you all leave tomorrow. Buy some items from a Halloween store to fake some scares. If nothing happens while you’re there, you *make* something happen. Spend the night if you have too. Am I clear?”

“Yes, sir,” I responded. Honestly, I didn’t care what it took as long as I got the greenlight to visit the house on a paid trip. Faking some scares? Sounded easy enough to me. Definitely not my most difficult day on the job. In those days, I believed everything at the station wasn’t hard though. My impression of the station was that it was inefficient and would have been run better by me.

I left Mr. Yun’s office and gathered the crew. I explained to them that we’d be taking a field trip the next day. The house was 8 hours away from the station and we wanted to arrive when it was getting dark to maximize the creepiness factor. The plan was to leave at 12 PM the following day. When I got home from work, I was a bit ecstatic. So many years after seeing Hill House 7 for the first time and staring at it from afar, I would finally enter it. To think, my friends and I used to create stories about what happened inside. Seven years later, and I was going to do it again but *while* inside.

Waking up the next day, I shot out of bed, got dressed, and ran to a Halloween store nearby to purchase some Halloween decorations. It was pretty baron, but that was to be expected on the day before Halloween. I grabbed some fake spiderwebs, rubber spiders, plastic skeletons, an orb that you’d see a psychic use at a fair, and almost anything else that was left on the shelves. Nothing was too realistic, but with the right lighting, we could make a story out of it all. I threw it all into my car’s trunk and made my way to the station.

When I arrived, I saw Glenn packing the news van. Glenn was Mr. Yun’s son. He knew that the station wasn’t as profitable as it once was, so he always took very good care of the camera equipment. We couldn’t afford to buy any new equipment. The rust covering half the news logo on the van and a different colored door showed that to everyone on the road as it was driven around.

Glenn was barely 20-years-old and extremely kind. I always felt that innocent vibes emanated from him like an aroma from a flower. His sweetness was teased by Jackson. Jackson Todd was basically a high school bully that never grew up after graduation. I was reminded of this when I saw him trip Glenn as Glenn carried a box to the van.

Amanda was in the passenger seat looking at herself in the mirror. She witnessed the trip and said nothing as she put eyeliner on. Sometimes I swore she didn’t live in the same world as the rest of us.

Jackson helped Glenn to his feet and condescendingly said, “You gotta look where you’re walking, bud. This ground is uneven. It rises and falls all over the place! Be careful from now on, okay?”

“Y-Yeah. I will. Thanks,” Glenn spoke quietly as he checked the equipment inside the box.

Jackson was a Grade A douche and Amanda…Amanda just had a lot of personal issues. She’d carry a pocket mirror on her at all times and check her face at least once every 2 minutes. After her 30th birthday, she got *veeeeery* self conscious about her looks. Deep down I think she felt like with each passing year, she was worth less and less. She’d go on rants about how soon the station would replace her with someone younger. “The next young, hot thing” would take her job as news anchor, she would say. When other news stations were on in the office, she’d analyze every female anchor. She’d comment on how great their noses were, how plump their lips were, their freckles, and any other minute detail she found. Complaints about herself spewed from her mouth like a waterfall day after day. Her face was constantly covered in pounds of makeup. Every year after turning 30, more makeup would be added. At the time we were going to visit the house, she was 34-years-old. It’s a shame what she thought of herself. She was beautiful and a kind soul before her mind began to deceive her.

I parked my car next to Mark. Like everything else at the station, his car was cheap and poorly looked after. He didn’t care much for the upkeep of anything after his wife passed away. I saw him yelling at his son in the backseat. “What is his son doing here?” I wondered. What I did know was that I was not stepping in to ask him while he was shouting, so I grabbed the bag of Halloween decorations from my car and walked over to the van. Like normal, Eddie had arrived in a stained t-shirt that didn’t fit him. Half his belly button and the bottom of his hairy stomach poked out of the extra large shirt. Eddie didn’t have a tragic reason not to take care of himself like Mark. He was just disgusting. Some type of snack could always be found in his hand or nearby. That day it was a bag of Cheetos.

Glenn rushed over to help me with the bags I was carrying. Seven bags were strapped around my arms, shoulders, and neck. Back in the day, I was stubborn and too confident. Two trips to bring the groceries inside? I didn’t think so! I’d do everything in my power to make it only one. $18 for a cheeseburger at a restaurant for my girlfriend’s birthday? Too expensive! I told her I would make one at home and had full confidence that my cooking would surpass the chefs with actual schooling and experience.

Jackson smoked a cigarette and watched as Glenn and I packed everything into the van. By the time we were done, Mark was walking over to us with his son. I heard Jackson exclaim, “What’s up with the kid?”

“It’s hard to find a babysitter on such short notice! Maybe if we had known about this trip *a week ago* then I could have found someone to watch him!” Mark responded. He sounded more annoyed than usual.

“He’s so small. How old is he? Like…4-years-old?” Jackson questioned as if he had never seen a child before.

“Travis is 8-years-old and he’s not going to be a bother. Right?” Mark stared down at Travis with intensity and spoke through gritted teeth.

While staring at the ground, Travis whispered, “I won’t be.”

Mark looked back up to the group and said,  “Just think of today as a ‘Bring Your Kid to Work’ day. Okay? Okay. Let’s head out.”

We couldn’t yet though. Marshall still hadn’t arrived. That was to be expected. He never arrived anywhere on time. If you wanted him somewhere at 6:30 PM, you’d have to tell him 6 PM. One day he was two hours late to work. Obviously, Mr. Yun was not very pleased. What could he do though? If he fired Marshall, he’d have to find someone else willing to work for as low of a pay as Marshall had. I heard that the minimum wage was shifted up a few dollars and Marshall’s paycheck didn’t budge. There was not a care in the world for Marshall. No rush or incentive to do…anything.

We sat around waiting for him for a little over 45 minutes. He pulled in and parked in a handicap spot. Opening his car door released a cloud of smoke. The smoke fled from his car and rose into the air as he stepped out coughing. The stench protruding from Marshall was awful. I could practically see stench lines coming off of him like he was a cartoon character.

“What’s up, y’all?” Marshall asked while lifting up his sagging jeans.

“Not your pants, I’ll tell you that!” Eddie put his orange stained hand up expecting a high five. Upon realizing that no one was going to take him up on that offer, he lowered his hand back into his bag of Cheetos.

With everyone being present, we could finally head out. It was a long, awkward drive. If you think working in a confined space with people you don’t know is weird, try an 8 hour car ride. Glenn drove since it was father’s van, Amanda stayed in her position of “Passenger Princess”, and I was stuck with everyone else in the back. There were a lot of long moments of silence. Occasionally, a conversation would strike up but would die out fast. This intensified the quiet. The dead space felt constricting at times.

A few times, Glenn would run over a pothole and mess up Amanda’s makeup process. She was not pleased and slowly became vocal about it. This would prompt Jackson to make remarks like, “If you don’t like your seat up there, I have a spot for you to sit on back here.” You couldn’t tell him to stop or you’d only egg him on. Then he’d say increasingly worse things. At one point, I told him to watch what he was saying since a kid was around. Jackson proceeded to say every swear word in existence for the next 5 minutes.

The drive was terrible, but nothing could stop my excitement of returning to Hill House 7. When we finally did arrive, it was exactly as I remembered it from all those years ago. The pit I had in my stomach returned like it was the first time I had ever seen the house. The difference was, this time I had a newfound burst of energy and I was going to enter inside.

“There’s…There’s no driveway. What way do I drive?” Glenn asked as he pulled the car onto the side of the road.

“Just park it here. That’s what my friends and I used to do,” I responded.

“Won’t I get a ticket? I can’t come back to my dad with a ticket on the company van!”

Jackson chimed in, “You won’t get a ticket. You’re going to go to jail. Don’t worry, Amanda. I’ll drive you home.”

“Plenty of cars do it! You’ll be fine,” I quickly retorted. I really had seen many cars parked on the side of the road as I commuted to and from campus.

A mix of feeling questioned, my eagerness to look inside, and the desire to get out of the back of the van all led to me coming off annoyed. Honestly, I was. The car ride and Jackson’s comments certainly didn’t help with that.

Glenn put the car into park and took the key out of the ignition. I burst through the backdoors of the van. Air had never felt so crisp and refreshing before. Outside it was dark, but the house illuminated itself to me like a beacon. How a lighthouse makes itself known to unsuspecting ships. There was no physical light coming from the house, so maybe it was actually trying to repel me away from danger. The same as the true purpose of lighthouses is to keep ships from crashing into it and nearby hazards.

There were seven bags and eight of us. Mark wanted Travis to grab a bag so he’d “carry his weight on this trip.” The bag was half the kid’s height and he struggled to even lift it. Glenn silently walked over to Travis, knelt down, smiled, and took the bag from him with his open hand. Everyone walked towards the house while Mark and Travis stayed in the back of the group. Mark was whispering, but I could make out phrases like “Don’t embarrass me like that again.”

The walk to the house felt longer than it used to be. Originally, I believed it must have been something to do with age. Maybe my stamina had just decreased? It *was* an uphill walk. Looking back…I’m not so sure that was the case.

Arriving at the porch, we found that the door was already open. Amanda, Eddie, and Travis were ready to turn back around right then and there. I was too involved with this to leave, Jackson had a tough guy persona he had to uphold, and Mark and Marshall didn’t really care either way.

Amanda was the first to speak, “This place is stressing me out. Stress creates wrinkles and I have an image to maintain! Let’s leave.”

“Sweetheart, I’ll protect you from the monsters that lurk around all corners inside. Don’t worry!” Jackson exclaimed as he wrapped his arm around Amanda. She swiftly swatted it off like it was a mosquito.

“You really want to miss the opportunity to be on camera for a potentially popular story?” I asked. It was manipulative of me to use something she was self conscious about against her. Back then, I didn’t really care. I needed them all to stay and didn’t care what they thought about it all. I’m sorry to everyone. I am.

“Out of my way!” Amanda shoved everyone aside and walked in.

We all followed. The foyer was essentially empty. It had stairs, with boards which were most likely unsafe to walk on, that led to the second floor. The center of the room had a damp carpet littered with rips, holes, and weird stains. From the foyer, the house branched off into three rooms. Walking straight from the front door and past the stairs would take you to a full bath. A few of the corners of the bathroom had mold but the wallpaper was a nice shade of yellow. Rust surrounded the faucets of the sink and bathtub. As a joke, I turned the knobs to the sink. A loud rumbling sound emanated from the pipes below the sink before a rush of water flowed from the faucet. We were all genuinely surprised. Not only did the sink have running water but the bathtub did as well. The toilet refused to flush then proceeded to gift us with the sight of watching a rat crawl up through the hole of the toilet bowl.

The room on the right of the foyer took you into the living room. This is the room where the meteor sized hole resided. Large puddles of water glistened in the moonlight near where I presumed a window used to be. The couch was flipped onto its back. The cushions were torn up and the bottom of the couch had a spray painted word scrawled onto it. The writing was sloppy, but I was able to make out the word *CHANGE*. I had no clue what this meant at the time and could only think about how much this house had changed from its original inception. Multiple families must have lived here over the years and called it home. A once loved home which now looked like it was begging to be put out of its misery after decades of neglect.

Taking a left at the foyer led you into the kitchen. Cabinet doors covered parts of the floor. A few were covered in scratches. I remember thinking that this place must have been a hotspot for stray cats and homeless people. Above the oven, the wall was charred. Like someone had chosen to set fire and scorch only one part of the house. The kitchen table stood at a slant near the window. One of its legs was off.

“Who would take off a single table leg?” Glenn asked me.

“I don’t know. I know where they put it though.” I motioned over to the kitchen sink. The table leg was poking out of the wall. Upon a closer look, someone had scratched *Lustful* into the leg and the end was sharpened.

“People sure are weird, right?” Glenn looked to me for an answer.

“Y-Yeah.” I responded. Years of desiring to come inside and it was weirder than my friends and I ever imagined. It was oddly enthralling to me at the time.

Marshall walked into the kitchen and caught us staring at the table leg. “That’s a big splinter! Watch out, y’all!”

It was a terrible joke, but his stereotypical “surfer boy” accent got a chuckle out of Glenn and I. Marshall was certainly lazy, but he was also definitely funny. If he got you to laugh, the comedian in him wanted to keep the ball rolling with more and more jokes that built off the original one. He followed up with, “You know, when I was young, I once got a terrible splinter in my finger at school. It felt the size of that table leg. I was so scared to go to the nurse’s office because the last time I had a splinter, she had me pluck it out myself.”

“Were you able to do it?” Glenn interrupted with an odd sense of interest.

“Not a chance! I just cried until my mom showed up and did it for me. All of this is to say, I didn’t go to the nurse’s office to get this splinter out, right? Eventually, white puss starts to come out of it. While I’m at lunch one day, my buddy asks what was on my finger. I told him what any responsible kid would…that it was cream from an Oreo.”

“No you did not!” I said through laughter.

“I did! I did!” Marshall proclaimed. “That’s not even the craziest part. He asks me if he can have some, so I let him lick it off my finger.”

“That’s disgusting! There’s no way your friend did that,” Glenn chuckled.

“We were in the third grade. We did basically anything that our friends said. If you think that’s bad, wait until I tell you about the time we found a snake on the playgro-” Marshall was cut off by heavy thumping sounds coming down the stairs.

“What was that?” Glenn stepped closer to me.

“Jackson went to look at the second floor. He must be coming back down,” Marshall answered.

All three of us walked back into the foyer and found Jackson trying to pull his foot out of a hole in the bottom stair. He yelled out, “Upstairs *sucks*! Every room in this house is trashed and having no power is growing old already. I would have seen this stupid hole if we had lights instead of these bargain bin flashlights! Let’s record and get out of here!”

Jackson was heated, but he was right. The group came to record a segment for Mr. Yun, not to just explore. *I* was there to explore, but they didn’t know that. Glenn walked over to his box of camera equipment and began to distribute GoPros to everyone. Travis didn’t receive one, but you can’t pack a GoPro for someone you weren’t expecting to come. Glenn could tell Travis felt left out, so Glenn let him hold his while he explained the GoPros to the group.

“The cameras are attached to a harness. You put on the harness, press the power button on the side, and they’ll start to record! Also attached to the harness is a flashlight stronger than the ones we had lying around in the van. Everyone got it?”

“Where’s my normal camera? These are so small,” Eddie gave the camera a look of perplexion.

“Is the camera small or are you just really big?” Jackson mumbled.

Glenn ignored Jackson, “These are all we got. My dad was afraid we’d break the actual cameras if he wasn’t here to supervise us. We only have seven GoPros in total so don’t screw around with them.”

“We had ten. What happened to the other three?” Marshall asked.

“We’ve only ever had seven,” Glenn nervously insisted.

I interrupted a potential argument with, “Marshall, I’ll take your side if you can tell me what today's date is.”

Marshall paused and stared at the ceiling. He answered, “Touché.”

Glenn flashed me a look of *Thank You* before we all set off to set up different decorations around the house. The idea was simple. Our anchors (Amanda and Jackson) would say they are here to investigate a house that was reportedly haunted. When we got back to the studio, a crazy backstory for the house would be invented for a voiceover that’d play over multiple stills of the house. Amanda and Jackson would ‘explore the house for the first time’ and encounter different spooky events set up with the decorations. Everyone else would be in different rooms to capture various angles.

We shot footage for about an hour. Honestly, it came out better than everyone expected. The GoPros made it look similar to a found footage horror film. A low budget one, but one nonetheless. The darkness of the house covered a lot of imperfections with the Halloween decorations. Even rubber spiders with googly eyes came off as real. Amanda was not a fan of that. We discovered spiders were one of her biggest fears. Jackson used this for his own amusement when he chased her around with a fake one. He giggled at her shrieks of terror. Later in the night, Eddie swore he saw one of the rubber spiders move…Maybe it did.

After shooting wrapped, everyone was exhausted. It was a little past 9 PM and the drive back would have us return at roughly 5 AM. The whole plan of us coming here was so rushed that no one considered what we’d do after recording. We couldn’t just drive back, all of us were too tired. I knew for a fact that there weren’t any hotels around for hours either. None of us knew what to do. That’s when an idea crept from the abyss of my mind. *What if we just slept here for the night?*

The idea was crazy and certainly would be a tough sell, but I wanted to explore the second floor more and see if the house had a basement. I did not take an awkward 8 hour drive to *not* get everything out of Hill House 7. There wasn’t an easy way to suggest the idea, so I blurted it out. Ripped the bandaid right off. “What if we slept here tonight?”

Their chattering was immediately halted to a silence. My words acted as an assassin of conversation. Those few seconds of quiet became ages. I felt compelled to explain, but I couldn’t let them know why I truly wanted to stay. They’d think of me as selfish, which I was, but I didn’t want them to know that. 

“I know it doesn’t sound like a great suggestion at first. What else are we going to do though? If any of us try to drive, we will most likely end up in an accident due to exhaustion. This place isn’t so bad. There’s still some mattresses upstairs we could use. The couch is an option if we flip it upright and find the cushions. It’s one night. We can make it work for one night.”

The group remained silent as they thought over my words. Glenn was the first one to speak up, “I can’t wreck the van or my dad will kill me. One night can’t be so bad…right?”

Reluctantly, everyone else began to agree. Eddie voiced a concern that was shared by Travis. They were both scared to sleep alone. All of us went up to the second floor, grabbed the mattresses, and brought them back downstairs. We set the mattresses next to each other in a square shape in the center of the foyer. I was the first to remove my GoPro harness and hand it back to Glenn. Glenn didn’t accept it.

“Everyone can hold onto their GoPro for the night, so you have a flashlight in case you need to use the bathroom in the middle of the night. Please just be careful with them,” Glenn explained.

Most of us thanked Glenn before laying down to fall asleep.

From here, this is where everything went downhill. Each one of us experienced something different. To make this as coherent as possible, I am going to explain what happened to each one of us individually based on what I witnessed in the GoPro footage. First, I will start with Eddie.

His footage starts out in darkness. A few seconds in, Eddie whispered, “What was that?” He proceeded to click the flashlight on and attach the GoPro harness back on. The camera turned to show that the kitchen door was closed. This stuck out because I am *certain* that we left every door open out of fear of something hiding from us.

Light peaked out from underneath the kitchen door. Eddie tried shaking Marshall awake to no success. “What…What’s that smell?” Eddie asked himself. He stood up and crept toward the kitchen. His large hand surrounded the doorknob and slowly turned it. The door opened with a loud creaking sound.

Eddie stepped inside and found a wrapped up chocolate on the floor. There was a moment of hesitation before he bent over, picked it up, and inspected it. “I haven’t seen this brand since I was a kid. Mom used to buy these for me all the time.” The wrapper crinkled as he opened it. His chewing was reminiscent of a pig. Each smack of his lips made it sound like he was out of breath but was always followed by a sigh of delight. While licking his fingers, he turned to find a trail of the chocolates leading to the fridge.

Eddie looked around before following the trail and picking up each chocolate along the way. He stepped up to the fridge door and found that it was ajar. Not only was it open, it seemed that it was slowly turning open by itself. Eddie assisted the door in its mission to open.

We didn’t check inside the fridge when we investigated the house because we thought there was no use. Eddie was the first to see inside of it. The outside of the fridge was banged up. The inside looked brand new. On the middle shelf sat a bowl of spaghetti and meatballs. Steam was rising from the bowl like it was freshly made. Eddie reached inside and grabbed it.

He placed it on the kitchen counter and just stared at it for several minutes. The silence of the house was broken when he said aloud, “How is this possible? No one has made the meatballs look like this since…since…Mom.” The meatballs all had a circular indent carved inside of them. They reminded me of the Death Star.

His hand reached out and grabbed a meatball. Hesitantly, almost out of fear, Eddie raised the meatball to his mouth and began to chew it. A female voice whispered from behind him, “Good boy.”

Eddie fell to the floor and the footage went black for an hour. 11 minutes in, sounds of a chair scraping along the floor bursted through. 23 minutes later, pots and pans clanging began. 8 minutes later and a knife could be heard chopping. Roughly 18 minutes passed before Eddie awoke and sat up. He was still in the kitchen but now he was at the kitchen table. The kitchen table stood up straight. I wondered how the table was fixed.

The only light in the room was from the bulb that hung above the table. The rest of the kitchen was engulfed by darkness. Eddie began to pant like he was struggling to move. I sat and watched for 2 minutes of Eddie seeming to try and move but to no avail. The same female voice outside of the camera’s view screamed out, “IT’S FEEDING TIME!” The voice was deep and oddly…loving. Like it cared that it was ‘feeding time.’

Eddie’s shaking began to become quicker, more desperate. Suddenly, a pale, skinny arm slowly came into frame. The skin looked like paper mache with some of it scrunching up or peeling off. In its wrinkled hand, it held a rusty spoon containing a substance I don’t even know how to describe. It was red, yet green and brown. Liquid dripped off the spoon but the ‘food’ was solid.

The voice scolded, “What did I say about electronics at the table!? This just will not do.”

The hand sped out of frame. *Click!* The harness holding the camera and flashlight were detached from Eddie then carefully placed on the kitchen table in front of him. Now, I was able to see everything. Eddie was tied to a large highchair. Around his neck sat a bib that read *Momma’s Baby Boy*.

The spoon peaked through the curtain of black that surrounded Eddie. The same arm brought the mush back to Eddie’s mouth. Eddie moved his head away and whimpered out, “P-Please…Please let me go.”

The female voice seemed concerned, “Not hungry? You used to love this stuff.”

Eddie began to tear up. “I don’t know what’s going on or who you are. Please let me go home. I’m begging you.”

The voice continued to ignore his pleas, “I spent so long making this meal…and…and you *REFUSE* to eat it!?”

“HELP! HEEEELP!”

“Mommy did not starve herself to allow you to eat…for you to NOT EAT!”

The monster, whom I refer to as *Mother*, whipped her left hand onto Eddie’s jaw. Both of her arms were long and had the appearance of fragility, but they had a true strength to them. Her fingers latched onto the sides of Eddie’s jaw like a monkey wrench to a bolt. It squeezed on tight and pulled so hard that it elongated Eddie’s face. All that Eddie could do was cry and give screams of agony as his face was morphed and stretched into something unrecognizable. 

Mother’s fingers were rotting. A flap of skin fell into Eddie’s mouth and sat just below his tongue. He whimpered as it disintegrated in his mouth due to the buildup of saliva that had formed. The pool of saliva rose and rose before it began to steadily leak out of the corners of his mouth.

Mother hovered the spoon inside of Eddie’s mouth. She flipped the spoon and plopped the ‘food’ onto his tongue. Using her grip on his jaw, she moved her hand up and down to force Eddie to chew. Eddie gave a painful expression as he swallowed. His face looked as if he swallowed broken glass and rusted nails. “It’s good, right?” Mother asked with, from what I could tell, sincerity.

She released his jaw and revealed her face. Her neck elongated and slithered like a snake as her head came out of the darkness. The head was *enormous*. The best description I could give to its size is for you to imagine the height and width of a ferris wheel but from the perspective of an ant. The skin covering her face drooped like melting wax. Any move of her neck caused a wave of skin to ripple across the rest of her face. Her hair was sparse and what little remained constantly fell out like a shedding dog. Her eye sockets were craters with bulging veins that never stopped moving. The blood flowed through her veins with the movement pattern of a slug. Odd thing was, her actual eyes were tiny. The eyes looked like small buttons placed inside of a bowl. That didn’t make her glare any less intense though. I could feel it through the screen, so I cannot imagine what Eddie was feeling in person. Her lips cracked with the appearance of broken ceramic every time she spoke, but her teeth looked perfect.

The neck twisted and turned until it got Mother’s head beside Eddie’s ear. She whispered, “You seem so stressed. Normally when you’re stressed, you eat.” Her voice began to rise, “You damn near eat us out of house and home!” Mother chuckled to herself.

She wrapped her neck around the front of Eddie to speak in his other ear, “I don’t get it. I just don’t get it. I starve myself, so you can eat more. And yet…after I spend an hour of MY TIME to make YOU a home cooked meal…you refuse. You act like you don’t like it when I’ve watched you eat pizza with syrup on it. You’ll eat *anything*! So why not my cooking? Is…Is it me?”

Large tears began to stream from Mother’s face. She turned away from Eddie. His jaw hung like a damp towel in the wind as he attempted to say, “N-No. It’s not…not you!”

Mother went silent. The last of her tears *BOOMED* on the floor. “You’re right…It’s not me. It’s *YOU*! You’re ungrateful! Ungrateful of my time and effort! I’ve been working 10 hour shifts since your father abandoned us and do I get any sort of gratitude? NO!”

Eddie began to speak with true remorse, “Mom…I’m sorry. I didn’t know. If I had known, I would hav-”

“NO MORE EXCUSES, YOUNG MAN! You will eat this food and *you will like it*!”

Mother unwrapped her neck around Eddie. Her face covered the entire backdrop of the screen as her left arm locked back in on Eddie’s jaw. Her right arm began to rapidly go in and out of frame as it filled the spoon, put it in his mouth, fed him, and repeated. Eddie desperately tried to swallow each spoonful before the next one came, but Mother only came back quicker over time. Each return of the spoon became more forceful than the last.

Eddie began to choke on the ‘food’ but that did not stop Mother from feeding him more. His eyes bulged out of his sockets as blood mixed with tears flowed down his cheeks. A drop of blood landed on the bib and took the shape of a heart. The spoonfuls started to be slammed into the back of his throat. The sounds that croaked out of Eddie were the most awful sounds I have had the displeasure of hearing. Imagine a duck slowly being choked out. Imagine it pleading for its life as someone’s hands became tighter around its neck. 

Eddie’s face turned a darker shade of purple with each slam. Blood began to fling out with each exit of the spoon from his throat. Eddie’s body went limp by the time his face was a red-purple color and his jaw was three times its normal size. Mother continued to force feed him again, *and again*, ***and again*** for another 15 minutes until his mouth could not physically hold any more.

Mother deeply breathed in and out with exhaustion. She released Eddie’s jaw like a toy she was done playing with. His face immediately slammed into the kitchen table. Mother looked at her work and caringly said, “I hope you’re finally full. Enjoy your nap, my sweet baby boy.”

That was the last thing on the recording before it abruptly cut off. I hope you all see now why I wanted this story out. Eddie didn’t deserve his fate and neither did the others who didn’t make it. I’m happy to say that some of us did make it out but all of us should have. I’ll write about what happened to the others sometime soon. It’s hard for me to go back and watch these knowing that every second was my doing. All over some obsession I had in college. If you don’t continue to read what happened to the others, I understand. However, I truly believe each of their stories deserves to be out there.
