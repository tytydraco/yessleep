Why I wrote this (yes I'm writing on an Alexa video) I was Wondering if my opponent in song quiz was a real person after they made a foolish mistake and the results I found online were quite disturbing PS apologize in advanc e for the many typos

It was 9pm, my eyes were Still wide awake. "I'll just Play some song quiz" I thought, "Until I fall asleep" I open song quiz and selected the 80s rock anthems. My opponent was grace from West Virginia, who turned out to be quite good. Over the next few games everything was fine, That was until I matched with my 7th opponent for the night. Samantha from Colorado, I didn't think much of it until the 1st question. Instead of my Alexa's voice telling me that Samantha got the problems, All I heard was a faint woman's voice whispering "poison" I left the match and called it off as a glitch, trying to reassure myself. Unfortunately for me this was not a glitch. Two games later, I matched with Ryan from New York. Everything was running smooth until the final round, Instead of hearing The music clip playing, I heard a man's voice "Get off here. Song Quiz is a portal to the dead" Half of me wanted to laugh but the other half was just way too fucking confused. Who is this guy And how did he hack into my Alexa?? This is just too fucked.

 My next game wasn't anymore innocent when I paired up with a stranger from... Hell? Of course I thought it was just a joke, but of course it wasn't. The 1st song that played was highway to hell. Then the next. Ok... Two songs in a row is just a stupid coincidence right? That's when I heard a screeching sound and one of the new electric Amazon delivery trucks came crashing through my bedroom wall barely missing me in my bed. The driver who wasn't wearing his seatbelt had been shot out the front and his head had exploded on impact against my dresser. I grabbed my glock and sat down in the smoking azomng truck. After hours on the road, I reached Amazon's headquarters. When I snuck inside the spooky noise producing song quiz server room, I was surprised to see gravestones lining the floor. THEIR KILLING THEIR WORKERS TO ESTSBLISH A MARKET WITH THE DEAD! I grabbed some conveniently place fire axe and started to destroy the Song Quiz servers. No one would use song quiz anymore, no more people would get hurt.
