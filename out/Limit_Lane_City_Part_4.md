It took a while for the sound to return after the ballgame had ended. People were looking at us with pity. They must have felt this way countless times already. Finally we knew what it was like. Finally, we were like them. 

The shelves were back to being fully stocked, even overflowing with food. The sun seemed to shine a little brighter as we lay broken on the grocery store floor. 

By the time Marleen reached us she had already been crying. I sat back up and she sat down, leaning against me, crying into my shoulder. Marc didn't say a word for what felt like hours. This was the most helpless I felt since we first arrived in Limit Lane City. 

We didn't leave our room the following days. We didn't have to, there was food placed in front of our door multiple times a day. I didn't see who brought it, but one time I saw the white haired woman leave our floor in a hurry after new items appeared. I couldn't thank her, couldn't tell her we wouldn't need it either. 

Marc barely ate since Cora was gone. He spent his time scribbling on old paper and later on the floor. He planned to follow through with his revenge, killing the monster that took Cora. I didn't know what he was planning since he kept writing on the same piece of paper over and over again. I was only glad he stuck to writing and kept quiet. Enough people already heard what he said in the courtyard. 

Marleen was more distant than before. I suspected she was here for Cora's company more than for ours. As I said, I didn't know her that well. Maybe they were closer than I thought, there must have been a lot I didn't know. Or perhaps, didn't remember. 

I spent most of my days waiting. For what? I didn't know. There was nothing I could have done. After a few days I returned to the usual routine of gathering food and checking the fields outside for changes. 

"I'm glad you're back on your feet", a familiar voice called out as I was on my way back from the courtyard. The white haired lady joined me on my way. 
"Thank you for the food. You don't need to do this." "Not a problemâ€¦ I'm very sorry for your loss", she said more quietly. 
I didn't respond. 
We climbed the stairs to the next floor. 

"Why?", I asked in a daze. 
"Excuse me?" 
"Why did he do it? What does he take people for? Where are they going?" 
She took a cautious look around. I didn't. 
"It's payment for all the things he gives us." 
Taking lives for groceries, what a gracious god he must be. 
"Are you a witch?", I asked. 
She looked a little disappointed by that question. "I'd rather you call me Miranda." 

Miranda stopped bringing us food once Marc began leaving the room again. He spent a lot of time on the top floors. I tried deciphering the plans he scribbled on the concrete floor while he wasn't in the room. I think he was trying to trick the god, use its blindness to his advantage. I didn't know how exactly until I saw his plan executed. 

Marc laid some wooden planks like a bridge over the edges of some of the top most floors. They cast a clear shadow on the courtyard shelves. I saw people looking upward and watching him. If he wanted to catch the god by surprise, he needed to hurry. 

Rumours had already started to spread. Seeing him up there sent a shiver down my spine. There's no way he could have survived a fall from this height. I wanted nothing more than to help him. If I could not help him kill an entity that's most likely immortal anyways, I at least, had to keep my friend from falling to his death. 

I made my way up towards the top of the building. I had only once before been this high up, back when I counted the stories. Climbing the stairs had been tedious before but this time I had to do it even faster. My legs started to burn at the halfway mark. It was difficult to see if he was still over the edge, building bridges. I would have had to lean over the abyss myself just to get a glimpse. That wasn't a risk worth taking. 

I had to slow down if I wanted to make it to the top without collapsing. The general summer heat of this place wasn't helping either. I was breathing heavily. For a moment I was relieved to feel a cool breeze in my neck, until I realised the source. 

"In a hurry, Luke?" 
His empty voice echoed in my head. I, again, couldn't tell if it was a question or not. I took a moment to take some deep breaths. 
"What do you want?", I asked, turning towards him. His head jolted back a little. He didn't expect me to face him directly. He was unnerving to look at from this close of a distance. The way his boney jaw stuck in a permanent, soulless grin. And the way his shadow curled around you, like a snake ready to devour. 

"Your friend. He's going to kill me?" I swallowed. So he had already heard the rumours. This wasn't good. 
"And I suspect you are on your way to him", continued the skeleton god. Oh no, did I lead it directly to Mark by accident? The god curled his head over the edge of the hallway. The sun reflected on his face. 
"So he was the source of all this noise." 
He dragged out the last few words and by the end of his sentence he had once again dissolved into shadow. I had to warn Marc, I had to get up there quick. If it wasn't already too late. 

I contemplated shouting for him, but I didn't want the god to hear. I channeled all my energy to run up the stairs as fast as I could. My legs hurt and my lungs were burning. 

Something rushed by in my peripheral vision. It fell too quickly to discern, from the top stories towards the courtyard. Marc? I threw myself on the floor and crawled towards the ledge, trying to keep enough of my wheight on safe ground. I heard commotion from down where the thing had just landed. More confusion than disturbance. I peaked my head over the edge to see some people on the grocery platform looking up. There was a wooden plank, lying across the tops of some shelves. Thank god it wasn't Marc. 

I rolled to the side to face the sky. My friend was still up there. He balanced along one of his planks. His legs looked weak and trembling. For a moment he fell to his knees but managed to grab hold of the plank below him. Darkness was pouring down from the hallway like a waterfall. The skeleton must have been up there. The ceiling was obstructing my view of the szene. I needed to get higher.

I carefully crawled back and continued racing up the staircase. The echo of a voice like dripping water filled the space around me, but I didn't understand what it said. A few stories up and there was more debris falling down besides me. The voice got clearer, this time I understood. 

"Where are you hiding?" 
Marc must still be on one of his bridges. Only two floors to go. I could still make it. All this time, there was just one thought repeating in my head over and over. 
"I just lost Cora, I can't lose Marc" I climbed the stairs on my hands and knees. I could barely raise my head up over the wall as I finally arrived at the thirty-fifth floor. 

Marc was hugging the wood underneath him. Hanging on for dear life. He held something in his hand. The huge, cloaked figure was blocking his way back to the hallway floor. It took a few small steps towards my helpless friend. 
"There you are", it said, twisting its head uncomfortably. I pressed my hands against the concrete floor and pushed my body up with the last of my strength. 

"Wait!" was all I could say. The skeleton god turned towards me. Suddenly I heard Marc get up and run. A shimmering blade rushed along the skeletons neck. Like a leaf in the wind, his head tumbled off his body and fell into the chasm. The darkness from within his cloak ran out and poured over the edge until only his black cloak was left. Marc meanwhile collapsed, barely keeping his balance on the hallway floor. What had just happened? How? I pulled Marc away from the edge and we both just took some deep breaths.

There were screams coming from the ground floor. I suppose his head didn't dissolve like the rest of him. Marc didn't just behead the skeleton god, did he? We slowly made our way back down. 

People were talking, not as secretive as before. Everyone was in a state of panic and confusion. "What now? What are we going to do without food?", I heard a young woman say as we passed. "Can he still hear us?", a little boy asked his father. "Don't worry, his reign never truly ends", an elderly lady said in a comforting tone, patting a man's shoulder. 

Their eyes were boring through us once they noticed us. Marc achieved his goal without even a scratch, but he didn't look satisfied. This wasn't supposed to happen this way, was it? By the time we returned to our room, Marleen had already heard what had happened. Everyone knew by then. I didn't know if I was supposed to feel pride or distress. All I knew was that that particular night seemed a little darker than the last.
