As a freelance journalist, I had covered many stories in my career. But interviewing a cat? That was a first. I had heard rumors about this particular feline - it was said that the cat was possessed by a demonic spirit. My curiosity got the better of me and I decided to investigate.

I arrived at the cat owner's house, which was in a quiet suburban area. The owner, an elderly woman, welcomed me and introduced me to the cat, which was sitting on a cushioned armchair in the living room. The cat's eyes followed me as I sat down opposite it.

"Hello," I said tentatively. "My name is John. I'm a journalist and I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions?"

The cat stared at me with its piercing green eyes, and for a moment, I felt a chill run down my spine. But I shook it off and continued with my questions.

"Can you tell me about yourself? What's it like being a cat?"

The cat didn't respond, and I began to feel silly talking to a cat. But then, something strange happened. The cat's eyes started to glow, and its body began to shake violently. It let out a blood-curdling screech that made me jump out of my seat.

I quickly backed away, but the cat's voice seemed to echo in my head.

"I am not a cat," it hissed. "I am a demon, and I have possessed this feline vessel."

I felt a wave of fear wash over me as the cat continued to speak. It told me about its past life as a demon, and how it had been banished to the body of a cat as punishment. It also warned me about the dangers of meddling with dark magic.

As the interview came to an end, the cat's eyes returned to their normal color, and it sat back down calmly. The elderly woman smiled at me, oblivious to what had just transpired.

I left the house, feeling shaken and unnerved. The encounter had left me questioning my own sanity. Was it all just a hallucination or did I really just interview a possessed cat?

I left the house, still reeling from the bizarre interview with the possessed cat. As I made my way back to my car, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

I couldn't shake the horrible feeling that the demon had somehow followed me home, I pulled in to the freshly paved driveway and spent the rest of the night with the lights on, fearing for my safety. I knew one thing for sure - I would never forget the terror of that interview. From that day on, I made a vow to never again delve into the world of the supernatural and stick to feel good stories. Some things in this world are better left untouched.

As I finished typing up the story, I looked up from my computer and thatâ€™s when I noticed the \[door\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/117glud/i\_just\_bought\_my\_dream\_home\_but\_what\_i\_discovered/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/117glud/i_just_bought_my_dream_home_but_what_i_discovered/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3))
