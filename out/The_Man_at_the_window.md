 My family is Georgian-American, at least from my mom’s side. Every summer we’d go from my hometown of Lancaster, Pennsylvania to my mom’s childhood house in Samtredia, a town in the Imereti region of western Georgia, to spend the summer with our relatives there, primarily my grandmother, aunt, and uncle. In the past, we visited thrice a year: once on New Year, then during Easter, and then in June for summer vacation. This time, due to my dad’s complications with work, we had to go a bit later in July.

  It was 2014, I was around 11 at the time and my family and I had just landed in the Kutaisi International Airport. We were outside of the airport, waiting for my uncle to pick us up. He married my aunt when I was around nine years old and has been someone our family relied on ever since, my father and he got along fairly well. 

  We had to wait for a while for him to arrive and while we were waiting for him, my mom noticed that my little brother, Andria, wasn’t with us. She quickly began looking around, trying to find him, and thankfully, having avoided a potential panic attack, he was a couple of feet away from us by the sidewalk, kneeling and looking at something on the road. She sighed out of relief and nudged my shoulder.

   “Luka, go get your brother.” She told me.

   “Why? Why don’t you go get him?” I was somewhat frustrated at my mother for telling me to do something she could’ve easily done herself, but looking back at it now, she was obviously fatigued from the trip and even felt nauseous when we initially arrived, so I couldn’t blame her for telling me to get him when he was right there.

   “Come on, is it really that difficult?” She replied to me with a drowsy expression.

   “Well…fine.” I said, noticing that she was tired

I don’t know why, but there was a strange absence of life outside of the airport, normally you’d see people coming and going by car, but there wasn’t a whole lot of that. There were cars out, but they merely stood still like effigies frozen in time. The world felt so empty that, even though my parents were directly behind me, I felt alone and kind of sad (most of this could’ve been chalked up to jet lag messing with my brain). This feeling was immediately broken by the time I walked up to my brother, who was looking down at the ground with such revulsion and curiosity that could only be matched by someone discovering pornography for the first time.

   “Hey, come on, get up.” I tapped his shoulder. “Uncle’s gonna be here any second.” 

   “Look.” He pointed at whatever he was looking at.

   “Huh?” I looked down to see a snail crawling, along with the squashed corpse of another snail. The corpse was directly in front of the living snail and it kind of looked like he was moving toward it, which felt extremely macabre to my 11-year-old self.

   “Kinda sad, isn’t it?” Andria looked up at me. He was only a year younger than me, but a lot of seemingly ‘weird’ things captivated him. He often played around with plastic bags, ate his boogers, and even bit his nails to pass the time. Both of us had some neurodivergent tendencies and I even got diagnosed with ADHD and OCD later in life, so I shared some of his ticks and his tenacity for odd behavior.

   I didn’t say anything to Andria’s question, but the sight of a snail crawling over to the corpse of another gave me thoughts that were not only unpleasant but also horrific to someone of that age. I’ve always been an extremely imaginative kid and due to my (then undiagnosed) OCD, I’d often have thoughts or images pop into my head that made me feel uncomfortable. In this case, I had thoughts that pertained to the corpse belonging to the snail’s lover, relative or friend. 

   Thankfully, before my brain could make me think of something similar happening to me, the sound of a car horn came blasting from my left; our uncle had arrived.

   I grabbed my brother's arm and pulled him up, the two of us walked over to our parents and got into our uncle’s car. 

   “Luka! Andria! How’re you guys?” Our uncle greeted us with an obvious Imeretian accent, an accent that I and Andria would often try to emulate whenever we came to Samtredia. To me, raised to speak in proper Georgian, it sounded like how a southern accent would sound to any American raised north, which I and Andria were.

   “We’re fine! How are you, Uncle Tamaz?” Andria said.

The dialogue between the two of us was as flat as it could get between a man and his wife’s nephews. We loved our uncle and all, but there wasn’t really much conversation to be had between two American-born children whose only ties to their home country were through knowing the language, along with a few vague cultural details, and a man who hadn’t even stepped a single foot outside of his home country. 

   My father though, who knew Georgian quite well for an American of Irish descent, had loads to talk to my uncle about. The two of them were as close as two sons-in-law could get and basically talked the entire way home. I didn’t listen to their conversation, though I did overhear my uncle mentioning something about how two houses around the area got broken into and resulted in the deaths of four people. 

   “What happened?” Curious, I poked my head behind the driver’s seat.

   “Nothing that concerns you-” My father tried to shoo me away, before being cut off by my uncle.

   “What happened was that one house got broken into in Akhalsopheli and the guy living there, he was old, got killed. The second break-in happened in Samtredia, fortunately not anywhere near us, and an old lady and her two sons were murdered.”

   I didn’t say anything, I *couldn’t* say anything. My uncle’s blunt, no-holds-back response just kind of left me…shocked. I pulled away from the driver’s seat and sat down, looking out of the window to somehow forget about what my uncle said. As I mentioned before, I was a highly imaginative kid and this talk of some random serial killer breaking into people’s houses and killing people immediately made me think of the worst-case scenario. 

   It also didn’t help that I saw a snail possibly grieving over the death of its friend's squashed corpse which sent my fear-induced OCD into hyperdrive. Against my will, a ‘what if’ scenario kept popping up in my head, where some crazy maniac broke into our house and started murdering every one of us. A particularly shocking scene included me getting stabbed in the throat with a sharp knife.

   I quickly moved my arm to my neck, something I usually did when it felt sensitive and began to pinch and massage it. I did this to calm down and to forget about the scenario my mind conjured up, I didn’t want to freak out in the car about it, since I didn’t want to be perceived as a crazy cuckoo by my uncle and my dad, who were uneducated on neurodivergence and mental health in general.

   After around a 45-50 minute drive, I honestly can’t remember how long the drive itself took, we finally arrived at our destination, that being my mother’s childhood home. Typically, it would be hot this year around in Samtredia, but due to it having rained so recently, the air was a bit chilly, which honestly beat the scorching heat you’d often have to face in western Georgia during the summer. 

   I got out of the car and went to greet my grandmother, who was in the kitchen baking some khachapuri. I was the first one to get out of the car and run to the back of the house, I crouched down and silently approached the backdoor (which also led to the kitchen) and opened the door, shouting “BOO!” to my grandma. 

  After having scared her for a second, she quickly ran over to me and hugged me. The rest of my family arrived by the front door and were greeted by my aunt (who I also jumpscared). My grandma and my mom set the dinner table and my aunt brought out some food for the whole family to eat. Me and my brother ate some of it, but we weren’t exactly hungry, jet lag often does that to you, much to my grandma’s dismay. How my parents were hungry was beyond me.

   My brother and I went outside to get some fresh air. I often got overwhelmed when there were too many people in a single room, especially if the room in question was small (the living room kind of was). My brother would often follow me around when he was younger, so it was obvious he’d come outside with me when I didn’t feel comfortable enough in the living room.

   I don’t know why it bothered me so much, it still kind of does, but I always felt like I was being suffocated and squashed by the mere presence of multiple people in a small room. Their laughs, their odor, it all overwhelmed me and I needed a break of some sort. When me and my brother got outside, we heard two familiar voices calling our names.

   We turned around to see that the voices belonged to Davit and Giorgi, two neighbors who we often hung out with when we visited our family in the summer. They lived right next to my mom’s family, so they probably heard that we were going to be visiting from either my aunt or their parents. We greeted one another and asked how they were doing. We got along fairly well, especially since our personalities complimented one another. Davit was the oldest and he was more often than not seen as a leader. I considered myself to be the co-captain, whereas Giorgi and Andria were the underlings who always listened to the two of us.

   Amidst our conversation, Giorgi suggested that the four of us should go biking along the trail in front of our houses. My uncle bought two bikes for me and Andria to use and they often sat in his shed not being used until that one time when me and Andria would visit. They weren’t exactly much compared to the bikes we had in America (my mom refused to bring them for whatever reason), but they were decent enough. We agreed and ran to our uncle’s shed to bring out the bikes.

   After a couple of minutes, the four of us were riding our bikes along the asphalt road that was in front of our houses. To give some context, our houses were located in a neighborhood that was in front of a railroad, the only thing separating the houses and the railroad were the aforementioned asphalt road and a trench of water that me and Andria called a mini-river when we were younger. 

   We had a lot of fun that day, we passed cows grazing, old men drinking and playing backgammon, and we rode our bikes until the sun was beginning to set. 

   Andria increased his pace and moved in front of Davit, who was the first in our little cycling row, I guess you could call it, and turned around, flipping us off, before laughing and pedaling even faster. I chuckled and attempted to flip him off too, but I noticed that he stopped. Davit and I stopped behind him, Giorgi stopped as well and got off his bike.

   “What’s the matter?” Giorgi asked.

   “Look.” Andria said, pointing at something in the distance.

   By the side of the trench of water, there was a neat row of about 11 or 12 pine trees planted that covered the road in front of us in shadows. It was already somewhat dark outside and whatever Andria pointed towards, while not hard to see, was obscured by the shadows. Behind the last tree, there was a tall, skinny figure looking at the four of us. The figure, who appeared to be male, wore a blue shirt and black baggy pants. He had long, black hair that covered some of his face, primarily his eyes. 

  I looked closer and it looked to me as if, probably because of the fact that he was so far away from us, but the lower half of his face looked featureless. My eyesight wasn’t the best, I started wearing glasses a year later, so it must've been because of that, but Giorgi asked whether the man had a mouth or not, so he must've shared my sentiment. Davit, who was the bravest of the four of us, got off his bike and started to slowly walk forward. 

   “Hello? Can we help you?” He shouted. No response.

   The man turned around, so swiftly that it’d make you think he could’ve broken his back, and just began to walk away. He didn’t pay attention to us, it was as if we didn’t even exist to him. The four of us, obviously freaked out, thought it best to return home, we turned around and pedaled back to our houses, all the while occasionally glancing back. 

   There was an odd sense of dread on the way back home, all of us were silent. The question of whether that man was the serial killer who had refused to leave my mind for as long as I was there. I wanted to say it out loud, but my lips refused to move. In the end, we all decided to keep silent about the endeavor without even saying a single word to one another. 

  It was time to go to bed a few hours after we returned. Me and my brother slept in the same room, whereas my grandmother slept in the room above us. My parents slept on the second floor, so did my aunt and uncle. Everyone in the house had gone to sleep, everyone except for me; I just couldn’t sleep for some reason. I was tired, extremely so, but I also felt tense and alert, almost as if someone was watching me from afar. 

   I would doze off for about fifteen to thirty minutes, before waking up again and looking around the room, but then I’d doze off again and repeat the whole process. The longest I dozed off for was probably around an hour and half, I probably would’ve gone to sleep, had the sound of what appeared to be breathing waking me up completely. To give additional context, the bed I was sleeping in was a two-person bed and was located right next to a window. The side that I was sleeping on was coincidentally below said window, a little bit to my left, but I was below the window nonetheless.

   When I woke up, I was facing my brother’s back, and it physically couldn’t have been him. The breathing was not only deep and more rapid, it was also coming from behind me. At that point, I was on the verge of pissing myself, I could’ve gone back to sleep, but my curiosity got the best of me and I had to know where the sound was coming from.

   I made sure to turn in my bed as discreetly and quietly as I could, without making too much noise. I was praying to God for there to not be a loud creaking sound, because if whoever, or whatever, was behind me heard me, who knows what could’ve happened? At least, that’s what I thought at the time. I slowly turned in my bed, making a slight creaking sound. I prayed to God that whatever was in front of me didn’t notice me.

  I opened my eyes and saw…nothing, there was nothing in front of me, which only meant one thing, the breathing was coming from outside. 

  I looked up at the window and saw a man with long, black hair and a cartoonishly wide grin looking down at me. He had no facial hair, no eyebrows, and he was staring at me like I was a meal, ready to be dug into. He didn’t blink once and his smile looked like something that, at least to a 11 year old child, a normal human shouldn’t have been capable of doing.

   He looked like he wanted to hurt me. 

   I immediately screamed at the top of my lungs, I tried to get off the bed, but I only managed to fall off and hit the ground. 

   My grandmother came rushing into our room, shouting. “What happened?!”

   “There’s a man at the window!” I pointed in front of me, fully expecting my grandmother to see a man with an almost demonic grin looking at her.

   But the man was gone, there was no one at the window. There was no sound either, no footsteps, no breathing, nothing, the only sound coming from outside was that of fireflies. My grandmother deduced that I must’ve had a nightmare, a point I couldn’t argue against, I was only 11 years old and I wasn’t very good at proving my point at that age. 

   But what I saw didn’t *feel* like a nightmare, it felt more physical and apparent. In most nightmares I’ve had, there was a certain feeling of intangibility or surrealism that cleared up the fact that it was a dream, but I didn’t have that when I woke up and saw that…thing standing by the window, it felt completely real.

   My grandma slept with us that night and tried her best to comfort me. I was paranoid, constantly looking at the window and at the corners of the room to try and catch the smiling man, but I couldn’t spot him anywhere, it was like he vanished. After about an hour or so of constantly looking around, I finally managed to fall asleep. The man didn’t come and that at least gave me some semblance of peace. 

   I had come to accept that what I saw was probably a dream or some sort of hallucination as a result of sleep deprivation, those were the most rational explanations my 11 year old brain could come up with.

   The following morning, I woke up to the sound of my grandmother screaming outside. My uncle and aunt ran out to see what had happened and heard their equally shocked expressions. Me and my brother quickly got dressed and ran outside to see just what happened. To my shock, I saw six beheaded chickens lying directly in front of the window that was in my bedroom. 

   I was horrified, to say the least. My imagination was running wild and my mind was constantly attacking me with thoughts of ‘Was what happened yesterday real?’ ‘Did that man find us?’ ‘Were we next on that man’s list of victims?’. But then my uncle pointed out something that chilled me to my core.

   He said that the chicken’s heads didn’t look like they were cut off, but as if they were bitten off by teeth, human teeth.

   I then told my uncle and aunt what happened last night.

   My aunt called the cops and they, along with my uncle and dad, spent a good few days searching the entire area. A couple of their neighbors joined in on the search for the man that they based off of my description, but they couldn’t find anyone like that. The murders stopped soon after and nothing happened ever since, which was a weight off of everyone’s shoulders in the town.

   I spent the rest of my summer relatively stress-free and still continued to visit Samtredia every summer, I still do today.

   I’m 21 now and in the 10 years that followed, they apparently never caught the killer, it was as if he ceased to exist, and while it is good to know that the murders stopped, it’s still unsettling to think that he could still be out there, waiting to finish what he couldn’t.
