I’m desperate for help. I don’t know why I’m turning to an Internet forum for it, but everywhere else has failed. This is a true story - PLEASE believe me - I need help. 



It began years ago. I’d just turned 24, a beautiful young woman with looks that could kill. I’d be out every weekend, flirting with men for drinks, dancing with my friends in bars until the early hours of the morning, having gifts sent to me by my various male admirers. Life was amazing. 

That was also the year my mother was diagnosed with Cushing’s disease. It’s when you have too much cortisol in your body, and can come on at any age. The symptoms are brutal: more body fat on the belly, chest and neck. The face becomes scabby and red. Beauty is stolen. My mother was such a beautiful lady at 44 years old. By her 45th birthday, she resembled a hideous replica of herself. I was embarrassed to even call her my mother to some people, having something so ugly associated with me and my beautiful looks. They’d probably assume I was adopted. It wouldn’t be long before my embarrassment turned to dread however, when talking to her over the phone, she revealed the disease is hereditary. I was inevitably going to get it, sooner or later. 

I’d have rather it be a cancer diagnosis. Honestly, I thought of killing myself right there. I couldn’t bear to look like what she did now - a fat belly, hideous chubby cheeks that hid her eyes away, red scabby flesh covering her entire body. That’s not a life worth living. I screamed at her that night, for cursing me with this disease. I told her to never contact me again, that I’ll sort this out by myself. 

Weeks went by. I completely isolated myself, seldom leaving my apartment. I went into a complete depression, counting down the days until I’d end up as hideous as my mother. Not even able to enjoy my remaining few years of good looks.


That was until I met Lucy. 


I wasn’t sure quite how I met Lucy. I know she was a travelling saleswoman for a makeup brand, but I never remember opening my door to her. One day I found myself stood there, messy hair and bloodshot eyes in a dressing gown, face to face with her at my door. She was gorgeous. This perfectly symmetrical face. Flawless skin, luscious hair. She’s everything I was, but wasn’t. Everything I should’ve been for the rest of my life, but won’t be. I remember she beamed at me with this perfect smile, before asking me if she could have a minute of my time. I instinctively was about to tell her I didn’t, and slam the door shut so I could continue binging Netflix - but something stopped me. Something made me reply. 


‘Sure’. 


‘Great!’ She replied. ‘I’m a Sales Rep for Anne Gwish - the makeup brand - you might not have heard of us as we are a relatively new company’. 

‘We have a new line of beauty serums, they promise flawless skin that will never crack! It also includes properties that reduce bloating and improve natural glow!’ She continued. 

I was unsure what to say. All I could mutter out, sorrowfully was:


‘Do you take it?’


‘Of course!’


I paused and thought of how wonderful it would be to look like her. Someone even more beautiful than me! But I knew it would mean nothing, my mother’s condition would ruin it down the line anyway. 

The woman, in her pressed Balenciaga suit jacket and business pants, then almost immediately rebuttled. 


‘It even combats Cushings disease!’


‘What?’ I replied, shocked. 


‘Here’s my card’ she said with a smile ‘give the number a call if you’re interested!’

I looked down at the card. 



LUCY FIRHILL

Exec. Saleswoman since 1992

Anne Gwish & Co

(+66)6851212666



A saleswoman since 1992? An executive saleswoman since 1992! She must be at least in her 40s, maybe even 50s - and she looks my age! I looked back up to question her on that date, but she’d gone. I ran to my apartment window so see her hopping into her bright red convertible Mercedes. The sun accentuating her beauty. I envied her. I wanted to be beautiful, and be beautiful forever. 


The very next morning I called the number.  It barely rang once. 


‘Is this Eve?’ The voice on the phone answered with.  


I didn’t think I had told Lucy my name, or my number, but maybe I had in a daze when she was stood at the door. 


‘Erm…yeah.’ I said. ‘You came to my door yesterday, about the beauty serum, I was wondering - can it make me beautiful forever? Like you?’


‘It certainly can, Eve! Beautiful forever.’


‘And how much would it cost?’


‘Ah yes. Well, anything good isn’t worth a lot is it? Apart from sports teams haha.’ Lucy’s voice replied, with a chuckle. 


I pondered this statement for a minute. Anything good…isn’t…worth a lot? 


‘So the serum isn’t good?’ I muttered, confused. 


‘I’m not talking about the serum. I’m talking about you. But I’ve got a soft spot, so I’m going to give you it for cheap. Just text ‘CROSSROADS’ to this number and you’ll receive the serum. We have your address ready to post.’


‘Ok…thanks. But how much is cheap?’


‘Your soul’ Lucy giggled. 


‘What?’


The phone call ended abruptly there. I remember thinking I’d misheard her. My soul? Maybe she was joking. I opened up iMessage with her number and sent the phrase ‘CROSSROADS’ to it. 

And that was it. 

The next day the serum came, and it worked. I was back to my beautiful self, even more now so. I had regained all my confidence too, now knowing that I would be protected from my hereditary curse of ugliness down the line. Life was bliss for the next 3 years. Until last month, just after my 27th birthday. I was getting ready to go out, partying with the girls as usual, when I found my feet almost frozen to the ground. They were paralysed, panicked and unable to move, I managed to call 911. When the paramedics came however, my symptoms disappeared the moment before they got through the door. After I admitted this to them with an embarrassed look on my face, they left. 

This same thing would happen the next few nights. One of my body parts would become paralysed, I’d panic and call an ambulance - just to be fine as soon as they got here. Shortly after that they put a red warning on my number and address, not to come, as they were ‘prank calls’. Yesterday it began happening again, from my arms this time. I used my voice to call my mother first. She didn’t answer. All my friends were out partying, so they didn’t answer either. I had no one. 

This brings us to now. I’ve been frozen in the same place now in my apartment for about 29 hours, unable to move any part of my body. I’m like a statue. My facial muscles still just about work, so I’m writing this via voice dictation, but I can feel them beginning to cramp and freeze as I speak. 

Over the last few hours I’ve had a chance to do some thinking. I think if I was the devil, I wouldn’t dress in a red cape and pointy horns. I’d have a pretty face, drive a nice car and wear an expensive suit. Basically, I’d come in the form of everything you’ve ever wished for and watch you create your own hell. 

I suppose my own hell is my own wish. I will be beautiful forever. Frozen in this beauty. But unable to move or enjoy it. To live. I suppose they’ll find me in a few days. I’ll be paralysed, my heart will have stopped - and they’ll bury me. All I’ll have is my beauty and my thoughts, enough to last an eternity hopefully. 

My name is Eve Lilith Eden. If anyone is reading this, they’ve likely buried me thinking I’m dead. I’m not. Please come and find me. If anyone finds this post, please share it - someone might’ve known me when I was still alive. The date today is 12th October 2009. I hope I don’t have to wait a while before someone digs me up and fixes me…
