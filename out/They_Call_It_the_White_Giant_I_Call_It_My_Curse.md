I never really knew where I came from.

My parents – the ones who raised me – told me I was adopted when I was six. They said my real family lived far away, in a tiny fishing village in Argentina, Patagonia.

I didn’t think much of it back then. But over the years, the thought stuck with me, and around two weeks ago, I decided to go visit. Luckily, my adoptive parents supported the idea.

My dad even dug up an old letter he’d kept in the attic. According to him, it arrived a few days after my official adoption, and insisted on it being a sign of me growing up to be curious (they are superstitious people.)

There was a single map on the letter showing a satellite image of a town – my town, I assumed. Under it, a sentence which read: “Ask for the Ferryman in Comodoro Rivadavia.”

The ocean was clean and serene when I arrived in the city. I didn’t know exactly what I was looking for, but I assumed the Ferryman would be near the docks. At the end of the pier, I saw him. A man sat alone on a bench, wearing a black coat and a fisherman’s cap pulled low.

His boat, docked just behind him, looked like it hadn’t moved in years. “You’re late,” he said as I approached.

I stopped. “Are you the--”

“The one supposed to take you to the town?” he interrupted, before reaching into his coat and pulling out a folded note. My name was written on the front. Marcos.

“I was told to expect you,” he added, handing it over. “Didn’t think you’d actually come.”

I stared at the piece of paper, then back at him. “Who told you?”

He smiled faintly. “Someone who knew you’d start asking questions when you got older. If they could’ve stopped you, they would have,” he added. “But she didn’t dare risk the village knowing she’d sent word.”

Then he motioned to the boat. “Get in.”

The trip was silent except for the hum of the motor. After an hour, the cliffs closed in around us.

“You were never supposed to return,” the Ferryman said finally.

“Why not?”

“Because the village gave you up. That’s not something easily undone. But…” he hesitated, taking a deep breath before continuing. “Some of us don’t agree with what they did. What they sacrificed.”

I didn’t respond, but he kept going. “They’ll remember you. Even if they don’t admit it. I know, because I remember.” He didn’t speak again for the rest of the journey.

After hours at sea, my legs were sore from sitting.

The village slowly revealed itself: a cluster of rooftops and boats, tucked between the cliffs like it was made to hide itself from others. The Ferryman docked next to older vessels and threw a rope on the dock. “You walk from here,” he muttered, in a different tone than before. “But don’t expect welcome arms.”

I followed a narrow dirt path which led to the village. The buildings came into view gradually – houses built from wood and rusted metal, weather-beaten to the point they were hardly recognizable.

I saw no one at first. The village seemed dead – only the wind moved between the houses, but there were no people outside. I stopped at a crossroads – before I could choose a direction to follow, someone called my name from behind me. “Marcos?”

I turned.

An older woman stood behind her house’s door, anticipating my answer. Her hair was tied back, and it was gray with age. Behind her, I saw a man step into view – shorter than her, with a limp.

“We weren’t sure it was you,” she said, stepping forward slowly.

I hesitated. “Are you--?”

She nodded, a tear rolling down her face. “Your mother. My name is Clara. This is Mateo, your father.”

My throat went dry. I expected this moment to feel big – a celebration, a reunion. But instead, I just felt small. The village had swallowed the energy out of it. They looked… ashamed. Instead of happiness, there was something else they were feeling.

Mateo didn’t say anything. He just nodded, and refused to make eye contact.

“Come inside,” Clara said gently. “You must be cold.”

Their house was one of the larger ones in the village, but inside it felt claustrophobic. The walls were thin and a small fire burned in the corner stove. I sat down at a handmade wooden table as Clara poured tea.

“I didn’t think I’d ever see you again,” she said, quietly. “I hoped, but…”

“You shouldn’t have come,” Mateo muttered. “You shouldn’t have. Because of the Rite.” Clara looked shocked, but didn’t scold Mateo for saying it.

“The Rite?”

Clara looked at Mateo first, like she was asking for permission to tell me. “Every year, we… the village, I mean… offers one of our own. A child.”

My chest tightened. “Offers them?”

She nodded, not meeting my eyes. “To the sea.”

Mateo’s voice came harder, like he was done pretending and playing gentle. “More specifically, to *it*. Whatever it is that lives out there. Whatever keeps destroying our lives.”

He finally looked in my eyes, for the first time since I entered the house. “You were chosen that year. You were supposed to be taken. One child, once a year. That’s the bargain. If we don’t fulfill it--”

Clara interrupted gently. “It punishes us. Boats capsize, nets come up empty, people disappear.” Mateo held Clara’s hand. “But that year, something went wrong. You disappeared before the offering. Some of us prayed you drowned. Others said it was fate.”

Mateo continued. “But it wasn’t. You were saved by someone. That’s when it stopped being compliant.”

He looked like he’d been waiting to say it for years. “It’s not been satisfied since.”

I felt myself tearing up. Was it my fault? These people were suffering… because of me? Does it even exist?

“We didn’t want to let you go,” Clara cried out. ”But it wasn’t our choice.”

Mateo pulled his hand away and stood up. “I told them it was foolish. That we should look for you, or offer someone else instead.” His voice cracked with bitterness. “But they didn’t want to. And it attacked. The first night after you disappeared.”

I felt a cold breeze make its way up my back. I couldn’t decide if I was listening to superstition or a confession.

“It knows we tried to cheat it. The others think you cursed this village by surviving.”

My skin crawled – either from the breeze or the words that were being tossed around. “So why am I here? Why didn’t you tell me not to come? I don’t want to get you into trouble.”

“We didn’t know you were alive,” Clara whispered. “Not for sure. Then the Ferryman sent word, and by then it was too late.”

I stood up, agitated. “Too late for what? You aren’t making sense.”

 Mateo looked me dead in the eyes. “Too late to stop what’s coming.”

A knock rattled the door. Mateo moved toward it, swinging it open.

A man stood in the cold, his breath visible in the air. “They saw it,” he panted. “Up past the cliffs.”

Mateo’s face went pale. “How close?”

The man didn’t say anything else – he didn’t need to, as we heard a scream from far away. Then it abruptly ended. For a moment, no one moved. Then Mateo looked at me. “Get inside the back room. Now.”

I listened, but before standing up, I saw something outside the window. I couldn’t make out what it was – but I saw long limbs, a huge figure and white fur.

Clara grabbed my wrist and yanked me into the back room. She slammed the door shut and shoved a dresser in front of it. She turned to me, her eyes wide with fear.

“It knows you came back. That’s why it’s here.”

A sound came from outside – something heavy being dragged across the street. I could hear distant shouts and gunshots, but they slowly faded.

Clara crouched beside me. “There’s someone you need to find. The woman who saved you, Sera – the one who took you away from this place.” I blinked, speechless and silent.

“She came once, years ago. When Mateo wasn’t here. Told me all about you – how you survived, and are now with another family. Then told me to never speak of it to the others. They’d try to bring you back. Finish what they started.”

She blinked, her eyes turning serious for a moment. “It’s what Mateo plans to do now. They’ve talked it over with the village.”

My chest tightened. I could barely hear her over my own heartbeat. She reached out and gently cupped the side of my face. And although her hands were cold, they were steady – the only steady thing left in the house. “Don’t worry, my dear. I’m not losing you again. Not to anyone.”

She shoved me toward the back door with a deep sadness yet fulfillment in her eyes. “Run, Marcos. Up the hill, far away. I’ve sent word to her.”

And I didn’t argue. I listened to her and bolted for it.

I reached the top of the hill, my limbs burning by the end of it.

At first, I thought the tower I saw there was abandoned – its stone walls were cracked and the doorframe bent inward. But a woman opened the door and looked at me with kind eyes.

“Marcos,” she said softly.

She looked younger than I had expected – around 30 with a few wrinkles running across her forehead. Her eyes were tired, but after seeing me, she tried to mask it.

“You’ve grown. Come in, quickly.”

I stepped inside, and she closed the door behind us. The interior was small but cozy – not as claustrophobic as the house in the village.

“You’re Sera,” I finally managed.

“And you’re the boy I should’ve left behind.” Her voice didn’t carry any bitterness – just a dry sense of humor and guilt.

I swallowed hard. “My parents say you took me.”

“I *saved* you,” she corrected. “But saving you broke the balance, and it’s been angry since.”

I sat, too exhausted to argue. “What is it?”

Her expression mirrored that of a young, ambitious woman. “Subject TIDAL-WARDEN – that’s what we called it. Your people just call it the White Giant.”

I didn’t want to interrupt her with my questions, so I sat in silence.

“It’s older than the village. Older than any of us, actually.” She placed a hand on her forehead. “The Rite kept it calm. But the year I saved you, I didn’t just save a child – I doomed this place.”

I stared at the floor. “Then, what can we do?”

Sera leaned forward and looked at me. “You have three choices, Marcos. Run, and leave this place to rot – which is what your mother wants. Stay and try to trap it, which is virtually impossible. Or…”

Her voice failed.

“I can give you back to it.”

I flinched – she must’ve noticed, as she added, “I don’t want to do that. But it’s the truth. And you deserve to know.”

I closed my eyes, trying to clear my head. I couldn’t forget my mother’s face – the way she shoved me toward the back door. The sadness in her eyes.

“You decide,” Sera said quietly. “But you don’t have much time. It’s coming our way.”

She moved quickly after that.

“We can’t kill it,” she said, pulling open a wooden chest in the corner. Inside there were tools which could be used to trap it; metal hooks, thick rope and dynamite. “But we *could* trap it.”

She grabbed my shoulders. “Marcos. Listen to me. The village refused my help. I was exiled here from my job because of saving you. We don’t have time to be afraid, only you can help me with this.”

I nodded, though I wasn’t confident in whatever we were about to do.

We left the tower together, moving through the woods. From here, I could see the village far below – and coming straight for us was the White Giant.

It moved with confidence – it wasn’t searching for me, it knew where I was. Its white fur caught the moonlight, and its head tilted as if it were listening.

Sera shoved a bundle of hooks and rope into my arms. “Help me set anchors along the ridge,” she ordered. “If we can get it tangled--”

The beast’s roar cut her off.

It sped up, now running towards me.

“This won’t work, Sera. What else--”

“We’ll make it work,” Sera snapped. Her voice carried the same kind of hope and determination my mother’s did.

We worked fast, hammering the hooks into the rock with speed and precision. Each roar came closer. I could hear its steps from far away.

When the last hook was secured, Sera looked at me. “If this fails, you run. Do you understand?”

I wanted to argue – to tell her that wasn’t fair to the villagers. But then I remembered my mother’s words – “*I’m not losing you again*.” She wanted me to survive. She didn’t want me to die here.

I swallowed hard, and hoped for the trap to work.

The Giant came into view, its limbs moving erratically beside him. Its head turned toward us, and for a moment I saw the desperation in its cold, dark eyes.

This could work.

“Now!” Sera shouted.

We pulled the ropes, and for a second, it seemed to work. She threw the dynamite at him – I’m not sure whether to damage it or bury it.

The blast tore through the ground, echoing across the cliffs – I’m sure the entire village heard it. And for one fleeting moment, I thought it had worked.

The White Giant stumbled, its massive form vanishing behind dust and debris.

Sera grabbed my arm. “Move. Now.”

We started running toward the village, but I made the mistake of looking back. I just wanted to see whether it was following us.

And it was.

The creature clawed its way out of the rubble, its white fur stained with dust and blood. It tilted its head, and its mouth resembled a grin.

“No…” I muttered.

Sera shoved me harder. “Go!”

The ropes we’d laid, the hooks – none of it mattered. This beast couldn’t – can’t – be trapped.

“Down there,” she pointed toward a narrow ravine which we could use to out-maneuver it. “If we can get to the water, it might--”

A roar tore through the air again, cutting her off.

Sera’s hand pushed me forward. “Run, Marcos!”

And in that moment, I didn’t object. Everything – the village, the people, Sera – faded into the background. There was only my mother’s voice.

Behind me, I heard Sera scream – a scream that was abruptly cut off by the sound of trees falling.

By the time I reached the shore, the village lights were a faint glow in the distance. And I realized what I’d done.

In that moment, I wanted to turn back – to fight and help my family survive. But I didn’t.

Because my mother told me to run. To survive.

I stared at the black horizon, and for the first time in years, I prayed.

I’m sorry, Mother. I hope you can forgive me. I hope you wanted me to live, even if it meant you wouldn’t.

The wind carried no answer. I knew I would never come back here again.

But I did wonder while I was on the Ferryman’s boat back to Comodoro Rivadavia – after everything is finished, will the White Giant stay there, or come hunt after [me](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThalassianOrder/)?
