Hey all. Posting to try and get some comfort or advise I guess. Something's been happening for a few nights. I don't know, maybe it's not a huge deal, but it's really started to make me feel like something bad is going to happen.


It started last week - I remember the first time most vividly, because it was just so odd. I was waking up around 5:30am for a rare early meeting, and was shuffling toward the light switch when I was stopped in my tracks. There was light coming from under my closet door.


I stood there for a second in the dark, this close to rubbing my eyes like a cartoon as I tried to process the idea with my half awake brain. I know it's not nearly the worst thing someone can wake up to. It was hardly anything at all. But it was such an unsettling image, and it gave me this feeling. Like something had happened right before I woke up. Like someone had been in front of my face right before I opened my eyes.


It was strange, but I really had to get ready to leave, so I went with the most rational explanation: it must've been during the daytime that I forgot to turn the closet light off before closing the door, and it produced little enough light that I didn't notice it was still on when it got dark out. Though I'm pretty sure I would have noticed a light disrupting the pitch black I sleep in, I just opened the closet to check for boogeymen, turned the light off, and closed it. You never suspect much the first time something strange happens.


I got reminded of it a few times throughout the day, like when I have a word stuck in my head. Like when my brain brings the word back to the forefront of my consciousness, I remember it's been there a while, just not noticeable the whole time.


The second time made more of an impression.


It was a couple nights later, and I think it was the low hum of the light being on that woke me rather than the light itself, although it would've been bright enough. It's a big old fluorescent light, like you see in those depressing offices, so it's got a pretty loud buzz compared to the mostly imperceptible hum regular lights produce.


As the sound slowly wormed its way from my subconscious to my conscious mind, I started stirring, but didn't realize what the source was until I opened my eyes in the type of struggle that comes with bleary eyes meeting a wide open closet door, light beaming in the darkness.


This time I bolted into an upright position in bed, heart stuttering. Again, I had that feeling. Like someone had been nose-to-nose with me seconds before. Like I had missed something, and was trying to put together the pieces with a paranoid and tired brain. There was absolutely no explaining it away as overlooked this time. There was no way in hell I would have fallen asleep with light beaming directly onto my face like that, almost in a perfect spotlight. I sat there frozen by probably baseless paranoia for a couple minutes, just staring at the contents of my closet, before working up the courage to again walk up to my closet at an ungodly hour, flip the light switch, and close the door.


When I got to the closet this time, it felt like I'd crossed a line - what had I done wrong? Why was my stomach dropping like a weight? It was the kind of cold you can only know from doing something irreversible. Did it know? How could it know what I've done?


I shut the door faster this time, and all but booked it back to bed. I slept with my head under the covers like a little kid.


The third time - tonight.


The hum of electricity. My upper body felt warm, but my legs were cold. My legs were the first thing I saw as I woke up. They were still mostly illuminated by the light coming from above me, even though they were sticking out into the darkness of my room. And around me, bins of winter clothes. It took me a few seconds to realize that I had woken up with my body half inside the closet.


Like I had been dragged here.


A coldness started in my spine and spread throughout me, like fear was some physical thing moving inside my nervous system, spreading like flame on a pine tree.


I felt exposed. Not only because was I singled out under a light in an otherwise dark room, but again. that feeling that I'd been asleep when I shouldn't have. And like someone was now... not behind me but, above me, watching, Her clothes are still buried in here somewhere.


It must know what I did. Is this some form of punishment? Is this thing just going to fuck with me harmlessly every few nights for eternity? If it's punishing me, is it demonic or holy? What's the fucking end game here??


Is it....her? Could she have realized I was the one who did it?
