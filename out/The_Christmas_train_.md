Part One

The night was colder than any I could remember. Frost coated the windows, turning the world outside into a blurry, crystalline landscape. I was lying in bed, watching my breath curl into the air, when I heard it: the sound of a train whistle, clear and haunting, cutting through the silence.  

At first, I thought I must be dreaming. There was no train station near my house, no tracks for miles. Yet the whistle came again, closer this time, followed by the faint clatter of wheels on steel. Curiosity pulled me from my bed. I slipped into my coat and boots, ignoring the way the cold bit at my skin, and crept outside.  

The sight stopped me in my tracks.  

A sleek, black locomotive stood at the edge of my yard, its glossy surface reflecting the pale moonlight. It didn’t belong here, there were no tracks, yet it hovered slightly off the ground, as though the snow itself was holding it aloft. Strings of multicolored Christmas lights wrapped around the cars, twinkling like stars, and faint music drifted from within, soft and alluring.  

The train seemed alive, humming with an energy that made my heart race. A single word was scrawled in ornate gold lettering across the engine’s side: Noelium.

The door to one of the cars slid open, and a conductor stepped out, dressed in a deep red uniform trimmed with gold. His hat sat low over his face, casting a shadow that obscured his features, but his voice was smooth and inviting.  

“Well, now,” he said, tipping his hat slightly. “What are you doing out here in the cold, young one?”  

“I heard the whistle,” I said, my voice trembling.  

He nodded, his smile just visible beneath the brim of his hat. “Then you’ve been chosen. The Noelium only comes for those with the spirit of Christmas in their hearts.”  

My chest swelled with a mix of pride and excitement. The spirit of Christmas? that was me! I loved everything about it: the lights, the music, the presents under the tree. This train must be something special, like Santa’s sleigh come to life.  

“Where does it go?” I asked.  

“To the heart of the North Pole,” the conductor replied. “A place of wonders beyond your wildest dreams.” He extended a gloved hand toward me. “Will you come aboard?”  

I hesitated, the excitement warring with a flicker of unease. But when I glanced back at my dark, quiet house, I felt an inexplicable pull toward the train. The music grew louder, more enchanting, as if it were calling just for me.  

Before I knew it, I was stepping forward, my hand slipping into his. The conductor’s grip was firm and cold, like ice, but he helped me up with surprising ease. As the door slid shut behind me, the train jolted to life, its whistle piercing the night as it surged forward into the darkness.  

The car I entered was like something out of a dream. Garland and tinsel hung from the ceiling, shimmering in the soft glow of flickering lanterns. A long table ran down the center, laden with gingerbread houses, steaming mugs of cocoa, and candy canes as tall as me. Other children sat around the table, their faces glowing with wonder as they chatted and laughed.  

“Help yourself,” the conductor said, gesturing toward the feast. “Everything here is for you.”  

I hesitated, scanning the faces of the other children. Something about them seemed...off. Their smiles were too wide, their laughter too loud. They weren’t eating or drinking, just sitting there, as if waiting for something.  

Still, the aroma of the cocoa was irresistible. I poured myself a cup and sipped, the warmth spreading through me like a hug. For a moment, the unease melted away, replaced by the comforting buzz of holiday cheer.  

“See?” the conductor said, his voice close to my ear. “The Noelium is a place of joy. A place to let go of all your worries and embrace the magic of Christmas.”  

But as I looked closer at the decorations, a strange detail caught my eye. The baubles on the tree weren’t glass. They  were something else, something pale and waxy. My stomach turned as I realized they were tiny faces, frozen in expressions of terror.  

The children at the table turned toward me in unison, their wide eyes unblinking. “Stay with us,” they said in eerie harmony, their voices hollow and distant. “It’s Christmas forever here.”  

The conductor’s smile widened, his teeth gleaming like shards of ice. “Forever,” he echoed.  

The cocoa in my hands suddenly felt heavy, its sweetness cloying and suffocating. I dropped the cup, and it shattered on the floor, the liquid inside seeping out like blood.  

“I want to go home,” I said, my voice barely audible.  

The conductor’s face darkened, and for the first time, I saw his eyes beneath the brim of his hat—cold, empty pits that seemed to swallow the light. “Home?” he said, his tone mocking. “You are home now, child. The Noelium never lets its passengers go.”  

My breath hitched as the train lurched, the cheerful music warping into a discordant cacophony. The other children began to laugh, their voices rising into shrill, unnatural cackles. The decorations around me seemed to close in, the garlands twisting like snakes, the ornaments watching me with their frozen, terrified eyes.  

The train was no magical Christmas wonder. It was a trap.  

And I was caught.
