I never believed in things like ghosts or haunted houses. My childhood was full of stories about the supernatural, but I wrote them off as just stories. I wanted explanations. A ghost in a house? Probably a draft. A shadow in a corner? An overactive imagination. I didn’t feel anything when I stepped into old buildings. The creaks and drafts—they were just aging wood and rotting plaster.

That changed when I moved into 107 Ashford Lane.

It wasn’t meant to be permanent. Just a temporary place while I searched for something more permanent. The landlord, Mrs. Hathaway, was elderly and peculiar. She spoke in riddles and avoided eye contact. But the price was right, and the location peaceful. So I didn’t ask questions.

Constructed in the early 1900s, the mansion was ancient. The hallway wallpaper ripped at the edges, and the flooring creaked. It had charm. I didn’t mind the small, dark rooms or the faded wooden banister that groaned with age. It felt lived in, even if the life there felt distant.

But there was one thing that made me uneasy.

A door.

It was in the living room, near the fireplace, hidden behind a faded velvet curtain. At first, it looked like part of the wall—unremarkable, blending with the plaster. But something was wrong.

I couldn’t explain it. No handle, no lock—just a smooth surface. You wouldn't notice it if you were unaware of its existence. I inquired about it with Mrs. Hathaway.

“Oh, that door,” she said, smiling tight and unsettling. “It’s not really a door. You won’t open it anyway.”

I pressed for more, but she shook her head and excused herself. I didn’t push. She was eccentric.

Still, the door stayed in my mind, like a whisper. I could feel it beckoning to me even while I wasn't in the living room. On other evenings, when I couldn't sleep, I would wake up and my gaze would go to that location—where the door ought to have been.

For weeks, I ignored it. I unpacked, settled in, adjusted to the creaks and groans of the house. But the feeling didn’t fade. If anything, it grew.

One evening, while reading in the living room, I noticed something strange. The curtain was moving.

No breeze—no open windows. The fabric swayed, almost as if something was pressing against it from behind.

I set my book down, heart pounding, and stood to investigate. Slowly, I pulled the curtain aside. I expected to find a draft or maybe a trapped rodent. But instead, I saw it.

The door was gone.

The wall was jagged, cracked, the edges splintered like something had torn through. Inside was pitch blackness, a void that seemed to stretch forever. The air around it felt thick, alive, pulsating with strange energy.

I staggered back. How? I had seen that door. A flat, solid surface. And now, there was only a hole.

I looked around the living room. No sign of anything that could explain it. No sign of someone entering the house, no marks on the floor. Just the hole—beckoning.

I had to know what was inside.

Why? I couldn’t say. But I felt compelled. Before my mind could react, my body moved, and I was left standing on the threshold, gazing into the darkness.

I stepped forward.

And I fell.

I don’t know how far or for how long, but when I landed, it was like I had fallen through reality itself. I wasn’t in the living room anymore. I was somewhere else, somewhere wrong.

I was on the floor, dizzy, head spinning. The air smelled metallic, decayed, and the ground beneath me was cold, slick with oily substance. I stood, realizing I wasn’t in a house. The walls twisted, warped at impossible angles like a funhouse mirror distorted by time. The floor was slick, covered in liquid, and the light flickered, struggling to stay alive.

The further I moved, the more I felt it. Something was watching me. The air pressed in from all sides. Then, I heard it.

Footsteps.

I turned, but no one was there. I took another step, and the footsteps echoed again.

I wasn’t alone.

Even though I had no idea where to go, I had the impulse to travel farther into the shadows. I stumbled through strange, shifting halls. Unnatural beat pumped through the walls, and faint, faraway voices were heard whispering. Despite my inability to comprehend them, I was aware that I wasn't intended to be here.

Then, I found it.

The door.

It wasn’t the same door from the living room, but it was similar. A wooden door, intricately carved, standing alone in the void. No handle, no lock—just a smooth, ornate surface. It called to me, like the first one.

I knew, without doubt, this was where I had to go.

I reached out, touched the door, and instantly, I was pulled. Not opened. Consumed. It dragged me through it in an instant.

I fell again.

I was back in the living room when I awoke.

But something had changed. The room felt different—hollow, as if waiting. The door was back, the curtain covering it. But I knew something had shifted. The door wasn’t just a door anymore.

It was a doorway.

To what? I didn’t know. But I felt its pull, stronger than ever. And I knew, with terrifying certainty, it would never let me go.
