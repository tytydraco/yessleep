Balancing a bag on my shoulder, I let the screen door shut behind me. Its response was a thud with the carelessness a town like Eastwood deserved; it was a small Chicago neighborhood, but if it weren’t for the Back the Blue signs posted in every front lawn, you’d have never guessed. It was a picturesque piece of suburbia with taxes that could only be justified by city limits. A classic from the shelf of the “midwest experience”: kids loitering in parking lots and getting drunk after robbing Jewel Osco.

The streets were quiet at night except for the reverberating cackle of a gaggle of teens and the distant horn of a cargo train making its way across the seams of the city. When I was a kid, I would imagine that I could hear the distant howl of a werewolf under the full moon, shedding its school uniform and reveling in its own rambunctiousness.

The suffocating conformity of white-picket boundaries and human skin was why I needed to go. Why I spent the entirety of my life clawing at the door, ready to leave. It was an ever-present personification of ambition traded for certainty. I, on the other hand, was frothing at the mouth with atychiphobia and visions of artistic splendor.

I wanted to write. I craved creation; I dreamt of building a world so lucid you’d think the pages were made of glass. I had found it near impossible to spark life into literature when I’d hadn’t had a single original experience my entire life. I felt out of place in my own home, a psychological suburb in between city and cattle pasture. I dreaded falling into mundane uniformity, subjecting myself to years of endless teasing and the occasional hurling of a homophobic slur. I was a perpetual eyesore in the crisply manicured scenery.

My solution? A roadtrip to the northeast United States in a disheveled mini-van I’d found abandoned at my uncle’s scrap yard. Nineteen and not ready to commit to a college, I packed up the bare essentials and loaded a whole load of mediocrity into a van. I had exactly half of an idea of what I was going to do. The plan, or lack thereof, was to stay out “there” for a year, rotating between sleeping on a thin mattress in the back of the car and leasing whatever shacks I could find in Appalachia. Looking back, it was naive of me to have thought so assuredly that this whimsical road trip would give me the material I needed to become a best-selling author. Or at least one that wasn’t “appreciated in my time” in forty-five years.

In response to my father’s worries that I would be in danger traversing both the interstate and the wilderness alone, I recruited my favorite flea bag to come with me. He was a fellow college-age kid with a lust for adventure and a disdain for company. He also wasn’t particularly excited to go back to school after having just escaped AP Calculus. A perfect candidate. 

I tossed my bag into the backseat of the Honda and made my way to Warren’s place to pick him up in the city proper. I looked in disdain at the scenery as I navigated towards the Dan Ryan Expressway. If you’re not in the aesthetic vintage neighborhoods or along the glistening river, Chicago really is a shithole.

I finally made it to his mom’s place and laid on the horn. Might as well. I saw a brief flash of a middle finger through the window and felt the jostling of the car as two heavy bags were offloaded into the trunk. Once we were both comfortably seated, we turned onto the interstate and settled in for the 20 hour trip.

“Morning, sunshine” I offered, but he gave me a shallow glare in return.

“All year to go backpacking, and you wake me up at 6 a.m.” I only offer a shake of the head in return. 

My mind wandered as we left the concrete jungle for an endless ocean of wheat and corn. The Midwest doesn’t get enough credit for its scenery. People will tell you it's all the same: flat and dull. But, I  find something calming about it. Rolling waves of blonde with little red cow sheds sprinkled about. Its endlessness gives me the same sort of optimism that standing on the beach does. It’s no Atlantic, but it has its charms.

When we passed into New England and the Pennsylvanian landscapes shifted towards jagged skylines, I stared in exhausted awe at the scenery surrounding me. I would have never been able to imagine this kind of beauty in a thousand summers spent at home. I turned my gaze to the boy sleeping soundly to my right. I smiled a bit; I don’t think many people would place us in the same category of crazy, but here we were: a pair that worked together as surprisingly as cheese and peanut butter. 

I threw an arm into his chest, startling him from what couldn’t have been a very restful sleep cramped between the dashboard and the headrest. 

“Find me a motel; anything with a bed before I fall asleep at the wheel,” I ordered as he pulled his phone out from under him. Unfortunately, Warren never got his driver’s license, so it had fallen upon myself to drive us halfway across the country while he got to doze off sporadically. I turned my attention back towards the windows. We were encompassed by thick trees on all sides looming over us like overprotective parents.

“No beds around here, not for another hour’s way, anyway,” he replied after a few minutes. The news was accompanied by a pitying glance. 

“So you *want* me to send us careening off a mountainside?”

“There’s a campsite at the next exit. Pull off and we can roll out the bed in the back.” I let out a groan. The back of a van can only be so comfortable. I didn’t have much of a choice, though, so I peeled off the spindly main road and parked the car in one of the designated spots. The two of us feasted on canned Spaghetti-Os and root beer on the van roof before being shooed back inside by the rumble of impending rain. 

Sitting atop a pile of blankets and pillows, we started to wind down. The drowsiness of early summer and a day’s worth of driving had caught up to us. I braced myself to wake up in 5 short hours to continue driving, stretching out as much as possible.

“Beau,” he whispered.

“What?”

“Goodnight.”

“That’s it?” 

“Goodnight.”

“Goodnight Warren,” I replied, a bit confused by the whole interaction. 

That was the last thing I remember before waking up with a fright. I sat up and spun around, trying to figure out what had set me uneasy. It didn’t help that the woods seemed to absorb all semblance of light. I listened to the piddling of thick rain as it landed on the tin roof.

Suddenly, there was a brutal knocking on the sides of the van, as if some rabid bear was trying to pry its way inside. Gasping for breath, I reached for a light. I switched on the “door open” lights in an attempt to scare off whatever animal was outside. 

Illuminated through the dingy windows was a silhouette so unlike that of a bear’s I nearly pissed myself in shock. I noticed that the thing had stopped banging at the doors and was instead standing statue-still, leering at me. I shoved myself backwards into the opposing wall, praying it didn’t know that glass was easier to break than metal and cried out. I grabbed for an old softball bat I’d hoped I’d been too lazy to toss out.

And just like that, it was gone. 

I was heaving in an attempt to calm myself down when I realized that Warren was nowhere to be found. He wasn’t in his spot on the cot where we’d fallen asleep. The daze of sleep was completely drawn from me as I realized that Warren was outside with a ravenous wild animal. I only then conveniently remembered about the shitty pocketknife on my keyring and burst from the back of the van to find him. I shone my flashlight all around me as if it would protect me like salt.

“Warren!”

“Warren! Where are you?” I was begging him to answer. I couldn’t bear the thought that he’d gone out for a piss and been snatched by something while I slept.

“Warr?” I whirled around suddenly at the sound of a car door opening. I watched in disbelief as he stepped out of the passenger’s side door, looking at me with concern. I fell back a step before running into him, scolding him the entire time.

“I thought you died, you piece of shit,” I yelled. “What the fuck?” 

As the moon’s light reflected across a thousand droplets of water scattered across the van, he explained that he’d found the seats more comfortable than the back of the car. I started laughing at my own absurdity, thinking he’d gotten killed before I remembered the shadow outside the van.

I tried to tell him what happened, but he stared back at me skeptically. 

“You’re telling me that on your trip to get inspiration for your next horror novel… you were attacked by a ghoul in the forest” he asked, reasonably. “You had a bad dream, Beau. Working yourself up again.” 

I sighed in response. He’s compelling.

“Yeah.” He shook his head and chuckled.

“Go back to bed. We’ll push back our alarm for a few hours so you can sleep this off.”

The next morning, I awoke with a gasp, remembering the night prior. I flipped over and saw Warren passed out beside me. Authors shouldn't keep themselves up at night with their own stories. The effects of listening to horror podcasts all night were catching up to me.

After heating up some soggy hotdogs and kicking Warren awake, we set out on the road again. The nice thing about not having a destination is that you’re never behind schedule. We were now veering right on our path and quickly approaching the West Virginian border.

“Wanna go to Harper’s Ferry?” I asked excitedly. My AP U.S. History class flitted to my mind at the name. I expected clinical sarcasm in return, but I hadn’t accounted for Warren’s inclination for flora. He responded quickly.

“Looking for directions.” 

“We should camp proper. Pull out the tent and build a fire,” I offered, knowing it would be a welcome change from van life.

“Just promise not to shit yourself again,” he shot at me.

I rolled my eyes at him, realizing that I will never live down my episode from last night. I wish I had more interesting notes to report during the climactic breaks in this story, but you can only say so much about the freeway and “10 Questions to Ask on Long Car Rides.”

We finally managed to find the official campgrounds for the park and pull in. We slid the tent and the night’s gear out from the back of the trunk, strapping the worst of it to our backs. I snagged a map from a post nearby as we walked into the underbrush. It was surprisingly cool despite the June weather, and I was grateful for the shade. I led the way through the winding paths, referencing the map to an array of multicolored trail markers. 

It was so surreal being surrounded by wildlife older than three generations of my ancestors. I’d always dreamed of seeing the Appalachian trail, drawn in by its folklore and grandiosity. And this was it. A lifelong dream spread out thousands of acres around me.

“Here’s the designated camping area,” I called behind me. Warren was a few feet behind me picking up some variety of dogwood leaves. Only a few  yards ahead, I threw down the tarp and spokes for tonight’s tent. I started to assemble the tent as the sun began to set. In the meantime, I called out to Warren.

“Hey, go get some firewood. I want to get that ramen boiling.” In response, I received an ominous salute and the image of his back wandering into the brush.

After he returned, we arranged the wood into a pyre and set our pot of water on top, ready to boil. We sat back against our packs staring up at the sky. 

“Warren.”

“Mm?” he hummed in reply.

“What are you going to do when we get back?” I looked up at him, wondering.

“What do you mean?” He seemed put out, but I wasn’t sure why.

“You just never-” I was cut off by Warren jumping up abruptly, patting down his pants like they were on fire. 

“Shit. I think I dropped my phone when I was getting wood.” He seemed panicked. Just then, a few drops of water began to fall from the sky. Just as I had the thought, Warren stole it from my lips.

“It’s not supposed to rain tonight.” I looked back at him baffled. 

"It's not a big deal, Warr, we have a tent for a reason.” The look he gave me wasn’t one I’d seen before. 

“I need to go find my phone before it gets soaked.” And with that, he sprinted off into the dark. I got up to follow him, but I wasn't stupid enough to get myself turned around in a pitch-black forest chasing someone I couldn’t see.

I checked my watch and decided that if he didn’t find his way back within 90 minutes, I would call Park Services to help me find him. In the meantime, I gave up on my ramen and retreated to the tent to escape the thick mountain rain.

I sat through exactly 93 minutes of torture waiting for him to come back. And the worst part? The first sign of him was screaming. The most bloodcurdling cries I have ever heard.

I shot out of the tent, wielding the biggest flashlight we’d brought on the trip and my dinky keyring knife. I couldn’t imagine what he’d have gotten himself into at this hour. He screamed again and I ran towards the sound, disregarding any movie warning. I finally understood what pushed those death-bound characters into danger.

“Warren! Warren, where the fuck are you?” I yelled into the void. I continued running through the brambles, catching my sweatshirt on crooked branches until I burst through the treeline and into a clearing. 

I trip on the coarse turf on the woods’ edge and palm the ground in front of me. I was soaked to the bone, the thick wild grass had absorbed the torrent from the heavens, transferring it to my sleeves and socks. I could hardly see at this point, blinded by deadly night and rivers of water sloughing off my face.

There was a third cry, this time directly in front of me. I pulled myself to my feet, shining my flashlight at the ground defensively. My heart dropped at the sight laid out before me: Warren covered in blood and thick Virginia mud. I struggled to focus on him  with the rain pooling in my eyes.

I dropped to my knees in an attempt to assess the damage, but my nerves were fried. I shook his shoulders and tried to get his attention. He looked up wearily before his eyes suddenly shot open and he tried to push himself off of me.

“Hey, it’s me. You’re okay. It’s okay,” I tried to calm him down before he tore himself further on the briars, but he wouldn’t still himself. He used a nearby downed tree to lift himself back onto his feet. I couldn’t comprehend his inability to let me help him. I took a step towards him; he must have been in some kind of panic-induced shock.

I watched in horror as he doubled over, stumbling backwards into the brush. 

“Beau,” he rasped, “I need you to go back to the tent.” He said it so matter-of-factly. Like it was a simple instruction intended to make my night more convenient.

I expected him to pass out momentarily from blood loss, but instead I stood, shock-still as something came over him. He fell to his palms, mirroring  my previous slip, and convulsed brutally. I was torn between actions. I didn’t have any cell service, and my first aid supplies were at camp and I was certain I wouldn’t be able to find the clearing again in the thick night.

I watched as his arms elongated into spindly spider-like limbs and his spine curved in a way that was more that of a hyena than human. I watched until my best man was laying in a pile of his own flesh and blood, ripping into his own skin as if \*trying\* to cause a hemorrhage. 

I fell backward in disgust before him, and he looked up at me for the first time, snapped from his inner struggle. I thought I saw some sort of apology in his marred grimace before I screamed bloody murder and turned away.

Any sense of familiarity was snuffed as he approached me, looming over me with ripped clothes and ghoulish skin slick with rain-water. He snarled at me, rearing to sever my throat, but I rolled to my right instinctively. I shoved myself up to my knees and booked it towards the van, cutting past the tent. I used my flashlight to guide me, but it did little more than give me the vague pretense of an advantage.

With every step I took I could feel the space between us shrinking at a rate unsustainable to my escape. I could feel wind behind me and my smoke-shrunken lungs struggling to carry me. 

I whipped out my pocket knife and turned around, wedging it into his cheek in a feral attempt to flee. I heard a shriek behind me but continued towards the tree line and four-wheeled safety. I saw the van in the distance and fumbled with the key-fob in my pocket, unlocking the doors as I approached. I swung the door open and threw myself inside,  crushing the lock button as soon as I could. I watched as Warren stalked dirt from the trees in front of me and stood right in front of the dingy hood.

I turned on my high beams and regretfully reversed out of the parking lot as fast as possible, but was met by resistance as I realized that the storm had formed what was effectively a mote barring me from my freedom. Desperate to preserve my only way out of these woods, I put the car into park and prepared myself for the night’s exaggerated horrors.

I sat resigned in the driver's seat as he approached me, ragged and angry. The headlights illuminated large gashes across his abdomen and his grotesque frame. I flicked through my scary-story catalogue and thought of a hundred humanoid encounters, which was entirely useless.

He walked up to the opposite window and started banging on the glass, harder and harder until the van shook with fury. I saw my shank protruding from his cheek, still there from my prior assault. I cried into my knees, hopeless. 

The glass began to splinter and give and I could feel shards of shrapnel piercing the soft skin of my cheeks as the water streaming down the windows began pooling at its sills. I had the juvenile thought that maybe I could reach some part of him “deep down” that would fight his nocturnal urges, but this wasn’t a Grimm Fairy Tale. There was no rephrasing of  “this isn’t you” that could save me now. If I hadn’t sacrificed my only weapon for a speedy getaway, I still don’t think I would have had the nerve to wield it against his fully-illuminated form.

Call it luck, but I saw the first few wisps of summer sunlight peak through a forested ceiling. Having the realization simultaneously, “Warren” abandoned his pursuit of my blood in exchange for a dash towards the greater forest. In a wave of relief and twenty-four hours without sleep, I lost consciousness against the steering wheel.

I awoke for the second morning in a row with a major headache and the faint idea that I should be having a panic attack. I sat up, triggering the horn and opened the door to my left. I practically fell out of the car in an attempt to reorient myself. Despite notions of common sense, I grabbed the most menacing stick in my periphery and headed out towards the tent. 

Along the trail, I remember all the places where Warren had stopped to examine a species or sketched a leaf-eating beetle in his field journal. I started to jog as I tried to make it back as quickly as possible. As the blue tarp came into view, so did a silhouette against the thin material.

I ran towards Warren, seeing that there was a large gash in the side of his face and a worrying lack of cloth on his body. Checking for breath, I found my emergency kit and mentally prepared myself to give someone stitches. When I turned back towards him, he was slightly conscious and looking at me with a frightening worry. He grabbed my wrist and I had to focus really hard not to flinch away, remembering the night prior. Before I could reassure him of my sewing abilities, he whispered two words.

“I’m sorry.”

“Apologize to me after you’re not about to die.”
