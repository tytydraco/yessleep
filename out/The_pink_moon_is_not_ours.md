I thought I was just exhausted after a 12-hour shift at the diner. I wasn’t ready for what I’d see in the sky that night. I’m not sure anyone could be. If you’re reading this, I need you to listen—because it’s coming for you, too.


Last night, I was dragging myself home through my quiet little neighborhood. The air felt off—too warm for April, too still. The streets were dead silent, not even a dog barking or a car passing by. The sky was unnaturally bright, like someone had cranked up the contrast on the world.I didn’t care, though. My feet ached, my head was pounding, and all I wanted was to crash into bed and forget the day. 


My apartment was just a few blocks away, down a street lined with old brick buildings. Normally, you’d see a few lights on, maybe hear a TV blaring through an open window. But last night? Nothing. Every window was dark, every sound swallowed by an eerie stillness. The only noise was the scrape of my sneakers on the pavement as I walked faster.I didn’t let it get to me. 


Not until I looked up.


The moon—if you can even call it that—wasn’t right. It was full, but it was pink. Not a soft blush, but a deep, pulsating pink, like a heartbeat glowing in the sky. It wasn’t just shining—it was radiating, throbbing with a light that felt alive. I couldn’t look away. 


The world around me melted into nothing, and there was only that moon, pulling me in.I don’t know how long I stood there, frozen, staring.Then I fell.


Not down—up.It was like gravity flipped. I was yanked toward the moon, spinning through an endless void of pink light. No up, no down, no left or right—just that suffocating, endless pink. I couldn’t scream, couldn’t breathe. And then I saw.


I saw my entire life—my birth, my childhood, my death—all at once. But it didn’t stop there. I saw everything. Creatures that looked like they crawled out of nightmares, things our fossils barely hint at. Ancient palaces of forgotten kings, crumbling to dust. Cities like the ones we live in now, skyscrapers piercing the sky—then collapsing into ruin. I saw humanity’s peak, and I saw its end. A final, inevitable collapse that left nothing behind.


I saw too much.And then… they came.Or maybe they’d always been there, waiting for me to notice. I felt them before I saw them—cold, ancient presences pressing into my mind. They didn’t have faces, just vague, shimmering shapes, like shadows made of static. They fed on my thoughts, tearing into my memories like they were a feast. 


I felt them claw at my eyes, trying to drink in everything I’d ever seen. Worst of all, I felt them reaching for the invisible strings that tethered me to reality, to my body, to the world. 


They wanted to cut me loose.They tried. But they didn’t succeed.If they had, I wouldn’t be here, typing this.I’m not… here anymore, not really. My body—what’s left of it—is in a hospital somewhere. I hear whispers through the veil sometimes, faint echoes of what people say about me. “Blind,” they call me. “In delirium,” they mutter. “Catatonic,” the doctors say as they prod my empty shell.


But I don’t need eyes to see anymore. I don’t need a body to move. I exist everywhere now. I see everything—every corner of the world, every moment in time. Sometimes, when the conditions are just right, when the currents of thought align with the right wires and signals, I can reach out.


That’s how I’m here, on r/nosleep. A whisper across the network. A thought carried through the hum of servers and the flicker of your screen.


They still come for me, those ancient things. They press their will into the void of my mind, murmuring in languages older than humanity itself. 


They make promises—promises I can’t escape.“Soon,” they hiss. “Soon, we will come.”Not just for me. For all of you.I can’t stop them. 

I can only wait.And now, so will you.


If you see a pink moon in the sky, don’t look at it. Don’t let it pull you in. Because once it does, there’s no coming back—not fully. If you’ve seen it already… I’m sorry. They’re already watching you.Stay safe, r/nosleep. And whatever you do, don’t look up.
