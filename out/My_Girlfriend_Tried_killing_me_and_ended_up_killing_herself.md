Hello, My name is Aiden, I'm 17 years old and today I'm going to share my Story with you about my ex-girlfriend That tried to kill me.


(Hope you enjoy it!)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

A few months ago, I was in a relationship with a girl called Catherine. I met her through an online dating app called Tinder. I thought that app was just a catfish or some useless app, But I suddenly got a notification saying "Congratulations!, You got a match with Catherine". I checked her profile and saw her pics and bio. She was beautiful ngl and from her bio, she seemed friendly and charming. I decided to go and text her. As any normal dude who just got accepted by a girl. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------



(I said to her:)

"Hey there, I'm Aiden!, How are you?"

(She replied instantly and said:)

"Hey ahaha, I'm good!".


After greeting each other, I decided to keep the conversation and know more about her, So I asked her where is she from and why did she join that dating up. I asked what's her favourite food, places to go to, favorite pets and music.


(She would reply saying)

"Oh Umm, I'm from Miami, I joined tinder cuz I'm bored yk and wanna meet new people and create connections. I love cats and my favourite places to go to are parks and Cafés!".


(I would reply to her saying)

"Oh that's so nice, you really seem nice and a good-hearted person."
---------------------------------------------------------------------
After keeping the conversation like that for hours and by hours I literally mean we probably were chatting for 2-3 hours straight. Talking about things we love and hate, How is life teaching us things, Our favourite hobbies and movies. And of course knowing each other more and more.
 Not gonna lie, I really liked her from the way of her talking and expressing.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
After hours of chatting, She sent me her snapchat username and her Instagram too in-case we want to call or chat there instead of tinder.

Weeks passed and we got closer and closer. Until one day, She said she's coming to my neighborhood in London. I was so happy!. I will be closer to her and might even meet her in person. I was waiting for that day to come by soon.

Days passed, And she finally arrived in my neighborhood. She said she wanted to meet me in-person. I totally agreed, I even told her we could go eat or drink something. 

"She said:"
Ahahaha, Sure I'm down!.
------------------------------------------

After going to a nearby café and ordering coffee and some sandwiches. We went to a park, where we saw beautiful ducks and the beautiful sun-set announcing it's arrival.

It was so majestical and she was perfect...
---------------------------------------------------------------------

After days of chatting and meeting and face-timing each other. I decided to shoot my shot and tell her that I got feelings for her.

"I said:"

Hey Catey!, I wanted to tell you something reallyyyyyyy important.


"She was like:"

Oooooo, tell me.

I shot my shot and said to her that I got feelings for her and want to grow our relationship more than just friends.


She was nervous at first and stayed quiet for a while but then "she replied:"

"Aiden, I have the same feelings towards you and I wanted to make a move but I thought of staying longer before confessing to you, And by seeing you now and confessing to me that you have feelings for me...I TOTALLY AGREE!"
---------------------------------------------------------------------



I was so happy and almost ended up crying due to the overload of happiness and dopamine flowing inside of me.
And Yes, We Officially became together in a lovely relationship.
 (That turned into a nightmare...)
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
So, After 2 months of us dating, Weird things started to happen suddenly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
For an example: My girlfriend became depressed and so anxious about her life and about other people, she would even talk to me while being sad 24/7.

"She was never like that before..."
----------------------------------------------------------
I wanted to know what's happening around her, So I asked her if her family is treating her good or someone threatening her or something.

She said to me that her step-dad was a drunkie and a gambler. And he would hit her, even touch her and rape her while she was sleeping.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

I told her I could come over, Have a word with her famil-. Before I could even finish the word family. She shouted at me and warned me to never come to her home.

I felt that something is off or something is going on with her...

I decided to talk to her brother and ask him the same questions.

He never answered my calls or met me in person. Which was so off and weird.

"Why the heck wouldn't her brother answer me or even meet me in person".
*I said to myself*

---------------------------------------------------------------------

After many tries of calming my gf and trying to contact her family to see what's going on. Cate started to talk about suicide and about ending her suffering. I suddenly realized that I'm dealing with a positive suicide case right now. If I don't pay attention to what I say. She would end up killing herself.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

I would always talk to her about leaving these thoughts and to do something she loves like going to parks or Cafés.

"She would reply to that with a loud-angry tone like:"


"You aren't in charge of me, Fuck off, Leave me alone, I hate you."
---------------------------------------------------------------------


For me, her words kinda hurted me, That's literally my Girlfriend telling me to fuck off...


I told her that if she doesn't cooperate and let me help her, I'm going to take her to a therapist or something 


As soon as she had heard the word therapist. 

She literally went mad at me and almost hit me.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

I left her for some days, While I was thinking how to help her. I would ask my family or friends about her situation and how to deal with it. They would say they don't know how to deal with her and that she now resembles a threat to me and to herself.

I didn't believe their words and decided to let her cool down for some days...
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Until one day and night, I was alone at home, doing my assignments and getting ready to sleep. After I finished my work and went straight to bed. Her words would just haunt me in my head. As If she's in my room screaming and shouting at me...

I went straight to bed and decided to check on her tomorrow morning...


At 2:50 Am
-------------------

I woke up to get a glass of water, While I was coming out of bed, I got a very weird message on my phone. It was my doorbell camera system telling me:


"Someone is at your door."
---------------------------------------------------------------------

"Who the fuck would come at this time in this cold-snowy night?".
I said to myself while trying to gain my consciousness.


I decided to go check the door, I opened it and..There was nothing at my door. Literally nothing except cars driving by and snow falling.

I closed and locked the doors and went to get my cup of water, Before I could even open the fridge door and inch.

I got another notification on my Phone...
---------------------------------------------------------------------

"Someone is at your door".


I could swear, I checked my door 3 minutes ago. I decided to open the camera system instead of going to the door again.


I saw something very disturbing that's going to haunt me for years.
-----------------------‐---------------------------------------------

It was my girlfriend, Holding a kitchen-Knife and is hiding near the door-step bush.


I couldn't believe my eyes and decided to turn my Alexa into intruder-mode in-case if she breaks in. All of my doors and windows get locked. I turned my Alexa on and enabled the intruder-mode. 

I went to my room running locking the door behind me. I took my breath and decided to watch her from the camera system.


She was still there.. but this time she was staring at my camera directly while a note saying 

  "I can see you" with a creepy smiley face.


I was literally scared of going down and facing her. I decided to call her family and tell them about what's happening right now.


"They never answered".
---------------------------------------------------------------------

I kept checking the cameras and thinking about how to deal with my crazy girlfriend outside my door.

I fell asleep as I was so scared and my mind was already exhausted from work.

Of course you would ask me,

"Why didn't you call the cops?".

Well, I couldn't as she was my girlfriend and I really thought I could help her without bringing the police and using force on her,  "I was terrifyingly wrong."



"The next Day"
---------------------------


I woke up to Sirens blaring across my whole neighborhood. As if the whole Fire, ambulance and police departments are here.


I called one of my neighbors asking them what's happening outside.

He Said only three words that shocked me for life.

" It's your girlfriend...". And hang up on me.


I immediately grabbed my clothes and ran down to her family's house. When I arrived there was alot of people and police officers and paramedics on-site.

Of course I couldn't enter as the police were guarding the area around her home.

I asked one of the people standing what's wrong. No one of them answered me and just gave me a long stare and looked back at the house. 


"After 10 mins"
---------------------------

Cate's Step-Dad came out shouting at me saying:


"You killed my girl! , I will fucking kill you!" In a loud- exhausted tone.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I couldn't believe or understand what he said until I saw.. The Paramedics pulling out Cate with her hands covered in her blood..

I literally cried and ran towards her fallen body in the ambulance.

"She had cut her wrist with a knife".Said one of the paramedics.

I couldn't believe my eyes, My little girl ended her life. I kept crying and shivering. 

Until, Her brother showed up with the police and said:

He is responsible for her death, Arrest him." 


I was In shock and couldn't defend myself. I was taken by the police "as a suspect" into custody.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed 2 nights in custody, Until the forensic doctor's report came. And I was judged innocent, I was Free...

But not free from that nightmare, not free from her dad's shouting and screaming. Not free from the Sirens that invaded my neighborhood, Not free From seeing her holding a knife outside my door and staring at my cameras late at night...


Not Free from her brother's accusation of me killing her.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
I was free from all her problems and her family's hell..But at what cost...
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Since that day, I never fell in love or even made contact with any girl or woman and never heard from Cate's family ever again...
---------------------------------------------------------------------
