Hi, i'm Jack, i'm 14, but we don't have time for this, please never search your friends up, otherwise you will pay with your life, That is my guess anyway, as I stare at some in-human figure break into my house. This all started a month ago, where me and my friend Joe were bored out of our minds on a cold winters night. I suggested Omegele, but Joe shut the offer down as he was afraid of the man who claimed he will find us someway and someday, after we pointed out his abnormally large teeth and devilish eyes. Instead of omegele, I searched Joe's name up on google, to try and find some awful pictures of him, which I did. They were hilarious, but if I only i knew what i had caused. After that, I searched up the popular girl, Amy Jennings, she ruined Joes life, imagine if we could find some revenge. Nope, no pictures.  'Oh well.' I said, but Joe wanted more, he searched up the class clown, Jake who made his life a misery, nope, nothing. He then searched up me, and to my luck, there was many old photos from my mums facebook account. Joe laughed and said 'What about Oliver James?' with an excited grin on his face, highlighting the purple birthmark on his cheek, Joe hated Oliver but I never knew why, this is why he was so excited to try and google him, but no, once again nothing. After that my computer died and Joe's paranoia about the man on omegele kicked in, but surely my computer just died, right?

Joe went home shortly after, followed by a holiday to Spain, its a shame he wont see my face when I realised that he was right. But at least he is safe. At school 2 days later, I bonded with Oliver James, the quiet kid that we searched up, we bonded over literally nothing, because Joe was my only friend. After about 5 minutes of awkwardness Oliver left, but the peace did not last long, the whole school was called out to the yard through a speaker stating it was an emergency. On my way I saw a familiar face sat in a classroom with paramedics surrounding her, It was Amy Jennings. I dashed out to the yard, my legs feeling like they were about to fall off, I don't really remember the rest of the day, I went home after what felt like years and tried to sleep off the burning feeling of dread, and fear creeping around my body, but I didn't sleep, not one bit.

Fast forward a week, and it was her funeral, it was the same you see in the movies, you know, where the school celebrate her life. I did attend, I sat at the back trying to convince myself it was a coincidence, after I found out it was a drug overdose, It helped my rising fear a lot as she was known for her addiction. The only other noticeable thing I did was to try and warn Jake, just in case, but he did not listen to 'a freak like me' and walked off. Oh well Jake, I tried mate. 

It was the next week, and Karma struck, an unknown shooter entered the building at lunch, and somehow escaped. luckily I escaped him as I was in the toilets not wanting to make small talk with the quiet kid again, to which my plan worked, I did not see him all day. Many people got injured in the shooting, Alyssa Smith, Jane trove, Mike Jones. But they were only minor injuries, Jake was not so lucky, he died of his injuries. I warned him, but the feeling of true fear had overcome my body, I was tempted to leave the area but I am sure I would be found. It seems that the man from omegele, somehow found our search history and assumed one of them was going to be me and Joe, so he is going to wipe us all out.

I got home and sat on google, anything about paranormal activities from google searches but it was no use, even after 5 hours. It was then when a website came up at the top of my screen. For the record, I did not search this up. The website was called Victims. co.uk, you can all see where this is going, my name was the only thing on the page, in red handwriting, It was then I got a text from an unknown number, 'leave your house now Jack, they are coming.' -oj. When my eyes ,met the screen my heart sank, I knew it was over, there was no escape. I left my house anyway with a slight hope of making it out alive, It was night time now, but as I left I saw a figure, approach my door, I ducked immediately, out of its sight, and hurried to the back door and left through there, I knew the back door would be checked soon, so I jumped in a bush. Stupid, I know. To no surprise, the figure approached the back door later on, this figure was not human, you could tell by the way it acted,despite not seeing its face (if it has one). It was clearly here to kill me. Still in the bush, I had the rash decision to text Joe, warn him, thank him for everything, we had not been friends for long, we did not actually like each other originally, but oh well, he was all I had. I thought I would message Joe's mum as well, to make sure he came out alive, and got an immediate response from her, 'Joe's gone missing, the police assume a kidnapping took place, we wanted to tell you in real life, i am sorry you found out this way.'

I thought 'Great, they went to another country for Joe, they will not give up on me,' until I got another message, it was from Joe. The message wrote 'Jack, i'm scared, where are you, they have me.' Now, were at the present day, I am going to call him and tell you what happens, if i am about to die, I will press send, so I apologise if the story is not finished, I have called him and told him I was in a bush watching an entity, gaze at my back door and I now guess that there is more than one of them. I looked back at the entity to see a light beaming on its face, coming from a device, a phone, the light shone on the entity's cheek, revealing a purple birth mark. The entity turned round instantly, i'm sorry there is no time to change the title, but Joe is stood still, gazing at the many bushes around my house, his now bright red, devilish eyes, glistening in the moonlight, his jagged teeth grinding in his bloody mouth, his arm full of cuts from what I assume was caused by the knife he is holding. I thought we were friends, I do not know why he is doing this? Is he possesed? Im sending this now- please read this- Jack Bony.
