The nights grew colder and the darkness crept in earlier, Emily found herself spending more and more time in her room. It was a cozy space, filled with soft blankets, warm lamps, and a plush bed that always seemed to hug her just right. But as she lay there, scrolling through her phone or reading a book, she couldn't help but feel like something was watching her.

At first, she dismissed it as paranoia, a silly fear brought on by too many horror movies and ghost stories. But as the days passed, the feeling only grew stronger. Emily found herself checking behind doors and under the bed, half-expecting to find a pair of glowing eyes staring back at her.

Then, one night, as she lay in bed trying to fall asleep, she saw it. A tiny, swirling vortex of darkness had appeared in the corner of her room. It was no bigger than a softball, but its depths seemed to stretch on forever. Emily tried to shake off the fear that gripped her, telling herself it was just a trick of the light. But as she watched, the void began to grow, expanding until it filled the entire corner of her room.

For a moment, Emily was frozen with fear. But then, something strange happened. The void seemed to pulse, almost like a heartbeat. And as she watched, a voice whispered in her ear.

"Hello, Emily."

She jumped, scrambling backward until she hit the wall. "Who's there?" she demanded.

"It's me," the voice said. "I'm in the corner of your room."

The void looked like a swirling vortex of infinite darkness, a black hole that seemed to stretch on forever and yet remains contained within the confines of Emily's room. 

Emily was sure she was dreaming. She pinched herself, but the sensation was real. "This isn't real," she whispered. "I'm imagining it."

"I'm as real as you are," the voice said. "And I'm lonely."

Emily stared at the void, trying to make sense of what was happening. "What are you?" she asked.

"I don't know," the void admitted. "I've always been here, but no one's ever talked to me before. I've watched you, Emily. I know you're kind and smart and funny. Will you be my friend?"

Emily hesitated. The idea of befriending a void was ludicrous. But something about the voice tugged at her heartstrings. "Okay," she said at last. "I'll be your friend."

And so it began. Emily spent hours talking to the void, telling it about her day, her dreams, and her fears. It was strange, but also kind of comforting. The void never judged her or made fun of her. It was always there, a constant presence in her life.

But as the days went on, Emily began to notice something strange. The void was growing, expanding until it filled almost half of her room. It pulsated faster and faster, as though it was trying to communicate something.

"Are you okay?" Emily asked it one night, as she curled up in bed.

"I don't know," the void admitted. "I feel strange. Like something's happening to me."

"What kind of something?" Emily asked.

"I think I'm not from this world, Emily," the void said, "I believe I am an interdimensional being that accidentally found its way into your room, and now I am fading back to where I came from. " the void repeated. "I'm scared. I don't want to go."

"As an interdimensional void, I have access to infinite planes of existence and consciousness," the void continued, its voice resonating with a deep, otherworldly power. "I have witnessed the birth and death of countless worlds, watched as entire civilizations rose and fell, and yet my existence remained unchanged."

Emily listened in awe, barely able to comprehend the scope of what the void was saying. It was like she was talking to a god, a being that existed beyond the limits of human understanding.

"But despite my powers and knowledge," the void said, "I have always been alone. A watcher, a witness, a silent observer of the universe. Until I met you, Emily."

There was a note of sadness in the void's voice, and Emily felt a pang of sympathy. She had never thought of the void as anything other than a strange presence in her room, but now she saw it in a new light.

Emily tried to comfort it, but there was no use. The void was growing out of control, filling her room until it was all she could see. And then, just as suddenly as it had appeared, it was gone.

Emily was left alone, surrounded by the emptiness of her room. She tried to call out to the void, but there was no answer.

Days turned into weeks, and Emily tried to forget about the strange friendly void in her room

But she couldn't. Every time she looked at the empty corner, she felt a pang of sadness. It was silly, she knew, to feel attached to something that wasn't even real. But she couldn't shake the feeling that she had lost a friend.

Then, one night, Emily woke up to find the void back in its original spot. It was small again, barely a blip on her radar. But it was there, pulsing gently, as though waiting for her.

"Hello, Emily," the voice whispered.

Emily sat up, feeling both relieved and terrified. "What's happening?" she asked.

"I don't know," the void said. "But I think...I think I'm dying."

Emily's heart sank. "No, you can't die."

"I know," the void said. "But I'm still fading. I don't have much time."

Emily didn't know what to do. She had never been good at goodbyes. "Is there anything I can do?" she asked.

"Talk to me," the void said. "Just talk to me, like we used to."

And so, Emily did. She talked to the void for hours, telling it everything she could think of. She told it about her family, her friends, her hopes and dreams. And in return, the void pulsed gently, a comforting presence in the darkness.

But eventually, Emily's words trailed off. She was tired and emotionally drained. "I have to go," she said at last.

"Thank you," the void whispered. "Thank you for being my friend."

And then, it was gone.

Emily sat there for a long time, feeling hollow and alone. But as she looked around her room, she realized something strange. The emptiness of the corner was gone, replaced by a soft glow. It was warm and comforting, like a hug.

For a moment, Emily hesitated. But then she stood up and walked over to the corner, reaching out tentatively. And as she did, her hand touched something solid. Something real.

It was a small, glowing orb, pulsing with energy. Emily picked it up, feeling a rush of joy. It was a gift, she realized. A goodbye present from her friend.
