I woke up to the voices of my sisters downstairs. Barely slept at all last night, so I’m exhausted. Couldn’t help yawning as I got out of bed and wandered to my door. I was startled fully awake as sharp thorns stabbed through my sock. I yelped, loud enough that I guess they heard me downstairs. 

“Beatrice?” Joelaine called. “We have breakfast for you.” 

“Just a minute.” The floor outside my room was covered in wood chips. It still felt a bit uncomfortable to walk after that, even after I had pulled out a few of the larger splinters. To be honest, without finding them I would have chalked the events of last night up to a dream. Part of me had tried to believe last night was a nightmare. There’s also a loose panel in the wall, large enough for a hand to squeeze between. It’s definitely the same area where the scraping came from yesterday.

My sisters didn’t notice the chips, or that the door was covered in claw marks. I guess the cabin is already scuffed in a lot of areas throughout. They were in a good mood when I went downstairs. Joelaine already had a stack of pancakes waiting. She had made some with chocolate chips inside, and I found Edith hadn’t hesitated to get into the whip cream. 

As I walked into the kitchen, my heart froze. On the banister by the basement stairs was the bear pelt. The shock must have shown on my face. “What’s wrong now?” Edith asked. “We heard you shout upstairs.” 

“The bear.” 

“What about it?” 

“It was there yesterday,” I gestured over my shoulder, “don’t you remember?” 

“Oh yeah,” said Edith after a pause, “I guess so…strange.” she turned away from me to shove another forkful of pancakes in her mouth. 

“Is something bothering you, Bea?” Joelaine asked, moving over to sit by Edith. It wouldn’t have been easy to explain all of what I experienced last night to my sisters. I did tell them I thought there had been an animal in the house. Edith snorted, then suggested it was just rats scraping around in the walls. To be fair, I noticed more rat droppings over the counters. 

I didn’t notice the sign yesterday. I spotted it above the sink while washing dishes. It read: “countless people have eaten -in this kitchen- and gone on to live.” (https://imgur.com/a/9rIUO6q ) Might be a random detail, but I thought it was too strange not to mention. 

“Ominous,” I noted, pointing it out to Joelaine. 

“Yeah,” she agreed with a laugh. “A bit strange, isn’t it?”

It isn’t only the bear skin in the cabin. There are other animals, a wild boar and a fawn. I noted their locations after I’d finished the cleaning. The fawn wasn’t where I remembered. Last night it was upstairs hanging on the wall above the stairs. This morning, however, it was on the kitchen floor underneath Edith’s chair. I’m not certain if the boar moved. It was in the hall towards the bathroom and gave me a bit of a fright when I went to brush my teeth after breakfast. 

I know what some of you may be thinking. There’s obviously something strange going on with these pelts. Why don’t I move them? Lock them in a room somewhere. While I’ve thought about it, I don’t think I have the courage to touch the bear. It also might be difficult to explain to my sisters if I asked them for help. If I told them I thought the carpets were coming to life I don’t think I’d be taken seriously. 

I tried uploading this to Reddit but I don’t have any connection right now. I’ve thought about it a bit more… I’ll try moving the fawn to the bathroom without raising suspicions. I haven’t explored the basement yet, but I know Edith and Joelaine were down there yesterday. I think they want me to go with them. It should be fine as a group, guess I’ll have to see how it goes. 

Thank you for reading my story. 

Beatrice.

Edit: it’s the middle of the night now. Instead of making a whole new post I thought it’d be better to add on to the previous. 

I visited the basement. Joelaine agreed the choice of blue carpet was strange due to the smell of mold—water damaged. The moisture was enough to get my feet wet. “We were wearing shoes yesterday,” Joelaine told me as I peered towards the shadows. “I didn’t realize how bad it was then.” There was a weary buzz above. Little taps sounded sporadically as the insects struck the side of the lightbulb. The rooms down there aren’t entirely finished. Some of the floor was still completely dirt, and every other wall is a wooden framework. The only furniture was a leather couch facing an unplugged television. 

The three of us sat down on the couch. I sat with my legs crossed so my feet wouldn’t touch the floor. My sisters talked for a while, every so often exploding into a fit of giggles. I even joined in a few times. “Have you checked out any of the other rooms?” I asked after some time had passed. 

My sisters shared a glance, “Kind of dark,” Joelaine said, “so not really… no.” 

“Would you wanna look for us?” Edith asked with a grin. 

I shook my head quickly. 

“What if we all go together?” she persisted, smiling devilishly, “could be an adventure.” 

I looked towards the exit behind me. Three creaky boards led to the door, then the flight of stairs back into the kitchen. “If we’re as a group, sure I guess.” 

“Bea…” Joelaine began, “we don’t have to…”

“Great!” Edith grabbed her arm and dragged her towards the triad of unfinished rooms. I followed behind, arms crossed. 

“She was begging to look yesterday,” Joelaine told me. “I told her no.” 

There were shovels and other equipment. It smelled like garbage, there were piles of it in heaps. As my eyes adjusted I noticed a pit dug out in one of the rooms. “I wonder what that’s for?” I said.

“Not sure,” Joelaine answered. “Some utility for the house. Maybe plumbing...” 

Edith walked past us further into the shadow. “There’s something white down there,” she said, “Can either of you see?” It was then the light at the door went out. The three of us went silent. 

“Who’s walking?” Edith said after a pause. “I hear someone moving.” My hand found Joelaine’s wrist. She was motionless at my side. I could hear it too now. I could feel the dust resettle after each firm heavy step. Down the steps from the kitchen. 

“Down,” I hissed, “get down.” I dragged Joelaine with me, into the room where Edith had been standing. When I felt the rim of the pit I dropped to my knees. “Stay quiet.” 

I was sure Edith was about to say something… about to ask a question—but it was another voice that spoke. “I thought his voice would work to lure her,” he sounded frustrated. Angry even.

My mind raced, *does he know we’re here? Is it dark out? How long have we really been down here?*

“You thought she’d just come walking out?” a second voice this time. “After you chased her?” The first grunted as the pair came to a halt. “She was the oldest,” the second voice carried on, “just remember it’s better when they’re younger. The other two will be better for us anyway. The oldest is a backup… otherwise she’ll work as feed.” 

This last comment prompted a deep rumbling chuckle. “Let’s unlock the trap door and get out of here.” He said. Whatever he was… I could only make out the dark shape of where he stood. He was so large, I’m not even sure how he fit through the door frame. I could feel my sister’s breathing on my arm. I guess she was having trouble sitting motionless on her knees. I could have helped her if I’d reacted quicker. I sensed how tired she was getting, but I was scared… scared to move. It was at that moment her position slipped. There was a tumble of soil as her leg slipped out from under her, down into the pit behind us. I grabbed her arm, catching myself from breathing too loudly.

 “Rats,” the second stranger scoffed, “let’s get out of here.” There was a creak; my brain recognised it as a metal hinge opening. In agonizing silence we waited as the pair descended somewhere deeper under the cabin. There was a thud behind them. 

My eyes were adjusting better to the darkness. I could see my sister’s face. Her blue eyes appeared grey in the darkness. It looked like she was screaming, though no sound escaped her thin lips. 

“I-t… my leg,” she gasped for breath as a whine finally escaped her. 

“Joe…” I grabbed her arm and tugged. Last night was terrifying enough, all alone in the dark. I can’t even begin to describe what I felt in that moment though. Wanting desperately to save her. It wasn’t just me, though, Edith lept to my side and grabbed Joeline, helping drag her up. I thought she must be caught on something; she barely moved. Out of desperation I lowered my own leg into the pit and kicked down hard, thinking to knock whatever it was holding her. Instead I heard a squeal. My foot hit something fleshy that leered away from my attack. 

My sister’s leg slid against me as she came out. It was wet with something black and warm. There’s no way in hell we were staying in the basement after that. The stranger’s voices had long gone silent. Supporting my sister’s arm we made it to the kitchen stairs and crept up. The bathroom had a lock, I remembered. I intended to take her there, not the rooms upstairs. As we approached the hallway to the bathroom, though, I heard a wet snort. 

I froze in place. 

“What is it?” Edith asked with a tremble in her voice. 

“The boar…”

“What?” 

“Upstairs,” I whispered back, “please just listen, please upstairs.” Going through the living room also meant going past the fireplace—where the ax was located. I grabbed the handle with my free hand, and clutched it tightly. Feet were stomping down the hall towards us. 

From upstairs I heard a growl as something approached the stairwell. I recognized the thud against the wall as it clambered down the first step. Whatever had chased me the night previous. *It’s over*, I thought, *we’re trapped.*

I thought I could see a nose in the darkness. We were facing towards the bathroom at this point, my head turning back and forth between the two approaching beasts. A wrinkled snout from around the corner of that hall. A wet breath. My heart was pounding as I strained my vision, wondering if the gleaming white I saw was tusks. The boar turned as the sound of thrashing exploded from the bathroom as if something was banging around violently. It disappeared, squealing as it bounded towards the bathroom door. From behind us the other creature bounded downwards. 

I pushed my sisters back, into the shadow of the fireplace as the thing bounded past. It had an odor, a rot that pierced my nostrils. Edith gaged audibly, but it was already long past, around the corner and on its way to the bathroom. 

We used our opportunity to move around the fireplace, up the stairs and to my room—yes, I managed to move the fawn pelt to the bathroom. There’s no doubt in my mind now that these dead creatures are roaming the house at night. Are they mimicking human voices? Or are there people getting in the house somehow? I don’t plan to stick around to find out.

This might be the last post. After the events I just experienced I plan to pack up and leave tomorrow morning. Edith and Joelaine are going to be pissed but I think I’m beyond the point of that really mattering. We aren't safe here. My room is locked so I don’t think they can get me. I should last until morning. 

I’d appreciate any help. Goodnight.
