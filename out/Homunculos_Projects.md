When I was a kid, I was in second grade, I believe. We had a science proffessor that made us do a project.

Now before I begins telling the story, I have to tell you that in my country, parents aren't as attentive as are others in other countries. Most of us didn't get help from anyone since our parents always said that it would be better for us to figure it out by ourselves.

So, we had a new teacher at school, I don't remember his face or name anymore, but that man made the whole class do a project.

The project was called the Humunculos Project, we were super excited to make a miniatures of ourselves, we were kids. So, the teacher gave us something, I think it was blood or something, the liquid was red. He told us to inject it into an egg and watch the proccess for the next week.

We did so, me and some of my friends did it together, we had four eggs together and we all injected whatever were given to us. The eggs were to be recently laid.

The first day nothing happened, really. The second day was something sort of veins spread on the eggs, the third day, the eggs were turning black. We were really excited to see the process, we just thought the process was okay.

We told the teacher and he just smiled and nodded saying "Good Job" again, we were happy that the project was going well since that meant we would get good points and extra credits.

However, on the fourth day cracks appeared on the shells, we put the eggs in a containers as to not let whatever was i side fall on the ground.

When we went to check the eggs on the fifth day, the eggs had already hatched, but... there was nothing inside.

There were two small black feathers in the spot though, I was disappointed that I couldn't see what had hatched. The Next day we went to the teacher and told him about what happened, he just laughed and rubbed our head and said if he could have those two frathers, we gave him the feathers because he said he would give us extra credit so we did.

The teacher never came back on Monday though, he had apparently quit and moved away, at the time it wasn't really a big deal, but now that I think back, I wonder. What the heck we even hatched, needless to say. Me and my friends did happened to see something crawl into the tall grass near our homes.

It was black in color, crawling on fours. We were spooked because it was dark out, we didn't have much to do but talk among us and just tell eachother day events.

We got curious despite being scared, and went to look, we just heard small low screeches of a bird or something, we thought it was a snake because sometimes snakes call out to chicks in the dark, making the sound of the chicken when calling their little chicks.

When we arrived where the sound came from, there was only one large black feather left behind. We left the feather where it was, we weren't going to pick it up because why would we? We were kids and just thought it was a normal feather and perhaps it was, but now that I think about it. The experiment, the four legged chicken?, the sound, little feathers and then a large black feather? It might have been just something normal but one thing is for certain.

That teacher made us create something that perhaps was what he was looking for, he never shouwed to schoom again, never heard of him. We asked out principal what had happened and he just told not to worry about him.

Honestly, this story might not be that spooky, but it is scary to think that we as kids, made somthing that we can not explain, something is out there. At night there are screams of something or someone deep in the forest, black feathers.

I wonder what thlse black feathers meanðŸ¤”
