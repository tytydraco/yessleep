When I pulled the Justice Mutual envelope out of my mailbox, I assumed it contained a letter stating that my application for life insurance had been approved. I thought it might also recap the coverage limit I’d selected, the premium I owed – all that jazz. Instead, the letter told me in the most overly apologetic way possible that my application had been denied.

I was so furious I almost ripped it to shreds.

After I’d starved myself and lost 15 pounds… After I’d gone through the hassle of letting them come to my office to take my weight, my vitals, and my blood for analysis… After I’d waited thirty long days for feedback… Now they wanted to say “no” to me?

I called the phone number included on the letter, ready to tear someone there a new one. After making 57 selections on the automated menu, I finally got an actual living, breathing representative on the line.

“Thank you for calling Justice Mutual,” the disgustingly upbeat male Indian voice said. “This is Jim. How can I assist you?”

“Yes, *Jim*,” I said, “I’d like to know why you guys wasted my time and denied my application.”

“Jim” didn’t miss a beat. “It would be my pleasure. To start with, could you please provide me with your full name?”

I rattled off my name and the 19 other tidbits of information I was hounded for so this guy could verify that it was me speaking and not some identity thief from Nigeria. 

Finally he got down to business. “Yes, it does show here a denial.”

“Why?” I asked.

“Hmm…”

Not exactly the specificity I was looking for. “What? Was it my blood work?”

“No, your blood work was fine.”

“Then what? My vitals? It can’t be my weight.”

“It’s a denial code ‘CB’,” Jim said.

“What the heck does that mean?”

“I don’t know. It’s brand new.”

“You don’t know?” 15 minutes in, and this clown didn’t know what his own company’s lingo meant.

“I’m very sorry.”

“I want to speak to your manager.”

“One moment.”

Many, many moments later I was connected. “This is Bonnie,” the chipper, Alabama-sounding voice said.

“Yes, Bonnie,” I said, “What does denial code ‘CB’ mean?”

“Oh, you got that?”

“Yes.”

“It’s brand new.”

“So I’ve heard.”

“Honestly,” she said, “I’m not sure yet what that means.”

I grit my teeth. “Who does?”

“I don’t know. Maybe someone in the corporate office in Houston.”

“That’s right,” I thought, recalling that Justice Mutual is headquartered here in H-Town, where I live.

“Thanks for nothing, Bonnie,” I said and hung up.

I looked up their address online, then mapped it using the Waze app on my phone – it would take me seven minutes to get there. It was only 3pm, well before rush hour, as a dentist appointment had made me knock off work early.

My wife and kids wouldn’t be home for a while, so I hopped in my car and headed over to the Justice Mutual building. The visitor parking lot was surprisingly full, so I parked across the street at a CVS and walked over.

After demanding to speak with someone in charge, the nervous receptionist made a phone call and then hastily escorted me to the office of a chubby, semi-bald guy named Dave who had the worst comb-over I’ve ever seen.

“I’m so sorry about your denial,” Dave said after asking me to have a seat.

“Not sorry enough to not issue it,” I said. “But I want to know why. What’s code ‘CB?’”

Dave hesitated, looking anxious.

“I’m not leaving without an answer.”

He sighed, closed his office door, and sat down at his desk. “It stands for ‘Crystal Ball.’”

“What?” 

Dave filled me in on the history. Evidently Justice Mutual’s CEO was single and lonely and in desperation visited some strip mall fortune teller that gave him specifics about when and where he would meet the love of his life. Apparently everything this woman told him came true, so the CEO, convinced she has the gift of sight, hired her recently to give final approval or denial on all life insurance applications where she gets a feeling or premonition one way or the other.

When Dave finished, I chuckled, sneering. “You’ve gotta be kidding me,” I said. “You’re a Fortune 500 company, and you’ve got some dime-store psychic making business decisions for you?”

Dave said nothing but nodded.

“I wonder what your board of directors would think about that level of stupidity.”

He shrugged.

“I guess we’ll find out,” I said as I got up and stormed out.

“So ridiculous,” I thought moments later as I exited the building and started heading across the street to my car. 

I was so angry I didn’t notice the red convertible run the stop sign and barrel right toward me.
