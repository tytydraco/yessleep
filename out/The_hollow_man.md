“Good morning, sir,” I said.

It was an odd thing to say, because it _wasn’t_ a particularly good morning - average at best. A hazy mist lingered drowsily outside the windows, and the veiled scenery dissolved seamlessly into the sky, so that you couldn’t quite tell where one started and the other began. Golden sunshine filtered through a canopy of thicker clouds, and smudges of dark charcoal blurred into the horizon, creating the illusion of a silvery canvas draped elegantly over the streets - like the wrinkled skin of an elephant.
In short, the day was dull, grey, and (as it always was) unremarkable.

The man I spoke to, however, seemed unbothered by the futility of the “good morning, sir” ritual. He nodded politely in my direction, then allowed his gaze to wander some distance past me, finally settling near where the dark smudges brushed the horizon and the scenery faded to sky. The man was curious. Or rather, his _face_ was curious (the rest of him was strikingly ordinary). His eyebrows were slanted and slightly asymmetrical, and his lips were contorted into an uncomfortable smile: tight and rigid, distorting his features into the fractured likeness of a Picasso.
It was a politeness that was pleasant but not friendly, and didn’t quite reach his eyes. Eyes which held a gaze so remote, I dared not follow their path, lest I get lost along the way.

It felt a bit weird, staring intensely into this curiously-faced man’s eyes, weaving my gaze in and out of their immense mahogany depths, searching endlessly within them for something that wasn’t _nothing_ - but I (quite literally) could not take my eyes off him. The expansive emptiness was magnetic, it was vast and alluring, and I was trapped. A siren’s call was pulling me closer and closer toward the impossible depths of darkness contained within the mahogany eyes of this stranger, and I went willingly.

Time passed and I stared.
After a while, possibly seconds, possibly hours, a single tear was produced by his vacant mahogany eyes, and I watched as it drifted hesitantly down his cheek. Iridescent as a drop of silvery marble, it shimmered furtively in the filtered sunlight, a quiet sort of brilliance which made it all the more noticeable. And as the tear fell, its surface caught the light, emitting fleeting moments of beauty scattered in time like sun-glow across the surface of a glittering lake.

I think he was aware of the tear.
He must’ve been.
He must have felt the stinging in his eyes, the cool trail sliding down his curious face, the salt on his lips and the slow relief as it dripped from his chin. But he didn’t address it. He didn’t wipe away the faint trace of its meandering path, nor blink it back. He just let it fall.

_My mam_ used to tell me stories about a hollow man. 
He looked like the rest of us, acted like the rest of us, went to work and came home like the rest of us - you get the picture. Only on the inside he wasn’t like the rest of us, he was hollow. His body was filled with Nothing.
And as the story goes, the Hollow Man tried to fix it. He tried _everything_ .
Tried to fill the quiet with sound, the ache with distraction, the emptiness with anything he could find.
Hobbies. Friends. Work.
He failed and he tried again.
And again and again and again. 

Then one day, he met a woman.
And she _loved_ him.

He had never been loved before, and God was this a good way to start. Her love was soft and fierce, warm like the heat of a fire you built with your friends in the woods. It wrapped itself around the walls of him and pressed into all the forgotten spaces, and it filled his Nothing completely. Like the first gulp of air after a swim. Like golden sunlight flooding a locked room. And for a moment - a blink - a he thought he was whole.

But he wasn’t.

Because love, doesn’t settle in a hollow vessel. 
It doesn’t root.
It drains through the cracks like water through a sieve - fast, then faster, until he was nothing all over again.
And no matter how much she gave, no matter how much love she flooded him with, it all passed straight through.
Nothing could stay.

And she tried, God she tried to hold him together with her bare hands, tried to cover the cracks with her fingers. But he was slipping. Slipping. And in the end, she left him too.
Because Nothing wasn’t enough for her either.

After that, the Hollow Man was filled with sorrow.

Sorrow was different from love.
It didn’t blaze. It _seeped_ .
It leaked out of him in dark, sticky drops that burned as they fell.
Each one stung his skin.
Each one lingered.
Each one _hurt_ .

My mam used to say the hollow man only had one tear left in him that was any good. Just one.
The final, trembling piece of something almost like a soul.
It danced behind his eyes, frenzied and desperate, like a firefly in a jar - trapped, flickering, beautiful. _Dying_ .
I thought it was quite poetic: the last sparkling part of his soul having its frantic dance restricted by the bounds of a single teardrop. Flimsy as thin glass. 

And when it fell that was it. What was left of his soul literally shattered. 
And there was no more grief. No more ache. Just stillness.

The rest of him folded inward, and the dust settled. And he was filled Nothing. He _was_ Nothing.

This man - the one with the curious face and the mahogany eyes I think he’s hollow too.
I think his insides are a ruin of dust and ghostly whispers. I think his heart wandered off somewhere without him, and he didn’t follow.
I wonder how a man can go on like that - with all that space where being is supposed to be.
How long can you carry a body full of Nothing?

But never mind.
His last tear’s fallen.

_Goodbye, Hollow Man._
