How did I get here? That is what I ask my self every day, this bunker that belonged to an old friend who was a Vietnam veteran, he died 6 years ago. I remembered it when I ran from my home, how it all happened still does not register but honestly how would it. I live in the Appalachian region and like most lived in the barest minimum because the government does not care for us veterans.

My story began at my home a few weeks ago and it was just a normal evening for me, I used my skills as a mechanic to make some money, the town is about 40 minutes away so many farmers and normal fold would come to me or ask me to go to their place to fix their machines and things. Bettie, my wife, died 10 years ago due to cancer so being alone get tiring for an old vet. I was sitting in my kitchen reading a book I had gotten from Gillian, sister-in-law, and sipping my coffee when I heard a knocking on my door. Looking up at my clock I saw it was close to 10 so anyone who comes at this time must be desperate.

I got up and walked to the front door and opened it, what stood in front of me forced me to take a step back. The girl looked like she just came in from a warzone, her clothes were like ribbons hanging on for dear life and where there was skin there were streaks of blood. The old memories of was threatened to resurface but her falling forward stopped that and instinct kicked in, my hands flew forward to stop her fall. I managed to stop the fall and carry her into my home, I pulled her in and set her down near my door and I turned to look out the door to see if there was anyone else behind or who was chasing her. The night was still and so were the sounds of the night, I closed the door slowly and turned to the girl. She looked young like maybe 23 years old, I gingerly picked her and walked over to my sofa and set her there.

She did not wake up and any attempts at waking her did not result in any reaction. I decided to treat her wounds and maybe clean her as best as I could so I went to the kitchen and filled a basin with warm water and took a few towels, looking around I remembered my coffee sitting on the small table and I juggled the towels and managed to carry that also. Setting the basin on the coffee table next to the sofa I set about trying to clean the wounds and could see that many were scratches from running in the woods. There was a real wound on her back that looked like it had stopped bleeding but from my touch it was hot, so an infection. It was a long cut like it was made by a claw of some kind, bears were prevalent in my area but given that it was October they were closer to their caves and streams. There were 2 other cuts next to the one I was treating and they were deep maybe the animal wasn’t able to catch her.

I finished with the treatment as best as I could and covered her with a blanket. I then decided to call the sheriff and let them know about this. I pulled the phone and dialled the number; it rang a couple of times and a lady picked the call. She asked if there was anything she could help with and I told her about my guest and if there were any deputies who could come by and maybe an ambulance. She told me the sheriff was in my area as there were reports of animal attacks at the Pine Peak Camp, so she will let the sheriff know about the girl. I thanked her and let her know to call if anything as I was 15 minutes away from the park anyway.

Animal attacks? I know the park was prone to animals prowling close to their boundaries but honestly an attack was rare, if ever. I decided to sit and wait in case the sheriff did decide to show up, being a vet meant sleep was something we got after taking pills because normal sleep was like being sent back to the battlefield and watching your buddies being torn apart by the enemy traps. I fished out my old shotgun, checked if it was loaded and took a few spare ammo.

I sat down on the armchair that looked out the window in to night and waited, the girl did not stir but I could hear the steady breaths she was taking. Whatever attacked her really did a number on her mind, as the thoughts of the old war floated into my mind I was woken in an instant. There was a sound outside like someone was trying to quietly walk around my house, the steps were heavy though like the person weighed over 300 pounds. Thump thump… they went but as quietly as possible, my hand tightened on the shotgun as I waited. It stopped and then nothing, I sat still and waited, the sounds of the clock were getting louder with every tick. Nothing, yet I could feel the air getting thicker and the night darker.

Outside the light outside my garage and workshop light up its space along with that it had its host of flies flickering about it, there was no wind but it was getting cooler now. I approximated the time to be around 1 and there were no sounds of the night. Just then a shadow darted past the window, too fast for me to see what it was, there was a noise at my front door like someone trying to push it in then nothing. The shadow then darted past the window again, then the light thumps of footfalls outside, my hand gripped the shotgun tighter with every thump to the point I actually hand to release it on account of getting a numbing sensation on my elbow.

Then I hear the light thumps again and then there was a shadow in front of my window obscuring the light outside, I saw nothing at first and dared not to move a muscle. The girl was still out and did not move either, I sat and watched the window. It was like a big man looking in, it stood there then hunched down and that is when I saw that face. Like one of those large monkeys my wife would show me in those nature magazines. This face was filled with hate, the eyes were sunken in but there was like a dull red glow in them and the mouth was open, I could not see inside and did now want to. It lay there for what felt like hours but was maybe a minute before it pulled away, I looked like it was about to punch through the window but flashing lights from behind startled it and it darted. It was the sheriff, from the red and blue I knew it was him and he was followed by another car.

I got up and walked to the window and waited for the cars to park, still holding my shotgun tight and waited. The cars stopped and 2 men came out of the first car while the single had just 1, who I supposed would be Doc Wilman. The sheriff wore his hat and walked up to my front door; I knew he could see me but decided to know any way. I light my room and the lights outside and opened the door. The sheriff looked tired and from what I could see the deputy behind was the same, the doctor however looked like he was recovering from the shock of his life. No greeting just a nod in the direction of the sleeping lady and I stood back, I knew niceties would just piss them off so I stood back and waited for all three to enter and then again a pocked my head to see if my other guest was there.

Nothing, so I stepped back in and closed the door behind me and bolting it. The sherif stood behind the sofa while the doctor sat on the coffee table to examine the lady, the deputy had made his way to the kitchen. I stood next to my window and waited. Nothing was spoken for a few minutes then the doctor said she was in shock and should be taken to his clinic, the sheriff nodded and called out to his deputy. He then turned to ask me what happened and I told him everything, the look on his face told me everything.

“Listen Mason, whatever attacked this girl’s camp left us just parts of people to pick and identify, how she escaped is a miracle but honestly, I need more than just a few boys with guns to hunt whatever did this. You need to either come with us or find a better place to stay safe, I got reports that another camp was attacked few miles away a week ago. This sasquatch or whatever the fuck they are calling it looks like it’s on a rampage.”

I nodded and mentioned that I will figure something out but also mentioned that I was a vet so I am prepared. He nodded and motioned for his deputy to help him pick the lady and they left. I watched them load her in to the police car and the doctor into his own car. After that they left, and the night was silent again. I sat back on the chair and waited for the dawn. The shadow returned but this time I was ready to fight.
