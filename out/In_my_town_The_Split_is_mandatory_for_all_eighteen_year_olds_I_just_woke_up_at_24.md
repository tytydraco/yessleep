If I'm going to be able to talk to you about what's currently happening, I need to tell you about my childhood. 

Specifically, the ‘law’ that passed in my town when I was ten years old. 

The official name was The Future Work Initiative. 

But for anyone with a fucking fully functioning brain cell, it was murder. 

I remember practising times tables when the door to our classroom flew open, and in walked the sheriff with a wide smile. 

He had some *super, fun, exciting news for us!*

So exciting that he used three verbs. 

*Children!” He greeted us with a wide smile. 

I was comforted—until I saw our teacher trying to hide her teary eyes behind a workbook. 

He had a PowerPoint presentation he wanted to show us. 

The title was punchy, on a bright green background. 

**THE FUTURE WORK INITIATIVE**. 

His assistant, a smartly dressed woman, clicked a button, leading us to the first slide, an enlarged photo of the map of America. 

The sheriff immediately dived into the presentation. “Okay! So, how many adults do you think are currently unemployed?” 

Isabella stuck up her hand. “50?”

I figured I’d guess, raising my arm. “100?”

“100 billion?” Gracie giggled from the back, half of the glass snorting with her. 

“That was a rhetorical question,” the sheriff said. “Right now, about *four* out of one hundred people in this country, are out of work. Now, that doesn't sound like a lot, but in reality, it's a very scary statistic.” His expression hardened. 

He turned to the PowerPoint presentation. 

“However! I am very excited to announce that we will be the very first town to implement the Future Work Initiative, which will help you guys—” his grin widened. “—get yourselves into work!”

The classroom filled with groans and stifled laughter. 

*“Is he serious?”*

Casper’s hand instantly shot up, and I rolled my eyes. The smartest kid in the class *always* had something to say. 

The sheriff looked delighted that he was getting some kind of reaction that wasn't twenty pairs of dazed eyes and agape mouths. “Yes, young man! The kid with the cartoon hat.”

Casper’s lip curled. He tugged his beanie over his curls, speaking with emphasis. “Actually, it's *Dragon Ball*.”

“Ask your question, kid.”

“I'm ten years old,” Casper said, an ironic drawl to his tone. “I’m not old enough for a job.” He folded his arms, leaning back in his chair.

“Obviously.”

“Me too!” Blue waved her arms, scowling. “I'm not even in high school yet! I can't get a job, I don't even know *how* to work!

The sheriff's smile was getting a little scary. 

“I'm not talking about now,” he told us. “I'm talking about the future! When you will be an adult!”

He gestured for his assistant to continue the PowerPoint, and this time we were looking at a photo of a sad looking high schooler grasping her diploma to her chest. I remember suddenly feeling nauseous, phantom bugs filling my mouth. 

“Amy didn't get into her favorite college,” The Sheriff spoke up, gesturing to the screen. “So, do you want to guess what she did?”

When none of us responded, his smile darkened. “Amy decided not to get a job– and Amy is not the only one. When teenagers do not get into their ideal college to further their education, they lose their incentive to find a job, and get very sad.”

The next slide displayed an image of a crying man. 

The sheriff turned to us, his eyes wide. “How many of you want to go to college?”

All of us raised our hands, and I'll never forget the look of disappointment on his face. 

"That's where you're all wrong," he said. "Children go to college for leisure. They don’t care about the jobs they’ll get afterward—because there are no jobs for the subjects these people choose to study.”

This time, he slammed his fist against the board, and half of us nearly jumped out of our chairs.

"Have you ever seen a job listing for—let’s say—French film? No. Children attend college to be educated, but they are not educated. They come out brainless, unable to find even the simplest work, and our great country loses its precious workforce.”

He pointed to Emma. 

“You. What's your favorite food?”

Emma looked startled, her cheeks going pink. 

“Um, uhhh, pizza?”

“Pizza won't exist without someone making it for you,” he said.

“In fact, if the person making your pizza decided to go to college to study ridiculous subjects like *science*, and ‘diseases’, when we already know how we get sick– and we *already* know what makes us sick! Young lady, your favorite pizza wouldn't exist without that worker. In fact, the place would shut down.”

I didn't fully understand the presentation, leaning over my desk to my seat-mate, Kaian. “What is he talking about?”

Kaian shrugged, a pencil lodged between his teeth, his gaze glued to a stock image photo of a group of smiling children. 

“I dunno,” he mumbled, chewing on his pencil. “Maybe he wants us to get jobs?”

The sheriff was quick to shush us. “How many of you want to be grown ups?”

Every hand shot up, and the proud smile on his mouth twisted my gut. 

“What would you say, if I told you the group of you could become adults early?”

Isabella squeaked excitedly. “You're going to turn us into grown ups? That's so cool!”

“Well, it’s a little more complicated than that, but, uhhh, yes, I suppose, if you put it that way! Introducing The Split! 

"At the age of eighteen, you’ll lie down on a warm, comfortable table, and in the time it takes to blink—just a single blink—you’ll be twenty-four. 

"No pain, or mess, no confusion. Just a smooth transition into adulthood. You won’t remember the procedure itself.

"You’ll close your eyes as a child, and in a single blink of your eye, you will be twenty four years old. No awkward years, and no need for higher education. Everything unnecessary—everything that gets in the way of your development, will be removed.”

He chuckled. “And the best part? You’ll wake up ready. Ready to enter the great American workforce! Isn't that wonderful?”

Casper leaned forward, after a bout of silence. 

I was pretty sure Isabella had burst into uncontrollable sobs. 

“You're a genius,” Casper whispered excitedly, his mouth breaking into a grin.

His eyes were eerily glued to the presentation, half lidded, like he was hypnotized by the current slide. 

“I *love* it.”

“What?” Zach’s eyes were wide. He was terrified. “Did you not hear what he said?”

Looking around the class, most of my classmates had the same sentiment. 

I'm pretty sure one boy started having a panic attack. 

Casper, however, was for once sitting up straight in his chair, eagerly waiting for the presentation to continue.

I remember my stomach was churning, vomit creeping up my throat in a sour slime. “You're serious?” I whispered, twisting in my chair to him. 

Casper had this look on his face— an expression I'll never forget. 

Like he was relieved that all the troubles in his mind, his insecurities and fears of not being good enough, were being lifted from his shoulders. 

Casper was the smart kid, the boy who wouldn't stop talking about higher education, and high school. And yet somehow, all of his ambitions and dreams had been wiped out in one single speech. 

He was fascinated, and I found myself terrified by the glimmer in his eyes, the light from the board reflecting in his pupils. 

The boy shrugged, smiling. 

“What?” His grin eerily mimicked the sheriff’s. “I want to be a grown up.”

Unsurprisingly, the rest of us thought this man was fucking insane. 

When he left the room, my classmates erupted into protests. 

Parents arrived early, scooping up their children. 

Mom wasn't there, but I was expecting her to be absent. 

She was always at work, anyway. 

When I stepped inside our house, my mom was actually home. 

She was in the kitchen, shouting on the phone—and in her hands was a flyer detailing The Future Work Initiative. 

I was curious, so I read through it. 

The flyer itself was slick in my clammy hands, smelling of bleach, my nails scratching across each page. 

I only had to get to section three (Uniformity, and Keeping Our Children Safe)—an entire section on the specialized colors we would be wearing—to know this thing was actually happening. The bill had passed earlier that morning. Somehow, I kept reading, feeling progressively sicker. 

When I reached The New Parent initiative (Making Sure Our Children Are Fully Protected by Parents Following the Initiative), I ran upstairs to my room and buried my head in my pillows. 

I kept reading, hiding under my blankets, my stomach contorting. 

Section 4: Splitting Your Child (Explained):

As a parent, we empathise that you are worried for your children's future. 

We understand, while the splitting process does sound intimidating, it is simply a medical procedure that will protect your child going forward, and ensure they live long, prosperous lives (and, of course, provide you with the next generation)!

The splitting process is a quick and easy fix which will take exactly 45 minutes

Using precise neurological and physiological intervention, we extract the child self, allowing the adult form to emerge fully developed. 

For your son/daughter, they will not feel time passing, and will  seamlessly transition into adulthood. 

Please be aware, this will not affect your child's neurological development. Once completed, your child will be *turned off*. This is completely normal, and we ask you to please be patient with your child. 

For more details on what to expect post-splitting, please refer to **Section 5: Aftercare and Integration.**

Before I could flip over, the flyer was snatched out of my hands.

Mom loomed over me, phone pressed to her ear, her eyes raw from crying. 

She didn't speak to me, instead placing a plate of cookies on my bedside table and kissing my forehead. 

Mom took the flyer, tore it into two, and dumped it in my trash can.

“Pack a suitcase, just in case,” she told me, before leaving my room. “Only the necessities.”

I understood it was a parent’s job to keep their children safe, but I already knew what was going on—and Mom’s attempts to shield me from the truth only made me feel useless. 

Mom spent the next several weeks campaigning and protesting for my rights, for my classmates’ rights to an education. 

I insisted on accompanying her, protesting for my own rights, joining my friends and their parents outside the mayor’s office. 

Mom took me out of school in protest, homeschooling me instead.

I guess what I'm trying to say is, I never expected things to actually go forward.

I was a kid. I stood next to my mother and waved my sign, and in the back of my head, I thought, *This won't really happen, right? It's just a misunderstanding, and we’ll all go back to school, and this will all be forgotten.*

In fact, I'll laugh about it, because the idea is so stupid. So wrong.

But one day, Mom came home from the store crying. 

She didn't say why, but I overheard her on the phone speaking to Grammy. 

“It's every *fucking* store,” she whispered.

“They're not letting me buy anything, and they're refusing my card. I need to be part of this fucking new parents initiative, if I want gas or food.” she sighed, running her fingers along the countertop. 

“Yes, I'm going to try to skip town. There's a Walmart in the next one over. Okay, yes, I promise. It's okay, I've got our passports.”

I'm not sure how to tell you exactly how my town fell in just a couple of weeks. 

People started throwing rocks at our windows. 

I saw Zach with his mother. Zach was wearing the new mandatory color for us. 

Purple. 

Purple shirt and purple pants for boys. 

Purple dress and purple tights, for girls. 

I only had to see the strain in his face, the way he kept tugging at his mother’s hand, for me to know he *hated* his new clothes. 

I was homeschooled, so I saw everything. I wish I didn't. 

I think part of me wishes I actually went to school, so I didn't witness my life crumbling around me. 

I saw the men in black force their way into our house, restraining my screaming mother, taking her purse, passport, and my birth certificate. 

They also took her phone, laptop, and all of my books from my shelf. 

As part of The Future Work Initiative, I would only be reading town-mandated books. 

I was torn from my mother’s arms two days later, and taken to what used to be the county jail. Instead of holding criminals, it held terrified ten year olds. 

I was thrown into a cell with four other kids. 

We were told, from that moment on, our parents were no longer our parents– and we would be adopted by parents in The New Parent Initiative. 

Some kids violently fought back, and were dragged away. I was left with a girl called Ciara, who slumped next to me.

I remember the feeling of her fingers wrapped around mine. In the dim glow of an overhead bulb, she broke out into sobs that I knew lied. 

I saw her expression that day during her presentation. 

She was smiling too. Just like Casper. 

“Well, at least we’ll get jobs,” she murmured, resting her head on my shoulder. “I can't wait to get a job, Mattie.”

I fell asleep, shivering, curled up with Ciara. 

But as quickly as I slipped into slumber, I awoke to a flashlight blinding me. 

My first instinct was to scream, but then I saw the face behind the light. Mom. 

“Get up, honey.” She gently pulled me to my feet, wrapping her arms around me. 

I didn't realize I was crying, until my body was trembling, my arms squeezed around my mother.

She smelled like daffodils and her favorite perfume. Mom pulled away, pressing a finger to her lips. “We’re going to stay with Grammy, all right?” she whispered. 

Mom gestured for Ciara to follow, but the girl shuffled back, shaking her head of blonde curls. Ciara curled into herself, wrapping her arms around her knees. 

“My Mom is a traitor to the town,” she whispered. Her eyes were vacant. Hollow. 

Her smile unwavered, fingers gripping the material of her dress. 

“Mom *thinks* she knows what is best for me— but I *want* to be a part of The Future Work Initiative.” 

Mom’s eyes darkened, but she stepped back. “Ciara, honey, I want you to come with me and I promise I will keep you safe.”

Ciara lifted her head, settling us with a smile. “If you try to take me away, I will start screaming.”

Mom wanted to save Ciara, but I told her not to bother. 

The girl would take pleasure in me being captured. 

Mom easily dragged me out of the sheriff’s station, and to my surprise, half a dozen other kids boarded a stolen school bus on the edge of the sidewalk. 

I didn't ask *how* she had saved them, promptly ignoring the body of a man slumped on the sidewalk. 

“He's unconscious,” Mom said quickly, pulling me onto the bus. 

I wondered where all of the other guards were. 

“Daniel?” Mom was speaking into a phone, sliding into the driver's seat. “Yeah, I've got fifteen of them, including my daughter. Yeah, I just need passports for fifteen kids.”

Mom paused, forcing the keys into the ignition. 

“Mom?” I pressed my face against the glass of the window, my gaze glued to the man on the sidewalk. “Is that man dead?”

“Sit down, Mattie.” was all she said, stamping on the gas. 

Mom’s plan to help us escape on a school bus was equal parts genius and stupid. 

I mean, a random woman driving a school bus full of fourth graders in the middle of the night?

Definitely suspicious. 

I stayed as still as possible at the back of the bus, knees tucked to my chest, arms wrapped around my backpack. 

There were fifteen of us, but all I really saw were familiar faces in a sea of purple. The ones Mom saved. 

Cassie was crying, her face buried in her lap. Kaian was trying to comfort her, but he wasn’t doing a very good job. 

Zach was still standing, his fingers wrapped tightly around a yellow pole as the bus swayed with every turn. I noticed his mandatory purple shirt under a jacket hanging off of him. His eyes were wide, his teeth gritted. 

“Are we *there* yet?” he asked, his voice flying up in octaves when she slammed on the brakes, almost sending him flying. 

Mom didn’t even look back, hands glued to the wheel. 

When Zach asked again, she used her warning voice.

“Sit *down*, Zach.”

“How do we even know we can trust you?” he demanded. He twisted to me, his eyes accusing. 

“Mattie’s mom could be leading us right into a trap—and back to our parents.”

“Zach, you know that's not true,” my mom said softly. “I know you're all scared,  but I'm going to take you somewhere safe.”

“Where?” Zach snapped. “Are you taking us to be chopped up?”

“Somewhere *safe*.” 

“Okay, but *where*?” he wailed, his voice breaking. 

“Canada.”

“Canada?!” he squeaked, almost toppling over. 

“Zach.” Mom’s tone hardened. “I am losing my patience with you. Please sit *down*.”

He didn’t sit, staying stubbornly upright, letting the bus swing him back and forth. 

I caught his gaze following each house we passed, his bottom lip wobbling. 

“If I'm sitting down, I can't run away,” he said through gritted teeth. In the normal days of our town, he was a teacher’s pet. 

Insufferable, but harmless—as long as I remembered to finish my homework.

Zach was the type of kid who announced at the end of class, “Umm, what about homework?” 

This Zach was… different.

I wasn't sure I liked this version of him. 

I noticed we were passing his parents' house, and he ducked immediately, pressing his hand over his mouth. 

I watched the teacher’s pet crumble, coming apart as we flew past the familiar bright red of his mother’s front door. 

Other kids around us were instinctively bowing their heads, crawling under their seats. We were nowhere near our home, but I too pressed my face into the sweet smell of my backpack, breathing in the scent of home. I was too scared to cry. 

I was too scared to unravel my own body, my knees so tightly pressed to my chest, I thought I was going to suffocate. 

“Zach.” Mom’s voice was like warm water coming over me. “Talk to me, honey,” she spoke softly, coaxing Zach into his seat.

He slumped down with a sob, half off of the seat, already ready to run if needed. 

“I *hate* her,” he whispered into his knees, his hands balled into fists. 

“Zach, you know your mother loves you—” Mom started to say, before he let out a scream, slamming his fists against the window. 

"Shut up," he spat at my mom through a sob. "You... you don't know what you're talking about! Mom made me wear this stupid shirt," he said, tugging at the material, his lips curling in disgust. "And she's going to let them cut me up into little pieces!"

“It's not cutting us up into little pieces, moron,” Kaian grumbled. “It's just our brain.”

“No, that's *wrong*,” Cassie whispered. “I read the flyer. They're going to cut us up.”

“Then how will we be able to *work*?” Kaian shot back, tugging at his blonde curls. “If they cut us up into like, tiny little pieces, there won't be anything left of us.”

I thought Mom was going to say something reassuring, that Zach’s mother was just scared. But then I saw my mother’s fingers tighten around the wheel, her lip curling in disgust. “You're right,” she said softly. 

“Zach, your mother is brainwashed.” Mom twisted around to shoot him a small smile. 

“But I'm going to take you far away from her, all right? You're not going to be scared again.”

She raised her voice, and it felt right. Comforting. 

For the first time in so long, I actually felt safe. 

“That goes for *all* of you,” my mother spoke up. “I'm going to keep you all safe.”

I want to tell you that my rights ended in a series of events. 

I want to tell you that we were caught, and my mother was dragged away, screaming. 

But the reality is, my rights ended with a BANG. 

I thought it was a blown tire, or maybe we had run over a cat. 

But then the screams slammed into me—agonizing wails that wouldn’t leave my head. I was only aware of my mother’s body sitting rigid, and the splintered glass of the bus’s windscreen.

When men and women in black filed onto the bus, yanking us from our seats, I was paralyzed at the back, watching the slow dripping red slide down the windscreen. 

Mom. 

I remember diving forwards. I remember screaming for her. 

But already, I was in a stranger’s arms who smelled like shoe polish and grease. I was carried off of the bus, screaming, and when I looked back, my mom wasn't moving. 

One of the soldiers kicked the heel of his boot into her head, and she slid off of the seat, unmoving, almost like trickling water. 

The thing about grieving is, I learned it was  a long process. 

It was a drawn out process. 

When my grandpappy died, I didn't feel the pain instantly. It was more like a sinking feeling that never really went away.  

But with Mom, I wasn't allowed to grieve. I didn't have *time* to grieve. 

By the time I was fully registering my mother was dead, I was dressed in a purple dress that stuck to my skin, and felt like fire ants, standing outside my new parents front door– a tall man wearing a mask held my hand, and no matter how many times I tugged away, he held tighter. 

Zach was standing behind me, his eyes unseeing. 

He kept nudging me. 

“What are we going to do?”

“Mattie, what do we do now?”

“Mattie, please! Tell me what we are going to do!”

I didn't respond. I was thinking about my mother’s brains dripping down the bus window. 

When the door opened, our new mother welcomed us with open arms. 

She was a big woman with curly hair, and a wide smile. 

“Matilda!” she wrapped her arms around me, pulling Zach into the embrace. 

“Oh, and you must be Zach! Hello, darlings! I’m so happy to be adding to our little family! Wait until you meet your brother!”

Zach wriggled out of her arms, tossing me a look. 

*“Brother?”*

Introducing herself as Mrs H, she led us into a brightly lit kitchen, where a familiar face sat, his head of brown curls buried in a brand new edition of The Future Work Initiative– this time, a kid-friendly booklet. 

Casper. 

Behind me, I could sense Zach stiffening up.

Casper regarded us with a smile, peeking over the booklet. 

“Hello, fellow *siblings*,” he said, his grin widening when Zach mumbled a curse under his breath. “I'm glad you're finally joining me on this exciting journey to The Future Work Initiative!”

He turned the booklet around so we could read a simplified version of the splitting procedure, and his eyes, wide with excitement, were reveling in every word. 

“Trust me, you're going to *love* it here.”

I was still numb. Still not fully understanding my surroundings. 

What I did know was that Mrs. M’s kitchen smelled like stew—and the bowl of stew in front of my classmate was there one minute, and then it was being dumped on Casper's head.

Casper didn't move, a slew of gravy and potatoes dripping down his face. 

“That's what The Future Work Initiative helps with, Zach,” he spoke calmly, prodding the booklet, reciting every word. 

“It removes *violent* tenancies, which you *clearly* have.” Leaning back in his chair, he settled us with a smirk. “It's not *my* fault you're ‘expressing violent behavior’.”

Zach definitely proved he had ‘violent behavior’ that night.

We were sent to our rooms with no dessert. 

I checked the windows in my room. All locked. 

From that day, I was forced into The Future Work Initiative. 

School was no longer a thing. Instead of learning, we went to church every day. 

Followed by afternoon cherry picking, helping town elders. 

Before you think *child labor*, it wasn't that. 

The work was primarily completed by elders. 

We just watched, and if we wanted to, could join in. 

Mrs M assigned me and my brothers to a farm on the edge of town– and admittedly, I kind of enjoyed it. I got to look after the animals, pick and grow fruit, and learn how to work the machinery with the farmers. 

I think part of me was hyper fixating on anything that wasn't thinking about my mother.

When I finished my farm work one night, Zach pulled me into the cornfield, where, to my surprise, he'd fashioned a grave for my mother. I didn't thank him. I accepted the rose he picked out for me, lay it down on the ground, and broke apart in his arms. 

When I turned thirteen, Mrs M surprised me with mandatory classes after dinner.

Classes weren't allowed. 

According to the new rule, educating children in any way was a criminal offense.

So, when Mrs M broke out hidden workbooks, piling them in front of us, I realized she was actively educating us. 

Casper wasn't a fan. Obviously. But he had missed actually doing *work*. 

He threatened to tell the authorities, until Zach *”threatened* to break his legs. 

So, after dinner, every day, the three of us had five hours of school in the basement. 

Casper refused to join in at first, hiding behind The Future Work Initiative books. 

But, slowly, he started to shift towards us, at first silently watching me complete a test (and trying, multiple times) to correct me. 

“You're doing it *wrong*,” Casper grumbled, sitting with his knees to his chest. 

I ignored him, but I could feel his eyes burning holes into my exam paper. 

“Question 3 is simple, and you're *supposed* to show your working.”

He was right. 

I started to scribble my working, and he let out an exaggerated sigh. 

“Mattie, you're *killing* me.”

Zach, embedded in his own workbook, finally slammed it down in frustration. 

He didn't speak, snatching up a blank workbook, scribbling Casper's name on the front, and throwing at the boy’s head. 

“Harsh.” Casper mumbled. But he did open the workbook, grabbing a pen. 

His eyes flicked to me, lips curling. “Just so you know, I'm only doing this because you two are too stupid to do it on your own.”

Casper started joining us for every lesson, afterwards. 

He started doing his own tests, and even requesting more books for him to read. 

Growing into a teenager, I started to realize my procedure wasn't far away. 

I was sixteen years old, still working the fields, picking fruit, and going to church, but also, I was getting ready for my SAT’s in secret. Mrs M had managed to get her hands on old papers from years before, but it was enough. 

Zach questioned her, halfway through a  pop quiz. 

“What's the point?” he said, his pen lodged between his teeth. Zach was boyishly handsome, hiding under thick brown curls.

He was also seriously crushing on the guy who delivered our town-mandated newspapers. “Why are you helping us with our SAT’s if we’re not going to college?”

“I second that.” I spoke up, looking up from my work. “You're working *with* them.”

Mrs M sighed, before kneeling on the ground. 

“I tell you this once, and only once,” she said softly. “Yes, I may very well agree with The Future Work Initiative. But I also stand for children getting a proper education.”

Her eyes flicked to me. “Make no mistake, Matilda. I *will* be delivering you to the splitting bay. But first, you will be  correctly educated, so you can enter the world as fully functioning intelligent adults.”

“But what if we don't *want* to?” Zach spoke with gritted teeth. 

I nudged him to shut up, but he was already straightening up. 

“Mrs M, you've been teaching me since I was a kid, and I appreciate that,” he whispered. “I wouldn't know what the fuck I was doing if you didn't let me continue school.”

“Language, Zach.”

“Sorry.” he rolled his eyes. “You just said you believe in our rights to be educated, but you're happy sending us to be cut up?”

Mrs M didn't speak. Even Casper was silent, gaze glued to his workbook. 

Casper had changed over the years. I think he'd regained his love for learning. 

(and being a pretentious, know-it-all little shit). 

There was an ominous silence, before he coughed awkwardly. 

“I believe in The Future Work Initiative,” Casper said softly, dragging his pen across the floor. He was cross legged, a book on his lap. “But… I think it should be a choice.”

Casper rolled his eyes when Zach balked at him. 

“Maybe.”

Mrs M startled us by slamming her own book on the floor. 

“That's *enough,*” she said. But her expression was eerily familiar to my forty grade teacher before she abandoned us. She looked hopeless. Scared. Confused. 

Mrs M’s tone darkened. “If you speak another *word*, you can forget dessert.”

We did shut up, but already, I think our new mother was having her own doubts. 

Still. Zach and I made plans to run. Casper hung around us. 

“I'm *not* coming with you.” he kept insisting, but he never left our side. 

On the day of The Split, we would attend church, go back to the house, and be escorted by our mother to the splitting bay. 

Our plan was to sneak out of church, and make a run for it. 

What we weren't expecting, however, was Mrs M to give us a direct way out. 

On the day I would be split, I stuffed my face with pancakes.

I was eighteen years old. I was supposed to be going to college. 

I was *supposed*  to have an idea of what I wanted to do with my life. 

But all my ‘idea’ was to escape my town, and live peacefully. 

“Morning.” Zach said, sipping coffee. His prolonged gaze meant he was still ready to run. 

I gave him a simple jerk of my head, twisting around and pouring my cereal. 

“You two are painfully obvious,” Casper grumbled from behind an *actual* book. 

“But you're coming.” Zach breathed to him in passing, going straight for the cookies. 

Casper didn't look up from his book. “Of course I'm *coming*.”

Mrs M greeted us at breakfast, before dropping the bombshell. 

“There will be a car waiting for you outside in five minutes,” she said stiffly, tears filling her eyes. “I want you, with zero questions, to get in the back, and do not look back.”

I didn't know what to say. I hugged her. I cried. 

Zach and I embraced our mother, and at that moment I really did think we were a family. 

Casper stood with a curled lip, for maybe 0.1 seconds, before joining in. 

Mrs M told us to pack a bag. There were no hugs goodbye, no tearful thank yous, though I did promise to contact her once we were out of town.

She guarded the door, and when we were ready, ushered us out, down the lawn, and straight into the back of a sleek range rover. I jumped in, followed by Zach, and finally, Casper, squeezing himself between the two of us. 

We were free. 

I only let out a sigh of relief when we were far away from Mrs M’s house. 

“You kids all right?” the driver, a youngish looking man, spoke up after a long silence. 

I didn't respond. 

Next to me, Zach was shaking, his hands clasped in his lap. 

"We're fine," Casper said after nudging me to respond. "It's nothing a little therapy—for, I don't know, the rest of our fucking lives—won't fix."

The driver laughed heartily. “Good! Do you kids mind if I play a little music?”

He stabbed the radio on, regardless of our response. 

I liked the song. I don't know it, but the lyrics stuck with me as I crumpled into rich leather seats, letting my head tip back, my eyes flickering shut, reveling in the music. 

Tell me lies, 

Tell me sweet little lies

Something, something, I'm not making plans. 

I didn't realize I was dozing off, until Casper nudged me. 

Hard. 

“Hey.” he whispered, and my eyes shot open. “Mattie. Something is wrong.”

Next to me, Zach’s head had found my shoulder. 

But in front of me, something was thick and foggy. 

I think I laughed, tipping my head back. I felt a panic surge, but my body was already numb. 

Mrs M already knew we were going to escape. 

So, in the most gentle, and yet horrific way possible, she was delivering on her earlier words. 

What a fucking *bitch*. 

I don't remember how I got from a car to being strapped down to a hospital bed. There was a bright, clinical light above me. 

A tube stuck down my throat. 

“Mattie? Sweetie, do we have your consent to begin the procedure?”

The voice came from the figure looming over me. 

I told her, “No.” and she responded with: “Great! Count down from twenty, Mattie!”

Where were my brothers? I felt my body jerk violently under harsh velcro straps. 

“Count for me, sweetheart,” the nurse hummed in my ear. 

I did. 

I mean, I tried. 

Outside, I could hear thudding footsteps, loud wails. 

“Let me *go*!” 

I couldn't grasp the voice; my mind was already unraveling. 

I was partially aware of clinical white gloves hovering over me. 

I counted backwards from 20. 

19.

18.

17.

16.

15.

14.

13.

12.

11.

10.

I can only describe it as a flash, like a photo being taken. 

I blinked once, and those sterile white gloves were covered in blood. 

I blinked twice, and I was screeching into the tube forced down my throat. 

Three times. 

“Matilda?”

Slumped in front of me, spread out on a leather chair, was my new boss. Tall, oldish, and grinning like a fucking freak. 

I was sitting, one leg crossed over the other, in a large office. I wore a perfectly pressed dress, my hair pinned into a ponytail. It really *was* a blink of the eye. 

I didn't even feel time passing. 

I was twenty four years old, and I *felt* twenty four years old. 

“Matilda, I'm sorry, is there a problem?” My boss jerked my attention back to him. 

“No.” I said, my voice a lot deeper. “No, there's no problem.” 

I stood, holding my hand out for him to shake. His hand was clammy. Slimy. “I'm looking forward to working with you, sir.”

“As we are with *you*!” He grinned. “Matilda, as you know, you are very well known here, and all across town of course! We are *very* excited for you to be joining us!”

He was right. 

Everyone LOVED me. 

Well, they loved *her*. 

I just wasn't *aware* I was her until I fully woke up. 

I got a standing ovation when I entered the office. 

I had my own desk set up, and I knew where everything was. I could type perfectly, answer phones, and finish paperwork with perfect efficiency. I had a car I knew how to drive, and a luxury apartment. 

But I was increasingly getting strange looks. 

Initially, I thought I had something on my face. 

Colleagues would just *stare* at me with unnerving smiles that turned my stomach. 

“Be honest,” one of my older colleagues hissed, leaning over my desk. “How much *do* you remember?”

I stopped typing an email, turning to her. “Meaning?”

I didn't mean for my voice to come out so cold, so clinical. 

She didn't seem to mind, leaning *closer*. “You know,” she whispered, her breath in my ear. “What you kids did out there. I mean, yeah, they cut it all out,” she let out a spluttered laugh. “But surely, it, I don't know, it… *stays* with you, right?”

“It was for the benefit of The Future Work Initiative.” the words slipped out of my mouth before I could bite them back. 

The woman raised a brow. “Come on, Matilda,” she nudged me. “Or Mattie, as we all know you as. You can't fool us.” 

I don't know why, but her words sent my stomach into my throat. 

I excused myself, running to the bathroom, her words were like bile filling my mouth. 

But I didn’t puke. I *couldn't* puke. 

I went to grab coffee to calm myself down, and slammed directly into another colleague. 

I only saw his crisp white shirt and tie, a blazer hung over the top. 

Then I saw his name tag.

“Watch where you're going,” the man grumbled, shoving his way past me. 

It sounded like he had something in his mouth. 

Instinctively, I grabbed his arm, yanking him back, and he choked something up, bending over, and spitting it on the floor. 
 
The sight sent me into fight or flight, a feeling I'd never experienced before. 

On the ground at our feet, was a single strip of raw bacon.  

Before I could question it, the man scooped up the bacon, and dropped it into his mouth, vacant eyes briefly finding mine. 

“Matilda,” he said, through a mouthful. “Nice to see you again.”

He started toward me suddenly, hesitantly, leaning close, his breath tickling my cheek. 

I was expecting him to speak, maybe tell me he missed me. 

But instead, to my confusion, he buried his face in my hair, sniffing deeply. 

I knew him. 

I knew his slick red lips, razor sharp teeth scathing the back of my neck. 

His heavy pants as he chased me, cupping his mouth, screeching animal calls.

I knew his wide vacant eyes, his animalistic chitters. 

The force of the memory slamming into me almost sent me crumbling to my knees. 

I wasn't in the office anymore.

I was running. 

The ground was uneven beneath my feet, and I was stumbling, staggering, over grass up to my knees. 

I dropped into a crawl, my breaths heavy, forcing my way through the dirt. 

Above me, through a thick canopy of trees, the sun was already setting. 

Footsteps. 

Growing louder.

Lunging into a sprint, I remember the feeling of branches smacking in my face, something caked into my skin, my mouth full of rust. Breathing hurt. Everything hurt.

“Mattie, *stop*!”

Someone broke out through the trees, a figure coming towards me. 

I almost collapsed in relief, a cry escaping my lips. 

Zach. 

Eighteen year old Zach. He was caked in dirt, his hair was grown out, longer, almost to his shoulders. He gestured me forwards, frantically waving his hands. 

I did stop, skidding to a halt. 

“They've bugged the ground!” Zach yelled. “Go *slowly*.”

The footsteps behind me were getting closer. 

Their laughter rode the wind, animal-like squawking. 

I heard one of them coming to a stop– and in front of me, Zach was still watching me. 

He didn't see the sharpened spear coming from behind him. 

Which impaled him right through the fucking brain. 

The animals, no, the freaks following us, ignored me, lunging straight for his body. 

Casper was first, diving onto him, tearing into his face, grinning wildly. Laughing. 

“*Matilda?”*

My boss was standing in front of me, waving his hand in my face. 

“Are you all right?”

Behind me, Casper's eyes were glued to me. He pulled a stringy piece of chicken from his teeth, dangling it teasingly, his smile growing, revealing spiky incisors. 

I told my boss I was fine, and he invited me to speak to him at lunch. 

I avoided Casper like the plague, my bosses order sending me to his office at exactly noon. It's like I couldn't even stop myself. I had no control over my own body. 

I knocked on rich mahogany, his response more of a gruff laugh. 

“Come in, Matilda.”

I walked in, but I had only gotten two steps over the threshold. My boss was watching something being projected on the wall. He was slumped in his chair, legs resting on his desk, his lips stretched into a wide grin. 

Slowly, I turned my attention to what he was watching. 

On the screen, to my confusion, was Zach. 

Twenty year old Zach. 

Covered in blood, grinning like an animal, wide, monstrous eyes penetrating the camera. When the camera started toward him, he lurched back like a startled deer. 

His fingers were already in the belt of his filthy jeans, wrapping around a knife. 

“Zach!” town reporters were yelling at him. “Zachary! How are you feeling, young man? Did you know you're famous in this town?”

The reporter laughed. “Young man, how does it feel to be a god?”

The screen flickered off, and I blinked, my attention finding my boss. 

“Great work today, Matilda!” he said, leaning back in his chair. “You can go.”

His grotesque fucking smile told me everything I needed to know. 

Then I left the building and went back to my apartment. 

I checked my legs, my arms, every patch of my skin. 

I'm covered in scars. Gashes they have cruelly stitched together. 

Look, I know this just in my town– and I KNOW I sound crazy. 

But whatever happened to me, to us, I don't think it prepared us for the workforce. 

They've turned me into *something*. 

I'm so fucking scared. I don't know what to do.

Edit: I'm pretty sure Casper is stalking my apartment. He's outside right now.

I think he can *smell* me.
