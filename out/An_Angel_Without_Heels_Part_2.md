I haven’t gone back to those bathrooms. I don’t want to risk seeing that man again. But who was he? Did he just want intimacy? If I had given in, would it have ended up as nothing more than a casual encounter? I’m grateful it didn’t happen—especially after what came later.

Was he human? Of course he was! He touched me. I felt him. Context aside, he spoke like a normal person and even had a smell to him. And yet, the peculiar beauty he possessed felt like a trap—one that invited you to touch, to desire, to fall…

I never told anyone about that encounter, for obvious reasons, and reporting it was never an option. What would I have said? *“I was cruising in a bathroom and a strange man got into a scuffle with me.”*

That person. I have to write it a hundred times to convince myself.

He was human.  
He was human.  
He was human.  
He was human.  
He was human…

Would you believe me if I told you that, to my misfortune, I saw him again a few weeks later?

I usually go to a local cinematheque where they screen independent and amateur films. That day, they were showing several short films—mystery, horror, suspense. I went alone because, let’s say, that kind of cinema is another one of my guilty pleasures. My social circle is just as rigid as my mindset: I only see the potential for social death behind every action.

There weren’t many people there, as usual, but the concession line was delayed—also as usual—because someone paid with a large bill and they didn’t have enough change. When it was finally my turn, it took longer than normal for them to hand me my popcorn.

I sat right in the middle of the theater. It was a normal cinema, upholstered in red. I turned off my phone and felt the lights dim. A few people arrived after the screening had already started and quietly took their seats. The only thing I feared was falling asleep, like the last time I watched another so-called “horror” movie.

Everything went on normally until halfway through the program. When I was fully absorbed, I felt a slight movement behind me. I turned my head—and there he was.

Lit by the glow of the screen, he looked even more beautiful and more unsettling than the first time. His blue eyes settled on me as his mouth opened, agitated, as if he were trying to say something. His hands remained hidden among the popcorn and other snacks he had bought. I couldn’t make out what he was wearing, but he was just as covered up as before.

I froze in my seat. I wanted to leave; my whole body was warning me that I was in danger. Still, he was faster than I was.

There was no one sitting beside me, so it wasn’t hard for him to take the seat next to mine. I only caught a glimpse of the end of his quick, tiptoe walk as I heard a faint murmur behind me. He placed his gloved hand on my shoulder and whispered:

“I want to apologize for what happened the other day. I acted without thinking, and it’s just that… I’m not used to looking for… that… there. I was really nervous…”

Was I being too paranoid? Even so, I didn’t let my guard down. His words sounded rehearsed, clichéd.

“You’re a regular, aren’t you? I’ve seen you at some of my premieres. It’s easy to recognize the four or five people who come often. You always enjoy it when they torture me on screen, huh?”

*My premieres?* I wondered, confused. And then it hit me—the familiarity I had felt from the very beginning. I knew I’d seen him somewhere before, even if at that moment I couldn’t recall any of his films. You had to admit that sometimes you watched one and you’d basically watched them all. Within their respective genres, they were far too similar.

Curiosity got the better of fear. Even though I kept an eye on his movements, I continued watching the screen, wondering which short film he would appear in. He stayed silent the entire time, and after each short I told myself, *“The last one and I’m leaving.”*  
*“Why don’t you run?”*  
*“Go.”*

And yet, I didn’t leave. Maybe his snake-charmer power was getting to me again. I don’t know how I endured it for so long.

Until he finally appeared on screen.

A group of sadists were driving angel wings into his back as he screamed—such pitiful screams they made my skin crawl. That’s when I realized why I hadn’t recognized him. Aside from the fact that his scenes were probably brief, the screen always showed his gaunt version.

When it ended, he said abruptly:

“I don’t like that movie. I’m leaving. Keep my snacks.”

He stood up and walked away, leaving me stunned. I was afraid to leave and find him waiting for me outside. Obviously, I didn’t touch anything he had left behind. I almost lost my appetite entirely, but I decided to wait until the screening ended and leave along with everyone else. I even thought about approaching a few familiar faces—people who also attended regularly and with whom I occasionally exchanged a word or a greeting. Though I kept my distance, I was usually polite. Maybe I could comment on the film, just so I wouldn’t have to leave alone. I don’t know. I would think of something.

But then… a strange taste flooded my mouth—a mix of bitter and sweet.

Using my phone’s flashlight, I noticed that the popcorn at the bottom of the bucket was soaked in a whitish liquid I couldn’t identify. I remembered how long it had taken them to serve me and, in that moment, I understood.

It had to have been him.

Was he more than just an actor premiering films at this theater? Was I inside his lair?

I didn’t stop to think about it. I left almost running, disgusted.
