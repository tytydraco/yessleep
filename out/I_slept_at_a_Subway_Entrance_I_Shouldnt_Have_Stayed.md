I shouldn't have spent the night there, but New York City deceives you when the sun goes down. The lights, the constant noise, the false sense that you're never completely alone. I thought that if I found a place sheltered from the wind, I could hold out until dawn without any problems.

I wasn't a homeless person. I kept telling myself that as I walked with my backpack on my back. I had an education, I had worked, I even had a bus ticket for the next morning. Sleeping on the street was a one-off decision, a bad night in a life that was still salvageable. At least that's what I believed then.

I chose the side entrance of a closed subway station, one of those entrances shut down for construction that never progresses. The glass was covered with dust and old posters, and the stairwell descended a few meters before being blocked by a gate. The wind didn't blow as hard there.

I found several dry cardboard boxes leaning against the wall, stacked in layers. They weren't scattered randomly. Someone had carefully arranged them to form a more or less uniform surface. I hesitated for a few seconds, but the cold was numbing my fingers, and pride always loses when the body begins to fail.

I spread my sleeping bag on top, took off my boots and put them inside my backpack so they wouldn't harden, and got in without undressing. The ground still transmitted the cold accumulated throughout the day, which slowly rose up my back and settled in my bones. I turned off my cell phone to save battery and stared at the dull reflection of my face in the dirty glass.

New York City was still alive above. Cars, a distant shout, the rattling of the last subway underground. It reassured me to think that, even though no one could see me, I was surrounded by people.

I fell into a half-sleep, that uncomfortable state where the body rests but the mind remains alert. That's when I heard footsteps. I don't know if that happened before or after I closed my eyes.

They weren't normal footsteps. They had no rhythm. They sounded shuffling, slow, with an irregularity that didn't fit with someone simply walking. I sat up in my sleeping bag and listened. The footsteps stopped just as they reached the subway entrance.

I held my breath. I shouldn't have slept outdoors. Now I regretted not going to a hostel. And all to save a few coins.

Several seconds passed. Then, a different sound: a long, deep exhalation, too close. I opened the sleeping bag a little and poked my head out.

There was a man standing in front of me.

I couldn't tell his age. He could have been thirty or sixty. He was very thin, sickly thin, with clothes hanging off him as if they had been put on a body that no longer existed. He was wearing a torn jacket and had his hands in his pockets. His skin was dull, grayish, and his lips were bruised.

He stared at me.

“It's cold here,” he said.

His voice was hoarse, but not weak. There was something strange about it, a dry echo that didn't seem to come only from his throat.

“My name is Daniel. I'm just spending the night,” I replied. “I'm leaving in the morning.”

I don't know why I felt the need to justify myself.

The man slowly bowed his head.

“I've spent nights here too,” he said. “Many.”

He took a step toward me. I noticed a sour, old smell, a mixture of dampness and something else that was harder to identify.

“I don't want any trouble,” I added, beginning to feel fear rising in my stomach.

He smiled. It wasn't a friendly smile. It was a grimace that revealed uneven, badly worn teeth.

“Nobody wants trouble,” he replied. “Nobody wants to stay here.”

He bent down with difficulty and rested one hand on the ground, right on top of the cardboard boxes. His hand went through one of the layers and touched the cement directly.

“This is where I slept,” he continued. “Right here.”

I reached into my backpack without taking my eyes off him and pulled out a small flask.

“Here,” I said. “For the cold.”

The man looked down at the metal, surprised. For a moment I thought he would accept it, but he slowly shook his head.

“No,” he replied. “I quit drinking many years ago.”

I put the flask away, uncomfortable.

“Alcohol ruined my life,” he added. “More than the cold ever could.”

I didn't know how to respond. I nodded silently. He looked at me again, and for the first time, I saw no threat in his face, only something resembling a very old weariness.

“Here, this will help you get through the nights outdoors.”

He gave me a small picture of the Virgin Mary. It was wrinkled and faded. I put it in my coat pocket.

The wind stopped suddenly, as if someone had closed an invisible door. My breath was no longer a thick cloud, and I felt the coat begin to warm up again.

“What do you want?” I asked, my voice trembling.

He looked up and met my eyes.

“I don't want anything,” he said. “They've already taken everything from me.”

He stood up awkwardly and took another step toward me. Then I saw it clearly: his feet weren't quite touching the ground. They were floating a few inches above it, just enough to make sense of the dragging sound from before.

I tried to get up, but my body wouldn't respond. The cold had numbed my legs, and fear had completely paralyzed me.

“I fell asleep,” he continued. “I thought I could hold out until dawn. Just like you.”

His face was getting closer and closer. I felt pressure on my chest, an invisible weight that prevented me from breathing normally.

“I didn't feel the car,” he whispered. “Only the impact. Then this cold. Always this cold.”

I screamed. Or tried to. No sound came out.

The man reached out a hand toward me and placed it on my chest. I didn't feel his skin, but the cold became unbearable, piercing me like an electric shock.

“Don't worry,” he said. “There's always a moment when they stop feeling it.”

He slowly withdrew his hand. The cold remained, but it no longer pierced my chest with the same violence. He looked at me for a few more seconds, as if he wanted to make sure of something.

“Don't stay,” he said. “If you stay, it won't be me you'll find.”

Then he took a step back.

Then another.

His figure began to lose definition, as if the light coming in from the street couldn't quite reach him. The shuffling sound could be heard again, soft, growing fainter and fainter, until it disappeared completely into the darkness of the stairwell.

Silence returned.

I don't remember when I got back into the sleeping bag. Exhaustion fell upon me suddenly, heavily, and I closed my eyes without thinking. The cold was still there, but it was no longer the only thing I felt. I slept poorly, in fits and starts, with confused dreams and a constant feeling of being about to wake up.

It was a noise that woke me from my sleep.

It wasn't a knock. It was a distant murmur, the beginning of the day filtering in from the street. The first traffic. A blind being raised. Dawn.

I sat up awkwardly. My body ached, stiff from the cold and poor posture. I gathered up my sleeping bag and backpack as best I could and started up the stairs to the subway entrance, intending to get out as soon as possible.

When I was almost at the top, I felt a sharp push in the back. “Fuck,” I muttered, before losing my balance. It wasn't a stumble. It was a clear, deliberate blow.

I lost my balance and fell forward, hitting the edge of the sidewalk. Pain shot through my ankle as I landed badly. I cried out and reached for my leg, feeling it begin to swell.

I tried to get up, but before I could, something grabbed my foot. I didn't feel hands. I didn't feel fingers. I felt a shapeless force pulling me back with a precision that was anything but human. There was something about the way it grabbed me that wasn't a hand, but it wasn't anything else I could name either.

It dragged me across the ground, straight toward the road. The wheels of a car passed just inches from my head.

I kicked as hard as I could, scratching the asphalt with my hands, while that pressure pulled at my ankle with blind, insistent determination.

Then I saw it. A car was coming down the street, still slow, but getting closer. Its headlights blinded me for a moment, and I understood, with icy clarity, that it wasn't trying to hold me back: it wanted to drag me a little further. Just enough.

The force pulled again, guiding me toward the center of the road, to the exact spot where the wheels couldn't avoid me. I heard the engine getting closer. The asphalt vibrated beneath my body.

I screamed, but the sound was lost amid the noise of traffic awakening the city. For a second, I was absolutely certain it wasn't going to let go of me. Without meaning to, I felt the pocket where the little stamp was.

And then, suddenly, the pressure disappeared.

I lay on the road, my heart racing and my ankle burning, just as the car slammed on the brakes a few inches from my body. For a few seconds, all I could hear was my own breathing.

Then, a different noise. A broom dragging across the ground.

“Hey,” said a voice. "Calm down. 

Don't move. My name is Mike.

I turned my head with difficulty. A man in a reflective vest was approaching from the sidewalk, looking at me with concern.

“I thought you were going to kill yourself,” he added. “You were so close.”

I tried to sit up, but my body felt heavy.

“What happened?” I asked.

The street sweeper leaned on his broom and looked at me with a mixture of reproach and relief.

“You're lucky,” he replied. “A car almost hit you. You rolled out of there,” he pointed to the subway entrance, “as if someone had pushed you.”

I put my hand on my chest. Under my clothes, my skin was cold and sore.

“There was no one there,” I murmured.

The street sweeper was silent for a few seconds.

“That's what they always say,” he replied at last. “But that's not a good place to sleep. It never has been.”

He stared at the subway entrance and added:

"Not long ago, a car ran over a man who was sleeping in that gap. His name was Walter. He wasn't bothering anyone. He always left his cardboard boxes neatly stacked and picked everything up in the morning before he left.

He paused briefly.

“Some of us brought him coffee when it was cold. He was a good guy.”

“People said he was drunk,” the street sweeper continued. “That's why he didn't see the car coming.”

I shook my head slowly.

“He didn't drink,” I said. “He told me last night.”

Mike stopped sweeping.

He looked at me without surprise, without disbelief. He just held my gaze for a few seconds.

“Then you saw something,” he said.

I didn't answer.

“Listen,” he added. “Never use alcohol to warm yourself up. It deceives you. It puts you to sleep. And then what happens happens.”

He pointed his chin toward the corner.

"Go to Joe's Diner. It's right there. Tell him Mike sent you. Have some coffee and pancakes. It's on me.

“That's not necessary,” I began to say.

He smiled.

“And get a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich,” he added. “A real one.”

I was speechless.

“That takes care of breakfast and lunch for you today,” he said, picking up the broom again. If you really want to thank me...

He looked up one last time.

“Sleep in a hostel tonight.”

He went back to sweeping, ending the conversation.

I got up slowly and walked away without looking back. As I passed the subway entrance, I saw the cardboard boxes back in their place, clean, lined up, waiting for someone else to believe that it was just cold.

I remembered the little picture. I looked at it closely.

It was of the Virgin of Covadonga.

If what I had seen was Walter's ghost, how was it possible that I now had it in my hands?

What was that force that wanted to throw me under the wheels of a car?

I'm sure Walter tried to protect me from it.
