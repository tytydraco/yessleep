July 26, 2017. I finally received my license as a real estate agent. I can officially start selling homes to buyers whose dreams are to start a life in a beautiful domicile. I signed up with an agency right away and said goodbye to my draining call center job. I’ve been representing clients for the past 5 years to help them get their dream home and 90 percent of the time, I always get them the house. I don’t mean to brag but if you check my reviews on yelp you’ll see that every client praises me and it always reads “Ask for Shelia, she’s the best”. I take pride in my job and I love what I do, every client I’ve always had leave’s satisfied. I’ve only had one client who’s offer was rejected but I was able to get them a better house with double the square foot at 100 thousand less. The joy I give, in being able to provide to my clients something they call home is what makes it all worth it.  

March 16, 2021 

1101 W Hawthorne St., 2, 104 square foot, priced at 179,000. Listed at 930 pm on a Saturday night. I knew this house would get alot of applicants, it was inevitable. A nice home in a gated suburban community at less than 200,000, you bet your ass this house would get a shit load of attention. I got assigned my beloved client, her name, Lisa May.  

We had a house visit for Sunday at 3 in the afternoon as I would be showing her the place. Driving into the neighborhood felt like a dream, hell I’d be interested in the house myself if I wasn’t selling it. As usual once I arrived there were already people parked outside waiting for their appointments. I usually judge the vehicle they drive seeing if they could even afford a house, sounds wrong but in this line of business you had to know your competition. I texted Miss May but I haven’t heard from her, I found it odd since most clients would be ecstatic with text messages, but no, not Miss May, this lady was something. 

I arrived on time waiting for Miss May but she was already late. I called immediately and she answered her phone, I was caught off guard because I thought she wouldn’t answer her phone.  

“Miss May, I am outside the house waiting for you”, I said 

“I am inside the house Miss Margery” she responded.  

I was confused, how? I didn’t see anyone walk in thru the front door. I entered the home and there she was, a skinny woman walking around in the room, gazing at the ceiling.  

“Isn’t it beautiful Margery?” 

“How did you get inside the house?”, I asked.  

“I went in thru the back, I couldn’t wait one more second to come see my dream home”.   

I thought it was a bullshit excuse but I went along with it.  

“We’ll, this is the house, you can have a look around and tell me if it’s to your liking” 

“Are you kidding…I love this house miss Margery. I’ve already looked around everywhere before you came in and it’s all very beautiful, I can picture myself living in this house and growing a family.” 

“That sounds wonderful Miss May”, I said.  

“Well now, you can cancel all the appointments, I’ll be taking the house” 

The fuck, was she delusional.  

“Miss May, I can’t possibly do that” 

“Why not?” She demanded.  

“We need to give others a chance to look at the house too,” I said.  

“We’ll that’s why I asked for you in particular, I REQUESTED you personally because of your track record, this no longer is a competition, it’s a sale that’s off the market”.  

Some thing about this woman did not seem right. She looked like a 109-pound problem that I knew would leech on till she got what she wanted.  

“You will need a pre-approval before we can move forward” 

She pulled out a vanilla folder from her purse with paperwork inside.  

“I am already pre-approved and for more than the asking price, now call the owners and tell them I’ll throw in another 100 thousand Miss Margery”.  

I felt threatened, she was forcing me into this, but I had to put her in her place.  

“Miss May, i can’t simply call the owners and have them hand over the house right here, right now, that’s not the way this business works, you will need to fill out a offer letter and we can submit it to them”. 

She looked furious; she obviously didn’t like what I told her.  

“Miss Margery, I would hate to kill your good review streak with a bad one”.  

I had it.  

“Miss May, you have a good day” I exclaimed.  

I was upset, as soon as I was about to leave, she yelled wait.  

“I do apologize, I did not mean to threaten you. You just have no idea how badly I want this house. Have you ever wanted something so bad in your life, you will do anything to get it Miss Margery? I may sound like a spoiled brat, but I always get what I want, I would hate to lose this house.” 

I knew I should not have given in but as the kind of person I was I accepted her apology and advised her that everything would be fine, we just needed that offer letter. She calmed down after that and acted civil.  

“Miss Margery, we will get this house, I know it, my mother always said, if you want something you go and get it. I have faith they’ll accept my generous offer”.  

I shook her hand and she walked over to her Prius, yea... not exactly the type of car to afford this house. I waited for her offer letter that night. This didn’t feel right to me, as ruthless as I am with a sale, I knew who the good clients were and who were the bad. I received her offer letter, and I submitted it to the owners. I honestly dreaded if she couldn’t get the house because this lady was trouble from the moment, I saw her. The next day, my phone kept blowing up with her texts.  

“Any updates” it read, and I would simply reply “not yet” and to some I just wouldn’t reply, if I didn’t reply she would call me, I had at least 30 missed calls, I couldn’t stand her. 

Then, 2 days later, the house sold. But not to Miss May. When she found out the house was off the market, she called me right away. 

“Why didn’t I get my house?”, she exclaimed over the phone. She was as mad as the next crazy person. 

“Who got the house?” she demanded to know. 

In reality I didn’t know who did and even if I knew I would not tell her. 

“I don’t know Miss May, things like this happen, it’s unfortunate but I can go ahead and try and find you another house.” 

“Are you stupid? I do not want any other house. I want MY house! Now you call the owners and sort out a deal.” 

“Miss May I cannot do that.” I told her. 

It stayed silent for a minute; I could hear her breathing fuming over the phone. 

“You are useless, good for nothing, you shouldn’t even be in this business, I pity the next person that has you as an agent”. 

She hung up. 

I took the beating, but I knew that this would be the last time I heard from this crazy lunatic. Did I feel bad? Of course, what person would not but at least I had her out of my hands...and life and even better than I did not get her the house, it is the other way around, I pity the next person who has her as a client, good riddance.  

The next day I felt exhausted and didn’t want to handle anymore clients, I decided to take a week off and take a break after the mental exhaustion from Miss May, the worst part of it was this wasn’t the last time I would hear from her. 

It was a Wednesday afternoon when I was alone at my local coffee shop “Moonbeans” drinking my white mocha chocolate, when I got a text message, it was Miss May. I felt the blood drain from my face just seeing her name pop up on phone. I wanted to enjoy my vacation, she was the reason I was on it, I didn’t want to accede to her delusions, I put my phone down but the moment I did I got another message and it was from her. I opened it and it was a picture message, it was a picture of the Hawthorne house from the outside. Odd, why would she send me this, then I read the message. 

“I worked out a deal with the owners and NOW...the house is mine. I am the happiest person alive.” 

I didn’t reply. I blocked her number and continued drinking my coffee, but I could not shake her off my mind. Why did this person control my thoughts? But quite honestly, how the hell did she get the house? I’m sure she played herself like a lunatic until the owners gave in but I doubt anyone would give up a beautiful house to a maniac. I had to find out. 

I called up Fabian, a friend of mine who had sold the Hawthorne house and asked him for a favor, I asked him who he had sold the house to, and he told me it was sold to a family of five. Three children, a mother and a father, he sent me a picture of the offer letter, it was adorable, you can tell they took their time to make it, at the bottom was a picture of the happy couple with their son, daughter and a baby boy, they needed the house more than Miss May. This didn’t make any sense to me, how would the owners agree to Miss May’s offer. I went against protocol and called the original owners, I acted as a shopper. 

“Hello, I’m calling about the house you have for sale. Is it still available?” 

“No, I’m sorry, it’s already been sold”  

“If I may ask, did a Lisa May ever contact you regarding the house?” 

“I have no idea who that is and no we have not, why are you asking this question?” 

I hung up. Either Lisa was lying, or she slithered her way into the house and claimed it as her own, which sounds absurd but, in her world, plausible, I knew how bad she wanted the house, it just might sound crazy, but I think that is it.  

I threw my coffee and headed to the Hawthorne house and there it was, her green Prius car parked outside, but how? This was not an attack on my ego but how the fuck was she able to get the house THEN she stepped out, I quickly drove around the house and parked in the corner of the neighborhood hoping she would not see me.  

She looked nervous, constantly looking around and in a hurry, she walked over to the back of the house and disappeared, I wanted to drive around to see what she was doing but then I saw her pull up in an Infiniti, what the hell was going on? She drove it inside the garage and closed it, she was being quick about it as if she did not want anyone to see her. She then got inside her vehicle and parked it in the garage driveway, then I also noticed it, some red on her hands, almost looked like blood. This was extremely weird and frightening, her mannerisms were letting me know that something was wrong with this picture, she was too anxious, and it spelled out like she was trying to hide something. 

I needed to find out what was going on, do I just go up to her? do I play friendly so she can let me in? I texted her. 

“Hey, are you available right now? Would love to talk about how you got the house?”   
 

She texted right away. 

“No, I am busy right now, thanks” 

Bitch, I know what she is up to. I wanted to knock at the door, I felt like I needed to find out what was going on. I got out of my car, I texted Fabian letting him know I was making a stop at the Hawthorne house and that I would contact him in an hour, if he didn’t hear from me to call the police. I walked to the front door and knocked. She answered and looked surprised. 

“Margery! What are you doing here?”  

She was nervous to see me, she obviously didn’t want me here. 

“I am very busy Margery; can you please go” 

I let myself inside and started looking around the house. 

“I just wanted to stop by and congratulate you Miss May, what’s wrong?” 

She eased down a little and let out a smirk. 

“Nothing is wrong Margery; I just think that is wrong timing is all” 

I saw the red on her hands. 

“Did you cut yourself? You have blood on your hands, Lisa” 

She looked at her hands then put them away on her back. 

“Yes, I cut myself cooking this afternoon Margery, why all the fucking questions?” 

She started to get mad, but I was not scared of her, I saw the fear in her eyes. I pulled out my phone. 

“I will call the police if you don’t tell me what’s going on Lisa” 

Then, I heard a baby crying. I stood still, my heart dropped. I looked at her straight in the eyes and her fears turned into a sinister smile. She walked over to one of the rooms as I held my phone in my hand with the hairs on my arm standing up. She walked out of the room carrying a baby, the exact same baby in the picture. I was shaken, I could not move. 

“Who’s is that baby, Lisa?” 

She giggled. 

“It’s my baby boy, I told you I wanted to start a family Margery and I always get what I want” 

The baby cried as if it was in pain, like in colic pain. She hushed the baby and comforted it. 

“Where’s the family Lisa? Where are the parents? WHERE ARE THE CHILDREN???” 

She stepped closer to my space. 

“Let me take you to them”. 

Before I could react, I felt something metal hit the back of my skull and I hit the floor instantly. Lisa’s feet looked blurry as I tried to get up. I felt another bang but in the side of my waist, a fucking shoe. Someone was with Lisa, a male figure, I could not see his face from the shock. I heard commotion.  

“WHY THE FUCK DID YOU LET HER IN?” 

“I didn’t, she let herself in Anthony!”  

“Now we have another body to get rid of on top of the others, my fucking god!!”  

“You’re making the baby cry Anthony, now shut the fuck up and put her with the rest of them”. 

I felt a noose tie around my neck as I was being dragged around the house, I let out a loud scream hoping someone would hear me, I was being pulled by Anthony to the basement of the house as I heard him yell at me to shut the fuck up. My body was being dragged on the floor like a rag doll, Anthony then threw my body into the basement slamming my back on the stairs, feeling every puncture of the stairs hit my back like a pin ball machine until I hit the cold hard gray cement of the floor. Anthony slammed the door shut and I heard him lock it from the outside. I layed there on the floor in pain trying to master the strength to get up, my body must have been all bruised up. As I got up, I looked around the dark room, just an old beat-up washer and dryer and a sink on the side with some old rotting clothes on the floor with two dog bowls on the floor next to them. 

A ball came rolling my way from the corner of the room to my feet, I looked at the dark corner and couldn’t see a thing. 

“Who’s there?” 

I moved closer than a small boy came out and ran towards me, I shrieked as he grasped both his arms around me for a hug. It was the family’s son. I do not do well with emotions or hugs, but I put my arms around him forcing some sort of emotion out of me. A little girl stepped out of the darkness; her eyes filled with tears.  

“Where are your mom and dad?,” I asked. 

The little girl took her time to answer. 

“They are dead,” she responded with bleak dryness.  

I did not know how to respond, I stayed quiet, I’m sure they were closer to their parents than I was to mine. My father died before I can say goodbye to him and I blame that on my mother, she hated him so much that she knew he was on his last day of life when he didn’t take his pills that night, my mother suggested he shouldn't. I really wish I knew my father; he was a lot kinder than my bitch of a mother who mistreated me, abused me and made my life a living hell till I grew up and eloped with a 19-year-old boy when I was only 17 just to get out of the house. We divorced three years later, I could not be in a marriage, he wanted children and I hated children, having someone else control me and not wanting me to be my own person. I struggled to be in the position where I am at, that is why I can identify with my mother now, the cold, meanness of how life can treat you, only to end up in a worse situation than yesterday and now here I am, held prisoner with two parentless children. I would not make a good role model or parent. I felt nothing but a clutch around my waist.  

“I’m...sorry”, I struggled to even show empathy.  

“Who are you?”, the boy asked. 

“I’m Margery, I sell houses and now I am stuck in one.” 

“Are you going to help us get out of here?,” he cried. 

I let go. 

“I’ll try, have you all eaten anything?,” I asked. 

“Whenever they give us food, they serve it in a dog bowl, they give us bread sometimes and we can make toast with the toaster,” the girl replied.  

I reached to see if I had my cellphone, but they took it away, of course.   
 

I walked up to the door and banged on it. 

“Let us out!! You have no idea how much trouble you are in,” I yelled out. 

“They're going to ignore you,” the little girl said. 

She was right, it was hopeless, who knows what they were doing out there. I knew she was trouble when I first met her, she had an objective, and she went through with it in the evilest way.  

It was dark already, judging by stomach grumbling, I always get hungry by 7 if I have an empty stomach. I banged on the door again, weakened by my bruises and hunger. 

“I’m hungry, I want something to eat”, I yelled out. 

A shadow ran towards the door and banged on it hard. 

“Shut the fuck up you bitch, I’ll feed you when I feel like it”, Anthony yelled back.  

I banged on the door some more, I ignored him and kept yelling at him. 

“Get me something to eat, you fucking monsters!”  

I banged harder and harder until finally Anthony came running towards the door, I heard the key jingle as he was trying to unlock it. He opened the door, and I stepped back as he pointed a gun to my face. 

“I can shoot you right now,” he said walking towards me as I stepped back with each step he took. 

“Do it,” I exclaimed to him.  

“Dont” 

I heard a voice come in. Lisa May. 

She walked her way into the basement standing right behind Anthony. 

“She deserves so much worse than death,” saying to Anthony.  

“What are you all going to do? Just keep us locked here?” 

“Yes, until we finish burying the hole to your grave along with the rest of this family that tried to take away my home,” said Lisa, her tone full of hate.  

“Now you will do as your told inside my house and shut your mouth, if you bang again on that door, I’ll chop off your fingers with a cigar cutter. Anthony, feed them their food.” 

Anthony opened a large can of beef stew and dumped it in the dog bowls. I don’t know how I’m going to get out of this but I have to think of something before all of us become a pile of dead bodies.
