My name is Wyatt, and I was walking back to my cabin in the woods after stopping at a gas station on the edge of town. I had been away for a few days, and I was eager to get back to my peaceful retreat in the woods. You see, I usually went to the woods to escape you. It just felt refreshing to be around the trees.
 
The gas station was located in a small town about an hour's drive from the cabin. I remember feeling a sense of unease as I left the town and made my way down the winding roads that led to my cabin. The trees seemed to close in around me, their branches stretching out over the road like grasping fingers.
 
So this is were it starts. As I entered gas station there was nothing unusual, I think it was like a 7-Eleven or something. I grabbed a mountain dew and some hot Cheetos and paid for it. even know this was a small town, sometimes places would be packed. Honestly this gas station was unusually packed like I'm talking 20 to 30 people in this place. Now this town is I would say maybe 200 to 300 people so seeing that much people was quite shocking. Talk to the clerk about it but she said nothing was going on and she was actually wondering why too. 
 
Kind of shrugged it off, I kind of got this uncensed feeling that I've never really had before. Like something's out there or for Christ's sake they're going to be a murderer.
 
It was getting dark, and I knew that I needed to make it back to the cabin before nightfall. As I walked, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was watching me. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up, and my heart raced in my chest. I'm usually not the one to get paranoid. I've always been kind of mentally strong in that sense I guess, there was something about it that I didn't shake off the whole walk.
 
The road was long and winding, flanked by dense forests on either side. The trees towered above me, casting long shadows across the road. The air was thick and humid, and the sounds of wildlife surrounded me, with birds singing and crickets chirping in the background.
 
As I walked, I heard a strange rustling in the trees above me. I stopped to listen, but I couldn't see anything. I shrugged it off and continued on my way.
 
That's when I heard it - a low growl, like something out of a horror movie. I froze in my tracks, scanning the woods around me for any sign of danger. But again, I couldn't see anything.
 
I send you might be a little bit mad but just give me a second to explain, if you're sitting in the middle of the woods with about half a mile to go from your cabin. And you hear a loud growl not even 50 ft away, would safely assume you probably stop moving lol. Because that's Exactly what I did. I was absolutely horrified. I wasn't even really thinking about a monster more of a bear. So I my ass froze and I kid you not I sat there for a minute or two debating if I should run. 
 
I began walking faster, my heart racing in my chest. I could hear something - or someone - following me, getting closer and closer with each passing moment. I could feel the hair on the back of my neck standing up, and my body was covered in goosebumps.
 
As I rounded a bend in the road, I saw the cabin in the distance. It was a small, rustic structure made of wood and stone, nestled in a clearing. The light from the windows flickered in the darkness, beckoning me closer.
 
Now you know those scenes where it's a horror movie and they finally get to the place and it feels the most tense because they're a couple feet away. (if that makes any sense Lol), that's how I felt. I mean it feel like I was in a dream I couldn't run. Because give or take 5-10 ft away I looked around and seeing glowing eyes with this huge figure. The only reason why I knew it was huge was because it was almost taller than the two trees in the entrance. I knew those Johns were a couple feet above me (I'm 6"2). I believe it or not I still believe there was a bear.
 
But I broke into a run, my feet pounding on the pavement. I could hear the sound of something chasing me, getting closer and closer. I knew that if I didn't make it to the cabin soon, I would be in serious trouble.
 
So like I said I'm about to the cabin from the entrance way to where the two trees were it's about 100 to 250 ft. Now I'm not by any means in athletic man, I hit 23 years old last month. I mean look at me wrong I had good endurance but everything else was a little bit below average. Probably due to my gaming obsession when I was younger. What I'm getting at is I ran out of breath almost 20 seconds after I started sprinting. Like straight up I couldn't even breathe. And the last stitch effort I couldn't hear the thing behind me anymore. 
 
Or take a break and hit behind this massive tree I have give or take 50 ft away. I caught my breath very quietly and finally thought about grabbing my hunters knife. You heard that right, I had a hunter's knife but I was so caught up in the action I didn't realize I had. But I absolutely didn't give a flying f*** because whatever that thing was I'm not getting any closer than I have to.
 
But really sent me out was how I figured out it wasn't a bear. So remember I'm on this like 5 ft wide. Pathway has fences going all the way up from the entrance. not even 30 seconds before I stopped I still heard that thing running but out of nowhere I didn't hear it. So with me being absolutely Frozen and fear I peeked over the corner. God do I regret that. Remember it's still pitch black outside but literally right behind the tree I was on that f****** thing was there. Now I'm not sure if it's seen me or not because it didn't move when I looked at it, but it looked almost like a bone. Seriously couldn't make out what the hell that thing was. 
 
I was thinking it was some type of animal or something but I could give a single animal that has its bones open like that. So my brain started frantically going around all the ideas and thoughts. But remember I'm still behind the tree and I had absolutely nowhere to go. i was So f****** scared it was going to snatch me as soon as I made a noise. Also I was constantly thinking what the hell I was going to do with my knife if it was just made out of bone. Me sitting there like a chicken behind a tree being hunted like a sheep. 
 
So the last stitch effort I grabbed this rock and threw it, going back to how an athletic I am I only threw that John like 5 ft away from where I was. The thing completely snarled and jumped on it almost instantaneously. And that's when I Booked it. 
 
Finally, I burst through the door of the cabin, locking it behind me. I collapsed on the floor, gasping for breath. I could hear something clawing at the door, trying to get in. I knew then that whatever was out there obviously was not any animal or human.
 
I spent the rest of the night cowering in my cabin, listening to the sounds of the creature outside. I knew that I had been lucky to make it to safety, but I also knew that I could never let my guard down in the woods again. The wilderness is beautiful, but it is also home to things beyond our comprehension - things that can hunt and stalk their prey without being seen.
 
And here's where the freak s*** went in. So basically my cabin is actually pretty big yet also small which I know sounds kind of weird but hold on. 
 
So the cabin layout is like this. Before you enter the door that I ran through that other night there's a porch. Now there's nothing special on that except for the insane amount of Windows I have on that wall. Not really insane but there's a really big one on the left side of the door. When you walk into the house you immediately see a couch five or six feet away. Front of that couch is where the TV and coffee table is at. I also have a fireplace there too because why not. Now if you were to stand directly back at the door facing the couch to your immediate right is the kitchen. And the kitchen is pretty big. Probably one third of the house. Why, I couldn't tell you. 
 
So going back to the door and facing the couch to the left of the kitchen there's absolutely no doors it's just a wooden wall. But then if you were to take that right from the door and then take a left all the way into the left corner of the kitchen is where you can actually go upstairs or downstairs. Now the downstairs is creepy as hell. Even me being a grown man I only went down there once. So once you walk into the kitchen and you enter the doorway it's just a basic step of stairways nothing else. 
 
If you walked upstairs there's only two rooms up there. So once you walk up the stairs all the way to your immediate right and down the hallway about 10 ft is my room. And then the bathroom is to the left of my room. Now if you take that right and go to my room. It's pretty big. I recently remodeled the whole cabin because I realized if somebody wants to break into my cabin it would be really easy to just punch a hole through the wood. So I reinforced my doors. I would soon realize that would be an amazing idea. 
 
The bathroom is well a bathroom. Nothing crazy about it except it is basically a death trap if you walked into it, because the floor is about the fall out and there's no windows in case you need to get out. I kind of lied, did you go back to the stairway and then take a left instead of right there's a locked door but that doesn't really matter because I cannot open that damn door. For the downstairs I can't really tell you much besides it is cold dark and f****** creepy.
 
I know this is going to sound kind of ironic but the cabin was actually a murder scene, well sort of. It was more of where a murderer went after he kidnapped somebody. He went to the basement and cut that person up. The reason why I hate it so much is because of the thoughts of what happened down there and especially since the room that it happened in is locked but, you can still hear some distinct humming noise in there because they somehow can't turn the light off. Fyi that is the same light he used to kill that lady with as he used that light to jam her head in and dig her brains out. So if you go back to the end of the stairway where that room is to your left the right is a storage room where I have my stuff. For Junk. 
 
Going back to my room I have to tell you something special. I have an AR-15 in a safe, my family has been a big hunter and gun family. And we've had guns for such a long time I have a whole safe of ammunition and guns that could supply a small militia for multiple months. I have a bunch of other pistols and small hunting rifles. Along with a bow and arrow. You might be asking why is this important to you and I couldn't answer that question, But just wanted to let yk.
 
That's it, thats the whole layout. So remember how I told you that it was outside. I was planning on staying in that cabin for 2 weeks and told no one to come out there unless I called them. I want to tell you I heard that creature, I heard that creature. I mean it when it was daytime I didn't go outside. I had my curtains and blinds shut along with security bars I have on all of my windows because of how easy it would be to break in. I was paranoid to make any noises at all the entire time I was in that cabin. It was basically like living in a cell block. Now the worst time of my day was when I was walking up the stairs because those stairs are creaky as hell.
 
Here's my routine for those days, I would wake up in my bed and I would make sure I had my gun on my back at all times. Ik it sounds insane but ironically my phone was dead and I had no charger. My car is parked multiple feet away from where it was and sadly I had a s*** box car. Also, I didn't even drive that car there. Because it's such a unreliable vehicle. So I would walk downstairs very silent, I would make some food and then I know this is probably going to sound like some b******* story but I literally laid in my bed all day. 
 
I guess at that time I had that sense of security since the cabin was actually quite tall for it being a cabin. And it was literally impossible to climb unless you were like 25 ft tall. All I would do was lay in that bed and read books, clean and take apart my guns and put them together also working out and doing a plan. Now if I were to ask myself what I was thinking I was going to do when I ran into food I probably wouldn't have been able to answer that. Because honestly thinking about it what would have happened if I didn't take the initiative. So give or take on the 5th day I was doing my normal routine. I Woke up a bit earlier. I went downstairs and one of the floorboards creeped. I about s*** my pants because for reference the wall right next to the stairs is literally the woods like there is only a 2-in thick wall in between me and the woods. Now the thing didn't grab me through the wall. But as the floorboard creak I instinctively stood back because I was scared it was going to hit there. 
 
It did, going back to the aldi-shaped thing I was talking about I honestly tell couldn't tell you what the hell that thing was. I want to say to skinwalker so I have an explanation but Jesus man. So as I stepped back there was a loud bam and there was about a 4x4-in hole in the wall, and sitting there is a bone arm. I was absolutely Shell shocked because I never thought a bone could look like that.
 
As a matter of fact I'm not even sure if I can explain it to you without a picture. It was like curled and wrapped around like a ball but then it shot over like one of your forearm bones. And then I can see it's like possibly shoulder. Before it left. So now me sitting a step away from the hole. Now basically stuck in between the top and the bottom because the animal stood there and didn't leave. To make matters even worse. He was freezing outside like negatives. The only problem is the stairway is the only place in the house including the hallway upstairs that doesn't have heat. It's such an open and confined area that I've tried everything to heat it up but nothing works. 
 
Now I have the animal that can see through the hole when I'm walking down, now hear me even better than before now that it has a hole in the cabin. It's also freezing in the cabin. And I'm stuck on top of the stairs. You might be asking yourself why didn't I just pull that gun out and blast that b****, that's because I was worried if it didn't work. How am I going to shoot just bone. It doesn't even have a brain is it just going off of instincts and if it does where is the brain.
 
Okay but let's get to the spicy part because I don't want to make this a whole book. 
 
I was eating my last cereal bowl on maybe day seven of staying upstairs. Not at this point it was around 11:00 PM I would say.
But I heard this absolutely distinct and horrifying scream right outside of my window in the bedroom. Remember how I said you cannot climb that because the window drops down 25 ft. Well I guess that was b******* because my ass didn't put the blinds down that night. One of the worst sites I've ever seen in my life was me looking over at the window and seeing this almost bone elk like head staring at me in the night and it didn't move. I legitimately screamed my ass off and ran out of that room as soon as I possibly could but I realized something. My guns are in that room and I heard the glass shatter as soon as I ran out. So I booked it downstairs, and swung the door open. It was literally in my first sight at the outside in almost 2 weeks. luckily I keep a spare Glock 19 in that s*** box car. As I'm grabbing the gun I hear the things screaming in the cabin as I hear loud bangs inside. I seen the thing moving around in the kitchen and I had enough. I posted up behind the car and started shooting at it. I shot two mags that day. And I didn't stop shooting. As soon as I heard it scream the first time I reloaded my gun and put the second mag in. 
 
And I started shooting again just shooting anywhere. I was under my last Meg because I only had three. So with the one year of Police academy training I had which didn't work out. I tried my best to not make a single noise. To be honest with you I was hoping I would have walked in and seen nothing laying dead on the ground. As I open the door I immediately sung to my right and seen absolutely jack s***. That made me even more scared because I guarantee you I hit that thing. I cleared the whole house out and grabbed my AR-15 and loaded it. Now I know you might think I'm crazy but you probably don't but whatever. I Stayed at that cabin. I think I stayed there more for the fact that I wanted to kill this thing. I mean the thing f***** up my whole damn week. I'm in the entire time I was in that cabin I was horrified of doing anything.
 
Days went by, and I tried to forget the experience, but it was always in the back of my mind. One night, I was sitting on the porch of the cabin, listening to the rain. It was a peaceful night, but suddenly, I felt a sense of unease.
 
I turned to look into the woods, and that's when I saw it. A skinwalker stood in the shadows, its eyes fixed on me. It looked to be about 15 feet tall, towering over me with a menacing presence.
 
We locked eyes for what felt like an eternity, and in that moment, I felt like I was staring into the face of evil. Its eyes were dark, and they seemed to pierce through my soul. The rain fell harder, pounding against the roof of the cabin like a drumbeat. 
 
It didn't move and I didn't move. I mean literally it was 30 to 40 seconds of just me staring at that thing. I finally made the first move and pierced it upstairs and got my Gun. I went downstairs and it was still in the same spot. But there it was menacingly moving up. So all I did was pull the trigger. I shot maybe 5 or 10 times. And at that point I couldn't see the eyes.
 
So I knew then that I needed to get out of there before it was too late. I grabbed my bag and ran to my car, not daring to look back. The creature let out a blood-curdling scream as I drove away, and I knew that I had narrowly escaped a gruesome fate.
 
As I drove away, I thought about the small town I had passed through on my way to the cabin. The people there seemed friendly and welcoming, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something sinister was lurking beneath the surface.
 
A few days later, I heard about a massacre in that same small town. People had been torn apart and left for dead, their bodies ripped to shreds. The authorities had no explanation for what had happened, but I knew the truth.
