Hey, welcome back. I hope you’ve read the [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ysl5g1/im_forced_to_kill_people_against_my_will_our/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) to understand why exactly why I asked for a few vacation days for me and my bud Cupid.

So, as I said last time, I had to report the bad news to the boss since Cupid left. I’ll give you a bit of info on our boss, though.

I can’t really say his name due to legal reasons, but he’s a dick. Just a big ol’ ray of sunshine who threatens to knock my teeth out on a whim. I don’t know if he just likes bullying people, but he seems to have taken a favorite among his employees. Intrusity’s just a copycat who thinks he’s hot shit, even though I don’t see him out here doing the dirty work. 

He’s under the management section. He’s the one to choose targets from the boss’s list, and report to Cupid. He does have some other perks though. Aside from being a suck up, that jackass is a filthy little snitch. Some years ago, he told the big man about an incident.

It was, I think 7 or so years ago. Maybe 8, I dunno. But, me and my buddy Giggles had applied into the job due to some debt. Giggles used to work in my place, handling the targets while I would schedule everything. We ran into some problems with a guy, the assignment was to kill some man who looked at a certain someone a wrong way. We got to the house, and I went out to do my job. I knocked on the door, and after a while, the target appeared. He had a construction uniform on, and he told me he just left work. 

Strangely enough, he invited me inside. I don’t know what is was about him, but he had this sort of… glow to him. He was so happy to have a visitor, I nearly forgot we were gonna kill him.
Nearly. I still had to make up the fake repair thing, telling him I was going around offering some plumbing to the local neighborhoods. He was so grateful, and he just kept smiling at me. He even paid me beforehand, giving me a roll of cash as he wished me well. I should’ve taken the money and ran, but Giggles was still in the car waiting.

We did our parts, dressing up and heading in. I was off in the kitchen, pretending to know a thing about plumbing, when someone put their hand on my shoulder. I nearly jolted out of my skin as I turned around, seeing a woman behind me. “Oh, I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to startle you, but I just wanted to ask if you like something to drink!” The woman held out a tray of cookies and tea, and I nodded. “Thank you, miss. Er- is Jerry your husband?” I hated that he had a wife. Why did he have a wife?!

“Mhm! We recently moved here with our kids, and the plumbing’s been a bit rusty. Thank you!” I looked over, seeing Giggles already munching on cookies at the dining table. The toolbox wasn’t even opened yet. I tensed at the fact that they had kids. Sighing, I wiped my gloves on my pants, taking a cookie. “Our pleasure, ma’am. If you don’t mind, we’ll be heading out. The pipes are all clear.” Before she could get another word out, I excused myself, grabbing Giggles as we walked out of the house. My friend nagged at me the drive home, asking what happened. “Webs, what the hell?! That was our target!” “He had kids! What kind of monster would just kill a father? I’m not doing this job, and neither are you!” 

He was silent after that. I gripped the steering wheel tight, driving off to the workplace to tell my boss off. He must’ve known he had kids! I parked the car, slamming the door behind me as Giggles and I went into the building. I found- actually, the more I think about what happened, the more I start to really hate my boss.

I found the rat sitting at the vending machine, chatting with some customers. Giggles cleared his throat. “Ahem. Excuse me, we need to borrow him for a moment.” The group nodded and walked off, as Intrusity waved at me. “Hey, Webs. How’d it go?”  
Giggles and I looked at eachother, as he talked about how it went, and why we couldn’t kill Jerry. Intrusity remained silent, smiling wider and wider as the story went on. By the end of it, he just laughed. “Oh, that happens all the time! I’ll go ahead and spare you the hassle with the big guy.”

I don’t know if it was just a bad day, or if he just really hated Giggles at the time. He ended up sending me home, while Giggles stayed back to file the mission. That day was the last time I saw my friend. Or—the version of Giggles that I remember.

I came in after a week of no reports, all besides news of a new coworker, Cupid. No word of Giggles has left the office, and I was getting more and more worried by the day. I walked in per Intrusity’s request, and…I nearly died. My boss greeted me and led me into the storage room, the lights all shut off, and I swore I could hear scraping against the floor. “Where’s Giggles? I thought he was supposed to come in too.” “Oh, don’t worry ‘bout him. He’s already here.”

With that, he flicked on the lights. Foul odor filled my nose, as I felt my breakfast slosh in my stomach. The room was drenched in partially dried-blood, piles of bones and corpses littering the floor. I remember now the first time I truly ever felt scared at a noise. Crunching. 

My friend was huddled in the back of the room, holding a severed arm in his hands as he chewed furiously. The man won the arm belonged to lay crooked on the ground, a bullet in his head. I realized with horror that he was one of the targets…Gary. Four other bodies lay around him, three of them children, all of which were horribly mangled with missing limbs and chunks. 

“Oh god. What the hell did you do?” I asked Intrusity, who stood next to me. He smiled, patting me on the back as I couldn’t take my eyes off the deranged…thing infront of me. “You signed up for this job, you serve the consequences. Although, Giggles was the one assigned to do the job.”

I glanced over to my boss, who was checking his phone nonchalantly. How the hell was he so calm about what he’d done?! I ended up not getting an assignment for a while. I switched over to doing the jobs myself with Cupid. We’re not allowed into that storage room, but some part of me thinks that he’s still alive in there, forced to feast on victim’s bodies to this day.

Now, my boss just dissmissed the last assignment, with the creepy, cracked-up skinwalker thing. He said that our jobs should be getting harder by the day.

I just hope I can retire early at this point.
