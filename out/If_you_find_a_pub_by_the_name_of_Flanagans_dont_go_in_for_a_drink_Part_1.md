It was a bar that I had never seen before, and it was the last one that I would ever see.  Green, orange, and white flags littered across the top frame of the doorway gave the hint that this was specifically an Irish pub, though if the flags were too subtle a suggestion at the place’s roots, the name was a dead giveaway: Flanagan’s.  Underneath that black script was a slightly smaller script that read “EST. 1897,” which was odd—for all the years I had traipsed around the New York City booze circuit, I had never seen nor heard of this establishment.  Perhaps this wouldn’t have been so odd if I were a more casual drinker, but the fact of the matter is that, at that time, my tier of alcoholism was somewhere above “fraternity brother with something to prove” and somewhere below “grizzled sea captain with a cantankerous ex-wife demanding alimony.”  Hell, maybe I’m giving myself too much credit—maybe I’m insulting the proud legion of divorcee sea captains around the world.  The point is that I was no stranger to the local hot spots, but this bar was certainly strange to me. 

Less strange but still somewhat off-putting was the fact that there were no windows.  Sure, some bars I’ve frequented were nothing more than concrete slabs whose only light source came from the neon beer signs adorning the interior walls, but this windowless brick building felt different.  It almost dared you to open the door, to sneak a peek at whatever party was going on inside.  You could *feel* the party without hearing it, and that was another unsettling quality of the place: it was deathly quiet.  Most places had at least a general hubbub of conversation going on that could be heard from outside, particularly on this night—New Year’s Eve—but at Flanagan’s?  Nothing.  Wondering if it was closed, I stuck my ear to the door and still didn’t hear a peep.  But it wasn’t just silence, no—it wasn’t so much the absence of sound as it was the forceful subtraction of sound.  Like noise didn’t exist here.  Similar to how a black hole sucks out the surrounding light, Flangan’s was removing the sound within its perimeter.  Even my footsteps felt muffled near the entrance.  I never tried this, but I imagine that if you dropped a coin on the precipice of the door, you could watch it clatter on the ground without actually *hearing* said clatter. 

I distinctly remember the rain.  Well before I had stumbled onto Flanagan’s, I had been stumbling around in a downpour of colossally irritating magnitude, as if God had wanted to ring in the new year with a new flood to rid the city of its eclectic group of sinners, me being a damn-near perfect representative of this esteemed populace.  I’d worked diligently with the help of alcohol that evening to infuriate pretty much every family member and friend I could, leaving me high but certainly not dry as I navigated my way to different watering holes on foot (slipping and drenching myself more times than I care to admit).  The rain had gotten particularly nasty by the time I arrived at Flanagan’s, and the pub seemed like my own dinky little oasis.  While possibly a mirage, this miraculous brick building, inviting and somehow not at the same time, seemed like a sign from God to get inside—sinner or not—and out of the hail that was now pecking at my bare hands and face. 

I’d find out fairly soon that this place was about as far away from God as I could get. 

The wooden door leading into the pub was surprisingly heavy, almost feeling more like solid stone with the strength needed to crack it open; once cracked, however, the door glided across the floor, the place then brimming with warm lights, laughter, clinking glasses, and various conversations stacked all on top of each other.  Suddenly, I felt cozy, the rain a distant memory as I stepped across the threshold and towards the bar. 

Wading through scattered circular high-top tables, I took note of the impending ball drop displayed on hanging television sets both at the bar and in different corners of the room.  A booth tucked away in its own outcrop to the left of the bar seemed to have the most access to the shenanigans of the drunken news anchors, with a television hanging above both sides of the table.  There were more than a few patrons engaging in shenanigans of their own, giggling and spilling their drinks on themselves, their friends, and the oak floor.  A karaoke machine sat at the wall opposite the booth to the left of the entryway, and one balding, rail of a man stood crooning Roy Orbison’s “In Dreams” into the microphone.  Blue and white streamers and cone party hats were in abundance, and as I walked over to the main bar area, a brunette who looked to be in her mid-thirties with a body that had never heard the definition of the word “quit” gently placed one of these hats on my head and slapped my rear, cackling as I blushed, smiled, and trudged on, not minding the attention one bit. 

The place was packed, but there was still one seat available at the bar, and I took it while I had the opportunity, not knowing that the seat had been waiting for me for longer than I could fathom.  It was my seat.  It had always been my seat. 

To my right were two ladies—just as attractive as the one who had given me my party favor, albeit perhaps a decade or so younger—who stole glances at me and giggled amongst themselves before returning to whatever it was they had been talking about.  To my left was a slightly greying and somewhat pudgy man in black:  dark sunglasses, charcoal suit jacket and pants, and black, shiny shoes.  There were two parts of his appearance that did not fall in line with this motif: his pale, almost translucent skin and his bright green tee shirt adorned with a yellow smiley face.  He offered up a smile of his own, flashing his stout, white canines at me as I leaned on the counter and waited to get the attention of the bartender. 

“How goes it, lad?” he said in a brogue befitting the theme of the pub, then gestured to the ashtray in front of him with a still-burning cigarette placed on its periphery.  “Do you mind?  I’ve been smoking on and off for a bit now, but I can snuff the t’ing out if it bothers you.”

“No, thanks,” I said, smiling back.  “You’re good.” 

“Excellent,” he said as he pulled a half-smoked pack out from the interior of his suit and extended it out to me.  “Glad you’re not one of those whiny asthmatics.  Want one?”

“No, thanks,” I repeated.  “I appreciate it, but I don’t smoke.  My dad does—like a chimney—so I’m used to it.  But I don’t smoke, personally.”

“Oh, aye,” he said, still grinning as he put the pack back into his suit pocket.  “Not your vice of choice, eh?  But you walked into a bar on New Year’s Eve, so I can imagine what your vice of choice actually is.”  He snapped his fingers at the bartender, an older woman with frazzled red hair who had been chatting with a group of people sitting at the further end of the bar.  She turned her head and, seeing that she was being summoned, walked over to us, not hiding her annoyance in the least.

“Whaddaya want, John?” she growled, albeit with a playful gleam in her eye.  “Can’t you see I’m busy gettin’ tips?” 

“My friend here would like a drink,” John said, patting me on the back.  “And you, Miss Patty, have the cure for what ails him.”

“And what is that cure, mister…?” she looked at me with one eyebrow raised.

“Elliot,” I said.  Then, somewhat nervous under her unwavering gaze, I added, “Elliot Collins.” 

“Ooo, a professional young man if ever I saw one,” Miss Patty said, chuckling.  “Well, Mr. Elliot Collins, what’s your poison of choice?”

“What kinds of IPAs do you have?”  As soon as the question left my mouth, the man—John—howled with laughter.

“IPAs, that’s rich,” he said, slamming one hand down on the table.  “Unfortunately, we don’t got them here, lad.  This be an Irish pub.  Would you prefer Guinness or its uglier cousin, Kilkenny?  Not that there’s any judgment here, mind—just havin’ a bit of fun at your expense, is all.” 

Not really wanting either due to Guinness and its ilk having the consistency of drinkable cake, I chose Guinness because it seemed to be the safer option in present company and, at the end of the day, it still had alcohol in it. 

“Good choice,” John said, slapping my back again as Miss Patty made her way to the tap.  “There actually would have been a large amount of quiet judgment had you picked Kilkenny.”  He picked up his cigarette from the ashtray and inhaled deeply, letting the smoke flush out of his nostrils.  “Now, watch how she does this—Miss Patty is a pro.”

“Isn’t it just pouring beer from the tap?” I asked.

“Not for a Guinness, no sir.  There’s a trick to a perfect pour.  Watch her.”

I watched as she did what any bartender would normally do, pulling the tap’s lever as the thick, brown liquid oozed its way into the glass cup.  Once the beer was almost an inch away from the top of the glass, however, she stopped, setting the glass down and leaving it to take orders from the other end of the bar. 

“Am I gonna get a full glass or no?” I asked John as I watched the light brown color of the Guinness gradually became consumed by the darker shade sprouting up from the bottom of the glass. 

“Oh, aye,” John said.  “That’s where the trick to the perfect pour comes in.  Good things take time, lad.  Be patient.” 

After roughly a minute or so, Miss Patty came back to the darkened beverage and pulled the tap lever again, squirting out the last inch of beer as she swirled the glass underneath.  She set the completed Guinness down in front of me and I saw why she’d been swirling the glass: a perfectly drawn four-leaf clover was indented into the top layer of white foam. 

“A work of art, innit?” John said, crossing his arms as he leaned over and took a look for himself.  “Miss Patty is the best in the business.”

Miss Patty rolled her eyes—albeit smiling—and returned her attention to the other patrons. 

As I lifted the glass to my mouth and felt the cool foam envelop the shaved skin just beneath my nose, I had to admit that the drink wasn’t half as bad as I’d remembered it.  At that moment, I would have ventured to even call it delicious. 

Now—after everything that happened—I can’t stand the sight, smell, or taste of it.

“Good stuff, yeah?” John said, taking his sunglasses off and placing them on the bar.  He looked at me with the eagerness of a father watching his son’s first baseball game, his pupils—lined by weirdly grey irises—dilated in anticipation.  “Now for the real test.  What color is that Guinness?”

I gulped down the lingering sip and wiped the foam off of my mouth, studying the glass in my hand.  “Dark brown, I think?”

“Try again,” John said with a snort.

“Black?”

“Wrong again.  This separates the Guinness casuals from the connoisseurs in my book.”  He pointed to the liquid settled near the bottom of the glass.  “Hold that up to the light and tell me what color it is.”

I did as I was told, lifting the glass up in the direction of the overhanging LED lights lining the ceiling corners.  It was then that I was able to notice a subtle hue to the drink.

“Red?”

“Ruby red, to be precise,” John said, laughing and slapping my back.  “We’ll make you a true Irishman yet.” 

“What part of Ireland are you from?” I asked as I took another sip of my beer.  John took another drag from his cigarette before responding. 

“Howt’.”

“Come again.”

“How-TH,” he said, emphasizing the last two letters in a faux-American accent.  “It’s a little seaside village, not too far from Dublin.”

“Sounds nice.”

“Oh, itiz, itiz.  I tell ya, I’ve never seen water more perfectly blue than it is around Howt’.”  John’s gaze wandered for a moment, staring off into some unseen place. 

“Any family still there?” I asked, snapping him back to the present.

“What?” he asked, somewhat dazed.

“I said do you have any family still in Ireland?”

“Oh, no,” he said, frowning.  “Not anymore.”

“They all come with you to the states?” I asked, taking another sip of beer. 

“No,” he said, his face puzzled, almost as if he was surprised by his own answer. 

“What, uh, what brought you here, then?” I asked, growing uncomfortable.  Much to my relief, the question brought John back into his prior cheerful mood.

“Business, o’ course,” he said, beaming, his stout canines once more on display as he gestured to the surrounding pub and its bubbly inhabitants. 

“Oh,” I said, straightening up.  “Cool.  So you’re—”

“John Flanagan of Flanagan’s pub?” John bowed.  “At yer service, good sir.” 

“That’s awesome.”

“’Tis,” John agreed as a number sprung up from my increasingly hazy memory.

“Say, what about that sign out front?” I asked, pointing back to the entry with my thumb.  “It said established in 1897, right?  Are you just pulling my leg, or are you a whole lot older than you look?”

“The sign is a bit cheeky, I’ll admit,” John said, smiling.  “People tend to trust institutions that have more years in ’em.  And—in all fairness—it’s not a lie.  My great-great-grandfather did found the place in Dublin in 1897.  I just franchised it, that’s all.” 

“Smart,” I said, laughing.

“And what about you, lad?” John asked, taking another drag from his cigarette. 

“What about me?”

“What do you do for yer chump change?”

“Oh, you mean like a job?”

John snorted.  “No, like a chicken.  Yes, like a job, ye gobshite.” 

“Oh,” I said, pre-emptively embarrassed as I rubbed the back of my neck.  “Well, uh, I’m in-between jobs right now.”

“So you’re a bum?” John asked, laughing.

“No, no—”

“Ain’t no shame in it, lad,” John reassured me.  “Some of the best folks I know are bums.  I mean, some of the worst folks I know are bums, too—but not all of ’em.”

“I mean, I’m going to school,” I said, my face growing red.  “Over at Columbia.”

“Well, butter me butt and call me a biscuit,” John said, feigning amazement and backing his stool away slightly.  “I didn’t realize I was in the presence of an educated man.  I would’ve worn a tie had I known, sir.  I hope a learned man such as yerself can forgive an old codger for his ignorance.”

“It’s nothing like that,” I said, irritated.

“I’m just pullin’ yer leg, Mr. Elliot Collins, that’s all,” he said, squeezing my shoulder.  “No, an education is very important.  Higher learning is a noble pursuit—especially in this day and age.  What are ye studying?”

“Business,” I said, before adding reluctantly, “with a minor in journalism.”

“Journalism sounds to me like the second fiddle in yer eyes.”

“I’m mostly doing it to make my dad happy,” I said, drawing circles on the table with my fingers, not quite sure why I was opening up to someone who, for all intents and purposes, was still a stranger to me.  “He, uh, he wouldn’t pay for college otherwise.”

“Yer paw big into journalism, I take it?”

“You could say that.”  I took another sip of beer.  “You ever read the *New York Gazette*?”

“Not so much up-to-date on my news as I’d like to be, so no.  But I take it he’s a writer for ’em?”

“He’s the owner,” I said with a sigh. 

“Ah, I’m starting to get it now.  So yer paw is a newspaper man through and through, but the same can’t be said fer you, is that right?”

“Uh-huh,” I said, taking an even bigger swig of the Guinness.

“He wants you to take over the business, eh?”

“Unfortunately.  All he does is yap and yap about ‘legacy’ this and ‘legacy’ that.  It’s exhausting.”

“Hm.”  John took in another puff from his cigarette and tapped the pillar of lingering ash into its tray as he exhaled a billowy cloud.  “So, what do you want to do?  If not newspapers?”

Having imbibed several drinks prior to my arrival at Flanagan’s, the added Guinness was making my head sufficiently swimmy and my inhibitions non-existent, so I chuckled to myself and asked John:

“Honestly?”

John chuckled back.  “Just out of me own curiosity, tell me the lie you tell yer family first.”

“Fair enough,” I said, straightening up in my seat and clearing my throat to provide the appropriate gravitas.  “I would love to start up and manage a hedge fund.  I find the stock market to be incredibly interesting—much more interesting than the newspaper business.  That being said, I will get a journalism minor because, once my dad is ready to retire, I’ll have a dual degree that will also allow me to pivot to running the *Gazette* if needed.”

“You lost the Oscar when you said the stock market was interesting,” John said with a laugh before his face grew more serious, his grey eyes gaining a certain intensity as he stared at me.  “Now, give us the truth.”

Comfortable now and happy to oblige even with his sudden change of demeanor, I said without any hesitation:

“I just want to do what every other college student wants to do—get drunk, get high, and get laid.  In my opinion, life should be one big party, and accepting the invitation is entirely up to you.” 

“I see,” John said, drumming the counter with his stubby fingers. 

“I just don’t have any reason to want to pursue something,” I explained.  “The world is on fire.  My dad is of the opinion that knowledge is power, but I’ve seen lots of smart guys get kicked to the wayside.  It’s the dumb and the strong who survive, and they tend to make stupid choices.  Those stupid choices put us in this stupid world—a world we’re so hellbent on destroying that it’ll probably become uninhabitable within the next century or so.”

“Wow, I take it back—you win the Oscar, after all.  You’re a scientist too, I take it?”

“I’m a realist.”

“A realist,” John said with a smug grin as he took another drag of his cigarette.  “I like that.”

“Are you making fun of me?”

“Not at all, lad.  Not at all.  Though I do find it queer to see someone so jaded at such a young age.  I mean, if yer paw owns a whole newspaper, I would imagine that you didn’t want for much growin’ up?”

“Oh, God,” I groaned, rolling my eyes. 

“Touch a nerve there, did I?” He smiled and held up his hands.  “I meant no offense, truly.”

“No, it’s just a touchy subject for me.”

“How so, if you don’t mind me askin’?”

I sighed and stared at the foam—now sans a four-leaf clover—before picking the glass back up and taking another swig of truth serum. 

“It’s just led to some arguments with friends,” I said, setting the glass down. 

“Uh-huh,” John said, tapping the nub of his cigarette out on the ashtray as he reached into his suit jacket for a replacement. 

“It’s part of the reason I’m drinking alone tonight,” I said, crossing my arms.  “Well, I mean, I’m drinking with you, but I was drinking with my friend before.”

“I see,” John said, lighting up his next cancer stick and talking out of the corner of his mouth.  “And what, pray tell, coincided there?”

“He has his opinions on things and I have mine,” I said.  “We got to talking, and then we got to drinking and talking, which is where the problems came up.”

“A lethal combination if ever there was one,” John said with a grave nod.

“Anyway, I told him he was wrong about certain aspects of the economy.”

“Doesn’t sound too un-civil as of yet.”

“Well,” I said, frowning as I recalled elements of the conversation I had been trying to forget, “I may have insulted his intelligence.”

“Oh?”

“Something may have been said along the lines of him having no education about the way that the financial world works.  He’s been having a hard time getting a job, you see, and he was blaming that on certain politicians that I like.”

“Drinking *and* politics,” John said, his grin widening.  “Awfully bold choices on this fine New Year’s Eve, eh?”

“Well, it gets worse,” I said, avoiding eye contact.  “But, in all fairness, he escalated things.”

“What did he say?”

“He said that the only reason I believe in half the shit I say I do is to get laid at protests.”

“Mhmm.  And what did you say?”

I cradled my head in my hands.  “I, uh, well…I was mad.”

“Understandable.  Your morality was called into question.”

“I mean…what I said didn’t help the case for my morality, I don’t think.” 

“*Spit it out, boy*,” John urged, slamming his fist down on the counter and startling me.  When I turned to face him, for a brief moment he appeared monstrous—snarling, agitated, like a hyena ready to pounce.  This look was very quickly replaced with an apologetic smile as he grabbed the back of my hand.  “Sorry,” he said, his voice soft.  “It’s just…you’ll feel better getting it off yer chest, lad.  I know.  I’ve carried me share of guilt.  Don’t let it fester.”

Still a bit unsettled by his sudden change in demeanor, I continued on with the story at his urging:

“Well, uh…I told him that his girlfriend was already keeping me pretty satisfied in the getting laid department, so there was no need for me to branch out.” 

I felt the weight of the silence permeating the space between me and my impromptu priest, awaiting my allotment of hail Marys or my sentencing to eternal damnation.  I was startled once again when John finally did respond by laughing.

“Not a bad comeback, lad,” he said once his laughing fit subsided and he was able to catch his breath.  “And were ya?”

“Was I what?” I asked, somewhat guarded.

“Shaggin’ his lady?”

Confused by this unexpected reaction, I stuttered: “I mean…yeah.  But, it was an accident.”

“What, did ya fall in?” John asked, getting himself into another laughing fit that—mixed with his cigarette smoke—turned into a gleeful hacking of phlegm. 

“I guess accident’s not the right word,” I said, my face growing red.  “But I didn’t mean for it to happen.”

“Didn’t mean for it to happen,” John repeated, twirling his cigarette between his fingers before taking another puff.  “Don’t pussyfoot around what you did, boy.  We can talk all day about intent, but intent doesn’t matter.  At the end of the day, you slept with her, did you not?”

“Y-yes,” I muttered, staring down into my drink. 

“And did you like it?”

“Excuse me?” I asked, looking back up at John. 

“Did.  You.  Like.  It.”  John’s grey eyes bore into mine.

“I mean—”

“I don’t give a rat’s ass what you mean or don’t mean,” John said, holding up his hand.  “Did you like it?  Yes or no?”

“Yes,” I admitted, growing angry.  “Yes, obviously I liked it.  I wouldn’t have done it otherwise.”

John beamed and clapped his hands.  “There you go!  That’s the spirit.  You saw something you liked and you took it.  No shame in that, Mr. Elliot Collins, no shame in that.”

“But he was my friend.”

“I thought you just said he insulted you, did he not?  That’s not something a friend would do, I wouldn’t think.”

“No, but—”

“And if I recall correctly, all you want to do in this ever-burning world is ‘get drunk, get high, and get laid,’ yes?”

“To a certain ext—”

“The only thing that’s *certain* on this godforsaken rock we call home is that life happens and then it’s gone.  Might as well enjoy it while you can, I say.”  He winked and exhaled a cloud of smoke that rose towards the ceiling and dispersed itself among the LED lights.  “No judgement here, lad.  If anything, I think ya helped that uneducated shite.”

“How do you mean?”

“I mean you gave your friend a pretty good lesson of how the world works based on your own theory, didn’t ya?  The world is a cruel, terrible place.  It’s unforgiving, it’s unhelpful, and it’s random.  There’s no grand design, there’s no right and wrong, there’s no cosmic scorecard.  If karma does exist, it’s got a funny way of showin’ it.  What did you say—the ‘dumb and the strong’ are the ones who survive?  I’d go further and say that if you throw meanness into that combination, they thrive.  It’s the mean ones we end up electing, watching in movies, and generally throwing our money at.  If God exists, he sure as hell ain’t listenin’ to the prayers of you and I, I tell you that much.  The bad eggs?  They seem to have God on speed-dial.  So, yeah, I think you saved your friend from some heartache later on by showin’ him just how awful this world really is.  And if I were him, I’d rather learn it from a friend than from a stranger.  Just my two cents.”

Satisfied with his diatribe, John leaned back in his seat and fished inside his suit jacket until he procured the red cigarette pack and extended it out to me.  “You sure you don’t want one?  I do hate to smoke alone.”

Relieved by the man’s newly gifted get-out-of-jail-free logic, I smiled and took the offered cigarette.  “You’ve sold me,” I said as he pulled out his lighter. 

“That’s the spirit, lad.”  He ignited the tiny flame and put it up to my cigarette’s tip, and I inhaled the sickly-sweet nicotine.  Just like that, everything was all right in the universe, and as I savored the taste of smoke on my tongue, John snuffed the lighter out and asked me another question:

“So, yer paw.  He wants you to uphold his legacy in this heartless plane of existence, does he?”

“Unfortunately,” I said, sighing the smoke out.

“And what legacy might that be?  Truth, justice, and the American way?”

I snorted.  “In his view, yes.”

“And in yours?”

“I think his legacy is bullshit,” I said, feeling emboldened by my new friend.  “I think he spoon-feeds his readers the picture of an ideal town, government, America, whatever—even when he’s commenting on horribly negative things, he makes sure his writers frame it in a way that alludes to the possibility of positive change.  And that, in my estimate, makes my old man a liar.  He wants me to continue his garbage newspaper when he dies?  He wants me to do a job I don’t want and lie to everyone reading that stupid rag on top of it all?  Well, I say fuck him and the high horse he rode in on.”  I took another drag from the cigarette. 

“You don’t really care for yer old man, do ya?” John said, watching me as I blew the smoke out.

“Not really, no,” I admitted, coughing after having overestimated my smoking abilities. 

“I can understand why,” John said, his voice like silk.  “He seems to be impedin’ your future.”

“That’s a perfect way to phrase it, yes,” I said before finishing up my Guinness. 

“Uh-huh.  And if he was gone tomorrow, what would ya think?”

“Good riddance,” I said after swallowing the last of my beer.  I let out a small belch.  “He always cared more about that damn paper than he ever did me.  Maybe if he stopped preaching for five seconds and actually acted like a father to me, I wouldn’t have turned out to be such a disappointment to him.”

As I finished my ranting, I suddenly became aware of how quiet the bar had become.  It was that same eerie, all-consuming quiet that I had first noticed when standing at the front door.  I turned to my right to find the two previously giggling ladies silent and staring at me with no expression outside of eyes that seemed—for lack of a better word—hungry.  Uncomfortable with their stares, I directed my own gaze behind the bar, though I found no solace there, either, as Miss Patty was staring at me as well, her eyes just as ravenous.  She was holding a rag and a glass that she seemed to have been in the process of cleaning prior to this pause.  I noticed then that the group she had been cavorting with at the other side of the bar were all just as still and just as interested in me.
