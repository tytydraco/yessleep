“I’m going to kill you” spits the voice at the end of the phone before the line cuts dead. Three months after the affair had been discovered, James has received hundreds of threatening calls, each growing more sinister. 

Anyway, today was not the day to worry about the disgruntled husband of his ex-lover. This weekend James and his wife Jennifer were taking a weekend break in an attempt to repair their marriage.   

Destination programmed into Jennifer’s phone, they set-off on their journey. Things had got better since Jennifer had learned about the affair, but there was still a wall of ice around her. Conversations didn’t flow like they used to, and James couldn’t remember the last time they laughed together. 

They’d been on the road for an hour and other than the odd traffic jam, nothing was out of the ordinary. Until James notice’s something…Ever since they’d left their home in Buckfield, the same white Honda Civic had been tailing them. 

James had an uneasy feeling. 

Always one to trust his gut instinct, he pulls into layby hoping it’s just his imagination. 

The car pulls in behind them. 

It must be **him** – James realises. 

James’s phone rings. He ignores it, but the caller is persistent. 

“James, answer it,” instructs Jennifer. 

James accepts the call. 

“It’s not a threat, it’s a promise – I’m. Going. To. Kill. You.” 

James hangs up the phone. Things are getting out of control now – after this weekend he’s resolved to contact the police. 

“Was that him?” enquires Jennifer? 

James nods his head, eyes fixed on the floor. 

James starts the car, expecting his pursuer to follow. But…he doesn’t. Looking in his rear-view mirror James can see that the white car hasn’t moved. Still parked in the layby, it soon disappears out of view. 

He breathes a sigh of relief. 

Another hour passes and James and Jennifer are drawing closer to their destination. The congestion of the main roads now far behind them. They’re now deep in the country surrounded by the beauty of rolling fields and wildlife. 

The final sat nav instruction is given, instructing James to turn left down a narrow track, the track barely wide enough for the car. 

“I don’t fucking believe it!” 

Blocking the lane is the white car. There’s no way around it, and the lane is too long and narrow to reverse back. 

“What the hell is he doing here?” 

James drives closer. 

“I’m going to have to speak to this bastard.” 

“James, don’t! Let’s just get out of here.” begs Jennifer. 

But, James is in no mood to be reasoned with. The buried rage from the past few months comes racing to the surface, and he’s ready to explode. 

Bringing his car to a stop, James walks towards the other vehicle, the crunch of gravel beneath his feet. 

He reaches the passenger side window and looks inside. 

Nothing. There’s nobody in the front seats. In the back is a golf bag with ‘Buckfield Golf Club’ printed on the side. 

James feels a blunt force to his head. 

Black.

James comes around. His head throbbing, and a sharp sensation cutting into his face. Through his blurred vision he comes to realise he’s lying on the gravel, and only when he tries to move does he realise that his arms and legs have been bound. He’s helpless.

Dazed and confused, he’s still too shocked to think logically…all he can do is react. Where’s Jennifer? 

“Jennifer” he cries out. 

No response. 

“Jenn!” 

Still, there is no reply.

His vision clears, and he’s met with a terrifying site. 

Looking towards his own vehicle, he sees Jennifer on the floor outside the car, propped up against the passenger side door. Her arms and legs too, have been bound. 

She’s not alone. 

Towering over her is a giant of a man, his bulky appearance magnified in comparison to Jennifer’s minute frame. Beside them both a bloodied golf club laying on the ground. 

A million thoughts race through James’s mind, but he is struck by one thing…how calm Jennifer appears. 

“If you touch her, I’ll kill you!” James threatens. Empty words, given the situation he finds himself in. 

Jennifer looks up at James, all the emotion drained from her face. 

“It’s not me he’s going to kill,” she replies. 

“I could **never** forgive you” – for the first time in months, Jennifer showing a hint of passion while addressing her husband. 

James is lost for words. What the hell is going on? He has no idea! 

The mystery assailant turns his attention to James. Calmly picking up the golf club, he makes towards him, his muddy boots stopping inches from James’s face. 

He looks down at the floor – James a pathetic, helpless target. 

“I told her to bring you here. We’ve had this plan for weeks”. 

“I should introduce myself. I’m John.” 

John lifts the club into the air. 

\*\*\* 

11pm, Robert Jones is returning home after a long day attending the cattle on his nearby farm. 

Making his way down the dirt track, his attention is suddenly drawn to a bound woman laying on the ground. He brings his truck to a quick stop, quickly exits the vehicle, rand ushers over to the distressed woman. 

“Someone’s killed my husband,” she tells him.
