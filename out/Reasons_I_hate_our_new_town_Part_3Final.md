In the car, Dad doesn’t ask us about our day at school. He doesn’t say anything at all for the whole trip.

When we pull up, I notice that the neighbours are outside their houses staring at us again. I try to ignore them and I run inside the house. 

Mum isn’t there. I ask Dad where she is. He tells us that Mum has gone. 

Jason asks him what he means by ‘gone’. Dad tells us that she has gone back to \[our old town\]. 

Jason’s face cracks into the biggest smile I’ve seen since we moved. I ask Dad when the rest of us are going home too but he doesn’t say anything. 

Jason’s smile starts to disappear and before I know it, Jason and Dad are shouting at each other again. 

Jason and Dad never shouted at each other before we moved here. 

Dad tells Jason to go to his room and tells me to do the same. 

I tell Dad that it’s not fair that I get sent to my room since I didn’t do any shouting. 

I end up going to my room. 

\*

A few minutes later, Jason comes into my room with a little backpack. 

He tells me that we’re going to live with Mum in our old town and that I need to pack my bag and not tell Dad.

I’ve only ever run away once before because Mum and Dad wouldn’t buy me a pogo stick and I only got to the end of the street before I got hungry and went back. 

They didn’t notice I was gone. 

This time it will be real running away and so I need to be serious. Jason tells me to pack my bag and leave it hidden in my wardrobe until tonight. 

\*

I once watched a pantomime about a man who puts all of his things inside a handkerchief and I don’t know how he did it because I have a whole backpack and can’t fit everything in it. 

Jason comes back to check on me and gets very angry when he sees me trying to stuff all my toys inside. He tells me that I need to bring clothes and a toothbrush and that I should just take one toy. 

I tell him that I can’t pick one else my other toys will feel left out. He tells me that in that case I have to leave them all behind. 

I decide to take Snarfles the elephant because he would probably miss me the most out of all of them. 

Jason sighs and starts finding clothes to go in my backpack. Once he thinks I have enough things, he points out that maybe there’s room for just one more toy. 

I look around my room and burst into tears. Jason’s voice goes quiet and he tells me he understands. I tell him he can’t understand because he doesn’t even have any toys. 

My bedroom door opens and Dad walks in. Jason flings my backpack under the bed quicker than I’ve ever seen anyone move. 

“What are you two doing?” Dad says. 

“She misses Mum,” Jason says quickly. 

“Yes. Of course. Dinner is ready,” Dad says. 

When we go down, we find that dinner is actually burnt toast. When Mum looks after us, she never burns the toast. 

Dad says that if we complain, we get no toast. 

Dad tells us to eat quickly and get back upstairs because he will be having a visitor soon. The moment the words leave his lips, the doorbell rings.

Dad mutters to himself that being early is as rude as being late and goes off to answer the door. It’s a bald man with big buggy eyes. 

“Who is that bald man?” I ask Jason. Jason elbows me because I said it too loudly. Apparently you're not supposed to loudly announce that someone is bald. I'm not sure why. There's nothing wrong with being bald, after all. Dad gives me an angry look from the doorway, but the man just smiles. 

Dad walks into the kitchen and tells us we’re finished with dinner and to go upstairs. 

I point out that I’m still eating my burnt toast. 

The man laughs like I said something funny. 

Jason and I sit on the stairs side by side to hear what they’re saying. Jason tells me that the bald man is Dad’s new boss. 

I can’t really hear what they’re saying because they’re speaking quietly. Something about “binding contract”, “permission” and “regretful”. 

When we hear the man leaving, Jason whispers for me to go back to my room and finish packing and to make sure my backpack is well hidden. 

Jason seems different, like he’s a grown up now. 

I know everyone becomes a grown up one day but I feel a little bit sad. When I tell him this, he jabs me in the ribs, which makes me feel a little better. 

I add a couple of extra things to my bag and decide that tonight, all my stuffed animal toys can sleep in bed with me. I take the ones off the shelves and stack them up in bed around me. 

\*

“Why are there so many toys on your bed?” Jason's voice wakes me up.

I start to explain but he tells me to just get dressed. 

I can hear Dad snoring as we tiptoe down the stairs, out of the house. For a moment, I start to worry that maybe Dad will be really sad when he wakes up and sees we’re gone. 

Jason tells me that we are just going back to our old town to be with Mum and that he’s sure Dad will come back once he’s organised it with his boss. 

Jason is lying. I can tell by his face. 

Once we get out of the house, I realise it must be really late because it’s pitch black outside except a few street lights dotted about. The neighbours are stood outside again, watching us. I can’t see them very well in the dark but somehow this makes it even scarier.

Jason stops still in the street, pulling out his phone to check his map. 

I tap him on the shoulder and he ignores me. I tap harder. All of the neighbours are slowly starting to walk towards us. He drags me off and, as soon as we start moving, the neighbours stop again. 

I can tell that Jason is trying very hard to keep moving but I can also tell he doesn’t know where we are going. 

After a really long walk through the streets, we must have gone in a circle because we end up at the playground that has baby swings and baby slides. There’s a woman pushing a swing, even though it must be way past midnight. Isn't it past her baby's bedtime? I look closer and see there is no baby. The swing is empty and she just keeps looking straight ahead, pushing back and forth. 

I ask Jason where her baby is. He tells me to keep my head down and not look at anyone.

Once we get off the residential streets to the main road, there are no neighbours to stare at us so it feels a bit better. But we walk past these big office blocks and I can see faces in the windows looking down at us. 

It’s then that I hear a man behind us shouting over to us. 

“You’re out late,” he says. 

“Where do you need to go?” says another voice. 

“This town has everything you need,” says another. 

Jason tells me to ignore them. I do, but it’s hard. 

“Do you need help getting home?”

Jason drags me off again as fast as he can. 

\*

When we stop, it’s clear that Jason has found the thing he was looking for. We are outside the train station and it’s then that I realise the voices have stopped. I take a peek behind us and there’s nobody there. 

The train station is empty except for the man at the ticket window. 

The departure board has no trains listed on it. Maybe no trains run at night time here. 

“\[Our old town\] please,” Jason says to the ticket man. 

The man hands us two tickets and suddenly the name of our old town appears on the board. It says the train is leaving in two minutes.

Jason tries to pay but the man ignores him, so we go to the platform without paying. 

We wait for ages but our train doesn’t come. I find another electronic board and it says that only a minute has passed since we bought our tickets. 

I tell Jason that it can’t be right because it feels like hours. 

He doesn’t say anything but I can tell he is confused and a bit frightened. 

“Time is funny, isn’t it?” says a deep voice. I look over and see a man lying on a bench. 

I ask him if he’s homeless. Jason jabs me in the ribs. The man just smiles. 

I ask him if he’s getting on our train. He tells us that he’s waiting for a different train. 

I tell the man that no other trains are coming. He doesn’t reply. 

I tell Jason that our train really should be here by now.

Jason hasn’t spoken in a long time. His hands are clenched tight around our tickets. 

Jason sees me looking at him and does the fake smile that grown ups do when they want to pretend nothing is wrong. 

I’m glad Jason is here with me but I really wish he hadn’t had to become a grown up already. 

\*

When the train finally comes after the longest minute in the world, I wave goodbye to the man and climb on. Even though we are the only people on the train, we go and sit in our allocated seats because it seems right somehow. 

32A and 32B. 

I’m not surprised that there are no other passengers on our train, but I am surprised that such an empty train needs so many staff. Three different ticket inspectors in a row come and ask to look at our tickets. When Jason shows them, they walk off without saying anything. 

There’s a lady with a food trolley who keeps walking up and down our carriage asking if we want anything. I ask Jason to buy me a chocolate bar but he tells me no. 

I ask Jason why Mum would leave without telling us. Why would she go home without us? Why wouldn’t she even say goodbye? All of the questions start buzzing in my brain until I can’t help but cry. 

I feel embarrassed crying in front of the food trolley lady but she doesn’t even seem to notice. In fact, all she does is ask if we want anything, over and over. After a while, I stop saying “no thanks”. Even though it’s not polite, I just ignore her. She doesn’t seem to mind.

Jason doesn’t answer so I pull Snarfles out and hug him tight. 

Jason pats my head and then he pats Snarfles’ head too to make me smile. I don’t feel like smiling but I do it anyway so Jason isn’t sad. 

The train journey is the longest I’ve ever been on. Even if the train took longer than driving did, it shouldn’t take anywhere near this long. 

It’s hard to tell how long it’s actually been, because whenever we look outside, it’s always dark and I think I should have gotten hungry or tired by now but I haven’t. 

Maybe it’s not been that long but it just feels like it because I want it to go quickly. It’s like the maybe-homeless man at the train station said. Time is funny. 

I ask Jason how he got the idea to get the train.

He tells me that the town has everything we need so why would it have a train station if it wasn’t supposed to be used?

I tell him it was a clever idea. He tells me not to speak too soon. 

I ask what he means and he reminds me of how the town had a leisure centre and a bowling alley and all the other fun things we tried to go to, but we couldn’t use any of them when we were supposed to be at school. He says he thinks the town only lets us do what it wants us to do.

I point out that we’ve been able to get on the train and the town could have stopped us doing that if it wanted. 

Jason nods and tells me that I’m cleverer than I used to be. 

I ask if he thinks Mum used the train. He tells me he hopes so. 

I ask again why Mum left us behind. He tells me he doesn’t think she did. 

\*

It feels like days and days or weeks and weeks. It feels like so long that it hurts. Finally, I think I fall asleep. Maybe I’m dreaming or maybe I’m daydreaming. I don’t know. 

When I wake up, it’s still dark like it always is but now I can see faces looking through the window of the train, staring at me. The faces turn around, spinning upside down, getting bigger and smaller, and the eyes go big and buggy and then shrink again. It gives me such a fright that I scream for Jason. He’s asleep next to me but no matter how much I shake him and shout, he doesn’t wake up. 

I guess I fall asleep again, because the next thing I know, I’m waking up again and this time Jason is awake, still clutching onto our tickets, and the faces in the window are gone.

Eventually we've been going for such a long time that I can't sit still anymore and I want it to be over so badly that it actually hurts. My legs hurt and my brain hurts.  I’ve never ever had to wait such a long time before in my life. I start to think I am going to die I am that bored. 

Dad once told me that being in prison sends people mad because they are stuck in a cage with nothing to do. That’s what I feel like. 

I try to talk to the trolley lady and the ticket inspectors (I’ve been counting. We’ve now seen 43 different inspectors) but they don’t talk back. They just say their thing and leave. 

Jason tried to ignore one of  the ticket inspectors instead of showing our tickets and they got really angry and started making this shrieking noise and grabbing at his arms so hard that it left red marks, so now he always shows our tickets to them no matter how many times they ask. 

Eventually, the train starts slowing to a stop and I get up and grab my backpack, but Jason looks around, confused. I shout at him to hurry up or we might miss our stop. He follows me but he looks scared, like he doesn’t believe we are really home. 

I press the button to open the doors but nothing happens. It stops only for a minute and then starts moving again. 

I tell the next inspector that there’s something wrong with the doors and we missed our stop, but he doesn’t answer. He just checks our tickets and walks past. 

And then the most amazing thing happens. The doors that separate our carriage from the next carriage open up and Mum walks in.

I’m so happy that I fling my arms around her. She hugs me back. I tell her all about how we got here. I tell her I missed her. I ask her where she went. She doesn’t answer. She’s just looking at Jason. 

Jason doesn’t look happy to see Mum at all. At first I think he’s angry at her for leaving, but the more I look, the more I realise he seems scared. It doesn’t really make sense. Why would he be scared of Mum? 

We’ve seen a lot of scary things but Mum isn’t one of them. Now Mum is here there is no reason to be scared at all. 

I’m sure Jason will come around. Mum says we will be home soon so I had better go. Dad says that we won't ever have to go back to that awful place and that she is sure Dad will be able to come home to join us [soon.](https://www.reddit.com/r/viciousmock/comments/i5robb/list_of_stories/)
