I was about 12 or 13 when this happened. We lived in a tiny town in Belgium, on a quiet street with houses on one side and a dense planted forest on the other. No streetlights anywhere, just complete darkness beyond the edge of the road. The nearest somewhat densely populated area was about an hour’s walk away. At night, the street was dead silent - no cars, no people, nothing but the occasional rustle of leaves.

One summer night, I fell asleep with the radio playing softly. I remember it was some late-night talk show, the kind that drones on and on. After jolting awake for a couple of times, I turned the volume down low, trying to drown out the noise and actually get some deeper sleep. That’s when I started hearing it.. soft whispering coming from outside. At first, I thought it was just the wind brushing against the trees or maybe some animals rustling around. But the whispering didn’t stop. It sounded like a small group of people talking, quietly, calmly.

The weirdest part? Our yard was surrounded by a tall metal gate and a thick hedge with metal wire woven through it. You couldn’t just walk in without making a racket. I remember thinking, “No way someone’s out there.”

But the whispering kept coming.

I walked over to my parents bedroom, their window had a way better view of our front yard. I had to see what was going on and if someone was out there. To my suprise, I could see a few figures, my heart froze. I woke up my parents in a slight panic, quietly trying to tell them that there were people in our front yard. They were groggy, but once it clicked what was going on, they got up and looked out of the window. They saw them too.

There, in the pitch-black yard, sat several shadowy figures. They were sitting cross-legged in a perfect circle, right there on the grass. No flashlights, no phones, no lights of any kind. Just quiet murmuring.

I remember the air felt heavier, like something was pressing down. My skin was crawling. The night smelled like damp earth. I could hear the slow, steady chirping of crickets mixed with their soft voices. It was surreal.

What really got me was how calm they were.

When my mom flicked on the bedroom light, the room flooded with soft yellow. They all slowly lifted their heads and looked straight at us—no blinking, no twitching, just empty, cold eyes staring into the window. No surprise. No anger. No fear. Just silence.

My heart was pounding so loud I was sure they could hear it.

Then, without a word, they stood up one by one. It was unnerving how deliberate and slow their movements were, like they were moving underwater.

They climbed over the hedge and didn’t walk down the street like you’d expect. Instead, they turned toward the planted forest on the other side of the road, disappearing into the darkness like shadows melting away.

The next morning, my dad inspected the hedge. The metal wire and branches were bent back carefully, not torn or broken violently. Like whoever did it was careful not to leave obvious damage.

I still don’t know how long they’d been there before I woke up. The whole thing felt like some secret ritual, something hidden beneath the quiet normalcy of our village. Everyone knew each other there, and nobody was ever out that late.

Sometimes, I think about those figures sitting there, silent and watching. The way their eyes didn’t react—it still haunts me. Even now, years later, I can’t shake the feeling that they were waiting for something. Or someone.

If you’ve ever experienced anything like this, I’d love to know what you think it was. Because honestly, I’m still trying to figure it out.
