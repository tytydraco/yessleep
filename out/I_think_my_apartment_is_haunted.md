Or maybe, it is me. I’m not sure anymore, and to be honest, I don’t even know what I should do next...

But, first things first.

I’ve moved to this city right around the start of the pandemic, which, as you can imagine, really sucked. Completely alone and isolated, I was glad I got a job that still needed me even during the lockdowns, otherwise I might have lost my mind.

It still wasn’t great, to be honest, but somehow, I managed to survive. Talking with my coworkers helped, as did having a routine.

The worst thing was the weekends when I didn’t have any work, so I started volunteering for anything and everything my manager asked for, which, almost surprisingly, really did lead me to get promoted a few months ago.

I moved out of the shabby apartment and into a far nicer one two weeks ago, and for the first time since I arrived in this city, I felt like my life was going in a direction I could actually be proud of.

Well...

That was until two days ago.

It was just past ten p.m. when I noticed it for the first time.

As I was walking through my apartment, the lights above me started to flicker.

Just for a moment and hardly noticeable, I could hear it more than I could see it, to be honest.

This strange, high-pitched sound was coming from the lightbulb in the bathroom, then repeated again as I moved through the living room and into the kitchen. Every time I crossed a threshold, I could hear it.

At first, I thought I had somehow brought with me a cicada or cricket or something like that. That sound totally reminded me of the noise those things make when they just start rubbing their feet against their wings...

But no... with the light strobing ever so slightly, it just didn’t fit.

I stayed in the kitchen for a few minutes and looked at the light bulb, turning it off and on again a few times, but it didn’t repeat.

Only when I left and crossed the threshold, did the bulbs in the living room start flickering softly, and the noise came back as well.

I was kinda tired then and thought I had better things to do than worry about some strange problem with the lights. It wasn’t like it was constant or really annoying, so I pretty much decided to just ignore it and maybe talk to my landlord if it persisted.

Well, by the next morning, it had stopped.

I only realized it a few hours after waking up and walking around and chalked it up to some kind of problem with the wiring or some construction site down the road and its vibrations...

Only... last night, this strange phenomenon reappeared again. And this time, it was worse.

I walked into the bathroom to brush my teeth, and suddenly, the light above me flickered as the sound of something scraping against the wires filled the air. For a split second, the room went dark, and I could feel goosebumps breaking out all over my skin.

It took me a few breaths to get moving again after the light had stabilized once more, and I think that was the moment I should have just run out of the apartment and gotten a hotel room...

But I didn’t. I still told myself that it was all just some problem with the wiring...

What an idiot I was...

The flickering followed me from the bathroom, to the living room and into my bedroom.

I could feel it now as well. This strange chill crept up my spine every time I stepped beneath a light bulb.

It kinda reminded me of when I was a child, to be honest... this fear wouldn’t let go of me, as my mind started to come up with a myriad of impossible explanations...

I turned off the light and jumped into bed, while above me, the same noise from before seemed to follow me.

This was, by far, the worst night I’ve experienced in a long, long time.

Not even in my dreams was I safe from it.

I was tossing and turning in my bed, waking up what felt like every few minutes with sweat drenching everything from my clothes to the blanket and even the mattress.

The nightmares that haunted me are still strangely clear in my mind.

Shadowy figures were walking, dancing around me, reaching out to touch me every time I turned.

I don’t know when I finally managed to get some sleep, but I think it had to be something like four a.m...

Work today was bad, as you can imagine.

I was hardly able to do anything at all, and I think I dozed off a few times.

Thank God no one important noticed.

All throughout the day, I told myself that it would only be a few more hours before I could head home and take a real nap... Yeah, right...

As if something like that would simply stop.

Well... a few hours ago, I still told myself that. Promised myself that it was just a bad night and that everything would be normal.

And at first, it was. When I came home and stepped through the door to my apartment, I watched the lightbulbs above as I turned them on and... nothing out of the ordinary happened.

There was no flickering, no strange noise... It was just like it should be, and I let out a sigh of relief.

At least, at first. There already was this part of my subconscious that warned me not to get complacent, so I kept my phone and wallet on my person and slowly but carefully started my normal routine after returning from work.

You know... plopping down on the couch with a drink in hand, trying to finally put the day behind me.

I think I dozed off somewhere along the line and woke up a few hours later when the sun had already set because, in my dreams, that noise had started up again.

When I came to, the TV had been turned off and I felt cold sweat sticking my shirt to my back.

Still groggy, I shook my head and then heard the sound from my dreams again.

It was coming from above me, from the lightbulb, and made my whole body tense up in a split second.

The light started flickering, and this time, it was bad enough to plunge the living room into darkness every few moments.

I looked around, shocked and almost frozen in place, and in the strobing light, I saw them.

Figures. Shadows. Just like people, they were walking through my apartment.

I jumped up from the couch and could see them react as soon as the darkness vanished again.

Only for a split second, but I saw them.

All of them had turned toward me and raised their hands in my direction.

I screamed and stumbled around, fell over the small table between the couch and the TV, and as I hit the floor, the light disappeared again.

This time, it stayed off for what felt like a few seconds, but in the darkness, I could hear them.

Their shuffling steps were coming toward me.

The light appeared again, and like an afterimage, I saw their figures crowding around the couch.

I knew it, felt it at that moment.

They were coming for me. They wanted to do something to me.

I cried and screamed as I pushed myself up from the floor, ran, and jumped over the couch, just as the light went off again and plunged the room into darkness.

With a loud thud, I crashed to the ground and heard a dozen pairs of feet turning in my direction.

Something touched me on my shoulder. A hand, I think. With long and cold fingers, it grabbed me and pulled at me.

Pain shot throughout my whole body as I felt its fingernails digging into my skin through the shirt. I thought I would be dying then and there, but the hand disappeared as the light turned on again.

With another scream, I whirled around and could see the dark figure standing right at my side, its hand still outstretched toward me, while the pain in my shoulder was radiating out into my whole body.

I knew I would be dead the next time the light went out.

They were all looking for me, were coming for me...

So I ran for the front door, ripped it open, and suddenly the light vanished behind me.

Footsteps echoed through the darkness of my apartment.

Racing toward the door where I was standing.

With a scream, I jumped out into the hallway and found myself in the light again.

But I couldn’t stop. I left my apartment behind and ran out onto the street where the lamps seemed oddly dim.

Everywhere I turned, I could feel it and hear it...

My shoulder is still aching and when I looked, I saw the handprint on my skin.

It is red and raw and hurts like I got burned.

I managed to get to a hotel for now, but the light here seems unstable as well.

I don’t know... It just doesn’t feel good... I don’t feel safe...

Even though I took every lamp I could find, set them all up around me, and turned them on, I’m still on edge.

There’s this sound again.

It’s getting louder.

I can feel it... them...

It’s just past midnight now, and I don’t know how much longer I can hold out for.

I think it’s coming.

They are here already.

Maybe it wasn’t the apartment that was cursed, but me...

I can hear the scraping sound above...

Please don’t let the light go out.

Or I know that they will get [me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/audiodrama/comments/10hqkpe/haunted_tales_a_horror_anthology_podcast/)
