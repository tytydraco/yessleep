“It seems I might’ve misjudged [Nate,](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/6KrWkbF44t)” [Mara](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/Lr0SEx6JBx) said, tapping her pointer finger on her chin.

[I](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/D38jEXU7Mq) roared an incredulous laugh. “[Ya think?!?](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/LMrQWxaSr8)” 

Mara glared at me with those powerful color changing irises of hers. I snapped my mouth shut, remembering that I was talking to a goddess. The goddess who just saved my life. I cleared my throat, “Sorry.”  

She gave me a nod, approving of my apology. 

“That was you, wasn’t it?” I asked suddenly, “In my head. Right before I could control the vampires just like Nate.”

Mara smiled and grabbed my hand, lightly patting the back of my palm. “You catch on pretty quickly, you’re a very clever young man. You would’ve come to the conclusion on your own, eventually, but when I figured something was wrong, all I did was simply give you a little *push.*”

I scrunch my eyebrows in confusion, not quite unpacking the revelation Mara was giving me. “What do you mean?”

Mara leaned close and whispered in my ear, “This isn’t the first I’ve had to nudge you in the right direction and it isn't the first time we’ve had this conversation either, my dear.”

When I realized what she meant, it felt like my eyes were about to pop out of their sockets. She was referring to right after my near death experience. The conversation we had right before she kissed my forehead and the dream in the hospital, how after, I knew what my ability was. 

“Out of all three of you, Henry, you had the most potential. Your potential to do good in this world. It’s why I chose you, the reason why I intervened in your death.”

It was all slowly starting to come back to me. 

That first time, back in the garden when I was younger. Mara explained everything to me. I was supposed to die in that pool.

In an alternate reality the Epipen never made it into my hands. My mother finds my dead body floating in the pool with my throat all closed up. In an alternate reality, I cease to exist.

That same day, another chosen had died. In search of a new soul, she chose me like how she chose all her chosen ones, someone with potential teetering on the brink of death. Someone to give a second chance at life (ironic since the whole reason I’m in this situation is because she refuses to give her brother another chance). 

She saw something in me that no one else saw, so Mara guided that Epipen into my hands. In the hospital, she hated seeing me struggle, so she paid me a visit in my dreams and helped me out. 

I’m also remembering how she told me that nobody would believe me if I told them of my ability. Which was so great to be remembering right now and not during my informative years. The years where everyone thought I lied about everything and called me a freak. I shook the thought out of my head.

“Things are coming back to me. A lot of things, but…I think there was something else you told me. What was it? It’s something important.”

Mara put a hand on my shoulder and squeezed it gently. “That my child, would be your power. Your *true* powers.”

“I thought that-“

“Nate didn’t tell you everything in that bar. In fact he lied to you,” she explained. “Yes, you have the ability to see one’s age and Emily can set things ablaze with her hands, but Nate was telling you a half truth. He can, as you’ve seen, manipulate vampires physically, but that’s not all he can do. He explained to you that my chosen ones work like what you’d call a “tag-team” correct?”

I nodded my head. “What does that have to do with his ability- rather abilities? I didn’t know he had two.”

“You all have multiple abilities,” Mara informed me, “Referring back to the tag-team example, the three of you each have unique abilities that help you track down and dispose of vampires. Say all three of you were in a room with thirty other people and one of them was a vampire. Nate, with his sense of smell, can detect that undead vampire.” 

Flashbacks of the numerous times Nate would rub or scrunch his nose flashed in my mind. At the time I didn’t think anything of it, but now I know he was hiding his true ability from me.

After giving me some time to let that information sink in, Mara continued,” You, with your sight, can confirm who the vampire is, and Emily’s fire manipulation will exterminate that vampire for good. But, as a safeguard for when you weren’t all together, I gave you another gift, the ability to manipulate what little part of their soul, their life source, was left. Once the physical body was incapable of movement the soul would travel back to its death spot and buy you some time to get away.”

My mind was a whirlwind, information flying around in my head, trying to settle in a way that made sense. Everything I knew about Nate had been a lie, but yet everything seemed so clear now. I knew exactly what to say. “Thank you. Thank you for telling me that.”

“You’re the first I’ve ever told of all this to. The first that I've let remember everything.” Mara confessed while looking at her garden. A solemn expression plain as day on her face. I wonder what she was thinking about looking so sad.

“If I’m the only one you’ve told, then how did Nathan know-“

Mara sighed as she straightened herself up and re-established eye contact with me, “It seems my brother has *involved* himself in the matter. Caused my own chosen one to turn his back on me,” Mara let out a rueful chuckle,” I don’t know why or how he did it, but he must be up to no good. He’s planning something and I want to know what.”

“Something doesn’t feel right about this whole situation. I want to know too.”

“Good. Then you’ll help me?” She asked.

I nodded my head. “Anything for you, my goddess. I owe you my life, twofold.”

A warm smile spread on her lips. “Very well, Henry. It’s about time to send you back now.” Mara then enveloped me in a tight bear hug. She had this air about her, both warm and inviting and yet very intimidating. I hugged back, feeling oddly safe in her embrace. 

She softly whispered something in my ear, sending a tingle down my spine. “You know, little one, you and I are very alike. We both have had a very lonely and painful existence. I suppose in a way, that makes you my favorite.” 

Before I could think of anything to say, Mara kissed my forehead. A warm and sleepy feeling enveloped me. Dark corners in my vision grew bigger and bigger. Before I knew it my eyes were closed. The last thing I heard before sleep overtook me was, “It’s about time I pay my brother a visit.”


***

My eyelids burst open. The dingy waterlogged roof of the motel greeted my vision. I was back, a part of me already missing the garden.

After sitting up on the stiff mattress, I rolled my shoulder and felt no pain or restriction in the movement. I carefully examined the skin under my tattered clothes. Everything seemed fine and well enough. *I guess it does help to be favored by a goddess*. 

A creak came from outside the door. I sprang up from the bed and scanned my surroundings. Everything was how Nate left it, except for the door that was now closed. That meant someone had been here. Another noise came from outside. I began looking around for a weapon. The closest thing I could find was the tv remote. It wasn’t much, but it could buy me a few seconds and that’s all I need.

Slowly, I creeped closer to the door. I tightened my grip around the remote nervously. There was no telling who was on the other side of the door and what kind of threat they possessed. 

The doorknob clicked quietly as I turned it. I counted down from three before yanking the door open and chucking the remote at whatever moved first.

“Woah! Easy there, Tiger!”

“What are you doing here?” I whisper yelled, calming my rapidly beating heart. It was just Harley.

“Relax,” she tossed the remote she caught with her vampiric reflexes back to me,” I’m not going to hurt you. I’m on guard duty.”

I tossed the remote on one of the beds. “Guard duty?” 

Harley huffed and rolled her eyes, crossing her arms in her chest. “Yes, guard duty! I got caught after helping those humans escape so this is my punishment.”

“The humans are okay, though, right?”

“Yes!” Harley yelled, exasperated. “I’m fine too, by the way thanks for asking!”

It was my turn to roll my eyes. “Why are you on guard duty anyway? Shouldn’t you have, I dunno, extra killed me or something?”

“Can’t. Now grab your stuff and let’s go,” Harley demanded.

“Go? Go where?” I did a double take, “What do you mean you can’t kill me?”

Harley looked behind me to my scattered belongings across the room. She tapped her finger on an imaginary watch that rested on her wrist. I sighed and started gathering my things. I wasn’t going to pry any information out of her if I didn’t do as she asked.

“Orders from the boss,” Harley answered as I slipped a shirt into my backpack. She was standing outside the room. Stranded out there until I gave her an invitation in. “You might want to change into something that doesn’t have holes in it. It’s a bit chilly outside.”

I looked down at the bloody and torn orderly uniform I had on. I picked up a mostly clean pair of jeans off the floor and grabbed the shirt I’d just put in my backpack. A minute later I was dressed and comfortable. I slung my packed backpack over my shoulder and made my way out to Harley. I never did invite her in.

She pulled out a set of keys and clicked a button. A motorcycle parked across the lot chirped in response. 

“Where are you taking me?” I asked, slowly following Harley to her bike.

“I said I’d help you, didn’t I? I’m taking you to the rest of you freaks. That nerd Nate and the new one.”

“N-Nate. He’s working for Wesson, you know that right? He betrayed me, tried to kill me.” I said, fumbling with my hands. 

“Oh I know,” she said, nonchalantly. 

My eyes opened wide in surprise. “You knew? This whole time you knew and you didn’t tell me?!”

Harley stopped, just shy of her bike. “About Nate? Hell no! I just recently found out and believe you me I was just as shocked as you were. All I know is that what happened to you was done to send a message.”

“Who’d want to send a message by killing me?!?”

Harley sighed and rubbed a temple. “Are you-  are you really that dense? My boss! The creator of vampires! Wesson, The God of Death?! Mara’s brother?!”

It clicked in my head. Harley saw the exact moment I realized and rolled her eyes again.

“Who did you think my boss was?” Harley yelled in disbelief.

“A 4,000 year old vampire or something?”

“You’re an idiot.” Harley flipped her long black hair then turned to get on her bike. “Now come on, we’ve got places to be. You need to be careful. Wesson will be there. Whatever he’s been up to lately, it’s happening tonight.”

“Well… maybe when we get there I can sneak up on Wesson. Catch him by surprise or something like that and rescue Emily.”

“You really are an idiot! You can’t sneak up on him,” Harley chuckled,” he’s a *god!*”

I pressed my lips into a thin line, she was right. Then, my blood ran cold after what she said next.

“Besides, he already knows you're coming. He’s the one that sent me to get you. Now hop on, we’re burning moonlight!”

I reluctantly did as asked. It essentially sounded like I was being sent to my doom and I was utterly defenseless to stop it.

Harley started up her hog before revving the engine and peeling out of there. 

“Ugh. Men.” She said as I tightened my grip around her waist, too scared of falling off to let go.


***

A couple of hours later, Harley and I arrived at this secluded log cabin in the woods that was in the middle of nowhere.

“What is this place?” I asked Harley after disembarking off her bike. The cabin itself wasn’t very big, but it wasn’t small either. The cabin was rustic but chic, with this eerie and dark aura surrounding the place. Just being outside the house gave me the heebie-jeebies. It was like what I felt back in the garden with Mara, but tenfold.

Harley explained, “This, in the vampiric community, is called The Kill Shed. It’s Wesson’s favorite place to hang out, not only because of all the death but because the woods surrounding this place reminds him of The Garden of Mara. You either come here because you’re a high ranking member and Wesson needs you to do something, or you’re getting shanked.”

“Oh, well that’s reassuring,” I responded sarcastically. A cold sweat broke out on my skin as we approached the cabin’s door. A place called “The Kill Shed” can’t mean anything good.

Harley put a supportive hand on my shoulder. “Yeah, you’re kinda screwed, Henry.” 

Harley’s hand hovered above the red painted door for a moment before she knocked. “Hey, whatever happens in there, I’ll try to have you back. But you should know that if Wesson gives me a direct order I have to do it. Like, I literally have no control over my body or mind. It’s like that shit Nate does but worse.”

I pressed my lips into a thin line. She really was just trying to be helpful, but she wasn’t easing my anxiety about this at all. “Thanks for letting me know that, I guess. I appreciate that.”

Harley gave a curt nod before knocking a few times. A second later the door opened by itself and an unfamiliar deep voice shouted, “Come in!”

I followed the vampiric biker chick into the cabin. We passed the mudroom and were spit out into the living room. Despite the outsides exterior, it looked pretty modern and well decorated on the inside. There was a fire roaring in the large fireplace where a huge flat screen was mounted above on the wall. There were two large white sectionals and a glass coffee table with gold rims. A black to white ombre rug rested beneath it. The kitchen and living room were split by a large bar. The interior of the cabin was very open.

Standing in the middle of the room was a tall and pale man. His hair was black and trimmed short. His eyes were a magnificent shade of gray. The man wore a plain black suit with a bow tie. He was handsome and seemed young, looking to be in his mid to late twenties, but I almost fell when I noticed the giant infinity sign hovering over his head. That was definitely Wesson. 

“Ah, our guests have arrived.” He said, opening his arms in a welcoming gesture.

Nate, who had previously been sitting on the couch facing away from us, stood when he saw my ugly mug. “You’re alive?!”

My blood started to boil just at the sight of that traitor. I stormed over to him and punched him. Hard. “Yeah, no thanks to you!”

Nate stumbled back and held his nose in pain. I smiled as a drop of blood fell onto the beige sweater vest he was wearing. He was back in his regular nerdy getup. 

Suddenly I felt my body go rigid. I couldn’t move even if I wanted to. “Tut, tut,” Wesson said as suddenly my body was flung harshly on the couch in a sitting position. “There will be no fights on my wedding day.”

“Wedding day?” I asked myself, not completely sure I heard what he said right. A flash of white caught my eye. I turned to see Emily sitting on the couch wearing a white strapless wedding dress.

What the hell did I just stumble into?

Nate steadied himself and joined us back on the couch. “Yeah, I couldn’t believe it either.”

I looked at Harley standing just outside the living room keeping guard. She blatantly wore a disgusted expression. A similar look to hers was on my face.

“I know what you puny mortals must be thinking, and quite frankly, I could care less! If my sister won’t let me back into her garden, I’ll do her one better. I’ll marry her instead!”

My brain stopped functioning for a second. He wanted to marry his *sister*?! The one who essentially hated him? Then it hit me.

Both Emily and Mara have similar characteristics. Their long blonde hair, fair complexion, they even have the same slim but athletic body type. Even I had to admit, if they stood together they could look like sisters.

Emily started gagging. Understandably. “I don’t want to marry you!” She yelled, tears flying down her face. 

Wesson balled his hand into a fist and Emily stopped crying, reduced to whimpering in fear. “It’s either this or death, my dear.”

“Kill me then!” Emily yelled, jerking forward on the couch. Clearly she was being kept there by Wesson’s hand. We both were. The only one not affected was Nate. 

Wesson actually took a second to consider Emily’s wishes, before shrugging his shoulders. “Actually, you don’t have a choice in the matter, darling.”

Emily seemed to go back into the fugue state she was in back in the mental hospital, but this time without the use of drugs. I didn’t blame her. Hiding in the recesses of her mind seemed like the safest thing to do at the moment.

This was all just so fucked up. He was doing all this for what? Some kind of psychological mind fuck power move over his sister? 

A sudden whoosh of wind filled the cabin and a sly smile crept onto Wesson’s pervy lips. “Stop this madness at once!” 

Mara appeared behind us on the couch, closer to the bar. She stormed her way over to Wesson. There was an infinity sign over her head too. I guess my abilities didn’t work in the garden, since it hadn’t been there before. Instead of the toga-like gown she’d been in before, Mara was wearing a frilly white jumper.

“What are you doing? Release my chosen ones, at once.” She demanded.

Wesson scoffed. “Sister, I have no intentions to do so. Emily will be my bride and you’re powerless to stop it!”

“If you ever want to step foot in my garden again, you’ll cease this foolishness now!” She yelled.

A flash of hope flooded in Wessons eyes. With a single snap of his fingers, Emily was back into plain clothes- just a white t-shirt and leggings and we were released from the couch. Jumping at the opportunity, Emily and I both got to our feet and huddled near Mara. Nate stood by Wesson’s side. 

Wesson now wore a Nirvana band tee and black jeans. “Really? I can go back to the garden now?”

Mara scoffed in disbelief. “*No!*” she pointed between Wesson and Emily,” What just happened was a step in the right direction, but don’t begin to *think* I’ve forgotten your treachery!” Her eyes burned holes into Nate’s soul. “Turning my own chosen one against me, it’s despicable!”

A scowl formed on Wesson’s face. He looked pissed.

Mara turned to Nate, dismissing her brother entirely. “I’m disappointed in you, Nathaniel. Truly,” said, hurt clear in her tone.

“I thought we were friends,” I added, trying to hold back my bitterness and anger. “I *trusted* you.”

Emily couldn’t even look at him. She just shook her head.

“You don’t understand!” Nate shouted, his voice cracking with pain. A tear slipped down his cheek. “It’s my fault they’re dead! My family is dead because of me!” 

Emily covered her gaping mouth in shock, I, on the other hand, was confused. I thought they died in a car accident. Mara just gave him a pitiful look. 

“They weren’t even supposed to be on the road that night,” he explained, nudging his glasses to wipe away a tear. “I was at a party and people started doing drugs and drinking. I didn’t feel comfortable at all and the friends that took me were in no condition to drive. So I called my parents to come pick me up. My little sister had been restless that night so she tagged along. If I hadn’t begged them to pick me up from that party, If I’d just stayed there… if that man had just pulled over to get some sleep, then maybe they’d still be alive.”

“Oh Nate, that’s not your fault,” Emily said, softly, sympathizing with him. He shook his head, refusing to believe it.

 I had to admit, his story did tug at my heartstrings a bit.

“I was confused after the accident about all the things I could smell. Then I came across a vampire one day and realized what I was meant to do. So I devoted myself to the extermination of vampires after to focus on something, anything. Do some good. Then, one day, Wesson came to me and explained all my powers and everything. He promised that if I did this one thing for him, he’d bring them back. He’d bring my family back and we’d be together again. We’d be happy.” 

“Oh little one, it seems my brother has misguided you,” Mara said with a genuine pout. She walked over to him and cupped her hand on his cheek, brushing another tear away. She then glared at her brother menacingly. “He can’t bring souls back from the dead, only reap them.” 

Nate’s face paled. “B-but he said… he said he could bring them back. You said you’d bring my family back!” His shock turned to rage as he charged towards Wesson, The God of Death himself. 

“Thank you for everything you’ve done, Nate, but unfortunately it seems that your services are no longer needed.” Wesson said coldly, flicking his wrist in Nate’s direction.

Just as he got within a foot of Wesson, Nate’s body suddenly collapsed to the floor. His skin went pale and cold, his limbs stiff. 

“Nate?” Emily cried, running to his corpse, vigorously trying to shake him awake, “Are you all right?”

Wesson chuckled and covered the side of his face while pointing at Emily, “Not the brightest crayon in the box, is she?! What slim pickings you had, dear sister!” 

Coming to terms with his death, Emily closed his eyes and hugged his body.

“That’s it? You just use him to do your bidding then kill him when he’s irrelevant?!?” I shouted in anger. I was still hurt by Nate’s betrayal, but he had his reasons. The guy just wanted his family back and I could sympathize.

“I’ve had enough of you, human.” Wesson spat before waving his hand.

Suddenly, everything went dark. Quiet. It wasn’t cold. I felt… nothing. I felt myself fading into the darkness that surrounded me. This giant black void of nothingness.

A far away snap echoed in my ear.. Suddenly I was back in the cabin. I blinked a few times, trying to comprehend the experience I’d just had. I nearly got my bearings back when I once again returned to the void.

Another snap and I was brought back. I felt light headed and nauseous. The overwhelming urge to puke engulfed my stomach.

“Wesson! You can’t just erase people out of existence because they annoy you!” Mara chastised her brother. She gave me a small smile when she noticed I was back from oblivion.

“Oh hush, Mara!” Wesson shouted. “You’re just saying that because he’s your favorite little human. He always has been. If it had been anyone else, you wouldn’t care. You’d just make another. I outta kill him just to piss you off! He’s just so, murderable!”

“You’re unbearable, brother!” Mara groaned. “You’re acting worse than when you spread that little plague of yours around.” 

They really do bicker like siblings. 

“This is a new low, even for you, brother.” Mara spat, mourning the death of one of her chosen ones. Nate had been the strongest and more skilled between the three of us. 

“You know what’s low, Mara?” Wesson seethed “Giving me false hope!” 

Mara rolled her eyes and stomped closer to her brother. “Oh, get over yourself! These are the consequences of your actions, deal with them!” She boomed.

Wesson huffed. “Fuck it, I’ll do you one better, sister!” He looked at an imaginary watch on his wrist, “Eh. The moon cycles about right.” 

Wesson aimed his pointer finger at Nate’s corpse, “I broke him once, I’ll do it again.” 

Suddenly a loud crunching sound came from the body and it jerked. Emily flinched away from the body. Another jerk  and Nate’s eyes flung open. He started wailing out in pain. I mean it was a blood curdling scream. 

“Harley, leave them to it.” The god of death ordered. Doing as he said, Harley left the cabin and the sound of her motorcycle engine turning on and rumbling away filled the room.

“Wesson…” Mara said testingly.

“Let your chosen ones kill *that*,” Wesson said, disappearing.

“Wesson!” Mara shouted angrily, storming off after her brother. She took a step and then mid-step of another, seemingly vanished into thin air.

“What’s happening to him?” Emily screamed as more of Nate’s shouts filled the room. His once previously limp and very dead body was convulsing something fierce. It looked like a scene out of a horror movie.

“I don’t know,” I answered truthfully. Something looked to be squirming underneath his skin.I took a closer look at his body. “Is that- is he?”

Wet sounds of skin shredding and tearing open made me want to vomit. Nate’s screams turned to snarls and growls. Hair started growing out of his skin and his body contorted into unnatural shapes.


Emily took another cautious step back as the hulking furry mass stood up. An ear shattering howl pierced the air. “No way. He’s a werewolf now?!?”

A disbelieving chuckle escaped me. “Oh you’ve  gotta be fucking kidding me.”
