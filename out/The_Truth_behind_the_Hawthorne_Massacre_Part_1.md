Where were you when the news reports came in? January 20th, 2015. The Hawthorne massacre. They reported it as a hostage situation gone wrong. They said the emergency services dealt with it—that they stopped the tragedy before it could escalate. The hostage taker was killed, but in the end, he massacred the entire staff at Hawthorne Industries. Eighty-eight casualties in total.

The fallout was immediate and intense. The public demanded answers, outrage boiling over at how something so horrific could have unfolded in a secure facility. Investigations were launched at every level—state, federal, even a congressional inquiry. Media coverage was relentless, dissecting every possible angle, speculating on government failures and lapses in protocol. But despite all the scrutiny, none of it touched on what really happened in those few hours. The truth was buried, either too strange or too disturbing to make it into the reports.

This attack was considered one of the greatest tragedies in American history. I’m here to tell you that what happened inside that building was more than anyone could have imagined.

The name James Wright cemented itself in the minds of everyone as a psychotic mastermind—a nobody who became somebody. By the time we got the call, his face and name were everywhere: disgruntled employee, self-proclaimed whistleblower, a man with a grudge so deep he was willing to hold eighty-seven others hostage to make his point. Hawthorne Industries, the target of his anger, wasn’t just any company; it was a fortress of cutting-edge tech, a place where you’d expect the utmost in security. A sprawling facility built above ground and rumoured to extend below, housing labs and projects that most of the public would never know existed. That day, it became the centre of a nightmare.

No gunshots had been heard or reported, but Wright had the place locked down tight, securing every entry point and trapping staff in their offices and labs. He claimed to have rigged explosives throughout the building, and his demands were vague, laced with talk of revenge and securing his family’s future. Some speculated it was about a promotion he never got, while others thought it was something deeper, maybe something about his work at Hawthorne. Negotiators tried to reason with him, but after the first hour, he went dark, refusing all contact. And that’s when we got the call.

When we finally rolled out, it was already two hours into the developing situation. We’d seen it plastered all over the news, speculating who’s team to be called in, and even made a few bets. Turns out it was our team’s lucky day. ‘Overlord’ had assigned us to the breacher team, the group tasked with neutralising Wright and securing the hostages. Overlord was set up not too far from the facility—a mobile command unit with satellite feeds, detailed layouts, and endless radio chatter. Orders came down crisp and detached, voices on the line clinical and routine, like it was just another day.

As we pulled up, the building loomed above us, casting a strange shadow in the grey, overcast light. A crowd of media, police, and onlookers had gathered outside the security perimeter, whispering to each other, eyes fixed on the Hawthorne building. You could feel the tension hanging thick in the air, people looking at us with something between relief and dread.

We got our blueprints as we arrived. The building was immense: 50,000 square feet of a tech giant’s facility with state-of-the-art security systems meant to keep people out. The facility’s core levels were laid out in clean lines, with only a few points of entry marked. Given the size and the time needed to set up explosives—let alone get them inside such a secure facility—it seemed impossible. Suggestions were thrown around at the FCB that maybe he’d found a way to use resources already inside the building. The idea made it slightly more plausible, but most of us had assumed Hawthorne Industries dealt with more mundane tech. After that day, I found out they handled far more than operating systems.

The negotiator made the call—we were calling his bluff.

—

We suited up in the back of the truck, gear clinking as each of us prepped in silence, checking weapons, comms, and body armor. Overlord buzzed through our earpieces, her voice steady and detached. “Situation is static—no reported movement. Primary target remains unresponsive. From the limited CCTV footage recovered, the majority of the hostages appear to be in the main office.”

Baker smirked, muttering under his breath, “Calm as ever, Sarah.” 

The others didn’t react, the name barely registering the unprofessionalism.

“Copy that, Overlord,” I replied, pulling on my helmet and adjusting the mic to catch my whispers. My team fell into a steady rhythm, running final checks, securing ammo, and tightening tactical vests. Sam murmured something under his breath as he quietly tested his weapon, pulling back the bolt and letting it snap into place with a soft clink. Jones followed, testing his own weapon. He’d be first through the door, closest to whatever we found on the other side. The rest of us would move as one, eyes sharp, ready for any surprises.

“Rules of engagement Overlord?” Francis asked, a tinge of caution in his voice.

“Hostage preservation is priority. ROE is to detain and disarm unless otherwise engaged,” Overlord replied, her voice clinical, almost automatic. “Primary objective is to get eyes inside and locate hostages. We’ve got no intel past the entry.”

I turned to the team, each giving a nod, our faces obscured behind balaclavas, only the glint of eyes showing through the dim light of the truck.

I began the march toward the building with the other four members of my squad. The crowd had grown thicker around the perimeter, a mix of media, police, and curious onlookers who’d come to watch the drama unfold. They huddled just beyond the barricades, murmuring in low voices, eyes trained on the Hawthorne building like it might suddenly reveal its secrets. A handful of reporters leaned over their equipment, cameras trained on us, and I caught a few flashes as we moved into position. Despite the distance, their presence felt like a weight pressing in, every face filled with a strange mix of hope and dread. But once we stepped across the lawn, their world and ours split. Out here, they were spectators. In there, it was just us and whatever waited inside.

We crossed the manicured lawn to the side entrance of the Hawthorne building, a service exit. Overlord had provided us with a key—a lucky break, thanks to one poor bastard who’d called in sick that day. After a polite but firm government request, we had his level 1 access keycard in hand.

We moved as a unit, tight and practiced, every hand gesture and footstep rehearsed a hundred times over. “Jones, you’re point,” I confirmed, glancing down the line. “Baker, breacher. Sam, cover left, Francis, take right. We’re doing this quiet-like; I don’t want any dead hostages.”

The building’s shadow engulfed us, its towering presence pressing down as if the ground itself wanted us to turn back. Something felt off, even before we’d set foot inside. Francis’s eyes darted to the windows above, calculating, never missing a detail. His nerves were always on edge, but it made him sharp, like he was built for spotting threats. Overlord’s voice cut through the silence in my comms, her calm, clear tone with a hint of stress beneath it. “Sniper teams report no movement at the windows,” she relayed. “Target is most likely in the main office space. That level 1 keycard should get you into that section.”

“No cams inside?” Baker asked as we stacked up against the wall by the door.

“Negative. All camera feeds were cut the moment the target made his first call.”

“Roger, Overlord. We’ll keep you posted.” I stood over Baker as he knelt by the card reader.

A reassuring hand rested on my shoulder—Francis, lined up behind me, with Sam balancing out the right side behind Jones. “Bit strange, having no eyes in there,” Jones murmured on our private channel, a slight shiver visible as he shifted.

“We’ve had worse,” I nodded, trying to ease his nerves.

“You guys ready?” Baker asked, looking back at the team.

Sam mumbled something, I couldn’t remember what before everyone nodded.

“Boss?”

I paused, taking a steadying breath.

“Do it.”

Baker unlocked the door with a satisfying beep and a flash of green light, followed by the deadbolt sliding clear. He pushed the door open, allowing Jones to step in first, and we all filed in right behind him. Within seconds, we were inside, the security door sealing quickly behind us. The service hall stretched long and unwelcoming, lit by bare, cold lights that cast harsh shadows on the stone-grey walls. The brightness and life of the outside world vanished as the door closed, sealing us in, like stepping into a tomb of grey rock. The only sign of life was a blinking red light at the far end, likely indicating the building’s lockdown status.

“We’re clear. Stack up,” I commanded.

We moved down the corridor, the monotonous lighting, dull rock, and pulsing red ahead playing tricks on my sense of distance. I could have sworn the hallway was only about fifty feet long, but the pulsing made it seem like it stretched farther with each step. I radioed back to command. “Point of entry breached. Proceeding down the service tunnel toward the foyer.”

A ring of static crackled through the line. “Roger, Alpha. We’re picking up some interference.” Another pause, filled with static. “Please confirm all recording equipment is secured before entrance.”

We reached the next door, stacking up against the sides. I gestured to our body cams, and each team member checked theirs. Everything was intact and fully charged. “Overlord, confirming all cams secured and operational. Possible radio interference from the building’s structure.”

“Nothing in the brief mentioned jamming equipment in the building. You may go dark further inside.”

“Roger, Overlord. We’ll ensure we capture footage.”

“Good to—”

A sudden high-pitched static wail sliced through the comms, followed by silence. I pressed my hand against the side of my helmet, wincing at the sharp noise.

“Urgh, damn. Looks like comms might be limited inside. Stay within visual range,” I ordered.

“Can’t miss you, sir.” I could sense Bakers grin through the balaclava, He’d joke his way through hell if it helped cut the silence.

I stared at him. He and the team nodded, tense but ready, each member preparing to breach.

“Go.”

Entering the foyer of the building was a surreal experience. Pleasant music played over the speakers—a naturalistic soundtrack that clashed strangely with the pristine white tiles and grand, utilitarian architecture. A large semi-circular reception desk with a sleek black top, embossed with the company’s name, stood guard at the base of a grand staircase behind it. Jones pushed forward, taking point as he moved toward the reception desk. He moved with purpose, his steps steady and measured, the kind of confidence that came from being first through the door. As he approached, hidden speakers crackled to life. “Welcome to Hawthorne Industries,” an eerie, siren-like voice announced.

I scanned the room, taking in every detail. It was unsettling—a space designed to feel welcoming, now devoid of life. The foyer stretched wide and empty, echoes of our footsteps bouncing off the pristine tiles. Potted plants in perfect symmetry lined the walls, their leaves glossy but still, like plastic replicas. The air felt sterile, with a faint hint of cleaning chemicals lingering, as though someone had meticulously wiped down every surface before abandoning the place. Above, fluorescent lights buzzed faintly, casting a stark, clinical glow that seemed to flatten every color, muting the space to a palette of whites and greys. The whole room felt staged, a space meant for welcoming but now stripped of purpose, every detail too perfect, too still. With the main shutters down over the main entrance, only a sliver of natural light seeped through. The whole scene felt artificial. Baker paused, looking around. “You getting a weird feeling?”

“Definitely,” Francis replied.

I signalled for Francis and Sam to cover the stairs while I joined Jones at the reception desk. “Anything on the computers? Security feeds?”

“Nada.” He tapped at the keyboard. “Doesn’t seem to be working.”

“Baker, you got the plans?”

We spread out the blueprints on the reception desk and gave them one last look.

“We’ll take the staircase up to the main office. There are three entry points,” I said, pointing them out on the plans. “Since we only have one keycard, we’re going to secure the main entrance. Once we’re in, if the hostile is seen, take the shot if clear. If not, Baker and Sam, you take the left door; Francis and Jones, the right. Just in case he tries to run,” I took a breath. “If he wants to keep tabs on the hostages, it would be here.”

The team nodded. I folded up the blueprints and began up the stairs, ears sharp for any sound or sign of life. As we stacked up, Sam kept quiet, watchful, his eyes scanning the shadows like he was listening to something the rest of us couldn’t hear. I tried to contact Overlord again, “Overlord, we’re making our way to the main office. Copy?”

Static.

“Overlord, this is Alpha team. Moving to the main office. Do you copy?”

“Looks like we’re on our own,” Baker chuckled, settling into his breaching position, keycard at the ready.

Jones shook his head. “Weirdest job so far. I’ll tell you that for free.”

“How much for the rest?” Baker asked with a smirk.

“What?”

“How much for the rest? You’re gonna tell—” Baker sighed. “Never mind.”

“Clam it, boys.” I raised a flat hand to signal readiness. With a quick tap on Baker’s helmet, we breached the main office.

Nothing.

Inside the office space, there was nothing. A room meant to house 50 or more staff—cubicles, computers, printers, desks—was completely bare. It looked like a property up for lease, as if it had never been occupied. The too-clean green carpet showed no scuffs, no imprints from tables or chairs. The walls, pristine and pure white, were pocked with sealed windows, shutters drawn tight. Over 7,000 square feet of void-stricken room. Nothing.

“What in the actual fuck?” Baker said, speaking for all of us.

I shook my head, keying my mic. “Overlord, negative on the main office. There’s nothing here.”

Francis stepped forward, his gun lowered slightly. “Is there another office space?”

“Not according to the specs.” Jones joined him, staring down at the spotless carpet. “Fuck, this ain’t right.”

We all stood there, staring at the empty expanse of carpet and bare walls, the silence pressing in around us.

“Overlord, are you sure this is the main office?” I asked again, even though I knew the answer.

Static. 

“This doesn’t make sense,” Jones muttered, his voice barely more than a whisper. “There should be… something. Even if they’d cleared out, you’d expect traces, right? An indent from a desk, a scuff, anything.”

Francis scanned the walls, his eyes darting to each corner like he was hoping to catch a ghost in the act. “Maybe he moved everyone somewhere else? Could be part of the lockdown protocol?”

“What?” Baker scoffed. “Shift everything in the biggest room to where?” He waved his arm at the empty room. “Hell, maybe they’re hiding under the floor.” He mimed lifting the carpet.

“Cut it, Baker,” I said, though I felt the same unease prickling at the back of my neck.

Jones knelt, pressing his hand against the carpet as if he could feel an answer through the fibers. “It’s spotless,” he muttered, looking up at us. “Like nothing’s ever touched it. How’s that possible?”

Sam edged around the room, eyes fixed on the sealed shutters, running his fingers across the window sills.

Francis nodded. “This room was supposed to be in use daily. We’ve all seen office spaces. There should be… something.”

The uneasy silence blanketed us, as if the emptiness of the room sucked the questions from the air. “Alright, keep sharp,” I said, breaking the spell. “We sweep the place, top to bottom. There’s got to be some clue as to where they moved to.”

Baker gave a low chuckle, more a release of tension than anything else. “Maybe we’ll find ’em hiding in the vents,” he muttered, though his usual humor sounded hollow here.

Jones moved toward the far wall, his rifle trained forward. “Don’t know what you’re expecting, boss,” he murmured, almost under his breath.

The team nodded, each one falling back into formation, but the unease lingered. The room’s emptiness felt wrong, like we were trespassing in a space frozen in time, waiting for something—or someone.

It didn’t take us long to search. Even Baker checked the vents, but there was nothing. My anxiety was rising into my throat, my breath catching. I stumbled slightly, like a drunk patron, catching myself on the wall. No one seemed to notice my minor stumble. I blinked away the weariness and made the call. “Alright, rack up. We’ve got to search the rest of the building.”

Everyone made their way back to the main door—except Sam. He stood at the corner of the room, staring at something I couldn’t see. I don’t know if he said something to me, he was waving. The rest of the team lined up at the door, but only I noticed his absence.

“Sam, let’s go.”

“Sir?” Jones piped up.

I turned to look at him. Were his eyes red? He looked like he hadn’t slept in days. “You good, sir?”

“Yeah, I’m just… getting…”

I glanced back. Sam was gone. I blinked, once, twice. He’d been right there, hadn’t he? A flicker of something came to mind—his outline, almost as if I could see his shadow lingering in the air. But when I looked again, the corner was empty.

Before panic could set in, a strange calm washed over me, a sense that everything was fine.

“Yeah, let’s keep moving.”

I don’t know what happened to him. I don’t know why I remember him now. But thinking back on it, it all makes sense in a way I can’t fully explain. It was like that feeling in a dream, when you see something your conscious mind knows is impossible, but your dream self accepts it as fact. The memory lingers at the edges of my mind, familiar and unsettling, like a shadow that doesn’t belong. I’ve seen death; I’ve taken life. I’ve watched friends die in front of me. But to see someone vanish without a trace? There’s something different, something infinitely worse in that. I don’t even know if he’s still alive. I just hope he’s truly gone—nothing more than a memory, and not suffering somewhere beyond my reach.

Baker opened the main office door once again, and we filed out, our tactics forgotten for a moment as we tried to recover from the liminal space. I followed Francis, stepping into the hallway to see Baker by the side railing, staring down. His fist was raised, signaling us to halt. We froze, and he tapped the side of his helmet, motioning for us to listen.

A faint sound drifted up to us—whistling.

I moved forward cautiously, joining the others at the edge. We peered over the railing, and a splash echoed from below. The source of the whistling came into view: a janitor, head down, earbuds in, his mop sloshing through a puddle as he swayed slightly to an off-key rendition of a swing tune.

Baker glanced at me, his expression tense, and raised his rifle, training it on the figure below. I gave him a quick signal to lower it, but he stayed firm, his eyes fixed on the man. With visible reluctance, he perched his rifle on the rail, keeping it ready. Frustrated with his resistance, I gestured for Francis and Jones to follow me down the stairs.

We descended slowly, each step in sync with the rhythm of the janitor’s mop hitting the ground, the wet slaps punctuating the silence. I reached the bottom of the staircase, my rifle aimed squarely at his chest, only ten feet away now. At that moment, he turned.

“Oh, didn’t see you there.” The janitor unplugged an earbud, giving us a casual smile that felt disturbingly out of place. His round and unassuming face smiled, pushing his unkept hair to the side. He wore a faded jumpsuit, the Hawthorne logo stitched over the chest pocket, slightly frayed at the edges. “What’s with the getup?” he asked, eyes flicking over our tactical gear. “Security changing things around again?”

I didn’t know what to say. He looked every bit the innocent worker, but the sight of him here, so calm and casual, made my blood run cold. Jones stepped forward, gun raised, breaking the stillness. “Hands where I can see them!”

The janitors face shifted, his easy smile draining as confusion took over, his eyes wide with sudden fear. Slowly, he raised his hands, the fingers trembling just slightly.

“On your knees, now!” Jones barked.

His movements were hesitant, almost sluggish, as if he couldn’t process what was happening. He lowered himself to the floor, his eyes darting from covered face to covered face, looking for some sign of reason. I stayed rooted in place, watching the scene unfold in disbelief. How could he be here, mopping floors?

Francis moved in, flex cuffs in one hand, pistol in the other. Jones continued, voice laced with frustration. “Where are the rest?”

The janitor blinked, the question clearly not registering. “Who?” he asked, his voice barely a whisper.

“Where are the fucking rest?” Jones snapped.

His head jerked slightly, fear spreading across his face as he finally seemed to grasp the seriousness of the situation. He glanced toward the door behind him, his gaze lingering there as if drawn by an invisible thread.

Jones looked to me, waiting for orders, his eyes a mix of tiredness and uncertainty. I finally shook myself out of my stupor and stepped forward. Baker and Jones kept their rifles trained on the janitor while Francis restrained him, binding wrists as his breath came quick and shallow.

Francis began a methodical search, patting him down with practiced efficiency. His hand brushed against a pocket, pulling out a keycard stamped with the Hawthorne logo, marked Level 2 access. He handed it to me, and I studied for a moment as if it was a nefarious clue. I moved past the group, feeling the team’s eyes on my back as I stepped up to the door.

I scanned the card, the small beep unnaturally loud in the stillness. The lock clicked open, and I pushed the door wide.

Inside was a nightmare.

The room was small, no more than eighty square feet. Grey bricks sealed the sides, and a harsh, unforgiving light baring down with a flashing red light highlighting the horror laid out on the floor.

Bodies. Twelve of them, arranged in parallel lines. They'd been stripped naked, their clothes thrown carelessly in the corner. They were placed with almost clinical precision. At first glance, there were no visible injuries-no cuts, bruises, or marks. It was as if they were merely lying there in sleep. But their faces betrayed the truth.

Each mouth was frozen open in a silent scream.

With a shuddering breath, I leaned closer to peer inside one of the gaping mouths.

Their tongues were gone.

"Urgh!" Francis choked out behind me. "What the fuck?!"

I turned and saw what he'd pulled from his pocket-a tongue, shriveled and dark, resting on the floor. The janitor turned his head to me, his eyes wide with terror, his voice barely a whisper. "I had to clean them up. They said to stop them from talking.”

A gunshot shattered the silence, echoing through the small room. The janitor crumpled to the ground, half of his head missing. I looked down, my own gun raised. Had I fired?

I followed the trajectory and glanced up to see Baker, his rifle still trained on the body. "I had a clear shot... t-target down." He began to laugh.

My fist clenched on my grip. His laugh continued as I made my way up the stairs. “What the hell was that, Baker?”

Baker’s laugh faded, a defensive glint in his eyes. “Did you see what was in his pocket? A fucking **tongue**! He was a threat, boss. I’m not taking any chances.”

I took a step closer, barely able to contain my frustration. “He was cuffed. Helpless. He could have given us answers, and now he’s just another body.”

Before Baker could respond, Francis spoke up, his voice uncertain. “Boss?”

“What is it, Francis?” I snapped, my nerves fraying.

He was looking at the door I just opened. “This… this was the door we came through, right?”

I frowned at the question. “What are you talking about?”

Jones joined him, his expression uneasy. “This door should’ve led back into the hall. But that?” He gestured into the small room. “I don’t know—some kind of cell, or holding room. Whatever this is, it isn’t the hallway.”

A cold shiver crawled up my spine as I glanced back into the room. Grey brick walls, a single harsh light overhead, the faint glow of a red light, but no exit. Just the dozen bodies lying in rows, staring up at nothing.

“It doesn’t make sense,” Francis murmured, his eyes wide. “We’re in the same spot. The door’s the same… but everything else has changed.”

“Look,” Baker interjected, gripping his rifle tighter, “This place is weird, I wouldn’t be surprised they had some sci fi tech or some shit in here. I don’t know.”

I rounded on him, struggling to contain my anger. “And you shooting an innocent man?”

Baker’s eyes narrowed. “Innocent? He was acting like a lunatic, boss. *‘I had to clean them up’*—what the hell does that even mean? I’m not risking us on someone who’s clearly lost it.”

“You need to keep your head,” I said, forcing myself to stay calm. “We all do. No more knee-jerk reactions. Understood?”

A beat of silence passed, the tension heavy in the air. Before anyone could speak again, Overlord’s voice crackled through the comms. “Alpha team, status report. Do you copy?”

I forced myself to steady my voice, pressing a hand to my earpiece. “Overlord, this is Alpha. Copy. We… encountered resistance. One KIA, no sign of the target or hostages yet.”

A pause, then Overlord’s clinical tone. “Understood. Proceed to locate the hostages.”

The comms went silent. “Overlord, there are confirmed DOAs, how copy?”

No response.

I looked back at the team, my voice hard. “Whatever this is, we still have to locate James and the rest of the hostages. No one makes a move without MY call. Understood?”

They all nodded, tension simmering just beneath the surface, each of us caught between unease and determination. As I made my way down, Francis and Jones gave one last look into the small room before closing the door, the realization settling over them: what had once been the way out was now gone. We fell back into formation, a familiar rhythm settling over us, but the calm felt brittle, like a thin layer of ice over dark, uncharted waters.

I nodded toward the security office behind the grand staircase. “We need to make sure the security cameras aren’t working. If they are, we recover any footage for evidence.”

Jones shifted, tension rippling through him as he adjusted his rifle. “Copy.”

Francis’s gaze darted around the room, never settling, always scanning, as if he expected something to burst from the walls at any moment. Baker stayed silent, his rifle pressed tightly against his chest, eyes forward, every muscle coiled and ready. I took a breath, fighting the itch of dread crawling up my spine, and led the way.

According to the schematics, the security office was tucked behind the grand marble staircase—an unassuming metal door marked only by a small, faded placard. With the keycard from the janitor, the lock clicked open. The handle felt cold under my glove as I turned it, and the door creaked open with a sound that set my teeth on edge.

The room beyond was dim, shadows dancing under the pale glow of a single overhead bulb. Banks of monitors lined the far wall, most of them dark, while a few flickered erratically, casting ghostly flashes across the cracked tile floor. One flicker highlighted a figure sitting in the middle of the room.

A security guard sat in the chair, a wide, unnatural grin splitting his face. I raised my rifle, pointing it at him. He didn’t react. My team crowded behind me, rifles following my lead. “Show me your hands!” I barked.

The man remained motionless, that toothy grin frozen in place. “Show me your hands!” I shouted again, the urgency clawing at my voice.

At last, his neck twitched, an audible crackle of bone grinding like an old mortar and pestle. Slowly, the chair swiveled, revealing a pistol cradled loosely in his hands. His grip was clumsy, the gun awkwardly pointed up towards his head. The position of it made my pulse hammer in my ears.

“They said keep them locked up.” A huff escaped his mouth, more like a wheeze than a laugh. “I let them. Not like I could stop them.”

In my periphery, Jones’s tired eyes met mine, heavy with understanding. This man was already gone. “Sir, put down the pistol.” I raised a hand from my foregrip, trying to defuse the tension in the room.

The smile on the man’s face twitched, as if trying to morph into a frown. His skin stretched unnaturally tight, cracks forming at the corners of his mouth as it opened wider. From behind me, Baker’s voice cut through the chaos, sounding distant. “Shoot him!”

“Sir!” I shouted one last time.

A scream ripped from the man and through the small office, shrill and piercing, just before the gunshot echoed around us.

He shot himself.

He lay limp in his chair, another body added to the list. I shook my head, a sigh escaping my lips. “Jones, check for any active feeds,” I ordered, stepping deeper into the room.

“Boss?” Jones’s voice wavered, a rare hesitation in his tone.

“Yeah?” I turned, meeting their eyes—eyes filled with doubt and accusation.

“The fuck was that?” Jones asked.

I felt their stares bore into me, the weight of the moment pressing down like a heavy fog. The air between us felt stifling, thick with unspoken doubt. “We have a job to do. We have hostages to find,” I said, my voice firm, more for myself than for them.

Francis stepped forward, his eyes darting between me and the limp figure in the chair. “We have two KIAs and no hostages. Both of them were crazy. This is beyond us now. Where is our backup?” His voice rose, a crack of desperation breaking through.

I glanced at the dark, flickering monitors, then back at the team. Nothing was working. I shook my head and swore under my breath before tapping my comms. The line was static-filled but alive. “Overlord, Alpha team reporting. Confirming another KIA. No hostages found. Requesting support.”

There was a pause, then Overlord’s voice crackled through the static, cold and detached. “Alpha team, negative on support. The hostages are still in that building. Mission is to locate and secure.”

I swallowed hard, the response twisting in my gut like a knife. Francis shifted, discontent written in every line of his body. Jones clenched his jaw, eyes locking onto mine as if daring me to argue.

“The hostages are still in the building. We keep moving,” I said, voice steady but tight. “We push on and find them.”

Baker, still at the door, exhaled a shaky breath and muttered, “This is fucked.”

I nodded, feeling the cold realization sink into my bones. “Maybe, but we’re not leaving until we complete the mission.”

Jones pushed pass and looked to the monitors, fingers moving to check for any signs of life. The cameras remained lifeless. “Take the backup for evidence,” I commanded, glancing at a small black box. “And see if you can get the lockdown to end.” The stare from the guard in the chair felt like it was drilling into the back of my skull, a silent reminder of how deep we’d gone.

I stepped out of the room, out of view of the others for a moment, and tried to steady myself. My breaths came hard, a knot of sickness lodged in my throat. I turned and saw the team talking quietly, their voices low. Shaking away the weariness, I took stock to anchor myself. Ammo checked, pouches secured, camera functional, comms stable. Helmet tight, armor strapped on. I needed to be present—now, for the men.

Overlord’s voice came through, clipped and professional. “Alpha, report status.”

There was something about the steadiness of her tone that made me pause. Beneath the controlled words, I could almost hear Sarah’s real concern, hidden under layers of protocol. It was strange how that familiarity both reassured and unsettled me.

“Overlord, Alpha team reporting. Recovering CCTV footage, preparing to advance to the next section,” I replied, keeping my tone steady and controlled.

“Roger.”

The rest finally joined me, Jones carrying the black box of footage. I took it and secured it to my vest. “No luck with the lockdown, that guard smashed the controls pretty good.”

I nodded. “Form up. Let’s move.”

Every footstep seemed too loud, echoing off the silent walls as we made our way toward the next section of the building—the workshops and labs. 

None of us spoke, but we all felt it: the point of no return.
