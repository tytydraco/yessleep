There is a video on YouTube simply titled “White Noise, Black Screen.” It is a 10-hour-long video, designed for playing while you’re asleep.

It stands out among the other white noise videos though, because at around the 6-hour mark, there is a huge spike in the “most replayed” section.

In case you don’t know—”most replayed” is a feature on YouTube that shows what part of the video other people played over and over again. For most videos, it makes sense—on a creepy urban explorers video, the “most replayed” might be where the person encounters a ghost or creepy person, etc. Or a funny skit video might be most replayed at the punchline.

But for a video that’s playing white noise and a black screen for 10 hours, why would there be a most replayed section?

But there it was. A 30-second portion of the video at the timestamp 6 hours, 18 minutes.

Out of curiosity, I jumped to that part of the video and played it. But it looked and sounded the same as the rest of the video: black screen, white noise. No blips in the audio or change to the visuals, as far as I could tell.

*Maybe that’s when most people get up.* I mean, that was six hours of sleep, right? Maybe a lot of people woke up about 6 hours into the video and shut it off.

That wouldn’t really be replaying it, though.

And also, 30-seconds in a 10 hour video was too accurate. Some people would wake up six hours in, six hours five minutes in… etc. The “most replayed” feature showed a spike at exactly 6:18:14. A huge, narrow spike—specifically at that time—not a broader hump that would imply a range of wakeup times.

*Maybe someone linked the video at that time by accident, and shared it to a lot of people?*

Comments were turned off, so I couldn’t check if people were saying anything else about it.

Despite the weirdness, that night, I decided to play the video while I slept. That’s how I found the video in the first place—I really did need white noise. My neighbor’s dog kept barking at 6 AM and I needed sleep.

I pressed PLAY on the video and went to bed.

And woke up with a start in the middle of the night.

I didn’t know what woke me up. My phone said it was 3:37 AM. My room was pitch black, except for the dark-gray glow of the “White Noise, Black Screen” video playing. I rolled over, pulled the blanket over me, and tried to fall back asleep.

But my body was pumping with adrenaline. It was like I’d woken up from a nightmare or something, even though I didn’t remember having one. I tried to relax, slowly counting in my head.

That’s when I heard something else.

It’s hard to describe, but I’ll try. Some white noises are computer-generated, so that they truly make a uniform rushing sound the entire time. Others, however, especially in older “sound machines” are actually a clip of white noise repeating over and over again. Listening to it long enough, your brain starts to pick out a pattern of the subtly changing tone, and it gets really annoying.

That’s what this felt like. My brain was suddenly picking out a pattern, a sort of rhythm, to the white noise.

Even though I hadn’t heard it when I fell asleep.

The longer I lay there, tossing and turning, the more my brain picked up on the pattern. A series of whooshes and clicks. It was really annoying—I’m one of those people who can’t sleep in the same room with a ticking clock, and that’s what this felt like. *Whooosh. Wup. Click.*

*Whooosh. Wup. Click.*

My nerves grew ragged.

*Whooosh. Wup. Click.*

Just when I couldn’t stand it anymore—just when I was about to get out of bed and turn it off, because *anything,* even barking dogs at 6 AM, was better than this—I heard it.

A growling sound.

“Who’s there?” I shouted.

Nothing.

I sat up—and my heart dropped.

A pair of white eyes floated in the darkness.

On my computer screen.

I watched, frozen, as the eyes shifted—*off* the computer screen. They hung in the darkness a full foot away, staring me down.

Then it moved.

The eyes blazed white as the *thing* leapt for me, shadowy hands reaching across the bed—a shock of pain as something tightened around my wrist—

I scrambled away, kicking. Grabbed my phone off the nightstand, turned on the flashlight.

Nothing was there.

I ran to the door and turned on the lights. The bedroom was empty. I grabbed the laptop—and saw that I was just past the 6:18 mark in the video. The most replayed part.

I rewound it, replayed it.

Nothing was there.

No growl.

No shadowy figure.

No blazing white eyes.

I ran to the bathroom and splashed water on my face, trying to calm myself, to break myself out of the panic. *It was just a dream. You were half asleep. That’s all it was.*

But when I looked down at my arm—

I saw a purple bruise just above my wrist.
