I know this isn’t gonna sound sane or even true but I need to see if anyone has this same experience.

I was about 14 years old at the time and I had been in a rebellious phase. I had shared a room with my older sister for years and I hated it. We had a room downstairs that was filled with our old toys, so I decided to start sleeping down there. Of course my parents objected to it but I didn’t care, I wanted my own space. 

I had been staying in that room for months now. Before we go on I should mention that this room doesn’t have any windows in it, all it has is a big wooden door in and out of the room. The room had paneled ceiling to it. Now I know this might not seem important but it comes in I promise. 

I remember the night I saw him clearly. I have always been a night owl and in that dark room it was so easy to stay up late. My parents and sisters were all upstairs and I had free rain. I remember being on the 2nd day of my period(important I promise ) and I remember going to bed around 2am I think. That night I slept like a baby till I didn’t. I woke up like normal and realized I had passed out on my phone sometime around 2am. Now it’s also important to mention that the wooden door has a lock on it and being the dumb parinod teen I was I ALWAYS locked it. I know I locked it that night. So when I woke up in that dark room, sighed at my drowsiness and plugged in my phone. I decided that I might as well get a bit more sleep in. I rolled over on to my back at that’s when I saw it. 

It was long and dark and my mind instinctively told me it was male. The face what blue and the thing had nothing on its face but big gapping black holes. It was breathing, I know it wasn’t sleep paralysis because I could move. The door only locked from the inside and there was no key to it. So how the hell did it get in? The first thing I thought of was what it was gonna do to me. But it didn’t do anything it just stared. I don’t know how but I knew it was looking at me. Starring into my soul, judging me. Fear surged through me I could hear my parents awake on the other side of the door, my mom talking to her friends as I stared at this thing. With nothing else to do but hope for it to go away I closed my eyes, and rolled onto my side, I just hoped at this time that it didn’t know I was awake. I hoped it thought I was asleep. I could still feel its stare I remember it, it was cold and hard, like it wanted me dead. I don’t know when my brain turned off and I fell into a restless sleep, but when I woke up it was a hour later then when I had first woke to the creature. And when I woke it was gone, the room was still  dark and I hesitated to turn on the light, scared that if I turned it on it would be there but when I did turn them on, the room was normal. 

Now later that day I had gone to the bathroom to ya know be safe with my period and stuff but there was nothing there, no period nothing. It usually lasts a week not 2 days. Always regular, always.. but not this time so what happened? Was it the blue man or was it just a thing with growing up. The strangest thing was that I didn’t get my period for a solid 3 months after that night. 

I eventually got my own room but for the rest of my time in that room I triple checked everything, locks and I even had my dad check the ceiling tiles, nothing… sometimes it feels like I can still feel its glare I don’t know what it was but I never what to see it again.
