In my mere 12 years, I had yet to witness a paranormal event, though being a religious individual I was peppered with close experiences.

Returning to India, my birthplace, for my dad's business venture was a chance for respite and relaxation, to eat sweet bread dipped in chai every day and not get tired of it, my Uncle M had suggested and booked a hotel for us, and after a flight and a rickshaw, we stood below the small rackety building, white light glowing from within the reception area, instantly my stomach birthed an urchin.

Walking in my dad resumed our reservation, me and my mom sat on a small bench across from the metal desk with a thin man behind it on a stool, a fan buzzing the warm air towards him. Though white paint commands to widen and breathe space into a room, here, along with the cold white lights it only proved to be suffocating.

Two other men joined in lugging our luggages up the carpeted stairs and once attended to our room, we walked in and the urchin nestled in my stomach only grew more spikes, the room was painted white ofcourse, with a queen sized bed on the left, and to it's own left was the bathroom door, and to it's front stood a small wooden desk with outlets lining it's surface, a lanky fan perched on the ceiling looking worse for wear. All varieties of creatures hiked the walls and slumbered on the bed, most coming in through the small window above the bed with a stained yellow glass hatch slightly open. I had looked at my dad in question, to which he simply shrugged and beckoned us to settle in.

Uncomfortably, we all piled into bed, with me in the middle, and switching off the lights, I wondered how my parents had dozed off in such conditions as I lay staring at the ceiling, but soon sleep came and with it nightmares.

I awoke in a sweat, sitting up and looking around frantically, searching for the figure that had graced me with it's appearance in all of my nightmares, such that I had never had before, this consistent figure was one of smoke and no edges, and it towered over me in bed, it's lack of eyes piercing into mine in sheer and utter hatred.

I heard it call my name, no, not heard, felt. My eyes were now transfixed on the door knob leading out to the hallway of the floor, with my parents sound asleep I heeded it's call and crept outside, my mind absent of any practical thought or sense and full of it's pronounciation of the syllables that built up my name.

Out in the hallway, only two lights were aglow, bathing the two ends of the hallway in warmth, dooming the staircase in darkness, so I failed to notice the shadowy figure staggering up the stairs until the light curved around it revealing a silhouette of a naked woman, still very much featureless. My legs gave out from underneath me, an unconcious and dangerous habit my mind had to cope with grief and fear, especially when a stranger cloaked in shadow starts running towards you.

Clutching at the doorframe, I pulled my shivering body up from the cold floor and rushed into our room, and slamming the door shut I clumsily swiped the aldrop lock, clasping the hasp onto the staple just as the creature started hammering on the door, hurriedly I curved the shackle of our padlock into the staple and locked it, before once again crumbling to the floor, my will shattered. I cried, and screamed for my parents to wake up, crawling into the bug infested bed, but they just wouldn't as if my voice reached a veil and fizzled out, and from the shock or adrenaline, I passed out.

Next thing I remember is waking up, hearing chatter and suitcases being zipped open, with the fragrance of chai and sweet bread in the air, and so with an aching head I sat up, observing my parents scouring for morning essentials, as if nothing strange had grown them any suspicious, for a long while I stared at the padlock fixed yet again into the lock, then sighed, lowering my head in a losing bow and joined my parents for breakfast which definitely soothed my nerves.
As we ate, my dad held up a golden piece of jewellery and handed it to me, which I instantly recognized as the ruby encrusted ring I wore daily, he informed me how he had found it abandoned in the hallway close to our door and lectured me to never lose it again whilst all my thoughts only centered on one, which being that I was still wearing the ring when I went to bed, because I never took it off, not even while showering. Breaking down I confessed it all to my parents but they refused to believe it, but now concerned for my well-being, they assured me to move us to another hotel, and so we quickly packed up our belongings and set on foot, deciding to look through the shops as we went.

Since that very night, I have never had a similar experience, or one another I would deem as paranormal, and not even my parents remember the name of the establishment as of now. Considering the bad blood between my parents and my grandparents who live with his son, my Uncle M and his wife and kids, a while before I was even born, I have reason to believe that he sent us to a bad place on purpose, for I never liked him and still don't, and believe he has forever had ill intentions for me and my parents.

Therapy has helped soften the fear I once had for the event, but forgetting it is nearly impossible, even though I wish I could make sense of it in terms of reality rather than a horrid scene from a shitty horror film. My parents still brush it off as a thing of my nightmares, which I don't blame them for, it is quite unbelievable. But I wish to never step one foot into that building in the entirety of my remaining life.

Thankyou for reading.
