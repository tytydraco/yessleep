I was a 21 year old Male from Assam, India, when this happened during the COVID lockdown. I was staying over at a friend’s apartment. We were broke students, so the place was bare — no curtains or anything. The window in the living room faced the street, and at night the streetlight would bleed in just enough light so the room was dim but not pitch dark. Kinda like a full moon night, maybe a little brighter.

The layout’s important, so picture this: when you enter the room, there’s a wall straight ahead with a window in the middle. I had laid down my mattress with my head toward that window, specifically in the corner to the right of it. So when I turned my head to the left, I’d be facing the corner on the other side of the same wall.

That night I had a strange dream.

Me and a few friends were in Mumbai. It was 2 AM and we couldn’t find a hotel, so we decided to just sleep at the airport. We laid down our sheets on the floor, not next to each other but one behind the other in a line. No idea why.

As we’re trying to sleep, this old lady appears with a broom. She starts sweeping the floor and every time she gets to one of us, we shift our sheet slightly to let her sweep under, then lay it back down. I did the same when she came up to me.

Then she looks at me and says, “You need a blanket?” I say, “no thank you.” Again, “You need a blanket?” I repeat, “no I’m good.” Third time, same exact words, same tone. By now I’m like, is this on loop? It didn’t feel like someone asking, it felt like a recording. I said no again but when she asked a fourth time I kinda lost it and snapped, “How many times do I have to say no?”

And then she jumped on me.

She literally latched onto me but upside down. Her arms were wrapped around my waist and her legs were around my neck. Tight. Like, choking tight.

That’s when I woke up. But I couldn’t move. I thought it was sleep paralysis.

Then I realized I could move my legs and other parts of my body.

I tried to look down but it was very difficult to tilt my neck towards my chest, and that’s when I saw her still latched on to me. Which is why it was difficult to look towards my chest.

I tried moving my arms below the elbows to grab her legs around my neck, but she was too strong.

I remembered a scene from Batman: The Dark Knight Rises where Alfred says, “What’s the point of all those pushups if you can’t lift a log?”

Back then, I was a gym freak, working out a lot and on a high-protein diet. I figured my testosterone level was dialed up to 11. So it hurt my ego that this frail old lady was stronger than me. I gave it my all and managed to get her off.

She didn’t just get off — she dematerialized. As her grip released, she vanished out of my hands, and my hands closed in on themselves.

I looked around quick and saw nothing. I looked at the time — almost 4 AM.

Still shaken, I reached for my water bottle on the left. As I turned to grab it, I saw something in the corner to the left of the window — the same corner I’d been facing when I laid down.

It was this “thing” closer to the water bottle, near where I kept it. It had the old lady’s face but the body was wrong, like a toad’s body but with human hands and feet and ragged grey hair. It was the size of a medium to large sized dog.

My blood ran cold. But me getting it off me, despite her overwhelming strength, gave me a small sense of victory. That small victory gave me the confidence to stand my ground.

As soon as it saw I wasn’t running, it ran toward the left corner I was facing while lying on the right corner and disappeared like that corner was a portal.

I turned on the lights. Nothing.

When the sun came up, I called my mom. She told me about a mythical creature in Assamese culture called the bal jukua. “Bal” means strength, “jukua” means the one who tests. So it translates to The one who tests your strength.

It comes to test your strength when you sleep. If you lose, it will keep coming back every now and then. If you win, it’ll leave you alone. But the day you lose your strength, or the day you die, it will come again. So it kinda marks its victims for life. There are rituals that my mom and aunt suggested, but I never got the time for that. For now, since I was able to get her off me, I feel like I have some time.

Since then, I’ve had two more sleep paralysis episodes. Each time I stared at the darkest corner of the room, waiting.

But it never came.

Still, I kinda feel one day I’ll see it again.
