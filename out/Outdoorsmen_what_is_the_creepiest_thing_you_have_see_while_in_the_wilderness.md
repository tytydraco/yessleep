I’m not an outdoorsy guy, but since I moved to Arizona and I became friends with some locals, I began to tag along on some of their camping trips.

These are guys who are pretty experienced in recreational camping, bring some firearms with them, know how to hunt, etc. Among other things of course they like to drink heavily on these trips until they eventually pass out in their tents.

The third time I went camping with them was in Bear Canyon in a particularly remote area.

When we arrived at our camping area we pitched our tents about 20-30 feet from the edge of a creek, got a fire going, ate dinner and started with the usual drinking antics. 

After a couple hours of drinks a few of the guys started heading into their tents for bed time. I decided to stay up with two friends.

We kept drinking and chatting by the fire, listening to the creek and the crackle of the fire.

While talking with one of the friends, I noticed the other guy was turned around, towards the creek. He turned towards us with a confused look.

He said, “Do you guys hear that? It sounds like something keeps dropping into the water.”

We stopped talking to listen for a second, heard nothing, and started laughing at him thinking he just got scared.

“No, no seriously, shut up and listen…”

*plop*

We heard what sounded like a rock falling into water in the distance, maybe 30 feet away…

*plop*

We heard it again.

The friend I was talking to chimed in saying, “It’s probably an animal that just knocked some rocks off a cliff into the water.”

The other friend said, “yeah, you’re probably right”

We didn’t hear anything else so we kept chatting and talking about god knows what.

A few minutes pass us by, haven’t heard anything and have essentially forgotten about the sound.

I started talking about work, moving, and how great it was to now live in a place where a nice getaway with the boys was only a couple hours drive away.

While I was wrapping up my final thought, I heard it…

*plop*

My head turned rapidly towards the sound, wide-eyed…

*plop*

My friends’ heads whipped around towards the creek and I kept facing forwards towards the source of the sound…

*plop*

We all stood up abruptly…

*plop*

We looked at each other, flushed faces…

*ch-ch*

One of the friends had grabbed his shotgun, cocking it. He grasped the gun so hard you could see his knuckles turn white.

*plop*

The two friends looked at each other, nodded as if they had a conversation about what to do, and began walking towards the creek, the source of the sound.

*plop*

They took a few steps… some 20 feet from the sound…

*plop*

The sound grew louder… 15 feet from the sound…

*PLOP*

The sound grew louder with every step closer to the creek… 10 feet…

*PLOP*

We neared the waters edge… 5 feet…

**PLOP**

As we stepped on the bank of the creek, the friend with the shotgun pointed in the direction of the sound, directly in front of him, waited, and…

Nothing

The sound stopped as we came right up on the source.

We waited for what felt like an hour, with our feet on the edge of the water, and still… nothing.

We looked at each other, questioning if we had heard what we thought we had.

After waiting another minute or so we all nodded in agreement that it was time for bed. Maybe we had a few too many to drink.

We all headed back to our tents and with the help of the alcohol I was able to drift off.

I woke up a bit later with a chill, sleeping on the floor of the tent with only a sleeping bag between me and the cold earth.

I began thinking about the sound again… the intervals between them… they seemed so… unnatural.

It wasn’t as if a small stream of water was dripping into the bigger creek at a regular interval… it was more like rocks being dropped in the water at random.

How were these rocks being dropped like this? It couldn’t be from a small rockslide, it went on for too long.

And there wasn’t even a cliff or hill for the rocks to fall from…

*PLOP*

I shot up from my horizontal position, glaring at the closed entrance to my tent in horror.

*PLOP*

This sounded closer, like it could be coming from the banks of the creek…

*PLOP*

No, this sound was closer than the creek banks…

*ch-ch*

The familiar sound of setting a shotgun’s firing mechanism being set into firing position sounded out quietly and slowly from within the tent next to me.

**PLOP**

I sat… staring… realizing now the sound was right outside of our tents… as if it was on top of the now extinguished fire…

**PLOP**

Unable to move out of pure terror, I continued to stare…

*plop*

One faint, final sound rung out…

I waited for another… hearing the heavy breathing from the tent next door… petrified…

I sat there… waiting…

I waited until it was too late to even frivolously attempt to sleep again.

I sat there until I saw the light of the morning sun begin to glow through the thin walls of the tent.

*zzzziip*

Startled, I jumped at the sound of one of my friends opening their tent in the early morning light.

I reached forward and began to unzip my tent. I opened it enough to pull the tent fabric away to peer outside.

After seeing nothing, I felt confident enough to pull the tent wall away to stick my head out, and I see my neighbor doing the same… looking around to make sure whatever was making that sound was not near.

We caught each others attention and, with sunken eyes from a lack of sleep, we questioned what had happened last night, but knew we would not ask what it might have been.

We woke the rest of the group, packed our bags, left no trace, and went on our way.

We still have not spoken about that sound, and I don’t think we ever will.

But I have since lived in an apartment with a leaky faucet… and every once in awhile in the middle of the night….

*plop*

I shiver, and think back to what the source of that sound might have been…
