It has been almost three years since this incident happened, but even today when I remember it, I get a shiver in my heart. So let me take you to that dark night.

As the cold winter wind howled through the deserted streets, I huddled closer to my cousin sister Abhaya, trying to find some warmth in her brave presence. We had just returned from the Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj and were now waiting for a bus to take us back home. The streets were dark and empty, the only sound was that of our chattering teeth and the occasional rustle of leaves in the wind.

I was a 17-year-old boy, known for my cowardly and crybaby nature. On the other hand, my cousin Abhaya was 22 years old and was the complete opposite of me. She was known for her bravery and fearlessness, and I had always admired her for it. As we stood there, shivering in the cold, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. The darkness and emptiness of the streets only added to my fear, and I prayed for the bus to arrive soon.

Just as I was about to suggest that we find some other mode of transport, a figure emerged from the shadows. My heart skipped a beat as I saw a man walking towards us. He was tall and lean, with a hood covering his face. I could feel Abhaya tense up beside me, but she didn't show any signs of fear. Instead, she stood tall and ready to face whatever danger may come our way.

The man stopped a few feet away from us and I could see a glint of something metallic in his hand. It was then that I realized he was a thief, and he was here to steal our belongings. Panic started to rise within me, and I could feel myself trembling. But before I could even think of running away, Abhaya stepped forward and stood between me and the thief.

'What do you want?' she asked, her voice steady and firm.

The man chuckled, his hood falling back to reveal a sinister smile. 'Your belongings, of course,' he replied, his voice dripping with malice.

Abhaya didn't back down, she stood her ground and I could see the thief's smile falter for a moment. But then, he raised his hand and pointed the metallic object towards us. It was a knife, and I could feel my legs turn to jelly. I wanted to run, to hide, but I was frozen in fear.

'Hand over your bags and wallets, and I won't hurt you,' the man said, his tone now more threatening.

Abhaya didn't flinch, she slowly reached for her bag and handed it over to the man. I could see the anger and frustration in her eyes, but she didn't say a word. I, on the other hand, couldn't take it anymore. I started to cry, tears streaming down my face as I begged the man to spare us.

But Abhaya was not one to give up easily. She quickly assessed the situation and came up with a plan. As the man was distracted by my crying, she took a step back and then lunged forward, knocking the knife out of his hand. Before he could react, she grabbed the knife and pointed it towards him.

'You picked the wrong people to mess with,' she said, her voice ice cold.

The man was taken aback, he hadn't expected a young woman to be so brave and fearless. He tried to negotiate with us, but Abhaya was having none of it. She gave him a stern warning and told him to leave before she called the police.

The thief, realizing that he was no match for Abhaya, ran off into the darkness, leaving us unharmed. I couldn't believe what had just happened, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of admiration for my cousin. She had faced the danger head-on and had protected us both.

As we waited for the bus to arrive, Abhaya put her arm around me and comforted me as I continued to cry. But this time, they were tears of gratitude and relief. I couldn't have asked for a better person to have by my side in that terrifying moment.

The rest of the journey back home was filled with stories and laughter as we recounted our encounter with the thief. I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride whenever I looked at Abhaya, knowing that she was my cousin and my protector.

From that day on, I no longer saw myself as a coward or a crybaby. Instead, I saw myself as someone who had the potential to be brave and fearless, just like my cousin Abhaya. And as we arrived back home, I knew that this midnight encounter would be a memory that I would cherish forever.
