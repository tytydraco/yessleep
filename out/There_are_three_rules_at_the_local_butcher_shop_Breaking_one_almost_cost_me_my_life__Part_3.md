The third rule had eaten away at my curiosity the minute I started working there, tearing off pieces of my sanity day after day. George had only mentioned it that first day, but I could feel the weight of it surrounding me. It was inside the walls, always nagging at me, begging and pleading for attention. In the silence between cuts, I would get the urge to look. I had heard and seen enough now to warrant it anyway. Now, I not only wanted a peek, but I wanted to uncover the secret behind cooler number seven. I told myself a quick look wouldn’t hurt. I would be in and out before George even knew I had opened the door. I just needed to find the perfect time to do it.

The next few nights, I couldn’t sleep. I lay on the cot in my cousin’s garage, sweat clinging to my back, fan whirring in slow rotations, trying to drown out the sound of that deep thud I'd heard. It echoed again and again in my head. I kept thinking back to certain situations and phrases from him that seemed to turn stranger and darker the longer I thought about them. I thought back to the first truly intense encounter I had with him. George’s hand on my arm, his fingers cold and intense. That look in his eyes told me he was studying my loyalty to him and his rules, and I obeyed. My stomach cramped as I replayed the visions in my head. My fealty to him was running thin, and so was my self-control. I desperately needed a break.

I didn’t go in the following night. I told myself I was sick. Truthfully, I couldn’t make myself get out of bed. My hands wouldn’t stop twitching. I called George to give him the bad news. He was not happy, saying, “Ok,” before abruptly hanging up the phone. All day and night, my skin crawled with a feeling like I’d touched something I shouldn’t have, and no matter how hard I scrubbed, it was still on me. When I was finally able to sleep, I dreamt of the cooler doors. I was locked inside, unable to break out. I could hear something in there with me, breathing in the dark. I awoke, startled, knowing that I would have to find out what was in there if I ever wanted to have peaceful sleep again.

I didn’t stay out again. I couldn’t afford to… not with the kind of cash he was giving me. When I walked in for my next shift, George didn’t say a word. He didn’t ask if I felt better or why I had called out sick in the first place. He just tossed me an apron, handed me a list of orders, and went back to cutting like nothing had ever happened.

Something had changed. The air felt heavier, and the inside of the shop seemed darker. The coolers hummed louder than usual, mocking me. George’s cleaver hit the block with more force than before, sending bone shards skittering across the floor. It was all different. I just kept my head down and focused on my work, trying not to draw any more attention from him.

It was just after midnight when George told me to clean up and prepare the cutting tables for pork while he “took care of something in the back.” I waited until I heard the door to cooler number one close behind him to make my move. I know now why I shouldn’t have, but at the time, there was no stopping my curiosity. I needed to know.

My feet and hands moved on their own. I crept into the hallway and down through the plastic curtains until I stood in front of cooler seven. I stared at the center of the large metal door before slowly lowering my eyes to the handle. The scratches were worse than before, deeper, and more numerous. I reached out, touching the handle with just my fingertips. It was warm to the touch, which confused me. These were industrial coolers. There is no reason why they should ever be warm.

I slowly pulled the handle. It clicked and opened just a crack. Cold air hissed out, thick and wet. This was not like the other coolers I had grown accustomed to. A cloying stench poured from the crack in the door, clinging to the inside of my nose and making my eyes water. It was so strong and pungent that it made me take a step back from the door. I had almost considered abandoning my mission, but now this only made me want it more.

I pulled the door open further, holding my apron over my nose. I leaned in, pushing my head around the edge of the door. The lighting was dim, flickering in an almost rhythmic fashion. A putrid haze hung in the air, obscuring the edges of the cooler. I squinted, scanning the walls, slowly making my way to the back. The inside was unremarkable. There were meat hooks lining the ceiling, with some large brown boxes haphazardly stacked throughout. I had built myself up to think that George had been hiding something terrible in here and that there was some experiment that had gone wrong. Yet now that I was here, I could see nothing of the sort. I continued surveying the area. I was not ready to give up yet. I had heard multiple strange sounds from cooler number seven, and the terrible stench emanating from it validated my insistence on pushing further.

Between flickers from the lights, my eyes caught a slight glimmer at the back of the cooler. I pushed my body further inside, trying desperately to identify the source without venturing too far. As I entered, the lights faded, bathing the interior in darkness. My heart jumped. I knew I didn’t have much time, and the lights going out didn’t help.

They buzzed back to life, bathing the walls in sickly yellow light once more. With the space now illuminated, I could see to the back of the space. I scanned the back wall from top to bottom, settling my vision between two large, brown boxes in the middle of the floor. There was something unusual about them. They weren’t the normal type that we used. I looked closer, noticing a crack between them that revealed an unobscured view to the back of the cooler.

As I focused my vision on the boxes, one of them jolted upward, like someone had kicked it. A black silhouette emerged from between them and quickly disappeared behind another box that sat next to them. I nervously jumped, thinking that a giant rat would come scurrying out at any moment. Darkness enveloped me once more, now causing panic to rise in my chest. I am deathly afraid of rats, and I could not stand the thought of one crawling across my feet in the dark.

I took a step back, waiting for the lights to kick back on before proceeding further. I pulled my head out of the doorway but continued to hold it open so that I could see inside. In the opening between the two boxes, where I thought I had seen a rat, I saw the same glimmer shine through again. I focused my eyes on it, trying to decipher what it was. The lights flared, shooting a beam across the front of the boxes. My eyes caught something frighteningly familiar as the light faded. Deep within the cooler, between the boxes, another pair of eyes stared back at me.

This was no rat. The eyes were too large and too far apart to be those of any rodent. I thought maybe it was just a carcass that had been laid in an awkward position, and I was seeing the glint from its eyes. That thought, however, was quickly rejected. I couldn’t fool myself. I had seen enough dead animals to know that their eyes stop reflecting light once they are dead. My heart began to thud faster in my chest, each second producing more anxiety.

I stared into the eyes for what felt like an eternity, when suddenly, I heard a sound that broke me from my trance. It was a voice, just barely above a whisper, coming from deep inside the cooler. It wasn’t George, nor anyone else I knew. It was shrill and faint at the same time.

“Help…please…” the voice croaked.

I took another step back. My mind had created horrid creatures and hideous abominations that filled the lore of cooler number seven. Somehow, I had encountered something much worse... a human.

I scrambled backward, slamming the cooler door as quickly as I could. I pushed my hands against it, holding it closed. My heart was beating so fast that I started to feel dizzy from the shock.

“What was that?” I asked myself, shaking violently.

I rested my head against the cooler door, trying to calm myself down and steady my breathing. I had almost regained my composure when the sound of George’s boots clacking against the tile filled my ears. I heard him exit the cooler and enter the hallway. He didn’t say a word, and yet, he knew exactly where to go.

I turned to see him pushing through the plastic curtain, now standing in front of cooler number six. His apron was drenched with fresh blood that covered almost the entirety of his torso. He held a cleaver in one hand and a towel in the other. His face was emotionless, akin to a stone sculpture, commanding and cold.

“You opened it.” He said calmly.

It wasn’t a question; it was a statement. He knew that I had broken the rules.

“I…I…” I stammered, trying to explain myself, but the words wouldn’t come.

George just stood there, staring at me like he’d just found a rat in his pantry. His hand gripped the cleaver harder, the longer he looked at me, causing his knuckles to shake with force. I didn’t know what to say. I was still frozen from what I’d just seen. He stepped forward, slowly and deliberately, coming to a stop right in front of me.

“I told you not to go near cooler number seven.” He said in that same cold, scowling tone. “You broke a rule, son.”

I opened my mouth, trying my best to speak, but nothing came. Every fiber of my being was telling me to run, but my legs wouldn’t obey.

“Did you hear somethin’ in there again?” He asked.

My throat finally relinquished control of my voice, albeit very weakly.

“There was… someone in…inside,” I responded, shakily.

His eyes tightened on me, and his face turned sour, like I had just run over his dog.

“No,” he said flatly. “There wasn’t.”

I opened my mouth to argue, but he cut me off before I could utter another word.

“You’ve been working hard, Tom. I respect that. But this place is old. It will mess with your head if you let it.”

He pulled his face back away from mine a bit, lifting his expression slightly.

“I put rules in place for a reason. It’s so nobody gets hurt or worse. You understand, son?” He asked.

He was searching my face for an answer, yet I was too scared to give one.

He stepped past me and placed his hand on the cooler door.

“I keep this one sealed for a reason,” He explained, “The temperature is unstable. The lighting is bad. More importantly, it’s got a CO2 leak.”

He looked back at me, making sure to look me directly in the eyes.

“That gas’ll get you. It makes you see things that aren’t there… Hear things that aren’t real.”

I knew he was lying. He had to be. There was no way he could run a place in that bad of condition. I nodded anyway, seemingly showing him what he wanted to see.

He watched me a moment longer, then reached out and ruffled my hair like a parent scolding a child.

“You wanna keep working here, you follow the rules. All of them.”

He smiled and turned to walk back toward the cutting room, leaving me standing alone in the freezing hallway.

I stood there for a moment, still too scared to move, pondering what to do next. I couldn’t just forget what I heard, and definitely not what I had seen. I slowly made my way back to the cutting room and prepared the last of the orders so that I could finish my shift. I didn’t leave right away after my shift ended. I wanted to find out what George did at the end of the night and hopefully see what he kept in cooler seven. I waited in my car around the corner until I saw the lights go out in the shop. I saw George emerging from the back door, dragging a large bag on the ground. It was wrapped in plastic and twine, glistening red beneath the dim glow of the lone streetlight.

I watched as he dragged it to his car. He opened his trunk and, with a deep grunt, heaved it in. The weight of it falling into the trunk shook the car violently up and down before it came to a rest. I slunk down in my seat as I watched on. He wiped his hands on his work apron before looking around a couple of times in each direction. He untied the straps of his apron and removed it, tossing it in as well. He slammed the trunk closed and drove out of the parking lot and onto Crenshaw Street.

I followed him, staying just far enough behind not to raise suspicion. I had to know what he was hiding, and I would soon find out what.
