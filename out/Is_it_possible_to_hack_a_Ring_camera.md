Our Ring cameras keep missing things they shouldn’t. I’m looking for advice on how to proceed. It will help if you have some context.

My wife and I recently used my VA loan benefits to buy an investment house in what we’ll call an “up-and-coming” part of Houston, Tx. For those that don’t know, VA loans require you to live in the home for at least a year. We moved in 4 months ago.

The neighborhood is not without its charms, although I’m not convinced the pros have outweighed the cons. There are many new-builds going up like the one we bought, a great daycare a few blocks away, and bike lanes and speed bumps popping up every other week. There is good food nearby, and it’s quieter than our previous neighborhood. But the enjoyable silence is often interrupted by loud dogs, car alarms, shit-box Hondas blasting homemade SoundCloud mixes, fireworks and gunfire. There’s one neighbor two blocks away who often gets drunk (presumably) and repeatedly puts several mags through his pistol. It’s always around 2am. One of our neighbors had his second-story window shot out over the weekend. The cops said it was likely random, or a stray bullet, and not gang related or meant to be intimidation. But who knows. We’ve heard people will do that sort of thing in an attempt to ward off gentrification.

We also have the pleasure of living next to an abandoned building that we call the “treehouse.” We share a fence with it. It’s butted so close up against our property line that I can reach over the fence and touch it.

You can guess how it looks based on our nickname. Large weeds with woody trunks grow out of every orifice of the structure. Out of the stove pipe protrudes a plant with a stem as thick as a baseball bat. The house is wrapped in vines that sprout thick foliage from ground to roof. The siding that is still visible is covered in moss. The gutters are packed with dirt and dead leaves. They look like unkempt flower boxes with the many small plants growing up every few inches. The ground is covered in a thick layer of shrubs and thorn bushes that poke through to our side of the fence. If we don't trim them as they grow through, the dogs get snagged by thorn branches.

The treehouse creeks in the wind and the shingles and vinyl siding are beginning to fall off as weeds grow between the overlaps. A few windows are busted out. I’ve seen many opossums and raccoons climb in and out of the treehouse through the windows as well as holes in the eaves and soffits where the wood has rotted. The windows that are intact are covered with blankets from the inside. Each second story window has black, iron bars placed on the inside, which struck me as strange. Most homes in this neighborhood have barred windows, but always on the outside.

Last January, a harsh cold front came through. You may have seen “Texas freeze” in the news. Having lived through two of those already, we decided to skip town and stay with my wife’s parents who have a large property in a small town about 45 minutes away. We returned home to a loud hiss. I immediately thought a pipe had burst. I searched the downstairs, upstairs, and garage, but didn’t find any signs of water. When searching the outside of the house, I felt a mist on the back of my neck. I instinctively turned toward it and saw a puddle at the base of our fence that borders the treehouse. I looked over the fence and through the shrubs I could see an exposed pipe gushing water. The treehouse yard was flooded and was beginning to spill over into ours. I walked around the corner and turned the water off at the street which stopped the hissing and flooding. The power is also on to the house. I know this because, unfortunately, our master bath window looks directly into a second-story window of the treehouse that glows every night around the sill. My guess is a light was left on when the house was abandoned for good.

My biggest concern is a hurricane will hit Houston, as they do, and knock it over onto our property. We’ve reported it to the city but—shocker!—they haven’t done shit. Public works came out once, took pictures, cited it for overgrown weeds, and closed our 311 complaint. 

In addition to that, the homeless in this area are aggressive. There is one who is nicer and more coherent than most, and so we try to help him out. But I had to put an end to that after he walked into our back yard while contractors were assembling our pergola and took a beer out of their cooler. I had a talk with him, and to his credit, he didn’t come around for a while. But lately he rings our doorbell at every hour. We finally unplugged it when he woke our 5-year old from her nap.

Speaking of contractors. A month ago they had about $500 worth of tools stolen from their truck while it was parked in our driveway. They knew the neighborhood and had locked the truck. But the thieves busted out the window, grabbed what they could, then sped off. The contractors ran to the front of the house when they heard the glass break and alarm go off, but were too late. And our garage camera didn’t catch any of it. This is when our Ring troubles began.

The same camera also missed my car getting stolen out of our driveway. Based on the 1-hour snapshot Ring cameras take, it was between 11 and midnight. Through a stroke of good luck, the cops recovered the car and insurance paid for everything. It’s parked in my garage right now (which is where it stays parked). We were very frustrated the camera missed the theft as my car was parked directly underneath it.

Our garage camera and gate camera, which have overlapping sectors, both managed to miss a package getting stolen. It was a man wearing a black hoodie and ratty jeans. I only know this because I witnessed it happen. Our home office sits over the garage and my desk looks out into the street. I watched as the bastard sprinted up to our gate, then sprinted off with our chewy order. I found the box lying in the ditch in front of the tree house a week later. The bag of dog food was missing.

The camera covering the walkway from the front gate to the backyard failed to catch an old window AC unit fall from the second story of the treehouse onto the walkway. The camera is maybe 10 yards from the window on a direct line. Fortunately it happened at night and no one was hurt.

I was really baffled when our backyard camera missed our patio furniture moving in the middle of the night. I was letting the dogs out one morning and almost tripped over one of the chairs. It had been moved and the cover was neatly folded and placed behind it. I asked my wife if she sat in it the night before and forgot to put the cover back on. She didn’t know what I was talking about. So, I opened the Ring app. 11pm. Chair where we left it with the cover on.12 midnight. Chair moved to face the backdoor and cover on the ground behind it. The chair was 3 feet from the camera. Someone made significant movement directly in front of it without triggering it.

I have to admit, although this sort of trespassing is common in Houston, it’s made me uneasy. It’s why I keep a gun in my nightstand.

Can any of this be explained? It’s especially confusing because we know the cameras work. My wife and I, our dogs, passing cars, and pedestrians trigger the motion sensors every day. We’re at the end of our rope with Ring. We’ve contacted them after each incident and they only ever suggest turning the sensitivity up, making sure the batteries are charged, and checking the Wi-Fi connection. We’ve tried it all.

I have zero evidence someone is meddling with them. But what else could it be? Maybe someone is hacking them?

Please let me know if you’ve had a similar problem and how you fixed it.
