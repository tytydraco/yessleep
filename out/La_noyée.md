Every twenty-four hours, on this miserable Earth, about 380,000 children are born.

That’s roughly four babies every second: just enough time to sneeze, and here you have four new whining, annoying lives, ready to tread the earth and live their own experiences, unaware of everything they will soon be forced to face.

Four new lives every second, which means that 140 million babies are born each year, and in ten years, it amounts to 1.4 billion.

Too many.

The dead, in fact, are far fewer: every second, in the world, only one person dies, immediately replaced by four fresh new factory-made substitutes. A positive turnover, thank you very much, but one that will inevitably lead to the irreparable overcrowding of this pointless galactic shoebox.

By merely analyzing births and deaths over a humble timeframe of just ten years, we arrive at a surplus of almost a billion individuals; extending this to more ambitious and larger timescales, it’s clear that, based solely on nature’s razor, it’s impossible to expect our planet to tolerate so many people, even if we industrialized the vast empty spaces of the Earth, building megacities in the Sahara or enormous platforms in the ocean. The only path to relief comes from fate, occasionally called upon to trim down the massive human surplus burdening Earth’s fragile household balance, laying off the excess workforce with diseases, plagues, wars, and destructive natural events.

And yet, despite everything and despite a number so high it seems almost favorable or auspicious, being born is one of the rarest things in the universe.

Once again, some simple (and simplified) calculations are needed: if every sexually active male in the world (about 75% of four billion people) had sex once a week, every hour – more or less simultaneously – there would be almost 18,000 people having sex, which means that every day – in the world – there are approximately 900,000 ejaculations. Now, considering that about 1 billion sperm cells are released during each ejaculation, the odds that you – dear victorious sperm reading this – managed on that specific day to fertilize your mother’s egg is one in 900 trillion.

The odds of winning the lottery are one in 622 million.

This means that if each possibility equated to a grain of rice, to win the lottery, you would only need – simply – to pick the right grain from a pile of 622 million grains, which would take up about the space of a medium-sized truck or a small commercial van.

To pick the right grain and be born, however, you would need to choose it carefully from among 900 trillion grains, which would occupy the space of 10,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools, filled to the brim with rice. To examine all the pools before choosing the right one, you would need to walk more than 500 kilometers.

Unfortunately, to be born, you need a huge amount of luck, and I had it.

I was born today, December 21st, at night, in a hospital resembling a suburban discount store, the kind frequented only by alcoholics who come in to buy those canned beers with German names, to seem more appealing even though they cost 20 cents each.

Everything is so different from the world I knew, and yet everything is familiar.

If just a short while ago, I was surrounded by the comforting darkness of my mother’s womb, now the neon lights blind me, making me feel warm, restless; my eyes squint, and my mouth contracts, I start crying as I hear only confused noises around me, without form, not yet at least, coming from dark, faceless figures, blurred and distant.

Only one sound seems familiar, reassuring, and close: it’s my mother’s voice.

As I look around with new eyes, I see that we’re in a large room, with a lot of objects and tools I’ve never seen before.

I calm down and feel my heartbeat, something I’ve never felt before, and then I only think of my mother’s labored breathing; I see her next to me, but I can’t reach her, I can’t touch her. She’s lying on a bed, and I’m instead wrapped in a warm cloth, thinking I’d be better off in her arms than in an impersonal, foreign piece of fabric.

My mother looks at me; for a moment, I meet her tear-filled eyes full of love, but I understand that she does so only to reassure me, to offer me a look despite the fear. She’s scared, after all, I can sense it, I know it, I’ve been with her for nine months; she starts breathing heavily, and with her exhausted face, she stretches her arms towards me, trying to reach me but unable to hold me. The dark figures around me begin to move frantically, emitting indistinct sounds, speaking to each other in low, concerned voices, while more figures approach my mother, perhaps trying to help her.

I see her pale, paler by the moment, and I don’t understand what’s happening; I see her tear-filled eyes look at me and then close, but I still hear her breathing, I still see her lying on the bed, she’s alive, I know she is, but she’s tired, she’s suffering.

A moment later, I hear her labored breathing stop.

I feel my heart race in fear, I see my mother finally lying relaxed, motionless, no longer moving; the dark figures around me, meanwhile, seem to have resigned themselves.

I still don’t understand what’s happening; all I know is that my mother is no longer here with me: she’s somewhere else.

On the other side.

Elsewhere.
