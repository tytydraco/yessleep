When I was a teenager, I lived in a small desert town. A tourist town really, think cowboy historic, with lots of old buildings and dust. I was able to make some extra cash babysitting on the weekends, because there wasn’t much else to do in the town anyways.

One night I was babysitting for a couple that had an infant, I met them at Target, they seemed like a nice couple and knew of another family I sat for. They lived way out of town. So far out that street names are gone, and you use mile markers as your signs to know where you are. 

It was an easy gig, baby was staying asleep, just had to feed him when he woke up. Parents would be back around midnight. 

I cozied up on the couch with Netflix and settled in for a chill night, when the doorbell rang.

Thinking it was one of the parents who forgot something, I jumped up and opened the door immediately, to nothing, it seemed. I shrugged and started to close the door when I heard a soft voice.

“Miss?”

I stopped the door, and looked around the corner, to see a girl standing on the steps to the porch. She was about my age, had long hair, and a hoodie pulled up. But her eyes, they were so light blue they were almost glowing in the dark.

“Do you live at this house?”, she had asked me.

“Oh..”, I started, “No, I’m just visiting”

I was careful not to say too much, because although the girl seemed harmless she was still a stranger.

“Is Mrs. Rosino home? I need to talk to her”, she asked. She seemed nervous. Twiddling her thumbs, looking behind me into the house.

“You know what, she just stepped out to go to the store. I can tell her you stopped by, if you tell me your name?”, I said slightly backing up. Ready to close the door.

She stepped towards me, eyes darting around, and she put her hand over the zipper on her hoodie. She leaned forward and whispered.

“Please tell me where she is, I don’t want to hurt you”

My heart dropped.

She removed her hand from the zipper, and really looked at me, her eyes pleading. 

“I’m sorry, she really isn’t here right now”, I said with a tight expression.

Her face turned desperate, but at that point I had been thoroughly creeped out, so I closed the door and locked it.

I called the Rosino’s to let them know, once I described the girl, they grew frantic. They told me they were calling the police, and to stay with the baby. I still remember Mrs. Rosino screaming into the phone “Don’t leave my baby!”, over and over.

I ran down the hall to the nursery, threw open the door and ran to the crib. The baby was sound asleep still. I scooped him up gently and sat in the rocker with him in one arm, my phone in the other. 

“Help will be here soon..” I had whispered, more to comfort myself than anything.

Then the banging started.

I could hear the front door shake from the force used to knock on the wood, then the sound moved.

Why aren’t there any sirens? The police station wasn’t far from this area at all, right before you turned on the mile marker. They should be here by now.

I heard the banging travel along the house, one big knock at a time.

Bang. They were by the living room.

Bang. They were by the kitchen.

Bang. They were by the hallway.

I got out my phone and texted “911 HELP” to my mom, she knew where I was babysitting tonight. She responded immediately with question marks, then tried calling. I silenced the call, I couldn’t risk answering and the intruders hearing me. My mom would make sure the police got her.. I knew it..

Slowly moving closer and closer to where I hid in the nursery, the window was locked tightly with the blinds closed. But glass… is breakable.

BANG. They were at the wall next to the window.

I backed away from the window to the corner of the room, when I heard the front door creek open.

The baby boy still asleep in my arms, I started to cry. I whimpered, like a wounded puppy. I couldn’t fight someone off while holding him, but I wasn’t going to put him down.

Footsteps descended the hallway, I heard muffled voices while doors were being opened and closed.

“Where is the nursery?”, a gruff voice asked.

“I-I don’t know Daddy, I couldn’t see the floor plan online..”, the same small voice of the girl from earlier answered.

“If that little girl wants to help them that’s fine, but he belongs to us. No one can keep him from us now..”

“Daddy, please. Maybe she will understand..”

The voices stopped right outside the door.

The baby started to stir, I shushed him quietly and rocked him back and forth.

Then I heard the sirens.

I shot a thank you up to whoever was watching over me, grateful that this nightmare would soon be over.

But the weirdest thing happened.

The footsteps didn’t retreat.

No one ran, no one left, no one… moved.

I was sure they were going to come in and finish me off, right before the police showed up. And then steal the baby into the night.

But that didn’t happen either.

Loud footsteps came walking through the house, a boisterous voice called out towards the hallway.

“Excuse me, sir. Are you a resident here? We got a call that a little girl was in trouble, is she her?”

Muffled voices sounded and trailed off, walking outside. I was waiting to hear anything. Yelling, screaming, more sirens. But it was silent.

After what seemed like hours, heavy footsteps walked directly down the hallway toward me, and the door opened.

A uniformed officer looked stern, and took a look at me cowered in the corner with the Rosino baby.

“Hey sweetie, are you alright?”, he asked, bending down to meet me at eye level.

“Y-Yes. Those people were trying to take the baby! They were going to kill me! Why did it take you so long to get here???”, I cried out. Finally letting the tears fall, as the adrenaline hit was coming down.

The officer looked confused.

“We came out the second the call came in, we made it here in about 5 minutes. Did you try to call in sooner?”, he pulled his radio to his face, asking his other officer if any other calls were attempted.

“Well.. no, but.. the Rosino’s called you at least 30 minutes ago. I called them first and they said they were calling you right away and to hide with the baby.. so..”, I looked down at Baby Rosino. He had finally fully woken up, and started to quietly cry.

The officer just stared at me, a mix of sympathy and fear in his eyes.

“Where are his parents? They surely should be here by now.. He’s probably a little scared and needs his mom. Did you arrest those psychos?”, I patted his back and bounced him in my lap, to help comfort him.

The officer smiled sadly at me, and spoke into his radio.

“You can send them in”

After a few moments the nursery door opened, and the teenage girl stepped through, with a large man behind her. 

“Oh.. Oh..”, the girl started to sob. Putting her hands up to cover her face. The older man placed his hand on her shoulder and looked at me sadly.

The policeman stood, and reached for the baby.

“No!”, I shouted, “What are you doing? Are you working with them? This is the Rosino’s son!”

The girl finally spoke.

“No he isn’t, he’s mine”
