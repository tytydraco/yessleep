Did you miss the grocery store? That’s okay.

It’d seem pretty badass if I walked right from the field, covered in mud, half-dead to pop in the DVD. But by the time I meet up with Punch and his friends I barely have the energy to eat. 

Time has a funny way of passing when important things are going on. Everyone likes to talk about summers that last forever, but my situation is kind of the opposite. 

It's a couple of weeks before I’m in shape enough to do anything but watch YouTube in a guest bedroom of Sveta’s place. As my fractured wrist sets and I get used to the less than obvious issues with having a messed up eye (don’t ask) I try to get a sense of how things work. 

I spend most of my time with Mike, not by choice. Like anyone with a brain, clowns creep me out. Mike can wear jeans and a t-shirt all he wants ( Who are ‘ The Ramones’ by the way? ), but floppy shoes or no, he’s a clown. 

The reason Punch and the rest give me is something to do with supernatural things making me sick. I didn’t quite understand the fine print, but have to trust someone. 

In my short time with these…people? I’ve picked up on a few things. Thought maybe I’d share them, as this situation doesn’t really have the viewpoint of anyone…normal. 

 I believe them when they say the supernatural can hurt you if you get too close. Punch is my favorite, but if I’m around him too much I just don’t feel right. It’s not something you notice till it’s pointed out, but it makes you wonder what’s happening. 

Overnight, Kaz went from looking like a melted candle with claws to an old man. Leo and Sveta seemed to know why but neither would tell me. Either way, I like him better like this.  

Most of Mike’s…friends left after the first week. A few things keep an eye on the house from outside but I try not to think about them. 

Everyone here is just as scared as I am. 

The feeling this is all a dream is so strong I find myself pinching and slapping myself from time to time. I watch my neighbourhood go on as if we didn’t just have monsters and soldiers killing each other in the streets. 

Only a couple of people died besides my family. I can’t go outside and ask, but I see on Instagram and Twitter their disappearances are being explained by work accidents and heart attacks. 

“How can people not be asking questions?” I ask. 

Mike pours a large bowl of ‘ L’il Donuts ‘ cereal. 

“Asked myself that question a while back. Got told the universe has ways of smoothing things over, making sure the world doesn’t know too much too soon. 

Has it’s limits of course, but no one is brave enough to test them. It’s why spooky things get done in the shadows. “ He replies. 

He’s put foundation on the scars on his face. He’s good, if I didn’t know they were there I’d never guess. I don’t know if he’s self conscious or trying to make me less uncomfortable. 

“So that’s it, people just get killed? No consequences?” I say, suddenly not feeling hungry. 

Mike adds chocolate milk to the oversized bowl. 

“Is that why you’re staying around? Because you don’t think there’s going to be any consequences?” Mike smirks at me. 

“I’m staying because none of you will let me leave. “ I lie. 

“Bullshit, kid. Everyone sleeps sometimes, you could skip town in the middle of the night. No way we stop what we’re doing to chase you. 

Can I give you some advice?” The clown says, stirring his cereal. 

“That’s what adults say when they’re about to lecture you. By the way, that stuff will rot your teeth.” I pout. 

Mike grins, I see half of his teeth are a pointed, cracked mess. 

“I’ll take my chances. 

The universe fucking *hates* revenge. Deep down everyone knows this, but take it from me, no matter how you try and get around this basic law of nature, it does nothing but ruin you. 

You can say you’re avenging the dead, or saving the innocent. The universe doesn’t give a shit. It knows  why, it sees through that garbage like a fifth grade teacher hearing about dog chewed homework. 

You staying, it’s about revenge. And everyone else here is too far up their own supernatural asses to point that out. “ This is why I hate Mike. Whenever he talks I can’t tell if he’s being mean or nice. 

He eats like his food it’s going to run away from him. Not messy, but quicker than I’ve seen an adult eat. 

“What makes you different?” I say, buttering a lukewarm piece of toast. 

Mike grabs a bottle from the liquor cabinet, adds some to his orange juice, and takes out his pill container. 

“If you shoot me in the face I die?” Mike jokes, “ Real answer? I’m not from here, and I want to get back. 

Where I’m from there are no monsters, or ghosts, or whatever the hell that bug-filled thing is. 

‘Monsters’ were cruel people with too much time and too many connections. Not superpowers or magic. 

This means that I’m not invested in this World of Darkness horse-shit going on. And you shouldn’t be either. “ 

“Who else would watch the DVD?” I say, offended. 

“Open your eyes kid, the whole creepy Harry Potter thing? It’s the rest of them justifying using a child soldier. 

Better intentions maybe, but it’s no different than gangs using kids your age. They tell themselves it’s because they can’t get time, while ignoring the fact bullets don’t have a young offenders act. “ Mike finishes the bowl of cereal as he talks. The way he drops the information so casually makes me angry. 

“So I’m just dumb? And everyone doesn’t care if I die?” I spit. 

“Easy, Alex. “ Mike says pouring more of the packaged tooth decay, “I’m not calling you dumb and I have no right to judge other people’s intentions. 

This is why they call it an  ‘adult situation’ , things are more complicated than that. 

What I’m saying is, don’t take everything at face value. 

You want to stop the people who killed your family. Fine. Don’t let that change who you are. Look at this crap like a tragedy you have to endure. You start to let people convince you it’s some kind of morally right adventure, that’s when things go bad. “


I spend time thinking about what Mike said. Wondering how much my life is going to change, if it’s even possible for it to get back to normal. 

Every night I think about doing exactly what Mike suggested, taking off, trying to get to my aunt’s house in Maine maybe. But there’s something keeping me here. I know I’ll never be able to get beyond what I’ve seen if I don’t try and do something about it. 

Like a school project, wanting to do something and doing it are two different things ( Thank you Mrs. Lankhout. ). It takes me a few weeks to get up the courage to talk to Kaz.

“So, what next?” I ask. 

It’s just the two of us in the living room. The place has been cleaned up and repaired. No sign of the Bishop or his people. 

“If you’re ready, we get you prepared to start the next part of the ritual. 

I’m sorry to say, but my information on the mechanics of the event is minimal. You’ll likely need to do a lot of thinking on your toes. 

You’ll have to go to your home, alone. Of course, you’ll be watching the film, but that’s only where things begin. 

You know what a ritual is, do you know what they do?” Kaz asks. 

“Lots of things, from what I’ve read. “ I reply. 

“True, but the way they do these things is that they give power to something. In a small area, for a small amount of time, you will be giving agency to something that likely shouldn’t have it. 

Once the film is over, the ritual begins. It may not seem like one, not everything is black candles and backwards bible verses. But make no mistake, this is congress with the void. 

There are 5 mistakes you cannot make. Other than that I’ve no more help to offer. 

Do not eat anything other than what you bring. 

Do not change the channel. 

Do not leave the room where the television set is located. 

Do not exchange anything. Favors, items, anything. 

Do not ignore anything speaking to you. “ As Kaz explains, I’m confused. 

“Okay, I guess. So why are we doing this? How’s it going to help?” I ask. 

“If, no, when you complete the ritual, the reward is one question. Any question you can think of, answered truthfully and fully. 

The entity bound to the ritual isn’t omniscient, no matter what it may want people to believe . It gains its information as needed from forces well beyond itself. 

You’re going to ask it if it knows what happened in your house. And if my understanding of it’s motivations is correct, it will use its newfound information to curry favor with those over the bishop. “ Kaz says, as if this kind of thing happens all the time. 



It's one in the morning as I walk down the street. The only signs of what happened are some repairs and new plants. 

How could people wake up to a missing porch or uprooted oak, and not get that something happened? 

Monsters, demons, whatever, they scare the hell out of me. But more than that, this feeling of an unknowable force working to make sure help isn’t coming, makes me want to just start walking toward Maine. 

But I stamp down that fear, and find myself in my in my old house, in front of an older tube television I know wasn’t there before. 

The doorway to my room is scorched, and the entire place smells like blood and melted plastic. My mind starts to panic and drift.  A burning sensation in my hurt eye makes me realize I’m crying, snapping me back to reality. 

I have enough food to last a few days in an old duffle bag. I drop it to the floor, breathing starting to speed up. 

The only thing I can use as a chair is an ottoman, I pull it close to the television. 

Things have already started, neither the t.v. nor the DVD player sitting on top should be here. 

My hand stops, the disk inches from the opening of the DVD player. A soft hum coming from inside the outdated machine. 

Regret hits the moment the disk starts to slide inside the player. 

I grip the edges of the ottoman as the poorly animated characters appear on the screen. Ready for any number of horrible media related events or creatures. 

But the longer the film goes, the more it just…is what it is. It’s an old, cheap, bad rip-off of Veggietales. Nothing scary, no hidden messages or glimpses of my dead family. I watch, and I start to relax. Even laughing a little at how stupid the show is. 

Which is to say, I wasn’t thinking on my toes. 

The air around me seems to sour, like it’s charged with some kind of rotten energy. 

A lot of people are scared of the dark, myself included. But I never thought I’d feel the same about daylight. 

The room brightens ever so slightly as the DVD starts to end. I turn toward the window, wondering what’s going on. It can’t be any later than 2 or 3. 

I scream, falling off of the ottoman. 

Beside me, I see him. 

He’s a little kid, maybe 6 or 7. There, but not. Flickering, looking  washed out. 

Then, from somewhere I can’t explain, I understand him. 

He was the first. Whatever is on the other end of the ritual, it picked him. Now he’s part of this. 

And as quickly as he appeared, he’s gone. But my mind is filled with images, brief flashes of memories that aren’t mine. The poor kid’s weekly tradition of getting up at 4:30 on Saturday and watching his favorite Movie before the start of cartoons. Then the day things changed, the day he became a gear in a supernatural death machine. 

For a while the screen is blank. The room starts to brighten further. 

Maybe I’m weird, but I’ve always been creeped out worse by those few hours before sunlight than any other time of day. Maybe it’s because you’re almost never up that early for a good reason. The world feels empty in a way that it shouldn’t be, daylight and empty streets is its own kind of horror. 

The television flickers to life, hazy, grainy images start to focus. 

It’s a commercial for some kind of fancy jump rope. The kids in it are acting excited, and happy, but when the camera hits their faces, they’re strained with terror. 

The cut to the television show is harsh, suddenly I’m looking at an intro for a show called “Stevie Scavenger’s Silly Search.”.

The animation is old, better than the DVD but not by much. 

The main character is a crow, it’s voice is obnoxiously friendly, strangely though, it’s not black, but an off-white. 

It's in a room full of things I would associate with ‘adventure’ backpacks, climbing gear, canteens , those big floppy hats. But the more I look, I see things I can’t recognize that don’t seem like they should be there. Shining chrome tools that look more like they should be in a doctor’s office, bags of something called Lye, and other weird stuff. 

“Well hello there! Glad you could make it back!” Stevie says, loudly enough it almost feels like he was trying to stop me from looking too close. 

The crow stands still, I don’t know what I’m supposed to do. The DVD was just a DVD, do I respond, did I miss something?

“Hi, I’m Alex.” I say, trying my best to think on my feet. 

It doesn’t look like Sammy heard me. 

“And good morning to you! Its time for a new adventure!” The crow says, turning his back to me and rummaging through some shelving in the background. 

I look outside and my stomach drops. It’s a neighbourhood, nothing strange or sinister, but its not *my* neighbourhood. It looks like early morning, no later than 5 am or so.. 

Then I see the house around me. Besides the dimly lit livingroom, everything else has changed. The architecture feels, off centre, warped, as If the entire room has been roughly removed and jammed into another house. It's all in a deep shadow, contrasting the unnatural light of the room. 

When I turn back to the television Stevie is holding a generic looking brown sack with a question mark on it. One end looks kind of…wet. 

“Can’t show up to someone’s house without a gift! What do you say to seeing my old friend…” the television scrambles for a moment, warping the image and drowning out the name of Stevie's  friend. 

I don’t miss a beat. 

“Sure!” I say, hopping enthusiasm helps. 

Stevie doesn’t reply, instead a commercial harshly cuts on. Seems like one of those old PSA’s people like to react to on YouTube. A man in a light brown suit stands in front of a strange sign. A red letter M with a black X through it. 

“Are you concerned you or someone you know may be experiencing symptoms of…” I’m curious as to what he’s talking about, I lean forward. 

A knocking at the window has me spinning toward it, heart racing, as the concerned man in the television goes on about something called the M. 

It’s Mike, he’s in costume like the first night. 

“Alex, you need to get back to the house, we’re calling things off, it’s too dangerous. “ he yells through the window. 

“ Symptoms include: Disorganized thoughts, delusions of grandeur, violent outbursts…” the man on the television continues.

Mike slaps his open palms on the window hard enough to shake the glass. 

“We need you Alex, there’s no time to explain!” Mike yells. 

I’m walking toward the window, something about what’s going on, on the television seems important, but I can’t ignore Mike. 

“Hurry up kid, out the front door, chop chop.” Mike encourages me. 

And I’m about to do just that, when I notice something. 

The light outside is bad, the window grime and smoke stained, but Mike doesn’t look quite right. 

“ Physical abnormalities, digestive trouble, odd cravings…” the television continues as Mike slams his hands on the window again. 

I’m stopped, trying to figure out what exactly is wrong. He’s dressed like he was that first night, almost…

Then it hits me. 

He looks like someone tried drawing Mike by a description. All the elements of a scary clown are there, but not in the right…proportions, design? 

I remember what Kaz said about not leaving the room till things are over. 

I want to tell whatever is imitating Mike it’s trick didn’t work, but it disappears in a blink.

The commercial ends with a telephone number I will not be giving out here. And soon I’m back to Stevie, looking a little impatient. 

 “Where should we start our search?” Stevie says. As he does three options appear in white text. 

The Forest.

The City.

The third option I can’t quite read. The white text keeps appearing over things that make it blend in. 

“The forest?” I say, figuring either of the options are as good of a place to start. 

“The city? Sure, lets check it out!” Stevie says, either ignoring or not hearing my suggestion. 

The animation shows Stevie walking through a small town, it alternates to his point of view every so often. When it does, it changes to small clips, a park, an empty ice cream shop, and an alley. 

“Doesn’t look like my friend is in the city, lets try the forest next!” Stevie says.  

I’m scared enough I could puke, but it’s actually making me thirsty. I keep my eyes on the television not wanting to miss anything, as I grab a bottle of water from the food bag. 

The scene on the television changes to a very low quality video of someone walking through a sparse, garbage strewn forest. Stevie narrates. 

“I miss the forest sometimes. There are so many interesting things here. “ He says. 

I see a small girl, interested in something in the back of a rusted out old car. 

Whoever is filming walks closer, the child onscreen completely unaware. 

Things feel sinister, like I’m watching something I shouldn’t be. 

The camera gets closer, the girl is leaning into the car, I see an off-white leather-gloved hand in the bottom corner of the screen.

I cough, nervous, I take a drink of the…apple juice?

I panic, spitting the liquid out, missing whatever horror happens on the ancient television. My heart races, I toss the bottle, hoping I managed to stop myself in time. 

I think of all the terrible things that could happen, my mind races. 

I trip over the ottoman as the commercial cuts in. On screen is a stop motion chocolate bar I’ve never heard of doing everything from playing basketball to piloting a plane. 

Despite the situation the jingle is pretty catchy. 

“It’s really rad, Snacktastic. It’s no fad, Snacktastic. 

It’s healthy too, Snacktastic. It’s great for you, Snacktastic.” As the song starts to repeat, I grab a water from my bag, looking this time.

I look out the window, making sure not to get to focussed on one thing, when I have no idea what to expect next. 

I catch it, the last line of the jingle, on the fifth or sixth repetition “ It’s healthy too, Snacktastic. It’s  *behind * you, Snacktastic.”

I look, and for a brief moment I see a large shape walking through the deeply shadowed, off kilter kitchen. 

I can’t make out where it where it went no matter how hard I try. Either it’s blending in with the kitchen or has went somewhere else. 

“Alex, we have one place left we havn’t been.” I hear Stevie say from behind me. 

I’m frozen, I don’t know what I’m afraid of, but at the same time, I know things are going to get worse. 

But I volunteered for this, I turn, slowly to see Steve looking directly at me, making eye contact. 

The third option isn’t hidden anymore. It’s my address.

  “Our friend is with you Alex. “ Stevie says, the tone of loss and fear in his voice makes me want to bolt out the front door. 

Noises from a different part of the house. 

“He wants to be your friend too. “ Stevie begins, “I can get you out, it’s not too late. He can’t tell you anything you can’t find out somewhere else. “ 

I see a glimmer of hope. I understand what’s going on, I’ve read enough stories online to know Stevie is just a part of this too, trapped with whatever entity is summoned by the ritual. 

But then it hits me. 

These things are older than me, smarter than me, and have decades , maybe centuries of experience with people. They know I know this, Stevie is playing me. 

“I’m not exchanging anything. “ I say, trying to keep my voice even.

Stevie gives me a look that I can’t unsee before the television cuts off. 

I’m alone, in a room lit by a sun that has no business being out, surrounded by nonsensical rooms from a house I’ve never been in. 

A feeling starts brewing. Cold and isolation, like I’m the only person left on a dying world. 

The livinigroom around me begins to flicker and blur as a shadowy form begins to take shape in one of the non Euclidian Rooms connected to it. 

It’s huge, it’s face alone nearly the size of me. It strains at the edge of the room from the other house and my livingroom. 

No words I have will describe it well enough. It wasn’t like smoke, or fog, it’s nearly amorphous body moved with physics people could never understand. 

Massive white eyes with black pupils and a large, grey-lipped mouth are all I can make out clearly. The features shift and jitter, as if keeping them is a strain on the entity. 

“Ask” it says, drawing the word out like a sentence. 

I try to speak, nothing happens. 

This thing isn’t like the sniper, Punch, or Kaz. Not even Sveta seemed as scary as the thing in front of me. 

The rage filled look it gives me forces me to whisper, “ Do you know what happened here?”.

“I do…now.” It says, a tone of understanding and malice making it’s elongated statement feel like a threat. 

I hear a humming behind me, the entity rises looking down at me from the ceiling. 

“Witness.” It hisses, forming a many fingered, onyx clawed hand from the formless mass of it’s body and pointing toward the television. 

I’m spun around my a force I can’t see. I can’t close my eyes, I can’t look away. 

“The knowledge you seek comes with knowledge you shouldn’t have. Information that by it’s very nature will be a cancer to your soul. I’m no butcher of flesh and bone. I am he, I am the all knowing, and you, despite your best efforts will be my prophet. “ The entity says as I watch the screen. 

He’s not wrong about what was playing. And for that reason, I’m not going to describe in detail what I saw on that screen. I’ll call it war, but it’s as much war as what I’m doing right now is a movie night. I can’t even say I fully understood what was happening, but I can’t take the chance that one of you does. 

I’m sure you can all tell I survived the ordeal, it’d be pretty hard to type if I got eaten or something. ( or maybe not, it’s a weird world. ). 

I made it back to Sveta’s house, and answered the dozens of questions everyone had for me. 

But what I saw, saying I can’t unsee it is not only a cliché, but doesn’t do it justice. The knowledge is nearly a physical force, an itching nagging sensation in my brain that rivals my torn up eye. 

Punch wants to get back on next week, and I have no problem with that. I thought letting the world know what was going on would make me feel like I’m doing something good for people. But I’m starting to understand danger isn’t just ghosts and guns. There are ideas, information out there that can hurt people. And I want to make sure I’m not contributing to that. 

Alex.
