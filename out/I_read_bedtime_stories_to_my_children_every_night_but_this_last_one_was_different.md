“One more story, one more story! Please, Dad!” Julius and Rachel cried out to me. 

I let go of the door knob and turned the bedroom light back on then walked over to Rachel’s bed, sitting back down at the end of it. 

“Okay, one more. But that’s it,” I said. 

I never understood children and their drug-like addiction to scaring the hell out of themselves. My children, Julius and Rachel, love scary stories. They can’t sleep without hearing a few. 

I had just finished reading three of them. One was about a ghost, another about a vampire, and then a story about a house cat who could transform into a lion and devour its enemies whenever it pleased. 

“No, not that one, Dad. We want that one over there!” Rachel said, pointing to the closet. 

I opened the closet to find a book on a counter. It was completely white, with nothing on the front or back. No words, no images, nothing. I thumbed through its pages and forced a breath through my nostrils. 

“Honey?” I said, still looking through the book. “There’s nothing here. Where’d you get this anyway?”

“I don’t know. Julius brought it home.”

“Okay well, nothing to read here. It’s completely blank,” I replied, still flipping through its white pages while sitting at the end of the bed. 

Julius came up to me. “Here, Dad, let me show you.”

Rachel and I sat and watched as he placed it down on the bed. 

“We want a witch story!” my son yelled with his left hand on the book. “Okay, Dad. You can read now,” he ended, climbing back onto the bed and sitting criss-cross next to his sister. 

I paused for a moment and stared at him. 

Then I opened the book. 

There were words now. Entire paragraphs. 

I thought I had missed a section of the book, but at the same time I was quite certain I had gone through all its pages. I shrugged. 

“Okay, guys. Last one, then to bed.”

They nodded.

“Ready?” 

I began reading. 

“There once was a woman who lived on the slopes of dark and misty mountains. From time to time, villagers summoned the isolated woman by sacrificing one of their own. The younger the sacrifice, the quicker the woman arrived to the village. The villagers would call upon her for help. They called upon her to halt storms, plagues, diseases, and disasters. The villagers saw her as an evil savior. On one dreadful day, the village was invaded and ravaged by wild, rabid animals. People were torn apart and eaten, with livestock consumed alongside their owners. The villagers had no choice. They could not wait any longer, lest every single person bewas consumed. They needed the witch, and they needed her now and not a moment later. So, they had to sacrifice a chi—”

I slammed the book shut and tucked it under my armpit as I stood up. 

*What kind of story…* 

“Okay,” I said, “that’s enough. This is inappropriate for you guys.”

“Dad please! What happens?” Rachel whined. 

“I said no. Good night.” 

With my elbow to the kitchen island, I pinched my forehead as I flipped through the pages, which were blank again 

A knock at the front door. 

No one was there, but I felt as if someone had just left. As I’m halfway down the hall towards my children, there’s another, louder knock. I storm towards the front door and opened it again to no one. 

“Dad!”

I ran to my children’s bedroom and swung the door wide open, hitting it against the wall. “What? What is it?”

They were asleep. 

I scanned their bedroom before closing the door again. 

“What?” I said, turning around. I heard Julius whisper something. “Julius? Was that you? I thought you were sleeping.” 

I didn’t want to turn the bedroom light on and wake Rachel up, so I had to squint my eyes through the darkness to see my son. He sat up in his bed. 

“Dad,” he whispered, gesturing with his hand for me to come closer to him. 

“What is it?”

He paused, poking his head out to see the hallway behind me. I looked back at it too. 

“Dad,” he began, “she said we’re not safe here.”

“Who said that?”

He poked his tiny head from his bed again to look behind me and down the hallway, at the end of which is the front door of the house. 

“She said someone is coming for us,” he whispered. “And she said we can only stop her if we give her something.”

I’m sure that my face had turned whiter than that book when I heard that.  

There was another knock at the front door. 

“See!” Julius put his blanket over his head. “They’re here! Can we please ask her for help, Dad! Please!” 

“What’re you talking about, Julius? Call who for help?”

I knew who he was talking about, but I didn’t want to believe that this awful tale I read to my children was now our reality. 

But I wanted to live. 

I turned to the hallway. I eyed the front door as it shook at the banging. Then I looked back over my shoulder, at my son.

I knew what I had to do.
