COPE II: THE SILENT SOWING

“It is not the root that invades the earth. It is the earth that, in its weakness, invites it.”

Three weeks have passed since Mateo escaped from the depths.

He lives in the old family house, more isolated than ever. The land around his farm has changed. You no longer need to plant. The onions sprout on their own. They grow crooked, swollen, and when you cut them, some... bleed. At least he thinks so. At least that's what he sees.

The nights are more difficult. Mateo no longer dreams about what he saw down there. Now dream of what is to come. In his nightmares, the earth beats. Buildings collapse while colossal roots emerge from the asphalt and engulf people. Mateo walks among them, without fear, without pain. Like one of them.

But the worst is not in the dreams.

It's in the mirror.

His skin is rougher. It has started to peel around the neck. A kind of fibrous callus has grown on the back of his neck, like a root that refuses to die. When he scratches it, it smells like wet earth. Sometimes he feels that something moves under his flesh.

He visited a doctor in the town. They told him it was stress fungus, maybe some kind of dermatitis. But one of the doctors, a young foreigner, looked at him differently. He asked him only one question, in a low voice:

—Have you been close to them?

Mateo did not respond. He just left.

Days later, the young doctor disappeared. The hospital said he left without leaving notice. But Mateo found something strange: in his mailbox there was an envelope with no return address. Inside, a handwritten sheet with a phrase:

"The portals no longer open. Now they germinate."

Since then, strange news begins to appear on the radio and television:

•	⁠A school in Bolivia sank underground without a trace.
•	⁠Entire fields of corn in Kansas bloomed in the dead of night, covered in “eye-like flowers.”
•	⁠In Japan, a mountain tunnel collapsed and what they found underneath was not rock... it was plant meat.

Humanity does not know it yet, but the invasion will not be by assault. It will be by substitution. Silent. Natural.

Cépula does not attack. Cellula blooms.

And Mateo is the first harvest of the surface.

CHAPTER 2: TRANSFORMATION

Mateo tore a piece of skin off his shoulder. Not with pain, but with curiosity. Under the dermis were hidden whitish threads that pulsed like fine, living roots. He didn't bleed. Instead of blood, a thick liquid, between sap and pus, gushed out. He licked it without thinking.

It was sweet.

The changes were not just physical. He started to understand things. I could hear the voices beneath the earth. Whispers that spoke in forgotten languages. Trees that shook when they saw him pass. The flowers in his garden opened when he approached, as if they recognized him.

One day, his reflection was no longer the same. His left eye had an elongated pupil. The iris had darkened, like fertile soil. Sometimes, in the reflection of the water, he saw the Great Mother behind him: Cepula, colossal, contemplating him from the heavens... although he knew that she was still buried.

The news continued. Governments denying outbreaks, reports of "mass hallucinations" in rural areas, disappearances of entire towns in Siberia and Africa. Crops rotted, but at the same time new species began to grow. More resistant. More aggressive.

Mateo decided to get out of his isolation. He had to understand what was happening to him. He searched forums, networks, books. This is how he found a journalist: Anika Rössler, German, specialized in paranormal phenomena. She had seen it too. He had records of an identical case in 1871, where an entire village in Alsace was swallowed by the earth. They called it “the Green March.”

They quote. Anika travels. Upon arrival, Mateo can barely hide his transformation. But she doesn't run away. Record it. He studies it. Believe it.

And the worst: he admires him.

"Maybe you're not a victim, Mateo," she tells him as she caresses one of the roots that protrudes from his shoulder. Maybe you are the first step of a new humanity.

In the following weeks, more visitors arrive at the farm. Not out of curiosity, but out of faith. They are The Cult of the Bulb. They dress in tunics made of sacks and dried skin. Pieces of meat are torn off as an offering to the earth. They sing in the early mornings and drink a thick liquid that they extract from a black onion buried under the house.

One of them calls himself El Arraigado. He claims to be the first to hear Cépula's voice from the Andes, decades ago. Now his legs are fused with roots that he himself planted in his body. He doesn't walk anymore. They drag him like a prophet.

Mateo begins to lose his will. His thoughts are getting greener. Literally. When you close your eyes, you see infinite fields. When he sleeps, his fingers sink into the ground.

Cépula does not flower alone.

It needs gardeners.

And Mateo, without knowing it, has begun to sow.
