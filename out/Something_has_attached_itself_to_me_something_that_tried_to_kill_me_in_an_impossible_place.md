Moonlight shone through the dense, desolate forest, obscured by the fog just above my head.  Sloshing through the mud, I nearly tripped with each step.  My legs were an uncontrollable blur, as my body flew through the darkness.  My face stinging and red, blood dripping down it from the whips that were the low-hanging branches.  

The path was a narrow crack splitting the vast swath of trees.  By that point, I had forgotten what I was running from, or perhaps I never knew.  And if something was chasing me, I'd not have been able to hear it.  The only sound echoing through my ears was the inescapable pounding of my heart and the cold, cruel wind slapping my face.  But that didn't stop my mad dash on the dark, twisting path.

In my haste I failed to notice the large log that ran perpendicular to the path.  My shoe lodged itself in one of the log's rotted out holes, my leg snagging on the log momentarily, bones cracking as my foot slipped from my shoe.  I was still in the air, but quickly slammed into the ground.  Groaning and yelping, I tumbled down the path before hitting a tree, stopping me immediately.

I lay motionless in the mud, groaning slightly before rolling onto my back and spitting out the bloody mud in my mouth.  Normally I'd be absolutely disgusted by something so vile, but I hadn't the time for disgust.  I awkwardly drew myself up once more, adrenaline coursing through my veins like a potent elixir.  

My ankle had been badly hurt, but I was still able to hobble weakly down the path.  I knew I needed to escape, but I had no idea when the path would end.  It could be miles before it connected to civilization.  I wanted to yell for help, but something stopped me, something almost instinctual.  I still wasn't sure what was happening or where I was, but somehow I knew to stay quiet.

I hadn't gone back for my shoe, as it was a hundred feet back, and I wasn't too keen on backtracking.  Mud squelched between my toes with each sad limp I took.  My ribs sent radiating pains through me with each breath.  I sounded horrible, like some wheezing old man.  With such a slow pace, the low-hanging limbs no longer whipped my face.  I merely batted them out of my way weakly.  

Fog began thickening.  Before it had obscured the trees above, but now I could only see a few feet ahead.  Trees then began clacking together in the increasingly violent wind.  The low-hanging branches seemed to close in on me.  I thought it was an illusion or the wind at first, but I soon realized it wasn't.  

The thin, sickly branches began grasping at my throat and head.  I tore them from my head and throat, but they soon latched onto my arms.  I felt so weak in that moment, as branches cruelly encompassed my body like some wretched constrictor.  I struggled but couldn't break free; it seemed certain they'd overtake me.  With all my might, I threw my arm forward, branches snapping with the motion.  

I used my freed arm to begin ripping other branches from my body.  I wasn't sure how I was doing this, as the branches were thick enough to prohibit such an act, but they tore away with incredible ease.  Their bar-like strength turning to that of thread seemed impossible, but my questioning soon grew dormant as fear and panic sent me quickly hobbling away.      

I was so exhausted, so frightened and unsure.  I couldn't run anymore.  I collapsed to the ground, mud splashing me.  I panted, trying to catch my breath, but I couldn't.  With each gulp of air, I winced in pain.  It was so cold, so terribly cold and cruel.  

Without warning warmth began creeping in.  The fluidness of the mud then changed to a hard surface.  I hunched up from my fetal position and a new landscape filled me with dread.  I crouched in the middle of a large concrete slab with what looked to be desert all around.  The slab had strange symbols painted on it, each one distinct and robust.  Chunks of it were missing, and it had many long cracks.  My blood ran ice cold, despite the drastic change in temperature.  It was hot and dry, with air like a statue.  

At that point, I had no idea what to do.  Instinct no longer told me to run, and my mind hadn't the faintest clue either.  If my landscape could change at any moment, what point was there in fleeing?  That thought rang through my head for what seemed hours.  I screamed, hoping someone would hear, but nothing came out.  I knew I had screamed; I was sure I had, but I heard nothing. 

With no other options, I began walking out into the desert.  The sand felt hot on my bare foot, clinging to the mud encasing it.  I began to climb a tall sand dune.  I crawled on all fours up the steep dune, almost collapsing.  By the time I reached its top, I did just that.  I collapsed, letting the sand warm my battered body.  I wanted to fall asleep, but a shuffling nearby quickly dismissed that.  

I rose to my feet as quickly as my crippled body would permit.  My head turned to the left to see a figure dressed in black approaching me.  It wore a robe, with a hood concealing its face.  It was just mere feet away when it lifted that hood.  It was a man.  He had a perfect face with no wrinkles or inconsistencies.  His eyes were blank white, containing no pupils, and he was completely bald.  A single tattoo branded his forehead, looking eerily similar to those on the concrete slab. 

I was struck by fear by his abnormal appearance.  I wanted to ask who he was, but he soon lunged at me.  I pulled backwards, only managing to fall on my back and injure my ankle again.  He leaped on me, clawing at my eyes and trying to strangle me.  I kicked him off of me, causing him to fall to my side.  Without skipping a beat, he quickly unsheathed a dagger and lunged at me.   

He slashed at me, the blade slicing through my arm.  I screamed in agony, this time hearing it, and then rolled away from him.  He quickly caught me, slashing at my chest multiple times.  Pain shot through my whole body, as I flailed about screaming.  He jumped on top of me and began to plunge the blade down towards my head.  

In that moment, time seemed to slow down.  I stopped fighting, as fear had frozen me still.  It was so incredibly slow watching the blade plunge downwards, each second seeming like just a frame.  The blade reflected the moonlight, glimmering as it descended.  He made no noise or expression in that moment, he hadn't groaned or contorted his face before, and he didn't now.  

Just before the blade was going to plunge into my head, my eyes burst into a new reflection.  A ceiling.  Walls.  A bed.  I noticed these things, screaming, leaping out of the unknown bed.  My frantic, near-death mind soon shifted, and I recognized it as my own room.  Cuts burning like a thousand lashes didn't permit my mind a much due ease.  

I had one shoe on and one incredibly dirty foot with a broken ankle.  Muddy sand coated my body like a thick coat.  Getting out of bed, I grabbed my keys and raced towards the front door, my ankle not permitting swiftness.  In my haste, I didn't bother closing the front door as I fled to my car.  I needed to get to a hospital before my wounds bled too much.  

I jumped into the car, groaning in agony as I did, before pulling out of my driveway recklessly.  The hospital was only fifteen minutes away, but there were several times I thought I'd black out.  Once I got there, I didn't even bother parking.  I just rolled up near the entrance, got out, and began limping inside.  

Before I entered the door, some medical personnel grabbed me, helping me inside.  Blood soaked my chest and arms, eliciting shrieks from people in the waiting room.  The staff immediately put me on a stretcher and rolled me to a room just before I blacked out.

When I woke up, a nurse began to inform me of my state and asked me what happened.  The police were also there, as they needed to make a report.  They asked what happened, and I told them someone attacked me.  I knew I couldn't tell them it was in my dreams, so I said that all I remembered was someone attacking me.  I lied, telling them I forgot where I was.  I don't know if they believed me, but the nurse said it could be trauma-induced amnesia.  

After the nurse and police left me alone, I looked down on my right wrist in absolute horror.  There was a tattoo on it.  A tattoo just like the man from my dream had.  It was a circle with short lines jutting out at irregular intervals from its perimeter.  In the center were three smaller circles clustered perfectly together.  I almost shrieked, but instead I fainted.

I never mentioned the tattoo to the staff or police, I knew they'd put me in the psych section, and claim I had a psychotic break.  But I knew I hadn't gotten that tattoo, and I knew the wounds hadn't been inflicted anywhere other than that dream.  

That was three days ago.  I've been released and sent home.  I have a cast for my ankle, crutches, and many bandages covering my chest and arms.  My face and neck also have some bandages covering the scrapes and cuts.  I have barely gotten any sleep since this event, and any sleep I have gotten has been from short naps during the day.  I won't sleep at night, though I'm not sure it can't just reach me during the day.  

I've begun doubting myself, but I know I woke up with these wounds, and I have the hospital records to prove the wounds are real.  Not that I need records to prove their realness at this point.  They're very much real, very painful, and they won't heal quickly.  From the tattoo branding my wrist, I know it will return.  Or maybe that it is a part of me, maybe I am a part of it.  Some vessel for an unknown, cruel force.
