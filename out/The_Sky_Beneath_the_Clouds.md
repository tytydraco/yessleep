Yol had never feared the sky—until it started watching him.

It began quietly, in early autumn, when Oslo's evenings grew short and the clouds loomed lower, more still. Yol, 27, a software developer with a quiet passion for stargazing, first noticed it on a late walk home: the clouds above his apartment didn’t move.

Not a breeze. Not a drift. Just a heavy, suspended mass—gray and bloated—hanging above his building like something holding its breath.

The rest of the city had stars. His block had them.

Same position. Same shape. Every night.

Then came the sounds.

Not voices. Not exactly. More like murmurs laced with static, faint and underwater. Sometimes, when he closed his eyes, they almost resembled language. Almost. But not human. Never quite... right. He lived on the top floor, so there shouldn’t have been anything above.

And yet some nights, he heard something scrape across the ceiling.

One night, past 2 a.m., Yol climbed to the roof, flashlight in one hand, phone in the other. The air was unnaturally still. The clouds hovered maybe ten meters above, rippling inward like they were being sucked toward a central point.

Then they opened.

Silently.

They didn't part or blow away—they peeled back, layer by layer, like something pulling skin from fruit. And what lay beyond wasn’t sky.

It was a ceiling.

An impossible ceiling. Towering, curved, infinite.

Smooth, obsidian-black, but crawling with movement. Not mechanical. Not celestial. Organic. Like veins of ink slithering through stone, patterns pulsing in ways the eye couldn’t follow—geometry that bent inwards, and then sideways. Carvings that seemed to blink. Or breathe.

And from its surface—faces.

Countless faces, stretched across its darkness. Eyes closed. Mouths sealed. Some looked asleep. Some looked like they were screaming—on the inside.

And the worst part?

One of them looked like him.

Yol staggered back.

The clouds re-sealed.

His phone died in his hand. His ears wouldn’t stop ringing.

When he returned downstairs, nothing felt real. People moved like actors hitting marks. Smiles lasted too long. A barista poured coffee with a looping motion, over and over, until he blinked and she reset. Reflections in windows lagged half a second. He saw himself blink—twice.

He tried to report it. The meteorological office showed no clouds in the area. Clear skies.

But outside, they still hovered.

That night, he packed. He had to leave. He flung his door open—

And faced the cloud.

Not outside—inside.

It had poured into the hallway. Dense and alive, curling with limbs not made for human eyes. Shapes danced inside it—something ancient trying to pass through.

He backed into his apartment. Turned—

And there he was.

Another Yol. Or something wearing his skin. Its smile split too wide, and behind its eyes, darkness swirled—raw, endless void.

“You saw too much,” it said—without sound. “You slipped through the cracks.”

Yol tried to scream, but the air folded. The walls vanished. The world inverted.

And then—

Oblivion.

Two weeks later.

Oslo bustled under the clear autumn sun.

Tourists snapped photos. Trams rolled through their routes. The city breathed in sync.

No one noticed anything had changed.

Except a little girl on a school trip to the Opera House. She pointed at the sky.

“Mamma,” she said softly. “The clouds are upside down.”

Her mother chuckled, too distracted to look.

But the girl kept staring. Her mouth fell open.

Because the clouds above weren’t moving.

They were reflections.

Reflections of people’s faces, stretched across an invisible surface, staring down with hollow, vacant eyes.

Then something behind the reflection twitched. The image of the sky shimmered—like a glitch.

The illusion slipped.

Just for a second.

The girl saw a city.

Not Oslo.

The real city.

Dead. Silent. Cracked open like a model dollhouse. Streets frozen mid-motion. Shadows of people turned to ash. She saw her class standing still—frozen, eyes glassy, mouths mid-sentence. Their skin flickered like projection errors.

She looked at her own hand and saw it blur, repeat, flicker. Like it was being rendered.

A voice whispered—not from above, but from beneath her feet.

“You are the next one.”

She turned.

Her mother was still smiling. But not moving.

Then her face began to melt—dripping downward like a mask made of oil.

The girl opened her mouth to scream—

But found herself inside the sky, looking down.

Watching another version of herself point at the clouds.

Again.

And again.

And again.
