I never thought I'd be the kind of person who'd be afraid of my own apartment. It's stupid, I know. I'm a grown man, thirty-one years old, with a job and a routine. But these past few weeks, I've been living as if I'm not at home, but in some alien trap breathing down my neck.  
It all started with something small. I'd come home in the evening, put the key in the lock, and see the hallway light is on. Even though I clearly remember turning it off in the morning. I always do that. I have a habit of going through every room, turning everything off, and only then leaving. I even started taking pictures to make sure I wasn't going crazy. The photo shows the light off. But in the evening, the bulb is still on.  
At first, I thought it was some kind of malfunction. It's an old house, the wiring is faulty, nothing surprising. But the third time, I noticed the light bulb wasn't just turned on, but with a barely audible click, as if someone were pressing a switch. I know that sound well.  
I asked the neighbors if anyone had seen anyone break into my apartment. No one noticed anything. The lock wasn't scratched, the door was fine. I only have one key, no spare. But if it wasn't me or the neighbors, then who?  
A couple of days later, I found a spoon on the kitchen table. It was wet, as if it had just been rinsed. I'd been eating with a fork and hadn't taken the spoon out. That same evening, I came home and found the TV on. It was showing some children's cartoon, even though I don't even tune into that kind of channel. The remote was on the couch, but not exactly where I'd left it.  
I decided it was time to prove to myself that I wasn't going crazy. I set my phone on the shelf in the living room and set it to record all day. I left for work in the morning. In the evening, I sat down to watch. At first, nothing happened—just my empty room, daylight pouring in from the window, the clock on the wall showing noon. About twenty minutes later, the camera began to flicker slightly. At that moment, I heard a click. The light in the hallway turned on.  
And then I saw him. A silhouette appeared in the frame. Tall, hunched over, like a man too tall for my hallway. He stood and looked straight into the camera. I froze. He didn't move, only tilted his head to the side, as if he were looking at me through the screen. About a minute passed. Then he turned and slowly walked out of the frame.  
A few seconds later, the picture jerked, the phone fell to the floor, and the recording ended. When I got home, the phone was indeed lying on the floor. I had left it on a shelf, high and stable, where it would never have fallen on its own.  
I thought it might be some kind of hack, that someone was deliberately playing a trick on me. But who would go to such lengths for that? I have no enemies, no riches worth racking my brains for. I have an ordinary life.  
Today, something even worse happened. When I returned home, the light in the hallway was on again. But this time, on the floor near the door, there was a printed still from my video. I never printed photos from my phone. The paper was cold, as if it had just come out of the printer. The photo showed the same silhouette standing in my hallway. But his head wasn't turned toward the camera. He was looking straight at the front door. Right where I was standing now.  
I dropped the photo, rushed into the room, and checked all the closets, every corner. No one. But the light is still on. And I don't have the strength to turn it off.  
Now, as I write this, I look at the door. It seems to me that someone is standing behind it. I hear a quiet creak, as if footsteps were moving on the other side of the floor. I want to leave, but I know that if I go, everything will happen again tomorrow. I just don’t know if he will be waiting for me in the corridor or already inside.
