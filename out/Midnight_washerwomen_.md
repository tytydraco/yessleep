It’s 3:54 a.m., and once again, I hear the soft, rhythmic sound of scrubbing echoing through the stillness of the night. I live in a quiet neighborhood where nothing much happens, but for the past few weeks, I’ve been noticing something strange—something that doesn’t quite sit right with me.

Next door, there’s an old lady who seems to be washing clothes outside at odd hours. It started innocently enough; the first time I saw her, it was around 1 a.m. I happened to be up late, unable to sleep, when I glanced out my window and noticed her. She was hunched over a basin, her thin frame illuminated by the faint glow of a single, flickering bulb above her. She moved slowly, methodically, her hands scrubbing the clothes with a kind of tired determination. I thought it was odd at first—who washes clothes at that hour? But maybe she just couldn’t sleep, I reasoned. Maybe she preferred the solitude of night to do her chores.

But then it happened again. And again. Some nights, she’s out there as late as 3 a.m., tirelessly scrubbing away. The routine never changes—always the same movements, the same rhythm. The sound of water sloshing and clothes being wrung out has become a constant background noise in the early hours. It’s almost as if time stops for her in those moments, as if the world around her doesn’t exist. She’s completely absorbed in her task, seemingly unaware of the world outside her little circle of light.

It’s not just the timing that’s unsettling. What bothers me more is the way she moves—slow, deliberate, almost mechanical. There’s no rush, no urgency in her actions, just a steady, unyielding pace. It doesn’t seem like she’s doing it out of choice. Is her family forcing her to do this? I rarely see anyone else from the house, and I have no idea how many people live there. The house itself is always dark, except for the faint light where she washes. During the day, the curtains are always drawn, the front door firmly shut, as if they’re hiding something—or someone.

Sometimes, when she’s not washing, I catch glimpses of her just sitting on the bathroom floor, motionless. At first, I thought she might be resting, but why would she sleep on the bathroom floor in the middle of the night? Doesn't she have a bed? She sits there, head drooped forward, arms limp by her sides, as if she’s exhausted beyond words. It’s almost like she’s waiting for something—or someone. The stillness of her figure, coupled with the late hour, sends a chill down my spine every time I see her like that. 

I've thought about going over to ask if she’s okay, maybe even offer some help, but something holds me back. Something about the way she moves and the eerie silence that hangs over the house at night. It’s as if there’s an invisible barrier keeping me away, a silent warning to mind my own business. The way she sits there, so still, so lifeless, makes me wonder if she’s even alive—or if she’s just a ghost going through the motions of a life that ended long ago.

What’s going on next door? Why is she out there every night? Why do I feel like there’s something terribly wrong with this picture? Every night, I lie awake, listening to the sound of water splashing and clothes being scrubbed, and I can’t shake the feeling that I’m witnessing something I’m not supposed to see. The more I think about it, the more it haunts me. Why is she out there, night after night, performing this endless, repetitive task? And why does it feel like she’s trying to send a message—a message only I can hear?

A few nights ago, I tried to ignore it, to convince myself it was none of my business. I closed my curtains tightly, put on my headphones, and tried to drown out the noise. But even then, I could still hear it—the faint sound of scrubbing, like a whisper that wouldn’t go away. I could feel my heart racing, a sense of dread creeping up my spine. I didn’t dare look outside, but I knew she was there. She’s always there.

I’ve started to wonder about the family. I’ve never seen them, never heard them. It’s as if the old lady is the only one who exists in that house. I’ve tried asking around, but no one seems to know much about them. They moved in quietly, kept to themselves. Some say they’re a large family, others think it’s just the old lady and a caretaker. But one thing is clear—no one has ever really seen them. The more I ask, the more I realize how little I actually know about my own neighbors.

And yet, every night, she’s there. Washing. Scrubbing. Sitting. Waiting. I don’t know what to make of it anymore. Is it just a strange habit, or is there something more sinister at play? I’ve considered calling the authorities, but what would I say? “There’s an old lady washing clothes at night”? It sounds ridiculous. But the fear is real. The unease is real. 

Now, as I write this, it’s 4 a.m. and the sound is louder than ever. I can hear the water splashing, the clothes being wrung out. She’s out there again. I don’t know if I should keep watching or finally gather the courage to confront her. Part of me wants to know the truth, but another part is terrified of what I might find. What if I open that door, cross that invisible barrier, and step into a nightmare I can never escape from?

All I know is, I’m not sure how much longer I can take this. The sound, the sight, the mystery—it’s all getting to be too much. And yet, I can’t look away. I can’t stop listening. It’s like a spell, drawing me in deeper, night after night. I just hope, whatever the truth is, I’m ready for it. Because something tells me, once I find out, there’s no going back.
