The Dark Web. Just hearing those words makes people shiver. For most, it’s a shadowy corner of the internet that feels more like a myth than a reality. A place whispered about in the same way old fairy tales mention witches or haunted woods.

For me, it was never that scary. Honestly? It always seemed… boring. Overhyped.

I’d already read dozens of articles about it. People made it sound like a digital underworld crawling with hitmen, hackers, and human traffickers waiting around every corner. But when I finally installed Tor and went browsing, it was mostly what I expected: forums, pirated movies, shady marketplaces. Not exactly the nightmare my parents described.

My parents, though—God, they treated the Dark Web like a curse. My mom once told me, “If you even say those words out loud, someone will find you.” My dad was even worse. He was convinced that hackers would steal my soul the moment I clicked the wrong link.

I used to laugh at them. I even uninstalled Chrome and replaced it with Tor just to prove a point.

But I should’ve listened. I should’ve taken their paranoia seriously. Because if I had, Jared might still be alive.

It started on a Saturday night. I’d been drinking with Jared, my best friend since childhood. We’d gone to a few bars, played some pool, and reminisced about the dumb stuff we used to do in high school.

When I finally got home, I wasn’t ready to crash. I wanted the nostalgia to keep going. So I opened up Facebook, scrolling through old photos of me and Jared. One click led to another until I stumbled across something strange—a post buried deep in my feed.

It was an ancient-looking list titled: The Most Exciting Websites on the Dark Web.

Most of the links were dead, just strings of numbers and letters that didn’t load. But one stood out. It had no description, no comments, nothing to explain it. Just a single line of text:

MonsterCall143D1.

Something about it hooked me. I copied the address into Tor.

The page that loaded was almost empty. White text on a pure black background. No graphics, no ads, no loading bar. Just a banner across the top:

CALL YOUR MONSTERS.

I smirked. It looked like some edgy teenager’s idea of a scary website. But curiosity pushed me deeper.

There was one clickable option in the center of the page.

Order a Monster.


---

I clicked.

The site claimed I could “design my own monster” and have it “delivered” to an address of my choice. Same-day shipping. Ninety-nine dollars flat.

At first, I thought it was a prank service. Some guy in a cheap costume showing up at your friend’s house to scare them. Hell, it sounded kind of fun. Jared hated pranks, and he scared easily.

So I decided to mess with him.

The customization screen looked like a dark version of a character creator in a video game. Dropdown menus for size, limbs, abilities. Sliders for skin color, eye glow, claw length.

One section gave me choices for the mouth: fangs, broken teeth, no mouth, multiple mouths, or “too many teeth.”

That last one made me laugh, so I picked it.

I added bat-like wings, four arms, claws sharp enough to “tear through steel,” and eyes that “burned like fire.”

When I was done, I actually sat back in my chair, a little impressed. The monster I’d designed was ridiculous. Terrifying, sure—but in the way a haunted house animatronic is terrifying.

At the bottom of the form was a text box labeled: Leave a Message.

I thought for a moment and typed just one word:

Boo.

The instant I hit Submit, something happened that froze the smile on my face.

My webcam light turned on.

I stared at my laptop in shock. My own face appeared on the screen. They’d hacked my camera.

Red text flashed across the webpage:

PERFORM A RITUAL FOR US.

My mouth went dry.

Another box appeared beneath it:
“Enter the name of your target. Spill a little blood. Drink it.”

I almost closed the laptop right there. But I was buzzed, laughing, still half-convinced this was some kind of twisted roleplay gimmick.

So I went into the kitchen, pricked my thumb with a knife, sucked the blood, and typed Jared’s name.

Jared Mayhew.

The screen flickered.

ORDER COMPLETE. DELIVERY IN PROGRESS.

I laughed nervously. The prank had gone a little too far, but I still didn’t believe it was real. In my head, I imagined some actor in a monster suit knocking on Jared’s door tomorrow. He’d scream, his wife would probably yell at me, and I’d laugh my ass off.

But then, not five minutes later, the text changed again.

DELIVERY COMPLETE. STANDBY FOR RESULTS.

That didn’t make sense. No one could deliver anything that fast.

I shut my laptop and tried to shake it off.


---

My phone buzzed.

An email. From MonsterCall.

Subject line: ORDER DELIVERED. CLICK HERE TO VIEW RESULTS.

My heart pounded. How the hell did they even get my email?

Against my better judgment, I clicked.

A livestream opened.

It was Jared’s house.

My blood turned cold.

The camera crept down his hallway. Each step echoed. Whoever was holding it was inside.

I grabbed my phone and dialed Jared.

He picked up almost instantly.

“Bro,” he whispered, voice trembling. “Someone’s in my—”

The line cut.

On the screen, his bedroom curtains suddenly stained red. A woman screamed. Glass shattered.

The feed went black.

I sat there, paralyzed, my phone still in my hand. My stomach churned.

What the hell had I just done?
