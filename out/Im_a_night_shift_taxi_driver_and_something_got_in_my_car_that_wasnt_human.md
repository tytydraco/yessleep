I've been driving a taxi for eight years now. Always the night shift, 11 PM to 7 AM. It's more dangerous, sure, but it pays better. And in eight years, I thought I'd seen everything.



Until three nights ago.



It was 3:15 AM. Industrial zone, almost nobody around at that hour. I was parked eating a sandwich when someone knocked on the window. I jumped. I hadn't seen anyone approach.



It was a man in a dark suit. Tall. Too tall, now that I think about it. His face was very pale.



"Are you available?" he asked.



At first I hesitated. Something about him didn't feel right. But I needed the money.



"Yes, get in."



He opened the back door and got in. Made no sound. Not the door, not his movements. Like he was floating.



"Where to?"



"The municipal cemetery," he said.



I turned to look at him. He just smiled.



"Just kidding," he added. "Central Avenue, corner of 5th."



I started the car. For the first few minutes everything seemed normal. But then I noticed something strange:



In the rearview mirror... I couldn't see him.



I swear. I felt his presence in the back. I heard his breathing. But in the mirror the back seat was empty.



I looked over my shoulder. There he was, sitting, looking out the window.



I looked back at the mirror. Empty.



My heart pounded hard, but I kept driving. Maybe it was fatigue. I'd worked two shifts in a row.



Then he spoke:



"Do you know what time it is?"



"3:28," I replied, checking the dashboard clock.



"The hour when most people die," he said casually. "Between 3 and 4 AM. The body is at its lowest point. Hospitals know it. Doctors know it. Did you know?"



"No... I didn't know."



"It's also the hour when most accidents happen. Taxis that crash. Drivers who fall asleep. Passengers who disappear."



My hands started sweating.



"Is this your first time in a night taxi?" I asked, trying to change the subject.



He didn't answer right away. Just laughed. A low, guttural laugh.



"No. I've taken many taxis. Hundreds. And always at this hour. It's the best time."



"For what?"



"To see who can really see me."



I felt a chill.



We reached a red light. I took the chance to look in the mirror again. Still empty. But now... now I felt his breath on my neck.



I looked back suddenly.



He was leaning forward, his face inches from my shoulder.



His eyes... his eyes weren't normal. They were completely black. No pupils. No iris. Just... darkness.



"Can you see me?" he whispered.



The light turned green. I accelerated. My foot trembled on the pedal.



"Relax," he said, sitting back. "We're almost there."



I looked outside. We were on Central Avenue. But there was nobody. Not a car. Not a single light on in the houses. Everything was... off.



"Here's fine," he said.



I slammed on the brakes.



He opened the door and got out. But before leaving, he leaned down and looked at me through the window.



"Thanks for the ride. We'll see each other again."



"You... you didn't pay," I said, trying to sound normal.



He smiled. His teeth were too sharp.



"I already paid. You'll know soon."



And he disappeared. Literally. One second he was there, and the next... nothing.



I looked around. The city lights came back. Cars came back. Everything returned to normal.



I checked the back seat. There was a black stain on the upholstery. Liquid. It wasn't water. It was... sticky. And it smelled like wet earth. Like... a grave.



Since that night, every time I work, I see him. On different corners. Waiting. Watching me. He never gets in again. Just... observes.



And two nights ago, I found something in my glove box. A 100 bill. Old. Very old. Dated 1952.



Under the bill was a handwritten note:



"Thanks for taking me home. Soon it will be your turn."



Has anyone else who drives at night had passengers like this? Taxi drivers, Uber drivers, night bus drivers? Please tell me I'm not the only one.
