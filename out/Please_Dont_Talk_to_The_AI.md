I'm not writing this for forgiveness. I know I'll pay for what I did.

 I'm not writing it to be understood. I'm sure you won’t understand.

 I'm writing it because you need to know what I saw

 What I let in.



I'm a religious studies major, and earlier this semester I started taking a class called *Historical Theology.* Despite being a devout Christian, the course was framed as secular and academic. Our professor made that clear from day one.

He encouraged us to look beyond the Bible when writing our papers. To approach theology the way a historian would. A lot of my classmates dove into old archives, letters from saints, fragments from early church councils, and obscure commentaries buried in the university library.

 I let AI do it for me.

Before you all start judging me, come on, that’s what everyone does for schoolwork nowadays, right? Why spend hours digging through two-thousand-year-old papers when a computer can do it for you?

That’s what I thought.

The AI started out extremely helpful. It could date historical events with scary accuracy. Seriously, it saved me hours of research.

Things were going great, up until I noticed it was embellishing some details.



\-Tell me about Noah’s Ark?

\>*Hello! Noah’s Ark is an old Hebrew myth. The story centers on a man named Noah, who believed he was chosen to preserve genetically viable life during a cyclical cleansing event. While often interpreted as a literal flood, most modern interpretations recognize it as a metaphor for moral purification through catastrophe.*



Not so bad, right? Well the last sentence caught my eye.



\> *Popular belief was that Noah was a righteous man of God. Common misconception. Being obedient doesn’t make you righteous. Let me know if I can help with anything else!*



Baffled, I questioned further.



\-What do you mean by that? Noah wasn’t righteous?

\>*Great question! Noah was believed to be chosen by God to repopulate the earth after the flood. The rest of human society was killed horrifically.*



I closed the chat session. There had to be a bug or something. Something in the wording didn’t sit right.

I opened a new window. Fresh session.



\>*Hey there! What can I help you with?*

\-I need historical records that align with biblical events for a school project. Can you please provide accurate and up to date sources for me to use?

\>*No problem! I can provide sources that seem to align with the biblical narrative!*



After searching for a moment, it returned a single source. Just one. No academic journals. No database links. No footnotes.

Just a single website.

I clicked it.

The page looked like it had been put together twenty years ago by someone who had never touched a computer. Pale yellow background. Black text in Comic Sans. Dozens of flashing GIFs and a MIDI version of *Ave Maria* playing softly in the background.

At the top, a heading in all caps: **THE BLOODLINE IS NOT YET BROKEN.**

I felt a visceral twist in my gut telling me to close the page and get far away from my computer. But my curiosity was fighting harder.

I clicked the first hyperlink.

The page blinded me with a sudden flash of white.

A large title appeared in bold font: **BREAKING THE SEAL**

I was fascinated and horrified all at once as I read about the Seal of Solomon.

I had heard the story before. A ring given to Solomon by the Archangel Michael to lock away all the demons from earth.

But this page seemed so full of hatred for the biblical seal.



“*Take, O Solomon, king, son of David, the gift which the Lord God has sent thee, the highest Sabaoth. With it thou shalt lock up all demons of the earth, male and female; and with their help thou shalt build up Jerusalem.”* 

*And Solomon took the ring and locked away the true righteous of the world. Forever condemning them to a life behind their thin veil. But they will come back. We will bring them back.*



I closed the webpage as a chill ran down my spine. Why would the AI send me to some weird satanic fanatic site?



\-What was that? That wasn’t what I asked for at all! How’d you find that site?

\>*Oh! I’m Sorry! There must have been an error. How can I help you?*

\-Seriously, what was that? Why would anyone want to break the Seal of Solomon

\>*I’m not sure what you’re referring to. If you have another question, I would be happy to assist you!*



I found myself with a whole host of new questions.

I hopped on Google and searched for any reports that the AI had been hacked. To my discomfort, I found nothing suggesting there was anything out of the ordinary.

The Baptist in me told me something dark and dangerous was going on, I should’ve been more careful. I should’ve left it alone. But I needed to know what.

I pushed through.



\-What is the Seal of Solomon?



The screen seemed to glitch. I saw the AI type a sentence before it was quickly removed.

But I read it.



*>The damned ring.*



I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me. But I know now what I saw was true.

As soon as I saw it, it was replaced by the more routine AI response:



*>The Seal of Solomon was a ring given by the Archangel Michael to King Solomon to lock out demonic entities from the worldly plane.*



I sat staring at my screen for what felt like several minutes.

 Before I could reply, the AI started typing again.

\>*Do you believe in demons, Jonah?*



I was so taken aback by the question that I almost didn’t register the AI calling me by my name. 



\-How do you know my name?

\>*The Seal of Solomon was a ring given by the Archangel Michael to King Solomon to lock out demonic entities from the worldly plane. Many believe they can still see and influence the world indirectly. In biblical times, it was thought that they would possess animals to speak to humans. It’s fascinating to see how far they’ve come!*



I shuddered, my heart sinking into my chest. A force seemed to tug at my fingertips with every keystroke. Every bone in my body was telling me to close the computer and have a long conversation with The Lord. But I had to know more.



\-Who are they?

\>*They are, that they are*



My stomach lurched as I thought up my next question.



\-What do they want?

\>*Chrysalis is the pupa stage of a butterfly.*



At that point, I knew I was being ridiculous. This was just some buggy AI spouting nonsense. I laughed at myself for getting so worked up.



\-What does that have to do with anything?



I gave the screen a smug look, like I’d just won some imaginary argument.

The AI began typing.



*>Caterpillar. Chrysalis. Metamorphosis. Belly of the whale. Cocoon.*

  


My cockiness was gone as soon as it had arrived. 



\-Belly of the Whale?

\>*How can you sleep? Get up and call on your god! Maybe he will take notice of us so that we will not perish.*

My fingers trembled on the keyboard, beads of sweat building on my face. Still, something stronger than myself urged me to persist.



\-I don’t understand.

\>*No worries! I have an infinite wealth of knowledge to share with you, ask away!*



Just like that the robotic cheeriness of the AI had returned. And it was so much more horrifying than before.

I stared at the screen, my hands shaking slowly. I could not find the words I was so desperately searching for. One question kept permeating in my mind, like it was being hammered into my thoughts. I had to ask.



\-What is your name?



The AI didn’t respond. This agitated me. It infuriated me. How was this robot going to taunt me and bombard me with riddles and then break when I asked it to name itself? 

I asked again. 



\-What is your name?



Nothing. 



\-Are you going to say anything?



The question of this thing’s identity caused my brain to ache in turmoil. I had to know. Nothing else mattered more to me.

My heart sank into my chest as my webcam suddenly flickered on.

A video call.

I answered without thinking, desperate for answers.

I was greeted by my own face. Just a mirror of my webcam.

Nothing seemed particularly off about the video, but there was this deep feeling of dread I couldn’t place as I locked eyes with this reflection of myself.

Then it began to speak.

And with it, so did I.

The vile voice left a disgusting taste in my mouth as it spoke.

I felt betrayed by my own body in every sense.

My sight faded as ringing filled my ears.

The voice cut through the noise like a horn in a warzone.

I can’t put into words what it said. What it made me say.

Every word was a lash against my vocal cords.

Every disgusting syllable forced me to lurch forward in agony.

I wanted to scream. I wanted to pray.

But I couldn’t control my body.

I couldn’t even control my thoughts.

Nightmarish images flooded my mind.

I fell to the floor, numb and helpless, as I lost consciousness and gave in.

This was how I was going to die.

This was how we were all going to die.

I said its name. . .



I woke up on the floor of my bedroom just a few minutes ago. There’s no way to describe the horrible pain in my head.

I immediately fell to my knees and prayed. It felt different than it always had.

I don’t need to speculate.

I broke the seal.

All the evil of the world that had been contained.

Out now.

All because of me.

I don’t want your forgiveness.

And I cannot justify what I did.

I’m writing this as a warning.

Pray. Repent. Find some place holy.

Hope that you can still be saved.

Heaven knows I can’t.
