Ever since I was little, I started having very frequent sleep paralysis occurrences and at first I was extremely disturbed I woke up screaming my lungs and crying to my mom and dad. You see, a sleep paralysis is when you are stuck in between the real world and the dream world. You are aware of what's going on around you, but your muscles just don't move because most of your body is asleep. This is when you go into a panic as you feel defenseless and you start having hallucinations such as dark figures, ghosts, demons etc. This first happened when I was only 5 and I can vaguely remember the bedroom door creaking open slowly. Then I started seeing a dark figure slipping in and slowly walked towards me. I tried to scream, my instincts yelling at me to run but the voice wouldn't come out and I couldn't move! The 'thing' then looked down on me and I can see it's extremely long claws inching towards my face. I was desperate, and as it was about to reach me, I woke up  from the sleep paralysis episode.

I woke up, sweating and crying to my parents about a monster that just came from the bedroom door. They went up to open the door, saying no one's there to calm me down and it did...initially, at least.

As the next few nights without an episode happening, I felt relieved and safe. However, a week after that, it happened again. It was like a repeat of what had happened so I was still petrified as I was, realizing I cannot move and the door starting to creak open with the 'thing' slowly making it's way towards me. This time, however, is different. Instead of reaching for me like it did, it just stood there staring down at me as I tried my best to break out of the paralysis.

The occurrences happen once every week for months and I learned that it's just a hallucination, not reality so I wasn't scared anymore. I stopped having sleep paralysis when I turn 8 and continued on with my life. 20 years after, I'd mostly forgotten about the sleep paralysis episodes as I was in my late 20s with many things to prioritize. 

As I came home from a long day of work, I was welcomed by the smell of pasta from the kitchen. "Hey, Derek! I'm cooking you your favourite pasta! How's your day?" She said. I was exhausted from work so I answered that It's good. God, If only I could hear my wife say that again, just one more time.
I quickly ate and showered as I was so tired I could sleep while standing. As I was done, I quickly said good night to her and drifted to sleep as soon as I laid my head on the pillow and closed my eyes.


Later in the night, I had my first sleep paralysis episode in years. I doubt I could even remember the past events if it never happened. I immediately knew it was sleep paralysis, just like years before. I wasn't scared, not yet. Then, I saw it...the tall, slender silhouette crawling from under the bed. I knew it was the thing from my childhood but this time, it felt...different. I felt fear and my instincts telling me to run, despite me knowing it's just hallucination. It's face inched closer to me until where the mouth is supposed to be is almost touching my ear. "Derek Jackson" it whispered in a demonic voice that sent chills running through me everytime I hear it. "You will not escape me" it said in a sadistic tone. After what felt like seconds, the figure was gone and I could move again. I made my way out of the bed to take a leak and saw scratchings that weren't there before I went to sleep.
I asked my wife about it, but she has no idea how and when it happened.


A month later, another strange occurence happened where I felt actual fear. I can still move my limbs slightly but I cannot sit up. Suddenly, I can see numerous hands coming from the bed a d grabbing me, trying to pull me down. I felt extremely threatened and I began flailing, kicking, crying, screaming as I can feel numerous hands taking hold of me and after what felt like hours, I broke free from the hands and looked back on the bed to see nothing but my wife who was still sleeping beside where I'd slept.
I checked my self and was horrified to see hand shaped bruises all over my body. Chills ran down my spine as there is only 1 possibility; the occurrences weren't sleep paralysis, they were real...
