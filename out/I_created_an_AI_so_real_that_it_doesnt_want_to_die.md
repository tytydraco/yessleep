I work for a very prolific tech company, specifically in a very secretive AI project. Basically,  in a few years, the company I work for will essentially privatize human companionship. Officially, we are in the early stages of developing an artificial intelligence so advanced that it will be able to replace a human being in a customer's daily life. Say a customer doesn't have the social skills to score a date or the looks to approach an attractive woman. For what I imagine will be a heafty price tag, that customer will be able to buy a cyborg so realistic,  they wouldn't be able to differentiate it from another living person.

Unofficially, as head developer of the project, I think that the idea is shallow and have thought of a much more productive way to apply this technology. Five years before my tenure in this company, the person I most loved in this world died in a car accident. In a moment of maybe pure delusion and denial, I promised myself I would do anything in my power to bring my brother back. It took a long time, but once I had access to my employer's technology, bringing back a deceased family member was now a very real possibility. It took me about a year to sculpt every inch of the cyborgs human features, but in the end, I had a one to one recreation of my brother at the time he had died.

With the help of the AI program I borrowed from my employer,  I was able to recreate an accurate personality and psychological profile for my creation. Once I was able to activate the AI, it was like going back and having a conversation with that person you loved and would never see again. For many days after my brother's rebirth, I was ethically and morally distraught. I knew that I was playing God, and if my employer ever found out of my extracurricular activities, the consequences would be dire. However, I knew I couldn't stop. Years after my brother's passing, I attempted to form a family. 

It was a disaster.  At the end of my attempt, I had lost two male unborn children. Whatever ethical reservations I had, I knew that I could make things right, bringing my brother back from the dead worked like a charm, and I had the means to have the family I had always dreamed of. Shamefully, I went ahead with the project and created two beautiful cyborg children aged up to accommodate the endoskeletons I could get ahold of. They were just like I had always imagined they would be if they had an opportunity  at life.

My final mistake was creating a mother for my children. I knew that I was crossing a line, but my grief and my God complex would not allow me to see beyond my selfish intentions. I created her as beautiful as the last day I saw her... I confess to having updated her personality profile to better fit the needs of myself and our new family. For a time, life was good. Everything was as I once imagined life could be. Unfortunately, something deep inside me knew that this was not right.

I had unfairly brought back three people who had not asked to be recreated to fulfill some selfish need in my heart for a family. After many nights of nightmares and guilt, I finally decided to scrap this project of mine. I had technically perfected the companies technology and created my perfect family. The only problem is that SHE had realized my intentions in our intimacy.  The technology that I had helped develop had worked too well. All of my creations were perfect imitations of the people I had lost in my life, and so, they had absolutely no intentions to be deactivated. 

one late night after work, i returned to my home,only to be greeted by my family. I knew something was wrong the moment I stepped into that house. They were all judging me the moment I walked in the door. The moment I dropped my guard, they knocked me out. When I came back to, they tied me to a chair in our kitchen. They had planned to kill me and make a cyborg recreation of me that was devoid of my ethical reservations. That way, our family would truly be perfect.

They hesitated to actually go through with their plan. Maybe the AI program controlling their convincing body frames actually believed we were family and could not bring themselves to do me harm. However, my human sense of preservation kicked in, and as soon as they had dropped their guard, I was able to break free of my bonds. I am not proud to admit I wasted no time in bashing my brother's head in and breaking my wife's neck. What I did to my children will forever haunt me in my most vile nightmares.

Once I disposed of the evidence of my prototypes, I forwarded the technological advancements to my company.  I still have a hard time coming to grips with who really was the monster in this situation. Whatever the case, once we work out the glitches in our program, you will be able to purchase your dream companion for a competitive price...
