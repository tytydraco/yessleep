Yesterday, an odd video was broadcasted on our local news channel. We live in a small town in the UK, so this video hasn't been getting too much attention. But it bothered me. In the video, a man who looked to be in his 40s was standing on a street corner, shouting into a megaphone. His face was light red. His eyes were watery.


"Everybody! Please listen! Please just listen! They're going to get me! My family was taken from me and I don't have anywhere to go! They feed people to... things... monstrous things!"


During his outburst, a SWAT car with three soldiers hanging on to each side pulled up beside him. The soldiers hopped off of the car and told him to come with them.


The man then said something along the lines of, "Get away from me you pieces of trash!"


His outburst was alarming, but what he was talking about? What were the things? Why was he going to be fed to them? It was concerning to the point where I wanted to look into it. I had never heard of anything like it before. If the man was speaking the truth, then something atrocious is going on. On the other hand, it could've been a prank. But why would they need to bring in a SWAT truck and men in camo?


I was just as intrigued about the situation as much as I was concerned about the man, so I did some Googling for news articles about the outburst. Especially so I could read the comments for second opinions. For some reason, I couldn't find anything. I went to our local news website. It was down. Without much to go off of, I planned on heading out to the spot the outburst took place. It probably wouldn't amount to much, but knowing it was the spot the outburst took place would inspire me to think a bit deeper.


The next day, or more specifically around an hour ago, I walked over to the spot. It was only five minutes away, so it wasn't an exhausting walk. I stood at the street corner and just thought to myself. I couldn't stop. What happened to that man? Why was he detained by soldiers? Were there any clues I could follow?


Around the 10 minute mark of me being deep in thought, an elderly man walked up to me.


"Are you waiting for somebody?" he asked.


"No, I'm just… trying to think," I said.


"There's nothing to follow," the man said.


"What are you talking about?" I asked.


"That guy who was speaking into the megaphone is gone," he said. "There's no one to look for."


He caught on to what I was doing. But of course he did. The whole town had seen the video. I probably wasn't the first person to come to the spot the panicked man was standing at.


"How many others did you see here?" I asked.


"Seven," he said. "Every few hours, somebody would come here and look around and… clearly they'd be thinking to themselves, staring off into nothingness, hoping they'd find something in nothing. Now go back home."


It was a bit pushy for some random stranger to be telling me to go home. I told him I enjoy late night walks, then all he said was, "Well, alright then. That's fair," then he walked away in the direction he came from.


After a few more minutes of thinking, I started making my way back home. While humming to myself, I turned a corner. Out of the corner of my left eye, I saw the old man who had just spoken to me. He was a few meters down the street. I thought of it as a coincidence and kept walking. I looked back and saw him turn onto the street I was on.


Still… probably a coincidence, right?


After some more turns, and the old man making the same turns, I realized he was following me. I did the usual and tried to walk around town at random to shake him, but he made the same turn every time.


I walked through downtown, where it was easy to confuse me as literally any of the others I walked by. And there were at least ten people. Two people were walking along the side of the street I wasn't on, so I thought I had a chance.


A couple blocks down the main road, I stepped onto a road that led me back into the suburbs. I wasn't so familiar with it. My heart was pounding as I walked down the eerie street, hoping to god the man wasn't somewhere behind me. I glanced back and saw the two people I had seen walking on the opposite side of the main road. They were a few homes behind me.


I gasped. My heart sunk to the bottom of my chest. I didn't care about finding out what they wanted from me. Instead, I called the police as I continued on along the sidewalk. Another minute later, I took a left turn onto yet another unfamiliar road. As I walked along the sidewalk, the silhouette of a man wearing baggy clothing jumped out from a bush not too far away from me. I jumped and froze in one spot. The man pulled out an envelope and handed it to me.


"Who are you?" I said in a shaky tone.


The man held the envelope up to my face. Instinctively, I took it and sprinted ahead of him. Halfway down the road, a distant gunshot rang out. I picked up my pace, wishing I had never bothered trying to figure out what happened to the man with the megaphone. This was getting too creepy for me. I never thought standing on a street corner would inspire this much trouble.


Once I arrived home, I locked all my doors like usual, then I shut all my blinds. In a room I'm not going to disclose, I opened the envelope. I was hoping it had evidence to use against the creeps. There was a folded sheet of paper. I pulled it out and unfolded it. There was a statement at the top.


"Anything you witness… film it, take photos, whatever, and send it to any one of these email addresses. Do not post it on the internet unless there's no way you expect to live to send it yourself and you can capture it on a livestream with the hope somebody will take it seriously enough."


Below the statement was a spreadsheet list of street and email addresses. Some of the addresses were in Siena, Italy, Aurora, Ontario, Canada, and Olinda, Brazil for example. Just multiple places around the world. As I looked over the list, there were three loud knocks on the front door. My heart sank. I shut the lamp off and found a place to duck.


I heard the crash of my front door. Now I hear footsteps. Hopefully I'll get to see the morning.
