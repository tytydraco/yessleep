It started about a month ago. Some genius thought that we should have a lecture on one of the weekends. At least it was for only once, but it still meant I had to waste two days bored out of my mind, while the boring professor talked about the even more boring subject, and couldn’t go home. On top of that, it lasted nearly the whole day, so it was around 6 P.M. and already dark when I got back to the dorm.

I put my jacket in the closet, dropped my bag on the floor, then sat down for a while to watch some videos. University is rough, I know. After I passed some time, I checked on my plant cuttings on the windowsill to see how the roots were forming, then fed Cupcake, my tarantula. The dorm doesn’t allow any big animals. Of course, this doesn’t stop many of the students from bringing in cats and small dogs, but I like to play by the rules. Plus, Cupcake can make the scheduled room inspections go a lot faster. While she ate the unfortunate cricket, I started to prepare my own dinner.

And that’s when I first heard it. Something was knocking on the window. At first, I tried to convince myself that it was just the guys above us doing something. They have a habit of sounding like a stampede of elephants. I mean, who the hell would knock on a fourth-floor window? But the sounds just wouldn’t go away. Slow, deliberate tapping. I noticed that Cupcake retreated into her hole. That was weird. She’s pretty used to the sounds of the dorm, and usually liked to sit out by the door of her terrarium and ponder for a while after her dinner.

In the meantime, I finished preparing my meal, and sat down to eat. The knocks got louder. Maybe someone’s at the door. I thought. But who the fuck would keep knocking for like ten minutes? Did Tyler lock himself out somehow? He was my roommate, and although I didn’t know him for long, we got along great. I didn’t think he would be the kind of guy to forget his keys, but you never know. So, I opened the door. Nobody. Of course.

Well, I can’t deny it. Time to check the windows. I pulled the curtains open, half expecting something like the raven of Edgar Allan Poe, staring at me with black button eyes at this point. There was nothing. But the sound didn’t stop. I put my ear to the glass. It definitely sounded like the tapping was coming from there. As I was listening, the sound suddenly stopped.

I waited for some time, but ultimately sat down at my desk to eat my dinner, as nothing else happened. Tyler arrived not long after the incident. We chatted for a bit, then I asked him.

“Did you hear knocking from the window before?”

“Um, no? You know we’re on the fourth floor, right?”

I could see by his grin that he thought I was messing with him.

“I’m serious. There was a noise.”

“Maybe another horserace above us?”

“No. It was coming from the window. I’m sure.”

“Maybe the sudden cold. It’s freezing outside. The frames could be adjusting.”

“Yeah.”

That sounded like a reasonable explanation, and I could see the ‘great, my roommate is either a crackhead or a psycho’ expression forming, so I left it at that.

The next morning, as Ty went to open the window for a bit of fresh air, he chuckled.

“Did you notice this before? Some idiot carved ‘nevermore’ into the frame!”

I chuckled as well, thinking of the ominous academy in a certain show. Why would someone compare the uni to it? Then I remembered what I was thinking last night, before I opened the curtains, and the joke suddenly seemed a lot less funny.

After this, nothing happened for a few days, and I mostly forgot about the knocking, writing it off as a product of my sometimes overly active imagination. Until it occurred again.

The day passed as usual. In the evening, Tyler was watching something, and I worked on an assignment, when the knocking began again.

“Listen. There it is again.”

“What?” the moment Ty pulled off his headphones, everything went silent.

“Eh, nothing.”

He looked at me weird, then put the headphones back on. The moment they were on, the sound started again. I didn’t know what could I do, so I put on my own headphones and started some music. This was until Ty suddenly turned off the video and pulled off the headphones again. As he stood up, he froze, then turned to me wide-eyed.

“What the hell?”

I stopped the music. The knocking didn’t go away this time.

“Told you.”

He raced to the window, and practically tore the curtains open. Apart from the flickering street lamp down the street, nothing was there.

We stared at the window, and not long after, the knocking stopped. Neither of us said anything. The next morning, I approached the curtains like I was trying to sneak up on a sleeping tiger. There was nothing. I let out a loud sigh.

The next night was silent. After that, a few, quick taps. Ty opened the curtains on the following morning, and as he looked out, he stopped, then opened the window, grabbed a towel, and carefully grabbed the body of the little sparrow.

“He probably flew into the window.”

“Yeah. Poor thing.”

That afternoon, we buried the bird in the park beside the dorm. I noticed the new message after we got back into our room. Carved right under ‘nevermore’. ‘Peek-a-boo’. We didn’t dare to open the curtains that night, even though the knocking was more like a banging this time, so strong that it sounded like the windows will break at any moment.

The sound returned more and more frequently in the following days. We spoke less with Ty. Neither of us wanted to mention the sounds, but there was hardly anything else on our mind. Cupcake stopped eating almost completely, and even when I managed to feed her, she snatched the cricket right from the feeding tongs and immediately retreated into her hole. I also noticed more and more leaves dying on my plants.

Then, one night, three days after the ‘Peek-a-boo’ message appeared, I opened the curtains at night. I don’t remember why. And I don’t know if there was any knocking before. By that point, we grew indifferent to it.

First, I saw the hands. They had too many fingers on them, all bending in wrong ways and yet ending up tapping on the glass. Then the creature pulled up itself, and stared at me. Its skin was a sickly grey color, flesh rotting off the body at some places. Mold was growing on its thin, elongated body, forming patches of green on the grey. At first, I thought it doesn’t have eyes, because the giant mouth forming a toothy grin covered most of the face. Its rotting teeth looked disturbingly human, apart from two tusks pushing out from the lower jaw, creating the look of some really fucked up pig. But as I was processing the tusks, I noticed two black dots on the place where its chin should have been.

After I processed the sight, I fell backwards, screaming my lungs out. Ty jumped from his bed, and as he ran towards me, he looked at the window, and tripped as well. The creature stared at us silently. No knocking, nothing. It put one of its moldy hands on the window, then pressed its horrible face to the glass, tusks grinding on the surface with a horrible sound, like the most fucked up kid in the world.

Time seemed to stop, as we laid on the ground, unable to move from the horror, while the creature watched. After what felt like hours, it just…disappeared. Not climbing off or anything, it was just not there suddenly. We looked at each other with Ty.

“We need to do something.”

“But what?”

“I don’t know, call a priest, burn the whole place down, tell the janitor, anything.”

“We’ll figure something out. Check if you can find anything online.”

At the end, both of us spent the rest of the night looking for information, but when the Sun rose, we still didn’t have anything more than some shitty creepypastas.

That was tree days ago. Yesterday, I found Cupcake curled up in her hole, dead. She was not an old spider, and wasn’t even molting, which usually the main cause sudden death. I buried her under an oak tree in a nearby forest. My plant cuttings are all dead as well, dried like I put them in the oven, despite sitting in water.

The reason I’m writing this is because we still have no solution. We can’t switch rooms, nor do we have the money to rent our own place. And today, a new message appeared. Its only is one word, like the previous ones: ‘Tonight’. There are only a few hours left before sunset.
