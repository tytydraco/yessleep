[I stepped](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/duplicates/1bdkaxr/my_wife_believes_there_is_something_in_our_closet/) past the old woman, intent on shutting the door before whoever or whatever could enter. As soon as I moved, I could feel her grip tighten, bony fingers digging like claws into my shoulder.  
  
Turning to face her, I met a wild-eyed sort of desperation. She hurried to stand in front of me again, and immediately I knew I'd made a mistake entering.   
  
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” she muttered, repeating the phrase like some broken record - arms outstretched, stepping towards me as though to herd me away from the door.   
  
“You can’t go, he told me you must stay! You must!”  
  
I had no intention of hurting the woman, but I had just as little intent on being kept in this place waiting for…whatever stalked through those halls to corner me in this dingy bedroom.  
  
I sped past the woman, hoping to dash to the doorway but as soon as I’d made my way past I could feel those clawing hands again, digging into my shoulder and arm as she gripped with every bit of strength it seemed her failing body could muster.   
  
I hadn’t expected it, and in my haste, pulled her off balance. I twirled in an attempt to catch her, my mind instantly swerving from any thoughts of escape to avoiding a manslaughter charge and the two of us landed on the floor in a painful heap. I could smell that awful mix of sweat and what seemed like stale urine thick on her skin, making my stomach twist and protest as I struggled to free myself from beneath her.  
  
“Get off!” I grunted, prying the woman’s hands free with one hand as I used the other to push her off of me, sliding from beneath her and struggling to find my feet.  
  
“Oh, please! Please!” she crawled forward frantically, hands wrapping around my leg as she fought to pull me closer.  
  
“You’ve got to -”  
  
Another long pronounced cry of the floorboards, from somewhere behind me, made my stomach sink.   
  
I could feel the room somehow grow colder, something I’d have thought impossible before, as though there had been a window opened directly behind me, a gnawing breeze rolling along my back. Every hair along my spine rose to attention, as I struggled with the decision to face what I knew I would find behind me.  
  
I had no choice. There was one way out that didn’t involve a dive from a second-story window. I turned to face the doorway.   
  
Darkness filled its threshold like a physical form, cold, obsidian, nothingness yawning forth as if to swallow us whole. For the faintest of seconds, it appeared empty, a thought that was only vaguely comforting with the unshakeable sensation that I was being watched. Then I saw them.   
  
Twin gems of sapphire and emerald, burning as though the very flames of hell glowed behind them - floating in the nothingness like awful stars.  
  
It took only a moment longer to make out the suggestion of a form, somehow darker than the pitch-black that surrounded it, gazing in at us with impossible eyes.   
  
“Oh, Anson, Anson, I kept him here, like you asked. Oh, the poor boy is so confused darling tell him, tell him all the wonderful things you’ve told me.”   
  
I turned to see that Mrs. Aldridge was on her knees, hands clasped in front of her as though in some twisted sort of prayer to something I knew was far from any god worthy of worship.  
  
It all clicked in an instant. Of course, I’d seen no sign of the woman’s husband. He was likely dead, or missing just as my own wife was. Of course, Mrs. Aldridge was clearly unwell, her mind long since having wavered and given way beneath the weight of age and disease, or the impossibility of the knowledge she found her and her husband faced with.  
  
Of course, it had tricked her. All she’d wanted was for her husband to return, and something had convinced her he had. I faced the horror before me, feeling a numbness in substitution of bravery, as though my nerves had burned themselves out from all the day's terror. I needed only to know.   
  
“Where is she?” I asked, “Where is my wife?”  
  
Its head cocked in the darkness, visible only by the motion of those twin eyes, glowing with such brightness it was beginning to make my head pound.   
  
The sound it made was like a glacier cracking, a gasp, long and drawn out and impossibly deep, as though all the world's dead things had exhaled their final breath in unison.  
  
“*We have shown you. Where the fire never glows, and the beating of mothers' hearts over open chests are the only warmth for the children.*”  
  
The corners of my vision began to dance with dark shapes, my head swimming as though I’d gone underwater and it had been too long since I’d been up for air. I stumbled slightly, catching my balance and straightening, unwilling to show any give in the face of this thing.   
  
I was grasping in the darkness for answers, but something in me said that if there was any sort of hierarchy to these creatures, the one that stood before me was near the top of the pyramid. From it seemed to pour a sort of ancientness I couldn’t comprehend, like being made to stand before the sun, and it spoke with just as much terrible wisdom. It was like a living element, freezing wind seeming to pour forth through the doorway as though reality itself was struggling to adjust to its being.   
  
I wanted to move, but I felt trapped under its gaze, my body unresponsive as though my thoughts were distant suggestions.   
  
I have to go. I thought, the thoughts coming a mile a minute. I have to get back to my house, to the doorway, to Janice.  
  
It was all I could think, and yet somehow I knew the longer I dwelled in that thing's presence, I risked never seeing my home again and falling into those eyes that burned with memories of unknowable things and nightmares older than mankind.  
  
“*They opened the doors for us, summoned us with a beacon across the darkness, and we shall answer the call.*”  
  
“*Have you seen them, child?*”  
  
The voice that boomed through the doorway was impossible, ancient, and all-encompassing, the sound of the old dead forests and all of their secrets, the whispers of the grave we desperately ignore in the late hours.   
  
“*Have you seen the children of the cold? Have you held them close? Warmed them beneath the fires of your beating heart?*”  
  
It was a whisper, hardly more than a breath. It was a booming command beaming from the horns that signal the end of days.   
  
It gnawed at my mind with an impossible itch, until I could feel the very threads of my sanity coming apart at the seams. I wanted to shriek until my throat was raw and the iron taste of blood filled my mouth. I wanted to run. I wanted to go through the doorway. I wanted to pass out, or die, or, or, I wanted to help them…I wanted to be anywhere else but there, and yet the weight of the moment pressed me down like all the world's gravity.   
  
“*A babe - lost in the storm, of course, it can only wander home. To the hungry flames that will feed on its skin amidst the frost.*”  
  
I could feel it in my head. It was an awful foreign sensation, its eyes seemingly digging through my mind like a surgeon, plucking and weaving as it saw fit.   
  
The sudden scramble of motion at my feet snapped me back to attention, as I turned to see Mrs. Aldridge. She was in tears but wore a smile somehow almost as horrific as the thing in the darkness.   
  
She hadn’t even bothered to rise to her feet, crawling towards the thing babbling apologies and words of praise like a child expecting a scolding from her god. I was grateful for the moment of lucidity it granted me, snapping me from the creature's spell long enough for a singular thought to crystallize - I had to go.   
  
The darkness seemed to spill over the doorway as she approached, and I could see the immediate confusion in her expression amidst the madness. I stumbled back as I watched the nothingness, like streams of running water stretch across the wooden floorboards, leaving behind in their wake veritable sheets of darkness, like cloth. The lights in the room flickered.   
  
My heart froze, and again, the floorboards creaked as the thing that wasn’t Anson stepped into the room, plunging us into darkness.   
  
I could think of nothing else to do, panic searing through me as my eyes searched desperately failing me in the darkness. I ran. I could feel my shoulder collide with the wall, a dull crack audible in my ears followed by a searing pain, but I didn’t stop following the wall until I reached the doorway. I could feel it, hardly inches away, like a living block of ice and stone.   
  
“Anson? Anson my love, I - I’ve done everything. Everything you said, please…”  
  
I could hear Mrs. Aldridge’s voice, shrill and panicked and pleading, from somewhere behind me. It didn’t matter, nothing mattered besides escape. As I felt the doorway, I allowed myself the faintest moment of hope.  
  
Then I felt it. The skin of my bare arm brushed against it, and in an instant, it was as though all of the blood had been drained from the limb. Its skin was cold and dead and wet like a corpse in the snow, and at that moment it felt as though something had been stolen from me.   
  
Pins and needles danced through my arm, as I fell out and into the hallway, turning for only a moment to face the creature as I grabbed my arm instinctively.  
  
I could see that its head was turned, those glowing eyes fixed on me, and somehow, I was certain that I could feel a smile beneath them, as cold and dead as it had felt.  
  
That was all it took to push me forth again, using my hands to guide my mad dash out of the house, nearly losing my balance several times on the stairs. I didn’t stop running until I’d reached the front door, turning only to glance back down the hallway, at the closet door I’d seen that morning. It was wide open.  
  
A shriek tore through the night air, the sort I’d only ever heard in movies before, or videos on the internet that I tried hard to forget, the sort that meant death.  
  
Mrs. Aldrige’s, no doubt. It was long and shrill and seemed to go on for far too long, echoing after me as I ran out of the house and to my van. I paused only long enough to unlock the vehicle, peering up into the window that would belong to Mrs. Aldridge's bedroom as I pulled myself inside.  
  
I could see something behind the dust-laden glass. Illuminated only by the faint moonlight breaking through the clouds ahead. For a moment, it seemed Mrs. Aldridge stood in the window, gazing back at me with an expression I couldn’t comprehend, but as my car sprang to life, eyes never once wavering from that window, I quickly realized I was wrong.  
  
It wasn’t Mrs. Aldridge, any more than the thing in my home had been my wife. Her jaw hung impossibly wide, and slack at one side, her nose pressed closely to her face as though she’d been dealt a devastating blow.   
  
And despite it all, she smiled.   
  
It was a broken, unfitting expression on that face, and I knew it wasn’t hers at all. The skin fit wrong, and her eyes… they glowed like gems forged in hellfire.  
  
I breathed a whispered apology to the late Mrs. Aldridge, though I doubted there was anything I could do. With the devil watching, I made my way down the road out of the cul de sac, and towards my house.   
  
I felt like a wrung-out towel, drained of all energy and capability of thought, driving only on autopilot. It wasn’t until I’d rounded the corner of my neighborhood that the implications of what I’d seen occurred to me.  
  
She had screamed. She had screamed, and it wore her skin. I felt my foot grow heavy on the gas pedal, the roar of the engine inviting me forth as I watched the treeline of the forest at the end of our street grow nearer. She was dead. Mrs. Aldridge was dead, and it wore her skin.   
  
It would be so simple, so quick. I could feel my foot practically pressing against the floor of the car as it barrelled forth. It had worn my Janice’s skin, and she was dead.   
  
I hardly recognized the scream filling the car as my own, but it had snapped me back to sanity enough to make me slam down on the brake. The car shrieked forward in a jerking skid, yet somehow I felt like the world had gone motionless.   
  
I knew there was a possibility I was wrong. I had no idea as to how these things worked, of course, perhaps my wife was still alive, somewhere in a world devoid of warmth, where the snow never ceased.  
  
“Hell frozen over.”  
  
There was no joke, but I laughed, laughed until I cried. And then I wrote this.   
  
I’m sitting in my car at the end of my street. I’m going to finish this and post it to every fucking social media I’ve got. It won’t do me any good now, and I doubt it’ll do much for Janice, but at the very least, I’ll make sure this gets out - that someone out there knows what happened to us. I love my wife, despite whatever secrets she may have kept, which I doubt I’ll have the answer to now.   
  
But maybe one of you will. It doesn’t matter now. I’m going home. I’m going to kill or be killed by, that thing wearing my wife’s skin. And if it's the latter, I’m going to open that closet door and I think I know what I’ll find. The entryway to another world. I’m going to look for my wife now or die trying.   
  
I don’t know how to end something like this. So, goodbye for now. Hopefully, I’ll be able to update you all if I somehow manage to get through and back from the other side.  
  
And Janice, if you’re reading this - I love you, I love you now and past the moment of my last breath, and I will follow you into hell.  
  
*There were no following messages found on the cellphone of Calvin Rodgers.*   
  
*The work vehicle mentioned was located by the police after being reported by a neighbor, who found it at the end of the street, driver-side door ajar, with a cell phone on the driver’s seat. The company the van belongs to denies any reports of anyone by that name having worked there and grew quite hostile at repeated questioning.*  
  
*How this is possible given there are, apparently, no records of Calvin Rodgers, remains to be seen. A death record has been located for an Elmira Aldridge, with the cause unlisted - unusual given the nature of the record.  As of yet, no records have been found leading back to a Project Doorway, a military institute at Redbrook, or collaboration with the local university.*
