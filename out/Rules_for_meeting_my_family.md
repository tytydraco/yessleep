I see you're meeting my family! I have just a few rules for your safety. Follow them and you will he 100% safe. Fail to follow them, and you will be put through unimaginable pain and torture. Read these THOROUGHLY, for if you don't, you will not be coming back to my house, and that could be for many reasons. 

Rule #1. Please wipe your shoes off on the outside mat! Mother doesn't like it when dirt is tracked into the house. She will immediately kick you out and cause immense bad luck to come your way. If she does, message me. I can give you the counter-curse.

Rule #2. Greet EVERYONE. The cats, my parents, siblings, and even those you cannot see. They don't like being unaddressed. If they go unaddressed, they will take you to the basement. I've never seen what happens in the basement, but I know it isn't good.

Rule #2 a. While you must say hello to them, NEVER make eye contact. They get freaked out when you make eye contact with them, and if they get freaked out, I can't save you from what they may do. Thankfully, people have listened to this rule, don't be the first one to disobey and add on to this rule.

Rule #3. TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF as soon as you get inside. You can have socks on, but NEVER shoes. Father will feel very insulted because leaving your shoes on will make him think you feel unwelcome. He will guide them to you and they will show you the most disgusting and horrendous things. People have died from heart attacks before because of the things shown.

Rule #4. Make sure you NEVER say anything to my little sister, unless saying hello. Most frequently, she will be in her room playing with her dolls. If she isn't, notify me or my older brother IMMEDIATELY. This means there's something very very wrong. If you find her wandering throughout the house, GET OUT. If she's wandering through the house, it means it has taken control of her and it's looking for you. If they find you, they will cause you to feel horrible pain.

Rule #5. My older brother will always be kind, but sometimes, they will imitate him, and if there are two of my brothers in front of you, ALWAYS choose the one to your left. He wants to help you stay safe, and will always be on your left. If you choose the one on the right, you will be taken by them and put through unimaginable torture.

Good luck, friend. I know these rules seem strange, but just know that these are all for your safety. I have seen many come here prior to you and I've had much experience with people. Some just dont like to follow rules. Dont be like them. I hope you follow these rules. If you do, my family will be so kind to you. If not... well... let's not get into that...
