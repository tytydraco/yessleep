Hello, I need you to listen to what I have to say. 
I met my wife 5 years ago. We dated for a few years and as I didn’t have much of a family, her folks took me in and we married 3 years after. They had a large farm and acres of land in north Iowa. Her family even let us live in a small property close to the main farmhouse. 

There was however part of the farm that was heavily restricted and whenever I bought this up to my wife, she just said it was only where they ran their meat distribution business. The only family members allowed up there were her father and 3 uncles. This was apparently down to “safety reasons” but I still didn’t see why that would result in it being out of bounds. I saw a  lot of vehicles going to and from this part of the farm throughout the week, even some vehicles that didn’t come back down the track. The area was at least a mile away from the main farmyard.

Around  3 weeks ago I decided I would drive up there and make an excuse to get access. This was the turning point where everything I had told before just didn’t add up. As I neared the gate a large, rough looking bearded man stepped out of a shed next to the opening,  a 12 gauge shotgun in hand. I had never seen him before but he knew me, he said I shouldn’t be here and to go back to the farm. I stated I had to speak to my father in law urgently about a cultivator issue. He then abruptly said I will let him know and I was to leave now.

I got back into the car and looked past the barrier as I turned the around, there must have been 20-30 people doing different jobs running around busy working. I noticed there was also a track that led away from the farm on the other side. It had never been mentioned or I had never seen it before. Later that night, my wife said that her father was angry that I had come up to that part of the farm and I should never go back up there uninvited again. I questioned what the big deal was, I worked around dangerous and heavy machinery every day! She just looked at me and said “just drop it”. At that point I knew she knew exactly the reason why I shouldn’t go up there. 

Me being me I just couldn’t drop it, it was all I could think about day and night. My first thought, was were they an organised crime family but surely I would have noticed this! Unfortunately the truth was worse than I could ever have imagined. 

Three days ago I made a decision to find out what was happening, I woke up at 2:30am and quietly left the house. I got into my car which I had purposely parked away from the farm to avoid waking anyone. I drove around the farmland which was around a 7 mile detour and came to what I had worked out to be the track on the opposite side of the farm. 

I pulled up nearby and started walking down the side of the road. I got about halfway down the pitch dark trail, flashlight in hand, when headlights flooded the the road in front of me. I scampered into the overgrown bushes that lined the route, turning my small flashlight off as I slid. As the truck flashed past me, I noticed that this was a Government vehicle accompanied by an armoured escort. At this point I was getting quite anxious about what I had got myself into. Once they had gone I carried on down the road. I came up to a small shed with a barrier, there was someone sat inside. I managed to find a small gap under the surrounding fence around 50 meters up, so I didn’t have to get into the same confrontation as before. 

The yard was lit by multiple floodlights and I could hear muffled talking from all around me seemingly coming from the buildings. There were two big barns and 3 smaller cabins. I saw that there was an even smaller cabin at the end with no lights on and decided I would go to see if there was a way in. By one of the cabin 2-3 armed men sat around a fire, they seemed to be quite drunk which gave me the chance to get to the vacant cabin. There was a window open on the far side just enough for me to prise open and clamber through. 

On appearance this seemed to be an office and storage room. Files and books on shelves lined the walls with a computer in the center. I ran my flashlight across the files, they were all organised into batches, grouped by dates. I grabbed one and flicked through it. There were hundred’s of names listed that were only separated by dozens of the word “Unknown” page after page. I stopped on one page and read across “Name: Unknown / Gender: male / Age: 40-60 then the next category turned my stomach, “Parts extracted:” it then began to list the organs: Liver, heart, kidney(s), eye(s) then just stated “rest of meat to mincer”. The list of names was endless. Every file had a signed federal approval page at the beginning. I slumped to the floor in disbelief, asking myself if I was somehow part of this twisted farm which specialised in human livestock?!

I had to see what was in the barns, I couldn’t just take these books as proof. I shakily made my way back through the window and closed it to how it was. I crept, back arched and head down to one of the big barns evading the floodlit grounds around me. I got to the first barn and tried to look through the gap in between the panels, nothing but darkness met my eyes. I hastily shone my flashlight through, I saw bloodstained machinery, metal tables with medical instruments lined the far wall. There was a large door at the end marked “chiller”, I made my way round and saw that the door led to a large metal extension with a generator humming beside it. I then made my way to the other barn, I was suddenly hit by the stench of what I can only describe as death. I peered through the wooden panels, there was 5 large metal pens that were spaced out throughout the barn. Each of one of them housed between 10-15 people all of whom were in and out of a state of consciousness. 

I suddenly lost my footing and slipped as I tried to get a better view. My right knee  slammed heavily against the wooden panel. I saw the men by the fire  jump up heading my direction, I ran, making a dart to towards the fence opening, hoping the darkness would cloak my movement. I jumped as three shots came from behind me I did a quick body check, I was fine. Fortunately they didn’t pursuit the source of the sound with any conviction. As I slipped through the fence and into the bushes, I couldn’t believe that nobody had seen me. I suddenly looked back in horror as I saw something I had missed before. There were security cameras high up on all four corners. I was screwed, they would know that I knew. I got back to the house,  I couldn’t bring myself to go back inside, I just had to get out of there. I grabbed three Jerry cans of petrol from my storage shed and filled the tank up with the fourth. I left that night. 

This leads me here 1100 miles away, people need to know the truth, these places exists and one was being run right under my nose. I have ditched my phone and anything else linking me to my past life but I know that won’t be enough if the feds are involved. I have borrowed my old buddies computer to share these details with you, I can only hope that the software I used will protect him from being dragged into this. 

I don’t know what my next move is but if I can get to a computer or phone I will update you on the situation, I will expose this industry one way or another. 

Look out for each other, you don’t want to make it on the list.
