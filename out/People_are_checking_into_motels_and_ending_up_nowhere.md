It started with Aisha Baker. 

My patrol area included the Motel Mile. There's plenty to keep law enforcement busy there. I don't think motels were ever *great*, but if you have a legitimate need for a place to stay these days, law abiding citizens are almost invariably using airBnB and VRBO. 

We got called for altercations frequently. Most of the motels were spaced out, the “mile” was actually several miles; but two were across the street from each other, and the owners were as bad as the patrons. They'd get into drunken brawls in the road sometimes. Marvin said it's a feud that dates back more than 50 years. 

My partner, Marvin, had been on the force a long time. He hadn't said as much to me, but if he had a motto it was probably “pick your battles.” We didn't make a fraction of the arrests we could have, but he said it's better to know where the rats' nest is.

We got a lot of missing persons cases in our town that wound their way back to the Motel Mile. Some were harder to trace than others. Sometimes people were reported missing from there. Other times we were asked to go have a chat with one of the managers or the other, on account of Marvin's long standing relationships with them. They typically clammed up as soon as he said it was a missing person, and Marvin would lean across the desk and in a conspiratorial tone say, “I'm not trying to make your life difficult. If you can just give me a yes or no, was she here or not? And I'll leave you alone.”

They'd begrudgingly say yes, or maybe insist the answer is no. We'd get in the squad car and sometimes he'd say, “Sumbitch was lying to me,” before calling in a report with the conclusion he came to. I didn't know how he could tell they were lying, honestly, but I studied their responses to try and learn what he saw. You need five years on the force and to sit for an exam, but I wanted to make detective someday.

If you're wondering how so many missing persons cases were going unnoticed, it comes with the territory. The clientele at these places were usually either there for prostitution or drugs, but there were also extremely cheap or extremely poor tourists on road trips. Our town is a no-name place but it is the halfway point between two larger cities. 

Most of the missing persons cases were more or less what you'd expect. Working girl ran off. Junkie wandered into the woods. Traveler on their way from nowhere to nowhere went missing somewhere along the way, but stayed in our town one night.

We had what I thought was a regular case of a girl running away. Her parents called it in. Aisha Baker had just turned 18 and had been seen in the company of a petty criminal, before getting into a fight with her parents, storming out of their house, and not returning.

I didn't think much of it, but we got the call to go ask around at the motel where this criminal, Everett, was known to set up shop, and Marvin didn't like it.

“Everett knows better than to mess with a girl like that,” he muttered.

But still, we did our job. Marvin spotted Everett's car and parked us behind it, blocking it in. We then paid a visit to the front desk. The owner’s daughter was working. She seemed too young and too pretty to be in such a seedy motel.

She gave us a shrug and a copy of a room key. “She checked in last night. Didn't check out. Room was empty so housekeeping turned it over.”

Everett had seen us pull in, but had wisely decided not to try to run for it on foot.

He burst out of his room as we were on our way to check out her room. “Marvin, I don't know what happened to her. You gotta believe me, she said she just needed a place to crash so I got her the room, I didn't touch her, I wouldn't do that to Elijah, please you gotta tell him I don't know, I wouldn't do him like that. I never laid hands on a girl in my life,” he babbled, clearly distraught, his pale hands practically twitching.

Marvin put his hands on his hips. “Slow down,” he said. “So you were with her?”

“No I - well yes. She had a fight with her parents and needed a place to stay,” he said. “I wasn't with her, with her. I just said I could spot her.”

“Out of the goodness of your heart?”

Everett fidgeted. “This is more fucking trouble than it's worth,” he said. “Never shoulda messed with a rich girl. Elijah's going to kill me. I thought I was doing him a solid.”

Marvin said, “Look, you and I, I like to think we have a pretty good relationship.”

“Oh absolutely, I never lie to you, you know that, Marvin, buddy-”

“So what we're going to do here, is you're going to tell me what you got. If you have anything on you, you'd better return it to me. Call it a token of good will. And then you're going to lay low for a while. You're not going to leave the state, because that's going to look worse for you, but maybe go visit your dad. I'll deal with Elijah. Sound fair?”

“Sounds fair,” Everett said. He disappeared into his room and came back. “Good will, like you said.”

He dropped a ziplock bag with some jewelry into Marvin's hands.

“Remember what I said. About looking suspicious? If this isn't everything, attention is going to fall right back on you.”

Everett hesitated. “Look man, I'm already out the money for the room-”

“And a murder charge is going to be a lot worse for your wallet than a night at the Scarsborough Motor Inn.”

“Jesus, Marvin, okay. Is it that bad?”

“It's that bad.”

He left and returned a second time with a gold chain and a watch. “That’s all of it, I swear. If she was missing anything else, she pawned it, it's not with me.”

“Thank you, Everett.”

“You'll move your car?”

“In a minute,” Marvin said affably. “Might have another couple of questions for you.”

We went to Aisha's room. It was clean, for a motel room that had seen better days. It was clear housekeeping had been in and turned down the room. Marvin looked in a couple drawers before saying, “Well this is a waste of fucking time.”

We went back out and Everett was still there. He had thrown all his stuff in the back of his car and was fidgeting with his keys. 

“Okay Everett, I got a couple questions and then you can go. I don't think you had anything to do with Aisha, but she's a good girl. Headed to college in the fall. If we don't find her, there's going to be some heat, you understand? So you gotta be transparent with me. If I think you're lying, if I find out you lied, I'm not going to help you, and I am what's standing between you and the AG, you understand?”

“Yep, yep, sure.” He looked visibly nervous. 

“Walk me through what happened. People have seen you running around with her.”

“Look man- it's not like that. She was just looking for some quick cash and wanted to say fuck you to her old man. I walked her through what she should take. What's valuable, what isn't, what's easy to get rid of. I gave you everything she gave me, probably worth a few grand. She said she needed a place to lay low until I could get her the money so I spotted her a room.”

“And then?”

“The last I fucking saw of her, man. I didn't want to be involved so I gave her the cash and she booked her own room. Next thing I know, she's gone.”

“What do you mean, gone?”

“Well I knocked on her door this morning to see if she needed anything, breakfast, whatever. She didn't have a car, I think that's what she needed the money for. I left to do my thing and when I came back the housekeepers were cleaning the room. They said it didn't even look like anyone had slept there.”

“That's it?” Marvin said.

“That's it.”

“All right,” Marvin said. “How did she seem? Upset at all?”

“No, normal, I guess. Kinda quiet but friendly enough.” 

Marvin had me pull the car into a regular spot. Everett peeled out of the parking lot.

“Should we just let him go like that?” I asked.

“He's not going to go far. He has a sick father in Whitney so he's not going to leave the state unless they put out a warrant for him. They wont do that unless they're fucking idiots – so I suppose they might, but that’s their problem.” He heaved a big sigh. “I hate cases like these.”

“Why?” I asked.

“We're not going to solve it. She's gone. She's not coming back.”

“How do you know that?” 

“Call it intuition. I don't know how a girl without a car gets too far, or even why she would leave the motel. It's not safe. There's naïve and then there's stupid, which this girl wasn't. If she hitchhiked from this dump, her odds aren't good. And if she took desperate measures like that, she's not likely to come back voluntarily.”

“You don't think Everett did something to her?”

“The thing about Everett is he's a coward. I'm not saying he would never hurt a woman, just if he did it's going to be one of the usual crowd and not a girl with family and prospects. And he's afraid of Elijah.”

We paid a call to Elijah. I don't think we were supposed to, as it was outside of our patrol area, and the detective on the case hadn't asked us to. But at the end of the shift Marvin asked, “Are you coming with me?” so we pulled up in the squad car outside Foreign Auto Repair. It was late so the shop was closed, but there were a few guys outside smoking cigarettes who eyed us. 

They made me nervous but Marvin said, “Jesus fucking Christ, kid. They're illegals, not cannibals,” and I made an effort to relax. 

“They look suspicious,” I said.

“Two cops just pulled up. Of course they're suspicious. Try not to look so much like you're about to draw your service weapon.”

So with that we headed inside. I looked around, wondering if I'd see evidence of a chop shop. I gathered Elijah must be a criminal if Everett associated with him.

“Elijah,” Marvin said. The biggest man I have ever seen had come out of a dingy office to greet us. I took an involuntary step back. He should have been playing in the NFL, not working in a shop. 

“Marvin.”

“This here is my partner, Jared.”

I gave an awkward half wave. 

Elijah snorted. “This about Aisha?”

“It's about Everett.” 

Elijah's expression darkened.

“He wasn't involved,” Marvin said quickly. “Well… He might have been the last person to see her, but no funny business. He gave me this as a token of goodwill.”

He tossed the bag of jewelry to Elijah. “What's this,” Elijah asked. “A bribe?”

“Ask your uncle.”

“That thieving little-” he stopped himself. “She's still missing?”

“Yeah,” Marvin said. “We got our top guys on it. Me, Jared, they even sent down a detective from the city.”

Elijah covered his face. “Fuck,” he said. “I should wring that little punk's neck anyway. He had no business messing with her. Should have come to me.”

“Well, look at it this way, if you try to prevent a girl at that age, she's just going to get what she wants in a different way. Sometimes the devil you know is better than the one you don't.”

“Sometimes the devil you know is still the devil.” Elijah punched the nearby pillar and then winced. He shook out his hand. “Is that what Everett told you?”

“No, more of a professional observation. Everett was doing his best. He's an idiot and a weasel but he wouldn't intentionally fuck you over.”

“Maybe.”

“Let me put it this way, I don't think he did anything to her, and maybe he's guilty of negligence and being a moron, but if you break his teeth it's going to draw attention away from the actual investigation.”

“But you're going to investigate?” Elijah said hopefully.

“She was a good girl from a good family. We're going to do everything we can. She was on the Motel Mile but that doesn't make her a Motel Mile girl. Just remember what I did for you here,” he said, with a nod to the baggie. “Buy yourself some favor with the old man. Family has to stick together in times like these.”

He turned and left, and I hurried after him. We got back in the car and Marvin let out a huge sigh, hands shaking.

“Goddamn mess. They don't pay me enough for this shit.”

“What… just happened? Did you just take the evidence of a crime and give it to another suspect?”

“Suspect. Ha. No. I did him a favor in exchange for not beating the living crap out of Everett, which was going to be a whole lot of paperwork.”

“A favor?”

“He can take the jewelry and return it to Aisha's father personally. He can swear up and down he didn't know, and that he beat up the asshole who was going to fence it. Won't bring Aisha back but it does keep Elijah from being excommunicated from the family. He's already the bastard criminal branch of it.”

“But why… would you do that for Elijah? …or Everett? And won't it come out at trial that you tampered with evidence?”

“I'll leave it for you to deduce, Mr. Detective. As for a trial - there won't be one. There's no evidence of a murder and they won't find any.”

“How do you know that?”

“I just know. Now shut up and be less annoying for a minute.”

The investigation and search for Aisha was lukewarm at best. The trail went completely cold at the Scarsborough. I figured she must have hitchhiked, or had a boyfriend come pick her up or something. It didn't make a whole lot of sense that she would leave all that money on the table, but if it were truly a fuck you to her parents, maybe it wasn't the money she was after.

After a little while longer on the force, I was truly in awe of Marvin's judgment. He didn't make mistakes in his assessment of people. He had a sixth sense when it came to knowing when they were lying. He had been a cop in this part of town for long enough that he knew all the players, their motivations, and the overall politics of the community, in particular the criminal elements. 

He also had a way of dealing with people that departed from what was strictly law enforcement. As we spent more time together I understood it was less about picking his battles and more about…something else. Not quite justice. Maybe peace? Setting things right according to his definition of it, even if it was outside of the law. He dealt with people in a way that was fair. And they responded to it, giving him information and respect.

We had a couple more odd cases, people going missing that made him say, “Goddamn it, I hate this job.” It happened seemingly at random. We'd have some requests to investigate where he seemed to make a good faith effort, but others where he didn't even really try. I couldn't spot the pattern.

I asked him once why he didn't want to become a detective. His people skills, while abrasive and unconventional, were incredibly effective. He had an unparalleled intuition for who he needed to talk to and when, and how to get them to talk. We saw a small fragment of investigations, being beat cops, and the ones we did see seemed more because Marvin knew how to handle people than because it was something patrol cops should be doing. It was a great learning experience for me. I saw him as essentially a detective who was stuck doing regular police work. 

“Stuck?” He snorted so hard he choked on a French fry and spent a whole minute coughing it back up. We had stopped for lunch. “Some detective skills you have there, Sherlock. No, I don't want the job, and I'm cheaper if they don't make me one. I do their job for them anyway.”

“How could you not want the job? Are you happy just being a patrol officer your whole life?”

“Did politeness die off with your generation? Jesus fucking Christ.”

I backpedaled. “I mean, it's a respectable job and all, but don't you ever want something more?”

“Not better. Being a detective isn't about finding fingerprints and putting together the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. It's talking to people and being good at it. A word of advice for you. You're smart, but you're off putting. You look like a skinhead and you act like a smug asshole, which is fine for a cop. Preferred, really. But if you want to be a good detective you need to be at least a little more likable. People have to *want* to tell you stuff.

“If we're done throwing insults around, I don't want to be a detective, no. The more questions you ask the more questions you uncover. There aren't answers, not really. Eventually you see enough and you don't need to see any more. Why do you want to be a detective, anyway?”

“It's always been my dream, you know, solving crimes. Getting to the truth.”

“I don't believe in the truth,” Marvin said.

“What do you mean…? It’s the truth? It's not up for debate.”

“That’s where you and I differ. Gravity is a fact, sure. The moon, whatever. But when it comes to the realm of human existence… there's just a series of levers and probabilities. There's never something as clear cut as a fact.”

“But say you find a murder weapon, with a suspects fingerprints on it and the blood of their victim.”

“Maybe they even did it,” Marvin said. “But did the other person have it coming?”

“Of course not, murder is a crime.”

“That's where you and I differ. The system fails, too consistently and too often, for me to be able to say. ”

“I think I see what you're saying. I need more perspective.”

“No, that's not what I'm saying at all.”

“Well, what are you saying?” I was starting to get a little mad.

“I'm saying I don't want to be a detective. Now drop it.”

We got another call that very afternoon. Marvin beat his head against the steering wheel. “I. Fucking. Hate. This. Job,” he said. Then he put the car in drive.

“What's wrong with this case?”

“What do you mean?” 

“It's another missing person and you already know we're not going to find them. How?”

“We have two different approaches to police work. You are Mr. Sherlock Holmes, so when a crime occurs, you work backwards from there, slotting in pieces that fit until you have a plausible explanation for how what did occur, could have occurred. Maybe even how it most likely could have occurred.”

“As opposed to?”

“I'm not a detective. I've just been at this job a long time. I've met a lot of folks. I understand what they do and do not do. And sometimes a case comes along, where the situation is such, that there is a series of events so improbable they are impossible. I mean, you could say, Jane got to the deserted island they found her on, by stealing a plane. Physically possible, sure. But Jane doesn't have a pilot's license. She doesn't, as far as anyone knows, fly planes. Maybe she took secret flying lessons. But there's no paper trail. Maybe she was a secret gambler and paid under the table, with her winnings. All possible, none *that* hard to believe on their own, but as a collection it’s just so far out of what is likely for a middle aged nurse and mother of two to do, that it's impossible, from a probability standpoint. Every now and then a case comes along and you can just see it from a mile away. It doesn't add up. And we've never once solved one of those cases. So what we're really doing is damage control disguised as a legitimate investigation.”

“People go missing all the time and turn up.”

“Not Randy Wilson,” he said darkly. “Not in a motel.”

The Danvers Motel was the nicest of the several motels on the strip, and catered the most often to legitimate travelers. Or Marvin said, to locals having affairs. 

The clerk at the desk was therefore very tight lipped when we started asking questions. Marvin asked to speak to the manager, who wasn't in. He said he was going to call the owner and suddenly the manager was running from the back office. 

“Sorry about that, just got in,” he said breathlessly. “How can I help you, officers?” He looked at me. 

“This is Jared,” Marvin said. “He's all right. I'm supposed to ask you about Randy Wilson.”

“I don't think we have a guest by that name staying here,” he said.

“Well, that's inconvenient,” Marvin said. “The boys wanted to get a warrant but I said you were sensible and would let us take a look at the guest list. He's not wanted for anything, he's a missing person. The family is very concerned, time is of the essence, you know how it is, Paul.”

“Why don't you let me check? I don't know everyone who's been here the last few days.”

“Sure thing,” Marvin said. 

Paul came back with a note. “We had a Wilson on the register. Paid in cash. Left this morning.”

“Checked out or just left?”

“Well - he just left actually. The key is missing.”

“That's what I thought,” Marvin said.

“Those cameras work?” I interjected. There were security cameras above the desk. I thought I had seen one outside as well. It probably captured Randy coming and if we were lucky would have also caught him going.

“I'm sorry, but you are going to need a warrant for those,” Paul said.

“I understand,” Marvin interjected. “We'll get the boys working on it but it will probably be a few days before we come back. Thank you for your help, Paul, I always appreciate it.”

We left. 

“Don't you want to see what's on those cameras?”

“I already know,” Marvin said. “Probably won some brownie points with Paul warning him like that, though, smart.”

“I –” I hadn't intended the question as a warning, but it was my first compliment from Marvin so I let it go. “Do you think we'll see him on there, then?”

“No.”

Marvin didn't seem inclined to elaborate, but I couldn't stand it. “Marvin, what the hell is going on?”

“I don't know,” he said. “And I don't think I ever will.” He clammed up and I couldn't get him to elaborate any further.

I did some searching on my own. There are a lot of people reported missing every year. 75% of them are found right away. 24% are found eventually. 1% of them are never found. I had access to the police database, so I printed off a list of every missing persons case in our area in the last decade that was unresolved. At first I was looking at suspicious circumstances, but I realized Aisha Baker running away made her circumstances less suspicious. So I widened my net again. I circled all the cases that had made Marvin upset. There wasn't a clear correlation between them. Age, race, socioeconomic background, all varied. All reported last seen at a motel. 

I asked Marvin the next day what they all had in common. He looked at my list and said, “Not bad, rookie. Some actual police work.”

“How do you know if a missing persons case is unusual? That it won't be solved?”

“Just a feeling,” Marvin said.

“What kind of feeling?”

“Well, if you dig into them, it's usually a person who has no business being at a motel. A girl like Aisha Baker, she had friends, she had money. Hell, she had Elijah. She had no business rolling with Everett, to a motel of all places.”

“She couldn't have pawned her dad's stuff through Elijah. “

“No, but she didn't pawn anything, did she? She disappeared before he could move the goods.”

“Well that's if she up and left. If something happened to her-” 

“You're not wrong. It's a reasonable assumption, if you assume her end goal was to leave home, and disappearing was a side effect. But what if it wasn't?”

“Randy Wilson, then. How do we know he didn’t skip town?”

“The proof’s in the pudding. It's hard to permanently disappear these days, especially when you don’t have two nickels to rub together. But they're never going to find him.”

“Why not? What do you know that I don't?”

“If I show you, will you stop asking so many goddamn questions?”

I agreed easily.

Marvin instructed me to come pick him up on our day off. So I did. He asked me to drive him to a motel.

“Are we doing a reenactment of the crime, or…?”

“Just drop me off, will you?”

“And then what?”

“And then go home.”

“Are you serious?”

“Yeah, I needed a ride.”

“You have a perfectly good– you know what, never mind. Fine,” I said, peeved. I decided to just leave him at the motel with no way to get home. It would serve him right. 

I dropped him off and peeled out before he was even inside. He texted me a few seconds later.

*Come back*

*This a joke?* I wrote back, pissed. 

*No*

I was angry but I turned the car around.

Marvin was outside, holding a door cracked open. I parked and leapt out, ready to yell at him for wasting my time on a ridiculous prank on my day off, but he looked at me with wide eyes and waved me over. He put a finger to his lips. I'd never seen Marvin scared before. No matter where he was he always seemed in his element. Cranky, but in his element.

I walked over cautiously, my hand on my firearm. 

He cracked the door open a little farther. It was dark, pitch dark. At first I thought the blinds were closed, but I realized crappy motel blinds were never totally blackout like this. The gap in the door wasn't casting any light into the room. As my eyes adjusted to the light level, which was actually only very dark, not completely pitch black, I began to pick out shapes in the room. I then realized they were moving.

“Marvin, what the fuck-”

He closed the door. 

“No noises with them. Don’t make too much noise.” 

“With who? Who's in there?”

“Nobody,” he said, and opened the door. It was just a normal room. Queen bed, navy blue carpet, not well lit but definitely not pitch black. It was empty. It also seemed much smaller than it had just a moment ago. I had a bout of severe vertigo and my butt hit the curb. 

Marvin took pity on me and drove me to a cafe. “Coffee helps,” he said.

I gulped down some of the scalding coffee and I did feel a little better.

“What was that?”

“I don't know.” 

“I'm serious, what was that?”

“I don't know,” he repeated. “I call it the nowhere.”

“And it just… shows up?”

“Sometimes. If certain conditions are met. You have to be looking for it.”

“Why would anyone be looking for that? It's awful.”

“I wonder that myself, sometimes.”

“How did you… did they… is that where…?” I was floundering. My description doesn’t do it justice. I only saw it for a moment but it was deeply unsettling. Marvin took pity on me at last. “Welcome to the club, kid,” he said. “That's why I don't ever want to be a detective. You have to ask all kinds of questions like, “why” and “how” but there's no explaining the nowhere. It's best if you can forget it entirely but… You start seeing cases and they just have nowhere written all over them. You can't unsee it.”

“But what is it?” I asked plaintively.

“Don't know. I think it's a place. But you don't come out if you go in.”

“And people go there?”

“Sometimes.”

“Why?”

“It's a certain type of person. With a certain type of psyche. The kind of person who has nothing left. If you have nothing, nowhere seems pretty appealing, don't you think?”

“Maybe…” I said. “But Aisha Baker didn't have nothing…”

“She was a teenager. Everything is a matter of life and death with them. Isaiah Baker is a piece of work besides. She went to that motel knowing what she would find.”

“Well?” I asked.

“What.”

“How did she know?”

“No idea. I'm not a detective.” Marvin was back in Marvin form.

“You have to know something,” I said. “You know too much to not know something.”

“How she learned about it, no idea. However kids learn about shit they're too young to know about. Probably TikTok or something.”

“How do you know about it?”

“Somebody showed me. Some people, kids especially, if they open a door they have to walk through it. No impulse control. Some people though, they take their time. They open the door three or five or ten times before they're ready. And the whole time they have the knowledge in their pocket like a hundred dollar bill, burning a hole until they show someone.”

“Who showed you?”

“A friend.”

He seemed reluctant to share more on that front so I changed tactics. “Why did they show you?”

“They thought I was like them. Ready to open a door and walk into oblivion, if it would have me.”

“But you weren't. You didn't go.”

“No.”

“So what, if you show up at a motel sometimes it's a portal to hell? How has no one else discovered this?”

“You have to be in a certain frame of mind. You have to have no place else to go. You have to make a one way trip to a hotel or motel. I wasn’t sure you were going to turn around and come back for me, which would have left me stranded. 

“You have to really want it. Most people who stumble on it are already halfway gone. The other half isn't going to bother them so much. But that's the thing about stepping out of your life. You can do it at any time. The thing that lives inside motels… that's different. It's like… you can get swallowed up by something that's larger than yourself. Some people want that. Suicide is too messy or too empty.”

“What happened to you, Marvin?”

“None of your business.”

I had asked the wrong question and he clammed up entirely. I didn't have the courage to ask him anything else for another few days. He was more irate than normal.

I dug into some of the missing people. I tried to understand where they were in their lives, before they left them. A few loved ones thanked me in earnest for reviewing their cold case. I told them not to get their hopes up. A couple of families said they knew the person wasn't still alive, but they wanted closure. They wanted their remains. 

I asked around a little, but there was not a whole lot about Aisha. I gave Elijah a wide berth. Her father Isaiah was a very religious man. Strict, some might say overbearing. Aisha was a straight A student, did well at sports, the class treasurer. 

Randy was easier to clock. His friends reported he seemed depressed and withdrawn for a long time before his disappearance. He was recently fired from his job, because he had fallen off the wagon. He left very little behind. He wasn't married, no kids, not much money to speak of.

I started reading through police reports. Suspected suicide, assumed runaway, any sort of personal disturbances prior to disappearing all seemed like a good bet. The list continued to shrink as I crossed out anyone who didn't fit the profile.

I showed it to Marvin again. He said it looked pretty good. He even took out a pen and crossed out a couple names for me, but circled a few I had crossed out. “Check again,” he said. 

“How could you possibly know?”

“I just know,” he said.

We had spent about a year and a half on the force together, and around that time Marvin became a little more erratic. He was more impatient with people. Occasionally hostile. We got another call to ask about a missing persons case and he got written up for insubordination because he refused to go. In my county, detective is a lateral move in terms of rank. You get paid more, and you're on a different track, but you don't actually outrank your fellow officers. So a detective wrote him up for not doing what he asked, but he took it to the union, who ruled the detective wasn't actually allowed to issue him orders and write him up, and our supervisor wasn't inclined to enforce the order, because Marvin was, well, Marvin. So it got dropped. But it was the first time I had seen him do such a thing, and gave me a clue as to why he had never made detective. The write up didn't get attached to his record, but if you do that a few times people tend to leave you to your own devices. 

I asked him about it. He said he wasn't going to waste his time, and he was tired of lying to families that there was hope for their missing loved one. Daniel Alma was not going to be found.

Marvin started to drink copious amounts of coffee. He had a cup in his hand at all times. We were making more frequent stops at the convenience store and donut shop. 

I mentioned it to him and he just snapped that I should mind my own business.

I continued my investigation of the missing persons list. Daniel was added, of course. The interesting thing someone mentioned to me was he had been attending AA meetings. So had Randy before he fell off the wagon.

I dropped by just to see what they were about. I mean, I knew what they were about, but I had never been to one and I didn't really know what happened at them. I dropped by one at the local rec center after work, one that Daniel used to go to.

To my shock and embarrassment, Marvin was there. I was torn between fleeing immediately, or sitting through and trying to remain inconspicuous. I took a seat near the back and sat low in my chair. I put a couple dollars in when they passed the plate around, my face hot. I caught Marvin looking at me once, by which point it was far too late to leave. I sat through a few people's stories and then it was time to go.

I nearly ran for exit. 

To my deep embarrassment, Marvin mentioned it. He didn't say much, just that if I ever needed to talk, he had been through it all before, as we cruised in the squad car. I hid my face in my hands. It was the kindest he'd ever been. He patted me on the shoulder and said it was nothing to be ashamed of, AA was probably the least embarrassing part of the whole thing.

I stuttered out an explanation - it was the missing persons list, Daniel Alba - I don't know exactly what I said. But Marvin deflated like a balloon.

It was around this time I started having nightmares. I'd open a door and the darkness would be there. I'd slam the door and turn around, but when I'd look back it would be open again. I'd have sleep paralysis episodes where I thought the shapes from the nowhere were crawling from beneath my bed or out from my closet.

I joined Martin in his compulsive coffee habit. “Do you have nightmares about the nowhere?” I asked him.

I caught him off guard. “No,” he said. “I have nightmares about everything else.”

“What do you mean?”

But he went quiet and stonewalled me again.

He did that a lot more in those days. When we first started working together, he was grouchy and would snap at me, but would usually unwind enough to answer my questions eventually. But later - after Daniel Alba and the incident at AA - he was just as likely to stop talking to me about anything not strictly patrol related for the rest of the shift.

I can see now we were on a downward spiral. I wonder, though, if I could have done more to help Marvin. To save him.

I showed up to the station one day. Marvin wasn't there. I asked around if he called out, but he hadn't. It wasn't like him to just not show up.

With a sick sense of dread I hopped in our car, alone. I called a couple of the motels on the Motel Mile until I talked to someone who said they'd seen him, not more than a minute ago. I flicked on my lights and sped through every stoplight to get there, praying that I wasn't too late.

I was; and I wasn't. I wish every day I had been just a few minutes earlier. I wish also, failing that, I had been just a minute later. Although I try not to admit that to myself most of the time. 

But I wasn't too early or too late. I arrived, in the nature of things, at the exact moment. With the lights going, I saw the black rectangle of the open door as I was pulling up. I skidded to a halt, threw the car into park, and leapt out, shouting after Marvin, “Don't, don't!” Marvin was wavering, not in resolve, but physically wavering as he stood in the doorway. He took an unsteady step forward, and then he was gone. I took a few sprinted steps after him and then realizing I wouldn't make it in time, I dove, wedging the door open with my fingertips as it threatened to close after him. I lay silently, remembering his warning. I was on the ground, looking back at the flashing lights. I had scared the motel patrons into their dens for the night, and they were unlikely to wander out as long as the lights were still going. My phone, stupidly, was still sitting in the center console of the car where I had dropped it. I couldn't call for help. I lay for a moment, pointedly not looking into the abyss that I held pried open with my hand. I noticed the abandoned liquor bottle on the curb. I didn't know how long Marvin would last in there on his own, so I couldn’t wait until the station tried to radio me.

So I did what any idiot would do. I got up, took a deep breath, and I stepped inside.
