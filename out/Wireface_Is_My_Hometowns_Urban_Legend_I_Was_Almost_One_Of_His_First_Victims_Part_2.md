The wound didn’t feel very deep, but was bleeding pretty bad, and hurt more with each passing second. I had no time to wallow over it, with the approaching figure’s footsteps getting louder. Pressing one hand against the wound, I got back on my feet, and staggered toward the general direction Steph and Mason fled.

I wanted to make a break for my car, but wouldn’t make it in time without being seen. I had two choices—hide out in the woods until the coast was clear, or head to the river, (which was only a few hundred yards from our campsite) and follow it back to the main road. No sooner than I entered the tree line, however, I was bearhugged by something that brought me to the ground. They placed one hand over my mouth, and firmly held me in place behind a cluster of trees and brush.

“Shh,” I heard Brock whisper. “Don’t. Fucking. Move.”

A wave of relief swept over me upon realizing it was Brock. Still pinned to the ground, I could see most of our campsite through a small opening behind our cover. I watched the figure exit the tree line….and got my first ever glimpse of Wireface.

He wasn’t particularly tall, maybe an inch or two under six feet. He had long lanky arms,  and a slender but firm-looking physique. He wore a blue checkered plaid shirt, tattered gray overalls, along with thick dark gloves and boots that were smeared with blood, dirt, and mud. He wore a beige burlap sack over his head, which was tightly wrapped in strands of barbed wire that had two small slits for him to see.

Wireface slowly surveyed his surroundings before briefly reentering the tree line. He pulled something squirming out of the forest, and dragged it next to Clark’s truck. It was Marvin. His hands and feet were hogtied, and coils of barbed wire were tightly wrapped around his mouth. All he could do was writhe and make muffled cries that were well within earshot. Wireface grabbed a narrow metal pipe from the bed of Clark’s truck, and looked like he was debating what to do with Marvin. I feared the worst, but to my surprise, all Wireface did was set part of the pipe in the fire and reentered the forest. Desperate to intervene, I tried wriggling free, but Brock kept me immobilized.

“You’re really that stupid?!” He hissed in my ear. “That’s exactly what he wants us to do….He’s using Marvin as bait!”

“We can’t just leave him!” I quickly replied at a volume too loud for Brock’s comfort, who clamped his hand over my mouth.

“You trying to get us killed?” Brock snapped back. “Stay. The fuck. Quiet!”

It was a waiting game. I felt just as helpless as Marvin, who could only nude and twist on the ground. I don’t know how long we stayed hunkered down, but enough time passed for me to notice the fire started dying.

“Who….was….that?” I finally whispered to Brock, who soured at my ignorance.

“Come on, you’ve heard the stories,” Brock quietly replied. “Wireface….that’s Wireface.”

My jaw dropped.

“As in….Landry Danes?”

Brock nodded.

“You all here tonight just got caught in the crossfire.”

“What do you mean?” I asked, turning to face Brock.

Brock sighed.

“It’s me he’s after.”

To explain, Brock segued into telling Wireface’s backstory. His name was Landry Danes, a local kid around our age, who lived outside town. A few years ago, Landry was out here camping with friends. The details are sketchy, but he apparently got into some kind of scrum, during which he fell face-first into the campfire. Nothing was ever proven, but there are whispers that Landry was deliberately tripped or pushed. Landry survived, but was hideously disfigured, and wore a burlap sack to hide his face. Some kids bullied him over this, and even made a game out of ripping the burlap sack off Landry’s head to get a glimpse of his face. It drove Landry to wrap strands of barbed wire around his head, which is how he got his proverbial alias.

Then, one night, Wireface attacked a group of kids in a nearby park. He didn’t kill anybody, but apparently butchered one person so brutally, they supposedly begged to be killed. Landry vanished that night, and was never caught. The family claimed they didn’t know where he was, but many suspected they were hiding him on their property. Two years later, the Danes home was destroyed in a fire. No remains were found, and the family was never seen again—except for Wireface.

Since then, some around here claim they’ve encountered Wireface. He’s been blamed for disappearances, cattle deaths, even property damage, but that was all speculation (or so we thought). I was living out of state when all this happened, but heard so many different versions of the story, I couldn’t tell what parts were and weren’t true. One part about it still didn’t make sense. Even after hearing Brock’s clarified rendition, I still didn’t understand why Wireface would be hunting him down.

“This isn’t the first time I’ve seen him,” He whispered after a long hesitant pause. “And I knew, just knew, something was going to happen tonight.”

I narrowed my stare at Brock.

“What do you mean ‘you knew…?’” I asked sternly. “And you didn’t say something?”

“Not that simple,” Brock replied sharply. “Who would take me seriously?”

Before inquiring any further, I looked back at the campfire to get a visual on Marvin. He was still squirming, and his whimpers were compelling me to run out and save him, but Brock kept me in place. In retrospect, it’s probably a good thing he did, because shortly after, Wireface reappeared. Marvin started twisting and whimpering, but Wireface paid no mind and walked right past him up to the campfire. He stared into the flames for a few moments, before retrieving the metal pipe he previously placed in the fire. My stomach knotted when I saw the pipe’s glowing red tip, as Wireface turned towards Marvin. I made one last ditch effort to spring loose, but Brock kept me firmly in place.

“Just look away,” Brock whispered. “There’s nothing we can do for him.”

My view was partially obstructed, but I still watched as Wireface stood over Marvin, and stuck the metal pipe’s glowing red tip in his eye. A crackly high-pitched hiss rang out as Marvin began to thrash wildly and release a barrage of muffled agonizing screams. Wireface was twisting the pipe in his hands as he slowly pushed it deeper into Marvin’s ocular cavity, clearly trying to prolong his death, and inflict the most pain possible.

“Come on. We gotta go now!” Brock whispered as he pulled me away from watching the macabre scene. “My truck’s at the lot. We’ll get there quicker if we follow the river.”

“Steph and Mason are still out there.” I replied, trying to ignore Marvin’s muffled screams, and pulsating pain that erupted from my stab wound when I began moving.

“I saw what Mason did to you,” He replied. “They think you killed Cole….do you trust them to trust you?”

I gave a weak nod as Brock started to pull me away, and move deeper into the woods.

“And with ‘him’ poking around here,” Brock continued. “He’ll get to us first before we find anyone. Let’s just get help. Heck, maybe they wound up following the river too.”

I reluctantly went along with Brock, who did make some good points. Maybe I should just worry about getting to safety at this point, I thought. Why go out of my way trying to save someone’s life, who just moments earlier, showed he had no problem taking mine? These thoughts filled my head as we moved through the woods at a painstakingly slow pace. I guess in some ways that was good, because it kept the pain from my stab wound at ease. It felt like hours, but we finally heard the river’s rushing water. I was eager to reach the riverbank, but Brock put a heavy hand on my shoulder.

“We’re not out of the woods yet,” Brock said quickly. “Short distances can be deceiving.”

He pointed down a few feet in front of us, where the moonlight shone on a strand of barbed wire tied between two trees, just a few inches above the ground. Had Brock not pointed it out, I surely would have tripped over it, and fallen into a few more strands of barbed wiring that were set at varying heights in front of the trip wire. Before I could say anything, something grabbed Brock and spun him around just as I spotted its movement in the corner of my eye. It then got in between us and shoved me to the ground. I lay hunched over on my side, pressing my hand over the stab wound, but was quickly turned onto my backside, and saw the tip of Mason’s blade just inches from my face.

“Mason, relax!” Brock said quickly, walking up to him and placing a hand on Mason’s outstretched arm holding the knife. “

“He killed Cole,” Mason replied, keeping his eyes fixed on me, even while lowering his arm holding the knife. “They gotta be in this together!”

“No….Brock said softly. “He just used him to get to us.”

Brock pulled Mason away, which gave me some time to get recollected, and wait for the pain coming from my stab wound to subside. At first, all I heard were their whispery murmurs, but then Brock and Mason began to argue. While trying to regain my composure, I only picked up a few phrases of their exchange—Brock telling Mason he didn’t have to do that (to me), and Mason saying something along the lines of he didn’t know who to trust. While slowly sitting up, it was something Mason said to Brock—“We’re here because of you!”—that I found peculiar, and caught my attention.

I tried getting back on my feet, when something struck the side of my head that sent a sharp burning streaking across the left side of my face. The impact threw me back to the ground, from which I could feel—without having to see for myself—that blood was spilling from my face’s left side. As my vision readjusted, while slowly sitting up, the first thing I saw was Wireface walk past me, and close in on Brock and Mason.
