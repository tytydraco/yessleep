You know how it feels when you just *know* something is wrong? Like, when you walk into a gas station no one seems to be at, and it just feels odd? That's how they all seemed at first, but it is getting so much worse. 

It started with a whole kindergarten class on a field trip. They left the elementary school in town at 9 am on a Thursday. They were only going across town to a Zoo and Rescue. It was supposed to be a day full of petting goats and chickens, maybe feeding some animals, simple stuff.

They vanished. Bus and all.

Searches went on for months, and it covered every news station you could think of. The town was in disarray. At the time, I was sixteen and helped out at a local mom-and-pop store for some spending money after school. Every day Mr. Nelson, he was the owner, had a little TV turned on, blaring the news. I remember everyone fearing it was some kind of terrorist attack, or some loon subdued the teacher and driver and took them.

Like I said, this went on for months. So long that the school year was over before they came back. 

It was a normal July day, just after the 4th. I was sitting behind the counter, helping Mrs. Nelson sweep up, when we saw what had to be every police car zoom by, headed towards the school. The news spread like wildfire. The bus had just cruised right up to the school and was unloading children. Their teacher didn't seem to realize that no one was even there. 

It was another month of questions, every child, the teacher, bus driver, none of them could answer anything. They all said they went to the zoo, which they never actually reached, and had lunch and came back. Said it was the same day. They knew nothing.

Everyone was so happy they came back that it kind of faded into a bad dream situation and the town went back to normal. I didn't think it was normal, like what the fuck!

The next time, it was an entire church. They were gone for five months. Searches happened, news stations, high-profile police, the whole deal. 

Guess what? When they all just "showed up", everyone was so elated that the strangeness of it dissipated again. 

I thought I was going crazy. What do you mean they vanished and now just appeared, healthy, and still in church clothes?

At this point, I started asking my friends what they thought. A small group of us agreed and started looking into it. Not that seventeen-year-olds could look into much. We went as far as talking to some of the people. They couldn't remember any of the time they were gone. The last thing was always the same. They remember being in church service and it was bright and sunny outside, and they all seemed to blink and it was dark and the middle of the night. No one seemed panicked or even concerned that it had happened. 

That was two years ago.

Since then, random groups of people have vanished just to come back. Sometimes it was months, once it was the next day. They all come back odd. Then it started happening to individuals. The Sheriff left one day and didn't come back for sis weeks. Everyone at the USPS office disappeared in the middle of the day to show up again two months later. My best friend went missing while playing games with me on p.c., then showed up five days later. My parents went out for supper and came back 8 months later. 

It was no longer newsworthy. So many people had gone and come back that not a single soul cared anymore. I think I'm the last one.

For the longest time, everyone just went about their life like normal but something changed. Around a month ago, after keeping track, I came to the realization that I was the only person left in town who hadn't gone and come back. I hadn't talked to anyone in a long time either. The "new" people seemed to avoid conversation altogether. Well, I decided to start talking to everyone. I had questions. Everyone gave me odd looks as I walked through town just trying to chat with anyone. I never got a reply. I think I messed up

Here it is, the big deal. See I've tried to call outside people for help but no more cell signal. Hell, I tried to leave town but every exit is blocked and we are secluded. I don't think hiking the miles it would take to get to the next town would work. I'm not all that into the great outdoors, but I'm scared.

Every night, the town seems to gather outside my house. They just stand there and stare. Every kid, every cop, even my parents. They just, show up, stare, and are gone by morning. But last night they were close. Pressed against the windows, and some were knocking on the house.. I'm terrified about what might happen tonight. 

 The only site that works is this one and I need someone to find me. I live in Clearmont Creek North Carolina, about an hour outside of Asheville. Please someone help me
