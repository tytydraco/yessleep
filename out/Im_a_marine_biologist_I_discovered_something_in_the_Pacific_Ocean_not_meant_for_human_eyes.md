I descended into the abyss, my submersible creaking under the immense pressure of the deep ocean. The only sound was the hum of the engines as I scanned the darkness with my floodlights. I was on a mission to collect a samples of undiscovered animals for a scientific study, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was watching me.

The deeper I descended, the more my senses were heightened. Shadows danced around me, and I swore heard strange whispers in my ear. I tried to shake it off, telling myself that it was just my imagination, but as I reached the ocean floor, I saw it. Something I couldn't even imagine. A gigantic mass of black flesh floated along the bottom of the ocean floor, dragging tentacles along the bottom, hundreds of smaller appendages and feelers sticking out of the shifting black skin.

The eldritch abomination was even more terrifying than I could have ever imagined. It was a massive creature, with tentacles that writhed in the darkness. I maneuvered my submersible towards the creature, carefully positioning my equipment to collect a sample. As I approached, the creature stirred, its tentacles lashing out in anger and hunger. I could feel the submersible shaking as it was attacked. My heart raced as I tried to evade the creature's grasp, but it was no use.

I was certain that this was the end. My life flashed before my eyes as I struggled to break free. But just as I thought it was all over, the creature suddenly released me. I could feel my submersible being dragged away from the creature, I couldn't believe that I had survived, but I knew that I had to act fast. The creature was not done with me yet, and I needed to find a way to escape its grasp. I frantically searched the submersible for any functioning equipment, anything that would give me a chance to escape. It was then that I noticed a small crack in the submersible's window. The pressure of the ocean was slowly seeping in, threatening to flood the submersible at any moment.

With sweat pouring down my face, I managed to reach the surface, the creature's tentacles reaching out towards me in one last attempt to claim its prey. As the submersible broke the surface, my heart still racing from my brush with death, I could see the moon shining above me, and I knew that I had made it out alive. But as I looked back down into the abyss, I knew that I had come too close to something that should never have been [disturbed.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeasideUniverse/comments/12nr1yd/the_1998_seoul_experience_part_one/)

The eldritch abomination may have been asleep before, but it was now awakeand aware of my presence. I couldn't shake the feeling that it was still down there, watching me, waiting for another chance to claim me as its own. The ocean held secrets that were best left undisturbed, and I had learned that lesson the hard way. I had survived, but at what cost? The terror of that creature would haunt me for the rest of my life, a constant reminder of the dangers that lurked in the unexplored [depths of the ocean.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeasideUniverse/comments/mjn4ot/the_complete_seaside_trilogytimeline_in_order/)
